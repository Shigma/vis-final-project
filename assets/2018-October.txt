Subject: [Paraview] .pvtu file distribution
Message-ID: <CAPxeKp_STehaPkzDbrro4MuKFO9BnBkx_a8vz9Wm8X9t=YoYXg@mail.gmail.com>

I am encountering issues loading parallel files in .pvtu format. Each .vtu
file is ~ 4GB, and am running pvserver across four nodes, each with 6 GPUs.

I can get the mesh to load if all the files (.pvtu, and .vtu) are on a
Parallel File System. However, when only the .pvtu file is replicated
across a non-shared file system, and the .vtu files are not, I get an error
loading the file. Are the paraview readers supposed to support this kind of
scenario, where each .vtu file is on a local (fast) filesystem?

Best Regards,
John

Message-ID: <a991311d47da428a8d509915d1e6a8b3@ICTS-S-EXMBX17.luna.kuleuven.be>


Hi,

I am trying to build and install paraview with the superbuild procedure on a MacOS. I have a few questions:

1. When "ENABLE_QT5" is off, it builds successfully. However, "make install" fails due to the following error:

----------------------

[ 44%] Built target paraview
[ 88%] Built target cxx11
[100%] Built target cxx11_check
Install the project...
-- Install configuration: "Release"
CTEST_FULL_OUTPUT
CMake Error at /Library/paraview-superbuild/projects/paraview.bundle.common.cmake:99 (file):

  cannot be read.

  CMakeLists.txt:41 (include)


CMake Error at /Library/paraview-superbuild/projects/apple/paraview.bundle.cmake:9 (message):
  Creating the Apple package without the GUI is not supported.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:41 (include)


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/Library/paraview-superbuild-build/cpack/paraview/DragNDrop/install/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
CMake Error at superbuild/cmake_install.cmake:46 (message):
  Failed to configure the paraview/DragNDrop package.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake_install.cmake:37 (include)

make: *** [install] Error 1

---------------

How can I approach to fix this or is this a bug specific to MacOS?

2. When "Enable_QT5" is on, the configuration fails stating the following error:

-------------------

CMake Error at superbuild/projects/apple/qt5.cmake:2 (message):
Please set the CMAKE_OSX_SDK to use in Qt5's build
Call Stack (most recent call first):
superbuild/cmake/SuperbuildMacros.cmake:894 (include)
superbuild/CMakeLists.txt:147 (superbuild_process_dependencies)


-------------------

I was under the impression that superbuild has all dependencies of paraview (such as qt5) included. Therefore, this error was unexpected. To bypass this, should I now first build a version of qt5 (such as 5.8) from source and then configure preview-superbuild by specifying "QT5_DIR"?

Looking forward to your answers.

Best regards,
Sabyasachi

Good Morning Community,

I am an OpenSees user and using paraview for the first time.

I did sinusoidal analysis of a single quad element in OpenSees and obtained
a pvd output.

Now, I am not being able to open it in Paraview as when I Open the pvd file
in Paraview it shows some error like unstructured grid something like that.

I am not being able to undertsand it. Please help me . I have attached my
pvd output file here in my mail.

Thank You in advance.

Having served us well since August 2001, the paraview at paraview.org mailing
list is now retired. Please direct new questions and comments to

https://discourse.paraview.org

the new forum for the ParaView community.

While the mailing list is being closed to new messages, the archives will
remain available for searching and browsing:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/

New messages to this mailing list will not be sent out to the list
membership. Instead, an automatic reply directing questions to the
Discourse forum will be sent back to the sender.

Thank you, and see you on Discourse!
