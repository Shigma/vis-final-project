Subject: [Paraview] version of VTK?
Message-ID: <1020128162311.ZM13817@kelgia.ncsa.uiuc.edu>

Hi ParaView list,

I didn't see anywhere on the ParaView web pages which version of VTK is
expected.  I ask because I was attempting to build ParaView using a VTK 4.0
build I had and got the usual compile problems of undef'd methods assoc'd with
VTK 3.2:

e.g.
vtkPVActorComposite.cxx: no matching function for call to
`vtkPointData::GetActiveScalars ()'

vtkPVArrayCalculator.cxx: no matching function for call to
`vtkPointData::GetFieldData ()'

Before I go too far down the path of fixing up these compile errors, I just
thought I'd ask about the status of ParaView & VTK 4.0.

thanks,
--Randy

You should be building ParaView with VTK 4.0.  When did you last update 
your checkout of ParaView?

No, no, my mistake, I now see that I downloaded a tarball rather than from CVS:
ParaView-0-2.tar.gz

I'll try to grab the CVS version.

ParaView from CVS goes with VTK from CVS (not the 4.0 release,
since we, unfortunately, couldn't introduce certain changes
to VTK before the branch). ParaView release 0.2 goes with a
CVS tag of VTK (ParaView-0-2). There is a tar file on the web.
Since you are an advanced VTK user, I recommend going with CVS.
This way, you'll have the latest ParaView and you won't need
a separate VTK.

Sorry, guess I haven't had enough coffee yet, but I'm still confused.

I just got the ParaView from CVS as described here:
http://public.kitware.com/ParaView/HTML/Download.html

 i.e., I did:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/cvsroot/ParaView login
(passwd: paraview)
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/cvsroot/ParaView co -r
ParaView-0-2 ParaView

then I cmake ParaView, setting VTK_BINARY_PATH to my CVS version of VTK.

However, when trying to compile ParaView, I still get the following:

/usr/local/home/heiland/ParaView/ParaView/vtkPVActorComposite.cxx: In method
`void vtkPVActorComposite::Initialize()':
/usr/local/home/heiland/ParaView/ParaView/vtkPVActorComposite.cxx:1221: no
matching function for call to `vtkPointData::GetActiveScalars ()'
/usr/local/home/heiland/ParaView/ParaView/vtkPVActorComposite.cxx:1231: no
matching function for call to `vtkCellData::GetActiveScalars ()'

Sure enough, my version of VTK/vtkPointData doesn't have GetActiveScalars.  So
am I using the wrong VTK or the wrong ParaView?

thanks,
--Randy

If you're using the ParaView-0-2 branch of ParaView, you also need to check 
out the same branch of VTK (cvs co -r ParaView-0-2 VTK).  If you want to 
use your current checkout of VTK, then do a cvs update -A in your ParaView 
directory to get the current version of ParaView rather than the branch.

Thanks Amy.  Your 'cvs update -A' reply did the trick.

Now, to cause more trouble... what is it about ParaView that requires Tcl/Tk
8.2.3?  I'd built VTK w/ Tcl 8.3 and so now when I try to run ParaView, get:

mason 464% ./ParaView
Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following directories:
    /ThisIsNotAPath/Tcl/lib/tcl8.2

/ThisIsNotAPath/Tcl/lib/tcl8.2/init.tcl: version conflict for package "Tcl":
have 8.3, need 8.2
version conflict for package "Tcl": have 8.3, need 8.2
    while executing
"package require -exact Tcl 8.2"
    (file "/ThisIsNotAPath/Tcl/lib/tcl8.2/init.tcl" line 4)
    invoked from within
"source /ThisIsNotAPath/Tcl/lib/tcl8.2/init.tcl"
    ("uplevel" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"uplevel #0 [list source $tclfile]"


This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.
 ...

----------

Is there any hope of using Tcl 8.3 with ParaView?

I've tried to flush whatever Tcl knowledge I used to have :), but fwiw, I have:
TCLLIBPATH=<pathto>/VTK/Wrapping/Tcl

thanks for any insight,

I added support for Tcl/Tk 8.3 to ParaView. There is an advanced build
option called HAVE_TCL8_3 which can be used to tell the build system
that ParaView will be linked against version 8.3. If you are changing this
for an already existing build, I recommend doing a make clean inside 
ParaView directory before running make again.

Woohoo!  Thanks Berk!  It works for me (after doing a cvs update for /ParaView,
I also had to cvs update /VTK/Parallel)!
