Dear Paraview users,

I solved the problem, by two step

1- I run the command "unlimit stacksize"
2- I have remove the /usr/lib64 in my LD_LIBRARY_PATH

the first step, I understand. but I could not understand
why paraview did not work if  I put /usr/lib64 in in my LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
Could be related X11 ????, I dont know.
But, paraview is now working :)

Thank you very much!!!

Have a good weekend.
Murat

Hi Eric,

Thank you for your advice.
The problem was fixed by turning BUILD_SHARED_LIBS on.

     triangle_strip_realdata2.vtk
     triangle_strip_realdata3.vtk
     ......
     triangle_strip_realdata201.vtk
 
I use paraview 3.2.1 under win vista. Can anyone help me please??

Hi Enkelejda,

> PostScript file using GL2PS. This is also very nice to have in Paraview,

In August 2007 I posted a patch for the ParaView 3.1.0 source tree adding vector 
postscript output to Paraview by means of GL2PS. There were no follow-ups to 
this post on the mailing list, I received a few reactions via personal e-mail. I 
assume the point of view of the ParaView developers is to not support vector 
postscript output as many things one can visualise with ParaView can simply not 
be exported to Postscript with GL2PS. I perfectly understand this argument, in 
particular as it prevents a lot of bug reports concerning the seemingly broken 
vector postscript support.

Nonetheless, I find vector postscript output very useful to have in ParaView 
(eps format requirements for publications). I ported my patch to the current 
development distribution (3.3.0, cvs version as of today, QT 4.3.4). It is less 
well integrated into the code than previously (as the export routines moved from 
Qt/Core/pqRenderView.cxx to Qt/Core/pqImageUtil.cxx since 3.1.0 and the patch 
still applies mainly to Qt/Core/pqRenderView.cxx), but it does the job.

It is not the Plugin approach you pursued, but I hope it helps.

It is probably a bit too perky to ask for, but it would be great if the patch 
would make it into the CVS repository, as then there would be a chance that 
someone with more VTK experience than me would keep it up to date, automatically 
would disable conflicting drawing options (e.g. "Interpolate Colors") and 
possibly even add some kind of error handling.

Hi Sven,

Actually, the "reasoning" behind us not including your patch is that
we have been busy. I suggest putting a feature request in the bug
tracker and attach the patch to it. When someone has some time, he can
test your patch and then make a decision on whether we want to support
postscript output or not. If I recall, gl2ps also supports svg and pdf
which is very nice.

Any news on this? Is anyone able to reproduce it, or is it just on my machine?

Let me know if you need more information.

I commented it out from Paraview3.2.1/VTK/Utilities/vtkzlib/zutil.h
but the errors are still there. Here is how they look:

1>c14n.c
1>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\stdio.h(358) :
error C3163: '_vsnprintf': attribute doesnt match the previous declaration
1>        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\stdio.h(350)

1>        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\stdio.h(350)
: please confirm the declaration of '_vsnprintf'

and so on with very meny .c files. The last errors say the library
vtklibxml2.lib was not found
8>linking...
8>LINK : fatal error LNK1104: could not open file 'vtklibxml2.lib'

this error comes many times. I think its because of the previous errors the
library vtklibxml2 could not be compiled so the problem is that
'_vsnprintf'.

Are there any other declarations of _vsnprintf I should delete ? Any other
things I should do ?

Thank you for your help,
Thomas

After all I managed to compile it. The solution is to remove the

# define vsnprintf _vsnprintf
from file:

.\ParaView3.2.1\VTK\Utilities\vtklibxml2\config_cmake.h.in

Thank you all for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] Using plugins compiled on Windows with an installed
	(not-compiled) Paraview. os-msvc msvc problem.
Message-ID: <e58876f00803030025k66d6a04agaa6d01736ba10e33@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
I have compiled Paraview on Windows following the instructions from page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install
and created a plugin which works perfectly when I load it with the compiled
by me version of ParaView.
But when I try to load it from the version that I downloaded from Paraview
page (the installer version, which means it was compiled somewhere else, not
on my computer) the following error comes up:

"The plugin uses incompatible Qt library. Expected build key <Windows msvc
release full-config>, got <Windows os-msvc release full-config>"

I have compiled Qt using option msvc so the prefix os- must have been added
automaticaly.
I am developing a plugin that will be used by many people and I want them to
be able to simply download the Paraview installer from the internet and open
my plugin with it. But because of this error its impossible.
What can I do ?
Is there any other possiblity to compile Qt so that the plugins created with
it work with pre-compiled version of Paraview ?

Thank you for your help,

Hi Sven,

thank you for your help.

I ported your patch for Paraview 3.2.1 and changed the files 
ParaViewCommon.cmake, pqMainWindowCore.cxx and pqRenderView.cxx. The 
last one you will find attached. In the method pqRenderView::saveImage() 
I just added a else if in the file suffix branch.

I compiled Paraview 3.2.1 and tried the GL2PSExporter for an example 
file. Whatever output file suffix I try, Paraview throws the message 
"save image failed". Actually it writes some output in the specified.ps 
or .eps, but the output is not complete. When I try .svg the output 
looks better, but the message still persists.

I don't know what are the differences between PV 3.3 and 3.2.1, maybe 
patching of more files it required... Any idea what would help?

Hi,

I am trying to configure for a build of paraview, but
only have Qt4.3 and ccmake errors on this stating that
Qt 4.2 is required.

Does the minior version change matter that much and if
not how can I force the compile to continue

cheers

Freddy

You can hack ParaView3/Qt/CMakeLists.txt to comment out the check.  Just look for the error message.  It's only a few lines in.

ParaView on CVS head will no longer compile with Qt 4.2. So even if you 
hack the CMakeLists.txt, you'll get compilation errors. You'll need to 
upgrade to Qt 4.3.

Yes, but I'm pretty sure Freddy is trying to compile ParaView 3.2.1, which is still set to require Qt 4.2.  The instructions were to use Qt 4.3 with that version of ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] byte order filter
Message-ID: <8e0b87a90803030758u4a036b25he4db57dda00e6cff@mail.gmail.com>

I am using the legacy binary VTK format to dump my image data. The data is
little endian, but Paraview (or rather the VTK readers I suppose) reads it
as a big one.

Instead of modifying the way image data is dumped (I am not linking against
VTK libraries, and am lazy (or too concerned with performance) to convert
the data) at run time, is it possible to instruct Paraview to flip the byte
order somehow with a filter?

If there is no such filter available, can I write a programmable one?

thanks
Levent

Hi

Is there any chance to get a 64 bit binary version of Paraview 3.2.1 for
WinXP/Vista x64 anywhere?

 

Still looking for an reload button,

Thanks for the heads up.. Using the information there I did get alot further

Currently, the compile works all the way to the final link step, and then I

The Legacy VTK Binary format requires that data be written in Big-Endian, so
if you write it in Little-endian format it will byte-flip it internally
(thinking it's Big-endian).

You'll need to swap it yourself before you write it into the File... So that
ParaView can swap it again when it reads it (I know, silly ain't it?)

Subject: [Paraview] Bug 6495: XDMF Reader Fails from Python
Message-ID: <47CC5675.5010505@psc.edu>

ParaView displays example data Test1.xmf file fine but the same steps yield a 
blank image in Python. See attached Python script.

I only tried these cases:
  - serial pvpython and MPI pvbatch
  - Test1.xmf and my own XDMF file with structured grids
  - making a cut normal to Z
  - 3.2.1 on CentOS 5

The same Python script works fine if using bluntfin.vts instead of the XDMF reader.

My XDMF file has 1 domain and 2 structured grids. After updating the pipeline 
the reader's list of domain and grid names is correct. However the 
servermanager's DataInformation class reports no cells, no points and no point 
array info. GetCompositeDataInformation reports that the number of groups is 0 
while it should be 2.

This is a major problem as I need to look at some very large datasets in batch 
for analysis and scaling tests.

All suggestions welcome!

Yes,

I have Qt4.3 and a relatively current download. My
question really was geared to find if there was a
reason to stay with 4.2 - seems not. thanks for the
tipo I will hack the check.

BTW I am compiling on a onyx2 under 6.5.22m anyone
else using SGIs for this.


Cheers

Hey Kent,

In python can you read the Test1.xmf okay, or is that showing the  
wrong info, too?

Running your cut rendering doesn't work for me, either, but I can at  
least see the correct info about Test1.xmf in the DataInformation.  
(ParaView CVS on OS X 10.5.2 serial).

Running:
=======
from paraview import servermanager

servermanager.Connect()

reader = servermanager.sources.XdmfReader()
reader.FileName = 'Test1.xmf'
reader.UpdatePipeline()

di = reader.GetDataInformation()
print "Number of Cells = %d" % di.DataInformation.GetNumberOfCells()
print "Number of Data Sets = %d" %  
di.DataInformation.GetNumberOfDataSets()

pd = di.DataInformation.GetPointDataInformation()
print "Number of Point Data Arrays = %d" % pd.GetNumberOfArrays()

pda1 = pd.GetArrayInformation(0)
print "Number of Tuples in first array = %d" % pda1.GetNumberOfTuples()
======

Gives me this output:
=======
python PVXdmfReaderTest1.py
vtkXdmfReader : [ ...........]
Number of Cells = 18
Number of Data Sets 1
Number of Point Data Arrays = 2
Number of Tuples in first array = 16

You're using the open source Qt, and ParaView binaries were built with the 
commercial edition.  The ParaView binaries should probably build against the 
open source edition instead, and might be good to do for the ParaView 3.4 
release.

You might be able to use the -buildkey parameter to Qt's configure to match 
the commercial edition of Qt that comes with ParaView.  Someone else has 
asked before, and this was the answer given, but I don't know if that person 
had success.

Also, be sure you're using the same compiler version.

Thank you very much for the test. I get different results but I'm using 3.2.1, 
not CVS, on Linux, not OS X:

===
vtkXdmfReader : [ ...........]
Number of Cells = 0
Number of Data Sets = 0
Number of Point Data Arrays = 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "eric.py", line 17, in ?
     print "Number of Tuples in first array = %d" % pda1.GetNumberOfTuples()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'GetNumberOfTuples'
===

Since your "di" is the result of "GetDataInformation" are you sure the request 
to, say, get the number of cells should be 
"di.DataInformation.GetNumberOfCells()" instead of just "di.GetNumberOfCells()" ?

I wouldn't mind upgrading to CVS but I'm not sure is worth it since making a 
simple cut still doesn't work.

My advice would be to wait. I have examples of our own data which read 
very well with Xdmf and PV3.2.2.

It is now broken in the CVS version. I still haven't figured out where 
and why.

I never thought using the commercial Qt would be an issue. I had the
commercial Qt on the machine I build the binaries and I used it. It
was not my intentions to make it hard to build plugins. I will use the
open-source Qt from now on.

There were a few bugs in ParaView exposed during the transition from Qt 4.2 to 
4.3, which have been fixed in CVS.  None we major, and you may not see them 
when using Qt 4.3 with ParaView 3.2.

It has been built with 7.4.2m before.

Hey Kent,

You should probably follow Jean's advice if he knows more about the  
reader status in CVS. I know I have some problems with it, like it  
crashes Python when trying to load a state file with an XdmfReader in  
it. (I checked the same state setup with the same Test1.xmf dataset  
saved as a vtkXMLUnstructuredGrid and it worked fine.)

In the meantime (at least with the CVS version):

1. Regarding your DataInformation question, I only knew to do  
di.DataInformation.GetNumberOfCells() because I was playing around in  
ipython, which is an interpreter which has tab-completion on commands.  
I find it *really* useful when I don't know what I'm doing (--too much  
of the time--) because I can do things like type "di.<tab>" and it  
shows me that GetNumberOfCells isn't one of the options, but if I type  
"di.DataInformation.<tab>" it shows me a bunch of options, including  
the # of cell info.

2. I was able to get your script to work by explicitly adding:  
cut.ContourValues = [0.0]

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Python Info Seems Wrong
Message-ID: <47CDC448.7070206@psc.edu>

The book strongly suggests using "dir" and "help" to learn about the Python 
options.The "help" command says

    "Please note that some of the methods accessible
    through the Proxy class are not listed by help()
    because the Proxy objects forward unresolved
    attributes to the underlying object.To get the
    full list, see also dir(proxy.SMProxy)."

So I used pvpython from 3.2.1 on CentOS 5 to run the following to see the full 
list:

===
from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect()
implFuncModule = servermanager._createModule( "implicit_functions" )
cutF = implFuncModule.Plane()
print dir(cutF.SMProxy)
help(cutF)
===

"dir" does not list any routines for getting or setting "Normal". I expected a 
"GetNormal" since there is a "GetOrigin".

Both "dir" and "help" describe "Offset" which doesn't exist in vtkPlane! That 
is, according to the documentation for the C++ class vtkPlane generate by 
Doxygen when I compliled from source.

Any ideas what is going on?

TIA!

Hi,

I'm writting c++ plugins for paraview, and I'm using ImplicitFunction 
properties.  I'd like to be able to interact with spheres as it is 
possible with planes (by moving an interactor in the view of instance...)
Is it possible with a c++ plugin ?

Thanks,

Yes it is possible to add 3d widgets from plugins.  I've added a specialized 
contour widget from a plugin.  I added a custom panel to use those 3d 
widgets.
You'll have to write both server and client side code, and I don't think there 
is a wiki to say how, so you can look at the pqCutPanel and 
pqImplicitPlaneWidet code in ParaView3/Qt/Components and start there.

do you happen to have QTDIR environment variable set? Or is the 4.2.3  
qmake in a path that is ahead of the 4.3.3 versions?

Just some thoughts.

I'll commit something in CVS in a few minute, so it doesn't pick up your Qt 
4.2.2 but gives you a chance to set Qt 4.3 before continuing, so you don't 
have to start again with a clean build directory.

I don't know of any reason to require 4.3.3 instead of 4.3.2 or 4.3.1.  I'll 
lower that requirement at the same time I fix this other issue.
Mac OS X ParaView builds should prefer 4.3.4 when it comes out, as there is a 
bug fix in that version.

Yeah, having Qt 4.3.3's qmake in the path first would prevent this error.

But in ParaView's CMakeLists.txt, we should check that and give the user a 
second chance to fix that without fixing their environment, or starting from 
a clean build directory again.

Anyway, its fixed in CVS now.

I didn't have all the information when I posted that. What is
happening is that I did the install and then put my plugin into the
"plugins" folder (which I made because I thought I needed it).
Launching paraview, paraview then looks in the plugins folder for
stuff to load. Problem is that the crt dlls are really one directory
up, and so the load fails.
  So to be clear, ParaView run without a problem. Loading a plugin
from the "plugins" directory did NOT work because of lack of crt dlls
at the same level as the plugin.

I confirmed this by moving the plugin to the bin directory, launchin
paraview, then manually loading the plugin. That worked just fine.
Unfortunately I really need to have the plugin loaded automatically so
I think I will just adjust the PV source to look in the bin directory
for the plugins.

Thanks Mike, Clint. I did not have QTDIR set and Qt 4.2.2 was first in 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. That path now has (in this order) Qt 4.3.4, 4.3.2 and 4.2.2 
and I wiped out the entire build directory.

I'm using both 3.2.1 and the CVS version. However, they seem to only check the 
*minimum* Qt version. Is there a *maximum* Qt version that should be used? If 
so is that requirement enforced by cmake? If not where do I look to see the 
maximum version?

Thanks!

Hi -

I'd like to know if its possible to set the attributes such as the 
thickness or color of a source object e.g. polyline with a Python script.

Thanks,

I've tried the ListProperties method. It has only two attributes:

 >>> src1.ListProperties()
['FileNames', 'TimestepValues']

 >>> for prop in src1:
...     print prop
...
Property name= FileNames value = ['D:/Data/Model.vtk']
Property name= TimestepValues value = []

Is there any other way to set the color and line thickness of a polyline?

If "src1" is the line itself then I think I see the problem.

The concept here is that a "shape" exists independently of the 
"representation" of the shape. Here, the shape is a line but it could be 
a surface, a solid, text, etc. Each shape has many representations and 
that is where the properties of line thickness and color come in. Take a 
look at the representation created for that line.

Yes, this is very easy to do in ParaView. Simply use the contour
filter, set the values at which you want contour values, and click
apply. That's it.

Do the contour values you specify fall within the range of your data?
If not, you won't get any contour lines.

One final question: how can I get a representation to appear in the 
pipeline browser stage so that I can subsequently manually change the 
attributes of the objects I've imported using a script.

Unsurprisingly, registering a proxy as a source crashes Paraview i.e.

     pm.RegisterProxy("sources", "myObject", proxy)     # d a n g e r

I think the "Scalars" keyword is doing nothing more than indicating which 
scalar is the default. In your case you have 2 scalars and so "Scalars" could 
be set to either one or not set at all. This also applies to the other keywords 
like "Vector" and also to cell data.

Most ParaView filters will, I think, initially use the default or, if not 
given, the first scalar. You can always select another scalar.

The documentation, in my opinion, explains this very poorly and never even uses 
the word "default".

The Contour filter can only create contours for one scalar variable at a time.

Have you tried using two instances of the Contour filter, each creating 
contours from one of your variables? Each instance should provide a popup menu 
that lists your two variables.

Please also mention the version of ParaView and the OS you are using.

I generally register my items this way:
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()

sphere = servermanager.sources.SphereSource(registrationGroup='sources', 
registrationName='sphere') 
dataDisplay = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(sphere, view, 
registrationGroup='representations')

You now should have a sphere in the pipeline browser called sphere that 
you can manually change.
Think of the sphere object as Properties panel, and the representation 
object as the display panel of your pipeline browser

Sorry, I don't understand: does that work? Can you display the contours for

I assume you mean merging the GUI widgets showing the cell arrays?
There's a couple ways to do this.

Merge them at the level of your vtkObject by adding another set of properties.  
Then only expose that with your server manager XML, and the GUI can show 
that.

Or, you can write your own panel and give your pqTreeWidget with the merged 
arrays a name different than any server manager property name, and connect it 
yourself like its done in 
pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel::linkServerManagerProperties().

Your second case below worked for me. That is, it seems that "Scalars" is 
required. I could color your 2D square by either scalar.

One warning: in the CVS version of 3.3 a new "Representation" is used by 
default that is named "Slice". I don't know what this does but the result looks 
wrong. Switch it to "Surface" and it looks right.

I also used "Contour" to draw contour lines for either variable. If you wanted 
to see contours from both variables at the same time just use two instances of 
Contour and select different variables.

Let us know if you get it to work. And mention your version of PV and OS.

You're right, that's not very helpful. You need to go to the ultimate source of 
information: the C++ code. Often the author will include comments that are not 
picked up by Doxygen and so are not in the documentation. You probably won't 
need to look for long before you can tell what is happening when that flag is set.

Hi,

I have the most current version of vtk installed and
compiled, however the VTK subdirectory is throwing
lots of template error (surprise under a mips
compiler?).

Any way that vtk paraview can use my vtk install, but
no current Utilities/Materials subdir of the vtk build
tree?

Cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Assigning string labels to datasets?
Message-ID: <20080307.192951.208967814.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

As I play with the new composite dataset structures, I came to think
it would indeed be nice if ParaView3 can handle datasets with string
labels ("Porous Material," "Air," ... , rather than "DataSet 0,"
"DataSet 1," ...). I mean, for example, VTK/IO/vtkEnsight6Reader.cxx
has a fragment of code to assign its output a string label.

  vtkCharArray* nmArray = vtkCharArray::New();
  nmArray->SetName("Name");
  size_t len = strlen(name);
  nmArray->SetNumberOfTuples(static_cast<vtkIdType>(len)+1);
  char* copy = nmArray->GetPointer(0);
  memcpy(copy, name, len);
  copy[len] = '\0';
  output->GetFieldData()->AddArray(nmArray);
  nmArray->Delete();

I can do the same thing to each member dataset in a MultiBlockDataSet,
but it doesn't seem there's a way to display the labels in
ParaView. However if I rewrite the code a bit for Information tab of
Object Inspector (of the CVS head)

I can see the string labels in addition to dataset numbers. Searching
the list archives of ParaView and VTK I found several similar
discussions held in the past. The modifications above are just
concepts, not ment to be applied to the real source, but would things
like this be an option?

No. We do not support any VTK other than the one included in paraview.

Hi, I am currently working on a specific need where I need to attribute 
Point Data to a subset of my Point <DataArray>.
For instance out of a list of 100000 points I only have Pressure Value 
for a 90000 points. Is it something that vtu can manage ?

You can download it from Trolltech. They now support Visual Studio in

It should work client/server.  Try updating your video drivers on the server.  Try  turning off the Remote Render Threshold checkbox (found under Prefrerences/ Server).

Hi Robert,

I've confirmed that the latest CVS resolved the problem on PPC Mac.
Thank you for your advice.

I'm confortable with the situation, but it would still be convenient
if "Opacity" in the color scale editor could work. I just wonder when
"Opacity" in the color scale editor is available .... Could anyone
give me information about that?

Thanks for the tips, Scott. But the problem's not gone.

When I exit Paraview, I see a message, saying "MPI Application rank 0 
exited before MPI_Init() with status 0". Does that give you a clue to 
identify the problem.

The example XDMF file, Test1.xmf, uses an unstructured grid. I'm working with 
an XDMF file using a structured grid. Both could be read in 3.2.1 but only the 
unstructured grid can be read the the CVS version as of this morning. I'd be 
happy to work with whoever is making the `improvements' in this reader to get 
the structured case to work again.

Message-ID: <cffaa6b90803110123h50e7dd9ap98d62bb61147e69d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have a problem applying the Glyph filter using Python scripting.
When running the script shown below (taken from Servermanager2.pdf,
slightly modified), the glyphs are shown correctly but the Output
Messages Window appears saying: "Selected proxy value not in the list:
 2D Glyph". Also the "Glyph Type" selection box is empty thus making
it impossible to change the glyph type using the GUI.

Am I doing something wrong here, or is this a bug?

I have tried on both PV3.2.1 (compiled from source) and 3.3cvs on OpenSUSE 10.3.

Thank you for you time.

regards,
Sylvester


view = servermanager.GetRenderView()

sphere = servermanager.sources.SphereSource(registrationGroup="sources",registrationName="sphere")
repSphere = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(sphere,view,registrationGroup='representations')

elev = servermanager.filters.ElevationFilter(Input=sphere,registrationGroup="sources",registrationName="elev")
repElev = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(elev,view,registrationGroup='representations')

source = servermanager.sources.GlyphSource2D(GlyphType=8)
glyph = servermanager.filters.Glyph(Input=elev,

Message-ID: <d50899c30803110348y777cecd3iab3af4e0a014bd22@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to plot simple labels to identify point locations.

1) online I found an interesting manual (Draft paravie manual),
unfortunately uncredited, which on page 63 shows a "label point id"
that I can't locate on the Paraview version I am using (3.2.1 on
Windows)

2) normally, I am creating VTK data for visualisation via Paraview
from GRASS, but it seems tha the VTK output does not export text
labels.
could you recommend  any other procedure to generate VTK points with
labels from an (x,y,z,label) file (any scripting environment will be
fine)

TIA for any feedback, and regards,

Andrea

Labels for point and cell Id are currently available on the CVS head, 
and should be included in 3.4 I presume.

They might be in 3.2.1, to test you need to select a group of 
cells/points with one of the selection controls (Select Cells on, Select 
Points on, ...).  Then you would have to open the View->Selection 
Inspector. Once there scroll down to the Display Style section.

Hi everyone,

I have run into a weird problem with Paraview and can not get a solution 
from the mailing list. Does anyone know how to debug Paraview? Does 
Paraview spit out log file?

The problem I have is missing polygon from rendering when paraview run in 
client/server mode. This problem happens even if I run one pvserver.

No abnormal message has been seen until we exit Paraview --- "MPI 
Application rank 0 exited before MPI_Init() with status 0"

Hi Kenneth,

Yes, I did. But I got it working before... Anyway, I will try not using 
mpirun to run paraview. Thanks for the tip.

I have tried to run paraview not in mpirun. Although it doesn't solve the 
problem, at least it gets rid of the error message "MPI Application rank 0 
exited before MPI_Init() with status 0".

Why do you want to avoid the warning? It is harmless.

What you want to avoid is the *error* "ld: bl out of range".

Try turning off the "Use offscreen rendering for screenshots" option
on the Options->Render View panel.

I think the answer to your question is YES. I am running Paraview on HP's 
SVA cluster. The paraview client (paraview) is running on one of the 
display nodes of the cluster.

I lauch paraview through a script called sva_paraview.sh, which does job 
scheduling, allocating nodes, starting X servers besides mpirun-ing 
pvserver-s.

Actually, I think the answer is no.  If you want to see the image in the GUI window, then the answer is no.  Get rid of the -tdx and -tdy flags.

Those options are in CVS head, not in any release yet.

One more problems remains --- volume rendering doesn't work. I can only 
see the outline of the volume when switching to "volume" in Representation 
in the Display tab. Is this because IceT only supports sort-last image 
compositing, which can not handle opacity?

I am guessing you are rendering on the client side. Go to Edit|Settings 
dialog. Then on the "Server" tab enable  "Remote Render Threshold" and 
change it to 0. Now, rendering will happen on the server side and you 
should see your volume correctly rendered. Delivering volume data to 
client and volume rendering is not supported.

I am trying to update a set of filters/readers from PV 2.6.x to PV 3  
CVS and it seems that the vtkMultiGroupDataSet class is not around  
any more? What would be the replacement for that class?

Doing a "find . -type f -name "vtkMultiGroupDataSet*" " in the  
paraview cvs source tree didn't seem to turn anything up.

Hello,

Please forgive me for having so many questions today!

Where can I find timing information about rendering performance? I'm gonna 
analyze the rendering times of a large dataset vs number of rendering 
nodes on our cluster.

Tools -> Timer Log.  It will tell you how much time was spent in still and interactive renders.

vtMutliGroupDataSet has been deprecated. Please refer to the following 
Wiki for details:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Composite_Data_Redesign

Generally, the replacement for vtkMultiGroupDataSet would be 
vtkMultiBlockDataSet, but it depends on your application: whether the 
data is AMR or not.

You probably want vtkMultiBlockDataSet or its superclass vtkCompositeDataSet if you are agnostic about the meaning of the group.

Message-ID: <8e0b87a90803120937u35f67220j81edf5f4eaa3a0c2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

A simple, beginner's question:

I have an image data with non-zero origin and different than 1
spacings in each direction. When I use ExtractGrid filter, this
location/size information is lost and the extracted portion of data is
shown with index coordinates. I have to use Display>Transformation to
make it appear correctly sized and positioned, and well, it is not so
convenient at best..

Is there an extract filter that keeps this dimensionality intact? Or
how can I write one?

thanks
Levent

Subject: [Paraview] How to grab and move a points (GUI)?
Message-ID: <47D80A08.7090304@cam.ac.uk>

Hello all,

I am developping a FFD (free-form deformation) plugin for paraview. In
2D (resp. 3D), I need to move the control points, which correspond to
the vertices of a regular cartesian grid in the plan (resp. in the
space) by using a GUI. I guess I should be able to use paraview's GUI
to do so since we can grab and move the centre of gravity of the cutting
plane but I don't know neither what to do nor where to start.

- Has anyone done this before?
- If not, please, could you give me the best way to do it?

Best Regards
Boris Clemencon

vtkPolyData is limited to sets of points, lines, and planar polygons.
vtkUnstructuredGrid has tetrahedra etc in addition to the above.

"ImplicitSphereRepresentation" can't be created by Paraview. It seems to 
be due to the server side "vtkSMImplicitSphere..." classes which can't 
be instanciated...

How can those server manager classes (present in my server side plug in) 
be recognized and instanciated by Paraview ?

Thanks...

I am going to start experimenting with client/server where the server
is 64 bit (compiled without GUI) as soon as I get a copy of Leopard

Subject: [Paraview] PlotOverLine bug?
Message-ID: <1205443834.6556.22.camel@aaragon-laptop>

Hello everyone,

I just subscribed to the mailing list to find out if the problem I'm
experiencing is just a bug in the new release of Paraview. I solved a
very simple problem for the temperature field using a matching finite
element mesh. This is actually a 1D solution on a 2D mesh using
triangles. The solution to this toy problem is a bilinear curve and
everything shows up correctly in Paraview, except for the PlotOverLine
filter. Close to the kink, the filter creates a constant temperature
region which is wrong.

I attached the file that I used on Paraview v3.2.1.

I appreciate any comments on this problem. Thank you,

Alejandro M. Arag?n

You have what seems to be degenerate triangles in the middle. I think
that is what is throwing the interpolation off. Are those there on
purpose?

Those are not degenerate triangles, just linear elements. The
temperature field has a kink because there is a horizontal line heat
source at the center of the domain.

a?

That's what is causing the interpolation error. It is a bug. I
reported it in the VTK bug tracker:

Do you have blocks that overlap in space?

Yes, since the datasets >= 1 are surface representations of dataset 0,
each surface dataset and the corresponding surface part of dataset 0
share the same surface points. i. e. Each surface has its own
vtkPoints, but the point coordinates are exactly the same as the
surface points of the dataset 0.

The problem is that all blocks in the mutliblock dataset are being 
sliced resulting in overlapping slices and hence the shuffling colors. 
To see that all the blocks are indeed being sliced, change the 
representation style of the "Slice" filter to "Outline"; you should see 
the outline for the blocks in the sliced output.

It is not possible to choose which block to slice for a slice filter. 
The way to slice only the volume data is exactly what you've done, use 
the extract block filter to extract the block and then slice it.

Thanks indeed for the suggestion. I'm clearly slicing overlapped
datasets so the extract block filter will be a good friend...

Hi,

I just tried to compile ParaView3 (cvs) but it fails because

VTK/Utilities/CMakeLists.txt:41

Comment out line 41 results in errors while compiling VTK

Can someone with cvs-write access please add the "EncodeString" directory(?)

I have no problems running pvbatch on a system with no X server. I link 
paraview to Mesa and use off screen rendering. You are using a very, very old 
version of Paraview (2.4). You need to upgrade to 3.2.1.

Instructions for compiling ParaView with OSMesa, which allows you to use pvbatch without an X server are available on the Wiki:

  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#OSMesa_support

Note that if you upgrade (and I suggest you do if you can) that there is a major shift in the scripting.  ParaView moved from Tcl scripting to Python scripting.  This means your current script won't work with ParaView 3.2.1.  Unfortunately, ParaView does not currently have the ability to write out a script to get to its current state, although it is fairly easy to write a few lines of script to load a state file.  Either way, you will need to review the ParaView scripting document, which is also posted to the Wiki.

Subject: [Paraview] EnSight gold Paraview problem
Message-ID: <69E82C655BA624438EC192FB2D5B54DBB92D2F@GLKMS2100.GREENLNK.NET>


Hi,

I've been having a problem with Paraview and I was wondering if any of
you could help me.

Essentially I'm trying to read EnSight gold files into paraview. Smaller
files work fine but larger ones cause paraview to crash so drastically
it brings down the computer.

What happens is that I load the file, click apply then wait for a moment
while paraview tries to display it. Paraview will either show the file
correctly for a few seconds then crash or crash imedietly before showing
anything.

When it does crash the screen goes compleatly blank. After a few seconds
the mouse apperes and shows the 'working' symbol, then it goes blank
again. This cycle continues indefinitely until I turn the power off.

When i start paraview i get this error...

libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5a

... but paraview starts fine despite that. I do not know whether that
error is connected to the problem.

The kind of sizes I'm talking about is around 170000 nodes, 86000 cells.
I'm using paraview 3.3 on fedora linux.

If you could help that would be really great.

Thank you.

Can you share any of these files with the paraview developers? If yes,
I can send you a link to where you can upload them.

Subject: [Paraview] writing storage-efficient .vtu files
Message-ID: <1205777968.5542.8.camel@aaragon-laptop>

Hi everyone,

I've been working with Paraview for a while and I thought that it was
time to move from ascii to a more storage-efficient format. I've been
reading some of the posts in the mailing list but I couldn't find any C
++ sample code to follow in order to create the unstructured grid file.
I would like to know if there is a huge difference between the size of
an ascii file and the inline ascii-base64 file. Also, the difference in
size when comparing with compressed files.

Writing .vtu files in ascii is straightforward, and I wrote my own code
for that but I believe that I'm repeating the functionality found in the
VTK toolkit. On the other half, the VTK toolkit may not be found in some
of the machines where I will run my code, so that limits the
portability.

Can anyone point me in the right direction to create storage-efficient
unstructured grid files so that they can be read without any problems in
Paraview?

Thanks in advance,

a?

Message-ID: <47DED2AF.4080804@email.it>

Hi everybody,
Im a newbie using paraview...
I want to rotate the reference system for a cloud of points, is it 
possible to do that in a visual (drag & drop) way?? what filter can i use??
what i need is to rotate the points for making parallels a planar 
geometry visible in the clouds (materialized using a plane) and a 
horizontal plane (the two planes are drawed using the plane filter)...
after i want to export the new coordinates for the points for importing 
in octave (mathlab) to do calculations... how should i do?
Any suggestions?
Thanks a lot

The book's examples of Python animation end many lines with ";" but I think's

pvbatch fails in the same way.

you can avoid this error by prefixing with the name servermanager, i.e.

scene = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()

Hi,

I'm having this problem too, also on other platforms (OS X,
Linux). I've used Qt-4.2 as the workaround but the recent change to
enforce Qt 4.3 made it invalid. Can anyone give us a suggestion?

big as 35 MB, and I have lots of time steps (which means many
individual 35 MB files).

This functionality can be found in the following files, in the VTK/IO 
directory

vtkXMLWriterC.cxx
vtkXMLWriterC.h
vtkXMLWriterF.h

you're right here too. Production machines would usually have HDF5 
around. Your IO module would be more portable with HDF5, and you could 
still read it in in ParaView with the Xdmf layer. Note that currently, 
some Xdmf stuff is broken in the the ParaView CVS. Stick to an earlier 
version to test.

You can use Paraview itself (via File->Save Data) to convert your ascii 
files to these formats.

It just looks like when the person was writing the example they had 
previously imported
everything under servermanager into the python namespace.

if you had changed the import line to:
  from paraviw.servermanager import *
the example most likely would have worked.

You have to create different animation cues for each index of the vector.

So in the example:
cue.AnimatedElement = 1

will animate the "Y" value of the sphere's center.

Subject: [Paraview] Python Cut Problems
Message-ID: <47E15F08.3030005@psc.edu>

I cannot seem to get the cut function to work and came up with the simplest test case I could imagine:

======
from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect()
implFuncModule = servermanager._createModule( "implicit_functions" )
sphere = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
sphere.Radius = 1.0
sphere.Center = ( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 )
cutFunc = implFuncModule.Plane()
cutFunc.Normal = ( 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 )
cutFunc.Origin = ( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 )
cut = servermanager.filters.Cut( Input=sphere, CutFunction=cutFunc )
cut.ContourValues = [ 0.0 ]
view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
if( raw_input("Enter 0/1 for cut/sphere: ") == "0" ):
    repr = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( cut, view )
else:
    repr = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( sphere, view )
view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
reply = raw_input("Do you have a dead parrot? ")
======

The sphere always appears; the cut never does. I'm using pvpython 3.2.1 on CentOS 5. I hope someone can spot what I am doing wrong.

Hi,

on line 92 of vtkSMPQStateLoader.cxx is the line

  if(find(begin,end,renderView) == end)

what class does this find belong as the compile is
throwing errors.

Cheers

Hi Kent,

Can it be that the cut is showing, but is not visible to you because you are
looking at it head on?
When I slightly modify your code (cutFunc.Normal) to the version shown
below, I can see just a sliver of the cut (using pvpython on OpenSUSE 10.3).


Regards,
Sylvester

from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect()
view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
sphere = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
sphere.Radius = 1.0
sphere.Center = ( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 )
repr1 = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( sphere, view )
implFuncModule = servermanager._createModule( "implicit_functions" )
cutFunc = implFuncModule.Plane()
cutFunc.Normal = ( 0.0, 1.0, 1.0 )
cutFunc.Origin = ( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 )
cut = servermanager.filters.Cut( Input=sphere, CutFunction=cutFunc )
cut.ContourValues = [ 0.0 ]
repr2 = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( cut, view )
repr1.Visibility = 0
view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()

Yes there are some I can upload. Can you give me the link? Thanks.

By the way I managed to get rid of the 

...libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5a

Error message but paraview still crashes so I guess it was unrelated.

I suggest updating to the current cvs first. If it is still crashing,
it is worth tracking this down because all those changes are already
in paraview (as of 2 weeks ago). If this is still happening on cvs, it
would be very useful if you could provide an example dataset.

The way composite data is stored is also subject to upcoming changes (see http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Composite_Data_Redesign). I think that both will greatly affect the EnSight (and all other) readers, so my question is whether it does make sense to put an effort on solving that bug #6003 with the current code. If these VTK changes make their way into ParaView soon and the new logic eliminates this bug, I would rather not spend my time working on code that will soon be deprecated. What do you say?

Subject: [Paraview] problem with Glyph filter using Python scripting

Hello Sylvester/Roland,

Oepn at Servers/ServerManager/filters.xml and look at the xml for the 
"Glyph" filter. You'll notice that the "Source" property has a domain 
named "proxy_list" which lists the names of the proxy types the GUI can 
allow the user to choose. When the glyph filter is created by the GUI, 
the GUI iterates over all these types, create new proxy instances for 
each and adds then to the domain using 
"vtkSMProxyListDomain::AddProxy()". The panel the simply goes through 
the list and shows them in the "Glyph Type" combo box.

So here the fix your python script:

...

source = servermanager.sources.GlyphSource2D(GlyphType=8)
glyph = servermanager.filters.Glyph(Input=elev,
Source=source,registrationGroup="sources",registrationName="glyph")
sourceProperty = glyph.GetProperty("Source")
domain = sourceProperty.GetDomain("proxy_list");
domain.AddProxy(source.SMProxy)

...

Try this:
Change the background color to something not-black, say blue,  and then 
play with the clip plane normal. Do you still get the depth issues?

Thanks! With a blue background I can tell where the the cut (a circle made from lines) is located at all times.

But since a line has no surface hence no surface normal it seems it should not be interacting with the light and should stay its given color (white) at all angles. Is there some valid reason the white line turns black?

If you save the output of the Cut filter into an ASCII vtp file or 
something, you'll notice that it saves out normals. The filters passes 
the normals from the input to the output, hence each line has associated 
normals.

One way to fix this is change the Representation to wireframe. In this 
more, lighting is disabled and hence there won't be any interference.

I keep getting the same behaviour - when saving in any format except 
pdf, a popup window appears with bunch of:

X Error: GLXBadContext 155
   Extension:    144 (Uknown extension)
   Minor opcode: 5 (Unknown request)
   Resource id:  0x4c01ff3

The file is saved, but is all black.

I use Gentoo, with Intel I810 graphics, paraview 3.2.1 official binary, 
xorg-x11-7.2.

Is this only Intel graphics related? Has anyone found a solution?

Message-ID: <43a689850803211039y1d56d1d4je62ead75465a3b6e@mail.gmail.com>

While working with a rather large data set (5GB) I cam across a bug in
the vtkImageData.cxx file.

In the void vtkImageData::AllocateScalars(); method the following
should be used:

  vtkIdType extent[6] ={ this->Extent[0], this->Extent[1], this->Extent[2],
                         this->Extent[3], this->Extent[4], this->Extent[5]};

instead of
  const int* extent = this->Extent;

The second version will lead to over flow errors if the extents are
large enough. (1800x1800x1800 in our case).

Should I file a bug or can someone with cvs access get this reviewed
and committed to cvs.

I was using the vtk from the ParaView CVS Head when i found the bug.

Message-ID: <47E408A5.80902@psc.edu>

Can an animated parameter be displayed? Something like "Annotate Time" but connected to an animated parameter instead of time.

Could it be done using pvpython or pvbatch?

Hmmm, very interesting; it could be done using python.
Here a plan:

* create a simple "Text" source proxy.
* add observer to the animated properties vtkCommand::ModifiedEvent.
* in the call-back, change the text of the text source proxy to match 
the value of the property.

A caveat: python event-observers/callbacks don't work in python shell in 
the paraview GUI. However, should work fine with pvpython/pvbatch.

Message-ID: <47E42F35.40302@psc.edu>

demo4 in servermanager.py works great when run from pvpython. It calls AnimateReader with no 3rd argument, the output filename, and so displays on the screen.

When the filename is provided it produces 1 to 5 frames (which look fine) then crashes. One unexpected phenomena was that when recording frames it seemed to display and then delete the window with every frame.

The debugger shows that it crashes in /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1 but there are no symbols for the other routines in the traceback even though I compiled with the debug flag on.

I'm using ParaView 3.2.1 on CentOS 5. The disk has over 59 GB of space.

Help!

Subject: [Paraview] Possible bug in vtkFunctionParser?
Message-ID: <20080322.144117.01376862.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I have a dataset which contains an array with the name say "A/B,"
which in turn contains a character that may be interpreted as a
mathematical operator '/'. If I try to run Filter->Calculator and to
evaluate an expression "A/B + A/B" over the dataset, I can't get the
expected result (an array with all components doubled).

I'm not sure this should be called as a bug since the array name is
itself confusing, but anyway what I found out was that finding the
first occurrence of the array name within the given expression is not
enough in vtkFunctionParser::OperatorWithinVariable(). I think at
least the array name should be searched until the location of idx even
if there was an occurrence prior to the location.

Here I attach a patch that worked for me. I know this is far from
perfect as a fix (there are still many possible cases that can't be
properly detected). Please take it just as a clarification of a
solution that worked for me.

Regards,
Takuya

I see exactly the same thing as Kent. I have tried, and retried many
times for the last 4 days and I get a crash after 3 or 4 frames written
to disk. I use the CVS version of ParaView3.

Can you try this:

view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0

This will turn off the using of offscreen buffers for writing the 
images. I am wondering if that's what's causing the problem.

Thanks! With your change pvpython makes more frames but still crashed before it completed. Same result with pvbatch. These tests were run with 3.2.1 on a serial 32-bit Linux system.

On a 64-bit parallel system where I liked to Mesa the serial version of pvpython ran without trouble with and without your change.

Anyone have any ideas? The method is question is a templated method
and I am not understanding what an "NType" is supposed to represent.

Our data is read from a custom data file which contains multiple time  
steps of unstructured grid data. We also produce from the data file  
an outline of the data. (the outline is needed because the data comes  
from a internal rotated coordinate system). So basically for any  
given timestep I will have 1 unstructed grid and one polydata object.
   Any suggestions on which of the new classes would be best to use?

Filters/Readers/Sources primarily have two choices:
* vtkMultiBlockDataSet
* vtkHierarhicalBoxDataSet

For any dataset comprising of unstructured grids, vtkMutliBlockDataSet 
is the way to go. vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet can only be used for AMR data.

A further, perhaps useless tidbit on this issue.

Skipping the animator and creating my own animation loop works everywhere. I record each frame with view.WriteImage. That crashed too after a few frames, like the animator, until I preceeded it with a call to view.StillRender.

By "everywhere" I actually mean only 3.2.1 on CentOS 5 systems, using pvpython and pvbatch, using OpenGL/hardware and Mesa.

Thanks.. Looks like I am going to use the vtkMultiBlockDataSet as the  
basis for my data.

I am writing a custom reader in ParaView 3(CVS HEAD) and I have  
started the porting process of the old code. One of the first things  
that I hit was this bit of code:

   vtkMultiGroupDataInformation* groupInfo =  
vtkMultiGroupDataInformation::New();
   groupInfo->SetNumberOfGroups(2);   // Assuming you have 2 members
   vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
   outInfo->Set(vtkCompositeDataPipeline::COMPOSITE_DATA_INFORMATION 
(), groupInfo);
   outInfo->Set 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), 1);
   groupInfo->Delete();

Is there a substitute for this or is this code even needed anymore?

It's not needed anymore. If you are associating any meta-data with any 
mode in the multiblock dataset, simply use 
vtkCompositeDataSet::GetMetaData() to obtain the vtkInformation in which 
you can store the meta-data for that node.

Here's the test case (3.2.1 on CentOS 5);

===
servermanager.Connect()
view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
sphere = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
sphereRep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( sphere, view )
text = servermanager.sources.TextSource()
text.Text = "Hello World"

view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
raw_input("Exit: ")

and here is the first part from running this from pvpython:

===

Subject: [Paraview] paraview and off_screen rendering or mesa

Check out this page: http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

In summary, you don't need mangled mesa but mesa with OSMesa support.
I recommend building 2 paraviews. One with regular OpenGL -> use as
client. One with Mesa with OS support -> use as server.

Kent,

I've just commited a fix to the CVS (patch for the same is also attached).

With this fix, you can optionally  specify which representation proxy to 
create for the source.

Hence for text source the script will become:
...
 > text = servermanager.sources.TextSource()
 > text.Text = "Hello World"
 > textRep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( text, view, \
        proxyName="TextSourceRepresentation")
 > view.StillRender()
...

Subject: [Paraview] Time based, MultiBlock data set
Message-ID: <63A23527-2E92-4AB8-BCA0-EDD865DBCE6C@gmail.com>

I am porting a custom reader from PV 2.6 to PV 3.cvs-head and I need  
to catch up on the "Time" support.

Basically our file has our data with a varying number of timesteps.  
Everything worked just fine in PV 2.6 but now with PV 3.x I am not  
sure what I really need to have in my PVSM file? I used to have:

   <SourceProxy name="PrdsMultiBlockDislocationReader"
                class="vtkPrdsMultiBlockDislocationReader">
      <StringVectorProperty
         name="FileName"
         command="SetFileName"
         number_of_elements="1">
         <StringListDomain name="files"/>
      </StringVectorProperty>

      <IntVectorProperty
         name="TimeStep"
         command="SetTimeStep"
         number_of_elements="1"
         animateable="1"
         default_values="0"
         information_property="TimestepValues">

        <IntRangeDomain name="range">
           <RequiredProperties>
              <Property name="TimeStepRangeInfo" function="Range"/>
           </RequiredProperties>
        </IntRangeDomain>
      </IntVectorProperty>

      <IntVectorProperty
         name="TimeStepRangeInfo"
         command="GetTimeStepRange"
         information_only="1">
         <SimpleIntInformationHelper/>
      </IntVectorProperty>

      <DoubleVectorProperty
         name="TimestepValues"
         information_only="1">
         <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>
    </SourceProxy>

But I am not sure that I need all of that because I believe I should  
be reacting to the timestep that is requested through the pipeline.

My current code looks like this:

   int tsLength = outInfo->Length 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
   double* steps = outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
   // Check if a particular time was requested.
   if(outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS 
()))
   {
     // Get the requested time step. We only supprt requests of a  
single time
     // step in this reader right now
     double *requestedTimeSteps = outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS());
     this->TimeValue = requestedTimeSteps[0];

     // find the first time value larger than requested time value
     // this logic could be improved
     int cnt = 0;
     while (cnt < tsLength-1 && steps[cnt] < this->TimeValue)
       {
       cnt++;
       }
     this->ActualTimeStep = cnt;
   }

   if (this->ActualTimeStep >= this->TimeStepRange[0] && this- 
 >ActualTimeStep <= this->TimeStepRange[1]) {
     vtkSmartPointer<DislocationReader> reader =  
vtkSmartPointer<DislocationReader>::New();
     reader->SetFileName(this->FileName);
     reader->SetTimeStep(this->ActualTimeStep);
     //reader->SetInformationVector(outputVector);
     reader->SetFileOffsets(this->FileOffsets);
     reader->read();
     vtkUnstructuredGrid* grid;
     grid = reader->GetDislocations();
     mb->SetBlock(0, grid);    // Group #0, dataset #i
     grid = reader->GetSimulationBox();
     mb->SetBlock(1, grid);
   } else {
       std::cout << "vtkPrdsMultiBlockDislocationReader: Timestep was  
out of Range: " << this->ActualTimeStep << std::endl;
       std::cout << "vtkPrdsMultiBlockDislocationReader: Timestep  
Range:" << this->TimeStepRange[0] << " -> " << this->TimeStepRange[1]  
<< std::endl;
       return 0;
   }

Is there an example of a reader that supports "time" that I could  
look at to try and figure out what I need to do to get my code to  
work correctly?

Thanks

Is the below still necessary with PV3 cvs head?
I have some custom filters that are not showing up in ParaView3 no  
matter what I do/delete/rebuild.

Thanks for any help

Great. I have things generally working. I would like my users to use  
the "Extract Block" filter to extract certain portions of the  
dataset, but when I select that I see a list of blocks labeled "Block  
0, Block 1". What do I have to set in order to get something more  
"human understandable" in that list? Something like:
   Simulation Limits
   Dislocation Data

This is not implemented yet. It is on our short-term list. Check back
in a few weeks.

Subject: [Paraview] PARAVIEW LICENSE CHANGE TO BSD LICENSE
Message-ID: <45d654b0803250727q4257af23s534dfe92b0ae53e6@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaView Users,

Starting with ParaView 3.4, ParaView will be distributed
under the new-and-simplified BSD License approved by the Open
Source Initiative (OSI).

As you probably know, the OSI (http://www.opensource.org/) is
the community-recognized body for reviewing and approving
licenses as conformant with the "Open Source Definition":

           http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd

As the label of "Open Source" gains more and more positive
reputation, it is important to define very well what the label
means, and when is that the label can be applied to specific
software packages.

The de-facto definition of Open Source today is:

    "to be distributed under an OSI-approved license"

The previous license of ParaView, was a modified version of the
traditional BSD license and as such, it was not an OSI-approved
license.

The new ParaView BSD license and the previous ParaView license differ
only in one of the terms. The previous license has four terms
(or conditions) while the new BSD license has only three.


The terms of the previous license read:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

 * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

 * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
   and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

 * Neither name of Kitware nor the names
   of any contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived
   from this software without specific prior written permission.

 * Modified source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
   misrepresented as being the original software.

------------------------------------------------------------------

==================================================================


The terms of the new BSD license read:
------------------------------------------------------------------

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions
are met:

    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above
      copyright notice, this list of conditions and the
      following disclaimer.

    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above
      copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following
      disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided
      with the distribution.

    * Neither the name of Kitware
      nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote
      products derived from this software without specific prior written
      permission.

------------------------------------------------------------------


The difference between the two licenses is in the fourth
term of the previous license:

 * Modified source versions must be plainly marked as such, and
   must not be  misrepresented as being the original software.


The license change is therefore equivalent to removing one term
(or condition) and therefore the new license is "more open" (in
the sense that it is less restrictive and impose less conditions
on the recipients of the source code) than the previous license.

We hope that this license change will benefit the great community
of ParaView users, and that it will simplify their continued adoption
of the toolkit for research, education and commercial endeavors.

We strongly encourage you, as users of Open Source software to
pay close attention to the licenses of all software (and any other
copyrighted material) that you adopt, to make sure that it conforms
to the expectations of the "Open source" label, as defined by the
Open Source Initiative:

               http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd


Note that previous versions of ParaView  are still distributed under the
previous ParaView license.


Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions
or concerns regarding the change of the ParaView License.


    Regards,

-berk

On my laptop with an ati graphics there is no problem. It really seems 
intel graphics related. It also seems that no one of the paraview 
developers has it to try it out, bad luck...

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Filter Panel Not loading in PV3 CVS
Message-ID: <195120E2-DD7A-4DF4-96E4-8D50195A904C@gmail.com>

I am writing a custom panel for my filter. I am deriving from  
pqLoadedFormPanel. I have created the .ui file in QtDesigner and  
created the xml files for SM and Client side. Everything compiles and  
I manually load the plugin. When I invoke the filter my custom panel  
does NOT show up. In fact nothing shows up. Not even the default  
panel what was being generated for me before I went to a custom  
panel. I put a simple print statement in the constructor of my custom  
panel and that is getting printed out when I select my filter from  
the menu so we get at least that far. Just nothing shows up. I have  
looked at my previous code for a custom panel for a reader which  
works fine and I am not seeing what the difference might be. I know  
it could be any of a dozen things that don't seem to match up but  
might someone be able to point me in the right direction on what to  
double check in my code.

If anyone wants the code to look at, just ask and I will tar it up  
and send it out.

Thanks for any help on this.

It could be that you're not referencing the .ui file correctly in your 
pqLoadedFormPanel subclass.  Or that the ui file isn't being added to a 
Qt resource file.

You might prefer deriving from pqNamedObjectPanel instead, so he UI gets 
generated and compiled in, rather than generated at run time with extra 
possible reasons if it doesn't work.  You can look at pqExodusIIPanel as 
an example.  You might find it a bit simpler to do something like this

#include "ui_MyPanel.h"

class MyPanel : public pqNamedObjectPanel, protected Ui::MyPanel
{
...
};

MyPanel::MyPanel(..)
{
  this->setupUi(this);
  ...
}

THANKS!! Copy-paste will ya every time. I will take a look at the  
pqNamedObjectPanel instead as I thought my .ui file was being uic'ed  
for me, but I guess not.


Thanks again for the help. I must have looked at that code a dozen  
times and it all looked fine..

Have a great day.

This is a really wild guess: in all the other examples I've seen there is another 
StillRender just before the ResetCamera. Maybe its needed for ResetCamera to figure out where to point the camera?

Subject: [Paraview] selecting suitable file format to begin
Message-ID: <47EA0811.2050902@gmail.com>

Hi
I am a new user of paraview , trying to migrate from tecplot (on 
windows) to paraview (on linux). I read the  VTK file format 
(www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf) but I needs your guide about 
following questions:

1. My CFD code uses multi block (patched) grid with structured 
(curvilinear) grid in each block and uses collocated grid to store 
data.  Which data file format is more suitable for my data? Is it 
possible to use vtk legacy format or I should use XML for multiblock?

2. Does paraview support the Data Explorer file format which is used by 
OpenDx?

3. My wrote my code in FORTRAN. Is it possible to generate the paraview 
data file in FORTRAN or I should shift to C++ and use VTK class?

4. As I see in the mailing list, many users use python. How much python 
is necessary for a paraview user? Should I go to learn it too or It is 
just an option for advance users?

Please note that I am in the first step of changing from one visualizing 
package to another one and it is very important for me to select the 
suitable one since my students which will work on my codes should follow 
that system.

Best Regards,
M.R.Hadian

Subject: [Paraview] Extract Block remains grayed out after deleting Temporal
 Shift Scale
Message-ID: <20080326.184400.85410925.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

For the newest ParaView CVS head, I noticed that once I run the
Temporal Shift Scale filter over a multi-block dataset, even after
deleting the filter from the pipeline the Extract Block item in the
Filters menu remains grayed out and cannot be run again over the
original dataset. However if I further run some other filters (Cell
Data to Point Data for example) and delete it, the Extract Block item
gets alive again and can be run over the original dataset.

I'm using ParaView on OS X Leopard. Is this a known issue?

Regards,
Takuya

Subject: [Paraview] How to do animation?
Message-ID: <7AEC29D79CDD2646955922C34AFF197342DA20@USMLVV1EXCTV06.ww005.siemens.net>


Dear Paraview group:

I have been using paraview-2.4 for a couple of years now and switched to
paraview-3.2.1 a few days ago.  

It used to be pretty easy to make animation video.  But, I am very
confuse about animation in pv-3.2.1.

According to an article in paraview wiki, I only need to open the top
level file, say file...vtu (actually, I have something called
fileN.pvtu).  Then, paraview will handle the sequence.  But, when I
selected file...pvtu, in pipeline browser, it only showed file1.pvtu.
And, animation only anaimate within that file.

Can someone shed some light on what I missed?  Thanks!

Best,

Pei

Thank you very much, Ken and Kent for your help. I tried to follow your 
suggestions which brought other problems, not a paraview bug though. But 
I did manage to find the problem, which is GLX not being (properly?) 
loaded. Even running "glxinfo" made the X server crash. Poking around I 
found out that starting firefox first does the job. Perhaps firefox is 
smart enough to load GLX...not sure whats going on but works for me.

This means your current script won't work with ParaView 3.2.1.  Unfortunately, ParaView does not currently have the ability to write out a script to get to its current state, although it is fairly easy to write a few lines of script to load a state file.  Either way, you will need to review the ParaView scripting document, which is also posted to the Wiki.

We no longer support file series of pvtu files. We dropped support for
file series of formats that can support time natively. You need to
write a pvd file that points to your pvtu files and load that one.
Your pvd file should look like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0.1" group="" part="0" file="foo0.pvtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.2" group="" part="0" file="foo1.pvtu"/>
...

Hi Takuya,

This is a known issue. The problem is deep down in the 
pipeline/executive. We will track it down soon.

I've add a bug for it:

Message-ID: <1D7195E0-DDA3-4F2A-81EE-96F683D7F4B4@gmail.com>

I am writing a custom GUI for my filters. Part of the GUI are buttons  
that allow the user to select a color for certain parts of their  
data. I generally have things working but when the user selects a  
different color the "Apply" button remains disabled. Is there a  
method call that can be made that would tell ParaView to re-enable  
the "Apply" button? I have some other UI elements in the GUI which  
are auto hooked up to SM XML and changing any of those values will  
trigger the "Apply" button in the proper way.

Thanks for any help.

	filter
Message-ID: <79582C7E-6126-4E35-A797-948FB8153248@gmail.com>

I am writing a custom reader + filter for my customer. For  
conversations sakes lets say the data (unstructured grid) could be in  
one of 12 categories. The customer wants to be able to set a custom  
display color for each of the categories. I think there are a few  
different ways to go about this but I am not sure of the pit falls of  
either way.

1: Add a 3 component scalar array to the data set that holds the RGB  
value that the cell would need. (Which category the cell is in is  
determined as the filter runs). I believe ParaView will interpret  
this as RGB colors and "Do the right thing"

2: Add a single component scalar value that holds which category the  
cell belongs to and then have the user load a custom color lookup  
table from the disk.


1 seems easier for the end user but would seem to take up more memory.
2 seems less easy (Manually have to load a custom color xml file) but  
may take less memory because I am storing 1 byte instead of 3.

Any one have any thoughts on this?

Thanks in advance.

1 locks you to a colormap. 2 lets the user change the colormap as the display media and context change.

I do have 12 buttons in my custom GUI that allow the user to change  
each category color.

In looking through some prior vtk code that I had written I was  
thinking that I could attach a color table to an actual data set.  
Turns out I didn't remember correctly and you attach a lookup table  
to a "Mapper" object instead.

Thanks for the thoughts.

Using a single value for the category might make it easier to apply
other filters to the category field.  For example, one could apply the
threshold filter to remove categories or histogram to see relative
occurrences of each category.  Using filters on your category may or may
not make sense, but that's my thoughts on it.

This is weird. Did something change on this system between first
configuration and compilation? It looks like bunch of compile tests
that include ansidecl.h passed. Can you try to compile the following
program with gcc? Also, can you send me the output of make VERBOSE=1?
Just the end where it fails is fine.

Calling pqProxyPanel::setModified is the only way to enable it.
Perhaps you have code that disables it afterwards?

You can set a breakpoint in pqObjectInspectorWidget::canAccept and double 
check that its being enabled when you want, and not disabled when you don't 
want it to.

I use the following:

emit modified();
     this->referenceProxy()->setModifiedState(pqProxy::MODIFIED);

and that seems to have the desired effect.

You should call 
this->setModified();
instead.

To: paraview at paraview.org


Hi
I am a new user of paraview , trying to migrate from tecplot (on
windows) to paraview (on linux). I read the  VTK file format
(www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf) but I needs your guide about
following questions:

1. My CFD code uses multi block (patched) grid with structured
(curvilinear) grid in each block and uses collocated grid to store
data.  Which data file format is more suitable for my data? Is it
possible to use vtk legacy format or I should use XML for multiblock?

2. Does paraview support the Data Explorer file format which is used by
OpenDx?

3. My wrote my code in FORTRAN. Is it possible to generate the paraview
data file in FORTRAN or I should shift to C++ and use VTK class?

4. As I see in the mailing list, many users use python. How much python
is necessary for a paraview user? Should I go to learn it too or It is
just an option for advance users?

Please note that I am in the first step of changing from one visualizing
package to another one and it is very important for me to select the
suitable one since my students which will work on my codes should follow
that system.

Best Regards,
M.R.Hadian

Message-ID: <e58876f00803262228p20c47f4fw83ad371b2d29427e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a VTI file that consists of many datasets representing
timesteps of evolution of some physical system. The way Im putting
them into the VTI file using VTK libraries is as follows :

write_connected_vti_image=vtkImageData::New();
for ( looping over timesteps ) {
  vtkFloatArray* array;
  ...(writing the data into the array)
  write_connected_vti_image->GetPointData()->AddArray(array);
}
vtkXMLImageDataWriter *writer = vtkXMLImageDataWriter::New();
writer->SetFileName(filename_c);
writer->SetInput(write_connected_vti_image);
writer->Write();

Next, Im loading the created VTI file in Paraview using Countur
Filters or Slieces to visualise the data. In Paraview I can jump
between datasets in Object Inspector of the Contour object with the
"Countour by" select box which displays all the datasets from the
opened VTI file.
Now I would like to make an animation out of it. But in the Animation
View, selecting Countour as the changing source gives me only the
possibility to animate over Isosurfaces and not over datasets. Similar
thing goes for Slieces.
Question is : How can I animate over particular datasets from one file
in Paraview ?
Im using Paraview 3.2.1

Thank you for any help.
Thomas

Hi,

Sorry to bother you again, but does anyone have a comment?
This time I had a look through the bug tracker but could not find the issue.

Takuya

From: OSHIMA Takuya <oshima at eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>
Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2008 14:41:17 +0900

Hi,

I have a dataset which contains an array with the name say "A/B,"
which in turn contains a character that may be interpreted as a
mathematical operator '/'. If I try to run Filter->Calculator and to
evaluate an expression "A/B + A/B" over the dataset, I can't get the
expected result (an array with all components doubled).

I'm not sure this should be called as a bug since the array name is
itself confusing, but anyway what I found out was that finding the
first occurrence of the array name within the given expression is not
enough in vtkFunctionParser::OperatorWithinVariable(). I think at
least the array name should be searched until the location of idx even
if there was an occurrence prior to the location.

Here I attach a patch that worked for me. I know this is far from
perfect as a fix (there are still many possible cases that can't be
properly detected). Please take it just as a clarification of a
solution that worked for me.

Regards,
Takuya

I will be creating some custom readers in the next few weeks and the  
data in those the data files are just XY plot type data, Not 3D at  
all. Is there a way to have the reader, through a custom GUI plugin  
possibly, instantiate a new 2D plot view and have the data rendered  
in the 2D plot view instead of rendered in the 3D view?

Sure. I know this. But please look at the Filter plugin example in 
Examples/Plugins/SMFilter. How to integrate the category information 
into this plugin xml file?

By using this xml file you will have "MyElevation" only listed in the 
category "Alphabetical".

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
   <ProxyGroup name="filters">
    <SourceProxy name="MyElevationFilter"
                 class="vtkMyElevationFilter"
                 label="MyElevation">

    .............
    </SourceProxy>

Yes.  If your readers output a vtkRectilinearGrid with your data as point 
data, ParaView will create an xy plot view instead of putting it in the 3d 
view.  Have a look at the vtkExtractTemporalFieldData class.

You have to make a separate xml file for the GUI side to change how the GUI 
behaves.

http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo
shows how to write the xml you want, and how to put it in your plugin.

If its a fixed number of datasets, you could have your reader with multiple 
output ports, and put each dataset on a different output port.
In ParaView's pipline browser, each output would show up as a separate item 
that you could add a filter to, control display properties, etc...

Hi Clint,

thank you for adding that info to Plugin_howTo:

Anywany it looks like adding the category option doesn't change anything:

Here the .xml file included in the .qrc plugin file:

<ParaViewFilters>
   <Category name="Common">
     <Filter name="InvertImage"/>
   </Category>
</ParaViewFilters>

This InvertImage-Plugin shows up only in the "Alphabetical" category...

Mike,
On ParaView 3.2.1, try using the icon that looks like a counter clockwise green circle with a black arrow into the center of it.  If it doesn't exist, right click on one of the empty areas of the toolbars (top of ParaView), and enable "Center Axis Controls".

Mike,
Wrong e-mail last reply.  Sorry.

Pick has been replaced by the four icons that look like triangles with dotted squares around them.  For instance, if you want to pick a cell, use the green triangle (Select Cells On).

Then, you can see the results of the pick using the data analysis tool Filters/ Data Analysis/ Extract Selection.  Be sure to hit the "Copy Active Selection" button, then apply.  Then, split the screen and use Spreadsheet View.  Be sure to turn on the eyeball when the spreadsheet view has focus.

Message-ID: <47EBD041.7060800@psc.edu>

I'm using pvpython 3.2.1 on Linux with Utkarsh's patch for the proxyName argument for CreateRepresentation. Text appears with

===
T = servermanager.sources.TextSource()
T.Text = "Hello World"
TR = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( T, view,\
   proxyName="TextSourceRepresentation" )
TR.FontSize = 24
===

but no value I've tried for FontSize makes any difference. The undocumented parameters Resizable and ScaledText have their default values of 1. Any idea how to make the text larger? What is there now is unreadable.

TIA!

Did it rebuild your qrc file after your change?  Can I see your qrc file, your 
CMakeLists.txt file and your server manager xml?

Using pvpython 3.2.1 on Linux. Making a "representation" of a colormap just crashes though that seems the most logical way. I cannot find anything that looks like the C++ class vtkScalarBarActor. Help!

Ok.. I did all that BUT I am not able to see the Data Arrays  
(Vectors) attached to each cell. Is there some filter I need to run  
next?

This was _much_ easier in PV2.6....

I can't remember whether this is in 3.2 but you can create a
spreadsheet view and turn on "Show only selection" (or something like
it) in the display page. Make sure that spreadsheet view is selected
when you are editing the display parameters. Then as soon as you
select something (no need to apply a filter here), it will show up in
the spreadsheet view. We could probably set it up such that a
spreadsheet view shows up as soon as you select something... Play
around with it and give us some feedback. This is supposed to be
easier than 2.6.

Subject: [Paraview] Script operations cause Paraview to crash after deleting
	server
Message-ID: <47EC69AE.4000901@web.de>

Hello -

I've written a script that loads several dozen legacy VTK files 
outputted by a simulation into Paraview for visual inspection. 
Naturally, whenever I rerun the simulation, the contents of the files in 
Paraview require updating; because manually deleting each file from the 
  pipeline browser would take too long, I decided to delete the 
"builtin" server and attempt to reimport the files by running my trusty 
script. Unfortunately, Paraview doesn't think this is a great idea, and 
it crashes. (Because of this, I've taken to quiting the whole 
application and relaunching it - just to reimport files.) Surely, there 
must be a better way ;-) .

What say you, O wise Paraview gurus :-) .

Dear PV group:

I completed a transient conjugate heat transfer analysis which contains
solid regions and fluid regions.  Data were save in pvtu format.  It
contains temperature field and velocity field.

Is it possible to somehow plot the fluid/solid boundaries?  Also, is it
possible to plot the velocity field without the solid regions (maybe
still show the walls of the solid regions with temperature)?

Thanks!

I'm not sure if I understood your question completely, but you can filter out
the boundaries and see the solid region inside the domain by using the "extract
surface" filter combined with the "clip" filter to hide the boundaries.

Renato.

If your data is not a multigroup dataset you can try the "append datasets"
filter associated with the  "clean to grid" before the procedure I described in
my last email. So, your pipeline should look like:

(DS0,DS1,DS2,DS3) --> Append Datasets (join the parallel pieces) --> Clean to
grid (it removes the parallel interface) --> Extract surface (to get only the
boundary surfaces) --> Clip (to cut out the boundaries)

In the pipeline above "DS" means Dataset (a pv file in your case)

Cheers

Renato.

In the example program, below, the sphere appears with the expected colormap but the colormap legend does not. Am I creating the legend B the right way? How should I connect B to V?

Can anyone suggest how to do this?

Recently I wanted to try a variation on one of our custom readers in  
ParaView. I proceeded to changed all the xml files and added a new  
source file. I updated the ParaViewImport.cmake file, reran cmake on  
ParaView 3 (CVS), built and ran ParaView. When I try to open my data  
file I get the following error:

ERROR: In /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/ 
vtkSMProxyManager.cxx, line 330vtkSMProxyManager (0x626af70): No  
proxy that matches: group=sources and  
proxy=PrdsMultiBlockDislocationReader were found.

Short of a clean build I have removed all the generated files that I  
can think of to get rid of this message.

I ran "grep -R "PrdsMultiBlock" *" in the build directory and NOTHING  
comes back.


Anyone have any ideas? I was hoping to save myself a clean build but  
it looks like I will probably have to do that.

ParaView is very flexible and the final result depends solely on which 
filter are used and how you associate them to modify the visualization 
pipeline. "It's like play with Lego ;o)". Thus, you have several ways to 
get equivalent results, for example:

(DS0,DS1,DS2,DS3) --> Append Datasets --> Clean to grid  (***) --> 
Extract surface --> clip (ok, it's already done...)

Now, select the clean to grid dataset and build a second pipeline like this:

(***) Clean to grid --> Glyph (it'll give you the glyphs inside the 
domain) --> clip (use a 2nd. clip to select what portion of the domain 
should stay visible)

Of course, you could also apply the clip before the glyph filter that 
the final result should be the same (I guess, since I'm not testing it). 
Note also that you will be branching the pipeline, which is very common 
in VTK and ParaView as well.

You only should keep in mind what each filter gets as input and what 
they produce as output to go further deriving the way the data is 
visualized.

Hope it helps you with what you want.

Great, That is now working. Is there any way to give the "output" a  
human understandable name? Right now I get "Output-0" and "Output-1".  
Can I set a name in the vtkInformation object for each? Or something  
like that?

Thanks

Message-ID: <288270.74702.qm@web34206.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Finally after many weeks managed to get paraview 3.2.1
compiled and working on IRIX 6.5.22m. So far it seems
pretty usable but I am running an a 4cpu onyx2.

Most of the compile issues were pretty trivial and I
haven't been able to do extensive testing yet.

Anyone interested in this binary as a download.

I was going to talk with the IRIX users to see if they
would be interested, what are the rules about
distributing the compiled version out to this small
group?

Cheers

Hi,

error message

Any thoughts?

I have 7.5 GB of Ram so I am guessing that this should
not happen

load and hit play, on irix just compiled the code
under mips 7.3.1.

Wondered if anyone had any hints why this template
class is unable to allocat memory. I will look at it
later but hints would be great.

Cheers

After applying Utkarsh's patch the text displays as expected when using pvpython, and when using pvbatch in serial mode. However, when pvbatch is run in parallel mode, the program crashes. The error seems to come from vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor which is of course only used in parallel mode.

The system is CentOS 5 and I was running 3.2.1 with the patch plus a few local additions. 

A fix or workaround would be very much appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Color By Vector with vtkPolyData
Message-ID: <B230A7C5-8DFB-4562-B7D4-20FD0EFB71B1@gmail.com>

I have a custom filter where I generate a vtkPolyData object as  
output. As part of the filter I create a vtkUnsignedCharArray and  
attach that to the cell data as a Vector.

output->GetCellData()->SetVectors(slipColors);
output->GetCellData()->SetActiveVectors(
       Dislocation::SlipSystemColor.c_str() );

There are also 2 other arrays (vtkDoubleArray, each with 3  
components) attached to the Cell Data that get passed through during  
the filter.

When I run the filter in ParaView, the "Color By" drop down menu does  
not show my Cell based attributes? Am I simply missing something? Or  
is this not possible with vtkPolyData?

An earlier version of the filter generated a vtkUnstructuredGrid as  
an output and the "Color By" drop down menu would show the vectors  
from the cell data.

If it helps, I am generating vtk_lines as my cell type.

Thanks for any help.

Is it possible to color vtkPolyData objects by cell attributes (an  
RGB scalar array) rather that point attributes? I seem to be able to  
have done this with vtkUnstructuredGrid but not vtkPolyData.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.10.0803271033220.2516@localhost>


  Hi all

  This may step out of the paraview only related stuff so if someone 
considers this noise please reply me personally. My lab as some money to 
buy a new machine, 8 Gb RAM, 2 x dual core or 1x quad core, not decided 
yet. Anyway, I'm thinking, for visualization purposes and using paraview, 
what would be the best option:

  1 graphic board, super-duper state-of-the-art

  or

  2 graphic boards?

  My idea is that if I'm working with very large data sets, there is a 
problem not only rendering but also processing the data and, with only one 
graphic board, lauching parallel paraview isn't very good (at least in my 
experience).

  I wait your thoughts on it.

  thanks for input,

If you just want the vector text attached to the cells or points in the 3d view, and no spreadsheet view at all, try the following.

Do the pick part as Alan described, but stop before the extract selection filter.
Then, View->Selection inspector
In the selection inspector:
  choose either "cell label" or "point label" depending on the type of your vector
  choose the variable from the "label mode" drop down box
  check the "visible" box

Note that there is some bug in the display of the data, see bug 6627. It seems to be fixed in the trunk now (Thanks Utkarsh!) If you follow Alan's instructions to put the data in the spreadsheet view, the data is correct. At least I haven't seen it be wrong.

I can't remember whether this is in 3.2 but you can create a
spreadsheet view and turn on "Show only selection" (or something like
it) in the display page. Make sure that spreadsheet view is selected
when you are editing the display parameters. Then as soon as you
select something (no need to apply a filter here), it will show up in
the spreadsheet view. We could probably set it up such that a
spreadsheet view shows up as soon as you select something... Play
around with it and give us some feedback. This is supposed to be
easier than 2.6.

Hi everyone,
    I have some questions about Paraview.
    I am trying to develop a visualization system with VTK, which will use
the mechanism of Paraview. So I want to know where I should start and may
the book of The Paraview Guide will help. I have downloaded the Paraview
Source - ParaView3.2.1, but I don not know how to use it. Should I read all
the code or part of it? If I want to develop the similar software with
Paraview ,which part is the most important?
    I am a novice about Visualization and Paraview , I am looking for your
help.
    Thanks so much!

Message-ID: <89998d610803281354w3fd49029g4f4a506b17fc2efa@mail.gmail.com>

hello,
I think there may be a bug in paraview 3.2.1 to load .mhd files.
I am a new use with paraview, and I just want to display the deformation
field that I got from itk.But when I save the deformation field as a file
output.vtk, I can display it successfully with paraview;when I save it as
output.mhd, it can't be opened with an error:
ERROR: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLParser.cxx, line 442

vtkXMLDataParser (05E05D50): Error parsing XML in stream at line 1: not
well-formed (invalid token)

 ERROR: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLReader.cxx, line 317
vtkPVDReader (05DFF190): Error parsing input file. ReadXMLInformation
aborting.
And this situation can be solved by paraview 2.6.0.So I think it is a bug
for paraview 3.2.1.
Am I right?

Can you give some more details about your code or your images? I just
tried the CVS version of ParaView and I was able to move both scalar and
vector images back and forth.

I don't see that problem, on an Irix bulid of mine.
To fix the compile errors, I just patched it from CVS.
cvs up -j 1.13 -j 1.14 VTK/Utilities/vtklibxml2/CMakeLists.txt
or you can get the code using the CVS tag "ParaView-3-2" instead 
of "ParaView-3-2-1" as described here:

Subject: [Paraview] CVS problems with custom filters
Message-ID: <47F154C7.9000707@gmail.com>

I updated a couple of the linux machines at my workplace today and 
encountered a problem with some filters. We are having a couple filters 
that used to work now fail when either trying to set ouput or double 
arrays. The problem stemming from the array sizes now being multiple 
times larger than expected. Did something change, or is this a bug?

Subject: [Paraview] gradient filter dumps core
Message-ID: <8e0b87a90803311812ie4c2290m9764e7cd5383c975@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The Gradient and Gradient Magnitude filters on a 3D  point, scalar,
image data crashes Paraview version 3.2.1 on Windows XP x86_32 and on
Ubuntu FeistyFawn x86_64.

On Windows the following output is displayed during crash:
Qt has caught an  exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from and event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

On Ubuntu, there is no output. Only  core dump after Segmentation Fault.

Also note that Unstructured Gradient filter (following a Clip filter
on the image data) works just fine. It is also curious that this
filter has the "Result Array Name" output, which then appears in
"Color by" list. There is no such output option in Gradient Magnitude
filter. Is this by design?

Any guidance on how to track down the problem will be greatly appreciated!

thanks
Levent

Subject: [Paraview] Python Scalar Bar Label Text Size
Message-ID: <47F1A035.8030809@psc.edu>

The Python program below works except that LabelFontSize doesn't seem to have any effect. TitleFontSize works as expected.

Another object, servermanager.sources.TextSource, requires that its property ScaledText be set to 0 before its FontSize parameter had an effect. Alas, there seems to be no such option for the scalar bar. The label text is controlled only by the overall object size (Position2).

Have I missed something? Is there a workaround?

TIA!
