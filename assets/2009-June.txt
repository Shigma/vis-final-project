Subject: [Paraview] Scripting the opacity property of a Time Annotation
	filter
In-Reply-To: <919e0fb50905310010x10a6a9a8nb2f650179fbafbc@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <7ba9d6a30906010550k35d8aee1uc28f15aba776d12b@mail.gmail.com>

There was a bug in the server manager configuration XML where no domain was
specified for the Opacity property. Domains are used by the animation engine
to change the property values. I've committed a fix for it in the CVS.
Please update and give it a try.

/cvsroot/ParaView3/ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml,v

new revision: 1.351; previous revision: 1.350

Thanks

Jona,

Simply replace "KeyFrameAnimationCue" by "CameraAnimationCue" as follows:

---  <snip>
# Create an animation cue for the camera. This represents the "track" shown
in cuethe Animation View.
cue = servermanager.animation.CameraAnimationCue()
cue.AnimatedProxy = [view]
</ snip> ---

Hi Paul,

A fix is committed to cvs head. Please update pqComponents of
paraview, and give it a try. Once we confirm the fix is working
properly (and not breaking anything else :), we will port it to 3.6
release branch.

That clarified it.  I am able to reproduce the problem now, and I see that it is in fact a bug.  I submitted a report for this.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

Hi Ken,

the order of operations is:
-load the data

-attach my temporal filter to the ExtractBlock filter

If my data doesn't consists of multiple parts, so I don't have to use
the ExtractBlock, my temporal filter works fine.

Hi,

I wrote a small Copy & Paste Plugin for ParaView and wanted to share it. 
You can copy a branched filter stack consisting of standard filters, all 
parameters should get transferred automatically. It's a very basic 
plugin and there is still a lot of room for improvement, so if you've 
got any modifications, please share them here...

Regards,
Michael

 (paraview 3.4, 3.6)
Message-ID: <4A24EFBA.9050602@gmx.de>

Hello,

I try to visualise parts of a point cloud (POLYVERTEX) using the
threshold-filter.

But any threshold-value will remove _all_ points instead of only a few.
I wonder if this is a bug...

I attached a example-xmf-file. If you you try to visualise only the
points with 'type'>0 all points disappear, even though there are points
with type=1.0

Any idea?

Greetings
Jens

Message-ID: <C64A9A19.9CD8%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I actually disagree with that statement.  The issue with 6662 is that the pipeline is sometimes stuffing data in a vtkTemporalDataSet when it should not.  If you look carefully at 9089, you will see that in fact the data is supposed to be in vtkTemporalDataSet; the downstream temporal interpolation filter will not work otherwise.  The error occurs even when the data really should be in temporal form.

In my mind 9089 is a fairly serious issue; the executive is failing to properly use a filter that does not directly support temporal data.  Issue 6662 is just a minor inconvenience; as long as temporal data is being handled correctly, the only effect to the user should be an odd reporting of temporal data set in the information panel.

Re: [Paraview] Problem with temporal filter and multi-block data That clarified it.  I am able to reproduce the problem now, and I see that it is in fact a bug.  I submitted a report for this.

Hi Ken,

the order of operations is:

If my data doesn't consists of multiple parts, so I don't have to use
the ExtractBlock, my temporal filter works fine.

In-Reply-To: <4A25181B.506@cscs.ch>
Message-ID: <C64A9C99.9CDC%kmorel@sandia.gov>

In the short term you can get around this problem by first running your data through the glyph filter using the 2D Glyph/Vertex as the glyph type.  Another work around is to use the clip filter with a clip type of Scalar instead of the Threshold filter.  In the long term, John is right.  You should write out your xmf file with a single vertex cell per point.

As far as "fixing" the threshold filter, the current operation is correct, but I've thought for a long time that the clip-by-scalars functionality mentioned above should be available from within the threshold filter.  Rather than have an All Scalars checkbox, there should be a tri-state Any Scalar/All Scalars/Clip option.

Hello,

I try to visualise parts of a point cloud (POLYVERTEX) using the
threshold-filter.

But any threshold-value will remove _all_ points instead of only a few.
I wonder if this is a bug...

I attached a example-xmf-file. If you you try to visualise only the
points with 'type'>0 all points disappear, even though there are points
with type=1.0

Any idea?

Greetings

Hi John,

thanks for your ideas. The solution is to use
<Topology
	Type="POLYVERTEX"
	NodesPerElement="1"
	NumberOfElements="130">
</Topology>
in the xdmf-file.

OK.  What you describe is not part of the original posting of 6662, but I'll take your word for it that there is a larger issue encompassing both problems.  Perhaps this is documented in the voluminous notes attached to 6662 that I'm not going to bother to read.

I disagree with your disagreement. TemporalDataset is a TypeOf CompoundDataset. In the executive, there is a check for IsTypeOf(insert compound stuff here), and the test returns true when it gets temporal, but should be returning false because the filter wants multi-block - which is a sibling of temporal. 6662 is causing a great deal of errors related to temporal data and fixing it will also fix 9089 (at least I think so). 6662 really addresses 2 serious problems in my mind. One is the wrong type checks above, the second is the incorrect creation of Temporal types when not really needed. Although they are two bugs, I propose a pipeline /executive fix which should address both.

On a side note. Does the original poster know that the temporalPathline filter already does what he wants? (build trajectories of particles etc?) - though not multi-block.

JB

Re: [Paraview] Problem with temporal filter and multi-block data I actually disagree with that statement.  The issue with 6662 is that the pipeline is sometimes stuffing data in a vtkTemporalDataSet when it should not.  If you look carefully at 9089, you will see that in fact the data is supposed to be in vtkTemporalDataSet; the downstream temporal interpolation filter will not work otherwise.  The error occurs even when the data really should be in temporal form.

Can someone refresh my memory about FieldData?

I have a dataset with PointData and FieldData. The FieldData contains
multiple scalar arrays. Each array has a different number of tuples.

ParaView (3.6) reads them without complaining. The Object Inspector
shows the correct bounds ([min, max]), meaning the arrays were read to
the end. So far so good.

Trouble comes with the Spreadsheet view. I expected to see a column of a
different size for each array when choosing the FieldData attribute.
Instead, the column displays are all truncated to the size of the first
array.

Same with "Plot Data". The length of the X axis gets truncated to the
number of tuples of the first array.

Any hints will be appreciated.
TIA

and I can move the "slice" slider to see the different slices. Previously
with this type of data I have been able to set the representation from
"slices" to "volume" to rotate the data in 3d. However in this case the
"representation" drop down box is greyed out. Is there some filter I have to
run first to allow this to be viewed as a volume?

Thanks,

David

Hello,

Is it possible to compute limiting streamlines in paraview (for exemple 
on a vessel hull) ?

Thanks to anyone who have the answer.

Hi Berk,
I read a lot of paraview emails during the weekend 24-25/05 and also next Monday. I understand than you had been working hard on python script. I have downloaded last cvs version (3.7) and compile. All problems had been fixed.
Now I can read a file VTK with python.
Thank you very much.
Regards,
Jona

You are looking at the slice in what's called a "2D View". Split the current
view (or close the current view) and create a new "3D View". Show your data
in this view and you should be able to do volume rendering. ParaView creates
2D view b default for 2D image datasets.

I am not sure I understand. You are interested in surface constrained
streamlines? I am guessing from an inviscid simulation?

ParaViewers,
I have a reader wich have a panel selection in paraview to load properties
arrays by using a list of checkbox in the GUI.
Sometimes when many properties are checked, paraview crash with memory size
problem.
I don't know if i need to run ParaView run in parallel in many nodes
or partition
the big file in multiple files and try change
the reader to file series mode?

Thanks.

At least I am interested in this.
In general streamlines are better in 3.7dev, stream tracer has obviously
improved. However generating constrained streamlines with emitters on
one part of a multi-block dataset streamlines often terminate at the
border to another part - reason for termination ist "6" - any suggestions?

Message-ID: <5f395e810906040210u1c9e3ab7yb743dc4f807660a6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I succeeded to compile the version 3.6 of Paraview on Red Hat 4.5 AS with
Dual Core AMD Opteron.
But when I want to save an animation, I don't have the possibiliy to save an
animation in avi format (only jpg, tiff or png format).
I think i forgot something in cmake option. Can someone tell me which option
I have to put in ccmake to have the possibility to save animation in avi
format ?

Thanks,

Compile csv Paraview with ffmepg
Best,
Jona

FFMPEG Source Code

The FFMPEG multimedia library source code can be obtained either from the sourceforge web site or by downloading ffmpeg_source.tar.gz 
ou
1) Checkout ffmpeg.
>> cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous at mplayerhq.hu:/cvsroot/ffmpeg co ffmpeg



>> cd ffmpeg

>> ./configure --disable-vhook --disable-static --disable-network --disable-zlib --disable-ffserver --disable-ffplay --disable-decoders --enable-shared --prefix=/tmp/ffmpeg_inst


4) Build the ffmpeg libraries.


>> make


5) Install the ffmpeg libraries into a well defined path.
make install

6) Now set VTK or ParaView's CMAKE variables to find the ffmpeg 
library and header files.

  VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER:BOOL=ON
  FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/tmp/ffmpeg_inst/include/

You need the ffmpeg library to create .avi files within ParaView on
Mac and Linux. More exactly, you need a specific (old) version of
ffmpeg.

You can get that version, and instructions for how to compile it and
link to it, here:
http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html#addons

For the specific config parameters that we used when making the binaries see:

David,
Regarding this line on the link you sent:
"The FFMPEG multimedia library source code can be obtained either from
the sourceforge
web site <http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/download.php> or by downloading
ffmpeg_source.tar.gz <http://www.vtk.org/files/support/ffmpeg_source.tar.gz>"

I didn't understand that that contained the source as well as instructions
on how to link to it until I downloaded it and found the README. Maybe it
can be changed to something like

"The FFMPEG multimedia library source code can be obtained either from
the sourceforge
web site <http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/download.php> or by downloading
ffmpeg_source.tar.gz <http://www.vtk.org/files/support/ffmpeg_source.tar.gz>.
The tar file also contains instructions on how to link Paraview to the
library."

Just my $.02.

Thanks,

David

Hi,

Could you include the needed ffmpeg library sources in the source code of 
ParaView, with an option to build it or use native ffmpeg for the system, 
or is there a licence issue?

Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] limiting streamlines in paraview
Message-ID: <4A27EA1B.5020603@sirehna.com>

Limiting streamlines and Vortex Lines are features that are available in 
FieldView and that i would like to reproduce in Paraview.

from what i understood, limiting streamlines are curves on a surface for 
which directions are thoses of the vanishing fluid velocity

something like : dx/tx = dz/tz (with tx, tz : viscous shear stress)

(found in 
http://books.google.fr/books?id=rfszzPiuDfAC&pg=PA368&lpg=PA368&dq=%22limiting+streamlines%22+formula&source=bl&ots=CHvs_wxF16&sig=CUlIajS0GkjKPEkodrDy-bb6nBM&hl=fr&ei=hTkmSpuGO8vGsgbKooTYBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#PPA369,M1  
on p368-369)

so i guess i need to have the viscous shear stress (something like 
du/dy, and dw/dy)
surely i 'will have to use these as a vector for streamlines filter
but surely there will be some projections to be made regarding to the 
surface normals...

I will try to dig a little in order to have a custom filter about this 
but any comments or help are welcome.

Hi Stephane,

There are two issues:

1) license - ffmpeg source has optional dependencies to GPL'ed code.
Hence it has GPL'ed code. Even though those are optional and we do not
use them, we cannot include them in the ParaView source.
2) patents - ffmpeg has support for patented algorithms that we do not
have licenses for. As of ParaView 3.6, we do not depend on any
patented algorithms. Including the ffmpeg source code would cause
issues even though we do not use its patented algorithms.

Because of the issues, we cannot include ffmpeg in the ParaView source.

PS: We are now using mjpeg for creating avi files.

Berk,

By "now using", do you mean "starting to work on", or is there some other
flag that I'm not seeing to enable MJPEG video creation?

Thanks,

If you compile ParaView against ffmpeg and save an avi on Linux or
Mac, you will get a motion jpeg encoded movie. It used to be mpeg4.

Message-ID: <2bd34dd10906041337l59c6e413o30fb65d9dfcd6896@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been trying to combine pvts and its list of vts files into one
large vts file.

I've tried things like the following, but it isn't working quite the
way I would expect, some of the data is getting truncated for reasons
I haven't been able to figure out.

#!/usr/local/bin/pvpython
from paraview.servermanager import *
Connect()
reader = sources.XMLPStructuredGridReader(FileName="fields.00010.pvts")
extract= filters.ExtractGrid(Input=reader)
extract.VOI=(0,64,0,8, 0,0) # This is the volume I'm interested in
extract_writer=writers.XMLStructuredGridWriter(Input=extract, FileName="ff.vts")

extract_writer.DataMode=0
extract_writer.UpdatePipeline()

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Mark

Well I think of two ways:

1. export wall shear stress components from CFD-code and use these (what
we currently do), this seems quite ok.
2. Calculate wall shear stress in paraview. I currently have no filter
to do this but would be interested in one...

Message-ID: <C8D3F57E07352C4B9C8E779E2B27B9EA0EA0DA@LAXA.intra.cea.fr>

Hi all,

I am using Linux and last csv version of Paraview (3.7)
I have 2 Pyphon script which animate a cylinder either with or without scalar opacity.
When I use "pvserver" on one CPU, both work well.
If I use "mpirun -np 4 pvserver" to work on four cpu, I saw a color problem when I use script with scalar opacity.
I don't understand why.

I link the scipts in my email.
Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards, 
Jona

I've chosen not save avi's from ParaView anymore. I think it's better save
the frames (jpg or png) and render the movie afterwards, with any
format/compression desired, using VirtualDub for instance.

more 2 cents ;o)

Message-ID: <5D20F4AE6EF4C44B8932FE91E08AF0E9BAD234@U-SANTORIN.dif.dam.intra.cea.fr>

Hi all,

Here attached is a plugin with new filters that enable material
interface reconstruction using the Youngs method. Compared to the legacy
algorithm, it has been generalized to accept arbitrary mesh types and
thus can be used for visualizing material interfaces of Eulerian or ALE
simulation codes outputs.

Load the testing.pvsm file to have a pipeline example.

Building the pipeline for your own needs is not trivial and heavily
depends on your data, so I cannot explain here all possible ways to use
this plugin.
If you're interested in material interface reconstruction, please mail
me and I'd be glad to help you use my filters on your datasets.

You can load CGNS file by way of the VisIt database bridge. Requires 
building and linking against VisIt.

Perhaps unrelated but I see you are using the legacy reader. As far as I 
know this reader is not parallel and so if you use it while running in 
parallel you'll end up with entire data set loaded in all the processes. 
Probably not what you had in mind.

Developing a new fully featured reader is a lot of work as well.

The VisIt team will in their next major release be building with CMake, 
updating to the current version of VTK and a host of other improvements 
including cleaning up the link time dependencies between their shared 
objects. All of which should go a long way to simplify the situation.

At least you have options...

Hi,

i am just starting to look at paraview so forgive my ignorance if my questions 
are obvious.

I was wondering if it is possible to load and look at hdf5 files in paraview. 
I build paraview3.4.0 (using qt4.5) and it runs but there is no hdf5 file 
extension mentioned. 

I looked around the web a little as well but could not find anything useful.


thanks

Hey matt,

You need to create and xdmf file (xml style) which tells paraview how
to read the data.  I think there are examples on the paraview wiki.
You can also check the xdmf website for more info:
http://xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format

Good luck,
Peter.

HI,
I don't understand well, because when I use Paraview and "mpirun -np 4 pvserver" to work on four CPUs or 8 CPUs when I use 2 computers, and Paraview work well, but not with python.
I would like to use Pyphon script on parallel.
Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Subject: [Paraview] immediate_update for an information only property
Message-ID: <fb2577d80906071035j11c914dcne5f59d8bbb0187d0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to do a progress bar in a filter. I did the following steps:
1- add an information only property to my xml to pass the progress
status to the client:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="currentIteration"
        command="GetcurrentIteration"
        number_of_elements="1"
        information_only="1"
        default_values="0"
        immediate_update="1">
        <SimpleIntInformationHelper/>
      </IntVectorProperty>

2 - connect this property to a slot in the client to update the
progress bar value:

	this->currentIteration = vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(
		this->proxy()->GetProperty("currentIteration"));
	this->QVTKConnect = vtkSmartPointer<vtkEventQtSlotConnect>::New();
	this->QVTKConnect->Connect(currentIteration, vtkCommand::ModifiedEvent,
		this, SLOT(updateProgressBar()),0,0, Qt::DirectConnection);

3- I update the value of the progress bar in the Slot:
void pqMyFilter::updateProgressBar()
{
	this->progressBar->setValue(this->currentIteration->GetElement(0));
	QCoreApplication::processEvents();
}

The value of the progress bar is updated only when requestData is
done. Is that mean the immediate_update of an
information only property doesn't work ?

Thank you !

immediate_update is not supported for information only properties, for that
would mean the ParaView has to constantly keep on fetching values from the
server side as there's no way to know exactly when the server side ivar
would change.

Message-ID: <c9adba420906080403q39f739a2mdc4c85d2d42000ee@mail.gmail.com>

Would it be difficult to provide an option in the "Display" tab of the
"Object Inspector" to render without any lighting (well, just ambient and
without any shading)?  Apparently this can be done in FieldView.  Any hints
on how to do this would be appreciated.

Folks, ParaView 2.x had an interesting and (apparently) simple feature that
was lost in PV 3.x. In PV 2.x we could load files by dragging and dropping
files in PV's screen.

Another missing feature (or I have not found yet) are the "fly in" and "fly
out" cameras.

Is there any plans to recover such features in PV 3.x?

Hi,

Is it possible to change the name of an object in the pipeline with a python
script? i.e. if I go to the Python shell and type:

    s = Sphere()

It will create a new object called "Sphere1".  Is there a way to set this
name?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <C6527BC2.9FC4%kmorel@sandia.gov>

You can animate a clip or slice plane by adding an animation track for the slice offset value.  First, add the slice filter.  Second, go to the animation view (View -> Animation View) and add a track for the "Slice Offset Values" for the slice filter.  Your animation is now set up.

If that does not make much sense, then perhaps you are not familiar with animation facilities in ParaView.  You can read about it in Chapter 11 of The ParaView Guide (http://www.kitware.com/products/books/paraview.html) or in Section 2.13 in the latest Supercomputing tutorial handouts (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SC08_ParaView_Tutorial).

I've been looking into this more and noticed how Sphere is mapped to the
CreateObject function.  So I can do what I want with:

s = servermanager.source.Sphere()
servermanager.Register(s, registrationName="aDifferentName")

This works for me :)

Hi,

I found the following bug.

The following grid becomes a

Dimensions are always read as zyx instead of xyz,
if Topology-Type=3DCORECTMESH

Jens,

The slowest changing dimension is always listed
first in <Topology>. So in a Plot3D grid it would be KJI.
Eventhough it is a bit confusing at times
it's done this way to try to be consistant.

Message-ID: <C6529CC6.9FF6%kmorel@sandia.gov>

This type of option actually belongs in the render view options, not the display panel.  If you look at the display panel, you will see that a couple of lighting options are already implemented.  I don't know how easy it would be, but you should be able to implement a new lighting setup by duplicating code that is already there.

Folks,

what would be the smartest way to attribute global Id's to vtkMultiBlockDataSet's points ?

I can't figure out a way other than passing the merge blocks filter, obtaining a vtkUnstructuredGrid, than associating a vtkPointData. But this way I would loose the blocks information.

By the way: is there a forum only concerning about VTK, or should I  post this kind of doubt here ?

Thanks,
Rafael March.

Rafael,

The vtk users lists can be found here:
http://www.vtk.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo

These lists share many of the same users, but if the problem has nothing to
with Paraview then it should probably be posted there.

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Problem running paraview on windows.
Message-ID: <2CB54D8E7445A240BF6D07E398C9222C025837A7@s0-ott-x1.nrn.nrcan.gc.ca>

	While attempting to run paraview 3.4.0 (installed from the
binary provided for 32 bit windows), I receive the error message
'paraview.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close'.
	If I try to run the previous version, 3.2.1, I get the same
message, but in addition paraview outputs an error message: 
'Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement Qapplicatoin::notify() and Catch all exceptions there.'
Any help is appreciated.

Folks,

what would be the smartest way to attribute global Id's to vtkMultiBlockDataSet's points ?

I can't figure out a way other than passing the merge blocks filter, obtaining a vtkUnstructuredGrid, than associating a vtkPointData. But this way I would loose the blocks information.

By the way: is there a forum only concerning about VTK, or should I  post this kind of doubt here ?

Thanks,
Rafael March.

One way is to iterate over all the blocks and individually assign point data
arrays with unique ids across the blocks.

The problem with the render view options is that it applies to everything in
the view.  In FieldView you can, for example, just set this for the contours
of a surface where everything else is rendered normally.

I'll take a look at the render view code....

Thanks,

If you want to disable shading for line-contours, simply switch to
"Wireframe" representation. Lighting is disabled by default for wireframe
rendering.

Good afternoon,

In developing a plugin for Paraview i need to be able to access the playback
controls (play, next frame, previous frame, etc)  of the ParaView client.
Which classes are they contained and how can i access their methods if any?
Or where can i get info about this?

The user who requested it is interested in seeing contours of volumes
rendered this way (i.e. surfaces).  Adding it as another representation
could be an option - just out of interest, how much work is involved in
added a representation?

Thanks,
Paul

Has anyone had any success building ParaView on 64bit windows using mingw?
(I presume Kitware are using the microsoft compiler...)

That's correct, we use Microsoft compilers for building our binaries.

Subject: [Paraview] Configuring with VTK_USE_CARBON=OFF not working as
	expected
Message-ID: <410E9C2A-113C-4E5D-8E64-4B2C0E6A3902@bluequartz.net>

  I am trying to run the following cmake command:

cmake -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/Users/Shared/Toolkits/Qt-4.5.1- 
UBFramework/bin/qmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON - 
DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64   -DPVRoboMet_SOURCE_DIR=/Users/ 
mjackson/Workspace/PVRoboMet -DPARAVIEW_USE_PVRoboMet=ON - 
DVTK_USE_64BIT_IDS=ON -DVTK_USE_CARBON=OFF -DVTK_USE_COCOA=ON - 
DPARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES=PVRoboMet - 
DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_Prism=OFF - 
DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_PointSprite=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/ 
Shared/Toolkits/ParaView-64 ../

  .. which is run from a clean build directory. When I search for  
VTK_USE_CARBON I get the following:

543:[mjackson at Ferb:Build]$ grep "VTK_USE_CARBON" CMakeCache.txt
VTK_USE_CARBON:BOOL=ON
//Advanced flag for variable: VTK_USE_CARBON
VTK_USE_CARBON-ADVANCED:INTERNAL=1

  So I am guessing that there is some cmake commands in the vtk cmake  
files that is over-riding my choice? Can anyone else reproduce this?  
Should I file a bug report?

This is on OS X 10.5.7, Intel, Mac Pro.

Thanks

And just to follow up with more info, even if I do use the CMake gui  
(ncurses) to set VTK_USE_CARBON=OFF and VTK_USE_COCOA=ON I get the  
following compile error:

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Blocks Selection
Message-ID: <699888.89440.qm@web110116.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I want to get the global Ids of the nodes selected through selection inspector, using a "Block Selection" to choose a part of the model. 

I thought I would be able to retrieve the ids of the cells (or points) with the method pqSelectionManager::getIndices() or pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIds(), but none of them retrieve any Ids when I make the selection of a block.

Which is the right way to get this information ?

Regards,
Rafael.

to start testing with PV 3.6.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crash
Message-ID: <BAY109-W50DC59442BFC581A995598B2420@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I suppose this bug is well known but who knows?
I have an Ensight dataset, which I slice and then I want to save the resulting subdataset in VTK file format.
I get 2 error messages like this:
ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Filters/vtkCompleteArrays.cxx, line 138
vtkCompleteArrays (0x20c0f650): Could not create point array. The output will not contain points
Now if try to read the new dataset, paraview runs a looooonnnng time, actually till I have to kill it myself.
Since I suspected that both point free files may be the source of my problems, I deleted the 2 lines in the VTL master file and... everything goes right!
Anyway, it would be better if this problem could be fixed, isn't it?
Regards

Hi Fred:

   Is it due to EnSight reader or other paraview issues (after the dataset
is properly loaded)? If it is the former, would you please provide the
EnSight dataset and detailed procedure to re-produce the bug?

   Thanks.

Is there a preferred DashBoard to submit results to? or just to the

There is a 3.6 release section on the dashboard.  There are already several sites contributing 3.6 results.  I'm not sure how the dashboard distinguishes between the 3.6 builds and the rest of them.

Hey Ken,
   Could you explain your setup for sending Dashboards. I am trying to  
set one up for my OS X 10.5 intel box and have looked at your PV 3.6  
submissions but I think I am still pulling CVS head instead of the 3.6  
branch.

Thanks

I recommend using a new procedural style ctest dashboard driver
script, such as the one at:

   http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewNotes.php?buildid=352037

instead of the old style declarative style script.

In either case, run your script via ctest -S scriptname.cmake

For completeness, I put that call into a shell script (chmod+x'd) and
run the shell script via crontab (or the windows scheduler utility).

#!/bin/bash
T0=`date`
LOGFILE="/Users/demarle/Desktop/Dashboards/nightly_log.txt"
rm -f $LOGFILE
echo "START AT  $T0" > $LOGFILE
echo "------------------------------------------------" >> $LOGFILE
/usr/bin/ctest -V -S /Users/demarle/Desktop/Dashboards/nightly_script.cmake >> $
LOGFILE
echo "------------------------------------------------" >> $LOGFILE
echo "START TIME $T0" >> $LOGFILE
echo "END   TIME `date`" >> $LOGFILE

For completeness I follow that crontab entry with a call to killall in
case a crash isn't cleaned up.

In an old style script like the one Utkarsh pointed to, include a definition
for "CVS_UPDATE_OPTIONS:STRING=-d -A -P -r ParaView-3-6" in the
CTEST_INITIAL_CACHE variable. (The important parts being the -r branch-name
args...)

In a new style script that uses ctest_update() and ctest_build() and so on,
set the CTEST_UPDATE_OPTIONS variable:
SET(CTEST_UPDATE_OPTIONS "-dAP -r ParaView-3-6")


HTH,
David

Getting there. How do I make my entry show up under the ParaView 3.6  
category?

And do I need to be running the latest CMake or CMake from CVS for all  
of this?

You can't make your build show up in ParaView 3.6 -- only the "project
admin" for ParaView can do that on the CDash server. So... after you are all
set, just let us know what the "site name" and "build name" are for your 3.6
submission and we'll get the project admin to categorize your build...
You can use CMake 2.6.4 just fine for everything that's been discussed here
so far.

Categories are managed explicitly at Kitware. I can promote your dashboard
to the 3.6 category once you give me it's site & build name, and it has
shown to be stable enough to go under the 3.6 dashboard catergory :).
Typically you want the build name to reflect that it's a release dashboard
by prefixing it with Rel36 or something like that.

Awesome. Thanks for all the info. I am still trying to get the  
dashboard to compile properly.

Subject: [Paraview] How to get CTest to use "Make -j16" in my Dashboard
	submission
Message-ID: <EE06A7C2-D4E4-4E14-B64C-769768F0425D@bluequartz.net>

After following lots of advice from another thread I am finally  
getting PV 3.6 branch built. But the build is only using 1 processor  
of 16 available. I have the following in my declarative style ctest  
file:

file (WRITE "${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY}/CMakeCache.txt"
"
//Command used to build entire project from the command line.
MAKECOMMAND:STRING=/usr/bin/make -j 16
//Path to a program.
CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/make
//Name of generator.
CMAKE_GENERATOR:INTERNAL=Unix Makefiles
//Path to a program.
CVSCOMMAND:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/cvs
//Build type
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug
//Turn on more strict warnings
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-Wunused -Wformat -Wsign-compare -Wshadow
SITE:STRING=${CTEST_SITE}
BUILDNAME:STRING=${CTEST_BUILD_NAME}
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/Users/Shared/Toolkits/Qt-4.5.1- 
UBFramework/bin/qmake
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON
BUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=x86_64
VTK_USE_RPATH:BOOL=ON
VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS:BOOL=ON
VTK_USE_CARBON:BOOL=OFF
VTK_USE_COCOA:BOOL=ON
PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_Prism:BOOL=OFF
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/Users/Shared/Toolkits/ParaView-3.6-x64
"
)

and that file is called from a shell script file using the following:

ctest -S ${PARAVIEW_DASHBOARD}/ParaView36Dashboard.cmake -V

Looking at the activity meter, there is barely any cpu being used  
during the build. Looking at the process list only shows a single  
instance of gcc running at any one time. Thoughts?

Thanks

In a new style script, get rid of the MAKECOMMAND from the cache and do this
in the ctest -S script:
  set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j16)

May I recommend:
set (CTEST_NOTES_FILES  ${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/ParaView36Dashboard.cmake
/tmp/ParaViewDashBoardNotes-GCC.txt
  ${CTEST_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY}/${CTEST_SCRIPT_NAME}
)

That way the script itself is sent as a dashboard note, too.

Subject: [Paraview] [paraview] using with python - multiview and animate
	together
Message-ID: <C8D3F57E07352C4B9C8E779E2B27B9EA0EA0F4@LAXA.intra.cea.fr>


Hi all,

I am work with Paraview (3.7) and with linux.
Now, I know with python how made a design and create a animate.
With Paraview I made a multiview with differente represention and I made a animation together.
Now, I would like to make like that with python.
I don't know how to make a multiview with python and create a animation together.
Do you have a small pyphon script to explain how I can do.

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards, 
Jona

Ok. So I finally got the compiler to use more than one thread and the  
test seems to progress OK until about test # 370 or so where ParaView  
starts getting launched a bunch of times. Sometimes this works fine  
and the next test seems to progress and other times it is sitting at  
an Open File Dialog just waiting. Not sure what I need to do at this  
point.

Here is my revised CTest script.
cmake_minimum_required ( VERSION 2.6 )

set (CTEST_SITE "ferb at bluequartz.net")
set (CTEST_BUILD_NAME "Rel36-OSX10.5.7-GCC4.0.1(Xcode 3.1)")

#SET (CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY TRUE)
SET (CTEST_UPDATE_OPTIONS "-dAP -r ParaView-3-6")
#ctest_empty_binary_directory (${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY})

ctest_start (Nightly)
ctest_update (SOURCE "${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/VTKData")
ctest_update (SOURCE "${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/ParaViewData")
ctest_update (SOURCE "${CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY}")

What happens when you run those particular tests from the command
line? Do they fail in the same manner or do they pass? Does the
LastTest.log say anything interesting on those tests? Are they timing
out perhaps?

Do I maybe not have my ParaView Data Directory set up correctly?

I have verified that the data is located in "/Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ 
ParaViewData" and that same path is in my CTest script file.

Here are the errors:

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=354150

As far as the Qt versions go. I need 64 bit on OS X. Period. This is  
the only way to get it. So how do I turn off the Qt based tests?

It means something is going wrong with ParaView's homegrown Qt testing
infrastructure. The test is trying to do something to a particular Qt
widget. In this case press the addServer button. But it can not find a
widget by that name for some reason.

You are using a Qt that is more current that the "officially
supported" 4.3.5 right? My guess is that the testing infrastructure
might need a change for the newer Qt versions.

I believe you have to edit Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt and add
a new option that disables them. Grep for BUILD_TESTING there. You
want the new variable to disable all the test scripts that live under
Applications/Client/Testing/[XML|Python], because both types use the
Qt testing infrastructure.

Subject: [Paraview] Client Side plugins dependent on all server side
	libraries?
Message-ID: <178AB8FC-5A4F-47B0-B3F9-8D832C45A7ED@bluequartz.net>

I am trying to write a plugin for ParaView 3.6 which has both a  
"client" part that has code ONLY dependent on Qt and a server side  
that has code dependent on Qt, Vtk and one of my own libraries which  
gets built as part of build system.

   After having some issues getting this to compile I started tracking  
down the dependencies of the Gui side library and the server side  
library. Turns out the Gui Side library is dependent on all the  
"server side" stuff like all the vtk libraries. Is this correct? Seems  
kinda odd to me.

Thanks

That's correct, the client have VTK dependencies as well.

The thing that has seemed odd to me is this compulsion to split a plugin into server and client pieces.  In my not very humble opinion you should just place everything in one plugin that is loaded on both client and server, which usually makes things much easier for both plugin developer and end user.  Add some CMake code to not compile the Qt and GUI stuff if the ParaView was not built.

Is this the new recommended way of doing things? I would really love  
to use the same CMake code to build both as part of the PV compile  
process and outside of it if possible.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.6 animation script causes a segmentation fault
Message-ID: <919e0fb50906130122i25b14aa6l9b63e01f9354d0b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Running the animation script below from the built-in python
interpreter with ParaView 3.6 (using the latest CVS updates today)
results in a segmentation fault.

I'd like to get camera animation to work, but I am not sure if I
should do anything different compared to 3.4. Any help would be
appreciated.

Here is the script:


#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

fps = 24.0 # frames/seconds

view = GetActiveView()
camera = GetActiveCamera()

movie = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
movie.ViewModules = [view]
movie.NumberOfFrames = int(round(fps * 3.0, 0))

cam_vu = camera.GetViewUp()
cam_pos = camera.GetPosition()

cue = servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue()
cue.StartTime = 0.0
cue.EndTime = 1.0
movie.Cues.append(cue)

keyf0 = servermanager.animation.CameraKeyFrame()
keyf0.KeyTime = 0.0
keyf0.Position = camera.GetPosition()
keyf0.FocalPoint = camera.GetFocalPoint()
keyf0.ViewUp = camera.GetViewUp()
keyf0.ViewAngle = camera.GetViewAngle()

camera.SetRoll(60.0)
camera.Elevation(-50.0)

keyf1 = servermanager.animation.CameraKeyFrame()
keyf1.KeyTime = 1.0
keyf1.Position = camera.GetPosition()
keyf1.FocalPoint = camera.GetFocalPoint()
keyf1.ViewUp = camera.GetViewUp()
keyf1.ViewAngle = camera.GetViewAngle()

cue.KeyFrames = [keyf0, keyf1]

camera.SetViewUp(cam_vu)
camera.SetPosition(cam_pos)

#movie.Play() # Play the animation
movieWriter = servermanager.vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter()
movieWriter.SetFrameRate(fps)
movieWriter.SetFileName("movie.png")
movieWriter.SetAnimationScene(movie.SMProxy)
movieWriter.Save()

Subject: [Paraview] Python Programmable Source Filters
Message-ID: <4A33890D.7050100@gmail.com>

Hi-

I've just started using paraview recently. I have some surface data that
I wish to make a contour out of that I have in Matlab. Since the CSV
feature in 3.4 doesn't seem to work correctly, I've resorted to using
the CSV reader programmable source snippet of code.

I've gotten the point data to import correctly, but nothing is
displayed. So I figure I need some data about faces and such. However, I
can't seem to find any docs documenting how to add faces using the
python scripts, such as the CSV reader on the wiki.

If there is a better way to load in the information, or data about
adding "face" data in addition to the points, so that the surface shows
up in paraview would be greatly appreciated.

-Jon

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Blocks Selection
Message-ID: <891352.72047.qm@web110103.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I want to get the global Ids of the nodes selected through
selection inspector, using a "Block Selection" to choose a part of the
model. 

I thought I would be able to retrieve the ids of the
cells (or points) with the method pqSelectionManager::getIndices() or
pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIds(), but none of them retrieve any Ids
when I make the selection of a block.

Which is the right way to get this information ?

Regards,
Rafael.

Currently there's no direct way of converting from block to id-based
selection. vtkConvertSelection does not handle the case where the input is a
block-based selection.  Feel free to add a feature request to the bug
tracker.

A possible alternative would be to apply the ExtractSelection filter and
then fetch the resulting dataset to the client. That will have the ids for
the extracted block.

Hi Peter,

First of all, I apologize for taking so long looking into this.

I think I know what the problem is. In prog_filter.py, you are doing
the following:

outputBlock = inputBlock.NewInstance()

Due to some issues in VTK's reference counting and the way it
interacts with Python, this causes a memory leak and outputBlock is
never released. Try this:

outputBlock = inputBlock.NewInstance()
outputBlock.UnRegister(None)

instead. I bet you this will fix the memory problem. I will
investigate how we can solve this problem in VTK in the future.

When I use 'mpirun -np 2 pvserver'  on my dual core MacBook (either  
connecting to it via paraview client or standalone), it keeps one of  
my CPUs pegged at nearly 100%.  Is this to be expected?  (Just running  
the serial './pvserver' of course just generates 'Listening...Waiting  
for client...' with no CPU load).

% ./pvserver --version
ParaView3.7

% ompi_info
                 Open MPI: 1.3.1

thanks, Randy

You need to set the animated proxy on the cue. Not sure how this could have
worked in 3.4 either.

<snip>
cue = servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue()
cue.StartTime = 0.0
cue.EndTime = 1.0
cue.AnimatedProxy = view
movie.Cues.append(cue)

Dear ParaView developers,

As we see the attention paid to ParaView is rapidly growing in our
country, we hope to translate the SC08 ParaView tutorial handouts
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/6/62/SC08_tut121_ParaView_Handouts.pdf)
to Japanese and distribute its copies online for free. However there
doesn't seem to be a particular license (such as GFDL) attached to the
handouts that helps us to confirm if it is allowed. Hence we would
like to ask, can we have the permission to do it? If yes, what are the
conditions? Thanks.

Yup, that's expected. That's because of your MPI implementation. OpenMPI
does a busy wait when waiting for mpi messages. I think there's an
environment variable or something that you can set to disable that, I am no
sure. Maybe someone on the mailing list knows, or try checking the OpenMPI
documentation.

Subject: [Paraview] EnSight Reader problems
Message-ID: <1e5109b00906150929j27eec0f5s3a67b68ba1121bb4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to read an EnSight .case file into paraview, but I get the
following error message:

ERROR: In /tmp/Kitware/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx, line
242 vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader (0x164df40): Invalid part id; check that
ByteOrder is set correctly.

The EnSight reader works fine with a sample file, just not with the data I
have (the difference might be that the sample file is a regular ensight
file, and mine is ensight gold). Does anyone know what the problem might be?


Thanks,

Adam

Hi Adam:

    The error message is now on line 259, vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx (as
of the version of May 14, 2009), as opposed to line 242 that you report.
Does it mean that you are using an out-dated version of the reader? Please
update your ParaView/VTK (at least class vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader) with
the latest version. If the problem still occur, please provide your whole
dataset and the procedure used to re-produce the bug via Mantis (
http://paraview.org/Bug/my_view_page.php). Before that, please make sure
your data files comply with EnSight formats.

    Please note that VTK/ParaView supports both 'regular' and Gold EnSight
files.

    Thanks.

    -Zhanping

Hi Adam:

   Below is some excerpted info (courtesy of Ricardo Reis) on how to check
EnSight file formats using 'ens_checker'.

   ===excerption====
In this links you (and everyone else) can find the program ens_checker which
checks if your files are properly formated for the ensight layout. It checks
for binary and ASCII files. ens_checker.32 is for 32 bit platforms,
ens_checker.64 for 64 bit. Linux off course.

 http://aero.ist.utl.pt/~rreis/ens_checker.32

 http://aero.ist.utl.pt/~rreis/ens_checker.64

 hope it can be of use.
 just do ./ens_checker.<32/64> filename.case
 ====end of excerption====

Thanks Utkarsh.  Just to add to this thread, I asked some of the OMPI  
developers and apparently it's not possible to avoid this behavior.

Has anyone tried to visualize genealogy with the infoviz plugins with  
paraview or anything else? I have a personal project that I am working  
on and it would seem that a 3D layout may be better for visualizing  
family genealogies.

Thanks for any info.

Mike:

This has been on my "honey-do" list for awhile ... if you've been 
working on any geneology-related readers, I'd be interested.

For a 3D layout you may want to look at vtkConeLayoutStrategy, which is 
in VTK CVS.

Cheers,
Tim

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Blocks Selection
Message-ID: <661938.58859.qm@web110105.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi Utkarsh,

thanks for the tip. I'm trying now to use the vtkExtractSelection filter, but it requires two inputs: a vtkSelection object, and the Model, whose block will be extracted, according to the selection. The question now is: how to get the vtkSelection object which corresponds to my current selection made in Paraview ? I can only manage to get a pqSelectionManager object in my filter.

Thanks again for the help.

Regards,
Rafael.

Currently there's no direct way of converting from block to id-based selection. vtkConvertSelection does not handle the case where the input is a block-based selection.? Feel free to add a feature request to the bug tracker..

?
A possible alternative would be to apply the ExtractSelection filter and then fetch the resulting dataset to the client. That will have the ids for the extracted block.

Hi,

I want to get the global Ids of the nodes selected through
selection inspector, using a "Block Selection" to choose a part of the
model. 

I thought I would be able to retrieve the ids of the
cells (or points) with the method pqSelectionManager::getIndices() or
pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIds(), but none of them retrieve any Ids
when I make the selection of a block.

Which is the right way to get this information ?

Rafael.

Rafael,

pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIDs takes all the necessary steps and then
delegates to vtkSelectionConvertor filter to do the actual conversion. So if
you fix vtkSelectionConvertor to convert from blocks to ids, then
pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIDs should automatically work. Look at
implementation of pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIDs to see how the two inputs
are set up.

Message-ID: <fb2577d80906151240u37c9a1ffk7e44a6744d48deb8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Is it possible to create a custom object panel for a writer ? using
pqLoadFromObjectPanel ?
I tried it and my GUI is not showing up, so I am wondering if the
reason is because writers doesn't support
custom object panel.

Thank you.

Heya,

Also, I've been trying to script a batch import of .stl files into
ParaView and have been referencing these two pages to get the script
below:

http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Load_many_sequentially_named_files
http://ait.web.psi.ch/services/visualization/paraview_python.html

pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
for i in range(566):
? ? reader = servermanager.sources.stlreader(FileNames="/Users/brian/Documents/Processing/visualization/data/"
+ repr(i) + ".stl")
? ? pm.RegisterProxy('sources',repr(i) + ".stl",reader)

I would like to then Show(pm) but have found that Show no longer seems
to be a working function (or at least I am missing something in how I
call it). ?I've looked all over the Wiki and through your Class Index
but am still confused. ?Can you be any help? ?Thanks!

.Brian

ps. Is there any ParaView functionality that supports live
Visualization? ?I've never encountered any software that can handle
such huge amounts of data so elegantly, I would love to be able to
somehow combine some of your tools with my Music Visualization
research in Processing....

For this reason, I use MPICH2 on my MacBook Pro and OpenMPI on my Mac
Pro. I can't remember which device I ended up settling on - I think
the default. If I remember correctly, ch3:nemesis was causing the same
issue as OpenMPI.

Ken Moreland from Sandia has final word but I don't think there is any
problem with you doing this as long as you give the authors the due
credit. We should probably think of assigning some sort of creative
commons license to these documents in the future.

Hi,
has anyone have encountered Animation Pixellisation ? I am using

The final .avi file produce low quality images with pixelisation.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Blocks Selection
Message-ID: <366914.68679.qm@web110106.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Utkarsh,

for me is actually ok, as you suggested, to use the Extract Selection filter as a "black box". It will do what I need, which is to get the global id's of the nodes which the user selected (no matter how). The Extract Selection filter does exactly this job, right ? At least I'm able to do using it by hands in ParaView. 

I'm just having difficulties in setting up the inputs of this filter. It seems that the class vtkPVExtractSelection is an interface for the already existing filter vtkExtractSelection. The latter requires the vtkDataObject, from which we want to extract a piece, and a vtkSelection object, which represents the selected points or cells (Actually this is what is stated in vtkExtractSelection::FillInputPortInformation and opposed as explained in the documentation, so the docs might be wrong). My question is, how can I get - from my filter's code - a vtkSelection object, which represents exactly what the user is selecting in ParaView's screen ? If I am able to get this information, I can use the vtkPVExtractSelection filter and the job is done ! 

Thanks for your attention.

Best Regards,
Rafael.

Rafael,

pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIDs takes all the necessary steps and then delegates to vtkSelectionConvertor filter to do the actual conversion. So if you fix vtkSelectionConvertor to convert from blocks to ids, then pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIDs should automatically work. Look at implementation of pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIDs to see how the two inputs are set up.

Hi Utkarsh,

thanks for the tip. I'm trying now to use the vtkExtractSelection filter, but it requires two inputs: a vtkSelection object, and the Model, whose block will be extracted, according to the selection. The question now is: how to get the vtkSelection object which corresponds to my current selection made in Paraview ? I can only manage to get a pqSelectionManager object in my filter.


Thanks again for the help.

Currently there's no direct way of converting from block to id-based selection. vtkConvertSelection does not handle the case where the input is a block-based selection.? Feel free to add a feature request to the bug tracker.


?
A possible alternative would be to apply the ExtractSelection filter and then fetch the resulting dataset to the client. That will have the ids for the extracted block.

Hi,

I want to get the global Ids of the nodes selected through
selection inspector, using a "Block Selection" to choose a part of the
model. 

I thought I would be able to retrieve the ids of the
cells (or points) with the method pqSelectionManager::getIndices() or
pqSelectionManager::getGlobalIds(), but none of them retrieve any Ids
when I make the selection of a block.

Which is the right way to get this information ?

What codec is it using?  There are some pretty low quality codecs available for AVI, and even the high quality ones can use low bitrates which would also cause what you're seeing.

Hi,
has anyone have encountered Animation Pixellisation ? I am using Paraview 3.4.0 and use animation generation with 1000x800 size.
The final .avi file produce low quality images with pixelisation.

Any hint is welcomed: thanks in advance

hello,
I did not figure that paraview was using internal codecs: on the "save 
animation" dialog, I did not see any codec selection.
Should this be defined at paraview installation instead ? I am working 
on a std Win32 distribution without any plug-in or whatever.

thanks in advance for your help

This is not correct. The reader is indeed serial. However, ParaView
redistributes the data after reading it. So the resulting mesh will be
load balanced across processors but there will be an I/O and/or
communication overhead.

Note that for unstructured meshes, the redistribution is not
necessarily based on spatial partitioning. If you want a nicely
partitioned and load balanced mesh, use D3.

I believe that we use the MSVC codec on Windows due to patent/license
issues. I would recommend saving a set of images and using another

It would be pretty easy to add a function to rename a proxy more

I wonder if someone out there has written a DirectShow save plugin?  Then you could select your own codec and avoid the patent issues too.

Subject: [Paraview] particule tracer
Message-ID: <1245173821.4a37d83dbc414@www.imp.polymtl.ca>

Hi,
I have ParaView 3.4.0 and I have a question about how to use the ParticleTracer.
Because I try and I always receive an error message like this one:
ERROR: In
..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\Filtering\vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 722
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (10684700): Input port 1 of algorithm
vtkTemporalStreamTracer(105D17C0) has 0 connections but is not optional.

So what can I do to have Particle tracer? Thank you.

This sounds like a bug. I thought it worked. We'll check it out.

Does this happen as soon as you start ParaView or after you load some

Hi Jona,

Are you going to run this script inside ParaView or using
pvpython/python? Unfortunately, all of the view management code is
currently in the user interface and you can't access it from Python.
We will address this in the next release. You can create views from
Python, you can render them and save screenshots but you can control
the layout easily. The easiest thing to do is to load a state that has
the view layout you want and then run your script. Sorry for the
inconvenience.

I stand corrected. I have heard so many different claims in term so how 
PV treats serial readers, it's hard to keep them all straight.

Where in the ParaView does the automatic domain decomposition and load 
balancing occur?  Is there a way to take a look at the decomposition 
from within PV?

By the way, it looks like this didn't work in 3.4. It will work in
3.6. Try the following instead

reader_base.SMProxy.UpdatePipeline(1.2)

You can apply Process Id Scalars and then color by ProcessId or use
Threshold to extract a piece.

The implementation is in vtkSMOutputPort::InsertExtractPiecesIfNecessary()

I confirm that with mpich2 version 1.0.7, using the default device
(ch3:sock), the load of an idle pvserver is near 0. With ch3:nemesis,
all but one of the processes use a full cpu. With OpenMPI, I think all
processes use a full cpu.

In conclusion, if you are running pvserver on a Mac laptop, use mpich2
with default build options.

This is configurable on the mpirun command line:

http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#force-aggressive-degraded

If you set the MCA parameter mpi_yield_when_idle to a non-zero value,
OpenMPI will not aggressively poll inside MPI routines. For example:

  mpirun --mca mpi_yield_when_idle 1 -np 4 pvserver

When I try that (on my MacBook Pro w/ 2 procs):
mpirun --mca mpi_yield_when_idle 1 -np 2 pvserver

I still have one CPU pegged at 98%.  Are you saying that shouldn't be  
the case?

It was my understanding that was what mpi_yield_when_idle was there to
fix -- since oversubscribed slots will otherwise have multiple processes
in busy-wait loops -- but I haven't fiddled with it in a while.

Subject: [Paraview] How to change a pipeline representation to Outline,

Message-ID: <16d926890906161506p7a4c17c8kf7eee060949a5ab9@mail.gmail.com>

Good day guys,

This is a fair simple (I think) question but still I haven't found a
way to perform this via c++.

Inside my code I have access to all my  "pqPipelineSource" s, and yet
I haven't found a way to change the pipeline representation (is it
style?) to outline or surface like one can using the GUI.
Does anyone has any idea?

Thanks in advance!

Port 0 should have vector field time dependent data.
Port 1 should have seed points.

The error message is saying that there is nothing on port 1

Hello,
I also tried running pvserver from Unix with a win32 client and I got 
the same behavior. Berk, I tried the EnVe that works
fine: It allows to produce also mpeg files which are smallers. Thanks

I got this problem as well, I though it had something to do with
opacity settings... Can anyone tell me how I can export multiple images
from a sequence of VTK input files?

There are also many other possibilities to make a movie from a bunch of
images, e.g. avidemux can do that (which you can download for free).

Thanks.

The easiest thing to do is to load those files as a time series -
which requires having some sort of pattern in their name such as
foo0.vtk, foo1.vtk ... and then save an animation as a series of
images.

Hello,

I have an other question about elevating a surface. I want to see elevation on a
surface depending of velocity, pressure, temperature... during time or not. So
if the scalar or the vector is big, the pick of the elevation will be higher
than a point that has a smaller value. In a software like Ensight we can do a
slice and an elevate surface (it's an option).
Because I try Elevation in filters, but I doesn't do what i was expecting, or
maybe i don't use it correctly.

Thank you

marie

Have you tried warp (vector or scalar)? If you have a  3D dataset, it would
be better cut a slice before using the warp filter.

Cheers

Renato.

Maybe the filters named "Warp By Vector" or "Warp By Scalar" is what you are
looking for.

Sorry for the delayed response.  I am out of the office this week.

I am happy (in fact excited) to here people are interested in translating the tutorial.  Please feel free to do so as long as the original authors have the correct attributions. (Whoever works on the translations should of course also be recognized for their work.)  In addition, I humbly request that you contribute your translation back so that we may post it to the Wiki and make them available along side the original English versions.

I used LaTeX to format the document.  If it is helpful, I can send you the original LaTeX and image files.

One final heads up.  I plan to be making some revisions for a Supercomputer 09 tutorial that was just accepted.  I have not started this yet, but it should be ready around September or October.

-Ken

Dear ParaView developers,

As we see the attention paid to ParaView is rapidly growing in our
country, we hope to translate the SC08 ParaView tutorial handouts
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/6/62/SC08_tut121_ParaView_Handouts.pdf)
to Japanese and distribute its copies online for free. However there
doesn't seem to be a particular license (such as GFDL) attached to the
handouts that helps us to confirm if it is allowed. Hence we would
like to ask, can we have the permission to do it? If yes, what are the
conditions? Thanks.

Hi,

    Given that Paraview is build with CMake and can be package up via 
CPack, is there a nightly package of the latest version.

    If not, I see the automated/nightly packaging of Paraview as a 
strong testimony for the power of CMake/CPack.

Hi,


when i run Paraview in batch mode (means using Python) and i write out 
export a picture i always get window with the title "Visualisation 
Toolkit - OpenGL" poping up. Is there a way to switch if off?

Here the code:

from paraview.servermanager import *

Connect()
LoadState("magv.pvsm")
view = GetRenderView()
view.WriteImage("test.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 1)


Best regards,

Message-ID: <4A39FC9E.1010509@gmx.de>

Hello,

I'm encountering a problem with paraview-cvs and paraview-3.6. The
following example from the servermanager documentation worked fine for
me in paraview 3.4

from paraview import servermanger
sm=servermanager
sm.Connect()
cone=sm.sources.ConeSource()
elev=sm.filters.ElevationFilter(Input=cone)
view=sm.CreateRenderView()
rep=sm.CreateRepresenstation(elev,view)

#Now try to colourize the cone
lt=sm.rendering.PVLookupTable()
rep.LookupTable=lt
rep.ColorAttributeType=0 #Point Data
rep.ColorArrayName='Elevation'

At this point the following error message occurs:

Traceback (most recent call last):

Jean Favre describe the same error in Message ParaView Digest, Vol 59,
Issue 3, Message 2.

Any help on this topic would be a great help for me.

Please read Berk's very nice email on May 25, subject: "ParaView Python
users please read"

Many changes have gone in, and the scripting is now much nicer and user
friendly. You must change your syntax though. It is all nicely
documented here:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

your new script should be:

from paraview.simple import *
sm=servermanager
sm.Connect()

cone=sm.sources.Cone()
elev=sm.filters.Elevation(Input=cone)

view=sm.CreateRenderView()
rep=sm.CreateRepresentation(elev,view)

lt=sm.rendering.PVLookupTable()
rep.LookupTable=lt
rep.ColorAttributeType='POINT_DATA'
rep.ColorArrayName='Elevation'

perhaps this is an xdmf issue... in XdmfGeometry.cxx we originally have
the following:

            case XDMF_GEOMETRY_XY :
                    Start[0] = TmpArray->GetNumberOfElements();
                    Start[1] = 3;
                    points->SetShape( 2 , Start );
                    Stride[0] = 1;
                    Stride[0] = 1;
                    Count[0] = TmpArray->GetNumberOfElements();
                    Count[1] = 2;
                    points->SelectHyperSlab( NULL, Stride, Count);
                    CopyArray( TmpArray, points);
                    this->NumberOfPoints =
TmpArray->GetNumberOfElements() / 2 ;
                    break;


interesting 'Stride[0]=1' appears twice... if i replace the above with

            case XDMF_GEOMETRY_XY :
                    Start[0] = TmpArray->GetNumberOfElements()/2;
                    Start[1] = 3;
                    points->SetShape( 2 , Start );
                    Stride[0] = 1;
                    Stride[1] = 1;
                    Count[0] = TmpArray->GetNumberOfElements()/2;
                    Count[1] = 2;
                    points->SelectHyperSlab( NULL, Stride, Count);
                    CopyArray( TmpArray, points);
                    this->NumberOfPoints =
TmpArray->GetNumberOfElements() / 2 ;
                    break;

my xmf is loaded (almost) correctly.  the only issue still remaining is
that the Z geometry data is not zeroed, so it takes somewhat arbitrary
values.

Hi Ken,

Many thanks for the supportive words. We will obviously make sure
about the original credits and the feedback.

Indeed it would help us a lot if we can have the document sources,
especially the original image files. Can we have the files?

Stefan,

When building paraview, you need to add OSMesa support.  It's
described in the wiki here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#OSMesa_support

Then you can either run the server in off-screen-mode or set the flag
via python (i.e. view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 1).

Good luck,

Peter.

Takuya and Renato,

The original sources with images is about 35MB.  Rather than try to send that through email, I have sent you a separate email through our web-based file transfer software where you can download it.

If anyone else wants the source, let me know.

Hi Ken,

Many thanks for the supportive words. We will obviously make sure
about the original credits and the feedback.

Indeed it would help us a lot if we can have the document sources,
especially the original image files. Can we have the files?

Thanks,
Takuya

Hi Ken,

I already got the files. Thank's a lot. I'll put my personal effort on this
and try to produce a portuguese translation as soon as I can.

Hey PV community, is there any other Brazillian or Portuguese folk available
to review or translate something?

Ken, thanks a lot again. I already got the files as well. It'll take
some time, but we'll try our best so that the translation will appear
in a reasonable time frame with reasonable quality (and can follow the
SC09 updates).

I have just finished compiling ParaView3.6 on our Linux cluster.
Thanks everyone for help during the compilation.
I have one query about the new 2D plotting function.
I want to plot the "Pressure" over the surface of airfoil, but unable to do it the way I want.
I am attaching 2 pictures the first one is obtained from ParaView3.6 and the second one is the desired output.
If this can be done in ParaView it will be very helpful in a lot of other cases too.
Thanks in advance.

In the "Display" tab in the "Object Inspector", change the "X Axis Data" to
"Use Data Array" and select "Points(0)".

Exactly as Paul said. Well done.

but there is a caveat. It assumes the numbering of vertices along the
profile is in increasing order. It works well with the NACA dataset in
VTKData/EnSight because the mesh is curvilinear structured.

It is much more difficult to get when the profile is the intersection of
a plane with the 3D surface of an airfoil (typically unstructured), and
the numbering of vertices is all but monotonously increasing. Yet
harder, if the profile is the intersection of a 3D multi-block airfoil
surface.

And for that very purpose  "Plot on Sorted Lines" filter was recently added
to CVS.  It sorts the points so that the numbering of vertices is
monotonously increasing. For the multiblock-case, you'll have to do a couple
of operations: Merge Blocks -> Extract Surface -> Plot on Sorted Lines which
will merge the multiblock into a single dataset and then sort and plot them.

We use CPack to package ParaView but we don't have the scripts setup
to release nightly binaries. We may consider doing this after the 3.6
release.

Subject: [Paraview] Porting from VTK to ParaView
Message-ID: <b02264720906190819k39b2c454q964c5bfc4581862b@mail.gmail.com>

I have a rather large VTK code (ezViz, http://daac.hpc.mil/ezviz) that is
written entirely with VTK objects.  The project has reached a point where it
needs to start parallelization.  In the most recent release I switched the
core from just VTK to ParaView, although I'm still just using the VTK
objects.

Is there a guide on porting from VTK to ParaView?  I need to preserve my
functionality in the process, so I'm looking for somewhere between a
"Getting started with ParaView Programming", (which I'll need as well) and a
direct list of VTK-to-ParaView conversions.  I know I'll need to add some
extra stuff for the MPI, but the first step is just getting from VTK to PV,
right?

John,

I think this is fixed now. You'll need to do a cvs update.
Also I think your <Topology> is twisted. Connectivity
0 1 3 4 should be 0 1 4 3 etc. I tried the following and
it looked correct with the fixed code.

           <Topology Type="Quadrilateral" NumberOfElements="2" >
               <DataItem Format="XML" DataType="Int"

Message-ID: <d8a796870906190952s513b9786m976037f6d9ea2507@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to plot a (2D) mesh in wireframe mode and then on top of that
plot a single element in yellow with a script in python with ParaView 3.4.
My thought was to use the threshold plot, but it seems not to plot anything
but blank.  This is what I've gotten so far.  Any ideas?  Also, is there any
good reference material out there for ParaView's python API?

   # load mesh and create a view
   if not ActiveConnection:
       connection = Connect()
   exo = sources.ExodusIIReader(FileName='mesh.e')
   exo.UpdatePipelineInformation()
   view = CreateRenderView()
   # now make a threshold with GlobalElementId and plot element 10
   elementID = 10
   tf = filters.Threshold(Input=exo,
ThresholdBetween=[elementID,elementID],SelectInputScalars=["GlobalElementId"])

   tf.UpdatePipeline()
   rep = CreateRepresentation(exo, view)
   rep.Representation = 1 # 1=wireframe
   view.ResetCamera()
   view.StillRender()

Thanks,
Jay

If upgrading your scripts is too painful, you can try the backwards
compatibility mode described in my message. Please let me know if your
script is failing despite turning on the backwards compatibility mode.

Try this horrible incantation instead:

 tf.SelectInputScalars = ['0', '0', '0', '1', 'GlobalElementId']

In 3.6, this script will be:

from paraview.simple import *

e = ExodusIIReader(FileName='mesh.e')
tf = Threshold(e, ThresholdRange = [10, 10], Scalars = ['CELLS',
'GlobalElementId'])
Show(tf)
Render()

Neither package is required to build ParaView at the moment. There are new
classes in VTK that use those libraries. For example vtkQTRichTextView uses
Webkit. Those classes won't be built if the needed QT library isn't
available. I would recommend the latest version, QT 4.5.1. After the
ParaView 3.6 release I believe we will be incrementing the QT requirement to
4.5.

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Imort Multiblock Datasets
Message-ID: <731219.14829.qm@web24205.mail.ird.yahoo.com>


A nice sunday to everybody,

first of all I have to thank all the Paraview developers who made the tool what it is today. After some correspondence on the mailing list I am able to use the tool with our models today the way I like :-).

One thing I am not so happy with at the moment is how our Ensight-Multiblock-Data gets imported. An import generates one Multiblock-Dataset with every Ensight-Zone as a block. I have lots of zones and need to extract them all by hand. Maybe this could be scripted. Another problem is I use filter that do not work with multiblock-datasets quite often (resampleWithDataset, AppendAttributes,...). So in my eyes most effektive way of importing would be: Not generate ONE Multiblock-Dataset but generate an individuell unstructered Dataset for each Part of the ensight-File and name them after the Ensight Part names - this will give you e.g. 80 Parts in the Tree if you have 80 Ensight parts instead of one. I would not have to extract blocks afterwards. This duplicates the whole model.?Furthermore, if I need unstructed Datasets, I need to run mergeBlocks additionally, producing even more Parts. All of this would not be essential if we had such an import filter.
 However, I do not really know how to modify the filter. Maybe someone can comment on that.

Regards BastiL

Thanks everyone for your help.
I just finished compiling the cvs version of ParaView (dated 20-06-09)
The the 2D plots of a cut plane of multi-block unstructured grids are very encouraging.

I am attaching 2 pictures, the first one is obtained from ParaView3.6 and second one from ParaView3.7 (cvs branch).

One more query- Is there any option for normalizing the axis or swapping in minimum & maximum axis values(Very useful while plotting coefficient of lift).

regards,
Raashid

This filter works basically the same as the Plot Selection Over Time filter.  Load in a data set with time (you know, where when you hit play you see it animate).  Select something, then apply the FFT Over Time filter.

Yup.  That mostly comes from my use of CMake to manage writing my Ph.D. dissertation.  I captured all that in a single cmake file so that I and others could continue to use it.  If you want, I keep a copy of the latest version and documentation on the CMake Wiki.

Message-ID: <739c45d1e89732c745f5ffd2d2d49384.squirrel@gpo.iitb.ac.in>

Hello,

I am Mahendra Suradkar, a 4th year student from IIT Bombay. I wish to view
results of MD simulation of 2D circular disks using Paraview.  I am new to
using paraview, and have still not figured out as to how to format the
text data to make it paraview readable. I have searched several forums,
and all of them say that the text should be formatted in a particular way,
but none of them mention explicitly as to how to format it!

The data I have is set of N disks of diameter d and another M disks of
diameter D. Now this is available as a sequence for different times. Using
these positions of the two types of disks at different times, I wish to
secure an animated view of the disks from the data.

Could you please tell me how exactly the text-data has to be formatted? Or
please provide links to resources on the web that contain the format
specs.

Thank you,

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.5 and 3.6 build problem, libGL.so location,
	OpenSUSE 11.1
Message-ID: <200906231151.14102.g.macpherson@opencfd.co.uk>

Hello,

I had an OpenGL related problem building ParaView 3.5 and 3.6.  I'm running 
OpenSUSE 11.1, 2.6.27.23-0.1, x86_64, with NVIDIA version 185.18.14 drivers 
and OpenGL which came from NVIDIA's repository, i.e. here

    ftp://download.nvidia.com/opensuse/11.1/x86_64/

When it was linking some executables I got a load of errors of the likes of:

    Linking CXX executable ../../../../bin/ImagingCxxTests
    /usr/lib64/libGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv001622gl'
    /usr/lib64/libGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv001299gl'
    /usr/lib64/libGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv001491gl'
    ...
    etc

The problem comes from the fact that /usr/lib64/libGL.so doesn't seem to be 
the correct location for the proper libGL.so, at least on OpenSUSE 11.1 with 
NVIDIA drivers.  If I run

    ldd /usr/bin/* | grep libGL.so

or

    ldd /usr/lib64/* | grep libGL.so

then every system executable and library calling libGL.so is calling it from 
this location:

    libGL.so.1 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libGL.so.1

rather than

    /usr/lib64/libGL.so

where CMake is looking for it.  In the past, I think the packages of drivers 
were creating a copy of libGL.so in /usr/lib64 (for example I have 
/usr/lib64/libGL.so.180.44 from previous drivers, which was soft-linked to 
/usr/lib64/libGL.so) so it was OK to link to it, but they seem to have stopped 
doing that in the most recent version, as that's apparently not where the OS 
is going to look for it.

The reason I had linking problems is that I had the old version of libGL.so 
still lurking in /usr/lib64/, so it was linking against the wrong version.  If 
I manually create soft-links in /usr/lib64 to point to the correct libraries 
in /usr/X11R6/lib64/ then ParaView builds fine.

I could suggest that the CMake looks in /usr/X11R6/lib64 in preference to 
/usr/lib64, but I don't know if this is a portable, general solution.

Regards,

Graham

What is the datatype for the data each block of the multiblock dataset?
ParaView can volume render unstructured grids or image data.

We had many problems with the 185 series (keyboard lockup, lost mouse,
etc. segfault in some commercial software).
We are currently using the nvidia 173.14.18 driver (with openSUSE
11.1-x86_64) and aren't seeing many problems anymore.

With our nvidia driver version, the libraries are installed under
/usr/lib/ and /usr/lib64/

Strange.
On our systems, /usr/X11R6/lib, /usr/X11R6/lib64 exist but are empty.
In fact, the entire /usr/X11R6 tree only has a _single_ entry:
/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth is linked to /usr/bin/xauth

This seems to be a problem with your particular driver version.
It'd be worth it if you dropped nvidia a line to let them know.

I can mention this to the CMake guys and see what they think. We just fixed
a similar problem with finding libGL on HP-UX where it could be in
usr/lib/hpux64 or usr/lib/hpux32.

Hi Alex,

I am moving this discussion to the ParaView mailing list. Please send
your questions/answers there instead of to me directly.

I am not sure what the problem is. The script looks fine at fist
glance. Did you try to get a stack trace by running in a debugger? Or
can you try to comment out portions of the code to try to locate where
the crash occurs?

Hi George,

I am moving this discussion to the mailing list. Please post further
messages there.

ParaView partially supports blanking of structured grids. There are
several things that do not work well currently:
- The geometry filter - the filter that we use to extract the surface
of the mesh - ignore blanking information
- IO - the only reader that support blanking is the Plot3D reader.
There are no writers that support blanking

I suggest that you post feature request for these features at the
paraview bug tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug) as they are useful
features.

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] bug with colour and state files
Message-ID: <c9adba420906230844j1cdb16f3jfec420ea9be4c712@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've noticed a bug with colours and state files.  If you set the colour via
the toolbar then it will not be saved in a state file.  However this does
work if you set it via the "Object Inspector" in the "Display" tab.  Steps
to reproduce this are:

   - launch paraview
   - create sphere
   - change the colour - either "Object inspector" (gets saved in state
   file) or toolbar (doesn't get saved in state file)
   - save state
   - reload paraview
   - load state

Regards,
Paul

I had some fun doing this in Python. Here is a script that creates a
Python filter for each block and names it with the block name. To run
it, you need to select the Ensight reader and then run this script
using the Python Shell under the Tools menu. This requires cvs
ParaView unfortunately as I had to make some minor changes to make it
work.

Another hint: remember that you can turn on/off the visibility of
multiple object by selecting them (using shift+click or control+click)
in the pipeline browser and clicking on the visibility icon (the eye)
of one of them.

I have lots of zones and need to extract them all by hand. Maybe this could be scripted. Another problem is I use filter that do not work with multiblock-datasets quite often (resampleWithDataset, AppendAttributes,...). So in my eyes most effektive way of importing would be: Not generate ONE Multiblock-Dataset but generate an individuell unstructered Dataset for each Part of the ensight-File and name them after the Ensight Part names - this will give you e.g. 80 Parts in the Tree if you have 80 Ensight parts instead of one. I would not have to extract blocks afterwards. This duplicates the whole model.?Furthermore, if I need unstructed Datasets, I need to run mergeBlocks additionally, producing even more Parts. All of this would not be essential if we had such an import filter.

Thanks for the quick reply, Ken.
 
I forgot to mention that the data I am working with is in Ensight Gold
format and the time step values are not stored within the file. What I would
like to do is be able to create an array containing these values that the
FFT filter can access once I have read in my list of files into Paraview. Is
this possible? Or do the time step values have to be defined explicitly in
the data file?
 
In the meantime, I'm going to take a look at the Exodus Reader to get a
better idea of how the time step values are assigned.

This filter works basically the same as the Plot Selection Over Time filter.
Load in a data set with time (you know, where when you hit play you see it
animate).  Select something, then apply the FFT Over Time filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Python Calculator Filter
Message-ID: <002201c9f424$e615d400$4f2810ac@win.ara>

I have been trying to write a simple Python script that uses the Calculator
filter to take three scalars and produce a vector using the ParaView3.6
Python wrapping. This is trivial through the GUI Calculator Filter, but I am
having problems adding more than one scalar to the calculator object in my
script. From browsing the posts here and the C++ doxygen I've noticed the
use of AddScalarVariable and AddVectorVariable to accomplish this, but these
appear to be no longer available through the Python interface. Could someone
point out to me what I'm missing?

See below:

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
from paraview.simple import *

connection = servermanager.Connect('localhost',11111)

er = servermanager.sources.EnSightreader(CaseFileName='/.../data.case')
er.PointArrays =
['x_velocity','1','y_velocity','1','z_velocity','1','cp','1']
er.UpdatePipeline()

calc1 = servermanager.filters.Calculator(Input=er,
ResultArrayName='Velocity')
calc1.ScalarVariable = ['x_velocity','x_velocity','0']
calc1.ScalarVariable = ['y_velocity','y_velocity','0'] #This overwrites
previous declaration
calc1.ScalarVariable = ['z_velocity','z_velocity','0'] #This overwrites
previous declaration
calc1.Function = '(x_velocity)*iHat + (y_velocity)*jHat + (z_velocity)*kHat'
#Produces an error... Variable does not exist
calc1.UpdatePipeline()

You have defined everything 2D, so it is only natural that ParaView plots everything on the x-y plane.  There is a filter called Warp by Scalar that will take data defined on the plane and perturb the points in the z direction by a scalar field.  However, you have defined the two scalars you want to warp by in a vector, which further confuses ParaView.

To warp in the z direction by the components of the vector field, you will have to do something more tricky.  You can use the calculator filter to build expression that modifies the point coordinates in the z direction by one of the vector coordinates and write that to the point coordinates of the output.

To do this, add the calculator filter (third toolbar down, icon on the left).  Click the "Coordinate Results" checkbox on and set the expression to "coords + vitesse_X*kHat" to view the <x, y, U(x,y)> field.  Likewise, use the expression "coords + vitesse_Y*kHat" to view the <x, y, V(x,y)> field.

Each block is an image data. Should ParaView do a volume render on the
multiblock? The FAQ said yes.

I can reproduce this outside of my reader as well. Use the mandlebrot source
to make a 3D image the volume option is available in drop down, then use the
group dataset feature to convert this into multiblock and the volume option
disappears.

Jay,

Have you compiled with OSMesa support (an additional step to compiling with Mesa) and run with -use-offscreen-rendering flag (I can't check your script because my email client stripped it) as is described in the ParaView Wiki (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#OSMesa_support)?  It could be that pvserver is still trying to open an X connection, failing, and crashing.

Another possibility is that there are multiple OpenGL libraries on your system and multiple ones are being grabbed.  Unfortunately, this can be pretty tricky to narrow down if that is the case.  You might try building your own version of Mesa from source as you suggest.  Mesa is actually pretty easy to build, and it should not add any complexity to building ParaView, which you have to do anyway if you plan to run on a server with more than one process.

-Ken

Hello,

I tried setting up a ParaView server on a university cluster, but am getting the server to crash when remote rendering is enabled.  First off, I suppose I should ask if I am wise to do this.  I don't see any rules of thumb for how large a dataset should be for good scaling, or how fast an interconnect ParaView requires.

I generate fairly large unstructured datasets (in the range of 1-3 million nodes).  My data files are in the exodus format and generally run in the hundreds of MB.  My connection to the cluster is limited at 100 MBit, and the interconnect between cluster nodes is Gigabit.  Even if the speed is comparable, its nice enough not to need to download the datafiles to my computer.

The cluster is made up of dual socket quad core machines with pitiful on-board graphics.  I built ParaView 3.4 on this system with OpenMPI and Mesa support.

I run the server through a PBS scheduler.  Because the compute nodes are not directly connected to the outside world, and because I don't know apriori which nodes the ParaView server will run on, I use a reverse connection.  My PBS script is attached (paraview_server.sh).  It connects fine, and I am able to open a dataset.  Once I do something that requires a fair amount of work (i.e. switching from outline view to surface view) the server crashes.  I have also attached the output from the server captured by PBS (o_paraview.log).  Finally so that you can see what I've configured, I've attached the CMakeCache.txt file from my ParaView build.  Note that in my script, I've commented out the remote rendering option, it does not crash if this is left commented out.

Other relevant data is that the cluster is running Ubuntu 8.04 x86_64, and I'm running the 64bit version of ParaView on Windows Server 2008.  I'm using the Mesa library provided by the Ubuntu repositories (7.0.3).  The crash also happens identically if I run the ParaView client over a remote X session directly from the cluster, so I'm certain its not a problem with mismatched versions.

My ideas at this point are:
- try building Mesa from source (I'd rather not muck around with having the repository + custom built version however)
- live without remote rendering (which is quite slow)
- hope someone on the ParaView list has a better idea

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

There is an internal filter that takes a vtkTable and runs the FFT on all the columns of the table.  There is also a filter that takes a vtkImage and runs the FFT.  They are not exposed in the GUI, but it is pretty easy to do so if it helps.

Incidentally, I'm pretty sure that the Ensight Gold format supports fields that change over time.  Identifying temporal data in the source file is really the "right" thing to do.

Thanks for the quick reply, Ken.

I forgot to mention that the data I am working with is in Ensight Gold format and the time step values are not stored within the file. What I would like to do is be able to create an array containing these values that the FFT filter can access once I have read in my list of files into Paraview. Is this possible? Or do the time step values have to be defined explicitly in the data file?

In the meantime, I'm going to take a look at the Exodus Reader to get a better idea of how the time step values are assigned.

This filter works basically the same as the Plot Selection Over Time filter.  Load in a data set with time (you know, where when you hit play you see it animate).  Select something, then apply the FFT Over Time filter.

Currently paraview supports volume rendering only for multiblock of
unstructured datasets.
I've added a feature request to the bug tracker.

It turns out that I had to program my own filter last week, to
re-assemble multiple grids (each of them vtkUniformGrid), into one big
vtkImageData, to enable volume rendering. What I find interesting is
that you say you wrote your own parallel reader. Instead of building a
multi-block, could you not directly insert the data at the right
sub-extents of a *single* vtkImageData?

The filter I wrote did nothing more than find the global extents of each
grid, allocating a big vtkImageData, and stuffing the sub-arrays in the
right place. Sounds backwards and against what I suggest you should do
yourself. My problem is that I had to deal with AMR data in memory, with
multiple grids per level. That's also why I am not offering my filter
which relies on the AMR internal structure to find the sub-extents.
Would be useless to you.

By the way, I might be dumb, but I was never able to use the method
vtkImageData::CopyAndCastFrom() which I guess one should use. I wrote my
own loops over the I,J,K indices to make my filter work.

just 2 more cents

Thanks Berk,

using the latest cvs I have problems:

from libvtkGraphicsPython import *

ImportError: libvtkGraphicsPythonD.so.pv3.7: File not found



I guess something is wrong with my installation?

I am not sure about your scripting. I prefer doing it during import
(modified reader) due to:

    * First reading mutliblockdataset and extracting blocks afterwards
      doubles memory requirements I think?
    * I still have all parts as a mutliblockdataset i think which I do
      not like (some filters do not run ...)

Am I right about that?

I have lots of zones and need to extract them all by hand. Maybe this could be scripted. Another problem is I use filter that do not work with multiblock-datasets quite often (resampleWithDataset, AppendAttributes,...). So in my eyes most effektive way of importing would be: Not generate ONE Multiblock-Dataset but generate an individuell unstructered Dataset for each Part of the ensight-File and name them after the Ensight Part names - this will give you e.g. 80 Parts in the Tree if you have 80 Ensight parts instead of one. I would not have to extract blocks afterwards. This duplicates the whole model. Furthermore, if I need unstructed Datasets, I need to run mergeBlocks additionally, producing even more Parts. All of this would not be essential if we had such an import filter.

Thanks Jean and Utkarsh for your input, a long night last night spent
converting from multiblock to image algorithm did the trick I had to use
UPDATE_EXTENT to get the things come out right.I prefer multiblock to image
algorithm on principle that good software doesn't do things behind your
back, and my impression is that there is alot of black magic going on nehind
the scene to make it hapen for parallel image algorithm, or perhaps that's
just my stupidity, lack of documentation or some combination thereof ;)

If you run "make pdf", it will use pdflatex to create pdf's directly.  If you run "make safepdf", it will create a dvi file using latex and then derive a pdf file from that.  Although I perform just using pdflatex directly, the latter method is there because some publishers prefer that method and some LaTeX packages do not work well with pdflatex.

  From what I see the tutorial uses latex to generate dvi and then converts
to pdf.

  If it used pdflatex directly, with the hyperref package, it would be
possible to have hyperlinks inside the pdf. With the dvi->pdf converter I
don't think it's possible.

  well, it's just a note.

sorry, I was to hasty, I've noticed it myself a few minutes later

I have a debian system with texlive

The only problem I found was the absence [from debian/texlive] of 
picins.sty

I've attached the file because someone else could face the same problem. 
I've just added the file to the make directory and it runned fine.

thanks,

Ok, I've found what I was missing. ScalarVariable should accept a list with
three properties per variable ie:

calc1.ScalarVariable =
['x_velocity','x_velocity','0','y_velocity','y_velocity','0','z_velocity','z
_velocity','0']

I thought I had tried this, but I must have gotten the syntax wrong. So if
anyone else needs a pointer, then the working script is:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

from paraview.simple import *

connection = servermanager.Connect('localhost',11111)

er = servermanager.sources.EnSightreader(CaseFileName='/.../data.case')

er.UpdatePipeline()

calc1 = servermanager.filters.Calculator(Input=er,
ResultArrayName='Velocity')
calc1.ScalarVariable =
['x_velocity','x_velocity','0','y_velocity','y_velocity','0','z_velocity','z

I have been trying to write a simple Python script that uses the Calculator
filter to take three scalars and produce a vector using the ParaView3.6
Python wrapping. This is trivial through the GUI Calculator Filter, but I am
having problems adding more than one scalar to the calculator object in my
script. From browsing the posts here and the C++ doxygen I've noticed the
use of AddScalarVariable and AddVectorVariable to accomplish this, but these
appear to be no longer available through the Python interface. Could someone
point out to me what I'm missing?

See below:

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
from paraview.simple import *

connection = servermanager.Connect('localhost',11111)

er = servermanager.sources.EnSightreader(CaseFileName='/.../data.case')
er.PointArrays =
['x_velocity','1','y_velocity','1','z_velocity','1','cp','1']
er.UpdatePipeline()

calc1 = servermanager.filters.Calculator(Input=er,
ResultArrayName='Velocity')
calc1.ScalarVariable = ['x_velocity','x_velocity','0'] calc1.ScalarVariable
= ['y_velocity','y_velocity','0'] #This overwrites previous declaration
calc1.ScalarVariable = ['z_velocity','z_velocity','0'] #This overwrites
previous declaration calc1.Function = '(x_velocity)*iHat + (y_velocity)*jHat
+ (z_velocity)*kHat'
#Produces an error... Variable does not exist
calc1.UpdatePipeline()

Ah yes, the problem must have got introduced after we added support for
"Global Colors". If you change the background color from the Edit | Settings
| Colors | Background Color, then the color will be preserved.

Strange. Are you building with rpath off? You may have to set your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to where the ParaView libraries are.

> ? ?* First reading mutliblockdataset and extracting blocks afterwards
> ? ? ?doubles memory requirements I think?

Nope. I used shallow copy which copies pointers to the actual data
arrays. This would use a bit of extra memory - for some pointers
essentially. For something bigger than a few Kbytes, this would be
completely negligible. It should also be super fast as there is no
copying going on. Let me know if you run into performance problems. It
may be a bit slow to create 80 pipeline elements because it is going
to create object inspector panels for each.

> ? ? ?not like (some filters do not run ...)

Nope. The output of each filter will be a vtkDataSet - whatever you
block data type is. Note that this script works only for multi-block
datasets that are 1 layer deep (such as the one produced by Ensight).
It would not do the right thing if your multi-block tree is deeper.

Yes with turning it on I did not get it build. I have it working now by
doing an install.

Fine. I was not aware of that. It is litte slow for my ensight cases
with about 100 parts - but it works great.

Ok thanks.

Final question: How can it be run automatically after the Ensight-reader?

Hi,
 
It looks like when Python is enabled, BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is forced on in
cmake.  Is there any way to work around that and build python with static or
is that impossible?

Thanks,
Nathan.

To extend Python with static modules isn't impossible (this is how the 
"builtin" modules in Python work), but it means building your own python 
from scratch so you can link-in those static modules.

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with EnSight reader
Message-ID: <1683519694@web.de>

Hi,

I am trying to import a multi block EnSight Gold file into paraview
(latest sources from cvs, Linux x86_64). The reader works fine
and the geometry is properly displayed. However, I am missing all
the data arrays, although I don't get any error message.
I've check my ensight files with the ens_checker utility from
http://aero.ist.utl.pt/~rreis/ens_checker.64 , which tells me that
the data format is ok.
I also tried paraview 3.2 and 3.4, both on Linux 64bit
and Windows 32 bit -- the result was always the same:
no error, but no data as well. I am quite puzzled, and I would
appreciate if anyone could give me a hint.

Thanks in advance,
best regards

Johannes

 mpi pvserver and scalar opacity (3.7)
Message-ID: <4A43280D.7060609@gmail.com>

*Wait a sec... I am not sure I agree with with you after all. Upon 
closer inspection it looks to me like all of the process do end up with 
a copy of the entire dataset in memory when using legacy readers. At the 
very least in between the read and the automagic PV load balancing you 
pointed out, possibly longer depending on how long the pipeline holds 
the reader output.

It looks as though legacy files are read by PV using vtkPDataSetReader. 
I put a couple print statements that show process Id and the number of 
points read on each process during request data. See the attached patch. 
When I run multiple pvservers all processes output the same response as 
a serial run.

For example, using "CylinderQuadratic.vtk" as a test case i get:

$mpiexec -np 2 bin/pvserver --server-port=22222
Listen on port: 22222
Waiting for client...
Waiting for server...
Client connected.
1 Read 2814
0 Read 2814

while with just the builtin I get:

0 Read 2814

Subject: [Paraview] Python parser issues
Message-ID: <c9adba420906250110k70c83d4j8c25c015664f1595@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a filter than creates secondary flow variables for post processing.
They have names such as "absolute temperature".  There is a problem with the
Python parser where it will take the "abs" from absolute and interpret it as
the math function.  Is there a way around this?

Here are steps to reproduce this:

from paraview.simple import *
cone = Cone()
calc = Calculator(cone)
calc.Function = "17"
calc.ResultArrayName = "absolute"
calc2 = Calculator(calc)
calc2.Function = "(absolute) - 15"
calc2.UpdatePipeline()

The only solution I can think of is to rename the scalars that are output
from the filter.  Does anyone have any other ideas?  (In future might it be
worth allowing the user to put values in {}'s or something?)

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with EnSight reader
Message-ID: <1684428170@web.de>

Hi Zhanping,

I've figured out by now, that the problem seems to be the boundary file.
After removing the corresponding entry from the case file, the reader
works fine.
However, I will attach both files for your information. Are boundary
files supported by the reader (are they even neccessary?)

Thanks,
Johannes

Subject: [Paraview] Getting scalar values from XDMF file in filters
Message-ID: <b8f06b560906250435j19968da7k5fe705b481f44ad0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm currently using the XDMF reader to read HDF5 files and this works
fine both in serial and parallel mode. The HDF5 files come from a CFD
code and only contain the primary flow variables (as multi-block
structured 3D arrays). I have written a filter that calculates
secondary flow variables - this also works well. However, the filter
currently needs the user to input scalar values such as the specific
heat capacity in order to calculate the secondary variables. What I
would like to do is to read these in automatically from the XDMF or
HDF5 files. So my question is, is there any way of getting the XDMF
reader to read in the scalars and store them somewhere in such a way
that they are accessible from the filter? If not, I guess I will have
to modify the XDMF reader itself or open the XMDF/HDF5 file directly
in the filter.

Best wishes,

Tobias Brandvik

Upon closer inspection, you are right. This is not by intention
though. It must be a bug that got introduced into the pipeline (I
don't know when). The current behavior is for all processes to read
all of the data and then redistribution for load balancing. Therefore,
the main overhead is IO. Algorithms after the reader should still
scale close to linearly. I will fix this bug soon.

Tobias,

You could use a Grid Centered Attribute in the Xdmf file:
<Grid ...
   <Topology ...
   <Geometry ...
   <Attribute Name="Specific Heat Capacity" Center="Grid" ..

This means that there is one value for the entire Grid. The
down side is the way this is implemented in the vtkXdmfReader; it
creates a point value array and duplicates that value in the array.
To access it you would access like any other point attribute and read
the first value.

The other way (as you mentioned) is to parse the XML in your filter.
If you do it this way, you can use an <Information> element in the
Grid.

<Grid ..
   <Information Name="Specific Heat Capacity" Value="1.0" />

Then use XdmfDOM to parse the XML, find the <Information>
element, create an XdmfInformation, and then info->GetValue();
Since you'll know which element you're looking for, the easiest way
to find the element is to use the XPath notation :

(Python)
node = dom.FindElementByPath(
'/Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Information[@Name = "Specific Heat Capacity"]')

Jerry,

Many thanks for your help. The first approach works just fine and I'll
use that for now and then implement the second approach later to
reduce the memory consumption.

Cheers,
Tobias

Subject: [Paraview] Getting requested time in reader with multiple outputs
Message-ID: <C668E47E.A9CB%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I am having trouble implementing a reader that supports time data and has multiple outputs (eventually destined for ParaView).  The issue is that I get the requested update time step from the output information (as in any time-supporting reader), but I don't know which output port to get it from.  The two ports often have different time steps set in them.  The correct time is in the output from which the demand driven request comes.  But which one is that?  It changes between calls?  Is there a way to get the "real" requested time?  Is there a way to know from which output port the request comes from?

sorry, I was to hasty, I've noticed it myself a few minutes later

I have a debian system with texlive

The only problem I found was the absence [from debian/texlive] of
picins.sty

I've attached the file because someone else could face the same problem.
I've just added the file to the make directory and it runned fine.

The request vtkInformation has a key vtkExecutive::FROM_OUTPUT_PORT() which
has the output port that the request is coming from.

Johannes:

   As of right now, VTK/ParaView EnSight Readers do not support 'boundary'
files since vtkEnSightReader::ReadCaseFile(), the EnSight case file parser,
does not recognize such files.

   Thanks.

Does the request object not have a
    int port = request->Get(FROM_OUTPUT_PORT());
if so, you can do it that way.

It probably does, I was just not aware of that key.  Thanks to you an Utkarsh for pointing it out.

How is it that different ports are receiving different time requests? I need to make sure my redesigned pipeline will cope with this correctly. (what does your pipeline look like?)

I am just using it in ParaView.  Create the reader, show both outputs, hit play.  It is a demand driven pipeline and the sinks of the pipeline are visited one at a time to pull data.  So first one output is hit and then the other.  The update time is only set on the output being accessed.  I'm not sure what to do other than that.  I suppose the Executive could also set the time on all the other siblings, but what if they intentionally have a different time range?

Another issue I have run into is that the DATA_TIME_STEPS key is only set on the output attached to the output from which the request comes from.  This is easy to get around, just set DATA_TIME_STEPS on the output in the reader.  It would be nice if they all got set, but you may run into the same problems as above.

-Ken

Currently, we don't support this out-of-box but it is possible to do
with some tweaking. We do it when cross-compiling to Crays and
BlueGenes for example. You won't be able to load the resulting modules
in Python though. You will have to stick to pvpython/pvbatch/ParaView.

Hi:

Are there any performance gotchas I need to know about when dealing with 
parallel xml vtk file formats?  Right now, running pvserver on 64 cores 
(2GB/core, 1 pipe to disk for every 8 cores) it's taking literally hours 
to read 16GB of data as a .pvtr file containing a list of 192 .vtr files.

Subject: [Paraview] Default camera orbit radius
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0906261814p1eaf94danbd0b814c1a400789@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the demo procedure:
1) Create a default sphere source
2) Zoom wayyy out
3) In Animation View, change "sphere1" to "camera"
4) click the "+"

The default radius is 2.5.  When you click "play the animation", the sphere
takes up almost the entire window rather than being very small as it was
when we were zoomed out. Is there a way to make this orbit radius more
intuitive/in line with how the camera is set when the orbit is created?
There is really no way to know exactly which radius you want - it seems
natural to set the camera so the object is as big as you want it and then
say "orbit from this distance".

(I'm still whining, but the animation features are much easier than they
used to be!! Keep up the good work :) )

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0906270828t20836173j6018374404aed5f6@mail.gmail.com>

(Demo files are available here: http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Cars/ )

If I load 0.vtp and 1.vtp in paraview, set the camera focal point to
(0,0,0), the camera position to (20, -20, 5), and the viewing angle to 45,
the car in 0.vtp looks "bigger" than the car in 1.vtp. However, if I run the
script CreateThumbnails.py (in the above link) with these commands

./CreateThumbnails.py --input=0.vtp --rep=Surface --output=python_0.png
--campos=20 -20 5
./CreateThumbnails.py --input=1.vtp --rep=Surface --output=python_1.png
--campos=20 -20 5

in the resulting images car 1 looks bigger than car 0!! Is this some
perspective projection illusion? Or am I missing a camera parameter in the
script that is making it look different? I feel like I may be doing
something wrong in the script because if I run this command

./CreateThumbnails.py --input=1.vtp --rep=Surface --output=1test.png
--campos=1 -1 .25

(the difference is that campos is scaled), the exact same image is produced
(as python_1.png).  It seems like this one should be a zoomed in version as
the camera should be very close to the car.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

David

Hi,

Could someone please tell what the name of the event is that is
triggered in ParaView (top of cvs build) when the cell/point array
status (properties tab of the object inspector) is changed after a file
has been initially loaded and one hits the "Apply" button again?

It's neither RequestData nor ProcessRequest, at least not for my custom
reader which is based on the vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm class. It does
work, though, for the ExodusIIReader and other built-in readers.

Thanks a lot.

is there any vtk- or paraview-compliant tool/source code that deals with feature detection and/or topology visualization in vector fields?
Thanks in advance for your help.

Are you sure you are calling this->Modified() in the callback in your
reader where the array status is being set?

It looks like perhaps CMake did not generate a header file correctly.  You might try doing a clean build.  That is, delete your binary directory and make a new build from scratch.

Hi,
My data is 3D volume. Each voxel includes 4 components: RGBA. I can use
vtkFixedPointVolumeRaycastMapper to render it, but need a opactiy

maps intensity to opacity. What I want to do is to map some region to

Subject: [Paraview] Any performance hints or tips for .pvtr reader?
In-Reply-To: <4A44EC5F.5070906@scinet.utoronto.ca>
Message-ID: <C66E2E4E.DDE3%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The parallel VTK XML file formats are honestly not that optimized for use on parallel file systems.  Inefficiencies in reading can come from many places and I don't think you have provided enough information to be totally sure on the problem (even if I was an expert, which I am not), but horrendously bad performance like that you are seeing usually happens when a bunch of processes make lots of small reads.  The file system gets inundated with tons of file requests.  In response, the read head on each cylinder starts moving back in forth trying to satisfy all of these requests, and your performance is now dead.

Efficient parallel reading has nice, organized requests that have large, contiguous reads that can be streamed off of the disk cylinders very efficiently.  The easiest way to do that is to simply match files to processes.  That is, organize the data so that each process only has to do one read from a single file.  The easiest way to do that is to read in your data into ParaView or VTK on 64 processes as you are doing now (pay the time price) and then write it back out in a new .pvtr file.  The new .pvtr file should contain 64 .vtr files.  Loading that back onto 64 processes should be quick.

to read 16GB of data as a .pvtr file containing a list of 192 .vtr files.

Ah, I see - thanks Ken. I'm not sure what I thought ResetCamera was doing? I
guess it was just lingering from some example script that I had worked from.
As you suspected, the images of the cars are now the correct size in the
python renderings and they also match the Paraview renderings.

Thanks again,

David

Still easier when possible is to run the viz task on 192 cores, matching 
one file per core; I've done that and performance improves but not 
enormously.   It's an inconvenience, but I just wanted to know if there 
was anything in particular I needed to be aware of.

Yes, well, that's a separate issue that I'm having; I can reliably kill 
paraview dead by trying to `Save Data', either immediately after the 
pvtr data has been read as cell data or after converting it to point 
data.  If I just try to save  smaller data sets resulting from the 
visualization process (eg, generated contours) I have no problems with 
that.  There's nothing obviously weird about the data set, as I have no 
issues plotting or manipulating the data.  This was true with PV 3.4 and 
with a current (eg, this morning) cvs build.

There is no silver bullet here.  You would probably get better performance
by loading everything on one process and distributing it to the rest.  If
you have a serial file system like nfs that might be as good as you can do.
If you have a parallel file system that has at least as many independent
drives as pipes (1 per 8 cores from your previous email) and the data is
lain out conveniently, you would probably get optimal performance reading
into 8 processes and distributing to the rest.

The .pvtr reader is nowhere near sophisticated enough to handle this well
and the file format is not well suited to implement these optimizations.
There are some file format libraries that try to resolve these issues.  If
you plan to continue to generate and analyze data of this nature, you might
consider using one of these.

My guess is that the operation you are choosing is requesting ghost cells,
which in turn is causing the reader to read all of the data over again
(which, as you attest takes over an hour).  The Cell Data to Point Data and
Contour filters do this.  If you requested to save ghost cells after the
pvtr reader, then that would also cause a re-read.

I don't explicitly request ghost cells (in fact, at the dialog box I 
explicitly request zero) but as you point out many things may be going 
on beneath the hood.  But in any case it's not merely a delay that I 
see, it's a crash - bus error, fail.

Thanks a lot for the hint!
In the vtkXMLReader class I found everything I needed to set up the missing
callback in my reader. Now, my GMV file format reader is working smoothly.

We do plan to address such usability issues with the camera animation
for 3.8. Please feel free to report such issues on the the bug tracker
so that we can address them.

Using that hint I did:

  - rm -rf all dirs

  - fresh checkout

  - ccmake ../ParaView3, make and the error persisted

  but the error persists :|

Can you check is a file named VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h
was generated. Look at it's contents. Does it look something as such:

#ifndef vtkSocketCommunicatorHash
# define vtkSocketCommunicatorHash "5827858305bd3f3ec0c8b5e8836b390f"

What version of CMake are you using (cmake --version)?

Also, the file

   VTK/Parallel/CMakeFiles/vtkParallel.dir/build.make

should appear in the build tree.  Please post it.

Please run these commands by hand:

cd /home/rreis/on_hold/src/ParaView3.X86_64/VTK/Parallel && ../../bin/vtkHashSource /home/rreis/on_hold/src/ParaView3/VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx vtkSocketCommunicatorHash

and post the output.  This output is supposed to be redirected into
"vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h" (there is a rule in build.make for it).

Ah, so the executable fails to run because it cannot find shared
libraries it needs.  Did you change any RPATH options when configuring
paraview in ccmake?  Please post your CMakeCache.txt file.

What is the output of

$ readelf -d ../../bin/vtkHashSource

?

Those were supposed to be arguments to the first command, but that
doesn't matter since it couldn't run anyway.

I always set VTK_USE_RPATH NO

because if not I'm unable to install it to other dir (I usually use 
/opt/paraview).

Okay, I've committed a fix to make vtkHashSource always use RPATH.
It is not installed and it only needs to run from the build tree.

just to make shure, I think I might have induced you in error, I meant

RPATH OFF

(it was NO of NOT and not NO of dislexic ON)

  my apologies for the possible confusion

I understood.  The problem is that vtkHashSource needs to run at build
time and it needs to find libvtksys.so when it runs.  Without RPATH
it cannot find the shared library it needs.  The fix is to use RPATH
for that executable regardless of the value of VTK_USE_RPATH.

A "full" fix would be to create a launcher for the tool just like those
created for the main paraview executables.  However, the executable is
not installed so that is overkill.

Subject: [Paraview] Streaming ParaView
Message-ID: <4A4A7131.8030701@cora.nwra.com>

Okay, with 2.6.0 there are now 3 applications:

-- Application: Standard ParaView Client enabled
-- Application: OverView Informatics Client enabled
-- Application: Streaming ParaView Application enabled

I'm packaging for Fedora - does it make sense to build all three?  Are 
they mutually exclusive?  Would I need to run 3 builds?  Not that with 
the above I get:

CMake Warning (dev) at Applications/StreamingParaView/CMakeLists.txt:181 
(ADD_EXECUTA
BLE):
   Policy CMP0002 is not set: Logical target names must be globally unique.
   Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0002" for policy details.  Use the 
cmake_policy
   command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

Anywhere that talks about this?

Also, any problem with building all of the plugins (including 
"Streaming")?  Any incompatibilities?

Thanks!

Thanks for doing the packaging work Orion!

I recommend not enabling either of the new applications, nor the
non-default plugins.

To answer your questions in more detail:

One configure and make is sufficient to build all three. I am unsure
about installation. I believe make install places all three in the
same directory, but I know that at least on OS-X you need to run
separate scripts to package the standard ParaView client and
StreamingParaview.

OverView and StreamingParaView are both in Pre-Alpha development
stage. At least for StreamingParaView this means that it is too
unstable to bother packaging. People should be brave enough to compile
from source if they want to try it, which is why it is not enabled by
default. The OverView developers can correct me if the same is not
true for OverView.

Subject: [Paraview] Invalid array name
Message-ID: <77ac66790906301505y541fba1dof4b491fbc824672b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to apply the calculator filter on the results of some 3D numerical
simulation but keep getting the following error message (it appears about
fourty times in the Ouput Messages window):

ERROR: In
/home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/Graphics/vtkArrayCalculator.cxx,
line 305
vtkArrayCalculator (0x882fbf8): Invalid array name: VelSca0

About the data: I have opened a file Conc_Anim.pvd with one float (Conc_0)
and another file VelScalar_Anim.pvd with three floats (VelSca0, VelSca1, and
VelSca2) for the velocities in x, y, and z direction. To be able to do some
calculations with data from both files, I used Group Datasets. The
calculation should be something like

Conc_0*(VelSca0*iHat+VelSca1*jHat+VelSca2*kHat)

though the error message appears whatever I enter as a formula.

Does anybody have any idea what went wrong here?

Thanks,
Michael

Hello,

I'm not familiar with all of the plugins in paraview, but I am wondering wh=
ether I need to write lower order elements in my vtk files for flexibility.

All of my data is point based.

I am thinking that:

if 1d:
    Write Lines
if 2d:
    Write Triangles
if 3d:
    Write Tetrahedron

Would there be any reason to write lines and triangles in 3d to the output =
file?

Thanks,

Juan

Hello Ken,<BR>
<BR>
I was asking the first question.=A0 I implemented the vtk file format for a=
n unstructured grid using:<BR>
type 10 elements for 3D (tetrahedra)<BR>
type 5 elements for 2D (triangles)<BR>
type 3 elements for 1D (lines)<BR>

Each of these elements are defined in terms of points.<BR>

My data only exists on points (point data).<BR>

Is there any reason why I would want to put the lower dimensional elements =
