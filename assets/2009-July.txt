To reproduce:

   - Sphere source, click apply
   - Colour sphere by normals (point normals, not cell normals)
   - Text source, click apply
   - Move text and the sphere disappears

Can someone else check this for me? - is it just my graphics card?  (I'm
using the latest CVS version)

Paul

Hi all,

I want to apply the calculator filter on the results of some 3D numerical
simulation but keep getting the following error message (it appears about
fourty times in the Ouput Messages window):

ERROR: In
/home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/Graphics/vtkArrayCalculator.cxx,
line 305
vtkArrayCalculator (0x882fbf8): Invalid array name: VelSca0

About the data: I have opened a file Conc_Anim.pvd with one float (Conc_0)
and another file VelScalar_Anim.pvd with three floats (VelSca0, VelSca1, and
VelSca2) for the velocities in x, y, and z direction. To be able to do some
calculations with data from both files, I used Group Datasets. The
calculation should be something like

Conc_0*(VelSca0*iHat+VelSca1*jHat+VelSca2*kHat)

though the error message appears whatever I enter as a formula.

Does anybody have any idea what went wrong here?

Thanks,
Michael

Hello Michael,

could you post a short example script ? Maybe you do something wrong with the
AddScalar-Property?

  Hi

  Maybe this could be of interest, this is a list of debian packages you 
need to have on your system for properly compile paraview:

  #Global

  apt-get install libphonon-dev libphonon4 libqt4-assistant qt4-dev-tools \
  libqt4-core libqt4-gui qt4-qmake \
  libxt-dev \
  g++ gcc cmake-curses-gui

  # With MPI (using openmpi, you can use any other flavour)

  apt-get install openmpi-common openmpi-bin  libopenmpi-dev

  # with Python

  apt-get install python2.5-dev

Hi Praveen,

I am copying my reply to the paraview mailing list. Please send
further questions there. To subscribe, go to
http://public.kitware.com/mailman/listinfo/paraview. You can search
the archives at http://paraview.org/paraview/help/mailing.html.

Unfortunately, we don't support LSM files out-of-box. If there is VTK
reader already implemented, integrating it to ParaView should be
fairly easy using plugins. There is a page on the Wiki explaining
plugins: http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo
The plugin wizard may also be useful: http://pluginwizard.mirarco.org/

I think Group Datasets is causing the issue. It creates a multi-block
dataset that contains all of its inputs. That still means that blocks
do not share arrays. Do these datasets have the same topology (mesh)?
If they do, you should be able to use Append Attributes instead. If
they do not, you have to resample one mesh over the other using the
Resample with Dataset filter. I am not sure how clear I was so please
let me know if I am not making sense :-)

Subject: [Paraview] how to store label fields
Message-ID: <1246464473.24789.17.camel@x60>

When storing my label field as imagedata I get unwanted interpolation if
I e.g. cut through the volume. Switching the interpolation off results
in funny bad looking triangles. What's the best/intended/practiced way
of storing (integer) label fields? Image data is point centered while
label fields are clearly cell centered. As I see the only alternative is
StructuredGrid, but functions like contouring or resampling require
point data anyway. So what's better: store my labels as image (point)
data and compromise display (unwanted interpolation) or go for
structured grid and compromise size of the file and needed conversions
to image data anyway?

I put my reader plugin in c:\paraview\installs\3.7\bin\plugins\gdareader, it
doesn't load by paraview?? There are other plugins there such as Moments and
CSCS etc. Is this supposed to work? I also tries c:\Documents and
Settings\Bam\Application Data\ParaView, doesn't work either?

Question is can reader plugin be loaded by paraview or user has to load
explicitly?

It is not a debug build. I am also using a linux 64 bit platform.
Maybe I should mention that I am using Qt 4.5.0
Here is the output when using gdb:

Subject: [Paraview] bug in ParaView 3.6.1: no tube-filter in menu
Message-ID: <4A4C768F.7020402@gmx.de>

Hi,

I compiled ParaView 3.6.1 (using tag 'ParaView3_6') and cannot find the
tube-filter in Menu->Filter->Alphabetic.

If I compile ParaView 3.7 (using tag 'ParaView3) the tube-filter is
available.

I hope that's only a bug in ParaView 3.6.1

Greetings
Jens

Message-ID: <C8D3F57E07352C4B9C8E779E2B27B9EA0EA13B@LAXA.intra.cea.fr>


Hi all,

I am work with Paraview (3.7) and with linux.
I had done on Paraview to load VTK multifigure and clic a play button to see animation.
I would like to do a same on Pythyn with paraview and I don't know how to do the animation.


from paraview.simple import *
Connect('localhost')

f = ["coupe01.vtk", "coupe02.vtk", "coupe03.vtk", "coupe04.vtk"]
readers = []
for f in files:
    reader = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=f)
    readers.append(reader)

Show(readers[0])
Render()
 
# Create an animation scene
scene = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
# Add one view
scene.ViewModules = [GetActiveView()]

# Create a cue to animate the StartTheta property
cue = servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue()
cue.AnimatedProxy = GetActiveSource()

# Add it to the scene's cues
scene.Cues = [cue]
....

After, I don't know how I would done ?
Do you have a small pyphon script to explain or if somebody can explained me how I can do.

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Message-ID: <6c915be80907020337u3f9d33cdg71d93bc4c22a8e3f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am running computation of a scalar field u(rho,theta,z) in cylindrical
coordinates. Since I have no dependence on theta, I run my computations at
theta=0 and produce a vtk file of u(rho,0,z).

Is it possible to replicate u(rho,0,z) so as to visualise u(rho,theta,z)
with theta spanning 0 to 2*pi? In other words, I am searching for a
"Reflect" filter that would work in the theta direction.

Thanks a lot.

Daniele

I just checked that PV from CVS addresses exactly this issue, so I am
apparently not alone in my considerations. PV 3.4 will load a label
field and interpolate the colors when viewing slices (thus destroying
the image). PV CVS ignores interpolation settings and displays my labels
correctly (without interpolation). So I assume somebody realized the
problem recently too and corrected it. So I conclude that ImageData is
still the right choice for discrete label fields (and not
StructuredGrid), but one has to rely on the latest version. Please
correct me if I am wrong.

  In newer paraview versions the background colour always defaults to 
"default" although I change it. the old behaviour was nicer, it would 
choose the previous colour has default.

  I think I saw this filled as a bug in mantis and was hoping to see it 
fixed but has it didn't happen..

There is an environment variable called PV_PLUGIN_PATH that allows you to
add directory paths to search for plugins when Paraview starts. Set this to
the directory where your plugin is stored and restart Paraview. It should
now be automatically loaded e.g.

!#/usr/bin/bash
#your plugin will be stored within /explicit/directory/path/
export PV_PLUGIN_PATH=/explicit/directory/path/

This confuses me. The slice filter (vtkCutter) is not supposed to
interpolate any cell-centered data whether it is integer or double. To
my knowledge, there has been no bug that changed this. Can you send me
a small dataset that I can reproduce this with?

What about Transform? I can translate and rotate. You may have to play

Qt 4.5 is not officially supported for 3.6 releases so you may run
into issues (not sure this is one of those). However since I can't
reproduce it, can you try if it's reproducible with Qt 4.3.5?

Berk,

Example data: http://otoro.itis.ethz.ch/~dominik/tmp/head_eye.vti

The data is point-centered. I was raising up a question if I should not
store my label fields (from segmentation) as cell centered StructureGrid
instead, because PV interpolates the colors regardless of the states of
'interpolate colors / Goraud/Flat'. But the PV-CVS is no longer
interpolating integer point data (still insensitive to the mentioned
states). So something changed (for good), I was asking what and why.

As to the contour filter - contouring such (point based) label field
results in an unstructured grid, so for arbitrary angles the voxel
structure is anyway lost, thus interpolation makes sense. If however
switched off it seems to correctly show (crippled) triangles.

However, converting point data to cell data on my label field above
results in interpolation again, that can not be switched off - probably
because some interpolation is used during the transfer. So something is
probably still not OK here.

So a bottom line: is it finally OK to store label fields as ImageData
(where only POINT_DATA is allowed) or do I take StructuredGrid instead
and store the labels explicitly as CELL_DATA?

regards,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview]  periodic data in ParaView
Message-ID: <4A4CC6A1.8050303@mpie.de>

Hello,

I have two vtk files, one containing scalar and vector data on a
rectilinear grid and one for a polygonal mesh (points and cells defining
a closed, triangulated surface). Now I want to color the cells with the
fluid properties. This is possible with the filter "resample with dataset".
However, some of the points are located outside the range of the
rectilinear grid. In my computer simulation, the grid is periodic, i.e.
the fluid properties repeat periodically, and I only save one elementary
cell to the disk. ParaView doesn't know that and assumes that the fluid
properties are zero, whenever I am not inside the elementary cell.
Except for changing the vtk file for the fluid properties, is there any
way to tell ParaView that it should use a periodic representation of the
data?

Thanks,
Timm

Hi Berk,

yes, thanks, I was looking for "Generate Tubes"

wish:
I would like to see a "Search"-Funktion, which can handle keywords and
(more important) which can give me a hint how to transform my data, so
it will be accepted by the desired filter.

I have a filter doing cell selection from an array of material ids. The
usage pattern is to select a single material id, i.e. a single number.

To debug and check my filter's output, I ran the same with the Selection
Inspector. However, ParaView only enables THRESHOLDS selection in the
Selection Inspector. Is there a reason the alternative, selection by
VALUES (described in a very good article on page 3 of The Source, April
2009) is not available?

I am running into a problem with my filter's CELL selection. If I use
THRESHOLDS, and set the SelectionList to an array of size 2 (both values
being equal since I want to select a single material ID), the filter
executes really fast and gives the correct result. If instead, I use
VALUES, and set the SelectionList to an array of size 1, execution is
extremely slow. I measured
2.4 secs for 27,000 cells
253 secs for 270,000 cells
and a seg fault for 2,700,000 cells.

Every time I tried to stop execution, I am inside the QuickSort class.
Are there issues with that? Isn't the complexity of the sorting supposed
to be n*log(n)? that is not what I see when I get execution times from
2.4 to 253 secs when going from 27000 to 270000 cells.

Note that I get the correct results with VALUE-selection (even though
very slowly), identical to the selection by THRESHOLDS (except for the
last case with the seg fault)

any experience from other users?

If you hit "Ctrl+Space" or "Alt+Space" a seach dialog should popup
where you can seach for filters/sources using their names. So in your
case, as you start typing "tube" you should see the "Generate Tubes"
filter listed.

For Thresholds selections it runs vtkExtractSelectedThresholds, which
has the simpler implementation. It simply iterates through the data
looking at the values.

For Value selections, it ends up running vtkExtractSelectedIDs. In
that filter, a copy of the data array is first sorted by value, and
then searched. The copy is supposed to stick around for the later
calls, which makes sorting it worthwhile in the long run. I assume the
copy is not sticking around for some reason in your case, or less
likely that the sort algorithm itself is running out of memory.

Any help?

Yes, I knew about that, however it is no good option. Why? Because, I have
multiple builds of ParaView, 3.4 and 3.7 and soon to be 3.6 we hope ;) If I
use the environment variable then 3.4 will attempt to load plugin from 3.7
install and vise versa, and this is no good to me.

I understand from the Wiki that ParaView searches these directories and even
the Tools->Manage PLugins dialog claims that ParaView automatically searches
c:\paraview\installs\3.7\bin\plugins\gdareader,  c:\Documents and
Settings\Bam\Application Data\ParaView,

I ask you again, is this supose to work??
I see many plugins in folders in the installs\3.7\bin\plugins folder, I
think that ParaView requires these no? I don't see any of them loaded
automatically :(
Is it a bug , or I just do wrong things?

Experts plz HLP ;)

the way on windows unix line feeds are used, not sure if that is
desireable), while the legacy file clearly is a binary file.

If I underrstand the XML reader/writer tuple correctly here is a potential
performance caveat when using the XML reader/writer tuple: Be sure file is
really binary!!!!

When ParaView saves data as vti XML binary, the file is not really binary at
all but rather base 64 encoded, utf8. This combination could not be slower!
As the reader reads each character writen this way, it first tests to see
how many bytes the character has, then does the base 64 conversion to native
float/double. Operation thus on each character is of course a trerrible idea
if one cares about performance!


delete the pipeline
Open both files
tools->timer log

You will likely see that the binary legacy file loads twice as fast as the
XML.

Experts, plz verify I am not smoking crack
Thx

OK, I think I understand now. This should work irrespective of ParaView version:

- Turn off "Interpolate Scalars"
- Change Interpolation to Flat

It is possible that there was some bug that prevented something from
working before.

If you have cell centered data, ParaView should never interpolate
colors. Can you send me instructions to reproduce this?

Yep - this only works in CVS and was a reason for my confusion. I still
wonder who noticed it as the ML archives go silent about it.

Use the dataset I sent you. Apply pointDataToCellData. Cut to you
liking. Observe the interpolation.

Dear ParaView developers,

I downloaded paraview.app-3.4.0-Leopard-x86.dmg<http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.4/paraview.app-3.4.0-Leopard-x86.dmg>from
the download page, which according to the download page are built
using
the OpenMPI that is bundled with MacOS Leopard, and I want to run it in
distributed stand-alone mode (as described in section 12.2 of the ParaView
Guide) on my 8-core Mac Pro running Leopard (10.5.7).

Thanks everyone.  It was my fault as I made a few changes to the source code
in order to work with an old Solaris X Server where I removed some calls to
glGenTextures.  Now I just need another workaround.....

Subject: [Paraview] Having problem with (...) over time filters
Message-ID: <ce5dae9f0907030208r29a12fads79362b30e8081e36@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a vtk file series on which I would like to perform FFT for example.
I load th file series, select a few points using the "select points through"
utility, and then try to use either the FFT or the plot over time filters
and they bothe come up with the following error (which crashes ParaView) :

Warning: In
/users/boreas01/jacques/PARAVIEW/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkDataArrayTemplate.txx,
line 456
vtkFloatArray (0x283fe10): Input and output component sizes do not match.


Warning: In
/users/boreas01/jacques/PARAVIEW/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkDataArrayTemplate.txx,
line 450
vtkFloatArray (0x283ff90): Input and output array data types do not match.


Anyone knows how to bypass this ?

Cheers,
JAcques

Is there an example anywhere of adding a new window - like for example 
the SelectionInspector, Statistcs view or even the  animation viewer.

I'd like a custom window like these, but added as a plugin - if such an 
example exists, could someone point me to it please

Thanks

Also note that under ParaView3/Examples there are far more plugin
examples than described on the Wiki so it's worthwhile to take a  peek
there as well time and again as they tend to be updated as new
functionality is added to the plugins/branding.

Actually, that's not a bad idea. I was always wondering how could we
make this obvious. I guess the solution was just as obvious! :). Will
do.

Doesn't the following work?

If it does take a look at the implementation in

Hi Michael,

Unfortunately, there are no filters that can append attributes when
inputs are multi-block datasets (which is what the pvd reader
produces). Fortunately, the Programmable Filter can easily do this. I
am attaching a script that should do what you want. I tested it in
serial and parallel. To use, load the two datasets, select them both,
apply the Programmable Filter, copy the script I am attaching and
apply. I tested this with the CVS version but it should work with 3.4
or 3.6. You should be able to create a custom filter from the
Programmable Filter that you created. If that doesn't work, please let
me know so that I can file a bug report.

Best,
-berk

def add_arrays(output, input):
    ipd = input.GetPointData()
    opd = output.GetPointData()
    for i in range(ipd.GetNumberOfArrays()):
        opd.AddArray(ipd.GetArray(i))

    icd = input.GetCellData()
    ocd = output.GetCellData()
    for i in range(icd.GetNumberOfArrays()):
        ocd.AddArray(icd.GetArray(i))

input1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
input2 = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 1)

Message-ID: <BAY109-W765BEAB6CF3B8610C7F03B22C0@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I have a distance that can be set either as an absolute value or relative to the dataset extents. How may I specify a control on the valid values either in the range [0, min extent] or in the range [0, 1], depending on which unit has been chosen?

    <IntVectorProperty name="DistanceUnit" label="Distance Unit" command="SetDistanceUnit" number_of_elements="1" default_values="2">
      <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
        <Entry value="0" text="Absolute"/>
        <Entry value="1" text="Relative"/>
      </EnumerationDomain>
      <Documentation>
        This property indicates the unit for specifying the distance. The Absolute (0) unit is the real distance. The Relative (1) unit means a percentage of the minimum dataset's spatial extent (hence it must be in the range [0, 1]).
      </Documentation>
    </IntVectorProperty>

    <DoubleVectorProperty name="Distance" label="Distance" command="SetDistance" number_of_elements="1" default_values="0.1">
      <BoundsDomain name="bounds" mode="scaled_extent" scale_factor="0.5">
        <RequiredProperties>
          <Property name="Input" function="Input"/>
        </RequiredProperties>
      </BoundsDomain>
      <Documentation>
        The value of this property specifies the distance.
      </Documentation>       
    </DoubleVectorProperty>

Hi Bam,

You are partially correct. The output is the base64 encoding of
compressed binary data (not utf8 encoded). Still, your point is valid
and writing data this was is slow (and stupid). The XML writers can
write data in a few ways:

* Data is inlined in the XML section - the data, if binary, has to be
base64 encoded in this case because XML parsers cannot handle raw
binary data. I don't know why we even support this mode. Don't use it.
* Data is appended at the end of the XML section. Here you have the
option of compressing (using zlib) and base64 encoding the data. Why
would you do that? Maybe you want to upload it somewhere as valid XML
or something. I don't know.

The issue was the fact that we did not expose the right options to
write data as appended, raw binary without compression and encoding. I
fixed this by exposing these setting in the user interface. As of 5
minutes ago, the default behavior is to write the data as appended
raw. I tested the performance. It is still not as good as the old
writers due to reasons too long to explain here but it is close. If
you want to try it out, you will have to build ParaView from source
using the cvs version.

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] how to run ParaView 3.4.0 on MacOS Leopard in
	parallel?

Hi, thanks for all of your responses.  It looks like the ParaView Guide book
is out-of-date, as it tells you that the client can be launched directly
with "mpirun -np <xx> paraview" as an alternative to running pvserver
separately.

Now that we are using pvserver, it is partially working.

We installed pvserver (in /usr/local/bin), and then used the "Connect"
option in the File menu to connect to a server running on "localhost" (Add
Server, then specifying Client/Server connecting to localhost port 11111,
launching pvserver with "/usr/bin/mpirun -np 7 /usr/local/bin/pvserver"),
and connected to the server successfully.

Unfortunately, using pvserver on the same (8-processor) machine seems to be
significantly slower and more buggy than running the client by itself (we
tried -np 7, and also -np 2), for a fairly large (million-point)
unstructured-grid dataset that takes about 20 seconds for volume rendering
with one processor.  We had thought that this problem would be big enough to
benefit from at least using a couple of CPUs.

When we connect to pvserver on the same machine, it not only takes much
longer to render (regardless of the number of CPUs we launch pvserver on),
but there are also some weird screen artifacts where it seems to open up a
second rendering window (with no controls or window decorations, just a
square with a duplicate of the rendering contents) that we cannot get rid
of.  At that point the program freezes.

Any suggestions?  We are using the precompiled paraview 3.4.0 from the
paraview web site, compiled for MacOS Leopard/Intel, running on an 8-cpu
MacPro with 16GB of RAM.

Thanks,
Karen Lee

Hi Berk,

I was single stepping through the code and it looked to me like xpat is
infact treating the characters as utf8, even though ParaView is only using
ascii characters. There is a test on each character. But this won't matter
anymore as your fixes should remove xpat from the equation when writing
binary data. As a new user I am finding the list invaluable. Thanks so much
for you help!

Hi Karen,

What file format are you using?

There are a few factors here. First, we have to make sure that the
file format you are using is suitable for parallel processing - not
all formats are. Second, if you are using a GPU based algorithm such
as projected tetrahedra (which is the default), you are likely to see
a decrease in performance of volume rendering rather than increase.
This is because all of the processes will be using 1 GPU and the
resource contention that this causes is likely to make rendering
slower. Assuming that the data is distributed properly, algorithms
should run faster though. If you have multiple GPUs, it is also
possible to make rendering scale to an extent but we haven't
experimented with multiple GPU on one machine yet.

Hi Berk,

Thanks for your help. Our file format is .vtu, and there's only one GPU on
our machine. I'm wondering if there is some way we can tell which operations
execute on the GPU and which on the CPU, so that we could try a different
operation in order to see a parallel speedup.
Also, have you guys looked into having the client and server processes
detect the situation where the GPU is shared between them, and in that case
not attempt to parallelize GPU-based operations? Our situation of a
multi-CPU system with a single GPU is very common, and it would be nice to
get some benefit for CPU-based operations in this case without penalizing
GPU-based ones.

Thanks again for your help,
Karen

Today I had some time to set up Qt 4.3.5, and I had the same crash.
Since this problem is not reproducible by you, it may be something in
the way I have set up things.

As soon as 3.6 is released I will try the official binaries.

If you could do a debug build and then post the stack trace that would  
be. Of great help to identify the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Need help with UpdateExtents and RequestedExtents
Message-ID: <811a1f290907051154j1d2cd8e5hc69b7beb715759ec@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to update a previous ParaView plugin and I am running into
some trouble with the UpdateExtents and RequestedExtents. My problem
is that when my plugin runs the RequestInformation iI read from the
file to extract the origin, spacing and extent information. I then set
them into the pipeline as such:

outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), origin, 3 );
outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::SPACING(), this->CurrentScalingFactor, 3 );
outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
this->PixelActual, 6 );

That all seems to work fine. My plugin loads up a custom gui to allow
the user to select a sub-volume to actually render as the volume is
quite large and can not be rendered in 32 bit clients or even some 64
bit clients for that matter.

So I have the Custom plugin GUI talking to my custom reader so that
values entered into the GUI are available during the RequestData()
method of my reader class. Now here is the fun:

 This code:

vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
vtkImageData* output =
vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
vtkTypeInt32 updateExtent[6];
if (outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))
{
// Get the requested data extent.
updateExtent[0] =
(outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[0];
updateExtent[1] =
(outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[1];
updateExtent[2] =
(outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[2];
updateExtent[3] =
(outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[3];
updateExtent[4] =
(outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[4];
updateExtent[5] =
(outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[5];
}

will always return the entire volume space which I guess I can
understand as that is what I put into those values during the
RequestInformation. I was merrily just using the values that get
pushed into my class via the custom GUI text fields. These values will
differ from the UPDATE_EXTENT. I setup the output with the smaller
extents and now my "RequestData()" is executed at least twice. I have
seen this before and have no idea what I do to solve it.'

 How do I tell the pipeline that the user is requesting a smaller
sub-volume? Are there some special variables I can use? or something
along those lines?


   Also during the copying of the data from the file into the
vtkImageData object I get any number of errors:

Warning: In /Users/Shared/OpenSource/vtk-5.4.2/Filtering/vtkDataSet.cxx,
line 414
vtkImageData (0x353d380): Point array RoboMet Voxels with 1
components, has 0 tuples but there are only -208926896 points

Here are some stats about what I am trying to produce:

MicronVOI: 46979.1 47526.7 48347.6 49080.1 492 495.2
MicronActual: 46979.1 48525.1 48347.6 50078.9 490 510
Requested Extent: 0 7440 0 8330 490 510
PixelActual: 0 7440 0 8330 490 510
PixelVOI: 0 2631 0 3520 0 3
dims: 2632 3521 4

All that seems correct and the data seems to copy from the file into
the array but then I get the error above and ParaView will just crash.

This is all with PV CVS, OS X intel 10.5.7, Xcode 3.1.3 tooling, cmake
2.6.4 and GCC 4.2 compiler.


Any help is appreciated.

Set WHOLE_EXTENT to your desired subset during in RequestInformation. 
Honor UPDATE_EXTENT in your RequestData pass. It will all work out.

RequestInformation runs every time after user clicks apply in ParaView 
so what ever values they choose will be passed into the pipeline each time.

Subject: [Paraview] Block names for multi-block data set
Message-ID: <000201c9fe23$fb87c7e0$4f2810ac@win.ara>


I've written a reader that takes a mesh file, stores zones within it as a
vtkUnstructuredGrid and then stores them all in a vtkMultiBlockDataSet. When
I go to extract blocks after reading the mesh in, I am faced with a list of
each block number all called vtkUnstructuredGrid. Is it possible to assign
names to each of the blocks within the reader? I can't seem to find any
function to do so in the respective vtk class lists.

I believe you need this line:


volumes->GetMetaData(grid_number)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"grid-name");

I have tried to compile Davids example plugin with Visual Studio 2008 
Express Edition.
cmake and the compilation work without any warnings, but linking fails 
with unresolved external symbol errors.

Here is my system configuration:

Windows XP SP3 32-Bit,
cmake 2.6.4
Paraview 3.6.1 (from cvs)
Qt 4.3.5
VS 2008 Express 32 Bit

Here are the (shortened) error messages:

------ Build started: Project: Controlslugin, Configuration: Debug Win32 
------
Linking...
    Creating library C:\Panel\Panel\Build\Debug\Controlslugin.lib and 
object C:\Panel\Panel\Build\Debug\Controlslugin.exp

void __thiscall pqControls::connectToRepresentation(class

pqControlsImplementation.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol 
"public: __thiscall pqControls::pqControls(class QWidget *)" 
(??0pqControls@@QAE at PAVQWidget@@@Z) referenced in function "public:

I would guess, that this has to do with the sequence of the obj-Files 
linked together.
I'm rather new with Visual Studio. Could somebody point me in the right 
direction?  (Or are there known limitations with the Epress Edition of VS?)

TIA,

Kalle.

BTW, the build of Qt and paraview with VS 2008 Express worked without 
any problems...

Awesome. That did the trick. Just a few outstanding issues left and
this plugin will be nicely updated. Again, thanks for the info.

Oops, I should have looked at your original script more closely.
LegacyVTKReader can read multiple files on it's own, you don't have to
create separate readers for each file.
Try the following:

from paraview.simple import *
Connect('localhost')

files = ["/home/myrrha/test4/coupe01.vtk",
"/home/myrrha/test4/coupe02.vtk",
"/home/myrrha/test4/coupe03.vtk",
"/home/myrrha/test4/coupe04.vtk"]

reader = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=files)

Show(reader)
Render()

AnimateReader(reader)

Alas the crash seems to  be coming from Qt with no section in the call
stack that can help us identify what in ParaView source is causing the
problem. I guess we'll wait till you give the official binaries a try.

Message-ID: <9BC9FBFF861642438F019598EBB769AD2DE316377D@DU-EXC-MAIL.empa.emp-eaw.ch>

Hello everybody

I'm using Paraview 3.4.0 to visualize 2D/3D geometrical models of systems made of spherical particles.
My input file contains the information about a VTK unstructured grid.
Each node of the grid is the center of one spherical particle.
Associate to each node there is a scalar parameter representing the radius of the particle.

after importing the VTK unstructured grid dataset I applied to it the sphere glyph filter.
I choose to scale each glyph according to the scalar PointData "radius" in order to visualize different sphere according to their size.

Considering that a value "Radius" is also defined in the "Glyph Type - Sphere2 section of the filter's "Properties" tab, which will be the final actual size for each spherical particle ?

I mean, how does Paraview handle simultaneously there two pieces of information in the case of multiple spherical glyphs with different size ?
One piece is the fixed radius, the other is the imported value for the radius used for scaling the size of the different sphere ?

I guess my question is strictly related to this other question: how is the scaling performed when a 1D array of scalars is used as Scale Mode ?

Any Tutorial or source of information about this detail ?

How can I choose the "Radius" parameter in the "Properties" tab of the glyph filter such that the actual radii of the rendered particles correspond to the real values assigned to the unstructured grid ?

Thanks a lot for your help and support

Best regards

Michele

Hi Paraview users,

New python features have been added to paraview.  You'll need to build
a copy of paraview from cvs, or wait for the next 3.6 release.  There
is a wiki page describing the new features:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools

Please feel free to send feedback and suggestions, or report any
issues you discover (but read the wiki page before reporting problems
since it details some known issues.)

Enjoy!

I also do similar things and  what I used to do is

- to choose  glyph type sphere
- Scalar   radii
 - *set Radius as 1* (in the Sphere tab just after Center property)
- select scale mode scalar
- *set scale factor 1
*
Then it should correspond to real values...
Hope other would correct me if I am being wrong here

Thanks a lot Sreejith

That worked perfectly for my case and I think it should work in general when you want to render spherical particles with their real radius.

Please keep the discussion to the mailing list.

Also the images you attached are too low resolution to be legible. Can

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Z Boundaries Correct on Custom Reader
Message-ID: <811a1f290907070827u18795fbaj6e82ba27d0ea9ca4@mail.gmail.com>

I have a custom reader that I am updating and all is going well
(thanks to all for help earlier) but I am having a problem
understanding how some values are computed.

When I load my data set and I look in the "Information" tab the X and
Y boundaries are correct but the z boundary is not correct. In fact it
is off by the z origin multiplied by the z spacing which I find odd
because the X & Y origins are correct. Even if I set a z origin to
Zero.

Some output from my reader:

MicronOriginVoi: 46979.1 48347.6
MicronSizeVoi: 1545.97 1731.28
CurrentScalingFactor: 0.207987 0.207987 1.2
PixelVOI: 0 7432 0 8322 490 491
PixelActual: 0 7440 0 8330 490 727
requestedExtent: 0 7432 0 8322 490 491

And I setup the vtkImageData like this:
output->SetSpacing(this->CurrentScalingFactor);
output->SetOrigin(this->MicronOriginVoi[0], this->MicronOriginVoi[1], 0.0 );
output->SetScalarType(VTK_TYPE_UINT8);
output->SetExtent(requestedExtent);
output->SetNumberOfScalarComponents( 1 );
output->AllocateScalars();
output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("RoboMet Voxels");
output->GetPointData()->SetActiveScalars("RoboMet Voxels");

At this point the "Information" tab shows a Z Bounds of 588 to 589
(Delta 1.2). So the delta is correct but not the bounds. Also during
the RequestInformation method I have the following code:

double origin[3] = { this->MicronOriginVoi[0], this->MicronOriginVoi[1], 0.0  };
outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), origin, 3 );

I am not really sure what I am doing wrong at this point.

Jona,

Please keep the discussion to the mailing list so that others can
participate as well.

TimestepValues is a read-only property. With the legacy reader it's
not possible to change the time values for legacy vtk files read as a
file series. You can create a pvd file which is an xml file describing
the time values for each file, however pvd doesn't support legacy VTK
files, you need to write the new xml-based vtk files.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.4.0 accepting connections from multiple
	servers
Message-ID: <82f4f6180907070904r18319f29y30b5858269934d8e@mail.gmail.com>

If I have a cluster of machines and I am trying to run paraview. I
have 2 GPUs on one machine and I am running 2 X servers one on each of
the GPU. I want to run 2 pvserver instances one on each GPU and have
then distribute the rendering load on the GPUs. The Paraview Client
GUI runs on another machine and needs to accept connections from the
two servers. Is this possible with the 3.4.0 version of Paraview ? It
was possible with the 2.x series, but I am unable to get this running
with the 3.4 series.

If this is my servers.pvsc file and viz3g0 and viz3g1 show up when I
use the File->Connect gui.

<Server name="viz3g0" resource="cs://viz3:11111" owner="site">
   <ManualStartup />
</Server>
<Server name="viz3g1" resource="cs://viz3:11112" owner="site">
   <ManualStartup />
</Server>

I run 2 server using
$ mpirun -np 1 -e DISPLAY=:0 pvserver --client-host=viz2 --server-port=11111 &
$ mpirun -np 1 -e DISPLAY=:1 pvserver --client-host=viz2 --server-port=11112

But I can only choose viz3g0 or viz3g1 from the GUI, but not both. If
I get viz3g0 to connect and then select viz3g1, viz3g0 is
disconnected.

How does one achieve getting multiple servers to connect to a single client ?

Thanks,
Manju

In so far as I understand, the origin is the location of the lower left 
corner of the cell indexed at 0,0,0. You have requested extent 490-491, 
so bounds should be: 0.0+490*1.2 to 0.0+491*1.2 or 588 to 589.

Hi Utkarsh,

Sorry, I forged to keep the paraview mailing list.

Thank you for your answer.
I had tried to make a file PVD and I had changed VTK file to VTU.
I launched PVD file with xml-base (I think)

I can see with TimestepValues are a same that I wrote in PVD file.

reader_base.TimestepValues
#>>> [0.0, 5.0, 6.0, 10.0]

But when I create a movie, the timesteps are bad.
I don't understand why? Perhaps I have a bug in my script?
I have attached my script and PVD file in my mail.

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards,
Jona

Subject: [Paraview] Widget plugin?
Message-ID: <DF20A6C9-72A3-4D8E-A6A2-D2D302C574A9@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I have created a new type of widget (a "Slab" to clip with -- very  
close to the Box but with slightly different look and interaction),  
and have it working in ParaView (interspersed with and compiled along  
with the PV CVS source).

I was looking through trying to figure out whether there was a way to  
gather up my new source code and XML to create a plugin instead. Most  
of it seems independent of the rest of the PV source, except for  
pq3DWidget::createWidget() in which I had to add my new widgetType to  
the list of test cases.

Is there any way of separating this out so I could compile my new  
widget (and its representation, XML, UI panel, etc) as a PV plugin?

Thanks,
-Eric

Not currently, but it should be very easy to allow plugins to provide
3D widget so feel free to add a feature request to the bug tracker.
Until then you can write a custom panel for your filter that directly
creates your widget explicitly.

I tried setting the origin to 490 but then the Z Boundary was
490+490*1.2 which was not correct either.

 Now that I have an idea of what is going on I think I can make the
necessary changes to the source code.

Subject: [Paraview] Velocity values at walls
Message-ID: <4A5398EE.90505@yahoo.de>

Hi all,

I do an export from my CFD code using node-values. I get the value of
"0" for the velocity at walls in Paraview. I can not visualise contour
of velocity magnitude at the surface or do surfaces streamlines. How can
I get velocities to wall boundaries? I tried calculation cell values and
point values once again, however I still have zero velocites at walls.

Thanks BastiL

Correct, yes

No there should not be non-zero velocity at walls. Zero is correct.
However in certain circumstances it may be interesting to get "pseudo"
velocities at walls - eg. to calculate surface streamlines or make
contour plots of velocity magnitude "directly at" the wall. Therefore I
want to interpolate some velocity values to the wall as other
postprocessors can do.

I don't know of any existing filters that will try to do this for you.  You
may have to write your own custom filter for it.  What algorithms are used
to calculate these pseudo velocities at the wall?

I am not really sure but I think in most cases it is common to simply
use the velocity of the cell closed to the wall for the wall face itself.
Another option is to calculate wall shear stress vector
(http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Wall_shear_stress). This could also be
helpful for surface restricted streamlines.

I'm guessing that the simulation is using no-slip boundary conditions (i.e.
setting the velocity to be zero at walls).  Are you sure that there should
be non-zero velocity at the walls?  Is there non-zero velocity elsewhere in
the domain?

It was never possible to have multiple servers connect to a ParaView
client. There was a way of specifying the display variable for each
node in a configuration file. Using that you could launch a 2 process
mpi job and assign each to a different display. Utkarsh, do you know
if we are still reading configuration xml files (I forgot the
extension)?

Message-ID: <6dac95df0907071749j48b909cfw4b29c50ac5efd3a2@mail.gmail.com>

testing my reader plugin, I thought timer log would be a good way to go,
however not so sure what it's timing. running in client server mode, 2 , 4
and 8 processes so far.

I put some time computation in my request data method that show the read
takes less than 1 second on all processes and decreases as process are
added, however timer log reports nearly 6 seconds on all runs.

The more important question: What is going on behind the scenes in those 5
seconds after my reader executes?

Can we safely say it's client server communication?

ParaView wont try to load ballance behind my back will it?

into the problem related to osmesa support.
The errors look like this. Can someone help me why is that?

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF writer does not write over existing data,
	if array length changes
Message-ID: <4A546E0B.2060602@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi

I am using a fairly recent CVS version of paraview.
While using the xdmf writer, I noticed that the file <filename>.h5 is 
not overwritten. It seems to happen if the new data set contains arrays 
of different length to the arrays in the existing *.h5 file.

Following warning message is displayed:


blloyd at dock:~/src>XDMF Error in 
/home/blloyd/Kitware/Paraview-CVS/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfHDF.cxx 
line 594 (Source and Target Spaces specify different sizes for path: 
/Unnamed/Connections)
XDMF Error in 
/home/blloyd/Kitware/Paraview-CVS/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfHDF.cxx 
line 595 (Source = 4508 items)
XDMF Error in 
/home/blloyd/Kitware/Paraview-CVS/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfHDF.cxx 
line 596 (Target = 43184 items)


Is the writer supposed to behave like this, or is this a bug?

Thanks
Bryn

Subject: [Paraview] Mimicking the 'set view plane direction' GUI buttons in
	Python script
Message-ID: <005f01c9ffbc$4185ebc0$4f2810ac@win.ara>

I am trying to write a simple few lines of Python code to mimick the view
plane direction buttons available in the GUI, but I'm finding some of the
commands don't seem to accept my input. The version of Paraview is 3.5.0 and
I'm using paraview.simple. For example:

cam = GetActiveCamera()

cam.SetPosition(-15,10,0) #works
cam.GetPosition()		#works
( -15.0, 10.0, 0.0)
Render()

cam.SetFocalPoint(0,10,0) 	#works
cam.GetFocalPoint()		#works
( 0.0, 10.0, 0.0)
Render()

cam.GetViewUp()
(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
cam.SetViewUp(0,0,1)	#error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in ?
TypeError: 'list' object is not callable
cam.SetViewUp = (0,0,1)	#appears to have accepted it
cam.GetViewUp()
(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)		#does not update the view

Do I need to update to the latest dev version to get this working? It
appears to work fine with the old Paraview-python API.

What version of mesa are you using?

Did it come with your operating system?

Did you compile it yourself?

What does "grep MESA CMakeCache.txt" say?

What does "grep GL CMakeCache.txt" say?

Subject: [Paraview] Artifacts on Image when using "Map Scalars" with
	vtkImageData
Message-ID: <811a1f290907080803m1f370813y602004b311070d2c@mail.gmail.com>

Custom Reader written recently and compiling on OS X Intel 10.5.7
against ParaView CVS (Updated this morning). When I load my image and
the "Map Scalars" is selected in the "Display Tab" my image is sheared
with diagonal black lines. I have attached a simple reproduction using
a simple white image (Real data is restricted). Investigating this
more it seems that the order of operations may be important because
after fiddling with paraview a bit and reloading some subsections of
the data (but still substituting white data for the real data) now the
"Map Scalars" needs to be OFF to show the diagonal black lines.

It could be my code or it could be a bug in ParaView? I'm open to any
suggestions.

I'm not quite sure this is available in 3.5, but there is a new way to
set camera properties.  Instead of setting them on the camera, try
setting them on the view:

view = GetActiveView()
view.CameraPosition = [-15, 10, 0]
view.CameraFocalPoint = [0, 10, 0]
view.CameraViewUp = [0 ,0, 1]

All settable properties for the view can be printed:

for p in view.ListProperties():
    if not view.GetProperty(p).GetInformationOnly(): print p

I would generate an implicit representation of the surface (mollified

Subject: [Paraview] Color coding of a vector
Message-ID: <1247092822.27429.6.camel@xi-Linux>

Hi,

I am new to paraview and I have been struggling with the color coding
problem. What I want to do is to color a whole bunch of cells by the
specific vector associated with each of them. The coloring scheme is to
set the x,y and z components as the (r,g,b) components, since I don't
like the default setting which uses the magnitude of the vector. This
coloring scheme seems possible since someone mentioned it in,

http://markmail.org/message/qv2ujjeyx546eoon#query:vtk%20vector%20field%
20color+page:1+mid:k27k5fzjzxqmgg5d+state:results

But I searched for quite a while, however, I had gotten the luck yet.
Anyone help me out?

Thanks in advance,
Xi Tan

Thanks for that. I'll give it a try today. I've executed the script using
the built python shell and what appears to be happening is my screen appears
as I'd like it, then almost immediately it resets itself to a standard view.
Here are the last few lines of my script:

//======================================
##set camera
cam = GetActiveCamera()

cam.SetFocalPoint( (point1[0]+point2[0])/2.0, (point1[1]+point2[1])/2.0,
point1[2])
foc = cam.GetFocalPoint()
print foc

cam.SetPosition(point1[0]*-50, foc[1], foc[2])
print cam.GetPosition()

cam.SetViewUp(0,0,1)

print cam.GetViewUp()
print cam.GetViewPlaneNormal()

cam.Zoom(10)

Render()
//=======================================

Is it possible Render() calls ResetCamera()?

I'm not quite sure this is available in 3.5, but there is a new way to set
camera properties.  Instead of setting them on the camera, try setting them
on the view:

view = GetActiveView()
view.CameraPosition = [-15, 10, 0]
view.CameraFocalPoint = [0, 10, 0]
view.CameraViewUp = [0 ,0, 1]

All settable properties for the view can be printed:

for p in view.ListProperties():
    if not view.GetProperty(p).GetInformationOnly(): print p

You may look at the source code in
/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py

def Render(view=None):
    """Renders the given view (default value is active view)"""
    if not view:
        view = active_objects.view
    view.StillRender()
    if _funcs_internals.first_render:
        view.ResetCamera()
        view.StillRender()
        _funcs_internals.first_render = False
    return view


So, it would seem that if a first rendering has not been done, then yes,
it calls ResetCamera. Try doing a Render call before setting your
camera, and then follow your usual procedure

You can set the the 3 components o fthe vector as the r,g,b values
only if the vector components are of the type 'unsigned char'. If
that's the case, then simply uncheck "Map Scalars" checkbox  on the
display tab and the raw data will be used for coloring.

Are you sure the vtkMyClass source file was listed after the
SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES keyword in the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro?

i.e.
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPlugin "1.0"
   ...
     SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyClass.cxx
   ...)

Here's how you can specify the display to use for each server using a
configuration file called "pvx".

<pvx>
  <Process Type="server">
    <Machine Name="m1" Environment="DISPLAY=:0" />
    <Machine Name="m2" Environment="DISPLAY=:1" />
  </Process>
</pvx>

Now start the pvserver as:
> mpirun -np 2 <path>/pvserver <path>/configuration.pvx

Now connect to this server using the paraview client. If you set the
remote render threshold from the "Edit|Settings" dialog to 0 you will
see that the 2 server rendering windows will pop up on the two
displays.

I am guessing by vtkStreamTracer plugin you mean the standard stream
tracer included in ParaView. Look at
ParaView3Src/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml

If you search for "StreamTracer" in this file, you will find the
corresponding XML that paraview uses for this filter.

It sounds like there is something wrong with the osmesa.h header file.
I would download and build the latest mesa from mesa3d.org.
Alternatively, you can try to remove mesa-libOSMesa-devel and install
it again.

Plugins that are directly placed in the auto-search paths should be
automatically loaded. Any plugin in another directory in that path, as
is the case with the plugins we are distributing with ParaView such as
the point sprite plugin, they won't be loaded by default.

Subject: [Paraview] timer log, looks a bit off
In-Reply-To: <6dac95df0907071749j48b909cfw4b29c50ac5efd3a2@mail.gmail.com>

If you are look at a line like:

Execute vtkSphereSource id: 115,  0.256536 seconds

where vtkSphereSource should be replaced with your reader, it should
be only the timing for your reader from right before its execution to
right after. If you are looking at the render time, it would include
other things. In the rest of the message, I am assuming that you are
looking at a line like the one above. Even if not, some of my answers
should shed some light on how timing works.

During the RequestData pass, the executive does the following:

- vtkDemandDrivePipeline::ExecuteDataStart() -> calls
this->Algorithm->UpdateProgress(0.0) at the end
- calls your algorithm
- vtkDemandDrivePipeline::ExecuteDataEnd() -> calls
this->Algorithm->UpdateProgress(1.0) at the beginning

The timer log reports the time that passed between progress 0 and 1.
There seems to be a big discrepancy between this number and what your
timing show. So I'd guess that there is a bug somewhere. If you are
calling UpdateProgress(), can you verify that it is doing the right
thing? Also, you can insert your own timing code in
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline to look for a bug in ParaView.

I am going to say nothing - barring any bugs.

> Can we safely say it's client server communication?

Nope. The timing should not include any client-server communication.

> ParaView wont try to load ballance behind my back will it?

It depends. If this reader produces polydata or unstructured grid, are
you setting MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES to -1 in RequestInformation? If
this reader produces one of the structured datasets, are you producing
exactly the UPDATE_EXTENT? Either way, the timing should not include
any load balancing ParaView does. That should be reported separately.

I am afraid there is no direct way. What you can do however, at the
cost of more memory, is to use the tranform filter to create a copy
(or more) of your dataset that is shifted and then group the result
with the Group filter. Then you should be able to use resample as
before. The memory overhead is minimal because ParaView will only
create new instances of the coordinates arrays and re-use all other
arrays.

Can you reproduce this will smaller datasets on fewer processors? I
wonder if it is bug that causes some memory problem. We should track
it down.

Subject: [Paraview] constant grid, changing attributes
Message-ID: <1247148480.3627.4.camel@x60>

Is XDMF efficiently handling grids where the grid does not change in
time, but the attributes do? I mean: will it be smart to only read the
grid definition once and return the same instance every time a new
timestep is requested?

Will it efficiently handle cases where the geometry changes, but
topology not?

Motivation behind: I have long time series of unstructured grids where
the grids either do not change or change only topology. It takes (too)
long to play them in Paraview.

Thanks,
Dominik

I pulled the ParaView 3.6 branch this morning from CVS and re-compiled
everything and now the problem is gone (with no changes to my code) so
I am going to assume this is a bug with ParaView or VTK.

Hi Randall,

I am not aware of a guide or a list of vtk-to-paraview conversions. So
I will try to quickly summarize.

On the server side, ParaView IS vtk. What I mean is that it is trivial
to use vtk objects from within ParaView. Write an XML file that tells
ParaView what the class name is and what methods are callable. In the
ParaView code look at Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml for
examples. You then get your code into ParaView either by editing the
source directly, writing an external module
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time) or
preferably writing a plugin
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo). When that is done
ParaView knows how to use the vtkObject and will instantiate it in
parallel or serial, remotely or locally, depending on the run time
configuration.

Algorithms work most efficiently if they respect the way extents are
specified in the streaming demand driven pipeline, and communicate
amongst themselves via MPI only in the RequestData method. See the
ParaView guide, chapter 21 for more details.

On the client side, things are slightly more complicated, because they
require a mix of vtk and Qt programming. I recommend looking at the
existing Plugin types which allow you to make fairly arbitrary
functional additions the existing Qt client. In the near future we
will have a new architecture which makes it easier to write custom
applications that take away or modify the Qt client's functionality.

hope that helps,

Subject: [Paraview] Showing XDMF multiblock grid names on Extract
Message-ID: <8FAAA085-1660-48C2-AC0E-52F3AEBA6417@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I'm creating an XDMF "temporal collection of spatial collections" to  
group my time series data and view it in ParaView. It works great,  
except that when I do an "Extract Block" I have to choose from a list  
of generic names like this:

Root
     Block 0
         DataSet 0
         DataSet 1
         DataSet 2
         DataSet 3

so I (or my users) have to remember which block is which.

In the XMF file each DataSet has a Grid Name. Is there any way to have  
ParaView show these grid names rather than the generic default names?  
(They don't show up in the Information tab, for reference, either -- I  
have to look back at the XMF file...)

Thanks,
-Eric

The main reason is patents. We'd rather not have any code that depends
on patented technology and mpeg4 is heavily patented. On the other
hand, mjpeg is not.

Message-ID: <56F66A9F02F8DD40B540440CEE290BEB826893141F@ES03SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>



When I set up my velocity vector with a calculator, I use iHat*U+jHat*V+kHat*W.  Then, after selecting streamtracers, I automatically get several new plotting parameters, including "vorticity".  Normally, vorticity is defined as Del cross Velocity_vector.  Is that what Paraview does behind the scenes?  Is this written somewhere, so I can take a look?

Thanks!

in a python shell when I do a

using my paraview install, the resulting imported VTK object is not the same
as when I do a

import vtk

from my vtk install, built from the same ParaView source tree.

For example vtkDistributedStreamTracer is missing  from the vtk object
imported from the paraview install. Actually comparing a ''dir(vtk)'' on
both show the ParaView vtk module is way small compared to the VTK vtk
object. ^The obvious thing to do is to build a serparate VTK build from my
ParaView sources, but I wonder why is the paraview vtk python module so
slim? Are the missing classes in there somewhere else?

Thanks Berk and David for the prompt answer.

Licensing certainly is a good reason. But then, mjpeg produces much  
larger movies. Every frame is a key-frame. How about offering a choice  
between mjpeg and ogg/theora in the export dialog?

Dang, I searched the archives, but nothing useful showed up... must

Hi,

This is because paraview does not import all the vtk libraries, I
suppose to save time, but maybe there are other reasons.

Try this from paraview:

print paraview.vtk.__file__

And you'll get /pat/to/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/vtk/__init__.pyc

Now open this file in an editor (replace .pyc with .py) and you'll see
which vtk libraries are being imported from paraview.  Now compare
these to the vtk/__init__.py file when you import vtk from the vtk
install.

To get to the vtkDistributedStreamTracer, you can do this:

from libvtkParallelPython import *

or on windows: from vtkParallelPython import *


Pat

Subject: [Paraview] Cutting a volume with polydata
In-Reply-To: <1247075375.16129.13.camel@x60>
Message-ID: <C67BB2C3.AF9B%kmorel@sandia.gov>

An easier solution is to use the resample with dataset filter to map the unstructured grid fields to the poly data.  That won't actually clip the poly data by the unstructured grid volume though.  You could use the threshold or clip-by-scalars feature on the created vtkValidPointMask field to approximate the intersection, but there will be obvious errors.

Subject: [Paraview] bug in ParaView 3.6.1: no tube-filter in menu
In-Reply-To: <4A4CCF74.4090006@gmx.de>
Message-ID: <C67BC270.AFC2%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Why was the name of the Tube filter changed to Generate Tubes?  I don't like the new name because it is harder to find in the alphabetical list (as Jens demonstrated).  I noticed this before but forgot to report it.  Can we change the name back to what it was or at least to start with the name Tube (or some variant thereof)?

Hi Berk,

yes, thanks, I was looking for "Generate Tubes"

wish:
I would like to see a "Search"-Funktion, which can handle keywords and
(more important) which can give me a hint how to transform my data, so
it will be accepted by the desired filter.

Greetings

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview plugin
In-Reply-To: <4A4E0854.5040908@imag.fr>
Message-ID: <C67BC560.AFC5%kmorel@sandia.gov>

A FindParaView.cmake file is not necessary.  The ParaView build and install follows the appropriate CMake conventions to find and setup the install without it.  In short, a command like FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView) is sufficient to find the ParaView installation.

If you are having trouble creating all the files needed for a plugin, I recommend trying out the plugin wizard from MIRARCO (http://pluginwizard.mirarco.org/).  It will create the necessary CMake code and C++/XML boilerplate for a simple plugin.

Hello,

is there a file FindParaview.cmake in the paraview distribution?

If it does not exist, can someone help me and give me an example of a

Thanks a lot!

Thanks for that.  it works now. 

however, to maintain backwards/binary compatibility, and since any 
vector attributes still seem to require three components, i am using 
something like the following for 2D data:

thank you for information! I attempt to check thing out myself, but not so
easy!

Something is not as you say it should be, but perhaps I make a wrong move
when I code my reader, so I really want to get this resolved, because as it
stands pipeline execute takes 80% while read if 1/2Gig only takes 20%. That
can't be correct!

I step in gdb and I see the stack has mixture of CompositeDataPipeline,
StreamingDemandDrivenPipeline, DemandDrivenPipeline, and Executive. In
addition to timing RequestData in the reader I time in ProcessRequest in
each of these classes to see where the hang up is. To my surprise I see that
many,many,many! things are going on after the reader finished RequestData.
Take a look at the io from the 2 process run that follws my text. I put
notes in with '===>' so you can see timing from RequestData easy. This io is
from a single pipeline update!  For this one pipeline update I see timer log
report:

Execute vtkBAMReader id: 7750, 5.56547 seconds


lost + do not know what causes this! Plz HLP,

thx Bam.

Yes, that's how the filter calculates it. Here is the code from the filter:

void vtkStreamTracer::CalculateVorticity(vtkGenericCell* cell,
                                         double pcoords[3],
                                         vtkDoubleArray* cellVectors,
                                         double vorticity[3])
{
  double* cellVel;
  double derivs[9];

  cellVel = cellVectors->GetPointer(0);
  cell->Derivatives(0, pcoords, cellVel, 3, derivs);
  vorticity[0] = derivs[7] - derivs[5];
  vorticity[1] = derivs[2] - derivs[6];
  vorticity[2] = derivs[3] - derivs[1];

}

You can also calculate using vtkCellDerivatives or the new Python
calculator (in cvs).

I have a similar challenge. A single 3D grid which I warp into a
spherical grid. The Z=0 and Z=max planes meet at the meridian. All is
good, iso-contour surfaces for example appear "full". The challenge
arises when doing streamlines. I have two cases:

A) surface-restricted streamlines on constant-radius surfaces.
Streamlines don't cross over the meridian line. I fixed this by merging
the points along the meridian and the surface then appears fully
connected, i.e. there are no "external" triangle edges.

B) 3D-streamlines, and the the streamlines don't cross over the meridian
plane.

Berk's comment just make me think that I could make a second copy of the
spherical grid (a full shallow copy), group the datasets, and use the
multi-block version of the streamer. (I do streamlines on large
multi-blocks datasets where the inter-block connectivity is never given
by the reader, and it works very well. Particles leaving a block find
their new "host" block and continue along the streamlines). So shouldn't
that work with two copies of a spherical grid?

Feature request: I am not aware that vtkMultiBlockDataSet allows the
definition of block connectivity, yet, I have it for other simulation
data, but my reader doesn't know what to do with it. Wouldn't a
multi-block streamer use it if available?

I think Berk changed that so that it becomes an action so that the
python scripts seem nicer. I have no preference either ways. In any
case, we definitely need to make the searching functionality more
explicit.

Are you connecting to pvserver by any change?  If so, did you load the
plugin on the server side as well?

No, I use a standalone version of ParaView on a MacBook Pro, which I compiled from source.

Subject: [Paraview] bug in ParaView 3.6.1: no tube-filter in menu
In-Reply-To: <7ba9d6a30907100611u2ffce47ercddcd4d72e08deea@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C67CB441.B016%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I agree that we should encourage the use of the searching functionality more, but I still contend that this filter's name should start with Tube (and in general all filters should start with the most identifying word).  The issue is that even if we use search most of the time, it is sometimes convenient to use the alphabetic menu if, for example, I can't remember exactly the name.  It's like looking up a word you don't know how to spell in the dictionary by going through an alphabetic list of word you know is close as opposed to trying to guess the spelling in a spell checker that does not suggest corrections.  Also, I ran into this when showing ParaView to a user and I could not find the tube filter in the alphabetic list.  It was a little embarrassing.

Yet another reason to list the most significant word first is to make it easer to search documentation.  The filters and python functions are going to be listed in alphabetic order when documented.  It is only natural to look under "Tube" when browsing the documentation.  So although the name "GenerateTubes" might look a bit nicer in a python script, I think it actually adds more heartache to the python programmer than it relieves.

You will probably get better responses on the list.

I am copying the list.

ParaView will read a file named data.csv that looks like :

5.5,6.6,7.7

Then you can use the "Plot Data" filter or the "Table to Points" filter
to display the data.

Hi Bam,

I am vacation. I will respond when I get back. There does seem to be

I agree that it would be nice to add ogg/theora. I am guessing ffmpeg
supports it. Would you mind adding a feature request in
http://paraview.org/Bug.

Thanks,

I'd still CC the mailing list so others can participate and benefit
from this conversation.

I am not sure why you have all the other wrapping stuff in your
CMakeLists.txt. Start with just the initial part.

#===============================
CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.4)
IF(COMMAND CMAKE_POLICY)
  CMAKE_POLICY(SET CMP0003 NEW)
ENDIF(COMMAND CMAKE_POLICY)
PROJECT(MyClass)
# Find and load ParaView settings.
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyClass "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyClass.cxx
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyClass.xml)

Paul,
I tried to replicate this bug, and cannot.  I did get weirdness's to occur only with a sphere, specifically coloring by normal.  ParaView is trying to color by the magnitude of the normal vector, which is 1 in all cases.  I suspect that the color we are seeing is caused by some round off errors.

If you still see this bug, please replicate with the cylinder source, using color by TCoords (which DOES have a range from 0 to 1.414).

Thanks,

Alan

Subject: [Paraview] bug with colour and state files

Hi,

I've noticed a bug with colours and state files.  If you set the colour via the toolbar then it will not be saved in a state file.  However this does work if you set it via the "Object Inspector" in the "Display" tab.  Steps to reproduce this are:

 *   launch paraview
 *   create sphere
 *   change the colour - either "Object inspector" (gets saved in state file) or toolbar (doesn't get saved in state file)
 *   save state
 *   reload paraview
 *   load state

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Server Manager Properties and the apply button
Message-ID: <833841.61912.qm@web110113.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have a filter which implements a custom object panel, through extension of the pqNamedObjectPanel class. Generally, I don't match the widget names with the Server Manager Properties names, but I am able to change the properties by calling vtkSMProxy::UpdateProperty("PropertyName",1). So, I have to hit ParaView's APPLY button only when the filter is instantiated. When I set the SM properties due to some GUI changes, ParaView never requires the APPLY button to be hit.

Now I've added a checkbox to the GUI, and when its state changes, I want that some IntVectorProperty be changed JUST when the user press APPLY. I mean, I want that APPLY be activated and waiting to be pressed when I change the state of the checkbox, and when this is done, the Server state should be changed. How can I achieve this ?

Regards, 
Rafael.

You can manually connect the checkbox's state-change signal to
pqObjectPanel::setModified() slot, this will make the Apply button
green when the user click on the checkbox. Then override
pqObjectPanel::accept() and pqObjectPanel::reset() to update/reset the
checkbox's state and set it on the corresponding property yourself.

I tried it and same result.
So I tried this :
  sed s/StreamTracer/StreamPlacer/g vtkStreamTracer.{h,cxx} > vtkStreamPlacer.{h,cxx}
  add #include "vtkLocalConfigure.h"
  add class VTK_vtkLocal_EXPORT vtkStreamPlacer
which means I just made a copy of the original vtkStreamTracer class and try to integrate it in ParaView.
Same result: the new class appears in the list of filters but it clashed as soon as it has been selected.

In the ParaView source  under Examples/Plugins/Filter there's a filter
example. Try building that. Does that work? You'll need to add the
following two lines to the start of the CMakeLists.txt in that
directory if you are directly trying to build the example on it's own.

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

Something that has been on my "todo" list for a long time is to use
Quicktime as a back end on at least OS X to create movies. I have just
never had the time to start down that path. This could also be used on
Windows if needed, but using the native windows media is probably
better. At least that way those on OS X can have their choice of legal
codecs to use. Just not sure what to do on the Linux side of things.

How about using GStreamer as an abstraction layer? It can use native  
backends, such as QuickTime and DirectShow.

The only reason I was selecting Quicktime on OS X was that it is
obviously built in and there are no licensing restrictions on any of
the codecs that it supports.
  On Windows there is already the wmv plugin which uses native windows APIs.

 On linux I wouldn't really know what to use. Due to licensing issues
I don't think you can directly include source in ParaView/VTK that is
GPL'ed in any way (which GStreamer and FFMPEG are). And the issue with
FFMPEG is that is uses patented algorithms for its codecs in which
royalties have not been paid. See the beginning of this entire thread.

Sure it supports OpenGL. You just need to have the appropriate hardware
drivers working.
Assuming you are using Linux (you didn't say which OS you have), check
these things:

# see which libraries are in use:
$ ls -l /usr/lib*/*libGL.so*

# verify you are actually getting OpenGL performance:
$ glxgears



If both of these check out okay, you should be in business.

Message-ID: <200907130948.14294.andi.maier@mytum.de>

Hi,

I have a problem with the Calculator filter using pvpython and the 
servermanager module.

My script works fine upto that point:

># Point to Cell Data
> ptc=servermanager.filters.PointDataToCellData(Input=clip2)

> calc_vM.UpdatePipeline()


and then I get the following error:

>ERROR:

line 1473
>vtkFunctionParser (0xa105428): Syntax error: expecting a variable name; see

line 1473
>vtkFunctionParser (0xa105428): Syntax error: expecting a variable name; see

It must be something with the names of my cell 
arrays 'eigenval1',..,'eigenval3' because I do not get that error when using 
just scalars in Function (IE: Function='10000').

That same formula works fine when I use it in the paraview Calculator.

I hope that anybody can help me with that problem. Thanks in advance.


Best wishes,

Andi

To my knowledge Theora is free of any formal trouble, and sufficient
quality to be proposed for a default encoder for any platform, not?

Andi,

You have to specify which scalars you want to use ni the calculator before
updating the pipeline using ScalarVariable or VectorVariable:
 
# Calculate von Mises Caucy stress and save in in celldata 'vMises_stress'
calc_vM = servermanager.filters.Calculator(
		Input=ptc, 
		AttributeMode=2,
		ResultArrayName='vMises',
	
Function='0.70711*sqrt((eigenval1-eigenval2)^2+(eigenval2-eigenval3)^2+(eige
nval3-eigenval1)^2)',
		ScalarVariable =
['eigenval1','eigenval1','0','eigenval2','eigenval2','0','eigenval3','eigenv
al3','0']) #<<===HERE
calc_vM.UpdatePipeline()


For a vector, the syntax would be: VectorVariable =
['Velocity','Velocity','0','1','2']. The first string is the stored varname,
the second string is what you would like to call it in your function, and
the proceeding numbers are there location in the array (scalar's always at
0). Might not be the best explanation, but it works!

That same formula works fine when I use it in the paraview Calculator.

I hope that anybody can help me with that problem. Thanks in advance.

Hi,
When I use this filter with vtk (this is vtkArrayCalculator) in c++, I have
to call a function AddVectorArrayName or AddScalarArrayName in order to
'tell' the calculator that he has to use the array name as a variable in the
function string. Maybe this is the point ?

'Hope that helps

Hi,

it now works fine. The line in my script reads now:

calc_vM=servermanager.filters.Calculator(Input=ptc, AttributeMode=2, 
ResultArrayName='vMises_stress',AddScalarVariable=['eigenval1','eigenval1','0','eigenval2','eigenval2','0','eigenval3','eigenval3','0'] ,Function='0.70711*sqrt((eigenval1-eigenval2)^2+(eigenval2-eigenval3)^2+(eigenval3-eigenval1)^2)')

Thanks a lot for your explanations.

Andi







Andi,

You have to specify which scalars you want to use ni the calculator before
updating the pipeline using ScalarVariable or VectorVariable:
 
# Calculate von Mises Caucy stress and save in in celldata 'vMises_stress'
calc_vM = servermanager.filters.Calculator(
		Input=ptc, 
		AttributeMode=2,
		ResultArrayName='vMises',
	
Function='0.70711*sqrt((eigenval1-eigenval2)^2+(eigenval2-eigenval3)^2+(eige
nval3-eigenval1)^2)',
		ScalarVariable =
['eigenval1','eigenval1','0','eigenval2','eigenval2','0','eigenval3','eigenv
al3','0']) #<<===HERE
calc_vM.UpdatePipeline()


For a vector, the syntax would be: VectorVariable =
['Velocity','Velocity','0','1','2']. The first string is the stored varname,
the second string is what you would like to call it in your function, and
the proceeding numbers are there location in the array (scalar's always at
0). Might not be the best explanation, but it works!

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Calculator filter in servermanager module

Hi,

I have a problem with the Calculator filter using pvpython and the
servermanager module.

My script works fine upto that point:


> from paraview import servermanager
> ...
> ...
># Point to Cell Data
> ptc=servermanager.filters.PointDataToCellData(Input=clip2)
> ptc.UpdatePipeline()

Function='0.70711*sqrt((eigenval1-eigenval2)^2+(eigenval2-eigenval3)^2+(eige
nval3-eigenval1)^2)')
> calc_vM.UpdatePipeline()


and then I get the following error:

>ERROR: 
In /home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkFunctionParser.cxx,

line 1473
>vtkFunctionParser (0xa105428): Syntax error: expecting a variable name; see

line 1473

position 0

It must be something with the names of my cell 
arrays 'eigenval1',..,'eigenval3' because I do not get that error when using

just scalars in Function (IE: Function='10000').

That same formula works fine when I use it in the paraview Calculator.

I hope that anybody can help me with that problem. Thanks in advance.

The problem probably is that ParaView is BSD-style licensed, while Ogg/ 
Theora is LGPL'ed. Now, it would be OK for ParaView to _link_ against  
LGPL'ed code (after all, it does so by using Qt), however I don't know  
whether it would be permissible to _include_ the code in the source  
distribution. Some idle googling didn't turn up anything conclusive.

True, thanks Mark

Hi,
I've been trying to load a VRML on ParaView unsucessfully from code. From
the API and the code i see that the vtkVRMLSource could allow one to load a
VRML but i have some issues with it. I create a vtkVRMLSource with the New()
method but from there i cant see where to go. I cannot specify this object
the file i want to load as all its members are protected. So my question is
how do i tell the vtkVRMLSource to load my VRML?
Thanks

You can simply open a vrml file as if you are loading a data file
using "File |Open". ParaView will create the vtkVRMLSource for you.

vtkVRMLSource has methods like SetFileName that you use to set the
filename programmatically and they are indeed public.

I'm running Paraview on Windows XP, and OpenGL is correctly set up for 
my machine.

What got me wondering about HW acceleration was my experience using 
Paraview to present results at a conference a few months ago. The 
display just seemed to drag, even though only a few apps (very basic) 
were running. This experience made me wonder if Paraview was compiled 
with Mesa, the software implementation of OpenGL.

Thanks.

Charts are not yet supported from python scripting API. There's plan
to support them as a part of our continued effort to fortify the
python scripting capabilities.

Nope, the binaries we distribute are not built with mesa. If you run
the dependency walker on the binary you should see which OpenGL dll
it's bringing in. It should be the one provided by your system.

Hi
I have a quick question. I wonder if paraview can open lammps data file
since I am using it for MD simulation.
Thanks

Hi all,

I am work with Paraview (3.7) and with linux.
I have a little question. 
I have done a export color file with paraview (xml color).
I wonder if paraview with python can easily to load this file.

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Subject: [Paraview] Doubt about animating 2 (or more) datasets simultaneously
Message-ID: <ef747b890907150603w47160844qafb9648fa43b3cba@mail.gmail.com>

Just a simple (and probably silly) doubt:

When animating 2 datasets with different time scales simultaneously, is
ParaView able to synchronize the frames? For example, let's suppose we load
2 datasets with the following timestep distributions:

DS1: 1 (0.0), 2 (0.5), 3 (1.0)

DS2: 1 (0.0), 2 (0.25), 3 (0.5), 4 (0.75), 5 (1.0)

where in n (t), n is the time step number and t is the corresponding time
value. Both datasets finish at the same time instant (t = 1.0) but the "time
resolution" was clearly different. In this (easy) case, how does ParaView
create the movie? Does it interpolate the missing frames for the dataset 1?

Thanks for any clarification

When animating these two datasets, ParaView will animate through 5 time values (it is better not to think about them as time steps since ParaView does not use time step indices with animating, it uses time values).  The time values will be 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0.  (ParaView will recognize that the time values of DS1 are also in DS2 and visit them only once.)  When at a time value that is not in DS1, such as 0.25, ParaView will load the "closest" time value available.  (I don't remember whether ParaView will round down to 0.0 or up to 0.5.  Try it and find out.)

ParaView will never interpolate missing frames by default because it can introduce artifacts.  However, you can impose interpolation if that is what you want by using the Temporal Interpolator filter.  Attach this filter to DS1 and you will get interpolated values for that filter.  This only works if the topology remains consistent, though.

Thanks for your quick answer Utkarsh. However, we are trying to load a VRML
file without having to use the menus. We are using vtkVRMLSource, but we
don't know to visualize it. We are trying to use the pqObjectBuilder
methods, createSource and createDataRepresentation, but it does not work
with VRML files. Is there a way for loading and displaying the file without
using the menus? Thanks a lot for your help.

We tried the following using the vtkVRMLSource

std::string file = "/models/flag.wrl";
leVRML = vtkVRMLSource::New();
leVRML->SetFileName(file.c_str());

However, we do not know how to visualize the VRMLObject in the Active View.

We tried the following using pqObjectBuilder:

 pqPendingDisplayManager *pdm =
qobject_cast<pqPendingDisplayManager*>(pqApplicationCore::instance()->manager("PENDING_DI
SPLAY_MANAGER"));
pdm->setAddSourceIgnored(true);
leSource = builder->createSource("sources", "VRMLSource", s);
leSource->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
pdm->setAddSourceIgnored(false);
leSource->setModifiedState(pqProxy::UNMODIFIED);
pqOutputPort* oPort = leSource->getOutputPort(0);
builder->createDataRepresentation(oPort,
pqActiveView::instance().current());
(pqActiveView::instance().current())->render();

but VRMLSource does not exist, so this approach fails. We were trying to
look if creating a proxy with the vtkVRMLSource would work but we haven't
figure that out yet. Can this source be added via an XML or something
(*throwing some ideas) so it can be used with the objectBuilder?

Thanks.

Thanks a lot for the explanation Ken. This question came to my mind when I
thought about visualizing 2 simulations at the same time (and in the same pv
session, of course). One using fixed time steps and the other one using
adaptive time steps.

Is there a way to use multiple "average" computers together to improve
performance? I successfully setup a single server and can use it to
render from a different computer in client/server mode - but is it
possible to have a "cloud" or "farm" of computers acting as a single
server?

Thanks,

David

Yes.

If you compile paraview from source and turn MPI on, then the server
process can be run as a parallel job (mpirun -np N pvserver).
Connecting to that parallel server and using it is no different than
the client/serial-server case.

I vaguely recall that the Mac binaries are compiled this way, and can
be used directly. Mac are treated differently because the MPI library
on Macs is more standardized than elsewhere.

Subject: [Paraview] Insert text source into view in a script
Message-ID: <adb0f27a0907151301s6d6bb6eeh271dc4765b6b3fbf@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a newbie in Paraview Python scripting, so I apologize upfront if
this is a trivial question.

I am processing a set of datafiles obtained from an optical
measurement system. I so far succeeded in loading the data file,
adding a color legend and storing the resulting view in a image file.
Sample code is posted below.

What I would like to do next is add a text source to the view to
provide some contextual information about the data (in particular the
external load level at which the data was captured). I managed to add
a text source to an "empty" view (so without first reading the data),
but I cannot find a way to have the data and text source together.

Can someone explain how I can add this to the view?

Kind regards,

Marco

#==== What I have so far ===================================================

"Text" is a data source similar to the reader. You need to  "Show" it
to add it to the active view.

Just do:
load = 100.0
# Don't know how to get this into the view
text = Text()
text.Text = "Load %6.3f" % load
Show()

For some reason the proxy is named "vrmlreader" (all lowercase). Try
using that name when calling createSource().

If you run into such issues, you can always look at
ParaView3Source/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml to
determine the name of the proxy for the reader you want to create.

Hello Utkarsh,

Thank you for the fast response. I tried this already before posting
my question to the mailing list, however, when I inserted the Show(),
I get the following error:

vtkFileSeriesReader : [ ...........]
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]

    return GetRepresentation(proxy, view)

Any suggestions?

Oops correction, I had a typo in the script:
#=======================
from paraview.simple import *
Sphere()
Show()
Render()

t = Text()
t.Text = "Hello World"
Show()
Render()

Hm, I still don't understand. I installed MPI and compiled with MPI on
with 4 computers, call them A,X,Y, and Z. A is where I will be sitting
working, and X,Y, and Z will be running paraview servers "helping" A
to do its work.

So on X,Y, and Z, I run
mpirun -np 1 pvserver (there is only 1 core on each machine - is this
what "number of processes" is looking for?)

Now on computer A, how do I tell it to use all 3 of these servers
(X,Y, and Z)? The only parallelization I've done before is with a
single machine with more than one core, so telling it to run a process
on several threads makes sense in that case - but we didn't tell X,Y,
and Z to work together, so it seems like we now just have 3
independent servers, that have now simply been started with 'mpirun'
instead of with only 'pvserver'!

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Visualising Cardiac Data
Message-ID: <20090715231221.7061dcbc@amelia>

Hello All

I mode cardiac electrophysiology, in realistic models of the heart.  My
geometry model is a finite differences grid of around 250*250*300
nodes.  Of these nodes, about 1/10th (or 1.6 million nodes) actually
correspond to nodes which have active cells.  These active cells are
the ones I want to visualise.  What I do at the moment is output a big
block of data to represent every cell, active or not, and then
threshold to remove the unwanted cells.  However this process is
(relatively) slow, and seems to cause paraview to crash when I ask it
to create a movie, so I am looking for a better option.  I've played
about with options such as 'extract surface' and 'Tetrahedralize' which
appear to get me surfaces which load up much quicker, but I have
thousands of datafiles, so manually creating one Tetrahedralized file per
dataset is not that practical.

How could I automate their creation?  Or is there a better option?

Regards,
Jon

Hi David,

You'll want to change your mpirun command a little bit-

on machine X: mpirun -np 3 -machinefile machinefile.txt pvserver

This will run 3 instances of pvserver where each instance runs on one of the
machines specified in machinefile.txt.  Machinefile.txt will list the
machine hostnames, one per line.  You'll need to setup password-less ssh
from machine X to machines Y and Z, otherwise it will prompt you for a
password for each machine.

Here's a link to a little test program you can try.  It will have each mpi
process print out its rank and hostname so that you can confirm that each
process really is running on its own machine-

Thanks Pat, I'll try that in the morning. Do I have to do anything on
Y and Z to prepare them to be in the machinefile list (like somehow
start mpi listening on them)? Also, if starting the pvserver from X,
does X have to be in the machinefile list? Or is it included
implicitly?

I've read several opinions on openMPI vs mpich2, but has anyone tested
these using paraview type benchmarks?

Can anyone comment on whether or not setting up something like this
will actually help? I am current using a pretty new P4 with 4gb ram
and a decent video card - would switching to a group of 3 or 4 P3's
with 2gb ram actually make a difference? Or would it actually be
worse? Or can I also run an MPI pvserver on my machine so I can use
A+X+Y+Z? If that is the case, is A smart enough not to send messages
over the network and then back to itself (i.e. will it really be A + X
+ Y + Z (i.e. strictly better than just A), or will it be (A - a
decent amount) + X + Y + Z?)

I also have access to an 8 core SGI machine that has no video
hardware. How much does the video card actually do in the rendering?
Is 8 cores worse than a machine with one core and a good video card?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <20090716064039.51537.qmail@f5mail-236-230.rediffmail.com>

The new 2D plotting introduced in ParaVie3.6 and current CVS branch have greatly improved the users ability to quantitatively analyze their simulation data. 
A few more additions will make it almost complete and make our work much simpler.

1. Normalize the axis.
2. Plot more than 1 plots in the same chart.
   (To compare simulation and experimental results, or more than 1 set of results)

Are there any plans to add these features in ParaView, if yes when ?
Thanks in advance.

I just found out the offending line that gives me the problem.
Given the following code:

from paraview.simple import *

lt = MakeBlueToRedLT(-1.0, 1.0)

bar = servermanager.rendering.ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation()
bar.LookupTable = lt
bar.LabelColor = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
bar.Title      = r'W [mm]'
bar.TitleColor = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
bar.LabelFontSize = 14
bar.AspectRatio   = 15.0
bar.AutomaticLabelFormat = 0

reader = XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName='disp-stage-%d.vtu' % 17)

Show()
Render()

#UpdatePipeline()

view = GetActiveView()							
view.Background = [0,0,0]						
ResetCamera(view)							
view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0

dp = GetDisplayProperties()						
dp.ColorArrayName = 'W' 						

rep = GetRepresentation()						
rep.LookupTable = lt							
					
view.Representations.append(bar)
					
# Don't know how to get this into the view
text = Text()
text.Text = "Hello"

Show()
Render()

WriteImage('test.png')	

The code fails to add the text if I have the following line enabled:

     view.Representations.append(bar)

If I uncomment this line, the text is added to the view as expected.
Does anybody have a clue why this is?

I added the traceback below:

You'll also want to make sure that you either give the full path to 
pvserver when you start the mpirun job, or make sure that pvserver is in 
your default path.

Will distributed processing help you?   That totally depends on the 
distribution of your dataset, speed of your network & processors, 
etc.    If you try to distribute a "small" dataset across multiple 
nodes, you may actually make things slower.   Same is true with 
distributed HW-based rendering.    The bottom line disclaimer: Your 
actual mileage may vary.

You can already do that. You can turn on visibility of multiple
sources in the same plot view.

Utkarsh - I looked pretty thoroughly at that, but didn't see anything
about using multiple computers as server, it just looked like single
computers with multiple cores.

I committed a fix to cvs.? The problem was that
ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation proxy does not have an Input property,
so a runtime error was thrown when servermanager.GetRepresentation()
tried to read the property value.  I added a try/except.

By the way, scalar bars can be created now through the paraview.simple
module if you have the latest paraview:

>>> help(CreateScalarBar)
Help on function CreateScalarBar in module paraview.simple:

CreateScalarBar(**params)
    Create and return a scalar bar widget.  The returned widget may
    be added to a render view by appending it to the view's representations
    The widget must have a valid lookup table before it is added to a view.
    It is possible to pass the lookup table (and other properties) as arguments
    to this method:

    lt = MakeBlueToRedLt(3.5, 7.5)
    bar = CreateScalarBar(LookupTable=lt, Title="Velocity")
    GetRenderView().Representations.append(bar)

    By default the returned widget is selectable and resizable.

Subject: [Paraview] Qt dependency
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0907161243r5675d3e8k5eeda4d752d4074e@mail.gmail.com>

Does Paraview depend on Qt for anything except the UI? I am trying to
install paraview on a server that does not have a graphics
card/monitor, so a GUI won't be much use (I'm just trying to run
pvserver). Could there be a "Build GUI?" option in cmake so that it
can be built without Qt installed? The server is running an old
version of redhat and it's giving me grief trying to install Qt.

Thanks,

David

Just for confirmation. I updated, recompiled and it works like a charm!

Thanks again,

Thanks a lotUtkarsh, we can now load our model. We are trying now to create
a transform filter for moving the model around. We are creating it the same
way we create a source (with pqObjectBuilder) but we have not found a way to
specify the transformation attributes (rotation, translation, scaling)
without using the GUI. We have read the filters.xml and there are such
propeties specifying those attributes. However, it is not clear how we can
manipulate those attributes via pqObjectBuilder or via pqPipelineSource.
Thanks.

pqPipelineSource is a type of pqProxy, so you can call getProxy() on
it to get a vtkSMProxy*.  From there you can access the properties
that you are seeing in the GUI.  It looks like the transform filter
has just one property, and it's a proxy property representing the
actual transform (named Transform3 and described in utilities.xml).
So you'll probably need to call GetProperty("Transform") and downcast
the returned pointer to vtkSMProxyProperty.  From the
vtkSMProxyProperty you can get another vtkSMProxy pointer, and this
vtkSMProxy should have the actual Position, Translation, and Scale
properties.

After you modify properties you can call UpdateVTKObjects() on the
vtkSMProxy, this is similar to clicking the Apply button.

I have a user that runs particle physics simulations and wants to write this into files that ParaView can easily read.

What are good file formats for particle simulations?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] memory leak in writer
Message-ID: <BAY122-W34B47D9707425E82F8DB0DBC1E0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?ve written a Wrapper for the Legacy VTK files writer, so that it writes a whole timeseries if I want it to. Lamentably, applying it, it needs more and more memory, so I am looking for a memory leak. 

Here is the bit of code I suspect:

 vtkInformation* inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkDataObject* input = inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT());

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkDataObject> inputCopy;
  inputCopy.TakeReference(input->NewInstance());
  inputCopy->ShallowCopy(input);

  vtksys_ios::ostringstream fname;
  if (this->WriteAllTimeSteps)
    {
    vtkstd::string path =
      vtksys::SystemTools::GetFilenamePath(this->FileName);
    vtkstd::string fnamenoext =
      vtksys::SystemTools::GetFilenameWithoutLastExtension(this->FileName);
    vtkstd::string ext =
      vtksys::SystemTools::GetFilenameLastExtension(this->FileName);
    if((this -> CurrentTimeIndex) < 10)  fname << path << "/" << fnamenoext << ".000" <<this->CurrentTimeIndex << ext;
    else if((this -> CurrentTimeIndex) < 100) fname << path << "/" << fnamenoext << ".00" << this -> CurrentTimeIndex << ext;
    else if((this -> CurrentTimeIndex) < 1000) fname << path << "/" << fnamenoext << ".0" << this -> CurrentTimeIndex << ext;
    else fname << path << "/" << fnamenoext << this -> CurrentTimeIndex << ext;
    }
  else
    {
    fname << this->FileName;
    }

//Here I call the usual VTK Writer and set the input

  vtkGenericDataObjectWriter* Writer = vtkGenericDataObjectWriter::New();
  Writer -> SetInput(inputCopy);
  Writer -> SetFileName(fname.str().c_str());
  if((this -> FileType) == 1) Writer -> SetFileTypeToASCII();
  else   Writer -> SetFileTypeToBinary();

  Writer -> Update();

  if (this->WriteAllTimeSteps)
    {
    this->CurrentTimeIndex++;
    if (this->CurrentTimeIndex == this->NumberOfTimeSteps)
      {
      // Tell the pipeline to stop looping.
      request->Remove(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::CONTINUE_EXECUTING());
      this->CurrentTimeIndex = 0;
      }
    }

  Writer -> Delete();
  return 1;

Is there anything I forget to delete?


thx for answers
Natalie

Out of curiosity, why are you writing your own wrapper? ParaView 3.6
onwards supports writing time series for legacy vtk files.

Hi all

as promised, I worked on directly integrating Ogg/Theora into ParaView  
(well, mostly into the VTK distributed with ParaView). I created issue http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9281 
  with patches attached to it. I tested it on Mac OS X 10.5.7, so if  
somebody could give it a spin on Linux and Windows and give me some  
feedback, that would be great.

Cheers

Michael

You probably know this already but in case you didn't you can turn
VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS on and that will help in finding VTK objects that don't get
deleted.

Hi All,

I was looking for the same thing this morning and ended up settling on  
a cvs check out:

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView3 login
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView3 co -r  
ParaView-3-6 ParaView3

Which I think is the correct incantation ...

I have written it months ago and it worked well for small files and timeseries for about 30 files - I have just come across it trying to write a time series of 200 files. 

I can already download ParaView 3.6? Great, I did not know this!

thx,
Natalie

Some notes on the CVS tags:
* ParaView-3-6 refers to the 3.6 Branch. All patch releases for 3.6
will be tagged on this branch.
* ParaView-3-6-0 tag is the initial ParaView.3.6.0 tag that we started
making the release binaries with.
* ParaView-3-6-1 tag is a newer tag which includes some installation
rule fixes over the 3-6-0 tag so that the installation processes is a
bit smoother. The binaries we are making available on our website are
based off this ParaView-3-6-1 tag.

You can't download 3.6 binaries yet. We should have them posted by

Subject: [Paraview] Text source font coloring in interpreter
Message-ID: <adb0f27a0907171154p10c736fap7e550483e105cb91@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

In the standalone Python interpreter I created a text source like this:

>> from paraview.simple import Text
>> text = Text()
>> text.Text = "Hello"

Next I would like to change the font/text color, since by default the
text is in white as is the background of my
visualization. However, I cannot find away to do it. I tried setting
"Color", "TextColor" etc. properties,
but these are not recognised.

Does anybody know how to do this?

Kind regards,

Marco

Try this:

from paraview.simple import *
Text(Text="Hello")
repr = Show()
help(repr)

That will show the list of available representation properties which
includes "Color", "FontFamily" etc

Mr. Nawijn,

I'm glad you've been asking these questions.  I'm also a
paraview/python newby.  And I'm benefiting a lot from your questions,
and seeing the answers to them.

Hi Marco,

May I also recommend you try out the new trace feature in paraview?
If you open the python shell, go to the "Trace" tab, and click "Start
Trace", then create a text source and change its color, then click the
"Show Trace" button, you'll get the python code you are looking for.
The trace output can be a little verbose sometimes, but it can give
you something to start from.

Pat

Hello Pat,

Thanks for the tip, I will give it a try. I actually tried it before,
but what I got
was not what I expected. Anyway, I might have used it the wrong way. I will
try again and let you know.

Regards,

Marco

Is it possible to have different "external command to start the
server" for each machine in machinelist.txt?

For example, on one of the machines I want to run
mpirun -np 8 pvserver

where on the rest simply
mpirun pvserver

Thanks,

David

Sort of.

The point of using MPI is to establish a "virtual parallel machine".
The physical machines that comprise that virtual parallel machine can
all work together because they are part of the same mpi job. The
parallel filters within VTK that paraview uses are only written to
work with the other machines in the same mpi job.

I say sort of because it is possible to run paraview in a split server
mode, consisting of exactly  two virtual parallel machines. One
machine first does most of the visualization pipeline filtering work,
then the other does most of the rendering pipeline work. These are
referred to as pvdataserver and pvrenderserver respectively. Inside
each server communication happens over MPI and between the two servers
communication happens over TCP instead of MPI, as it does between the
servers and the client.

You can refer the the parallel processing section of the ParaView
user's guide for details.

Ok, checked it out and build it, but how do I tell ParaView that I want it to write the whole time series?

thx,

When you are saving the data, once you have chosen the filename a  
dialog should popup which allows you to check the "Write all  
Timesteps" checkbox.

Hi Alin,

The PARAVIEW_USE_SILO option isn't really supported anymore, it has
been succeeded by the VisIt Database Bridge -
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge

Having said that, I can confirm that the silo reader
(vtkSiloReader.cxx) compiles and runs OK on linux using g++ 4.3.2.
You have to use the Silo060605 source downloaded from this page:
https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/source.html.  Newer versions of Silo
probably won't work.

Pat

Yes.  Compiling paraview 3.6.1 using g++ 4.3.2 and PARAVIEW_USE_SILO
enabled produces no errors, so long as you use the Silo060605 source
code I linked to in my previous email.  What version of Silo do you
have?  What is your platform and compiler?

Hi Alin,

That's correct, PARAVIEW_USE_SILO is only useful if you have compiled
and installed Silo.  After you enable PARAVIEW_USE_SILO in cmake, new
variables should appear for you to specify the silo installation:
SILO_INCLUDE_DIR and SILO_LIBRARY.

You keep cc'ing the cmake list, maybe a mistake?  Let's keep th
discussion to paraview at paraview.org.

Subject: [Paraview] [CMake]  3,6.1 and silo plugin
Message-ID: <200907182153.26001.alin.elena@ichec.ie>


Hi Pat,

Thanks for the info about the visit plugins.

I am afraid that I do not understand you. Can you compile the vtksiloReader 
from 3.6.1?


Linux opensuse 11.1 64 bit gcc (SUSE Linux) 4.3.2 [gcc-4_3-branch revision 
141291]
Should I understand that the silo support compiles only if I use the external 
lib?

regards,

Alin

Subject: [Paraview]  wrapITK in ParaView?
Message-ID: <fac5e9bb0907190350w4b0239ddv476ab2f8a463d1a7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to know if there is a "turn-key" possibility to use ITK classes
via python scripting in ParaView?
I saw that to use ITK classes in python scrip, one can use wrapITK. However,
it is not that straightforward as one has to compile first ITK, then wrapITK
using CMake.

Thus I wondered if  ITK classes can be somehow "activated" in the standard
ParaView package and made available for python scripts just like VTK classes
are? Most notably I have in mind to carry out mesh segmentation using the
itk::QEMeshDiscrete.......CurvatureEstimator classes introduced in this
InsightJournal paper http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/302

I have seen no clue during installation or on the web indicating that this
option was available, but maybe someone can indicate me easier solution like
where I may for instance download pre-compiled binaries?

I thank you in advance,
Regards,

Pierre

Not currently. The vtkXDMFReader does not pass the names from the xmf
file over to the multiblock dataset it produces which is needed for
ParaView to use those names. Please feel free to add a bug report to
the tracker. This shouldn't be too involved an issue to address.

I have made changes to Xdmf and vtkXdmfReader to handle new attributes 
which are
TopologyConstant and GeometryConstant within a temporal collection.

unfortunately, our Xdmf is branching quite a bit from the CVS version so 
I can't guarantee that you can use it out of the box. If you want to 
try, then have a look at look at the reader in here
https://svn.cscs.ch/pv-meshless/trunk/Utilities/Xdmf2/vtk/
I'll attach an XML example of the new attribs.

We also have a new XdmfWriter (not in above repository location), but it 
only works on special cases of data so I'm not sure if you can use it 
directly. The reader ought to at least function with CVS Xdmf. Maybe you 
can tweak your own Xdmf writing to add the attribs. If you are writing 
unstructured grids, then I can help, if not, perhaps we can talk off 
list and get something up and running.

NB : The attached xmf file has a temporal collection of multiblock 
(spatial collection ) datasets, some have constant topology/geometry 
others do not. The test is a rotating mixer inside a static region.

NB2 : I am currently on vacation, so I may not respond rapidly for a 
further week.

Message-ID: <20090720101130.janwa8vbrwjocs0k@webmail4.kuleuven.be>

Good day to all

I'm simply wondering if there is any data format that Paraview  
supports which is able to save its data binary in the half precision  
(IEEE 754-2008) format.

Kind greetings and a sincere thanks to those who know the answer,

I should have verified before I replied,  the feature didn't make it
into 3.6. However, with CVS ParaView, you can write legacy vtk or
vtk-xml files are time-series by checking the "Write all timesteps as
file-series" checkbox shown after you have selected the filename (and
this time, I verified :) )

Mike,

I could not reproduce this with a bunch of pngs that I tried loading
on a 64-bit linux box. Any more steps to reproduce?

	button
Message-ID: <2bd34dd10907200656g2cf0ec8crc5021c8a958e097@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I repeatedly have an issue when I drag the scene around using the
middle mouse button.

I will get a message:
endUndoSet called without a beginUndoSet.

And then paraview doesn't seem to recognize the MiddleMouseButtonUp,
and so even though I'm no longer holding the mouse down, the scene
continues to drag around.

Does anyone else have this issue?

Thanks,

Mark

Do you have things like scalars bars/3D Widgets in your scene? Are you
dragging out of the rendering window?

Ulkarsh,

I have no scalar bars or 3D widgets in the scene.  I'm also not
dragging out of the rendering window.

The way I rectify it is to repeatedly click the middle mouse button
until it recognizes the middlemouseup and stops dragging the scene
around.  I use ParaView 3.4.0 on both a Windows machine and a Linux
machine, and this behavior shows up on both platforms.


Thanks,

Mark

I admit that I have also seen this behavior on Mac.  It usually happens when I've been using ParaView for a while and I never saw a consistent way to replicate the problem.

Any file format that holds unstructured grid or poly data and supports 0D cells (vertices, points, spheres, or whatever you want to call them) is sufficient.  If the particles remain consistent from one time step to the next, then I recommend the Exodus format because it has direct support for time and you can place everything in a single file.  However, Exodus assumes that the topology of your data does not change, so it does not directly support particles that are born or die.

If you do have particles that are born and die, I've heard of success with the EnSight format.  If at all possible, also write out "global ids" that uniquely identify the particles from one timestep to the next.  If you do not have that, it limits what ParaView can do with the particles.

Yes, the VTK EnSight Reader does support particle files while I am not sure
if the term "particles" Alan mentioned is just the one supported by the VTK
EnSight Reader. There seem to be multiple definitions of "particles".  For
example, the one in 'measured particles' (supported by the VTK EnSight
Reader) might be different from that in 'particle tracing'.

I'm still having a couple of issues...

If I connect with "startup type: manual" after starting pvserver on
the remote machine, everything is working fine. If I connect with
"startup type: command" and put "pvserver" as the command, it says

"The startup command failed to start ... check your PATH and file
permissions " - even though I assured pvserver is on my path on the
remote machine ('which pvserver' returns the correct path')

If I put "/home/doriad/bin/ParaView3/bin/pvserver" as the command, it says

ERROR: In /home/doriad/src/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkClientSocket.cxx, line 54
vtkClientSocket (0xe7009f0): Failed to connect to server
sgi6110.ecse.rpi.edu:11111

ERROR: In /home/doriad/src/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx,
line 289
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0xe096790): Connect timeout.

I can password-less ssh (using rsa keys) both ways.

Does anyone know what would cause this behavior?

Thanks,

David

Ken,
Why not use a VTK format for particle support?  Lack of direct time support?  Or, would it be that other programs cannot read it?

Anyone know if VisIt can read current VTK file formats?

Yes, basically I would not recommend it due to the lack of time support.  I'm not even sure there is a direct way to add a time stamp to each step.  It could be a quick and dirty solution, though.

Message-ID: <498661.48448.qm@web110106.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm experiencing something weird when opening Ensight case files with ParaView. 

I am able to open them normally, and ParaView instantiates a Multiblock Dataset with the parts corresponding to the ones contained in the .geo file. But when I open the model, the "number of points" info in the "information" tab doesn't seem to be right. It displays the same number to all the components (which does not correspond to the reality) and this number is quite larger than the real number of point.

I posted an example in the link below. I opened a Multiblock and extracted a block of it. ParaView says it has 38560 points, but it is visually obvious that this information is wrong. Is this a bug ?

Hi Rafael:

    I cannot determine whether or not it is a bug by simply looking at the
snapshot. Would you please provide me with the dataset (the CASE file and
the referenced files) so that I can look into this issue?

    Thanks.

Hi Rafael:

   I notice you are using ParaView 3.4.0, not a update-to-date version.
There have been many fixes since it. Any way, I would be glad to check it
with the latest version if you could provide the dataset.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.6 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <7ba9d6a30907201037g2280cc9bn6dbadcc91e86df91@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

Kitware, Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Lab are
proud to announce the release of ParaView 3.6. The binaries and
sources are available for download from the ParaView website
(http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html). This
release includes several new features along with plenty of bug fixes
addressing a multitude of usability and stability issues including
those affecting parallel volume rendering. For a more exhaustive list,
please refer to http://paraview.org/Bug/roadmap_page.php

Based on user feedback, ParaView's Python API has undergone a major
overhaul. The new simplified scripting interface makes it easier to
write procedural scripts mimicking the steps users would follow when
using the GUI to perform tasks such as creating sources, applying
filters, etc. Details on the new scripting API can be found on the
Paraview Wiki.

We have been experimenting with adding support for
additional file formats such as CGNS, Silo, Tecplot using VisIt
plugins. Since this is an experimental feature, only the Linux
binaries distributed from our website support these new file formats.

ParaView now natively supports tabular data-structures thus improving
support for CSV files including importing CSV files as point-sets or
structured grids. We have completely redesigned the charting/plotting
components with several performance fixes as well as usability
improvements. It is possible to plot arrays from arbitrary datasets
directly using Plot Data filter. Upon hovering over the plots tooltips
are shown which detail the plotted values.

In an effort to better support animations involving the camera, we
have added support for specifying camera movements along splines or
for orbiting around objects in space. This version has many GUI
usability improvements including, but definitely not limited to:
? Color palettes which make it easier to switch between color schemes
that are suitable for printing and for screen.
? Improved support for temporal readers and filters.
? Axes annotations and scalar bar for 2D render view.
? Zooming to selected region in 3D view.
? Quick launch for creating sources and filters using Ctrl+Space or Alt+Space.

Apart from these enhancements, ParaView includes a pre-alpha release of
OverView, an application developed using the ParaView application
framework. OverView is a generalization of the ParaView scientific
visualization application designed to support the ingestion,
processing and display of informatics data. The ParaView client-server
architecture provides a mature framework for performing scalable
analysis on distributed memory platforms, and OverView uses these
capabilities to analyze informatics problems that are too large for
individual workstations. This application still contains many
experimental features and is not yet documented, but feel free to try
it out and report bugs and feature requests.

StreamingParaView, another application developed using the ParaView
application framework.  StreamingParaView processes structured
datasets in a piecewise fashion, on one or many processors. Because
the entire dataset is never loaded into memory at once,
StreamingParaView makes it possible to visualize large datasets on
machines that have insufficient RAM to do so otherwise. Piece culling,
reordering and caching preserve ParaView's normally high interactivity
while streaming. This application still contains many experimental
features and is not yet documented, but we encourage users to try it
out and report bugs and feature requests.

Currently, both OverView and StreamingParaView are available through
source alone.

Bugs, feature requests and any questions or issues can be posted to
the ParaView Mailing List at paraview at paraview.org.

As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better and
powerful. We are experimenting with a new user-feedback mechanism.
Please use http://paraview.uservoice.com/ or click
on the "Tell us what you think" link of www.paraview.org to leave your
feedback and vote for new features.

The ParaView Team.

Jona,

I just tried your script. I am not sure why you are not using
AnimateReader()? I just used it and it saved 4 frames as I'd expect.
Here's my script. take a look at
ParaView/Utiltiies/VTKPythonWrapping/simple.py to see how
AnimateReader is implemented if you want to do it yourself.

from paraview.simple import *

reader_base = servermanager.sources.PVDReader()
reader_base.FileName = "/tmp/coupe.pvd"
reader_base.UpdatePipeline()

Show(reader_base)
Render()

reader_base.TimestepValues
#>>> [0.0, 5.0, 6.0, 10.0]

AnnotateTimeFilter()
Show()

Render()

# Render the animation AnimateReader(reader, view, filename=None)
AnimateReader(reader_base, filename="/tmp/foo.png")

Hi Rafael and Zhanping,

I've found out what is going on. I've loaded the Rafael's dataset (we are
co-workers at the same lab) in PV-3.6 and PV-3.4 as well. The confusion is
due to the Ensight file format. Rafael is using Ensight 6 format (not the
Gold one). In Ensight 6, the point coordinates for the whole grid is firstly
inserted in the geometry file, in the "coordinates" section, and the
following parts are defined by cells that use only some of these points.
Note that the cell parts do not have any information regarding points. Just
cell incidences are listed. In order to show the correct number of points
that each part uses, ParaView should have some algorithm to count the points
actually used.

The main difference between Ensight 6 and Ensight Gold is that in Ensight
Gold the point coordinates must be informed for each part.

Here goes the data (if you're still interested)
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/Basic_Shape_1.zip

Regards

Renato.

I just installed paraview-3.6.1-win32-x86.exe in Windows XP. When I
run, I get the error:

The application or DLL C:\Program Files\Paraview

Subject: [Paraview]  ParaView 3.6.1 - installation on Windows XP - error?
Message-ID: <fac5e9bb0907210033l1ba7918eg4fd5a5aa9211915@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Thanks ParaView team for your great work.
I however meet a problem after installing ParaView 3.6.1 on a Windows XP
service pack 2 computer where I have no administrator rights, while it was
not the case with ParaView 3.4.0. The error message tells me that:

"This application has not been able to start because the application
configuration is not correct. Reinstalling the application may solve the
problem."

Of course it doesn't solve much... Neither restarting the computer...
 Is there a Windows compatibility problem?
 On the ParaView wiki, I see that ParaView 3.6.1-win32-x86.exe has indeed
been compiled on the platform:

paraview-3.6.1-win32-x86.exe

   - Built on Windows Vista x64 SP2
   - Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition 9.0.30729.1 SP
   - python 2.5.4
   - Qt 4.3.5 open source version

May it be because the computer I use is not updated to Windows Vista?
And why Vista x64? Is it an error on the wiki?

I thank you in advance for your help.


Regards,


Pierre

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 3.6.1 python dll error
Message-ID: <4A6575C5.9010005@sirehna.com>

For information :

when installing the new paraview 3.6.1 binary on windows 32 bits, I have 
the following error at the launch :

"wrong windows image for pyhton25.dll"

I finally copied my own python25.dll  (2Mo) to replace the one that goes 
with paraview binary (2.6Mo same file date !).
Everything seems ok now. Should I expect some disfunctionning features 
because of that ?

After first basic test, the only thing that goes wrong is error when 
launching help because of QtAssistant (I guess i miss some qt dll ?)

I would like to test cgns import but didn't see the extension on the 
open panel. Do i need a special paraview version for this (or maybe a 
self-compiled one ??)

Hello.

I am trying the Linux64-x86 binaries of Paraview 3.6.1 and I can't find 
readers for CGNS or Tecplot that should be included in the Linux 
binaries as you said in your announcement:
> We have been experimenting with adding support for
> additional file formats such as CGNS, Silo, Tecplot using VisIt

>   
I am very interested in PV using these formats. Is CGNS and Tecplot 
support really included in the Linux binaries or do we have to download 
something else or to build PV from source with Vislt plugins?

Thank you in advance.

I finally found that the visit plugin could be loaded from the 
tools/manage plugin menu.

But after loading it, when i try to open a cgns file i have the 
following error :

Warning: In 
..\..\..\src\Plugins\VisItDatabaseBridge\vtkVisItDatabase.cxx, line 342

vtkVisItDatabase (07D43DA8): Failed to initialize plugin manager with 
plugin path : C:\Kitware\ParaView-3-6\bin\bin\Release and plugin Id :

and so on for all visit readers....

to complete the problem :

after loading visit plugin :  when i am on the open panel, if I choose 
cgns (beta), all files are removed from the file selection window (even 
.cgns).
I can not do anything else than selecting "all files" to be able to 
select the cgns file, and then after doing ok, I have the former crash 
in the message window.

Subject: [Paraview]  Paraview 3,6.1 crashes on Windows Vista 32
Message-ID: <4A6582DA.7030507@onera.fr>

Hello,

I downloaded the Paraview 3.6.1 binaries for Windows at 
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/paraview-3.6.1-win32-x86.exe and I 
installed it on a Windows Vista 32 bits System.

Installation is OK, but when starting Paraview I get this error message 
from Windows:

"C:\Program Files\Paraview 3.6.1\bin\python23.dll is not buit to run on 
Windows or it contains errors. Please install again..."

Of course installing again does not help.
But as Paraview 3.4.0 works fine, I tried to replace "python25.dll" in 
Paraview 3.6.1 by "python25.dll" from Paraview 3.4.0.
Then Paraview 3.6.1 starts and I can draw my data, but the Help menu (or 
Help by pressing F1) fails and I get this error message from Paraview:

"Failed to start Qt assistant."

So what happens with PV 3.6.1 ? I am rather disappointed as PV 3.4.0 is 
working without a problem.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi Luc

We are looking into this right now and believe there is just a typo in an
installation script. We should have this fixed soon. Thanks for letting us
know about this problem.

Message-ID: <4A65CD4C.8030907@onera.fr>

Hello

I think that Luc is speaking about the Windows version but there is a 
similar problem on the Linux64-x86 version: it is impossible to load the 
VisIt plugin from the binaries:

> Using "Tool / Manage plugins" menu from the "(PV installation root 
> folder)/bin/plugins/VisItReaderPlugin" folder gives me this error:
> QLibrary::load_sys: Cannot load 
> /tmp_user/eos060/grenon/paraview-3.6.1-Linux-x86_64/bin/plugins/VisItReaderPlugin/libVisItReaderPlugin.so 
> (liblightweight_visit_vtk.so: cannot open shared object file: No such 
> file or directory)
I checked that libVisItReaderPlugin.so and liblightweight_visit_vtk.so 
both existed in the binaries tree.

Maybe this may help you.

For your information, I had posted this Linux problem on the "Paraview 
3.6 announcement" thread but I think the better place is here.

Best regards.

Hi Renato:

   As I explained to Rafael yesterday, the current version of VTK EnSight
Reader-6 just adopts a storage mechanism complying with the format of
EnSight-6. In other words, a common set of points, in the form of a
vtkPoints object, is created that is then accessed by those constituent
blocks to construct the topology (in the form of tetrahedra, wedges, and so
forth) of the data. The information of each block (shown via ParaView panel)
refers to the number of the aforementioned common / super set of points
(instead of the exact set used to define the block topology). I consulted
our group leader and was told to currently keep this situation as is.

   To add some code to show the exact number of points making a block, I
need to discuss it with our group leader.

   Thanks for your suggestions and the dataset. BTW, your understanding of
the number of points issue is correct.

I see at http://www.vizworld.com/2009/07/paraview-3-6-released/#more-6602that
ParaView 3.6 has been "released", but the website shows 3.6.1, and
downloads are disabled?

What's up?

Hi Randall,
There is a problem with a corrupt DLL in the windows amongst some other
problems. They are being resolved as we speak and the download should be
re-enabled later today or early tomorrow at the latest. I apologize for the
inconvenience.

Thank you very much for the detailed explanation Pat, we are now able to
position and scale our VRML models (im working along with Andres who sent
the question). Thank you also to you Utkarsh for the help. Just for the tip
i finally downcasted to a vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty when calling
GetProperty("Position") on the proxy.

Thanks again.

Traditionally, the paraview-*.tar.gz source tarball has had Unix (LF) 
line endings, but the 3.6.1 tarball has CRLF line endings.  Playing 
havoc with my patches...

Thanks for reporting. We'll fix that as soon as possible.

Subject: [Paraview] Pv as 3D file format converter
Message-ID: <35457dd70907212039l2126d55dpeb8f34d7585bd525@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I want to ask the opinion of experienced users before I begin using
Paraview. I am already using two other 3D modelling packages for very
different purposes, and need a way to pass files between them. The list of
available export file formats from the first modelling package is quite
short, and the list of import file formats for the second is also very
short. Currently we are able to use 2D DXF, but not 3D DXF. Instead, I have
had some success with STL as an interchange format for 3D files. I need to
at the least convert surface meshes to STL from either DXF, or TSURF (GoCad:
pdgm.com).

It seems to me on first look that Paraview might be a good front-end for the
vtk library, which I think can do the file conversions I need. So I would
like to know if it would be worthwhile to use Paraview for converting my
files? Am I on the right track?

I'm not familiar with Python, but I'm not shy of learning some new skills.

Cheers,
Ben

Hi,

I would like to have the possibility to generate multiviews similar to the
one attached automatically.
That is, choose the variables to show, (let's say 8 variables for example),
and automatically have 8 subwindows that open up, with each camera linked to
the first window, and each colored by one of the variables, ideally with the
colormap for each as well, and the possibility to have all the colormap
ranges similar.
Do you think this is easily done, if so where should I start?
I would like to script or code this (either C++ or python).

Thanks,
Jacques

This is what comparative view is for.
Pick one or two properties of any filter (or two) in the pipeline,
specify the x and y dimensions and it will do it for you.

How do you specify the X and Y dimensions ?
How do you have one variable plotted per frame ? For example velocity on the
1st quadrant, pressure on the 2nd, enthalpy on the 3rd etc .... ?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.6 (Windows) dowload issues and CSV
	clarification
Message-ID: <SNT108-W18C341725C0826CC8C3BBF8A1B0@phx.gbl>


Hello

Just seen the announcement for Paraview 3.6 being released, but at the download page it is disabled. Is there a major problem with the release? I use Paraview 3.4 on both Windows XP (SP3) and Vista.

I understand from the release note that it now supports tabular-data structures (like CSV). Now just to clarify, does this mean that it will now be able to load data in the following format:

e.g. XYZ(position) C(value) 

1 1 1 5
1 2 1 2
2 1 2 4
2 4 1 5
....
....
3 1 3 7 etc

Will the program understand the use of any delimiter, like a space or will it expect a comma (for true CSV)? Can it accept several entries for the value at position XYZ e.g. XYZC1 XYZC2 XYZC3 etc, such that we can define varied properties at a given positional point.

Look forward to testing the new version when it's available to download!

Lester

Lester,

There was a problem with the binaries we released day before
yesterday. Thanks to the active community we were able to identify the
issues and should have the new binaries enabled on the website within
a few hours.

Your understanding of CSV support is correct. You should be able to
load in any "delimiter" separated files, be it "," or spaces; then
apply the "Table to Points" filter to map the columns to point
coordinates.

For specifying more properties at a point location I'd choose the
following format:

X, Y, Z, Variable1, Variable2, Variable 3
0, 0, 0, 12, 112, 1112
1, 1, 1, 13, 113, 1113
etc.

Hom Nath,

Thanks for reporting this issue. We are aware it and will have fixed
versions of the binaries available for download shortly. I'll post a
fresh announcement once the new binaries go live.

Thanks for your patience,

Folks,

Thanks to your quick feedback, we were able to track down the issues
with the binaries and the new binaries are now available for download
at:
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html. We greatly
appreciate your patience with this.

A caveat before people try the new "VisIt plugin" for readers: as
noted in the release announcement, the plugin is in an experimental
feature, and hence only available with the linux and 32-windows
binaries and that too not loaded by default.

Once again, thank you for your patience.

Utkarsh

Hello

I have just downloaded the new PV 3.6.1 Linux64 and Windows 32.
I have tested CGNS and Tecplot on Linux and Tecplot on Windows with 
VisIt plugin.
All is working fine!
Great job! Thank you very much all!

It looks like I may have forgotten to paste the most important error!

ERROR: In /home/doriad/src/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx,
line 192
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0xdd64560): Failed to set up server socket.

Does anyone know what would cause this?

Thanks,

Some other processes is already listening on  the port (default 11111
for pvserver), hence you are getting the error.

Hi,

Comparative view has two modes- filmstrip and comparative.  In filmstrip
mode, only one variable changes and the views are ordered from left to
right, top to bottom.  In comparative mode, you can specify an X dimension
and a Y dimension and can have one variable change along X and another
change along Y.

Try this for a quick example:

Create sphere source
Convert view to 3D View (Comparative)
Go to the View menu and toggle on the Comparative View Inspector
Change the mode from filmstrip to comparative.
Set 4 x frames and 4 y frames
In Animated Source (X Axis) choose Phi Resolution as the Property To Animate
Likewise, choose Theta Resolution for the Y Axis
Use the timeline widgets below to step the phi and theta resolutions from 3
to 100.
Click the Update Button (if you dont want to click the update button each
time, change the Update Mode combobox from Root to All)

Unforutnately when trying out this demo on my own computer I discovered a
bug where some of the views do not get the correct property value :-(  Let
me know if you have similar problems.

Hi Utkarsh

Downloaded the new windows version and it seems to work ok; haven't tested it fully yet on the CSV option.

The table to points filter works without issue - generating points and assigning attributes from the variable(s). The table to structured grid however fails with three copies of the error message:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\Graphics\vtkTableToStructuredGrid.cxx, line 98
vtkPTableToStructuredGrid (0A195768): The input table must have exactly 1 rows. Currently it has 8 rows.

I have just tried a very quick data cube to test the basic functionality:

X, Y, Z, V1, V2
0, 1, 0, 1, 2
0, 0, 1, 2, 1
1, 0, 0, 1, 2
1, 1, 0, 2, 3
0, 1, 1, 3, 4
1, 1, 1, 3, 5
0, 0, 0, 6, 2
1, 0, 1, 3, 5

As expected it will generate the eight points of the cube. Is something extra required to generate a structured (or unstructured) grid that can then be sliced etc? Perhaps if you have a working example that shows the table to points/table to structured grid working properly. I have only tested on Windows XP at present.

I understand your example, but I am not interested in only 2 "dimensions"
also, thes "dimensions" are filter properties to animate. What I want is
just to show as many views as I have of fields in my dataset (Animation does
not really matter at all). So I come back to my original question.

Correct, comparative view is only useful for viewing changes in filter
properties or time.

It may be possible to "cheat" to get comparative view to do some of what you
want, but is definitely not an ideal solution...

Instead of 1 dataset with 8 variables, save your dataset 8 times, each with
a different variable but use the same variable name.  Now create a .pvd file
that has 8 timesteps, each timestep points to one of the datasets.  The
comparative view will automatically show one "timestep" in each view frame,
but really you're looking at your 8 different data variables.  The cameras
will be linked.  All datasets will have to share the same colormap.

For a real solution I'd want to script it in python... the problem is that
you cannot easily specify the view layout in the gui from the python
interface.  Everything else can be done (creating views, camera links,
colormaps).  If you're interested, it might not be too hard to extend the
python interface to so that you can get the view layout that you want.
You'd have to get into paraview's qt code though.

Hi,
I have tried Table to Points with the file of Lester. So far very nice, but is it posible to get distinct radii of this points. Normally I have a list with x,y,z, radius and some properties. In which way can I display the different radius of my particles?
Many thanks

Apply glyph filter, vary sphere glyph radius by scalar.
Or, use the CSCS point sprites plugin, if that is available on your machine.

Thanks David, it works fine. But if I use about 20.000 Particles there is one problem with 
PainterPolyDataMapper. It rescale always the image and the tool dont work fast. Is there any trick to supress it or to improve the speed?
Many Thanks

Message-ID: <4A68193A.5080101@onera.fr>

Hello.

Using the help menu in Paraview 3.6.1 Windows 32 gives an error:

> Profile 'bin\pqClient.adp' does not exist!
> Qt Assistant crashed.
But 'pqClient.adp' exists in the 'bin' folder!

Workaround:
- stop Paraview
- go to the 'bin' folder in Paraview tree.
- edit the file 'pqClientDocFinder.txt'
- replace the last line 'bin\pqClient.adp' by 'pqClient.adp'
- restart Paraview: help is now working.

Note: in the Linux Version, help works with unmodified 
'pqClientDocFinder.txt' file with last line being 'bin/pqClient.adp'

Hi Michal,

You can try the point sprite representation.
For this, you need to load the needed plugin (in 
bin/plugins/CSCS_PointSprite_GUIPlugin and 
bin/plugins/CSCS_PointSprite_GUIPlugin_Server).
After this, load your data, choose Point Sprite for the representation.
In the Display tab, you will have a new PointSprite group box enabled,.
Turn the point sprite mode to Sphere.
You can then choose the field to scale by in the combo box. 
By default, the radius linearly scales from 0 to the default radius. If 
you have a field giving the real radius, you can force ParaView to use it 
directly :
open the "Edit Radius Transer Function" editor, and check the 
"Proportionnal" check box.

Objet
[Paraview] Particles via CSV






Hi,
I have tried Table to Points with the file of Lester. So far very nice, 
but is it posible to get distinct radii of this points. Normally I have a 
list with x,y,z, radius and some properties. In which way can I display 
the different radius of my particles?
Many thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Generate cubic cells from box glyph
Message-ID: <4A68383A.3030904@gmail.com>

Hi,
How can I make the box-glyph represent a cubic cell? So that it is a 
single entity (solid cubic cell), and not 6 planes that build up a box 
with a void inside.

Why? I load my OctTree adaptive mesh refinement data via a CSV file 
(X,Y,Z,size), with (X,Y,Z) the cell center and (size) the cell size. 
Using the box-glyph I can see the whole mesh topology without having to 
write out the corner points of every cubic cell. Or is there another way 
of writing out OctTree?

Thanks!
Ivo

CSV example data:

X,Y,Z,size,cellno,haskids
2,2,2,1,1,1
2,2,3,1,2,0
2,3,2,1,3,0
3,2,2,1,4,0
2,3,3,1,5,0
3,2,3,1,6,0
3,3,2,1,7,0
3,3,3,1,8,0
2.25,2.25,2.25,0.5,9,0
2.25,2.25,1.75,0.5,10,0
2.25,1.75,2.25,0.5,11,0
1.75,2.25,2.25,0.5,12,0
2.25,1.75,1.75,0.5,13,0
1.75,2.25,1.75,0.5,14,0
1.75,1.75,2.25,0.5,15,0
1.75,1.75,1.75,0.5,16,0

load CSV -> TableToPoints -> Glyph (box, scale with scalar 'size', scale 
factor=1) -> optionally filter out parent cells using threshold on the 
haskids value.

Subject: [Paraview]  Testing CGNS reader with PV 3.6.1 and VisIt plugin
Message-ID: <4A684B9C.1080008@onera.fr>

Hello.

I have made several tests with the CGNS reader. Some files are readable, 
some other files are freezing PV.

1. Here is an exemple from the CGNS site that contain both grid and CFD 
solution for a delta wing and that works:
http://cgns.sourceforge.net/CGNSFiles/Chris/delta.cgns.gz

2. CGNS files that contain only the grid also work. Tested large ONERA 
CGNS files and STANFORD CGNS test files. Here is a STANFORD test file 
for the supersonic business jet:
http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/vdweide/CGNSFiles/BusinessJet.cgns

3. Trying to include the CFD solution file does not work. Here are the 
two STANFORD solution files for the supersonic business jet:
http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/vdweide/CGNSFiles/SolBusinessJet.cgns = 
volume solution file.
http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/vdweide/CGNSFiles/SolBusinessJet.cgns_surface 
= surface solution file.

Reading the surface solution file works, but nothing is visible. The 
information panel shows strange very big values for X, Y, Z bounds 
(almost infinte)!
Trying to read the volume solution file freezes Paraview.

The same problem arises withthe DLR F6 wing-body example:
http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/vdweide/CGNSFiles/wb_hex_coarse.cgns = 
grid for the DLR F6 wing-body is readable.
http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/vdweide/CGNSFiles/WBSolKW.cgns = 
solution file => freezes PV.

4. Conclusion:
Good job to have added CGNS and Tecplot support to PV (Tecplot tested 
without a problem until now).
VisIt plugin can read CGNS grid files (even large) or single files 
including both grid and CFD solution works.
But still some problems in CGNS when the grid and the CFD solution are 
in separated files.

Hi Richard,
If you run ParaView from the shortcut on the start menu it "should" work.
This is because the shortcut runs from the top level installation directory
(C:\Program Files\Paraview) This is a know problem that I've only been able
to recreate by running the binary directly from the installation folder
(C:\Program Files\ParaView\bin) or by running ParaView from a command prompt
after cd'ing to the bin folder.

http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9298

<http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9298>Where you able to recreate
it a different way? How did you launch ParaView to get this to happen? You
are correct in that the problem is with pqClientDocFinder. Our goal is to
get rid of that all together.

The Animation Inspector has been removed.  It was redundant with the Animation View and a lot harder to use.  Use the Animation View instead.  Missing options like the for cache geometry should now be found in ParaView settings.

Hello Dave.

In fact, I have made myself a shortcut fom (C:\Program Files\ParaView 
3.6.1\bin\paraview.exe)  to the Desktop (by send to Desktop) as I did 
with PV 340 and I always launch PV from that Desktop shortcut. OK, now 
that I have modified (pqClientDocFinder.txt), I can verify that Help 
crashes if I launch PV from the start menu shorcut.

I tested always PV 340: help works whether PV 340 is launched from its 
Desktop shortcut or from the start menu shortcut. I did not find any 
(pqClientDocFinder.txt) file in the bin folder of PV 340. Why not retain 
the PC 340 solution for help?

But indeed this is a minor problem. I you have time, please look at my 
recent post on CGNS testing.

Best regards.

Hello,

I would like to export a Paraview view to VRML/X3D. It works fine
trough the GUI, however I would like to know if it is possible to do
it from a Python interpreter. I tried to use the new trace option in
the python console launched from withing Paraview, but it does not
show anything. Does this mean the functionality is not available in
Python?

Kind regards,

Marco

from paraview.simple import *
# create the exporters module since it's not currently created
# by default (adding a BUG for that)
exporters = servermanager.createModule("exporters")
Cone()
Show()
view = Render()
x3dExporter = exporters.X3DExporter(View=view, FileName="/tmp/foo.x3d")
x3dExporter.Write()

Do dir(exporters) to list the available exporters

Richard,

Thanks for reporting the issues. The VisIt plugin that was released
with 3.6 is indeed in a very experimental stage. We do plan to evolve
it further to be more stable and easier to build/use.

Utkarsh,

I understood that this VisIt plugin was an experimental stage. But if 
the CGNS reader is not fully OK, at least we have a Tecplot reader that 
seems to work. Up to now, I tested Surface Tecplot files with CFD data 
and I had no problem.
May I suggest to add a special link in the Paraview binaries download 
page for testing future versions of the VisIt plugin?

Thank you for the job.

Richard

Hi Jacques,

That depends on how familiar you are with paraview's servermanager c++ api
and pq (paraview qt) api.  I'm not sure what you had in mind, but you could
create a plugin that adds a panel/toolbar/menu to paraview in which you
provide a button that triggers some c++ code to setup the multiview for your
data.  Most of the c++ code could be written using just servermanager api,
but you'd have to touch some qt code to setup the view layout.

Except for the view layout problem, I think python is easier.  Often what
takes 10-20 lines in servermanager c++ takes just 1 line in python using the
paraview.simple module.

Subject: [Paraview] CSCS_PointSprite_GUIPlugins fail to load on Win32...
Message-ID: <4A686D94.7050803@gmx.de>

Hello,

When i try to load the CSCS_PointSprite_GUI plugins, which come with the 
win32 binary release from the bin\plugin directory error message pops up:

Plugin Load Failed:

The file '[...] CSCS_PointSprite_GUIPlugin_Server.dll' is not a valid Qt 
plugin

The same happens with CSCS_PointSprite_GUIPlugin.dll

My System:

Windows XP SP3 32-bit
paraview-3.6.1-win32 binary (installer) from the Paraview Website 
(Thursday 03/27)

TIA,

Kalle.

P.S.: The same happens with a self compiled paraview 3.6.1 on win32 :-)

The plugin needs the file libCSCS_PointSprite_Rendering.so which is not 
there.

Ah, thanks.
This seems to be an installer issue.

I found two additional (missing) libCSCS dlls in the Build directory of 
my self compiled Paraview:

CSCS_PointSprite_Rendering.dll and
CSCS_PointSprite_Graphics.dll

copied them to the \bin directory of the 'official' Paraview Release.

The SCSC-PointSprite-plugin dlls load without any error now.

According to the 'Particles via CSV' thread there should happen some 
magic in the Display-Tab (or Display Panel):

'After this, load your data, choose Point Sprite for the representation.
In the Display tab, you will have a new PointSprite group box enabled,'

I can't find a 'PointSprite group box' or a 'Point Sprite 
representation' selector anywhere.
What I'am doing wrong?

TIA,

Kalle.

Message-ID: <SNT108-W625B13FE69A9967CBDEFE38A180@phx.gbl>


Hello

It is good to see that there is now CSV import functionality, which works fine for displaying points (e.g. using Glyphs), but if you want to do more interesting work, you need a structured grid. The option to take the loaded CSV data and convert it to a Structured Grid is listed (Table to Structure Grid). However, this always fails with the same error message (Windows XP and Vista)

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\Graphics\vtkTableToStructuredGrid.cxx, line 98
vtkPTableToStructuredGrid (0A195768): The input table must have exactly 1 rows. Currently it has 8 rows.


ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\Filtering\vtkExecutive.cxx, line 757
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0A1952A0): Algorithm vtkPTableToStructuredGrid(0A195768) returned failure for request: vtkInformation (09987D80)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 9473124
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA
  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1
  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0

I have tested this on a multilayer volume and it fails as above: the Table to Points always works. What we want is to have Paraview
interpolate the data between the points such that a volume can be sliced etc. Is there a problem with this option?

Lester

Hi Kalle,

You must load the plugin before you load your data. 
If your data is already loaded, the new representation will not be 
enabled.

Hm, but if I run pvserver and then connect with 'manual' it works
fine. If I try to send the 'pvserver' command, it fails with that
socket error. I also tried it on a different port (11113) and sending
command 'pvserver --server-port=11113' which I checked with netstat to
ensure nothing was using it. It's the same story on this port. I can
connect if I start the pvserver manually and use 'manual', but the
same socket error occurs if I try to start it with the command.

Thanks,

David

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but it sounds like you are giving
paraview a command to start the server and expecting paraview to log into
the remote machine to execute the command?  The command will be run on your
client machine.  So you need to write a shell script that will take care of
launching pvserver on the remote machine.  If you are using mpi you can do
this with mpirun, and use a machinefile that lists the remote machines.

David, can you do these two things?

1) from the shell on the local machine, ssh to one node of the remote
machine and execute a command without supplying a password (ie you
have ssh authentication set up)
ex.
kargad> ssh amber1 uname -a
Linux amber1 2.6.18-6-amd64 #1 SMP Tue Aug 19 04:30:56 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux

2) log on the first node of the remote machine, set up a machine file
listing the nodes in the remote, then run mpirun to start a parallel
job on all of the server nodes
kargad> ssh amber1
amber1> cat > ~/mymachinefile.txt
amber1
amber2
Ctrl-D
amber1> mpirun -m ~/mymachinefile.txt -np 2 /bin/uname -a
Linux amber1 2.6.18-6-amd64 #1 SMP Tue Aug 19 04:30:56 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Linux amber2 2.6.18-6-amd64 #1 SMP Tue Aug 19 04:30:56 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux

If you can do those two things, then your command should be
ssh remotemachine mpirun -np N pvserver

So i did...
The PointSprite_GUIPlugins were manually loaded immediately after 
paraview started.

Yes of course.

Are we talking about the ObjectInspector->Display Panel?

ObjectInspector(panel)->Display(panel)->Style->Representation ?

I played around with other types of point-sources, but i couldn't see 
any change in the GUI.

Hi Stephane,

it's working now!

When i start my self compiled paraview (win32) in it's build directory 
(without any installation) everything is fine. (Paraview 3.6.1, CVS, 2 
weeks ago).

PointSprite can be selected as representation and i see a decent config 
panel for the PointSprite Properties.

But there might remain the issue with the two missing shared libs in the 
installer for win und linux...

Thanks,

Kalle.

Attached is a sample csv file.
Since the CSV file has 8 points, we can create a grid  with extents
(2x2x2). Hence set the Whole Extent on the "Table To Structured Grid"
filter to be (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1). Then choose the columns to use for
the point coordinates and hit apply.

I guessing what you are missing is setting of the "Whole Extent" on the panel.

Message-ID: <4A695BB3.1070609@sirehna.com>

while doing some test with the new release of pv 3.6, I found a strange 
behaviour of the screenshot feature :

When i do a screenshot for cell data, screenshot image is not good 
because it's too dark.
If i do screenshot for point data, light is ok and image is good

it appears that it is not specific to 3.6 version (same pb in 3.4)

in attachment : results of my tests for pv 3.6 (left side is cell data 
and right side is point data)

is it a problem of graphic hardware ?

Subject: [Paraview] Suppress X display while saving images from Python script
Message-ID: <adb0f27a0907240114g5b4d6297pc7a8df7c3a11465f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have Python script that generates PNG images from a Paraview
session. This in essence works very well. The one problem that I have
is that an OpenGL window is created whenever I save the image. When
you do this in a loop, it becomes a little annoying, since the window
(at least on my Fedora box) automatically gets focus.

Is there a way to generate the PNG images without popping up a window?
Is it hardware/driver/platform dependent? I am using Paraview 3.7
(CVS) and Fedora FC11, NVIDIA proprietary drivers.

For completeness and maybe for the interest of other people, I copied
the body of my PNG image generation procedure below. Notice the
explicit deletions at the end of the script. These are mandatory in my
case since I update for example the colour legend in each step of the
loop.

        # Instantiate a Paraview VTU reader
        reader = XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName=model.filename)

        lt = MakeBlueToRedLT(max_val, min_val)

        bar = CreateScalarBar(LookupTable=lt, Title=key)
        bar.LabelColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
        bar.TitleColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
        bar.LabelFontSize = 12
        bar.AspectRatio   = 15.0
        bar.AutomaticLabelFormat = 0

        Show()
        Render()

        view = GetActiveView()
        view.Background = [1,1,1]

OK, I didn't know you can edit frames directly in the Animation View. It seems to be working smoothly.
Thanks!

Ben, I use paraview for converting files quite often. See this for
setting up your environment:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Getting_Started

And this is an example of how to do a conversion.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Convert_a_File_from_PLY_to_VTP

I have not worked with STL as you suggested, I usually use PLY to go
between formats, but we may be using different types of data.

Thanks,

David

Go to the "Edit | Settings" dialog. Then on the "Render View"
sub-pane, uncheck "Use offscreen rendering for screenshots". Does that
overcome of the issue?

This is a great idea. I would love to see the stream tracer use more
meta-data about block neighbors for performance optimization. We may
get to it at one point. If you have time, I would be happy to make
suggestions on how to implement it.

Ok, getting much closer - just a couple of questions

1)
If I see "Display is not accessible on the server side - remote
rendering will be disabled" on a machine with no rendering hardware, I
need to make sure Mesa is configured properly and start the server
with --use-offscreen-rendering. However, if the machine DOES have
graphics hardware (I'm assuming a normal video card counts as graphics
hardware?), then why would I see that warning?

2) Does the data have to be available to all of the machines? I have
the following setup:

Computer A: my desktop
Computer B: a machine with 8 cores

I want to use 1 core on Computer A and 8 cores on Computer B.

I start the server on Computer A with:
mpirun -machinefile machines.txt pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

where machines.txt contains
ComputerA_IP
ComputerB_IP slots=8

Then I use paraview on Computer A to connect to the server running on
Computer A.

Everything seems to go smoothly. However, now when I go to open data
(which is located on Computer A at
/media/portable/Data/2cars/car_0.vtp) I get the following error for
each process and nothing ever gets displayed in paraview:

Process id: 1 >> ERROR: In

Does anyone know why that would happen?

1) Try sshing to the machine and launching a program like glxgears or
xeyes.  Probably won't work, right?  Now try:

ssh remote-machine
export DISPLAY=:0
xeyes

Now does it work?  If so, try adding -x DISPLAY to your mpirun command, you
can read about this in the mpirun man page.

2)  Each pvserver process is looking in the filesystem for the data.
Usually people use a parallel filesystem like lustre (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(file_system) so that all the machines
in the cluster have access to the same files, but you can also duplicate the
file on each machine.  It must have the same path name on each machine.

Subject: [Paraview] display curved surfaces on 20-noded hex element
Message-ID: <2339db0c0907241034s768e4190rffa6545930b63de8@mail.gmail.com>

I have a number of quadratic 20-noded hex elements (type 25 in ParaView).  I
want the surfaces to be displayed as curved instead of being arbitrarily
faceted.  Is there a method to achieve this?  I've attached a picture of a
single element which is faceted and the corresponding vtu file.

Thanks,
Tim

Thanks Pat, I put the data in the same directory on both machines and
it got past the "error opening file" error. However, now when I try to
open the data I get these errors in the terminal:

Sorry,  I can't give you a guess what the problem might be.  Double check
that you used the same source to compile paraview and pvserver on the
various machines, and the same mpi library versions.  Is one machine 32 bit
and one 64 bit?  Does paraview work as expected if you create objects from
the Sources menu?

I don't think there is a direct way to do that currently.  However, I am working on a new feature that will allow you to select the number of subdivisions to approximate each face with from within the Display panel.  I expect to have this feature finished by ParaView 3.8.  If you are feeling adventurous, you can apply the attached patch to the latest source to try it out.

Ok I think that last stuff was my fault - I had lingering old versions
of OpenMPI in the cmake config. I started from fresh svn source and
empty bin directories on both machines: here is the new result:
The two machines are different architectures (32 and 64 bit) , but I
configured openmpi with --enable-heterogeneous and that fixed that
problem.


[doriad at daviddoria paraview_benchmarks]$ mpirun -machinefile
local_1+sgi_8.txt pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Client connected.


Then I try to add a sphere source, and get this in the terminal:

Process id: 0 >> Generic Warning: In

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun has exited due to process rank 0 with PID 15295 on
node daviddoria exiting without calling "finalize". This may
have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).


and this in the paraview output messages:

ERROR: In /home/doriad/src/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx,

We'll get this going eventually... haha

Subject: [Paraview] Suppress X display while saving images from Python script
Message-ID: <adb0f27a0907241234xde12f2el50f7a20c4e17ca2b@mail.gmail.com>

I don't know if I am double posting, if so I apologize. (I posted this
question this afternoon, but somehow it does not show up on the
mailinglist.

Hello,

I have Python script that generates PNG images from a Paraview
session. This in essence works very well. The one problem that I have
is that an OpenGL window is created whenever I save the image. When
you do this in a loop, it becomes a little annoying, since the window
(at least on my Fedora box) automatically gets focus.

Is there a way to generate the PNG images without popping up a window?
Is it hardware/driver/platform dependent? I am using Paraview 3.7
(CVS) and Fedora FC11, NVIDIA proprietary drivers.

For completeness and maybe for the interest of other people, I copied
the body of my PNG image generation procedure below. Notice the
explicit deletions at the end of the script. These are mandatory in my
case since I update for example the colour legend in each step of the
loop.

       # Instantiate a Paraview VTU reader
       reader = XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName=model.filename)

       lt = MakeBlueToRedLT(max_val, min_val)

       bar = CreateScalarBar(LookupTable=lt, Title=key)
       bar.LabelColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
       bar.TitleColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
       bar.LabelFontSize = 12
       bar.AspectRatio   = 15.0
       bar.AutomaticLabelFormat = 0

       Show()
       Render()

       view = GetActiveView()
       view.Background = [1,1,1]
       ResetCamera(view)

       dp = GetDisplayProperties()
       dp.ColorArrayName = 'W'

       rep = GetRepresentation()

Hi,
I put three widgets in a horizontal layout, but it seems that each
widget has the same size.
How to make the middle widget to have larger size than others?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] can't create a valid vti file to read into paraview
Message-ID: <4A6A0C91.80100@umassmed.edu>

Hi,
   I am trying to write a simple program to convert my image data into vti
format so I can view it using paraview.  I've been using 
http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf
as I guide.  But I keep getting an error message when I try to read in 
the file I create.

ERROR: In 
/builddir/build/BUILD/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/IO/vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx, 
line 326

vtkXMLImageDataReader (0x10844640): Error reading extent 0 511 0 511 0 
40 from piece 0

ERROR: In 
/builddir/build/BUILD/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 502

vtkXMLImageDataReader (0x10844640): Cannot read point data array 
"i2idata" from PointData in piece 0. The data array in the element may 
be too short.


When I actually count the bytes in the file they seem correct (i.e, 
512*512*41*2,   2 since I'm using Int16 and raw data).

I went to the archives and found 
http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-June/008319.html which 
discussed a
similar issue and has a link to a "valid" vti file (I don't have any 
other to test with)

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/attachments/20080611/e2bbb33b/attachment.obj

(don't know why the extension wasn't .vti).
I pulled that over and can read it fine (at least there are no error messages, I don't know what the image is supposed to look like).

Looking at that file it seems to me like there are too many bytes in the raw data, since it seems like it should be 8*4*4 = 128 * 4 bytes per point = 512.
In the archived article it makes it sound like maybe there are extra bytes of info needed (???) :


>/  To discover (for it was undocumented) that a 4 byte number of elements
/>/  should precede each record and should be a BIG ENDIAN integer regardless of
/>/  the endianness of rest of the binary data was quite a thrill (to say the
/>/  least!).

or maybe some type of byte alignment issue?

I too am on 64 bit Linux (fedora 11), but I'm compiling 32 bit.  I am using the "encoding="raw" attribute, but using Int16 data.

Thanks for any pointers to how to create these files!

                            Larry

Thanks David,
Appreciate the reply. I have looked at some more of the documentation, and
it seems I would need to write my own reader for the file types I have, but
it can be done.
Cheers,
Ben.

Message-ID: <20090725.132523.92514499.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

Trying to create a plugin that can be loaded into the precompiled
official ParaView 3.6.1 binaries from Kitware, I noticed that the
Linux 64bit package (paraview-3.6.1-Linux64-x86.tar.gz) was compiled
with the actual type of vtkIdType set to int. For example,

$ nm libvtkCommon.so.pv3.6 | c++filt | grep vtkDataArray::GetComponent
00000000000f5400 T vtkDataArray::GetComponent(int, int)

where the first int argument is of type vtkIdType at the source code
level. Indeed, my plugin won't load unless it was compiled and linked
with a ParaView build with VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS=OFF.

On the other hand, when I do the same for the official Linux 64bit
ParaView 3.4.0, I get the following.

$ nm libvtkCommon.so.pv3.4 | c++filt | grep vtkDataArray::GetComponent
00000000000f8d50 T vtkDataArray::GetComponent(long long, int)

Just out of curiosity, is this intended?

I don't know why the 3.4.0 release is compiled with 64 bit ids on. The 3.6.1
release requires it off to build the VisItReaderPlugin. There might also be
other reasons.

Message-ID: <73dc18630907250853l125896balf6f7dd4333b453e4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm not familiar with all of the plugins in paraview, but I am wondering
whether I need to write lower order elements in my vtk files for
flexibility.

All of my data is point based.

I am thinking that:

if 1d:
    Write Lines
if 2d:
    Write Triangles
if 3d:
    Write Tetrahedron

Would there be any reason to write lines and triangles in 3d to the output
file?

Thanks,

Juan

Hi all,

I am trying to load a large (14.5GB) vtk file using ParaView in a server-client mode using 32 processors (each having 2GB ram). For some reason the server crashes every time I am trying to load the file and it seems to me that all 32 processors are trying to load the entire file and that is why the server crashes.

Any ideas how to overcome that problem?

I have today downloaded current binaries for Windows 32-bit
(paraview-3.6.1-win32-x86.exe), and installed to my Windows XP machine.
Following install, when I try to start the app I have the same message as
Pierre JUILLARD:

"This application has not been able to start because the application
configuration is not correct. Reinstalling the application may solve the
problem."

What are the software requirements for Paraview? Do I need any other
libraries installed to start the app? This is my first install of Paraview
to any machine.

Hi Ben,

I tried to install ParaView on a Windows XP SP3 machine and it worked.
The problem I encountered during my first installation is a problem of
compatibility with Windows XP SP2 I think.

Thanks Pierre,

I don't have the ability to upgrade completely to SP3 at this time. I wonder
if there's any specific libraries SP3 upgrades that relate to Paraview and
its dependencies? Perhaps I could upgrade just those.

Developers, can you help me?

Ben.

We are tracking down the Windows XP SP2 issue. We should have updated
binaries for download soon.

If I am not mistaken, widget cannot be docked within widgets only
around the central widget in a QMainWindow, but Qt forum may be a
better place to figure out work arounds.

Look at http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qboxlayout.html#addWidget
The argument "strecth" maybe what you are looking for.

The Qt forum may be a better place to ask such generic Qt questions
that are not related to ParaView.

The VTK file format is not a parallel format. Therefore ParaView has
to load the whole thing on one processor and redistribute it
afterwards. You don't have enough memory to do that. You will have to
use a parallel file format such as the XML VTK file format - pvtX
where X depends on the data type.

This is intentional. 64 bit ids are mainly useful for processing
really large structured datasets in a non-distributed way. Otherwise,
they are unnecessary but cause all data structures used to represent
unstructured data to bloat. Ideally, I would like to see this change
such that ids can be on 32 bit or 64 bit on a dataset to dataset
basis.

Hi all,

I am work with Paraview (3.6.1) and with linux.
I have a little question. 
After I read a file, I do a contour and I have need to know min and max values to generate a new isosurface range.
I wonder if I can find the information like the data when I read a VTK (or VTU) file on Python.

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Source_Proxies

It shows how to use data information to obtain array ranges etc.

Hi Ben,
There is a Microsoft bug in the Windows Runtime manifest file that I include
in the ParaView release that makes it not work on XP SP2. I have fixed it
and am currently regenerating a binary that will work on SP2. The other
solution as mentioned by Pierre is to just upgrade to SP3.

Thanks for your patience.

I don't understand your question.  Can you clarify it?

Are you perhaps asking if you need to write out, for example, the triangle faces of each tetrahedron you write out?  (Answer: no.)  Are you asking if you can define a point, line, or triangle in 3D space?  (Answer: yes.)

Hello,

I'm not familiar with all of the plugins in paraview, but I am wondering whether I need to write lower order elements in my vtk files for flexibility.

All of my data is point based.

I am thinking that:

if 1d:
    Write Lines
if 2d:
    Write Triangles
if 3d:
    Write Tetrahedron

Would there be any reason to write lines and triangles in 3d to the output file?

Thanks,

Juan

You should always be able to create a valid vti file by simply loading or creating image data in ParaView (the Wavelet source works well for that), and then writing out a vti file.

If you want further help on what is wrong with your file, it would be helpful to post it.  You might also consider contacting the vtk users mailing list too, since the VTK file formats is more of general VTK question.

Hi,
  I am trying to write a simple program to convert my image data into vti
format so I can view it using paraview.  I've been using http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf
as I guide.  But I keep getting an error message when I try to read in the file I create.


ERROR: In /builddir/build/BUILD/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/IO/vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx, line 326

vtkXMLImageDataReader (0x10844640): Cannot read point data array "i2idata" from PointData in piece 0. The data array in the element may be too short.

When I actually count the bytes in the file they seem correct (i.e, 512*512*41*2,   2 since I'm using Int16 and raw data).

I went to the archives and found http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-June/008319.html which discussed a
similar issue and has a link to a "valid" vti file (I don't have any other to test with)
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/attachments/20080611/e2bbb33b/attachment.obj

(don't know why the extension wasn't .vti).
I pulled that over and can read it fine (at least there are no error messages, I don't know what the image is supposed to look like).

Looking at that file it seems to me like there are too many bytes in the raw data, since it seems like it should be 8*4*4 = 128 * 4 bytes per point = 512.
In the archived article it makes it sound like maybe there are extra bytes of info needed (???) :

> To discover (for it was undocumented) that a 4 byte number of elements

or maybe some type of byte alignment issue?

I too am on 64 bit Linux (fedora 11), but I'm compiling 32 bit.  I am using the "encoding="raw" attribute, but using Int16 data.

Thanks for any pointers to how to create these files!

Hello Ken,

I was asking the first question.  I implemented the vtk file format for an
unstructured grid using:
type 10 elements for 3D (tetrahedra)
type 5 elements for 2D (triangles)
type 3 elements for 1D (lines)

Each of these elements are defined in terms of points.

My data only exists on points (point data).

Is there any reason why I would want to put the lower dimensional elements
in my vtk file in addition to the highest dimensional elements?

Correct.  For example, if your data comprises exactly one tetrahedron, then your output should contain four points and the topology for the one tetrahedron.  The topology of the four triangular faces is implicit in the topology of the tetrahedron.  Including them explicitly would be counterproductive.

Hi Daniele:

    By checking the data files you provided, I found that the binary
geometry file does not comply with the EnSight Gold format. Please refer to
pp. 488 of the EnSight Manual (downloadable from
http://vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/ensight/docs82/UserManual.pdf) to find the
correct format. Specifically, each of the several description lines at the
beginning of a binary geometry file must contain 80 chars, whereas each line
in your file contains about 88. This inconsistency causes
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader::InitializeFile()
to exit with an error.

    You may go to http://aero.ist.utl.pt/~rreis/ens_checker.32 and
http://aero.ist.utl.pt/~rreis/ens_checker.64 to check the format of your
data files.

    If your data files, with correct format, still incur any problems,
please feel free to let me know.

    Thanks.

When I try to save a screenshot at a resolution higher than the current

is from trying to save a screenshot at 3x the resolution of the onscreen

That's a known issue. It also happens when saving out wireframes. The
problem is that we use glPolygonMode to render a surface as wireframe.
That produces closed polygons at window borders. When saving a large
screenshot, we use tiling to render an image larger than the window
size that introduces artifical window borders and hence those
extraneous lines.

Any OpenGL experts have any idea how to overcome this issue?

At one point, I think it proposed to make the render window bigger than that used for the tiling, and then clip out the part you actually use from the middle of the window, thereby clipping off the boarder pixels where the problem occurs.

Thanks for the quick responses!

It is a bit disconcerting that the rendering behavior when using "Save
Screenshot" and the behavior when viewing the main window are different.
The issue of clipping the polygon doesn't happen in the main window.  Also,
antialiasing (at least on my Linux system) is applied in the main window but
not applied when using "Save Screenshot."  It seems like one solution would
be to temporarily resize the main window, render it there and save, then
revert back to the old resolution.  Of course I don't know if there are
limitations to doing this.

Regards,
Tim

Subject: [Paraview] problems configuring ParaView 3.6
Message-ID: <BAY122-W50808269DD67C797F03F68BC150@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?ve checked out ParaView 3.6 twice, once at home on my laptop and once at work at the system there: 

At home, using CMake 2.4-patch 7 and Qt 4.3.4, I can configure ParaView running "ccmake <path-to-source-directory>", but building via 
"make" gets me the error

At work, I cannot even configure fully, because configuring gives me the error:

CMake Error at Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt:536 (FILE):

Here is CMake 2.6-patch4 and Qt 4.5.1 installed.

Thx for help,

Subject: [Paraview] Ellipsoid glyphs
Message-ID: <4A6EF0AE.4050601@tp1.rub.de>

Hello,

I looking for a method to visualize a set of ellipsoids,
defined by three vectors at each point.
As far as I can see, the vtkTensorGlyph would be suited
best, but unfortunately it is not available in ParaView.
Has someone imported this filter into ParaView (the wiki
article seems quite out of date) or could point me to
an alternative approach?

Best regards,
    Thorsten

By default, ParaView tries to use off-screen rendering using FBO's and
such for saving screenshots to avoid issues with overlapped windows
among other things. Depending on your OpenGL drivers, offscreen
rendering may produce slightly different results. In that case,
there's a check box in Edit|Settings (Render View) dialog, called "Use
Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots". Uncheck that, and ParaView will
no use offscreen rendering for screenshots. Does that help with issues
you are seeing with anti-aliasing?

Simply resizing the window often doesn't work if the requested
resolution is larger than the screen size. Hence we have to go with
tiling when rendering large screenshots.

There is an older thread about the integration of this

Such issues would be an ideal candidate for the new feedback mechanism on:

http://paraview.uservoice.com/

Put a small description and maybe even a reference to the feature
request entry on the bug tracker. If a request has lots of votes, then
we know and that it's a feature that many really want and we will try
to get it into ParaView. This will help us prioritize feature requests
that come from the community.

On a WinXP SP3 machine, with Intel Q35 Express (Driver-version:
6.14.10.4847) graphic, there is no difference between Offscreen and
'Onscreen' renderring.

In both cases are extraneous lines in the screen shot.

The extraneous lines would be. I was not referring to the lines issue
but to the "miscellaneous differences" such as aliasing/ligthing etc.
between the screenshots and on-screen rendering. The extraneous lines
is a tiling-issue which won't be affected if you do onscreen or
offscreen.

Subject: [Paraview] problems configuring ParaView 3.6
Message-ID: <BAY122-W518F49FBAFCE19739429D5BC150@phx.gbl>


Well, the building on my machine does work now, making a clean build. 

Still, the configuring problem remains, I found a post about this issue:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-October/009803.html

and it was said that the problem was fixed in CMake. 

Is there a chance that it has to do with file permissions?

Hi Natalie,

Is it possible something is weird about your Qt installation? Can you
send me your CMakeCache.txt from the build tree?

There is a request concerning ellipsoid glyphs/source on the feedback site,
so I voted for that.
As a quick fix, how do I enable vtk filters in ParaView?
I know that it was possible a while ago, but the wiki entry is out of 
date (seems
to refer to 2.X)

Subject: [Paraview] Step-by-step guide of building a parallel Paraview
	server?
Message-ID: <4A703513.5040504@iac.es>

Hi all,

as part of a student project that I was mentoring, I built a small 
Paraview server (4 nodes, 16 CPUs). I have no experience with Paraview, 
so I'm not sure if this is already available somewhere else, but a 
cursory look at the wiki and the mailing list seems to show that most 
information on getting a Paraview server up and running assumes that the 
basic cluster (with MPI, etc.) is already there. I've got detailed notes 
of our installation from scratch. Would this be useful to anyone? If so, 
please let me know, so I can turn the notes (probably in September) into 
a more readable format and publish them somewhere.

Cheers,
?ngel de Vicente

I do! And I know who to blame as well -- me :). I'll look at it. I
knew about this but then totally forgot about it before I committed
the changes.

Utkarsh,

How is it decided which VTK features to enable in paraview? If it is as easy
as adding a few lines to a CMakeLists.txt file, could there be a
"Enable/Disable Filters" menu item in Paraview that a user could use to
graphically select which features are available? Of course they would have
to recompile after doing that. I guess the question is more why aren't all
VTK features exposed in Paraview?

Thanks,

David

John,

This should be fixed now. The problem was that the plugin manager
loads the server manager xml every time a plugin is loaded be it on
server or client. Until now, that didn't do much harm since the old
xml would simply get replaced by the new one.  However I added a new
<Extension/> tag which allows the user to extend an existing element
and that meant that repeated loading of an xml is no longer
idempotent. This commit should fix the issue. The plugin manager now
no longer loads XMLs if it has already been loaded for the plugin.

That sounds awesome! The answer is yes :-) We can put it on the
ParaView Wiki if you are willing.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem compiling ParaView CVS since 2009/07/22 20:37:00
 CEST on SLES 10.2
Message-ID: <4A70784E.5000806@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone else is having problems compiling ParaView from
CVS on SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 2 since the commit
with ID t8b2Z3fhip0uNJWt that occurred at 2009/07/22 20:36:16 CEST

On my SLES 10 SP2 system cmake 2.6-patch 4, GNU make 3.80, Qt 4.5.2, GNU
binutils 2.19.1, GNU bison 2.3 and gcc 4.3.3 are installed. make gets up
to 50% and then bails out whenever trying to invoke bin/vtkWrapClientServer:

[ 50%] Generating vtkArrayCoordinateIteratorClientServer.cxx
/bin/sh: line 1: 29983 Segmentation fault
../../../bin/vtkWrapClientServer
/home/foo/ParaView3_CVS/VTK/Common/vtkArrayCoordinateIterator.h
/home/foo/ParaView3_CVS/VTK/Wrapping/hints 1
/home/foo/paracompile_linux64/Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkArrayCoordinateIteratorClientServer.cxx
make[2]: ***
[Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkArrayCoordinateIteratorClientServer.cxx]
Error 139
make[1]: ***
[Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/CMakeFiles/vtkCommonCS.dir/all]
Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

Re-invocation of make pushes progress one step further, because on
segfault an empty file is created for

Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkArrayCoordinateIteratorClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkAbstractArrayClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkAbstractTransformClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkAmoebaMinimizerClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkAnimationCueClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkAnimationSceneClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkArrayIteratorClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkAssemblyNodeClientServer.cxx
Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkAssemblyPathClientServer.cxx
etc.

It happens for both Release and Debug builds.
Running the critical command through gdb (using ddt as frontend):

% cd Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common
% ddt ../../../bin/vtkWrapClientServer
/home/foo/ParaView3_CVS/VTK/Common/vtkArrayCoordinateIterator.h
/home/foo/ParaView3_CVS/VTK/Wrapping/hints 1
/home/foo/paracompile_linux64/Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/vtkArrayCoordinateIteratorClientServer.cxx

the debugger reports a problem in getClassInfo
(vtkWrapClientServer.c:1225), reason: address not mapped to object

It happens both for a SuSE provided gcc-4.3.3 as well as a self-compiled
gcc 4.3.3

Compilation using the same source tree and cmake 2.6-patch 4, GNU make
3.80/3.81, Qt 4.5.2, GNU binutils 2.19.1, GNU bison 2.3 and gcc 4.3.3
works fine on openSuSE 11.1 32bit, openSuSE 10.3 64bit and Ubuntu 9.04
64bit.

Has anyone a hint what prerequisite to upgrade or what else to try?

Best regards,
Sven

Try updating. A bug was introduced in getClassInfo() that resulted in
stack overflows which has been fixed since.

Subject: [Paraview] builtin doesn't call MPI_Init?
Message-ID: <6dac95df0907291030j768ec0adt24bdc3b34524384c@mail.gmail.com>

I think ParaView do not call MPI_init for builtin connection when it compile
with MPI. Is that correct? Hard time to locate the right code. When ParaView
do not call MPI_Init this cause me some problem. My reader uses mpi io, and
do not work without mpi.

My 2 case is this:

When ParaView not compile with MPI, reader not compile, so no one try to use
it. No problem!
When ParaView compile with MPI, reader works on all connection except built
in. Problem!

reader should work on all connection type + builtin. How can this be realise
in the ParaView way?

It is correct that MPI_Init is not called for builtin.  This is because the paraview client application itself is not a parallel application.  It has no MPI facilities, so MPI cannot be used within it.  If you want to use MPI, you have to connect to a pvserver.

Hi Utkarsh,

I'm well aware of the fixes for Win introduced since, but they do not
resolve everything: I updated to top of cvs and compiled from scratch
just now. The segfault during compilation remains. But only for SuSE
Linux Enterprise Server 10 as far as I can tell.

your own software projects in a heterogeneous computing environment.

ITK: Thursday PM through Friday PM
This session covers the basic architecture of ITK, the use of its image 
segmentation and image registration algorithms, the methods used for 
interfacing ITK to VTK, and the common techniques for integrating ITK 
into existing applications.

ParaView: Thursday PM through Friday PM
The first part of this session offers an introduction to ParaView from a 
user's perspective, providing you with the knowledge necessary to 
effectively process and visualize your data. The second part of the 
course is geared toward developers who would like to create custom 
functionality and incorporate it into ParaView.

As a course attendee, you will receive:
- Books / course notes for the sessions you attend
- Snacks and lunch daily
- A dinner reception on both Tuesday and Thursday evening

The Registration Fees for the Developer's Training Week are:

On or before September 1st:
- $2500 for the four days or
- $750 per day

After September 1st:
- $3000 for the four days or
- $900 per day

No prior experience is necessary; however, attendees will need to have 
basic knowledge of C++ or a similar language in order to fully 
participate in the interactive exercises.

Kitware courses incorporate both technical presentations and practical 
exercises designed to reinforce learning. Each attendee should bring 
their own laptop computer to the courses. Approximately two weeks before 
the course, attendees will receive detailed instructions on how to 
download, install and test all necessary software on their laptop 
computer. Any remaining issues will be resolved on-site during the 
Software Overview session on Tuesday morning.

The course registration form can be found at 
http://www.kitware.com/products/protraining.html. Additional information 
is available by emailing courses at kitware.com or by calling 518-371-3971.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.4 MFIX and Fluent Readers

Hello,

I just realized that in order to be able to read Fluent files and MFIX *.RES files I need some kind of readers, where could I download those in order to visualize images from these two codes.

Thanks

Hi all,

Thanks for this fix. I downloaded the last version and notice a slight
change in binary size.
It works now great!

Message-ID: <C8D3F57E07352C4B9C8E779E2B27B9EA0EA16C@LAXA.intra.cea.fr>


Hi all,

I am work with Paraview (3.6.1) and with linux.
I can see something trouble when I launch my Python script on the cluster.
I have never seen the same time for the same work.
Sometime I have about 4 seconds or sometime I have about 18 seconds. I link a file with copy screen I can see.
I don't understand why a same work with python paraview I haven't a same work.
I can see sometime it do 6 vtkPainterPolyDataMapper instead of 2. 
Another time, it do 8 vtkPVGeometryryFilter instead of 6.
???
Somebody will have a idea on what is the probleme ?

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards, 
Jona

Thank you very much, this sounds like what I need.
The code compiles and runs fine (which means, it doesnt
crash ParaView upon loading). The remaining question
is, what would the correct input data be?

Best regards,

Message-ID: <9E3DCA3EE48FAE4E95DBA686A7A35EA81EBB759226@DKRDSEXC014.vestas.net>

Dear all

When trying to load VisItReaderPlugin.dll as a local plugin I get the following error message:

"The file 'C:/Program Files/ParaView 3.6.1/bin/plugins/VisItReaderPlugin.dll' is not a valid Qt plugin."

I am using the latest Win32 binaries (btw: thanks for updating the build for SP2 users)

Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

Hi Thorsten,

You need to have tensor data, e.g. curvature tensors or whatever...
for your grid or image, you would call:

grid->GetPointData()->SetTensors(data)

where data is a vtkDataArray, e.g. of type double, with 9 components ( 
the three rows of the 3x3 tensor). I don't know what happens if there 
are fewer components.


There is an example data set in the VTK Data called "tensors.vtk".

http://www.vtk.org/files/release/5.4/vtkdata-5.4.2.tar.gz



Or my own simple data here:

http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~blloyd/vtkTensorGlyphFilter/tensors.vtk


Cheers
Bryn

Unfortunately, the VisIt plugin requires SP3. This is because we are
using binaries for 3rd party libraries built by the VisIt team and
they don't work with SP2. In the next version, we will try to build
all of these libraries ourselves to fix this issue. Sorry for the
inconvenience.

Ok, back to basics - this is the simplest setup I can imagine.

I am trying to run pvserver on a single extra computer (so a total of mine +
1 = 2 machines) with the same architecture, same OS, same OpenMPI, same
Paraview. I have been talking with the OpenMPI people and running "hello
world" tests that are showing that everything is setup correctly and talking
to each other with no problems. Both firewalls are off. Password-less ssh
works both ways. pvserver is on both machine's PATH. I have compiled
Paraview with PARAVIEW_USE_MPI set to ON in both cases. I have explicitly
added the path to the openmpi libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH on both machines
- that is, put the following in .bashrc on both machines:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

I am starting the server with a paraview command like this:

 mpirun -machinefile
/home/doriad/Desktop/paraview_benchmarks/local_1+cloud_1.txt pvserver

where local_1+cloud_1.txt is:
10.1.2.126
10.1.2.122

my machine is 126. I tell Paraview to connect to 10.1.2.126 on 11111.

When I try to connect, I get the following in the paraview Output Messages.
Any thoughts on what I have missed?

Listen on port: 11111

Hi Jona,

If I were to make a guess, I would say that the file caching done by
the OS is why your script runs sometimes faster. I see a huge
difference in performance when loading a large file the second time in
ParaView. It is hard to say more without having the data and the
script.

Subject: [Paraview] Baffled by "floating point exceptions" in ParaView 3.6.1
Message-ID: <b02264720907300643r119982d3o863edfb09edaf3eb@mail.gmail.com>

I've compiled ParaView 3.6.1 three times so far, and every time it compiles
successfully but when I attempt to run it, it dies with "Floating point
exception".

I'm compiling it on a Linux system (RHEL4), and linking against MPI (OpenMPE
1.2.8) and python (2.5.1).  I'm using cmake 2.6.4 .  Is there some known
problem here?

I compiled Paraview in "Debug" mode, but a backtrace doesn't show anything
but question marks.

3.6 should read Fluent and MFIX out-of-box.

Can you try compiling without Python and MPI? Also, can you try with
Mesa? I am guessing some system library is causing this problem but
without a stack trace, it will be trial-and-error to find out which.
Also, do older versions work with the same libraries?

I was unable to compile 3.4 against these libraries, compilation would fail
with errors in the Python libraries about "-fPIC".

I'll try again without MPI & Python, and get back with you.

If you are running it in gdb, you might be able to do:

(gdb) handle SIGFPE nopass
Signal        Stop      Print   Pass to program Description
SIGFPE        Yes       Yes     No              Arithmetic exception

or

(gdb) handle SIGFPE nostop nopass
Signal        Stop      Print   Pass to program Description
SIGFPE        No        Yes     No              Arithmetic exception

Randall - we saw some execution-time failures of 3.6.1 that was related 
to an older version of the nVidia driver.     We didn't see floating 
point exceptions, though - we saw socket errors related to the 
client-server connection.  Moving to a newer version of the nVidia 
driver on the client side fixed the problem.     It doesn't make sense, 
but that's what happened!   8-)

Subject: [Paraview] Volume representation not working
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0907300856j49ffd44h859ec25b31dd5480@mail.gmail.com>

I have a vtk file (http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/test.vtk) that consists of a
20x20x20 image. The 0,0,0 cell has a value of 10, the 7,9,7 cell has a value
of 1, and the rest of the cells are 0. In Representation = slice, I see
exactly what I'd expect.

If I change the representation to 'outline', I see the outline of the the
20x20x20 cube.

However, if I change the representation to 'volume', I see nothing. Does
anyone know why this would be? I was expecting a transparent blue cube that
I could see these voxels inside of.

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Adding a synthetic LiDAR scanner to VTK/Paraview
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0907300921k2f55ffafnb3ce6681261c477a@mail.gmail.com>

I have written a synthetic LiDAR scanner in c++ using VTK and VXL. That is,
rather than setting up a collection of objects in real life and actually
sending lasers into the scene, one can simply create a scene out of 3d
models and "scan" it by casting rays at the models. This seems like
something that could be a huge help to any researchers that work with 3D
model/surface/point data and LiDAR data. I'm sure many researchers have
their own implementations - after all it is a very straightforward process
(simply a bunch of ray triangle intersections - which I have sped up using
VTK's octree) but I think it would be very useful to someone starting out in
the field and to attempt to unify some datasets. I've used it to produce
data sets for which a ground truth is known in order to ensure algorithms
are behaving properly before moving to "real" LiDAR scans. Also, noise can
be added to the points to attempt to simulate a real LiDAR scan for
researchers who do not have access to the very expensive equipment required
to obtain real scans.

The inputs are:

Scanner position (3D coordinate)
Min/Max phi angle (how far "up and down" the scanner should scan)
Min/Max theta angle (how far "left and right" the scanner should scan)
Scanner "forward" (the phi=0, theta=0 direction)
Angular sample spacing or number of points to acquire in the theta and phi
directions (so the "grid" is a total of (num_theta x num_phi) points)

The outputs are:
A .ptx file that maintains implicitly the structure of the scan (points are
ordered as they were taken in "strips"). This is the output given by a real
Leica scanner.
A .vtp file that is simply an unorganized point cloud of the scan returns.

It seems like this could be a neat little thing to add to paraview - just a
couple of text boxes and sliders to set the parameters, load the scene you
want to scan using existing paraview I/O, visualize the scan frustrum using
paraview line sources, and then click "Scan!" to create your ptx and/or vtp.

Can I get some feedback on if this is an acceptable extension to
vtk/paraview capabilities?

Thanks,

David

Hm, it seems that if you rescale the data range to [-1,10] instead of [0,10]
you can then see the "empty" space in the cube. Shouldn't that be the
default? i.e. why can you not see anything when it is exactly equal to the
lower bound of the color scale? Shouldn't it snap anything below that to the
lowest color?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0907301128r4fe26412n82ce6fbbff16a626@mail.gmail.com>

In an image in a vtk file, one can set the spacing in each dimension. When
you visualize slices of the image in paraview, it shows an infinitely thin
slice through the cell/voxel centers. Is it possible to visualize the actual
voxels as a grid of 3d rectangular prisms (like a wall of bricks), each with
dimension the same as the image spacing?

You could try the Extract Cells By Region filter, set it to plane,
then check "extract only intersected" and "extract intersected."

Pat,

Yes, that is exactly what I'm looking for. The only difference is that that
cutting plane moves in infinitesimally small steps that eventually line up
with the next step of the actual image cell grid, where the "slice"
representation moves in discrete steps, one column of the image grid at a
time. Would it be hard to combine these two functions to produce this
functionality?

Thanks,

David

Why this sounds like a great opportunity for the new python macro
feature :-)  You could two scripts, StepForward.py and
StepBackward.py, and add them to the macros toolbar.  Now you'll have
two buttons for stepping forward and backward.  I don't have time
right now to figure out the complete script but it would be something
like...

e = GetActiveSource()
# maybe make sure e.GetVTKClassName() == "vtkExtractGeometry"
e.IntersectWith = "Plane"
planeOrigin = e.IntersectWith.Origin
imageInput = e.Input[0]
e.IntersectWith.Origin = computeNewOrigin(planeOrigin, imageInput)

Then all you need to do is write the computeNewOrigin method that
takes the image, gets the origin, extens, and spacing, and then
computes a new plane origin to step the plane one discreet step
forward or backward.

These macros are very cool! That code was right on, it works perfectly if I
set the new origin to a constant.
e.IntersectWith.Origin = [x,y,z]

Now for writing computeNewOrigin(), I looked at dir(imageInput) but I didn't
see properties like "spacing" or "cellSize" - where should I look to find
out how to get those properties from an image in python?

Thanks,

David

Problems we have found before:
1) There is already a version of the ParaView client running.  ps -ef
2)There aren't enough server nodes to run your job.  You didn't ask for too many nodes, did you?  Did you ask for the correct node?
3) The client machine cannot be seen from the server.  From the server node, ping the client machine. Ping it's IP address.  Ping it by name.
4) The client machine cannot be seen from the server.  Start ParaView client in reverse connection mode, then try to telnet to this port.  (Normally "telnet machine port").  It should just sit there.  If you get a connection refused, client is not listening or port is blocked.
5) Once again, check that the ports aren't blocked.  Try "netstat -a | egrep 11111"


There are just a few ideas...

Alan

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Multiple servers

Ok, back to basics - this is the simplest setup I can imagine.

I am trying to run pvserver on a single extra computer (so a total of mine + 1 = 2 machines) with the same architecture, same OS, same OpenMPI, same Paraview. I have been talking with the OpenMPI people and running "hello world" tests that are showing that everything is setup correctly and talking to each other with no problems. Both firewalls are off. Password-less ssh works both ways. pvserver is on both machine's PATH. I have compiled Paraview with PARAVIEW_USE_MPI set to ON in both cases. I have explicitly added the path to the openmpi libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH on both machines - that is, put the following in .bashrc on both machines:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

I am starting the server with a paraview command like this:


mpirun -machinefile /home/doriad/Desktop/paraview_benchmarks/local_1+cloud_1.txt pvserver

where local_1+cloud_1.txt is:
10.1.2.126
10.1.2.122

my machine is 126. I tell Paraview to connect to 10.1.2.126 on 11111.

When I try to connect, I get the following in the paraview Output Messages. Any thoughts on what I have missed?

Listen on port: 11111

You can do this:

w = Wavelet()
image = servermanager.Fetch(w)

image.GetExtent()
image.GetOrigin()
image.GetSpacing()

Calling servermanager.Fetch is going to pull the image data from the
paraview server to the paraview client, so if the data is big, it
could take some time and use up a lot of memory.

Or, without using servermanager.Fetch, just:

w = Wavelet()
w.GetDataInformation().GetBounds()
w.GetDataInformation().GetExtents()

I disagree.  The current behavior looks fine to me.


 1.  Changing the range to make the bottom part visible is a bad idea.  A better way to get the same effect is to raise the opacity of the leftmost control point a bit.
 2.  ParaView makes no effort to build a transfer function.  The default is going to be insufficient most of the time.  You are expected to have to edit the transfer function for your particular data.  Nevertheless, as a static default setting, it works better than any other I have seen.
 3.  Rendering the empty space as empty makes sense to me.  Much of the time the space is really empty.  Even if it is not, the region clearly has no information as it has the constant minimal value.  Might as well get it out of the way to see the interesting stuff.
 4.  If you don't like that, you can set whatever transfer function you want to be the default.  Raise up the left control point and hit "Make Default".

Hm, it seems that if you rescale the data range to [-1,10] instead of [0,10] you can then see the "empty" space in the cube. Shouldn't that be the default? i.e. why can you not see anything when it is exactly equal to the lower bound of the color scale? Shouldn't it snap anything below that to the lowest color?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <abd92de30907310832i36e85a8eu6211698a5cd26c20@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying tp use a python script to open MultiWindow paraview
session and make a movie. As an example, I used the
LoadStateMultiView.pvsm file included with ParaviewData. When I open
this *.pvsm using the GUI (File->LoadState ), I can get a four equal
sized 2x2 set of windows as shown below.
    ___________
   |         |         |
   |_____|_____|
   |         |        |
   |_____|_____|


   However, when I use the following python script, those windows no
longer have the 2x2 equal size arrangement. Those are arranged in the
following format

    ____________
   |         |           |
   |         |______|
   |         |     |     |
   |_____|___|___|

The python script I am using is

############################

import exceptions
from paraview import servermanager
filename = "/home/Softwares/Paravew/ParaviewData/ParaViewData/Data/LoadStateMultiView.pvsm"
try:
  fp = open(filename, "r")
  fp.close()
except:
  raise exceptions.RuntimeError, \
    "Session file not found"

if not servermanager.ActiveConnection:
  servermanager.Connect()
servermanager.LoadState(filename)
Render()
pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
scene1 = pxm.GetProxy('animation', 'AnimationScene1')
scene1.NumberOfFrames = 10
writer = servermanager.vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter()
writer.SetFileName('/home/lalith/Desktop/test2.jpg')
writer.SetFrameRate(1)
writer.SetAnimationScene(scene1.SMProxy)
writer.Save()

#############################

  Also, the tiled images saved by this script has  borders along each
small window.
Could anybody help me to  get the proper window arrangement with a
python script.

Thanks in advance

Lalith

Lalith,

That's a known issue. We are working towards addressing it in the next
major release.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Mac OS X and Cocoa ... again
Message-ID: <7CFE7FAA-4A28-4F0F-8EC1-2EC0A3C56DB5@videotron.ca>

Good afternoon,

I'm tryig to get a fully functional paraview installation based on qt  
cocoa 64. Here are the steps that I have followed :

0) Compile a fresh version of cmake-2.6.4
1) Compile QT with Cocoa option and arch x86_64 / this worked without  
problem
2) Configure paraview using BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON,  
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=x86_64, VTK_USE_CARBON:BOOL=OFF and
VTK_USE_COCOA:BOOL=ON

When re-running cmake to take into account my new settings,  
VTK_USE_CARBON switches back to ON and VTK_USE_COCOA to OFF.
However, my qt cocoa flavor is found by cmake ;

-- Looking for QT_MAC_USE_COCOA
-- Looking for QT_MAC_USE_COCOA - found
-- Found Qt-Version 4.5.2

What is the problem here / it seems that ParaView does want to use  
cocoa ???

Thanks !

Here is patch (kinda crappy I know.. ) but if you can pick through it  
you can see what you will need to change. I think there may be some  
other problems but get this put in place and try the build again.

  I _do_ have a functioning PV 3.6 64 Bit Cocoa build running on OS X  
intel (Mac Pro) so I know it works.

Good Luck.

Mike,

I would like to have the cvs ParaView working with Cocoa (hopefully
while still preserving Carbon build functionality). Do you have
patches to do this? If not, can we work together to get this working?

Thanks,
-berk

I have a patch, but it is kinda old at this point. I think it was  
against the PV 3.6 branch. I can include it here so that you can see  
what I did to get things to work or maybe I'll just generate a new  
patch against the PV 3.6 branch and you can look through it?

   Last time I tried I actually loaded a 5GB dataset into paraview on  
OS X.

The first hurdle is to get rid of the "forced" carbon build for OS X.  
Get the committed and then start working the rest. Clinton had a patch  
for one of the progress workers or something like that. I also needed  
the FindBoost.cmake from the latest CMake 2.6.4 (but that was probably  
for my own use.. )

   I'll help however I can..

Subject: [Paraview] qvtk problems with the pipeline
Message-ID: <4A736B89.4090201@itis.ethz.ch>

My pipeline works all right and gets updated on demand properly. I 
achieve it by connecting spinboxes/lineedits etc. to functions that set 
parameters of my filters before I explicitly hit the final 'apply' 
button. The annoying problem is that the pipeline gets executed also 
when I interact with the render window (click to rotate etc.). I did not 
(intend to) set up such functionality, I want the pipeline to execute 
only after an explicit button click (like in paraview). How do I find 
out who is triggering the pipeline behind my back?

ParaView queues up the changes, and only applies them to the filters 
when the apply button is pressed.
If you're applying them on the filters when spinboxes/lineedits change, 
and a menu comes and goes over the graphics view, that could trigger an 
update you might not want.

How about your apply button gathering the parameters from the widgets on 
the form and applying them?

Hi Alan,

The problem I noticed occurs when setting the solid colour.  I checked out
the latest CVS this morning and it is still happening (and with the cylinder
source).  I have attached a screenshot showing the two places to set the
colour - the colour is saved in a statefile if set from the object
inspector, but not if set from the toolbar.

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] screenshot light problem pv3.4 & pv3.6
Message-ID: <4A66C956.20504@sirehna.com>

while doing some test with the new release of pv 3.6, I found a strange 
behaviour of the screenshot feature :

When i do a screenshot for cell data, screenshot image is not good 
because it's too dark.
If i do screenshot for point data, light is ok and image is good

it appears that it is not specific to 3.6 version (same pb in 3.4)

in attachment : results of my tests (left side is cell data and right 
side is point data)

Hi Kalle,

Here is what you should have : 


This kind of representation is usable for any kind of input (not only 
point sets, it extract all the points from any input and apply point 
sprites to it).

So i did...
The PointSprite_GUIPlugins were manually loaded immediately after 
paraview started.

enabled.

Yes of course.

Are we talking about the ObjectInspector->Display Panel?

ObjectInspector(panel)->Display(panel)->Style->Representation ?

I played around with other types of point-sources, but i couldn't see 
any change in the GUI.

Kalle.

Hi Utkarsh

Thanks for the info, I can now see how it works from your sample file. I did have to re-order the entries in my test CSV file in order to get it plotting as a cube and not as a distorted one (with the original format). It does appear that the Table to Structured Grid expects the CSV data to be in a particular order, but it does not seem to be able to handle data values entered in effect randomly, even though the positional information (XYZ) is explicit.

I did apply a quick test on some real data, a few sampled layers as the whole data are quite chunky! Even though I enter the extents of the data properly, it fails with the the same error message. I have attached a zipped data file for you to see, it is only 3 data layers (z=0, -100, -200), with the units in metres (XYZ).

X: 291000 - 321000
Y: 2026000 - 2056000
Z: -200 - 0 (negative to get depth in the right direction!)

I already have the whole dataset as a VTK file (thanks to Berk's help), but this is a useful test of real-world data. The whole dataset forms a volume 30km x 30km x 10km (XYZ) so pretty big!

If you can work out why it is not working on the Table to structure grid, that would be a great help. Table to points is perfectly fine with the extents exactly as expected. As longs as the data are on a regular grid, then Paraview should be able to convert this to a structured grid irrespective of the order of the data points. Perhaps it would be useful to have some clarification on the way Paraview processes the data and whether or not we are expected to preformat the input CSV file.

Thanks

Lester
