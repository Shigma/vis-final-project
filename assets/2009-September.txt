Subject: [Paraview] [Bug] Display of multiple selection labels
Message-ID: <1c02becc0908312159u97cc757r13124adbdf4b1ae7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

   I found a bug of display of multiple selection labels (either for cell or
point). If you select multiple selection with holding down "Ctrl" key.
But Paraview always shows the latest selection not all of selections as I am
selecting. Is this a bug?

  I have to use "Invert selection" in "Selection Inspector" and "Invert
selection" again to get all selection labels shown.

Thanks,
Mengda

Thanks a lot! You pinpointed the source of my troubles.
VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS needs to be explicitly set to OFF, indeed, in order to
be able to compile 64bit versions of plugins that work with official
64bit releases of ParaView 3.6.1. The setting resolved the segfault on
Linux 64bit and the "not a valid qt plugin" plugin load error on Mac.

We are going to try to provide binaries for development with 3.6.2.

Hi,

Is it possible to use the calculator to get field data that is associated
with the whole dataset?  I have a multiblock dataset where each block has a
rotational speed associated with it.  I would like to highlight by that
value.

Thanks,

Hi Alan,

it seems that CMake is correctly picking up my compiled version of Python
and bypassing the system version.

The following lines were copied from CMakeCache.txt file:

//Path to a program.
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/sw/shared/x86_64/Python/2.6.2/bin/python2.6

//Path to a file.
PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/sw/shared/x86_64/Python/2.6.2/include/python2.6

//Path to a library.
PYTHON_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/sw/shared/x86_64/Python/2.6.2/lib/libpython2.6.a

but I still get the same error message :-(

any clue?

Moreover, how can I force the make process to be more verbose?

Renato.

Hi Renato,

You can type 'make VERBOSE=1'.

You need to build python shared so that the PYTHON_LIBRARY points to
libpython2.6.so.

Pat is right! I'm using static library instead of shared

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Reader: Invalid number of unstructured points
 read; check that ByteOrder is set correctly
Message-ID: <4A9D5F03.8060505@yahoo.de>

Hi all,

I get this error when reading in a (large) Ensight binary case that can
be read by Ensight. ens_checker also reports no errors.

The problem is reported from line 2502 from
vkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx (revision 1.83). It seems that Ensight
Cases can be ok even if this check fails....

I wanted to try running it without this check but failed to build a
custom Ensight reader as a plugin for various reasons. What can be done
to find the problem. Thanks.

Regards BastiL

Are you writting your files from Fortran codes using unformatted "binaries"?

Hi BastiL:

   As you know, Line #2502 (see below) is used to check whether or not the
(total) number of points is valid in relation to the file size. I feel that
this is a reasonable as well as necessary check. A valid EnSight file is
supposed to pass this check. Is your Ensight dataset divided into multiple
files such that the total number of points is greater than the size of any
of those files?

   Thanks.

}

Hi Zhanping,

I don't really understand what you mean by "divided into multiple
files"? It is an export from the FLUENT CFD code and it consists of an
case, geo and several scalar files. What can I do to support you further
finding the problem?

Hi:

It seems that you're writting parallel geometry in a serial way. Partitioned
grid, as far as I know, must be stored as spatial collections in xdmf
format. In other words, each processors stores its own grid portion (a pair
xdmf/hdf5 file) and rank0, for instance, writes a xdmf file describing how
to "glue" the grid pieces using a spatial collection clause.

[]'s

Subject: [Paraview] problems compiling paraview
Message-ID: <BAY122-W2246F6F79191A52706C976BCF00@phx.gbl>


Hi everybody,
I'm trying to compile ParaView 3.6 on a new system and in the build process I get the following error:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/local/lib/libGL.so', needed by `bin/QVTKCxxTests'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [VTK/GUISupport/Qt/Testing/Cxx/CMakeFiles/QVTKCxxTests.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I thought there may be something wrong with OpenGL, but configuring I get the following (sensible) pathes:
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR               /usr/X11R6/include
 OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY                /usr/local/lib/libGL.so
 OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY               /usr/local/lib/libGLU.so
 OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR         /usr/X11R6/include

Does anyone have a hint what's the problem here?

Thx, 
Natalie

Message-ID: <DDBA21B8-1121-4A43-BF1D-B8BBED9D6A73@indiana.edu>

Hello,

Just wanting to get a better understanding of the latest ParaView,  
while considering adopting it for a project.  I'm assuming ParaView  
does its UI using C++ calls to Qt, as opposed to using PyQt, is that  
correct?  (if any of the developers would care to comment on the  
design decisions behind that, I'd welcome that too).  And that to  
create a custom UI, one does so via XML?  Any changes on the horizon?

Are there examples uses of ParaView for real-time vis?  Any examples  
that do computational steering?  Not necessarily for parallel apps,  
just serial.

thanks, Randy

Hi,

I am currently working on an animation, and I would like to play with 
time.
In my animation, I would like one of the object to remain at a given time, 
while the others are evolving, to serve as reference.
I tried to use the temporal shift scale, but setting the scale to 0 
results in a segmentation fault, and I think I actually would need to set 
it to infinity, which is not possible...
I also tried to check the "ignore time" combo on the pipeline browser pop 
up, but I did not see any change.

Any hint?

Best

Hi,

I would like to switch off the visibility of a widget while creating an 
animation with python.

force instance, if I use the script below : 

sph = Sphere()
transform = Transform(sph)
Show(transform)
Render()

the box widget is visible, how to turn the visibility off from python?
My pb is that this widget is associated via the 'Hint' mechanism, and I do 
not see how to acces the created widget from the servermanager and/or 
proxy.

"Ignore Time" is used to not consider the readers times when setting
ranges for the animation and in 'snap-to-timesteps" mode. The reader
will still respect the time requested. A solution may be add a
temporal-shift-scale like filter that requestes a fixed timestep from
the input irrespective of the downstream request.

I don't think there is a way to do it currently, for the reason you
pointed out.  The widget visibility is not controlled by a property of
the representation as it probably should be.  I'm not sure if there is
a bug report/feature request filed for this already.

If the rendering is local, you can do an evil hack like this...

GetRenderView().GetRenderWindow().GetRenderers().GetFirstRenderer().GetViewProps().GetItemAsObject(6).SetVisibility(0)
Render()

Hi,

Thanks for your inputs.
I have developed a small filter (ForceTime) that implements Utkarsh 
suggestion, and filed a feature request with it (n? 9477).

Stephane 

Easy option 1: Save the object you want fix to a single separate file, 
then reload it (with no time info), then evolve the others as usual. 
The temporal Shift-Scale option ought to work too, but if the time request 
goes to a non-existent time, some readers/suppliers don't handle it well.

Harder option : try above first, unless there is some reason why you 
can't.

Yes C++, not PyQt.

change. See the paraview wiki page, specifically the plugins page for
examples of how to make changes and the kinds of changes it is easy to make
today.

It is also possible to write entirely new applications. See the OverView and
StreamingParaView applications in the source code for examples.

Yes, changes are on the horizon. Writing a new app is too complicated right
now because the design of the client is fairly monolithic and
interconnected. Search the mailing list for Utkarsh's posting about branded
applications. He has a git repository that is publicly available on git-hub
where he is working on that.

Several people have done this before, so far no one has done it in a robust
enough manner to be widely used. The upcoming tutorial at SuperComputing
(again the see wiki page) convers perhaps the best approach so far. It is
also worth investigating XDMF's DSM layer which is another good approach.
Finally, I personally did it in yet another way. My approach was to add an
asynchronous polling loop to the client, in the same way that the streaming
paraview app renders for pieces in a loop while the UI stays responsive..

Or you can change the active source to be the sphere from python and
the widget will disappear :).

Hallo Renato,

no these are Ensight-Files that have been written by the commerical
FLUENT CFD solver. I can read some of them but not all.

Hmmm. I am afraid not. I think you need to write a custom filter that
extracts geometry while assigning a cell variable copied from the
field variable. I would also add a feature request for coloring by a
field variable. It sounds like a useful feature.

Sort of. To customize the client one uses a mixture of C++ and XML and designer built widgets. The exact mix depends on what you are trying to change. See the paraview wiki page, specifically the plugins page for examples of how to make changes and the kinds of changes it is easy to make today.

It is also possible to write entirely new applications. See the OverView and StreamingParaView applications in the source code for examples.

Yes, changes are on the horizon. Writing a new app is too complicated right now because the design of the client is fairly monolithic and interconnected. Search the mailing list for Utkarsh's posting about branded applications. He has a git repository that is publicly available on git-hub where he is working on that.

Are there examples uses of ParaView for real-time vis?  Any examples that do computational steering?  Not necessarily for parallel apps, just serial.


Several people have done this before, so far no one has done it in a robust enough manner to be widely used. The upcoming tutorial at SuperComputing (again the see wiki page) convers perhaps the best approach so far. It is also worth investigating XDMF's DSM layer which is another good approach. Finally, I personally did it in yet another way. My approach was to add an asynchronous polling loop to the client, in the same way that the streaming paraview app renders for pieces in a loop while the UI stays responsive..

I've been working in a Python script to produce runtime post-processing in
my simulation code.

The idea is quite simple:

Step 0). Pre-simulation:

1. Launch paraview and create a pipeline with the desired visualization
(viewpoint, lights, slices, streamlines, whatever...). Note that it can be
easily done using small models;

2. Save the pipeline as a ParaView State file (it will be used as a template
for the runtime postprocessing script --> see the next step)

Step 1). Running the simulation code:

1. Launch the simulation and, while the application is runnig (or after
finishing), launch the ParaView Python Script passing some arguments, such
as, filename for the "template" paraview state file, email (yes, the script
can send you screenshots by email).

What does this script do?

a. Look for results already saved by the application producing a screenshot
for each time step found. Note that I still have to have the results saved
in some file format. In my tests I used Ensight.

b. After creating the screenshots for the results already produced by the
simulation tool, the script starts to "listen" for changes in the
application directory. As soon as it detects a new time step, it creates the
corresponding screenshot.

Remarks:

I. The script is able to send screenshots as email attach (it behaves like a
spam in some cases :-)

II. The script is lightweight since it only needs to load the Python stuff
once (when launched);

III. It's transparent to the simulation code since it runs as an independent
process.

IV. You don't need to compile or link any library to the existing
application.

V. The script can be used at any time. It's not restrict to run at
simulation's runtime

I have not finished the script yet (I'm just a novice in Python), but I was
planning to send it to the mail list in the future.

Message-ID: <0E07074B82CE4B4A9982802A8484B696847DEDB213@EXCHANGE2K7.tacc.utexas.edu>


Can't believe I never tried this before - I'm trying to use PV to render to a tiled display with 2 nodes driving 2 screens each in TwinView mode, and oriented one above the other.  Initially, all is well - the target screens show the grey background with the axes centered and the screens are filled.  Just what you'd expect.  Then, as soon as I put some geometry into the display (such as the Sphere source) smaller windows appear on the tile displays, one showing the top half of the correct image and the other the bottom, but clipped to the bounding box of the data.  Like the results of the first pass of a binary swap compositing -  data from both processes shows up in each.   When these windows appear, the rest of the tile displays revert to the original desktop background.  If I add --use-offscreen-rendering to the pvservers the two smaller windows still appear, but are black.  

So - how do I get rid of those windows?   And is there a way to suppress rendering to the PV client?

Thanks,
Greg

Hi Greg,

I guess we need to do better testing of tiled display rendering. This

Subject: [Paraview] more GUI problems
Message-ID: <1251924726.21471.24.camel@x60>

Apart from the line edit display trash, where I seem to be completely
alone, I noticed two more problems with the GUI in the (relatively)
recent CVS:

1) 'paste' does not work properly, either with middle mouse button, ctrl
+v or right mouse + paste. Ubuntu 9.04, Gnome. It does paste something,
but certainly not the current content of the (either) clipboards.

2) clicking '?' button on the left panel opens help window, but the
colors are totally hardcoded and do not obey either Gnome font colors or
Qtconfig specs. I see white text on pale background so my guess it text
color is respected, background ignored (I use bright on dark system/QT
schemes).

3) numerous data analysis filters assume dark on bright and generate
unreadable plots with my color scheme.

And yes, the broken tooltip colors once reported by me are now
(silently) repaired (even though my claim on the bug tracker was
rejected).

If anyone confirms similar problems I can file a bug.

best regards,
Dominik

This is slightly tangential, but I always thought that there should be a method to simply turn it on or off.  Whenever I wanted to use this function, it was really in a script where I simply wanted to suppress the messages.  In order to do that, I need to go through a weird process of checking the flag and then toggling if it's on.

Along a similar line, it seems like this might be convenient as a command line parameter where when I'm running the script as a debug I would leave the output on, but once I send it over to the cluster I'd just add the flag to disable it in the qsub instead of needing to change the script.

Greg,

I've committed a fix for this issue on to the ParaView CVS head. Once
you confirm that the issue is resolved, I'll move the patch to 3.6
branch and it will be included in 3.6.2 patch release.

Attached is a patch for the changed files against the 3.6 branch to
make it easier for you to test against your current checkout.

I agree - I am guilty of the stupid implementation. I'd suggest
putting this in the bug tracker so that I remember to fix it by 3.8.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.6.1 transient EnsightGold error
Message-ID: <20090903070420.189540@gmx.net>

I have a (transient) *.encas file with some additional velocity and scalar files. The files are created from FLUENT 6.3 in conjunction with fluents dynamic mesh model.

If i open my *.encase file with paraview 3.6.1, i get the following error message:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx, line 412
vtkGenericEnSightReader (1B8ACC40): Unable to open file: C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\Chefkoch\Desktop\TEST's\paraview-files\/C:\fluent-files\Paraview\faser-init0100.geo

Warning: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx, line 413
vtkGenericEnSightReader (1B8ACC40): Assuming binary file.

When I click the Apply button the following error message will appear:

Modified Time: 189783
Reference Count: 1
Registered Events: (none)
Request: REQUEST_DATA

The error message will only appear with the transient *.encas file format. It will not appear with the steady-state *.encas file format.
The error message will appear when I activate the dynamic mesh model, or when I do not.

I?m not very familiar with paraview. So I have no idea what the problem is. I hope you can help me.

Thanks
Chris

Hi,


I was wondering what is the level of support for vrpn in paraview.
I manage to find almost nothing on the list
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011444.html
I am interested in using paraview with a iotracker system.
Anybody else done this?

regards,

Alin


PS I also searched VTK list and found a reference to some old vrpn bindings 
for vtk, but unfortunately it seems that they did not make it in vtk. They may 
be a good addition to paraview.

Ok, that is different to what I found for the format in the Ensight User
Guide. Here is an example:

====================================================
FORMAT
type: ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model: 1 ./wing_unsteady_i.geo*

VARIABLE
scalar per node: 1 Mach_number ./wing_unsteady_i.Mach_number*

TIME
time set: 1
number of steps: 2
filename start number: 10
filename increment: 10
time values: 0.01 0.02
=====================================================

The actual filenames are:

m6.pval.unsteady_i.geo10
m6.pval.unsteady_i.geo20
m6.pval.unsteady_i.Mach_number10
m6.pval.unsteady_i.Mach_number20

Your format may also be valid, but I don't recognise it. The above one,
however, definitely works.

  2) how to clip an unstructured dataset with the expected resulting effect on the memory size?

I think you can use the "Extract Cells By Region" filter here. As far as I 
understand, the original data remains in memory as well, so in order to reduce 
memory usage you then have to write the reduced data to a file and start from 
there.

Cheers,

Bart

This is exactly what I planned to do but since the number of points grows up as I extract the subset, even the writing process makes Paraview crashing due to memory allocation errors.
Thanks for the tip for using vtkExtractCellsByRegion instead, it actually gives the expected result!
Cheers

Somehow I missed this original email.

I don't think BuildLinks is a good explanation here.  If you have removed 99 out of 100 cells, I can't imagine the output growing to take up twice as much memory just because links were built.  The clip filter will also tetrahedral your data, but that should only grow it by a factor of at most 6, not 200.

I assume you are using the Clip filter with Clip Type of Box.  Are you sure that the output contains the cells that are inside the box (the 1%) rather than outside the box (the 99%)?  By default, the clip filter will clip away everything inside the box and leave the rest.  To get only the cells in the box, you have to click on the Inside Out checkbox.  If you set the representation to Surface, do you get what you expect?  Does the cell count drop by a factor of 100?

BTW, using Extract Cells By Region was a good suggestion.  If you are just interested in extracting a group of cells, this filter should be more efficient and consume less memory.

I have an unstructured data set with 9 scalar data fields, which occupies 573 MB, I clip it with a very small box (less than 1% of the whole domain) and the resulting subset occupies 1,920 MB!! Nice!
So:
  1) how is it possible?
  2) how to clip an unstructured dataset with the expected resulting effect on the memory size?

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with custom time-aware reader
Message-ID: <4A9FDE7B.4020009@web.de>

Hi,

I have a problem with a custom time-aware reader which I seem to cannot
work out on my own. I'm hoping someone on this list can shed some light
on the problem.

The reader is designed following John's excellent tutorial
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/2/20/IEEE08_Time-In-ParaView.ppt)
and has been boiled down for this question to its essentials:

Read in a sequence of plain ASCII text files, each of them containing
exactly one floating point value, nothing more. The values are
interpreted as time step values.

The problem is that all files of the file series are inspected in method
RequestInformation, time information is displayed correctly in the
Information tab, I can walk through the files using VCR controls and
current data time step is properly increased/decreased. The problem,
though, is that for every time step the very same file - always the last
file of the file series - is loaded in RequestData.

Here is the recipe to reproduce:
Unpack and compile the attached plugin in the usual manner using
  mkdir build; cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
           -DParaView_DIR=/path/to/paraview/build/dir
and load it into ParaView 3.6.1 or 3.7-cvs.

Create a sample input file series via:
  for i in $(seq 0 9); do echo "0.${i}00" > file${i}.foo ; done
(there is already such a file series in the tarball)

Open the collapsed file series "file..foo" in the file open dialog. On
standard output it will be shown that method RequestInformation is
called for all files of the sequence once, and an additional time for
the last file. (I probably could work around that by storing the name of
the last file being parsed and comparing it to the current file name.
But that's of minor interest.)
Click on the Apply button and walk through the files. On standard output
it will be reported that this->FileName does not change at all. I fail
to understand why. Am I missing some callback routine? According to my
understanding

output->GetInformation()->Set(
   vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS(),
   &TimeStepValues[this->ActualTimeStep], 1);

in RequestData should do the magic, but it does not. Does anyone have an
idea?

Thanks a lot in advance.
Karl

Everything looks like it is working fine to me.  It looks like you are getting the right time value in RequestData, you are finding the right time index, and you are setting the right time value in the output data.

The only thing wrong I see is that it is always printing out the filename for the last file.  But I don't see anywhere in RequestData where you translated the time index to a file name.  At some point, probably in RequestInformation, FileName is set to the last file.  That never is overridden in RequestData.

Hi,

I have a problem with a custom time-aware reader which I seem to cannot
work out on my own. I'm hoping someone on this list can shed some light
on the problem.

The reader is designed following John's excellent tutorial
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/2/20/IEEE08_Time-In-ParaView.ppt)
and has been boiled down for this question to its essentials:

Read in a sequence of plain ASCII text files, each of them containing
exactly one floating point value, nothing more. The values are
interpreted as time step values.

The problem is that all files of the file series are inspected in method
RequestInformation, time information is displayed correctly in the
Information tab, I can walk through the files using VCR controls and
current data time step is properly increased/decreased. The problem,
though, is that for every time step the very same file - always the last
file of the file series - is loaded in RequestData.

Here is the recipe to reproduce:
Unpack and compile the attached plugin in the usual manner using
  mkdir build; cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
           -DParaView_DIR=/path/to/paraview/build/dir
and load it into ParaView 3.6.1 or 3.7-cvs.

Create a sample input file series via:
  for i in $(seq 0 9); do echo "0.${i}00" > file${i}.foo ; done
(there is already such a file series in the tarball)

Open the collapsed file series "file..foo" in the file open dialog. On
standard output it will be shown that method RequestInformation is
called for all files of the sequence once, and an additional time for
the last file. (I probably could work around that by storing the name of
the last file being parsed and comparing it to the current file name.
But that's of minor interest.)
Click on the Apply button and walk through the files. On standard output
it will be reported that this->FileName does not change at all. I fail
to understand why. Am I missing some callback routine? According to my
understanding

output->GetInformation()->Set(
   vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS(),
   &TimeStepValues[this->ActualTimeStep], 1);

in RequestData should do the magic, but it does not. Does anyone have an
idea?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Zhanping, all:

I have gone forward with this problem today. Uncommenting all the checks
in vkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx makes paraview reading the file without
any problem. I think the problem with the checks are related to a 64Bit
issue. It seems to me as this->FileSize is incorrect for this case. The
*.geo file uses 2.2GB of discspace and the function seem to report wrong
(negative?) filesize.
How can this 64Bit issue be solved? I have compiled paraview on a x86_64
machine as usual. Do I have to do something special for compiling with
64 Bit? Otherwise the file is read without problems it cannot be totally
wrong. What is the best was to debug/solve this problem? Thanks.

Regards BastiL

Utkarsh,

Thanks for the quick fix - applied to 3.6, and it works. ?However, I'm
using a Sphere source for testing, and when I set the two resolutions
to 200, I get an immediate crash. ?I'm using a 3x3 display, and each
is 2560x1600. ?Didn't happen when I used 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles - but
did at 3x3. ?Also doesn't happen if I set the resolutions to only 100.

Greg,

I've committed a fix for this issue on to the ParaView CVS head. Once
you confirm that the issue is resolved, I'll move the patch to 3.6
branch and it will be included in 3.6.2 patch release.

Attached is a patch for the changed files against the 3.6 branch to
make it easier for you to test against your current checkout.

So, essentially what you are suggesting is to create a mapping
timeStepValue -> FileName in RequestInformation and to set
this->FileName depending on the value of
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0]
in RequestData?

I didn't see anything like that happen in any of the other readers in
directory ParaView3/VTK/IO. So, I assumed some magic happening when
invoking
  output->GetInformation()->Set(
     vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS(),
     &TimeStepValues[this->ActualTimeStep], 1);

After all, this->FileName gets automagically set before invoking
RequestInformation.

So, I have to set this->FileName manually? Actually, I tried that
already before posting. At the end of RequestData I set brutally

----- cut ---
  this->FileName = "file0.foo";
  std::cout << "RequestData: Got request for opening file <"
            << this->FileName << ">..."  << endl;
  this->UpdateProgress(1.0);
  return 1;
}
----- cut ---

That works, the correct file is opened, but it has the side effect of
segfaulting ParaView as soon as I disconnect from the server or delete
the reader object.
(Using the mapping timeStepValue -> FileName instead of hardcoding
FileName had the same effect.)

 The number of points (numPts, on line 2502) returned by
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader::ReadInt(int *result) is of type int, whereas the
file size (2.2GB) is beyond the valid range. I will fix it.

Thanks.

This is weird, I thought I could reproduce this, but I no longer can.

Try this, before connecting to the server from the client, open
"Edit|Settings", then on the "Render View | Server" page, change the
"Compositing Threshold" in "Tile Display Parameters" to 0. Then
connect to the server and create sphere etc. Do you get the segfault
immediately this time?

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0909031918290.14703@alice.wonderland.caltech.edu>


Hi,

I'm using a Macbook with OS X 10.5.8 and Paraview 3.6.1 and I've run into 
the following problem.  I typically dualscreen my Macbook with an external 
monitor, and I generally keep the Pipeline Browser and Object Inspector on 
the external monitor, i.e. I've taken them out of the left pane.

Today I went to show my co-workers my data, having only my Macbook with no 
external monitor.  Paraviews remembers its state, so when I opened 
Paraview the Pipeline Browser and Object Inspector were in seperate 
windows, both completely off-screen.  I couldn't see or access these 
windows to drag them back on-screen (they don't show up in Expose.) 
Simply turning them off/on using the View menu had no effect.

Is there a way I can bring the Pipeline Browser, Object Inspector, etc. 
windows back in the left pane without being able to drag them?

While it wasn't a big deal today, I could see this being a total disaster 
if I were giving a talk.

Thanks,
Keith

You have the basic idea.  The seg fault is probably happening because the destructor of you class is trying to free the pointer you set to it, which is probably actually pointing to some spot on the stack.

You are probably not seeing this mapping/lookup in the VTK IO classes because you are looking at classes that do not directly support time (such as the legacy readers and XML readers).  Those readers read exactly one file with one time step in it.  ParaView has a magic meta reader called a FileSeriesReader that takes a real reader and a collection of files and multiplexes the files to the reader based on the time.

In retrospect, this is probably an easier way to go (assuming your final reader is a file series like this).  Documentation on using the FileSeriesReader is on the Wiki at

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Restarted_Simulation_Readers#Customized_Restart_Reader

So, essentially what you are suggesting is to create a mapping
timeStepValue -> FileName in RequestInformation and to set
this->FileName depending on the value of
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0]
in RequestData?

I didn't see anything like that happen in any of the other readers in
directory ParaView3/VTK/IO. So, I assumed some magic happening when
invoking
  output->GetInformation()->Set(
     vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS(),
     &TimeStepValues[this->ActualTimeStep], 1);

After all, this->FileName gets automagically set before invoking
RequestInformation.

So, I have to set this->FileName manually? Actually, I tried that
already before posting. At the end of RequestData I set brutally

----- cut ---
  this->FileName = "file0.foo";
  std::cout << "RequestData: Got request for opening file <"
            << this->FileName << ">..."  << endl;
  this->UpdateProgress(1.0);
  return 1;
}
----- cut ---

That works, the correct file is opened, but it has the side effect of
segfaulting ParaView as soon as I disconnect from the server or delete
the reader object.
(Using the mapping timeStepValue -> FileName instead of hardcoding
FileName had the same effect.)

You can start paraview with --disable-registry or -dr.  But next time
you run paraview without those flags you'll be back in the same boat.

I thought someone had written some code to detect the problem you are
having and move the windows back within the bounds of the visible
desktop... you can always track down your settings file
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files) and delete the
entry for pqClientMainWindow

I've been aware of that page. In fact, FooReader.xml and
FooReaderGUI.xml of the tarball I posted already did make use of the
FileSeriesReader. Together with calling
  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(), ...)
  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), ...)
in RequestInformation it is responsible for inspecting all files of the
series between selecting them in the file open dialog and appearing of
the Apply button.

Anyway, I'll try to use again the mapping time step value -> file name
and iron out the segfault on deletion of the reader object.

I'll post the solution in case I can work it out and someone is interested.

When saving a state file with a StreamTracer, I have the following problem:

the coordinates of the Point Source (seeds) get reset, after the first
execution of the streamer. What I mean is that the coordinates of the
seeds are correctly initialized by the values saved in the state file,
and as soon as the Streamer Qt panel is made visible, the coordinates
get reset to some automatically-generated values, thus losing my own
settings.

This is true both for both the 3.6 and CVS versions. Here is a statefile
for the bluntin dataset.

Has anyone seen this behavior?

Hi Jean,

I can reproduce the problem and it is familiar. I came across it in September
2007 with ParaView 2.6.2, but somehow failed to file a bug report back then. I
wasn't aware that the problem still persists in current versions, though.

Message-ID: <ef747b890909040603k22190706lc7be4564a1233b58@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

ParaView 2.x had a very simple way to store and recovery camera positions (6
buttons on the camera tab). Is there any similar feature in ParaView 3.x?
Where is it hidden?

Thanks

Did this problem start after an update? In other words, is this a clean build?

I am afraid this was lost in transition. Feel free to add a feature
request to the bugtracker.

Yes, it's a clean build based on the CVS head from 2009-09-01. I have
not (yet) successfully built any version of ParaView/OverView for
Windows. I'm following the build instructions here:

http://kitware.com/InfovisWiki/index.php/Building_OverView

The only variation from those instructions is that I have a current
version of Qt (4.5.2) instead of 4.3.3. 4.5.2 worked fine for a Mac OS
X build.

Subject: [Paraview] Object size in screenshots
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0909040628u70128edfnc7720bf218eb60ee@mail.gmail.com>

If you have points or lines in the scene and you take a screen shot at a
higher resolution than the current window (say 5000x5000), many of the
objects stay the same size (spheres, planes, triangulated meshes) but many
objects get much smaller (points, lines). Surely this is because the points
and lines are specified in arbitrary units (Point Size = 3, Line Width=2,
for example). An example is here:
http://rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/linesize.jpg

Notice the lines in the screenshot are much thinner.

Is there a way to have theses sizes automatically adjusted to the relative
difference between the screenshot size and the render window size, so
screenshots will look the same?

Thanks,

David

I don't think that there is any way other than manually adjusting the
line width/point size. I would add a feature request. If enough people
are interested, we may be able to implement it.

The issue is that the points and lines sizes are measured in pixels, so the relative size goes down when you increase screen resolution.  One easy way around this is to covert the points/lines into 3D objects.  Points can become spheres with the glyph filter and lines can become tubes with the tube filter.  I believe the point sprite plugin can also efficiently render points as spheres with radii defined in world space.  I have seen an example of plugin that can render lines as tubes directly (at least with correct lighting), but I don't know where to (or if you can) get it.

Converting them to 3d objects is a good idea. Here is my file:
http://rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/lines.vtp

When I run a glyph filter, it seems to want to glyph the normals, not the
points. If I change it to "sphere", the desired result is obtained, but that
seems a bit wacky. Shouldn't I be able to select "Points" somewhere?

When I run the tube filter I get a bunch of these:

 Bad normal s = 0.433013 0.75 0.5 n = 0 0 0

Could not generate points!

I'm not familiar with the tube filter - is there something else I need to
do?

Thanks,

David

Hi Elena,

We have been working on paraview + vrpn interaction plugin since the
beginning of the year. ParaView's native support for vrpn is not existent as
far as we know, so we had to write our own code using QT an C++. We have
 manipulated paraview's camera and translation filters with a wiimote and
with a gamepad. We can not send you a copy of our code until we talk to our
superiors, but if you need any help feel free to ask us any questions.

Best Regards,

For the glyph filter, you want to use the sphere glyph and turn all scaling off.  One problem you might run into is that the glyph filter will place glyphs on all points in your mesh regardless of what type of cell is on it (0, 1, or 2D).

I think the warnings you are getting with the tube filter happen when you have large bends in the tube.  If the output looks OK, you should be able to ignore them.

1) When I set the glyph filter to sphere, it is placing spheres only at the
20 points on the "grid" in that file, not at the vertex where all the lines
meet. There are 21 points in the file - so I would expect it to put a sphere
at all 21 points. That is what I was trying to explain last time, it seems
to be glyphing Vectors: Normals, not points. I can't change the "Vectors"
drop down box to anything except "Normals", and the scalars drop down box is
disabled. When I turned "Scale mode" to "off" as you recommended, the 21st
sphere showed up - but doesn't it still seem odd that you have to set it to
glyph normals even though you want to glyph points?

2) I guess I forgot to mention that the tube filter does not produce any
output, in fact my render window is completely empty after applying the
filter. So I guess I should not ignore the errors in this case haha!

Thanks,

David

Hi Alin,

I now have a copy of the VRPN classes but they do not directly apply
to ParaView without more coding. We have been somewhat interested in
adding support for alternative interaction devices to ParaView but we
don't have any direct funding for it yet. I will look into getting the
VRPN support into VTK relatively soon. If anyone is interested taking
it from there, it would be great.

Normals are just a field on the points.  The glyph filter can orient and scale glyphs by any normals.  As I stated before, you should turn off scaling.  You can also turn off orientation, although with spheres you shouldn't notice anything different.

2) I guess I forgot to mention that the tube filter does not produce any output, in fact my render window is completely empty after applying the filter. So I guess I should not ignore the errors in this case haha!

Hmm.  I've never seen that before.  The tube filter seems to be doing something special with normals, but I don't know what.  Perhaps someone more familiar with the guts of the tube filter can comment.

Not directly supported but there's a workaround...

Write what you want using any tool able to save the text as image (png,
tiff). Load the image in ParaView and translate, scale, rotate to put the
"text" in the desired position.

...it's hard, but possible ;oP

Subject: [Paraview] NetCDF4 timeseries reader
In-Reply-To: <4AA01C25.8050709@web.de>
Message-ID: <C6C6C882.FD7%Thomas.Maxwell@nasa.gov>

I am implementing a native NetCDF4/HDF5 reader that will read a timeseries of grids, with each grid stored in a different nc4 file.   I am constructing the timeseries by doing a recursive search through a directory tree for a glob pattern with start and end dates.   I would like to enable the user to enter a set of parameters through the client interface, setting the search root directory, search depth, glob pattern, and start & end dates.  I had hoped to be able to put fields for entering these parameters in the properties panel of the object inspector for the dataset.   However, the timeseries file search needs to be executed during the GetInformation call, which happens before the properties panel becomes accessible.  The reader is currently working correctly, but there is no way to configure the file search from the client- the default values of the search parameters (set in the server plugin xml) are always used.   Do you have any suggestions for handling this situation?

Hi Berk and Andres,

Thank you very much for you answer.
I did myself some research about and found out that in the past was a proposal 
for vtkVRPN by a French group from CEA. The library can still be downloaded 
from vtk mailing list. 
I have contacted already one of the authors to see its the status. Last year 
was presented another VR framework based on vtkVRPN
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1450598&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=50234741&CFTOKEN=41046885

Once integrated in vtk should not be impossible to be added to the paraview. 
Here we are enthusiast contributing code. We just do not want to duplicate 
efforts or try to rediscover the wheel.

regards,

Alin

Thanks for your quick responses this morning!

I'm running CMake 2.6-patch4.

The patch gets me through compiling pqHelpWindow.cxx, but now linking fails:

Are you sure you Qt installation does have the help subsystem
installed correctly? Can you post your CMakeCache.txt?

I am afraid there's no direct support for allowing the user to choose
the file-name-pattern etc. before the reader's GetInformation is
called. This is because ParaView assumes the user has chosen the files
already from the file-dialog.

One possible solution would be have some default values for the
pattern etc., and allow the user to pick a file from the file-series
using the file dialog. Then the user can qualify his selection by
changing the start/end/pattern etc. on the reader.

Looks like Qt help module was not found by CMake at all. Look under
C:/Qtvcpp/4.5.2/lib/ is there a QtHelp4.lib, QtHelp4d.lib etc?

Nope. Nothing like that at all.

When I started out with the binary Qt, the lib directory contains
libQtHelp4.a and libQtHelpd4.a. Likewise for the Qt I built from
source using MinGW. There is no actual .lib file or DLL, but at least
there's a hint of the help module.

I will work on repairing my Qt installation and let you know how
things go. Thanks for your careful sleuthing so far.

1) Ah, I understand now. I guess it would make more sense to me if the
layout was more like this:
Scale mode: off/vector/scalar
Data to use: Normals/Your Data/Something else

But only data that makes sense in the selected scale mode is available.

Also - why is there no Shaft Length setting for the arrows?

2) ok, we'll see if anyone has any ideas.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0909051832r76e89673s161957e4fb9fda4a@mail.gmail.com>

When I try to run the tube filter on this file to convert lines to tubes:
http://rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/lines.vtp

There is no output, and I get these errors:

Bad normal s = 0.433013 0.75 0.5 n = 0 0 0
Could not generate points!

Can anyone see anything wrong with that file? I mean it looks like there is
a zero normal, but isn't a tube simply defined by two points like a line is?

Thanks,

OOPS!  STOP!  BACK UP!  I looked at your code too quickly, misunderstood what you were doing, and gave totally the wrong advise.  Please ignore everything I said before.

If you are using the file series reader, then your reader should be completely ignorant of any file series.  It should read in only the file it is given, and if that file changes then it should ignore whatever file it was previously given.  Therefore, the problem with your reader is that it is trying to collect time information over all the files.  That is the job of the file series reader and as a result it is fouling up the operation of the file series reader.

So, what your reader should do is read in the time value in the file it is given, set the TIME_STEPS key to ONLY that time value and set the TIME_RANGE to be only that range.  Attached is a modified version of your reader example that has all that time series management stripped out.  The resulting code is much smaller and actually works.

Specifically what was happening was that by the time RequestInformation was called on the last time step, your reader had collected information about all the time steps and returned all the time steps in all the files.  The file series reader thought you meant that the last file contained all those time steps (some file formats do contain multiple time steps in a single file).  Because your reader said that the last file contained all the time steps, the file series reader was using that last file for all the time steps.

I've been aware of that page. In fact, FooReader.xml and
FooReaderGUI.xml of the tarball I posted already did make use of the
FileSeriesReader. Together with calling
  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(), ...)
  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), ...)
in RequestInformation it is responsible for inspecting all files of the
series between selecting them in the file open dialog and appearing of
the Apply button.

Anyway, I'll try to use again the mapping time step value -> file name
and iron out the segfault on deletion of the reader object.

I'll post the solution in case I can work it out and someone is interested.

Ok, I did not understand "inside out" as "by default inside is out" but rather "clic this if you want that inside be out", I always understood that clipping a space by a given volume was supposed to be an action to limit the working space by the closed volume, as for a view frustum.
Anyway let us comme back to my memory management problem and look at this funny experience.
I have an unstructured dataset with a large number of point data fields.
First I tried to determine the largest dataset I could load in my computer memory. So I increased the number of point data fields till ParaView crashes and I managed to load 1.9GB.
Now another experience. I load the same dataset with 11 scalar fields and 1 vector field, all of this consuming 722MB. Now I clip it with a plane approximatively at the center of the volume. So I would expect that the total memory size necessary for storing the pipeline be in the range 722+722/2 and 722x2, that is between duplicate just half the volume or duplicate it entirely and just keep in mind that there is a cutting plane somewhere. And ParaView crashes for memory reason as just as a litte bit more than half of the job was done.
I do not understand the error message below and especially why ParaView requires 189M elements of 4 bytes each since my dataset has 6.23M points and 6.26M cells, 11 scalar fields and 1 vector field (all as point data, no cell data).
I still think that there is a real issue in memory management.
I use ParaView 3.4.0 on a Mac.

Re: [Paraview] How to extract a subdataset?


Somehow I missed this original email.



I don?t think BuildLinks is a good explanation here.  If you have removed 99 out of 100 cells, I can?t imagine the output growing to take up twice as much memory just because links were built.  The clip filter will also tetrahedral your data, but that should only grow it by a factor of at most 6, not 200.



I assume you are using the Clip filter with Clip Type of Box.  Are you sure that the output contains the cells that are inside the box (the 1%) rather than outside the box (the 99%)?  By default, the clip filter will clip away everything inside the box and leave the rest.  To get only the cells in the box, you have to click on the Inside Out checkbox.  If you set the representation to Surface, do you get what you expect?  Does the cell count drop by a factor of 100?



BTW, using Extract Cells By Region was a good suggestion.  If you are just interested in extracting a group of cells, this filter should be more efficient and consume less memory.

I mean without having the subset be more memory consumming than its including part!

I have an unstructured data set with 9 scalar data fields, which occupies 573 MB, I clip it with a very small box (less than 1% of the whole domain) and the resulting subset occupies 1,920 MB!! Nice!

So:

  1) how is it possible?

  2) how to clip an unstructured dataset with the expected resulting effect on the memory size?

Hi,

I think that tube filter makes use of the "normal" for generating each plane
of the parallels along the tube. In your file, you already have a "NORMALS"
PointData. Maybe the tube filter is disturbed by these data.

If you set this field to be a "VECTORS" and not "NORMALS", tube filter
should have better behaviour.

Hope that helps
Jerome

Interesting -

You are correct, I unchecked "Normals" in the properties Cell/Point Array
Status box and the tube filter worked. I'd consider this a bug - if no one
disagrees I'll file a report.

Hi Ken,

Thank you very much for taking the time to look into my problem again.
As a matter of fact I had worked out a solution using its own
bookkeeping of files by means of a "vtkStringArray *FileNames".
But you are right, your solution is minimal and avoids re-implementing
features already provided by
ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx, features I haven't
been aware of because I simply followed the instructions to use the
class without actually studying it.

I hope you don't mind that I still have a few questions about the
prototypical time-aware reader FooReader for files series with one time
step value per file and no meta file.

1) I opened the file series file*.foo from the tarball attached to my
initial posting and opened the Python shell from within ParaView 3.6.1
(having successfully loaded the plugin by setting PV_PLUGIN_PATH). I get
a warning I cannot make any sense of:

Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Jan  4 2009, 18:00:02)
[GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
>>> from paraview.simple import *
Warning: FooReader is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in
the ParaView configuration files
>>> 

Deleting ~/.config/ParaView/ParaView3.6.ini does not remove the warning.
 I wonder what's wrong with this reader plugin as for the other reader
plugin that comes with ParaView 3.6.1, the VisIt Reader, there is no
such warning.
I get the same message for a cvs build (paraview version 3.7.0, Date:
2009-09-05).

2) Despite the warning, using the reader works from Python
>>> view = GetActiveView(); view.ViewTime; 
0.0
>>> reader = GetActiveSource(); reader.TimestepValues
[0.0, 0.10000000000000001, 0.20000000000000001, 0.29999999999999999,
0.40000000000000002, 0.5, 0.59999999999999998, 0.69999999999999996,
0.80000000000000004, 0.90000000000000002]
>>> view.ViewTime = -1.2; Render()
=> on standard output I can see that RequestData is invoked and the
first file, file0.foo, is loaded, i.e. clamping provided by
FileSeriesReader works for FooReader. Same for snapping to files for
non-existent time step values works:
>>> view.ViewTime = 0.19; Render()
=> second file, file1.foo, is loaded.

But I noticed from the standard output that only RequestData is called.
When using the VCR controls from the GUI to step to the next file,
ParaView behaves differently: first RequestInformation is called, then
RequestData, then again RequestInformation. If both RequestInformation
and RequestData contained a call to MyReadFile, that would be three
times parsing the same file.
a) Could someone please elaborate on the need to calling
RequestInformation twice?
b) Would I run into trouble (e.g. when using some kind of filter) if I
kept book of the file read last and skipping RequestInformation if
this->FileName hasn't changed since called last time? That would
eliminate the overhead of the trailing RequestInformation call.
c) Would I run into trouble if I kept book of all files read initially
(i.e. after pressing ok in the open file dialog) and completely skipped
later calls of RequestInformation, e.g. via

int vtkFooReader::RequestInformation(vtkInformation *request,
vtkInformationVector **inputVector, vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  if (this->FileNames->LookupValue(this->FileName) < 0)
    {
    ...
    this->FileNames->InsertNextValue(this->FileName);
    ...
    }
  return 1;
}

I tried b) and c) and applying a couple of filters I did not notice any
unwanted side effects. I couldn't test all of them, so did I miss a
combination where skipping RequestInformation before and after calling
RequestData - but still having run RequestInformation once for all files
initially - does make a difference?

Thank you very much in advance.

Karl

Subject: [Paraview] Complete list of filters + descriptions?
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0909061600s6a471564jd231a7ad62acc57b@mail.gmail.com>

Does something like this:
https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/Category:Paraview_Filters

exist on the official paraview wiki? If not - is it possible to directly
copy those wiki pages somehow onto the Paraview wiki? Or would it have to be
done a page at a time? And is that legal/acceptable? It seems there should
really be an official version of which filters are included and what they do
- maybe I am just missing it?

Thanks,

David

It looks like this was all the result of a botched Qt install. I
removed Qt, then reinstalled it using CuteBuilder 0.8.0 with all the
default options selected. This time, Qt's lib directory had the QtHelp
modules you mentioned.

Building OverView took 4.5 hours, but it worked.

Thanks for all your help.

Since someone brought it up, I would love to be able to use Japanese. It
would be nice to have ParaView support all kinds of different languages, in
the interface as well.

Hi!
I have unstructured grid with points (particles from discrete element
simulation).
How can I plot over time number of points inside specified volume?
(I need to calculate a mass flow of particles).

It is a bug in the sense that the filter does not allow you to use
nothing instead of an array if only 1 array is present. The filter
should allow you to select "None" in the vectors field when vectors
are optional. It is not a bug in the sense that the normals that are
in the file are not appropriate for computing the orientation of the
tube - this feature is used to generate oriented tubes that show the
rotation along a streamline.

I would change that a bit. The ability to use Latex is not the main
issue here. Rather, it is the ability to use symbols and other unicode
characters as well as (possibly) the ability to typeset equations.
Whether this is entered as Latex or MathML or something else is more
of an implementation detail, isn't it?

Ah, that one seems fine - I knew it had to exist, I just couldn't find it
anywhere. I added a prominent section to the wiki pointing to it.

Also, are the kitware wiki's maintained individually (vtk, itk, paraview,
etc)? Or is there a person/group in charge of globally maintaining them.
I've been asking to have a feature added to the vtk wiki for a while now,
but no one has responded at all / pointed me to the admin: below is the
email - I suppose it could be a cool thing to try on the paraview wiki too.

Can this be installed on the vtk wiki?

I suspect that Paul is close to the mark. I think that this may be due
to the use of a point locator to merge points in the output. Are
youinterested in helping us track this? If yes, you can recompile
ParaView with some minor changes to test my theory. Let me know.

We maintain the Wiki. There are a few responsible of simple tasks such
as authorizing users etc. and our sys admins are responsible of lower
level tasks such as adding plugins. I suspect that they don't follow
this list. I am not sure how useful that plugin will be for the
ParaView wiki but I'll see if we can give it a try.

Yea, I was imagining it useful for the coding examples on the VTK wiki - the
idea being each time someone figured out how to do something by looking at
the examples they could rate it well, and if they thought that example
should have helped them and it didn't, they could rate it poorly, and if the
example didn't compile or something, they could rate it very poorly. If many
of the examples received high ratings, I would continue maintaining them and
adding more. If they did not I could remove it or let it die. Any feedback
is good feedback, but I was getting no feedback haha.

Thanks,

David

Currently it's not possible to map opacity to scalar value for
surfaces. Feel free to add a feature request to the bug tracker at

You should be able to :

1) use pvbatch yourscript.py --use-offscreen-rendering
	Though I just tried this and I still get a window popping up 
	even though I use the mesa driver with osmesa. This may be a 
	bug.

2) Connect to a pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
	Though I just tried this and I still get a window popping up 
	even though I use the mesa driver with osmesa. This may be a 
	bug.

3) Use another X server such as Xvfb or vncserver which isn't shown on 
	your display. 

	vncserver :99 -geometry 1280x1024 -depth 24  > vncserver.txt 2>&1 &
	pvbatch pvtestscript.py
	vncserver -kill :99

	This works for me.

Can you describe exactly how the output is garbled, or post one of the
garbled images?

Does it look like the red green and blue values are assigned to
alternating pixels?

Does the same thing happen when you save a screenshot from the paraview
gui?

Among the many memory crashes, this one, which seems to have another origin:

paraview(1276,0xa0405720) malloc: *** error for object 0x4dda8400: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
Segmentation fault

It occurs when I try to isosurf a streamline so as to extract its first sample point. I tried it several times with different values closed to 0 and always the same result.

There is already for a bug for unicode support.
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7397

utf-8 is the most natural extension of ascii as codes 0-127 are encoded as
normal ascii.

If there is an eps driver for paraview, the Latex package, psfrag, can be
used to substitute equations for text.  One requirement is that the words
are put into the same show command in the postscript file.  More info about
the requirements for the psfrag package are available in their excellent
documentation available online:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/psfrag/

In this regard, unicode is not necessary for Latex math, only an
encapsulated postscript file.  Unicode has very limited support for the
characters which can be subscripts, therefore typesetting matters would be
an effort on its own.

Subject: [Paraview] Possible Bug: cross drawn over upsampled screenshot
Message-ID: <4AA58158.4030305@web.de>

Hello,

I may have discovered a bug in Paraview's (version 3.6.1) save 
screenshot feature. It seems to affect only wireframe representations. 
Would someone please try to reproduce it. Here's how to do so:

1. Load any geometric object into Paraview, or create a geometric 
primitive e.g. from the sources menu

2. Change the representation of the object to wireframe

3. Open the save screenshot dialog (File -> Save screenshot), and 
increase the default width or height of the output image by at least one 
pixel.

4. Complete the export and examine the output image. A cross is drawn 
across the output image as shown in the url/image:
http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b52/videohead/ParaviewScreenshot_Resolution_Bug.png

This artifact only observed when the default dimensions are increased. A 
  reduction in the default dimensions generates no such artifact.

Thanks,

- Olumide

Message-ID: <4AA5979B.60702@gmail.com>

HI all,

I used PV3 for a while, and I'm back now to use it ;-)

I have two questions here.

One can see two issues in the snapshots:

http://dl.free.fr/raH13rxR6

http://dl.free.fr/qAQKusG6l

- the contours with ImageData (input_vti.png) are much nicer than the
contours with UnstructuredGrid
(input_vtu.png). Theses files contain the same data (100x100x20,
float32, uniform grid).
Why ? How can I improve it for UG?

- with ImageData, I can't display colobar and I can't color surface with
scalars,
as with UnstructuredGrid. Why?

TIA.


Cheers,


PS: I use PV 3.4.0 from debian squeeze Qt 4.5.2.

Wow, that's really garbled.

It does not look like the problem I've seen before.

I just want to make sure you can make an output image at all. It does
not have to be a useful rendering just take a screenshot of the sphere
source. Then if that works and if you're doing volume rendering or
something more advanced, then try to make the rendering closer, a little
at a time, to what you are trying to do for real.

The Paraview GUI switches to offscreen rendering to make an output
image, but there is a check-box to turn that off and on.

The problem I've seen where the output images were garbled ( not as
badly as yours ) would happen whenever paraview or vtk took a
screenshot.  It did not matter if I used the GUI or not, offscreen or
not, nor if there was a screen attached to the X server.

So everything works as long as the rendering is displayed on an actual
monitor?

I've no problems with rendering, just as long as an openGL window is
able to open on the screen (I don't even need to render directly to it
i.e I can set view.UseOffScreenRenderingForScreenshots  = 1 so the
window opens but is black) 

I had been trying to prevent this window opening to allow scripts to run
in the background.  I get output for all cases except where I use the
--use-offscreen-rendering at the command line for pvpython or pvbatch

Thanks,

Lucy

Message-ID: <ef747b890909080625v245a789et7cb4c5cd39721e32@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to load the Python module from the Kitware ParaView releases
(outside the UI)? I've already tried but all that I've got was an error
message like the following:

Are we forced to build ParaView from scratch, including Python support, in
order to do it?

(Moreover, I can't understand why the simple.py module is looking for
something in C:/Kitware/ParaView-3-6-1/... since I have not specified this
path in any environment variable...)

Thanks Utkarsh, indirectly you answered my question.

Since vtkPythonWrapping is not present in the Kitware release, we must build
ParaView from scratch before loading ParaView/Python module.

Renato.

Try setting PYTHONPATH (as well as PATH) to the directories containing
the simple.py as well the dlls. Does that not work?

As I found out through trials and errors it can be done as follows (for
ParaView 3.6):

1. Add to pipeline Clip in order to, ok, clipping a required volume.
2. Add to Clip a ProgrammableFilter with following script:

di=self.GetInput()

do=self.GetOutput()

nbPoints=di.GetNumberOfPoints()

a=vtk.vtkDoubleArray()

a.SetName('nbPoints')

a.SetNumberOfComponents(1)

a.InsertNextValue(nbPoints)

do.GetPointData().AddArray(a)


3. Open Sphreadsheet View for this ProgrammableFilter. The spreadsheet

Here's what I did:

> set PATH=C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.6.1\bin;C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.6.1\lib\paraview-3.6;%PATH%
> set PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.6.1\bin;C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.6.1\lib\paraview-3.6;
> python.exe
>>> from paraview.simple import *

That worked for me, with no errors.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with custom time-aware reader
In-Reply-To: <4AA42875.4080901@web.de>
Message-ID: <C6CBD1FE.CD03%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I don't know why you are getting the FooReader warning.  It sounds like an object named FooReader is being defined twice in the server manager XML, but I don't know where.

The calling of RequestInformation is a little tricky to explain.  In general, RequestInformation should not be called when the time changes.  However, when the time changes, the file series reader changes the filename to the internal reader (in this case, the foo reader).  The correct behavior for the pipeline is to re-call RequestInformation if the the algorithm object gets modified (e.g. an ivar like FileName changes).  Thus, if the time changes then the file series reader will call RequestInformation on the foo reader from within the RequestData pipeline pass.  I would not be surprised if this was the same behavior in both the GUI and Python.  It might just be that the progress monitoring is slightly different.

Hi Ken,

Thank you very much for taking the time to look into my problem again.
As a matter of fact I had worked out a solution using its own
bookkeeping of files by means of a "vtkStringArray *FileNames".
But you are right, your solution is minimal and avoids re-implementing
features already provided by
ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx, features I haven't
been aware of because I simply followed the instructions to use the
class without actually studying it.

I hope you don't mind that I still have a few questions about the
prototypical time-aware reader FooReader for files series with one time
step value per file and no meta file.

1) I opened the file series file*.foo from the tarball attached to my
initial posting and opened the Python shell from within ParaView 3.6.1
(having successfully loaded the plugin by setting PV_PLUGIN_PATH). I get
a warning I cannot make any sense of:

Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Jan  4 2009, 18:00:02)
[GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
>>> from paraview.simple import *
Warning: FooReader is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in
the ParaView configuration files
>>>

Deleting ~/.config/ParaView/ParaView3.6.ini does not remove the warning.
 I wonder what's wrong with this reader plugin as for the other reader
plugin that comes with ParaView 3.6.1, the VisIt Reader, there is no
such warning.
I get the same message for a cvs build (paraview version 3.7.0, Date:
2009-09-05).

2) Despite the warning, using the reader works from Python
>>> view = GetActiveView(); view.ViewTime;
0.0
>>> reader = GetActiveSource(); reader.TimestepValues
[0.0, 0.10000000000000001, 0.20000000000000001, 0.29999999999999999,
0.40000000000000002, 0.5, 0.59999999999999998, 0.69999999999999996,
0.80000000000000004, 0.90000000000000002]
>>> view.ViewTime = -1.2; Render()
=> on standard output I can see that RequestData is invoked and the
first file, file0.foo, is loaded, i.e. clamping provided by
FileSeriesReader works for FooReader. Same for snapping to files for
non-existent time step values works:
>>> view.ViewTime = 0.19; Render()
=> second file, file1.foo, is loaded.

But I noticed from the standard output that only RequestData is called.
When using the VCR controls from the GUI to step to the next file,
ParaView behaves differently: first RequestInformation is called, then
RequestData, then again RequestInformation. If both RequestInformation
and RequestData contained a call to MyReadFile, that would be three
times parsing the same file.
a) Could someone please elaborate on the need to calling
RequestInformation twice?
b) Would I run into trouble (e.g. when using some kind of filter) if I
kept book of the file read last and skipping RequestInformation if
this->FileName hasn't changed since called last time? That would
eliminate the overhead of the trailing RequestInformation call.
c) Would I run into trouble if I kept book of all files read initially
(i.e. after pressing ok in the open file dialog) and completely skipped
later calls of RequestInformation, e.g. via

int vtkFooReader::RequestInformation(vtkInformation *request,
vtkInformationVector **inputVector, vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  if (this->FileNames->LookupValue(this->FileName) < 0)
    {
    ...
    this->FileNames->InsertNextValue(this->FileName);
    ...
    }
  return 1;
}

I tried b) and c) and applying a couple of filters I did not notice any
unwanted side effects. I couldn't test all of them, so did I miss a
combination where skipping RequestInformation before and after calling
RequestData - but still having run RequestInformation once for all files
initially - does make a difference?

Thank you very much in advance.

Karl

Message-ID: <c9adba420909080824t6ed0a1bl8a716504cdaa3698@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to create a new view in ParaView and I would like to transform
the data before it is drawn (e.g. from cartesian to cylindrical
co-ordinates) and also apply a filter to handle cells that cross the 2PI and
0 boundary.  My first attempt has been to subclass pqRenderView but I don't
know where I can put the transform and filter code that will be executed for
everything that is displayed.

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Paul

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0909080834y4b40e47at10de5b1b1da5277b@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to draw a non-rectangular shape and do something equivalent
of "select cells through" - where the region you draw is back projected
"infinitely" and anything in the projection is selected? (Equivalent to the
"free select tool" or "lasso" tool in GIMP) I'm finding it very hard to
select some regions of a 3d model only using rectangles!

Thanks,

You will have to create a new representation as well that places the
transform filter in the representation pipeline. Alternatively, you
can create a new representation strategy. The representations always
ask the view for a strategy. A strategy is a pipeline used to deliver
the data to the rendering nodes. However you can very easily create
new sub-strategies for the ones returned by the standard render-view
hierarchy and simply insert the transform filter at the start of the
strategy pipeline.

Ofcourse, though I use words like "simple", it's not that trivial :).
Creating new render-view based views/representations that work in all
configurations (client-server etc.) can be a daunting task. Look at
how 2Drenderview or comparative renderviews are created. They may
serve as a good reference.

Ah, your config also worked for me. The problem was that I was configuring
PATH and PYTHONPATH in my *user* environment instead of changing the
*system* variables.

Thanks a lot

Not currently. However feel free to add it to uservoice or the bug
tracker and if there's enough interest, we can try to support it in
the future releases.

Hi Ken,

That has been very helpful!
Changing FooReader.xml such that

<SourceProxy name="FooReader" ...>

now belongs to

<ProxyGroup name="internal_sources">

and leaving

<FileSeriesReaderProxy name="FooSeriesReader"

in

<ProxyGroup name="sources">

(and subsequently adapting the subproxy definition for FileSeriesReaderProxy to
refer to proxy group "internal_sources" instead of "sources") I got rid of the
warning.

Thanks for the explanation. So, I guess it shouldn't harm to add some code to prevent re-parsing the same file again in RequestInformation in case this->FileName hasn't changed since the last time RequestData has been called.

Thank you very much for your patience and advice!

Subject: [Paraview] Color textured object using colormap?
Message-ID: <89705896-1647-4F19-B6DE-663A02E294DD@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I am wondering whether it is possible in PV to use a grayscale texture  
on an object, and then also color the object using a colormap?

What I would like to be able to do is to Glyph using a custom source  
which has a texture map applied, and then also color those glyphs  
according to a scalar value in the data which is being glyphed.

So far I can only see the texture applied to my glyphs if I have the  
"Color by" setting on Solid Color -- any other settings, such as  
coloring by the Ids of a point cloud which is being glyphed, revert  
back to non-textured geometry.

Just to be clear, I don't really need each face of my textured object  
to have separate colors, I just want each textured object to have a  
single solid color in addition to my grayscale texture, but have that  
single solid color defined by looking up a scalar value in a color map.

Thanks,
-Eric

The file series reader should already be maintaining that for you.  It should only be calling the foo reader's RequestInformation when the file name changes.

There are some subtleties about when the FileName changes.  For example, after vtkFileSeriesReader::RequestInformation finishes, the last RequestInformation called will be for the last file.  Typically you end up reading the first file first, so on that first call to RequestData vtkFooReader::RequestInformation will be called again for the first file.

ParaView?

(I'd fill out a feature request, but it seems so common in visualization

Berk,
Looking at the online help you listed, it says it is from ParaView 3.3, and it is at least pre 3.6, since the Animation Inspector is listed.  Would it be much work to get it brought up to date?  Is there a way of automating or semi-automating the process?

It's supported in VTK but ParaView never got around to exposing it.
Feel free to add a feature request so we can address it in near
future.

There is something wonky with whatever service you are using to post your files.  The first several times I tried accessing them, I just got some web pages with a bunch of advertisements in French (which I cannot read).  After several attempts, I finally got the files.

When I run the contour filter with the default isovalue for each input, I get roughly the same result.  The major difference is that normals are automatically generated for image inputs but not for unstructured grids.  Thus, the output for the unstructured grid resorts to flat shading, which makes it look like it has sharper edges even though the polygons are the same.  If you run the normals filter on the ugrid output (turning off splitting), you will see the result looks similar.  You can also try turning off the Compute Normals feature for the image input.  With the normals gone, you will see that the result is the same.

By default, the contour filter does not compute or pass scalar values for image data.  If you click on the Compute Scalars checkbox, you should see them again.  The contour filter always computes scalar values for unstructured grids.  I'm not sure why the two are different.

Hi,

While trying to check out Ken's instructions I accidentally choose a
wrong filter and may have come across a new bug in ParaView: load the
provided unstructured grid input.vtu and apply filter "Normal Glyphs".
Both ParaView 3.6.1 and 3.7.0 cvs build segfault (with 5, 50 and 5000
glyph max points). I couldn't find a bug report in Mantis about that.
File one?

you attach a debugger and post the stack trace?

Will do. For now, I can only tell that the WinXP 32bit build and the
Linux 32bit build of ParaView 3.6.1 crashed. The Linux 64bit build didn't.

Message-ID: <d8a796870909081543y30c62fc5h311ab15d8f8a4778@mail.gmail.com>

Just in case anyone else wants to do this... particularly if you wish to
compare the results of a matlab simulation to some data plotted in Paraview.


The matlab code below will write a xml file that can be imported into
Paraview.  You can either call it with no arguments (this will give the
default jet matlab colorspace) or you can call it with the name of another
colorspace.  Now we can all use the "pink" colorspace for our Paraview
plotting ;-)

function [] = paraview_color_space(scheme, N)
   if (exist('scheme') ~= 1), scheme='jet'; end
   colors = eval(scheme);
   N = length(colors);
   fid = fopen([scheme '.xml'], 'w');
   fprintf(fid, '<ColorMap name="%s" space="HSV">\n', scheme);
   for i=1:N
       x = [(i-1)/(N-1); colors(i,:)'];
       fprintf(fid, '  <Point x="%f" o="1" r="%f" g="%f" b="%f"/>\n', x);
   end
   fwrite(fid, '</ColorMap>');
   fclose(fid);
end

Actually, I believe there are 3 separate issues, but they are all  
important: MathML is horribly tedious to type in and GUI equation  
editors are frustratingly slow if you know LaTeX so please don't  
discount human interaction. The issues are:

1. Rendering of character glyphs other than 7-bit ASCII
2. Lay out and rendering of mathematical equations (and possibly other  
formatted text like tables)
3. Easy input of equations (and other text for fancy layout).

Also, Berk didn't say it, but at least in VTK you can now use a Qt  
renderer that will draw any Unicode string so #1 above is done but not  
taken advantage of in ParaView. However, this does have the  
disadvantage of requiring Qt on the server side since I believe labels  
are drawn by all the processes running pvserver.

	Just my 2 cents,
	David

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView on exotic platforms
Message-ID: <379CE1F1-C036-49D1-B999-59C3EAE6988C@sandia.gov>

Hi all,

I've been working to get ParaView (with Python turned ON) compiled on  
an HPC platform that doesn't support shared libraries. It almost  
works, but there is at least one little glitch that I don't see an  
easy fix for: during CMake configuration, ParaView creates a file named
   Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable/pvpythonmodules.h
which defines a routine that initializes all of the python modules  
ParaView requires. Unfortunately, this file is written by a macro  
defined in FindPythonLibs.cmake which uses a list of the modules and  
assumes that the function to initialize each one will be named
	'init' + PREFIX + moduleName + SUFFIX
This doesn't work for the mpi4py module because the build system has  
overridden the name of the dynamically-loaded module name. Instead of  
libMPIPython.so, it is simply MPIPython.so.

So far, I've manually edited the pvpythonmodules file but it would be  
nice to have a real solution committed. Should I
1. Un-override the non-standard library name when building static  
Python modules
2. Change PYTHON_ADD_MODULE and PYTHON_WRITE_MODULES_HEADER to keep a  
list of target names (and (a) how can I do this when the target name  
might be changed later in CMake parsing? (b) will VTK's  
FindPythonLibs.cmake always be used or might the version distributed  
with CMake also need to change?)
3. Do something else?

	Thanks,
	David

well, MathML basicly it feels like going to pre-historic times...

Can't an approch like the one on this plugin, used by Pidgin (a instant 
messenger program) to render LaTeX, work?

Subject: [Paraview] Strange parser
Message-ID: <BAY109-W5283EEB176265C3E33838FB2E90@phx.gbl>


I have written a new class, which I have compiled in a vtkLocal library, linked and tested with VTK without any problem.
Now I just change the CMakeLists.txt so as to compile for ParaView and several strange parsing error arise, such as:
  double a, b;
raises an error, while:
  double a;
  double b;
is ok!
Also this line raises an error and I do not see how to cope with this one:
  vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<double> > > grid;
Note that deleting "vtkstd::" does change anything.
Any help?

Hi,

just wanted to know if somebody tried and had success compiling  
ParaView on the new Snow Leopard OS X ?

 From my side, I have downloaded and compiled qt-4.6.0 / however, I  
forgot to compile it for cocoa which I will
do today. Next step will be to patch the paraview source code  
following our previous discussions for Cocoa.

Yes, you can do that, just ensure that you uncheck the "Interpolate
Scalars" checkbox. Keeping this checked (default) results in using a
texture when coloring with point data which is overriding the texture
you are applying.

Does Qt 4.5.2 not work under Snow Leopard? I would think under Snow  
Leopard you just need to add some more flags to the "configure"  
command since 10.6 is going to make 64 bit binaries by default you  
probably just need to add the "-arch i386 -arch x86_64" and the -cocoa  
flags to the Qt configure command.

  There are some issues with CMake under 10.6 but nothing that can not  
be worked around from what I can tell.

Hi Ken,

Sorry to persist, but I found a case that is not properly dealt with by
the class FileSeriesReader in cooperation with the reader you kindly
modified helping me out:

There are cases, though rare, where multiple files can contain identical
time step values. Think about a transient nonlinear solution process
where the linear solver exports its intermediate solutions to disk - all
files within one nonlinear step will contain the same time step value.
There are probably other cases as well.

By fixing bug 8892, you added (among others) these instructions to
Servers/Filters/vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx:

> int vtkFileSeriesReaderTimeRanges::GetAggregateTimeInfo([...]) 
> {
>   [...]
>   double timeRange[2];

>   timeRange[1] = (--this->RangeMap.end())->second
>                        ->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE())[1];

which lead to the situation that only the last file of a file series is
loaded by readers depending on class FileSeriesReader if the files
contain non-unique time step values. You can test it with the attached
reader plugin and the file series sampleinputfiles/sametimes*.foo.
You'll notice on STDOUT that only sametimes9.foo, the last file, is loaded.

I'd like to propose a patch that warns the user for such a file series
and falls back to fake time step values. I'm not sure about implications
for animation functions, though, I'm afraid. But having applied the
patch, one can step through sametimes*.foo as well.
(Actually, willing to support the same-time-step-values-in-all-files
case is the reason why I went through the trouble to have my own book
keeping in my reader.)

Hi,

The previously posted patch accidentally issued a warning for every file
series, even those that provided disjoint time steps. Fixed.

Message-ID: <SNT106-W8DB968B0B7FC401E24A3CABE80@phx.gbl>


 



Dear All,

 

i am doing parallel rendering using 4 machines. they all have a quite high end graphics hardware, however their Paraview is also configured with OSMesa enabled. During rendering, how do i know if they are using software rendering instead of hardware rendering? (since i have a quite high end graphics hardware, i would like to make good use of it). If i disabled OSMesa in ccmake, would it means that OSMesa is not in-use?

 

Any help / response is highly appreciated!

 

Regards,

chewping

Back in March 2009, I answered a question by another user
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011303.html),
asking how to override the default splitting of data chunks. By default,
structured volumes are split among all 3 main directions. My answer,
validated with version 3.4, was to tell the Extent Translator to use an
alternate SplitMode, like this:

vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline *exec =
static_cast<vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline*>(this->GetExecutive());
exec->GetExtentTranslator(outInfo)->SetSplitModeToXSlab();

I have verified today that the solution works well, producing the
required split, either as X, Y or Z slabs.

My problem is that I cannot reproduce this in version 3.6.1. When the
same data reader source code is compiled against version 3.6, my request
to SetSplitModeTo?Slab() are ignored all the times. I am using the same
grid resolution and the same number of processes. What works in version
3.4 cannot be reproduced in version 3.6.

Has anyone seen this too?

If anyone wonders, it does matter greatly. Reading HDF5 hyperslabs can
be 10 times faster in one direction or the other. That is what I need to
support.

Unless it has changed recently, by default, you should be able to plug  
in a display and see a render window rendering 1/4 ish of the image

I compiled a working ParaView on Snow Leopard using Qt 4.5.2 (Carbon,
which is the default configuration). I had to set -m32 (-arch i386
should also work) for CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS since the
latest Xcode builds 64 bit by default. There are some glitches in
combo boxes but it works fine otherwise.

I also built 64 bit with Qt 4.5.2 (Cocoa) but I had to apply some
patches that were posted on this list before. Once I make sure that
the patches work with Cocoa and Carbon, I will commit them.

If anyone tried the Qt 4.6 preview, please let us know. Qt 4.5.3 is
going to have Snow Leopard support also.

I've started by trying to create a new representation.  I thought I would be
able to inherit from vtkPainterPolyDataMapper and just implement my own
SetInput method but it never gets called.  My new representation is being
initialised and if I implement RenderPiece it gets used.  The problem with
doing the transform in RenderPiece is that it changes the bounds have
changed and so the view is not right.  Am I doing the right thing here or
should I just inherit from vtkMapper and implement everything?

Thanks,
Paul

I'd recommend inserting the transform filter before the mapper while
creating the pipeline in the representation, rather than changing the
mapper. Alternatively, you'll have to override GetBounds() as well to
report correct bounds.

Thanks for your comments !

Yesterday I have compiled QT 4.6 with cocoa and arch x86_64 using gcc  
4.2 / no problem, no patch needed.

After, I patched my 2-3 month old ParaView 3.7.0 source, I compiled it  
with this QT version and
cmake 2.6.4. and it worked. The patch that I applied is basically what  
Mike was proposing
couple months ago. However, the make install did not provide a  
functional application but
I can run ParaView from the build directory.

You probably have some sort of polyhedra that is getting converted to
VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET.

I found the full declaration of the cell types in vtkCellTypes.h and came to
that conclusion. However, I'm not too clear on how ParaView handle's these
cell types, but I can worry about that another time. It would be nice to
have an option in Save Data to output all cell types equal to
VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET as tetrahedrals, or a filter for identifying and
isolating these specific cells and tetrahedralising them. My workaround for
today involved tertrahedralising the whole mesh, which increased its size
7-fold so not the most practical option.

Triangulating only cells of type VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET is actually more difficult than it sounds.  All non-triangular faces will be split into triangles.  If there is any neighbor cells that share these faces, they will also have to be split in some way to keep the interfaces consistent.  The splitting can then easily propagate to the neighbors' neighbors and so on.

Nope. A property is unidirectional. You can either push (default) or
pull (information-only properties) parameter values.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with custom time-aware reader
In-Reply-To: <4AA7BFC9.7050208@web.de>
Message-ID: <C6CEDD64.CEDB%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Actually, we designed the file series reader with the understanding that time ranges might overlap, but with a different use case in mind.  Our users often have to run simulations far past the mean time to failure of the platforms they are running on.  To handle the problem of the inevitable crash of the system, the simulation periodically writes out checkpoint files.  When the system fails, the simulation is "backed back" to the last checkpoint and restarted.  As the simulation reruns from this point, it will recompute some time steps and rewrite out the data for those times.  The file series reader understands that these time steps are duplicated and picks the one most likely to be correct.

So the problem is that your case excludes this case.  If the file series reader declared an error whenever it encountered multiple versions of the same time, it would not be reading in the restarted simulation data correctly.  The problem is, your case does not really represent an actual time series in the physical sense.  I can see the utility of looking at the intermediate solutions, but these intermediate solutions are not a real progression of events in a physical sense.  It is by removing the intermediate results that you get a progression of actual physical events.  In fact, I can see utility in viewing the data in either way.

So instead, I suggest some workarounds.  First, your reader might be able to sense which iterative intermediate result it is reading and then add some delta to the time to make the file series reader recognize them as different times.  This is probably the most hack-ish, as, again, these intermediate results do not really represent a time series (even if you want them animated as such).  Second, you could have a flag in your reader to ignore time.  If your reader does not set the time keys, the file series reader will treat the files as an ordinary sequence.  Third, you (or I) could add a flag to the file series reader that would force it to ignore the time in the reader.  This flag would be hidden for most readers, but could be exposed for your reader.

Hi Ken,

the class FileSeriesReader in cooperation with the reader you kindly

There are cases, though rare, where multiple files can contain identical

where the linear solver exports its intermediate solutions to disk - all
files within one nonlinear step will contain the same time step value.
There are probably other cases as well.

By fixing bug 8892, you added (among others) these instructions to
Servers/Filters/vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx:

which lead to the situation that only the last file of a file series is
loaded by readers depending on class FileSeriesReader if the files
contain non-unique time step values. You can test it with the attached
reader plugin and the file series sampleinputfiles/sametimes*.foo.
You'll notice on STDOUT that only sametimes9.foo, the last file, is loaded.

I'd like to propose a patch that warns the user for such a file series
and falls back to fake time step values. I'm not sure about implications
for animation functions, though, I'm afraid. But having applied the
patch, one can step through sametimes*.foo as well.
(Actually, willing to support the same-time-step-values-in-all-files
case is the reason why I went through the trouble to have my own book
keeping in my reader.)

I use Paraview on Windows.I want to render a vtk object on the Paraview gui,not the vtk window.
I don't konw if the servermanager can do it.Just like below:

plato = vtkPlatonicSolodSource()
plate.SetSolidType(3)

what should I do next to add the plato on the pipeline browser,and render it ?

Hi Karl,

We had a similar pb to yours : our times are not 1D, but 2D in the sense 
that each physical time can be associated to one or several iterations.
What I did was to provide a TimeMode parameter : 
If the TimeMode is set the PhysicalTime (the default), then the reader 
exposes the available physical times in the request Information pass, and 
always provides the last iteration available when requested a given time.
When the time mode is set to Iteration, the user also has to provide the 
physical time he want to look at, and then the reader exposes the 
available iterations for this given physical time in the information pass, 
and outputs the good iteration when asked for.

Just to share ideas...

Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with custom time-aware reader

Hi Ken and St?phane,

I see your point about ignoring duplicate times in a file series in case
of overlapping restarted simulations. I actually know that condition
very well and usually resort to manually deleting the duplicate output
files. Admittedly, that is possible for a file format with one time step
per file (and very easy to realise in case it is (compressed) ASCII
format), but ParaView supports other cases as well (e.g. ExodusII file
format). I didn't have that use case in mind and you're right, my
suggested patch would interfere with it.

I had thought about the hack-ish solution you suggested earlier, but to
be on the safe side I'd have to inspect to complete file series first,
before being able to choose a safe delta depending on the size of time
steps found. Not willing to duplicate the class FileSeriesReader any
more (or misusing it like I did in my initial posting and using my own
file name book keeping to choose the correct file name in RequestData
depending on the time value given), but relying on it to call my
reader's RequestInformation for all files by now, I'd have to tell
FileSeriesReader after having read all files to re-adjust time steps.
But there are two problem with that approach: a) How to detect the last
file of a series from within my reader? I'd have to patch
FileSeriesReader for that, because such information is not passed up to
now as far as I can tell. b) How to manipulate the variable Internal (of
structure vtkFileSeriesReaderInternals) being private in
FileSeriesReader from within my reader without the need to reread the
file series?

The second suggestion is not really an option as I'd like to support
both cases: proper disjoint time steps and the case where all time step
values are identical. The patch I suggested actually does more than I
need. One could limit it to the case that all files contain the same
time step instead of checking more generally whether there are more
files than time steps.

The third suggestion, a flag in your reader to ignore time, is
interesting. With a bit of extra XML like
     <IntVectorProperty name="Ignore time values"
            command="SetFoo"
            number_of_elements="1"
            animateable="0"
            default_values="0">
       <BooleanDomain name="bool"/> // GUI object type: Check box
       <Documentation>
         Toggle whether to respect the time step values found in files.
         If checked, make sure that time step values are disjoint.
         Otherwise it will not be possible to step through all files,
         but be limited to last files of every series subset with
         identical time step values.
       </Documentation>
     </IntVectorProperty>
I could add a check box to the GUI, but by the time the check box is
displayed, RequestInformation has been called already and enabling the
check box such that stored time steps are ignored would mean facing the
problem b) again: Either trigger a costly reread of the complete file
series and instruct my reader to not report time step values this time
or patch FileSeriesReader to somehow be able to manipulate the variable
Internal from within my reader after having read all files.
It would be desirable to be able to make the choice before
RequestInformation is called. But from a recent discussion
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013524.html)
I learned that making choices beforehand is not possible.

I find Stephane's email very interesting: how did you realise your
TimeMode={PhysicalTime,Iteration} setting? You do not rely on
FileSeriesReader, do you? Did you clone it and integrate it into your
reader? Such that you have full control over the mapping file name <=>
time steps from within your reader?

Hi,

find attached an xml that exposes the vtkPlatonicSolidSource in the paraview
sources menu. Load it from the tools->"Manage plugins" menu. At least it
will allow you to create a platonic solid in paraview GUI. But I don't
understand why you want to ask for it in C++.
Maybe you want a plugin (autostart or toolbar) to do that ? If yes, take a
look at the object builder :
   pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
   pqObjectBuilder* builder = core->getObjectBuilder();

Thanks a lot!  I am so glad that someone pointd out what my next step to learn about Paraview.

 Actually the code I type is Python,not c++

plato = vtkPlatonicSolodSource()
plate.SetSolidType(3)

I use the Paraview Client-Server mode ,and want to do some parallel computing.The Server is Linux cluster,and The client is Windows.
I want to know if I can just use  python script on client to manager the server how to parallel computing.I means if I can use the client 
python script to import MPI function ,and then let the servar do parallel jobs.I have installed the paraview enable MPI on Server.If 
the client python script could not  fulfill that job.Should I write a plugin on Server use C++,and then in there I use the MPI? 
Sorry for my ugly English .May you have a good day!

From current core instance's object builder, you will be able to create servers, sources, filters,...

I use Paraview on Windows.I want to render a vtk object on the Paraview gui,not the vtk window.
I don't konw if the servermanager can do it.Just like below:

plato = vtkPlatonicSolodSource()
plate.SetSolidType(3)

what should I do next to add the plato on the pipeline browser,and render it ?

Oops, shame on me ! I didn't recognize python code... I only use standalone
paraview, I am not aware on parallel computing and MPI stuff. But I am sure
you can! I know that you can add sources and filters from python script, you
got it, thanks to servermanager. You will need the XML I gave, and register
the source proxy to servever manager. The paraview guide describes that very
well.

Sorry again !

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0909110835m19200568x804dc65e3bb1382@mail.gmail.com>

If open this file in Paraview:
http://rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/coordinate_axes.vtp, in the "Display"
tab of the Object Inspector, change "Color by: " to "Colors", then uncheck
"Map Scalars", the axes are red, yellow, and green, as expected. However, if
I apply a transform filter to this, the "Colors" array seems to still be
there, but I cannot uncheck "Map Scalars" (it is grayed out) so the colors
are displayed incorrectly. Why would this be?

Thanks,

I am not sure why, but the transform filter converts the "Colors"
array from unsigned-char to float. And hence, map-scalars is no longer
available.

Hi,

As David pointed out, the library for MPIPython is named in a
non-standard way due to this line:

  SET_PROPERTY(TARGET MPIPython PROPERTY PREFIX "")

Then we have Utilities/mpi4py/mpi4py/MPI.py which contains the single line:

  from MPIPython import *

To conform with all of our other module files, it could be changed to
look something like this:

import os
if os.name == "posix":
    from libMPIPython import *
else:
    from MPIPython import *

If there is no great reason to use the name MPIPython.so instead of
libMPIPython.so, I think we remove the cmake code for the non-standard
name.  I'll do this later today unless I hear noise...

I think Nikhil forced that name since the mpi4py internals expected
that name (Berk should know the details) for the library. So merely
changing the library name will break mpi4py. May be an easier thing
would be an option to build ParaView wihtout mpi4py. It's not a
critical component of ParaView or paraview-python in any case.

So this essentially breaks the coloring right? The colors now appear as
shades between blue and red - there is no way to tell Paraview to use float
[0,1] RGB coloring? Is the course of action from here to ask the VTK
developers why this happens and if it can be specified/changed?

Thanks,

David

Does it work then to disable PYTHON_ENABLE_MODULE_MPIPython?

Hi David,

You can use a Programmable Filter to convert the data back to unsigned char to
work around the problem for now:

---
inp = self.GetInput()
out = self.GetOutput()

numCells  = inp.GetNumberOfCells()
data = inp.GetCellData().GetArray("Colors")

newData = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
newData.SetName('Colors_converted')
newData.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
for i in range(0, 3*numCells, 3):
  val1 = int(data.GetValue(i))
  val2 = int(data.GetValue(i+1))
  val3 = int(data.GetValue(i+2))
  newData.InsertNextValue(val1)
  newData.InsertNextValue(val2)
  newData.InsertNextValue(val3)
out.GetCellData().AddArray(newData)
---

Actually, the loop got accidentally more complicated than necessary:

---
inp = self.GetInput()
out = self.GetOutput()

numCells  = inp.GetNumberOfCells()
data = inp.GetCellData().GetArray("Colors")

newData = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
newData.SetName('Colors_converted')
newData.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
for i in range(0, 3*numCells):
  val = int(data.GetValue(i))
  newData.InsertNextValue(val)
out.GetCellData().AddArray(newData)
---

Kinda. In Utilities/mpi4py/Library/CMakeLists.txt you must
disable building the plugin entirely by putting PYTHON_ADD_MODULE
and everything below it into an IF()...ENDIF() block when static builds
are turned on because
1. Right now MPIPython's PYTHON_ADD_MODULE explicitly specifies
    the MODULE keyword (I had to remove it to build a static library) and
2. Even taking care of the above, if you turn off
    PYTHON_ENABLE_MODULE_MPIPython, you'll get CMake errors
    because further CMake commands ignore the setting and refer to
    the target which is not present when the CMake option is OFF.

So, what do I lose by turning off mpi4py? Does anything use it, or is
it just there for people who want to write custom python filters that are
parallel?

    Thanks,
    David

Sven,

Thanks, that works perfectly! I'll email vtk-devel asking why this happens.

It's one alternative. I don't think the 3 tasks I outlined exclude it.  
However it does require you to have LaTeX installed on your system.

Subject: [Paraview] How to get data from desired time step
Message-ID: <4AAB5FD7.70804@yandex.ru>

Hello.
I have time series of VTU files with the coordinates of spheres and radii.
I heed calculate the velocity of these spheres from ProgrammableFiler.
So, I need data from the previous time step.

I get current time step as follow:


ind=self.GetInput()

iin=ind.GetInformation()

curTimeStep=iin.Get(ind.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)


Now, how can I get spheres coordinates from curTimeStep-1?

Best regards, Sergei D.

Hi,

I'm not sure if this has been reported/logged. This bug is easy to 
reproduce. Here's how to:

1. Open a new Paraview scene, and set the background color (to white for 
example)

2. Import or create a VTK object

3. Export screenshot with the screen or print palette.

Result: the Paraview background color is reset to the default value.

I would rather think that one that would use the feature would have LaTeX 
in it's machine (statisticly speaking, at least...)

Hi all,

I still have issues on the same topic :-/

If I use a Threshold filter, I get smooth surface. Good.

If I use a Clip filter, I don't get the same smooth surface. Pas glop.

However, both filter output is an UnstructuredGrid.

Contour & GenerateSurfaceNormals filters have both same parameters set.

How can I get nicer (smoother) surface with Clip filter?

TIA.

Cheers,

Hi!

I have downloaded the plugin example form the site http://public.kitware.com/Wiki/Plugin_Examples .
I built it to  libEdgeFaceElements.so,and loaded it on paraview.
I can only find the Edge+Face Element Filed Sampler on Filter menu the Alphabetical catalog.
There are no Edge/Face element reader .Dose any body get the same proble with me?
That's weird.Should I change the EdgeFaceElementsServerManager.xml or something?

I think that UTF-8 support is the low hanging fruit, since you are getting
all the i18n characters which QT already supports.  Beyond superscripts and
subscripts, typesetting is a much larger effort, and is best handled by
external tools by post processing the images.

Subject: [Paraview] A simple legacy VTK File
Message-ID: <b3fac2c10909131346s54af4595ted7399e42930adff@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.

I am trying to display a simple tetrahedral unstructured grid using
Paraview. Strangely, Paraview ignores a point of the grid which is both
defined in the POINTS section and used as a vertex by all the
tetrahedra/cells.

Attached, you will find the vtk file that Paraview fails to display
correctly.

This file contains 9 points: the 8 vertices of a cube plus the cube's center
point (1.5, 1.5, 1,5) which has a vtkIdType equal to 8 (see the file). Also,
all the cells in the file are connected to the vtkIdType 8. When I load this
file with Paraview, the cube's center (the point with vtkIdType equal to 8)
is missing.

Can anybody know what's happening? Isn't the file correct?


Regards,
Panagiotis

It's not missing for me.  I loaded the file, selected one of the cells and
then used the extract selection filter.  I attached a picture of the result
I got which shows the "middle" point.  Also, when I look under the
information tab I see 9 total points there as well.

How are you expecting the point to appear?  What version of ParaView are you
using?

Thanks for your prompt reply. I followed your instructions and everything is
fine.

I thought that if I used the Wireframe display mode, I would be able to see
all the cells together with their points (and not only the exterior facets).
Also, I thought that the Points display mode would give all the points of
the grid (and not only the exterior points). Apparently I am not familiar
with Paraview.

So my question now becomes: Is there a way to display all the cells/points
(exterior or not) of the grid, without having to isolate each cell of
interest?

Regards,
Panagiotis

Load the CSCS Point Sprite Plugin and choose Representation: Point
Sprite. It'll show all 9 points. (You might need to compile ParaView
yourself from source in order to be able to use the plugin.)

Hi Panagiotis,

Try applying the Extract Edges filter.  This will extract and render
all the edges of the unstructured grid instead of just the exterior
surface.  The output will be a polygonal mesh, not unstructured grid.

As per my understanding (Berk can correct me if I am wrong) you're
correct: mpi4py can be used by python-programmable filters to
communicate amongst the processes.

Hello,
I did not receive any answer to this problem and I still have to fight against it, particularly with the use of STL objects.
I suspect there is a solution to use the STL and make it parsed succesfully.
Please help!

Subject: [Paraview] Strange parser








I have written a new class, which I have compiled in a vtkLocal library, linked and tested with VTK without any problem.
Now I just change the CMakeLists.txt so as to compile for ParaView and several strange parsing error arise, such as:
  double a, b;
raises an error, while:
  double a;
  double b;
is ok!
Also this line raises an error and I do not see how to cope with this one:
  vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<double> > > grid;
Note that deleting "vtkstd::" does change anything.
Any help?

 resulting vtkImageData set
Message-ID: <BAY109-W357FAB46DC2B62ED380A8FB2E40@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I have a 3D vector field, which I slice and then apply SurfaceVectors.
I would like to generate an ImageData set (regular grid with vectors as point data).
But I do not find the right tools:
  - I can reinterpolate the slice by a plane, but it yields a PolyDataSet, which is not a vtkImageData set,
  - I can create an ImageData set with the Data Object Generator and then reinterpolate the slice with it but unfortunately the Data Object Generator only creates basic 1x1x1 cubes, and can not be parameterized.
Any idea?

I regularly use paraview in the parallel mode with success.

I changed the time precision and each of the three data sets separately 
works correctly.

When I use all three in the same file I get a wire figure (like the 
matrix symbol) on the screen whether the PV files are 32 or 64 bit.
Has anyone experienced a similar problem?

Update:
This bug is affects more than just the background color. It also resets 
the wireframe color of a geometric object. Here's how to reproduce it:

1. create an object e.g. sphere primitive

2. set its representation to wireframe, and color to red (or any color 
other than the default)

3. set background to white

4. save screenshot with print palette

Result: the mesh and background are reset to their default colors. In 
addition, the wireframe color of object in the screenshot is black.

Note: this issue affects only objects with wireframe representations in 
a scene. Objects with surface or surface with edges representations in 
the same scene are unaffected, even though the background color is reset.

PVD file does not support "time" attribute, only "timestep" which has

Dear list,


sorry for the long posting to come, but I'd like to introduce to all of
you the result of a MSc. thesis performed here at KTH by Markus
Ringlander, the result is a:

		FASTLIC ALGORITHM CODED IN C++/VTK 
	(... with the goal to be included in ParaView as a filter.)

As opposed to the LEA implementation by Jean Favre, this program can
deal with unstructured (ultimately: triangles), 3D surfaces. For more
details, see:

http://www.ave.kth.se/staff/aero/crippa/lic.html

As of today, the program can't be incorporated in ParaView, due to a
missing texture mapping actor, see:

http://www.ave.kth.se/staff/aero/crippa/lic.html#remaining_issues

Is there somebody at Kitware, or elsewhere that has spent a thought on
how to get this actor into ParaView? 

Just to point out that I/we are not the only ones interested in having
LIC in ParaView, I searched the vtkusers/paraview mailing lists and
found a hit as far back as Dec. 2000 ... where Berk said something about
incorporating LIC implementations made available to him :-) (see below)

Well ... here's our shot:

[vtkusers]/[Paraview]

Markus Ringlander; Sat May 27 20:19:15 EDT 2006

Hi vtk-users,

I will do my MSc thesis in scientific visualization, and specifically
the task is to do Line Integral Convolution (LIC) on unstructured
surface grids in 3D. I am supposed to use VTK for this task. After
having studied the online documentation for VTK, and done searches on
this mailing list, I have a few wonderings I hope someone can shed a
light on. Let me try to explain them.

The basic technique I will use for this 3D surface LIC is to generate
a texture for each polygon in the grid. I have seen examples on a few
texture mappings, where one can assign texture coordinates to vertices
of the polygons building up the grid. In the end one uses
actor-SetTexture(...). But all examples I have seen refer to one
sample image/texture as source.

In my case, I am going to traverse the elements in the grid, and
generate a 2D texture/image for each element. So I will have many
separate textures.

A bit simplified, I was thinking something like this:

1) Read my unstructured grid from a file.
2) Iterate through each polygon in the grid.
3) For each polygon in the iteration, perform the LIC algorithm on it,
which here gives a texture as output for each polygon.
4) Map texture coordinates from this specific image/texture to the
corresponding real world polygon.
5) Back to 3)
6) Output the whole textured grid on the screen.

As I stated earlier, I have only seen examples of a single actor for
texturing, refering to a single image/texture file. In my case I am
wondering if I need to set up an actor for each texture I create? It
can then be over 10,000 textures...

Please help me with some information wheather this is doable in VTK,
and if so, any helpful code snippet for the assignment of the textures
to each polygon.

Thanks!

/Mark

We have an implementation of the Lagrangian Eulerian Advection algorithm 
published at IEEE Vis 2001. It produces LIC images for steady fields and 
time-dependent LIC-like textures with spatial and temporal continuity 
for un-steady fields.

Source code, Makefile and test routines are provided for VTK and ParaView.

This is a texture-based technique for effectively displaying 2D and 3D
vector fields.

Has anyone managed to implement this type of filter in vtk ?

As it is to be used  in VR-applications, the focus  is not so much on
accuracy but rather on efficiency to maintain interactivity. 

Thanks very much in advance for any help,
Thomas Brandner

LIC, FLIC and spot noise are in my to-do list. I don't know when I can
get to them though. If someone has implementations, I will be happy to
incorporate them to vtk.

Actually, timestep does support floating point values.  If you just change the "time" parameters to "timestep", it should work.

Yes. We have GPU-based LIC implementation in VTKEdge that we will be
moving to VTK and ParaView in the near future.

You should use the LIC implementation provided in VTKEdge (which will
move to VTK shortly). It is unlikely that the FastLIC implementation
you are referring to is going to be part of VTK due to several reason:
it is not complete, it is not maintained, it does not work in parallel
and it has a GPL license.

I have implemented a NetCDF4 reader plugin under MacOSX.  When the client plugin is loaded into the paraview client it appears in  the "local plugins" list of the "Plugin Manager" with an "Error" property.   Is there any way to obtain some feedback on what error is being registered?

If you expand the plugin, the "status" property should have some

Yes, it says that my dylib is not a valid Qt plugin, and then it says that the QtChart lib was not loaded.   Perhaps some library incompatibilities?

Thanks,

Did you compile the plugin with 3.6 by any chance and you trying to
load it in a CVS build of ParaView? QtChart library is no longer
available in CVS since it has been replaced by vtkQtChart.

Not sure about the first problem you mention.

About the second, is that stl code in a header file? If so, put it in
between //BTX and //ETX. That will tell the wrappers (in this case the
client server wrapper), to ignore it.

We have an implementation of the Lagrangian Eulerian Advection algorithm 
published at IEEE Vis 2001. It produces LIC images for steady fields and 
time-dependent LIC-like textures with spatial and temporal continuity 
for un-steady fields.

Source code, Makefile and test routines are provided for VTK and ParaView.

Thomas Brandner; Sun Jan 9 05:53:52 EST 2000

Dear  vtk users,

I`m currently working on a study project about line integral convolution
(LIC). 
This is a texture-based technique for effectively displaying 2D and 3D
vector fields.

Has anyone managed to implement this type of filter in vtk ?

As it is to be used  in VR-applications, the focus  is not so much on
accuracy but rather on efficiency to maintain interactivity. 

Thanks very much in advance for any help,
Thomas Brandner

==========================================================================

And as far back as Mon Dec 11 10:16:19 EST 2000, Berk said:

LIC, FLIC and spot noise are in my to-do list. I don't know when I can
get to them though. If someone has implementations, I will be happy to
incorporate them to vtk.

Subject: [Paraview] problems getting ParaView to use my reader plugin
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0909150125r11733af9w2f58b1e18be65731@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am having some basic problems getting Paraview to use my simple reader
plugin. After loading the two plugins (one  for the server side and one for
the client side) in my GUI, if I try to open a new file with my new
extension (txt or txts) it neither recognizes the extension, nor displays my
new reader as a choice among the selection of possible readers for
unrecognized extensions.

I followed the process for writing a reader plugin  in chapter 19.4 of the
Paraview guide, creating the files TxtReader.qrc, TxtReaderGUI.xml, and
TxtReaderSM.xml along with the code vtkTxtReader.cxx and vtkTxtReader.h
(which are identical to vtkSimplePointsReader with the only the class name
changed). The both client and server side build without problems. I then
load both the server side plugin and the client side plugin, in that order,
in my Paraview GUI, which also goes without problems or errors. But after
all this neither my new file extension nor my new reader are displayed when
I go to open a sample .txt file.

Any ideas how to debug? Below I have included my .qrc, .xml, and
CMakeLists.txt files

Thanks,
Christine

I don't think you need the qrc file - try this instead for your GUI plugin

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(TxtReaderGUIPlugin "1.0"
    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES TxtReaderGUI.xml)

Hi,

concerning LIC and VTK, you might find this useful:

http://www.ave.kth.se/divisions/aero/software/lic/lic.html

If you are interested in Markus' Master Thesis, I think you should be
able to fetch it from the KTH library or the AVE institute library (POC,
Ingela Hallonblad). Otherwise I might have a digital copy around ... but
I would have to search through my KTH stuff to find it.

I believe that is another possible solution but I haven't tried it.

 I fixed my problem by adding 'prefix="/ParaViewResources" ' when specifying
the qresource thanks to the help of another poster:   <qresource
prefix="/ParaViewResources" > I had previously inadvertently removed this
specification from my code.

But on that topic, when would I need the Qt resource file vs. when can I
avoid it? The Paraview guide which I am following has the structure of two
xml files, one for the server and one for the client and the qrc file for
the client.

Thanks

I do know this work and I have installed it, it works well but requires a vtkImageData set as input, which does not meet my own requirements since I would like to apply it to a slice, ie a vtkPolyData set.
I will look at vtkEdge and eventually consider writing a LIC filter able to process any data set.
Best regards

We have an implementation of the Lagrangian Eulerian Advection algorithm 
published at IEEE Vis 2001. It produces LIC images for steady fields and 
time-dependent LIC-like textures with spatial and temporal continuity 
for un-steady fields.

Source code, Makefile and test routines are provided for VTK and ParaView.

Thomas Brandner; Sun Jan 9 05:53:52 EST 2000

Dear  vtk users,

I`m currently working on a study project about line integral convolution
(LIC). 
This is a texture-based technique for effectively displaying 2D and 3D
vector fields.

Has anyone managed to implement this type of filter in vtk ?

As it is to be used  in VR-applications, the focus  is not so much on
accuracy but rather on efficiency to maintain interactivity. 

Thanks very much in advance for any help,
Thomas Brandner

==========================================================================

And as far back as Mon Dec 11 10:16:19 EST 2000, Berk said:

LIC, FLIC and spot noise are in my to-do list. I don't know when I can
get to them though. If someone has implementations, I will be happy to
incorporate them to vtk.

That's where VTKEdge has the 'edge' :). VTKEdge includes surface-LIC
support so you can show LIC textures on arbitrary slices/surfaces.

Refer to the following Kitware Source edition for an overview of
VTKEdge's LIC capabilites.

Since 3.4, the qrc file is not needed unless you are adding qt
resources such as icons etc. to use in your custom code. The
ServerManager xml is almost always need when adding a new
filter/reader etc. The client-xml is only needed when adding readers,
writers or configuring where a new filter shows  up in the filters
menu.

You might also want to refer to the plugin wiki page (
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo ).

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF reader and pvpython
Message-ID: <c9adba420909150717w2f88bfa0ya8300eba24dc32dc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am running the same commands in the Python Shell as with pvpython but
getting different results:

*Commands
*from paraview.simple import *
input = XDMFReader( FileName=/path/to/xdmf/file )
input.UpdatePipeline()
print input.PointData.GetNumberOfArrays()

When executed in the Python Shell I get the correct number of arrays but the
with pvpython it will return 0.

Am I doing anything wrong?

Thanks,
Paul

Thanks.
Actually I did not realize that there was some extending library available, the VTK documentation of vtkEdge being very small and the plugin in ParaView being about to be empty.
I will install Edge ASAP.

Try changing that to 'XDMFReader2'.

I don't have that one available in pvpython.  Do I need to enable it
somehow?

Ok, I tried again with the original XDMFReader.  It seems that if I
set the GridName property then it works-

r = XDMFReader(FileName='/source/paraview/ParaViewData/Data/Test1.xmf')
r.GridName = "Unnamed"

You might also want to set the PointArrays property... I'm not very
familiar with the xdmf reader.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0909150955w13ddd7edte32acfb3da690b3b@mail.gmail.com>

I am running Fedora 11. I have the "Command Line: Mini-Commander" item in my
panel. If I type 'paraview' and hit enter. Paraview launches, but most of
the time it will lock up after a few minutes of use. If I run 'paraview&'
from a terminal, there are never any problems. Has anyone seen anything like
this / does this make sense to anyone? I thought these two methods are doing
identically the same thing?

Thanks,

David

Paul,

The XdmfReader version is to be deprecated soon. It is being replaced
in the CVS with XdmfReader2 (which will eventually become XdmfReader).
The new reader is still under development so there may still be some
kinks in it that need to ironed out.

Message-ID: <C6D53137.D083%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I have installed on my Mac the 3.6.1 binary distribution of ParaView.  I have discovered that when I open the Python shell (Tools -> Python Shell) and then attempt to use the help function in it, lots of things are missing from the result.  For example, if I type

sphere = Sphere()
help(sphere)

I get the following useless information:

Help on Sphere: <paraview.servermanager.Sphere object>

However, if I type the same thing in a build I have made myself, I get quite a bit of documentation about the Sphere class and its attributes.  Does anyone else see this?

Message-ID: <527BAD65-54FA-4E43-9B1F-48151D237C18@sandia.gov>

Hi all,

This is a friendly neighborhood feature announcement: there's now a  
new ParaView plugin (in the Plugins/Statistics directory) that  
presents the statistics algorithms recently added to VTK as part of  
the ParaView UI. You can
- compute descriptive statistics (mean, variance, min, max, skewness,  
kurtosis),
- compute contingency tables,
- perform k-means analysis,
- examine correlations between arrays, and
- perform principal component analysis on arrays.

Some more details on the plugin are at
   http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Statistical_analysis

Please let me know if you have any problems.

	David

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF bug since paraview 3.6.1
Message-ID: <4AB0A19A.7020102@gmx.de>

Hi,

I use XDMF since a year with paraview 3.4.x.
But since 3.6.1 (precompiled version for linux) loading attributes from
hdf5-hyperslab fails :(

I attached a test-case with xmf- and h5-file.

The following part of my XDMF-file makes trouble since paraview 3.6.1

<Attribute Active="1" Type="Scalar" Center="Node" Name="data2D">
  <DataItem
         ItemType="HyperSlab"
         Dimensions="1   64   64"
         Type="HyperSlab">
     <DataItem
             Dimensions="3 3"
             Format="XML">
                 0    0    0
                 1    1    1
                 1   64   64
     </DataItem>
     <DataItem
             ItemType="Uniform"
             Format="HDF"
             NumberType="Float"
             Precision=" 8"
             Dimensions="1   64   64">
                  test_xmf.h5:/data2D
     </DataItem>
  </DataItem>
</Attribute>

I would be happy about any ideas, help, patches...

Greetings
Jens

Message-ID: <200909161340.31065.bart.janssens@rma.ac.be>

Hi,

CellBoundary in vtkConvexPointSet apparently does not return the closest 
boundary face, causing probing to fail sometimes near ConvexPointSet cells in 
unstructured grids. The related bug report with a proposed patch is at:
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9550

I believe the issue reported in this thread may be related:

When you check out the cvs Paraview, does it also get the cvs VTK? Or is it
a fixed version of VTK that Paraview assumes until the next release?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] PV and the STL: memory allocation issue
Message-ID: <BAY109-W13E57EA1468A1AF4B34E7BB2E20@phx.gbl>


I use the STL through vtkstd:

  vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<double> > > grid;
  [...]
  this->grid.clear();
  this->grid = vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<double> > >(this->grid_xsize*this->grid_ysize);

It works well on VTK but on PV I can this error at run time:

  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc

If I change the initialization line by:

  this->grid.resize(this->grid_xsize*this->grid_ysize);

I get another message:

  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  vector::_M_fill_insert

which means that the memory allocation by the vtkstl library crashes.
Does anybody know about this issue?

Hi,

May I ask once again?

Silly question?

Did not catch something obvious?

Need more information (VTK file and so on)?

I only want surface as smooth as possible with Clip filter...

Subject: [Paraview] problem getting pvserver to load plugin;
	possible connected error 	message
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0909170120i67d6887ft981a16929eaed9d7@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a plugin which functions on my client machine (when the GUI
is run on the client) as well as on my server machine (when the GUI is run
on the server machine), but not if I run the GUI on the client and connect
to the server machine running pvserver (I am currently for the exercise
running a single instance, nothing fancy). I have the PV_PLUGIN_PATH
environment variable in my .bash_profile set correctly to point to the
directory which contains my plugin on the server, as is evinced by the fact
that when I run the GUI on the server machine it automatically loads my
plugin.

On the client, if I go to manage plugins while connected to the server,
there is a small green/greyed out dot displayed on the remote plugin side,
along with the text "Not Loaded". All other fields on the remote plugin side
are empty. The local plugin side continues to display something to the
effect of "Loaded but must be loaded on server". If I try to manually load
the server plugin remotely from the client GUI, it displays and error box,
which is completely empty except for the "OK" button, and the following text
on the client and server sides, respectively:

Client error:
ERROR: In /BUILD/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkClientConnection.cxx, line 414
vtkClientConnection (0x1a20700): Could not create information object.

Server error:
ERROR: In
/Users/noname1/Documents/Research/Projects/viz/Paraview/ParaView-3.7/ParaView-3.7_src/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx,
line 345
vtkServerConnection (0x15949e70): Server failed to gather information.

As a side note, since setting up my ParaView server, when I connect with my
client I get these error messages at the startup, but it hasn't in any way
thusfar effected my ability to load, analyze and render on the server so I
assumed they were innocuous; now it seems they may not be. Has anyone seen
these errors before or run into similar problems setting up pvserver with
plugins?

Thanks,
Christine

In all likelihood, the allocation is failing because the process is
unable to allocate the memory you ask it to. I am not surprised that
this  happens in ParaView not in VTK because ParaView tends to
allocate a fair number of small objects probably segmenting the memory
somewhat. Did you try a 64 bit ParaView?

I think you are out of luck here. The clip filter uses a different
algorithm than cut/contour because it needs to break cells into tets
to create a bounded volume (instead of producing triangles). This
algorithm creates the artifacts that you are seeing. This is on our
list of things to fix but it is not a straightforward fix.

After you get the error message when you try to load the plugin on the
remote side, has the server disconnected/crashed or something on those
lines?

No, no crash, and I can still use the connection as normal. Only I am unable
to load the plugin.

Are you running this through a debugger?  And, is that the line that it is
failing on?  Finally, can you post the PV code that is failing?

Yes this is exactly the line of code that fails, I put printf();getchar(); items before and after (sorry I do not use a debugger).
Ok I may send the code but I doubt it could help because, this line is clear and I checked the argument (=100), so what?

Precedence is based on order in the XML, last XML entry parsed gets
priority  so that plugins override the provided readers easily. In addition,
readers can have a bool CanReadFile(); method, which gets called before the
decision is finalized.

I am currently trying to start working on developing a filter for Paraview,
since I am really new to VTK and Paraview I thought maybe I'd write and ask
you.

The following are what I currently need to do:

Geeting familiar with how scene graph is implemented with in Paraview and
how Paraview handles different kinds of data sets. what are the classes and
modules with in Paraview source?
Is there any guideline / tutorial type of material on developing a filter
for Paraview? I was not able to find anything useful on the net and I am
currently reading chapter 13 of the VTK guide book which talk about filters
and writing filters but I am not sure I am on a right track. There are a lot
of stuff there I am not familiar with as far as what they are in VTK
context. Does writing a VTK filter relate to writing filter for paraview,
I'd think you should be able to add it to Paraview since it is VTK based,
right?

Is there any detailed documentation of classes, modules and their
functionality with in Paraview? A tutorial on how develop and add a filter
to Paraview would be really nice.

I would really appreciate any comment or help you can give me.

This may-or-may not address your specific problem, but I wanted to 
mention that this is a really inefficient way to store a 
three-dimensional array.  VTK has classes that provide efficient storage 
of arbitrary-dimension dense and sparse arrays that you should consider 
using instead - see vtkArray and its subclasses:

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkArray.html

Tim

I think there is another problem with your code and it just fails in that
place - you are probably overwriting memory somewhere.  By having a
vector<vector<vector<double> > > > and then just allocating the first to
size of x*y, you will result in a vector or length x*y each containing empty
vector<vector<double> >'s.  Are you sure this is what you want? (if that
makes sense)
If you post the code I will look.

Paul

You right! I change the order of the plugin load and it work. But I don like
it! Then who want to use this has to make sure plugin load in some order?
and what if he want to use the other one on the other file?

I say that when PV encounter two reader that claim same extension then best
let user decide which he want to be use. that will be my choice... maybe I
don't have a choice!

Sure you have a choice. File a feature request. If you can't wait, change
the code. If you do, please submit a patch so everyone can benefit from your
effort.

Does anyone knows anything about the implementation of scene graph and how
it is implemented in ParaView? I need to understand how it is implemented,
name of the classes and modules and their locations. I was not able to find
anything on the web unfortunately.

Also don't forget about the CanReadFile option.  Implementing CanReadFile is by far the best option of them all because it will allow ParaView to always pick the right file without pestering the user with a chooser dialog box, which can be quite annoying.

There is no real scene graph, per se.  For each view, ParaView has a representation object, implemented as a subclass of vtkSMRepresentationProxy, for each pipeline object that manages how that data is drawn in the view.  One of the parameters is always whether the object is visible (drawn or not).

I suppose you could think of this as a special type of scene graph that is a 1 level deep hierarchy, but that is besides the point.  There is no connection between objects or explicit traversal.  No object should affect the rendering or placement of any other object.

CanReadFile can sometime be accepted by more than one reader. A csv
file for example. So CanReadFile is not always enough.

Personally I create my own extension to avoid conflict and ask the
users to change the extension of their file before opening it in
Paraview.

Probably letting the user choose the right reader is a better solution.

Yes this is exactly what I want.
The aim of this data structure is to maintain, for each pixel of an image, a list (which could be empty) of all points included in the corresponding area (ie (x,y,z) lists, which are coded as vtkstd::vector<double>).
So later in the code I initialize this structure as follow:

    fill(this->grid.begin(), this->grid.end(), vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::vector<double> >());

and then I add points in each list as follow:

    vtkstd::vector<double> pt2D;
    pt2D.push_back(pt[0]);
    pt2D.push_back(pt[1]);
    this->grid[*it].push_back(pt2D);

One more time, something may be wrong but it works well with VTK.

I think there is another problem with your code and it just fails in that place - you are probably overwriting memory somewhere.  By having a vector<vector<vector<double> > > > and then just allocating the first to size of x*y, you will result in a vector or length x*y each containing empty vector<vector<double> >'s.  Are you sure this is what you want? (if that makes sense)

If you post the code I will look.

Yes this is exactly the line of code that fails, I put printf();getchar(); items before and after (sorry I do not use a debugger).
Ok I may send the code but I doubt it could help because, this line is clear and I checked the argument (=100), so what?

Are you running this through a debugger?  And, is that the line that it is failing on?  Finally, can you post the PV code that is failing?

Hmmm, doubtful since in my test this->grid_xsize == this->grid_ysize == 10 !!

Hi,

I dug deeper into the class FileSeriesReader and found out that despite
what I thought and posted earlier everything is already there to be able
to implement a toggle to use/ignore time step values contained in a file
series. I'd like to propose the attached patch. It can be tested with
the attached minimal time series reader plugin, sample input files are
contained. The plugin's server manager XML has been extended to expose
the IgnoreTimeStepValues checkbox provided by the patched class
FileSeriesReader.

I don't see the patch interfering with existing readers relying on class
FileSeriesReader.
Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance for feedback,
Karl

Fred,

If you are overwriting memory then it will produce different results and,
even though it is not crashing in your VTK example, I would not say that it
"works well"!

You really need to post the *actual* code or a testcase (whole piece of code
- not snippets) that can reproduce the problem.

Regards,
Paul

PS One thing you could check from your snippet of code you sent is:

    assert(*it < this->grid.size());

before calling

    this->grid[*it].push_back(pt2D);

I do not believe that you are making good use of helpful volunteer's 
time by asking such questions if you are not even using a debugger. If 
your code is crashing, then you are doing something wrong. Use a 
debugger and when you find legitimate problems and bugs...post away.

Karl,

Your patch seems overly complicated.  There is exactly one check in vtkFileSeriesReader to determine whether the internal reader has time, and that is in RequestInformation.  It is a lot less intrusive to just add a condition to that check there.  I've attached a patch that implements the no-time flag in this way.  (BTW, I changed the name from IgnoreTimeStepValues to IgnoreReaderTime since a reader can in fact specify time without specifying time steps.)

the attached minimal time series reader plugin, sample input files are

the IgnoreTimeStepValues checkbox provided by the patched class
FileSeriesReader.

I don't see the patch interfering with existing readers relying on class
FileSeriesReader.
Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance for feedback,

Ken,

Thanks for looking into it again.
But your patch does less than mine (not only in terms of changed lines
:-) ). Loading e.g. the file series

sampleinputfiles/withduplicatetimes[0-9].foo

with "Ignore Reader Time" unchecked, the information tab lists the
following time indices and times:
Idx Val
0   0
1   0.1
2   0.3
3   0.4
4   0.8
5   0.9
That's fine, that's default behaviour. The files
withduplicatetimes{1,4,5,6}.foo are ignored.

With "Ignore Reader Time" checked, the information tab does not list any
time index/value any more and only the last file of the series gets
loaded: sampleinputfiles/withduplicatetimes9.foo. So, one cannot step
through the intermediate results for a given time step value any more.

Applying my patch, the information tab lists (in case "Ignore Reader
Time" is checked) all 10 files with fake time step values:
Idx Val
0   0
1   1
2   2
3   3
4   4
5   5
6   6
7   7
8   8
9   9
and one can really step through all files of the series.

Karl

Subject: [Paraview] New version of the "supercomputer" tutorial available
Message-ID: <C6D94E72.D265%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Hi folks,

I just wanted to let everyone know that there is a new version of the "supercomputer" tutorial available on the Wiki.  Because the tutorial is fairly general purpose, I've actually taken supercomputing out of the name and simply call it The ParaView Tutorial.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial

Changes for this version of the tutorial include:


 *   Updated for ParaView version 3.6.
 *   Exercises broken into smaller chunks.
 *   Added introduction to Python scripting.

In the past, readers have asked for the source materials of the document, mainly to perform translations.  I have included a link to the Wiki page where you can download the LaTeX source and images.  As before, anyone who wishes to make a translation is encouraged to do so.

Enjoy,

-Ken

Oops.  That is exactly what I intended with the patch I gave you, but I made a goof.  I guess I should have actually tried it before sending it off.

It's a simple fix.  I just needed to add a line.  The newly attached patch should work.  I actually tried it before sending this time. :)

Ken,

Indeed, that's a nice and simple solution to the problem! A pity I
didn't come up with it myself.
Now, if that patch would make it into the repository, that'd be great.
(It is not possible to provide a own FileSeriesReader class along with a
custom reader plugin, is it? Simply including the own (renamed)
FileSeriesReader source code in the plugin's CMakeLists.txt, changing
its server manager XML to use that particular class and compiling did at
least not work for me. Got an error as soon as trying to use the reader
from PV GUI.)

Subject: [Paraview] ANNOUNCEMENT: ITK 3.16 released
Message-ID: <45d654b0909191359ta74604n72f7a6d99a945506@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

We are pleased to announce the release of ITK 3.16.

ITK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers
with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.  ITK has
the same BSD-style licensing terms as ParaView and has been developed
using the same software engineering tools as ParaView (e.g., cmake,
dashboards, doxygen), ITK provides leading-edge algorithms for
registering and segmenting multidimensional data. Methods exist in the
InsightApplications repository for connecting ITK and VTK pipelines
together, so ITK methods can be easily integrated into ParaView
modules.

* Download instructions are available at:
  http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html

* Summary of new classes is available at:
  http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_3.16

* Summary of changes is available at:
  http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_3.16_Changed_From_Previous

* Release official announcement
http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/ITK?2009_09_16&ITK+3.16+Released

Summary:

The main changes in this release include the continued addition of
classes for managing labeled images contributed on an Insight Journal
article by G. Lehmann. These added classes were the remaining components
of a 70+ class label map morphology module. These classes provide for
the efficient representation of label maps and for conversion between
current ITK label images and the efficient storage format. Details are
available from "Label Object Representation and Manipulation with ITK",
which can be read in the January Source or on the Insight Journal
(http://hdl.handle.net/1926/584). These new classes can be found in the
Code/Review Directory and can be enabled by setting the CMake variable
ITK_USE_REVIEW to ON during the configuration process. Thanks to Gaetan
Lehmann and Sophie Chen for their dedication on bringing these valuable
new functionalities into ITK.

This release offers a fix to a long standing issue in ITK regarding the
computation of physical coordinates associated with pixels.  Thanks to
Tom Vercauteren and Michel Audette for their hard work on
getting this difficult issue fixed.

Many improvements and fixes in the I/O infrastructure were contributed
by Brad Lowekamp, making it now possible to manage large image files
through the streaming infrastructure of the data pipeline. In particular
Brad contributed examples illustrating how to process the entire Visible
Human dataset via an ITK pipeline.

Hi guys,

just curious to see what is the status of ParaView relating to Snow  
Leopard support.

I already compiled with Qt 4.5.2, Carbon and Cocoa (32 and 64 bit), on
Snow Leopard. It works fine. When compiling with Carbon, you need to
set the C and CXX flags to have -m32 manually. We'll fix that in time.
Make sure to use the cvs if you want the Cocoa support. I committed a
patch last week. The progress bar does not work with Cocoa. We will
fix that soon.

Nice, thanks !

Does "make install" generates a working app ?

I did not try but I'd give it a 5% chance of working :-) Let us know

I tried the latest svn with qt cocoa 64 bits and it compiled without  
any problem.
I can run from the build directory but the application is broken

Thanks !

Ken,

Indeed, that's a nice and simple solution to the problem! A pity I
didn't come up with it myself.
Now, if that patch would make it into the repository, that'd be great.
(It is not possible to provide a own FileSeriesReader class along with a
custom reader plugin, is it? Simply including the own (renamed)
FileSeriesReader source code in the plugin's CMakeLists.txt, changing
its server manager XML to use that particular class and compiling did at
least not work for me. Got an error as soon as trying to use the reader
from PV GUI.)

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with user defined filter
Message-ID: <200909212302167348950@qq.com>

I write a filter class just like the vtkAppendFilter ,and change a little on the mothod RequestData .My class also inherited from vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm .I did the job all on windows vs2008.The vtkAppendFilter.h defines the class with VTK_GRAPHICS_EXPORT which means __declspec( dllimport ) on my computer,but if I used that macro to define my own filter class it would met some link errors .If I use the macro VTK_EXPORT or did not use macro to  define my filter class ,it can complie well,but it did not work.I tried the debug.I found it would not invoke my RequestData function at all,and the it would not invoke vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm'RequestData methord either.The program invoked the method RequestData form vtkAlgorithm class directly.I don't know why? what should I do if want to define my own filter? Thanks a lot!

How are you trying to use your filter?  Are you trying to define it in a ParaView plugin?  If so, you should be able to leave out any of the _EXPORT declarations and it should work OK.

Message-ID: <d7f4480f0909211118o78b5b9bao96e257a842ba60c0@mail.gmail.com>

My issue was solved by putting the client and server plugins into the
same plugin, then loading on both client and server. I had previously
given them two different names, which was the root of the problem even
if I tried loading both my client and my server plugin on both the
client and the server.

I still get the 'vtkServerConnection (0x15949e70): Server failed to
gather information.' error message on starting up the server, or
loading a file, which is annoying but seems to be innocuous. At some
point soon I'll look into it and post when I have fixed the problem.

Hi,

I try to use hdf5-hyperslabs for the Geometry-section,
but this results in a segmentation fault of paraview 3.4.0 and 3.6.1.
Any ideas? I attached an example.

Greetings

Are there any error messages on the server side when you get that
error "failed to gather information" on the client?

Yes, that is one of the errors. The errors I get are (as I listed in

Ah, sorry I parsed your email wrong. I will have to look again to see
if I get a reverse error.... I will let you know.

Is it possible that your server and client ParaView versions don't
exactly match? Are you working off CVS by any chance?

Message-ID: <4AB7CA6E.2000400@gmx.de>

Hi,

I try to use hdf5-hyperslabs for the Geometry-section,
but this results in a segmentation fault of paraview 3.4.0 and 3.6.1.
Any ideas? I attached an example.

Greetings
Jens

I simplified the example and found, that the segfault is independed of
hyperslab.
The attached simplified xdmf-file segfaults in paraview 3.4 and 3.6, too.
Any ideas?

This should work. At least I found an example and cannot see the
difference:

Dear paraview developers and users,

I got this error when I attempted to open a .vtu file:

I guess it's all the same error. I  have some working files from before and
I created this file from the same script. I have checked the number of
points and the number of elements literally more than 5 or 6 times, and I
have no idea why it would give me ths kind of error... My file is huge so I
won't sent it, but it looks roughly like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid">
<UnstructuredGrid>

.... (lists of elements, 4980272 of these in total, and starting from 0 for
node indexing like I did in the other files that opened fine.)
</DataArray>
<DataArray type="Int32" Name="offsets">

12
..., number of these is 4980272
</DataArray>

</DataArray>

... (number of data entries = number of nodes = 6225340)
</DataArray>
</PointData>
</Piece>
</UnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

Could the problem be that the file is too large? I'm running on a Macpro
with 16 GB's of RAM, and it's a 2 x 2.26GHz quad-core Intel Xeon processor.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Karen

Subject: [Paraview] [Bug?] Color information not saved/restored as part of
	state
Message-ID: <4AB7FD74.7010600@web.de>

Hi,

Even in the simplest cases, Paraview (version 3.6.1) does not appear to 
save or restore color information about objects. The following simple 
case illustrates this problem:

1. Create a cube objects set its color to red, or any color other than 
the default

2. Save the state (File -> Save State)

3. Delete the builtin server (this is my favorite method of clearing a 
scene) and load the saved state

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with FFMPEG
Message-ID: <ce5dae9f0909220402h11276e72k9410a0cda4ca70b5@mail.gmail.com>

I have been trying to compile Paraview with FFMPEG without success.
I have updated my ParaView cvs today.
I tried with FFMPEG shared and static libraries.
It all compiles fine except the last bit with the Examples part where CMAKE
seems to fall over (I saw this is a current bug).
There is no particular message at anytime during the compilation about
FFMPEG.

When I then use ParaView I do not get the option for output to AVI ...

Any help ??

PS: Yes I did turn the VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER to ON

Cheers,
Jacques

If your FFMPEG installation is in a non-standard path, you probably need to specify more than just this option. Check whether ccmake lists the location of the three FFMPEG libraries after the configure step. If not, specify them manually, e.g. via

ccmake -DVTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER:BOOL=ON 
-DFFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<ffmpegpath>/include 
-DFFMPEG_avcodec_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<ffmpegpath>/lib/libavcodec.so 
-DFFMPEG_avformat_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<ffmpegpath>/lib/libavformat.so 
-DFFMPEG_avutil_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<ffmpegpath>/lib/libavutil.so

I compiled PV-CVS with FFMPEG support like this just tonight without any problems.

Message-ID: <30661728.1260911253621288337.JavaMail.coremail@app183.163.com>

Hi,all

I use paraview on one Fedora 11 laptop with intel graphics card. After I start it for several minutes, it stop respond and freeze the computer,I have to reboot the computer.

The same happens in both Gnome and KDE.
It happens with either the package coming with the system or the compiled one,both paraview 3.4 and paraview 3.6.1, for the 3.6.1 version I have tried to compile with qt 4.3.5 or 4.5.2.

Now I run out of ideas. Any one have suggestions?

What I am trying to do now is to update the system to rawhide in order to try one new intel driver ,also one new system maybe.

Best wishes.

I'd suspect that it's your OpenGL drivers. I had similar problems with ATI

Thanks Paul. I'll use the object inspector from now on.

Clearly, the problem is that the toolbar "edit color map" and the object 
inspector's "set solid color" buttons are not in synch i.e. changes made 
by the former are not visible to the latter.

Thanks for the workaround.

How are you trying to use your filter?  Are you trying to define it in a ParaView plugin?  If so, you should be able to leave out any of the _EXPORT declarations and it should work OK.

So you have written a vtk filter, then I am assuming you have some main() in
which you are creating a VTK-pipeline to use this filter? Are you setting up
the inputs correctly? Try calling Update() directly on  the filter, does
that result in calling of your RequestData() method?

Hey Vtk and Paraview Community

First of my apologies for my basic question but I am very new to both of
this packages! I would like to write a plug in for Paraview, where this plug
in can manipulate two joint object (Joint Visualization), and I want to be
able to look underneath the  surface and be able to see the other object
underneath, its structure, density and where they intersect.
I have been looking in to How to write filter in vtk (Off of VTK Guide), do
you have any idea what supper class is the best to use for this purpose,
most of the filters I saw are based on some supper class (of Vtk or
Paraview). Any ideas and directions on how to do this is really appreciated,
I am a newbie here and I am just trying to get hang of it.

thanks in advance!

Hello.
When I try compile the cvs version of ParaView I get follow errors from
ccmake:

But seems Paraview's cvs have not a directory VTK/Utilities at all.
Please, help me.

karen,

here's a possibility.
i haven't done the math for your number of points/cells; but xml files have
an inherent size limit.
i've seen this error for appended vtk xml files (not ascii as yours are)

i believe it has to do with the size of the offsets.
it's a limitation of xml itself.

i've use vtkpython scripts on a 64 bit linux machine to write vtk xml files
that i can't read
with vtk or paraview. which is just wrong. 

i've asked that the xml writers take a look at what's being written
and at least send a warning that the file violates this xml limit.
hasn't happened yet.

just a thought.

Dear paraview developers and users,

I got this error when I attempted to open a .vtu file:

I guess it's all the same error. I  have some working files from before and I
created this file from the same script. I have checked the number of points
and the number of elements literally more than 5 or 6 times, and I have no
idea why it would give me ths kind of error... My file is huge so I won't
sent it, but it looks roughly like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

</DataArray>

... (number of data entries = number of nodes = 6225340)
</DataArray>
</PointData>
</Piece>
</UnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

Could the problem be that the file is too large? I'm running on a Macpro with
16 GB's of RAM, and it's a 2 x 2.26GHz quad-core Intel Xeon processor.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Hi Michael,

Thanks for your response. That is possible since I have 6 million nodes and
4 million elements. However, I was able to open a file with 1 million nodes
and 7 million elements before...

And I have this new file that's 30k nodes long and 600k elements. It just
crashed paraview (quit unexpectedly is the message I got from the Mac OS)
without giving any sort of warning. Did that three times...

What could this problem here? (I checked the number of elements, nodes etc
and everything seems legit and it's way smaller than what I was able to
open...)

Thanks,
Karen

Oops, I just fixed the small one. It was a silly mistake, so now it opens
fine. So yeah, it's probably the size of the file that was the problem...

Any chance that can be fixed?

Thanks much,

If you can add those to the bug tracker as well, that'd be great.

Message-ID: <9D96C3B9C12B4C4A9BD31761B4F824103BFA9C0CD9@imibou-nt-1-ex.IMI.LOCAL>

Good morning,

I compiled ParaView 3.7 from source depot, on my mac, with Snow Leopard without problem.

I used qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.6.0-tp1.
(./configure -release -cocoa -framework -fast -qt3support -platform macx-g++)
I  installed Qt in my personnel account.

I compiled ParaView with cocoa, python, shared option on)
I had to set QT_PHONON_INCLUDE_DIR to point to the include files.

I used gcc4.2.1
cmake 2.6.4

Works fine.

Hi,

Can Paraview be made to listen for and display data generated by an 
external process or simulation in in realtime. I'm working on a number 
of simulations, and I would like to have Paraview automatically display 
data generated by the each step of the process as soon each step is 
complete.

Thanks,

Hi,all

I have one problem. The plotting legend label format is very bad. It is not easy to read the label.Please see the attached picture and any advice is appreciated.

I have tried both pv 3.6.1 and 3.4.

Do you have two legends on top of each other - for instance, one from one filter and one from another?  If so, turn one off, or drag one to the side.

Thanks for your tip. But I'm sure there is only one legend. I'm using Fedora rawhide. Now I'm trying compiling the latest cvs to see if it could solve the problem.

Any other suggestion? Or I'm so lucky to be the first to have such problem?

If you want to put something together really quickly and don't mind
writing some c++ code, you could modify pqMainWindowCore.cxx to create
an instance of QFileSystemWatcher.  Connect the
QFileSystemWatcher::fileChanged or
QFileSystemWatcher::directoryChanged signal to a slot that calls a
python script:

  this->Implementation->PythonManager.pythonShellDialog()->runScript("update_visualization.py");

I?ve never seen anything like this before.  Is it possible that your graphics driver is not displaying text correctly?  One of your older posts suggests that your graphics card might be acting... strange.

Thanks. Yes,previously I use Fedora 11,while now I update to Fedora rawhide,the previous problem,namely paraview freezing the computer has gone,but I have the label problem. I will try one old distro.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView in parallel
Message-ID: <c9adba420909230209s700ac4c4k41da693eae763d0e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been experimenting with ParaView in parallel without much.  Below I
have listed my setup, experiences and questions!

*Setup*
My setup is a 6 node gigabit cluster (without gfx cards), compiled with
OSMesa.  The filesystem is only a RAID on the frontend exported with NFS.
Each node has 8 cores and I experimented running with both 1 core per node
and also 8 cores per node

*Data*
The data I am reading is multiple blocks, where each contains an
unstructured grid and a multiblock structure of polydata surfaces.  The data
is about 10 million points in total.

*Reader*
My reader is not written for parallel so I loaded in the mesh and
partitioned it with D3.  The partitioning took a long time - approx 2 mins -
is this normal?  When the data was partitioned I didn't really notice much
difference in speed and the rendering performance was considerably worse
than a single node for the same data.  Is this just the result of using
OSMesa?  If so, does anyone have any suggestions for the number of nodes to
be running on?  I also tried saving my data once it was partitioned but then
loading it actually took longer (is this due to a lack of parallel
filesystem?)

*Filters
*I tried to run some of my custom filters but one that calculates scalar
variables for pointdata didn't display the variables in the GUI after
running the filter.  Do I to do something different for parallel filters?

Finally, is there any documentation for implementing parallel readers (or
simple examples) in ParaView?  And, does anyone have any suggestions for how
to split up the data?

Thanks,
Paul

Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0909230246j7a6f42e4qc48e7d44eb5c8973@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The progress bar shows an "Abort" icon at its left. this icon is enabled
during AVI export of an animation. I wonder how I can enable during a filter
execution (ie. aborting a RequestData function).
- I added an observer in my vtk filter that listen to
vtkCommand::AbortCheckEvent.
- The associated callback function simply calls AbortExecuteOn( ) ((as it
derives from vtkAlgorithm).
- My RequestData function implements a test of AbortExecute value

Now, I just want to send the AbortEvent when I click on "Abort" in paraview
!

Thanks for your help !

Aborting filter executions is not currently supported in ParaView. We have
been thinking of providing this support for quite sometime however there are
many issues related with aborting execution midway that need to be addressed
and hence it has been pending. Thanks for adding it on uservoice. If there's
more interest, we will up the priority on this one.

Can your C++ subroutine:
1) create and instance of whichever subclass of vtkDataSet is most suitable
to your problem,
2) populate that dataset by making calls to the vtkDataSet API, and
3) create a vtkDataSetWriter, set it's input to be that dataset, set it's
filename, and call Write()?

If not then you need to manually populate the file yourself, making sure
that you conform to what the book says about the file format.

I suspect that this problem has already been posted but did not find it in the archives.
So my problem is as simple as 123: I save a polydata set and try to load it again, and I obtain this results.

  Generic Warning: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.6.1/VTK/IO/vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1382
  Error reading ascii data. Possible mismatch of datasize with declaration
With vtk-4.2 I get another message:
  Generic Warning: In /usr/local/vtk-5.2.0/IO/vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1250
  Error reading ascii data!

Any tips?

Hi Paul,

If you have graphics cards available then you likely don't want to use 
mesa, rather hardware rendering.

You'd be better of reading you data in parallel than using D3. Why add 
an extra stage to your pipeline, and one that involves interprocess 
communication?

Depending on the data the vtk pipeline can tell you how to partition, 
image data for example. Otherwise you can devise your own approach. 
Perhaps giving each process the same number of points such that the 
points are clustered near each other is a good approach. I don't think 
filters need to do anything very special to work in parallel, unless 
interprocess communication is required. There is some documentation in 
the PV guide for parallel readers.

In my experience NFS is suboptimal for parallel readers, especially 
those using MPI IO. But I doubt nfs is entirely to blame for your troubles.

In your serial reader does each process load all of the data? If yes 
then I don't think you can blame nfs. What writer/reader did you use? 
Stay away from XML file format if you care at all about performance.

I have seen readers that divide the available blocks among available 
processes. However, I am a fan of the single file approach as it's 
easier to divide the data up such that one gets balanced loading 
independent of the number of processes used. MPI2 has optimization for 
non-contiguous access on parallel fs.

I often use PV in parallel with Mesa and lustre fs. The system I use 
doesn't have graphics hardware and if I don't run parallel then I run 
out of memory pretty quickly. I have image data and the vtk pipeline 
tells how to partition. It works well. My rule of thumb is to use as few 
processes as possible not to run out of memory. In my experience this 
gives the best performance, but it may have something to do with the 
particular data and filters I use, as I have heard Ken say that PV 
scales well to 100s of processes.

You said your data is multiblock, but you did not say how many blocks it has.  D3 is going to run its partitioning algorithm on each block independently.  This is bad if you have lots of blocks; you will end up with lots of tiny pieces on all the processes.

To make your reader "parallel", you basically just have to set vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() in the output information in the RequestInformation call (usually you set it to -1 to allow the downstream pipeline to set any number of pieces) and then read vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() and vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), which will correspond to the number of processes and local rank in ParaView, in the RequestData call.

If your data typically has lots of blocks, I would design the reader to simply assign blocks to pieces so that each piece has about the same amount of data and then read in the blocks associated with the requested piece.  This should yield the simplest code and the fastest reading times, and the approach (generally) does not require you to worry about ghost cells.

The simplest example of a reader that responds to piece requests is the vtkParticleReader.  That reader breaks up a list of points into the requested pieces, but it is not a stretch to do the same thing with the blocks.

Hi,

I've been experimenting with ParaView in parallel without much.  Below I have listed my setup, experiences and questions!

Setup
My setup is a 6 node gigabit cluster (without gfx cards), compiled with OSMesa.  The filesystem is only a RAID on the frontend exported with NFS.  Each node has 8 cores and I experimented running with both 1 core per node and also 8 cores per node

Data
The data I am reading is multiple blocks, where each contains an unstructured grid and a multiblock structure of polydata surfaces.  The data is about 10 million points in total.

Reader
My reader is not written for parallel so I loaded in the mesh and partitioned it with D3.  The partitioning took a long time - approx 2 mins - is this normal?  When the data was partitioned I didn't really notice much difference in speed and the rendering performance was considerably worse than a single node for the same data.  Is this just the result of using OSMesa?  If so, does anyone have any suggestions for the number of nodes to be running on?  I also tried saving my data once it was partitioned but then loading it actually took longer (is this due to a lack of parallel filesystem?)

Filters
I tried to run some of my custom filters but one that calculates scalar variables for pointdata didn't display the variables in the GUI after running the filter.  Do I to do something different for parallel filters?

Finally, is there any documentation for implementing parallel readers (or simple examples) in ParaView?  And, does anyone have any suggestions for how to split up the data?

Thanks,
Paul

Hi,
I also had such a problem:
1- depending on your regional settings, it is possible that your
written decimal separator is not a '.' [point] but a ',' [comma] (such
as the french fashion ;) ). Then the reader may be not able to read
it.
2- if some point data are 'NaN', or 'inf', then the reader cannot
assign a correct scalar.

You can check these points by reading the ascii file with a simple text editor.

Regards,
Jerome

It turns out that you are right: decimal section has been introduced by PV with a comma.
By I do not understand why this regional settings apply at writing time and not at reading time!

Subject: [Paraview] animate trouble by paraview
Message-ID: <6dac95df0909231513h46c38ec9i7bfa03c0d08b4a3c@mail.gmail.com>

I like to animate some fly through of my scene. After two day it do not
work!

the interpolate camera position method, it has idea on it own and often my
render leave the scene completely.I quit this because so dificult to get
what I want.
the follow path - I do not know how this work.
the orbit try give me the orbit I do not want. ;)

I think I must have try everything, except what work! Must be some better
way?

addition frustrate,
After the camera animate (constant time) I change the timestep of my reader,
but nothing works, reader stay at same time. I have to start over.

Thank you for your advice.I find it was the input problem,but I got a  new one.When I run my filter ,I got an error:Cell array cell types with 1 components, has only 18 tuples but there are 180 cells .

The below is how  my RequestData() write.I am sorry to type long boring code . I have tried to settle it by myself,but it seems a long time job. I write the filter almost follow the source code vtkAppendFilter .I make my own code bold-faced.I just want to add some lines to the input dataset.

So you have written a vtk filter, then I am assuming you have some main() in which you are creating a VTK-pipeline to use this filter? Are you setting up the inputs correctly? Try calling Update() directly on  the filter, does that result in calling of your RequestData() method?

How are you trying to use your filter?  Are you trying to define it in a ParaView plugin?  If so, you should be able to leave out any of the _EXPORT declarations and it should work OK.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel ParaView: inexplicable results.
Message-ID: <754572.62091.qm@web23207.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

I am getting the infamous warning

"Display is not accessible on the server side.
Remote rendering will be disabled."

whenever I start PV in client/server mode. This is because the remote pvservers cannot connect to the local X servers. The only way I have been able to get rid of it is to physically log in to each remote node before I establish the client/server connection (OSMesa not an option). Now, I can either choose to do that (case 1), or I can choose to accept the above warning and tolerate that only data processing will be parallel - rendering will be done locally on the client (case 2).

I have observed that the following procedure produces different results in case 1 and 2:

Start client/server using reverse connect.
Load data set.
Apply D3 filter.
Apply ProcessId filter.
Adjust color map resolution to equal number of pvserver nodes.
Color data set with process id.

Case 1:
-------
The whole data set is colored with process 0 color.
The pvserver continuosly spits out:
ICET,0:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree.

Case 2:
-------
Data set colored as expected showing equal distribution of data between nodes.
pvserver spits out:
No protocol specified.

In both cases Remote Rendering Threshold is on and set to 0 MB.

The ICET error is likely caused by different screen resolutions on servers and client. It is not possible for me to have the same resolution everywhere. 

The 'No protocol specified' is due to the missing X server connection, so this is expected.

Why is case 1 different from case 2 - is it because of the ICET error ?


A few details:
--------------
ParaView 3.6.1 Release build from sources.
Data set size 111 MB.
VTK_MPI_MAX_NUMPROCS:STRING=32

Sound like you have to write a conversion program or so that imports 
your simulation data, and exports a VTK file. I have also struggled with 
this problem of writing vtk files without linking to the library. I 
found two solutions:

1) Create .vtk files (the old format) -- I included subroutines 
(visit_writer.c and visit_writer.h) in this message which I found online 
at the LLNL/VisIt page [1]. Note that these are wrapper functions, so 
you'll have to write your own function in which you collect all 
necessary data into the required variables/arrays, then send it over to 
the wrapper functions. For a rectilinear grid, I've included my own 
function in example.c. The advantage is that this format can handle 
binary variables thus the files will be smaller and (I think) faster to 
load. For acsii file format, check also [2]

2) Write new VTK format (*.vtu/vtr/vti/etc) using your own routines. 
Take a look at the file-formats.pdf document, and at the link below [3] 
which contains a lot of example files. (I export such files from my code 
in ascii format only, since I don't know how to write in the base64 
format which is required for binary).

So just start by writing line-by-line similar files as the examples 
below. Do not immediately try to export your simulation, rather start 
with 3 datapoints in a 3D space (see included 
example-particles-and-vectors.vtu) to get used to the file format.

Subject: [Paraview] D3 not deterministic?
Message-ID: <4ABB2BA7.3090101@web.de>

Hi,

Hopefully someone can shed some light on this one:
I start tonight's PV in client/server mode with 4 parallel pvserver
processes. The pipeline is as follows:
   Sources - Plane (default settings)
   Triangulate
   Subdivide (Number of Subdivisions: 3)
   D3 (default settings, i.e.
       Boundary Mode: Assign cells uniquely, Minimal Memory unchecked)
   Process Id Scalars (Random Mode unchecked)

All tetrahedra's are equally distributed, that's what I expected, fine.
Now:
1) Check "Minimal Memory" of D3 properties. Nothing changes, fine.
2) Uncheck "Minimal Memory" of D3 properties. Nothing changes, still fine.
3) Check "Minimal Memory" of D3 properties and change Boundary Mode to
"Duplicate cells". The partition changes, reasonable.
4) Change Boundary Mode back to "Assign cells uniquely", the partition
doesn't change again to the initial one.
(You can get back the earlier partition by changing both the "Minimal
Memory" setting and the Boundary Mode setting at the same time.)

Isn't D3 deterministic?

Thanks,
Karl

By reading the attached files I'm experiencing the attached error message.

I hope someone can point out the mistake(s) in the files, because I tried nearly everything and stayed pretty exactly with the file-formats.pdf (at least I think so).

Thanks in advance, Joseph Goldmann

Hi,

you have a typo error line 16:  </PRectiliniearGrid> instead of
</PRectilinearGrid>

Subject: [Paraview] Mesh Visualization
Message-ID: <20090924085423.bviszkudn488g4sc@webmail.polo.ufsc.br>


Salutations,

I'm trying to make OpenFOAM's first tutorial (lid driven cavity flow),  
and when I finish the mesh generation I cant visualize the mesh.
I check all the boxes in the "Region Status" ("Mesh Parts" here),   
then I click "Apply", go to the display panel where it shows "Color  
By...", then I select "Solid", but instead of showing "Set Solid  
Color..." it shows "Set Ambient Color...", and I cant visualize any  
mesh.
Im running ParaView 3.6.1.

Can anybody help?

Thanks a lot


Yours,

Can you be a bit more specific? You are not seeing anything? Or what
you are seeing is not what you expect?

You are adding lines to the input dataset at the end i.e. adding new
cells to the dataset. However the cell-data which has to match the
number of cells was never updated to have valid values for the newly
added cells. Are you interested in the cell-data at all? Otherwise
simply call output->GetCellData()->Initialize() to get rid of all
cell-data arrays. You may want to refer to the VTK book or the VTK
Users guide if you are unclear about how the cell-data, point-data
etc. work.

Subject: [Paraview] Bounding box problem with slice and clip
Message-ID: <7307156.208241253800653314.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hello,

In this days i'm working with paraview but i have a big

problem.

Infact when i try to create a slice or a clip of a mesh the

bounding box that paraview create is smaller than the real bounding box

of the mesh.

My jobmate and I have solved this problem by increasing

the coordinate system of a factor 1.00001 .

Is there another solution?

Could you help us?

thanks
franco dassi


p.s. i give you the file

speed.inp that gives us this problem.

Subject: [Paraview] D3 not deterministic?
In-Reply-To: <4ABB2BA7.3090101@web.de>
Message-ID: <C6E0DE23.D50A%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I think I see what is going on.  In summary, it looks like changing the boundary mode does not properly set the modified flag on the D3 filter and is therefore not properly updating when you change only that parameter (but doing so deterministically).  The minimal memory flag seems to set the modified flag properly, thereby forcing the update you should have seen when you changed the boundary mode.

Here is some more info about what is happening (in case, for example, you want to submit a bug or work around it).  In all cases, the partitioning is really the same.  Underneath, D3 partitions the space with a k-d tree.  The tree is the same size as the number of processes and each process is assigned a leaf in the tree.  The k-d tree is coming out the same each time.  The difference is how D3 distributes the cells based on the k-d tree.  If the boundary mode is assign cells uniquely, then each cell is assigned to exactly one region of the k-d tree (I believe the one containing the centroid), and the cells are sent to the process for that region.  In the duplicate cells boundary mode, cells sent to all processes that have a region that overlaps the cells.  Thus, cells on the boundaries are duplicated.  The change you are seeing is simply the overlap of cells in the processes.  If you turn on parallel rendering (change the remote render threshold to 0), the overlap will probably become very noticeable.

Hi,

Hopefully someone can shed some light on this one:
I start tonight's PV in client/server mode with 4 parallel pvserver
processes. The pipeline is as follows:
   Sources - Plane (default settings)
   Triangulate
   Subdivide (Number of Subdivisions: 3)
   D3 (default settings, i.e.
       Boundary Mode: Assign cells uniquely, Minimal Memory unchecked)
   Process Id Scalars (Random Mode unchecked)

All tetrahedra's are equally distributed, that's what I expected, fine.
Now:
1) Check "Minimal Memory" of D3 properties. Nothing changes, fine.
2) Uncheck "Minimal Memory" of D3 properties. Nothing changes, still fine.
3) Check "Minimal Memory" of D3 properties and change Boundary Mode to
"Duplicate cells". The partition changes, reasonable.
4) Change Boundary Mode back to "Assign cells uniquely", the partition
doesn't change again to the initial one.
(You can get back the earlier partition by changing both the "Minimal
Memory" setting and the Boundary Mode setting at the same time.)

Isn't D3 deterministic?

Thanks,
Karl

Why is OSMesa not an option?  Mesa 3D is free and it compiles just about everywhere.

The IceT errors you are getting are actually probably caused by you having different resolutions on the local X servers.  Specifically, the X server on node 0 probably has a larger resolution than at least one of the other X servers.

I cannot think of a reason why D3 would behave differently between case 1 and 2.  As far as the filter execution is concerned, the two cases should be the same.  Could it be that your data is initially replicated everywhere and that D3 is somehow not able to combine co-located points?

I am getting the infamous warning

"Display is not accessible on the server side.
Remote rendering will be disabled."

whenever I start PV in client/server mode. This is because the remote pvservers cannot connect to the local X servers. The only way I have been able to get rid of it is to physically log in to each remote node before I establish the client/server connection (OSMesa not an option). Now, I can either choose to do that (case 1), or I can choose to accept the above warning and tolerate that only data processing will be parallel - rendering will be done locally on the client (case 2).

I have observed that the following procedure produces different results in case 1 and 2:

Start client/server using reverse connect.
Load data set.
Apply D3 filter.
Apply ProcessId filter.
Adjust color map resolution to equal number of pvserver nodes.
Color data set with process id.

Case 1:
-------
The whole data set is colored with process 0 color.
The pvserver continuosly spits out:
ICET,0:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree.

Case 2:
-------
Data set colored as expected showing equal distribution of data between nodes.
pvserver spits out:
No protocol specified.

In both cases Remote Rendering Threshold is on and set to 0 MB.

The ICET error is likely caused by different screen resolutions on servers and client. It is not possible for me to have the same resolution everywhere.

The 'No protocol specified' is due to the missing X server connection, so this is expected.

Why is case 1 different from case 2 - is it because of the ICET error ?


A few details:
--------------
ParaView 3.6.1 Release build from sources.
Data set size 111 MB.
VTK_MPI_MAX_NUMPROCS:STRING=32

Franco, 
Thank you for this report.  There is a bug in ParaView using this dataset.  If you do the following:
* Sources/ Wavelet/ Apply
* Representation/ Surface.
* Clip/ Apply.
Notice that you see the clip volume as a white set of lines forming a cube.  This is correct behavior.

If you do the same with your dataset, the clip volume is in the wrong location, and scaled incorrectly.  This is a bug.
Your workaround does seem to work correctly.

I will log this as a bug, targeted for 3.8.0

Alan

Franco,

You asked for another solution:
Besides the transform filter with a scaling factor of 1.00001 the
clean-to-grid filter can serve to work around the bug.

Message-ID: <303b1f660909241956v61c76715lea785f0f60c116ea@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Does anyone know how different coordination systems is being handled in
ParaView and How paraview keeps track of the the transformation from one to
another one!
Here is my train of thoughts, well in any 3D Visualization system we have a
"Point of View" which I think in ParaView is handled with a Class (ParaView
uses the term Camera I think) which I assume it is in a different coordinate
system than Our actual scene! (I would actually like to know name of and the
location of the camera class in ParaView Source if you know where it is
please do let me know)
Further more, we might have more than an object which we are visualizing
(reading off of vtk file) and they might be in different coordinate systems
how does ParaView handle this? which class is used to handle this kind of
differences and how ParaView keeps the track of these transforms? Any
specific Proxy or Super class is used here to handle this?

I would appreciate any help or comment!

Subject: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log
Message-ID: <SNT106-W553B0ED72094E8AAD6FF0DABD90@phx.gbl>


Hi all,

 

I'm doing parallel rendering using 1 client (dual core laptop) and 2 cluster servers (dual core desktop)

below is the timer log result i collected when i run: mpirun -np 4 pvserver

 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Local Process

Still Render, 3.029 seconds

Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 457, 1.98248 seconds

 

 

Server, Process 0

Execute vtkFileSeriesReader id: 176, 0.637821 seconds

Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 457, 1.49186 seconds

Dataserver gathering to 0, 0.829525 seconds

Dataserver sending to client, 0.661658 seconds

 

Server, Process 1

Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 457, 0.141821 seconds

Dataserver gathering to 0, 0.141544 seconds

 

Server, Process 2

Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 457, 0.243584 seconds

Dataserver gathering to 0, 0.243318 seconds

 

Server, Process 3

Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 457, 0.191589 seconds

Dataserver gathering to 0, 0.191303 seconds

 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log, my guess is:

 

Scenario 1: 

Process 0 reads the whole data, disseminate the dats into 4 pieces, then distribute to itself and Process 1&2&3,

each node will process the data and send it back Process 0,

Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,

client renders the data

 

Scenario 2:

Process 0 reads the whole data, distribute the whole data to Process 0&1&2&3,

each node will 'take' their own piece of data to process, then send it back Process 0,

Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,

client renders the data

   

Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?

 

is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute vtkFileSeriesReader, Execute vtkMPIMoveData?

 

any help / feedback is highly appreciated!

thanks!

 

regards,

chewping

Hi,

Concerning coordinate systems, the visualization pipeline is what is of
interest for you. You won't find useful stuff in ParaView sources (well,
except for some helper classes or wrap-around VTK) but instead you should
take a look at VTK sources. There, you will find a vtkCamera class and
vtkTransform filters, but also coordinate systems correspondances in
vtkRenderer, vtkMapper, ... ie everything that has role in the visualization
pipeline.

Sorry for the lack of precisions, but I hope that'll help...

Message-ID: <BAY109-W4093F40D3C80061C629DBFB2D90@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I have understood that it is possible to bound the domain of an input variable by the range of a scalar array.
But the PV doc said that it is mandatory to connect the ArrayRangeDomain section with a StringVectorProperty, which allows to select the scalars.
Is it possible to bound a variable by an array range without having to offer the posibility of choosing the array (in my case, the required array has a fixed name and thus I woulf like not to offer any alternative choice)?

You can try specifying the array name as a default value for the
string-verctor-property and then  use:
 <Hints>
       <Property name="TheArrayNameProperty" show="0"/>
 </Hints>

to hide the property from the user.

Subject: [Paraview] messy legend
Message-ID: <5229540.374781253885178125.JavaMail.coremail@bj163app15.163.com>

Hi,All

I was bothering by this problem for several days. The legend is very bad.

I tried two or three Fedora versions, 10,11,rawhide. For Fedora 11,I have other problem,namely paraview freeze the computer,so I don't notice whether this version also have this problem.

For all version I tried, I test both the version coming with the distro and personally compiled version(I have tried both 3.4.0 and 3.6.1)

Since I have tried different Fedora version,they should have different versions of graphic driver, I guess this is not the problem. Now I suspect whether this problem is related with the hardware. But I do not have any other problem with the graphic card.

Can any one have any idea which is the next possible direction I should try to solve this problem?


Best wishes.

Hi Jean,

I did read the question, but I was hoping someone else would have some time
to look into it. It definitely is a bug that needs to be fixed. I have not
yet tried to reproduce it and start looking into it. My hunch is that the
extent translator is being overridden or is not being propagated throughout
the pipeline somehow.

Please file a bug report (assign it to me, Berk or Utkarsh) and we will try
to get it fixed for 3.6.2.

To verify whether your graphics driver/card is causing this issue, you
can compile Mesa (from mesa3d.org) yourself without any hardware
support and use it as your OpenGL. If you are still having this
problem, it is not your card.

Subject: [Paraview] Loading CTH Data
Message-ID: <4ABCF815.8090903@arl.army.mil>

A couple of CTH-related questions/problems:

#1
I have some spcth files from CTH Version 8.x that I'm trying to read 
into Paraview 3.6.1.       The data has 5 Material Volume Fractions, but 
when I use the extractCTHParts filter, it only picks up the first 2 
volume fraction variables (I have all 5 variables loaded).    Do I have 
to run the data through an additional filter prior to extracting the CTH 
parts?

#2
I have an additional dataset from CTH Version 9.x, and I am able to 
extract all of the CTH parts as expected from all available material 
volume fractions.   However, there are numerous "holes" in the results 
that should not be there.   I have the threshold set to 0.5 in the 
extractCTHPart filter, and have bumped it up to .9 and there are still 
missing surfaces.     (I have verified that the data is correct by using 
a different visualization package to view the dataset).  

In both of these cases, I'm using Paraview in Client/Server mode, with 
the backend running in parallel on a larger cluster.

Your FieldDataDomain has the same name as the ArrayListDomain, and
hence the error. Also, the attribute_type and input_domain_name
attributes are not used on FieldDataDomain (look at
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filter.xml for examples). Also I am
not sure you are using the "input_domain_name" attribute on
ArrayListDomain correctly. Are you trying to refer to the double
vector property named "IntegrationTime" by any chance?
input_domain_name can only be used to refer to the name of a domain on
the "Input" property and it must be of the type InputArrayDomain.

Are you using Paraview from CVS, or the latest release?

I see a difference between paraview 3.4 from Fedora, and the CVS
version.

Look at the attached PNG files.

Hi,Thanks for your reply. I try to narrow the problem as follows. I wonder if I could get some other hints. Compiling mesa3d is difficult to me.

I install linux on a PC today,let's call it server. If I run paraview on the server and display it on the server,then everything is ok. But if I use my laptop ,log into the server,then plot with paraview on the server and display the result on the laptop,then I get the bad legend again.

Any hints?

The mesa autoconf files never have worked for me, but, the pre-packaged 
make files always have. "make linux".

When you connect to the server from your laptop: Go to 
"Edit->Settings->Render View->Server". See that "remote Render 
Threshold" is checked and set the value to 0. That will make sure 
rendering happens on the server and not on your laptop.

I believe that the legend is always rendered on the client so changing
to remote render would probably have no effect.

Hi Berk,

I don't doubt you but I am surprised to learn that the scalar bar widget
is being rendered client side. In client-server mode as I interact with
the scalar bar widget the scene is re-render server side and an image is
shipped with every mouse move. To see that this is so put a print
statements in vtkPVDesktopDeliveryClient::ReceiveImageFromServer. Since
the scalar bar widget is rendered client side, is there really a need to
re-render and ship the image form the server side with each scalar bar
widget interaction? Preventing these server side render/image transfers
would certainly improve remote interactivity.

By the way can you point me to where PV renders the scalar bar widget?

Hi Burlen,

I totally agree. If possible, we should change it so that there is no
server side render and image delivery when interacting with the scalar
bar widget. I am guessing it will involve subclassing the scalar bar
widget and changes to some other stuff. Utkarsh, what do you think?

Well, don't forget the scalar bar needs to be rendered for tile
displays. I don't think a real fix will have anything to do with the
scalar bar, but more like when a widget interaction happens, instead
of triggering a render request on the view, it has to now decide which
renderer this widget the user is interacting with lies in (since in
case of 3D widgets like implicit plane widget which is rendered on the
server side we need the regular rendering) and if it's the 2D
renderer, then do some fancy stuff to simply render locally (except in
tile-display mode) in the 2D renderer while reusing the previously
delivered image for the 3D renderer. This may just be a tad too
complex to simply handle the interaction with the scalar bar widget
use-case.

A more general purpose solution would be a mechanism to avoid
server-side renders and deliveries unless the server-side scene in the
3D renderer has changed. This will also help avoiding the re-renders
when another window that covered the ParaView window is moved or such.
But there possibly, the complexity lies in truthfully determining that
the last rendered scene is still valid.

Hi,all
Thanks for your messages,though most of them are out of my knowledge.

Some explanation of my original message. What I mean server-client is not the paraview server-client mode,but just run paraview on another machine(PC) and tunnel(or forward X11) the display on the local machine. Using this method ,I still get the bad legend.

If I run paraview directly on the PC and display it on that machine,it's ok.
If I run paraview in a virtual machine on my laptop,it's also ok.

I also have tried to build VISIT on my laptop,and I got the same problem as paraview,the messy legend.
I do not have any problem with my intel graphics card till now for other applications.The system now is FC10 with latest updates.

Best wishes.

Subject: [Paraview] forcing server to do all computations/rendering;
	unrelated, rendering 	vertices as pixels
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0909280212k277bbb10sacf9598905a679a2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two questions I am hoping someone can give me some insight on.

1. How to force the server to do all computations and rendering?
After playing around with the ParaView server settings, I haven't yet
been able to force the server to do all computations and rendering,
only sending images to the client. I want to do this for testing
purposes. Is there a way to do this easily?

2.Rendering vertices as single pixels?
I am interested in displaying the vertices of my particle datasets as
a single pixel only. I currently use the vertex glyph which is more of
a small, multi-pixel square. I can approximate pixels by using a 2d
glyph with a small scale factor but this is a bit of a hack. Is there
a better way to do this I am just missing? Or what would I need to
modify?

Thanks,
Christine

under Edit->Settings->Render View->Server

set the Remote Render Threshold to 0 and the servers will do all
rendering. An easy way to check is that during interactive rendering, if
you enable "interactive Subsample Rate", you will see fat pixels
rendered. That is the image composited server-side, then sub-sampled,
and sent over to the client for display.

As for pixels, under display tab, there is a pixel size option. The default
is 5 I think. Change that to 1 and use points representation.

Some explanation of my original message. What I mean server-client is not
the paraview server-client mode,but just run paraview on another machine(PC)
and tunnel(or forward X11) the display on the local machine. Using this
method ,I still get the bad legend.

When you forward X11 back to your local machine you are rendering locally.
The server is deciding what to draw, but it is sending X commands to the
local machine to make the client render it. This is slower than either pure
local rendering, where the local machine tells the local X display what to
draw, or pure remote rendering, where the remote machine tells the remote X
display what to draw and then sends finished images over to the client.

Hi!

I just wanted to ask if there is a possibility to play animations in paraview slower than the rendering time is? Like, you want an animation over 20 files, and the time between the files is about 1 second or so?

Thx,

Yes. Switch animation mode to Real Time and set the total time you
want it to last.

Subject: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log
In-Reply-To: <SNT106-W553B0ED72094E8AAD6FF0DABD90@phx.gbl>
Message-ID: <C6E62634.D644%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Both scenarios are wrong.  ParaView will not push out data from process 0 to processes 1-3 unless you explicitly run a filter that does that (or the reader does that internally, but I know of no such reader).  What is actually happening is more along the lines of:


 1.  Processes 0-3 each read in a partition of data from the file.
 2.  Each process extracts polygonal geometry from their local data.
 3.  Per your settings, ParaView decides to send the geometry to the client.  The data is collected to process 0 and sent to the client.

The reason you are not seeing vtkFileSeriesReader on all of the servers is that there is a threshold in the timer log to not show anything that executes under a certain amount of time (by default 0.01 seconds).  If you change the Time Threshold to Show All, you should be able to see everything that executes, even if it completes immediately.

You should note that how readers read partitions is determined by the reader itself.  Many of the readers do not really handle partitioned reading.  Thus, the reader will do something na?ve like read everything on process 0.  Based on your timings, that is probably what is happening to you.  That is, processes 1-3 probably have empty data.  You never specified what format of data you are reader, so I cannot answer the data completely.  However, if you want to know how your data is partitioned on the server (at least, before rendering), you can run the Process Ids filter.

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log, my guess is:

Scenario 1:
Process 0 reads the whole data, disseminate the dats into 4 pieces, then distribute to itself and Process 1&2&3,
each node will process the data and send it back Process 0,
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,
client renders the data

Scenario 2:
Process 0 reads the whole data, distribute the whole data to Process 0&1&2&3,
each node will 'take' their own piece of data to process, then send it back Process 0,
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,
client renders the data

Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?

is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute vtkFileSeriesReader, Execute vtkMPIMoveData?

any help / feedback is highly appreciated!
thanks!

Message-ID: <C6E6286E.D64A%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The class that manages the camera position is the VTK class vtkCamera.  Although internally it transform coordinate systems to place objects, all parameters for vtkCamera (and all other VTK classes) are defined in world space.

If you want to change the coordinate systems of one of the objects in ParaView, you can use the Transform filter.  There are also some transformation controls in the Display panel of each object.

Hi

Does anyone know how different coordination systems is being handled in ParaView and How paraview keeps track of the the transformation from one to another one!
Here is my train of thoughts, well in any 3D Visualization system we have a "Point of View" which I think in ParaView is handled with a Class (ParaView uses the term Camera I think) which I assume it is in a different coordinate system than Our actual scene! (I would actually like to know name of and the location of the camera class in ParaView Source if you know where it is please do let me know)
Further more, we might have more than an object which we are visualizing (reading off of vtk file) and they might be in different coordinate systems how does ParaView handle this? which class is used to handle this kind of differences and how ParaView keeps the track of these transforms? Any specific Proxy or Super class is used here to handle this?

I would appreciate any help or comment!

(Replying back to ParaView list).

I was not suggesting that your file system has anything to do with D3.  D3 never accesses your file system.  What I was saying was that the only thing I can think of that might be wrong is that perhaps there is something wrong with the reader.  Perhaps the reader is reading the same data on every processes instead of reading a piece of the data on each process.  Then, perhaps, D3 is having trouble realizing that all the data is replicated.  This is just speculation, though.

What does it look like when you run the Process Id filter before D3?

Thank you for your reply.

We did build PV 3.6.1 with OSMesa using Mesa-7.5.1 but were unable to make it work. As far as I remember PV would not launch on remote nodes, and we gave up on figuring out why. I do not recall the specifics of the problem. Also, since every node in the cluster does have rendering hardware, OSMesa should be a last resort anyway.

The data is initially replicated everywhere in that it is present in a folder on the node where the client runs and this folder is exported via NFS to all other nodes. I do not understand why this should confuse D3, at least I would expect any confusion to be the same in either case ?

Hi thanks a lot, that worked perfectly for single pixel rendering;
somehow I had tried several dozen combinations of the display settings
while overlooking that one.

Subject: [Paraview] caching images (WAS: messy legend)
In-Reply-To: <7ba9d6a30909271211i79b9ac2v8519e62129dc2c67@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C6E63CB1.D660%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Rather than preventing renderings for the specific case of delivering images from the server, I am an advocate of caching the rendering in all cases.  The interaction with scalar bars and other 2D widgets is a big reason for why I would like to see this.

We have talked about doing this for a long time (see bug #3924) and actually had an implementation for a brief period of time.  The problem was that we kept grabbing things that we did not render, for example other windows on top of the render window.  Now might be a good time to readdress this though.  We have already spent a lot of work getting the screen capturing working for saving screen shots.  Perhaps we could apply this work to caching images for every still render to save on re-rendering.

Well, don't forget the scalar bar needs to be rendered for tile
displays. I don't think a real fix will have anything to do with the
scalar bar, but more like when a widget interaction happens, instead
of triggering a render request on the view, it has to now decide which
renderer this widget the user is interacting with lies in (since in
case of 3D widgets like implicit plane widget which is rendered on the
server side we need the regular rendering) and if it's the 2D
renderer, then do some fancy stuff to simply render locally (except in
tile-display mode) in the 2D renderer while reusing the previously
delivered image for the 3D renderer. This may just be a tad too
complex to simply handle the interaction with the scalar bar widget
use-case.

A more general purpose solution would be a mechanism to avoid
server-side renders and deliveries unless the server-side scene in the
3D renderer has changed. This will also help avoiding the re-renders
when another window that covered the ParaView window is moved or such.
But there possibly, the complexity lies in truthfully determining that
the last rendered scene is still valid.

Hi Jean,

I had previously done this, as well as the test (for my test I set the
pixel size to 20, and I clearly see the large ones during interaction)
but when I run the timer log, the rendering always shows up as a local
process while if I do analysis (thresholding on a variable value for
example) it does show up in the Server section under each process.

*E.g. for some interactive rendering I get
Local Process
Interactive Render,  0.111477 seconds
Interactive Render,  0.094096 seconds
...
Still Render,  1.2302 seconds
Server, Process 0
Server, Process 1
Server, Process 2
Server, Process 3

While for a threshold I get
Local Process
Interactive Render,  0.111477 seconds
..
Still Render,  1.2302 seconds
Still Render,  0.116044 seconds
Server, Process 0
Execute vtkThreshold id: 2054,  1.04218 seconds
Execute vtkPVGeometryFilter id: 2087,  0.020597 seconds
Server, Process 1
Execute vtkThreshold id: 2054,  0.987578 seconds
Execute vtkPVGeometryFilter id: 2087,  0.020291 seconds
...

I do get server processes in the timer log but only when I first open the file:
Server, Process 0
Execute vtkTipsyReader id: 2664,  2.84199 seconds
Execute vtkPVGeometryFilter id: 2712,  0.062723 seconds
...

After that, during and after interaction I do not see server processes
appearing in the log. This made me think that after this point, the
rendering was done on the client. Is the timer log not behaving as I
expected?

Ok, I see what you mean.

This is actually a very good guess. I _did_ try to run the ProcessId filter before the D3 filter, but I noticed that most (roughly 95%) of all cells were allocated to process 0, and the rest scattered over the remaining nodes with less and less for increasing process IDs. Therefore, I swapped the order of the filters thinking this would correct matters. But it only did so in case 1.

Hello,

I have a set of particles that I can visualize using unstructured data and the gliph 'sphere', i.e. I have their position x,y,z. Is it possible to color the particles using a velocity field? The magnitude of the velocity (which I have on a structured grid) can be attached to the particle, for example, for any particle I can have the position and velocity, x,y,z,v

The questions are:(1) can I color the particles using their velocity, and (2) if the previous comment is true, what type of format should I use? I am currently using asci vtk legacy.

Thanks!
Rafael

Message-ID: <20090928183035.M29702@math.asu.edu>

Hello 

I was wondering if it is possible to invert the grayscale that is set by
default in paraview, the lowest value is black and the highest is white. How
can I invert it?

thanks!

In the color editor, after having chosen the grayscale, double click
on the two sphere at the end of the color bar to change the colors at
the two end points to invert the scale to go from while to black. Then
either save this as a new preset for re-use later or click "Make
Defauilt" so that this LUT will be used by default the next time a new
array is chosen for scalar coloring.

You should be able to color particles like you color any other type of data.  Simply choose the field to color by.

Ken,
many thanks, maybe what I need is a very simple example on how to do this using vtk legacy file? Here is a sample of what I have (I do not have the velocity field there, as I do not know how to put it there).

Simply add a POINT_DATA section that defines fields on the points.  For example

POINT_DATA  10000
VECTORS velocity float
  1.1 0.3 0.2
  0.3 1.2 0.7
...

Subject: [Paraview] Time-aware custom reader method to update filename in
 information tab?
Message-ID: <4AC1095D.8020408@web.de>

Hi,

What method/xml does a custom reader using vtkFileSeriesReader need to
provide in order to see the file name change in the information tab of
the object inspector? The reader posted in
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013719.html,
e.g., does always show the name of the first file of the sequence.

For *.vtu files, the file name does change, but I failed so far to find
the magic in VTK/IO/vtkXML*Reader.{h,cxx}

Thanks a lot
Karl

Subject: [Paraview] Duplicate entry in slice type drop-down list of filter
	PlotOnIntersectionCurves
Message-ID: <4AC1134C.9000403@web.de>

Hi,

Is there a way to get rid of the duplicate entry "Plane" in the
drop-down list slice type of the filter Plot On Intersection Curves that
has been added to PV-CVS since 3.6.1?
Thought I could contribute a tiny bit and tried to create a patch by
extending the according <Hints> section in
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml using <... show="0"> or
<Visibility ...>, but that didn't work.

On the object-inspector-panel (the one which has the "apply" button),
there's a tab titled, "Information". That tab has information about the
number of cells. points, data bounds etc.

Please keep cc-ing the mailing list so others can contribute to the
discussion as well.

Nope, that's not normal. This is why you are not seeing anything, your
data has no bounds. Split the view, create the "spreadsheet view" and
inspect the data. Does it look like what you expected?

Definetely not, for some points the pressure and the velocity are  
indicated as "Not a Number".

Subject: [Paraview] Extending pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel for custom reader?
Message-ID: <4AC13CBE.6040405@web.de>

Hi,

I felt bold today and tried to extend the automatically created panel
for my custom reader. According to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CustomObjectPanels,
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_an_object_panel and
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/8/8a/PV_Vis09_Tut_Plugins.pdf it
shouldn't be too difficult. For the ConePanel example everything worked
as expected, but it seems I'm doing something wrong when porting things
to a custom reader: Its panel isn't altered and the debugger shows that
the extra code is never visited. Hopefully someone can point me into the
right direction.

I changed the CMakeLists.txt (from the tarball in
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013719.html,
just in case) to

[...]
IF (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI)
    QT4_WRAP_CPP(MOC_SRCS pqFooReaderPanel.h)

    ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL(IFACES IFACE_SRCS
      CLASS_NAME pqFooReaderPanel
      XML_NAME FooReader # name of SourceProxy in SM xml
      XML_GROUP sources
      )

    ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(FooReaderPlugin "0.1"
      SERVER_MANAGER_XML FooReaderSM.xml
      SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkFooReader.cxx
      GUI_INTERFACES ${IFACES}
      GUI_SOURCES ${MOC_SRCS} ${UI_SRCS} ${IFACE_SRCS}
      GUI_RESOURCE_FILES FooReaderGUI.xml
      )
ENDIF (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI)
[...]

and added a file pqFooReaderPanel.h with

#ifndef __pqFooReaderPanel_h
#define __pqFooReaderPanel_h
#include "pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel.h"
#include <QLabel>
#include <QLayout>

/// Custom panel for FooReader source.
/// This panel is only provided to add capabilities to hide/gray out
/// GUI elements in case they do not apply.
class pqFooReaderPanel : public pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel
{
  Q_OBJECT;
  typedef pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel Superclass;

public:
  pqFooReaderPanel(pqProxy *proxy, QWidget *p) :
    pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel(proxy, p)
    {
      this->layout()->addWidget(new QLabel("This is from a plugin", this));
    }
  //virtual ~pqFooReaderPanel();

protected:
};
#endif //__pqFooReaderPanel_h

Having studied Qt/Components/pqClipPanel.cxx and
Qt/Components/pqGlyphPanel.cxx I think I know how to proceed from here,
but I cannot figure out how to tell PV to execute this tiny piece of
code when running my custom reader. I doubt I have to create the panel
from scratch using Qt Designer and providing a complete new *.ui file
for this purpose.

Thanks a lot in advance for any hints.
Karl

Hi Christine,

This is expected. The renders are always initiated by the client
(through user action) and the timer log is recording this fact. The
number the timer log is reporting is the total time it takes for the
client to tell the server to render, the server to render in parallel,
to composite and to send the image to the client and finally for the
client to display this image.

Subject: [Paraview] Streamlines error - "Coincident points..."
Message-ID: <160838103@web.de>

Thanks for helping the last time, the data is working now. Almost.

I've got a *.pvtr grid with the velocity vector defined at each point. By computing the steam traces i get this message:

"Process id: xyz >> Generic Warning: In /work/home0/dolescha/src/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkPolyLine.cxx, line 196
Coincident points in polyline...can't compute normals"

But still ParaView draws the streamlines.

I thought of a connection to the coincident points at the borders of subdomains, but it seems that ghostlevel -1 is not allowed. So do I have to change the definition of velocity at the cells instead of points? Or is the source of the problem something different?

There seemed to be a similar problem with the subject "[Paraview] Stream tracing" - but unfortunately no (public) solution.

Are you sure the FooReader proxy is created as expected when you open
the file you want to read?

Are you using binaries released that we released? In that case, they
are not compiled with mpi, so you'll have to build from source.
If the pvserver is not mpi-enabled, trying to run it with mpi will
result in multiple server processes being started and all will try to
latch to the same server port, only one will succeed and others will
show error messages and quit.

Utkarsh,

Could you please define "is created as expected"?
As far as I define it, it is:
The plugin gets successfully loaded, the file extension *.foo appears in the list of supported file types, when opening such a *.foo file the reader itself is definitely called as both FooReader::RequestInformation and FooReader::RequestData print messages to the screen using std:cout. But the panel remains unaltered.

If it makes things easier, I could post the complete package which can be tested using copy-and-paste like this:
  tar -xvzf FooReader.tar.gz
  cd FooReader
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DParaView_DIR:STRING=<path to paraview cvs build>
  make
  gdb --args paraview --data=../sampleinputfiles/sametimes..foo

That'd be great if you can post the tar ball. Makes it easier to debug.

Where are trying to locate the reader? Did try doing File | Open?
Isn't *.edgeface shown as a supported extension?

Any way of making the dataset available to us? Possibly your datafile
is incorrect.

This is a task that may be a bit too complex for python programmable
filter.  Try looking at C++ code for filters such as
vtkTemporalInterpolator (in ParaView/VTK/Hybrid). That should serve as
a good starting point.

Here you go. You'll need a recent CVS build as the CMakeLists.txt has only been adapted to support a customized panel for PV 3.7 so far and the PV 3.7 section in CMakeLists.txt relies on vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx revision >= 1.17

Is VolumeData coming from another library? If so, set your PATH
environment variable to include the directory where the dll for the
VolumeData shared library is present. Does that help?

I could not find any test for IntegrateAttributes, and I am questioning
the output generated when run in parallel, on a 2D surface mesh.
Although the area computed is equal to the area computed by the serial
builtin paraview, some other variables (but not all) show large
differences in integrated values. The results depend on the number of
processors used as well.

I have tested with some physical data which we have validated and the
serial integrations are correct. The parallel runs are not.

I have also tested with some simple Wavelet data, and by using a D3
before the integration filter, insuring that cells were assigned uniquely.

My questions are: How are the results of IntegrateAttributes validated?
Is there a test somewhere? What about parallel runs?

Thanks for any tips.

 <Argument value="-l select=$NUMPROC$:ncpus=4:mpiprocs=$PTILE$"/>

I can substitute either $NUMPROC$ or $PTILE$, but not both .... I get a 
blank string returned if I try two variables.   Is this a know bug, and 
more importantly, is there a workaround????

You load the dataset, select the animation view and put it to real time, and when playing, the images are not rendered, so you just see the first frame over the whol e animation. 
When I get back to work, I can zip a timeseries and mail it to you, if you want

This should work with any reader that supports time.  I don?t know of any reason why it should not work with xdmf, but I don?t have an example xdmf dataset that has time.  Could you describe the erroneous behavior?

Hey Natalie,

I can reproduce this with PV 3.6.1, but it works fine in CVS now. I  
think it's been fixed because of all the recent work on the XDMF  
libraries.

It used to be that the vtkXdmfReader defaulted to the first data frame  
(time step) if it was ever asked for a time step which didn't really  
exist. (This is in contrast to something like the PVD reader which  
would default to the previous valid time step.) I'm guessing that this  
is why the Real Time and Sequence don't work right with 3.6.1 --  
they're asking for non-existing time steps and being given time step 0.

As a workaround, place a "Temporal Snap-to-Time-step filter after your  
XDMF reader in the pipeline, and set it to NextBelowOrEqual and things  
should work right.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hey Ken,

I always get this same error, but I've never been able to use this  
type of shader on my Mac, even with PV Meshless. I always figured  
(that through my ignorance) it was either a problem with the way I  
built PV, or some lack of features in my video card. (As with yours,  
SimplePoint and Texture work fine for me.)

Talk to you later,

Subject: [Paraview] [Bug?] Loading/importing a Paraview state resets the
 colors & representation of existing scene objects
Message-ID: <4AC29F68.6000604@web.de>

Hi -

I may have found another Paraview (3.6.1) bug -- not sure if it a bug or 
a feature, or if it has been reported. Basically, when a Paraview state 
is loaded into a non-empty scene, the color attributes of the existing 
objects are reset to the default white. Here's how to reproduce this bug 
(note, all the color changes below are done in the object inspector):

1. create a sample object e.g. a sphere, set its color (to red for 
example), and save the state to a *.pvsm file

2. Clear the scene and create a new object e.g. a cube, set its color 
(to blue for example), and its representation to wireframe.

3. Import/load the state saved in step 1. The process hides the blue, 
wireframe cube (nice feature).

4. Make the existing object visible. Result: its color has been reset to 
white, and its representation (from wireframe) to surface

On the subject of color, here's something odd that I noticed. Again, it 
may be a matter of design but it seems a bit inconsistent to me. Its 
best demonstrated by the following two-part example:

Part I:
   - create an object e.g. a sphere
   - set its (solid) color (to blue for example)
   - switch the representation to wireframe
   - Result: wireframe appears white!

Part II:
   - Still in wireframe mode, set the ambient color to red
   - Switch to surface with edges' representation
   - Result: wireframe and surface appear blue!!

BTW, I'm aware that color type in wireframe representation is given the 
name "ambient", as opposed to "solid" as in the surface representation.

Utkarsh,

the problem appears to occur *only* when one of the objects in the scene 
uses the wireframe representation, *and* the resolution of the exported 
screenshot is larger than that of the current view.

Message-ID: <20090930.165113.205356137.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I have had a problem of ridiculously slow D3 of PV 3.6.1/3.7-cvs under
some conditions. Most of the time the problem occurs when I have more
pvserver processes than the number of data pieces, in which case D3
takes two orders of magnitude more time than usual, despite that the
resulting repartitioned dataset looks fine.

Attaching a performance analyzer (Apple's Shark) to the pvserver
processes revealed that, in one of the pvserver processes
vtkMergePoints::InsertUniquePoint() took up virtually all of the
processor time, as attached sharkOutput.jpg.

It further turned out that this is because the instance of
vtkMergePoints is given indeterminate bounds by its caller
vtkMergeCells::MapPointsToIdsUsingLocator() and hence hashing based on
relative point coordinates in the bounds is not working. Here is a
proposed fix to the problem (the comment "points0->GetNumberOfPoints()
is equal to..." was taken from about 50 lines below the patched lines
in the same function. I believe it explains everything.).

Dear Ken, 

thanks for the reply. i have one more question to ask.
in the timer log, the first 3 lines:

--------------------------------------------------
Local Process

Still Render, 3.029 seconds

Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 457, 1.98248 seconds
--------------------------------------------------

does these mean that, at the client's end, it took 3.029 seconds to renders the geometry send back from process 0?
what does still render means? how about the third line? after still render, why does the MPI need to move data? which data? to where?

i tried running the same data using np1 until np10, and i get the following reading for still render, the
rest of the readings are quite consistent, which makes me wonder why
the time (still render) decrease initially but increase eventually? shouldn't it
become much faster when more nodes are used? all my server nodes are identical to each other (intel core 2 duo, 2.66 GHz)

Re: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log


Both scenarios are wrong.  ParaView will not push out data from process 0 to processes 1-3 unless you explicitly run a filter that does that (or the reader does that internally, but I know of no such reader).  What is actually happening is more along the lines of:



Processes 0-3 each read in a partition of data from the file.
Each process extracts polygonal geometry from their local data.
Per your settings, ParaView decides to send the geometry to the client.  The data is collected to process 0 and sent to the client.



The reason you are not seeing vtkFileSeriesReader on all of the servers is that there is a threshold in the timer log to not show anything that executes under a certain amount of time (by default 0.01 seconds).  If you change the Time Threshold to Show All, you should be able to see everything that executes, even if it completes immediately.



You should note that how readers read partitions is determined by the reader itself.  Many of the readers do not really handle partitioned reading.  Thus, the reader will do something na?ve like read everything on process 0.  Based on your timings, that is probably what is happening to you.  That is, processes 1-3 probably have empty data.  You never specified what format of data you are reader, so I cannot answer the data completely.  However, if you want to know how your data is partitioned on the server (at least, before rendering), you can run the Process Ids filter.

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log, my guess is:

 

Scenario 1: 

Process 0 reads the whole data, disseminate the dats into 4 pieces, then distribute to itself and Process 1&2&3,

each node will process the data and send it back Process 0,

Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,

client renders the data

 

Scenario 2:

Process 0 reads the whole data, distribute the whole data to Process 0&1&2&3,

each node will 'take' their own piece of data to process, then send it back Process 0,

Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,

client renders the data

   

Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?

 

is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute vtkFileSeriesReader, Execute vtkMPIMoveData?

 

any help / feedback is highly appreciated!

thanks!

I believe the 3.029 seconds includes the transfer time, but I may be
incorrect on that. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.

While you drag the mouse and move the camera paraview does interactive
renders. Iteractive renders will (depending on data and the preference
settings) use subsampled geometry and subsampled images. Once you release
the mouse, ParaView does a still render at full resolution.

See answer to question 1, the MPI time (and processing) is being counted as
part of the rendering. Since it is "part of" the rendering, it shows up
after in the log (even if it happened first).

Geometry (the surface of whatever your data is).

Message-ID: <CA35FF1E-876A-499E-9583-0F6F8C24EA0B@cs.duke.edu>

Hey all,

For the past month or so I've been having trouble getting CVS ParaView  
to build completely. I always get an error when it gets to the linking  
of vtkSMExtractDocumentation:

Linking CXX executable ../../bin/vtkSMExtractDocumentation
Undefined symbols:
   "vtksys::RegularExpression::compile(char const*)", referenced from:
       FilterDescription(std::basic_string<char,

(... I can send the rest if it would be helpful...)

With "make -k" I can still get it to continue far enough to build the  
ParaView application, so it hasn't been critical, but it's a bit of a  
pain. Does anyone have a clue whether I'm just choosing some bad  
options, or something?

Here is my configuration and the changes I make to the default options  
in CMake (just doing a pretty basic serial build w/python enabled):

You can safely ignore the warning. It is saying that the streamlines
filter create coincident (or very close) points. This sometimes
happens in stagnation areas. By the way, are you running 3.6 or the
development from cvs? The development version has some improvements
that may resolve the issue altogether.

Hmmm. I wonder this is somehow ghost level related. Do you have a
dataset and an example pipeline that demonstrates the problem?

Subject: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log
In-Reply-To: <SNT106-W228E68259FF9FC6FB654CBABD40@phx.gbl>
Message-ID: <C6E8CFF7.D7BE%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The still render measures the time from when the render is initiated to the time when the render completes.  In client/server mode, this can include communication and parallel overhead costs.

ParaView has two types of renders: still render and interactive render.  Interactive renders occur while you are interacting with the 3D view by moving the mouse.  It tries to maintain interactive rendering rates.  Still renders happen after interaction stops to give a full resolution view of your data.

The vtkMPIMoveData filter is a special filter that collects poly data on the server and pushes it to the client.  ParaView settings determine when this happens.  Generally when the size of the data is below a certain threshold, then ParaView will push the data to the client.

Dear Ken,

thanks for the reply. i have one more question to ask.
in the timer log, the first 3 lines:

--------------------------------------------------
Local Process
Still Render, 3.029 seconds
Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 457, 1.98248 seconds
--------------------------------------------------

does these mean that, at the client's end, it took 3.029 seconds to renders the geometry send back from process 0?
what does still render means? how about the third line? after still render, why does the MPI need to move data? which data? to where?

i tried running the same data using np1 until np10, and i get the following reading for still render, the rest of the readings are quite consistent, which makes me wonder why the time (still render) decrease initially but increase eventually? shouldn't it become much faster when more nodes are used? all my server nodes are identical to each other (intel core 2 duo, 2.66 GHz)


----------------------------------------------
number of process used still render (seconds)
np1 7.16043
np2 3.93390
np3 3.05784
np4 3.02900
np5 3.02851
np6 3.04962
np7 3.43479
np8 3.47883
np9 3.71554
np10 3.80835
----------------------------------------------


appreciate your reply!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log

Re: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log Both scenarios are wrong.  ParaView will not push out data from process 0 to processes 1-3 unless you explicitly run a filter that does that (or the reader does that internally, but I know of no such reader).  What is actually happening is more along the lines of:


 1.  Processes 0-3 each read in a partition of data from the file.
 2.  Each process extracts polygonal geometry from their local data.
 3.  Per your settings, ParaView decides to send the geometry to the client.  The data is collected to process 0 and sent to the client.

The reason you are not seeing vtkFileSeriesReader on all of the servers is that there is a threshold in the timer log to not show anything that executes under a certain amount of time (by default 0.01 seconds).  If you change the Time Threshold to Show All, you should be able to see everything that executes, even if it completes immediately.

You should note that how readers read partitions is determined by the reader itself.  Many of the readers do not really handle partitioned reading.  Thus, the reader will do something na?ve like read everything on process 0.  Based on your timings, that is probably what is happening to you.  That is, processes 1-3 probably have empty data.  You never specified what format of data you are reader, so I cannot answer the data completely.  However, if you want to know how your data is partitioned on the server (at least, before rendering), you can run the Process Ids filter.

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log, my guess is:

Scenario 1:
Process 0 reads the whole data, disseminate the dats into 4 pieces, then distribute to itself and Process 1&2&3,
each node will process the data and send it back Process 0,
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,
client renders the data

Scenario 2:
Process 0 reads the whole data, distribute the whole data to Process 0&1&2&3,
each node will 'take' their own piece of data to process, then send it back Process 0,
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,
client renders the data

Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?

is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute vtkFileSeriesReader, Execute vtkMPIMoveData?

any help / feedback is highly appreciated!
thanks!

Hi,

I have had a problem of ridiculously slow D3 of PV 3.6.1/3.7-cvs under
some conditions. Most of the time the problem occurs when I have more
pvserver processes than the number of data pieces, in which case D3
takes two orders of magnitude more time than usual, despite that the
resulting repartitioned dataset looks fine.

Attaching a performance analyzer (Apple's Shark) to the pvserver
processes revealed that, in one of the pvserver processes
vtkMergePoints::InsertUniquePoint() took up virtually all of the
processor time, as attached sharkOutput.jpg.

It further turned out that this is because the instance of
vtkMergePoints is given indeterminate bounds by its caller
vtkMergeCells::MapPointsToIdsUsingLocator() and hence hashing based on
relative point coordinates in the bounds is not working. Here is a
proposed fix to the problem (the comment "points0->GetNumberOfPoints()
is equal to..." was taken from about 50 lines below the patched lines
in the same function. I believe it explains everything.).

The GLSL compiler on the Mac tends to be more picky about types and
such. I have seen problems like this before and Francois could always
fix it by changing the code. So I'd suspect the compiler rather than
the card not supporting a feature.

Yeah.  Out of curiosity I tried to make changes to the shader code to compile correctly.  I eventually got it to compile but that caused ParaView to crash, which is even worse.  At this point I gave up.

I submitted a bug report.

Takuya:

    The problem was reflected on Mantis (issue #009626) and the suggested
fix was applied. If you have any test (and shareable datasets), please feel
free to submit it via Mantis.

    Thanks for the report and the fix.

Attached is a patch that should fix this issue. Let me know if that
