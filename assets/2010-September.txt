Yes, there are ways to "spoof" monitors on nvidia cards. I have used two of them,

a. Get an EDID file of a display device and use that in the config file (see attached file xorg-forced-monitor-EDID.conf for an example).

b. Use a modeline (see attached file xorg-forced-monitor-modeline.conf for an example).

The config files use more options than necessary - but that's because they are auto-generated.

For documentation on the options, refer to /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README.txt

Hi Paul,

I think you are stuck with eitther a Tesla or Quadro on a cluster. This is due to the ability to configure those cards to work without a display (see the release notes for the latest drivers though).

I'd be interested to hear otherwise as we have a few GTX280 nodes that are currently just used for CUDA. Maybe there is a way to "spoof" a monitor another way?

Cheers,

Paul

Hi,

Can anyone recommend a graphics cards to use for a linux cluster running ParaView?  And, does anyone know how a GeForce card compares to a Quadro of a similar spec?

Thanks in advance,

'Generate Surface Normals' requires a vtkPolyData as input. Run 'Extract
Surface' which will give you a vtkPolyData, which you can generate surface
normals from.

Running GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet on a scalar will give you a vector.
You may have to compute the velocity magnitude first and store it as a
variable before trying to compute the gradient. You can do this using the
calculator with a function 'mag(v)' naming it something creative like say
'mag_v', then selecting mag_v as your input to the gradient computor.

Similarly, to compute the dot product of two vectors, in the calculator it
is simply '(Normals).(grad_mag_v)'.

Subject: [Paraview] Computing a normal derivative of velocity

Dear ParaView users and developers,

  I have an output file of a Finite Element code, which contains a fluid
velocity vector field. I would like to plot the values of dv/dn on the walls
of my domain. My idea was this: plot a gradient of velocity magnitude,
generate surface normals and then compute the scalar product (grad(v),n).
Unfortunately, I have several problems:  
when I plot the gradient of velocity
(Filters->GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet), I have a scalar field of gradient
magnitude (I guess), but no vector field, even though mathematically
speaking, grad(scalar) results in a vector. Could you tell me how to
generate a vector field where the vector components are
(grad(v)_x,grad(v)_y,grad(v)_z) ?

Second, I don't understand why Filters->Generate Surface Normals is disabled
when I load my data file (in Ensight format). The only way of plotting some
normals is using 'glyphs', but these glyphs are then not available in the
'Calculator' filter which I wanted to use to compute the final scalar
product (grad(v),n). One strange thing I also noticed is that the glyphs are
not plotted on a part of the domain boundary (which is smooth).

Could you please give me a hint how to obtain the plot of dv/dn ?

Thank you.

  Martin Vymazal

Thanks for the replies.

Can anyone comment on whether there is a performance difference between the
GeForce or Quadro?  Some sites say the Quadro is better for CAD applications
but is this true for ParaView?

Thanks,
Paul

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=uSKE9AvZkqSp9WeJR8-7k8hi0=PZ2YXQ86QtU@mail.gmail.com>

High,

I'm using ParaView 3.8.

I have written a VTK file with timestep information with VTK (XML file).
When I open the file in ParaView, the timestep information are displayed in
the Object Inspector View (Propreties, Display Information).
For each timestep, the Information widget displays an index and a value. But
the value is always the same as the index...

I look at the code for vtkXMLReader, and it seems that the reader stores
only the index, not the value...
Is it possible to display these values in the ParaView Widget without
writing code ?

Here is an beginning of my file xhere you can see the TimeValues :

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <UnstructuredGrid  TimeValues="
10.56
20.4324
">

Any idea ?

Kind regards,
Ptibou

Subject: [Paraview] List to select zones in object panel for a custom reader
Message-ID: <AANLkTimY=pw=OOzNW_Q+DKdo1W_A++RJ306pXoRrWW9p@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a reader and would like to have a list box in the object panel to
select which zones to read in from the file.  The number of zones can change
depending on the file.  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to do this?
 My ideas were:

   - add a new vtkSM*Domain
      - I don't think this is possible in a plugin because pqSMAdaptor needs
      to be updated for any new class (is that right?)
   - create a custom panel and have one information only property to get the
   number of zones and another property to set the zones
      - would the set property need to be a string that I put
      comma-separated zone indexes or is there a way to change the number of
      elements in an integer vector?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

May I suggest the following syntax? use a file with suffic .pvd and describe the collection with the following list. You may specify all timestep values explicitly

Paul,

Why is this any different from array-selection already provided by many readers?

Quadro drivers tend to come with optimizations for commercial applications
like AutoCAD. VTK/ParaView just make standard GL calls so you won't gain
anything by using a similarly configured Quadro over a GeForce card. On the
other hand, Quadro's tend to have faster GPUs and more memory. If you don't
need lots of GPU memory, GeForce cards in general offer a pretty good
cost/performance tradeoff.

In my mind, it is quite different. At least for CFD applications, where a hierarchy of blocks is the general case.

2 cents from my side

Try setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to contain the paths that have the
vtk and paraview libs.  Setting the sys.path tells python where to find the
python modules (libvtk*Python.so) but those have dependencies on the regular
libs (libvtk*.so and libvtk*PythonD.so) that must be resolved with
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Are you using python or pvpython?  Usually pvpython does some extra work so
you don't have to set the environment variable yourself.  You can see this
if you run pvpython and type-

import os
print os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]

I've generated an ASCII TECPLOT file with the following variables: x, y, 
z, rho, rho-u, rho-v, rho-w, rho-e. The header for the file is shown 
below: 

VARIABLES= "x" "y" "z" "rho" "rho-u" "rho-v" "rho-w" "rho-e"
DATASETAUXDATA Common.DensityVar="4"
DATASETAUXDATA Common.UVar="5"
DATASETAUXDATA Common.VVar="6"
DATASETAUXDATA Common.WVar="7"
DATASETAUXDATA Common.VectorVarsAreVelocity="FALSE"

When this file is opened in Tecplot the rho-u, rho-v, rho-w terms are 
properly identified as vector variables so the magnitude and vectors, and 
streamlines can be plotted. 

When the file is opened in Paraview the rho-u, rho-v, rho-w terms are 
scalars. The magnitude can be calculated with the calculator filter, but I 
cannot plot vector glyphs or streamlines. 

Is there any way to re-identify these scalar variables as a vector in 
Paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] Error reading PLOT3D q-file
Message-ID: <OF86E7653B.E8FDD885-ON85257791.004655DF-85257791.00479C07@CHROMALLOY.COM>

I am attempting to read a binary PLOT3D grid and result files using 
Paraview. The file was generated using unformatted Fortran write 
statements. The file will read into Paraview with the following settings:
Binary, Has Byte Count, LittleEndian, Force Read. However, Paraview seems 
to be reading an extra two values from the q-file in the i-index direction 
shifting the result by two grid points. 

Specifically, the results are CFD results for a turbine airfoil and the 
shift in the solution is evident along a line extending from the trailing 
edge of the airfoil. The grid has coincident nodes along this line and the 
results are continuous across this line. However when I plot in Paraview 
the results are shifted downstream by two grid points. The file can be 
plotted properly in both Fieldview and Tecplot. 

Any ideas on why Paraview is misreading the result file? 
Is there a bug in the Plot3D Reader? 
Is there a specific Plot3D format that Paraview can read properly? 

I can send screen dumps if it would help, but I wasn't sure if attachments 
were discouraged on the mailing list.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Surface LIC
Message-ID: <5ED9044701A7DA499E9A3740DE53467E04CEAAF3@lola2003svr2>

 
Hi,

I've just joined this list and have had a look through a few of the
previous postings on Surface LIC but can't find anything that solves my
problem.
 
I was using Paraview on an AMD 64 Linux machine running opensuse 10.2
and the graphics card is a Quadro FX1700.  I had no problems producing
surface LIC plots on this.
 
I have now upgraded the OS on this machine to opensuse 11.1 and have
used the latest graphics driver for my card.  I now cannot produce
surface LIC plots and paraview crashes if I try.
 
There are reasons why I would prefer not to have to go back to opensuse
10.2 and so need to get paraview working properly on my new setup.  The
problem must be to do with the graphics card and the new OS.  Has
anybody come across this before and know of a solution?
 
Thanks,
 
Phil

Although I think DATASETAUXDATA is read in, I don't believe anything is done
with the information in ParaView. It's fairly simple to create a vector
though:
 
Equation = "UVar*iHat + VVar*jHat + WVar*kHat"
 
Hope this helps.

High Jean,

Yes, I think you're right, but for my project it is a requirement to use one
and only one file...
I use the VTK class vtkXMLWriterC to write all my data in a unique file with
all time.

  Hi Phil,


i had nearly the same problem with crashing ParaView (currently using 
OpenSuse 11.2 / FX1700). In my case going back to the 185.18.31 driver 
solves the problem ... do not use the newest driver.

Best regards,

Although I think DATASETAUXDATA is read in, I don't believe anything is 
done with the information in ParaView. It's fairly simple to create a 
vector though:
 
Equation = "UVar*iHat + VVar*jHat + WVar*kHat"
 
Hope this helps.

Subject: [Paraview] TECPLOT Vector Variables

I've generated an ASCII TECPLOT file with the following variables: x, y, 
z, rho, rho-u, rho-v, rho-w, rho-e. The header for the file is shown 
below: 

VARIABLES= "x" "y" "z" "rho" "rho-u" "rho-v" "rho-w" "rho-e" 
DATASETAUXDATA Common.DensityVar="4" 
DATASETAUXDATA Common.UVar="5" 
DATASETAUXDATA Common.VVar="6" 
DATASETAUXDATA Common.WVar="7" 
DATASETAUXDATA Common.VectorVarsAreVelocity="FALSE" 

When this file is opened in Tecplot the rho-u, rho-v, rho-w terms are 
properly identified as vector variables so the magnitude and vectors, and 
streamlines can be plotted. 

When the file is opened in Paraview the rho-u, rho-v, rho-w terms are 
scalars. The magnitude can be calculated with the calculator filter, but I 
cannot plot vector glyphs or streamlines. 

Is there any way to re-identify these scalar variables as a vector in 
Paraview?

Ah, it seems the array_list is exactly what I need.

Is there anywhere with documentation for the XML?  I've needed to look
through the source code of other filters to realise that using:

      <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="*NAME*"/>

uses the following methods in the class:

      int GetNumberOf*NAME*Arrays()
      const char* Get*NAME*ArrayName(int)
      int Get*NAME*ArrayStatus(const char*)
      void Set*NAME*ArrayStatus(const char*, int)

I've also noticed the SIL stuff too - is there any documentation on that as
it would be quite nice to select by properties for CFD solutions, e.g.
surface types, zone number, rotational speed, etc.

Thanks,
Paul

Hi,
 
Thanks for all of the replies.  I just downloaded and installed the
185.18.31 driver and it all seems fine now.  You definitely don't want
to use any of the newer drivers!
 
Many thanks,

You don't necessarily need to do a lot of heavy coding.

One simple way to transfer variable length data such as the list of 
selected zone ids from client to server is via a string vector property. 
On the client side you will need a custom panel that handles 
serialization of the list of zones into the string vector property. On 
the server side parse the string during request data phase. A format like:

"nZoneIds Zone1Id Zone2Id ... ZoneNId".

Would do the trick, and would be compatible with PV state.

Hi,

There are a few differences between GeForce and Quadro cards : 
Quadro support quad-buffering, which is usefull if you want to have 
stereo. The newer geforce cards may support it also due to the current 
buzz around stereo.
There is also support of g-sync cards, which can be usefull on 
tiled-displays + stereo systems.
We noticed some performance differences for wireframe representations : it 
seems that quadro are faster than geforce for this kind of representations 
(which is kind of logical since those representations are not often used 
in games...)

Best,
Stephane

Re: [Paraview] Advice on graphics cards






Quadro drivers tend to come with optimizations for commercial applications 
like AutoCAD. VTK/ParaView just make standard GL calls so you won't gain 
anything by using a similarly configured Quadro over a GeForce card. On 
the other hand, Quadro's tend to have faster GPUs and more memory. If you 
don't need lots of GPU memory, GeForce cards in general offer a pretty 
good cost/performance tradeoff.

Can anyone comment on whether there is a performance difference between 
the GeForce or Quadro?  Some sites say the Quadro is better for CAD 
applications but is this true for ParaView?

Thanks,

Hi Paul,
 
I think you are stuck with eitther a Tesla or Quadro on a cluster. This is 
due to the ability to configure those cards to work without a display (see 
the release notes for the latest drivers though).
 
I'd be interested to hear otherwise as we have a few GTX280 nodes that are 
currently just used for CUDA. Maybe there is a way to "spoof" a monitor 
another way?

I have a set of ~30 .stl meshes that I would like to create a movie of in
Paraview.  Each mesh was created using different paramters and is numbered
sequentially so I can read it in as temporal data.  I would like to be able
to display the geometry and then also display the parameters used to create
that geometry.  I have the parameters in a .csv file with each run in a new
row.  Is there anyway to accomplish something like this?  I thought about
using a programmable filter on the .csv file to extract each parameter
manually, but for some reason it's not available.  I am using Paraview 3.6
and have included a sample .csv file.

It's using the same paraview to export the script as is running insitu...

Okay thanks.  Apparently, I'm doing some version of building that includes not bringing those updates over from the src directory to the build directory...

The other person that mentioned this problem also didn't seem to have the
servermanager.py file updated in the build directory even though they
updated their code in the source tree.  I'll check on that to see why it's
happening.

I'm not sure this is exactly what you want but you can select a point/cell
and then go to selection inspector and go to the point label/cell label tab
and toggle the visible button to show selected point or cell ids.  The
selection inspector also allows you to "select cells that include the
selected points".

Hope this helps.

If you just run 'make paraview' it won't copy the py files.  The target
responsible for copying the py files is 'make paraview_pyc'.  If you just
run 'make' then the paraview_pyc target should re-execute when the
timestamps have been modified on any of the py files.  Maybe we should add a
new target dependency rule?

Subject: [Paraview] List to select zones in object panel for a custom
 reader
In-Reply-To: <4C7E7E61.1090106@gmail.com>

Message-ID: <4C7EE853.3030902@gmail.com>

by the way, it is possible to send a variable length arrays of type 
other than string from client to server, the trick is to use the first 
element to send the total number of elements sent. This will work with 
state, but using a string is probably more robust against future PV 
changes since this relies on undocumented functionality.

Your panel has a method like this:

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void pqXXXPanel::accept()
{
  //...

  // The first element is expected to be the length
  vector<int> meshIds(1,0);

  //
  // walk your Qt widget & push selected mesh ids on the vector
  //

  meshIds[0]=meshIds.size(); // set length
  vtkSMIntVectorProperty *meshProp
    = dynamic_cast<vtkSMIntVectorProperty 
*>(dbbProxy->GetProperty("SetMeshIds"));
  meshProp->SetNumberOfElements(meshIds.size());
  meshProp->SetElements(&meshIds[0]);
  meshProp->Modified();
  dbbProxy->UpdateProperty("SetMeshIds");

  //...
}

Your reader has a method like this:

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkXXXReader::SetMeshIds(int *ids)
{
  const int n=ids[0];
  if (n>1)
    {
    this->MeshIds.assign(ids+1,ids+n);
    }
  else
    {
    this->MeshIds.clear();
    }
  this->SetNumberOfMeshes(n-1);
  this->Modified();
}

Message-ID: <93207545.3619935.1283411164239.JavaMail.fmail@mwmweb039>

Hi!
At the moment I'm doing a project thesis about turbulent jets calculated
with OpenFOAM-1.6.
I use Paraview 3.8.0 for post-processing. My problem concerns contour
plots in Paraview.
I wonder if it is possible to plot the values of each contour line
directly on or under the suitable contour line?
I would be very thankful if anybody knows a solution for my described
problem!


Best regards!

Hi Andy,

I'm trying to follow your instructions, but had some trouble with it. By
fiddling around I got the cell which contains my point of interest (by
location, the point is not a node) to be highlighted. I'm wondering if
there's a way for me to get the Cell ID of the highlighted cell?  I'm using
version 3.6.1.

Thanks!
Karen

I seem to have gotten  it work. However, I'm wondering if there's some
setting I can change such that it only gives the cell that contains my point
instead of 15 of them...

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Well part of my problem was (and maybe all of it except I built clean, so I can't verify) that there was a switch from
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping to Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages for the PYTHONPATH that I was not aware of.  I'm guessing the updates were installed there, but I was still looking at the old directory.

If you just run 'make paraview' it won't copy the py files.  The target responsible for copying the py files is 'make paraview_pyc'.  If you just run 'make' then the paraview_pyc target should re-execute when the timestamps have been modified on any of the py files.  Maybe we should add a new target dependency rule?

Hey Vishwa,

I haven't done this before, but what method is best/easiest will probably depend on what type of data you have stored in your .vtk file. 

If it's image data, then you might be able to write a simple VTK program to read in each of the vtk files and write out a more standard image format that Matlab can read. Have a look at the writers that inherit from vtkImageWriter (or maybe use that itself):

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkImageWriter.html

Otherwise, you may have to write a reader in Matlab that will just read in the data and form a Matlab array directly. Here someone has done it for Structured Grid data (I have not tried this, I just found it on the web):

http://www.cb.uu.se/~erik/vtk/readVTK.m

Depending on how big your data is or what type of values it contains, ParaView might be able to save it as a CSV or PNG file, too. (Which could be scripted as a batch Python job.)

Hope this helps,
-Eric

Since the selection stuff is somewhat new I'm not sure how it worked in
3.6.1.  In the latest version in the selection inspector you can highlight
cells/points and use delete, delete all, and/or new value to the list of
selected objects.

You can also play around with the selections in the spreadsheet view
(there's a green dashed box button widget that will only list selected
points or cells).  The selections between the spreadsheet view and 3d view
are connected so selecting in one selects in both.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Surface LIC
Message-ID: <4C80C17A.3040801@onera.fr>

Hi all.

I have often read here that reverting to older GPU drivers solves LIC 
problems.  Updating a GPU driver is supposed to improve the GPU 
performance. So if you have a driver that makes LIC work, I am wondering 
why LIC may fail when updating to the newest GPU drivers? Are those 
newest drivers some beta versions, or does LIC use some OpenGL features 
that are considered as obsolete by the GPU developpers ?

Best regards.

I would like to be able to orientate the camera whilst running batch scripts

keyc1.Interpolation = "Ramp"
keyc1.KeyTime = 0
keyc1.KeyValues = [0,0,0]

keyc2.KeyTime = 1.0
keyc2.KeyValues = [0.1,0,0]

cue2 = servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue()
cue2.AnimatedProxy = GetRenderView()
cue2.AnimatedPropertyName = "CameraPosition"
cue2.KeyFrames = [keyc1,keyc2]

May I suggest to use the following:

cue2 = servermanager.animation.CameraAnimationCue()
keyc1 = servermanager.animation.CameraKeyFrame()
keyc2 = servermanager.animation.CameraKeyFrame()

keyc1.ListProperties() will give you all the properties you can animate;

['ClosedFocalPath', 'ClosedPositionPath', 'FocalPathPoints', 'FocalPoint', 'FocalPointMode', 'KeyTime', 'KeyValues', 'ParallelScale', 'Position', 'PositionMode', 'PositionPathPoints', 'ViewAngle', 'ViewUp']

The rest is up to you.

________________________________________


I would like to be able to orientate the camera whilst running batch scripts
for generating animations, as you can do in interactive mode. However, I'm
stuck on what to use for the AnimatedProxy. I tried the following and I get
an error message:

#move camera
keyc1 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
keyc1.Interpolation = "Ramp"
keyc1.KeyTime = 0
keyc1.KeyValues = [0,0,0]
keyc2 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
keyc2.KeyTime = 1.0
keyc2.KeyValues = [0.1,0,0]

cue2 = servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue()
cue2.AnimatedProxy = GetRenderView()
cue2.AnimatedPropertyName = "CameraPosition"
cue2.KeyFrames = [keyc1,keyc2]

ERROR: In
/usr/people/gagliard/Paraview/FILES/ParaView3-Original/Servers/ServerManager
/vtkSMRampKeyFrameProxy.cxx, line 53
vtkSMRampKeyFrameProxy (0x2aac712b3770): Cue does not have domain or
property set!
________________________________________

May I suggest to use the following:

cue2 = servermanager.animation.CameraAnimationCue()
keyc1 = servermanager.animation.CameraKeyFrame()
keyc2 = servermanager.animation.CameraKeyFrame()

keyc1.ListProperties() will give you all the properties you can animate;

['ClosedFocalPath', 'ClosedPositionPath', 'FocalPathPoints', 'FocalPoint',
'FocalPointMode', 'KeyTime', 'KeyValues', 'ParallelScale', 'Position',
'PositionMode', 'PositionPathPoints', 'ViewAngle', 'ViewUp']

The rest is up to you.

GPU drivers are frequently buggy. It is one of the reasons why they
come out so frequently.

Thank you for the answer.
So the GPU rule seems to be: "When you have got a good driver for LIC, 
please don't update it!" :D
These are not good news for people depending on system administrators 
who may have planned periodic GPU updates (although the period between 
two updates may be very looooong!) and may have other priorities than 
searching for the best driver to make a given software run, especially 
if this is only for a few number of more or less obsolete workstations.
This promises again sweat, blood an tears for some poor LIC users... :D
But indeed, LIC is a great plugin. I got some pretty pictures on some 
workstations and on my home computer (with a good driver!). The LIC 
developers have made a good job, and I hope they will be able to 
increase its robustness in the future releases.

Thank you Robert, it works for me! Currently it's an experimental
minor feature in the application, so I don't care if there are
multiple installations of ParaView. (it's great when you can just
click a button and open your data in PV)

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView fails to run under Windows7 + MSVC2008
Message-ID: <4C82FFBC.50707@renci.org>




  Hi John,

I am getting desperate here after reinstalling MSVC2008, .NET Framework
3.5, 4.0, DirectX SDK (June 2010), and Windows Platform SDK (6.1 and
7.1) a couple of times.
Would you please tell me what exactly have been installed on your fresh
PC before building ParaView? I did use the precompiled Qt 4.6.3 x64
MSVC2008 already to save me time of rebuilding Qt.
Thanks a lot.

Best,
x



  Re: [Paraview] ParaView fails to run under Windows7 + MSVC2008

Just in case it's of any interest.

I have just installed windows 7 x64 on a fresh PC and also visual studio 2010. 
I couldn't find x64 binaries for Qt so I compiled Qt 4.7 beta from source (had 
a couple of errors which I managed to get around somehow), then compiled 
paraview git from a few days ago and I now have a working paraview. Seems to 
run fine.

I realize this doesn't help, but visual studio 2008 isn't any different - and 
Qt binaries for x64 builds are available from 
http://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/downloads/list which I used on XP 
x64 without problems.

 Hi All,
The default build of Xdmf.vcproj have the following bugs:
====================================================
Errors:
Error 326 error C2146: syntax error : missing ';' before identifier 'fd'
d:\mysql5.1\include\mysql_com.h 243 Xdmf
Error 327 error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++
does not support default-int d:\mysql5.1\include\mysql_com.h 243 Xdmf
Error 328 error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++
does not support default-int d:\mysql5.1\include\mysql_com.h 243 Xdmf
Error 329 error C2065: 'SOCKET' : undeclared identifier
d:\mysql5.1\include\mysql_com.h 427 Xdmf
Error 330 error C2146: syntax error : missing ')' before identifier 's'
d:\mysql5.1\include\mysql_com.h 427 Xdmf
Error 331 error C2059: syntax error : ')'
d:\mysql5.1\include\mysql_com.h 428 Xdmf

Fix:
Add the following lines in d:\mysql5.1\include\mysql_com.h

#if defined(__WIN__)
#include <WinSock2.h>
#endif /* __WIN__ */
====================================================
Errors:
Error 3 error LNK2005: _amsg_exit already defined in
MSVCRTD.lib(MSVCR90D.dll) LIBCMT.lib Xdmf
Error 4 error LNK2005: _initterm_e already defined in
MSVCRTD.lib(MSVCR90D.dll) LIBCMT.lib Xdmf
Error 5 error LNK2005: exit already defined in MSVCRTD.lib(MSVCR90D.dll)
LIBCMT.lib Xdmf
...

Fix:
Add "libcmt" in Xdmf Property Pages -> Configuration Properties ->
Linker -> Input -> Ignore Specific Library for both Debug and Release build.

For the libcmt errors, how can I patch the corresponding CMakeLists.txt
file? Thanks a lot.

Best,
x

The link errors indicate you're linking things built with the static runtime
(/MT) and the dynamic runtime (/MD). By default CMake uses the /MD Flags.
Did you change them to /MT? In either case you want them to be the same for
everything you're trying to build.

  Hi Dave,
I guess you were talking about the linking error caused in Xdmf build, 
right?
I did only have /MD and /MDd options in ParaView CMake. The libcmt 
errors only happen to Xdmf project.
I will do a clean build again to verify.

Best,
x

So you're building ParaView against your own build of sql, or a prebuilt
binary (via XDMF_USE_MYSQL)? Did you build it yourself? If so, was it built
with /MT? Can you provide any more details so I can try and reproduce the
errors?

  Hi Dave,
I am building against prebuilt MySQL (x64 essential) binary.
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
By examining the size of libmysql.lib, I am pretty sure it is a shared 
library.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Save animation using client-server topology with point
 sprite plugin results in crash
Message-ID: <4C857CD7.1010102@yahoo.com.br>

  Hi,

I was trying to save some animations using the paraview 3.8.0 binary 
distribution from the site and Point-Sprite plugin in a simple client-server 
connection using the option "disconnect before saving animation", but appears 
that in some point in the code the point-sprite plugin is missing or not loaded.
The server-side error messages are the following:

Warning: In

Ah that's indeed a bug. I am sure the point-sprite client-side
components are not loaded on  the server, which is needed for
"disconnect-and-save" to work.

I've added a bug report:

Subject: [Paraview] Problem Building Paraview-3.8.0 with MPICH
Message-ID: <AANLkTin2N6a=DEN4tifHDxiS7udoDEwupx+X_=XG6707@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am facing following error when building paraview-3.8.0 with MPICH1-1.2.5.2
(sorry, but I cant upgrade the MPICH because of some limitations on the
remote cluster).
Strange thing is these undefined functions like 'PMPI_Info_set' are declared
in the header files in the variable MPI_INCLUDE_PATH which contain mpi.h,
mpif.h, mpio.h etc, hence I assume that the definitions must be present in
libraries.

My MPI_LIBRARY=/usr/lib64/libmpich.so.1.0
and MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib64/libmpich.so (obtained from dev version of
mpich)

Has anybody faced a similar problem.

You can build dlls (/LD) and at the same time link the static version of the
runtime (/MT). It makes it more convenient to distribute shared libraries
without also needing to carry around the dynamic runtime dlls
(msvcrtxx.dll).

That said, your solution to set the excluded libraries in the project
properties should work but can get trampled when CMake regenerates. A
slightly better solution would be to use the /NODEFAULTLIB:<library.lib>
link flags in CMake to exclude them will also work.

CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS add /NODEFAULTLIB:<library.lib>
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS add /NODEFAULTLIB:<library.lib>

Hi Lokendra,

I am not sure if this helps but you should just set MPI_LIBRARY=
/usr/lib64/libmpich.so

Hi Lokendra,

You can use the command:

mpicxx -show

to see what libs need to be linked.

My cmake cache (set up automatically) looks like:

MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY=/opt/mpich2-1.2.1p1-D/lib/libmpich.so;/opt/mpich2-1.2.1p1-D/lib/libopa.a;/usr/lib/libpthread.so;/usr/lib/librt.so
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/mpich2-1.2.1p1-D/include
MPI_LIBRARY=/opt/mpich2-1.2.1p1-D/lib/libmpichcxx.so

  Hi Dave,
Thanks so much. Below two lines are exactly what I am looking for.
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS add /NODEFAULTLIB:<library.lib>
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS add /NODEFAULTLIB:<library.lib>
Should I report Xdmf problem to ParaView bug tracker?
Best,
x

Subject: [Paraview] CullBackface, Normals and Missing Triangles
Message-ID: <49D519E0-7CDC-433C-8A3F-DAA251BDAB2D@bluequartz.net>

I have a triangular mesh that is generated from an experimental  
meshing algorithm. I am using ParaView to check the mesh for  
consistency. I am trying to diagnose a potential problem that I just  
can not understand how it is happening and I am not sure if there is a  
problem in my code, the writing of the vtk file or in ParaView.
    I have a triangle surface mesh where a few of the triangles are  
not visible if you render by "Cull Backface" in the Display tab.  
Usually this means the triangle winding is backwards so I ran the  
"Normal Glyphs" filter and all the arrows are consistently pointing  
the correct direction, even for the "missing" triangle. For better or  
worse, I also use the T=2V-4 equation to try and figure out of the  
surface is "water tight" which it should be and the equation validates  
that. I don't really know what else to check? Selecting "CELLS" and  
showing the CELL_DATA values for the cells shows a value floating on  
the missing triangle so I am reasonably convince there is a triangle  
there.
    So why would the triangle disappear when I render with "Cull  
Backface" but the normal for the triangle say that I should be looking  
at the front face?

    Ideas, suggestions and thoughts are welcome.

Thanks for any help.

Message-ID: <46CD272DA4EC4B46800957F37D8940A50A9C7F@EXCHANGE2.ad.acadiau.ca>

Hi,

I have tecplot .plt (binary) files that I read into paraview using the VisIt plug-in.  Normally, this works fine; however, the linux version of paraview crashes when trying to open .plt files created with an Apple executable that converts tecplot ascii files to tecplot .plt files.  I downloaded a Mac version of paraview, but there is no VisIt plug-in option.

I was wondering if there is a VisIt plug-in somewhere for the Mac version of paraview?  

thanks
Joel

Unfortunately, as far as I am aware the current VisIt plugin won't be ported
to Mac. That said there is a new Visit plugin in the works.

Hi Joel,

The new VisIt plugin can be tracked at
http://github.com/robertmaynard/VisIt-Bridge. Currently I haven't converted
the Tecplot reader, but that wouldn't be hard to add.

Hi Robert, Dave,

I found the linux version of the apple executable I mentioned below (the tecplot preplot executable) and I can read the .plt file into linux paraview.  Duh, that was obvious.

The present VisIt bridge is important to my work, so I look forward to the new one coming out (and hope it includes a tecplot reader!)

thanks
Joel

I downloaded a Mac version of paraview, but there is no VisIt plug-in option.

I was wondering if there is a VisIt plug-in somewhere for the Mac version of paraview?

thanks
Joel

Hi,

I was using 3.8.0 Paraview. I tried GetAnimationTrack on 3.9.0 and it worked
perfect!

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Showing FileName property on the GUI
Message-ID: <20100908.111823.27449647.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

Before a commit on yesterday

commit 35f842cbf94964f567158fa5ebfde62249c354f0
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 7 09:41:35 2010 -0400

    Adding support for a hint to specify the default "FileName" property.

the show hint to FileName property had been respected, i.e. if I write
in the SM-XML
  <Hints>
    <Property name="FileName" show="1"/>
  </Hints>
the property appeared on the GUI reader panel even if it was the first
file property (and I could see that there had been an explicit logic
to check propertiesToShow). However after the commit it is no longer
effective. Can the previous behavior be retrieved, by e. g. the
following modification?

Hi Burlen,

Thanks a lot. Your suggestion worked !!

 'mpicc -show' , told me that I was missing pmpi libraries. I included
libpmpich.a and libpmpich++.a in MPI_LIBRARY and it solved the issue.

Regards
Lokendra

  Hi Dave,
Here is what added to ParaView\Utilities\Xdmf2\CMakeLists.txt
...
SET(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_ANSI_CFLAGS} ${CMAKE_C_FLAGS}")

IF(WIN32)
   SET(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} add 
/NODEFAULTLIB:libcmt")
   SET(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} add 
/NODEFAULTLIB:libcmt")
ENDIF(WIN32)
...
Would you please commit it to the main branch?

Best,
x

Hi Dr. X,

I don't think it's a bug. I think you're just going to have to set those
flags on an individual basis when you build against that version of SQL.
Checking in your changes would prevent anyone from building Xdmf with /MT if
they wanted to, which is a legitimate use case.

Personally, I would set these flags in the cmake-gui, under advanced, as
needed.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview & OSX,
 reproducible crash probably due to something in the input file...
Message-ID: <4C87AA76.4040205@disco.unimib.it>

  Dear all,
     I'm experiencing a problem using Paraview on my macbook (Intel core 
2 Duo with OSX 10.6.4). If I try to load the output files and visualize 
the results this error appears: http://tinyurl.com/paraviewoxserr1

It is quite annoying because after that Paraview crashes completely, no 
additional messages. It works perfectly with other output files but 
using a specific case it always crashes, in the same way. I checked the 
xmf file more than once, it contains all the informations and all the h5 
files are placed in the right place. So, I don't understand where the 
problem could be.

Do you have any suggestion on how to figure out about that?

Thank you very much in advance,
Regards

You have a NULL pointer exception in the pqSILModel::update() method.

Ok, but how I can avoid this problem? and is this problem dependent from 
something in my input? How can I discover the bug/error?

Subject: [Paraview] 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator support
Message-ID: <4C87E230.3030309@renci.org>

 Hi All,

I would like to use SpaceNavigator to control camera view in ParaView's
main renderwindow. I realized 3Dconnexion has been integrated into VTK
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VTK/3DConnexion_Devices_Support
By turning on UseTDx in
vtkRenderWindowInteractor::vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
{
...
this->UseTDx=true;//false; // 3DConnexion device.
}
VTK example Cone5 can be controlled by the SpaceNavigator. I am
wondering what will be needed to switch paraview's main render window's
camera control to 3DConnexion device. So far, I have tried modifying
vtkRenderWindowInteractor.cxx as above and
QVTKWidget::QVTKWidget()
{
this->UseTDx=true;//false;
...
}
in QVTKWidget.cxx. None of them seems to propagate the effect to
paraview application. Can anyone provide some hint?
Thanks so much.

Best,
xunlei

Subject: [Paraview] Hidden objects in povray export
Message-ID: <42DF6617-1F05-4406-B15F-AC039B8013F3@mcs.anl.gov>

Hi,

I have recently started experimenting with exporting data objects in  
ParaView as povray files, and have run into the following issue.  I  
have an unstructured grid dataset, from which I generate some  
streamlines and cutting planes.  Inside ParaView I hide the original  
data and view only the streamlines and cutting planes, and things look  
great.  However, when I export this as pov, the resulting .pov file  
includes the original (hidden) data, so that when I try to render this  
file with povray, all I see is the original mesh.  Not to mention that  
it makes the size of the resulting pov file much larger than is needed  
by including this extra data.  Has anyone else seen this behavior?  Is  
there some way that I'm missing of telling ParaView not to include  
hidden data objects in the pov file when exporting?

(btw, this is using the PV3.8.0 Mac binary)

Thanks,
joe.

Hi Joe,

I can confirm the same behavior.  I'm not sure if that behavior is done on
purpose or not.  Here is how you can work around the issue using the python
shell:

for s in GetSources().values():
    r = GetDisplayProperties(s)
    if not r.Visibility: GetActiveView().Representations.remove(r)

You can create a new python macro and assign this code to the macro.  Then
just run the macro right before exporting.

Dave,

I believe there is some mangling missing after your change.  I just
pulled VTK from git and my app, which links to both NetCDF and VTK, no
longer links.  Error is:

ld: duplicate symbol _nc_inq_type in /path1/libnetcdf.a(nc.o) and /path2/
libvtkNetCDF.a(nc.c.o)

If I do the following:

nm libvtkNetCDF.a | grep " [TRD] "

It lists several symbols that aren't prefixed by vtk_netcdf, namely:

0000000000003083 T _nc_inq_type
0000000000000043 T _nextUTF8
00000000000008ae T _nulldup
00000000000018ae T _utf8proc_NFC
0000000000001860 T _utf8proc_NFD
000000000000194a T _utf8proc_NFKC
00000000000018fc T _utf8proc_NFKD
0000000000001998 T _utf8proc_check
0000000000000343 T _utf8proc_codepoint_valid
0000000000000fd1 T _utf8proc_decompose
00000000000005d9 T _utf8proc_decompose_char
00000000000003c6 T _utf8proc_encode_char
0000000000000000 T _utf8proc_errmsg
000000000000054b T _utf8proc_get_property
00000000000000cf T _utf8proc_iterate
000000000000172b T _utf8proc_map
000000000000126a T _utf8proc_reencode

nc_inq_type certainly should be in vtk_netcdf_mangle.h, not sure why/how
you missed it.  My experience with updating VTK's freetype is that one
must regenerate the symbol list on all the major platforms and merge the
results.  Some symbols seem to only be exported on some OSes, see my
comments in vtk_freetype_mangle.h.

Not sure about the other symbols.  "utf8proc" looks like 3rd party code
used by NetCDF itself.  I wonder if these symbols should not be exported
at all, I'm guessing they are not part of NetCDF's public API.

Cheers,

--

You can try creating a customizable filter under Tools or recording a python
trace and then create a macro from it under Tools as well.

Dave,

FYI, if I add:

#define nc_inq_type vtk_netcdf_nc_inq_type
#define nextUTF8 vtk_netcdf_nextUTF8
#define nulldup vtk_netcdf_nulldup

my app then links.  If I further add the utf8proc ones, VTK itself fails
to link when rebuilt.

Thanks. I really like the Python trace method. 

I tried the Custom Filter but I didn't like the fact that all the 
calculations were hidden and I need the ability to modify some constants. 

The Python script method looks very powerful and the trace functionality 
makes it very easy to get started.

You can try creating a customizable filter under Tools or recording a 
python trace and then create a macro from it under Tools as well.

Most people seem to like the python scripting stuff over the custom filter.
With macros you can create a GUI button for running the python script as
well.  The custom filter may be able to expose some of the calculator inputs
in the way that you want to in the gui though.  I think the custom filter
can somehow be saved so that you can share it with other people but I'm not
sure how to do that.

Another question concerning the background image... 
What is the procedure within python scripting to load an image as background? I also tried to get it via the tracing option but its output was not usefu, since there is no reference to the file I was loading:
...
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
RenderView1.UseTexturedBackground = 1
RenderView1.BackgroundTexture = []
RenderView1.Background2 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.17254901960784313]
RenderView1.Background = [0.32941176470588235, 0.34901960784313724, 0.42745098039215684]

Render()
...

Thanks for your help!

It is possible to set a background image in paraview. Create a large
image with a log at one corner and then set that as the background
image. Go to Edit | View Settings to change the background image.

Dear all,

I would like to create a mold from a dataset (stl mesh). The result
should be a closed box that is intersected by the mesh.
I thought that I could clip a source (a box) with a dataset... I am wrong?
Is there another way to obtain my negative mold?

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Get Data Ranges in Python
Message-ID: <49439B317DD146D99899782DBEFA95F7@bobble>

Hello,

If I select an item in the Pipeline Browser, and click the "Information" tab in the Object Inspector, I can view the "Data Ranges" for all the Data Arrays defined in that object.
Is there Python commands that can enable me to Get that data? I've spent quite a bit of time fiddling about with variations of GetActiveSource().GetDataInformation().GetBounds() etc, but no success.

I need this data in a macro that will define a new RGBPoints array, so that rendered data on a surface that is outside user defined limits, will plot in an "out of bounds" colour e.g. grey. I tried the suggestion on the Wiki of defining a new colour map with a small strip of grey at each end of the profile, but this method didn't work properly, as it gave a very wavy boundary line between colour and grey, and it's location was a function of the number of colour contours chosen.

Thanks,

Tim

Hello,

For a while the LIC tests were disabled on Linux. I reactivated them
and fixed an issue in the code itself. I also made the code more
reliable to reject
OpenGL 2.1/DX9 GPUS (like GeForce6 and 7) as LIC requires at least a
GPU from the OpenGL3.0/DX10 GPU generation (GeForce 8 and above).
.
The SurfaceLIC test (a VTK test) works fine for me with nVidia driver
195.36.24 (the one from Ubuntu 10.04) but
a more recent driver version on a dashboard machine does not (256.44).
You can see in the log that it is a driver bug because it is an
internal nVidia compiler error:

Subject: [Paraview] Get Data Ranges in Python

Hello,

If I select an item in the Pipeline Browser, and click the "Information" tab in the Object Inspector, I can view the "Data Ranges" for all the Data Arrays defined in that object.
Is there Python commands that can enable me to Get that data?
-----------------
try this:

w = FindSource('Name')
pd = w.PointData

for n in range(pd.GetNumberOfArrays()):
   print "Range for array ", pd.GetArray(n).GetName(), " ", pd.GetArray(n).GetRange()

Subject: [Paraview] dynamically rescaling the color map
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.1009091711550.28272@alice.wonderland.caltech.edu>


I'm visualizing a scalar on a deforming S2 surface.  The scalar undergoes 
a damped oscillation.

Is there a way to rescale the color map dynamically as the scalar evolves? 
Otherwise at late times the oscillation is invisible.

Thanks,
Keith

Message-ID: <OF584AFC03.88E003FA-ON8525779A.005DAB48-8525779A.005EE390@CHROMALLOY.COM>

I have two somewhat related questions:

1. Is it possible to calculate a gradient vector using the calculator 
filter?

2. Is it possible to define a new data array using a Python script without 
the calculator filter? Currently, I am using several Calculator Filters to 
calculate CFD flow variables from the conservative variables. I use a 
Python script to create the Calculator Filters, but I'm wondering if I can 
avoid the Calculator Filter and directly generate new data arrays for 
plotting.

No. The calculator filter does only element wise (cell by cell or
point by point) computations. To compute the gradient you need
information from neighboring elements.

Not with a python script (under the python shell) since that runs on
the client and can't really manipulate the data (which lives on the
server) directly. However, the python programmable filter runs on the
server, and with that you can create new arrays, and access
neighboring elements as well.
See http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter for examples.

I have a couple of questions about using the Programmable Filter. I have 
imported Tecplot dataset with the following data: coordsX, coordsY, 
coordsZ, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5. 

How would I create a new data array that is Q2^2+Q3^2+Q4^2? 

How would I create a new vector data array (similar to 
Q2*iHat+Q3*jHat+Q4*kHat in the Calculator Filter)?

Subject: [Paraview] mapping unstructured grid onto regular grid
Message-ID: <E567EB86-1164-432E-88ED-FC3C8F0B8A3D@sjc.ox.ac.uk>

I would like to map an unstructured grid (describing particle data  
with per particle attributes I would like interpolated onto the  
regular grid) onto a regular mesh.  I am trying to use the 'Resample  
With Dataset' filter but have not been having much luck.

Here are a few of the issues I've been having:

- Which item is the "Source" and the "Input" , the unstructured grid  
with particle data, or the regular mesh?

- Will the properties associated with the particle data come through  
the filter albeit in an interpolated form?

If anyone has a working example out there of this filter in action it  
would be great if you could post it.

Thanks.

I was wondering if there was a central l location for the  
documentation of plugins that are distributed with ParaView?

I am thinking of those which are automatically bundled along with,  
such as SLAC, Analyze, Prims, etc.

I saw there were some dead links on the ParaView wiki which might  
contain the data but that was about all I could find.

Thanks.

________________________________________

As far as I understand, what you are trying to do is not possible, with the "Resample with dataset filter". The reason is that your input dataset does not seem to have 3D cells. Resampling needs 3D cells for interpolation.

There is a method, vtkShepardMethod (http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkShepardMethod.html),  which does exactly what you need. However, Shepard is not included in ParaView. No problem, you can do it off-line:

I have tried the following python script with my paraview compilation and my ./bin/vtkpython and it produced the required output. See if it fits your purpose.

from vtk import *
numPts = 300

ps = vtk.vtkPointSource()
ps.SetRadius(1)
ps.SetNumberOfPoints(numPts)
ps.Update()

ca = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
ca.SetName("datavalue")
ca.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
ca.SetNumberOfTuples(numPts)

for i in range(0, numPts):
  ca.SetValue(i, ps.GetOutput().GetPoint(i)[0])

ps.GetOutput().GetPointData().AddArray(ca)
ps.GetOutput().GetPointData().SetScalars(ca)
ps.Update()
ps.GetOutput().GetPointData().SetScalars(ca)

sh = vtk.vtkShepardMethod()
sh.SetSampleDimensions(20,20,20)
sh.SetInputConnection(ps.GetOutputPort())
sh.SetModelBounds(ps.GetOutput().GetBounds())

wr = vtk.vtkDataSetWriter()
wr.SetInputConnection(sh.GetOutputPort())
wr.SetFileName("/tmp/foo.vtk")
wr.Write()

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A194D322B4C8D@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

I'm experimenting with calling functions in the ServerManager directly from a parallel application



On each node, I have a vtkDataset (piece of),



I need to set the dataset as input to a pipeline - for example


  vtkSMProxyManager* pxm = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager();
  vtkSMProxy *contour = pxm->NewProxy("filters", "Contour");
  //
  vtkSMInputProperty *input = vtkSMInputProperty::SafeDownCast(
    contour->GetProperty("Input"));


How can I manually set the vtkDataSet as the input to the contour filter (through the inputproxy). I presume I need a data object proxy, which has its pointer set directly. But I can't seem to find that right combination of calls.



Thanks

I'm not sure if it will work but maybe using vtkTrivialProducer might do it
for you with SetOutput().

Thanks ....but ...My problem is primarily, how to take the concrete vtk dataset and attach it to a proxy. Each node should have the same Id for the dataset so that the pipeline operates correctly. I've been stepping thrpugh the servermanager NewProxy code to see where the stuff really happens, but can't seem tpo pin it down. Once I have that, I can make a trivial produced, attach the dataset to it, and bind it to a proxy, which will then get used in the pipeline.
I'm sure I'll find the correct procedure eventually...

Hello,

In order to calculate a new scalar (here for a multiblockdataset)

pdi = self.GetInput()

pdo = self.GetOutput()

pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)

for block in output[0]:

if block.GetNumberOfPoints() != 0:

array = block.PointData['Q1'] / block.PointData['Q2']

block.PointData.append(array, 'newQ')


For a new vector, I would like someone to explain a simple way to do that.
(without many transpose, ravel, etc...)
Knowing that it does not work with array =
numpy.array([block.PointData['Q1'], block.PointData['Q2'],
block.PointData['Q3']]) / block.PointData['Q4']
because of a problem of dimensions.

Regards,

A.Marsan

I believe that plugin only gets built when the client gui is enabled.

Unfortunately, currently there's no more documentation for the
plugins. The placeholders on  the Wiki are exactly where we plan to
add more information about the plugins.

Michael,

Use something like follows:

txt = servermanager.rendering.ImageTexture()
txt.SourceProcess="Client"
txt.FileName = "/tmp/foo.png"

view.BackgroundTexture = txt
view.UseTexturedBackground = 1
Render()

Ok - thanks.  Definitely makes it more difficult to use the bundled
plugins.  Perhaps documentation should be required before a plugin is
bundled in w the PV distribution.

Dave,

Is that indeed the case? In which case that's a bug. We need to fix it
so that the plugin build w/o the client gui. Can you take a look
please?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <AANLkTindL597pW_r1fM2Be6T51QjM0f2KNUfS4W7oLTg@mail.gmail.com>

Good Afternoon,

I produce a dataset with timestep, looking at
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters
.
It works well, but at the first time I use my Reader, just after having
launched Paraview, it displays me this message :
modpython:25: DeprecationWarning: integer argument expected, got float

It looks like this is because of the line :
pdo.GetInformation().Append(pdo.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),
pyturbo.GetUpdateTimeSteps(self)[0])
where the function GetUpdateTimeSteps is the same as in the example Producing
Data with Timesteps of the wiki.

Any suggestion of explanation ?
Many thanks,

A.Marsan

Not currently. But that sounds like a nice feature. Feel free to add
it to http://paraview.uservoice.com/ . If there's enough interest in
the feature, we can try to add support for it.

There's of course the non-automatic way of create text labels
explicitly (using Sources | Text source).

Hi,

I am trying to save a screenshot with transparent background.
To do this, I set as background a fully transparent image, but the 
resulting screenshots have black background. 
Is it possible to have a transparent backgroud in the screenshots?

Best,

Nope, it's not possible to save transparent backgrounds. However, it
should be too hard to use another tool afterwords to set the
transparent color for the png.

You got me looking in the right direction and I found this is what I wanted

this->TrivialProducer = pxm->NewProxy("sources", "TrivialProducer");
vtkTrivialProducer::SafeDownCast(this->TrivialProducer->GetClientSideObject())->SetOutput(ds);

thanks

I'm not sure if it will work but maybe using vtkTrivialProducer might do it for you with SetOutput().

How can I manually set the vtkDataSet as the input to the contour filter (through the inputproxy). I presume I need a data object proxy, which has its pointer set directly. But I can't seem to find that right combination of calls.

Hello,

Try doing a slice through all the contour lines, and then selecting
the points on the slice that you want to label. Then turn on the
selection inspector and show point labels with the variable you want
to plot. I've found the number of trailing zeros is a bit annoying,?as
there's no control over the number format, and I normally choose
integer values for the contours.
The selection labels aren't persistent so?a state file will lose these
labels, and you'll have to reselect them if you need another plot.

Regards,

Tim

Not currently. But that sounds like a nice feature. Feel free to add
it to http://paraview.uservoice.com/ . If there's enough interest in
the feature, we can try to add support for it.

There's of course the non-automatic way of create text labels
explicitly (using Sources | Text source).

Hi Stephane,

On the VTK side which might be able to be done in the scripting layer
of ParaView also (but not sure), you will need 2 things:

1) tell the render window to send alpha :
view->GetRenderWindow()->SetAlphaBitPlanes(1);
2) request the Alpha value on the window capture filter :
this->WindowCapture->SetInputBufferTypeToRGBA();

And if you write a PNG image, the background will be transparent.

Go to Edit | Settings. In the "General" settings page, there's an
option for "Rescale Data Range Mode". Choose "Grow every timestep".
That should update the range is the scalar range grows beyond the
current LUT range.

Subject: [Paraview] Qt library install question
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=6nSsORW2JxJd4tRjYTW5QVPo1c4Jg-GaHOPaW@mail.gmail.com>

When I import the paraview Python module from a regular Python
interpreter, I get a slew of warning messages like:


objc[31181]: Class QNSImageView is implemented in both
/opt/local/libexec/qt4-mac/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui and
/.. other directories ...
/Code/qt-pv/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui. One of the two will
be used. Which one is undefined.

Is this likely to cause a problem in running PV?  What is the best way
to fix this issue?  I was thinking about setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to point at the qt library that I used to build PV.

Thanks.

Unstructured grid needs cells even though you are only interested in
points. You will have to create one cell per point or one cell that
refer each point.

VTK_VERTEX or VTK_POLY_VERTEX.

You can check the following document to see what I mean by Cell.

That will most likely cause "problems" running paraview. You really  
want to make sure you consistently build and load against the same set  
of Qt Libraries. It looks like your Qt installations do NOT have an  
"install_name" that contains the absolute path to the Qt frameworks so  
setting something like DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH may be necessary. And the  
same for frameworks.

run "otool -L /opt/local/libexec/qt4-mac/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/ 
4/QtGui"
and post the output.

Subject: [Paraview] dynamically rescaling the color map
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTi=3Oa5huyHCnQWpnZck=EJtUjtqRrp8GCyH96Dh@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C8B3F415.6777%kmorel@sandia.gov>

If it's at all possible, I highly recommend not using the "Grow every timestep" option if at all possible.  Rescaling the color map dynamically as the scalar evolves yields quite misleading visualization even when you are aware it is happening and show how the range changes.  I would instead set the range to some constant and use some non-linear scaling (like log scaling) to show details in particular ranges.

Go to Edit | Settings. In the "General" settings page, there's an
option for "Rescale Data Range Mode". Choose "Grow every timestep".
That should update the range is the scalar range grows beyond the
current LUT range.

Ok - that's great. I was able to see how that works with some playing
around at the interactive prompt.

How does this approach using vtkShepardMethod compare to the sampling
probes that are included with the pv-meshless plugin ? I noticed that
they produce an output called Shepard, but wasn't sure how broadly
they apply outside of SPH type of work (i.e. properly defined mass,
density, etc. fields).

Thanks again.

Dan

the pv-meshless plugin has a resample using a probe - as you know - but the resample algorithm can be SPH, or just a conventional shepard kernel. In the SPH manager widget, you can change it.

I tried it just now and found there was some experimental code left in which gave dodgy answers. I've just fixed it (and pushed to git), so now it gives a standard shepard interpolation for arbitrary particle data. (I'm preparing material for a tutorial including some particle data demos, so timing was good there!)

To compare with vtkShepard method - I don't know as I've never used it. But vtkShepardMethod only produces an imagedata as output. the stuff in pv-meshless allows you to probe with an arbitrary geometry and has a reasonably efficient particle neighbour search using a BSP tree.

Using resample to grid allows you to create a box widget of arbitrary resolution and resample with that. Ought to give the same output (for matching grid spacing etc) as vtkShepardMethod. You can sample with line/box/plane, or arbitrary input (any dataset).

The SPH mode of operation does the interpolation using an SPH kernel, but also outputs the Shepard coefficient, which should be 1 inside the volume and 0 outside. using a contour of 0.5 allows you to generate surfaces - but it is dependent on the 'true' particle size (kernel size). The shepard mode only interpolates. However, for general scalars is v. useful. I would prefer the meshless plugin over the vtkShepardMethod filter for general flexibility.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView and Python general questions
Message-ID: <AANLkTikyXYkk565KLDqNmutfE+aaAwNuoW=TTci3TvU3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to ParaView and not entirely new to Python. I have been trying to
create Python scripts to automate some animations with volume rendering that
I have been working on.

I have found it very difficult to find out how to do various things from
Python that are easily accessible from the main ParaView GUI. I haven't been
able to find detailed documentation, except for the "ParaView Scripting with
Python" document, and by looking at the properties of the Python modules
using dir, help, etc, it is very hard to find out how some things are done
and I have to admit that I am a bit lost. I was wondering if a more
comprehensive guide than this document and the 'Python Recipes' page exists,
or at least some guidelines on how to find out how things are done from the
servermanager module.

Some things I would like to do is for example to load a preset for the
opacity function for volume rendering that I have created and saved using
the GUI, to show/hide axes and the rotation center when rendering, etc.

Also, I have read about some bugs being fixed (for example showing/hiding
the center of the axes). In order to have those fixes, can I get an updated
Python module and how? I am currently using Paraview 3.6.1., but should soon
upgrade to 3.8.0.

Thank you,

Milos

Hey Milos,

Someone else may have to address your specific concerns about loading opacity functions, axes and rotation center, but I wanted to make sure you know about some very helpful functionality for figuring out the way to do things in Python. In 3.6 there was already a Python "Trace" function where you can start a trace, then do GUI manipulations, and then show or save the trace and look at the Python commands for what you did. I would advise upgrading to 3.8, though, as there is now a "Trace State" button on the Python shell which lets you set up a pipeline and then get the Python commands which will (should) set up the same pipeline.

For automating things you'll probably still need to refer to the wiki page for some things. I think that's the most up-to-date documentation:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Hopefully someone else can help with your more specific needs,
-Eric

ParaView has Python tracing capability which will make it easier for
you to dump Python scripts based on user-interface actions
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools). You might want to
wait for 3.8.1 (or try the release candidates) for better animation
support from Python.

After building paraview with GUI on the cluster the SurfaceLIC plugin is available. So I can confirm that the plugin only gets built when the client GUI is enabled.

Is that indeed the case? In which case that's a bug. We need to fix it
so that the plugin build w/o the client gui. Can you take a look

Hmm, that's weird. I can't reproduce it. Which version of ParaView are
you using?

On another note, I don't think that you need that line. The executive
should set the DATA_TIME_STEPS() to be the same as the
UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() for you.

I am not sure that I understand. Are Q1 and Q2 vectors? Are you trying
to divide the component by component?

That's it.
In the Calculator, I would set the formula : Q1/Q4*iHat + Q2/Q4*jHat +
Q3/Q4*kHat.

In the programmable filter, there is some facilities in order to use numpy
arrays. But what should be the dimensions of the numpy array if we want to
add a vector by doing something like "block.PointData.append(array, 'newQ')"
?

The 3.8.0.
I can reproduce it, using a simple programmable source and scripting :


output = self.GetOutput()

output.GetInformation().Remove(output.DATA_TIME_STEPS())

output.GetInformation().Append(output.DATA_TIME_STEPS(), 0.5)

I will try to remove that line.

Hi Utkarsh,

thanks for your reply. I got 3.8.1 to work easily on my MacBook and tracing
works well. I found on the web that you fixed the bug
0008723<http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=8723>,
and I need to remove the center of rotation from my animations. I downloaded
the latest 'nightly snapshot' using git, and copied the Python modules from
there into the directory of my Mac binary, replacing the ones that come with
the .dmg file. The removal or addition of the center of rotation still
doesn't show in the trace though, and I haven't been able to find the new
method in the python modules. Is it there, and how to find it? Thanks,

Milos

The ability to toggle center/orientation axes didn't make it into
3.8.1. You can either use the git-master (3.9) or wait for 3.10. In
3.9 onwards, the following should work:


RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
RenderView1.OrientationAxesVisibility = 1
RenderView1.CenterAxesVisibility = 1

OK, I tried it, but it doesn't work. I get the following output

 RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

>>> RenderView1.OrientationAxesVisibility = 0

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<console>", line 1, in ?

File "/Applications/ParaView
3.8.1-RC1.app/Contents/Python/paraview/servermanager.py", line 207, in
__setattr__

raise AttributeError("Attribute %s does not exist. " % name +

AttributeError: Attribute OrientationAxesVisibility does not exist. This
class does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to
typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.


I am sure that I have the latest module; I double-checked with git that I
have the master (and I copied the module again).

I don't understand what you mean by "copied the module". Merely
copying the python files won't work. You need a full source build done
using git-master.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.8.1 RC1 Available for download
Message-ID: <AANLkTin4sdjK6Zck4JudOWvpmNg3LkkxarXhsjZknonn@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

The ParaView team is pleased to announce the availability of the ParaView
3.8.1 Release Candidate 1 binaries for download on the ParaView download
page. Final binaries should follow shortly.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Release Notes:

ParaView 3.8.1 is a patch release over 3.8.0 with a a small set
of improvements. Some of noteworthy improvements/fixes are:

ParaView now comes HDF5 1.8.5. This enables developers to create
readers/plugins for ParaView that use newer versions of HDF5 easily. Also we
are now including the C++ and the high level (hl) versions of the libraryfor
those who wish to use their newer API.

Among the improvements are two new file formats. The first is a netcdf based
reader for MPAS format ocean and atmosphere data sets. The second, available
in source form only is a reader plugin that allows ParaView to read
multi-resolution wavelet compressed VAPOR data format files. Thanks to John
Clyne and Dan Legreca for contributing the VAPOR plugin.

We have improved the support for animation scripting through Python. The new
API is more coherant with the rest of ParaView Python API avoid the need
for script writers to know the minute details of how to create animations
using proxies. Tracing capabilies for animation were also revised.

GPU volume ray cast mapper for voxel datasets now works in tile display mode
as well.

In keeping with our on going improvements of the ParaView's
charting capabilities, we have included a few more fixes regarding labels
and axes placements.

We also cleaned up ParaView build and install rules so that developers
don't have to worry about 'rpath' anymore. Also "make install" has been
vastly improved on all platforms.

This release also includes a material interface extraction filter thattakes
a cell data volume fraction and generates a polydata surface. It also
performs connectivity on the particles and generates a particle index as
part of the cell data of the output. It computes the volume of each particle
from the volume fraction. The filter is accessible from the Material
Analysis category in the Filters menu.

As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better. Please use
http://paraview.uservoice.com/ or click on the "Tell us what you think" link
on paraview.org to leave your feedback and vote for new features.

I tried with 3.8.0 on Mac OS X. I still can't reproduce it. Which
operating system are you using? Is this with out binary or did you
build it yourself?

Ah I see. Since you have NumPy enabled, it would be simplest to use
the Python Calculator with:

Q1 / Q4

Let me know if this does not work. I am not sure how functional Python
Calculator was in 3.8. This would definitely work on the development
version.

As far as the Programmable Filter, it sounds like we need to make some
improvements on iterating over blocks. The code that you use is
incorrect but the correct version is not easy to write (although
possible).

By the way, if you use the development version, you will have access
to whole lot more functions in the Python Calculator (and Programmable
Filter). See http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Calculator

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting velocity vectors
Message-ID: <DA7197DE-AF1F-4DD1-B873-319EDE1F9213@gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a CSV file which contains velocities u, v and w in different points x, y, z. One line of the file is list structured as follows:
nodenumber, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, z-coordinate, x-velocity u, y-velocity v, z-velocity w

The y-coordinate is constant and y-velocity ~= 0 so therefore the situation is practically 2D. I know how to make a plot of scalar values using the filter 'Table to points' but now I have vectors instead of scalars. How should I proceed in order to plot the vectors, as in the example picture
http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/fluent/airfoil/step6_clip_image005_0000.jpg

Another question, the velocities have the unit of m/s but I would like to have them plotted in mm/s. Is there any way to do this in Paraview or would it be easier to manipulate the CSV file itself?

BR

Ok - thanks John. I just pulled those changes.

I did a quick visualization using the SPHProbe(gridsource) using the
Shepard kernel and compared with the raw VTK method suggested by Jean
and the appear very similar, but still have some slight differences.

I have attached a screenshot of the viz where you can see some slight
variation in the corner.  The only other difference I can pick up is
in the range of 'datavalue'.   The SPHProbe(gridsource) has a slightly
smaller range (i.e. smaller magnitude high and low values) than I
obtained via the raw VTK method.

I'm not sure if these are expected outputs so I thought I would pass it along.

Thanks again!

Dan

The shepard mode only interpolates. However, for general scalars is v. useful. I would prefer the meshless plugin over the vtkShepardMethod filter for general flexibility.

Hello,

I am writing a reader and I display information in the Object inspector 
(that is easy).

Then depending on the information of the file, a will like to display in 
the "object inspector" some fields, that must be filled by the user 
(double) (a slider should work also).

How can add fields (sliders...) to the Properties panel on the fly (at 
running time).

Thanks

Hi I'm new to Paraview, I'm looking for a way to visualize the
skinfriction as an oil pattern plot over an object imported via ensight.
In fluent it's very simple but I don't know the steps for doing it in
Paraview. I have seen multiple examples of this on Internet but I can't
get it to work. I'm using a desktop with windows 7.
 
Many Thanks in advance

Lars,
 
There are two ways:
 
1) Create a vector of your skin friction components using the calculator.
Turn on Surface LIC (you'll require GPU support for this to work).
 
2) Create a vector as above. Extract your region of interest with Extract
Block. Use Mask Points and set it to random and give it a sensible number.
Then use streamlines with custom filter. Your input is the Extract Block,
your source is the Mask Points, and your vector is skin friction.
 
hope this helps,
 
Adriano

Subject: [Paraview] ... something really weird.... dependance with
	matplotlib version ?
Message-ID: <AANLkTinCrGQi8sgptcf6h7X-3QvQNwUXNK+nV8t=UwdW@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Upgrading my version of matplotlib, I encountered a really weird problem.

Before, with the 0.99.1.1 version of matplotlib, I could calculate (in the
calculator),
e_interne*(1.4-1)/286.95 without any problem.

After upgrading, the result of this calculation is zero everywhere...

Is there any explanation for this ?

... Ok.... I think this is rather a dependance with the version of vtk.

Doing this in a programmable filter in paraview

from paraview import vtk

i = self.GetInput()

o = self.GetOutput()

b = i.GetBlock(1)

c = vtk.vtkArrayCalculator()

c.SetInput(b)

c.SetFunction('1.4')

c.SetResultArrayName('test')

c.Update()

print c.GetOutput().GetPointData().GetArray('test').GetTuple1(1)

it prints 1.0


While doing this in the python console, il prints 1.4


... I think I should use pvpython, in order to work with the same version of
vtk ...

you using binaries from www.paraview.org?

Hello Dave,

I build Paraview 3.8.0 (and soon the 3.8.1-RC1)
Do you confirm that it comes from the version of vtk, and the compatibility
of the vtkArrayCalculator with '.' and ','  for floats ?

I tried it with a vtkPolyData and vtkUnstructuredGrid input within ParaView
3.8.0 and it worked fine. Is it just with a multiblock data-set you are
having issues?

No, it seems that it doesn't depend on the type of data. (I've tried with
structured bloc and poly data)

I tried with the binary version 3.8 too... same effect.
I will try with the 3.8.1, but I think I will have to replace all the dots
by comas.

Are you asking about pre-built binaries? We don't distribute
mpi-enabled pre-built binaries (except for mac). You will have to
build from source:

Aurelien,

I have similar problem with the calculator in  ParaView version 3.8.0.

I do have to set  "export LANG=C" before running paraview, as my system is  set up to use  language for which decimal is "," and not "."

Actually, we do have pre-built binaries for windows using MS-MPI on the
download page too.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with disconnecting from the builtin server in
	pvpython
Message-ID: <1284569937.3948.14.camel@lenovo-laptop>

Hi,

actually I have the same question as in this previous email:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-March/007506.html

I use the python interface in an application that I am developing and I
import paraview with:

from paraview.simple import *

During the import a connection to the builtin server is also established
silently. Though, in my application I need to clear the pipeline
occasionally in order to begin with a new output, so I tried
disconnecting from the server with:

servermanager.Disconnect(servermanager.ActiveConnection)

but I receive the error:

ERROR:
In /build/buildd/paraview-3.8.0/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx, line 175
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x1d33240): Invalid connection ID: 5

This behavior is tested with ParaView 3.8.0 on Ubuntu 10.04.

I would be glad for any hints.

Kind Regards

Kostas

In the meanwhile I have realized that the error occurs only when I
include a Delete() statement in my script. Thus the following very
simple script reproduces the error:

import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/lib/paraview')
from paraview.simple import *
cone = Cone()
Delete(cone)
servermanager.Disconnect(servermanager.ActiveConnection)

Hopefully someone can explain this behavior.

I'm afraid your use case is not well supported.  There is logic in the
paraview gui application that ensures a clean disconnect, which includes a
hard reset of the python interpreter context.  Using only python modules,
there is manual clean up required after a disconnect that is not yet
supported.

You might find that your script still works, you'll just be be spammed with
those error messages.  Also, try calling Connect() instead of
servermanager.Disconnect(...).  This will disconnect & reconnect a little
more cleanly, but still not perfect.

If your intention is to just clear the pipeline, try this code, copied from
the paraview coprocessor template:

def GetProxiesToDelete():
    iter = servermanager.vtkSMProxyIterator()
    iter.Begin()
    tobedeleted = []
    while not iter.IsAtEnd():
      if iter.GetGroup().find("prototypes") != -1:
         iter.Next()
         continue
      proxy = servermanager._getPyProxy(iter.GetProxy())
      proxygroup = iter.GetGroup()
      iter.Next()
      if proxygroup != 'timekeeper' and proxy != None and
proxygroup.find("pq_helper_proxies") == -1 :
          tobedeleted.append(proxy)

    return tobedeleted

# explicitly delete the proxies -- we do it this way to avoid problems with
prototypes
tobedeleted = GetProxiesToDelete()
while len(tobedeleted) > 0:
   Delete(tobedeleted[0])
   tobedeleted = GetProxiesToDelete()

Subject: [Paraview] File format for CFD
Message-ID: <201009152140.07649.bart.janssens@rma.ac.be>

Hi all,

I want to get data from our finite element CFD solver into paraview, so I'd 
like to write an exporter that writes in the format that is best suited and 
well supported by existing paraview readers. It should be possible to read 
large data sets in parallel, with good performance.

Currently, I'm considering using the VTK file format with a .pvd xml at the top 
level, but I have some concerns:
- When importing data using EnSight, it names the zones correctly, i.e. if you 
had a group of 2D cells called "inlet", it would show up in the tree and can 
be filtered with ExtractBlock. Is it possible to assign names using the VTK/pvd 
format?
- The boundary zones would have to be separate blocks, as I understand. Is it 
possible for them to reuse the point data of the volume mesh? In our solver, 
the points are stored only once, and different zones can point to indices in 
one big array of coordinates.
- When using multiple blocks as a result of parallelization, are points at the 
boundaries between blocks duplicated? If not, how is this specified?

Kind regards,

Bart

Thank you for the quick response. You are right, what I actually need is
to clear the pipeline. Your snippet seems to work well except some
naming counters which are not reset but in my use case this isn't very
important.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Best Regards

Kostas

Hi,

I have a related question. I would like to use the Python interface to
create movies of large datasets from .png files. Having the .pngs gives me
flexibility in encoding them. I know that ParaView can export animations as
.pngs files, but I would like to do this in offscreen mode and without
running the animation in ParaView first.

I haven't been able to figure out how to run a single instance of ParaView
during every iteration of a loop over file names (or, say, camera angles)
within a Python script, i.e. open ParaView, work on one file, output a .png,
and then close ParaView.

The fix below with clearing the pipeline each time seems to work, but I was
wondering if it would be possible to invoke ParaView 'from scratch' during
each call and how. Also, would there be any disadvantages to doing that, as
opposed to having a single instance of ParaView during the entire loop and
clearing the pipeline as below?

I apologize if this has been discussed, but I haven't been able to find any
of those discussions if so.

Milos

Just to make sure, we are talking about an unstructured mesh, right?

Why not something like-


import subprocess

for f in filenames:
  subprocess.call(["/path/to/pvpython", "process_single_dataset.py", f])

This works indeed. It's been a while since I have programmed in Python, I
should have thought of it :) Thank you very much!

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch (3.8.0) rendering through OSmesa does not work
 on multiple nodes
Message-ID: <7DB5AD05697FA549A4295DA1D0E58522B4F893A05B@UOS-CL-EX7-L1.soton.ac.uk>

Hi,

I compiled paraview 3.8 (pvbatch) without X and with OSmesa support to run on the university cluster. When I submit a pvbatch job it works fine on just 1 node of the cluster (max 8 procs) however the rendering goes wrong when using 2 or more nodes on the cluster. I tried this with OSMesa 6.5.3 and with a patched version of OSMesa 7.8.2 from here http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=91c37599f621a0ec498c0f0add14f16470ca852b

I submitted this as a bug  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=11038 but got a reply that I should ask the mailing list which version of OSMesa is most reliable. So could someone let me know if they experienced similar problems and tell me which version of OSMesa they use to solve it?

Thanks,

Koen

So this is a typically French problem... ! Thank you Joelle for the
information, it works fine now.....
And so not having to do the export each time I lauch Paraview, I preferred
to change the language of my system in English.

But I'm glad I noticed this, before making too many screen-shots... !

Just a word for the paraview developpers : maybe it could be usefull to
display an error message when the format of floats in a formula is not
consistent with that of the system ? ..... Or maybe the format of numbers in
Paraview should not depend on the system language ?

Hi,

I've had the exact same problem last week with ParaView git/master on
Linux x86_64 with Mesa 7.8.2, having applied the patch you mentioned to
the Mesa 7.8.2 sources. (It's also the only patch present in the Mesa
git master for that particular bug,
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10966.)
Whenever I tried to save an animation from the ParaView client (builtin
mode), ParaView still crashed. I tried to avoid that by removing a
duplicate call of OSMesaMakeCurrent() from the VTK sources by means of

> diff --git a/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx b/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx
> index 5a87aae..493a3fb 100644

>        }
> -    this->MakeCurrent();

>    else
>  #endif

but that turned out to be not sufficient, OSMesaMakeCurrent() is still
called multiple times when ParaView git/master is trying to save an
animation.

I reverted to Mesa 7.5.2 to resolve the issue.

Hope this helps
Sven

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView-3.8.0 CAVE display Linux
Message-ID: <1284612320.3844.267.camel@localhost>

Hi,
For the CAVE, we use ParaView 2.6.1 with success. With 3.8.0, we are
having issues. We use the same PVX file and machine file and similar
start scripts. There are only 4 machines (vis1,vis2,vis3,vis4) in
addition to the client. The 8 names in the PVX and machines files are
aliases to prevent duplicates since there are 2 X11 screens per machine.

Before building PV-3.8.0 I set

this->StereoType = VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES;

in VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderWindow.cxx which used to set the default
stereo but regardless it comes up with red/blue stereo (in the paraview
client the graphics window is purple). This works without a problem in
PV-2.6.1. So, first question - where do I set default stereo?

When running the paraview3-cave script (see below), the following
occurs.
$ paraview3-cave
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
# At this point the paraview client opens, connects (or attempts to)
# with the servers, each of the screens flash but return to the default
# desktop. The paraview client continues to function normally, but
# nothing is displayed on the CAVE walls. On exit...
mpirun: killing job...


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun noticed that process rank 7 with PID 3175 on node vis4bottom
exited on signal 0 (Unknown signal 0).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8 total processes killed (some possibly by mpirun during cleanup)
mpirun: clean termination accomplished

Has anyone successfully run PV-3.8.0 in a CAVE environment? If so,
please help.

Thanks,
Pat

This issue has been addressed in git-master. The following commit
explicitly sets the locate to "C".

commit cd1b14208b79b8c7773c4bbc10eaf25c680b65c5
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>

    setlocale to avoid locale related numeric issues.

    This now affects all executables, not merely Qt-based ones.

We've stumbled upon the same issue. The most recent versions of OSMesa crash
when making multiple calls to MakeCurrent as they will attempt to create a
new render buffer each time. As Sven mentioned, it has been reported to the
Mesa Community. You can view our own findings related to this issue in these
VTK and ParaView bugs.

http://www.vtk <http://www.cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=10900>
.org/Bug/view.php?id=10900 <http://www.cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=10900>

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=11163<http://www.cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=11163>

I would recommend using mesa 7.0.4 or 7.5.x until the issue is fixed
upstream.

My dashboard builds from *.hooperlab and murron.hobbs-hancock use mesa
from the git repository.

Is there any test that shows whether this bug has been fixed?

Humm, it must be fixed then in their git repo as all the rendering tests
would fail. Which was the case, on those dashboards about a month ago if I
remember correctly?

Hello,

If you want to use LIC, remember that the LIC plugin is not loaded by 
default, at least with PV 3.8.0.
When starting Paraview, choose in the menu Tools->Manage plugins.
That opens a new window, and the right panel "Local plugins" should show 
all available plugins in your install. Select "Surface LIC" if its 
property is "Not Loaded", click the "Load Selected" button, then click 
on the "Close" button.
You will have to do that each time you start PV and need LIC, but you 
may want LIC to be automatically loaded when you start PV: click the + 
sign on the left of "Surface LIC" in the "Local plugins" panel, then 
check the "Auto Load" box.

Hi,

When responding please also respond to the mailing list to share with
everyone.

There are no current plans to release installers that include Mpich2 or
HP-mpi.  You'll have to build paraview yourself in order to use them.

That said, have you tried using the MS-MPI binaries? I believe MS-MPI was
based off and designed with the intent of maintaining maximum compatibility
with MPICH2.

You do remember correctly, but there were many reasons why large numbers

Hello,
is there any news regarding a CGNS reader?

Which are the development plans?
I really need such a functionality and I wonder if I should consider developping it or not.
Thx in advance for your answers.

Hi,
We're looking to create custom navigation and interaction for ParaView
in a CAVE using IS900 tracked head and wand devices. What is the best
way to update the camera? How would the camera be accessed? Can it be
done through some sort of plugin or would it be necessary to customize
VTK or ParaView source?

Thanks,
Pat

You can easily access the camera using a plugin. Look at auto-start
plugins (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Autostart_Plugins).
In the startup code for the plugin,you can add a slot to observe the
viewChanged() signal from pqActiveObjects singleton. Your slot will
then be called every time the active view changes. To get the camera
from the view, use the following code:


pqView* view = pqActiveObjects::instance()->activeView();
if (view)
  {
  vtkSMRenderViewProxy* proxy =
vtkSMRenderViewProxy::SafeDownCast(view->getProxy());
  if (proxy)
    {
    vtkCamera* camera = proxy->GetActiveCamera();
    }
  }

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I think I actually want
the setActiveView slot from the pqActiveObjects but need a plugin
function to run whenever head, wand, joystick and/or buttons are updated
and to run in its own thread using a select to wake only when new data
is available. Of course, if the function were called once per frame then
things would still work. Is there a signal for post-frame (completion of
swap) or pre-frame (prior to render start) I could connect to a slot in
my plugin?

If not, can I just use pthreads or would qt or vtk threads be preferred
or work better?

Thanks,
Pat

I'm pretty sure that someone at Kitware is in the late stages of 
adding David Borland's VRPN/VTK code into the repository, which will 
let you get at IS trackers (and others). This is part of a process to 
make Paraview work in CAVEs.

Utkarsh, do you want to share the state of this -- or is this the 
person who is doing the work?

Thanks,

You need to install X Server Packages on the nodes as OpenGL needs a Window
context to run in.
 
I just run pvserver without any window manager using xinit to invoke the X
Server. The following commands work for me...

1) Run a single instance (X Server shuts down when complete) xinit
<fullpath>/pvserver 

2) Run multiple instances (X Server shuts down when complete) xinit
<fullpath>/mpirun -np 16 ./pvserver

3) Run multiple instances across multiple GPUs (X Server shuts down when
complete) xinit <fullpath>/mpirun -bynode -np 8 ./pvserver -display :0.0 :
-np 8 ./pvserver -display :0.1

The <fullpath> is important, just passing "pvserver" to xinit won't work.

Note the following reading helped me:

Message-ID: <FFECDB830479425EAB7B778FEE7CAA94@notebook>

Hi All,

I am aware that for GPU volume rendering there is a default setting for
memory that can be changed to suit the GPU card. The following is what we do
(though I know this could be improved with extra effort).

#  change memory request from 128M to 1.5G in Volume Code
# vi $TEMP_BUILD/ParaView/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkGPUVolumeRayCastMapper.cxx
#
#   if(this->MaxMemoryInBytes==0) // use some default value: 128MB.
#     {
#     // this->MaxMemoryInBytes=128*1024*1024; // old
#     this->MaxMemoryInBytes=1532*1024*1024;   // new
#     }

Are there any other parts of ParaView/VTK which would benefit from changing
hardcoded values to suit a particular GPU?

Cheers,

Paul

My 3D picature consists of 3 vtp files. Now I open them one by one, is there
any way to open them all at the same time?

Hi Kicki,

if you write a vtm file that refer to your vtp ones, then you would
need only to load one file.
To build such a file, I guess you can append your 3 datasets into 1
with the append filter and save the given dataset into a file.

You can use the "Calculator" after Table to Points to create a vector
from 3 scalar values using the following expression:

iHat*x_velocity+jHat*y_velocity+kHat*z_velocity

You can also scale the values in the calculator itself to do any unit
conversions needed. Then you can apply the Glyph filter.

We should have basic CGNS functionality through the VisIt bridge in
the next release. However, I don't think that the VisIt reader fully
handles CGNS either. If you have time to invest in it, I'd recommend
developing a full-featured reader by starting from the VisIt one. And
hopefully contribute back to VTK so that the whole community can
benefit from it. If you decide to take this one, please let us know.
We can help.

I recently made some simple scripts which build on the nifty server management XML found on the wiki and allow you to launch jobs remotely, and have them connect back to you - from within the paraview GUI.

Explanation is here

If you make improvements (find ip etc) then please let me know. One thing I'd like to do, is all the above, but also have port forwarding, so you can launch the client locally, but have the compute nodes communicate via a service node and forward stuff back to you. I'm sure it can be done, but since port forwarding is disabled on our cray, I've not tried setting it up.

Hi John,

Attached is a simple socket relay program, pulled from Visit source code.
Not sure if this will be useful to you, but it gives you a simple program
like so-

   Usage ./socket_relay <target host> <target port> <listen port>

You could run this on a service node.  It works with ssh reverse tunnels
when gateway ports are disabled.  Use at your own risk :)

Thanks, I found the setting.  As you say I'm on a Mac and I've found 
Paraview(Menu bar menu)->Preferences.General

I'll try it out.

Thanks Pat, I'll store this for future reference. The XT5 has forwarding disabled, but one of the newer machines that we'll be experimenting with has it enabled so I'll try it there when we next do tests.

Note to anyone reading the original post : It has been pointed out to me that my 'Find_IP' scripts are not necessary because (thanks Jean) when you SSH into a remote machine, the shell var $SSH_CLIENT is set to the machine you came from. I wish I'd known that! it'd have saved me working on the windows batch file...

I'll update scripts accordingly on the wiki...

Hello,

I've a question about the pvserver of paraview. I started 8 pvservers on the Linux-Cluster and the GUI connected to them. All worked fine, but very slow. So I have increased the number of pvservers up to 32 processes in order to get a better performance. After I have loaded some files into Paraview, the pvservers crash, when I select a special representation like wireframe, surface etc..
I get the following error message:

Hi, I writing a reader and I will like to create a panel (in the object 
inspector) depending on the file information.

for example, adding (activating) a DoubleVectorProperty  with a custom 
name and a custom default value (depending of the information in the file).

A second question: I want to check the information that the user put 
into the panel, correct it and then put it back to the gui.
(How can I force paraview to update the gui with the information on the 
class?)

(until now I am compiling the reader as a plugins)

Thanks

It will be hard to track down otherwise.

For all such non standard tricks, you need to create a custom panel.
In  the custom panel code, you can update properties, gui elements
etc. as per your liking. There are custom panel examples in ParaView
code itself as well under the Examples directory.

Message-ID: <6B7BDE8D-1A9C-491D-8F23-C83EFFC8478B@u.washington.edu>

Hello,

I'm new to Paraview and am trying to use it to edit a VTK image.  My  
original image is in the structured points format.  I'm using the  
ExtractCellsByRegion filter to select a subset, which I save using  
Save Data with a VTK extension like the original.  However, I could  
not open this file using the ITK ImageFileReader.  I believe this is  
because the VTK file was saved as an unstructured grid instead of  
structured points.

Does anyone know why this is happening and how to change it?  I can  
look at converting it using ITK, but I'd like to know if there's a  
better solution.

Thanks,
Sara

VTK has a data type called structured grid that is different than image data (and also different than unstructured grid).  If ParaView is not telling you that your data is image data or a uniform grid, then the data you write out will be necessarily incompatible with reading it as an image file.

Well, I've been looking through the options some more, and it looks like 
Exodus II might be the way to go. If I understand correctly, I can supply an 
XML file that will name the different zones in the mesh.

There is a library available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/ , is 
that the recommended path to write Exodus II files?

Also, I found a reference to the full spec at 
http://endo.sandia.gov/SEACAS/Documentation/exodusII.pdf but I get 403 
Forbidden on that. Is the spec available from somewhere else, or is it not 
meant to be public?

Cheers,

Bart

Thanks for your reply!  I'm not having any trouble reading the  
original unstructured points as an image, but I didn't see why the  
data type was getting switched to an unstructured grid.

Now I've realize this was done by ExtractCellsByRegion, which makes  
sense.  I switched to Extract Subset, which outputs structured points,  
and this works just fine.  However, the ROI selection is pretty  
limited since it only allows the selection using a cube, from what I  
can tell.  I've also tried Extract Selection, but Paraview crashes  
each time I try to use the selection tools.

Any tips on a better way to do this would be appreciated!

Extract Cells by Region produces the most generic type (unstructured
grid) because the region can potentially be arbitrary. An arbitrary
region can not by definition preserve the very regular structure
inherent in the image data type.

ExtractSubset produces i,j,k aligned subspaces, not arbitrary ones,
thus is can preserve the data type.

I can't guess why selection is not working on your copy of ParaView.
However, once working, you should be aware that selection produces
arbitrary subsets. However here there is a flag, at the VTK level at
least, which makes selection mark all cells/points as either in or
out. In that case it can preserve the data type but you still have to
apply a later filter (threshold for instance) to remove the excess,
and that filter will change the type. The selection mode flag, if
exposed in ParaView would be on the Selection Inspector panel.

I want to make a plugin that will read a file (which contains a
transform) and apply it to the input of the plugin. Classically I have
had either:

  <ProxyGroup name="sources"> // for readers, lets me file->open to
select a file

or

  <ProxyGroup name="filters"> // for filters, to do something to the
selected object in the pipeline

For this plugin I want to do both. Is this possible?

I have attached my xml files. Could someone let me know how it needs
to be structured to achieve this?

Thanks,

David

Checkout the SLAC plugin reader it reads in a set of files and sets up a
pipeline and adds some gui buttons for some of SLAC's common operations.
After you load in the plugin you can click on the SLAC folder to bring up
the files to read in which are all in ParaView/Data/SLAC/pic-example/ and
are;
Mesh File: mrdh.ncdf
Mode File: fields_..,mod
Particle Files: particles_..ncdf

That plugin reader does a boat-load of stuff.  Unfortunately I just use it
for showing off paraview and have never actually looked at the code so I
can't give you much more direction than that.

Hi everyone,

I would like to know if it is possible to build a custom paraview (withe version 
3.8) in a specific directory out of Paraview directory source code (the same for 
a plugin).
I guess it is possible but I am new with cmake configuration and I would like to 
know how to do this.

Thank you.

Dear ParaView developers,

  I'm trying to compute gradient of my x-component of velocity on a  
grid of tetrahedra which has 55244 DOF. ParaView fails to compute the  
gradients with the following error message:

Generic Warning: In  
/home/kitware/Dashboard/MyTests/ParaView-3-8/ParaView-3.8/ParaView/VTK/Common/vtkMath.cxx, line  
1338
Unable to factor linear system

The mesh does not have degenerate/ugly elements, but it has some sharp  
edges (in the inlet/outlet area). Is this a problem? If not, is there  
a way of avoiding the error?

Thank you very much.

Easiest solution would be apply the transform within the reader
itself. You can easily create a vtk-level subclass for your reader
that can do that. Then this is just a reader.

Hello,

Yes, you can build custom (branded) versions of ParaView with 3.8. You can either build ParaView and all of its supporting libraries from source, and then build custom applications against that build, or you can now download a "ParaView Development Installation" which should have everything you need to build plugins and customized versions of ParaView against.

Maybe you already know this, but to see examples you need to get the source code and look in [pv_source]/Examples and in there are both CustomApplications and Plugins directories. All of these examples can be moved to a different location and built out of the ParaView source tree. Just make sure to make a copy of the whole directory, including the CMakeLists.txt file.

If you are having trouble running CMake to configure ParaView itself or a custom application or plugin, then maybe the ParaView:Build_And_Install wiki page will help:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

The documentation on building ParaView plugins is here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo

and custom applications is here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_Custom_Applications

All of which are linked off of the page I see Utkarsh just sent you.

Good luck,
-Eric

More information please.

How are you extracting the x-component of the velocity?  What filter are you running to compute the gradient?  Would it be possible to post some example data that exhibits the problem so that we can replicate it?

Dear ParaView developers,

The mesh does not have degenerate/ugly elements, but it has some sharp
edges (in the inlet/outlet area). Is this a problem? If not, is there
a way of avoiding the error?

Thank you very much.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin that is a reader and a filter
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTimhK3fDOOtmX5Mo5OouKvJAvZDHjSYgXZMX9eHk@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C8BF6E59.1A07E%kmorel@sandia.gov>

It's not clear to me exactly what the original question is asking.  Are you simply trying to define both a reader and filter in the same plugin?  In that case, you provide two ProxyGroup elements in the server manager definition and place the reader and filter in the appropriate one.

<ProxyGroup name="sources">
  // define reader
</ProxyGroup>
<ProxyGroup name="filters">
  // define filter
</ProxyGroup>

Is the question that you want the filter automatically applied when you open the file?  In that case, Utkarsh's solution of creating a new metareader in C++ that internally calls both the reader and filter is probably the cleanest solution.  It may also be possible to create a composite filter in ParaView.  However, I'm not sure anyone as actually tried to make a composite filter that starts with a reader, so the implementation in ParaView might not support that.

Do you really want to see both the reader and filter in the pipeline browser independently but have them both automatically created when the file is opened?  There is no way to do this with ParaView's conventional file open mechanism.  However, it's pretty easy to create a plugin that provides a toolbar button and/or a menu item that invokes a custom open operation that sets up whatever pipeline you want.  The Wiki plugin page has instructions on creating toolbar and menu actions in a plugin (which can be integrated in the same plugin where readers and filters are provided).  And as Andy stated, the SLACTools plugin has an example of providing one of these custom open operations.

Composite filters rather readers are indeed supported and will work.
The only problem here is that  there's no support for obtaining the
transform from the real-reader  and updating the tranform filter's
default transform value using the value read from the reader.

Hello Ken,

  I computed the x-velocity component using a calculator filter. Then  
I applied the 'Gradient of Unstructured Data Set' filter to the output  
of the previous filter. This is the place where the computation fails.  
I sent you the data in a private email.

I have compiled osmesa 7.5.2 and the newest release candidate osmesa 7.8.3-rc1. Unfortunately pvbatch 3.8.0 using either of these libraries gives the same output and the render error persists. I use the following command to configure / compile the osmesa library:

 ./configure --with-driver=osmesa --without-x --disable-glu --disable-egl --disable-gallium --prefix=/home/kvm/mesa752 --exec_prefix=/home/kvm/mesa752

Allthough it would be nice to solve this error it will not have my priority since I can easily render my dataset on a single node of the cluster.

After taking a look at your mesh, I see that the problem is that you have some degenerate tetrahedra.  That is, there are tetrahedra where all 4 vertices are in a plane.  In this case the tetrahedron is self-intersecting and the gradient is ill-defined (over constrained I believe), which is why the linear solver is failing to compute it.  You can find the degenerate tetrahedra by running the Mesh Quality filter to compute the volume of the tetrahedra and look for any resulting "Quality" that is not strictly greater than 0.

So, you can do one of two things.  The first is to ignore the errors.  I don't think that any of the degenerate cells are part of the surface (although I can't be sure), and since the end game is to compute values on the surface it might not effect anything.

The second thing you can do is to fix the mesh.  The best thing to do is to go back to whatever created the original mesh, fix it, and rerun the simulation.  There is a reasonable chance that these degenerate tetrahedra also had a negative impact on the simulation results.  If that's not practical, you can use the volume computed by the Mesh Quality filter and the Threshold filter to remove any tetrahedra that don't have a strictly positive volume.  That will mess up the connectivity of the mesh though.

Sorry if I was not clear.

Ideally I'd want to do the following:

1) click on a PolyData in the pipeline

2) go to Filter->ReadAndApplyTransform.

3) It should then ask me which transform file I want to read (the
"reader" functionality" I mentioned). My vtkReadAndApplyTransform
would then read this transform file and apply it to the PolyData on
the input port (provided by step #1)

If that isn't possible, then Utkarshs suggestion of applying the
transform in side the reader would be fine. The reader would prompt
for a file name. I would give it foo.vtp, then I would internally
create foo.xform. I looked into subclassing vtkXMLPolyDataReader but
it doesn't seem to work the same as other VTK classes? Typically I
just implement RequestData, but vtkXMLPolyDataReader doesn't have a
RequestData (it is in vtkXMLReader). How/where would I do everything
vtkXMLPolyDataReader normally does and get a vtkPolyData object that I
could then transform?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Probe cell index of unstructured grids
Message-ID: <AANLkTikTPmQw6wyT+Oc=ZpMMzDKX9B2WtX20AB1g3n5K@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'd like  to know how to probe cell index number of  unstructured grids.
For example, after loading unstructured data (typically Hexa or Tetra),
I hope to know the cell index like below:
1) set x, y, and z
2) automatically probe the index number of the cell that includes the
above (x,y,z) point

Sincerely yours,
Waku

Message-ID: <4C9B4922.2070400@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

I am writing a Reader (plugin) with a custom panel.

I will like to know, how can I transfer information (call a member 
function) from the Reader class (vtkMyReader) to my panel class 
(pqMyReaderPanel) and vice versa.

Right now I use the information stored in the gui (not very convenient).

Thanks

You cannot call a function on  the panel from the reader. ParaView is
designed to work in client-server configurations. In that case the
reader object is located on the server process with the panel is
located on the client and there's no way for the reader to call a
method on the client. If there's some information that you want to
pass from the reader to the panel, we have information_only properties
for that. At opportune times, the panel can call
vtkSMProxy::UpdatePropertyInformation() and have the information_only
properties repopulated by fetching server-side values.

To call a method on the reader from the panel, we have properties for
that. You define a property in XML and then update it from the panel
and call vtkSMPRoxy::UpdateVTKObjects() to push the property value.

Message-ID: <SNT123-W15AD2A3266A7535CC21AC0BC610@phx.gbl>


Hi!

My system was recently updated, especially the Graphics libraries and the Qt, and now I have problems configuring ParaView 3.4 and ParaView 3.6.2. The error I get is

CMake Error at Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt:555 (FILE):
   file GLOB requires a glob expression after the directory

I'm using CMake version 2.8.1 and my OS is Gentoo Linux release 1.12.13.

My Qt is now version 4.6.2

Any help would be really appreciated,
thanks a lot,
Natalie

In ParaView 3.8.0, go to Edit -> Find Data.  In that dialog box select Cell in the top combo box.  In the next line, select Cell in the first combo box, contains in the next combo box, and the x, y, z location in the following text boxes.  Click Run Selection Query and you will see the cell index along with any field data of that cell.

You could use subsequent clip filters to clip away further parts of the plane.

If you could provide the dataset or a complete example using data from
ParaViewData or a source I'll give it a try on our cluster which has (or
will have PV and Mesa from git now that Mesa's git seems to be back in
order).

I apologize for taking so long to answer this question. Your options are:

- EnSight
- Exodus
- VTK XML

If you are OK with linking against an external library to write out the data,
I would go with Exodus. You can download the library source and the
documentation
here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/

You will also need NetCDF. The best way of using Exodus in parallel is to
produce 1 file per partition. If you name them as a series, ParaView will
recognize that they represent a partitioned dataset.

If you are not OK with linking against an external library, I'd go with EnSight.
The current reader can read a single EnSight in parallel but you also have the
option of using the SoS format if you want to write 1 file per partition.

Right now, VTK XML is not as good because it is missing some features such
as the ability to name blocks. We will work on making these improvements
in the near future.

Also, we will be performing some scalability studies with these formats. I will
keep the mailing list in the loop as we get some results.

Best,
-berk

Hi,

I am using pvpython for some python scripts to visualise CFD data.
Unfortunately, I could not figure out, how to prevent windows popping up 
during the run. I assume that there is some simple way to tell paraview 
not to show the window!? Does anyone can give me a hint?

Thanks!

You'll have to compile with OSMesa
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#OSMesa_support)
and then run pvbatch with --use-offscreen-rendering command line option.

If you are using Gnome desktop, there is a great program called devilspie
that you can use to add window management rules.  You could create a rule
that says- minimize any new window with 'vtk' in the title.  This might be
faster than using mesa rendering.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimsDFo=PuUYFkRfwVwOgmoju-xEQ2AwmEiwBz_S@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

To display ONE implicit function F(x,y,z)=0, I use vtksamplefunction,
as shown below. The output of vtkSampleFunction in ImageData format is
written to a file using vtkXMLImageDataWritter.   How do I write MANY
implicit functions in one single file?  Put them into cells of
unstructured grids?

ImpFunc* function = ImpFunc::New();
vtkSampleFunction* sample = vtkSampleFunction::New();
sample->SetImplicitFunction(function);
sample->SetModelBounds(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax);
sample->SetSampleDimensions(20,20,20);
sample->ComputeNormalsOff();
sample->Update();
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLImageDataWriter> writer = vtkXMLImageDataWriter::New();
writer->SetFileName(string a);
writer->SetInput(sample->GetOutput());
writer->Write();


Yours,

Hi,

I am new to paraview and i want to know how to extract wall boundary cells
in paraview. I am simulating a 3D airfoil which specified as as wall
boundary.

I am using code saturne which is an open source and finite volume solver
and the results i get are in Ensight gold format. I need to see only
airfoil(wall) so that i can see pressure distribution

Is it also possible to get velocity magnitude at inlet and outlet boundaries

Subject: [Paraview] The best way to extract a disc on a surface ?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikNaZY3VF983sYVHhRHPZ6AokPkRoVfZ_n+ew9n@mail.gmail.com>

Good Morning,

I am trying to extract a disc on a surface, that would represent the
sensitive surface of a pressure sensor.
I tried to use the "Extract Cells by Region" filter, but the sensitive
surface could be, in some cases, smaller than the size of a cell. And in
these cases, this filter don't work properly.

So I would like to create a disk on the surface, and then interpolate the
values on this disc.
Is there a simple way to do this ? Knowing that I can also directly use the
vtk library.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable Source
Message-ID: <4C9C69F3.4060101@ed.ac.uk>

I am unsure how best to do what I want to do which I shall now describe.

I have a Python program that reads in data in a format not supported by 
ParaView (it actually reads from more than one file which contain 
different sorts of data). It reformats the data and then writes it out 
in VTK Legacy format which can then be used as a source by ParaView.

I want to adapt this so that it can be used as an element in a pipeline.

Is the best way to do this to rejig the code so that it can be used in a 
Programmable Source that produces Grid Structured Data? If I do this can 
I easily distribute the Source to my collaborators?

Is an alternative to create a Plugin that wraps the Python code in C++?

	vtkCamera.Zoom
Message-ID: <AANLkTimKqtzpZYowuKKngrvPRhg2+TmyfKO29+wE3KZj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to be able to zoom during an animation using perspective
projection. I am doing everything via a Python script. For parallel
projection, the transformation is simple and one zooms just by changing a
constant factor, i.e., setting the CameraParallelScale variable, and the
camera doesn't 'move'.

In parallel projection, however, one needs to change the actual camera
position and the transformation is not that simple. Looking at the Python
trace after zooming with the middle button, ParaView just reports the new
camera position, but not how it was calculated.

Looking at vtk documentation, there is a class called vtkCamera, which can
be zoomed simply, just using vtkCamera.Zoom(float), which supposedly zooms
properly both in parallel and perspective projections, at least according to
the documentation. What I can't figure out is how to call a renderer using
the vtk module and create the vtkCamera for that renderer, i.e., there would
be a RenderView object V of some sort, and we would just set

V.vtkCamera.Zoom(float)

However, there is no vtkRenderView or vtkView within the vtk Python classes
provided by the module that comes with ParaView. Would someone be able to
tell me what GetRenderView() in paraview acually calls? Or if I am headed in
the wrong direction, how should this be done properly? I hope I don't have
to code up all the transformations by hand to obtain the new camera position
for parallel projection...Thanks,

Milos

I just saw what I wrote...in second and fourth paragraph, I mean
*perspective*, not parallel projection...

Hello David,

I am in the same situation.
Here is what I have done :

   1. Create the reader in python, that works with pvpython, and returns (in
   my case) a vtkMultiBlockDataSet
   2. Then create a "MyReader.xml" file.
   That calls a vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, in which I import my reader and
   execute it.

Here is the contents of this file

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">

  <!-- server manager xml for a python script that reads a file
       the auto generated panel for this exposes everything more than we
want so
       a custom panel would be good -->
    <SourceProxy name="ReaderV3D" class="vtkPythonProgrammableFilter"
                 label="ReaderV3D">
      <Documentation
         long_help=""
         short_help="">
      </Documentation>

      <!-- data set type -->
      <IntVectorProperty
        name="OutputDataSetType"
        command="SetOutputDataSetType"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="13">
        <!-- value of 13 means MultiBlockDataSet -->
      </IntVectorProperty>

      <!-- the script -->
     <StringVectorProperty
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="import pyturbo; pdo = self.GetOutput();data =
pyturbo.read(file);pdo.DeepCopy(data);">
<!--
       <Hints>
         <Widget type="multi_line"/>
       </Hints>
-->
     </StringVectorProperty>

      <!-- python script references a variable "file"
          we expose this as a property allowing the user to set it -->
     <StringVectorProperty
       name="file"
       command="SetParameter"
       number_of_elements="2"
       default_values_delimiter=";"
       default_values="file;'give_the_path_of_the_file'">
     </StringVectorProperty>

    </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

Note that if you want to give a string as argument, you have to use the
quotation marks.
At this point, you just have to import the .xml as a plugin in Paraview

That may correspond to what you want to do.

A.Marsan

Hi,

To display ONE implicit function F(x,y,z)=0, I use vtksamplefunction,
as shown below. The output of vtkSampleFunction in ImageData format is
written to a file using vtkXMLImageDataWritter.   How do I write MANY
implicit functions in one single file?  Put them into cells of
unstructured grids?

ImpFunc* function = ImpFunc::New();
vtkSampleFunction* sample = vtkSampleFunction::New();
sample->SetImplicitFunction(function);
sample->SetModelBounds(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax);
sample->SetSampleDimensions(20,20,20);
sample->ComputeNormalsOff();
sample->Update();
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLImageDataWriter> writer = vtkXMLImageDataWriter::New();
writer->SetFileName(string a);
writer->SetInput(sample->GetOutput());
writer->Write();

While eating, I have thought of a feature that could be interesting :
A filter that would generate a certain number of points randomly placed on
the intersection of a surface, specified by the user, and a box or a sphere.

Do you have any suggestions in order to do this easily, using the existing
filters ?

Try using the vtkAppendFilter to append all ths functions into a
single unstructured grid, and then write that output. BTW, since this
is a VTK question, it's best asked on the VTK users list and not
ParaView user's list.

Message-ID: <SNT123-W1454339619B4597C0A64A9BC620@phx.gbl>


Hi everybody,

I would like to implement a filter to ParaView which calculates the radius of curvature of streamlines. 

I've browsed a little and found that there is already a curvature filter, which calculates the Gaussian curvature and the mean curvature using vtkCurvatures. This is nearly what I need, but somehow, I cannot apply it to the streamlines, I get the error message

No points/cells to operate on. 

Maybe you could point me to a source where the functionality of vtkCurvatures is explained in detail and the usage described. 

Thanks a lot,
Natalie

Subject: [Paraview] contour programmable filter
Message-ID: <4C9CF490.5030207@free.fr>

Hi everybody,

I begin with Paraview and I would like to have a variable input (like 
the maximum temperature at each time step) for the isosurface into the 
contour filter.
In this way, I created a programmable filter to get the maximum 
temperature :

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
temperature = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("temperature")

max=-1.0
for i in range(0, numPoints):
    if (max < temperature.GetValue(i)):
        max = temperature.GetValue(i)
print(max)

But, now my problem is how create the contour filter ?
I tried with :

cf = vtk.vtkContourGrid()
cf.SetInputConnection(pdo)
cf.SetValue(1,0.1)

but I didn't obtained some images. Perhaps I need some lines code with 
self.GetPolyDataOutput() ?

Thanks in advance,
Guillaume

Using the maximum value of any scalar field as the threshold for an isosurface will always give a null object. In fact, the smallest isosurface you could ever construct is a single triangle, intersecting 3 edges connecting one vertex greater than your threshold, and three other vertices below your threshold.

this is the second case in this figure: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MarchingCubes.svg

you should rethink your strategy of using the maximum value as input threshold.

That being said, there is a much faster way to get the range (the min and maximum) of a scalar field from within the Pogrammable Filter. Simply use GetRange()

max = temperature.GetRange()[1]

Also, since it's EnSight Gold, you should have a multi-block dataset, and 
using the ExtractBlock filter may allow you to extract the boundaries by name, 
depending on how your case is set up and how well it is exported to EnSight.

  Just to expand a little on Bart Janssens' comments --

The EnSight Gold binary results-file format has a "part"-construct. It 
allows the simulation results to be stored (and displayed in ParaView) 
as a collection of parts.

(1) Each part needs to be a complete, displayable graphics object; the 
part can reference the original nodal point set. As far as I know, all 
parts must have the same set of point and cell variables.

(2) The definition of a "part" is up to the simulation code developer. 
It can be any datum subset the developer wants to isolate and display, 
and it need not be anything recognizable by the original simulation 
code, for example, the wing surface. That is, it can be generated "on 
the fly" as the EnSight Gold results file is being written.

(3) Indeed, any collection of parts (one or more) may be accessed with 
the Extract Blocks filter.

I routinely subdivide my simulations into "parts" based on materials 
since I have objects  that have anywhere from 2 to 30 different 
materials (and each constructed from a variety of finite elements). I 
routinely write a time=0.0 EnSight Gold mesh file with node-sets and 
side-sets (surface facet sets) to which BC's are applied for model 
checking. The node-sets and side-sets are individually displayable 
graphics objects with cells with data.

Regards,

Sam Key

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver client does not know PATH
Message-ID: <4C9F3C46.6090605@gmx.de>

Hello,

I try to use pvserver from a compiled 3.8.0 version. Trying to access 
this with the client just pointing to localhost and port 1111 (this 
correspond to the server) I get the message, that the PATH and 
permissions are not correct:

IBusInputContext::createInputContext: no connection to ibus-daemon
Waiting for server...
The startup command failed to start ... check your PATH and file 
permissions
Waiting for server...
The startup command failed to start ... check your PATH and file permissions

I probably do something stupid, but I can't figure out the error as the 
path and permission should be available for the paraview directories!?
Would be nice, if you have an suggestion...

Regards!
Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] zoom control
Message-ID: <COL120-W2829995B46513CC8F321C4EB640@phx.gbl>


Hello,

I am using Paraview 3.2.3 on Ubuntu Linux to visualize 3D CFD data for my master's thesis.  I would like to be able to take screenshots of multiple datasets at the exact same viewpoint for comparison purposes.  While I can accomplish this by loading more than one dataset and hiding all but one, taking a screenshot and repeating for the other datasets, this is not really a solution because I will run out of memory before I can load everything I want to capture.  

I am using pvsm files to save the state, which works fine, except that when the state loads, the camera settings are all exactly as I left them, but the view is zoomed way in on the dataset.  I cannot find any way to control the exact amount of zoom so as to take consistent screenshots between pvsm loads.  

I have played with lookmarks some, but they seem to suffer the same zooming issue I just mentioned.  

Aside from changing file and pathnames in the pvsm files to get exact Paraview states for multiple datasets, I have been using the program exclusively interactively.  

Any help would be much appreciated.  

Regards,
Bryan Hinson

  3.2.3 is ancient. It will be well worth your while to upgrade.

The latest PV release has the ability to save/restore views, and assign 
custom views to a set buttons for quick access. This is found in the 
"adjust camera" dialog which is opened by the small button on top of the 
the 3D view.

> Hi,

Thnx for your suggestions for selecting wall boundary.
I checked my ensight gold data in paraview and i found their exit boundary
block but it includes all boundary and i cant separate the the wall
bounday from boundary block. Extract subset option is also not activated.

what changes should i make while making the geometry and defining boundary
condition so that i see all different boundaries and can evaluate them
separately. I use Gambit to genrate the grid and apply boundary conditions

Kind Regards

Mubashir

Subject: [Paraview] Error building paraview server without X server support:
	vtkXdmf fails
Message-ID: <AANLkTim=9HFsFYt5B1YHkbPNhc8W_YXT6YggwDi-f1LJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

I am trying to compile the paraView server to use inside a cluster
withou rendering hardware.
I have configured the CMakeLists to use the following options:

PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI = OFF
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA = ON
VTK_USE_DISPLAY = OFF
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN = ON
VTK_USE_QT = OFF
VTK_USE_X = OFF

Nevertheless, when I run "make pvserver" I get an error compiling vtkXdmf:
X11/StringDefs.h: file not found when trying to compile
vtkXdmfRenderWindowIteractor
and also other files/declarations are missing: Widget, XtPointer,
XEvent, XtIntervalId, XtappContext, and more...

I think that these objects are trying to compile against the X
libraries, but according to my CMakeLists, they shouldn't.
I guess I missed flag or need to install some extra libraries, but I
cannot realize which one.
Do you know where the error comes from?

Thak you,


                                                Jorge Pe?a

I think I had to set OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to an empty string, that is :

   "OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH="

You must have picked startup type as "Command" when you configured the
server in the GUI. Delete that server and add a new one, picking
"Startup Type:" as Manual.

The cmale generation is ok. But When I try to compile the projet in visual 
studio 2005, I obtain the error LNK2019:    error lnk2019 unresolved external 
symbol "public: int __thiscall vtkTestReader::CanReadFile(char const *)" 
(?CanReadFile at vtkTestReader@@QAEHPBD at Z) eferenced in function "int __cdecl 
vtkTestReaderCommand(class vtkClientServerInterpreter *,class vtkObjectBase 
*,char const *,class vtkClientServerStream const &,class vtkClientServerStream 
&)" 
(?vtkTestReaderCommand@@YAHPAVvtkClientServerInterpreter@@PAVvtkObjectBase@@PBDABVvtkClientServerStream@@AAV3@@Z)   
 vtkTestReaderClientServer.obj

 I have modified some stuffs but always the same problem.
So, I have installed plugin wizard. http://pluginwizard.mirarco.org/

I generate a reader with the wizard and when I generate the project using cmake 
everything is OK.
But, When I am in visual studio I have the same error !!

Someone has an idea for this kind of problem ?

In attachment the source generated from the wizard.

Thank you.

I think this is a bug in ParaView/Utilities/Xdmf2/vtk/CMakeLists.txt

This cmakelists compiles vtkXdmfRenderWindowInteractor which uses X11 if
USE_RENDER_WINDOW_INTERACTOR is true.  The logic does not respect the
VTK_USE_X flag.

You've declared a int CanReadFile(const char*) in your header but no
implementation has been provided in the cxx file. There's a
Canreadfile() implemented, but that's another method since C++ is case
sensitive.

I wanted to post some details about changes I am making/have made to the way time is handled inside VTK/paraview and was planning on adding a page to the 'recent updates' section http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Main_Page#Recent_Updates

But whilst checking my links, I am wondering

Wiki 1 - the one which most development info seems to go on - but I'm not certain if everyone uses this
ParaQ Wiki = http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Main_Page

Wiki 2 - the one that everyone uses and knows about (users use this)
ParaView wiki = http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView

Wiki 3 - the paraview 3 wiki : Is this one obsolete? (who uses this?)
ParaView 3 wiki = http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III


Is 1) the place for me to upload information on my proposed changes. 
Is 3) obsolete and can I delete my bookmark so that I don't get confused any more.

Thanks

JB

Hi,

In fact the hand made creation had a mistake.
But the zip  file I have attached has been created from the plugin wizard. I 
haven't  add any method. This is what plugin wizard  has created.
I have seen  that after and I have modified it.  But because it is an automatic  
generation for plugin I tought plugin wizard is ok.

But now I  have a dll I have an other problem. I can see the plugin in the  
plugin  manager from paraview (3.9.0) and it is indicated that it is loaded.
But, when I do file->open, my test file extension doesn't appear in the list. 
What is the problem ?

Thank you.

Hi,
I use the "information" element in my xdmf file to store some information.

but the xdmf version of paraview (git depot) can not read information 
elements.

I add the capabilities of reading information elements. But where and 
how do a push the new code.

Thanks

I also found this thread where they give more details:

Now I can compile and run with the off-screen-rendering flag working properly.

Hi all,

sorry to be repeating the question, but I haven't been able to figure this
out, and it is the last remaining piece I need to complete my
animations...The question is: can one use something like

V.vtkCamera.Zoom(float)

or equivalent in perspective projection? I.e., I would like to zoom in a
straightforward fashion using Python scripts, and this seems to be possible
only using parallel projection and CameraParallelScale. Regards,

Milos

Or what might be better is if you can create a bug report in
http://paraview.org/Bug/ <http://paraview.org/Bug/my_view_page.php> and
attach your patch + any additional information so we can look into this
issue.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Reading NIfTI files
Message-ID: <AANLkTinxvxkx3STAhZN61+-_TsXsifxwen0SQj7sP4tZ@mail.gmail.com>

The data sets here:
http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/data

are in?nifti1 format.

According to this:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Data_formats#The_full_list_of_file_formats
, paraview can read them. However, their extension (.img) is not in
the "Supported file types" list, and I don't see NIH/Analyze/Nifti as
an option in the "Open Data With..." dialog box.

Any thoughts on how to view these data sets?

Thanks,

David

There are nifti/analyze reader/writer plugins. You have to load it first and
then the type will show up in supported file types.

That format is readable through the AnalyzeNiftiReaderWriter plugin.

Hi,

In fact the hand made creation had a mistake.
But the zip  file I have attached has been created from the plugin wizard. I 
haven't  add any method. This is what plugin wizard  has created.
I have seen  that after and I have modified it.  But because it is an automatic  
generation for plugin I tought plugin wizard is ok.

But now I  have a dll I have an other problem. I can see the plugin in the  
plugin  manager from paraview (3.9.0) and it is indicated that it is loaded.
But, when I do file->open, my test file extension doesn't appear in the list. 
What is the problem ?

Thank you.

You've declared a int CanReadFile(const char*) in your header but  no
implementation has been provided in the cxx file. There's a
Canreadfile() implemented, but that's another method since C++ is case
sensitive.

Your synopsis is correct.  When you want to add a page about proposed changes to the developer's Wiki, we usually add it to the list under "Recent Updates" on the main page.  It makes it easier to find.

But whilst checking my links, I am wondering

Wiki 1 - the one which most development info seems to go on - but I'm not certain if everyone uses this
ParaQ Wiki = http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Main_Page

Wiki 2 - the one that everyone uses and knows about (users use this)
ParaView wiki = http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView

Wiki 3 - the paraview 3 wiki : Is this one obsolete? (who uses this?)
ParaView 3 wiki = http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III


Is 1) the place for me to upload information on my proposed changes.
Is 3) obsolete and can I delete my bookmark so that I don't get confused any more.

Thanks

Just one follow up:

In both the Tensor6 and Tensor formats, what is the order of
components (assuming we have a cartesian coordinate system)>

Tensor 6  I suspect that is is: xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz

Thanks again.

Subject: [Paraview] add buttons with custom filter and assign key binding
Message-ID: <4CA22EAB.1000203@gmx.de>

Hi,

I have some questions to the gui handling :-)

Is there an option to add custom filters as buttons in the menu bar?
And is it possible to place custom filter into the 'common' subdirectory?
Are there plans for the future to allow some keybinding settings for the 
user?

Best!
Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 3.8.1 Available for download
Message-ID: <AANLkTikRXnOtA+fG2CiVe6Y=-W2zP5oagOZj7C5w56wR@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

The ParaView team is pleased to announce the availability of the ParaView
3.8.1 binaries for download on the ParaView download page.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Release Notes:

ParaView 3.8.1 is a patch release over 3.8.0 with a a small set of
improvements. Some of noteworthy improvements/fixes are:

ParaView now comes HDF5 1.8.5. This enables developers to create
readers/plugins for ParaView that use newer versions of HDF5 easily. Also we
are now including the C++ and the high level (hl) versions of the libraryfor
those who wish to use their newer API.

Along the same note the version of NetCDF included in VTK has also been
upgraded to version 4.1.1 allowing users to take advantage of the latest
enhancements to NetCDF. Additionally the  C++ version of the library is now
also available.

Among the improvements are two new file formats. The first is a netcdf based
reader for MPAS format ocean and atmosphere data sets. The second, available
in source form only is a reader plugin that allows ParaView to read
multi-resolution wavelet compressed VAPOR data format files. Thanks to John
Clyne and Dan Legreca for contributing the VAPOR plugin.

We have improved the support for animation scripting through Python. The new
API is more coherant with the rest of ParaView Python API avoid the need for
script writers to know the minute details of how to create animations using
proxies. Tracing capabilies for animation were also revised.

GPU volume ray cast mapper for voxel datasets now works in tile display mode
as well.

In keeping with our on going improvements of the ParaView's charting
capabilities, we have included a few more fixes regarding labels and axes
placements.

We also cleaned up ParaView build and install rules so that developers don't
have to worry about 'rpath' anymore. Also "make install" has been vastly
improved on all platforms.

This release also includes a material interface extraction filter thattakes
a cell data volume fraction and generates a polydata surface. It also
performs connectivity on the particles and generates a particle index as
part of the cell data of the output. It computes the volume of each particle
from the volume fraction. The filter is accessible from the Material
Analysis category in the Filters menu.

Also, CoProcessing/in-situ processing has been added to ParaView.  It
includes 2 parts: a client side plugin that creates python scripts and a
server side library that can be called from a simulation code to output both
images and data sets based on the created python script. For more details go
to http://paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing.

Updated development installers will also follow shortly.

As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better. Please use

on paraview.org to leave your feedback and vote for new features.

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting Data from plot over line
Message-ID: <AANLkTingz9B1k4V1uXS3JfhGzQ3Z=ySQAoHTQ3Z6LqVF@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Group members,

I'm using Paraview to visualize my FE simulation results.
I was wondering how I can export the data from the plot over line filter?
I tried the suggestion in
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2007-June/005200.html
that was not successful.

I would appreciate your help.

Hey Alireza,

If you highlight the PlotOverLine filter in the pipeline, you can just go to File->Save Data and you will be given the choice of many file formats, including CSV, legacy VTK, etc. The output of the filter is a Polygonal Mesh, but with things like the CSV file you could easily load the data into other programs.

If you need to so it from a batch Python script instead of the GUI, then let us know -- I think that should be do-able, too.

Subject: [Paraview] plotting integrated values of cutting plane at various
	offsets
Message-ID: <AANLkTikVzZDhVvvzsM=uVkMr8L=hcAFwaYsz5yy-LePw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have created a contour and integrated the output to produce a single
value.  Is there a way to plot this value as the contour changes?  I have
created an animation for the isosurface but cannot see a filter that I could
use to plot these values across the range.

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Message-ID: <46CD272DA4EC4B46800957F37D8940A50AB3B2@EXCHANGE2.ad.acadiau.ca>

Hi,

It seems straightforward but I've not been successful: I would like to zoom in and then set the view direction to Y+ without reverting to default zoom.  Zooming in and then applying the 'Set view direction to Y+' icon in the toolbar zooms out the images to the default zoom (and sets the view direction to Y+).  Adjusting the camera elevation to 90 degrees in the 'Adjust Camera' window gives an error message.

How do I rotate an image by set amount without re-zooming?

thanks

for different contours with a programmable filter but I can't see how to use
the "Integrate Variables" filter.  In filters.xml it show as being called
vtkIntegrateAttributes but I cannot create this in python.  Also, there is
no webpage for this class on the nightly documentation site.

Any help is appreciated,

Subject: [Paraview] Drawing 2D data
Message-ID: <162362.13640.qm@web29718.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I would to like to have your advice concerning the display of 2D data. I have 
some structure containing x, y positions, connectivity in order to create 
triangles, quads, lines, ...  and attributes (acceleration, speed,...) 

that are associated to nodes.
For the moment I can display geometry in 3D (with 0 for the Z value). But, I 
would like to display these data in paraview in 2D. As if it were a 2D plot.
Morevover, I would like to switch from point rendering, to meshes and attributes 
(isovalues for acceleration for example, or streamlines....)

Is-it possible ? What structure should I use? I have seen vtkActor2D but I don't 
know for the moment how to use it in a reader plugin and if it is ok for my 
need.

Thank you.

Hey Paul,

I don't have an answer to your problem, but just wanted to point out that vtkIntegrateAttributes is not part of VTK proper, but is listed on the ParaView docs pages:

even wrapped for python?

Could you be a bit more clear about what you're trying to do? It sounds like you're trying to take your contours and integrate some attributes over each of the contours separately so you get a table which contains as many rows as the number of contours (and maybe separate columns for each attribute)?

As I was playing around I had trouble creating a programmable filter which has a polygonal mesh as input, but a vtkTable as output... Does anyone know if this is possible? Or, does vtkDataObjectToTable filter exist for ParaView so the data could be run through that before the programmable filter?

If I'm understanding what you're trying to do, it seems like it should be possible to implement with a programmable filter if this piece can be accomplished, even without the Integrate Attributes filter.

Hi Eric,

You are right - I would like one row of integrated values per contour.  I
don't understand how I can do this without "Integrate Attributes" though.

Regards,
Paul

I've found out how to access the "Integrate Attributes"  - I can import it
from vtkPVFiltersPython :)

That's great.

This is very rough, but I was thinking of something like this after setting the programmable filter Output Data Set Type to vtkTable (to test I've created a Wavelet Source and run it through a Gradient filter, and then a Calculator which creates a new value called RTGradMag, which is the magnitude of the gradient vector, then the data is Contoured by RTData value with Compute Scalars checked ON):

rt = inputs[0].PointData['RTData']
rtg = inputs[0].PointData['RTGradMag']
rt_set = sorted(set(rt.reshape((-1,)).tolist()))

sums = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
sums.SetName('SummedValues')
sums.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
conts = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
conts.SetName('ContourValues')
conts.SetNumberOfComponents(1)

for val in rt_set:
	summed_val = sum(rtg[rt==val].reshape((-1,)).tolist())
	conts.InsertNextValue(val)
	sums.InsertNextValue(summed_val)
	print val, summed_val

pdo = self.GetTableOutput()
pdo.AddColumn(conts)
pdo.AddColumn(sums)

Was having trouble doing the sum using numpy instead of the python built-in sum(), but I figured it out. It's just slightly cleaner this way, but I don't know which is faster.

Of course, I still don't know if this does what you are looking for, but I thought I'd pass it along anyway... :)  (I had also been using "nice" values for my contours, so this version changes the original test for rt==val to be more robust to roundoff errors.)

rt = inputs[0].PointData['RTData']
rtg = inputs[0].PointData['RTGradMag']
rt_set = sorted(set(rt.reshape((-1,)).tolist()))

sums = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
sums.SetName('SummedValues')
sums.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
conts = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
conts.SetName('ContourValues')
conts.SetNumberOfComponents(1)

for val in rt_set:
	summed_val = numpy.sum(rtg[numpy.abs(rt-val)<0.0001], axis=1)
	conts.InsertNextValue(val)
	sums.InsertNextValue(summed_val[0])
	print val, summed_val[0]

pdo = self.GetTableOutput()
pdo.AddColumn(conts)
pdo.AddColumn(sums)

Thanks Eric - unfortunately your calculation won't take into account the
area (my data is coming from an unstructured grid).  I've put in my solution
with integrate attributes.  It's a bit slow calculating the contour each
time though....

8<--------------------------------------------------
from vtkPVFiltersPython import vtkIntegrateAttributes

scalar_name = "span"
scalar_min = 0.01
scalar_max = 0.99
scalar_steps = 10

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()

aa = vtk.vtkAssignAttribute()
aa.SetInputConnection(input.GetProducerPort())
aa.Assign(scalar_name, "SCALARS", "POINT_DATA")
aa.Update()

appender = vtk.vtkAppendFilter()

scalar_curr = scalar_min
scalar_step = (scalar_max - scalar_min) / (scalar_steps - 1.0)
for i in range(0, scalar_steps):

    contour = vtk.vtkContourFilter()
    contour.SetInput(aa.GetOutput())
    contour.SetValue(0, scalar_curr)
    contour.Update()

    iv = vtkIntegrateAttributes()
    iv.SetInput(contour.GetOutput())
    iv.Update()

    appender.AddInput(iv.GetOutput())
    scalar_curr += scalar_step

appender.Update()
output.ShallowCopy(appender.GetOutput())

Yeah, I wondered if you were needing the area. 

If you want to compare the speed you could also try using a Python script (assigned to a macro button) which sets up this pipeline in the GUI for you automatically based on your desired contour values, branching out your pipeline into a bunch of Contour plus Integrate Variables filters, and then all of the outputs appended in the end...

There should also be a way to do the Contouring before the programmable filter, and then set up, pretty much like you did, a series of Threshold plus IntegrateAttributes filters and then pull all the results into a table at the end.

Anyway, glad you figured it out.

This would build up a list (in a polydata or vtkTable for example) which could then be plotted on a graph. A reset button on a custom panel can be used to clear the values. I?ve done this a couple of times for time related filters when I wanted to plot something unusual over T.

I have try to inherit the reader plugin from vtkPolyDataMapper2D but the result 
is not ok. I don't not yet what vtkObject I should set as an output from the 
reader.

For the moment I have always the data that is in 3D in Paraview.
What is the good way to do what I would to do ?

Thanks

Objet : [Paraview] Drawing 2D data


Hi,

I would to like to have your advice concerning the display of 2D data. I have 
some structure containing x, y positions, connectivity in order to create 
triangles, quads, lines, ...  and attributes (acceleration, speed,...) 

that are associated to nodes.
For the moment I can display geometry in 3D (with 0 for the Z value). But, I 
would like to display these data in paraview in 2D. As if it were a 2D plot.
Morevover, I would like to switch from point rendering, to meshes and attributes 
(isovalues for acceleration for example, or streamlines....)

Is-it possible ? What structure should I use? I have seen vtkActor2D but I don't 
know for the moment how to use it in a reader plugin and if it is ok for my 
need.

Thank you.

Greetings,

Trying to convert an ascii vtu file to binary form.

how does one convert the following to binary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<DataArray type="Int32" Name="offsets" format="ascii">
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64
        </DataArray>
<DataArray type="UInt8" Name="types" format="ascii">
11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11
        </DataArray>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Best regards,
Eric

  You have to be careful of the terminology because in the world of VTK 
XML files "binary" really means base 64 encoded, and "appended not 
encoded" means binary. I have used the following two lines in a code in 
order to coax the VTK XML writer to write binary:

   w->SetDataModeToAppended();
   w->SetEncodeAppendedData(0);

ParaView has these options in the file->save data menu of you choose the 
XML format.
