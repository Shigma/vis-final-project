I also would be very interested in putting a time annotation on time 
series animations.  I am using PV XML format data files. Serial for now, 
but I hope to soon be writing parallel PV XML format data files also, if 
this matters.

On a more general note why does the data reader make such a big 
difference on issues like this? My understanding was that all readers 
supported the same functionality. A misunderstanding?


   Thanks

Dan

Dan,
 
Berk can probably explain this better than me.
 
The readers have a similar functionality, but some are transient and
some are a single time step.
 
I think the reader is going to have to be involved because it will have
access to the time information within the simulation data.
 
I am glad someone else is interested in this feature.
 
Thanks,
 
Brian Dotson

Not all readers provide the information paraview needs for time
annotation. The reader has to provide a
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS() in the output
information during RequestInformation pipeline pass for the time
annotation to work.  Look at  VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusReader.cxx to see
what the reader has to do.  This information array has to provide the
time value for all steps. If paraview encounters this key, it will
automatically put up the time annotation in the lower right corner.
The annotation can then be edited from 3D view properties ->
annotation.

Thanks Berk,
   I am writing unstructured XML vtk files with 
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter. So the question I have is does the
vtkXMLUnstructuredDataReader support the time steps information?
If so can you point me to the vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter function used 
to put the time step information in the data file. Or is this done at 
the cell level?

  Thanks again,

Dan

Berk forgot to mention that you need a piece of XML to help out on the
server side. Otherwise you don't see anything.

please add the following 5 lines to your reader's specs (XML code) on
the server.

     <DoubleVectorProperty
        name="TimestepValues"
        information_only="1">
        <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
     </DoubleVectorProperty>

Are you sure you are getting the right CMake? Do you have another
CMake installed anywhere else?

Subject: [Paraview] Particles, 3d shapes and a speed issue
Message-ID: <44329E1E.5000107@gmail.com>

Hi all,

When displaying a rectilinear grid of particles, I end up seeing just 
square blobs for each particle, and am unable to get proper spheres with 
shading and lighting. I do choose the relevant options from the menu on 
the left, including Goraud shading. But to no avail.

Is there a specific option which needs to be set for this, or do I have 
something wrong with my rendering options/graphics drivers (maybe 
paraview's using software rendering instead of hardware)?

In fact, this is another problem I've been facing - paraview runs on a 
pretty powerful cluster, and I see results through SSH with X 
forwarding. Since this is a local network, the lag shouldn't be too much 
- yet, when rotating complex particle systems, I get very sluggish 
performance. I attributed to this being a drivers issue - but might 
there be other things which I'm not taking into account here?

Thanks,
Viksit

Ended up doing the following:

cmake .. \
         -DTCL_LIBRARY:PATH=tcl \
         -DTK_LIBRARY:PATH=tk \

Add applying the following patch:

Which allowed me to build with the system tcl/tk libraries.  This also 
fixed my TCL_LIBRARY/init.tcl issue.

Haven't done much testing yet though beyond bringing up the main interface.

Subject: [Paraview] threshold filter problem
Message-ID: <4432C087.4070104@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi,
I have a tetmesh with a scalar field at the cell centers. I want to
extract tets with a scalar value within a certain range. It only works
after cellData2nodeData, which, however, changes the values due to
interpolation (actually, destroys them for me). 1) is there a particular
reason threshold filter is not available for cell centered data? 2) how
to walk around this problem?
Thanks for any hints

Hi Dominik,

It should not be necessary to first pass your data through 
CellDataToPointData.  In the GUI for the threshold filter, there is a 
menu button labeled "Attribute Mode".  Select "Cell Data" from this 
menu, and then your cell-centered scalars should be visible in the 
"Scalars" menu just below the "Attribute Mode" one.

>From the ssh man page:

-C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The
compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the ``level'' can
be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for protocol version 1.
Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but
will only slow down things on fast networks.  The default value can be
set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration files; see the
Compression option.

... I'd recommend you experiment with different compression settings to
see if they have an impact on your results.  Note that you might already
be using compression, and benefit from turning it off.

You need to apply the glyph filter.

Hi Amy,
The thing is that the threshold filter is not at all available from menu
unless I pass the data through cell2point filter...

It seems that Ensight readers don't have this pipeline implemented. Am I
correct? Is it possible to have this annotation time from data read in
Ensight files?

>>> "Berk Geveci" <berk.geveci@gmail.com> 4/3/2006 12:20 PM >>>

Not all readers provide the information paraview needs for time
annotation. The reader has to provide a
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS() in the output
information during RequestInformation pipeline pass for the time
annotation to work.  Look at  VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusReader.cxx to see
what the reader has to do.  This information array has to provide the
time value for all steps. If paraview encounters this key, it will
automatically put up the time annotation in the lower right corner.
The annotation can then be edited from 3D view properties ->
annotation.

I also tried the scalars as SCALARS, also with no luck: the threshold
filter is not available in menu.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 2.4 compile error
Message-ID: <1144243608.6486.113.camel@icarus.flyg.kth.se>

Hello,


I am trying to compile Paraview on a new Opteron workstation, but it's
not working. 
I have tried to compile every 2.4.x version I could get hold of (2.4.1-3
and 2.4-CVS branch) and after ccmake (without changing anything from the
default values apart the target directory) the make command always gives
me:

/usr/local/src/tmp/build# make
gmake: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
make[2]: *** [maketcltk] Error 1
make[1]: *** [Utilities/TclTk/CMakeFiles/maketcltk.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
/usr/local/src/tmp/build#

... not very useful ... but still this seems to be early on in the make
process ... TCLTK! So I tried to execute by hand the scripts in
the .../Utilities/TclTk directory:

/usr/local/src/tmp/build/Utilities/TclTk#./configure_tcltk.sh
[...]
checking if 64bit support is requested... no
checking if 64bit Sparc VIS support is requested... no
checking system version (for dynamic
loading)... /usr/local/src/tmp/ParaView/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/configure: line 13936: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
/usr/local/src/tmp/ParaView/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/configure:
line 13936: `      OSF*)'
/usr/local/src/tmp/build/Utilities/TclTk#


I have compiled Paraview using several compilers on several machines ...
but I've never seen this error before (although it's the first 64-bit
machine I'm compiling Paraview on :-) AND using the latest development
branch (I think it's 2.5.0) I don't get this error!


Is this some kind of system-level misconfiguration or is it a Paraview
bug?



Regards, Simone

It's a bug in autoconf.

Fix is:

sed -i "s/relid'/relid/" 
/usr/local/src/tmp/ParaView/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/configure

Thanks for the hint ... I thought there was something fishy in the
configure script ... but I could find it.

Although I had to replace all relid' with relid in the configure
scripts:

Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/configure              

Utilities/TclTk/tk8.4.5/unix/configure

of the source directory ... not the build directory.

That was fixed in vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx revision 1.65, but didn't
make it into ParaView 2.4.

Is there a similar method that would allow a character string to be 
displayed?  I have a reader where displaying a date and time would be 
useful.

It's possible but it would require a little bit of work. It is not on
our roadmap as far as I know.

Where would the date/time come from? Can the reader produce this for
each time step?

The data file contains the date/time of each time step.  Currently, my 
reader just ignores it.

So how to get a vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx revision 1.65? 
 
And did you mean replacing the "vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx" in 
ParaView2.4. with a "" revision 1.65 will be helpful?
 
Otherwise, I have compiled ParaView2.0.1 with "VTK_USE_MANGED_
MESA " set to "ON" successfully. But when I run "pvbatch" in 
Offscreen mode ,a renderwindow still came out, why?? Dose that
 mean ParaView2.0.1 can not do rendering offscreen?
 
PS:I do all the jobs on RedHat9.

I have some data which also displays time as a string, if your reader 
put the time values (as numbers) into the TimeStepValues array during 
the UpdateInformation phase, then the Paraview Gui can convert timestep 
T into numerical value "X", in a Qt GUI, I use this

std::string QDateTimeToString(const QDateTime &dt, bool pad=true) 

{
   std::string d1 = dt.date().toString(Qt::ISODate).toAscii().data();
   std::string t1 = dt.time().toString(Qt::ISODate).toAscii().data();
   if (pad) return std::string("'") + d1 + std::string(" ") + t1 + 
std::string("' ");
   else return d1 + std::string(" ") + t1;
}


where the numerical value X referred to above is the Qt::ISODate value 
of the time/date I want to display.

if kwsys::SystemTools had a feature to convert a string to an ISO date 
number and vice versa (similar to the Qt function I've used above), then 
adding one flag to the XML timehelper, "TimeAsDateString" (or maybe 
(TimeAsTimeString", "TimeAsDateTimeString" option), would make the job 
of displaying the time value as date/time very easy to implement inside 
paraview.

Just thinking out loud.

Hello all,

I'm also interesting to know what is the best way to automatically see 
the time step on the Paraview main window with an XML unstructured grid 
(.vtu).
If I understand your previous emails I must
- in the reader of XML unstructured grid add 
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS()
- in the readers.xml of th server add the 5 line in the XML unstructured 
grid reader bloc.

Is it correct ?
Or is there better way for this XML file ?

Best regards

Thierry Dubuis

Message-ID: <d3d4ab920604070328o14a779ddx41f8dbe36e7b1b44@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to render a simple sphere with the pvpython interpreter.
Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

a) I was expecting a sphere to be displayed ...
b) I was expecting interactivity from the renderer window ...

I have the following piece of code:

from vtkPVServerCommonPython import *
from vtkPVServerManagerPython import *

import msvcrt

pm = vtkSMObject.GetProxyManager()

ss = pm.NewProxy("sources", "SphereSource")
pm.RegisterProxy("sources", "SphereSource0", ss)

ef = pm.NewProxy("filters", "ElevationFilter")
pm.RegisterProxy("filters", "ElevationFilter0", ef)

ef.AddInput(ss, "SetInput", 0)

rm = pm.NewProxy("rendermodules", "LODRenderModule")
rm.UpdateVTKObjects()

sd = rm.CreateDisplayProxy()
sd.SetInput(ef)

rm.AddDisplay(sd)

rm.ResetCamera()
rm.InteractiveRender()

msvcrt.getch()

The resulting window is in the screen.png picture.

Thanks for any advices and/or comments,
Milan.

If you are compiling ParaView 2.4 yourself, then 
just check out the ParaView-2-4 branch from 
CVS.  The change in vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx 
for mangled mesa has been added to that branch.

That is the sphere :-) It is rendering an outline as opposed to the
surface. The display proxy has a property called Representation, that
should be set  to surface (2, I believe). Look at
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml and search for
Representation.

You can get a pointer to the interactor from the render module proxy.
You should be able to work with that interactor. By the way, I would
not call SetRepresentationCM() directly but go through the properties
instead. If you call the C++ methods directly, the state will not be
updated properly (because the associated property is never set). I
ended up writing a python module that makes it easy to set properties.
It allows me to say something like:

proxy.SetRepresentation(2)
proxy.UpdateVTKObjects()

I can send you the code if you are interested.

               Notes on ParaView readers I have used.
                      (ParaView Version 2.4.3)

I have used three ParaView Readers for time-varying data sets:
(1) EnSight Gold
(2) ExodusII
(3) ParaView's mydata.pvd
All three allow easy animation. ExodusII and ParaView's mydata.pvd allow 
parallel data sets to be easily read where all of the data sets reside 
on one workstation. Some possibly helpful notes follow:

Subject: [Paraview] Pvbatch_Offscreen Problem
Message-ID: <20060410083447.81298.qmail@mail3-94.sinamail.sina.com.cn>


Is the pvbatch mode haven't use the software renderingsupported by Mesa?The version of paraview is 2.4.3, which was compiled with"VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA" and "VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN" ON.First I saved a ".pvb" file with both "Offscreen" and "Save Image" options ON. Then I ran this ".pvb" in Linux's Text Mode, failed. The error ,out of my mind, is "bad X server connection".Is the X server necessary in offscreen mode? Why?And the error appeared in vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx Line626 while doing "PainterPolyDataMapper".Is that means Mesa has not been used in pvbatch mode?  Thanks!

Hi Berk,

I tried the "GetInteractor" method already. The resulting object is an
instance of "vtkPVGenericRenderWindowInteractor". It is a bit strange
because it is a subclass of "vtkRenderWindowInteractor" but it do not
implement the "Start" method.

I'll be happy if you could send me any code using the "pvpython"
interface. It is not easy to learn how to use this interface ...

Thanks in advance,
Milan.

Message-ID: <1144685291.422.23.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I've been experiencing a crash when I try to save an image from
Paraview.  All that's required is for me to open Paraview, select "Save
View Image" from the file menu and enter a file name. The Paraview
window vanishes and the following is printed to the terminal:

X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext
  Major opcode of failed request:  144 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  5 (X_GLXMakeCurrent)
  Serial number of failed request:  31500
  Current serial number in output stream:  31500

I'm using paraview from today's CVS. This computer is running Fedora
Core 5. 

'uname -a' says

Subject: [Paraview] Particle attributes in vtkPolyData
Message-ID: <443A857A.8010608@mcs.anl.gov>


I've written a reader for ParaView 2.4.2 that reads particles from an 
HDF5 file and loads them into a vtkPolyData object.

It stuffs vtkPoints, vtkCellArray and vtkDoubleArray objects into the 
same places, in vtkPolyData, as is done in 
<paraview_src>/VTK/IO/vtkParticleReader.cxx (although I'm not using 
vtkSmartPointer, fwiw).

The issueproblem, though, is that no scalar-attribute-based property 
shows up on the "Color by" menu on the "Display" tab, so I can't color 
the particles by the scalar attribute.

HOWEVER, if I read the particles into paraview and then use File --> 
Save Geometry to create a ".pvd" file, and then load THAT back into 
paraview, the scalar attribute shows up on the "Color by" menu, and the 
particles CAN be colored by it. 

It was, therefore, there all along -- and, it would seem, in the right 
place.


Does it looks as though I'm doing things correctly?


Here's most of the relevant code:

    scalar_var = new double[NumberOfParticles];
    for(i=0; i<NumberOfParticles; i++)
        scalar_var[i] = particles[i].realProps[varname_index];

    aVTKPolyData = vtkPolyData::New();
    variable_color1 = vtkDoubleArray::New();
    pts1 = vtkPoints::New();
    ca1 = vtkCellArray::New();

    variable_color1->SetName(varname);
    for(i=0; i<NumberOfParticles; i++) {
        variable_color1->InsertNextValue(scalar_var[i]);

    for(i=0; i<NumberOfParticles; i++) {
        pts1->InsertPoint(i, xyz_position[i].x, xyz_position[i].y,
    xyz_position[i].z);
        ca1->InsertNextCell(1);
        ca1->InsertCellPoint(i);
    }

    aVTKPolyData->SetPoints(pts1);
    aVTKPolyData->SetVerts(ca1);
    aVTKPolyData->GetPointData()->SetScalars(variable_color1);

Try editing Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMRenderModuleProxy.cxx and
commenting out this line (around line 1112)
  this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(1);
and this line:
  this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(0);
around line 1129.
I have seen this problem before. I think it is due to an OpenGL
driver/implementation bug.

Hmmm. I missed that line. Do the scalars show up in any filter? Array
calculator or threshold?

That seems to have done the trick.  I've had issues with off screen
rendering for a long time. I've chalked them up to me just
mis-configuring the build.  FC5 uses the new x.org modular X if that
helps.

I'm pretty sure that the "Cell Data to Point Data" filter was available 
before I started partitioning the particles according to index and 
distributing them among processes, but it's not available now.  So, I 
can't use threshold either.

I tried "Clip", but the scalars don't show up there.  Glyphs have point 
and cell normals, but that's all.

Subject: [Paraview] color map and point clicking
Message-ID: <005001c65ccb$4c0c2a60$f00cb784@mghfnd508>

Hi, there,
 
As a new user of ParaView, I have encountered a couple of questions. 
 
1. ParaView is capable of loading 2 image volumes. But they seem to share
the same color map, which makes the fusion of the images difficult for
visualization. Is there anyway to get around this?
 
2. For my application, I'd like to have the point clicking capability,
ideally, on an oblique plane (cut plane?) or 3 orthogonal projection planes.
Is this available in ParaView. I've tried to use Pick or Probe but I'm
having a hard time to put the cursor exactly on the oblique plane I'm
viewing. It would be nice to let me click on the plane and have a point
marked there.
 
I'd appreciate any comments and suggestions.
 
Thanks.
Ziji

Any errors? Can you post the header part of the vtk file (xml)?

I don't know why it has entries for more than 1 time step, since the 
righthand side of the timesteps window (which I opened just to check) 
only listed the single input file.  I was running a 4-process parallel 
paraview, not 10-process, btw.

Here's the XML header of one of the .vtp files to which the .pvd file 
points.  I have no idea where the name, "Scalars_", that was assigned to 
the scalars, comes from:


<?xml

Message-ID: <a2ab21560604101200r39b572c5v60952da762628adf@mail.gmail.com>

The fact that it assigned Scalars_ makes me thing that the array is
not getting a name. Can you verify in your code that SetName() is not
null or empty?

almost ad infinitum.

Cf. the garbage at the end of the second line.

So, the name must not be being set.

"varname" is a char*, which, as you can see from the first line of 
output, contains a valid char string.

This should work, right?

It is supposed to. It works everywhere else. Is varname deleted before
it is being used by any chance? This would explain the weird
behaviour. I suggest running this in valgrind (if you are using
Linux).

No.  The GetName() call comes right after the SetName() call (modulo the 
cout).

pvpython was not designed to be run interactively so it does not
support 3d interaction well. That part is taken care of by the GUI
code. To get this working you have to run your own event loop (for
example, using tkinter or pyqt) and pass the event to the server
manager. For example, from vtkPVWindow.cxx:

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkPVWindow::MouseAction(int action,int button,
                              int x,int y, int shift,int control)
{
  if ( !this->MainView->GetEnabled() || !this->Interactor )
    {
    return;
    }
  if ( action == 0 )
    {
    if (button == 1)
      {
      this->Interactor->OnLeftPress(x, y, control, shift);
      }
    else if (button == 2)
      {
      this->Interactor->OnMiddlePress(x, y, control, shift);
      }
    else if (button == 3)
      {
      this->Interactor->OnRightPress(x, y, control, shift);
      }
    }
  else if ( action == 1 )
    {
    if (button == 1)
      {
      this->Interactor->OnLeftRelease(x, y, control, shift);
      }
    else if (button == 2)
      {
      this->Interactor->OnMiddleRelease(x, y, control, shift);
      }
    else if (button == 3)
      {
      this->Interactor->OnRightRelease(x, y, control, shift);
      }
    vtkCamera* cam = this->MainView->GetRenderer()->GetActiveCamera();
    //float* parallelScale = cam->GetParallelScale();
    double* position      = cam->GetPosition();
    double* focalPoint    = cam->GetFocalPoint();
    double* viewUp        = cam->GetViewUp();

    this->GetTraceHelper()->AddEntry(
      "$kw(%s) SetCameraState "
      "%.3lf %.3lf %.3lf  %.3lf %.3lf %.3lf  %.3lf %.3lf %.3lf",
      this->MainView->GetTclName(),
      position[0], position[1], position[2],
      focalPoint[0], focalPoint[1], focalPoint[2],
      viewUp[0], viewUp[1], viewUp[2]);
    }
  else
    {
    this->Interactor->OnMove(x, y);
    }
}

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkPVWindow::KeyAction(char keyCode, int x, int y)
{
  if ( !this->MainView->GetEnabled()  )
    {
    return;
    }
  this->Interactor->OnKeyPress(keyCode, x, y);
}

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkPVWindow::Configure(int vtkNotUsed(width), int vtkNotUsed(height))
{
  if (!this->MainView)
    {
    return;
    }
  this->MainView->Configured();
  // The above Configured call could have changed the size of the render
  // window, so get the size from there instead of using the input width and
  // height.
  int *size = this->MainView->GetRenderWindowSize();
  if (this->Interactor)
    {
    this->Interactor->UpdateSize(size[0], size[1]);
    this->Interactor->ConfigureEvent();
    }
}

Also, you have to give the interactor an instance of
vtkPVRenderViewProxy. This requires subclassing (vtkPVRenderViewProxy
is abstract) and implement the pure virtual methods.

I am sorry for the lack of documentation. The paraview guide has a
section on the server manager that is useful to get started. Beyond
that, you have to read the code and it's documentation from doxygen.
We will write a more comprehensive guide in the future.

Subject: [Paraview] Choosing a Folder instead of a File to Open - OpenFoam
Message-ID: <BAY103-F16F8B23C20D99D5579FDF0DECD0@phx.gbl>

I am looking into writing a reader for OpenFOAM.  One hurdle with the 
openfoam format is that the data is a hierarchy of different files and 
folders but no one file that you would open.  So I would need to be able to 
specify a folder as the data I want to open not a file.  So my quesion is: 
is there a way to specify a folder instead of a file in "Open Data"?

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <56FC3A8A-832F-4C7F-B571-78B5E2F8EFAE@student.dtu.dk>

Hi,

I'm a complete newbie, so please don't be too hard on me if I ask  
something stupid or if the information is clearly available somewhere  
I didn't look... I downloaded the "VTK file formats" pdf-file, but  
that's a lot of information for a newbie... So:

I've made a program in C that computes a couple of temperatures and  
saves the result in a 2D-array as a function of timestep... (well,  
the 2D array is overwritten each timestep, but I want to save them in  
a file as a function of the timestep). And then I want to be able to  
choose which time-step to look at in paraview...

I've made this .vtk-file manually just to get a feeling of how it  
works (here I'm only looking at 2 temperatures):

like to be able to write "4 0 1 4 3      # front" and "0.0 0.0  
0.1      # point 6", just as a reminder to myself... Is it possible?

2) How to insert additional time-steps??? For instance, the  
temperatures at the next time-step could look like:

LOOKUP_TABLE default
675.4
491.1
35.2
23.0
20.2
20.0
20.0

And for future time-steps I would get other temperatures etc...

3) I have a lot of problems figuring out how to program a more  
complex method of storing the temperatures for each cell and  
calculating the points and figuring out how to connect these  
points... Is there any hints on doing this or perhaps somebody  
already programmed something in C?

Thanks in advance for any help...

thats a lot of questions, I suggest to go one by one next time.
- google for example files
- study techdocs file formats pdf
- browse the archives (for code samples)
- buy the boox
- try out, read the code
- i dont think multiple time steps are possible in vtk format. keep time
data in files file.001 etc and PV will load them as time series.
otherwise I hear ensight format supports that.
good luck

This would be very useful for LS-Dyna output decks as well.

Hi, thanks a lot for the comments...

There is so much information available around that it's difficult for  
me to figure out exactly where to look, if you understand..... I'll  
see if I can get my hands on the books... Untill then:

I actually got another question, because I changed the background  
color in paraview under windows xp. How to get the old background  
back? I tried to look for a configuration file but only found a file  
called #ParaViewlmk# under "C:\Documents and settings\(user)"

So what I need now is also information on the file format of these  
file.001, file.002, file.003 files... I thought that I could just  
rename the .vtk extension and change the data in the .001, .002, .003  
etc files, but that didn't work at all... The reader didn't knew what  
file format this was..

?

Regards,
Martin

David,

Why not write a CGNS reader/writer instead? OpenFoam writes CGNS files, and these are more general. I have been meaning to do this myself, but have not been able to find the time.

Just a thought.

There is a config file but I never checked it for colors. Otherwise set
it back in GUI. The time series has to have 001 etc in the finename, but
of course you need suffix too. I dont remeber by heart but it was sth
like file001.vth file002.vtk etc. Then there will be slider in the
properties to chose time step. Not too convenient though.

I determine the server host and launch pvclient on my work station where

/usr/local/paraview/bin/pvclient -dr --server-host=pf10.inria.fr

The paraview interface comes up. The problem is that the interface comes

directory where the vtk file is located.
1-How do I get the paraview interface to come up in the working directory.

Thanks, using file001.vtk, file002.vtk etc. works and that's enough  
for me to get started with...

But I don't know how to get exact the same color  back in the GUI...?

I'm also asking because in linux I once had a problem with paraview  
which wouldn't start before I deleted this configuration file (in  
Linux the file is in $HOME AFAIR?)... It came with some kind of error  
message (can't remember it)... So it would just be nice to know where  
it puts this configuration - could also be nice to see what options  
are stored... Perhaps in the registry? I hope not...


Regards,
Martin

Subject: [Paraview] Error about compiling cmake & Paraview
Message-ID: <20060413035911.25903.qmail@web50106.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,
   
  I have downloaded latest cmake and Paraview source code from Kitware website, and tried to install on x86_64 version of RHEL4U3. However I couldn't compile cmake successfully, it always report:
  [root@localhost]# ./bootstrap
---------------------------------------------
CMake 2.2-3, Copyright (c) 2002 Kitware, Inc., Insight Consortium
C compiler on this system is: cc
cxx is g++
---------------------------------------------
Error when bootstrapping CMake:
Cannot find appropriate C++ compiler on this system.
Please specify one using environment variable CXX.
See cmake_bootstrap.log for compilers attempted.

  Eventhough I tried to set CXX environmnet path to c++, nothing worked either.
   
  However the same source code can be compiled successfully on 32bit version of RHEL4U1. Similarly, paraview can't be compiled on x86_64 RHE4U3, but it can be compiled without any error on 32bit RHEL4U1.
   
  I noticed that c++ version is different on RHEL4U1 and RHEL4U3, is that the reason for compiling issue? Does cmake and paraview support x86_64 Redhat?
   
  One more question, I got some error on one 32bit RHELU1 node which doesn't have full OS installed.

Message-ID: <443E1C53.3040901@cscs.ch>

Hi All,

I am importing Fluent data into paraview and would like to present some 
options in the user interface to turn off the loading of entire 
volumes/regions/etc. When selecting point or cell data one can use the 
Point/CellArrayStatus array approach and appropriate xml additions to 
display the list after the update information stage. I'd like to be able 
to show the point arrays, but also the list of domains and turn on or 
off those. I see various widgets in the book that may help me, but is 
there an example anywhere that already does this?

thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting Mac binary files
Message-ID: <C063CF9A.6251%jkoski11@comcast.net>

OK, the README says 'Extract the file "paraview-2.4.3-darwin-files.tar" into
your destination directory (typically /usr/local)'. I have now successfully
installed Paraview binaries twice (2.4.2 and 2.4.3) on my Mac G5 with OS X
10.3.9, but resorted to making my own "installer" which included /usr/local
directories so I could extract into -C /.

When I try

  sudo tar -xvf paraview-2.4.3-darwin.tar -C /usr/local

I end up with a copies of paraview-2.4.3-darwin.tar and README in
/usr/local. If I construct and tar a folder with empty usr and local
directories, then the install with

  sudo tar -xvf paraview-install.tar -C /

works correctly.

What is the correct UNIX bash incantation to install Paraview directly from
the distribution binaries with a "one liner" command? Is it the README file
that's killing things? Maybe if I eliminate the README file the first
command will work? An example of the installation command (for the default
bash shell) in the README would be of assistance.

Incidentally, my 2.4.3 installation is working well. Thanks for an excellent
product.

Hello,

I'm using Paraview 2.2 version on a linux machine (I had to use this version because 2.4.2 kept crashing w hen trying to save an image or application), and I would like to animate a dataset that has 600 time steps. Everytime I try to save the animation it renders the first 9 to 10 frames and then stops rendering. Does anyone know how to fix this? This also  happens to me when using Paraview 2.4 on a windows machine.

Thank you,

I tried different things, including unselecting those two. However, I don't think is a memory issue because both computers I'm working on have 500 Gb of memory and each frame is small compared to amount of memory I have.
Any other thoughts?

Subject: [Paraview] Re:Still Problem with Offscreen
Message-ID: <20060414160916.10191.qmail@web38511.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

The compile problem has been solved ,thanks.
  But now I met another problem still about offscreen.
  The offscreen function act up well in C/S mode, but failed with pvbatch.
  The Rendering Image still was sent to a RenderWindow, the saved into a Image file.
  I analyzed the sourcecode about method "setoffscreenrendering" in class "vtkXOpenGLRenderwindow". 
  In my opinion, it is caused by a evaluation failure of two variables :"PixmapContextId" and "PbufferContextId" when running pvbatch.
  There is the sourcecode involved:  
  _________________________
  this->vtkRenderWindow::SetOffScreenRendering(i);
      if(i)
        {
        this->Internal->ScreenDoubleBuffer = this->DoubleBuffer;    
        this->DoubleBuffer = 0;
        this->Internal->ScreenMapped = this->Mapped;
        this->Mapped = 0;
        if(!this->Internal->PixmapContextId || !this->Internal->PbufferContextId)
          {
          this->WindowInitialize();
          }
        }
  _________________
  I wonder if it is a bug, or just a function that havent been done because of no use and ? How to get rid of the pop-up rendering window when running paraview in pvbatch???
   
  Thanks!

  If you are compiling ParaView 2.4 yourself, then 
just check out the ParaView-2-4 branch from

I'm quite new with paraview but I'm wondering why it does this 
strange/stupid interpolation.... I mean: Look at that (use Display Style/ 
Representation / Surface)... Interpolation: Doesn't matter if it's Gouraud 
or flat - it gives the same nonsense.

The only way I figured out how to get something that looked somewhat 
reasonable (and then again not) was to click Representation / Points on 
Surface and then make point size 24 or something really large... Then it 
doesn't interpolate...

Isn't there any better way than this to disable interpolation with the above 
file? As you can see it looks completely strange... I mean: At least it 
could have rounded off the corners in all 4 corners instead of only on the 
two corners....?!?!

Martin

Hi,

Sorry for this stupid quesiton.

paraview's release package in case I have all the corrsponding  header files ?
I have using some vtk dynamic link library to substitute my previous compiled

However,  I do not know whether it's ok or not.  Can anyone help me ?

Message-ID: <20060418032411.84464.qmail@web50103.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello, 
   
  I tried to run paraview which was compiled with mpich. I noticed that cpu usage on paraview data servers (pvserver) is always around 99% even though no data processing at all. Only the first pvdataserver's cpu usage was reasonable(where I started the mpirun command).
   
  Why did that happen? Does that mean paraview is not working properly on all paraivew data servers.
   
  I have four nodes to be used as paraview data server.
  Command I used on the first paraview data server: host1
  # mpirun -np 4 -machinefile hostsfile /opt/paraview path/pvserver
   
  Commad I used on client node: client1
  #//opt/paraview path/pvclient -sh=host1
   
  After these commands, message "client connected" was showed on host1 and paraview GUI was successfully opened on client node.
   
  Did I do something wrong?
   
  BTW, I tried to start pvdataserver, pvrenderserver and pvclient on different server,
  On client node, I run command:
  #pvclient -sh=host1 -rsh=host5 
  Only pvdataserver reported "client connected", pvrenderserver was waiting with no response. What should I do with this?
   
  Thanks.
  Eric

Hello,

Maybe, you have a memory problem.
Try this,
->view
->Keyframe animation
In the animation Settings box, don't cache geometry.
It save your animation in the cache memory instead of the hard disk.





Hello,

I'm using Paraview 2.2 version on a linux machine (I had to use this version because 2.4.2 kept crashing w hen trying to save an image or application), and I would like to animate a dataset that has 600 time steps. Everytime I try to save the animation it renders the first 9 to 10 frames and then stops rendering. Does anyone know how to fix this? This also  happens to me when using Paraview 2.4 on a windows machine.

Thank you,

I use lsf, submit file looks like, jobs is submitted on the frontend of 
mpi cluster. These are the steps that I follow:

1) bsub  -n 8  mpijob /usr/local/paraview/bin/pvserver

2) Next I determine the server host and launch pvclient on my work station

/usr/local/paraview/bin/pvclient -dr --server-host=pf10.inria.fr

3) The paraview interface comes up. The problem is when I tried to open 
the .vtk I cannot find it as the open directory is where ParaView was 
installed by root and not in my working directory where the vtk file is 
located.

Question:
How do I get the paraview interface to come up in the working directory.

If you want to use a separate dataserver and renderserver, then you 
have to add -crs (or --client-render-server) to the pvclient command line.

Is it possible to run ParaView as a compute/data server on a headless

ie. Does the cluster have to have a head node?

You can force the client to render everything by turning off the
"Composite" option under "3D View Properties".  Is that the question you
are asking?

That might be an MPI issue.  We use MVAPICH (a derivative of MPICH) and
it also seems to peg-out the processors for all but the first process. 
This happens with any MPI run, not just Paraview.  I am guessing MPI is
doing some sort of spin-wait on those processes.  

Anyway, to see if it truly is MPICH, you can try running some other MPI
program that can idle for a certain amount of time and see if those
processes behave similarly.

Actually what I want to do is build ParaView on a headless cluster and 
then connect using  the  client.
I think that it should work but was double checking for potential 
problems like the  "Composite" option.
 - thanks

If your cluster does not have an xhost, I would recommend compiling
ParaView with OSMesa support and then running the server with the off
screen rendering flag.  This way, your cluster will still behave well if
a client tries to render on the server.  This is an especially good idea
if you have a large cluster that may overwhelm the client with data.

It's probably MPICH, we have also witnessed the CPU spinning using 
MVAPICH.  We wrote some code that found nodes with open receives show 
high usage.  This makes sense that process 0 shows normal CPU usage 
while the rest of the nodes in the job have open receives while waiting 
for process 0 to tell them to do something.  I believe the behavior 
causing the high CPU usage is called polling and you can build MVAPICH 
(as well as MPICH??) with polling turned off.  I understand this will 
simply increase your latency.

On our SGI system here i've noticed the same thing.. It doesn't seem to
impact paraview's performance, but no matter what's going on all the
processes are pegged at 100% utilization.

It'd kinda funny in a way to see the utilization actually *drop* when they
start doing real work.

The code you are referring to doesn't get called if you are using mangled
mesa.  And you're trying to use mangled mesa, right?

So perhaps it didn't get set properly to use mangled mesa at run time.  Any
one
else know how to make mangled mesa work in pvbatch?

Hi,

I am working on an opensource software plateform (see 
salome-plateform.org) in which we would like to include a better 
visualisation module. We are interested by Paraview for its many features 
and strong support community, but our choice have been made for qt as GUI 
library and python for scripting.
Is there anybody trying to port the client to qt, and is there some 
documentation on the pvpython module?

Thanks for any help
Stephane

Message-ID: <3DAF9E80-EBD1-4DD3-B1B2-5F8EF038175D@esd.mun.ca>

Hi,

My problem is similar to one posted last month in the archives but I  
can't work out how they came to a solution.

After "apparently" managing to successfully compile the code, I ran  
it and was temporarily pleased to see Paraview's colourful opening  
screen only to have it crash out with the following message:

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range  
for operation)
   Major opcode of failed request:  150 (GLX)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
   Value in failed request:  0x22
   Serial number of failed request:  1122
   Current serial number in output stream:  1123

The same thing occurred when I downloaded and ran the Mac binaries.  
I've been running everything from an x-terminal and my /usr/X11R6/lib  
directory contains all the libGL and libGLU libraries so I have no  
idea what it's complaining about.

Has anyone else come across this problem?

Thanks!
KIM...

    Yep, I have the same problem. I am running OS X 10.4.6 Intel and  
OS X 10.4.6 PPC. Both crash out of X in about that same spot. I at  
least used to be able to run the binaries from Paraview.org, but not  
any more.
    Trying to build on OS X 10.4.x will not work either. It will  
successfully compile, but not work. I tried compiling with GCC 4 and  
GCC 3. I tried running PPC binaries on Intel hardware hoping that  
Rosetta would kick in.. Nothing I have tried works.
    The only know working solution is Paraview 2.2.1 running on OS X  
10.3.9. That was the last time I had anything working on Mac Hardware.

Good luck.

Hi,

on my Powerbook G4, OS X 10.4.6, the binaries from the website work, but 
the last version is very unstable. Anyone still having 2.4.2 binaries?

The recent stable code doesn't compile on my machine, the CVS code 
builds, but last time I tried it crashed shortly after startup.

Regards,
Andreas

Andreas,

I have not had any problems with paraview-2.4.3 on my G5 with OS X 10.3.9.
Currently, there are also reported build problems for PowerPC Macs with OS X
10.4.6 with the open source products octave and R. Apparently, the same
builds work without problems on the new Intel Macs with 10.4.6. I monitor
the Apple scitech list, and, while the problems are being reported, there is
no word from Apple about the existence of the problem or if it will be fixed
soon. I suspect that they are swamped supporting the new Intel platform.

Maybe we should ask for the paraview website to add the the 2.4.2 version
until the problem is cleared.

I can report that Paraview version 2.4.3 (Current Stable Version) does
NOT work on OS X 10.4.6 for Intel. I have a MacBook Pro running 10.4.6
and while Paraview will compile, it will not run. The splash screen
shows up but then crashes when OpenGL is called.

Who is reporting that Paraview _is_ working with Intel hardware? I
would like to find out how they are building it and getting it to
work.

Are you saying that paraview 2.4.2 does compile and build on OS X
10.4.6 for Intel? Then it should be a matter of looking for that tag
in CVS and doing a Check out and Build.

If you look at:
http://www.paraview.org/files/v2.4/
...all the files are still there. Feel free to download 2.4.2...

It's only on the html download page that all the latest links point to 
2.4.3 - you can still get the older ones, too.

I don't think ParaView works on OS X for Intel. I have heard multiple
reports that it does not. I also haven't tested 2.4.3 on the Mac.
Unfortunately, we have been mostly relying on paraview users to send
us patches for Mac. This will probably change in the not-so-far future
but for now, I don't have time to look into the problem. I will keep
the mailing list posted.

Mike,

No, I am reporting that octave and R work on Intel Macs with OS X 10.4.6,
but not on PowerPC Macs with the same OS. Paraview is a different story. The
octave and R problems with the PowerPC Macs are apparently related to
loading .dylibs.

I installed my Mac paraview from the Kitware download binaries, and have not
attempted a build. As I said, the download has worked well so far.

Subject: [Paraview] malloc error on Mac
Message-ID: <4447BB36.3050703@lanl.gov>

Hi,
I am running ParaView 2.4.2 on a Mac G5 with OS X 10.4.6. I am able to 
read in a large data set (scalar field on ~10 million grid points), but 
when I try to display a surface I get the following error:

paraview-real(7207,0xa000ed98) malloc: *** vm_allocate(size=173068288) 
failed (error code=3)
paraview-real(7207,0xa000ed98) malloc: *** error: can't allocate region
paraview-real(7207,0xa000ed98) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in 
szone_error to debug
Abort

The display command progresses to about 70% completion, at which point 
roughly 2.2+ Gb are being accessed. My assumption is that this is a 
limitation due to 32 bit, and I must run at 64 bit to succeed. Does this 
sound correct, and if so are there instructions for compiling ParaView 
to run 64 bit?

Thanks,
Ben

Hi,

Seems I'm not the only one having Mac-related Paraview issues! I'm  
trying to compile things on a non-Intel Powerbook G4 running 10.4.6  
though.

Based on some of the advice that I received, I compiled  
paraview-2.2.1 but I get the same problem as before with it crashing  
out with:

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range
  for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  150 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
  Value in failed request:  0x22
  Serial number of failed request:  1122
  Current serial number in output stream:  1123

Not that I know anything about these things but could it just be that  
my video card is not hefty enough?

All is not lost though as my Linux workstation is able to run the  
binaries happily so I'm not completely Paraview-less. I just can't  
lug it around with me as I could if it was on my laptop...

Thanks!
KIM...

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 2.4.3 and OS X 10.4.6 - Build Problems
Message-ID: <E3FFAED0-5ABA-4FCE-AC0D-24846AF216B7@guardian72.com>

Hi,

I've just built ParaView 2.4.3 on my G4 PowerBook running OS X  
10.4.6, using the instructions from the wiki: BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON;  
VTK_USE_CARBON_OFF; VTK_USE_X ON. I used gcc4.0 and CMake 2.2.3.

The build chugs along and finishes, but when I try to run the  
paraview executable, I get a segmentation fault. This also happens if  
I try to run pvclient and connect to pvserver. The server process  
starts up, but when paraview or pvclient display "Creating UI (main

directory and doing an install.

This seems similar to other postings I've seen, does anyone have a  
suggestion as to how I should go about debugging this?

Thanks,

KIM,
   If you are on a PPC system, the you should be able to grab the  
prebuilt binaries from Kitware's site http://www.paraview.org/files/ 
v2.2/  or http://www.paraview.org/files/v2.4/ and run. From my last  
trials trying to get it to run under OS X 10.4.x then only solution  
that I came up with was running a binary that was built with PANTHER  
( OS X 10.3.9 ) using GCC 3.3. That was the only version that I could  
get to run under OS X 10.4 PPC.
    Now that I have an Intel OS X machine I am completely out of luck  
running Paraview. From the looks of things there is an issue with how  
the OpenGL Context is being created. It is going to take one of the  
Kitware Engineers to debug it to figure out what exactly is going on.
    Unfortunately, that is not at the top of the Priority list for  
Kitware.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately even the older binaries  
(2.2.1) give me the same crash. Looks like I might be out of luck.

Thanks anyway,
KIM...

Hi,

I am working with the 2.4.3 release of paraview, and I have a strange 
behaviour : 
when loading data with only cell attributes, the Threshold filter is not 
available. 
It is available after applying the "Cell Data To Point Data" filter, and I 
can then choose some cell data to apply it (provided I checked the "Pass 
cell data" box).

Best,
Stephane

Hi Stephen,

This is a known problem, and it has been 
corrected in the ParaView-2-4 CVS branch since 
the 2.4.3 release.  It will be fixed in the next 
patch release of ParaView 
(2.4.4).  Alternatively, you can check out the 
2.4 branch of the ParaView CVS tree (the tag is 
ParaView-2-4) and build ParaView from source code 
if you need this functionality immediately.

Hi,

I was trying to get GLSL shaders into paraview, and I got an error 
compiling paraview with the VTK_USE_GLSL_SHADER flag on.
In the Output::ProcessFile, changing line 125 from 
        for ( cc = 0; cc < line.size(); cc ++ )
into 
        for ( cc = 0; cc < line.size()-1; cc ++ )
resolves it.
(the pb was that the newline caracter was copied when it should not)

Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] About Tiled Display
Message-ID: <444C995D.009DFF.11177>


Hi,all,

Our lab will buy a SGI machine with three graphic pipeline and build a display wall(1x3) for large scale visualization.
We have test the tiled display function of paraview on three PCs, and we find that there is no overlap region between
the three images on those three PCs' displays. 

But,the technical engineer of display wall told us that there needs overlap image region between the three projecting region
to smoothing the color and shape of every two neighbour displays.

Who can tell me whether this is a problem when we use paraview on our new display wall in the future?
And what should we do for it?

Thanks

Nancy

Message-ID: <444CB424.10409@sophia.inria.fr>

I use lsf, submit file looks like, jobs is submitted on the frontend of
mpi cluster. These are the steps that I follow:

1) bsub  -n 8  mpijob /usr/local/paraview/bin/pvserver

2) Next I determine the server host and launch pvclient on my work station

/usr/local/paraview/bin/pvclient -dr --server-host=pf10.inria.fr

3) The paraview interface comes up. The problem is when I tried to open
the .vtk I cannot find it as the open directory is where ParaView was
installed by root and not in my working directory where the vtk file is
located.

Question:
How do I get the paraview interface to come up in the working directory.

Try running paraview from a shell script instead of calling it directly.
The shell script could change directory before running paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] CHOMBO file converter for PARAVIEW
Message-ID: <200604241503.47791.burlen@apollo.sr.unh.edu>

Currently there are a number of options for visualizing CHOMBO data including 
CHOMBOVIS, and VISIT. I'd like to contribute yet another option, a file 
converter that allows the data to be used with PARAVIEW or any other 
application that can read VTK's file format. The converter's primary use is 
to construct a dataset spanning the entire problem domain using the highest 
resolution data available for a given spatial location, while avoiding 
visualization issues associated with multi resolution data. Also the 
converter can extract boxes from a specific level, allowing one to visualize 
CHOMBO's box layout, level by level. One nice feature of the converter is 
that it has a command line interface and can batch process CHOMBO's plot 
files, resulting in a numbered sequence of VTK files which PARAVIEW can 
animate easily. Currently the converter only handles 2 & 3D cell centered 
data, and only reads the HDF5 file format used by CHOMBOVIS. It has gone 
through a number of revisions, and may be usefull to those who prefer 
PARAVIEW for visualization. Development and preliminary testing have been 
done using Fedora 2 linux (single proc), HDF5 1.6.3, and VTK 4.4.2 I hope to 
make improvements in the future, and test the converter on more platforms.

Have you considered writing a native AMR reader for Chombo?
VTK/ParaView support AMR datasets now. I had a simple Chombo reader
working at one point but it is not production quality. The only AMR
reader in VTK is for CTH right now.  I would be happy to help.

My work is similar to John's work but is now built into VTK proper. It
is relatively recent, a little over 1 year old. It supports
rectilinear AMR grids natively and does not convert them to
unstructured grids. Support for curvilinear grids is not hard to add.
If you have a current ParaView (as of 2.4, I belive), you can see it
in action by creating a Hierarchical Fractal from the Source menu.

Also, CTH is structured and supports AMR:
(http://www.cs.sandia.gov/web9232/cth/).

Subject: [Paraview] How to create parallel PVTU files?
Message-ID: <444E165A.1050605@christoph-moder.de>

Hi!

We would like to process large datasets on a cluster. Our software 
writes only monolithic *.vtk files, and I think that makes Paraview slow 
because large amounts of data have to be transferred over the network. 
So I think it would be a good idea to divide the data files into 
subgrids and store them in the PVTU format. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) 
But how can I do that? I have read about the vtkDistributedDataFilter; 
can I load the data, apply the DistributedDataFilter, and write the 
subgrids as VTU files, connected by a PVTU file? Any hints?

Thanks,
Christoph

I have the same or sililar question. I compute on a cluster and write 
separate vtk files for each processor. Example using 4 processors.
P0.vtk
P1.vtk
P2.vtk
P3.vtk

Question: If I run the ParaView_mpi, how do I  get processor "0" to read 
P0.vtk, and processor "1" P1.vtk, and  ...?
It would seem that the pvclient should use a tile display (4 in this 
case). How does one use ParaView in this manner?

I can confirm that native support for patch-based AMR is very good in
VTK. I just presented a poster highligthing our efforts using a combined
set of ParaView, and VTK+KWWidgets apps I developped to support our
scientists. Our data storage is also based on HDF5 which makes
integration and compilation trivial in ParaView.

for the more curious folks, the poster is on-line at the conference site:

It is not pre-release anymore. It is being used for production. It is
still maturing however. There will be more improvements in the next
year or two. Including native, fast volume rendering of AMR datasets.

Yes and no :-) Almost all of the AMR support is in VTK. However,
ParaView is the only application that is using it so far.

I would say that Chombovis has some AMR support we have not reproduced
yet. The biggest being support of edge or face centered data.

Message-ID: <200604251536.16093.burlen@apollo.sr.unh.edu>

Despite the new classes included with VTK my converter may be of use in the 
short term. here is why:

In the process of developing my converter I encountered a number of instances 
where VTK's defaults applied to multiresolution data produce erroneous 
visualizations. One of the issues behind this is that often CHOMBO data is 
cell centered data while many useful VTK algorithms such as contouring 
require node centered data. While this can easily be created by using the 
CellToPointData filter, if left to VTK's defaults the contouring and color 
mapping routines produce erroneous results. In the color maps the boundaries 
between different Levels(and even between boxes depending on how the data is 
created) are clearly visible. for instance see: 
http://quaoar.sr.unh.edu/images/boxes_problem.png
In the case of the contours, VTK's algorithm generates contours that don't 
connect across Levels(and in some case boxes, again depending on how the 
dataset is created). for instance see: 
http://quaoar.sr.unh.edu/images/contours_not_closed.png

In the process of developing my converter I did a case study on these issues 
and developed solutions that solve the problems. I found that the choice of 
cell type and how the point data(required for certain visualizations) are 
created, are the main issues to address. Out of all the VTK cell types 
triangles, and tetra are the least prone to visualization errors, and that 
the best case is to use the cell centers them selves as the point set to 
triangulate/tetrahedralize. Any other choice for a set of points would 
require interpolation of the CHOMBO data and introduce error. Please see the 
slide illustrating these issues: 
http://quaoar.sr.unh.edu/chhdf52FlatVtk/amr_vis_cell_types.png

The chhdf52FlatVtk converter addresses these issues, by using VTK_TRIANGLE 
cell type in 2d and VTK_TETRA in 3d  generated from point data introduced at 
the CHOMBO cell centers. for example see: 
http://quaoar.sr.unh.edu/chhdf52FlatVtk/resolved_issues.png

So the question that comes to mind is how do the new VTK classes handle these 
issues? From a preliminary test using the Hierarchical Fractal Source 
included with PARAVIEW I'm not convinced that they do. As a result there may 
still much work to be done on these before they can be used in some specific 
visualizations, such as iso surface & contours. The following slide was 
created using the Hierarchical Fractal source included with PARAVIEW. It 
shows that VTK uses a naive choice of cell types when constructing the 
hierarchical data, which leads to contour algorithm breaking and the color 
mapping issues described above. In addition in order to generate the point 
set required for these visualizations the CellToPointData filter is used 
introducing interpolation error. 
http://quaoar.sr.unh.edu/chhdf52FlatVtk/hierarch_data_issues.png

I have not done an in depth study of the new classes, and only tested them 
using my current installation of paraview (2.2 release 1) so I cannot say 
weather these issues have been addressed yet.

Thanks Terry, I am familliar with the paper. in passing my algorithm doesn't 
involve stitching as described in the paper. Although the ordered contour 
class does exist in VTK 5, I haven't seen it's implementation in paraview as 
of yet(some one please correct me on that if I'm wrong). The hierarchical 
data produced by the hierarchical fractal source in PARAVIEW for instance is 
still subject to the visualization errors described in the paper you 
mentioned and my last mail. That & the lag in documentation of VTK's new 
classes, cell types and iso-surface algorithms lead me to write the 
converter. by doing so I could have the error free visualization that I relly 
on for debugging my CHOMBO codes now.

No flattening. we have chosen to map every AMR patch into an HDF5
Dataset, although I did not spend much time to justify this particular
choice. Each dataset is them trivially loaded into a VTK Uniform Grid.

Unfortunately, ParaView's working directory is now the one on the server. I
think we should add functionality to type in a directory to switch to in the
browser. Do you mind adding a feature request in the bug tracker?

Subject: [Paraview] Array look-ups in Calculator filter
Message-ID: <444F8BFB.2060509@uchicago.edu>

Is there a way to have the calculator filter perform an operation where 
the generation of each point in the output array requires information 
from more than one point in the input array? I'm looking to do something 
like this:

* let A = scalar value at input point (x, y, z)
* let B = scalar value at input point (x, y, z+e)
* filter's output at point (x,y,z) = A-B

Is that possible with the calculator (or with some other existing filter)?

Thanks.

This is not possible with the array calculator. I think the only way
to do this is to write a new VTK filter. It is not that hard to do if
you have some experience with C++. Let me know if you need pointers to
get started.

Subject: [Paraview] Probe one variable
Message-ID: <64QFP8004762@awe.co.uk>

Does anyone know of a way to manually select the variable that is plotted
for a line probe? Currently all those that are loaded in memory get plotted
on the same axis.
The only way I've managed to achieve this so far is to load each block of
data individually and select just one variable to be loaded. However, this
workaround is far too long winded if there are many blocks of data with many
variables. The .pvd fileformat does not appear to offer the functionality to
select variable across a group of files.
Also is there some way to output the probed data as ASCII?
Thanks
Rupert

I see the problem. It seems to be a bug in CVS but not in 2.4. I'll
look into it in the next few days.

There is a set of checkbuttons in the ParaView gui that you can use to 
turn on or off any of the variables in the plot. There is also a button 
labelled "Save as CSV" that saves an ascii "*.csv" file. The format of 
that file is:

VAR1NAME,sample1,sample2...
VAR2NAME,sample1,sample3...
"X or T",tick1pos,tick2pos,...

The X or T line represents the independent axis where the samples occurred.

If the GUI does not show these buttons, can you tell me what version you 
are using?

What version of ParaView are you using?  In ParaView 2.4, after you 
click Accept, there is a list of check boxes at the bottom of the 
Parameters tab that lets you turn on and off the variables listed.

The probed data can be saved as a CSV file.  There is a button at the 
bottom of the Parameters tab for the Probe filter to save the data in 
this way.  CSV is an ASCII file format, and it can be loaded into MS Excel.

After having read your paper, I see that my converter will still be subject to 
iso surface cracks in 3d & delaunay issues you describe. Thanks for the link.

So, with this setup i can compile it but when i start paraview then i get a segmentation fault and it crashes. Before i have switched to static libraries but then i got lots of vtk errors with undefined functions:

vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithmCommand(vtkClientServerInterpreter*, vtkObjectBase*, char const*, vtkClientServerStream const&, vtkClientServerStream&) 
vtkPVMain::Initialize(int*, char***)
...

Thanks for any help

Subject: [Paraview] Animation Timing
Message-ID: <1146147383.21938.17.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I've noticed that the times assigned to key frames are a little odd. The
movie produced is fast at the beginning, and slows down at the end. 

All I do is position the camera so that it's looking at my specimen from
the left, add a frame, reposition half way to an anterior view, add a
frame, an anterior view, half way to a dorsal view, and so on for 5
views, then back to left. The times produced are:

0 33.788 45.051 60.068 80.09 106.79 142.38 189.84 253.12 337.5 450 600

Those look sort of parabolic, while I was thinking they should be
linear. I'm using paraview from CVS.

If I correct the times, and select the MPEG2 writer, paraview crashes
complaining :

# Error or warning: There was a VTK Warning in file: /home/kevin/kitware/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkMPEG2Writer.cxx (64)
 vertical_size must be a even (4:2:0)

When I reload my paraview state file with the key frames :-) the portion
of the key frame menu where the properties of the frame can be edited is
hidden. Re-selecting the camera in the tracks portion allows me to edit
the key frame times.

Saving the animation with sizes of the correct multiples seems to be
working.

Message-ID: <s450a907.010@co.mgn.netl.doe.gov>

Hi all,
 
We are trying to use vtkstd::map inside a vtk reader in paraview.  It
seems to compile ok, but I get a SYNTAX ERROR in parsing the header.  It
give a line number where the vtkstd::map is located.  
 
How do I fix this problem.
 
Thanks,

It looks like the Wrappers are raising the error.
Try enclosing the offending declaration between //BTX //ETX

eg.

//BTX
  vtkstd::map MyMap;
//ETX

Subject: [Paraview] paraview2.4.3 and tru64
Message-ID: <1998B64BEC79FB13A76D134C@harpo.psc.edu>

Matthias,

We have installed ParaView 2.4.3 on a Dec Alpha machine running Tru64 and 
so our results might help. I've attached the CMakeLists.txt files for two 
versions, one serial and one using MPI, both using Mesa.

Since there are so many changes we use a cache initialization file using 
the "-C" option on the cmake command line. Again, there are versions with 
and without mpi, both attached.

Our machine might be a little different than yours; see 
<http://www.psc.edu/machines/tcs/lemieux.html>.

Good luck!

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython and scalar range
Message-ID: <d3d4ab920604281052h4aef33c0i2d7062dc48bf3e42@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to use ServerManager in python. I got stuck with the
DataInformation property.

I created a simple animation of scalar values. I need to get the
current scalar range. However, the DataInformation property (of the
source proxy) returns the scalar range from the whole animation.

I'm reading this information in this way:

    self._src.UpdateDataInformation()
    inf = self._src.GetProperty("DataInformation")
    inf = inf.GetSubProperty("PointData")
    inf = inf.GetSubProperty("Arrays")
    inf = inf.GetSubProperty("Elevation")
    inf = inf.GetSubProperty("ComponentRanges")
    min = inf.GetElement(0)
    max = inf.GetElement(1)

Are there any suggestions about how to reset these values for each
frame? Is there some other way where to go?

Thank you in advance for any suggestions,
Milan.

Thanks I'll report back after I re-checkout, re-build, and re-try.
