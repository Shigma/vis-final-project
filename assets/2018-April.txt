Subject: [Paraview] Python and ParaView: customizing mouse actions
Message-ID: <20180402111923.8d10efb743d518d2db624764@paranoici.org>

Hello!

I am trying to visualize data with ParaView from a Python script.
After creating a render view with paraview.simple.CreateRenderView(),
I set its InteractionMode to '2D', since the data are two-dimensional
and I am not interesting in rotating them.

After loading the data and setting some options, the scripts runs:

    paraview.simple.Render()
    paraview.simple.Interact()

Everything seems to work, but I would like to customize the camera
movements associated with mouse events.
By default, with 2D InteractionMode, I get:

 ? left mouse button ? Pan
 ? middle mouse button ? Roll
 ? right mouse button ? Zoom
 ? mouse wheel ? Zoom

I would like to change the camera movements associated with these mouse
events.
I searched the documentation about ParaView Python scripting, including
the paraview.simple
[module documentation](https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.html),
but failed to find any useful hint.

Could someone please tell me where I can find documentation about this
topic?

Thanks for your time!
Bye.

Thank you for your quick reply Utkarsh. I was preparing the data to send it
to you then I was testing it on my laptop before sending and I can't
reproduce this coloring issue on my laptop. It seems to be working fine on
my laptop so most probably it has to do either with the version or the
display drive on the other workstation that I use. I will let you know if I
have other issues and send you the data then. Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph with Custom Source orientation
Message-ID: <CABDpjTmmh0shEzR5GNczi=u5nPkhgetkPE129-L1DzTCYcGkfw@mail.gmail.com>

With the Glyph with Custom Source filter, there is an "orient" option that
requires Vectors to be set (presumably interpreting 3 values (v_x, v_y,
v_z) at each point). If the Custom Source is something like an arrow, then
this makes some sense (though which axis of the Custom Source would it
align with the Vectors data?). But if the Custom Source is something for
which you want to show a "full" orientation, you'd need to provide
something like a rotation matrix or quaternion at every point. Is it
possible to do this?

Thanks,

David

Hello,

 

I?m using the Kitware fork of ninja, which builds the latest release candidate of ParaView just fine, but when I install it to the specified install location (via ninja install), all of the executables are suddenly unable to find other linked libraries. In the build directory everything works, but the locations of various libraries (ie MPI) don?t carry over, and calling ParaView fails due to not being able to find those libraries.

 

Running ?ldd? on the executable shows that that all the libraries aren?t able to be found.

 

I?m curious if this is just a fact of Ninja as primarily a dev tool, or maybe I?m just not passing it the proper flags?

 

 

Met vriendlijke groet,

REDstack BV

Hi Chris,

AFAIK, ParaView does not require the kitware fork of Ninja.
I just build and installed with Ninja 1.8.2, it works well and the
installed binaries links correctly.

Could you check with a standard Ninja ? and could you precise your
configuration options ?

Best,

Mathieu Westphal

I agree with Mathieu, you don't need a fork of Ninja to build/install
paraview.

Chris you might be interested in the paraview superbuild project -
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild

We use that to 1) make our redistributable binaries and 2) to deploy
paraview on clusters and supercomputers. Two salient features in it are
that 1) it can either build and package or or simply use system versions of
paraview's dependencies, and 2) that it fixes up the library paths when
needed.

So I think I determined that the problem with the missing Hierarchy files
was attributable to trying to use an external VTK installation...

But I noted something very peculiar when trying to build paraview using the
vtk submodule. If I just ran:

cmake ..
make -j32

then I would get a lot of undefined references. If I ran `nm` on a library
like `libvtkCommonCore-9.0.so.1`, all the symbols were local, e.g. `t`, so
the undefined references are not a surprise. Now if I ran `cmake` and
`make` a second time (without touching anything), then the build would go
to completion. `nm` on the same library now reveals all the symbols to be
global.

I got the same behavior when just building a stand-alone vtk.

Anyone have a hypothesis for explaining this odd behavior? This is when
building on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04). If I build on OS X, then a single `cmake`
and `make` successfully build.

Subject: [Paraview] AppendAttributes issue
Message-ID: <CAOyVGJZNV6dH6FPHhxq40U8AtGMeOtcJJuO6RmZbiu2EZejnpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have an UCD (ASCII) and a DEM, I would like to color the UCD by elevation
(since the UCD alone just can be color by Material ID, which has nothing to
do with elevation). For this I got a DEM with the exactly same array than
the UCD. I apply AppendAtributes to both and I can color now with
elevation. The problem is that the elevation color is upside down. I
attached a picture to make sense.

Thank you very much for your attention. I hope you could help me.

Any chance you could share the datasets and maybe a state file so that I
could try to reproduce your issue?

I can't think of anything off the top of my head that would case this.

This has to do with the origin of our vtkImageData which is not using the
same as your elevation data.

Hi there,

I have assignment where data is produced in C, and i have to export it to a relevant file format that works with a visualisation software of my choice.

I've chosen Paraview, because i know that CSV files work with this software.

Rather than table to points, i want to be able to convert the points to a volumetric dataset... So i can have greater control over colour mapping. But i was told that the code that generates the dataset is missing some data, or i may have missed something in the way i export the file.

I've included the code below; i would love some help with this. I'm only decent with coding in Java and my lecturer has really given the class a lot of support.

Cheers

In order for this to work, your CSV file has to contain columns for both the spatial position AND the vectors you want to visualize. It looks like the csv file you are creating is actually only writing out the vector field. To get this to work, your gen_sally function should fill a second array that simply contains the x, y, and z variables on the inner loop. Then your create_csv function should write a csv file with 6 columns. Three of them are for the position coordinate I just described, and the other 3 are the vector that you are currently writing.

Message-ID: <DBEF383764FCE7428354CFA9A0591A860214D2045E@eonblitz16.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de>

Dear all,

I am using XDMF to visualize an HDF5 file in Paraview (see attached test.xmf and test.h5). The data is arranged in a 4D array, which I cut into two 3D arrays with HyperSlabs.
Paraview color visualizes this just fine using Threshold, but sets weird (like I choose the wrong data type) min/max values. I am using Paraview 5.4.1 64-bit.

Could you point out what I am doing wrong?

Thank you!
Henrik

Hey guys,

I'm new to Paraview, actually, new to visualising volumetric data.

I've just downloaded some .raw files from the visible human project website for an assignment and have them grouped/ready to go in Paraview. However, when i try and load the data  for volume representation nothing happens, or when i try to represent it with a slice, it says incorrect dimensionality.

Is there anything else i'm missing? I've followed the steps on the wiki and still, nothing happens.

Cheers

The problem is that PV is looping through your points in a different order
for the unstructured grid as you do for the image data.

What you can do is use the Programmable Filter to "fix" this looping
mismatch. Attached is a pvsm which include a Programmable Filter to do that
flip. Note that I had to manually specify the image data extents (637 and
511) in the Python indexing part so if you have a different dimensioned
data set you'll have to edit that to match your specific case.

Best,
Andy

Message-ID: <719730b0c80b47a5aa07b7b8bee1eafa@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Sorry for the spam, but we have had many great entries using ParaView to create excellent HPC visualizations, and I though some ParaView users would like this opportunity to showcase your work. As an added bonus, this year accepted entries will get a publication in the Parallel Computing journal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

			      Call for Papers

	  SC18 Scientific Visualization & Data Analytics Showcase

 The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking,
	  Storage, and Analysis, November 11-16, Dallas, TX, USA

       https://sc18.supercomputing.org/submit/showcases-submissions/

		   *** Submissions due July 31, 2018 ***

	       Contact: vis_showcase at info.supercomputing.org

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


SC18's Scientific Visualization & Data Analytics Showcase provides a forum
for the year's most instrumental movies in HPC.  Selected entries will be
displayed live in a museum/art gallery format. Six accepted finalists will
compete for the Best Visualization Award, and each finalist will present
his or her movie during a dedicated 15-minute presentation. Movies are
judged by overall quality, how they illuminate science, and for creative
innovations in the movie production process.

**Accepted submissions will be published in a virtual special issue of
Parallel Computing.** There will also be both a live display throughout the
conference so that attendees can experience and enjoy the latest in science
and engineering HPC results expressed through state-of-the-art
visualization technologies and a session at SC18 dedicated to the accepted
submissions.

REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS

Submissions need to include a movie (up to 1GB in size) and a short paper
(up to 6 pages including references). The short paper should describe the
scientific story conveyed by the movie, how the visualization helps
scientific discovery, and the "state-of-the-practice" information behind
making the movie.

Each submission will be peer reviewed by the Visualization & Data Analytics
Showcase Committee. Criteria for review include:

  * How effective is the visual communication of the data?
  * How relevant to the HPC community is the visualization?
  * What is the impact of the science story and how well is it told?
  * What visualization techniques were necessary to create the movie?

Finally, submissions should consider SC18's overall theme "HPC Inspires."

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All submissions comprise a video and accompanying manuscript. The video
submitted should be in MP4, MOV, or AVI format and use a codec that will
play in typical desktop computer media players. There is no hard limit on
video length, but typical videos are less than 10 minutes long, and the
submitted file should be no more than 1GB.

The manuscript must be no more than 6 pages including references. The
manuscripts should be formatted according to the guidelines for the
Parallel Computing journal. Please use one of the following two templates
when formatting your manuscript:

  * LaTeX template (preferred):
    https://sc18.supercomputing.org/app/uploads/2018/02/sc18-vis-showcase-latex-template.zip
  * Word template:
    https://sc18.supercomputing.org/app/uploads/2018/02/sc18-vis-showcase-template.docx.zip

The manuscript should be uploaded as a pdf for the initial submission.
Authors of accepted submissions will have to send the original material
(.tex or .docx files and any source image files) to Parallel Computing's
publisher.

Visualization showcase entries are submitted through the SC Submission Site
(https://submissions.supercomputing.org/). Sign in, click the "Make a New
Submission" tab, and then select the "Scientific Visualization & Data
Analytics Showcase" link.

PROCEEDINGS

The manuscripts of the six accepted submissions will be published in a
special virtual issue of Parallel Computing. Because the Parallel Computing
journal does not have the same publisher as the proceedings of the rest of
the SC conference, authors will have to resubmit their content. (There will
not, however, be a separate review process.)

BEST VISUALIZATION

After accepted authors present their work, a select committee will choose
among them for the Best Visualization Award. The winner of the Best
Visualization Award will be presented during the SC Awards Session.

IMPORTANT DATES

Video/Manuscript Submission:    July 31, 2018

Thanks for the data files.  Unfortunately, you need to know more about them.  I assume it is just a raw binary file, with a width and height?  Try opening it in ParaView, use the Raw (binary) Files Reader, type in the Byte Order, Dimensionality (I assume 2), and the Data Extents.  Note that Data Extents are 0 based.

Other than this advice, I don't really know anything else about this data.  By the way, where is the web page you got the data from?

Hey guys,

I'm new to Paraview, actually, new to visualising volumetric data.

I've just downloaded some .raw files from the visible human project website for an assignment and have them grouped/ready to go in Paraview. However, when i try and load the data  for volume representation nothing happens, or when i try to represent it with a slice, it says incorrect dimensionality.

Is there anything else i'm missing? I've followed the steps on the wiki and still, nothing happens.

Cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Displaying Time Value for a spatial XDMF grid collection
Message-ID: <CAD0qPxQ1-rVRVux=A9dzOvtnrKeW_ugJktCXOtH_zOfR1Y6TiQ@mail.gmail.com>

 Hello,

I am trying to get Paraview to display the time value of spatial grid
collection. I am not interested in loading in a time series as each time
instance is very large. I simply would like to display the time for a
particular data set.
In the information tab, I can see that Paraview Reads the value of the time
in, however it doesn't reflect it in the time bar above which is what the
annotate time filter displays.

Is there something I am missing about the XDMF time display?

My XMF file looks like this:

Subject: [Paraview] Creating Spatial Positions For Optimum Results In
 Paraview
Message-ID: <1F365B0266F8E74BA974B109C1175048158863@ISS-MBX03.tawe.swan.ac.uk>

Hi there,

I've had some great advice on here previously, however it isn't supplying the correct results.

I've spoken to my lecturer and have done some digging myself, and the reason i believe that the code (attached below) isn't providing a decent output to use in Paraview is that it's missing spatial positioning. I know the equations to do so, but i'm absolutely stuck on where to include them in the code: to find the position of x is: i * dx / xMax. where i is the index of the current data sample and xMax is 10. dx is the unit position between the data samples, so to find this it will be number of data samples along x / xMax.V The same applies for y. But just to reiterate, i have not the slightest idea on where or how to implement this in my current set up.

Secondly, when using the output provided by the code, if to loo, it looks as if all of the z slices are on top of one another. (To note, when compiling the code in commandline, i use 64 64 64 1). Correct me if i'm wrong, but I believe that the spatial positioning will rectify, or it could be the row id that Paraview generates. (Side note, i'm using dot to points to just to get an idea of the datas layout)

Thanks so much for the help in advance

All,

I'm sure I'm missing something here, so please knock me up alongside the head and point it out.

I load a sideset (surface) from an Exodus file.   I end up with a bunch of quads that Paraview conveniently created for me from the surface.   I need to calculate a Normal vector for each of these quads.  I have tried:

Generate surface normal - this is greyed out (wants poly data?)

Delaunay 3D on this to generate poly data, which I could then hopefully run Generate surface normal on, but it was still greyed

Tried Normal Glyphs which gave me point Normal vectors but gave me a bunch of Triangle and Polygon elements - I'm not sure what's going on here.
    PointDataToCellData to get GlyphVector for each Cell
    Python Calculator and ask for area(inputs[0]) the Polygon elements all get an Area of -1
    Calculator to get Area_X as product of GlyphVector_X and Area
    Threshold on Area_X > 0 -  don't want negative areas or some boundary cells with GlyphVector_X as negative
    Python Calculator to get sum(Area_X)
    This number appears to be about half of my expected number

These must be an easier way.  I'm not a vtk guru.   When I first load my surface, is there some vtk routine I could call within a Programmable filter to get the cell normal?????

Alternatively, anyone got an easier way to skin this cat?

Thanks for any hints  you may have.

Dennis

Dennis,

Yes, this cat has a zipper that allows it's skin to come right off. (Maybe I took that "skin the cat" metaphor a bit too far.)

Anyway, just run the Extract Surface filter. After that you can run the Generate Surface Normals filter.

Ken,

Thanks for that wake-up!   I guess loading "Surface_1000" had me thinking I already had a "Surface",  but Exodus "surface" and Paraview "surface" are not the same.

With right thinking this was easy this morning.

Thanks again!

All,

Well, this list solved my problem so easily (and made me feel slightly less than the sharpest pencil in the box) yesterday, so I thought I'd try again.

I am doing some Python calcs inside a programmable filter and some of the results I want to average from the Points onto the Cells.   But,  I don't want all my PointData moved over to CellData - I want to transfer some of them over within my Filter.

Right now I'm looping thru all the elements and finding all their nodes, then averaging them and assigning to the cells.  It is dog slow and is choking off the usefulness of this filter.

Is there anything like vtkPointDataToCellData that lets me specify which quantities to convert - could I do something tricky like store original list of PointData, make up a new list, then run PointDataToCellData, then restore the list of PointData ??

I realize this may have all sorts of unexpected side effects, so I'm just asking!

Thanks again, this group is great!

Dennis

The pass arrays filter comes to mind.

If creating withing your python programmable filter it will be called
vtk.vtkPassArrays then follow that with a vtk.vtkPointDataToCellData.

Hi,

The build from the source (checked out from a clone git repo.)
was OK. (on linux, fedora-27, x86_64, gcc 7.3.1 20180303 (Red Hat 7.3.1-5))
CMake options:
  set(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ON  CACHE BOOL "")
  set(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION    ON  CACHE BOOL "")
  set(BUILD_EXAMPLES         ON  CACHE BOOL "")
  set(BUILD_TESTING          OFF CACHE BOOL "")

But the installation failed...
Indeed, there's no INSTALL file both in build and git directories...

What's wrong with my build?

Subject: [Paraview] Particle Tracking on Periodic Meshes
Message-ID: <40c62afd-66f5-2d8f-3bab-c49ad69d988f@imperial.ac.uk>

Hello,

I'm currently using paraview to visualise and measure mean square 
displacement of massless particles in a velocity field (currently in 
2d). The tracking of these particles and export of their locations to a 
csv file is fairly straightforward and works as expected.

My issue is that my flow field is a flat 2d mesh that is periodic. I 
would like my tracked particles to wrap around and respect the periodic 
nature of the mesh and the flow field. Is this possible in some way? I 
imagine mapping the mesh to the surface of a cylinder is one option, but 
then then particles do not follow the field as I expect.

I'd love solutions/advice, as currently my domain is not long enough to 
generate statistically useful diffusion data.

Many thanks,

Doug Addy

Message-ID: <D76635C9-17F2-4A4A-9245-AD763832BF1A@bluequartz.net>

ParaView 5.5.0. Was setting up a new animation that I was saving out to disk. 1400 Timesteps. Started the export as .png images but the images are not correct. So how do I cancel the export? On my machine the export will take about 25 minutes so waiting for it to finish kind sucks. Force quitting seems to be the only obvious way to stop it. But then I lost my state (maybe having a backup state file somewhere might help recover from this).

I will assume "operator error" on this one: Where is the cancel animation export button?

MacOS 10.13.x with ParaView 5.5.0.?

Doesn't ring a bell, sorry. If it's fairly reproducible, please do
report an issue with the steps to reproduce so we can track it down.

Hi Kazuyoshi,

I'm not sure we ever tested running make install with
BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON.  Our documentation builds rsync the generated html
documentation from the build directory.  And unless you want to build the
html documentation locally you should just be able to turn off that option
and it will work.


HTH,
Shawn

Seems to be a "Non retina" issue. I tried the same export on my Retina 2013 MacBook Pro and the images are correct. The original export was done on a standard non-retina monitor.

Hi,

currently I'm struggling with the following problem:
I've a complex Python 3.6 (miniconda, windows 10) project which generates 3D point clouds (stored in numpy arrays).
Now I want to use ParaView as a frontend for my application and I wanted to ask if this is possible or if somebody already achieved this?

Greetings,
Philip Klaus

Dear Klaus,

You should be able to compile ParaView with Python 3.6 support, and then
load the paraview module and start displaying sources, filters and views
within your project.

Once you are able to do that, you could use a ProgrammableSource to display
your numpy arrays. You can "transfer" your arrays to the source either via
writing/reading from the disk
of via the ProgrammableSource's own "parameters" arguments.

Let us know if you need further help.

Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

I am currently working with Paraview  and deep learning models. I have
created a set of images (.png) using Paraview. The images are related to
the pressure field around a wing. When I load images back to Paraview all I
can visualise are the RGB  values.
*When the image are exported from Paraview the pressure field is
transferred into RGB values. Is there a way to obtain the function that
does that?*
Instead of exporting to .png a data format that I like is the .vti. This
format keep the current information about pressure, velocity, mach number
etc. Is there something that I could export a slice  to .vti?

 Many thanks and I am looking forward to hear from you.

Cheers,

Andrei

Dear Andrei,

I'm not sure to follow what your are trying to achieve. Please explain
again.

In any case, the mapping between the pressure and the RGB values you see in
paraview is controlled by
the Color Map Editor and the range of the data. All these tools are
accessible in the Toolbar visible in the attached image, I've highligthed
the Color Editor button.

Best regards,


Mathieu Westphal

Subject: [Paraview] DigitalRockPhysics Plugin Usage
Message-ID: <5C1CC6B4-269C-4184-9A8C-E1C35D8D4311@bluequartz.net>

What kind of data do I need to have in order to use both of the new Digital Rock Physics Filters? I ask because I would like to reproduce the screen shots from the ParaView 5.5.0 release notes but with our own data. Our current data set is an Image data where we have a Scalar value called "Feature ID" that groups voxels into unique features. The values are 32 bit signed integer. I can run the Material Cluster Analysis filter and that seems to run but when I run the Material Cluster Explode filter ?I get a bunch of flat "sheets" instead of the features that I should be seeing? Is there an example data set somewhere that could be used to experiment with these filters?

So the issue is related to when you export an animation as a bunch of images and when the options dialog window comes up you change the resolution of the output image to some custom value which forces the rendering portion of the window to become smaller. What I did to work-around the issue is that I used the new "preview" mode of ParaView 5.5.0 to set the preview to 1920x1080, then did the export animation and the images are saved correctly. This is reproducible on several of my macOS machines here at work.

The reason I had to cancel was that the images being saved were corrupted with a "stitch line" both horizontally and vertically (Image attached). ParaView 5.4.1 did not do this. Thoughts? My video card inside my MacPro is a Radeon 7950 3GB card in a Mac Pro 5,1.

So how do I cancel the export? On my machine the export will take about 25 minutes so waiting for it to finish kind sucks. Force quitting seems to be the only obvious way to stop it. But then I lost my state (maybe having a backup state file somewhere might help recover from this).

Hi Michael,

There is example data in our test data, please find it attached with an
example usage of the Explode filter.

Hi ParaView,

For OSPRay, is there a way to set the sampling rate of the rays in ParaView? i.e. samplingRate as referenced in the OSPRay documentation, Table 6 on this page
https://www.ospray.org/documentation.html

Thanks,

Thanks for the data. The difference was that your data was point based where ours was Cell based. I ran the Cell data to Point Data filter and then was able to successfully run the 2 Rock filters. The results were not as I expected. Some of our ?Features? are getting exploded down to the pixel level where others are successfully kept intact. I am not familiar with the Digital Rock Physics or the algorithm being used but there probably is enough of a difference between the assumptions that the filter isn?t going to work for us. I am happy to provide sample data sets and discuss what the data is and if the filters would truly work on our data. The visualization is novel and I think it would help our users in the long run if we could figure out the differences.

 

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] OSPray scivis - samples along the cast ray when
 volume rendering?

Hi Mark,

Sorry no it is not fully hooked up yet.

By default we use some heuristics to pick a sampling rate, and we have a
TODO comment in the code to hook that up for the cases when, like now, you
need better control.

Chime in if you like on this related bug report:

Hello

Please keep the ML in the cc so everyone can provide.

You should be able to do that in the python shell.

Views->Python Shell

s = GetActiveSource()
r=Show(s)
l=r.LookupTable
l.RGBPoints


Best,

You can export to cinema to get rendered images for which the data at each
pixel in the image is a floating point value not a color.

Dear Michael

CellDataToPointData is interpolating at the points, so the results is
incorrect because of all these small interpolated cluster.

In any case, Explode should work with CellData as well, this is definitelly
a bug. I've opened an issue on our gitlab.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18108

A work around this bug would be to generate point data directly without
interpolation.

Cool,

Dear Michael

CellDataToPointData is interpolating at the points, so the results is incorrect because of all these small interpolated cluster.

In any case, Explode should work with CellData as well, this is definitelly a bug. I've opened an issue on our gitlab.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18108

A work around this bug would be to generate point data directly without interpolation.

Thanks for the data. The difference was that your data was point based where ours was Cell based. I ran the Cell data to Point Data filter and then was able to successfully run the 2 Rock filters. The results were not as I expected. Some of our ?Features? are getting exploded down to the pixel level where others are successfully kept intact. I am not familiar with the Digital Rock Physics or the algorithm being used but there probably is enough of a difference between the assumptions that the filter isn?t going to work for us. I am happy to provide sample data sets and discuss what the data is and if the filters would truly work on our data. The visualization is novel and I think it would help our users in the long run if we could figure out the differences.

 

Thanks

Hi Michael,

There is example data in our test data, please find it attached with an example usage of the Explode filter.

Best regards,

What kind of data do I need to have in order to use both of the new Digital Rock Physics Filters? I ask because I would like to reproduce the screen shots from the ParaView 5.5.0 release notes but with our own data. Our current data set is an Image data where we have a Scalar value called "Feature ID" that groups voxels into unique features. The values are 32 bit signed integer. I can run the Material Cluster Analysis filter and that seems to run but when I run the Material Cluster Explode filter ?I get a bunch of flat "sheets" instead of the features that I should be seeing? Is there an example data set somewhere that could be used to experiment with these filters?

Subject: [Paraview] Error when starting ssh session on PV5.5
Message-ID: <DB6PR0701MB2533769C4BDF81251F72E5C38BBC0@DB6PR0701MB2533.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

I just recently installed the recent release of ParaView 5.5 to test out 
some of the new functionality, but I'm unable to connect to my server 
from a Windows laptop client. I've tried both manually starting it on 
the server and starting `pvserver` through SSH in the client itself.  
Both cause the client on my laptop to freeze with an error message 
similar to 'paraview.exe stopped working' and I get a bunch of errors on 
the server that are all the following:

```shell
ERROR: In /home/chris/Software/ParaView/paraview-src/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx, line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x1878cc0): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.
```

I have both ParaView 5.4.1 and 5.5 installed on the server as well as 
the client, but currently only 5.4.1 works over SSH. Server was 
installed via a git-checkout and on the client via 
www.paraview.org/download/. Specifically I tried both the ParaView 
downloads with and without MPI, but neither solved the problem. Btw, 
what's the difference between those two? I see only one option for Linux 
(with MPI).

Both installations on Windows use the same 'load servers' (XML?) script 
that I configured to automate the ssh connection. The only changes were 
for the path to `pvserver` and the `--use-offscreen-loading` flag 
(5.4.1) was changed to `--force-offscreen-loading` (5.5).

I built both 5.4.1 and 5.5 again on the server to test, and I can't find 
a difference between the builds. Here's the `cmake` command I used for 
5.5. Version numbers were adjusted accordingly for 5.4.1 (5.5->5.4):


```shell
cmake ../paraview-src-5.5 \
-DBUILD_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which gcc` \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which g++` \
-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=`which gfortran` \
-DMPI_C_COMPILER=`which mpicc` \
-DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` \
-DMPI_Fortran_COMPILER=`which mpifort` \
-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_FFMPEG:BOOL=ON \
-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON \
-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=`which python3` \
-DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON \
-DMPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS:STRING=`nproc` \
-DQT_HELP_GENERATOR:STRING=`which qhelpgenerator-qt5` \
-DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:STRING=`which qmake-qt5` \
-DQT_XMLPATTERNS_EXECUTABLE:STRING=`which xmlpatterns-qt5` \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING="/usr/local/lib/paraview-5.5" \
-G Ninja \
-DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=$HOME/Software/ninja/ninja \
&& $HOME/Software/ninja/ninja
```

Also a side question: On the client, ParaView doesn't keep multiple 
servers.pvsc files for each version of `paraview` installed on the 
client (in %APPDATA%\Roaming\ParaView\), although it does keep separate 
.ini files.  Is this expected?

I have not seen the windows 5.5 no ssh problem yet so I can't comment.

For linux and mac we can bundle MPI. For windows it is easier to depend
upon the user to install microsoft's mpi (it is free and works well).
However the mpi-enabled version relies on the availability of microsoft
MPI, this we also publish an MPI free version.

Yes.

hope that helps. Hopefully others can continue on the track of the ssh
problem.

Dear Mathiew/David,


Thanks a lot for you guidance. That was very helpful.
I have seen that you also support VTI. I had a look at the structure of the
format and it seems that this is a structured/rectilinear grid. The data
that I am woking with right now is unstructured .pvd.
Is there are way in Paraview to project/sample my unstructured dataset to a
rectiliniar/structured grid so then I can export it to .VTI format?

Many thanks and I am looking forward to hear from you.

Best,

Andrei

Dear Andrei,

Yes, the "Resample To Image" Filter is dedicated to this task. It will
allow convert you Unstructured Grid to a regular Image Data and allow you
to save your data as a .vti file.

Andrei,

I'm able to generate valid results with the attached state file (use
File->Load State to test it)
Make sure to set the Sampling Dimensions correctly.

Mathieu,

Thanks a lot. When I load your .pvsm Paraview 5.4.1 crashes .Could you
export the state as .py instead of .pvsm?

Thanks a lot

Andrei,

Here you go.

It is actually quite simple :
 - Open ParaView
 - Open Your file, Apply
 - Add a ressample with Image
 - Sampling Dimensions : 200 1 200
 - Apply

Thanks for the reply to my questions David, that solves two out of the three.

I?m still curious about the SSH problem with 5.5, though. For now I?ll stick with 5.4.1

I have not seen the windows 5.5 no ssh problem yet so I can't comment.

Other replies:

 Specifically I tried both the ParaView
downloads with and without MPI, but neither solved the problem. Btw,
what's the difference between those two? I see only one option for Linux
(with MPI).

For linux and mac we can bundle MPI. For windows it is easier to depend upon the user to install microsoft's mpi (it is free and works well). However the mpi-enabled version relies on the availability of microsoft MPI, this we also publish an MPI free version.

Also a side question: On the client, ParaView doesn't keep multiple
servers.pvsc files for each version of `paraview` installed on the
client (in %APPDATA%\Roaming\ParaView\), although it does keep separate
.ini files.  Is this expected?

Yes.

hope that helps. Hopefully others can continue on the track of the ssh problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Simple animation query
Message-ID: <CACvTYE5G1=rP79YK1bKOM4zm669yKNxfwC8ve15arwu5SfRN_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I am trying to learn how to make animations in Paraview by moving the
camera.  I have downloaded Paraview 5.5 on Windows 10.  Whenever I try to
use orbit or path (whether using my own data or the can.ex2 data set or a
simple cone source, doesn't seem to make a difference) I get several
instances of this error as soon as I press the blue plus botton:


Generic Warning: In
C:\bbd\7cc78367\build\superbuild\paraview\src\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx,
line 641

Call not supported for the current property type.


If I try the orbit option I get the orbit parameters pop up window before
the error messages.  If I select path I go straight to the error messages.
I'd just like to make a simple animation where I have a simple path to show
some key features of a 3D non-transient data set.

There are a couple of screenshots here:
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgZvu2hmiPjh3VRRGjHLQRPI6trx
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgZvu2hmiPjh3VOclc7SUzpZLcSn

I've also tried it with Paraview 5.0.  I can't get anywhere with that
either.  No popups appear when I press the blue plus button (something with
parameters should pop up right?), though I don't get actual error messages
as such.

Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?

Thanks!
Rupert

Hi Rupert

I reproduced the warnings and they should not appear, but the orbit
fonctionnality seemed to works perfectly after that.
It did not work in your case ?

Well, I am new to these animation techniques so was rather put off by the
error messages so perhaps didn't persevere as much as I should have!  You
are right, the orbit does appear to play ... so hold off any further help
for now - I will go through the documentation and my data in detail and
verify whether it is working as expected.  I'll post again if I still have
troubles.  If I don't post again in the next few days then please assume
that all is fine.  Thanks for the nudge to press on!

Chris, are you using an SSH tunnel to connect the client to the server?

As a reference point, I was able to connect from a Windows client to a
linux server using the binaries from paraview.org/download with no SSH
tunnel.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Cory,

Indeed I?m using an SSH tunnel from my client to connect to the server, specifically with the following command:

```
ssh <user>@<remotehost> DISPLAY=:0.0 /path/to/mpiexec -np 4 /path/to/pvserver" --server-port=11111 --client-host=<clienthost> --force-offscreen-rendering
```

How would I start the pvserver remotely without SSH? Both client and remote are on the same VPN network.

I have not seen the windows 5.5 no ssh problem yet so I can't comment.

Other replies:

 Specifically I tried both the ParaView
downloads with and without MPI, but neither solved the problem. Btw,
what's the difference between those two? I see only one option for Linux

For linux and mac we can bundle MPI. For windows it is easier to depend upon the user to install microsoft's mpi (it is free and works well). However the mpi-enabled version relies on the availability of microsoft MPI, this we also publish an MPI free version.

Yes.

What I did to work-around the issue is that I used the new "preview" mode of ParaView 5.5.0 to set the preview to 1920x1080, then did the export animation and the images are saved correctly. This is reproducible on several of my macOS machines here at work.

The reason I had to cancel was that the images being saved were corrupted with a "stitch line" both horizontally and vertically (Image attached). ParaView 5.4.1 did not do this. Thoughts? My video card inside my MacPro is a Radeon 7950 3GB card in a Mac Pro 5,1.

So how do I cancel the export? On my machine the export will take about 25 minutes so waiting for it to finish kind sucks. Force quitting seems to be the only obvious way to stop it. But then I lost my state (maybe having a backup state file somewhere might help recover from this).

Hello,

Is the Python shell moved/gone in this release? I no longer see it under 
Tools > Python shell (OS is Ubuntu 16.04). I've attached a screenshot 
for this. I definitely see it in PV 5.4.1.

Thanks,
Shuhao

See https://blog.kitware.com/dockable-python-shell-in-paraview/ for more
details on the change to the Python console. The big thing is that it is
now dockable.

Thanks! I don't think it was in the release note and also the paraview 
guide for 5.5 doesn't have this new instructions either.

Dear ParaView community,
I tried to update openSuse's ParaView RPM. Unfortunately I get the

Can someone please have a look whether it is a bug or a wrong
configuration from openSuse? The CMake call is

%cmake  -DPV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR:PATH=%{_lib}/%{name} \
        -DVTK_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=include/%{name} \

Unrelated, but still irritating are dozens of CMake warnings like:

Unfortunately, plots are notoriously hard to get right. Partly, the
default settings of programs like gnuplot or Excel are to blame for
this since these programs make it very convenient to create bad plots.

Christoph,

What openSuse version are you building on? I'll see if I can reproduce
using the same version Docker image, if available. Will make it easier
to track down.

Subject: [Paraview] How find local maxima of a scalar field in a slice
Message-ID: <17954FF4A6EDC447B60CEFADD6DCAE930277486E@GSVCLU05.ges.ferlan.it>

Dear all,
I need to find the local maxima of a scalar field on a slice in Paraview.
I need both the value of my scalar variable and also the tridimensional position of the local maxima.
Searching on the blog, I have found a possible vtk function:
https://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.0/html/a01562.html

Someone of you know some simpler and faster way to solve my problem (maybe using numpy library)?

I thank you in advance for all suggestions,
Andrea

Hi Utkarsh,
I used openSuse build service (OBS) which currently builds it on Leap
42.2 and Tumblewheed. If you want to give it a shot, try the package
which I branched:

Dear All ?

I have a binary data set in EnSight case gold format and it reads into ParaView on my windows PC just fine. Does anyone know if the same data set will work when using ParaView  on a Mac that is running 10.12 or 10.13?

Thanks, Randy

I have a multi-block dataset in which I need to do some analysis on the surface between 2 blocks (specifically, I want to do a SurfaceVectors analysis on this surface, to find out how much fluid is flowing from one block to the other). I can?t figure out how to extract this surface, other than doing some very messy cropping. Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Dear Randy,

Reader code is not platform specific, so it should not be a problem.

As a side note, we consider ParaView to be fully cross-platform, so any
missing/broken feature on a specific platform should be considered a bug.

Best,

Mathieu Westphal

Dear Andrea

The range maximum value can be read directly in the information tab of your
data, in the "Data Arrays" section.
Or you can directly create a new "Spreadsheet view", show your data in it
and sort the data by clicking on your scalars array header, you will know
the value et the localisation.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Control over camera movement for animations
Message-ID: <CACvTYE49yq3ngFQsCm4eLLpEbOEGF2y-_ehtW+e2Cv35VuW=iA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, I am making progress learning to make animations with Paraview.
The animation capabilities in Paraview are very good.  There appear to be a
couple of limitations, but I am not sure whether these are limitations in
my understanding or in Paraview itself.  Details below.  Thanks!

When I use the "follow path" option it does not seem to be possible to
adjust the "up direction" within a path.  I can have a different "up
direction" in subsequent paths within one animation, but the jump between
up directions is abrupt.  Are there any plans to allow up direction to
change as a path is followed?  Is there a way to smooth the jump between
subsequent paths with a different up direction?

With the "follow path" option there doesn't seem to be any way of using the
current camera view like in the "Interpolate camera locations" option.  Is
this possible?  Is it likely to be implemented in the future?  Even if the
"up direction" information for the current camera view is lost I would
still find such a functionality useful.

If I want a new path to start or finish at the same place as a previous
path then I have to open the window for the previous path, copy one of the
coords, close the window, open the window for the new path, paste the
coord, then repeat for all other coords.  This is a lot of
point-and-clicking.  Is there a way to short cut this?  For example having
2 path windows open concurrently would be a help, or being able to create a
new path as a copy of a previous path would be even better.

When I use "Interpolate camera locations" there seems to be quite a long
slow overshoot.  I guess Paraview is doing some kind of spline
interpolation.  Is there a way to stop it doing this?  Simple linear
interpolation between locations would be just fine for my purposes.  My
current approach to minimise this overshoot is to copy my target location
several times in close temporal proximity.  e.g. if I want to move from
position A at the start to position B after 10 seconds, then stay at
position B, my current approach is to repeat position B at 10, 10.5 and 11
seconds.  This isn't perfect but it is a manageable workaround.

I REALLY like the ability to use the current camera view when setting up
camera locations for interpolation.

BTW I am making animations for a public lecture on Antarctic ice sheet
modelling.  If you want to see what I come up with let me know, I'll be
happy to share.

Regards,
Rupert

Dear Mathieu,
Thanks for your suggestions.
If I have understood correctly, your method can works only in the case in which I have only a maxima like this case:
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Gaussian_2d.png

But if I have to find the local maxima in this case:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/27178/versions/6/previews/html/psPeaksExample.html
in which I have three different local max peaks, your method can works correctly?

Best regards,
Andrea

Dear Jean,
Thanks for your suggestions.
If I have understood correctly, your method can works only in the case in which I have only a maxima like this case:
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Gaussian_2d.png

But if I have to find the local maxima in this case:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/27178/versions/6/previews/html/psPeaksExample.html
in which I have three different local max peaks, your method can works correctly?

Best regards,
Andrea

Dear Andrea,

Both Jean's and my method will not work for your case. I'll admit that I
missed the local part.

The easiest way would be to do it visually with scalar coloring and use
"Hover Points" or "Hover Cells" to find the exact element you are looking
for.

Best,

Mathieu Westphal

How about using the gradient (filter or python calculator expression) to
take the derivative and find the points of inflection. Combine that with
the techniques Mathieu and Jean suggested.

Christoph,

I am totally unfamiliar with OpenSUSE and my initial attempts to even
install a C++ compiler are going no where :). Mind making it easier
for me and just post the full error message that you're getting? Maybe
attaching the /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/ParaView-v5.5.0/build/VTK/ThirdParty/vtkm/vtk-m/lib/cmake/paraview-5.5/vtkm/VTKmConfig.cmake
file will throw some light. Also is this failing when building the
Examples or just ther full ParaView build? I'd suggest disabling
examples, if that's the issue. The ParaView RPM should probably not
include examples any ways.

Hi Christian,

You can use VTK GDALVector reader in ParaView to load shapefiles. You would
have to build ParaView from the master and enable GDAL. It it not available
in

Hi,
I was able to get some nice OSPray renderings using the actual Paraview 
version 5.5. Anyway If I want to load some material json files for 
rendering? I cannot find the option to set the material in the 
properties menue. What I am doing wrong here?

In short, I want to reproduce your SC17 example:

Thanks in advance

Hi Gabiel.

Click the gear icon or use the search field. "OSPRay Material" is flagged
as an advanced option. You will find a handful of example materials in that
list.

Note about the Value Indexed material. That one means "instead of using one
material for the whole object, use the color map to determine the material
for each block or cell"
To demonstrate:
open can.ex2
turn on ospray
turn on path tracer
set OSPRay Material to "Value Indexed"
open Color Map Editor.
change annotation for block 0 from "white" to "aluminum".

Dear David your point is interesting,
But unfortunately if you have a quasi-flat surface with some locals maxima, the gradient is around zero in a big surface of your domain.
For my problem seems very interesting the tool proposed by Jean:
https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/

The installation seems to be a bit tricky but I want install the software and try how it can work.

Responding to Mathieu:
I need a tool that can  run without my supervision and it can find the local maxima in an autonomous way.

As soon as possible I come back to you and share my experience.
For the moment I really thank you for your suggestions.

Best Regards,
Andrea

How about using the gradient (filter or python calculator expression) to take the derivative and find the points of inflection. Combine that with the techniques Mathieu and Jean suggested.

Dear Andrea,
Both Jean's and my method will not work for your case. I'll admit that I missed the local part.
The easiest way would be to do it visually with scalar coloring and use "Hover Points" or "Hover Cells" to find the exact element you are looking for.
Best,

Mathieu Westphal

Dear Jean,
Thanks for your suggestions.
If I have understood correctly, your method can works only in the case in which I have only a maxima like this case:
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Gaussian_2d.png

But if I have to find the local maxima in this case:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/27178/versions/6/previews/html/psPeaksExample.html
in which I have three different local max peaks, your method can works correctly?

use the Edit->Find Data menu

Select Points or Cells.
Select the "from" object (your slice's name)
Select the variable name
Select "is max"

I can build 5.5.0 on opensuse leap 42.3, but do get *really* weird junk 
in the VTKmConfig.cmake file:

# The VTKm version number
set(VTKm_VERSION_MAJOR "4")
set(VTKm_VERSION_MINOR "8")
set(VTKm_VERSION_PATCH "5")
set(VTKm_VERSION_FULL "4.8.5
-- Check for working Fortran compiler: /usr/bin/gfortran
-- Check for working Fortran compiler: /usr/bin/gfortran  -- works
-- Detecting Fortran compiler ABI info
-- Detecting Fortran compiler ABI info - done
-- Checking whether /usr/bin/gfortran supports Fortran 90
-- Checking whether /usr/bin/gfortran supports Fortran 90 -- yes
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: 
/home/mol/test/build/ParaView-5.5.0/CMakeFiles/CheckFortran
")
set(VTKm_VERSION "4.8")


The version "4.8.5" look suspiciously like my gcc version.
The rest of the information "Check for working Fortran" etc, really 
looks like misdirected output somewhere in the cmake files.

Wow! cc-ing Rob. Rob, see below for what's ending up in VTMConfig for
ParaView 5.5. Any suggestions?

Mark, Christoph, for now, I'd recommend turning off PARAVIEW_USE_VTKM
cmake option in your build. It should not impact the default ParaView
capabilities by a whole lot.

Hi Utkarsh,
thanks for the hint. But I got a linker error instead. I attached the
error below. pthread is found by CMake.

Regarding the log and/or VTKmConfig.cmake, it'll take me a couple of
days to provide these. I use the online frontend and have no access to
arbitrary files. I have to use obs to create a local copy and compile it
here.

Bye

Dear ParaView List-

The views are side-by-side. The line chart horizontal axis covers the same time as the rendered-transient dataset. Does anyone know if there is a way to display a transient marker on the line chart so that it is easy to see the current time on the line chart? It would then be easy to relate the RenderView and LineChartView views. If this is not possible with a csv file, do you know if another file format would provide this capability? The csv scalar was generated outside of ParaView.

Dear All:


I generated PLOT3D grid and solution files using CFL3D. And the PLOT3D files can actually be opened by Tecplot.


However, ParaView can only open the grid file correctly. When loading the solution file, there comes the error message as follows:

Subject: [Paraview] Failed to determine the LookupTable being used
Message-ID: <CABrYh3rQByo405znYKZyusfmbOVgmCrqXqr8xSCTXAx2VakXHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:

I have a trace from a simple contour that I drew on a data set, and there
are parts of it that I don't understand. Here it is, with some question
numbers:

from paraview.simple import *

data = EnSightReader(CaseFileName='/my/data/file.case')

renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
dataDisplay = Show(data, renderView1)    ## 1

dataDisplay.Representation = 'Surface'
renderView1.ResetCamera()
dataDisplay.SetScalarBarVisibility(renderView1, True)
renderView1.Update()

pressureLUT = GetColorTransferFunction('pressure')  ## 2
contour1 = Contour(Input=data)

contour1.ContourBy = ['POINTS', 'uds_0_scalar']
contour1.Isosurfaces = [500.0]

contour1Display = Show(contour1, renderView1)
contour1Display.Representation = 'Surface'
Hide(data, renderView1)

contour1Display.SetScalarBarVisibility(renderView1, True) ## 3
renderView1.Update()


My questions:

 1. Why do I have to "Show" the raw data right after it's read? I almost
never actually want to do that. I just want to show the contour. Showing
and Hiding the raw data seems like a waste of cycles, but when I remove
references to dataDisplay, I get an error: "Failed to determine the
LookupTable being used." which seems oddly unrelated to what I did.

 2. Where does this value get used? It doesn't seem to me that it is being
used, but it seems related to the last and the next question:

 3. When I choose different scalar values to contour, I often see the
same "Failed to determine the LookupTable being used." here. There seem to
be some limitations on what scalars I can use, but what are they and where
can I read more about these missing lookup tables?

Thank you,

 -Tom

Show() sets up the representation for the data you have loaded. I suspect
you are getting the LookupTable error message if you retain the "Hide(data,
renderView1)" call because it is expecting to find representation state for
"data" that you have not set up with "Show()" and it cannot find it. Try
removing the "Hide()" and see if you still see the error.

I assume you mean the "dataDisplay" variable. It is not used in your script
directly, but you could set representation properties later on, which is
why the tracing function defines it. Tracing is pretty awesome, but it
doesn't do anything as fancy as analyzing the resulting trace to remove
unused variables, for instance.

See if my answer to 1 solves the problem. If not, do you see this when you
are coloring by the same array as the array for the lookup table? If so,
you should call "contour1.ComputeScalars = 1". This will tell the contour
filter to produce a scalar array corresponding to the array by which you
contoured. It will contain only the isovalues, which is why it is off by
default.

Thanks
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] paraview.simple.Box() and openmpi
Message-ID: <CAJs4fyjm2F+2LQMy-HORu2wDB3fkC343EZLeqkaA6tw-xqq8MA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am facing some trouble to draw a Box using 'paraview.simple.Box()'. When
running in parallel this function fails to draw the boxes at the correct
coordinates as specified by boxLength and boxCenter.
In serial mode, however, the box is drawn at the correct location.

As ad-hoc fix I had to draw the box by using 'paraview.simple.Line()'
multiple times.  This seems to work both in parallel and serial.

Any hep?

Kind Regards
Tiago

Subject: [Paraview] swap x and y axes in LineChartView from PlotOverLine
Message-ID: <96d5103c-2de1-687c-de90-e6da0297a815@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am plotting a line over the middle of my domain. There are a handful 
of vectors associated of interest, and I would like to see in my 
LineChartView, the x and y axes swapped. I attach a screenshot of how I 
see it now("original..")

("one_vector_displayed_as_desired")In "X axis parameters" in the 
Properties of my PlotOverLine1, I have used the X Array Name to be one 
of the vectors of interest and Points_Y as the only "Series Parameter". 
This is the orientation that I would like, but this way only works for 
one vector. I need to see the handful as I can when the default "use 
index for XAxis" is on.

I would appreciate your help on getting the x and y axes swapped.

With many thanks,
Sean

This is all very weird to me. The contents of VTKm_VERSION_FULL is
done by `VTKmDetermineVersion.cmake` which is running an external
command. This smells like the variable we are using (output) already
exists with the contents of the configuration run and now is being
added to.

Mark, are you able to verify that renaming the 'output' variable in
`VTKmDetermineVersion.cmake` corrects the problem?

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with numpy array
Message-ID: <17954FF4A6EDC447B60CEFADD6DCAE9302774FE3@GSVCLU05.ges.ferlan.it>

Dear Users,
I need to solve an eigenproblem in a point of a CFD field.
Using the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet I calculate the velocity gradient of my velocity field, than I isolate may point of interest and I have written the following ProgrammableFilter:

import numpy as np
from numpy import linalg as LA
from paraview import numpy_support
input = inputs[0]

numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()
print "number of points",numPoints
tensors = input.PointData['Gradients']
print "tensors[0:3]",tensors[0:3]
eigenvalues,eigenvectors = LA.eig(tensors)
print 'eigenvalues', eigenvalues[0]
print 'eigenvectors',eigenvectors[0]
output.PointData.append(eigenvalues,'eigenvalues')
output.PointData.append(eigenvectors,'eigenvectors')

I have obtained the following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 22, in <module>
File "<string>", line 14, in RequestData
File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit\bin\lib\site-packages\numpy\linalg\linalg.py", line 1095, in eig
_assertRankAtLeast2(a)
File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit\bin\lib\site-packages\numpy\linalg\linalg.py", line 202, in _assertRankAtLeast2
'at least two-dimensional' % len(a.shape))
numpy.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError: 0-dimensional array given. Array must be at least two-dimensional


I imagine that the problem is linked to the vtk array, I need to convert my ?Gradients? matrix in a nparray?
Someone have the same problem?

Best Regards,
Andrea

Hi Sean,

Just to be sure I understand well, you would like to have the "index" as an
Y Axis ?

Hi Tiago,

Could you please precise which version of ParaView you are using, how do
you start pvserver/ParaView/pvpython, and which python command you are
using exactly.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Filter with Input to pipe to Programmable Filter
Message-ID: <8ced6c19-fb51-67cc-80cd-61b75bdd74a4@dcs-computing.com>

Hi all,

I have made a small Programmable Filter that converts my input data. Now 
I have one parameter (resolution) that I would like to be modifiable by 
the user. My script currently looks as follows:

resolution = 20 val ={'resolution': resolution, 'self': self}

execfile('/path/to/filter.py', val)

Ideally I want my users to not have to replace the 20 by whatever value 
they desire, but instead make a Custom Filter with either a text input 
field or a slider that will pipe its value to the Programmable Filter. 
Is something like this possible at all?

Thanks in advance for your help,
Arno

Hi Cory:

Thanks for the note. I tried putting in and removing the Hide, but it seems
to have nothing to do with the issue. What does seem relevant is that I get
this error when I ask for a contour that isn't feasible, though I'm not
sure why the error comes where it does. Where can I find functions to use
to interrogate the data set -- data types, variables, and ranges?

Thank you,

 -Tom

good news:
programmable source/filter has a property called Parameters that lets you
pass in arbitrary values.
See an example of its use in the standard benchmark here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/
Wrapping/Python/paraview/benchmark/manyspheres.py#L168

bad news:
To my knowledge we have never exposed that property to the end user in the
Qt parts of the GUI. If someone can provide a good example of a qt plugin
or otherwise that exposes parameters to the end user, please advise on this
thread.

You can do what is described in this blog post to package your programmable
source nicely with modifiable attributes. See https://blog.kitware.com/e
asy-customization-of-the-paraview-python-programmable-filter-property-panel/
for details (it is 5 years old, but still applicable to ParaView 5.5).

You may also be interested in this project by Shuhao Wu on GitHub:
https://github.com/shuhaowu/pvpyfilter. I haven't used it yet, but it looks
handy.

Thanks,
Cory

Thomas,

Have a look at the wiki page on Python Scripting in ParaView:
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Search for GetDataInformation if you want to jump right to interrogating
the data set, but the rest of the page is likely of interest as well.

For comprehensive documentation of Python functions, please see
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/index.html.

Cheers,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] swap x and y axes in LineChartView from PlotOverLine

Hi Mathieu,

Perhaps - I believe so.

In the simplest sense, I would like to have my set of vectors displayed 
such that it would be as if the vectors shown in the "orginal..." 
screenshot were reflected across the line y=x. (or in other words to 
have the "axes swapped")

I'm not too sure what the "index" really is, I just mention that I have, 
through trial and error, managed to display *only 1* vector in my 
desired way. That was through manipulating the "use index for XAxis" 
toggle.

Thanks for your reply and I hope that my clarification is helpful.

I'm still pretty limited to using the GUI (I have traced for nice/simple 
macros), and I suspect that this would be a reasonable thing to do maybe 
through the python interface.

I appreciate your advice.

Best,

Sean

Hi Cory,

thanks for that hint on the pvpyfilter. This tool is awesome and does 
exactly what I need it to do.

Cheers,

Hi,

quick question. When I select OSPray for some surfaces in combination of 
Volume Rendering for some Vortex Wake the Rendered vortices just 
dissappear. Is this a bug or am I doing just something wrong.

Thanks in advance,

From this, I have thought about the vtk array.

Dear Users,
I need to solve an eigenproblem in a point of a CFD field.

I imagine that the problem is linked to the vtk array, I need to convert my ?Gradients? matrix in a nparray?
Someone have the same problem?

Hey Andy,

Does the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter produce a tensor from an
input vector field? My testing in ParaView indicates it doesn't , but I'm
not super familiar with it.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView] Problem with saving data from python
Message-ID: <7ad34e4a-df8e-064d-ee27-492767fc7551@mail.ru>

Hi!

I've spent couple of hours but couldn't understand what I do wrong. When 
running following script from console ($ pvpython script.py):

from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

wavelet1 = Wavelet()

clip1 = Clip(Input=wavelet1)
clip1.ClipType = 'Box'
clip1.ClipType.Scale = [0.5, 0.5, 1.0]

SaveData('fuu.vtu', proxy=clip1, CompressorType='ZLib')

UpdatePipeline()

I see the file fuu.vtu but it doesn't contain any data nor mesh. However 
if I do these steps from the GUI then I get correct file.

PV 5.5 for linux64, downloaded from the site. Run on debian testing.

Try inserting a `UpdatePipeline()` after creating the Wavelet but
before the clip. Without that, the clip gets initialized with
incorrect bounds and the box scale factor doesn't get applied
correctly.

Hi Cory

Thank you for that. I'd already been to those two places and not found what
I was asking for there. I see how to get information from my data, and
that's how I know it's a vtkMultiBlockDataSet, but I just don't understand
how to translate what is there to what I need. I want to know what data
values (scalar and vector) are in this dataset, and what their ranges are.
I'm sure I'm just not calling something by the right name, but I'm
wandering up and down the help() data and not really finding anything
relevant.

Thank you,

 -Tom

Hi Andy,

I haven?t verified, but at a glance it looks like what you are passing to the the LA.eig function is not a 2D numpy array. Can you try doing np.asarray(tensors) or 

from vtk.util.numpy_support import vtk_to_numpy
tensors = vtk_to_numpy(tensors)
and then pass that to LA.eig?

Kind regards,

Oscar

Nope, it doesn't help. Seems to me it somehow connected to the fact that 
type of the clip is 'Box'. It it, for example, 'Plane', than saving works.

Ah, the box! The box API needs to cleaned up, I am afriad. Until then,
the following is the way to go.

from paraview.simple import *

w = Wavelet()
UpdatePipeline()
bds = w.GetDataInformation().GetBounds()
c = Clip()
c.ClipType="Box"
c.ClipType.Bounds = bds  #<----- NOTE THIS
c.ClipType.Scale = [0.5, 0.5, 1.0]
SaveData("/tmp/foo.vtu")

Sounds like a bug.

Can you share some data offlist? That will help me isolate and fix.

Rupert,

Let me preface this by saying that the camera animation components are
indeed due a update. They haven't been revisited in a long time and I
am sure they could use a major cleanup. It's good to try to accumulate
issues/ feature requests before we take the plunge so we can come up
with a good solution. Thus, when possible and where it makes sense
please feel free to report issues or feature requests on the issue
tracker. I've started putting together this "master" issue. Feel free
to update or add more.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18125

In general, everything you state are indeed limitations of the current
implementation and not something you missed.

We'd certainly love to see the results you generate when you're done.
It sounds quite cool.

If I add simply the code suggested from you Oscar, my filters becomes:

import numpy as np
from numpy import linalg as LA
from paraview import numpy_support
from vtk.util import numpy_support
input = inputs[0]

numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()
print "number of points",numPoints
#print "keys",input.GetPointData().keys()
tensorsVTK = input.PointData['Gradients']
tensorsNP=numpy_support.vtk_to_numpy(tensorsVTK)
#tensors[0,:,:]=np.diag((1,2,3))
#tensors[0,:,:]=[[1,-1,2],[2,-1,3],[0,0,1]]
print "tensors[0:3]",tensors[0:3]
eigenvalues,eigenvectors = LA.eig(tensorsNP)
print 'eigenvalues', eigenvalues[0]
print 'eigenvectors',eigenvectors[0]
output.PointData.append(eigenvalues,'eigenvalues')
output.PointData.append(eigenvectors,'eigenvectors')


I obtain the following Output:



Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 22, in <module>

File "<string>", line 8, in RequestData

UnboundLocalError: local variable 'NumPy_data' referenced before assignment

typ = vtk_array.GetDataType()

AttributeError: 'VTKCompositeDataArray' object has no attribute 'GetDataType'

number of points 1

I need to reshape the vector or define the type?

Hi Andy,

I haven?t verified, but at a glance it looks like what you are passing to the the LA.eig function is not a 2D numpy array. Can you try doing np.asarray(tensors) or


from vtk.util.numpy_support import vtk_to_numpy

tensors = vtk_to_numpy(tensors)
and then pass that to LA.eig?

Kind regards,

Oscar

Subject: [Paraview] Single point with different values
Message-ID: <0caa0ef5-c241-91eb-3c1b-929680934a73@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am visualizing a .vtu file and I noticed that one of the points from 
the mesh (visualize the data with the "Surface with edges" option") has 
different values for the same variable. When visualizing the variable it 
shows that, this specific variable has a value of 0.667, however, when 
using the hover points over tool, it shows that the variable has another 
different value, 1.107. Using spreadsheet view, I could locate the first 
value and its associate Point ID. Then I located the second value, the 
one from the hover tool, and it has a different Point ID. Both 
coordinates are the same for both points ID.

My question is, is that a problem from paraview which uses two points 
for the same coordinates or is that a problem from the solver I used to 
compute the solution?
My main concernis that maybe I am visualizing wrong results, it is 
showing the first value and it should be showing the second instead.

I use Point Data for that specific variable. Paraview version 5.0.1. 
Ubuntu OS.

I do not attach the file because it is 9Mb size, but if you need, please 
let me know.

Thank you very much for your help.

Cheers,
Guillermo Suarez

ParaView doesn't have enforce any restrictions on duplicate points. So you
should check with your solver to see if this was intended or an error.

In ParaView, Filters->Clean To Grid merges such duplicate points together.

Hello list,

We talked about it and the issue is that the path tracer option does not
yet support volume rendering. Likewise the scivis renderer does not yet
support the new materials or lights.

bug reports are filed https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues/17290 and
17291.

The Gradient of Unstructured Dataset does increase the tensor dimension. So
a scalar, or 1 component array in VTK/PV, becomes a vector, or a 3
components array. Similarly, a vector becomes a 2nd order tensor, or 9
component array.

Andrea: could you try upgrading to ParaView 5.5 (available at
paraview.org/download) ? Some of the numpy support has been improved since
5.3. I tried your original Programmable Filter script and I got an
eigenvectors and eigenvalues array:

*import* *numpy* *as* *np*

*from* *numpy* *import* linalg *as* LA

*from* *paraview* *import* numpy_support

input = inputs[0]



numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()

*print* "number of points",numPoints

tensors = input.PointData['Gradients']

*print* "tensors[0:3]",tensors[0:3]

eigenvalues,eigenvectors = LA.eig(tensors)

*print* 'eigenvalues', eigenvalues[0]

*print* 'eigenvectors',eigenvectors[0]

output.PointData.append(eigenvalues,'eigenvalues')

output.PointData.append(eigenvectors,'eigenvectors')


Once you get PV 5.5, you can try loading the attached eigen.pvsm state file
which worked for me if you want to test it out. Note that since I used the
Gradient of Unstructured Dataset filter twice to go from a scalar array to
a second order tensor before doing the programmable filter, I used
Gradients2 for the output array name for the second order tensor.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Stacking two arrays to define geometry causes warning
Message-ID: <CAD0qPxTgu6V+1OhMufq7O3n_Og-FjROk8CVpcEng6ULumZmFOw@mail.gmail.com>

Within XDMF, I'm using a join function to plot a line between my master and
slave nodes. I explicitly write the topology piece. Everything seems to
work fine, but it throws the following error every time....

ERROR: In /home/shelf1/hpc_shared/motorsports/software/

caching possible

Given that everything seems to function the way it's supposed, is this a
bug in the error checking?

The join piece of the xml is below:

Message-ID: <CAE=GJrZ4meiggW_M+gBknPJCv5Xuo5T=kgh_w0fdp5DEwhq3EA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have some questions about serial and parallel data.

I'm working at a HPC facility but all my scientific data was previously
written in serial .VTK extension.

*What's the best way to turn my serial data into parallel?*

I have found that I can open the ParaView client application and connect to
my localhost with at least 2 processes, open my serial data and save it as
parallel data.

*Is that effective? Is that the right way to do?*

*Or I would only benefit of parallel processing if I wrote my data as
parallel from the beggining?*

The options presented when saving data:

- Data Mode: ASCII | BINARY | APPENDED
- Encode Appended Data: TRUE | FALSE
- Compressor Type:  NONE | ZLIB

*What do the mean and how they affect performance?*

*If I save my serial data as parallel data using 2 processes, is that the
same as saving my data with N number of processes?*

Subject: [Paraview] Scaling axis and collating inputs
Message-ID: <CABaWRZaeAnMU=BtAFkibEPf1sWuwnA9RviEYpabG9BOZihsWyw@mail.gmail.com>

First question, is is possible to scale values, either domain and/or range,
directly within paraview? Ideally there would be a way to apply a function
to the domain value for each axis independently. Hence one could handle
extreme disparities in range (i.e. latitude, longitude and elevation).

Second, is it possible to direct the data values from several files and
plot them together on a histogram using different colors to indicate from
which source the data was sourced?

Finally, given an unstructured set of points, plot the points in 3 space
with a label which is either the index within the file, or a text label
from the file.

thanks for any help,

-eric

These determine how the binary data (your arrays, point coordinates etc) is
saved in the file. ASCII is not to be used to anything but small dataset
for debugging. BINARY saves the data as binary, however it still needs to
encode it (using base64) so that the XML can be parsed correctly.
Generally, you want to pick APPENDED (where the binary data is added at the
end of the XML header(ish) and then can be saved as raw binary dump without
any encoding. No encoding implies you can't easily look at the file in a
ASCII text editor, but will be easier to write and read since neither needs
to do any processing to convert the binary data. For appended APPENDED or
BINARY mode, compressor type allows you to pick a compression technique to
use. This minimizes file size but adds computing cost of compressing
/decompressing. It's a trade off between reading more from  the disk or
spending more time decompressing it after reading form disk. Generally,
reading form disk is slower, so you may still be better off compressing.
5.5 offer better compression options like LZ4 & LZMA which may be worth
exploring too.

Before I answer your other questions, what type of data is this? Image
data? Unstructured grid? When you load it on 2 ranks, if you color your
surface by vtkProcessId, is it being read in as paritioned across two ranks
or all of the data is on rank 0?

Hi Utkarsh, thank you for the detailed explanation =)

I will definitely try out and see the different performances with
compressed/decompressed data.

The data types are *Structured Grid*, *Structured Points *and* Rectilinear
Grid. *All of them are written in VTK 2.0 version.

When loading in 2 ranks the data is loaded only in 1 rank (ID 0)
consequently having only one color.

Message-ID: <CABrYh3qg9RqXNH3csj79H+WmQ79sa+FdbTq+eXr_4LNSXKHkMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

Using pvpython, I want to find all the variables, their types, and ranges
in a vtkMultiBlockDataSet. I've read the file in successfully and made lots
of cool visualizations from it, but I'm doing it by examining the file in
Paraview and using the strings and data values I find there to create
python functions to make contours and streamlines and so on.

Cory pointed me to the GetDataInformation method, and that's a start, but I
am not seeing how to get what I need from that, though that's how I learned
I have a vtkMultiBlockDataSet. I'm sure this is obvious but I'm also sure
that I can't seem to see how to do it. Any suggestions?

Many thanks,

 -Tom

Hi Sean,

What your are trying to achieve is not possible with ParaView, since it
would requires you to display multiples "X arrays" for a single "Y Arrays"
and this is not something the Line Chart View can do, even with python
scripting.
It may be possible to implement in VTK directly, but this would be a non
trivial work and require C++ skills.

Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Subject: [Paraview] Periodic Mesh for Particle Tracking
Message-ID: <f73d85be-2d72-dc57-f773-3a7a150e0e0a@imperial.ac.uk>

Hello,

I've taken a look back through this mailing list and it seems as though 
someone was trying to implement periodic boundaries in particle tracking 
before (back in 2013). The previous advice was that it wasn't something 
available directly in Paraview, rather it needed to be implemented in VTK.

I'd be interested in going down this route if it is indeed the only way, 
I'd welcome any guidance or pointers.

My situation is that I have labeled boundaries that I can extract with a 
extract surface -> threshold, and I want to track my particles as they 
leave one edge and reappear on the other edge (the mesh points on one 
boundary line up with those on the other boundary).

Many thanks,

Doug Addy

Hi,

I would like to use Threshold filter for Vorticity field calculated by 
ComputeDreivatives but in the variables list i could not see Vorticity 
field. So, is it possible to do it with any other way such as 
programmable filter etc. If i extract it from the whole data, then, i 
would like to follow it to create polyline that represent path of the 
selected region. So, is there any simple way to do that?

Leo,

Let's take 1 dataset type/reader type at a time. I am using 5.5 for all
this discussion, just for simplicity.


*1. Structured Grid (*.vts file)*
In this case, the reader supports reading parts of the file on different
ranks, thus even if you have single file, the reader does read sub-extents
on each of the ranks. As an example, I simply loaded the multicomb_0.vts
<https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5ad9fa0f8d777f0685794b15/download> on
multiple ranks, and I see it's indeed split among ranks.


In this case, I believe non-compressed binary file format will be best
since each rank can just read subset of the data its reading. For
compressed formats, you'd need to read the the whole array for
decompression. Having the data in pvts file with separate paritions does
have the benefit of avoiding I/O contention since all ranks won't be
opening the same files. So, I'd suggest experimenting for your intended
scale.

*2. Image Data (*.vti file)*

You refer to structured points. I am not entirely sure of the lineage of
structured points, but looking at the docs seems it's simply a subclass of
vtkImageData, so I'll assume it's indeed that. The same is true for vti
files as vts files. The reader reads subextents on ranks, even if the file
is not split.

*3. Rectilinear Grid (*.vtr file)*

Same is true for vtr files
<https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5ad9fccc8d777f0685794b18/download>
too. The reader can read sub-extents.


Hope that helps.

for debugging. BINARY saves the data as binary, however it still needs to
encode it (using base64) so that the XML can be parsed correctly.
Generally, you want to pick APPENDED (where the binary data is added at the
end of the XML header(ish) and then can be saved as raw binary dump without
any encoding. No encoding implies you can't easily look at the file in a
ASCII text editor, but will be easier to write and read since neither needs
to do any processing to convert the binary data. For appended APPENDED or
BINARY mode, compressor type allows you to pick a compression technique to
use. This minimizes file size but adds computing cost of compressing
/decompressing. It's a trade off between reading more from  the disk or
spending more time decompressing it after reading form disk. Generally,
reading form disk is slower, so you may still be better off compressing.
5.5 offer better compression options like LZ4 & LZMA which may be worth
exploring too.

Hi Erik,

To answer your first question, I have had success in the past using the ?Calculator? Filter, which you can use to calculate a new value based on a function of the coordinates and/or values of your domain. You can find that filter in ParaView 5.5.0 under ?Filters -> Data Analysis -> Calculator.

Sometimes it?s enough to change the color scale so that it?s something other than a linear range, I think logarithmic scale is supported out of the box (ie. There is a checkbox under ?rescale to custom data range?)

If you want to physically ?move? the data based on some scale (e.g. deformation), then you probably want to use the Transform filter, which for me is just on the toolbar.


I can?t help you with the second and third questions, and I hope others will be able to help.

Subject: [Paraview] Scaling axis and collating inputs

First question, is is possible to scale values, either domain and/or range, directly within paraview? Ideally there would be a way to apply a function to the domain value for each axis independently. Hence one could handle extreme disparities in range (i.e. latitude, longitude and elevation).
Second, is it possible to direct the data values from several files and plot them together on a histogram using different colors to indicate from which source the data was sourced?
Finally, given an unstructured set of points, plot the points in 3 space with a label which is either the index within the file, or a text label from the file.
thanks for any help,
-eric

I could have vorticty as a new variable by using PythonCalculator. now, i need to follow points extracted from vorticity field in time and create poly line. so, I tried particle tracer and particle path bu no luck yet!

Hi,

I would like to use Threshold filter for Vorticity field calculated by 
ComputeDreivatives but in the variables list i could not see Vorticity 
field. So, is it possible to do it with any other way such as 
programmable filter etc. If i extract it from the whole data, then, i 
would like to follow it to create polyline that represent path of the 
selected region. So, is there any simple way to do that?

Best Regards,

--ufuk

Thanks again, Utkarsh!

I believe I understand the difference now.

This is not happening for me because all my file are simple legacy .VTK
files. Right?

XML formatted files have this capacity even though they are not *.P + (VTS,
VTI, VTR)*

1. How to transform my simple legacy VTK files in XML file format? Only
rewriting them from the begginning?

2. Any thoughts on XML written files versus .PVTK generated by ParaView
when saving data?

Now it works,
Maybe was a problem about the treatment of the vectors or the numpy library.

Thanks for the support,
Andrea

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Problem with numpy array

The Gradient of Unstructured Dataset does increase the tensor dimension. So a scalar, or 1 component array in VTK/PV, becomes a vector, or a 3 components array. Similarly, a vector becomes a 2nd order tensor, or 9 component array.
Andrea: could you try upgrading to ParaView 5.5 (available at paraview.org/download<http://paraview.org/download>) ? Some of the numpy support has been improved since 5.3. I tried your original Programmable Filter script and I got an eigenvectors and eigenvalues array:
import numpy as np
from numpy import linalg as LA
from paraview import numpy_support
input = inputs[0]

numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()
print "number of points",numPoints
tensors = input.PointData['Gradients']
print "tensors[0:3]",tensors[0:3]
eigenvalues,eigenvectors = LA.eig(tensors)
print 'eigenvalues', eigenvalues[0]
print 'eigenvectors',eigenvectors[0]
output.PointData.append(eigenvalues,'eigenvalues')
output.PointData.append(eigenvectors,'eigenvectors')

Once you get PV 5.5, you can try loading the attached eigen.pvsm state file which worked for me if you want to test it out. Note that since I used the Gradient of Unstructured Dataset filter twice to go from a scalar array to a second order tensor before doing the programmable filter, I used Gradients2 for the output array name for the second order tensor.
Best,
Andy

Hi Andy,

I haven?t verified, but at a glance it looks like what you are passing to the the LA.eig function is not a 2D numpy array. Can you try doing np.asarray(tensors) or


from vtk.util.numpy_support import vtk_to_numpy

tensors = vtk_to_numpy(tensors)
and then pass that to LA.eig?

Kind regards,

Oscar

Hey Andy,

Does the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter produce a tensor from an input vector field? My testing in ParaView indicates it doesn't , but I'm not super familiar with it.

I imagine that the problem is linked to the vtk array, I need to convert my ?Gradients? matrix in a nparray?
Someone have the same problem?

Message-ID: <17954FF4A6EDC447B60CEFADD6DCAE93027759F7@GSVCLU05.ges.ferlan.it>

Dear users,
I need to clip a domain with a close surface.
More in details I have a cfd domain with pressure and velocity field, I import a table of point and I create a closed surface using delunay3d filters.
At this stage, I would clip the computational domain using the close surface dividing the cfd domain or in the internal part of the close surface or in the external part.

I have tried using clip with scalars, but I am not able to understand how use it properly.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Andrea

For structured datasets, yes. Note, there's still a tradeoff. With the
p* versions where you're presplitting the files, all ranks need not
open the same files and as a result will encounter less contention of
parallel file systems, than if you use a the non-p versions which save
everything in a single file. Whether the work of splitting is worth it
depends on how the data was generated in the first place and then how
many ranks/nodes you're planning to run this on. So I'd recommend
doing some testing on your target platform and then adopt one or the
other approach.

> 1. How to transform my simple legacy VTK files in XML file format? Only rewriting them from the begginning?

You can simply load it in ParaView or VTK and save it out as one the XML files.

> 2. Any thoughts on XML written files versus .PVTK generated by ParaView when saving data?

I am not sure what you mean. Can you elaborate? If you're referring to
tradeoff between .p* and non-p versions of the XML files then see the
note earlier.

Thanks, Mark/Christoph. I think I know what's causing the VTKm version issue.

Can you try the attached patches? The VTKm one has to be applied under
ParaView/VTK/ThirdParty/vtkm/vtk-m/.

A workaround to overcome this bug is to add
`-DVTKm_GIT_DESCRIBE=1.1.0` to cmake options.

Hi Ufuk,

The threshold filter operates on scalar/single component arrays only. Also,
underneath the covers it operates on cell data exclusively so if you
request thresholding on point data it will do a point data to cell data
operation as well.

I'm not aware of any filters in PV that would allow you to track a
thresholded quantity. Unfortunately I can't think of any moderately easy
way to do this in PV either.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Animation question
Message-ID: <CABe2z9cyfHtX5KA19fxEQompYuhkxHJviViEyg9epMKGkF4XTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

i have a question regarding animation in paraview. The software that i
utilize to do simulations permits to change the frequency writing of the
frames, if i have many frames the files becomes bigger and the contrary if
i have less frames. What i want to know is if paraview in the case that i
have less frames can create a smooth animation of the simulation? Will it
automatically dividethe length of the animation and produce a smooth
animation?

Thank you in advance,
Salachoris Georgios Panagiotis

Hello Georgios,

This may depend on the format you are using but ParaView support
timestamps, which means you can have any kind of time resolution if you
know when you want to display the timestep.
The time interpolator may also help you if you have smoothness problems.

Best,


Mathieu Westphal

Thanks, Mathieu.

That's too bad. I was hoping that since it is purely a display issue, 
there might have been a way to transpose vectors. While I do have C++ 
skills, I do not have the inclination to get into the VTK.

Hi Utkarsh,
thanks for the patches! They seem to work, the CMake configuration
problems are gone, including the ugly CMake warnings.

Now I run again into the linker bug I mentioned last week.

Unfortunately, plots are notoriously hard to get right. Partly, the
default settings of programs like gnuplot or Excel are to blame for
this since these programs make it very convenient to create bad plots.

Subject: [Paraview] Tensor from variables
Message-ID: <a270587d-d4b6-8c66-5b86-4545f002743c@unimelb.edu.au>

Hi,

I have a stress field saved as a h5 file that I read using an xdmf file.
The stress is defined as a symmetric tensor XX, YY, XZ and in so is interpreted as a vector with X, Y, Z components.

I would like to visualize the tensors using paraview TensorGlyphs which expects a symmetric tensor with the order XX. YY, ZZ, XY, YZ, XZ.

I tried to apply a programmable to my dataset but without luck...

Here is what I have done:

import numpy as np




data = np.zeros((inputs[0].PointData["projStressField"][0].size, 6))




data[:,0] = inputs[0].PointData["projStressField"][0] # XX

data[:,1] = inputs[0].PointData["projStressField"][1] # YY

data[:,3] = inputs[0].PointData["projStressField"][2] # XY







output.PointData.append(data, "Stress Tensor")




I suspect the shape of my numpy array is wrong... I do get a new variable called "Stress Tensor" but it has components 1..17...






I had a look at https://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2017-November/041497.html
did not really helped...

Message-ID: <bb83065b-6b31-4d6c-4469-2050636323d2@iag.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hi guys,

first of all thanks for all your effort and work on Paraview. 
Nevertheless, when it comes to publication, especially of 3D plots with 
3D axes grid I am really missing some nice looking 3D axes or colormap 
annotations. At the moment I am creating a png without axes, loading 
this into python-matplotlib and plotting the data here again. Since I 
want to avoid this workaround, is there a way or programmable filter to 
get the data from an actual 3D plot and the x,y,z limits and plot the 
axes with matplotlib backend directly in 3D in the Render View itself?

Any hint is appreciated,

Thanks in advance,

Thanks Andy. I could try to implement a Programmable filter because even 
if i able to use Threshold filter it is hard to track multiple region 
produced by Threshold filter separately.

Guys,

I just need a concept here.  I have been asked to estimate what it would take to add a GUI to Paraview that would duplicate what we do with an old custom GUI in a competitor product (so we can get rid of the $$$ competitor!).

Basically, I want to enable a mode where I select an element(s) in Paraview and that goes off and makes some plots based on which element I selected.    I don't know how to intercept the action of selecting an element.    Can I do this in some clever way from a Programmable Filter?    Do we need to write a GUI in C++ and compile it in to enable this?

Any ideas?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

I'm currently doing something very clost for someone who wants an easier
interface more tuned to the exact needs of the engineers who will be using
it as a production system. We're using pvpython to substitute for paraview
and doing the GUI development as a paraviewweb application. It seems to be
going ok, though my traffic on this list has shown a few of the bumps I've
encountered. I think you have pretty much all the capacity of paraview in
pvpython, though I don't know how you would go about selecting an element.
But if all you want is a concept to explore, there's one.

Hi Dennis,

If you can work with a compiled version of ParaView, this is a perfect job
for a ParView C++ plugin.
There multiples examples in paraview/Examples/Plugin and some docs here :
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo

Also, it is definitelly not possible to do that in a programmable filter.

Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Doing that via a C++-based plugin would be  my preferred approach. You
definitely can't do it via programmable filter, but a client-side
Python script (one that's run in Python shell) is a possibility but
depends on the exact scenario as everything is not necessarily
achievable via Python exposed components.

Alas, no. It's not possible to combine rendering from ParaView with
images from rendering from matplotlib in the same view easily.

Can you identify cases for fixes/improvements with ParaVIew's
axes/legends? We'd sure like to keep improving them so you don't have
to keep using the workaround. Feel free to report issues or post cases
that highlight the differences on the mailing list itself, and we can
consolidate them into issues.

Thanks

Nobody has had to face this problem in the past? Is it an impassable obstacle to paraview at the moment?

Dear users,
I need to clip a domain with a close surface.
More in details I have a cfd domain with pressure and velocity field, I import a table of point and I create a closed surface using delunay3d filters.
At this stage, I would clip the computational domain using the close surface dividing the cfd domain or in the internal part of the close surface or in the external part.

I have tried using clip with scalars, but I am not able to understand how use it properly.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Andrea

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Time scale
Message-ID: <CAKc83Ar-588xjH26N9CgePYdGox5DeM_KQicOjDQakNNLnyKuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone
I am using Paraview for post-processing data of an OpenFOAM solver. I have
some questions regarding the time units that are shown in Paraview.
These are my parameters for time control:
- Start Time: 0
- Time Step: 400
- End Time: 4000000
- Write Interval: 4000
Each time frame of Paraview, with these controls, represent what time? For
example, time frame 100 in the Paraview time field options.

Thank you for your attention!

Sincerely,
Jo?o Gil

Hi Mathieu,

Sorry for the late reply. Just now I had time to put together a short
example to reproduce the problem (see attachment).

I am running ParaView-5.4.1 on  Debian 9. I am using mpiexec and pvbatch
that come together with ParaView.
My shell command for running the script is: /opt/ParaView-5.4.1/bin/mpiexec
-np 4 pvbatch example.py

I attach a simple python script (example.py) for debugging purposes. Here I
basically create two boxes with same center but one has twice the length of
the other.
If you run this code with one processor you should see that the output
(example.png) displays two concentric boxes. Increasing the processor count
(anything >1)
seems to cause the center of one of the boxes to be misplaced.

This problem only appears when the boxCenter is something different than
[0.,0.,0.]. Modifying line 8 of the attached script and setting boxCenter
to [0.,0.,0.] results in
correct behavior.

Kind Regards,
Tiago

Hi Andrea,

This is achievable using a Programmable Filter, with the following script :

inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )

inpCut = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )

out = self.GetOutput()


cutter = vtk.vtkCutter()

cutter.SetInputDataObject( inpMain )

cutFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()

cutFunction.SetInput( inpCut )

cutter.SetCutFunction( cutFunction )

cutter.Update()


outData = cutter.GetOutputDataObject( 0 )

out.DeepCopy(outData)

(thanks @Yves Roger for providing it here :
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-April/033903.html)

In case you do not know how to use the programmable filter in this
case, I have included a StateFile that demonstrate it.
Notice that we are using an "output data type : vtkPolyData".

Best regards,



Mathieu Westphal

Thank you Mathieu for your answer,
When I tries your filter I obtain ?an intersection? between the sphere and my domain.
While the result that I would get is a clipped domain, I have included a Statefile for demonstration on what I would get.
Maybe I'm using your filter in a wrong way?

Andrea

Dear users,
I need to clip a domain with a close surface.
More in details I have a cfd domain with pressure and velocity field, I import a table of point and I create a closed surface using delunay3d filters.
At this stage, I would clip the computational domain using the close surface dividing the cfd domain or in the internal part of the close surface or in the external part.

I have tried using clip with scalars, but I am not able to understand how use it properly.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Andrea

Subject: [Paraview] Read a custom point stored in ply file
Message-ID: <CAL6eTbEMk9F5F3n4EcvhCtzpshh6fyBec283qzSwM=S1ho8yfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

The intention of this e-mail is to continue the discussion that I have with
Mathieu Westphal in stackoverflow.

The starting point of the problem was I wanted to process a .plc file in
paraview. Matthew told me that at this moment this was not possible and I
needed to convert my plc, file to ply. When I done the conversion, paraview
was not able to understand my file due to PLC that it generated a ply file
without cells.

To solve that Andrew proposes to me to use the following python
programmable filter:

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)
numPts = pdo.GetNumberOfPoints()
ids=vtk.vtkIdList()
ids.SetNumberOfIds(numPts)
for i in range(0, numPts):
  ids.SetId(i, i)
pdo.Allocate(1)
pdo.InsertNextCell(2, ids)

That solves my issue and I was able to saw my  rgb point cloud. Now the
problem that I have is the following.

I have stored in a ply file the following information: X Y Z VX VY VZ and I
would like to use vx, vy and vz to display some arrows.

The thing is when paraview reads this new ply file with a custom point the
vx, vy and vz is not recognized.

Thanks,

Albert

I'm a little unclear - are these OpenFOAM time parameters? It looks like it
will produce 4,000,000 / 4,000 = 1,000 time steps?

Time 100 corresponds to the 100th output time step, which would be 100 *
4,000 = 400,000 in whatever the OpenFOAM time units are (seconds?).

I'm not that familiar with OpenFOAM data sets, but my understanding is that
time information is embedded in the output case directory structure.
ParaView should display the time in the "Time:" display in the topmost
toolbar next to the time frame control, which should show 100.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Albert,

Looking at the PLY reader in VTK, it looks like it doesn't support
custom point fields. I've reported an issue here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18136

If your data is just a collection of points with fields, a simple CSV
maybe be easier than PLY.  After opening a CSV, you can use the "Table
To Points" to interpret the rows as points with fields associated with
them.

Also, what does a PLC format look like? It may be possible to use a
Python programmable filter to directly reader in the PLC without any
conversion if the format is simple.

Andrea,

If you have (1)? a 3-D datum set that is displayable in Paraview, and if 
you have (2) a separate closed 3-D surface mesh that is within your 3-D 
datum set, that is, encloses a sub-domain of your 3-D datum set, then 
the PV filter 'Resample With Dataset' is likely to give you what you are 
looking for.

In fact I am working like this at this moment. I would like to move to ply
files but if at this moment is not possible I will wait.

Sorry I wrote wrong the format is not plc is pcd.  I think is very similar
to ply http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php.
In my case insted of X Y Z RGB I will have X Y Z DX DY DZ fields.

The motivation of the change to ply or pcd is because ply or pcd have a bin
version of the files and I am looking for a standard bin file that paraview
can manage. Can you recommend me any binary file that paraview can manage
without issues with custom parameters like on my case?

Thanks,

Albert

Hi Utkarsh,

I forgot something in my last e-mail, sorry. Maybe if a revision of the ply
reader is needed we can add to the issue that at this moment paraview is
not able to read a ply without cells. For instance the file attached in the
Mathieu's e-mail. It is a file that contains xyz and rgb information. This
file is possible to read in meshlab without any pre-processed but not in
paraview (I need to add the filter provided by Mathieu). I do not know if
this is  complex. What do you think?

Thanks,

Albert

Albert,

Can you attach an example? Also, do you mean it fails to read entirely
or just doesn't render anything? If it's the latter, try using the
"Point Gaussian" representation, instead of the default "Surface"
representation. That renders points without the need for any cell
information.

Hi Andrea,
Here is an updated script to clip instead of cutting.
You will recover the volume of your main dataset which is inside the provided surface.
(if your are interested by what is outside, just change the InsideOut value)

import vtk.vtkPVVTKExtensionsDefault as ext



inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )

inpClip = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )

out = self.GetOutput()



clipper = ext.vtkPVMetaClipDataSet()

clipper.SetInputDataObject(inpMain)

clipper.SetInsideOut(True)

clipFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()

clipFunction.SetInput(inpClip)

clipper.SetClipFunction(clipFunction)

clipper.Update()



outData = clipper.GetOutputDataObject(0)

out.DeepCopy(outData)

I've included the state file and a dataset to test with. make sure to set the path to the dataset when loading the state file.
You may also want to take a look into the resample with dataset solution.
Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Hi Andrea,
This is achievable using a Programmable Filter, with the following script :

inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )

inpCut = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )

out = self.GetOutput()



cutter = vtk.vtkCutter()

cutter.SetInputDataObject( inpMain )

cutFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()

cutFunction.SetInput( inpCut )

cutter.SetCutFunction( cutFunction )

cutter.Update()



outData = cutter.GetOutputDataObject( 0 )

out.DeepCopy(outData)

(thanks @Yves Roger for providing it here :  https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-April/033903.html)

In case you do not know how to use the programmable filter in this case, I have included a StateFile that demonstrate it.
Notice that we are using an "output data type : vtkPolyData".

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Clip a domain using a close surface

Dear users,
I need to clip a domain with a close surface.
More in details I have a cfd domain with pressure and velocity field, I import a table of point and I create a closed surface using delunay3d filters.
At this stage, I would clip the computational domain using the close surface dividing the cfd domain or in the internal part of the close surface or in the external part.

I have tried using clip with scalars, but I am not able to understand how use it properly.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Andrea

Subject: [Paraview] Selecting points from mesh in PARAVIEW using pvpython
Message-ID: <20180426091934.195027sx91vaci9y@webmail.ens-cachan.fr>

Hello,

I am working to make a selection of points from a unstructured grid  
(associated to a .xmf file) in Paraview  to carry out a FFT of them  
later on. Doing this by using the GUI of Paraview is fairly   
straightforward since there are several options to select these  
points. However, I need to this by coding it from the python shell  
option.

I have already looked several books, presentations and help online  
without finding an example or a specific explanation about how to code  
the selection of  points by using python.

I would really appreciate your help regarding this subject,

Regards,

Juan

Hi Juan,

What about the python code that's automatically generated using the 'trace'
option?

Kind Regards,
Tiago

Hi Tiago,

Only the outline of the box seems to be incorrect, not the actual geometry.
This is a small graphical artefact bug, but nothing they would prevent you
to do any computation with the boxes.

You can switch to surface representation to see that the boxes are
correctly placed.
SetRepresentationType('Surface')

Feel free to open a bug for the outline bug on
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/new

Best regards,

Dear whom it may concern,

I'm having .h5 files for my simulations. I'm wondering if there are easy ways to convert those .h5 files to something that Paraview could read and what are types of files that are allowed on Paraview.

Sincerely,

Juan,

Doing programmable selections is not well supported in Python presently.
There will hopefully be future developments towards this in the near term.

For now, you can do something like:

from paraview import vtk

source = GetActiveSource()

idss = IDSelectionSource(IDs=[0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4], FieldType=vtk.
vtkSelectionNode.POINT)

ex = ExtractSelection(Input=source, Selection=idss)

Show(ex)

This will select points 2, 3, and 4 from the currently selected data
source. Note that the list of IDs have the order [processor ID, point/cell
ID, processor ID, point/cell ID, ...].

You can find documentation on additional selection types at
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.servermanager_proxies.html

HTH,
Cory

Hi all,

I would like to know if its possible to create a custom filter without an
input.

In fact, I would like to use a data source followed by some filters and
then to group all these actions (including the data source) in a single
Custom Filter. However Paraview crashes when I click on the "finish" button
during the set-up procedure.

Thanks in advance !

I fail to reproduce with a single source in a custom filter.
Could you please precise which version of ParaView you are using and which
filter you are putting in a custom filter ?

Thanks,

Hi,

It's called Salvus. It's a software for Seismology. They have a command that: ! python ./petsc_gen_xdmf.py name_of_your_file.h5

and it should convert .h5 file to .xdmf but it doesn't work. I was wondering if there are any converters out there or any codes that I could run on python?

Cheers,
Phuripan

Dear Phuripan,

ParaView support some hdf5 based format already, so you may want to try that first, i've included a list a .h5 based format supported by ParaView natively.
TRUCHAS dataset
PDAL Files
Chombo Files
GTC Files
UNIC Files
VizSchema Files
H5Nimrod Files
Multilevel 3D Plasma Files
PFLOTRAN Files
Pixie Files
Tetrad Files

Please note that we also support Xdmf, H5Part and Enzo HDF5 format wich are using hdf5 as well.

Typically an .xdmf file is an _additional_ file to the .h5 file and it does not replace the .h5 file. Does the python command generate a .xdmf or .xmf file after it completes?

Hi Phuripan,

HDF5 is not a file format in itself, only Salvus tools will be able to
manipulate it.
If you are not able to use the script, you should ask Salvus community for
help.

Message-ID: <e0542b26f71d4e65995b272898f811fa@Lizherel.cstb.local>

Hello,
Is it possible to include Not a Number values in the legacy vtk file format ?
I have tried and I get length mismatch errors on import.  I am using Polydata - Cell data - Scalars - Float, writing the data from a Python script in a different application.
If not, would it be possible to write a custom import filter for this?  Any suggestions on how to start? Or another workaround?
Thanks!

Hi Graham,

Legacy .vtk file do handle correctly NaN values.
Attached is a .vtk file that contains NaN values and can be opened and
visualized without issues in ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter - Reading a vtkUnstructuredGrid in
 the Python script
Message-ID: <CAGqynaBVPzVyghH7BmGR+UQoHDp+Xau9Gx7dYcUpfA0-+FVjrw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

New to the mailing, and first question for me: hi everyone !
I'm using the 5.4 binary version of Paraview available online, I'm not
compiling my own version.
I'm trying to encapsulate an exe program in a programmable filter ; based
on the programmable filter inputs and parameters, I run this program in the
embedded python script ; the program writes a vtkUnstructuredGrid in the
working folder. Now I want to read this vtk object and give the result as
output of the programmable filter.
I have noticed that vtkUnstructuredGridReader is not available in the vtk
library that is only accessible through the embedded python script.
Do you know any other way to read a vtkUnstructuredGrid, or any vtkObject,
in a programmable source/filter, than coding my own reader ?

Many thanks,
Ga?l

Dear Ga?l

In order to acess vtk*XML*UnstructuredGridReader in the python Script of a
Programmable Filter/Source you need to do the following :

import vtk.vtkIOXML as ext

reader = ext.vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader()



If you actually need the vtkUnstructuredGridReader in the python Script of
a Programmable Filter/Source you need to do the following :

import vtk.vtkIOLegacy as ext

reader = ext.vtkUnstructuredGridReader()


Best regards,

Hello,

It is on Paraview 5.4.0 and it happens also on 5.5.0

I have attached a very simple pvsm file with a programmable source followed
by a filter. When I try to create a single Custom Filter containing this 2
operations (the source+the filter), it crashes. Sometimes it does not
crashes but the new custom filter is not available on the filter
alphabetical list. Does the Custom Filter accepts a programmable source as
input ?

Thanks in advance

PS : i have created several other custom filters but i have to load them
every time I open a session. is it possible to make an autoload ?
(something like the autoload of the plugins)

Miguel

I didn't a test and I'm surprised that Paraview cannot do volume 
rendering on rectilinear data. Can someone confirm it or I made a mistake?

You are correct it will not directly volume render vtkRectilinearGrids.

Use threshold filter (all values) to map to a vtkUnstructuredGrid for
direct rendering but at a cost of memory explosion.
Apply the resample to image filter to map to vtkImageData for fast volume
rendering, but at a cost of trading off precision for memory size.

Not that I know of.

We are more likely to make the conversion to image based volume rendering
automatic, faster and more precise.

Hi David,

Thanks for confirming it. Does Kitware have a plan to implement volume 
rendering for rectilinear volume? You see the spectrum from 
vtkImageData, to vtkRectilinearGrid, vtkStructuredGrid --- volume 
rendering is implemented on both ends but not for the middle one, which 
is a bit odd to the user.

Best,
Weiguang

I am not aware of any plans for  volume rendering for rectilinear volume
but as I David mentioned, sampling it to the image space is what we have
discussed / talked about.

Resampling it into vtkImageData is what I want to take in the current 
circumstance. Thank you both. Have a great weekend!

All,

If I wanted to run atan2(X,Y) on millions and millions of nodes to calculate cylindrical coordinates, but found that numpy.atan2 in a Programmable Filter was taking 45 minutes to run,   what should I do to make it much faster?

Thanks for any hints

Are there places on the cylinder you are calling atan2 with the same inputs, returning the same data, lots of times?  Alternatively, could you calculate this in the simulation, and just add it to the simulation output?  I am speculating that a C++ call to atan2 may be faster than numpy?

Alan,

Yes, I am calling it many times at the same angular location, but it's tough to know you're at the same angular location without calculating the angle.

Also, C++ is definitely orders of magnitude quicker, but once I have to compile routines into Paravew life gets very complicated.   We barely survived compiling for cluster use and I haven't written C++ for at least 20 years.

So, if possible, I would like a clever external add-on that wouldn't require us to re-compile PV everytime we update our version.   I have visions of library errors in my nightmares!

Hi Dennis,

You can calculate cylindrical coordinates by utilizing
vtkCylindricalTransform within the python programmable filter. It is
something like below and faster than numpy.

---
import vtk

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()

transform = vtk.vtkCylindricalTransform()

transformFilter = vtk.vtkTransformFilter()
transformFilter.SetInputData(input)
transformFilter.SetTransform(transform.GetInverse())
transformFilter.Update()

output.ShallowCopy(transformFilter.GetOutput())
---

This converts (x,y,z) coordinates to (r,theta,z) coordinates by GetInverse
method,
where the angles are calculated by the following equation to change range
to [0, 2*pi]:
  theta = pi + atan2(-y, -x).

Message-ID: <CABaWRZZuROBk=oL49K5GeNr0r4_t7fu4S_o+qn7sE1_8d0dcBA@mail.gmail.com>

OK, a little embarrassing to ask, but the answer is needed. I'm trying to
do old fashioned, 2D plots. Data is (x,y,z) and even though its in an ascii
csv file, the (x,y) are structured rectilinear (uniform actually). I've
added a dummy third coord (all 0s) and then plotted as 3D, but this seems
like a kludge.

I'd like to do the some of the basic 2D plots with this data: heatmaps were
z is used for color table value, contouring on z and elevation plots were z
is height. Not all three at once.

I'm sure this is an RTFM, but I've looked. If someone could provide
pointers, references, suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,

-eric

Hi all,

I am working with Plugins for programmable filters that executes external
Python scripts. So far, so good.

However, I want to avoid to write the entire path of the Python file on the
XML file, as you can see highlighted in bold on the XML code down below.

Both, the XML and the Python file are in the same folder. Moreover, the XML
file and the Python file have the same name. So, I wonder if there is a way
to set up a relative path...do you have any ideas to solve that ?

Thanks in advance !

David,

I have not called filters within the Programmable Filter before and I am not getting things hooked up correctly.     My attempt is attached.   Clearly, I do not understand how to hook the output of 1 filter to the input of the next because I?m getting to the end and getting something with no blocks and no cells.

Any hints?

Dennis

The pass arrays filter comes to mind.

If creating withing your python programmable filter it will be called vtk.vtkPassArrays then follow that with a vtk.vtkPointDataToCellData.

All,

Well, this list solved my problem so easily (and made me feel slightly less than the sharpest pencil in the box) yesterday, so I thought I?d try again.

I am doing some Python calcs inside a programmable filter and some of the results I want to average from the Points onto the Cells.   But,  I don?t want all my PointData moved over to CellData ? I want to transfer some of them over within my Filter.

Right now I?m looping thru all the elements and finding all their nodes, then averaging them and assigning to the cells.  It is dog slow and is choking off the usefulness of this filter.

Is there anything like vtkPointDataToCellData that lets me specify which quantities to convert ? could I do something tricky like store original list of PointData, make up a new list, then run PointDataToCellData, then restore the list of PointData ??

I realize this may have all sorts of unexpected side effects, so I?m just asking!

Thanks again, this group is great!

Hello Miguel,

Programmable source are supported and your example seems to work.
Here is exactly how i tested it, with ParaView 5.4.0, 5.4.1 and 5.5, on
linux.

- Open ParaView
- Load State -> ERROR_pv_5_4_0.pvsm
- Select the source and the filter in the pipeline browser
- Tools->Create Custom Filter
- Write a SourceName
- Next, Next, Finish
- Edit->Reset Session
- *Sources*-> SourceName
- Apply

no bug, all seems to be working well.

Custom Filter are already automatically saved and loaded, they should be
available at the next paraview execution (considering ParaView exited
normally).

Best,

Mathieu Westphal

Dennis,

First, do you mean numpy.arctan2? I don't see that numpy.atan2 exists,but
math.atan2 exists.

Second, I suspect you are looping over millions of points in Python and are
calling numpy.arctan2 on single X, Y values. Looping in Python like that
will be very slow. Instead, you can get all your X values into one numpy
array and do the same with your Y values, then make a single call to
numpy.atan2. Here's an example:

>>> from paraview.simple import *

>>> import numpy

>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> y = [5, 6, 7, 8]

>>> numpy.arctan2(y, x)

array([ 1.37340077, 1.24904577, 1.16590454, 1.10714872])

To get the X and Y arrays, you can use the numpy adapter:

>>> from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa

>>> wrappedData = dsa.WrapDataObject(polydata)

>>> X = wrappedData.Points[:,0]

>>> Y = wrappedData.Points[:,1]

>>> result = numpy.arctan2(Y, X)

Hope that helps,
Cory

Cory,

No, I?m using numpy.arctan2 ? sorry, always think of it as atan2.

What I?m doing now is:

   # Undeformed Sector Angles (degrees about Y-axis, 0=FP)
   numPts=block.GetNumberOfPoints()
   node_angles=zeros( (numPts,1) )
                           x_undef,y_undef,z_undef=calc_node_undeformed_coords(block)
   node_angles=arctan2(x_undef,z_undef)*180.0/pi
return node_angles

So, I?m not looping, as you suggest.   I am later doing a custom point-data-to-cell-data by looping over millions of cells and finding each cells nodes and averaging them, but I?ve failed to get vtk.vtkPointDataToCellData to work inside my Programmable filter, so I don?t have a good alternative.

I keep meaning to take out the cell angles and see how much that speeds it up, but haven?t done that yet.

Thanks for looking at this.

Dennis

Hi Dennis,

You can calculate cylindrical coordinates by utilizing vtkCylindricalTransform within the python programmable filter. It is something like below and faster than numpy.

---
import vtk

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()

transform = vtk.vtkCylindricalTransform()

transformFilter = vtk.vtkTransformFilter()
transformFilter.SetInputData(input)
transformFilter.SetTransform(transform.GetInverse())
transformFilter.Update()

output.ShallowCopy(transformFilter.GetOutput())

This converts (x,y,z) coordinates to (r,theta,z) coordinates by GetInverse method,
where the angles are calculated by the following equation to change range to [0, 2*pi]:
  theta = pi + atan2(-y, -x).

Are there places on the cylinder you are calling atan2 with the same inputs, returning the same data, lots of times?  Alternatively, could you calculate this in the simulation, and just add it to the simulation output?  I am speculating that a C++ call to atan2 may be faster than numpy?

This does what you are looking for:

import vtk


# copy entire structure across

self.GetOutputDataObject(0).ShallowCopy(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0))


# use pass arrays to extract a copy with one array of interest

myArrays=vtk.vtkPassArrays()

myArrays.SetInputDataObject(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0))

myArrays.ClearArrays()

myArrays.AddPointDataArray('DISPL')

myArrays.AddCellDataArray('')

myArrays.AddFieldDataArray('')


# use point2cell to operate on the one array we care about

p2c = vtk.vtkPointDataToCellData()

p2c.SetInputConnection(myArrays.GetOutputPort())

p2c.Update()


# iterate over blocks and copy in the result

iter=dsa.MultiCompositeDataIterator([p2c.GetOutputDataObject(0), output])

for  in_block,  output_block in iter:

     output_block.GetCellData().AddArray(in_block.VTKObject.GetCellData().GetArray('DISPL'))

Eric,

You can potentially use the "Table To Structrued Grid" filter. Attached is
an example state file with a csv file used.

Thanks Utkarsh, Just a quick question to validate my understanding. It
sounds like you're confirming what I had determined so far, you can't plot
simple 2D data, you have to pretend its 3D, i.e. the additional of a z axis
where the values are all zero? I had figured that one out, and it works for
this example, a simple heat map. However, this doesn't work for the
creation of a contour plots or elevation plots, where the third variable is
interpreted as height? Ideally, the result would be an elevation plot with
the height values also used to color the surface. Can these other types of
plots also be created in paraview?

thanks,

-eric

Subject: [Paraview] Material Interface Filter undercounts on large datasets
Message-ID: <D70CE5EE.3E78E%bak@lanl.gov>

Dear ParaView Friends:  We have been very successful using the Material
Interface Filter, on grid-based datasets, for counting fragments of a
fractured shell, in all versions including v5.5.0.  A very peculiar thing
happens when the non-overlapping AMR dataset is large: the filter
completely fails to count the fragments.  That is, the result of applying
the filter is four (4) fragments, when there should by of order thousands.
 The filtering result on two datasets is given in the table below.  The
first, labeled MR is for a medium-resolution case, and the second labeled
HR is a high-resolution case (both are the same calculation, with
different grid resolution).  These datasets are available on the LANL
yellow net (but cannot be transferred away, at least right now).  We
remain hopeful that paraview can correctly count the fragments in the HR
case.  There will be future cases that are even larger.  If there are any
preference switches that can be tried, or other build configurations, we
can test them very quickly.  Thanks much, Bucky K.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      MR                 HR
14,315,904 cells      107,868,672 cells
15,228,928 points     114,216,960 points
6.3e+2 MB             4.7e+3 MB
128 files             768 files
2096 fragments        4 (four) fragments

(the datafiles are created one each per PE,
 using the paraview XMLHierarchicalBoxDataWriter;
 observing isosurfaces on both datasets suggests that
 the HR case should have >3000 fragments.)

I think the TableToPoints filter is what you want.  There's a checkbox
where you can tell the data to be 2D that is below where you assign columns
to X, Y and Z coordinates.
What happens is that the x, y and z columns get removed from the table and
a new point type is generated (yes, Z will get removed even if you select
only 2D points), so either redundantly assign the Z column to one of your
first two columns (so, X Column and Z Column are both set to the 'x' or
first column, which will be harmless in this case), or select 'Keep All
Data Arrays' which will keep the columns values around for coloring.

Note that with 2D points, the Render View SHOULD go to '2D', but it
sometimes doesn't.  There's a '3D' in small text at the top of the render
view that will go to '2D' if you click it.  Then hit the 'Set View
Direction -Z' glyph in the top bar.

Play with the Point Size var to fill in the gaps.  And the mouse works
slightly differently in 2D, so you'll have to develop new muscle memory. :)

Also consider using the Delaunay2D filter on the TableToPoints filter
instead of messing around with changing the point size.
