Subject: [Paraview] loading time variant data via a script file
Message-ID: <1157115279.10513.12.camel@howie.arl.army.mil>

All,
	I am trying to load time variant, multi-block Plot3D data via a .pvs
script and am not having much luck.  I have 12 grids and 40 timesteps
for each grid.  The script will load only the first timestep.  Will
a .pvs file load more than one timestep?  Am I doing something wrong?  

I am using Paraview 2.5.

Thanks in advance,
John

Subject: [Paraview] MPEG not working on OS X
Message-ID: <C12092CA.4D9B%mike.jackson@imts.us>

Paraview 2.4.4 Release...
  Tried to create an MPEG in paraview and the resulting movie is either
corrupt or otherwise unplayable. This is on OS X 10.4.7 and X-Windows.
Dumping the "movie" as a sequence of Images does work.

Has anyone else seen thid problem?  I also tweaked Paraview a bit to allow
it to actually save the screen as an image. There was a problem where it
would crash Paraview running in X-Windows on OS X. I applied the fix and
rebuilt. Don't know if this had any effect on the MPEG movie making or not.

Thanks

Disabling offscreen rending to fix the crash should not cause impact the
mpeg creation at all. Before I try to debug this, can you send me a small
mpeg movie created with paraview? Also, if you download, compile ffmpeg and
use it in your paraview build, you can produce animations of better quality
than you can with the mpeg encoder.

I'm looking for an example in which the zones information is divided

represent the system at single time, and I would like to know how to
visualize these files with Paraview

So, for the uninitiated among us, could you pass along your configure
settings for ffmpeg? I tried the basic ./configure/make/make install and
then tried compiling paraview and I get the following error from the
paraview build:

I compiled the svn of ffmpeg on my Intel Mac Mini with just
configure/make/make install. The source that is on the vtk site is older and
does not compile on OS X without modifications. I will update it when I am
more comfortable with the svn version.

So I got everything to compile (FFMPEG and Paraview) and I created a short
movie. Quicktime doesn't like the file. The movie does not show up in the
finder. Maybe I am just not using Paraview correctly..

Is there something special I have to do to make paraview use ffmpeg instead
of mencode besides compiling ffmpeg into paraview?

The file is attached as a zip file

Subject: [Paraview] Warp(vectors)
Message-ID: <91345ba70609041302x50eed2f4s91074bc9a8de7f4c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I try to warp a slice of a 3D image using a slice of a deformation
field. So far I am only able to warp the slice of vector field itself,
producing a curved surface with the colors derived from the magnitude
of the vectors. But I can't get the vectors to deform the slice of the
scalar image.
So I have two 3D images:
1 containing scalar data.
1 containing vectors.
I use the cut filter to extract a single slice from both images. Now I
want to deform the scalar image slice using the vector image slice. Is
this possible?

Thanks,
Reinhard

The paraview website indicates that iblanking is supported by paraview
but it is not fully implemented. Can someone tell me what the current
capabilities are and what the plans are for the near future? I read in a
grid with iblanking and the blanking did not appear to have any effect
on the display (i.e. holes were visible). Are there any steps that need
to be taken to activate the blanking after it is read in?

Message-ID: <1157489252.44fde2643616a@webmail.lncc.br>

Hi All.

We're building a software that for now must works in serial way. But soon, it
will have to be distribuited, Client, RenderServer and DataServer into
separated machines.

Well, my question is simple, cause I just have to be prepared. Paraview already
installs MPI on my machines? Or, will I have to install it manually?

Thank's for your help!

Vinicius,

O ParaView n?o ir? instalar o MPI nas suas maquinas, vc ter? de configurar o
seu cluster ou ambiente paralelo por conta propria (mas isso ? relativamente
simples). Na realidade voc? ter? de baixar o c?digo fonte do ParaView e
compila-lo com o MPI para poder usa-lo em paralelo.

ParaView will not install MPI on your system. You'll need to build your own
parallel environment first (but it's not hard to do). In fact, you will also
need to download the ParaView's source code and compile it with MPI in order
to run a parallel visualization.

Regards for you and your workmates, Marcio and Anderson ;o)

Shimon,

For me (in Version 2.4.4) the *.pvd "mother" or meta- file does what you 
are asking. I have attached an example file called fmavto.pvd. Please 
note that ParaView (and the *.pvd reader) expects each of your 'zones' 
to be a displayable object, that is, you should be able to read each 
zone file and post process the file as a distinct, complete graphics 
data set. The *.pvd reader is time step aware and part-number/name aware 
(use the Extract Dataset filter to work with 1, 2, or many zones as a 
sub-group).
Note: The name attribute is undocumented but works (very well);  it is 
your chance to give each part (or in your terminology 'zone') a useful 
name rather than a number. Look for the name in the Extract Datasets 
face-sheet (left panel).

Hello !

I have Gaussian 3.09 but cannot read the .cube file generated by

easier to read .cube file directly from paraview.
(i ve paraview 2.4)

I wrote the original code and have never tried G03 results, but I'll add
that on my todo list. The Gaussian support in ParaView was broken for a
long time. The CVS version actually started working again several weeks
ago.

one problem is that the reader uses multi output ports.

Turns out that you need at least some sort of MPEG-2 playback component for
OS X. This is NOT included in the base system install. In my case I happened
to have purchased the Quicktime MPEG-2 playback component from Apple ($20)
and just needed to install the intel version (PPC version came over from an
install).
  So after installing that I could see the movies that Paraview created just
fine.

Subject: [Paraview] Intel Compiler on OS X
Message-ID: <C1258E26.519E%mike.jackson@imts.us>

So I was lucky and was able to purchase the Intel C++ compiler for OS X. I
am now trying to use it to compile paraview and having a small problem.

When I run ccmake ../paraview  and set the CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER then hit the
"c" key to configure the "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER" goes back to /usr/bin/c++

So am I doing something wrong here?

If I get this going I would like to attempt Paraview 2.9 with QT and start
putting in DART reports against the intel compiler.

While I have not built Paraview for OS X, I did have to use an alternate
compiler
on one of my Linux systems.  Like yours, it would reset the compiler back to
default.
The way that I got around that was to use something like the following:

% CC=/path/to/C/Compiler CXX=/path/to/C++/Compiler ccmake ../paraview-2.4.4

Obviously I removed my path from the above since it would be of no help to
you.
Just replace the above pseudo path with the appropriate one for you.

So, I am guessing one _always_ extracts one of the outputs and then apply a
filter. Does it make sense to apply the same filter to both outputs?

I am trying to figure out whether the output of this reader should
multi-block. It sounds like it should not. It sounds like the two outputs
have different purposes and should remain separate.

Currently, paraview only handles multi-block datasets. There was code in
paraview 2.4 and previous that treated multiple outputs as multi-block. This
was a placeholder we implemented until we had proper multi-block support.
Now that the multi-block support is mature, I yanked that functionality. The
side effect of this yanking is that it is no longer possible to separate the
outputs of readers like this. However, I believe that paraview should start
treating multiple output differently. For example, it should show both
outputs as different ports you can attach filters to. Or when the user
applies a filter to this reader, it should bring a dialog asking which
output they want to attach the filter  to. Supporting this would require
changing both the server manager and the GUI code but I believe it is right
thing to do. Any thoughts?

I've seen many Windows machines that could not play the MPEG-2 files
either. The codec is available for free, somewhere, It's found its way
onto some of the Windows machines in our lab. The windows install of
MPlayer works too.

Ahhh Yes!
you must remember to source the file containing the environmental  
variables
required by the compilers to find their stuff

read the instructions for the compiler package

should be something like

source /opt/intel/cc/9.1.029/bin/iccvars.sh

cheers

no, it makes no sense at all. The first output is only polydata used to
generate a molecular representation (via glyphs)
the second port holds a 3D voume mesh (vtkImageData) which is the volume
of density in which the molecule is placed.

I would not dedicate any effort to this specific reader. My experience
shows that support in PV was broken for many months and nobody
complained. Further, the reader itself needs a new implementation to be
conform to other molecular visualization packages (IMHO)

Working however on the more general purpose of separating multiple ports
is a much more useful.

Ok. Did all that. I added the sourcing of the iccvars.sh to my .bashrc file.
Did a clean make and still the same problem when it gets to the point of
linking libvtkCommonTCL it dies with the same errors. I also noticed from
the verbose make file that at the link stage the intel library folder is not
being included as a link directory and neither are the intel libs..

Hi Mike,

I have built VTK with python(universal) wrappings
on an intel macbook pro with the 0.29 version of the intel compilers.
That's always been with recent CVS versions of VTK.
Not sure what VTK version you are using.

so it might be a problem with the 0.30 version of the intel  
compilers...?

I noticed that many of the VTK .dylibs i generate link against
libGuide.dylib, which is one of the intel libs

Watch out, the install_name of the intel libs are not set correctly
and i have been having problems getting the install_names set correctly
on
make install
and also using
py2app

this means that if you forget to run
>> source /opt/intel/cc/9.1.029/bin/iccvars.sh
then you will be in trouble at runtime, as the intel libs
will not be in the dynamic library path

(shouldn't it be the .profile not the .bashrc that you add that to?)

I have also had success using the compiler flag -xP for optimisation
for the intel core duo chip in the MacBook Pro.
Seemed to make some of our custom VTK C++ code faster.
I suppose thats the point of using those compilers in the first place.

cheers

So where do I tell cmake where to find those libraries? If I was writing my
own cmakelists.txt I would just insert a LINK_DIRECTORIES command? Where in
the ccmake for Paraview do I add those libraries?

Not sure if I am supposed to put the sourcing of the iccvars.sh in my
.bashrc or my .bash_profile.

And did you have to "export CC=/usr/bin/icc" and "export CXX=/usr/bin/icc"

Thanks

dont need to to that, the iccvars.sh script will
add the path to the intel libs to your dynamic library load path
so they will get found that way (or at least they did for 0.29 and VTK,
I haven't had chance to test the 0.30 version of the compilers yet.)

i think its supposed to be .profile
not sure if my environment is a bit screwed up having moved it from  
an older PPC mac.

Yes, you must do that for a fresh clean VTK CVS tree
or else ccmake will use gcc and you cant make it change to icc and  
icpc after that is set.

Should I remove the reader from ParaView then? From VTK?

Hi Mike,

I'm not sure if it's relevant for icc on OSX, but using icc on Linux  
I've had fewer linking problems when invoking the C++ compiler with  
the icpc command.  Apparently this should guarantee linking of the C+ 
+ libraries.  From the icc-9.0 man page:

        NOTE: The icpc command uses the same compiler options as the   
icc  com-
        mand.   Invoking  the  compiler using icpc compiles .c,  
and .i files as
        C++.  Invoking the compiler using icc compiles .c and .i   
files  as  C.
        Using  icpc always links in C++ libraries.  Using icc only  
links in C++
        libraries if C++ source is provided on the command line.

Maybe "export CXX=/usr/bin/icpc" is worth a try.

Best,
Bill

 Why not configure your three display to one large logic one?   pvserver need a configure file

You will also have to run MPI in such a way that each process has its

Hi,

I try to warp a slice of a 3D image using a slice of a deformation
field. So far I am only able to warp the slice of vector field itself,
producing a curved surface with the colors derived from the magnitude
of the vectors. But I can't get the vectors to deform the slice of the
scalar image.
So I have two 3D images:
1 containing scalar data.
1 containing vectors.
I use the cut filter to extract a single slice from both images. Now I
want to deform the scalar image slice using the vector image slice. Is
this possible?

Thanks,
Reinhard

Message-ID: <4501A1C5.30601@gmail.com>

Hi the list,

Trying to build paraview, I have a few questions.

First, after built it, paraview complains it does not find tcl8.4 lib.
tcl8.4 is in /usr/lib (as tk8.4) , but paraview does not look for in it,
but :

ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed
Tcl_Init error: Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following directories:
    /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 /home/lib/tcl8.4 /lib/tcl8.4 /home/library
/library /tcl8.4.5/library /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4

I have set LD_LIBRARY_PATH because I need it, but paraview should look
for in /usr/lib, no ?


If I set a link in /usr/local/lib/{tcl,tk} to /usr/lib, it works fine,
but I don't like this solution ;-)

I don't see anything in concern with TCL_INCLUDE_PATH (as in building VTK).
What am I doing wrong ?

Second, I have already vtk (5.0) built/installed in /usr/local.
But building paraview seems to build it anyway.
How can I tell to paraview building to use the already existing vtk in
/usr/local ?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

I recall having to set TCLLIBPATH="~/kitware/ParaView_Build/lib/tcl8.4/"
but this has been "fixed in CVS"

You don't. I know there is extra stuff in the ParaView VTK.

In fact, it does not work at all :-(
I did a mistake.

I'm trying to render the following scene :
http://fredantispam@free.fr/pv_noparal.png
So for a single proc, it works fine.

When I use paraview in parallel, I get this :

http://fredantispam@free.fr/pv_paral.png

What's wrong ?

PS :

1) I run
 mpirun -np 2 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
+
 pvclient

2) Debian sarge, XFree86 4.3.0, nvidia latest driver in SLI mode.

Hi the list,

First question :
In most OpenGL applications, moving the mouse forward zooms in,
and backward, out.

In paraview, this is the opposite. So I'm quite lost ;-)
Is it possible to change this feature ?

Second question :
When I want to open a data file, I whish the Open Data item let me

Is it possible to do such a thing ?

Samual,

Thanks for the help. However, each of my "parts" is presented by
"legacy" VTK format file (i.e. it's a *.vtk file). When I tried to
change your metafile and specify my vtk files as the "parts", paraview
was not able to read the files (eventhogh I was able to view each of the
vtk files by  paraview when I read it directly as a stand alone file). 
I would apreciate if you or anyone else could help me using these
"legacy" vtk files as parts of a metafile.
Thanks again,

Shimon

Shimon,

For me (in Version 2.4.4) the *.pvd "mother" or meta- file does what you

are asking. I have attached an example file called fmavto.pvd. Please 
note that ParaView (and the *.pvd reader) expects each of your 'zones' 
to be a displayable object, that is, you should be able to read each 
zone file and post process the file as a distinct, complete graphics 
data set. The *.pvd reader is time step aware and part-number/name aware

(use the Extract Dataset filter to work with 1, 2, or many zones as a 
sub-group).
Note: The name attribute is undocumented but works (very well);  it is 
your chance to give each part (or in your terminology 'zone') a useful 
name rather than a number. Look for the name in the Extract Datasets 
face-sheet (left panel).

Subject: [Paraview] September snapshot of ParaView III
Message-ID: <4505A1EF.9000109@kitware.com>

Hi Folks,

I posted the September snapshot of ParaView III. The download links and 
announcements for all snapshots can be found at:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

This snapshot includes binaries for Windows, Linux (32 and 64 bit) and Mac OS X. 
For those who have issues running the binaries, who cannot find the binary for 
their system or who want to see/modify the source code, source archives are also 
included.

New features to look out for include:

* Improved multi-view support:
   Try creating, destroying, maximizing, restoring and moving views. To move a
   view, click on it's toolbar and drag onto another view's toolbar.
* Improved server connection and start dialog
* Improved selection:
   Try turning on the element inspector before selecting,
   (View -> Element Inspector)
* More toolbar buttons including those for manipulating camera. Better icons are
   coming soon
* Separate camera undo/redo buttons for each view
* Dialog for changing application and view settings (Edit -> Settings)
* Capability to disconnect from server while saving an animation

Also check out:

* Custom filter dialog (tutorial coming)
* Undo/redo
* Custom reader/filter panels (try exodos reader, cut and clip)
* Python scripting

There is still very little documentation. Look at 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III to get more information on the new 
features. We will continue adding more documentation to this page as we progress.

Hi,

I've got this up and running on my PowerBook running OS X 10.4. I've  
rendered 10,000 spherical glyphs, and the rendering is smooth even  
while rotating and zooming. I haven't try to test its performance  
limits, I'm just happy to be able to save an image correctly.

Thanks!
Rick

Subject: [Paraview] use vtk and python from paraview
Message-ID: <20060912062522.GB5089@ddorf.de>

Hi,

is it possible to use paraview's vtk-python and vtk
'installation' to run own vtk programs? I will not be allowed to
install every python-module, cmake and vtk on my working
machine, but I think I can convince the administrator to
install paraview, so it would be nice, if I can do this!

Greetings!
Fabian

Hi,

me again :-)

I am looking for a way to calculate average values on
certain planes (e.g. extract with Extract Datasets or
Extract Grids). Is there a simple way or even a filter to do
it in paraview? Would be nice!

Don't set that option.  That option builds a very antiquated test code
for the parallel rendering code.  It has no effect on tile display
support in ParaView (except making the build fail).

Is anybody else seeing this? 

http://paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=3767

Is it x86_64, gcc-4.1.1 , ..., or whatever else is weird about my
computer.

I suspect it has something to do with unstructured grids.

Works for me on x86_64, gcc-4.1.1, Linux 2.6.17-1.2145_FC5 #1 SMP, 
with nvidia drivers, and a debug build of this mornings cvs.

I'll try a debug build and see if ParaView makes any useful noises. I'm
using the x.org 'ati' driver for X, but software Mesa for ParaView.
Hmmmm...

I can't think of any change we made recently that would cause this. Was
there any change to your system?

Maybe, yum does it's thing on it's own every night I'll look for xorg,
glibc, and such in the logs for the passed few weeks. I haven't rebuilt
the Mesa library recently. I'm running a "make clean && make" of
ParaView now since I changed from release to debug.

Well, the system Mesa packages have been updated though I wasn't using
them ( at least not on purpose ) and both are 6.4.2. Python, qt, tcl,
and tk have been updated. Lots of x.org stuff has been updated. I
thought these were supposed to be minor changes though.  I guess I'll
see in a few seconds if the rebuild fixed it....

The rebuild did not fix it. Though now as soon as I click accept on the
clip filter ParaView exits with :

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc

I'll see if I can get a core...

Subject: [Paraview] How to Change Default Drawing for A VTK File
Message-ID: <DF35ECFEF1FE265312914AE5@harpo.psc.edu>

How can I read a legacy VTK file and not see the surface automatically?

The file is large, unstructured and it takes a long time to generate the surface. I'd rather see the outline.

It seems like the "default" would be changed if I read the data, changed to "outline", and then exited PV so that it could update its defaults file in my home directory. But that had no effect.

PV 2.4.4 compiled from source
Fedora Core 4

Thanks!

This line is :

 resultData = new unsigned char [rowLength*ysize];

ddd tells me that rowLength and ysize are monstrous negative numbers
when I put a breakpoint there. xsize is also a huge negative number.
size[0] = 256, size[1] = 1, and size[2] = 1 do these make sense?

Hi Kent,

Try the following: select 3D View Properties from the View menu, go to 
the General tab, and change the Outline Threshold slider to a value such 
that the number of cells in your unstructured data set is larger than 
the value of the slider.

It's the same machine, but no, I have no particular reason to believe
that the bug :
http://paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=3767
is causing the errors on the dashboard. ( Oops no link. The power went
out last night. ) I am suspicious because I think they both showed up in
the last few months, and there's at least one test that involves
clipping but really that's all. It'd be nice if they are the same
though.

Currently I am facing the same problem trying to build ParaView on a  
MacPro. Can anyone point me to a solution for this?
Any help is greatly appreciated.

I'd like to contribute a VTK module I've written that adds a new visual method to ParaView. The notes at

   http://public.kitware.com/VTK/contribute.php

seem to be slightly out of date. For example, they point to vtkEarthSource as an example but that class does not have a "Thanks" field anywhere and refers the reader to a non-existent copyright page.

Is there a better source for this information?

The latest cvs version of ParaView builds automagically now
(Thank you whoever you are!!). I've had success with building
older versions by taking the CMakeCache.txt file from the new
version, and changing the location of the build and source
directories.

Attached is a CMakeCache.txt built on a MacBookPro running
10.4.7, using CMake 2.4.3 and the CVS version of ParaView
from 9/13. Search and replace
    /Users/wkoegle/util/src/ParaView-cvs
with your source directory, and
    /Users/wkoegle/util/src/ParaView-2006-09-13-build
with your build directory.
(Note that I changed BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to ON, and
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Debug)

You are welcome :-)

Instructions for building ParaView 2.4 on the Mac are here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_compile_ParaView_for_Mac_OS_X.3F
As Wendy mentioned, CVS ParaView should build without changes as long as you
have X11 installed. ParaView 3 will not depend on X11.

I did a clean build today starting with "rm -r *" in the build
directory. The behavior is the same as yesterday except now ParaView
does not immediately exit when I update the clip, and it produces the
message below when I click on the render viewport.

ErrorMessage

I can now relate this bug to one of the tests that fail on
gargon.hooperlab, that is :

http://paraview.org/Testing/Sites/gargon.hooperlab/Linux-c++/20060915-1537-Experimental/Results/__GUI_Testing_Tcl_CalcInput-batch-ParaView.html

I copied the file
"/home/kevin/kitware/ParaView/GUI/Testing/Tcl/CalcInput.pvs" and
commented out the lines that source things and close the window :

diff /home/kevin/kitware/ParaView/GUI/Testing/Tcl/CalcInput.pvs
CalcInput.pvs
4,5c4,5
< source [file join [file dirname [info script]] CommandLineOptions.tcl]
< ParseCommandLine $pv(vtkTemp43) $argv $argc

---
> #source [file join [file dirname [info script]] Compare.tcl]
> #Compare $Application $argv $argc
52c52
< $Application Exit
---
> #$Application Exit

When I run "paraview CalcInput.pvs" ParaView is left in the same frozen
render viewport state I've described before. I can see only the sphere.
If I click on the render viewport I get the message below and ParaView
exits.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc

It seems, that this approach does not work ... I might start
convincing my administror.

Isn't it something 'everybody' needs? Maybe, it has been
discussed before and I couldn't find it, so it would be nice
to point me in some direction.

Hello !

Is it possible to install paraview on a single system (SGI Prism) with

It looks to me like FindPowerOfTwo in vtkOpenGLTexture.h is returning
crazy numbers. It proceeds through the for loop and sets size to 265.
Then after glGetIntegerv, maxDimGL is a huge negative number so of
course size is set to this huge negative number. I don't have debug
symbols for glGetIntegerv, so I have no idea what it's doing.

I've seen this before with a VTK application - if FindPowerOfTwo() is
called without a current OpenGL context, glGetIntegerv() fails, leaving
its (uninitialized) arguments unmodified.  A short-term workaround that
was successful for me was to initialize maxDimGL to zero in
FindPowerOfTwo() before calling glGetIntegerV(), then add some logic in
vtkOpenGLTexture::ResampleToPowerOfTwo() to ignore the FindPowerOfTwo()
results if they're zero.  Of course the correct long-term solution would
be to ensure that vtkOpenGLTexture::ResampleToPowerOfTwo() only gets
called with a current OpenGL context.

Cheers,
Tim

Yup, I think that's correct, I just recompiled my mesa with debug,
MESA_DEBUG in the shell, and tried my little clip thing again. Mesa
complains :

I wonder WHY I have no OpenGL context. Oh boy is this going to be fun to

Subject: [Paraview] Building a Source in Paraview
Message-ID: <1158604666.450ee77a732fd@webmail.lncc.br>

Hi all.

I'm building a source in paraview. I'm doing that extending the PVSource class.
The BIG problem that I'm having is that when I press the Accept button, some
elements of paraview doesn't get "free" so I get to use them. Elements such as
Filters menu (the hole menu stays unactivated) and cutters from the main
toolbar. Also, Paraview doesn't create the other tabs of my source, such as
Display and Information. The only interaction with Paraview that I have on my
class is manually setting the PVSource::Initialized = 1. Cause, before that, it
wasn't even recognizing that the Accept button has been pressed.

Can anyone PLEASE give me some tips on how to solve this kind of problem.

Thank's!

I tried changing vtkOpenGLTexture::FindPowerOfTwo() to include an
initialization and test like this :

  GLint maxDimGL=0;
  glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE,&maxDimGL);
  if ( ( maxDimGL > 0 ) && ( size > maxDimGL ) )
    {
        size = maxDimGL ;
    }
Of course this doesn't do a thing for the context being gone. Nothing is
rendered after I use the clip filter. There's no segfault nor the
unhandled exception, but the results are wrong.

Are you chaining to the superclass' Accept call? vtkPVSource does a lot of
stuff that will not work if you don't chain.

I noticed that the of the ClipCut tests run on gargon batch failed while
the ClientServer and RenderServer tests passed. I tried my little test
where I bring up the wavelet source and clip it in paraview with
offscreen rendering on and it works. Without offscreen rendering the
viewport hangs and mesa complains about the invalid context.

Message-ID: <d3d4ab920609190221w4f9f7f39rc68cd3a3b1eb1a43@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have got an interesting problem related with vtkHierarchicalDataSet.
I have composed this hierarchical structure from numerous
vtkUnstructuredGrids. Each unstructured grid element have some data
attributes assigned. In VTK all works fine and I can see my attribute
data nicely mapped as colors.

However, when I use ParaViews server manager, the vtkSMDisplayProxy
shows nothing (my object is white). When I call:

  pdInf = smDisplay.GetGeometryInformation().GetPointDataInformation()

The point data information indicates no attribute data. I suppose,
only attributes associated directly with the vtkHierarchicalDataSet
object are displayed.

To me it seems logical, to have attribute data associated with
"leaves" of the hierarchy instead of with the top-level object. It
seems to be more practical approach especially when one wants to split
these objects and process them separately at some point (or
potentially group them back).

If anyone is willing to share some ideas how to display attribute data
associated with datasets of the hierarchy it would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you,
Milan.

PS: I'm working with cca one month old CVS version.

Hi,

I would like to use paraview to calculate the moments around a reentry
vehicle. In order to do so I have cut the surface out of my 3D results
and now I want to multiply the pressure in each face with the face
normal. I can display the face normal vector but I can't use it in the
calculator ... is this a bug or a feature ??

Thanks a lot,

I just tried some things on our Beowulf cluster as pvserver and my
workstation as the pvclient. I tried opening up the wavelet source
( worked ), contouring ( worked ), color by process id ( worked ), but
as soon as I clip anything the pvserver dies with a segfault.

The pvserver complained as below but it was run with
--use-offscreen-rendering. The server was built with mesa as the only
GL.

Hi folks,

I'd like to know if there's any way to open an Ensight server-of-server set
of files in Paraview and save the parallel transient data in another format
more well suported by ParaView like VTK's formats. I'm still using PV 2.2.1
because most of the features that I'm interested in are not fully suported
in the newer PV releases. I've already thought to write a routine to save my
files in another format, but, I still have a bunch of simulations stored in
Ensight's format. 

Have anyone implemented any kind of translation tool yet?

Thanks for any hint

ps.: I wonder see some volume rendering movies from my simulations...

It looks like the bug 3767 and many of the tests that were failing on my
computer were due to my use of the osmesa library. Changing only the
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA cmake setting got rid of most of the errors and
the hang.

Dear Friends,

I would like to apologise for my previous post. The error was
somewhere else in my code not in VTK or ParaView. (there were no data
attributes in the datasets)

Now everything works fine and the PointDataInformation method actually
"collects" attribute data information from the "leafs" of the
hierarchical structure.

Thanks,
Milan.

Does anybody have any clue why telling cmake that I have osmesa would
cause clip, and threshold to cause the OpenGL context to become invalid?

I'm going to follow the mesa3d.org suggestion and stick a breakpoint
into _mesa_error(). And take a look at stuff mentioned in :

[kevin@gargon ParaView]$ grep VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA $( find ./ -name 'CMakeLists.txt' )

Any other suggestions?

hello,


I have got the same problem. I use paraview 2.2.1, which I build with
cmake.

I'm not sure, but I think there is a missing line in the function 

vtkPLOT3DReader.cxx.

function : Execute()
I add the line :

961      this->SkipByteCount(qFp);


This could explain the difference of one node you see on the display of the field.

I think this started for me sometime late this summer in the CVS
development version.

I am guessing that this may be related to some changes Utkarsh and Amy have
been making.  Utkarsh, can you check when the HAVS renderer was added?
Kevin could try to update to before then and see if this fixed the problem.
Also, can you try the CVS version of Mesa, Kevin? We have reported a bug to
the Mesa group that they fixed. I don't think it relates to this particular
problem but it is worth a try. As soon as I have some time, I will try with
mesa as well.

In ddd I put a breakpoint in _mesa_warning(), caused my osmesa build of
ParaView to mess up by adding the wavelet source and clipping it, and
then ran a backtrace from the breakpoint. Here's the output :

I've never done this before. Is it something like :
 "cvs update -P -d -A -D datestrFromUtkarsh"

Sure, I'm building it now.

It doesn't look like much changed with the CVS ParaView built against
the CVS Mesa. The viewport still froze, and the backtrace from
_mesa_warning looks the same to me.

Subject: [Paraview] Mesa + Save View Image = black jpg?
In-Reply-To: <1158756325.15362.8.camel@gargon.hooperlab>
Message-ID: <8D6309F95A065249918E4B5FA1A45E140199BF51@naeanrfkez03>

Hello all-

I've been working on getting paraview setup with Mesa and
off-screen-rendering on a Opteron cluster.

I successfully compiled with mesa and was able to get everything fired
up with off-screen rendering.   However, when I turn compositing on, the
rendered image becomes black and white with black squares superimposed.
In addition, even though the image looks and behaves correctly when
local Mesa rendering is used, saving a picture yields an all black
frame.

I then thought to eliminate the parallel issue and ran a version with
Mesa rendering in serial - same results.   Everything looks ok in the
gui, but a saved image is entirely black.

Has anyone else experienced this issue?

-David

From previous conversations with Berk Geveci I've found out that
Paraview uses offscreen rendering for the save in case some window jumps
in front of the render window. There are two offscreen render methods
pbuffer and osmesa. pbuffer is supported by many OpenGL libraries osmesa
is only used if you say you have osmesa. 

I also recall some messages to the list ( some mine ) about some of
this. I think some work has been done and you may find save working in
CVS. 

Berk has also pointed out that you can disable the offscreen rendering
for save. He suggested :

	Try editing Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMRenderModuleProxy.cxx and
	commenting out this line (around line 1112)
	  this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(1);
	and this line:
	  this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(0);
	around line 1129.

hi

I have imported fluent date file as an ensight case file,  I woul like to be 
able to display the derivitive of the density values. The density filter is 
grayed out.

I am currently creating a cut using a plane to display the density, and 
would now like to visualise the density change, is ther any way to do this?

Thanks,

Barry

Subject: [Paraview] Error accessing a server object through properties
Message-ID: <1158861663.4512d35fd66b5@webmail.lncc.br>


Hi,

I'm building a polydata filter in Paraview and my GUI is created through a
vtkPV* file, instead of building it in my XML files. I'm trying to send
parameters to my filter using properties. I can get the property but when I
call the "UpdateVTKObjects" of my proxy, the following error appears:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file:
/home/workspace/HeMoLab/utilities/paraview-2.4.2/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx
(556)
 vtkPVProcessModule (0x80671e0): Object type: vtkSMSourceProxy, could not find
requested method: "ApplyDelaFilter"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think the "Object type" should be my class, but the SourceProxy appears
instead.

Any suggestions?

Yours Sincerely,

Rodrigo L. S. Silva

Sorry for getting in a bit late, I almost missed this thread :).

Yes, Berk, this  certainly sounds like a result of the changes to 
include the HAVS mapper in ParaView, especially since Clip/Threshold 
cause the problem. Clip/Threshold produce UnstructuredGrid. Since 
UnstructuredGrid can be volume rendered, the display does a OpenGL 
extensions check on the server to see if HAVS mapper can be used. The 
OpenGL extensions check creates new render window on the server, queries 
the extensions and then destroys the render window. The destruction of 
the window corrupts all other GL contexts (this was reported to Mesa 
developers and they fixed the bug on the Mesa CVS head).

But, Kevin, since you are saying that the CVS Mesa doesn't make any 
difference, can you try applying the following patch. This will shunt 
off the HAVS mapper checking stuff, which will atleast help us determine 
the cause.

Utkarsh.

Does the property you added in the XML have  " update_self="1" "? If so, 
then the method is called on the Proxy itself rather than VTK object it 
represents. Remove the update_self attribute or set it to "0" and it 
should fine.

The patch fixes the problem.

One thing I did not do when I checked if mesa from cvs fixes the problem
was 'make clean'. I'll remove the patch and do a clean build just to be
sure.

The vtkCellDerivatives filter is what you want, I think. I don't think it is
included in paraview out of the box. Look here for enabling an existing
filter in the GUI:

I'd like to contribute a VTK module I've written that adds a new visual method to ParaView. The notes at

   http://public.kitware.com/VTK/contribute.php

seem to be slightly out of date. For example, they point to vtkEarthSource as an example but that class does not have a "Thanks" field anywhere and refers the reader to a non-existent copyright page.

Is there a better source for this information?

Even when I make a clean build of ParaView with yesterday's CVS version
of Mesa the viewport hangs. With Utkarsh's patch it does not.

Hi

Thanks for the link, I followed this link  
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend, and copy and pasted the two 
script files. However thay just cause paraview to crash.

Any Suggestions?

I don't think there is a better source. Someone should probably update that
document. You might want to look at some of the existing VTK classes. Also,
if you send me the code, I can provide some feedback (warning: I have been
busy and this might take a few days).

Hi

The procedure I follow is:
I import the ensight case file, using litlle endian. I select the density 
Array and press accept
Create a cutting plan
Import package, and select vtkCellDerivatives.xll and clik ok

Paraview loads the filter, with a grayed out eye the source panel does not 
change otherwise, the "properties panel" is that of the cut I created.

Nothing happens, paraview crashes, there does not seem to be a log file.

The data type is point

the script files are below

Thanks for the help,

Barry

vtkCellDerivatives is a filter that computes derivatives of scalars
and vectors at the center of cells. You can choose to generate
different output including the scalar gradient (a vector), computed
tensor vorticity (a vector), gradient of input vectors (a tensor),
and strain matrix of the input vectors (a tensor); or you may
choose to pass data through to the output.

Note that it is assumed that on input scalars and vector point data
is available, which are then used to generate cell vectors and tensors.
(The interpolation functions of the cells are used to compute the
derivatives which is why point data is required.)

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting transient probe data
Message-ID: <20060922131315.B9D6B72756@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi folks,

I'm running a free surface flow where I need to plot the interface height
over time in some points of the domain. For this purpose I thought of using
a line probe filter in each place, where I'd like do measure the interface
height. My problem is that I must get the data corresponding to each time
step (300 time steps) for several different places (5 places) and I don't
know if it's possible to export the transient probing data automatically
with PV. Does anybody have any idea how I could do it?

Note that I could do it manually, advancing the time steps and saving the
probe data one-by-one (300x5 times!) but, as anyone can see, it's not
practical.  

thanks a lot for any help

ps: Sometime ago I have posted a similar question but in that case I was
thinking about a probe filter which we could set a value in order to have
the probe following the value position (like a "Lagrangian probing"). It
would be interesting to have a probe tool like that. In my case, I could
anchor the probe on the interface and track the interface height over time
easily.

I'm building a filter and it's superclass is vtkAlgorithm. My GUI is build on a

Subject: [Paraview] Extending PVSource
Message-ID: <1158963765.451462357dd7d@webmail.lncc.br>

Hi all.

I'm building a source in paraview. I'm doing that extending the PVSource class.
The BIG problem that I'm having is that when I press the Accept button, some
elements of paraview doesn't get "free" so I get to use them. Elements such as
Filters menu (the hole menu stays unactivated) and cutters from the main
toolbar. Also, Paraview doesn't create the other tabs of my source, such as
Display and Information. The only interaction with Paraview that I have on my
class is manually setting the PVSource::Initialized = 1. Cause, before that, it
wasn't even recognizing that the Accept button has been pressed.

Can anyone PLEASE give me some tips on how to solve this kind of problem.

Thank's!

Subject: [Paraview] paraview/MPI & opacity...
Message-ID: <45145337.50000@gmail.com>

Hi the list,

I'm playing with paraview using MPI.

I use contour filter and set some opacity to it.

If opacity is set to 1, the rendered scene is fine.
http://fredantispam.free.fr/a.png

However, if I set opacity to, say 0.2, only the half (bottom) of the
scene is displayed.
But the cube is well displayed.
http://fredantispam.free.fr/b.png

I use a sample vtk file (not pvtk). Should it be the reason ?
But it should not work even with opacity set to 1, no ?


Thanks in advance.

Have you tried turning on ordered composting in the 3d menu?

Did you get the latest version of cmake (2.4.3)? I remember running into a
similar problem. Updating cmake fixed the problem.

All,

 

Background on Environment:

Topspin Infiniband Interconnect

RHEL 4 update 4

 

glibc 2.3.4-2.25

ccmake 2.4-patch 3

gmake 3.80

gcc 3.4.6 (RedHat)

 

I'm a newbie building a parallel version of Paraview for our Dell Linux
cluster.  I'm getting an error that I'm not sure what to do with:

 

/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible

gmake[2]: *** [bin/pvbatch] Error 1

gmake[1]: *** [Servers/Executables/CMakeFiles/pvbatch.dir/all] Error 2

gmake: *** [all] Error 2

 

I checked the OPENLG_gl_LIBRARY line in the cmake file and I have tried
both /usr/lib/libGL.so and /usr/lib64/libGL.so.  Any ideas?

 

Thanks for your time,

Howdy Kent,

I'm building Paraview version 2.4.4 on an Intel Xeon (EMT64) machine.

I followed the build instructions and used cmake to make the
configuration changes to the OPEN_gl_LIBRARY values.

Thanks,

Jay

What version of ParaView? Is your system 32 or 64 bit?

You tried setting OPENLG_gl_LIBRARY to two different files. How did you
try? Merely changing the value in CMakeCache.txt doesn't usually work;
you have to change it using cmake and then let cmake re-generate the
make files.

I have a polygonal dataset in vtk format, the polygonal data is defined by points and vertices. The data attributes are: scalars and vectors. I was able to use glyph filter to show the velocities,  but when I tried to use stream tracer, nothing happen, no matter where I seed my streamline.  What  should I do to show the velocity filed  by using the streamline ? 
 
 Any help are appreciated!

Message-ID: <200609251606.58963.pjb9508@vashon.ca.boeing.com>


I'm having trouble running ccmake with paraview-2.9-september (linux).
Must qt version 4 be used?  There is an variable called "desired version of 
QT" which seems to imply version 3 can be used.  

Believing that qt version 4 must be used, I installed it and set the following 
variables: 

QTDIR=<root of qt4 build directory>
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=$QTDIR/bin/qmake
QT4_QGLOBAL_FILE=$QTDIR/include/Qt/qglobal.h

I'm still getting the error message below.  Can anyone please tell me how to 
fix this?  

Thanks in advance

Yes, you need to have Qt 4.  The desired version variable is inherited
from the embedded distribution of VTK, but is not supported by the rest
of the Qt libraries for ParaView.

What do you "set the variables?"  Are those environment variables you
are setting?  If so, that won't work because CMake does not inherit
environment variables for its own internal variables.  Did you enter
those values into CMakeCache.txt?  That won't work either because $QTDIR
will not be properly dereferenced.

Your best bet is to make sure the Qt 4 version of qmake is in your path
(not the Qt 3 version), delete your configuration directory, and run
ccmake from scratch.

Hi,

Building paraview 2.9, I get the message that cmake does not find
PARAVIEW_DATA_ROOT.

I googled and found nothing.

A feature not yet implemented ?

Or what am I doing wrong ?

Message-ID: <200609261902.k8QJ2EZe008961@tremex.ucdavis.edu>


Hello to the Parview list, 

I am a new Paraview user. I use it to visualize the effects of heavy
pumpage on groundwater. I am displaying a vector field of groundwater flow
around the well and I would like to place a cylinder to indicate its
location. I enter information on the location of the well in a cylinder
source and the cylinder nicely shows up, the problem is that when I rotate
it 90dg to put it paralel to the z axis the cylinder simply disappears. In
fact it is only properly displayed when it is at the default orientation,
it vanishes at any other.  

The data set uses world coordinates (UTM coordinates) for the southern
hemisphere. I am running PV precompiled version 2.4, release 4 for Windows
on Windows XP Professional SP2. I have searched the mailing list to check
if this problems was reported before but found nothing. 

I am not sure if the information I provide suffices. I will be happy to
provide any other information that would help find out the problem

Sounds like the center of rotation for your cylinder is off, so that
rotating it displaces it off-screen.  Make sure that the Cylinder
"Center" property in the "Parameters" tab is set to the origin, then use
the "Actor Control" properties in the "Display" tab to position and
orient your cylinder.

Absolutely right!! there it is the cyclinder standing at the right
position! Now I understand better since I realize the 'Actor Control' lets
you place the origin and the translation for affine transforms. 

Thank you, Timothy, for the prompt reply. Paraview is becoming a very
valuable tool for me.

Hi everybody,

here it's me again struggling with my Ensight files ;o)

I'm still trying to write a script to load an Ensight case file and export
the corresponding VTK file for each time step. My problem is that I can't
realize how to sweep the time steps loaded from the casefile. I found the
SetTimeValue method but I don't know how to select the next time step yet.
Does anybody more experienced with VTK+TCL could give me a hand? The script
is the following:

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

package require vtk

# loading command line arguments
set arch  [lindex $argv 0]      

# building the filename
set    casefile $arch
append casefile ".case"
puts " Reading Ensight casefile $casefile"

# defining the Ensight's reader
vtkGenericEnSightReader reader
   reader SetCaseFileName $casefile
   reader Update

# getting the minimum and maximum time values for debug purposes
   set tmin [ reader GetMinimumTimeValue ]
   puts " minimum time $tmin"   
   
   set tmax [ reader GetMaximumTimeValue ]
   puts " maximum time $tmax"   

# defining some counters
set tnow $tmin
set nfile 0

# loop over time steps
while { $tnow < $tmax } {

      # building the vtk filename
      set vtkfilename $arch
      append vtkfilename ".vtk"
      set prefix ""      
      if {$nfile < 100} { append prefix "0" }
      if {$nfile < 10 } { append prefix "0" }
      append prefix $nfile
      append vtkfilename $prefix      
      incr nfile
      
      # define the vtk file object
      vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter vtkfile
          vtkfile SetInput [ reader GetOutput ]
          vtkfile SetFileName $vtkfilename
          vtkfile Write
          puts " Writing VTK file $vtkfilename for time $tnow"  
          vtkfile Delete

Hi the list,

For contour filter-> Interpolation, you can choose "Gourand".
I think it should be "Gouraud".

libGLU.so and libGL.so are different libraries.  
 
On my RHEL4.4 machines, gcc defaults to compiling 64 bit binaries.  So,
you need to make sure you point to the libraries in /usr/lib64.
Typically, the ldd error message "skipping incompatible ...." means a
32bit vs 64bit incompatibility between the shared object and the
executable being linked.
 
Incidentally, I've had issues with paraview 32bit and using more than
4GB.  No issues at all when compiling with 64bit gcc.

That's very weird. Looks like a Qt problem. Have you used Qt on that machine
before? Can you try playing with qtconfig?

Subject: [Paraview] High order finite element methods
Message-ID: <20060927155203.9960.qmail@web30008.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am using a high order finite element method to simulate fluid flow. The program outputs data in grid structure for each element. Ideally it would be nice to store several structured grids in a single file. With the legacy vtk file format I could not figure out how to do it.

For now I have been converting the data on each element to a global unstructured mesh. Even though it works it is a little clumsy.


Any suggestions are appreciated.

Hi, Berk,  I've only used QT version 3.  I downloaded version 4 specifically 
to use with paraview 2.9.

Hi the list,

It seems that the window geometry is not right saved in the conf file.
Thus, is dimensions are correct, position is always set to +0+0, which I
don't like.

Any suggestion ?

Cheers,

PS : by the way, the paraview window is grey.
I can set the render color window, but not the GUI.
How can I set colors for paraview ?

PS2 : no answer to my old post in concern with zoom in / zoom out  whith
the mouse ? :-(

I see, you have to choose the server state first, and then you can read in a 
dataset.  Thanks.

Peter:

In the general case, you can't browse for data until you're connected to
a server, since it's the server's filesystem that you're browsing.  This
issue doesn't exist on ParaView 2.x since there you must pick the server
when you start the client.  For ParaView 3 we've been kicking-around
some ideas to make the whole connection/browsing process more intuitive.

I fixed it, the problem was that the CaseFileName line edit wasn't being 
populated after choosing the file through the File->Open file browser.  When 
I populated it correctly  the dataset loads.

Support for the extract dataset filter hasn't been implemented yet.
The problem you reported previously about trouble reading ensight files has 
already been fixed.

ParaView 2.4 has it's own branch of VTK. Just update VTK with the
ParaView-2-4-3 tag from CVS.

Message-ID: <451C3FE0.5010000@gmail.com>

Hi the list,

As titled in the subject, Save Session State does not save Outline
colors and title & label colors for
scalar color bar.

Am I doing something wrong ?

Message-ID: <64999822-EB75-4728-BEE6-41A0FFB97946@jamstec.go.jp>

Hi All,

I've just begun to use Paraview III.

I have a sequence of vtk files like
   test001.vtk,
   test002.vtk,
   ...
and from these vtk files I want to have a sequence of images (for  
animation) like
   test001.png,
   test002.png,
   ... .
However, I haven't yet found the way to do that with Paraview III.

Could anyone tell me the way to generate a sequence of images with  
Paraview III?

Thank you.
Shigenobu

With ParaView3 (bleeding-edge CVS) you can pick-and-choose binaries at
configure-time, which may-or-may-not be what you want.

Actually, I misunderstood Alan's question in the first place. It is possible
to
make pvclient
if you are using cmake 2.4.X. I tested this on the cvs version of paraview.
It should also work with paraview 2.4.

I am pretty sure we are using oldish (2.2 or earlier sakes alive!)

Ok.
And for geometry/position, any suggestion  ? ;-)
Nobody seems to answer to my post :-(

In fact, it is.

I woudl add : the window geometry is well written in .ParaViewrc conf file.
But it seems it is not well read :-(

Hi the list,

As one can see on this snapshot

http://fredantispam.free.fr/snapshot.png

for a vector field, if "Component" is chosen, "Magnitude" is displayed,
instead of "X", I think. Colors are right, but the title is wrong.
Others components are right.

In fact, the bug appears _after_ saving session state and reloaded it.

Any suggestion ?

Subject: [Paraview] [pv2.5] Contour : invalid data range 
Message-ID: <451EC8B5.4050709@gmail.com>

Hi the list,

Let me explain what I am doing :

First.
a) Open Data -> load an Unstructured Grid data
b) Click on "Generate isolines or isosurfaces." button in the toolbar.
c) That displays
    Input: Ev.vut (XMLUnstrucutredGridReader0)
    Scalars: Ev_scal
    Scalar Range: 0 to 1.708325
    Contour Values: 0.854163

which sounds good.

Now, second.
a) Open Data -> load an Unstructured Grid data
b) Choose Filter -> Outline
c) ** I click on Ev.vut (XMLUnstrucutredGridReader0) **
d) Then I click on "Generate isolines or isosurfaces." button in the
toolbar.
e) That displays
    Input: Ev.vut (XMLUnstrucutredGridReader0)
    Scalars: none             <- ???
    Invalid Data Range    <- ???
    Contour Values: 0.854163

One can notice that Contour Values field is still right.

What does it mean ??

Cheers,

Therefore, if I set up colors for Outline (eg to black, white by
default), click on, for instance, Contour0,
and re-click on Outline0, color is set back to white !

Any suggestion again ?

Thanks in advance.
