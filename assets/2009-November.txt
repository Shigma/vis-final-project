Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Paraview 3.6.1 on cluster (client -

I have to agree with that. We were getting an error similar to this one, i.e.

1/ Load file, showing the wireframe only.
2/ attempt to use openGL to plot a surface
3/ crash very much like the one you describe, with the same traceback.

When using client/server mode and OSMesa with off screen rendering.
The way I fixed it was by rebuilding the Mesa library as the one that
came with CentOS 5 (on x86_64) did not work. Rebuilding the library
from source (Including a couple of dependencies, which might have been
related to the problem, as the latest package for one of the
dependencies is too old) fixed everything and now it works perfectly.

Building Mesa was relatively easy, some of the dependencies were a bit
more difficult, but did not take that long.

I don't use MacPorts. IMHO, it is a completely broken system (at least  
it was when I threw it out the window about 2 years ago).

May I suggest you dump the ParaView plugins that come with OpenFOAM  
and use the ones by Takuya Oshima (http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Tip_Building_ParaView3_With_OpenFOAM_Native_Reader 
) instead? It is faster, more accurate, doesn't link against the huge  
OpenFOAM libraries, is parallel and offers much more GUI features.  
There are two ways of building the the ParaView-native readers: Either  
by modifying the source code, or as plugins.

Hi Michael,

> least it was when I threw it out the window about 2 years ago).

This is the first time I tried mac ports and it worked really well,  
out-of-the-box. No hassles whatsoever. I got gcc-mp-4.3 and also dbus  
and it downloaded all the dependencies and installed things just  
fine.  I even test dbus and it worked correctly.

I cannot access the link that you provided me. It doesnt seem to be

Subject: [Paraview] Select points and pass them to a plugin
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0911010624p60bae523p7b921041c0bf149d@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to write a plugin as a Paraview interface to
vtkLandmarkTransform. The idea is to select three points in data set A and
three points in data set B and pass them to the plugin to perform the
computation.

1) Is the best way to do this to extract the points from the data set using
the Extract Selection filter first? This seems a little bit awkward for the
user.
2) Is there a way to select separate points in a single selection in
Paraview? I tried using "Select Points Through" and then holding CTRL and
doing it again but the selection is simply changed, not appended. As an
example, say I have a ring of points and I want to select 4 points, one at
the top, bottom, left, and right of the ring, but not the points between
them - how would I do this?

Thanks,

David

We're not using git-cvsimport.  The mirror is converted incrementally
from CVS using fromcvs/togit.  We are using it's "-kk" option to remove
CVS keyword replacement values ($Revision: 1.1$ becomes just $Revision$).

I've been tracking several projects with fromcvs/togit for almost two
years.  After the author (quickly!) fixed a couple bugs I discovered
in the first few months of use, it has been very solid.  I've even
re-converted from scratch and obtained the exact same commit sha1s.
It doesn't do cvs tags, but it does do branches very well.

But that only works with a local CVS repository, right?

Yes.  I rsync the repo to the machine where it gets imported.

IIRC there is a "cvssuck" tool to mirror a remote repo over
the pserver protocol.

1) Am not sure but I think you can call Extract Selection filter
internally to get the selection.
2)  Select points on works with CTRL.

Thanks for the response Nehme.

Ah, CTRL does work, you just have to click "Select points on" again before
continuing the selection. Maybe this could be changed so that you can
continue selecting without having to click the selection tool again between
each selection? I know there was some work being done on DEselecting - maybe
this can be added at the same time?

I see the vtkExtractSelection filter, but I have to get a selection from two
separate data sets (corresponding points in the two datasets). Is there a
way to do this?

Thanks,

David

Is there a way to edit or view a custom filter once it has been

Export, Remove, but no "Edit". Is it possible to do this? Or
can/should it be added?

If multi-selection doesn't work on separate data sets, probably
appending the datasets to one dataset (see Append Dataset filter) will
be the solution.

I can't do that though - I need to know which points came from which
data set. Unless I could just assume that the first half of the
appended data set's points came from data set 1 and the second half
came from data set 2. This seems pretty 'hacky' though.

Thanks,

David

Or maybe adding a property on each point in the original datasets to
identify from which dataset it's comming from.

That's not a bad idea - the only "but" is that they must remain
ordered because I need corresponding points. That is, I don't just
need two sets of points, I need two sets of ORDERED points so that the
first point from dataset1 stays corresponded to the first point in
dataset2. Have I explained this clearly? Do the selected points stay
ordered in the order they were selected? Does the Append Dataset
filter maintain the order of the points? i.e. the combined points
would look like
DataSet1 Point1
DataSet1 Point2
DataSet1 Point ... n
DataSet2 Point1
DataSet2 Point2
DataSet2 Point... n

Can anyone else comment if this is a recommended way to do something
like this in Paraview?

Thanks,

David

Hmm... I don't know.
If you don't get a response from someone else, maybe you will have to try it ...

That was an awesome tip!! :-) It worked beautifully, and without much

Hi Elvis

I'm sorry, with this output I can't really debug the problem... I have  
no idea what is going wrong when fixing up the application bundle.  
You'll have to dig into the scripts yourself, or simply use my  
customized version: http://www.sendspace.com/file/nn3o4f which I hope  
works also for other people.

Michael

Currently there isnt' a way to inspect/edit a custom filter directly.
However, you can export the filter as xml and then inspect/edit the
xml if you are familiar with the server manager xmls and then
re-import it in.

I would think this should work as well. I  believe we had (at some
point) logic to detect any new arrays and use those for coloring when
a new filter is created. Feel free to add this to the bug tracker.

I let Marcus comment on the timeframe, as far as the rolling out goes,
the charting changes are certainly going to be major changes in the
ParaView server-manager/client code and hence will be part of a major
release.

This happens for the standard ParaView-3.7.0 application from the cvs  
repository, with no modifications. Have you encountered such a problem  
on the unmodified paraview sources?

So, here's the thing, the first time the app bundle gets built, it  
gives a whole bunch of errors, like the ones that I sent you.  
Afterwards, if I re-run the command sudo make install, the  
ParaView-3.7.0.app file size is only 173.9 MB.

Looking at your file size, it is around 430.1 MB. I recall, even when  
I built it the first time, it was around 430MB.

Any hints on why the file size is so small!!

Best regards,

Elvis

My guess (from the size and the error messages) is that the script  
that should fix up the bundle can't find the Qt frameworks and doesn't  
copy them into your .app bundle.

Upon examining the paraview_OSX_MakeStandAloneBundle.sh script, I find  
that all the Qt framework libraries are not copied into the app bundle.

Is there another environment variable I should potentially specify to  
point to the Qt libraries, or do you have a modified script that will  
copy all the Qt framework libs into the paraview app bundle?

You're correct, the FIRST place it looks is for the system default.   
However, the SECOND  place it looks is the user's area, which OVERRIDES 
the systems default, as best as I can tell.    If HostA is defined in 
the default_servers.pvsc,  the first time it gets loaded it is then 
saved into the  user's local servers.pvsc file.     I need to do more 
testing, but it looks like even if the default.pvsc file is updated, the 
original definition that was saved off in the users area is used.

Just guessing here: What does

grep QT_QTGUI_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH CMakeCache.txt

tell you? Is it an absolute path?

Hi Michael,
			Just a quick question, when using your version of the  
ParaView-3.7.0 reader, why doesn't the rescale data option work.

I am trying to run the OpenFOAM icoFoam cavity case

cd ~/OpenFOAM/elvis-1.6/run/tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam
blockMesh -case cavity
icoFoam -case cavity
pvFoam -case cavity

I just get a single coloured surface, and cannot get the HSV Blue to  
Red colour mapping. It is just stuck at a single colour.

Best regards,

Elvis

Message-ID: <c9adba420911021028h48482734n929ab226e32f2f44@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have created my own filter which has a filename as one of the
properties, e.g. XML is:

8<------------------------------------------------------
	  <StringVectorProperty
						   name="MyFileName"
						   command="SetMyFileName"
						   number_of_elements="1">
		  <FileListDomain name="files"/>
	  </StringVectorProperty>
	
	  <Hints>
		  <Property name="MyFileName" show="1"/>
	  </Hints>
------------------------------------------------------>8

If I try to create a custom filter inside ParaView and expose this
property it is not displayed in the new custom filters properties
panel of the object inspector.

Regards,
Paul

This is a known bug. For now, try adding another bogus property with
FileListDomain as follows. The first one always gets ignored.
<StringVectorProperty name="bogus"
     number_of_elements="1">
     <FileListDomain name="files"/>
</StringVectorProperty>

I think this happened because I didnt set the time step to 0.5. Now it  
is working as described in the OpenFOAM user manual.

On the parafoam compilation issue, I've just deleted cmake-2.9 and  
installed cmake-2.8-rc4. I've deleted the existing ParaView3-bin  
folder, and I'm now creating a new build. This way, we can try to see  
if the whole problem was cause because of cmake-2.9.

Best regards,

Elvis

Hi Michael,
			Did you have to replace the apple default python interpreter, in  
order to facilitate building paraview with MPI support? If I enable  
python and paraview with MPI support, I get some compilation failures,  
and was wondering if I had to have an python interpreter with MPI  
support.

Best regards,

Elvis

No, however you have to make sure that you're consistent. Do you have  
any other Python distribution installed (e.g. through Fink or  
MacPorts)? Make sure that PYTHON_EXECUTABLE, PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and  
PYTHON_LIBRARY refer to the same Python installation. If you are  
compiling with CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT and CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET other  
than the default (e.g. with 10.5 on a 10.6 system) you have to make  
sure that especially PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR refers to the Python.framework  
version in /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.X.sdk (where X is the minor  
version number, e.g. 5 and 6). I'm not sure why I had to do this  
(because the flags -isysroot and -mmacosx-version-min set by  
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT and CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET should take care of  
that), but I also got compilation failures with Python if I didn't do  
this.

Hi,
	So, coming back to the issue with ParaView crashing on start-up,  
cmake-2.9.x the current version from cvs, does not copy the qt  
framework libraries to the app bundle. So I downgraded to cmake-2.8- 
rc4 and rebuild the paraview application from scratch.

This time around, some files from the qt libraries were copied to the  
app bundle, but the paraview app still crashes.

If I go into the app bundle, and try to launch the paraview executable  
from the Paraview-3.7.0.app/MacOS folder, it gives the following error:

Last login: Tue Nov  3 09:48:19 on ttys002
/Applications/ParaView\ 3.7.0.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview ; exit;
Elvis-Dowsons-MacBook-Pro:~ elvis$ /Applications/ParaView\ 3.7.0.app/ 
Contents/MacOS/paraview ; exit;
Qt internal error: qt_menu.nib could not be loaded. The .nib file  
should be placed in QtGui.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/  or in  
the resources directory of your application bundle.
Abort trap
logout



If I look under QtGui.framework/Versions, there is no Current folder,  
so the whole Current/Resources/ subfolder is missing from the app  
bundle.

  I can clearly see that for my qt-4.5.4 installation, the lib/ 
QtGui.framework folder is ok, ...  there is a alias called Current ,  
which points to /Developer/Applications/Qt-4.5/lib/QtGui.framework/ 
Versions/4, which contains the Resources and Headers subfolders.

But this is missing from the app bundle.

The cmake script should have fully copied the version 4 resources and  
header folders, and it is crashing because the Resources were not  
copied over fully.

What should I do?

Best regards,

Elvis

Yes, I also had this problem, and so did others: http://markmail.org/thread/eneuve2yoemzube7

I had to use the patches at the end of the message. Essentially they  
copy the qt_menu.nib to the applications resources folder and create  
an empty qt.conf to prevent loading of image plugins by Qt.

The reason that CMake doesn't copy the whole frameworks is space. It  
tries very hard to only copy things that are actually required to run  
ParaView. All the development files (e.g. header files) is just  
useless junk when it comes to running the program. The qt_menu.nib is  
a recent addition introduced by Qt-Cocoa and hasn't made it into the  
CMake scripts yet.

In my reasonably recent CVS version I can still only export still 
images. I remember once there was a patch posted to write theora movies. 
Has it ever been merged into CVS?

Hi Utkarsh,

 

I have been trying to compile VTKEdge Paraview plugin for 3.6.1 on
windows XP using visual C++ express 2005. The build appears to be
successful (no warnings or errors) however the VTKEdge.dll is not
present in the build directory (only the debug directory created by
VC++). 

 

Previously, I have successfully compiled the same source (Paraview 3.6.1
and VTKEdge) on linux with no issues. I will try the CVS Paraview when I
get a chance and report back. 

 

Thanks,

 

Lucy

Lucy,

 

So you are trying to build VTKEdge with Paraview 3.6.1, is that correct?
Are you sure the build is succeeding? If I am not mistaken, the ParaView
plugin in VTKEdge uses features that were added to CVS ParaView (that
aren't present in 3.6.* releases) and hence it cannot work with 3.6
releases. Try using CVS ParaView.

Hi Berk,

 

Thanks for your reply, 

 

This is a fresh install with neither Qt nor PV having been previously
installed on the system, so I'm fairly sure there are no conflicts. I
compiled 3.6.1 using VC++ just prior to starting the VTKEdge
compilation, with the same CMake version and Qt libraries.

 

Thanks,

 

Lucy

Hi Lucy,

Note: Utkarsh, who wrote all of the ParaView plugins in VTKEdge, is on
vacation for 3 weeks. It is unlikely that you will get a response from
him until he is back.

I don't have a lot of experience with Windows either. Are you sure the
Qt version and the compiler you are using are matching the one ParaView
was compiled with? This has been one of the major source of
compatibility issues in the past.

Hi,

 

I've been trying to compile the VTKEdge Paraview plugin on windows using
VC++ 2005 Express. However, I don't seem to be getting the VTKEdge.dll
appearing in my bin dir after install.

It does appear in a release dir which appears in the bin due to the
visual studio compilation, but if I try to link to this in Paraview, I
get an error stating that it is not a valid Qt plugin. 

I have successfully installed the same source on linux, with no issues,
but I have very little experience of windows compilations. I've attached
my CMakeCache.txt in case there's something I might be missing.

 

Can anyone help?

 

Thanks in advance,

Dominik,

CVS HEAD does not contain theora support (the only trace is a
find-FFMPEG-theora macro in ParaView3/VTK/CMake/FindFFMPEG.cmake). But
you might want to try the patches attached to
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9281
Haven't done myself so far, though.

Karl

Yes, I tried the patches and they work fine, but it becomes inconvenient 
to apply them each time I update the CVS version. What's the problem in 
including them into the latest CVS version? Does anybody have a problem 
with the patches? Michael-> can you please disable the new feature by 
default so it does not potentially break?

Why don't you submit this patch to the cvs repository, 'cos I'm sure  
everyone else will face the same problem!! :-)  Lost 5 to 6 days  
because of this one!! :-)

I didn't have the time so far to clean it up, sorry. I'm doing so now,  
and will then submit to the bug tracker.

I am interested in the plugins for reading cgns and techplot files but they are only available in the Linix binary release, so how to include them in a Mac open source version? Are the sources available?

Subject: [Paraview] Custom filter that contains a filename (Utkarsh
	Ayachit)
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0911030534s3830277bpde8b8fea3c06be60@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I ran across something related which I am not sure if it is a bug or a
feature. I found that when you have multiple file list domains in your
XML, ParaView decides which one is the "main" file (i.e. the one
specified with the --data= flag at the command line or the first file
selected in a reader) by the name of the string attribute which is a
file list domain which is alphabetically first. I found this automatic
behavior a bit bizarre (at least I had the unfortunate cooincidence of
the first additional file list domain I wanted to add being
alphabetically after my "main" file, and the second beginning with Aa,
and the reason for the "main" file switching only for the second one
took me awhile to track down).

Is there a way to manually specify which file should be the main file?
If not, at least I hope this helps someone else.

Cheers,
Christine

There isn't currently. But it should be fairly easy to add a "hint" or
something similar to suggest to the GUI which of the filename
properties is the "main" one. Feel free to add this to the bug
tracker.

My problem is with a filter (i.e. 1 input and 1 output) that requires
a file as well as the input dataset.  The XML I posted works fine for
that filter on its own but if I use the "Tools -> Create Custom
Filter" from the menu inside ParaView and use then choose the filename
as a property it doesn't show up (I'm not writing any code here).  Is
it possible to add a bogus property to a custom filter created with
the ParaView GUI?

Regards,
Paul

Yes, export the custom filter as xml then manually edit it. Delete the
custom filter from paraview and then import the edited one.

Ok, it works for me by repeating the "ExposedProperties" line in the XML file.

There is already a Tecplot reader in CVS ParaView. It is Ascii only
for now. We will have a CGNS reader in the future as well.

Building the VisIt plugin is a non-trivial process, specially on the
Mac. We will clean it up but it will probably take a little while.

Yes this is a known issue. VTK's support of n-faced elements is
somewhat limited I am afraid. Improving it is in our queue but we
didn't get to it yet.

Subject: [Paraview] Ordered xml inputs?
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0911030816r8e266eepd719a80903b645f0@mail.gmail.com>

Are the InputProperties specified in the XML file ordered?

That is, if I do something like this in the VTK filter's RequestData

vtkPolyData * Source = static_cast<vtkPolyData
*>(this->GetExecutive()->GetInputData(0, 0));
vtkPolyData * Target = static_cast<vtkPolyData
*>(this->GetExecutive()->GetInputData(1, 0));

Then in the XML I have this:

      <InputProperty
         name="Source"
         command="AddSourceConnection"
         clean_command="RemoveAllSources">
        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
          <Group name="sources"/>
          <Group name="filters"/>
        </ProxyGroupDomain>
        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
          <DataType value="vtkPolyData"/>
        </DataTypeDomain>
        <Documentation>
          Set the source data set. This data set that will move
towards the target data set.
        </Documentation>
      </InputProperty>

      <InputProperty
         name="Target"
         command="AddInputConnection"
         clean_command="RemoveAllInputs">
        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
          <Group name="sources"/>
          <Group name="filters"/>
        </ProxyGroupDomain>
        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
          <DataType value="vtkPolyData"/>
        </DataTypeDomain>
        <Documentation>
          Set the target data set. This data set will stay stationary.
        </Documentation>
      </InputProperty>

but no where was it specified that Source is input 0 and Target is
input 1. Is the order implied? If so, maybe this is not such a good
idea as it could get confusing if there are other types of properties
(IntVectorProperty, for example) thrown in the mix. I'm assuming the
placement of something like IntVector property does not matter (i.e.
they could be listed before, after, or in between input properties?)
and does not increment the InputProperty counter?

Can anyone comment on this / confirm it is all correct?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot create Deformation field (vector image)
Message-ID: <54eca6a70911030814j26d2b405k7835b38e4b18abd@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a 2D deformation field from a 512*512 .png image using
ITK and the example file: BSplineWarping1.cxx. The deformation field
is stored in a .mhd file and a .raw file.

In paraview (3.6.1 for windows) I open the .mhd file. Next I choose
the calculator filter and type the following expression in the
expression field:

MetaImage_X*iHat+MetaImage_Y*jHat+0*kHat

where MetaImage_X and MetaImage_Y are selected from the Scalars menu.
Next I press apply.

Next I select a glyph filter when standing on the calculator. When I
press apply an empty 3D coordinate system appears without any
deformation vectors.

When I press the Information tab in the Glyph filter I can see that:

Data Arrays:

Name             Data Type      Data Ranges
MetaImage      float              [-inf, -1e+38], [-inf, -1e+38]
GlyphVector    float              [ 1e+38, -1e+38], [ 1e+38, -1e+38],
[ 1e+38, -1e+38]

Could this maybe have something to do with the lack of deformation vectors?

Or are paraview not compatible with deformation fields created with ITK?

There are two ways:

1> Use attribute "port_index" on the InputProperty to specify which
input port it's going to eg.

<InputProperty name="Source" port_index="0" command="AddInputConnection" ... />

<InputProperty name="Target" port_index="1" command="AddInputConnection" ... />

2> Use helper methods defined on the filter eg.
      void AddSource(vtkAlgorithmOutput* input) {
this->AddInputConnection(0, input); }
      void AddTarget(vtkAlgorithmOutput* input) {
this->AddInputConnection(1, input); }

   And use these as the command's for your two input properties.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0911030957n2c6f7fe5tc5049ecc3d62b1dd@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the procedure to generate what I'm claiming is a problem:

1) Add a cone source
2) Use "Select Points Through" to select a point of the cone
3) Apply the ExtractSelection filter. The ExtractSelection1 object now has 1
Point and 1 Cell on the Information tab of the Object Inspector.
4) File->Save State. Save the state as test.pvsm
5) close paraview
6) open paraview
7) load test.pvsm through File->Load State

The ExtractSelection1 object in the pipeline now has 0 cells and 0 points.
Is this the expected behavior? If so, can someone explain it?

Thanks,

David

That's a big. When the extract selection panel was designed, we lost
the code which registered the selection source proxy, consequently it
doesn't get save in the state file.
I've added a bug report:

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0911031016t6807fcd4r2a276d5080bb7db6@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the procedure to generated the issue:

1) Add a cone source
2) Use select points on to select on of the points. (
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/Selection/setup.png)
3) zoom in to the point you selected. You will see that it is not actually
on the corner where it should be (
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/Selection/surface.png). Why is
this?
4) Change the cone's representation from 'surface' to 'points'. You will see
that the two points do not coincide. (same problem as in #3)
5) Change the point size. You will see that the white point gets bigger, but
the selected (pink)point is still very small (
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/Selection/pointsize.png). Is there
a way to change this? Shouldn't it be changing the color of the actual point
anyway instead of adding a new point?

Any thoughts on this?

Thanks,

David

Hi Eric,

My plan is to integrate at least some of the new charts during November, such 
as XY charts, scatter, bar. They will enter CVS head, and as Utkarsh said 
would be integrated probably into the next major release of ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Interpretation of histogram of deformation field
	magnitude?
Message-ID: <54eca6a70911031715q65ae1039w7d0cce1b2064801e@mail.gmail.com>

I have loaded a deformation field (.mhd file) in paraview made with itk:

1) open .mhd file
2) connect the calculate and use the below expression:

  MetaImage_X*iHat+MetaImage_Y*jHat+0*kHat

3) Add glyph filter.

The result looks like this:

http://37133.vs.webtropia.com/apache2-default/test/deform.png


But now I would like to create a histogram over the magnitude of the
deformation field. I have therefore selected: Filters->Data
Analysis->Histogram.

In the display tab I have selected GlypVector_total (Magnitude) and
under "User Data Array" I have selected MetaImage. The result looks
like this:

http://37133.vs.webtropia.com/apache2-default/test/hist.png

But how should it be interpretated? I assume that the y-axis is the
pixel count and the x-axis is the magnitude size. But should the
magnitudes (Norm) not always be positive?

And as can be seen from the deformation field its only a small part of
the image that is deformed. I would therefore expect a large number of
pixels to have 0 magnitude, but that is not the case.

Any input are welcome!

Subject: [Paraview] Implementing an "Interactive Reader"
Message-ID: <4AF13B99.4050500@fz-juelich.de>

Hi,

I would like to write a reader plugin which allows some kind of
interaction: after reading the whole dataset (which is particle data and
will be mapped to a imagedata), the user should be able to select a
volume of interest. Thereupon, the reader has to reread the dataset and
map it to the imagedata with the new extent. I don't want to use the
"create subset" filter, because I don't want the VOI to be of a lower
resolution.
Any ideas how I could use a box-widget to specify a volume of interest
and cause the reader to reread the data mapping it to the new imagedata?

Thanks in advance,
Sonja

On the properties panel for the Histogram filter, you choose the array
to generate histogram from. Currently the panel doesn't not support
selecting the magnitude of a vector array (only 1 component). In your
case, by default the 0th component of the GlyphVector is chosen, which
can be negative and hence the plot.

To generate a histogram for the magnitude of the vector, apply another
calculator with the expression:

mag(GlyphVector)

and then generate a histogram using the "Result" array.

Another thing I forgot to mention - there seems to be significant
z-fighting happening between the selected (pink) point and the actual
(white) point. That is, when I interact with the object (for example
rotate), if I stop the interaction, about half of the time the point
will be pink and the other half it will be white. This causes
significant confusion because there is no way to know if the point is
actually selected. Is anyone else having this type of issue lately?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Tecplot > Paraview error
Message-ID: <4AF1805A.6040801@hybridsolutions.nl>

Hello,
Attached is the tout.tp file which is a tough2 file converted with a 
program called ext. This program produces files that can be read by 
Tecplot.
I tried to load the file in Paraview with the VisItReaderPlugin loaded. 
I was told that with this plugin Tecplot files can be read.
It does not work and produces an error message. Does anybody have an 
idea why that is?
The error message says that there is an error in line 386 of the 
vtkVisItDatabase.cxx
Thanks,  Johan

if you change your header to:

Variables = "X", "Y", "P", "T", "SG", "SW", "X1", "X2", "PCAP", "DG", "DW"
Zone N=100, E=81, F=FEPOINT, ET=QUADRILATERAL

You should be able to read this file. I guess.

Good luck.

Yes, I can confirm this issue.
And this seems to be a relatively new, cause ParaView 3.4 (released in
Oct, 2008)
didn't show this behaviour (contrary to the current release (3.6.1)
and the latest cvs-code).

Did you make a Bug Report?

No, typically I like someone to confirm the problem before I make a
bug report. I'll create the report now.

Utkarsh, is this part of the same issue with the new extract selection
panel? Can we get a guess at an expected completion date just for
information sake? Sometimes I will proceed differently if I know the
problem will be fixed tomorrow vs next month.

Thanks,

David

David,

I wouldn't think this has anything to do with the changes to the
panel, and more with the coincident topology resolution choices we
made. But I cannot understand why the two points would not be
displaced by the same value -- that needs some debugging. As far as
the time estimate goes, it's really hard to tell right now, but I'd
think we can aim at this for 3.8 which is due early next year.

Please add it to the bug tracker so we don't loose track of it.

Hm, I tried the port_index method, but it still crashes when run from
Paraview. My filter works fine from c++ (see Example.cxx). Would you
mind taking a look to see if you can find the discrepancy between how
I setup the pipeline in the c++ code vs in the XML? One thing I
noticed is that in the Input Editor that opens when I begin to apply
the plugin, the input ports are not listed in the same (correct) order
as they are in the xml (specified by port_index). Could that point to
the problem? If so, why is it happening?

Ah, sorry about that. Unfortunately users cannot edit bug reports (can
this be changed?).

Thanks,

I have no Idea about that.
But Adding a Link to the bug-report, referring to this thread (eg
<http://markmail.org/thread/hj6qkllhvwnmpqrr>), might be helpful.

thx in advance.

vtkTecplotReader is now ready for use via ParaView.

The 'Variables' and 'Zone' sections / lines need to be changed as Hom
suggested. This is a zone of type "Finite Element Data" in Tecplot term (or
vtkUnstructuredGrid). The number of nodes (points, 100), number of elements
(cells, 81), and the elements (cells) type, "ET=QUADRILATERAL", need to be
explicitly provided in the zone header line.

The original zone line, "I=100 J=81", would be parsed as an ordered zone
(corresponding to vtkStructuredGrid) which would be assumed to have (100 -
1) x (81 - 1 ) cells, causing the loading error.

Please replace file extension 'tp' with 'tec', or update the latest
ParaViewReaders.xml (which supports file extension 'tp') and this ASCII file
can be loaded in ParaView directly via vtkTecplotReader.

As of right now, vtkTecplotReader is a simplified version of the ASCII file
reader and more functionalities may be added if necessary. For any problem
with this reader, please feel free to let me know.

Thanks to Hom for the help.

Thanks.

David,

I had a short glance at your code and there are two things I find intriging:

1) Your XML mixes the port_index="." and helper method approach for property
SourceDataSet:

      <InputProperty
         name="SourceDataSet"
         port_index="2"
         command="AddSourceConnection"
         clean_command="RemoveAllSources">

You'll have to change the command to "AddInputConnection", in particular because
method AddSourceConnection is merely declared in your *.h file, but there is
nowhere any corresponding code for it. (It's not inherited from class
vtkPolyDataAlgorithm.)

2) Same holds for the clean command: RemoveAllSources() is referenced in the
XML, declared in the header file, but not defined. Whereas RemoveAllInputs() is
inherited from class vtkAlgorithm.

Sven

Subject: [Paraview] Improving vtkDataArraySelection ... and a question of
 the general philosophy
Message-ID: <1257348093.31672.113.camel@auglx106.zeunastaerker.de>

I was looking at making some minor tweaks to vtkDataArraySelection and
started wondering why some things are being done the way they are.

First off I'll explain what I wanted.
I'd like an additional method

    int AddArray(const char* name, int defaultStatus);

The behaviour is as per AddArray(const char*), but with the ability to
specify which default status should be used when it is created.
[
  I really cannot figure out a workaround for adding an array
  entry with an unselected state that doesn't automatically
  trigger this->Modified();
]


Then the questions begin:
The method probably doesn't exist in that form since nobody thought they
needed it. However, it could also be that having multiple signatures is
frowned upon in VTK. Or are there problems with binding to other
languages?
Having said that, the methods are surrounded by a BTX/ETX pair so
wrapping may not be the problem, but I'm not sure.

After taking a slightly closer look, I also noticed that the internals
use a vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::string> and a vtkstd::vector<int> for the
storage.

If there is a std::string under the hood, is there any other reason
(beyond language wrapping) that we have everything with (const char*)
parameters instead of (const vtkstd::string&)?

Is it only historical that a vtkstd::vector<int> is used for storing a
bool state? Or is there a desire to avoid the std::vector<bool>
specialization?


Thanks,

/mark

Ah, sorry, you are correct - those were copy/paste errors!

However, now that those things are fixed
(http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/LandmarkFilter/LandmarkTransformFilter.xml)
when I apply the filter in Paraview and set the inputs using the Input
Editor, I get a whole bunch of these errors:

vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0xa82e288): Input port 0 of algorithm
vtkLandmarkTransformFilter(0xa82e240) has 0 connections but is not
optional.
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0xa82e288): Input port 1 of algorithm
vtkLandmarkTransformFilter(0xa82e240) has 2 connections but is not
repeatable.
etc, etc.

Why would this be?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] So basic operation
Message-ID: <BAY109-W286D54A84955EB88FBED48B2B10@phx.gbl>


My problem seems as simple as 123: I have an elevation image and I want to create a terrain model by taking elevation in the image.
So my idea was to create a plane at the image resolution, then use WarpByScalar to warp it according to the image content.
But WarpByScalar warps according to an a point data scalar field, which requires that I put the image in the point data of the plane and... I did not find the way to do it.
So 2 questions:
  - how to associate a scalar or vector field to an existing geometry set?
  - is it the right way to proceed for my problem?

Yes, I have a question: you wrote "vtkTecplotReader is now ready for use via ParaView" but in which version of ParaView is it included?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Tecplot > Paraview error

vtkTecplotReader is now ready for use via ParaView. 
 
The 'Variables' and 'Zone' sections / lines need to be changed as Hom suggested. This is a zone of type "Finite Element Data" in Tecplot term (or vtkUnstructuredGrid). The number of nodes (points, 100), number of elements (cells, 81), and the elements (cells) type, "ET=QUADRILATERAL", need to be explicitly provided in the zone header line. 

 
The original zone line, "I=100 J=81", would be parsed as an ordered zone (corresponding to vtkStructuredGrid) which would be assumed to have (100 - 1) x (81 - 1 ) cells, causing the loading error.
 
Please replace file extension 'tp' with 'tec', or update the latest ParaViewReaders.xml (which supports file extension 'tp') and this ASCII file can be loaded in ParaView directly via vtkTecplotReader.

 
As of right now, vtkTecplotReader is a simplified version of the ASCII file reader and more functionalities may be added if necessary. For any problem with this reader, please feel free to let me know.
 
Thanks to Hom for the help.
 
Thanks.

if you change your header to:

Variables = "X", "Y", "P", "T", "SG", "SW", "X1", "X2", "PCAP", "DG", "DW"

Zone N=100, E=81, F=FEPOINT, ET=QUADRILATERAL

You should be able to read this file. I guess.

Good luck.

Use "Resample with Dataset" with Input=Image Data and Source=Plane to
associate the height field with the points on the plane. Then you can
apply WarpByScalar.

Why not just run Clean To Grid on the image data?  That will convert it to an unstructured grid that can be directly warped.

elevation image -> Clean To Grid -> Warp By Scalar

Subject: [Paraview] pre processor tough2 geothermal reservoir simulator
Message-ID: <4AF1BB8A.8090503@hybridsolutions.nl>

Hello,

I am using a geothermal reservoir simulator called Tough2. For 
post-processing I use Paraview.
Now I am also looking for an open source pre-processing software that 
can create grids. It has to be flexible since I plan to explicitly model 
natural fractures that are present in the underground reservoirs that 
contain the hot water. Does anyone have a suggestion?

Thanks in advance,

Johan

David,

Looking at the xml, you have added a "clean_command" to all the
properties which is "RemoveAllInputs". CleanCommand is called before a
property is pushed. So before each property value is pushed all other
inputs are removed. And hence the error.

If your filter only takes 1 connection per input port, then simply
replace all AddInputConnection commands by SetInputConnection and
remove the clean_command attribute all together. I've attached a
modified xml.

Ah ha! Fantastic, it's working now, thanks all.

I have added a handful of things I've learned along the way to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo if someone wants to look it
over for clarity/correctness etc.

Thanks again,

Hi all

I cleaned up the patches and modified them such that the Ogg/Theora  
libraries and writer only compile when explicitly desired.

You can find the patches here: http://github.com/themiwi/ParaView/tree/patches/OggTheoraWriter

Please note that further fixes will be committed to the master branch  
and will then get squashed into the patches/OggTheoraWriter branch,  
which will be rebased onto current cvshead at the same time.

Rick,
It sure looks wrong to me.  I did as you said -
* Deleted my local .config/ParaView/servers.pvsc file.
* Ran ParaView, connected to a remote server, then closed ParaView.  
  - This read in my default_servers.pvsc file
  - Wrote out a new local .config/ParaView/servers.pvsc file.
* I then changed one of the options to be wrong in the users servers.pvsc file.  (I used max NODES, which should obviously be from the system default_servers.pvsc).  This information was still correct in the default_server.pvsc file.
* Upon rerunning ParaView, the wrong information was picked up from the servers.pvsc file.


What would be the correct behavior?  We want to always use the default value from the user's servers.pvsc file, but we want to use all of the other variables from the default_servers.pvsc file.  Right?

I think that depends on several factors:
- 2D or 3D
- Rectilinear grid or structured grid (like Finite Difference grids)
or unstructured grids (like Finite Element Meshes)
- Location also helps (If you are in US you can use several softwares
developed US laboratories  :))

good luck!

Hom,

The attached file contains 3D data. The header also has to be changed. I 
tried something simular as explained for the other file but it seems to 
be a bit more complicated.
Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Johan

What do you mean by complicated? Your attached data is 2D. If you have
3D data with brick elements i.e. similar to hexahedron you can just
set ET=BRICK.

good luck

Alan, yes, you've demonstrated the problem I found with the pvsc 
files.    It's a difficult problem:

Ideally, we want to provide
1.  Global server connection definitions
2.  User-defined server connection definitions
3.  the ability save persistent information (username, remote shell 
executable, ProjectID, etc, etc) as defined by the pvsc definition
4.  Update the global connection definition and have it override any 
previous definition

I think that it's a slightly larger issue than just managing variables 
that may exist between the user copy of the definition and the global 
copy - we need to provide the capability to drop in a totally new global 
pvsc file and have it override anything that may have been saved 
locally.   For instance, we just switched our queuing system from LSF to 
PBS and the entire pvsc file changed.  Ideally,  when the new global 
server definition was dropped into the place, the user copy for that 
server would be totally replaced by the new definition.

Hi John:

    I am also confused with what "more complicated" means. I just now loaded
the dataset into ParaView and it works fine. As Hom mentioned, it is still a
2D dataset.

    Can you explain your question in detail?

   Thanks.

It sounds like the major problem is that ParaView is taking the server connection configurations from the system files and writing them in the servers.pvsc configuration file the first time it encounters them, where they forever override any changes to the system files.  I believe this behavior was introduced to save the user's last entries for the parameters as the default for the next invocation (bug #5487).

This is an important feature, but perhaps this is not the best way to implement it.  Perhaps ParaView should be saving the server connection argument parameters in the regular settings key/value file.  That way you could leave the system server settings in the system files and nothing would override them.  Does that sound like the right thing?

Johan:

   The format of your file is invalid, specifically the zone header. There
are some other parameters neglected. Please refer to
http://download.tecplot.com/360/dataformat.pdf, beginning page 151, to find
more info about what a zone header needs to provide to define the dataset
properly.

   Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] outline in parallel

Ah, I figured this out. It is a bug in vtkPVGeometryFilter. When it is
creating outlines for multi-block datasets, it is not doing the right
thing when running in parallel. If you look at
vtkPVGeometryFilter::DataSetExecute, it does this to reduce the
bounds.

    if (this->Controller && doCommunicate)
      {
      double tmp[6];
      this->Controller->Reduce(bds, tmp, 6, &operation, 0);
      memcpy(bds, tmp, 6*sizeof(double));
      }

    if (bds[1] >= bds[0] && bds[3] >= bds[2] && bds[5] >= bds[4])
      {
      // only output in process 0.
      this->OutlineSource->SetBounds(bds);
      this->OutlineSource->Update();

      output->SetPoints(this->OutlineSource->GetOutput()->GetPoints());
      output->SetLines(this->OutlineSource->GetOutput()->GetLines());
      }

 Whereas for composite datasets, it simply iterates over blocks and
creates outlines for them. The right thing to do is to have all
processes iterate over all leaf nodes (without skipping empty ones)
and call DataSetExecute with doCommunicate == 1.

Please submit a bug report or even better a patch :-)

Seems to me that we really want ParaView to do the following:
* Read server connection information from a system level file.
* Read server connection information from a user level file.  This information shall not override anything read in from the system level file. (Do we even need this file?)
* Read in the user's default connection information from a user level file.
* Allow the user to edit the server information. (Do we even need this step?)

* When ParaView finishes, write out the current server information (from the system level and the user level) into a user level file.  (Do we even need this?)
* Write preferences into a preferences file.

Thoughts?

It sounds like the major problem is that ParaView is taking the server connection configurations from the system files and writing them in the servers.pvsc configuration file the first time it encounters them, where they forever override any changes to the system files.  I believe this behavior was introduced to save the user's last entries for the parameters as the default for the next invocation (bug #5487).

This is an important feature, but perhaps this is not the best way to implement it.  Perhaps ParaView should be saving the server connection argument parameters in the regular settings key/value file.  That way you could leave the system server settings in the system files and nothing would override them.  Does that sound like the right thing?

Alan, yes, you've demonstrated the problem I found with the pvsc
files.    It's a difficult problem:

Ideally, we want to provide
1.  Global server connection definitions
2.  User-defined server connection definitions
3.  the ability save persistent information (username, remote shell
executable, ProjectID, etc, etc) as defined by the pvsc definition
4.  Update the global connection definition and have it override any
previous definition

I think that it's a slightly larger issue than just managing variables
that may exist between the user copy of the definition and the global
copy - we need to provide the capability to drop in a totally new global
pvsc file and have it override anything that may have been saved
locally.   For instance, we just switched our queuing system from LSF to
PBS and the entire pvsc file changed.  Ideally,  when the new global
server definition was dropped into the place, the user copy for that
server would be totally replaced by the new definition.

Subject: [Paraview] Losing data during clip by scalar
Message-ID: <4EEA6C54-CE15-4C72-893A-54AA9DFA06FA@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I'm running into another bug where I'm losing scalar arrays when using  
a clip filter -- this time when clipping by a scalar (before it was on  
clipping multi-block data, fixed by Utkarsh on May 6, 2009). It seems  
to happen on both PV 3.6.1 binary and yesterday's CVS.

To reproduce:
Create Sphere Source
Elevation filter
Curvature filter
Clip by Scalar on Elevation = 0.5 (or on Gauss_Curvature = 4)

The Gauss_Curvature point data disappears.

I think no matter what, the last scalar added to the data disappears,  
which is similar to what was happening when clipping multi-block before.

Has anyone else noticed this? (I'll attach a python trace to run in  
case that makes it easier to test.)

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Also losing scalar arrays on Generate Ids
Message-ID: <BA989624-40DF-4FB4-8CB4-84F46AC9FDC2@cs.duke.edu>

Hello again,

I seem to be misplacing a lot of scalar arrays today...

Generate Ids also seems to strip off the most recently generated  
scalar point data (like clip-by-scalar that I just sent to the list).  
It doesn't remove a recently generated set of point vectors, just  
scalars. (Again, with yesterday's CVS as well as 3.6.1 mac binary)

Reproduce like the last one:
Sphere source
Elevation Filter
Curvature
Generate Ids

And Gauss_Curvature disappears. If you throw in a Random Vectors  
between the Curvature and Generate Ids, Gauss_Curvature is still the  
array that disappears, not BrownianVectors.

(John Biddiscombe said he had this happen once when a filter called  
SetActiveScalars() without calling AddArray() first, then when another  
filter called SetActiveScalars() it removed the first one...)

Again, please let me know if this is just me for some reason...

Thanks,
-Eric

Alan - I think that you do want to allow the user to create their own 
connection definitions files, so you need to maintain the functionality 
of item #2 & item #4. Maybe there's a check to make sure that the 
user-defined connection is not the same name as system-defined 
connection (thus won't overwrite?). Or, better yet, differentiate the 
connections with something like "User:BigRedCluster" and 
"Global:BigRedCluster" depending on where the definition was read from?

Sorry, I was not able to understand that.
Do they remain your personal patches or are being merged into CVS?

Subject: [Paraview] Branding: Active element w/o pipeline browser
Message-ID: <6659DC66-3D72-4DC7-9731-706A7D442FA8@cs.duke.edu>

Hey,

I've finally started taking a closer look at the new ParaView  
"Branding" (off of Utkarsh's git repository), and first of all I'd  
like to say that you have done an amazing job so far! This is going to  
make it so much easier to create custom-built PV-based applications.

I was looking at the Clone2 CustomApplication example  
(paraview_revised_2 app) which has a lot of standard PV, but doesn't  
include the pipeline browser. This is interesting to me because I  
think there will be cases when my users will want as simple an  
interface as possible, so I was wondering whether one function of the  
Pipeline Browser could be reproduced in another way:

If there is only a single data set loaded, with a linear pipeline,  
then the most recently applied filter/data is shown in the Object  
Inspector, and it's easy to change display parameters. If there are  
multiple data sets loaded, each with some filters applied, then  
without a Pipeline Browser there is no way to switch back and forth  
between the two currently displayed representations (if that is the  
right term) to change their display parameters, or add new filters to  
their branch of the pipeline.

Is there some natural way of adding another selection mode or tool  
that would let you click on an object in the 3D render view and it  
would make that representation (pipeline element) the active one, just  
like you can by clicking on an element in the Pipeline Browser?

Thanks again for all the nice work,
-Eric

So far, they are still my personal patches. I just cleaned them up and  
now maintain them in the mentioned GIT branch because I don't want to  
attach them to the bug-tracker all the time.

Of course it's not you. Perhaps I didn't explain well to the other developers, but when someone made significant changes to the ActiveScalars code a few years ago, the SetActiveScalars was added to do what it says, but it is not used correctly the filters were upgraded. There are literally dozens of filters in vtk which call SetActiveScalars at the end of execute to set some array, but they are lost as soon as they are passed into another filter which does the same.

It's a design flaw. The correct fix is to AddScalars inside SetActiveScalars and then make them active. Someone needs to peek into the code to double check exactly what's wrong as I'm doing this from memory. In my filters I always addScalars first and do not have this trouble.

JB
________________________________________


(John Biddiscombe said he had this happen once when a filter called
SetActiveScalars() without calling AddArray() first, then when another
filter called SetActiveScalars() it removed the first one...)

Again, please let me know if this is just me for some reason...

How about something like the "Statistics View" in ParaView? Depending
on your application, may be just a flat list showing the pipeline
objects may suffice.

Hey Utkarsh, thanks for the reply.

I think if we had something like the Statistics View it may as well  
just be the Pipeline Browser. I was hoping for something that could be  
done through just interacting with the render view.

Right now, say I have multiple data sets loaded, each with a filter  
applied. If I select cells or points on one of the objects in the  
render view, then that item becomes the active one in the pipeline  
browser. What I was thinking of was something like this but a tool  
where you are not really selecting cells or points, but when you click  
on an object in the render view it makes that particular item the  
active one so you can adjust filter and display parameters. The system  
could be looking for a simple click (rather than a click-drag  
navigation cue) to perform this action.

Thanks for your time,
-Eric

P.S. In general I would like to see more ways to interactively probe/ 
query the data directly in the view, but I'll try to expand on that  
through uservoice...

I am extremely interested in your idea but have no experience in writing 
filters and loading them inthe calculator.
This set of simple data illustrates my problem
Questions:
1- What does ^@ mean?
2-What does ^A mean?
The mesh contains 61 vertices, vertices 0-4 have no meaning that I can 
tell, the same for vertices 56-60.
How can I convert this table to a simpliler table with only the values:
"Density","Pressure","Mach","K","Epsilon","LogFR","Temperature","Velocity","Velocity","Velocity","Vorticity","Vorticity","Vorticity","original_coordinates","original_coordinates","original_coordinates","arc_length"
The csv data was written on my workstation, PV 3.4.0 was executing with 
4 cpus.
Thanks,
Stephen

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Paraview 3.6.1 on cluster (client -
	server mode)
In-Reply-To: <C70F52BB.12A61%kmorel@sandia.gov>
References: <766e07b20910280116h2e0cafa2h15b9842cd01bc4b8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ken, thanks again.

we recompiled again OSMesa library (only on the master node of our cluster;
the libraries file are generated on a shared folder -
/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib - visible on each node), then we
recompiled Paraview with these libraries (and setting shared libraries=off
in ccmake menu); now we are able to connect the client with pvserver
provided that pvserver runs only on the master node.

If we run pvserver on two or more nodes with the command:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib -np 2
-machinefile NodesList pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we always get the usual error when we try to connect the client with the
server

Must X server run on each node? Currently X server is not running on any
node (if we execute "pidof X" we obtain nothing) and DISPLAY variable is not
set, but we can connect the client with the master node...

Have you any idea? Can you help us?

Thank you very much
Luis

Subject: [Paraview] problem with parallel filter,
	segfault after last process returns
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0911060934q674f9985t269d7489fd5d9f72@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm converting my serial filters to work in parallel. In this process,
I'm run into trouble at the very last stage, after verifying that at
every stage, on every processor,  that correct data was being
sent/received, and that the final output was identical to the
algorithm as run in serial.

The entire method runs as planned, but immediately after returning
from the RequestData method on processes 0 (the last one to return as
I have process 0 receiving data sent by other processes, and perform a
final computation). I get a segfault:
"*** Process received signal ***
 Signal: Segmentation fault (11)
Signal code:  (128)
Failing at address: (nil)"

I initially thought this had something to do with the way I am using
the output vector. So as a test, I simply copy the input to the output
before doing all my computations taking into account the controller,
check these computations at every step, but actually ignore their
output in the end

pseudocode for my test
RequstData:
1. copy input to output
2. if there's a controller specified and number of processors>1,
perform parallel computation using controller, otherwise perform
serial computation. I don't actually store the result
3. Return

The segfault is not present on returning if I comment out all code in
step 2, or if the algorithm is run in serial. I know the segfault
happens after RequestData returns on process  Since in this test case,
all computations in 2. are local with no results written to output, I
am not sure what is going on. Do I need to do something special to
"shutdown" the controller? My destructor uses
vtkCxxSetObjectMacro(vtkCenterOfMassFilter,Controller,
vtkMultiProcessController);
via
this->SetController(0);
but the segfault is still present if I comment this out. My controller
was set in the constructor via
this->SetController(vtkMultiProcessController::GetGlobalController());

This makes me think that something is writing beyond the bounds of an
array corrupting memory. Any chance you can run this within valgrind?

Berk, Burlen,

Yes this was exactly what was happening. I had allocated too small of
a buffer to receive a piece of data, which corrupted memory and was
only a problem on returning the function. Doh!; I was looking for
bigger issues when it was basic.

Cheers,
Christine

Message-ID: <200911071647063753761@qq.com>

vtkPolyDataNormals Class Reference says:

Triangle strips are broken up into triangle polygons. You may want to restrip the triangles.

How should I restrip the triangles without lost the normal informations?

thank you for any suggestions!

Message-ID: <BAY109-W20AFC0FA362775FB042BA8B2AD0@phx.gbl>


My problem is I have a Fluent data file with extension .cas and this file is not displayed in the list of available files if I select Fluent in the list.
I have another file that is detected though, so I wonder if PV reads the header of all files suspected of being read before decidig to offer them as valid choices to the user? Or is the issue anywhere else?

Eric,

That's the beauty of custom apps :). Although ParaView doesn't not
allow the user the change the active source/filter by clicking on it
in the render view, in your custom app, you can surely employ the
selection mechanism to determine which filter was selected and then
make it the active one.

Subject: [Paraview] Improving vtkDataArraySelection ... and a question
of the general philosophy
To: ParaView <paraview at paraview.org>


I was looking at making some minor tweaks to vtkDataArraySelection and
started wondering why some things are being done the way they are.

First off I'll explain what I wanted.
I'd like an additional method

? ?int AddArray(const char* name, int defaultStatus);

The behaviour is as per AddArray(const char*), but with the ability to
specify which default status should be used when it is created.
[
?I really cannot figure out a workaround for adding an array
?entry with an unselected state that doesn't automatically
?trigger this->Modified();
]


Then the questions begin:
The method probably doesn't exist in that form since nobody thought they
needed it. However, it could also be that having multiple signatures is
frowned upon in VTK. Or are there problems with binding to other
languages?
Having said that, the methods are surrounded by a BTX/ETX pair so
wrapping may not be the problem, but I'm not sure.

After taking a slightly closer look, I also noticed that the internals
use a vtkstd::vector<vtkstd::string> and a vtkstd::vector<int> for the
storage.

If there is a std::string under the hood, is there any other reason
(beyond language wrapping) that we have everything with (const char*)
parameters instead of (const vtkstd::string&)?

Is it only historical that a vtkstd::vector<int> is used for storing a
bool state? Or is there a desire to avoid the std::vector<bool>
specialization?


Thanks,

/mark

The choice works like this:

ParaView has an internal list for the initial file extension to reader mapping.
The default list is in
Qt/Components/Resources/XML/ParaViewReaders.xml. When you load a
reader type plugin that list is extended by any new extensions from
the reader's xml.
When there is more than one reader that recognizes the same file
extension, the reader that comes last in the list is used, or more
specifically tried, first.
I say tried because readers _can_ have a CanReadFile method, in which
the reader snoops the file to determine if it really can read it. If
that call returns false, the next reader gets a chance and so on.

coordinates inside a filter?

Thanks, does this mean that I should subscribe and post there, or just cross-post from here (Paraview)?

Subject: [Paraview] output vs input representation parameters
Message-ID: <OFB89C4EAC.C700F4D4-ONC1257669.00512EE2-C1257669.0052574C@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hi,

This topic has already been mentionned in this mailing list, but I would 
like to bring it up once again : 
Would it be possible to modify the strategy used to determine which 
representation is created by default when a filter is applied and a new 
representation is created? 
The idea would be, when possible, to create a representation that is the 
same as the one of the input.
Users find it very difficult to understand that the representation always 
swtiches back to a default representation each time they apply a filter.
Some parameters seems to have been hard-coded to be copied, but it does 
not work with plugins (such as the point sprite plugin...).

Is it possible to 
1/ modify the strategy so that the output representation is by default the 
same as the input, when possible.
2/ copy all parameters of the representation by iterating over all 
properties of the represesentation proxy, so that all those properties are 
copied. This should work for plugins too.

Best,
Stephane

I mean I would like for instance to have my surface colored by a function of u, u being the value of the parametric coordinate, given an origin on the surface.
BTW using parametric coordinates in a filter would require having these parametric coordinates available, which, for an arbitrary surface, would involve computing it, so this is the same problem: how to compute those parametric coordinates?

Should I understand your answer, esp. the CanReadFile Method, as follows: my fluent file with extension .cas may be corrupt and since there are several formats with .cas extension, the CanReadFile method associated with all of these formats returned false and them the file name disappeared from the list?

Ah, I understand. There is no general solution to this problem in
VTK/ParaView. Texture coordinates is probably closest. You can look at
Texture map to ... filters. Essentially, you need to write a filter
that computes the parametric coordinates for the kind of surface you
are interested it.

In general yes.

In this instance, the only standard reader for ".cas" files is
vtkFLUENTReader. Unless you've loaded some plugin then,
vtkFLUENTReader is what considers your file to be corrupt.

I think your best bet is to provide u and v at the reader as a attribute array.

I could be wrong (I'm not a topology or meshing expert) but I don't
think it is possible to in general provide a u,v mapping for arbitrary
shapes. If it is possible, it would be great to have the algorithm
coded up as a filter in VTK.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.6.x connection definition files
In-Reply-To: <4AF326B1.6040307@arl.army.mil>
Message-ID: <C71D8726.EAF3%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I've submitted a bug on this issue:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9866

Please take a look at it and see if it and the suggested solution addresses the problem.

Alan - I think that you do want to allow the user to create their own
connection definitions files, so you need to maintain the functionality
of item #2 & item #4. Maybe there's a check to make sure that the
user-defined connection is not the same name as system-defined
connection (thus won't overwrite?). Or, better yet, differentiate the
connections with something like "User:BigRedCluster" and
"Global:BigRedCluster" depending on where the definition was read from?

Message-ID: <CE16AAB7-8EC8-4129-B0D1-D16002EE22C3@cs.duke.edu>

Hey,

(Note: I'm looking at this in the context of PV branding, but I'm not  
sure whether the implementation details depend on that or not.)

When an app is initialized, how would you build a toolbar and its view  
menu item, but have the visibility in the view menu start as  
"unchecked", so it exists, but isn't shown unless the user wants to  
see it?

Thanks,
-Eric

Questions:
1- What does ^@ mean?
2-What does ^A mean?

These values, in the vtkValidPointMask column, are bit flags that were originally stored in ParaView in a char array.  When writing out the file, the CSV writer (incorrectly) assumed that these were ASCII characters and so wrote the bits out directly to the file rather than converting them to numbers.  I consider this a bug, so I submitted a bug report on it (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9869).

(The actual meanings of the values depend on how your terminal or editor converts these non-visible character values, but in this case I think it is pretty clear that ^@ is representing the character 0 and ^A is representing the character 1.)

The mesh contains 61 vertices, vertices 0-4 have no meaning that I can
tell, the same for vertices 56-60.

They in fact probably have no meaning at all.  When you ran the Plot Over Line filter, the plot probably extended past the ranges of the mesh (which is common).  When the plot over line filter encounters samples outside of the mesh, it marks it as invalid in the vtkValidPointMask and writes dummy values for the fields.

How can I convert this table to a simpliler table with only the values:
"Density","Pressure","Mach","K","Epsilon","LogFR","Temperature","Velocity","Velocity","Velocity","Vorticity","Vorticity","Vorticity","original_coordinates","original_coordinates","original_coordinates","arc_length"

The easiest way is to simply bring the data into a spreadsheet program like Excel, delete the offending columns, and save the data back out.

The csv data was written on my workstation, PV 3.4.0 was executing with
4 cpus.

I recommend updating to PV 3.6.  The table and CSV support has been improved (especially for importing CSV files).

By "usual error" do you mean the crash in the GL or pthreads library?  It could be that the environment in the non-master nodes is incorrect.

Hi ken, thanks again.

we recompiled again OSMesa library (only on the master node of our cluster; the libraries file are generated on a shared folder - /home/user/ParaView/Components/lib - visible on each node), then we recompiled Paraview with these libraries (and setting shared libraries=off in ccmake menu); now we are able to connect the client with pvserver provided that pvserver runs only on the master node.

If we run pvserver on two or more nodes with the command:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib -np 2 -machinefile NodesList pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we always get the usual error when we try to connect the client with the server

Must X server run on each node? Currently X server is not running on any node (if we execute "pidof X" we obtain nothing) and DISPLAY variable is not set, but we can connect the client with the master node...

Have you any idea? Can you help us?

Thank you very much

(Responding back to the ParaView list.)

These symbols should be defined in the GL library that is part of Mesa.  You should have a library like /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so.  That is where the symbols should be defined.  libOSMesa.so simply references those libraries.  It is because the symbols cannot be found in the GL library that you are getting the error.  You can use the 'nm' command to query what symbols are defined are what are required.

It sounds like you are still linking to the system OpenGL libraries somehow.  Those symbols should be defined in the libGL.so that is built with Mesa (whereas the /usr/lib/libGL.so on your system probably does not have them).


Hi Ken,
thanks again.

Looking the errors such as:

"home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_free_context_data'"

I believe those symbols must be defined in libOSMesa.so library and not in /usr/lib/libGL.so library.

In fact, if we install OSMessa using Debian packages we can compile ParaView, but we can't connect client and server; the error always is similar to:

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

*** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


If instead we compile OSMesa ourselves we can't compile ParaView: I believe that something went wrong compiling OSMesa (some simbols aren't present in libOSMesa.so created), but I don't know if compiling OSMesa ourselves can help us to resolve our problem.

We also tried to install on our cluster ParaView 3.6.1already compiled (downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html) and it works: we can establish client-server connection.

But if we try to run more 2 or more pvserver instances on the same node (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), we have this error:

"vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x23d6da0): Failed to set up server socket"


 Did you do a clean build of ParaView (that is, delete the binary directory and start over from scratch)?  If you just tried to change some CMake variables in an existing build, you may have some stale libraries built.

We did "make clean".

You should also check to make sure that the executables being built are linking to your compiled Mesa libraries instead of the system libraries.  You can check this with the ldd command.  You may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6.

We also tried to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Can you help us?

We compiled Mesa with:

make install

and we configured Paraview with:

Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on each node downloading the .deb packages with:

Have you got any other idea?

Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67

This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

111/475 Testing TestGradientBackground        ***Exception: SegFault

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

If you need more information let us now

Subject: [Paraview] Integrate Variables
Message-ID: <BAY109-W48C127FC3B0C0AE7FF5F0DB2AC0@phx.gbl>


I do not understand how this integration proceeds and I did not find anything else on the Wiki pages except that it is supposed to integrate over a line or a surface. I have created a simple dataset :

vtk output
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 2 2 2
SPACING 1 1 1
ORIGIN 0 0 0
POINT_DATA 8
SCALARS temperature double
LOOKUP_TABLE default
100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170

The filter temperature integration yields 135, which is the mean of the temperature field, not the integration. So how does it work?

Christine,

I'm glad you figured that out.  This is probably unrelated, but I noticed in your original post that you said the Controller was initialized with

this->SetController(vtkMultiProcessController::GetGlobalController());

This is mostly correct, but you need to make sure that you first set the Controller ivar to NULL in your constructor so that the SetController method understands that there is nothing set currently and that it does not attempt to unreference a non-existent controller.

this->Controller = NULL;
this->SetController(vtkMultiProcessController::GetGlobalController());

Yes this was exactly what was happening. I had allocated too small of

only a problem on returning the function. Doh!; I was looking for
bigger issues when it was basic.

Dave,

Are you saying that can CanReadFile  is called even before the file is
selected ! ?
Fred is saying that his file is not showing up at all, so if
CanReadFile is called only after the file has is selected,
his problem is not releated to CanReadFile.

You simply instantiate the toolbar in your QMainWindow subclass (or
using a UI file) and then do the usual steps one follows to add a
toolbar in Qt e.g.

QToolBar* timeToolbar = new QToolBar(mainWindow);
 ...
 mainWindow->addToolBar(Qt::TopToolBarArea, timeToolbar);
 timeToolbar->hide();


It will automatically be updated in the View Menu, nothing special to do there.

Sorry I was mistaken. CanReadFile happens only after you attempt to
open the file.
I do not know why one particular "*.cas" file would not show up in the list.

Subject: [Paraview]  remote volume rendering is too slow
Message-ID: <584529080911091503q3f92a824oe98f513c6e8fe3b9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was testing remote rendering with paraview and experienced very slow
rendering with the dataset ironProtein.vtk (300K cell)
If I do volume rendering with the dataset on my macbook pro (intel core 2
duo, 4GB ram,  nvidia geforce 8600M GT) , it is fine (like 1 sec rendering
time).
But if I do remote volume rendering with the same dataset, it's too slow
(like 5 sec to finish rendering).
The machine ran pvserver has two dual core amd opteron, 4GB ram, GeForce
7900 GTX.
Client machine is same and they're connected back to back 1Gbps link.
Regardless of the remote rendering setting it is always slow.
I used ParaView-3.4.0 in 64bit machines.
Any idea?

Best,
Sungwon

Perhaps because the file is bigger than 2Gb. It used to happen to me, although I have not seen this behavior lately....

Hi all
I am an occaisonal use of Paraview with GRASS GIS.  I am looking at a call
for expressions of interest to do 3D modelling of chemical compounds.
Please comment on whether Paraview is suitable for basic work in this field,
or whether I should look at other open source software.
Kind regards

I'm sorry, I explained the problem very bad; we are using OSMesa library.

If we run pvserver only on the master node:

mpirun -np 2 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

It's all ok (even if DISPLAY variable is not set: we don't know if it's
necessary).


If we try to use 2 nodes (master and node1), running this command on the
master node:

mpirun -x
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/:/usr/lib/:/home/user/ParaView/ComponentiAggiuntivi/lib
-np 2 -machinefile /home/user/ParaView/NodesList
/home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

the error is:

Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Client connected.
[node1:06211] *** Process received signal ***
[node1:06211] Signal: Segmentation fault (11)
[node1:06211] Signal code: Address not mapped (1)
[node1:06211] Failing at address: 0x21
mpirun noticed that job rank 0 with PID 22632 on node master exited on
signal 15 (Terminated).
1 additional process aborted (not shown)


X is running on the second node (called node1); DISPLAY is not set neither
on node master nor in the second node.
Must X server run on each node and must DISPLAY variable to be set also if
we are using OSMesa library?

Must we install OSMesa on each node or it's enough to have installed that
library on a shared folder (/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib) in the
master node?

Have you any other idea?

Thank you very much for your patience
Luis

Subject: [Paraview] Improving vtkDataArraySelection ... and a question

It seems that this might apply more to ParaView than I originally suspected.

I've modified my usage of vtkDataArraySelection to use vtkDataArraySelection::SetArraysWithDefault(const char *const * ...), which is a fairly roundabout means of adding new items to a list without this->Modified() being called. I've double checked and indeed the MTime() remains unchanged.

However, to get the reader GUI updated in paraview, I need to call UpdateInformationProperty(...) with the corresponding property. When this happens, the GUI view of the vtkDataArraySelection gets adjusted appropriately, but unfortunately the reader panel also gets touched as modified (ie, the 'Apply' button lights up green). As far as I can see, the GUI changes are spurious since nothing has changed in the underlying selection except that the list of available part selections is now a bit longer than before.
Using the 'Reset' button to undo the GUI changes seems to confirm my suspicions - the list properly retains its new length and GUI selections are unchanged.

Why is the panel getting marked as modified and is there a reasonable workaround?

Thanks,

/mark

Well yes and no. I think Stephane is asking for standard ParaView to
preserve  the representation type and other properties as filters etc.
are applied. These seem like reasonable things to do. ParaView does do
some of it already, but I admit it still have some quirks. Stephane
feel free to add it to the bug tracker.

If you are using OSMesa, you should not need X running on any of the nodes.  It should be sufficient to have the OSMesa libraries and associated Mesa GL libraries installed on a shared folder.  However, make sure that folder is actually mounted everywhere (a common failure in my experience) and that they are the ones actually loaded for each node.

I'm sorry, I explained the problem very bad; we are using OSMesa library.

If we run pvserver only on the master node:

mpirun -np 2 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

It's all ok (even if DISPLAY variable is not set: we don't know if it's necessary).


If we try to use 2 nodes (master and node1), running this command on the master node:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/:/usr/lib/:/home/user/ParaView/ComponentiAggiuntivi/lib -np 2 -machinefile /home/user/ParaView/NodesList /home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

the error is:

Client connected.

mpirun noticed that job rank 0 with PID 22632 on node master exited on signal 15 (Terminated).
1 additional process aborted (not shown)


X is running on the second node (called node1); DISPLAY is not set neither on node master nor in the second node.
Must X server run on each node and must DISPLAY variable to be set also if we are using OSMesa library?

Must we install OSMesa on each node or it's enough to have installed that library on a shared folder (/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib) in the master node?

Have you any other idea?

Thank you very much for your patience
Luis

By "usual error" do you mean the crash in the GL or pthreads library?  It could be that the environment in the non-master nodes is incorrect.

Hi ken, thanks again.

we recompiled again OSMesa library (only on the master node of our cluster; the libraries file are generated on a shared folder - /home/user/ParaView/Components/lib - visible on each node), then we recompiled Paraview with these libraries (and setting shared libraries=off in ccmake menu); now we are able to connect the client with pvserver provided that pvserver runs only on the master node.

If we run pvserver on two or more nodes with the command:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib -np 2 -machinefile NodesList pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we always get the usual error when we try to connect the client with the server

Must X server run on each node? Currently X server is not running on any node (if we execute "pidof X" we obtain nothing) and DISPLAY variable is not set, but we can connect the client with the master node...

Have you any idea? Can you help us?

Thank you very much

(Responding back to the ParaView list.)

These symbols should be defined in the GL library that is part of Mesa.  You should have a library like /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so.  That is where the symbols should be defined.  libOSMesa.so simply references those libraries.  It is because the symbols cannot be found in the GL library that you are getting the error.  You can use the 'nm' command to query what symbols are defined are what are required.

It sounds like you are still linking to the system OpenGL libraries somehow.  Those symbols should be defined in the libGL.so that is built with Mesa (whereas the /usr/lib/libGL.so on your system probably does not have them).


Hi Ken,
thanks again.

Looking the errors such as:

"home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_free_context_data'"

I believe those symbols must be defined in libOSMesa.so library and not in /usr/lib/libGL.so library.

In fact, if we install OSMessa using Debian packages we can compile ParaView, but we can't connect client and server; the error always is similar to:

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

Executing with: 0

*** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


If instead we compile OSMesa ourselves we can't compile ParaView: I believe that something went wrong compiling OSMesa (some simbols aren't present in libOSMesa.so created), but I don't know if compiling OSMesa ourselves can help us to resolve our problem.

We also tried to install on our cluster ParaView 3.6.1already compiled (downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html) and it works: we can establish client-server connection.

But if we try to run more 2 or more pvserver instances on the same node (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), we have this error:

"vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x23d6da0): Failed to set up server socket"


 Did you do a clean build of ParaView (that is, delete the binary directory and start over from scratch)?  If you just tried to change some CMake variables in an existing build, you may have some stale libraries built.

We did "make clean".

You should also check to make sure that the executables being built are linking to your compiled Mesa libraries instead of the system libraries.  You can check this with the ldd command.  You may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6.

We also tried to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Can you help us?

Hi Ken,

We compiled Mesa with:

./configure --enable-gl-osmesa --disable-gallium
make
make install

and we configured Paraview with:

OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-.6/include
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGLU.so

but we have many error compiling Paraview; for example:

Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on each node downloading the .deb packages with:

apt-get install libosmesa6
apt-get install libosmesa6-dev

Have you got any other idea?
Thank you again.
Luis

Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

Executing with: 0
*** Process received signal ***
Signal: Segmentation fault (11)
Signal code:  (128)
Failing at address: (nil)

[ 1] /usr/lib/libGL.so.1(glBlendFuncSeparateEXT+0x16) [0x7f4fc7bc12e6]
*** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

111/475 Testing TestGradientBackground        ***Exception: SegFault

151/475 Testing TestParallelopipedWidget      ***Exception: SegFault

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

If you need more information let us now

Thank you very much

Luis

Is it described in the book 'Paraview User's Guide'?

Hello all,

while switching from ParaView 3.4 to 3.6.1, I recognized that the button for choosing LittleEndian / BigEndian has been deleted. Has this button just been moved to some other place and I didn't get it or do I have to use some python scripting for loading LittleEndian / BigEndian files (Ensight Gold format)?

Thanks in advance,
Michael

Thanks Ken, I did this but I did not find a suitable format in "save 
data" that would permit me to edit the data saved from the spread sheet.

It isn't covered well in the current guide.

The best resource at the moment is the material from the ReVisE
workshop at IEEE, which I just posted that to the paraview wiki.

Fred,

What is the exact file name?
It might be a variant of bug 9270 or 9452. Does it help to move the file to a
different directory?

Sven

save data does not write a complete csv file (for me) when using spread 
sheet data.
But export does write a readable .csv file using spread sheet.

Again, you should upgrade to 3.6.  Several problems with tabular data and csv files were fixed.

save data does not write a complete csv file (for me) when using spread
sheet data.
But export does write a readable .csv file using spread sheet.

Subject: [Paraview] Pre-load python macros & toolbar icons?
Message-ID: <BCDC042D-D84F-483F-9C12-BB990D822FA5@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I'm wondering if it is possible for ParaView to automatically load  
Python macros? (Like plugins, where PV looks in certain places to load  
automatically, or through some XML?)

I understand that once macros are loaded they'll show up again the  
next time PV is launched, but I was wondering in the context of  
delivering a custom application where I'd like to fill the toolbar  
with macros right from the first launch.

Also, is there any way to associate an icon with a macro (like you can  
with a filter)?

Thanks,
-Eric

Berk
This is a well-known problem and incidentally one for which I have an
implementation. 

In general you can map an open surface mesh to a plane without problems
(once you've dealt with an ill-conditioned matrix). In the literature you'll
see people have tried minimizing various properties of the surface in order
to make a 'good' parameterization. See for instance Desbrun, Meyer & Alliez
'intrinsic parameterizations of surface meshes' Eurographics 2002.

These approaches will give you some (UV) coordinates but I imagine that you
want a bit more than that: you want to map your mesh to a rectangle in
parameter space such as u=0, v=0 to u=1, v=1.

This is also easy to formulate and solve, provided that you know which
vertices are on which edge of the parameter space. But this is a user
choice. The filter must either ask the user to pick the corners, or apply
some user-defined heuristics to identify them. 

I'd be glad to make my code available as a vtk filter although as this will
be my first it will surely need careful reviewing. 

Cheers

I think your best bet is to provide u and v at the reader as a attribute
array.

I could be wrong (I'm not a topology or meshing expert) but I don't
think it is possible to in general provide a u,v mapping for arbitrary
shapes. If it is possible, it would be great to have the algorithm
coded up as a filter in VTK.

Hey Utkarsh,

Thanks -- that did the trick!

I got fooled for a while, thinking it wasn't working, because before I  
made this change to hide the toolbars I had opened the application and  
the Settings File (.ini) was overriding the "hide" and making the  
toolbars visible... oops.

Talk to you later,

Subject: [Paraview] D3 filter and PkdTrees: how to tell if D3 previously
	executed?, PkdTree point locators
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0911101330t4cb6784co312c25982ca27909@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm now playing around with creating some filters which use PkdTrees
internally, mainly for their point locator capabilities. As the
filters I'm interested in creating work best with spatial locality, I
want to execute D3 if running in parallel and it has not previously
been executed. I had four primary questions.

1. How do I tell if D3 has been executed previously in the pipeline?
2. It seems that I must first build a locator from points before
calling e.g. FindClosestNPoints even though D3 takes in the same data
set as input to build its KdTree. Does this mean
BuildLocatorFromPoints(input) builds a different sort (and, in turn,
new) KdTree than D3->SetInput(input) .... D3->Update()? Should I not
even bother trying to get the KdTree from D3 and simply create a new
one?
3. If I build my own PkDtree is this accomplished by creating a new
one on each process, and for my locator calling
BuildLocatorFromPoints(input) on each process, or should I do
something special on e.g. the root process?
4. If I run D3 and/or build a KdTree within my filter it would be nice
to save this for possible use by filters downstream. I see that D3 has
a SetRetainKdTree, which may be what I am looking for in that regard,
but if I build my own KdTree with associated locator is there a way to
retain it/access it downstream?

Hmmm. Someone will probably chime in with an easier way.

I would try combining an autostart plugin and a python extension.
See
ADD_PARAVIEW_AUTO_START and ADD_PYTHON_EXTENSION

There is no way to do this right now, but if you want to try what Dave
said, write an autostart plugin, the plugin can programatically add
python macros.  I can give you a hint if you want to try this.

No way to associate an icon with the macros.  Currently macros are
stored in the paraview settings file as <label, filename> pairs.  This
could be extended to store qrc icon filenames without too much
trouble.

As I remember, the old panel was slightly broken in that you couldn't
use automatic endian detection at all. The new panel now uses the
automatic endian detection and does away with the old explicit choice.

Should we assume from your question that the automatic detection isn't
working for your files?

OK, thanks for your explanation, Mark.
I did some checking with older files. The problem was a format error in my file and ParaView was working properly. It's already corrected and the automatic detection of byte order is working...

use automatic endian detection at all. The new panel now uses the
automatic endian detection and does away with the old explicit choice.

Should we assume from your question that the automatic detection isn't
working for your files?

Message-ID: <4AFABAB2.4010503@hybridsolutions.nl>

Hi,

I have 40 *.tec Tecplot files containing a grid that represents a 
temperature state that changes over time. I want to visualize the 
temperature change.
How can I load all the files in one go and the make a movie of the 
temperture change?

Thanks,

Johan

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering bug?
Message-ID: <4AFACB1F.9050604@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi,

I've come across something that I consider a rendering bug, but before filing a
bug report I'd like to discuss it first. Maybe it sounds familiar. (I'm guess
it's not related to the z-fighting issue discussed last week.)

I have two volume grids consisting of hexaeder which partially overlap (wavelet
sources for demonstration purposes in the attached *.pvsm file). After applying
AppendDataSets and CleantoGrid filter it looks like the resulting grid contains
all points and cells except the cell at the intersection of the two grids. See
attached image.
But the "missing" cell is actually there. Twice. It can be confirmed by applying
a ProgrammableFilter to add a cell array with cell numbers and applying a
Threshold filter. Set both lower and upper threshold to either 0 or 30 to verify
that the "missing" cell is still there. It simply not rendered any more.

It happens with PV 3.6.1 binary release and PV compiled from CVS HEAD. (The
state file has been created with PV from CVS HEAD.)

Any thoughts?

Thanks
Sven

you might try:

let say you have file names test01.tec, test02.tec ....etc.

when you open the file in paraview you will see something like:

test..tec

just click that (not within the + sign) to load all the files at once.
Then hit the play button to play animation. You can also look -> View
-> Animation View for more detail.

Does this work?

I do not think that this is a rendering problem.  I think you have just fooled the filter that extracts the external faces of the blocks (which is what is actually rendered).  Notice that when you arrange the overlapping meshes exactly as you are doing, that some of the faces are coincident.  In particular, the face that is missing is coincident.  Up to the point before you run clean to grid, these faces are topologically distinct because they use an independent (although coincident) set of points.  When you run clean to grid, these coincident points are merged.  When the points are merged, the cells from the two meshes now share the same indexed points.  At this point, these faces are no longer topologically distinct.  The external faces filter notices that these two faces use the same points and marks it as a neighbor face (this is the definition of a neighbor face) and "correctly" removes it.

The problem is basically that when you append the data sets you are creating a non-manifold mesh.  To correct the problem, you need some sort of filter that identifies coincident cells and removes duplicates.  I know of no such filter, so you will probably have to write your own.

Hey guys,

Thanks a lot for the responses. I'll add the icon thing as a feature  
request, but I'm interested in figuring out how to add the macros,  
either embedded in a plugin or in my custom application code.

If I was doing it as a plugin: building an autostart plugin shouldn't  
be a problem, but I don't know how to "programmatically add python  
macros" -- do you just use the pqPythonMacroSupervisor somehow...? I  
also have never run across the CMake ADD_PYTHON_EXTENSION before. I  
see the section in the Plugin_HowTo about Embedding Python Source as  
Modules, but I'm not sure what a "python extension" is or what exactly  
it does...

If I was adding the macros in my custom application constructor: I  
have my macros as .py files, but I'm not clear on what "custom install  
rules" are. Can I somehow just use the macro supervisor to add macros  
from the files in my constructor? (Oh, I bet you're referring to how  
to use CMake to package the .py files afterwards so they tag along  
with the libraries, etc, for the app to find them! Yup, I have no idea  
how to do that, eitther. :)

So, Pat, if you're willing to give me some pointers (or pointers to  
source code) to get me going in the right direction, I'd really  
appreciate it!

Thanks again,
-Eric

Johan,

The procedure will actually only work if you apply the attached patch first and
recompile PV from CVS. (Because in current CVS the Tecplot reader is not called
as a subproxy of vtkFileSeriesReader, but directly.)

You can install individual files or whole directories.  Just run
"cmake --help-command install" for help, or search in paraview's
source code for "INSTALL(DIRECTORY" or "INSTALL(FILES" for examples.

To add macros programatically- at runtime determine the path to the
python macro file you want to add (get the path to the paraview.exe
and then you should know where the .py file is relative to that,
search the source code for "applicationDirPath" for an example) then
just call the static method:

pqPythonMacroSupervisor::addMacro(label, filename);

Probably you only want to do this on the first run, after that the
macro is stored in the paraview ini settings file.  You need to call
addMacro before the macro toolbar is populated because the method to
refresh the macro toolbar is protected
(pqPythonMacroSupervisor::resetActions()).  The toolbar is populated
after the call to addWidgetForMacros() in pqClientMainWindow.

    I just committed ParaView3\Servers\ServerManager\Resources\Filters.xml
and ParaView3\Qt\Components\Resources\XML\ParaViewReaders.xml. Please update
your ParaView with these two files and you will be able to animate Tecplot
time series data after loading the files as Hom suggested.

I believe Ken is correct.  I just offset wavelet2 by Z == 0.001, rebuilt the pipeline, and the problem goes away.

HI, I can only address the questions, 1) and 4). They can be solved 
using vtkInformationKey's

One may pass information downstream via vtkInformationKey objects.

If you wanted to know weather there is a certain filter upstream, then 
that filter can leave a trace of its presence in the pipeline 
information as its RequestData is executed. It will add a 
vtkInformationKey to the output information. downstream filters then 
look for this specific key. If present it's evidence that the other 
filter is in the pipeline upstream.

You can pass almost anything you like downstream including vtk objects 
between readers,sources, and filters using the vtkInformationKey's. For 
example you may use vtkInformtionObjectBaseKey to pass a vtkPKdTree 
downstream between two filters.

You'll have to modify vtkDistributedDataFilter, adding the keys you need.

Hope this helps,

Burlen

Re: [Paraview] output vs input representation parameters






Well yes and no. I think Stephane is asking for standard ParaView to
preserve  the representation type and other properties as filters etc.
are applied. These seem like reasonable things to do. ParaView does do
some of it already, but I admit it still have some quirks. Stephane
feel free to add it to the bug tracker.

Subject: [Paraview] cmake issue
Message-ID: <BAY109-W212C9AC3E52A010EC94AC8B2A90@phx.gbl>


I try to build PV according to the recommandations, that is create a binary directory, go there and run ccmake <PV tree root>
and I get an error message that advice me to create a binary directry, go there and so
So I add a line at the beginning of the CMakeLists.txt file so as to print the values of ParaView_SOURCE_DIR and ParaView_BINARY_DIR and I get the same value, which is actually the source value. So it means that cmake fails getting the current directory name. My PWD shell variable is ok so any idea?

Ok, I set the ParaView_BINARY_DIR variable by hand and now I run ccmake <source_dir> and I get several errors saying that some files lack in <binary_dir>, such as Servers/Filters/Utilities/vtkPVFiltersKit.cmake
I did not have any problem compiling PV on Mac OS X but these problems occur on Linux Ubuntun
cmake version: 2.6.2
PV version : 3.6.1 (source)

Please tell us exactly what commands you are using.

Please tell us the version of CMake you are using.

Did you get ParaView from CVS?

Did you download one of the release tarballs?

When I build from one of the release tarballs I do :

[kevin at murron tmp]$ tar -xzf paraview-3.6.1.tar.gz
[kevin at murron tmp]$ mkdir ParaView3_Build
[kevin at murron tmp]$ cd ParaView3_Build/
[kevin at murron ParaView3_Build]$ ccmake ../ParaView3


[kevin at murron ParaView3_Build]$ make -j 8
.
.
.

and everything seems to work OK

I have now followed your advise and I no longer get negative values
which is good. But I still cannot make any sense out of the histogram.

I have tried to make a histogram showing the following 3 types of information:

1) bin_values
http://37133.vs.webtropia.com/apache2-default/test/hist1.jpg

2) GlyphVector_total (Magnitude)
http://37133.vs.webtropia.com/apache2-default/test/hist2.jpg

3) GlyphVector_average (Magnitude)
http://37133.vs.webtropia.com/apache2-default/test/hist3.jpg

As I understand the magnitude of the vectors are shown along the
x-axis. This means that no vectors have 0 magnitude and the max
magnitude is 5.11 units.

But what is plotted along the y-axis? The input image contains
512*512= 262144 pixels. But the sum of the blocks in the above
histograms exceeds this number so it cannot be the pixel count. What
is plotted along the y-axis?

Hi all, I have a question. I have been using VTK for some time now,  
and have recently been focusing my efforts on Paraview. I am running  
into a problem though. I am trying to import netCDF volume data. I am  
able to import the file using the raw binary filter, which works quite  
well, however, when I try to import a netCDF file with compressed  
variables, this approach does not work. Glancing through the  
documentation, it appears that the is a netCDF reader built in,  
however it doesn't look like my file is being associated with the  
netCDF reader when opening. A little about my setup: Mac OS X 10.6.1,  
Paraview 3.6.1 binary, netCDF 4.0.1. Any help on this would be really  
appreciated. Thanks!

ParaView first uses extensions to determine file type.  Files with extension .nc or .ncdf are assumed to be netCDF files.  If you are using another extension it should still work so long as the extension does not conflict with any other extension used.  If no file extension matches you should get a dialog box asking you what type of reader to use.  If the file is detected as a valid netCDF file, it should show up in that list.

Ken,

Thanks for the reply. I have tested with both *.nc and *.ncdf, with no  
luck on the netCDF reader showing up on the list. I generated the  
netCDF file using the netcdf4-python (http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/ 
) interface, using the NETCDF4 and NETCDF3-CLASSIC filetypes. Both  
types show coherent output when using the netCDF viewer "ncdump." I  
checked the Paraview Dataset file to see if there were any netCDF  
files, and did not come across any. I did however see there were *.h5  
(hdf5) files. The documentation states that these should have a viewer  
as well, but when I opened one of these files, I was presented with  
the same reader list as before, with no mention to an hdf5 reader.

There is an example netCDF file that comes with the VTK test data.  It is identical to the one from here:

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/tos_O1_2001-2002.nc

On retrospect, I'm not sure that the netCDF that comes with ParaView is version 4.  We may need to update it.

Thanks for the reply. I have tested with both *.nc and *.ncdf, with no luck on the netCDF reader showing up on the list. I generated the netCDF file using the netcdf4-python (http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/) interface, using the NETCDF4 and NETCDF3-CLASSIC filetypes. Both types show coherent output when using the netCDF viewer "ncdump." I checked the Paraview Dataset file to see if there were any netCDF files, and did not come across any. I did however see there were *.h5 (hdf5) files. The documentation states that these should have a viewer as well, but when I opened one of these files, I was presented with the same reader list as before, with no mention to an hdf5 reader.

Hi all, I have a question. I have been using VTK for some time now,
and have recently been focusing my efforts on Paraview. I am running
into a problem though. I am trying to import netCDF volume data. I am
able to import the file using the raw binary filter, which works quite
well, however, when I try to import a netCDF file with compressed
variables, this approach does not work. Glancing through the
documentation, it appears that the is a netCDF reader built in,
however it doesn't look like my file is being associated with the
netCDF reader when opening. A little about my setup: Mac OS X 10.6.1,
Paraview 3.6.1 binary, netCDF 4.0.1. Any help on this would be really
appreciated. Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] D3 filter and PkdTrees: how to tell if D3 previously

Hi Burlen,

Yes this helps, thanks. Although I was hoping not to have to modify
D3, more because of the desire to keep a simple user friendly
architecture for my plugin than laziness in the face of such a simple
change.

Based on your response, my current plan of action for my now three and
growing filters using PKdTrees is to override D3 to retain/pass its
presence/PKdTree downstream, requesting that the any user of my plugin
use my D3 version instead of the default. If my modified D3 has been
run, I'll use its PKdTree within my filter, if not, I'll first
internally run my modified D3 filter, being sure to pass its results
downstream at the end.

But if anyone has a cleaner solution or an answer to my original
questions I'd love to hear from you. I've now read every source code
file using or referring to KdTrees/PKdTrees in VTK/ParaView  at least
twice, but my original questions still stand.

Cheers,
Christine

Ken,

Thats great, I really appreciate it. I guess I missed this file in the  
paraview dataset. I was not able to get this particular file to load,  
however, some of the other examples in that directory work quite well  
- thanks for the resource. The reader was automatically detected, so,  
I guess there is something wrong with the structure of the files I am  
creating. This is perfect though, I had no clue if the problem was me,  
the paraview binary, or a little bit of both. Now things have been  
whittled down a bit. Thanks, have a great day.

It might be that ParaView is compiled with a version of netCDF that is too low.  netCDF is generally not forward compatible.

Ken,

Would it be possible to rectify that (for myself) if I compiled  
Paraview using my installed netCDF libraries?

Uhhhhh... It's probably not that straightforward.  The netCDF distribution is embedded in the VTK repository and has a bunch of name mangling.  The easiest way to do it would probably be to hack the CMakeLists.txt file in ParaView3/VTK/IO to use the headers and libraries in your distribution.

If you find that this is a problem, I recommend submitting a bug report to update the version of netCDF.

Ken,

Would it be possible to rectify that (for myself) if I compiled Paraview using my installed netCDF libraries?

It might be that ParaView is compiled with a version of netCDF that is too low.  netCDF is generally not forward compatible.

Ken,

Thats great, I really appreciate it. I guess I missed this file in the paraview dataset. I was not able to get this particular file to load, however, some of the other examples in that directory work quite well - thanks for the resource. The reader was automatically detected, so, I guess there is something wrong with the structure of the files I am creating. This is perfect though, I had no clue if the problem was me, the paraview binary, or a little bit of both. Now things have been whittled down a bit. Thanks, have a great day.

There is an example netCDF file that comes with the VTK test data.  It is identical to the one from here:

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/tos_O1_2001-2002.nc

On retrospect, I'm not sure that the netCDF that comes with ParaView is version 4.  We may need to update it.

Ken,

Thanks for the reply. I have tested with both *.nc and *.ncdf, with no luck on the netCDF reader showing up on the list. I generated the netCDF file using the netcdf4-python (http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/) interface, using the NETCDF4 and NETCDF3-CLASSIC filetypes. Both types show coherent output when using the netCDF viewer "ncdump." I checked the Paraview Dataset file to see if there were any netCDF files, and did not come across any. I did however see there were *.h5 (hdf5) files. The documentation states that these should have a viewer as well, but when I opened one of these files, I was presented with the same reader list as before, with no mention to an hdf5 reader.

I am loading a transient (xmf) dataset into PV and want to save just one

multiple times (but watching the oscillating size while being 
written...) - as if it were saved for all the timesteps one after 
another? Is it not a bug?

About the h5 files, ParaView requires an xdmf file the help it
interpret and load the contents of the hdf5 files.
See www.xdmf.org for an explanation of the xdmf format.

Hi,
I am trying to build a Paraview for Red Hat Linux EL 5.3 on an x86-64 
machine, I get the following error.
Can anyone guess or does anyone know what's causing this?
The osmesa.h is from this package: (according to rpm -qf)

mesa-libOSMesa-devel-6.5.1-7.7.el5

Thanks

Message-ID: <17223CA3449B00429E36710D6A30D64DB1203E@LOBOS.aeroconseil.com>

Hello,

 

I'm using paraview in batch, and I would like to export data from an
ExtractBlock filter in a table.

I would like to use values (temperature, pressure...) of the extracted
part in a python script for post-processing.

Is it possible to do that?

Thanks a lot.

What do you mean by export to a table? Are you simply interested in
looking at the raw point data or cell data values? Or do you want to
create a vtkTable?

All,

Thanks for the input on this one. I did some further investigation  
into this... it seems the "problem" lies with the netcdf4-python  
interface. I set up some scripts to generate identical files using A)  
ncgen, and B) netcdf4-python. The ncgen files are always recognized in  
Paraview (quite smoothly, I might say), while the netcdf4-python files  
aren't recognized. I'm not too sure what I am doing wrong with the  
python interface, but this clearly isn't the place for that. I am not  
going to get too worried about this, it doesn't seem to be a big issue  
one way or the other.
As well, thanks David for the information on xdmf, I helped clear some  
things up.
Thanks everyone for your help, I really appreciate it.

If you interested in saving it in csv format, highlight extracted part
and press Ctrl+s, although there are some other format available as
well but csv closest to table format.

Subject: [Paraview] Time series with Xdmf
Message-ID: <30369.1258345650@milo.math.sc.edu>


Hi,

I have about 10 scalar fields and 10 vector fields on 17*17*17 datapoints
at 1000 time steps.  Each time step occupies one h5 file.  I wrote an Xdmf
file, which works fine in Paraview.

My problem is, my Xdmf file is about 4 MB.  It takes 50 seconds to load.
The "apply" properties button, takes another 15 seconds.  This happens on
a moderately new consumer computer (AMD Phenom 9600 quad core, 4 GB memory).
Am I doing it wrong?  How can I speed this up?

My Xdmf file (truncated) follows below.  Time step 0 is special.  Time steps
1..1000 have the same data format.  I repeat the same data description 1000
times.  It seems redundant, but I don't know how else to do it. 

Thank you,

Paisa

John,

I think you sent this to the wrong list.  This is more a question for the ParaView mailing list than the VTK developers mailing list.

This sounds like a bug.  Please submit a report on it.  It sound similar to one I experienced earlier (where a plugin would report an error because it needed its twin on the client/server when in fact it was actually loaded there).  That other bug has been fixed but it looks like this oversight is still there.

-Ken

I have noticed that the plugin manager reports errors such as
"Loaded, but missing required plugins" - when the required plugins are happily loaded.

Is this easy to fix?  If so, where shall I poke around?

Hi,

In fact, I'm working in script Pyhton. I'm using Paraview V3.4 and V3.6.1.
My script uses a source's file "ensightcase", then I apply a filter "ExtractBlock" to keep only the data along a surface. Then, I would like to create a file "CSV" with all the values of my variables on the extracted surface. 

Later, I'll apply a post processing in order to calculate the Max, Min, and Moy of all the variables (temperature, pressure, speed...) along the surface.

So, my problem is how I can create a file CSV in script Python.
Thanks.

Adrien

What do you mean by export to a table? Are you simply interested in
looking at the raw point data or cell data values? Or do you want to
create a vtkTable?

Paisa,

Are you using the CVS version ? The vtkXdmfReader has been significantly 
improved and the XML parsing is much faster.

The only other thing I can think of is to write out each timestep to a 
separate XML file and use XIncude to build the collection; that way you 
could load a single timestep individually if needed.

Subject: [Paraview] API Change between PV 3.4 and 3.6 for XY Plots
Message-ID: <68B0A871-D385-4AE5-885E-02C219D50E19@bluequartz.net>

A long while ago I wrote a custom plugin that read some data from an  
HDF5 file. There were 6 output ports defined as follows:


//  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
int vtkH5VizFileReader::FillOutputPortInformation(int port,  
vtkInformation* info)
{
   // Both of our output data sets will be vtkUnstructuredGrid
   if (port == 0 || port == 1)
   {
     info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkUnstructuredGrid");
   }
   else if (port == 2)
   {
     info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkMultiBlockDataSet");
   }
   else if (port > 2 && port < 6)
   {
     info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkRectilinearGrid");
   }
   return 1;
}

With ParaView 3.3.1 (From the time), when I open the file I get the  
expected 3D View + 3 XY plot views showing the data.

   With ParaView 3.6.1 I get the 3D view, but now I get 3 more 3D  
views, plus 3 XY Plot views, none of which have anything rendered or  
plotted (Except the main view). This is time based data but that does  
not seem to effect anything. I can skip around in time and the main 3D  
display updates that data but none of the other views render data. If  
I look in the pipeline browser, the 2D plot data is associated with  
the other 3D views and not the 2D XY plot views.

   So my question is first, is there any API change between PV 3.4 and  
3.6 that jumps out any anyone that I should take a look at? Where  
might I start looking to track down what the problem is? Is there a  
better data type than "vtkRectilinearGrid" to use for XY Plots with  
newer versions of ParaView?

   This was with the PV 3.6.1 source downloaded from the main PV  
downloads site, Windows 7 x64, Visual Studio 2008 standard. PV was  
built as a 32 bit version using Qt version 4.5.3 if that matters. The  
existing PV 3.3.1 that I have built was built against VS 2008 with Qt  
4.3.5.

Any help is much appreciated.

Use vtkTable now for plotting and charting. The way ParaView used to
plot 1D rect grids and sometimes vtkPolyData polylines directly is
gone now.

Dave,

Where would I find info/link/examples in using VTKTable? Kitware  
Quarterly maybe? Looking at the Doxygen at the moment..

Not sure. It is easy to use though. Think of it as a loose container
for a collection of arrays. Each array is a column. The columns all
have to have the same length (rows).

I'm new to Paraview. I was under the impression that
paraview 3.6.1 supports hdf5. But I cannot find
the correct filter when opening a *.h5 file.

Please advise

ParaView requires an xdmf file the help it interpret the contents of
hdf5 files. See www.xdmf.org for an explanation of the xdmf format.

Your best bet is to write an XDMF file describing the data in your  
HDF5 file.

And what about time support? Does vtkTable support the  
"VTK_VALID_POINT_MASK" or something else?

I see..

And what about raw binary files, how is the data
interpreted? Do I also need to supply some plain
text data description to go with it?

many thanks

Paraview generally treats raw binary files as completely regular data.
You do not need an indexing/header file in this case. When you
instantiate the raw reader it asks the user what the extent, spacing,
data type, endianness etc are.

Xdmf can index into binary files generically. However this capability
was added to the XDMF library after paraview 3.6, and I do not know if
even the PV interface to XDMF in the development head allows that.

Last time I checked, (about a year ago) ParaView's latest plot
interface did not respect that flag array. It isn't so much a problem
the vtkTable (vtk valid point mask was just an array which the table
has no problem including) as it is with the plotting code not looking
for it and respecting it.

I thought I filed a bug for that, but can't find it at the moment.
I'll file one now.

OK,
  So my choice is to help fix the bug in the Plotting code in ParaView  
or "work-around" lack of support in my own code by maybe swapping in/ 
out arrays of the proper length to kind of "fake" the time support.  
Just trying to gather an estimation for an upcoming review by the  
client.

Subject: [Paraview] How to get ParaView to automatically show vtkTable as an
	XY Plot View when Data file is opened.
Message-ID: <BC1592F8-9B04-484B-92F3-D38D75B7E9E6@bluequartz.net>

Looking further into updating some existing code to the current  
version of PV and one of the items that is one the list is when the  
custom data file is opened the following should automatically be  
created:
    3D View that contains 3 unstructured grid objects (output ports 0,  
1, 2 from the MultiBlock data set) and 3 XY plots, one for each of  
output ports 3, 4, 5. With ParaView 3.4 this would automagically just  
work. With PV 3.6.1 I am getting 3 x 3D views and NO XY plot views.  
Can this be done programmatically some how, or something in the PV xml  
files that my plugin has?

Thanks

it has taken longer than expected to find some time to put all the notes 
together, but in the end I put a provisional version at 
http://www.iac.es/sieinvens/siepedia/pmwiki.php?n=HOWTOs.ParaviewInACluster 
, hoping that it can be useful to someone.

I wrote it a bit hastily, so it probably has some mistakes. Any comments 
or suggestions are welcome.

Cheers,

Good evening,

guys, can you confirm if the fixes regarding the OSX bundle creation/installation were included in the current cvs version ?

Regards,

Hi Jerry,

Thanks for the response.  Earlier I used Paraview 3.6.1.  Today, I
tried the CVS version.  The "apply" button now works instantly.
Loading the Xdmf file still takes 40 seconds (compare to 50 secs in
3.6.1).

The time it takes to load an Xdmf file seems to grow quadraticly
with number of timesteps.

    # of timesteps :   500    1000    2000

    Loadtime (sec) :    10      40     160

Back to the issue of having to repeat the same data descriptions
1000 times.  Is it a fundamental limitation of XDMF file format?
Is there a better way to get Paraview to read a time series of HDF5
files?

Paisa

expected date when an official release will be available, and will Kitware's
new Tecplot reader be available within it?

I will begin the process of producing release candidate binaries this week.
As far as the tecplot reader. I believe that is only available on cvs head.

Or the 3.6.2 RC? Would be nice to be able to create the installer  
package on OS X.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin XML Help
Message-ID: <054e01ca67a1$f1f15100$4f2810ac@win.ara>


Dear All,

I am writing a plugin at the moment that takes from the user a vector or
three scalar components. I already have the vector component selectable via
a drop-down menu, but I am struggling to find some example xml code that
will allow me to have the three scalar components accessible via drop-down
menus, side-by-side. For example:

Vector: |ddm|

Scalar1: |ddm| Scalar 2: |ddm| Scalar3: |ddm|

Is this possible or will the three scalar selections have to be vertically
aligned?

Regards,

Adriano

John,

This is a bug, and I just committed a fix to paraview cvs. Basically, the
plugin manager did not find the required plugin given a plugin name.

Please let me know if you still has issues.

Message-ID: <642415.88003.qm@web38305.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Suppose we solve for elasticity, and get displacement field u and pressure field p. How do we plot the field p on the deformed domain \Omega+u(\Omega), instead of the original domain \Omega?

Thank you!

Best,
Chong

Message-ID: <4B03B7F8.7040708@itis.ethz.ch>

I am volume rendering some large transient data and it takes several 
hours till done, which is no problem. The problem is to start it: I get 
my camera right in surface mode, but between the moment I switch to 
volume representation and the moment the generation of images begins is 
enormous pain. I have to wait for several screen refreshes before I am 
finally able to start, and each refresh takes several minutes. Is there 
a way to avoid this?

Sam, thank you for your reply.

But the pressure p and displacement u are saved in two different files. For each field, I know how to use warp filter or glyph filter etc. But I don't know how to plot field p on the domain warped by displacement u. 

Any suggestions? Thank you!

Best,
Chong

Use the Warp filter.

The results are saved by the software FEniCS, and have ending ".vtu".  I have attached them in the attachment. 

The file displacment000010.vtu stores the displacement field u, and the file orientation000010.vtu stores the director field n. They are both defined on the same mesh. I want to plot the glyph of the field n on the deformed domain (the domain after applying the warp filter on the displacement u). 

I hope I have made myself clear. Thank you for your time.

Best,
Chong

Hi all,

Michael - can you confirm what are the "special" enhancements that take care
of the greyed out filters problem / I've been fighting with this issue recently

I don't see this with the latest qt-4.6.0-rc1 but ParaView is really slow based on this qt release,
prefer to rely on qt-4.5.3 for now

Best regards,

PO

Basically, you are looking for the Append Attributes filter.
There is just the small difficulty that both your data sets provide a
point data set with the same name. The Append Attributes filter does not
handle that case particularly well, it discards the second point data
set. To work around this, either manipulate the *.vtu files and change
the name from "U" to something else (or instruct FEniCS to do so) or use
a calculator filter in ParaView first to rename the point data set
(actually, to clone the point data set using a different name).

Here's how:
  Load displacement000010.vtu
  Apply Calculator filter:
    Operation: U.
    Result Array Name: DISP
  Load orientation000010.vtu
  Apply Calculator filter:
    Operation: U.
    Result Array Name: ORIENTATION
  Select both Calculator objects (by Ctrl key + mouse click) and
   apply AppendAttributes filter
  Apply WarpByVector filter
  Color by "ORIENTATION"

John,

This is a bug, and I just committed a fix to paraview cvs. Basically, the plugin manager did not find the required plugin given a plugin name.

Please let me know if you still has issues.

John,

I think you sent this to the wrong list.  This is more a question for the ParaView mailing list than the VTK developers mailing list.

This sounds like a bug.  Please submit a report on it.  It sound similar to one I experienced earlier (where a plugin would report an error because it needed its twin on the client/server when in fact it was actually loaded there).  That other bug has been fixed but it looks like this oversight is still there.

Uuuhm, I haven't done anything in that respect, sorry.

Subject: [Paraview] help with streamlines (units?)
Message-ID: <779dabeb0911181307q1dbe15a8se55330857bc70358@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm hoping to examine some MRI derived blood flow velocity data using
paraview. I've transformed the original data into a time series of vtk
images, which have the velocity vector at each point. However I
suspect I need to set up the units for velocity appropriately. Should
I ensure that the distance component is in the same units as the voxel
spacing in the images, or doesn't it matter? I haven't experimented
with streamlines before so I'm not sure what I should be tweaking.
Also, I notice that some examples assume separate vector and magnitude
information. Is this essential? Should I be normalizing my vectors
instead?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Time dependent multi-domain files
Message-ID: <4B046ECB.5070803@msic.dia.mil>

I have a series of muti-domain files at several time steps that I am 
trying to animate.  The data are in legacy VTK format with domains 
linked together by a .pvtk file.  The individual files are named 
according to type, timestamp, and domain.  For example, for a species 
mass fraction dump on a cutting plane, the files are named:

vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0002

where pl.01 is for cutting plane #1, 0000 is the time stamp, and .p0001 
is for the first domain.  Thus, for a single time stamp, the .pvtk file 
(vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.pvtk) looks like:

<File version="pvtk-1.0"
  dataType="vtkUstructuredGrid"
    numberOfPieces="143" >
 <Piece fileName="vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0002.vtk" />
 <Piece fileName="vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0004.vtk" />
 <Piece fileName="vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0006.vtk" />
 <Piece fileName="vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0007.vtk" />
.
.
.
 <Piece fileName="vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0245.vtk" />
 <Piece fileName="vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0246.vtk" />
 <Piece fileName="vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.p0256.vtk" />
</File>

The reason that the domains are numbered funny is that only 143 of my 
256 domains are sliced by cutting plane 1.

I then have a .pvtk file for each time stamp.  Thus for the first 5 time 
stamps I have:

vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0000.pvtk
vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0001.pvtk
vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0002.pvtk
vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0003.pvtk
vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.0004.pvtk

My questions are:

1)  How do I get Paraview to read in all of the time stamped files 
(.pvtk) at the same time?  When I see them in the Open File dialog, they 
show up as a database:

+vdmp_smf_01_pl.01.000*

which I can expand to show the individual files.  But if I select the 
database, all that opens is the 0000 time stamp file.  When animated, 
nothing happens.

2) How do I animate these?

3) How do I assign a real time to a particular time stamp, such as 0001 
= 5e-2 seconds?

Vr,

B Greiner

I experience similar problems, it takes too long to load.
What I do is to generate an xmf file with only Nth timestep to be able 
to work reasonably fast.
One thing is that XML is ASCII - but lots of redundant information in 
the xmf file makes it even worse. For (my) example: I have hundreds of 
timesteps from flow simulations but on a rigid mesh. Each time a new 
timestep is requested the whole mesh is re-loaded in vein. With large 
meshes tets it starts being unfeasible.

Ok, from this post, I thought that you added some "magic" in the ParaView src :

Well, I did some stuff, but the only thing I can say is that I don't  
see this problem. As to why this is, I have no idea... I didn't do  
anything specifically to fix this.

Adriano,

There's not way of the telling the automatic panel generator to
generate 3 combo-boxes in the same line. You can of course, always
write a custom panel with widget layout as per your liking.

Subject: [Paraview] Viewing distortions
Message-ID: <4B056C88.5040501@inf.ethz.ch>

Hi

I have a very odd problem with paraview 3.6.1 (debug build directly from
sources):

When displaying different objects, they are not properly laid into
space, probably due to projection problems. One way to very easily see
this is to display a line and then use the spreadsheet view to select a
vertex of that line. The purple dot which highlights the point is then
not on the vertex itself, but at some offset which varies depending on
the viewing direction. I took a screenshot (and taking the screenshot
itself changed the position of the highlight it seemed) to illustrate
the problem.

This is extremely annoying as also datasets/lines are not properly laid
into space so there is no way to tell how the two objects relate to each
other. The same problem happens when selecting objects (see second
screenshot)

Is this a known issue/is there already a fix for this?

Thanks a lot
Benjamin

This is a known issue. This happens due to the coincident topology
resolution techniques employed to rendering surfaces with overlapping
lines correctly. We are working on a fix for this issue.

Subject: [Paraview]  particle tracking
Message-ID: <4B05B17A.8070404@yahoo.de>

I am wondering what the state of this is? I am very interested in this
feature. Up to new I used Johns workaround but iso-clipping the
streamlines makes my Paraview 3.6.1 crash without any further comment.

Regards

BastiL


I don't think this answers Pei's question. To my knowledge the

temporal stream tracer (i.e. particle tracker) works only for

time-dependent data. Am I wrong? To animate particles in a

steady-state flow field, I'd think that you would generate streamlines

and then somehow animate particles along those. I can't think of

anything that would do this out-of-box but writing a  filter that does

this would be pretty easy. Is this something more than a few users

would want?

Subject: [Paraview] problems generating ghost cells,
	update on PKdTree questions
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0911191550v6e24a51dl9ddd32fe51f8e0d1@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having trouble with generating ghost cells, either on my own or
with D3 (via the duplicate boundary points mode). In neither case am I
able to see a single ghost level of value 1 for any of my points on a
test data set, which has 10,000 cells, one point per cell, distributed
on 4 processors. I try both generating ghost cells at level one within
my d3 call in my reader as follows:
		vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter> d3 = \
		    vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter>::New();
		d3->AddInput(tipsyReadInitialOutput);
		d3->UpdateInformation();
		vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline* exec = \
		 	static_cast<vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline*>(d3->GetExecutive()); 	
		// adds one ghostlevel
		exec->SetUpdateExtent(exec->GetOutputInformation(0), piece, numPieces, 1);
		d3->Update();
		// changing output to output of d3
	 	output->ShallowCopy(d3->GetOutput());
		output->GetInformation()->Set(
			vtkDataObject::DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(), 1);
And, as far as I can tell, the procedure for a filter requesting ghost
levels is:
		// Requesting one level of ghost cells
                vtkInformation* inInfo =
inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
		inInfo->Set(
			vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),1);
And my reader or D3 would then have to access the inInfo act on this
request. However neither my filter nor D3 are generating any ghost
cells, as is verified by examining:
                 output->GetPointData()->GetArray("vtkGhostLevels")->GetTuple(
				nextHaloId)[0]
Can any one see what's going on? I've read a chunk of vtk source
referencing vtkGhostLevels or using UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS but
haven't found the clue yet.

An update on my D3/PKd tree question: I decided to run D3
automatically if the user checks a button in my readers and strongly
recommend they run D3 if they don't use my readers. I found that
BuildLocator() or BuildLocatorFromPoints(points) never worked as I had
hoped from the documentation (I wanted to call it once/or on all
processes on the PkD tree generated by D3 and have it build a locator
which works across all processes, i.e. can also find points belonging
to a neighbor process), so instead I build a KdTree locator local to
each process, separate from the PKdTree generated by D3, and
coordinate a search if necessary, I can still make this highly data
parallel for my applications, e.g. finding the mass of all points
within a given radius by doing local searches/consolidation and just
sending the results for a final consolidation to the root.

Unlike Case 2, Case 1 does not show any 'Dataserver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'

so i guess what makes Case 2 slower is because the vtkMPIMoveData is doing extra thing to move data amongst processes

 

btw, whenever i run it without -offscreen-rendering, i get this message:

"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled."

 

based on what i read from paraview tutorial, what i understand is that the parallel rendering algorithm allows each process to independently render its partition of the geometry and then composites the partial images together to form the final image. Is this what happened in Case 2 because it has 'Dataserver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'?

 

actually what i dont understand is why case 2 is much slower than case 1? 

is it because different 'things' are going on in the processes when offscreen-rendering is on/off?

 

 

any help / reply is highly appreciated

hi chew ping?
  The Problem:"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled.", it means that not all server start up X Server, so the server will process the raw data and send all geometry to the client to render.
  The client do all the rendering job, that's the reason why case 2 is so slow, I think.
  When you use off screen, all server processes render the geometry locally , send image to client to composite, so case 1 much faster than case 2.
  I hope this can help you, for I got the same problem before. Good luck.

Subject: [Paraview] Data-dependent "default_values" attribute in
	ServerManager XML
Message-ID: <200911201254.08120.baranov@cpfs.mpg.de>

Dear all,

I have a filter which draws spherical glyphs for each data points and tubes 
between some of them. Each data point have its own sphere color and size read 
from data file but the filter user may wish to change them via Properties 
Panel of Object Inspector using appropriate controls.
If user wants to change only the sphere radius and not the color, he selects 
the data point index from popup list, enter new radius into radius control 
but the color control (given as three ints) will have the default value 
hardcoded in Server Manager XML file and by pressing Apply will be changed to 
it. This is quite annoying behavior while to change only the radius the user 
must manually enter the old color into color controls. Similar problem occurs 
when user wants to change color and preserve the radius of the sphere.
Is it possible to make the default values of these parameters point-dependent 
so that by selecting each data point the current values of size and color for 
this data point are set into Properties panel controls? As I recognize this 
probably can be done by writing customized object panel plugin but may be 
there exists some simpler solution like assigning "default_values" attribute 
in XML file to some dynamically formed property?

With best regars,

Alexey Baranov.

Location selections only find cells/points containing a discrete set of
points. To find points within a volume you need to use a frustum selection.

Short of extracting the inverse of the selection, no. VTK doesn't really
have good support for not showing particular cells (except for in the
vtkUniformGrid class). The options to make it hide cells include the alpha
component in the color map, and producing new data sets that lack the
selected cells. Neither of which are build into paraview's selection
infrastructure.

I don't believe so. At one point the points that define the bounding box
were displayed and editable on the selection inspector but it doesn't seem
to be the case today. I think we took that out because of the contraints on
the locations (it always has to define a hexahedron and the point have to
have a particular order) make it too hard to enter manually. We've been
meaning to turn the "Show Frustum" feature into a widget so that you can
refine it (bug#6549) but we have yet to get around to it.

So it seems that the line "DATAPACKING=BLOCK" raises problem.
Any help?

I am working in script Python and I would like to create a File.CSV with data inside (Pressure, Temperature...).
I would like to do a post-processing on the data of the file.CSV

I have already tried the DataSetCSVWriter... but nothing is exported.
How can I "export" data in a CSV file in script Python?


Thanks a lot,
Adrien

I am not sure why it would not work. Here's my simple script to save
out point attributes:

from paraview.simple import *
Sphere()
writer = DataSetCSVWriter(FileName="/tmp/foo.csv", FieldAssociation="Points")
writer.UpdatePipeline()

Subject: [Paraview]  Apply Clip Filter using Python
Message-ID: <14f7c4810911200813r6efa1725jd99a0307c23a55c4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!
I'm new to ParaView and Python and have the following question:

How can I "apply" the Clip Filter using Python?
I'm using ParaView 3.6.1 on Windows XP with the "Python Shell" from the
Tools Menu.

My Python Script:
---------------------------
clip01=Clip()
clip01.InsideOut=1
clip01.ClipType = "Box"
clip01.ClipType.Scale=[0.5,0.5,0.5]
Show(clip01)

surface=ExtractSurface()
Show(surface)

Render()
---------------------------

I haven't found the possibilty to "apply" the Clip Filter via Python...I
always have to press manually the "Apply" Button in the Object Inspector.

I've also tried:

>>> view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
>>> rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(shrinkFilter, view)
>>> view.StillRender()

out of the "Servermanger.pdf", but this creates a new window, which I don't
want.
And also

>>> clip01.UpdatePipeline()

doesn't work.

There was a nearly similar question on this mailinglist, but it doesn't help
me, I'm sorry:

Thank you for your work on ParaView! :-)

Fred:

   The problem was actually caused by "STRANDID=0, SOLUTIONTIME=0".
Currently the Tecplot reader, a simplified version, does not support loading
time series data. If you really want load multiple time steps of data, you
need to remove these two tokens from the zone header(s). And you need put
each time step as an individual file, e.g., file000.tec, file001.tec, ...
and et al. Then you can select all of them by means of 'file*.tec' when
opening the file dialog. In this way, you will still be able to view the
dataset at multiple steps.

   Sorry for the lack of time series data support and we are considering if
we need to add it.

  Thanks.

Thank you for your answer!

I already tried both of them.
After adding the "Extract Surface" Filter on the clip01, everything ist
gone.
I then have to press manually "Reset Bounds" for the Clip and the "Apply"
Button (for the Clip) to get the same state, as if i'm adding both filters
manually.

Zhanping,
 
This method will not allow you to use any of the time-dependent filters,
right (like FFT)?

Fred:
 
   The problem was actually caused by "STRANDID=0, SOLUTIONTIME=0".
Currently the Tecplot reader, a simplified version, does not support loading
time series data. If you really want load multiple time steps of data, you
need to remove these two tokens from the zone header(s). And you need put
each time step as an individual file, e.g., file000.tec, file001.tec, ...
and et al. Then you can select all of them by means of 'file*.tec' when
opening the file dialog. In this way, you will still be able to view the
dataset at multiple steps.
 
   Sorry for the lack of time series data support and we are considering if
we need to add it.
 
  Thanks.

   You are correct.

   This ad-hoc way works by means of vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx.

   Thanks.

Sorry, I've just realised you haven't passed an input to the clip filter.
You need to give the clip filter an input property from the previous
pipeline like so:
 
clip01 = Clip( Input=pipe00 )
clip01.InsideOut=1
clip01.ClipType = "Box"
clip01.ClipType.Scale=[0.5,0.5,0.5]
clip01.UpdatePipeline()
Render()
 
does that work?

Thank you for your answer! 

I already tried both of them.
After adding the "Extract Surface" Filter on the clip01, everything ist
gone. 
I then have to press manually "Reset Bounds" for the Clip and the "Apply"
Button (for the Clip) to get the same state, as if i'm adding both filters
manually.

clip01=Clip()
clip01.InsideOut=1
clip01.ClipType = "Box"
clip01.ClipType.Scale=[0.5,0.5,0.5]
##try this
clip01.UpdatePipeline()
##or this, which I think should automatically update the pipeline for you
Render()

Subject: [Paraview] Apply Clip Filter using Python


Hello!
I'm new to ParaView and Python and have the following question:

How can I "apply" the Clip Filter using Python?
I'm using ParaView 3.6.1 on Windows XP with the "Python Shell" from the
Tools Menu.

My Python Script:
---------------------------
clip01=Clip()
clip01.InsideOut=1
clip01.ClipType = "Box"
clip01.ClipType.Scale=[0.5,0.5,0.5]
Show(clip01)

surface=ExtractSurface()
Show(surface)

Render()
---------------------------

I haven't found the possibilty to "apply" the Clip Filter via Python...I
always have to press manually the "Apply" Button in the Object Inspector.

I've also tried:

>>> view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
>>> rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(shrinkFilter, view)
>>> view.StillRender()

out of the "Servermanger.pdf", but this creates a new window, which I don't
want.
And also

>>> clip01.UpdatePipeline()

doesn't work.

There was a nearly similar question on this mailinglist, but it doesn't help
me, I'm sorry:

http://markmail.org/thread/54kjzlk4i5d6sprh

Thank you for your work on ParaView! :-)

No, sorry... :(
I marked the object in the pipeline and added this line:

pipe00=GetActiveSource()
clip01=Clip(Input=pipe00)
clip01.InsideOut=1
clip01.ClipType = "Box"
clip01.ClipType.Scale=[0.5,0.5,0.5]
clip01.UpdatePipeline()
Render()

after that, I used the "Extract Surface" Filter and had to apply the Clip
again.

But still thank you!

Using DataSetCSVWriter should do the trick.

Subject: [Paraview] Properties not exposed
Message-ID: <4B07225D.5020702@rasmsys.com>

I have written a reader for some cloud model output arrays that are a 
custom binary format.  I essentially cloned the netCDF reader, and 
rewrote the internals of the methods of that reader.  It seems to work fine.

However, I can't seem to get the array names to display in the 
Properties tab after the file is selected.

This is the relevant XML, stolen from /ServerManager/readers.xml:

<StringVectorProperty name="VariableArrayInfo"

    information_only="1">

   <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="Variable"/>

</StringVectorProperty>


<StringVectorProperty name="VariableArrayStatus"

   command="SetVariableArrayStatus"

   number_of_elements="0"

   repeat_command="1"

   number_of_elements_per_command="2"

   element_types="2 0"

   information_property="VariableArrayInfo"

   label="Variables">

   <ArraySelectionDomain name="array_list">

      <RequiredProperties>

         <Property name="VariableArrayInfo" function="ArrayList" />

      </RequiredProperties>

   </ArraySelectionDomain>

   <Documentation>

      This property lists which SAM variables to load.

   </Documentation>

</StringVectorProperty>


When the Apply button is pressed, my debug output shows me a whole lot 
of these messages which lead me to believe that the Properties tab is 
about to be filled in, but I've done something wrong that just prevents 
the process from completing:

vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayName will return mixing coefficient (m^2/s)
vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayStatus .. will return 1 for mixing 
coefficient (m^2/s)
vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayName will return potential temperature (K)
vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayStatus .. will return 1 for potential 
temperature (K)

I'm using paraview-3.6.1-Linux-i686

I'm just getting started with writing and implementing filters, so the 
problem is probably pretty obvious.  Thanks for any help!

Erik

LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH should normally not be set on 
MacOSX. They are not needed if the libraries are built with the right 
install_name (which is not guaranteed when building with cmake, though.)

Instead, set PYTHONPATH to /usr/local/ParaView3_BUILD/bin.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF using ORIGIN_DXDYDZ switches X- and Z-dimension
Message-ID: <4B0A6686.8080002@gmx.de>

Hi XMF-User,

I wonder why the following test-case, switches X and Z-dimension-size in
3.4.x and 3.6.1.
X should be  10.0, but shows 100.0 in paraview.
Z should be 100.0, but shows  10.0 in paraview.
Any idea?

Greetings
Jens

Utkarsh,

Are there any examples around that I can use to create a custom panel?

Adriano,

There's not way of the telling the automatic panel generator to generate 3
combo-boxes in the same line. You can of course, always write a custom panel
with widget layout as per your liking.

Jens,

It's a little confusing but it's done that way to be consistent.
The first dimension in Topology is the slowest changing dimension not 
necessarily "X" (Think Plot3D curvilinear K-J-I). i.e. Topology and 
Geometry are not the same.

Hey Adriano,

On the wiki there is a little section describing how to add a custom  
object panel:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_an_object_panel

which also links to this extra information page:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CustomObjectPanels

There is also an example in the ${ParaviewSource}/Examples/Plugins/ 
GUIObjectPanel directory.

Finally, about half-way through Ken Moreland's talk from IEEE Vis 2009  
on customizing ParaView with plugins, he gives an example of an object  
panel. This page has presentation slides from that day and some code  
samples:

http://www.vtkedge.org/Wiki/IEEE_Vis09_ParaView_Tutorial

Hope this helps,

Hi Eric,

Thanks for all that information. Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't
even realise you could design the custom ui in Qt designer and import that
into ParaView. Great stuff!

Johan and Fred:

   In fact the Visit Tecplot reader (for ASCII files) currently does not
support time series data, either. Thus I feel that the 'VisitReaderPlugin'
might not support time series data either.

   Thanks.

Hi Jerry,

so ORIGIN_DXDYDZ is not related to XYZ of ParaView, but defines its own
XYZ-xdmf.

But why is hdf5-Z the slowest changing dimension and therefor xdmf-X?
HDF5 is written in C++ and therefor hdf5-X should be the slowest
changing dimension.

Anyway, I hope I finally understood it :)

Greetings
Jens

Finally I found the list, but now I have another problem:

  reader = LegacyVTKFileReader(FileName=args[0])

NameError: name 'LegacyVTKFileReader' is not defined

So my question now is: is there something to import to make it working?

Hi Jerry,

this mixed definition results in quite a bit of problems.

What if I add a point-cloud using POLYVERTEX(saved as
2d-hdf5-array..each row one xyz-coords) to a scalar-field on a uniform
grid (saved as 3d-hdf5-array). The scalar-field will switch X and Z, but
the xyz-points of the point-cloud will not.

I have to save the data in the hdf5-file for 3d-data with flipped XZ and
for point-data without.

Greetings
Jens

I am using the multi-block dataset format.  I was wondering if it was
possible to mix point data and cell centered data in the same region?

We're doing some testing with a new 3D LCD Television which uses polarized
passive stereo.  It works via either side-by-side displays or interlaced
lines.  I know ParaView supports active stereo shutter glasses (at least it
Used to), does it support either of these modes?

Message-ID: <C73023FA.13C07%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I think setting UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS on the output of the filter before calling Update is the right thing to do.  However, in your example code I do not see where that value is getting set.  I only see the update extent being set, and that is not sufficient to produce ghost cells.

I'm having trouble with generating ghost cells, either on my own or

on 4 processors. I try both generating ghost cells at level one within
my d3 call in my reader as follows:
                vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter> d3 = \
                    vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter>::New();
                d3->AddInput(tipsyReadInitialOutput);

                        static_cast<vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline*>(d3->GetExecutive());
                // adds one ghostlevel
                exec->SetUpdateExtent(exec->GetOutputInformation(0), piece, numPieces, 1);
                d3->Update();
                // changing output to output of d3
                output->ShallowCopy(d3->GetOutput());

And, as far as I can tell, the procedure for a filter requesting ghost
levels is:
                // Requesting one level of ghost cells
                vtkInformation* inInfo =

                inInfo->Set(
                        vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),1);
And my reader or D3 would then have to access the inInfo act on this
request. However neither my filter nor D3 are generating any ghost
cells, as is verified by examining:
                 output->GetPointData()->GetArray("vtkGhostLevels")->GetTuple(
                                nextHaloId)[0]
Can any one see what's going on? I've read a chunk of vtk source
referencing vtkGhostLevels or using UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS but
haven't found the clue yet.

An update on my D3/PKd tree question: I decided to run D3
automatically if the user checks a button in my readers and strongly
recommend they run D3 if they don't use my readers. I found that
BuildLocator() or BuildLocatorFromPoints(points) never worked as I had
hoped from the documentation (I wanted to call it once/or on all
processes on the PkD tree generated by D3 and have it build a locator
which works across all processes, i.e. can also find points belonging
to a neighbor process), so instead I build a KdTree locator local to
each process, separate from the PKdTree generated by D3, and
coordinate a search if necessary, I can still make this highly data
parallel for my applications, e.g. finding the mass of all points
within a given radius by doing local searches/consolidation and just
sending the results for a final consolidation to the root.

I'm not sure we can diagnose the problem with this information.  Are you sure that the variable names are being read and stored in the RequestInformation method?  If you don't read them until RequestData, then it is too late.

I have written a reader for some cloud model output arrays that are a

rewrote the internals of the methods of that reader.  It seems to work fine.

However, I can't seem to get the array names to display in the
Properties tab after the file is selected.

This is the relevant XML, stolen from /ServerManager/readers.xml:

<StringVectorProperty name="VariableArrayInfo"

   <Documentation>

      This property lists which SAM variables to load.

   </Documentation>

</StringVectorProperty>


When the Apply button is pressed, my debug output shows me a whole lot
of these messages which lead me to believe that the Properties tab is
about to be filled in, but I've done something wrong that just prevents
the process from completing:

vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayName will return mixing coefficient (m^2/s)
vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayStatus .. will return 1 for mixing
coefficient (m^2/s)
vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayName will return potential temperature (K)
vtkSAMReader::GetVariableArrayStatus .. will return 1 for potential
temperature (K)

I'm using paraview-3.6.1-Linux-i686

I'm just getting started with writing and implementing filters, so the
problem is probably pretty obvious.  Thanks for any help!

Hi Ken,

First of all thank you very much for your response.

I see the DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS or UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS
sets operating on vtkInformation, which I don't call Update on. Should
I somehow be accessing the vtkDataObject of the vtkInformation (or
something else related to the pipeline as a whole) and call Update on
it?  That sounds like it is very likely my problem.

Right now
1. I run D3 within my data reader, I set the output to be D3->output,
then the _last thing_ I do is call:
 output->GetInformation()->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(), 1);
2. In a downstream filter which requires ghost cells, the _first
thing_ I do if running in parallel call:
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),1);

The documentation I can find on this is pretty fluffy ("filters can
request ghost cells"), so if anyone points me to something better it
would help tremendously (or even a good nugget of example code that I
missed in my grepping).

Cheers,
Christine

You can define both point and cell data in any block.  What else do you mean by mixing?

Message-ID: <C7305269.13C3F%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS key is used to request the number of ghost levels a filter is supposed to produce.  You set it on an algorithm's output information.  It is passed up the pipeline during the RequestUpdateExtent phase of execution and used during the computation in the RequestData phase.  The DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS is attached to the data object itself and identifies how many levels were created.

Most of the time the requested UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS is 0 until a filter needs a layer of ghost cells for proper operation, at which time it bumps up the UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS in its RequestUpdateExtent.  Yours is an uncommon case where you want the result of the pipeline to have ghost levels.

I think the trick is just to call something like

d3->GetOutputPortInformation(0)->Set(UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS, 1);

before calling Update should do the trick.

It's been since last year that I last tested the stereo capabilities, 
but to start ParaView with stereo, you use a --stereo on the command line.

Unfortunately AFAIK, the stereo type, eye separation, and focus are not 
exposed to the ParaView GUI and you would have to change them manually 
in the code and recompile.

IIRC, it supports interleaved frames, interlaced lines, checkerboard, 
anaglyph and a few other stereo types.

Hello!
I'm new to ParaView and Python and have the following question:

How can I "apply" the Clip Filter using Python?
I'm using ParaView 3.6.1 on Windows XP with the "Python Shell" from the Tools Menu.

My Python Script:
---------------------------
clip01=Clip()
clip01.InsideOut=1
clip01.ClipType = "Box"
clip01.ClipType.Scale=[0.5,0.5,0.5]
Show(clip01)

surface=ExtractSurface()
Show(surface)

Render()
---------------------------

I haven't found the possibilty to "apply" the Clip Filter via Python...I always have to press manually the "Apply" Button in the Object Inspector.

I've also tried:

>>> view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
>>> rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(shrinkFilter, view)
>>> view.StillRender()

out of the "Servermanger.pdf", but this creates a new window, which I don't want.
And also

>>> clip01.UpdatePipeline()

doesn't work.

There was a nearly similar question on this mailinglist, but it doesn't help me, I'm sorry:

http://markmail.org/thread/54kjzlk4i5d6sprh

Thank you for your work on ParaView! :-)

That's what I mean by mixing.

Hi 
Can vtk read dxf or dwg file?  I want to convert dxf file into vtk file format.I would like to know if anyone can give me some information about that. Thanks a lot!

To my knowledge (and I would love to be contradicted, so please let me  
know if I am wrong) it does not. I usually pass via a third party  
software (in my case GRASS as  I use GIS in my work) where I first  
import dxf files with v.in.dxf into the native GRASS format and then  
export them with v.out.vtk.

Thanks.I use 3d max convert the dxf format into  s3d format, and then VTK can read s3d.

Well, I don't know what else would be wrong.  Perhaps you could set a breakpoint in D3's RequestData to see what ghost level is being passed to it.

I tried this-still no ghost levels (the array is there, as before, but
the ghost level of everything is still 0).

I don't necessarily want the result of the pipeline to have ghost
levels (but would like to know how to do this anyway). My end goal is
to have my reader, which internally runs D3, produce ghost levels on
request of a downstream filter. Moreover, if a user doesn't use my
reader, uses the ParaView D3 in the pipeline, and then uses a filter
of mine which requests ghost level, I would like D3 to generate ghost
levels.

I am currently failing on both accounts.

Was the executable built with the stereo flags enabled?     You actually 
have to go in and muck with a source file to enable stereo.   It's not a 
configurable option (unless you consider "vi" a configuration tool!)    8-)

Hi,

after doing several tests / I found out that QT-4.5.2 does not generate this problem. Everything is ok now.

Michael - I tested your git version - the "make dmg" is pretty cool ! Is that something that could be included in the official cvs distribution ?

Best regards,

PO

Great to hear!

The "make dmg" IS pretty cool, but sometimes it just doesn't work  
properly. Sometimes they icons don't stick where they should  
(especially on 10.6, probably due to a bug in AppleScript), and  
sometimes the background doesn't show when the DMG is attached on  
another computer. Quite frustrating, but I don't have the time to  
debug it... Also, the DragNDrop installer stuff that comes with newer  
CMake versions offers the possibility to provide a .DS_Store file and  
a background image, without having to resort to AppleScript, but I  
never got that to work properly neither.

Subject: [Paraview] trouble getting base64 encoding to work in .vtu file
Message-ID: <2339db0c0911241518v292e692dled2ac6c16886b9c7@mail.gmail.com>

I have a .VTU file with all ASCII data values which loads fine into
ParaView.  I'm trying to instead write the data as format=binary or
format=appended base64 encoded which doesn't seem to be working.  I get the
error:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 544

vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0D842188): Cannot read cell data array
"material" from PointData in piece 0. The data array in the element may be
too short.

Here's the last dataarray input as binary.  Correct me if I'm wrong but 0
written as an UInt32 then encoded to base64 is "AAAAAA==".  So what am I
doing wrong?

...
<DataArray type="UInt32" Name="material" format="binary">
AAAAAA==
</DataArray>
...

Here is my data file (.vtu) as ASCII which works:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

Subject: [Paraview] vtkUniformGrid
Message-ID: <4B0CF409.8040500@inf.ethz.ch>

Hi

I'm writing a filter which creates a vtkUniformGrid as its output. The 
grid is setup is done using the following code:

    vtkUniformGrid *grid = 
vtkUnformGrid::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT));
    grid->Initialize();
    grid->SetOrigin(origin.data());
    grid->SetDimensions(bins.data());
    grid->GetDimensions(); // Call this so the dimensions array is set - 
stupid VTK
    grid->SetNumberOfScalarComponents(3);
    grid->SetScalarTypeToDouble();
    grid->SetSpacing(spacing.data());
    grid->AllocateScalars();

I checked that spacing, origin and bins are set correctly.

Yet, when I run this filter (without setting any data, that data will 
therefore be noise), I get an output in paraview without Extent, without 
an Origin and without a bounding box, 0 cells etc.

What am I doing wrong here?

Subject: [Paraview] Disabling auto-drawing in ParaView
Message-ID: <00d001ca6dc0$a48ca6b0$4f2810ac@win.ara>


Hi,

Is it possible to disable auto-drawing of data in ParaView after a filter is
applied? For example, I'd like to apply 3 filters, one after the other, but
I only want to see the result presented in the render window after the last
one has been applied. At the moment, after each filter is run, it
auto-redraws it on screen and can get a bit annoying.

Cheers,

Adriano

and always the same time value : STRANDID=0, SOLUTIONTIME=0
I tried to withdraw this line everywhere but I get another error:

Zhanping,
 
This method will not allow you to use any of the time-dependent filters, right (like FFT)?

Fred:
 
   The problem was actually caused by "STRANDID=0, SOLUTIONTIME=0". Currently the Tecplot reader, a simplified version, does not support loading time series data. If you really want load multiple time steps of data, you need to remove these two tokens from the zone header(s). And you need put each time step as an individual file, e.g., file000.tec, file001.tec, ... and et al. Then you can select all of them by means of 'file*.tec' when opening the file dialog. In this way, you will still be able to view the dataset at multiple steps.

 
   Sorry for the lack of time series data support and we are considering if we need to add it.
 
  Thanks.

Hi John

To compute this information, I need the whole bounding box of the
incoming object. I assume it's not saved in WHOLE_EXTENT as it seems
integer based. Which key stores that info so I can output it in my reader?

Thanks - I tried these keys in the request_data function and it did have
some effect (I obviously need to do it earlier...)

Hey Adriano,

I don't think ParaView is built to do this, although I can see where  
it would be a very useful feature for some applications (I think this  
is the standard behavior in LLNL's VisIt).

As a workaround, if your three filters are always the same you can  
combine them into a Custom Filter, exposing the parameters you need to  
adjust each time. This allows you to set up the pipeline for all three  
filters (inside the custom filter black box) and only update when you  
hit Apply at the end.

Hi Fred:

    Is that convenient for me to have a copy of the whole tecplot file
(including the actual zone data in addition to the zone title)? Then I will
be glad to check the problem by removing the time-series tokens (STRANDID
and TIMESOLUTION) first. There seem to be other tokens indicating some
functionalities that the current simplified reader does not support yet.

    Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Integrate Variables + Boxes
Message-ID: <4B0D7649.1020807@yahoo.de>

Today I had a funny time with th eIntegrate Variables Filter. I got
reasonable results for variables and volumes but both were negative
instead of positive.... Strange.
I also had some fun in positioning an ExtractMeshByRegion Box using
Tranlation/Rotation/Scale. Especially translation is unclear to me how
it works. Why does in not use the Center and length convention from the
Box-source? I used a box-source to position my extraction.

Message-ID: <145270ab0911251057r2d25f04drfb1443d4d9221c92@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on a python script to open MRI images in NIFTI format in
paraview. I'm using "simple.ImageReader" to read the volume data.
However, the file header specifies a 4x4 matrix which transforms voxel
indices to coordinates in a reference coordinate system in mm, and I
would like to use the mm coordinates in paraview.

There is a VTK thread on doing this
(http://old.nabble.com/world-coordinates-and-image-data-td22217332.html)
and the solution was to use "vtkImageReslice" together with a
transform using "vtkMatrix4x4". However, the "vtkImageReslice" filter
does not seem to be present in the VTK version that comes with
ParaView (3.6.1-r1 on Gentoo). (Apart from this I couldn't figure out
how to use VTK filters on "simple.ImageReader").

Since this didn't work, I tried a different method. The 4x4 matrix in
the file is usually purely rotational and translational, I can extract
the rotation and translation parameters for each dimension from the
matrix and then simply rotate and shift the Image object. This can be
done in Python using

...
simple.Show(img)
props = simple.GetDisplayProperties(img)
props.Orientation = (180*alpha/pi, 180*beta/pi, 180*gamma/pi)
props.Position     = (tx, ty, tz)
...

Where img is the "simple.ImageReader" object. This does rotate and
translate the volume (image). However, the problem is that if apply a
filter on it (e.g. Slice) the output of the filter is not shifted and
translated, and thus does not appear at the same location as the
image. I also tried using "simple.Transform" for the rotation and
translation, but it looks like it doesn't support Image objects as
input.

Any hints on how to do this are greatly appreciated.

vtkImageReslice seems to be in the source tarball on my Gentoo system.
There is a few issues on Gentoo may be you should file a bug.
Actually speaking of bugs can you take a screenshot? I cannot I get
"failed to create pixmap" and then a segfault. I cannot quite figure
what's wrong apart may be a bug in my openGL drivers.

Message-ID: <843C0A85-9E26-4BC3-B381-310E87A2DD27@cs.duke.edu>

Hey all,

I just noticed today that I can't volume render my Xdmf ImageData sets  
in CVS ParaView (today's -- OS X 10.5.8, serial build, Qt 4.5.2 cocoa,  
cmake 2.9.20091003).

With the binary PV 3.6.1 I can load in a temporal collection or single  
3DCoRectMesh and it  volume renders fine. With current 3.7 (now using  
vtkXdmfReader2, I assume), this data shows up as "Image (Uniform  
Rectilinear Grid) with blanking" and I can choose volume rendering but  
nothing shows up in the render window.

Volume rendering of a Wavelet Source works just fine, so I'm wondering  
what the "with blanking" part is, and if that's what's causing my  
trouble?

Thanks,
-Eric

Thanks Francois, I will try to find out why vtkImageReslice is
missing. About the screenshot, this seems to have something to do with
you graphics driver. For me, it only work with ati-drivers (Radeon
HD4830), it does not work with xf86-video-intel (Intel X3100) and
xf86-video-radeonhd (ATI X1300). It seems to have something to do with
this bug:

http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279060

I'm getting the "GL_VERSION_1_4_DEPRECATED" on the systems where it
doesn't work.

Ok, I found the vtkImageReslice filter:

from paraview.vtk.imaging import vtkImageReslice

I didn't realize that it was "hidden" in the imaging module. This
brings me back to the question on how to use vtkImageReslice with the
simple.ImageReader object. Is this possible, or do I have to use the
vtkImageReader instead?

best,

Martin

Dear all,

 

so based on the timer log results that i collected, what i read about offscreen-rendering and the explanation below, can i conclude the followings? someone pls correct me if i'm wrong!

 

with --use-offscreen-rendering


X windows are disabled on all server processes
all server processes render the geometry locally
then each server processes sends the image to the client for compositing
there's NO data gathering to process 0, meaning the master doesn't collect all images from each processes for composting, then only send it to the client for rendering
that's why --use-offscreen-rendering is faster
 

 

without --use-offscreen-rendering


X windows are enabled on all server processes
all server processes the raw data, then send all geometry to process 0
process 0 gather all geometry then send them to the client to render
the client does all the rendering job
that's why without --use-offscreen-rendering is slower
 

 

any help / reply is highly appreciated
 
Best Regards,
chewping

Subject: Re:[Paraview] Off Screen Rendering


hi chew ping?
  The Problem:"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled.", it means that not all server start up X Server, so the server will process the raw data and send all geometry to the client to render.
  The client do all the rendering job, that's the reason why case 2 is so slow, I think.
  When you use off screen, all server processes render the geometry locally , send image to client to composite, so case 1 much faster than case 2.
  I hope this can help you, for I got the same problem before. Good luck.

Dear all,
 
i'm doing parallel rendering using 2 machines (np4), i notice an obvious difference between using offscreen-rendering (faster) and without offscreen-rendering (much slower). i realize this from the timer log:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Unlike Case 2, Case 1 does not show any 'Dataserver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'
so i guess what makes Case 2 slower is because the vtkMPIMoveData is doing extra thing to move data amongst processes
 
btw, whenever i run it without -offscreen-rendering, i get this message:
"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled."
 
based on what i read from paraview tutorial, what i understand is that the parallel rendering algorithm allows each process to independently render its partition of the geometry and then composites the partial images together to form the final image. Is this what happened in Case 2 because it has 'Dataserver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'?
 
actually what i dont understand is why case 2 is much slower than case 1? 
is it because different 'things' are going on in the processes when offscreen-rendering is on/off?
 
 
any help / reply is highly appreciated

Hi Eric,

Thanks for the reply. Yeah, the custom filter route is an option, but I was
hoping that there would be a switch or at least a piece of code that could
be hacked to allow this to happen. I'll investigate further when I get a
chance.

cheers,

Hey Adriano,

I don't think ParaView is built to do this, although I can see where it
would be a very useful feature for some applications (I think this is the
standard behavior in LLNL's VisIt).

As a workaround, if your three filters are always the same you can combine
them into a Custom Filter, exposing the parameters you need to adjust each
time. This allows you to set up the pipeline for all three filters (inside
the custom filter black box) and only update when you hit Apply at the end.

You can very easily achieve the same effect by applying the filters
using the python shell. Until you call Show(), the data for that
filter won't be shown in the render view.

To keep the behavior consistent with the previous reader, I've changed
the vtkXdmfReader2 to produce vtkImageData for 2D/3DCoRectMesh.

There was another bug in the code that was incorrectly publishing
origin of the dataset as spacing which could have been messing up the
volume rendering. I've committed a fix. Feel free to give it a try
now.

Message-ID: <1259256673.9989.102.camel@martijn-laptop>

Hi,
This week I discovered ParaView and I am impressed (and a little
intimidated) by its possibilities.
A question: is a 2D equivalent of the "Surface Flow" filter? I have a
small 2D thermal simulation and would like to caluclated the flow over a
boundary: int (dT/dx, dT/dy)*n dl.

with kind regards,

Martijn

WHOLE_EXTENT, ORIGIN, and SPACING together should be able to give you
the bounding box.

any built in function rather than the one in the above website to convert
hdf to xdmf for visualization in vtk?(it read xmf format)
any help?
there is an xdmf source at http://www.xdmf.org.

   1. mkdir MyXdmf
   2. cd MyXdmf
   3. cvs -d ... login
   4. cvs -d ... co Xdmf This creates an Xdmf directory of the source code
   5. mkdir Linux
   6. cd Linux
   7. cmake ../Xdmf
   8. make

right now i'm completely under water about whether we need to install the
xdmf? how do i compile xdmf? for hdf we just use h5pcc to compile it. how
aboutxdmf?
help

i compiled as below.

Xdmf is a standalone library providing vtk readers and writers which are 
also integrated in Paraview. I don't know exactly what you want to do 
but if you generate hdf files already, you have to write an xdmf xml 
file by hand (or using like in the example a program/script generating 
text) describing your hdf structure so that you can then read it from 
Paraview or from another vis software using a vtkXdmfReader. In this 
case, I don't see why you would have to compile Xdmf by yourself since 
it's already included in Paraview/Visit.
If you have your own app though, use the vtkXdmfReader, include the 
necessary header files for using the vtkXdmfReader, link to the Xdmf 
library and that's it. There is no gcc/mpicc wrapper to compile programs 
using Xdmf like hdf5 does with h5pcc.

About something to generate xdmf files from hdf, we're currently working 
on something to help this.

I hope this helps you a bit.

Subject: [Paraview] MHD reader not available
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0911270108i47c62c17xd19c95285b2c5adb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The "Open file" dialog does not propose "Meta Image File" since a recent
checkout (2 days ago) of the CVS head. I investigated this problem:
- File ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml: The
description of the vtkMetaImageReader is name="Meta Image Reader". I found
weird to see spaces in the name, and there is no 'label' field
- File ParaView3/Applications/ParaView/ParaViewReaders.xml: The line
concerning MHD is "Meta Image Proxy", instead of "Meta Image Reader".

I am currently building a release ParaView, so I cannot test changes and
send a patch...

Hi!
I?ve recently compiled the filters I wrote for ParaView 3.4.0 to the new release ParaView 3.6.1. Filters with just one dataset as input work fine, but trying the ones with multiple input, I get the following error:

Hi, 
Sorry for the tardiness answer.
Finally, I achieved the code. The main problem was the input type.
I arrived to convert data from the filter ExtractSurface into data usable by the DataSetCSVWriter.


Thanks for your advice
Adrien

Using DataSetCSVWriter should do the trick.

Subject: [Paraview] how to use VTK filter on simple.ImageReader OR how to
	show VTK filter output in paraview
Message-ID: <145270ab0911270833t6b6cac8bw60cbff0f3e34fd22@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on a python script to open MRI volumes in NIFTI format in
paraview. In the NIFTI file, there is a 4x4 transform matrix to
transform voxel coordinates to normalized coordinates in mm. I would
like to use the mm coordinates in paraview. I can think of 2 methods
to accomplish this:

1: Use "simple.ImageReader" and "vtkImageReslice" with a
"vtkMatrix4x4" transform matrix.

In tried this method, but I can't figure out how to apply the
"vtkImageReslice" filter to the "simple.ImageReader" object.

2: Use "vtkImageReader" and "vtkImageReslice" with a "vtkMatrix4x4"
transform matrix.

In this case I don't know how to add the output of "vtkImageReslice"
to paraview (simple.Show() doesn't work).

Thanks,

Martin

You might want to refer to the Xdmf Wiki for the details on the format
for xdmf xmls.

http://xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format

Also look at the examples in the Xdmf source repository.

One you have a valid Xdmf xml i.e. xmf file describing the data in
your hdf5 file, you should be simply be able to load it into ParaView
using File | Open.

Subject: [Paraview] Developing plugins procedural question
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0911271646l3453ab16gd7b5b51da6abe122@mail.gmail.com>

Say I have written a VTK filter and the directory structure is as follows:
.../MyFilter/MyFilter.h
.../MyFilter/MyFilter.cxx
.../MyFilter/CMakeLists.txt

And it is built in
.../MyFilter/bin

I now want to make a Paraview plugin for it. I would like to keep it very
separate though so I can still have something to hand out to people who just
want the filter, and then have something extra that I could also provide if
people want the plugin. I tried to do the following:

Make a .../MyFilter/plugin directory.
Put the MyFilter.xml and a new CMakeLists.txt in that directory.
set SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES to ../vtkMyFilter.cxx (which is
.../MyFilter/MyFilter.cxx)

I then made .../MyFilter/plugin/bin and tried to build the plugin in this
directory. The problem seems to be that since vtkMyFilter.cxx includes
"vtkMyFilter.h", this header cannot be found since we are no longer in the
same directory that vtkMyFilter.h exists in.

I guess ideally I would like to have a .../MyFilter/CMakeListsPlugin.txt and
build it in .../MyFilter/plugin_bin, but as far as I understand cmake will
only let you read the configuration from a file named exactly
CMakeLists.txt.
Is there an easy solution to this? How do you guys do it?

Thanks,

David

Hi,

My own experience is the following:
I usually make a project with this directory structure:
./
./Algorithms
./Plugins
./(other stuffs)

a global CMakeLists defines different variables:
- ALGORITHM_PATH
- PLUGIN_PATH

A user-defined variable
- BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN

If the latter is on, then I add SUB_DIRS( PLUGIN_PATH )

In the Algorithm folder, a CMakeLists create a new library (say VTKAlgo lib)
and set a ALGORITHM_SRC variable that
contains the cxx and h. Obvously INCLUDE_DIR is set to this path too.
In the Plugin folder, a CMakeLists build the plugin. After the
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN, I add TARGET_LINK_LIBRARY( MyPlugin VTKAlgo)

This structure is quite convenient IMHO and I use it for any new project.
Final user can choose to build only the VTK lib or the ParaView plugin. For
extended project with other targets (such as GIMIAS), I simply have to add a
folder with properly defined CMake variable.

Subject: [Paraview] how to work on table type object
Message-ID: <1259407386.11053.12.camel@greenstar>

Hi everybody,
i have just loaded a big table in paraview (5 columns and 4000000 rows).
This table represent points from a laserscanner in polar coordinates.
So, before to use the "table to points" filter, i need to operate some
arithmetics operations on the data for obtaining cartesian coordinates.
I see i cannot directly use "programmable filter" or "calculator" on a
table object. How can i do this kind of operation on the table??

I have another question... im working on a dual core laptop... so i was
wondering about the possibility to set up a local server for rendering,
for enabling paraview to use both cpus and obtain a little speed-up
during rendering operations. Is it possible??


thousand thanks!!

Subject: [Paraview] 3D vector & contour plots from a set of scattered point
Message-ID: <5491ca830911280301teb1fbb7j4ca1d51f1418290@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I would like to generate 3D vector plots from a set of scattered data in
space (an ASCII file with x,y,z,u,v,w). I guess this should be rather
simple, but later on I want to generate 3D contour plots out of my data
(e.g. having contours based on the value of u^2+v^2+w^2 at each point).
Since I just have the value on scattered points in space, making those
contours will probably require extrapolation of my data to nodes of a
(regular) mesh. My question is that, how can I do those plots? with which
format should I import my data? Is paraview able to make contour plots with
scattered data points in 3D?

Thanks,
Nima

Nima,

Your first question has been discussed last month on this list, have a look at
http://markmail.org/message/36223zg4uleibiyj. David found the time to put the
question in FAQ style into the ParaView wiki. So, you can also look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Display_points_and_normals_from_a_plain_text_(x_y_z_nx_ny_nz)_file

I haven't faced the problem yet you describe in your second question. I'm
guessing you'll have to import your scattered data into ParaView (e.g. as CSV
data) and somehow come up with a regular grid in ParaView. This might be
possible using a Programmable Source or Sources - Data Object Generator, but I'm
not sure of that. Maybe someone else can point this out. Once you have a regular
grid, use the Resample with Dataset filter to interpolate your point data set(s)
to the regular grid and apply the Contour filter.

Hope this helps.

Sven

That seems to work great now, Utkarsh -- Thanks for the fast fix!

Can someone please explain what the "with blanking" is, though -- Is it a way to mask out certain blocks, or something? Is this something that is supported within Xdmf? Not a huge issue, but I was just curious...

Thanks again,
-Eric

Thanks a lot Sven,
I could generate vector plots. Still trying to find a way to do 3D contour
plots for my scattered points. As you said I need to have a mesh and to
interpolate my scalar value to nodes of that mesh. Does anyone have an idea
to do that?

Best,
Nima.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with the visualization of vector data
Message-ID: <730279.84820.qm@web23402.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I got a problem with the following data file in the vtk legacy format.
When I try to load it into paraview _I get the error message:

Generic Warning: In /home/kitware/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1382
Error reading ascii data. Possible mismatch of datasize with declaration.

There seems to be a problem with the data ranges of the vector data because in the information tab they are given as [0, 7.23169e-308], [0, 8.45559e-308], [0, 6.91926e-308], but I can' really see the problem.

Any help is appreciated.

It refers vtkUniformGrid. vtkUniformGrid has API to mark cells or
points as blank. vtkUniformGrid is a subclass of vtkImageData.

If you remove "LOOKUP_TABLE default" that should work fine.

Subject: [Paraview] Building plugin with sources in different directory
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0911290820x4f37213ap3d840ec72ba88b8e@mail.gmail.com>

If I have my cxx and h files for my filter in ..../MyFilter

then in ..../MyFilter/plugin I have the MyFilter.xml. I also have a
CMakeLists.txt containing

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPlugin "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyPlugin.xml
SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ../MyPlugin.cxx
)

You'll notice the ../MyPlugin.cxx because the filter sources are not
in the plugin directory.

When I try to build I get an error:
MyFilterClientServer.cxx error: MyFilter.h: No such file or directory

I'm assuming this is because it is looking in the current directory.
Is there a way to specify where the sources reside?

Thanks,

David

Is there a MyPlugin.h file and is it in the same directory as the .cxx? If I
recall correctly the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN sets up client/server wrappings and
makes an assumption that each source file you give it has a header file.

There is indeed a MyPlugin.h that is in the same directory as
MyPlugin.cxx. What I think the problem is though is the CMakeLists.txt
is not in the same directory as those source files.

The setup is like this
..../MyFilter/MyFilter.cxx
..../MyFilter/MyFilter.h
..../MyFilter/CMakeLists.txt
..../MyFilter/plugin/MyFilter.xml
..../MyFilter/plugin/CMakeLists.txt

The MyFilter CMakeLists SUBDIRS the plugin directory. The
plugin/CMakeLists.txt has

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyFilter "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyFilter.xml
SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ../MyFilter.cxx
)

I think the problem is that it is looking in ..../MyFilter/plugin for
the .h file. Am I misunderstanding? Is there a way to tell it where to
look (in this case, ../)?

Thanks,

Do you need to include_directories(../) ?

Yes, I think this is the cause. Your MyFilter/CMakeLists should define the
project and different variables such as the include folders. You asked me
out-of-list for my usual configurations: You may want to take a look at
http://github.com/jeromevelut/Chiron
This is a work-in-progress Medical Imaging Paraview plugin. Checkout the
Chiron-PoC branch (proof-of-concept). The structure will not change. In your
case, your root folder looks like my ./Modules/ folder and your ./plugin is
the same as my ./Plugins

I would not consider it a failure. There is still regular (although
not a lot) activity and we plan to pick the top ideas and implement
them. I believe that it is still the best way for us to get feedback.

Hi,

You can also look at the way the PointSprite plugin has been structured 
(path_to_paraview_src/Plugins/PointSprite)

In both Rendering and Graphics subdirectory, there is the usual 
CMakeLists.txt that creates a library usable from VTK, and in the 
ParaViewPlugin subdirectory, you have all the ParaView-related stuff.
The main difference are those lines at the end of the Rendering and 
Graphics CmakeLists.txt : 

# 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This make it easy for other projects to get the list of files etc. in 
this
# kit.
# 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# needed by vtkExportKit.cmake
include(${VTK_CMAKE_DIR}/vtkExportKit.cmake)
IF(NOT VTK_INSTALL_NO_DEVELOPMENT)
  STRING(REGEX REPLACE "^/" "" VTK_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR_CM24 
"${VTK_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR}")
ENDIF(NOT VTK_INSTALL_NO_DEVELOPMENT)

vtk_export_kit2(
  "CSCS_PointSprite_Rendering" 
  "POINTSPRITE_RENDERING" 
  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} 
  "${KIT_SRCS}"
)

This will create a "Kit" in the binary directory
and in the ParaViewPlugin CmakeLists.txt, you have : 
set(PLUGIN_NAME CSCS_PointSprite_Plugin)

set(CS_WRAP_Rendering)
include(${PointSpritePlugin_BINARY_DIR}/Rendering/vtkCSCS_PointSprite_RenderingKit.cmake)
foreach(class ${VTK_POINTSPRITE_RENDERING_CLASSES})
  set(CS_WRAP_Rendering ${CS_WRAP_Rendering} 
${VTK_POINTSPRITE_RENDERING_HEADER_DIR}/${class}.h)
endforeach(class)

    add_paraview_plugin(${PLUGIN_NAME} "1.0"
      SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES 
        "${SM_SOURCES};${CS_WRAP_Rendering};${CS_WRAP_Graphics}"
....
)

What this piece of magic does is wrap all the classes in the Rendering and 
Graphics subdirectories in the server-manager laguage, so that you can use 
those classes from proxies, xml and in the paraview python console.

There is indeed a MyPlugin.h that is in the same directory as
MyPlugin.cxx. What I think the problem is though is the CMakeLists.txt
is not in the same directory as those source files.

The setup is like this
..../MyFilter/MyFilter.cxx
..../MyFilter/MyFilter.h
..../MyFilter/CMakeLists.txt
..../MyFilter/plugin/MyFilter.xml
..../MyFilter/plugin/CMakeLists.txt

The MyFilter CMakeLists SUBDIRS the plugin directory. The
plugin/CMakeLists.txt has

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyFilter "1.0"
 SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyFilter.xml
SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ../MyFilter.cxx
)

I think the problem is that it is looking in ..../MyFilter/plugin for
the .h file. Am I misunderstanding? Is there a way to tell it where to
look (in this case, ../)?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Setup a Tiled-Display on a Windows XP Rendering Cluster
Message-ID: <4B13A010.4090407@ufz.de>

Hi,

I try to get a tiled display to work with ParaView, so here is my setup:
I have 3 Windows XP machines each equiped with graphic cards. Each
graphics card is connected to a monitor, so I want to get my ParaView
output on that three monitors. I start the pvserver on node01 in that way:
mpiexec -hosts 3 node01 node02 node03 pvserver.exe -tdx=3 -tdy=1

On another Windows XP machine I start the ParaView-Client application
and I can connect to the server succesfully. On my client I also see the
rendered image.

But on the three monitors connected to three nodes of the server nothing
is visible. So how can I drive my tiled display with ParaView?

When searching the net I always find tips for setting up a tiled display
for Linux only. Is it possible at all to drive a tiled display from
Windows XP machines??

Thanks in advance!!

Message-ID: <9BC9FBFF861642438F019598EBB769AD2DE4CF62B7@DU-EXC-MAIL.empa.emp-eaw.ch>

Hello everybody

I apologize in advance for the trivial question. I'm not an experienced user of Paraview.

I have to apply a glyph filter to a VTK unstructure grid dataset for a set of particles + bonds among particles.
The chosen glyph is a sphere.

Usually I have to apply this glyph many times, to different .vtu files and every time I have to set up the glyph parameters.

Is there any way to create a custom filter of the type of a glyph with already a fixed parameter setup ?
Which is the best approach for getting to that ? A custom filter (but it seems it dies not allow to fix the filter parameters) ? A macro ? A plugin ?

Thanks in advance for your help

Best regards

Michele

Message-ID: <C7394BAD.F436%kmorel@sandia.gov>

What is the type of your data?  This is a total guess, but is it possible that your cells are inverted?  That is, the topology defined in such a way that the points of the cells are defined in the wrong order such that the same faces are defined but in a clockwise instead of counterclockwise order (or vice versa).  This could make the cells look right but cause volume calculations to become inverted.

That's a good point about the Box 3D widget.  The Box 3D widget was originally designed for the transform filter.  Thus, its transformation is relative to the bounding box of the original data.  This makes sense for the translate filter where these values will correspond to the affine transformation applied by the filter.  For filters like clip and extract cells by region, I can see how this makes far less sense.

I'm not totally sure what the best way to parameterize the box is.  Should it be the coordinates of two opposite corners?  Should it be center and lengths?  What about rotations? (Do we care about rotations?)

David,

Jerome's suggested structure is good.  But if you are lazy like me and just want to get the darn thing to work, simply adding

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/..)

to the MyFilter/plugin/CMakeLists.txt file should do the trick.

Hi,

My own experience is the following:
I usually make a project with this directory structure:
./
./Algorithms
./Plugins
./(other stuffs)

a global CMakeLists defines different variables:
- ALGORITHM_PATH
- PLUGIN_PATH

A user-defined variable
- BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN

If the latter is on, then I add SUB_DIRS( PLUGIN_PATH )

In the Algorithm folder, a CMakeLists create a new library (say VTKAlgo lib) and set a ALGORITHM_SRC variable that
contains the cxx and h. Obvously INCLUDE_DIR is set to this path too.
In the Plugin folder, a CMakeLists build the plugin. After the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN, I add TARGET_LINK_LIBRARY( MyPlugin VTKAlgo)

This structure is quite convenient IMHO and I use it for any new project. Final user can choose to build only the VTK lib or the ParaView plugin. For extended project with other targets (such as GIMIAS), I simply have to add a folder with properly defined CMake variable.

2009/11/28 David Doria <daviddoria at gmail.com>
Say I have written a VTK filter and the directory structure is as follows:
.../MyFilter/MyFilter.h
.../MyFilter/MyFilter.cxx
.../MyFilter/CMakeLists.txt

And it is built in
.../MyFilter/bin

I now want to make a Paraview plugin for it. I would like to keep it very separate though so I can still have something to hand out to people who just want the filter, and then have something extra that I could also provide if people want the plugin. I tried to do the following:

Make a .../MyFilter/plugin directory.
Put the MyFilter.xml and a new CMakeLists.txt in that directory.
set SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES to ../vtkMyFilter.cxx (which is .../MyFilter/MyFilter.cxx)

I then made .../MyFilter/plugin/bin and tried to build the plugin in this directory. The problem seems to be that since vtkMyFilter.cxx includes "vtkMyFilter.h", this header cannot be found since we are no longer in the same directory that vtkMyFilter.h exists in.

I guess ideally I would like to have a .../MyFilter/CMakeListsPlugin.txt and build it in .../MyFilter/plugin_bin, but as far as I understand cmake will only let you read the configuration from a file named exactly CMakeLists.txt.
Is there an easy solution to this? How do you guys do it?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Python VTK readers
Message-ID: <BAY109-W722F7D890D5082F4A4901B2970@phx.gbl>


With the Python API, is there a reader for:
  - reading legacy VTK files? I tried LegacyVTKFileReader but got "NameError: name 'LegacyVTKFileReader' is not defined"
  - reading any VTK file? I mean a general VTK file reader able to call the appropriate reader, such as vtkDataSetReader in Tcl
  - some way to just read the header of a file and get the dataset type, in order to check if the file type is appropriate for a given processing task?

It's called "LegacyVTKReader"

The equivalent of vtkDataSetReader is indeed the "LegacyVTKReader".

How to plan on checking if the file type is appropriate? Not sure what
you are trying to do here.

That is correct with two clarifications:

The ?with ?use-offscreen-rendering? explanation is only correct for when ParaView is compiled with OSMesa.

The ?without ?use-offscreen-rendering? behavior only happens because the servers try to open X windows and fail.

Dear all,

so based on the timer log results that i collected, what i read about offscreen-rendering and the explanation below, can i conclude the followings? someone pls correct me if i'm wrong!

with --use-offscreen-rendering

 *   X windows are disabled on all server processes
 *   all server processes render the geometry locally
 *   then each server processes sends the image to the client for compositing
 *   there's NO data gathering to process 0, meaning the master doesn't collect all images from each processes for composting, then only send it to the client for rendering
 *   that's why --use-offscreen-rendering is faster


without --use-offscreen-rendering

 *   X windows are enabled on all server processes
 *   all server processes the raw data, then send all geometry to process 0
 *   process 0 gather all geometry then send them to the client to render
 *   the client does all the rendering job
 *   that's why without --use-offscreen-rendering is slower


any help / reply is highly appreciated

Subject: Re:[Paraview] Off Screen Rendering

hi chew ping?
  The Problem:"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled.", it means that not all server start up X Server, so the server will process the raw data and send all geometry to the client to render.
  The client do all the rendering job, that's the reason why case 2 is so slow, I think.
  When you use off screen, all server processes render the geometry locally , send image to client to composite, so case 1 much faster than case 2.
  I hope this can help you, for I got the same problem before. Good luck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


Unlike Case 2, Case 1 does not show any 'Dataserver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'
so i guess what makes Case 2 slower is because the vtkMPIMoveData is doing extra thing to move data amongst processes

btw, whenever i run it without -offscreen-rendering, i get this message:
"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled."

based on what i read from paraview tutorial, what i understand is that the parallel rendering algorithm allows each process to independently render its partition of the geometry and then composites the partial images together to form the final image. Is this what happened in Case 2 because it has 'Datas erver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'?

actually what i dont understand is why case 2 is much slower than case 1?
is it because different 'things' are going on in the processes when offscreen-rendering is on/off?


any help / reply is highly appreciated

chewping

All coordinates in VTK/ParaView are in R^3.  However, if you define your data in the x-y plane (that is, z == 0 for all coordinates) then Surface Flow should give you the correct answer.

Message-ID: <COL109-W56556631C762F4D704E19E82970@phx.gbl>


Hello, folks;

As everyone undoubtedly knows, when Paraview 3.6 came into service there had been a lot of major changes done to the Python API. The problem that I am currently facing is that calls to TextureMapToSphere no longer seem to be functioning. Either it has been moved to a location I have not been able to discover or there is something inherently wrong with it now. Another friend of mine is also having trouble with this filter, so it would appear not to be an isolated event at face value. In Paraview 3.4 this filter functions with no problems. Perhaps when the texture-mirroring problem (when applying textures to spheres for instance) was being addressed, a mistake may have been made. Any information regarding this problem would be most appreciated. Thanks.

Luca,

You can always apply TableToPoints filter first and then apply the
calculator or python programmable filter to transform the points to
the correct coordinate system.

Looks like your filter vtkGroupToVectorFilter is returning error in
RequestDataObject(). Try debugging into it to see why it's returning 0
for that method.

The streaming paraview application does this via a big hack. See
specifically pqCustomDisplayPolicy::getHideByDefault(). I plan to
expose this via a branded app behavior shortly.

Subject: [Paraview] Error Compiling a Plugin for PV 3.6.1
Message-ID: <DF5D5C5F-6644-497B-8624-097CA3B7825D@bluequartz.net>

I am getting the following error when compiling my Plugin (which  
involves a custom Object panel)..

[ 98%] Generating moc_pqMXADataModelReaderPanelImplementation.cxx
cd /Users/Shared/OpenSource/ParaView3-3.6.1/Build/MXADataModelReader

moc_pqMXADataModelReaderPanelImplementation.cxx] Error 1
make[1]: *** [MXADataModelReader/CMakeFiles/ 
MXADataModelReaderPanel.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2



and the offending line of code is:

   Q_INTERFACES(pqObjectPanelInterface);

Not really sure what the issue is. Been racking my head most of the  
afternoon. Any help or nudges in any direction is much appreciated.

Hey Nima,

I don't know if this will be a useable solution for you, but based on  
your notes I tried generating a point cloud (centered on the origin,  
100 points with radius 10) in ParaView, then using the calculator  
filter I generated a scalar value on each node which is the magnitude  
of the x, y, z coordinate vector: mag(coords). Instead of trying to  
sample the data points onto a regular grid, I used the Delaunay3D  
filter (with default parameters) to generate tetrahedra, which can be  
used for volume visualization, contouring, etc. Here is a screen shot  
of the point cloud colored by that vector magnitude (blue-white-red  
colormap), and six contours which have been clipped to show the insides.

Again, not sure if this is the type of solution you were looking for,  
but it interpolates the vector magnitude values and allows you to  
generate contours.

Talk to you later,
-Eric
