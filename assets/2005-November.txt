Hi Kent,

Please try to put the line:

after the rest of the class lines.

Let me know if this fixes your problem.

Thank you.

Message-ID: <6.2.5.6.2.20051102133327.02e23868@kitware.com>

Hi All,

The ParaView 2.4 beta release (version 2.4.0) is now available for 
download from the ParaView web site: 
http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html.  It is also available 
through CVS; the tag is ParaView-2-4-0.  If you find bugs in the 
release, please e-mail me; preferably also send me a patch file to 
fix the problem.  There have been several changes since the 2.2 
release of ParaView; they include the following.

* Improved multi-block and AMR support. Since ParaView 2.2, there has 
been various improvements to the multi-group code. These include bug 
fixes, filter and reader improvements. The EnSight and PLOT3D readers 
have been converted to read multi-block datasets. XML based writers 
and readers for all supported multi-group datasets have been added.

* Movies and screen captures are now rendered offscreen. This works 
on all platforms with the new offscreen support.

* Better handling of empty data. This situation commonly occurs when 
dealing with distributed data. Some of the nodes may have empty data. 
Some filters misbehaved when encountering empty datasets.

* Better handling of failure to open display on server side (on X). 
If the render server cannot open one or more of it's displays, 
compositing is disabled and the user is warned.

* Fixed bug that prevented certain writers from working in server/client mode.

* New and improved Spy Plot CTH reader:
   - Lower memory footprint
   - Ability to down-convert volume fraction to unsigned char
   - Store data arrays as float (instead of double)

* Support for ParaView internals scripts
   - Sites can customize paraview to perform certain tasks when run 
with special arguments
   - For example, "paraview script:ExodusMeta <exodus file> <meta 
file>" will load an exodus file with a meta file.

* Support for selecting functions from Plot3D files

* Data page shows list of arrays with their type, number of 
components, and value range

* Initial support for Python wrapping


The web site lists precompiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and Mac 
OSX.  Hope you enjoy the new release.

Fixed it! Maybe the gnu compiler became less tolerant in FC4?

Thanks!

Hello,

I am trying to add a new reader to paraview. I am using paraview version 
2.2.1 on a
Fedora Core 2.0 linux distro. Paraview builds fine. I am following the 
instructions in
the paraview guide version 1.8 and the instructions in the PVLocal 
directory. I was
able to compile the "local cone source" example. When I import the package into
paraview it works fine.

As a first step, I wrote a new reader and tested it in VTK. The new reader 
builds a structured points dataset. I then copied the new reader .h and 
.cxx file into the
PVLocal directory and made the recommended changes in the Cmake and xml
files. I also included the required config files in my .cxx file. I am able 
to compile the
new reader and create a shared library but the shared library has an undefined
symbol corresponding to my reader. Paraview does not like that. When I
try to import the package I get an error. I have included the header file 
for my
reader and the two xml files with this message. If anyone sees what I am doing
wrong a hint would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Dave

Is there any way os reading Ensight server-of-server files in serial mode?

I know that it does not make sense since server-of-server is a file format
for parallel purposes but I would like to know how to load multiple datasets
(case files corresponding to several MPI partitions) in serial mode or any
other way of doing it...

The release note of the ParaView 2.4 tells about Ensight (and PLOT3D)
readers for multi-block datasets and I was thinking if it could solve my
problem. Is there an example of the XML file used to specify how Paraview
should read the Ensight files?

Thanks for any help.

No.  In order to read a server-of-servers (SOS) file, you must have 
at least as many processes (i.e., pvserver or pvdataserver nodes) as 
files listed in the SOS file.

The release note about EnSight and PLOT3D refers to the data output 
from the EnSight and PLOT3D readers.  Previously, these two readers 
produced multiple data sets on output.  Now, their output is a single 
multi-block data set containing the multiple data sets as 
sub-datasets.  ParaView does not use an XML file in reading EnSight 
files; it reads the EnSight case and SOS files directly.

This might be a good time for us users to make suggestions for the next 
edition of "The ParaView Guide". Kitware must of course make any final 
decisions based on business considerations.

---

1) Binding

Go to wire so it lays flat and pages don't fall out. I almost have to take 
my copy around in a bag.

2) Split into Two Books

One for users, one for developers. This would reduce the cost for users not 
interested in development.

3) Online Examples

Some publishers have a web site for each of their books containing example 
code and corrections. There are already many examples of ParaView code (in 
C++, XML and so on) at various locations. Adding more, as appropriate, 
putting it all in one place, and referencing it from the book might be 
helpful.

4) Online Comments

"Shadow" the book at the ParaView site with an area for each numbered 
section of the book. Each area would contain user-supplied comments and 
suggestions. The Wiki might be a way to implement this.

5) Cost Tradeoff Questions

In some cases Kitware may ask (or setup a vote process) to get user 
opinions on some questions. Ex: Would you pay $4 more for wire binding?

---

If anybody else cares about these issues, and there are a ton of other 
ideas, it would help if someone began to collect the ideas into a list 
(maybe with a way for a viewer to "vote").

Hi Amy,

I see what you mean but there isn't any other way of reading parallel data
with Paraview running in serial mode besides having to read each piece of
data separately?

I'm insisting on it because not always we have a parallel rendering (or data
server) system in hand to post-process parallel data. Suppose you have ran a
parallel problem in a 64 CPUs machine and this machine is dedicated only to
solve simulation problems (without any rendering support or with data access
restrict), thus, you have to copy all pieces of data to a serial graphic
workstation and read each piece of data one-by-one manually. 

I think that visualization softwares should work with parallel file formats,
like SOS, even when running in serial mode. It would be another feature of
the parallel format and I guess it's not hard to implement.

Thanks for your explanation

The ParaView nightly documentation has not been refreshed all week.  Is
there a reason for this?

Renato,
 
Many of the readers will read in parallel files with just a serial paraview (Exodus, SAF, pvd, etc).
 
If the paraview SOS reader does not support that than please enter a feature request in the bug tracker and Sandia will pay to have the that functionality added to the SOS reader. :)
 
Best,

Hi Amy,

I see what you mean but there isn't any other way of reading parallel data
with Paraview running in serial mode besides having to read each piece of
data separately?

I'm insisting on it because not always we have a parallel rendering (or data
server) system in hand to post-process parallel data. Suppose you have ran a
parallel problem in a 64 CPUs machine and this machine is dedicated only to
solve simulation problems (without any rendering support or with data access
restrict), thus, you have to copy all pieces of data to a serial graphic
workstation and read each piece of data one-by-one manually.

I think that visualization softwares should work with parallel file formats,
like SOS, even when running in serial mode. It would be another feature of
the parallel format and I guess it's not hard to implement.

Thanks for your explanation

No.  In order to read a server-of-servers (SOS) file, you must have
at least as many processes (i.e., pvserver or pvdataserver nodes) as
files listed in the SOS file.

The release note about EnSight and PLOT3D refers to the data output
from the EnSight and PLOT3D readers.  Previously, these two readers
produced multiple data sets on output.  Now, their output is a single
multi-block data set containing the multiple data sets as
sub-datasets.  ParaView does not use an XML file in reading EnSight
files; it reads the EnSight case and SOS files directly.

Hello again,

I was able to figure out how to create a new reader for paraview. The problem I
described in my previous message went away when I used the correct
vtkTypeMacro. I am able to use the new reader to get data into paraview and
do a few things with it.

One thing that does not seem to work is the ExtractGrid filter. When I try to
use this filter with my data the VOI min and max values are all large 
negative numbers. My reader creates a structured points data set. How does 
the ExtractGrid filter get
the data extents from the upstream data source in paraview? I have looked 
at other
reader code in paraview like the plot3d reader and there does not seem to 
be any
special magic that I can find.

Thanks,
Dave

Message-ID: <20051106161455.WPNZ15059.tomts46-srv.bellnexxia.net@[209.226.175.82]>

Hi,

I am trying to build KWWidgets cvs on Win XP with Borland C++,
VTK cvs, CMake 2.0.6.  The problems are with .res files while
compiling the Examples:


:/Builder/Releases/KWWidgets/Examples/Cxx/SimpleWindow: building default_target

I made a few modifications to KWWidgets/Resources/KWWidgets.rc.in so
that some of the paths could be found, as it seems at least for
Borland, the generated .rc file has internal relative paths that it
cannot find, so I added  @KWWidgets_SOURCE_DIR@, hard coded the path to windows.h,
and added @VTK_DIR@ to find vtkConfigure.h:


#include "@KWWidgets_SOURCE_DIR@/Resources/KWWidgets.rc.h"

// The icon whose name or resource ID is lexigraphically first, is used
// as the application's icon.
// Tk was defining app.

Now I have the following errors due to the .res file:

And this is where I am now stumped... :(
I think most of this can be configured properly
by CMake, but I don't know a lot about resource files
in Borland but have this info from Builder/help 

There are several Borland command-line resource tools:

Resource compiler

BRCC32.EXE is the Borland resource compiler. It compiles resource script files 
(.RC files) and produces the binary .RES file.

Resource linkers

RLINK32.DLL is the Borland resource linker that binds resources, in .RES file form, 
to an .EXE file, and marks the resulting .EXE file as a Windows executable. 
RLINK32.DLL is accessed through ILINK32.EXE.

Resource shells

BRC32.EXE is a shell through which BRCC32 and RLINK32 (through ILINK32) 
can be started in a single step.


BRCC32 is the command-line version of the resource compiler. It accepts 
a resource script file (.RC) as input and produces a resource object file
 (.RES) as output.

Syntax

BRCC32 [options] <filename>.RC

Command-line options

BRCC32 accepts these options:

Option	Description

@responsefile	Takes instructions from the specified command file.
-c <code page>	Uses the specified code page for resource translation. 
                If -c is not used, the default ANSI code page is used.
-d<name>[=<string>]	Defines a preprocessor symbol.
-fo<filename>	Renames the output .RES file. (By default, BRCC32 creates 
                the output .RES file with the same name as the input .RC file.)
-i<path>	Adds one or more directories (separated by semicolons) to 
                the include search path.


-l<language>	Specifies default language.
-m	Indicates that the code page specified with the -c switch contains 
        double-byte character set (DBCS) characters.
-r	This switch is ignored. It is included for compatibility with 
        other resource compilers.
-v	Prints progress messages (verbose).
-x	Deletes the current include path.
-? or -h	Displays help.
-16	Builds a 16-bit resource.
-32	Builds a 32-bit resource.

RLINK32 combines a .RES file with an .EXE file to produce a new Windows 
executable. RLINK32 accepts as input 
one or more object (.RES) files and a single Windows executable file. 
RLINK32 links the resources by fixing 
up string tables and message tables and then binding these linked 
resources into the executable. RLINK32 is 
called by ILINK32 and is used for 32-bit resources.

The Borland resource compiler (BRC32) is a resource compiler shell. 
It invokes BRCC32 and RLINK32, depending on the command-line syntax.

Syntax

brc32 [options] <filename>.RC [<filename>.EXE]

Command-line options

BRC32 accepts these options:

Switch	Description

-d<name>[=string]	Defines a symbol you can test with the #IFDEF preprocessor 
                        directive.
-fo<filename>	Renames the .RES file.
-fe<filename>	Renames the .EXE file.
-i<path>	Adds one or more directories (separated by semicolons) to the 
                include search path.
-r	Creates a .RES file only. The compiled .RES file is not added to the .EXE.
-v	Prints progress messages (verbose listing).
-x	Directs the compiler to ignore the INCLUDE environment variable when it 
         searches for include or resource files.

-16	Builds 16-bit .RES files.
-32	Builds 32-bit .RES files.
-Vd.d	Makes the .EXE file with Windows version provided (v3.1 is the default for
         16-bit resources; -v4.0 is the default for 32-bit resources). Version
        options are listed in the following table.

Option	Bit	Resulting look

3.1	16	Gives white background with a non 3-D look for Windows 3.1x, Windows 32s, or WinNT 3.1
4.0	16	Gives gray 3-D look for Windows 95 and WinNT 3.51
3.1	32	Gives white background with a non 3-D look for Windows 32s or WinNT 3.1
4.0	32	Gives gray 3-D look for Windows 95 and WinNT 3.51

The following switches are invalid when the -r switch is specified:

-k	Disables the contiguous preload of segments and resources in the .EXE file. 
        Segments are kept in the order in which they appear in the .DEF file. (This 
        option only applies to 16-bit resources.) 
-t	Creates an application that runs only in protected mode (Windows Standard or 
       386 Enhanced mode).

Huh, weird. The extent is obtained by the reader's output's whole extent.
The reader or the module do not have to provide anything for this to work.
Is your reader setting the whole extent properly?

Ya weird. I set the whole extend in the ExecuteInformation routine as per the
documentation. Should it be set somewhere else?

Subject: [Paraview] Animation crashes
Message-ID: <000d01c5e3fb$c319edc0$c17ba8c0@MM140>

I have been trying to use paraview to animate 3d Resistivity models.

Loading a rectilinear grid (vtk datafile version 2.0), then using threshold
to view at various threshold levels. The setting of keyframes after either
rotating the data or changing the threshold values work. The problem comes,
when I try to do the following:
1) change the number of frames from 10 to anywhere between 40 and 100.
2) trying to save the animation in the jpeg, avi or mpeg2 format.

Sometimes the first will work but not always. I have rarely managed to
produce an animation file.  It will use lots of memory and then crash. The
machine is 2.61 Ghz Athlon 64 Fx-55 with 3.25 GB of Ram.

Thanks in advance
Mary Muir

ParaView animation can be very memory hungry when used with Caching.
When caching is enabled, it caches (in memeory) the geometry for every
frame rendered.

*  Try turning caching off.

Hi Mary,

Is the "Cache Geometry" check box marked (assuming the "Play Mode" is 
set to "Sequence")?  If it is, then try unchecking it and saving out 
your animation again.  When that checkbox is on, then ParaView tries 
to keep a copy of your geometry at each time step in memory.  If you 
have several time steps and non-trivial data, this can be more than 
will fit in memory, which would cause ParaView to crash.

Message-ID: <FBEIKIAGJCCFIBIPBIGMEEEKCFAA.dean.inglis@camris.ca>

Hi Sebastien,

it seems the Borland compiler prefers to create .lib
and .obj files first for the .cxx examples in KWWidgets/Examples 
with .res files and then on the second round of compiling create the
.exe and link in the resource file to it.  So the compiler wants 
bcc32 -c (compile to object)
and then again without -c 
I'm not sure how to do this with CMake though...
I also had to add the following Borland directive to get
the resource to link (for example, after the #includes in
KWSimpleWindowExample.cxx) :

#pragma resource "KWSimpleWindowExample.res"


Also, in the root CMakeLists.txt file, why do you link
htmlhelp.lib to KWWidgets.lib ?  I ran into a (name mangling?)
problem:
Error: unresolved external 'HtmlHelpA' referenced from
KWWIDGETS.LIB|vtkKWApplication

so I commented out 
   # INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${HTML_HELP_INCLUDE_PATH})
   # TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(KWWidgets ${HTML_HELP_LIBRARY} )
   # SET (KWWIDGETS_HAS_HTML_HELP 1)
 # ELSE(HTML_HELP_INCLUDE_PATH AND HTML_HELP_LIBRARY)

in the root CMakeLists.txt to try to compile the examples.
I thought the HtmlHelp compiler was only needed for the 
doxygen scripts.

I think the resource files for Borland are handled differently. Or at 
least there is an extra step...
Can you do a google on that one ?

Subject: [Paraview] Problems Including Custom Class At Compile In 2.4
Message-ID: <DE76F3273A2A90BF57FD64BD@harpo.psc.edu>

I'm adding a reader to ParaView 2.4 on Fedora Core 4 using the approach 
described in

   <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend>

cmake and make seem to work except for the following near the end of the 
messages from make:

===
./GUI/Scripts: building default_target

RegularExpression::compile(): ?+* follows nothing.
RegularExpression::compile(): Error in compile.
cmake.depends is up-to-date

./Data: building default_target
Building dependencies. cmake.depends...
cmake.depends is up-to-date
===

There is no "?+*" in anything I've added. Running the version of "paraview" 
created by this results in the following error:

===
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
  what():  basic_string::_S_construct NULL not valid
Abort
===

The splash window with the logos appears but the main application window 
does not.

Can anyone tell what is wrong?

Hi Kent,

The regular expression thing was fixed and it will be in the next patch
release.

Could you please run ParaView in debugger and send us the stack trace?

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20051108123455.04106ca8@mail.ncsa.uiuc.edu>


There is an extent entry widget on the properties tab of the extract grid 
filter. Where
does the extract grid filter get the min/max values to use in that widget? 
I have a
reader that works in paraview, ie I get data read in, but the min/max 
values are wrong
when I use the extract grid filter on it. I am setting all the extents I 
can find on the
output of the reader which is a structured points data set. I am using paraview
version 2.2.1. I have tried to trace through other reader code to see what 
I am
not setting but cant find any differences. Is it perhaps the case that the 
extract grid
filter gets the VOI min max values from the reader itself rather than the 
output of the
reader? Any pointers to where to look in the paraview code would be 
appreciated.

Thanks
Dave

Subject: [Paraview] Tcl installation path in 2.4.0
Message-ID: <1131594002.6156.32.camel@omega>

I am trying to build a FC3 rpm for 2.4.0 using the same procedure
I successfully used for 2.2.1, but I am having problems with the
compiled-in Tcl path that I am unable to resolve.

I want to install each version of paraview into its own tree and
not scattered about like the default setup.  Building an rpm, I
also need to install it into a temporary root (rpm_build_root)
and not /.  To this end I tweaked the CMakeLists.txt file to set
the PV_INSTALL_{LIB,INCLUDE,DATA}_DIR variables to simply
${PV_INSTALL_ROOT}/{lib,include,share}.  I also set
TclTk_INSTALL_LIB_DIR to ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR}.  (I note that the
2.4.0 CMakeLists.txt file included this latter change too.)  When
I ran cmake, I set PV_INSTALL_ROOT to /opt/paraview/2.4.0, and
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to /var/tmp/paraview.

The 2.4.0 rpm installs everything where I intended, and paraview
runs fine if I invoke it with the full path.  But if I add the
bin directory to my path, and invoke it with just 'paraview' I
get the following error message:

ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed
Tcl_Init error: Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following
directories:
    /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 /opt/src/rpm/lib/tcl8.4 /opt/src/lib/tcl8.4 ...

I don't know where it's picking up those directories, but none of
them are correct (obviously); it's in /opt/paraview/2.4.0/lib/tcl8.4

As I said before, this same build procedure with 2.2.1 works absolutely
correctly.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I really don't understand
cmake.

Thanks!

This is a known problem, and it has been corrected on the CVS branch 
for ParaView 2.4 (CVS tag ParaView-2-4).  (It was a problem in the 
code, not in how you tried to install ParaView.)  If you check this 
version out from CVS, you should be able to compile and install 
ParaView as you did for ParaView 2.2.

FYI, the default setup follows the conventions of debian packages. 
Multiple paraview versions can share the same installation prefix if one 
just renames the executables in the bin directory to have version numbers.

You don't need to change the CMakeLists.txt file to configure the 
install locations.  The default settings will not be used if you set the 
variables in the CMake cache.  This should do what you want:

cmake -DPV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR:PATH=/bin \
       -DPV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR:PATH=/lib \
       -DPV_INSTALL_DATA_DIR:PATH=/share \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/paraview/2.4.0 \
       ../paraview-2.4.0 &&
make &&
make install DESTDIR=/var/tmp/paraview

The tcl library itself tries to compute a bunch of paths in which to 
look for init.tcl.  I don't know why it selects these paths.

Subject: [Paraview] Reader Problem
Message-ID: <s37365fe.058@co.mgn.netl.doe.gov>

Hi all,
 
I wrote a custom reader that brings our simulation results into
ParaView.  
 
The data is an unstructured grid with multiple timesteps.  The cells
are either hexahedron or wedges.  The data I attach to the mesh is
mostly scalar with a few vectors.
 
With most of the simulation results we look at the reader looks fine,
but some of the data sets cause the following error.
 
free(): invalid pointer 0xc2f7f70!
 
This error happens after my code executes and I have returned the
unstructured grid over to ParaView.
 
I have done the following to debug the problem:
 
1. I checked the number of arrays that I am attaching to the mesh and
the NumberOfCellFields variable, these match.
 
2. I checked the MaxId of all the arrays.  These match the cell count.
 
3. When I turn all the cell arrays off, I don't get the errors, and the
mesh loads.
 
Does anyone have any ideas on what the problem could be?
 
Thanks,

How are you associating the data with the vtk dataset? Do you read an array
and hand it to a vtk array? Also, can you run in a debugger and get a track
trace? If you are running on Linux, valgrind would be even better.

Message-ID: <BAY101-F1912F00A263D29BF5E0239EA590@phx.gbl>

I am using Paraview version 2.2 to read a StructuredGrid. If I create more 
than one "piece" in the same file, it displays only the last piece entered 
and ignores the others. Is this what you would expect? I would like to 
display multiple pieces using in the same file. If this cannot be done I 
guess I will have to use an unstructured grid.

Thanks

Steve,

I believe the following will work:

1) Place each of your parts in a 'part<n>.vts' file.
2) Create a "mother" file -- myparts.pvd
  (see "paraView Guide," page 177)

For example,

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet part="0000" file="msh0000.vts" name="The Mesh"/>
    <DataSet part="0001" file="mns0001.vts" name="NSet:0033
Label:OUTPUT_NODES"/>
    <DataSet part="0002" file="mns0002.vts" name="NSet:3002
Label:LEFT_END"/>
    <DataSet part="0003" file="mns0003.vts" name="NSet:3003
Label:RIGHT_END"/>
    <DataSet part="0004" file="mss0004.vts" name="SSet:0200
Label:BAR_1_SURFACE"/>
    <DataSet part="0005" file="mss0005.vts" name="SSet:0300
Label:BAR_2_SURFACE"/>
    <DataSet part="0006" file="mws0006.vts" name="WSet:0100 Label: MPCON4"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

name="abc" is a very handy, yet-to-be-documented token in
<DataSet ... /> thanks to Brad King.

The Extract Parts filter will let you select the the parts to be
displayed (name="abc" info shows up on the Extract Parts
face sheet).

Is this a multiblock dataset? ParaView 2.4 and VTK 5 support multiblock
datasets. You have to create a .vtm file. The vtm file supports multi-block
as well as hierarchical structured AMR datasets. For more information, look
at the header files of these:

vtkMultiGroupDataSet
vtkMultiBlockDataSet
vtkHierarchicalDataSet
vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet
vtkXMLMultiGroupDataSetReader
vtkXMLMultiBlockDataSetReader

The format is simple. The vtm file is a meta-file that points to other XML
files. Here is a small example:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="vtkMultiBlockDataSet" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
<vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
<DataSet group="0" dataset="0" file="test/test_0.vts"/>
<DataSet group="1" dataset="0" file="test/test_1.vts"/>
<DataSet group="2" dataset="0" file="test/test_2.vts"/>
</vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
</VTKFile>

You can also have distributed multi-block datasets. Each group corresponds
to one block and can contain one or more datasets. These "sub blocks" are
the distributed data.

I got an error when I made the volume rendering.The error message is 

" # Error or warning: There was a VTK Warning in file: /home/myfile/paraview-2.0.1

 Sorry.  Unstructured grids with more than 500,000 cells cannot currently be ren

Why I got this error ? Who can tell me ?
Thank you .

Berk,
 
I use the following code to attach the arrays to the mesh.
 
if(first == 0) {
   output->GetCellData()->SetScalars(cell_data_array[j]);
} else {
   output->GetCellData()->AddArray(cell_data_array[j]);
}

where output is a vtkUnstructuredGrid, and cell_data_array is an array
of pointers to vtkFloatArrays.
 
I am not using a debugger, but I will run in valgrind and see what I
come up with.
 
Thanks for the help.

Hello,

I get a segmentation fault under Linux when trying to set display style to
"volume rendering" on EnSight Data.

Data is hexahedral (unstructured) mesh, with cell values; using "Tetrahedralize"
and "Cell Data to Point Data" do not help (the stack backtrace is
similar).

The test case is attached to this message, along with a gdb backtrace (for
ParaView as of last Nov 11'ths CVS compiled with default options on SUSE Linux
10.0).

The same bug occurs on the same machine with ParaView CVS (compiled from source)
and 2.4 (paraview.org binary), not on 2.2.1 (paraview.org binary). It also
occurs on another Linux machine running Debian (Sarge), so it does not seem to
be system dependent.

Thanks.

Yvan Fournier

Subject: [Paraview] Append datasets changed in release 2.4
Message-ID: <20051116163752.EF43272859@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hello Paraview developers,

I've been facing a problem in Paraview 2.4 that was absent in release 2.2. 

In the release 2.4 the "append datasets" filter is disabled for multiple
datasets read separately.

In Paraview 2.2 I was able to read several pieces of my model from different
Ensight's case files and after applying the "append datasets" and "clean to
grid" filters Paraview produced the image corresponding to the entire model
(without those MPI communication interface nodes). It was a wonderful
feature for me because I was able to visualize parallel data even running
Paraview in serial mode. Therefore, I need to ask the Paraview developers if
it's a bug of the Ensight's readers, after the recent changes, or this
feature will not be present in the future releases anymore.

Regards

Subject: [Paraview] parallel reader problem
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20051116163525.02a374d8@mail.ncsa.uiuc.edu>


Hello,

I have written a reader for paraview. The reader works ok in single process 
stand
alone mode ( ie running paraview ). It also works fine if I run in client 
server mode
with a single process as the server. It fails though when I try to run it 
in client server
mode with more than one server process. The failure mode is the client 
loses contact
with the server and  produces a stream of "Could not send tag" errors. I 
import my
reader into paraview by using the import package function in the file menu. 
The failure
occurs immediately after I import the package and before I try to read 
anything. I have
the required library and xml on both the client and server machines. The 
file menu
import package presents a file dialog that appears to point to the client 
machine.
How is the reader library loaded into the server side application? Is the 
method of
loading packages I am using even applicable to the parallel client/server 
mode?
This failure mode does not present itself when I run paraview in parallel 
on the console
of a cluster.

I have read the paraview wiki info on this topic. My next attempt will be 
to try to build
the module into paraview itself rather than importing it. I would like to 
know what is
going wrong though. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Dave

I have had troubles with this issue in the past with several parallel
custom readers and if memory serves me right, someone at Kitware even
told me it would not work.

Your next attempt (see below) should work much better. I have myself
done the switch (use PARAVIEW_LOAD_EXTERNAL_MODULE) for all my readers
and they work fine

My next attempt will be

Ken:

I come back to this problem again.  I am trying to set the DISPLAY in
the code at MPI_Init.  However, I am not sure this really does the work
as expected because Paraview has a very complicated architecture.
Precisely, I add a paragraph after the MPI_Init in
VTK/Parallel/vtkMPIController.cxx.  Please confirm me this is the right
place to add, or point me where is the right place if this is not.

I can verify that the data is processed by two process by adding a
"Process Id Scalar" filter.

However, how can I verify the render task is assigned to two graphic
cards.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Qinghuai

Message-ID: <FE9054CD-46B7-4DE7-AC2C-6BCB441A83B3@bluequartz.net>

I am running OS X version 10.4.3 and have followed the instructions  
on the wiki to try an compile paraview version 2.2.1 and the latest  
beta 2.4. Neither will compile and fail very quickly during the  
compile. Doing some digging it would seem that the Tcl/Tk build  
script is being copied with DOS line endings instead of Unix line  
endings which is going to mess things up. Has anyone seen anything  
like this before? I can not figure out if it is something with my  
install, my user directory, my .bash_profile or my OS X install in  
general?

Here is the build output.

238:[mjackson@Aeryn:~/Desktop/pbuild]$ make

If I look at the file build_tcltk.sh in bbedit it is indicating that

to UNIX I then get the following:

Message-ID: <52E96152-ED1B-450D-9D6B-220CCE18B648@bluequartz.net>

I would like to look at some data that has been given to me. The  
format is in ASCII and is a special format (gotta love researchers).  
We have written a parser to get it out of the file and into a  
vtkImageData object. The data represents voxels in a 256x256x256  
grid. The values are either 1 or 0.

Once I get the data exported into some vtk specific file I would like  
to load it up into paraview. I have tried several of the vtk*writer  
classes all with no luck trying to load the file into paraview. The  
most I get is an outline of the model ( a wireframe cube). Could  
anyone offer some ideas on what I might use to accomplish this?

Don't even suggest to write a paraview plugin. I am running OS X  
10.4.3 and I am lucky to just have paraview running, let alone build  
a module for it.

Can anyone tell me what's wrong?

I have found a similar problem on the mailing list:

In one of the answers it is said that in CMakeCache.txt 
VTK_HAVE_GETSOCKNAME_WITH_SOCKLEN_T:INTERNAL=0 should be changed to =1, 
but this is already the case on my system. And changing it back to =0 
does not help either.

Btw, that's what I did it (I hope there's no stupid mistake :-)

Hi Mike,

In ParaView, the default representation of a vtkImageData object is 
an outline cube.  If you've gotten this far, you have likely loaded 
your data correctly into ParaView.  To change to something other than 
the wireframe view, go to the Display tab, and change the value in 
the representation menu.  After you loaded your data (and got a 
wireframe cube), did you look at the Information tab to see if the 
meta-data for this vtkImageData object was correct (i.e., bounds, 
extents, spacing, range of values in data array)? Did you try running 
a filter on your data?

Christoph,

	Can you check you have the proper include file:
	
	/usr/include/sys/socket.h

	In case you don't have it, do `sudo apt-get install libc6-dev`.

	The only case in which this error could happen would be that you 
installed this package after a first configuration of ParaView. Please 
delete the CMakeCache.txt and redo a cmake configure step.

Thanks

Once the data was loaded, meta data did not indicate the correct  
values. The filter menu was NOT available so I could not do anything  
with the data. I tried all the different representations and nothing  
seemed to show anything except the outline of which the extents did  
not seem correct. My guess is that I am not writing out some header  
or something?

Additionally, when I try to open the file in paraview ("/tmp/ 
phasefield.vti") I get an error dialog stating "Could not find an  
appropriate reader for file "/tmp/phasefield.vti. Would you like to  
manually select the reader for this file?". I select OK and proceed  
to select the "VTKImageFiles Reader" from the list.
    Now in Paraview, I go to the "Information" tab and get:
Type: Volume (Uniform Rectilinear)
Number of Datasets: 1
Number of Cells: 0
Number of Points: 0
Memory: 0 MBytes
Empty Bounds
Empty Extent.

I believe I can forward the data (I'll have to check with my  
supervisior) if you want to try this yourself.

Following is the method that I am using to read the original data,  
then write the "vtk" data:
///Assume _size = 256
///Assume _voi.empty() returns TRUE
vtkImageData* PhaseFieldReader::_read( std::istream& in )

This include file is available; I have deleted the build directory and 
run cmake and make -- but nothing has changed, the error has not 
disappeared.

I've put several files that seem to be created by cmake online; maybe 
this gives you more information:

Message-ID: <D81A760A-7E97-41E8-A15D-A29E3EEE4CB2@chalkie.org.uk>

Hi all,
I am testing the speed advantage of volume rendering in parallel -  
MPI with paraview
on the Sun microsystems server at corona.csc.fi

with the settings i have tried so far on a small dataset 56x56x56
with the render server running as pvserver-mpi
and the client running on my local OSX machine
pvclient
versions both 2.2

i am using 8 processors,
but not seeing any speed enhancement in volume rendering
compared to running it on my local machine with a single processor.

in fact it is much slower on the server using 8 processors

there is plenty of bandwidth between the server and my local machine

can anyone give me any pointers about the critical things to get  
right to get this to work.

In the end i want to do this with very large datasets that take too  
long to volume render on my local single processor machine.

cheers

Dan

You got this error because the volume renderer in ParaView 2.0 was a bit
of a memory hog and had the potential of exhausting system memory with
unstructured grids of the size you are dealing with.
 
Since then other volume rendering algorithms that are less memory
intensive have been added to ParaView.  I believe they are in ParaView
2.2.  Try upgrading.

If it was me, I would probably put it in vtkPVMain::Initialize(int, int)
right under the call to MPI_Comm_rank, but whatever works.

ParaView should open a window on all graphics cards.  Is there a way you
can see the output of all pipes?  Also make sure that under "3D View
Options" the Composite option is on and the slider is all the way to the
left.

Message-ID: <20051121215817.38AE072869@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>

Hello all,

I've been facing a problem in Paraview 2.4 that was absent in release 2.2. 

In the release 2.4 the "append datasets" filter is disabled for multiple
datasets read separately.

In Paraview 2.2 I was able to read several pieces of my model from different
Ensight's case files and after applying the "append datasets" and "clean to
grid" filters Paraview produced the image corresponding to the entire model
(without those MPI communication interface nodes). It was a wonderful
feature for me because I was able to visualize parallel data even running
Paraview in serial mode. Therefore, I need to ask the Paraview developers if
it's a bug of the Ensight's readers, after the recent changes, or this
feature will not be present in the future releases anymore.

Regards

Renato N. Elias

Hello,

Is there a documentation about Graphic API ?
For example, I want use Paraview in my Windows interface to see a mesh

For that I need a list for call I can use in my interface to open a

Does this list exist ?
Is yes where I can find it ?

This is a missing feature. I will fix it as soon as I have time. It probably
won't make into 2.4 release. Make sure to bug me if it's not there in a

In both the 2.4 branch and the latest CVS, client/server is not
functioning properly between AIX and pretty much anybody else.

Start pvserver on AIX with MPI:

Listen on port: 11,111
Waiting for client...
Client connected.


Start a client on x86_64 and then "open data"
share/paraview-2.5/Data/ironProt.vtk
Apply a Tetrahedralize filter:


Connected to server

I have no such problems between two Linux machines, and it worked
properly under version 2.2 with AIX/Linux.

Any ideas?

Perhaps it is the dataset structure , maybe your data set can not be read in parallelism. So each processor read the same data and render it, then processors compare with each other when they composite the graphics rendered. 

There will be more time spent than running on your local machine with a single processor, because each processor does the same job and needs to compare with each other.

But I'm new to Paraview too. Has someone already tried those two softwares? 
What are the strength of each one ? Visit seems to have a more powerfule XY

Any experience will be welcome.

In your ParaView build tree, look in VTK/vtkConfigure.h.  Is 
VTK_HAVE_GETSOCKNAME_WITH_SOCKLEN_T defined?  (It should be since the 
CMake variable is set to 1.)  If it is not, then in your ParaView 
build tree type do a 'make rebuild_cache' followed by 'make'.

Does anyone know how to turn on log axes on the xy plotter used by  
the line probe? Thanks,

You can use the calculator to compute a log of a variable and then plot
that... :)
