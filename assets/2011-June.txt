Dear Sebastien,

hello, I re-install cmake from binary distribution, ccmake becomes to work!

And I tried the abusolute path instead of  the relative path, so the situation
progressed.(Makefile has generated)

But in make process, following error has occered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:
:
[ 52%] Built target ParaWebPlugin
[ 57%] Building CXX object ParaViewAdapter/CMakeFiles/PWServer.dir/main.cxx.o
/root/ParaViewWeb/ParaViewAdapter/main.cxx: In function int main(int, char**):
/root/ParaViewWeb/ParaViewAdapter/main.cxx:41: error PROCESS_CLIENT is not a
member of 'vtkProcessModule"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I checked ParaViewWeb/ParaViewAdapter/main.cxx and ParaView-3.10.1/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.h.
Certainly main.cxx refers "PROCESS_CLIENT" but this symbol is not defined in vtkProcessModule.h and other all files...

How can I resolve this problem?

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Subject: [Paraview] Picking values in the Object Inspector like the cut and
	contour filter
Message-ID: <BANLkTikAtzuQj_fG0jXQGXpK=ffRchLQNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have created a filter where I would like to let the user pick values in a
similar way to the contour and slice filter.

Here is an extract from my XML file:

  <DoubleVectorProperty
        name="MyValues"
        command="SetMyValue"
        label="My Values"
        set_number_command="SetNumberOfMyValues"
        number_of_elements="0"
        repeat_command="1"
        number_of_elements_per_command="1"
        use_index="1"
        animateable="1">
          <DoubleRangeDomain name="scalar_range" min="0.0" max="1.0" />
     </DoubleVectorProperty>

How can I use the widget from the cut or slice value to let the user choose
the values in the Object Inspector?  Is this possible through the XML?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Paul,

Both cut (pqCutPanel) and contour (pqContourPanel) panels are custom
panels. We haven;t added support for the autogenerated panels to add
the "values" widget (pqSampleScalarWidget) yet. You'll have to create
a custom panel for it.

Subject: [Paraview] Changing the texture of a pqDataRepresentation
Message-ID: <BANLkTimGxk8ybXBz3jz-bMsTVkW6mA=S-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I was trying (and failing) to change the image texture of
a pqDataRepresentation in a plugin and I was wondering
if anyone could lend a hand.

This is the code I have:


//this->Representation is a pqDataRepresentation*
pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(this->Representation->getProxy()->GetProperty("Texture"),
"C:/Users/Green/Desktop/tmp/2_cc/anatomy/2ch.geo.png");
this->Representation->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();


Changing the texture via the GUI with the texture combobox works fine and
the path to the texture is accurate.
I am doing this when I get a dataUpdated() signal from
the pqDataRepresentation (after having read a file from disk
and creating the data that gets represented), is it perhaps needed to wait
until a specific update signal to do this?

Thanks.

The texture property does not take a filename, it's a proxy-property
that needs a source that produces an image-data that can be used as
the texture. Look at code in
ParaView/Qt/Components/pqTextureComboBox.cxx to see how this is done
especially pqTextureComboBox::loadTexture(const QString& filename).

Hi all,
I'm trying to load a vtk file in Paraview using a simple python script. 
My script is:

from paraview.simple import *
obj = 
OpenDataFile("/home/luca/3dVoxView/Volumes_Storage/geostat_interp/Vol.vtk")
obj.Representation = 'Volume'
servermanager.SaveState("/home/luca/3dVoxView/Volumes_Storage/geostat_interp/prova.pvsm")

but when I run my script this error appears:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "paraviewProj.py", line 3, in <module>
     obj.Representation = 'Volume'
   File 
"/home/luca/3dVoxView/PARAVIEWWEB/build-paraview/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 207, in __setattr__
     "to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute Representation does not exist.  This class 
does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to 
typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.

what does it mean? what's wrong in obj.Representation='Volume' ? Thank 
you for any suggestion...

Luca

You have to do something like:

obj = OpenDataFile("/home/luca/3dVoxView/Volumes_Storage/geostat_interp/Vol.vtk")
repr = Show()
repr.Representation = 'Volume'
....

But you also need to setup lookup table and scalar opacity function
for volume rendering.  I'd recommend using the Python-Trace
functionality in ParaView. Load the data and change representation
type to volume and then look at the python trace generated. It will
show you to setup the lookup tables among other things.

1. If it's cell centered data, apply the CellDataToPointData filter. If it's point data, skip this step
2. Apply the ComputeDerivatives filter. Choose your velocity vector as the Vectors argument, set the Output Vector Type to Vorticity. I usually also set Output Tensor Type to nothing unless you need it.
3. Hit apply.

Ok thanks - I've created a custom panel just like pqCutPanel but now my
filter only updates when something earlier in the pipeline is updated.

e.g. for this pipeline: Source -> MyFilter
Changing "MyFilter" properties will allow me to apply but nothing happens.
 But if I change a property in "Source" it will update to show the changes I
have made to "MyFilter" properties too.

Can anyone think why this is happening?  Or know a way I can debug this....

Thanks,
Paul

I would use a python programmable source to read the file and produce the
appropriate value (s) when it is asked by the pipeline.

See

Did you forget to call Modified() in the vtk-filter when the values
were modified?

Hi Luca,

I did not tested ParaViewWeb on Solaris, but if Paraview is working on
your solaris, I think you will have a good chance that everything
should work just fine. Just use use gcc instead of the Sun compiler.

Yes that was it.  I was using the vtkContourValues in a similar way to the
vtkCutter and vtkContourFilter and hadn't noticed the overridden GetMTime
method...

Subject: [Paraview] Lines, Splines and Tubes
Message-ID: <4DE675CC.2050505@us.army.mil>

I have a vtkUnstructuredGrid with a bunch of points and lines. For each 
of the lines I want to overlay a tube and change it so it arcs like a 
rainbow. What is the best way to go about doing this?

Right now it looks like I need to use splines and tubes, however it 
seems difficult to create a spline between two points. I have the two 
point ids in vtkIdType or the cell id of the line in vtkIdType. It looks 
like it requires a vtkPoints*. I'm not sure how to get a subset from my 
unstructured grid's points in that form.

Any ideas or example code would be great.

Thanks,
Brian Panneotn

Subject: [Paraview] Concept: A world without the Apply button
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=qLFxQ86=HhXR_Cv_f4K9xVw1qNw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I have been investigating the ability to create pipelines in ParaView
without having to hit Apply at every single stage in the pipeline.
This would make it much easier to deal with really large data in a
usage scenario where the scientist is fairly familiar with the
visualization pipeline he's interested in setting up.

Following the recent changes to the ParaView ServerManager, the
ServerManager level requirement that filters need to be updated before
connecting has disappeared. However, we still need to "Apply" to get
updated information about arrays etc.

After a couple on discussions with Berk and Dave, I've consolidated
the thoughts on a Wiki page. If any one has any thoughts to share, it
would be great.

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/No-Apply_Mechanism_for_Creating_Pipelines

Note that this is merely a concept. We have no plans of implementing
it in near future (3.12/4.0).

Hi Utkarsh,

I like the idea. One possible problem that comes to mind is filters  
that produce different output types based on the input. Will enough of  
the metadata be passed through the pipeline before Execute() is called  
for those filters to hint at their output type? Otherwise, you'll be  
forced to hit Execute before adding any more filters.

Or, for that matter, what about filters which are disabled in the menu  
when there is no scalar/vector/tensor data on their input?

Dave,

Output types become a problem only for composite-datasets, for others
data-types are known after RequestDataObject pass which happens before
RequestData(). I am still not sure how (or if) to deal with composite
datasets in this case. We can expect the reader to give meta-data for
composite datasets and leaves in  the dataset in more details as well,
but I am not sure we need to yet.

As far as the scalars/vectors/tensors go, no filter in paraview
requires active-scalars/tensors etc, it just checks for existence of
array with a give number of components. The meta-data should indeed
contain information about arrays and number of components.

Utkarsh,

I agree that composite readers (and probably other composite filters)  
can provide the dataset structure in the RequestDataObject pass, but I  
don't know that many currently do. Certainly the ExodusIIReader  
doesn't. It would be easy enough to provide an empty hierarchy of *all  
the available* blocks the file(s) contain, but doing that with all of  
the block/set selections plus populating empty arrays on each leaf  
(which I think would be useful) would be a lot of work.

Is it possible from within a reader plugin to read in an image and map 
it to a plane? It seems that I must use a texture and an actor in order 
to do this.

Thanks,

Please keep the discussion on the list so that everyone can contribute to
and benefit from the answers.

I am not sure what you mean by create a container.

I do not think you can do what you want purely via using GUI (hopefully
someone out there will correct me) so unfortunately you will have to write
some code. The easiest way to do that is via the python programmable filter,
which lets you write code at run time and obviates the need for compilation.

The first example demonstrates how one might go about writing a "reader" to
get some arbitrary data (your text file with time in column 1 and the time
dependent Numeric Value in column two) into ParaView.

The second example demonstrates what a you have to do to make your reader
understand ParaView's concept of time. The reader has to announce what time
range it has data for and then must respond to any given time request that
the pipeline gives it. (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Time_Support).  In your
case the reader would produce the particular entry from column two whenevery
ParaView asks it for the corresponding time in column 1.

Unfortunately there is one more hurdle, which you pointed out and reminded
me of in you second email. That is, how do you get the value to show up on
the screen in text format?

ParaView's textual annotation support is weak in my opinion, and we plan to
improve upon that in future releases. Until them you have to three options:
1) use a plot filter to show the value in its own view window
2) have your reader produce a vtkPolyData with a single VTK_VOXEL cell at
some arbitrary location, then use selection to select the voxel. Then use
selection annotation in the selection inspector panel to show the value as
text
3) derive a new class from or modify the annotate time filter to show your
value of interest instead of the time on the screen

Of the three I think #2 is quickest but #3 is best, but both require even
more coding (3 involves C++ coding).

Actually I take some of that back. You can do it via the gui with the
following hack.

Use Sources -> "Time Source" with default properties and save it to create a
template file. Ascii pvd format or xdmf should work. Edit the cell values in
the vtu files to contain what you have in column 2 and the pvd time entries
to contain what you have in column 2.

Since we don't have arbitrary text display yet, use surface selection to
pick the cell. Turn on annotation at the bottom of the selection inspector
and choose the array that has your values.

This is still a big hack, but it doesn't involve coding per se, just file
formatting.

Dear Sebastien,

hello, thanks to your support, I could fix the make-process issue.
But in the next phase, I met a trouble again...
By the manual, I have to "ccmake ../pw" but there are no "pw" directory,
so I searched a suitable directory by "grep CORE_SERVICE_URL", but
there are no files that contain "CORE_SERVICE_URL". So I missed the "pw"
directory.
What directory shoud I indicate as the "pw" directory?

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Subject: [Paraview] accessing vtkFieldData from calculator filter
Message-ID: <BANLkTikLOVE-4D9MRuh_7hRFQUQbfJRvvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm adding meta data to my vtkPolyData via vtkFieldData per
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/PolyData/FieldData. I see
this metadata fine from the ParaView GUI but can't seem to do anything
with the information without manually copying and pasting.
Specifically I'd like to use some of the field values in a calculation
via e.g. the calculator filter. Any way to do something like this?

Cheers,
Christine

in fact the pw directory is the source directory of ParaViewWeb.
Moreover, the documentation explain how to compile each component
independently from each other, but if you simply turn ON all the
options, you will get everything at once.

Christine,

Currently calculator cannot handle field-data
(http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=5626). You can possibly write a
Python Programmable filter that uses the field data.

Hi All,

I'm trying to compile 3.10.1, from source on windows with visual studio
2010, and qt 4.7.3, I know that is not supported.  It looks almost
finished except the following error:

4>ClCompile:
4>  pqViewManager.cxx
4>..\..\..\ParaView-3.10.1\Qt\Components\pqViewManager.cxx(981): error
C3861: '_getpid': identifier not found

4>Build FAILED.

Any thoughts??

Cheers,

Hi David,

Thank you for your help. It works! Actually, the solution required that I
upgrade from ver. 3.6 to 3.10.

Actually I take some of that back. You can do it via the gui with the
following hack.

Use Sources -> "Time Source" with default properties and save it to create a
template file. Ascii pvd format or xdmf should work. Edit the cell values in
the vtu files to contain what you have in column 2 and the pvd time entries
to contain what you have in column 2.

Since we don't have arbitrary text display yet, use surface selection to
pick the cell. Turn on annotation at the bottom of the selection inspector
and choose the array that has your values.

This is still a big hack, but it doesn't involve coding per se, just file
formatting.

Works correctly but what must I do to:
1 make a vector or contour plot
2 tracer plot or vorticity lines (like streamlines) plot?
The choice for these is only the velocity field that I read.
Calculator does not see the vorticity vector that was created.
Thanks for you help,

The output from the ComputeDerivatives is Cell Data. To do those things, you want to make it Point Data with another CellDataToPointData filter.

The calculator would see it if you changed it from point data to cell data. But since you want to do other stuff with it, add the interpolation filter again and then it will appear with the rest of your point data.

Works correctly but what must I do to:
1 make a vector or contour plot
2 tracer plot or vorticity lines (like streamlines) plot?
The choice for these is only the velocity field that I read.
Calculator does not see the vorticity vector that was created.
Thanks for you help,

For computing vorticity, depending on the grid type you can also use the
Gradient of Unstructured Datasets filter.  There is an option to compute
vorticity for 3 component arrays (i.e. velocity).    It works on both point
data and cell data and the output will be the same type of field data.  I'm
about to change this filter so that it will work with all types of VTK
grids.

On this subject, it should also be possible to use the Python Calculator to
perform this function. Create a vector, U and obtain the curl of it by
using: curl(U). I think your version of Python must have numpy available,
though.

This is outside of what I usually do, so I may not be much help. But once you have the vorticity at all verticies, that should include the verticies on the cylinder surface. 

How do you extract the surface? Is it a body fitted grid or an embedded boundary/levelset to mark it? I would assume if you extract the surface in the pipeline downstream of the derivatives and interpolation filters, all of the variables would be available on the surface. 

Unless of course the surface is looking for cell data and not point data, in which case you would skip the second interpolation filter.

The geometry is a body fitted 3D cylinder unstructured mesh.
I have an id array for each vertex. The id at interior points is zero. 
Each boundary vertex has a non-zero value.
I set the id on the cylinder surface vertices  = -3
The extract the boundary like this.
1-extract surface
2-connectivity
3-threshold with id for the cylinder.

I see the cylinder surface and display shows the variables available 
(vorticity is there).
I can see the surface vorticity contours and clearly see where flow 
separation occurs. I would like to see surface streaklines of the vorticity.
When I click on "surface flow" PV crashes. Maybe I need to transform the 
vorticity vector to r,theta,z coordinates before doing "surface flow."
What do you think?

You may want to start by writing and getting your mapper working in
VTK itself. Refer to
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGridVolumeMapper.html
you may want to look at the subclasses and see how those implement the
superclasses API. YOu basicall need to override Render(..). Look at
the subclasses to see how that's done.

Message-ID: <415D6BA5A1B02D40AACCA9B9919D6D9F4EFB96F7@CORTINA.HPTI.COM>

Hi,

I'm trying to read in a restarted CTH Data set using vtkSpyPlotReader with vtkFileSeriesReader. But I cannot figure out how to transfer the information from the meta file (*.spcth-timeseries) to the spyplot reader.

a section of my code:

vtkFileSeriesReader* restartReader=vtkFileSeriesReader::New();
vtkSpyPlotReader* cthReader=vtkSpyPlotReader::New();
vtkDummyController* controller=vtkDummyController::New();
cthReader->SetGlobalController(controller);

restartReader->UseMetaFileOn();
restartReader->SetMetaFileName(filename.c_str());

restartReader->SetReader(cthReader);

But the spyplot reader doesn't have the information it needs; so it will not let me update the pipeline.

Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.

Hi,

The SpyPlotReader already handle file series. The file extension just need
to be a numeric value ie, spcth-a.0,spcth-a.1,spcth-a.2 while the name of
the file start with spct.

Hi Robert,

Thank you for the response. I can read in individual files. But I have a sample data set which has a text file named sample.spct-timeseries. When I give that file to SpyPlotReader, it doesn't recognize and when I ran Paraview through the debugger while opening that file it instantiated a vtkFileSeriesReader. This is now the source of my confustion.

Thank you,
Andrey Andreyev

Subject: [Paraview] trashed screen
Message-ID: <4DE960A4.1050008@lbl.gov>

Hi

On Longhorn (GPU rendering) visualizing a 2d dataset that has a large 
ratio (w/h) I am seeing that about 5-20% of the width of the view (slice 
or surface representation) is cut off on the right side. This cut off 
area still takes on the background color until the window is resized at 
which point the area becomes trashed (attached screen shot). This is 
reproducable on Longhorn.

Has anyone seen this, or any ideas about why it happens? I used PV 3.8.0 
on this system before without issues so I assume it's due to some 
interaction introduced since then?

I filed a bug so I could upload the screenshot.

Message-ID: <BANLkTinqFbPzH02ASLOCMwL5Zd4pVxVXfg@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to plot/visualize curved triangles in paraview?
This seems essential when using higher order finite elements.
Thanks!

If you had used vtk's quadratic cells you could use the tessellate 
filter to show their curvature.

Just to share my finding, ParaViewGeo has a Shapefile reader plugin.
http://paraviewgeo.mirarco.org/index.php/Main_Page

Several warnings are issued when I tried to compile the plugin in
conjunction with the latest git master of PV. Besides I don't know if
it is supposed to be a complete implementation, but as far as I tested
importing geometry worked.

It should be noted that the implementation in ParaViewGeo is LGPL not BSD.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkPVPostFilter bug question
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990E42F1@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

Recently (3.10 onwards I think) a new filter was added to paraview which does some 'conversion' of inputs so that they can operate with filters that they would otherwise not do so.

I am finding that some filters of mine which produce vtkStructuredGrid output, produce no visible output inn paraview and after some painful debugging have tracked it down to vtkPVPostFilter, specifically

When vtkPVPostFilter is passind datasets directly from input to output without taking any action, it does a simple
        output->ShallowCopy(input);
I had to add
        output->CopyInformation(input);
in order for my datasets to become visible in the PV GUI.

I believe that this is a bug in pvPostFilter, and I suspect it is new because the executive used to do a lot of the information copying without filters needing to do it.

The odd thing is that some vtkStructuredGrid sources were still working without the extra information copy and so I'm not 100% sure it's a bug (or some deficiency in the datasets).

Can one of the kitware chaps comment on why I might have trouble with some filters, but not with others. The key part seems to be that the Extent information needs to be set in the information as well as the dataset and when doing a copyStructure, it isn't passed through.

JB

Hi all,
when I load a pvsm file into Paraview... an Outoput message window 
appears and always says:

/build/buildd/paraview-3.8.1/VTK/Graphics/vtkQuadricClustering.cxx, line 
1153

vtkQuadricClustering (0xa668530): You cannot use less than one division.


how can I solve it? I don't know what kind of error is, because when I 
close the error window, the project is loaded with no problems. Thank you!

Hi Lester,

I have a Shapefile reader (actually a vector format reader) for VTK.
You would have to write a program to use it (I can send a sample app
too). It will require VTK and GDAL.

I can send you the code in my next email if you are interested.

Regards,

Actually, running the tessellate filter should be unnecessary.  The 3D view will automatically tessellate the quadric cells with up to 4 subdivisions.  Go to the Display panel and adjust the "Subdivision" parameter under "Style".

I've never used the file series reader outside of ParaView proxies, but I'm guessing you need to set the FileNameMethod ivar.

restartedReader->SetFileNameMethod("SetFileName");

might do the trick.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Using vtkFileSeriesReader with vtkSpyPlotReader

Hi Robert,

Thank you for the response. I can read in individual files. But I have a sample data set which has a text file named sample.spct-timeseries. When I give that file to SpyPlotReader, it doesn't recognize and when I ran Paraview through the debugger while opening that file it instantiated a vtkFileSeriesReader. This is now the source of my confustion.

Thank you,
Andrey Andreyev

Hi,

The SpyPlotReader already handle file series. The file extension just need to be a numeric value ie, spcth-a.0,spcth-a.1,spcth-a.2 while the name of the file start with spct.

Hi,

I'm trying to read in a restarted CTH Data set using vtkSpyPlotReader with vtkFileSeriesReader. But I cannot figure out how to transfer the information from the meta file (*.spcth-timeseries) to the spyplot reader.

a section of my code:

vtkFileSeriesReader* restartReader=vtkFileSeriesReader::New();
vtkSpyPlotReader* cthReader=vtkSpyPlotReader::New();
vtkDummyController* controller=vtkDummyController::New();
cthReader->SetGlobalController(controller);

restartReader->UseMetaFileOn();
restartReader->SetMetaFileName(filename.c_str());

restartReader->SetReader(cthReader);

But the spyplot reader doesn't have the information it needs; so it will not let me update the pipeline.

Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Surface LIC memory usage
Message-ID: <4DED7EB3.3030000@lbl.gov>

Hi,

I am seeing some pretty astounding memory usage when using the LIC. My 
dataset is 100MB image 2D image data. When I load it and display using a 
slice rep. I use about 800MB of RAM, but when I turn on LIC rep. memory 
usage goes up to 18GB!! What's worse is that as I advance through the 
time series with each new step the memory usage grows by 4GB or more, 
until I run out of RAM. I put the output from one run below, memory 
usage is reported in KB.

Does anyone know why LIC rep. requires such a massive amount of RAM? I 
didn't see any outright large leaks, so it must be part of this rep. 
design? And can anything be done to prevent the growth in its usage over 
time?

hi Guys,

Just intalled paraview 3.10.1 and noticed the long-waited Iso Volume is
added. Is there any difference between this filter and clip by scalar? I
used to use clip and I'm just curious if there is any difference.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] GetPolyData on a BoxWidget
Message-ID: <4DEE1ABF.7010102@uclouvain.be>

Dear Users,

I usually clip meshes using the clip filter and a box, or a plane. I 
would be interested in exporting the clipping box data, not the 
clippedData, but the box itself. I also would like to get the thickness 
of the box, eg. distance between two handles.
I know that VTK allows to do that (using the method GetPolyData), and 
that it doesn't work properly (you have to triangulate the data first). 
There is no option in paraview to retrieve the box.

My solution is to create a filter that do the same job as the clipper 
with the additional ability to export the data and compute the distance. 
But I'm not sure to be able to handle a widget inside my plugin.
Since I've never wrote a plugin for paraview, I prefer ask before!

So, is it possible?
Is there another (simpler) way around? Add a check box to the 
"properties" of the clipper to GetPolyData ?
Thx,
Laurent.

I doubt it's part of the design so to speak :). My suspicion is some

I'll try to track it down.

What I'd do is subclass vtkPVClipDataset (the filter paraview uses for
Clip). Make the subclass a two output-port filter (by calling
vtkAlgorithm::SetNumberOfOutputPorts(2)) and producing the polydata
matching the implicit function specified as the clipping function on
the second output port. Now you can save/visualization both the
clipped dataset as well as the clipping box. Are you familiar with
writing vtkAlgorithm subclasses?

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for your reply!
I'm used to subclass ITK and VTK classes, but I install Paraview using 
the binaries.... not yet from the sources.
If I understand you, this could be very easily done subclassing the 
PVClipDataSet. What about displaying or saving the second output?
How can I get both output ports?
Thanks again,
Laurent.

Once you make the VTK filter have two output ports, paraview will
automatically detect it and you will be able to see both output ports
in the pipeline browser.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkPVPostFilter bug question
In-Reply-To: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990E42F1@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

I suspect that something is wrong on your side. My reasoning:

- vtkPVPostFilter already copies all of the meta-data (whole extent and
extent translator) needed in the RequestInformation pass

- There should be no need to copy this meta-data in RequestData pass, which
is what CopyInformation() would do

- Everything else in ParaView seem to work fine with structured grids

Can you verify why the geometry filter is not displaying the data? Is
it because it
is missing whole extent? If that is the case, can one of your filters
be removing or
corrupting whole extent in RequestInformation? Or are you changing whole extent
in RequestData but not reporting it in RequestInformation?

I don't see the patch, I can take a look at the patch if you upload
it. Now the vtkLegend object is exposed it should be relatively
simple.

I'm currently building paraview from sources...
I had errors caused by Qt.
"fatal error LNK1112: module machine type 'X86' conflicts with target 
machine type 'x64'" in QtGUI4.dll and in QtCore4.dll
My computer runs Windows 7 64 bits. I have downloaded and installed (not 
built) Qt4.7.3 Vs2008.
My compiler is VS2010 64 bits edition.
Do you think it is a building error from Qt or from the compiler version?

I have created a subclass of vtkPVClipDataSet as you adviced me.
If I am right, Data clipping using a box is performed by moving a 
BoxWidget, getting the vtkPlanes and providing them to vtkPVClipDataSet 
as implicitFunction. Can you confirm me?
If yes, it is not exactly what I was looking for since I need to access 
to the box widget to retrieve the polydata. In vtkPVClipDataSet i on ly 
have acces to the implicit function, thus the vtkPlanes.
I guess that I need to access to the point in the code where we get the 
BoxWidget just before passing the vtkPlanes to the clipper.
Can you show me where it is (sorry, it is the first time i open the 
paraview source code, I need help!) ?

Laurent.

You are using 64-bit Qt while building a 32-bit binary. Make sure you
re-configure ParaView (using cmake) and pick 64bit compiler.

When clipping with box, you'd get a  vtkPVBox as the implicit
function. You can get the box dimensions from it and the construct
your own polydata or use vtkCubeSource in combination with
vtkTransformFilter to get the oriented bounding box. You cannot get
access to the vtkBoxWidget in a filter.

Nope (it indeed internally uses clip-by scalar for point scalars)
except that it applies two clip-by-scalars and can also handle cell
data (by internally using threshold filter)

One thing that strikes me about this proposal, is that it relies a lot on
VTK readers/filters providing the necessary meta data, particularly about
fields.  For example, the elevation filter would have to report in its
meta data that it will be adding a scalar field named Elevation.  That
sounds easy enough to implement, but would have to be independently added
for all readers/filters.  This would be especially problematic for
user-provided plugins.

Is there a way to mitigate the issues with the meta data mismatching what
is actually generated?  Perhaps there could be a check to make sure that
the data generated matches the meta data previously reported and issue a
warning if there are any mismatches.  This would not solve the problem per
se, but would quickly alert developers to problems and make it easier to
debug.

All--

Technical reasons aside, my own simulation efforts (software that relies 
on ParaView for post-processing) span a great variety of solid and 
structural mechanics applications. The software is not a 
single-formulation, single-solution, one-off problem solver.

Put briefly, I find the "Apply" button exceptionally useful.

The EnSight-formatted results files produced contain a surfeit (excess) 
of simulation results for any one application. I use the "Apply" button 
on loading results files for several purposes:

1) Load only results that are most useful to the current problem or 
application.

2) Limit the results I examine to those relevant to the phase st hand:
      i) Phase 1. Are the results OK (BC's OK? Energy Balance OK? 
Loading OK?)
     ii) Phase 2. Which result describes the response most effectively?
    iii) Phase 3. Presentation animations and figures for communicating.

3) Frequent tuning of various filters to refine the display of the 
results being studied.

4) Last but not least, limit the results being examined at any one 
session to avoid the MS O/S crashing PV because of the MS O/S limits on 
resources usable.

Thanks for the opportunity to express my support for ParaView and its 
exceptional versatility and effectiveness as a post-processing tool.

Sam,

Please note that this proposal does not preclude the user from
choosing which array to load from the reader's properties panel. That
indeed will be supported. This proposal in fact allows you go back the
reader change it's array selection, and then go the properties panel
for a contour filter connected downstream (for example) and choose the
array to contour by as the newly selected array without having to
execute any of the reader/intermediate filters until you have setup
the full pipeline. After which, you hit "Execute". That's when the
reader will actually read the data. Currently, before you can choose
the array to contour with, you have to hit "Apply" so that the reader
will produce the newly selected array. Then alone will it be reflected
on the contour panel.

Also, changing parameters on filters will have no immediate effect per
say. The new proposal is not simply "auto-apply". You have to hit
"Execute" before the filters will be executed, so you can tweak
parameters to your hearts contents before triggering any execution
(similar to the Apply mechanism).

That sounds like a good idea. Won't be too hard to implement either.

The bit level was not specified, and I had no choice for the compiler...
I tried compiling using the 32 bit version of my compiler and it worked.

Regarding the clipping, I can't find the vtkPVBox in the paraview sources.
Are you sure that it is the class used for clipping DataSet using a box?
I used to clip PolyData with vtkPlanes as implicitFunction, retrieved 
from the vtkBoxWidget.

Laurent.

You are using 64-bit Qt while building a 32-bit binary. Make sure you
re-configure ParaView (using cmake) and pick 64bit compiler.

When clipping with box, you'd get a  vtkPVBox as the implicit
function. You can get the box dimensions from it and the construct
your own polydata or use vtkCubeSource in combination with
vtkTransformFilter to get the oriented bounding box. You cannot get
access to the vtkBoxWidget in a filter.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.10.0 mpi question
Message-ID: <4DEF420C.9060108@inria.fr>

My mpi ParaView had been working correctly in the client/server mode.

Since I last ran the mpi mode there have been several ParaView upgrades 
so I don't know the last version of PV in which it worked correctly. The 
current installed PV version on the cluster is  PV 3.10.0.

There are three types of files:
paraview_results.pvd
 .pvtu and .vtu

In the past,
1- I submitted paraview un the cluster in a batch mode, noted the 
listening core then
2- Started PV on my station and
3- opened the results.pvd file.
Worked correctly

Now, when I try to open results.pvd on my workstation I get this error

vtkPVDReader (0x36700b0): Could not read file information

ERROR: In 
/home/kitware/Kitware/ParaView-3.10/source/VTK/Filtering/vtkExecutive.cxx,

Modified Time: 106864

Reference Count: 1

Registered Events: (none)

Can someone tell if the following file is correct (or has it been modified in recent versions of PV?). If I open the .pvtu files themselves they work correctly

cat paraview_results.pvd
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" byte_order="LittleEndian">
    <DataSet timestep="1.4083" part="001" file="solf.015001.pvtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.4229" part="001" file="solf.015500.pvtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Hoping someone can help me resolve the problem.

In visual studio you can do that by opening up a 32 bit or 64 bit

Hi Utkarsh,

If we want to push the demand-driven logic to the end, choosing the arrays 
to load could be implicit on the readers : they will depend on the arrays 
needed down the pipeline.
The obvious drawback of this approach is that having several arrays 
availbale for the representation to color by is very handy, instead of 
re-executing the whole pipeline each time you change the array to color 
by, but this demand-driven logic could help when memory is limited.

Best,
Stephane

Re: [Paraview] Concept: A world without the Apply button






Sam,

Please note that this proposal does not preclude the user from
choosing which array to load from the reader's properties panel. That
indeed will be supported. This proposal in fact allows you go back the
reader change it's array selection, and then go the properties panel
for a contour filter connected downstream (for example) and choose the
array to contour by as the newly selected array without having to
execute any of the reader/intermediate filters until you have setup
the full pipeline. After which, you hit "Execute". That's when the
reader will actually read the data. Currently, before you can choose
the array to contour with, you have to hit "Apply" so that the reader
will produce the newly selected array. Then alone will it be reflected
on the contour panel.

Also, changing parameters on filters will have no immediate effect per
say. The new proposal is not simply "auto-apply". You have to hit
"Execute" before the filters will be executed, so you can tweak
parameters to your hearts contents before triggering any execution
(similar to the Apply mechanism).

Oh, you're using 3.10, aren't you? vtkPVBox got added in git-master
recently.  In case of  3.10, it will be a vtkBox. We subclassed it
recently to provide an API to set position,scale, orientation
separately. In 3.10's case, you can use vtkBox::GetTransform() to
obtain the transformation matrix and apply that to a unit cube with
bounds (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1).

Stephane,

Yes, that'd indeed be a path forward, but like you alluded to, it would need
a planning of its own especially adding support to the executive, being
smart about when to re-execute, and even possibly, cache arrays.

Sorry I was I was talking about building Qt because I know the
download page is limited.. To build Qt you open up a command for your
compiler (Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64 Command prompt ...) and execute
configure in the source folder.

I now use the following options on vs2008

configure -debug-and-release -no-webkit -opensource -fast
-no-incredibuild-xge -mp -no-dbus -platform win32-msvc2008

then after the configure stage

nmake

will build Qt

Ouch...

I have configured the project but without any option and it has worked.
Running nmake fails because cl tries to use a temp directory that 
contains '&'...
Do you know how to make that temp directory pointing elsewhere?

TEMP is an environment variable in the command prompt you are running
in. You should be able to use the set command to change the value of
temp. And maybe TMP

Subject: [Paraview] Python + ParaView
Message-ID: <BANLkTin8bZDRGJqZfd35W7G39GdMBTEcmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm just taking first steps with ParaView's Python interface and
figured out so far that

================ *snip* ================
exodusReader = ExodusIIReader( FileName="solution.e" )
Show( exodusReader )
Render()
================ *snap* ================

would plot the mesh that is stored in the ExodusII file solution.e,
and that can play around with GetActiveView() to adjust camera angles
and such.

What I haven't found out though is how to plot actual point data. I get


>>> exodusReader.PointData[:]
[Array: GlobalNodeId, Array: PedigreeNodeId, Array: A, Array: psi,
Array: thickness]

and l'm looking at the 2-component array "psi". For example, I'd like
to do something like

    res =  sqrt( component1**2 + component2**2 )

and have res[:] rendered on the mesh with a certain color map.

Any hints?

Cheers,
Nico

[Stephane and I have been considering a proposal to add some degree of caching into the pipeline which would handle exactly the kind of situation where certain arrays could be passed through without the need for portions of the pipeline to reexecute.] (I'd like to see RequestData broken into smaller RequestScalar/RequestMesh type requests too, by the way)

However, your description of changes (which I basically approve of, subject to solving the issue of filters changing type based on input type the Dave pointed out) hints at a more contract based approach to updating the pipeline and if we're going to go down this path, I think we need to completely reconsider how extents are handled. Piece updates and extent based updates are (in my opinion) a bit shoddy and temperamental and the RequestUpdataExtent doesn't well (or at all) handle geometric extents (as opposed to structured extents or pieces). Also, the streaming improvements that Dave has been adding look marvellous, but appear to be somewhat orthogonal to the rest of the update mechanism and I'd it be nice to see these changes as part of a broader look at improving the handling of load balancing and extent handling within the entire executive framework -a more unified way.

I think I got a bit off topic there. Sorry

Stephane,

Yes, that'd indeed be a path forward, but like you alluded to, it would need a planning of its own especially adding support to the executive, being smart about when to re-execute, and even possibly, cache arrays.

Hi Utkarsh,

If we want to push the demand-driven logic to the end, choosing the arrays to load could be implicit on the readers : they will depend on the arrays needed down the pipeline.
The obvious drawback of this approach is that having several arrays availbale for the representation to color by is very handy, instead of re-executing the whole pipeline each time you change the array to color by, but this demand-driven logic could help when memory is limited.

Best,
Stephane

Re: [Paraview] Concept: A world without the Apply button







Sam,

Please note that this proposal does not preclude the user from
choosing which array to load from the reader's properties panel. That
indeed will be supported. This proposal in fact allows you go back the
reader change it's array selection, and then go the properties panel
for a contour filter connected downstream (for example) and choose the
array to contour by as the newly selected array without having to
execute any of the reader/intermediate filters until you have setup
the full pipeline. After which, you hit "Execute". That's when the
reader will actually read the data. Currently, before you can choose
the array to contour with, you have to hit "Apply" so that the reader
will produce the newly selected array. Then alone will it be reflected
on the contour panel.

Also, changing parameters on filters will have no immediate effect per
say. The new proposal is not simply "auto-apply". You have to hit
"Execute" before the filters will be executed, so you can tweak
parameters to your hearts contents before triggering any execution
(similar to the Apply mechanism).

The following wiki page talks about how to color using arrays:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Representations_and_Views

The easiest way to figure out Python code equivalents is to use the
Trace functionality to generate python trace files for actions
performed in the GUI (accessible from Tools menu). You "Start Trace",
do a set of actions and then "Stop Trace" and you should be able to
view the resulting Python code.

Hi Takuya,

Instead of sending it over the email I decided to put it over
gitorious so that it could be maintained.

Checkout source code from here:

https://gitorious.org/vtkgis_vector_reader

The repository has a test program as well that could be used to view a
shape file or write shape file gdal layers as vtk files. This test
program won't work when you don't have a projection information in the
shape file but you can still look at the test code to get an idea on
how to convert the data into vtk files.

If you have any questions or if you find any bugs please let me know.

Thanks

Thanks for the hints.

The Trace function in indeed quite useful in that it get you where you
want to be. When looking at the code there's still a lot of me to
understand though, the GetLookupTableForArray() call seems to be
crucial for example.

 * The VectorMode='Magnitude' parameter seems to be responsible for
merging the two components into one scalar, but I'm not quite sure how
this is done: with a sqrt() or without? Is is possible to customize
this? I'd like to have something like ATAN2 there as well.

 * Is the RGBPoints=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
parameter responsible for the colormap?

Cheers,
Nico

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView + Python: WriteImage screenshots broken?
Message-ID: <BANLkTimVQkLgFyannzxpeiTWfQjnajpeig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

everytime I call

   WriteImage("test.png")

from on the python interface, no screenshot is created and instead the
error message

================== *snip* ==================
X Error of failed request:  BadRequest (invalid request code or no
such operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  0 ()
  Serial number of failed request:  67
  Current serial number in output stream:  69
================== *snap* ==================

is issued on the command line.

This is with ParaView 3.10.1 on GNU/Linux on xorg-server 1.10.1.

Anyone else with this?

Cheers,
Nico

Magnitude corresponds to the magnitude of a vector, so yes, it takes
the square root.

If you want to do arbitrary arithmetic, you will have to first
generate the array using something like a "Calculator" filter and then
color using the generated array.

Yes, RGBPoints defines the mapping between scalar and color. It's a
list of 4 tuples (scalar, r, g, b), repeated sequentially.

Try setting:

v.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0

before calling WriteImage.
Does that help?

Oh, if I remember correctly I did look into this before, and found the
calculator filter too limited on the arithmetics that you could
perform. Is it still the case that you have a set of like ten
functions (add, multiply, sine, cosine,...) to mix and match? I need
to to something like

for x in data_values:
    if x[0] > 0 and x[1] > 0
        return bla
    elseif ...

-- atan2() that is.

Hm, I'll look into it. Where's the proper spot for documentation of this?

The python programmable filter (and the easier to use python programmable
calculator variant of that) will get you beyond all of those limitations.

What do you mean by "v"?

I took a wild guess and did

============== *snip* ==============
from paraview.simple import *
reader = ExodusIIReader(FileName="solution.e")
view = GetActiveView()
view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0
Show()
Render()
WriteImage("test.png")
============== *snap* ==============

but merely got

============== *snip* ==============
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "screenshot.py", line 12, in <module>
    view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute
'UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots'
============== *snap* ==============

Something seems to go wrong with GetActiveView().

Also the standard calculator does have conditionals, there just isn't a
button corresponding to them on the UI. See the manual for the syntax.

Hello,I am looking for a CFD simulation dataset together with the corresponding CAD model.The bluntfin dataset included in the the PV distrib is ok but unfortunately only the simulation data are provided, do you know where I could download the corresponding CAD data?Any other set (CAD + CFD data) in the aeronautics domains, particularly turbine models, would be appreciated.

Try GetRenderView() instead of GetActiveView().  GetRenderView will get the
active render view or create one if one does not already exist.

Utkarsh

Since you brought up the topic of not "apply"ing filters on creation. Can you tell me a quick fix of how to prevent this related bug of multiple execution of filters ...

Example
1) Load a dataset in parallel
2) Add a Probe Location filter.
I've added output messages to the executives to say when NeedToUpdate returns true and why and here's what I get.
On creation of the filter and hitting apply

vtkPProbeFilter DDP NeedtoUpdate Pipeline Time
vtkPProbeFilter DDP NeedtoUpdate Pipeline Time

Immediatly afterwards ...the probe updates again but this time

vtkPProbeFilter SDDP NeedtoUpdate GhostLevel
vtkPProbeFilter SDDP NeedtoUpdate GhostLevel

Some of these operations take a very long time in my case and having to execute twice is very painful. The trouble is I can't seem to shut the ghostlevel request off (I'm handling ghosts manually, so I don't need ghost levels specified in the information - though I'd rather use the information, but have a ghost region as a 3D extent not a 'level')

Can you tell me where the ghost level is being set. I've put breakpoints on all the obvious places ...but somewhere in one of the geometry/surface/other display filters it must be being set afterwards

Thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Concept: A world without the Apply button

Folks,

I have been investigating the ability to create pipelines in ParaView
without having to hit Apply at every single stage in the pipeline.
This would make it much easier to deal with really large data in a
usage scenario where the scientist is fairly familiar with the
visualization pipeline he's interested in setting up.

Following the recent changes to the ParaView ServerManager, the
ServerManager level requirement that filters need to be updated before
connecting has disappeared. However, we still need to "Apply" to get
updated information about arrays etc.

After a couple on discussions with Berk and Dave, I've consolidated
the thoughts on a Wiki page. If any one has any thoughts to share, it
would be great.

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/No-Apply_Mechanism_for_Creating_Pipelines

Note that this is merely a concept. We have no plans of implementing
it in near future (3.12/4.0).

Utkarsh

I'm pretty sure the Ghost level request is coming from the
representation, namely
vtkGeometryRepresentation::RequestUpdateExtent(). Can you check where
the first Update is coming from?

I figured out where the first update is coming from, it's coming from
the GUI since it want to determine what type of representation to
create based on the data produced by the reader. There it doesn't
request any ghost cells. Tricky issue, let me discuss with Berk on how
we can solve this.

OK, I see where you're going, the second one is correct, but the first one is spurious (I was thinking the wrong way around)

Does this stack trace help? It looks like it's the new SISourceProxy that originates the first update...(looking at the message, it does indeed receive an UpdatePipeline command from the client server stream).

And yes, the GeometryRepresentation triggers the second (which makes sense)

Our messages crossed in flight. My suggestion would be to set the ghost level to one in the initial request, when running in parallel.

Hi Utkarsh,

The issues may be due to my misuse of your design :). I have had 
immediate mode disabled for quite some time as it had greatly improved 
performance. however this seams to be a major factor in the huge memory 
bloat when using LIC rep.

When I enabled immediate mode, memory usage peaks around 3GB, which 
still seams a bit high, but much more reasonable than 18GB. And the 
growth in memory usage is much smaller, if at all (it's been harder to 
examine many steps because of the performance issue).

The performance is so reduced in immediate mode that it's nearly 
impossible to use (5+ minute for each render).

I haven't had any success running the LIC parallel, artefacts appear at 
process boundaries. I had tried running D3 on the reader which doesn't 
generate ghost layer requests yet, but this was unsuccessful.

Can the LIC work in parallel?

Hi Aashish,

Great! My big thanks for sharing your reader. I will check and
hopefully I should be able to wrap the reader as a ParaView plugin.

Sure. I might be able make this reader as part of VTK and if you are
willing to share your plugin then probably we could make that as part
of Paraview source code.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Cropped screenshots?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=PGutayOdEagv8ciL=stfggrZefQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

is there a way to autocrop a view or to generate cropped screenshots
(via WriteImage()) natively in ParaView?

So far I just write out the file and then crop it manually with
another software which feels like correcting something that could be
done properly straight away.

Cheers,
Nico

The only way I can think is to set the image size and the camera location correctly so you don't have excess space around your data. 

Image size is set by:

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
RenderView1.ViewSize = [1160, 760]

And the camera location can be changed by:

RenderView1.CameraPosition = [0.057, 0.0049999997718259692, 0.35]

and the zoom (I think anyway, all the camera stuff is a little confusing for me):

RenderView1.CameraParallelScale = 0.039

But, I generally find it much easier to just crop the image since tweaking these things isn't always easy for me to figure out.

The performance degradation in immediate mode is expected. If I
remember correctly, the LIC algo renders the geometry twice, once to
produce the standard rendering and second time to generate projected
vector fields which are then processed to generate the LIC image that
is then finally blended with the original rendering.

The current implementation does not do anything special to handle
parallel rendering, so artifacts are expected. The problem is cannot
be simply overcome by D3 or ghost-cells, unfortunately.

Stephen,

Your pvd file is ill-formed. It's not a valid XML. it has a missing
"<Collection>" element at the beginning.

I am sorry, I have no experience with express versions of visual
studio. In the retail versions of VS2005 and greater there are Visual
Studio x64 (and 32 bit ones also) command prompts in the tools menu
for each compiler. Opening up the x64 command prompt sets a few
environment variables that set cc and nmake to build 64 bit
applications.

It should be win32-msvc2010 even on 64 bit builds.

Subject: [Paraview] VTK import question
Message-ID: <BANLkTik0Ekb0Ehh9O+YEuVoCJmjc-B324w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to use paraview to visualize a particle cloud with some
properties. To do this I output the data as vtk polydata. I create n
particles and n vertices. on the particles. Paraview draws this nicely
and I can use it for what I want.

The problem is that the first point is moved back to origin. Is this a
bug or a feature? What should I do to get around it? Is there some
other way to get my data into paraview (different vtk type maybe?)?

Thanks for your time,
Milan Mitrovic

Dear all,

I have just checked, the previously fix has not been integrated. Is
there a reason? Currently there is a nice conditional, but afterwards
vtkParallelPythonD is unconditionally linked anyway ;))
Here again a patch against the latest git from git://paraview.org/Xdmf.git.
Can you please commit it or let me do it?

Many thanks.

Can you please review and commit or let me commit?

Thanks,
Dominik

Thanks, it indeed was missing. Strange that it worked in the past but no 
doubt my source was modified as some point.
Thanks again,

patch2 contained unnecessary degradation from const_iterator to
iterator, the newly attached avoids it.
Both attached again for clarity.
Sorry.

I have a feeling these fixes are on the pv branch of Xdmf.git already but
possibly not master because we have nightly dashboards that build ParaView
with VS10 + 64bit. I'll see about correcting the divergence.

Hi Dominik,

This patch request confuses me since currently we are not explicitly link to
python unless it is enabled. The code currently in the pv branch of XDMF is:

  IF(VTK_WRAP_PYTHON)
    INCLUDE(${VTK_CMAKE_DIR}/vtkWrapPython.cmake OPTIONAL)
    VTK_WRAP_PYTHON2(vtk${PROJECT_NAME}Python XdmfPython_SRCS ${Xdmf_SRCS})
    VTK_ADD_LIBRARY(vtk${PROJECT_NAME}Python MODULE ${XdmfPython_SRCS}
${Xdmf_SRCS})
    IF(VTK_USE_PARALLEL)
      TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(vtk${PROJECT_NAME}Python vtkIOPythonD
vtkRenderingPythonD vtkParallelPythonD Xdmf)
    ELSE(VTK_USE_PARALLEL)
      TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(vtk${PROJECT_NAME}Python vtkIOPythonD
vtkRenderingPythonD Xdmf)
    ENDIF(VTK_USE_PARALLEL)
    ADD_DEPENDENCIES(vtk${PROJECT_NAME}Python vtk${PROJECT_NAME})
  ENDIF(VTK_WRAP_PYTHON)

Hi Milan,

This sounds like a bug in your code. VTK does not enforce the first point
being at origin. I would confirm your code is using zero based indexing and
is properly relating the cell -> point relationship.

Definitely not a feature.

Can you post a sample vtkPolyData that demonstrates the problem?

Message-ID: <330982FDAEE84004B51959E1283AF3A7@win.ara>


Dear All,

Is it possible to store a vtkMultiBlockDataSet within a block of a
vtkMultiBlockDataSet? I've tried it and, so far, only the top level data set
is being recognised with their contents being empty (or nan's). I had
thought this was possible, but maybe I'm missing something. My example code
is below:

  output->SetNumberOfBlocks(1);
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkMultiBlockDataSet> blocks =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkMultiBlockDataSet>::New();
  blocks->SetNumberOfBlocks(structuredBlocks.size());

  vtkstd::map<vtkstd::string, vtkSmartPointer<vtkStructuredGrid> >::iterator
strIt;
  unsigned int counter = 0;
  for ( strIt = structuredBlocks.begin(); strIt != structuredBlocks.end();
++strIt ) {
    blocks->SetBlock(counter,(*strIt).second);
    blocks->GetMetaData(counter)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
(*strIt).first.c_str());
    counter++;
  }
  output->SetBlock((uint) 0, blocks);
  output->GetMetaData((uint) 0)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"Structured");

Thanks,

Adriano

Subject: [Paraview] Issue with vtkStructuredGrid and ParaView
Message-ID: <793D517AC65941AF8D8A08AC678885B1@win.ara>


I am trying to visualise a structured grid using ParaView. I am able to
create a vtkStructuredGrid and read it into ParaView fine. ParaView returns
the correct number of points and cells. However, it doesn't display anything
even though I followed the example in the VTK tutorials. Have I missed a
step out or could this be related to my (I,J) ordering? Example code below:

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkStructuredGrid> grid =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkStructuredGrid>::New();
  grid->SetDimensions(i, j, 1);
  grid->SetPoints(nodes);
  for (int var = 0; var != numVars; ++var)
    grid->GetPointData()->AddArray(vars[var]);
  grid->Update();

Thanks,

Adriano

Yes it is possible. I have it running since several years.

source code:

  vtkMultiBlockDataSet* mb = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(doOutput);

  vtkMultiBlockDataSet *volumes, *boundaries, *solid0, *solid1, *solid2, *solid3;
  volumes = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();

I added your suggestion (and tried the other extent member functions) but it
had no effect. However, if I merge blocks so I'm left with a
vtkStructuredGrid, rather than a vtkMultiBlockDataSet containing a
vtkStructuredGrid, I can see the mesh. I'll keep trying with it.

Jean/Paul,

Ok, I found the issue and I've got it working now. Your responses got me
thinking and I finally found that the issue was with the smart pointer,
blocks. After using blocks for the structured grid, I did a bad thing and
re-used it for unstructured grids without calling delete which, for the unit
test I was running, did not exist. Because I wasn't handling the pointer
correctly and the unstructured block data was empty, this corrupted the
storage for both structured and unstructured blocks. I've switched to
ordinary pointers and just called delete when appropriate. The code is
below. 

Thanks for clearing that up!

Adriano

  output->SetNumberOfBlocks(2);
  vtkMultiBlockDataSet* blocks = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();

  blocks->SetNumberOfBlocks(structuredBlocks.size());
  vtkstd::map<vtkstd::string, vtkSmartPointer<vtkStructuredGrid> >::iterator
strIt;
  unsigned int counter = 0;
  for ( strIt = structuredBlocks.begin(); strIt != structuredBlocks.end();
++strIt ) {
    blocks->SetBlock(counter,(*strIt).second);
    blocks->GetMetaData(counter)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
(*strIt).first.c_str());
    counter++;
  }
  output->SetBlock((uint) 0, blocks);
  blocks->Delete();
  output->GetMetaData((uint) 0)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"Structured");

  blocks = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();
  blocks->SetNumberOfBlocks(unstructuredBlocks.size());
  vtkstd::map<vtkstd::string, vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid>
>::iterator unsIt;
  counter = 0;
  for ( unsIt = unstructuredBlocks.begin(); unsIt !=
unstructuredBlocks.end(); ++unsIt ) {
    blocks->SetBlock(counter,(*unsIt).second);
    blocks->GetMetaData(counter)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
(*unsIt).first.c_str());
    counter++;
  }
  output->SetBlock((uint) 1, blocks);
  blocks->Delete();
  output->GetMetaData((uint) 1)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"Unstructured");

Hi Robert,

correct to have:

In summary, what is currently in the master branch:

1 if parallel vtk then
2 link with vtk parallel lib
3 else
4 do not link with vtk parallel lib
5 link with vtk parallel lib

My patch simply removes line 5.

PS. I am still worried not having a clear image which Xdmf source I
should use. On the wiki page I count 2, the 3rd one is the original
one, now you tell me about PV branch. Why is this all needed?

Regards,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf does not compile python wrappings on MSVC2010 64 bit
Message-ID: <BANLkTik6OqXAkUDnmKP9vA93zr9xrowASg@mail.gmail.com>

I have proven it experimentally: the python xdmf module would not load
on Windows, and there are no *.pyd files generated. It works only on
linux.
I recently had a similar issue with VTK, see thread "vtkmy python
bindings with MSVC2010 64bit" on the VTK list.
I was able to resolve it for VTK, generate the pyd files and load the
modules. The same does not work here,

Please advise.

Dominik

Hi guys,

Me again!

My config is : Windows 7 64 bits, VS2010 (and SDK 7.1 to get the 64 bits 
version compiler).
I managed to build Qt and Paraview... unfortunatelly, paraview crashes 
just after the splash screen :-\
I was suspecting the Qt version to be responsible since I have installed 
the binaries Qt4.7.3 built using VS2008 (32 bits?).
Perhaps an issue with the VS2008 Version or the 4.7.3 that was not 
tested with paraview.

Then, I have looked for sources in this page :
ftp://ftp.trolltech.no/qt/source/ (I have also checked that one that is 
identical ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/)
The most recent source version is the 4.5.3 for windows (and also for 
the 'all' distribution), open source. I have built it.... but when I run 
CMake to configure paraview project, it complains because it needs Qt 
4.6.0 or greater.
How can I do? There is no sources for 4.6.0. The only Qt4.6.0 or greater 
available as sources are for 'everywhere', 'mac' 'symbian'. I have tried 
using the 'everywhere' distribution V 4.7.3, and paraview doesn't start. 
I have also tried using 'everywhere-4.6.2, but building exits with an error.

Can you advice me?
Thanks,
Laurent.

Dear all,

Maybe I missed something, but I cannot find a development version for
ParaView-3.10 such the one that exists for 3.8. What is the status of this
really useful package ?

Thanks a lot !

I can tell you that the everywhere-opensource-4.6.X and
everywhere-opensource-4.7.X downloads work with visual studio since I
use them daily with VS2005 x32, VS2008 x32 and x64 and vs2010 x64 with
my two large projects (on a handful of machines) that use Qt, cmake,
vtk ... You can also download a binary version and recompile for a
different compiler but I have not done that in a few releases. My
advice is make sure that you are using the expected Qt version when
running paraview. If you have any other qt dlls on you system zip them
up. Also do not mix debug and release or compiler versions. Remember
that with Visual Studio you can not safely mix compiler versions and
you also can not safely mix debug and release in the same application.

John

I am not sure it's exposed in the GUI, but you can change the
"SelectionLineWidth" property on the selected representation from
Python.

Hi Jerome

It's on my todo, unfortunately I had to jump onto other things right after
the 3.10 releases and haven't been able to do a round of development
packages.

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver is
Message-ID: <4DF23807.1030004@uclouvain.be>

Dear all,

I have installed paraview 3.10.1 64 bits version.
Since then, I have a console that opens up (mpiexec.exe). In task 
manager, I have 8 pvserver.exe that run (1 per CPU!).
How can I prevent that?
I don't want to run paraview in server mode, I want the cleint mode (I 
guess that my problem is related to server).

I am also trying to build paraview from sources. Is there any 
possibility of conflict between install and built versions?
Thanks,
Laurent.

I suspect that "Use Multi-Core" is turned on in the application settings.
Turn that off and paraview won't automatically spawn and connect to the
parallel server anymore.

Subject: [Paraview] Setting a color map
Message-ID: <CA17CE1D.3288%reuterma@ornl.gov>

Hi,

 I have a pqColorMapModel that I want to programmatically (C++) set on a pqPipelineRepresentation. I've been looking at the code and thought that the way forward was via pqScalarsToColors and setting the LookupTable property on the representation. However, I don't see a way to translate between the pqColorMapModel and pqScalarsToColors. What is the correct way to handle this situation?

Thanks,
M

After trying a few variations of SetExtent, UpdateWholeExtent, etc, I have
still got no further with this. However, after reading the mesh in, I can
now actually view it if I set the representation to Outline. Otherwise, I
get a blank 3D view. Converting to an unstructured grid using connectivity
or merge blocks also allows me to view the mesh.

In light of this, I took a sample piece of code out and implemented it
through the Programmable filter and it works fine from there. However, I've
now run out of time to get this working perfectly. If anyone has any
suggestions for things to try in the future, I'd be happy to hear them.

I added your suggestion (and tried the other extent member functions) but it
had no effect. However, if I merge blocks so I'm left with a
vtkStructuredGrid, rather than a vtkMultiBlockDataSet containing a
vtkStructuredGrid, I can see the mesh. I'll keep trying with it.

Sounds like you are missing something like

   grid->SetWholeExtent(0,i-1, 0, j-1, 0, 0);

This is a known issue in current PV and I was told it a workaround
would be an option in the next release. I got a patch if you want.

Yeah, if you have a patch to fix this, that would be great. I'd be

This is a known issue in current PV and I was told it a workaround would be
an option in the next release. I got a patch if you want.

Out of curiosity, how was the pqColorMapModel created? It's generally
easier to directly manipulate the properties of a lookup table proxy.
To provide you with the easiest path forward, I was wondering what
your setup is. Has the user chosen the array to color by and now you
want to change the  existing LUT's properties or do you want to setup
a brand new LUT for this representation. In case of former, any other
representation being colored with the same array will automatically
use your changed LUT, which won't be the case with the latter.

My current situation is that the user has already chosen an array to color
by. I'm then using the handy dialog box provided by the
pqColorPresetManager to allow the user to select a new colormap. I
retrieve the pqColorMapModel from the selection and then I want to apply
the new colormap to the current color array.

Cheers,
M

Subject: [Paraview] Is is possible to create second filters menu?
Message-ID: <1307994228.12152.23.camel@cribber>

Dear all 

Is it possible to create a second filters menu which I specify plugin
filters to be added to?

I can create a static menu from the main application using
pqProxyGroupMenuManager() with the appropriate XML but cannot work out
how to specify make filters from plugins go to the new menu rather than
the filters menu. I guess I would like to be able to do something like
specify a ProxyGroup (i.e. <ProxyGroup name="MyGroup"> ... )  in the
plugin XML which puts filters in the new menu rather than in with the
filters as a normal <ProxyGroup name="filters"> does.

Any suggestions and or help is welcome.

Kit

You are on the right track. Any proxy registered in the "filters" group from
the plugins will automatically end up in the "Filters" menu, there's no way
around it. The solution would be create a new group for your filters that's
being shown in your menu. Theoretically, it should work, but I don't think
we test it, but definitely worth a try.

I couldn't find any code that converts a pqColorMapModel to properties
on the LUT proxy directly. However, once you get access to the
existing LUT proxy on the representation, it shouldn't be too hard to
map the scalar+color values from the pqColorMapModel to the RGBPoints
on the LUT proxy. To access the LUT proxy you can use
pqDataRepresentation::getLookupTableProxy().  There's code in
pqColorScaleEditor::loadPreset that may help, but it doesn't update
the proxy directly.

Subject: [Paraview] loading data inside the domain
Message-ID: <BANLkTikoT5X=FCd8VD9WQS7A2Oa=65r_fw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a dataset that visualizes fluid flow inside a pipe, and the pipe is
created via stairstepping.  In EnSight, I can easily view only the region
inside the stairstepped geometry by creating an "iblank" array that tags
nodes inside the domain (iblank = 1) and outside the domain (iblank = 0).
Is there something analogous to this in ParaView?  Thanks.

Ok, 

Here's what I have so far:

The filters for the new menu are given a different ProxyGroup name
("myfiltergroup" ) in the XML i.e 
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="myfiltergroup">
   <SourceProxy name="MyCellDerivatives" class="vtkCellDerivatives"
label="My Cell Derivatives">
     <Documentation
        long_help="Create point attribute array by projecting points
onto an elevation vector."
        short_help="Create a point array representing elevation.">
     </Documentation>
     <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInputConnection">
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="filters">
             <Group name="sources"/>
             <Group name="filters"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
             <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
           </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>
   </SourceProxy>
</ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>


Then I define a menu builder function which is called from the
MainWindow app.

void MyMenuBuilders::buildSecondFiltersMenu(QMenu* menu, QMainWindow*
mainWindow)
{
  pqProxyGroupMenuManager* mgr =
    new pqProxyGroupMenuManager(menu, "mysetfilters");
  mgr->setRecentlyUsedMenuSize(10);
  new RosieProcessingMenuReactions(mgr);

  new pqUpdateProxyDefinitionsBehavior(
    pqUpdateProxyDefinitionsBehavior::ANY, "myfiltergroup", mgr);
  pqPVApplicationCore::instance()->registerForQuicklaunch(menu);

  if (mainWindow)
  {
    // create toolbars for categories as needed.
    new pqCategoryToolbarsBehavior(mgr, mainWindow);
  }
}


I can specify various filters to be loaded at startup by putting them
inside the mysetfilters XML  (i.e. just like the ParaViewFilters XML
object). However, The when the above server manager XML is used a plugin
it doesn't come up in the menu.

Any ideas as to what I'm missing here? Any guidance is welcome.

Subject: [Paraview] Location of patches for memory leak in 3.10.0
Message-ID: <440112.89055.qm@web110416.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Dear List,

I am having the problems discussed here:
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-April/020926.html

I would like to patch them and recompile paraview, as this is a somewhat problematic issue for me with my current work -- I am unable to complete any animation for presenting my work to others.

Does anyone know what, or where these patches are?

Thanks

If I remember correctly, those were applied to the 3.10.1 source release.
You can download the source code here.

Hi,

Is there a way to get cmake to install the Python vtk wrappers located in
VTK/Wrapping/Python/vtk of the build directory?

There is a setup.py in the build tree of VTK/Wrappying/Python. You should be
able to use that to invoke a distutils installation of VTK-Python.

Subject: [Paraview] Compilation problem
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=yRoJ2pGqj9tVNijLHU1PQ4k4rCg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I recently install on my laptop (Intel M520 with Integrated Graphics
Controller and Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS) Paraview 3.10.1 pre-compiled binaries.
Nevertheless, I had some problems with that version, it crashes when saving
screenshot, the error is :
----
X Error: GLXBadContextTag 170
Extension:    153 (Uknown extension)
Minor opcode: 142 (Unknown request)

process_responses:  L'assertion ? !(req && current_request && !(((long)
(req->sequence) - (long) (current_request)) <= 0)) ? a ?chou?.
----

Therfore, I decided to compile the source but I also had an error when I
built Paraview. My configuration file is :

----
 BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
ON

 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

and the error is :

If anyone has any suggestions, I would be happy to hear them.

The solution would be create a new group for your filters that's being shown in your menu. Theoretically, it should work, but I don't think we test it, but definitely worth a try.

I guess I would like to be able to do something like specify a ProxyGroup (i.e. <ProxyGroup name="MyGroup"> ... )? in the plugin XML which puts filters in the new menu rather than in with the filters as a normal <ProxyGroup name="filters"> does.

Hi,

If the Ensight file has a cell or point data array which the domain you can
use the threshold filter to view only the cells which are in the domain.

Hi Terry,

The flash support through ParaViewWeb works as a client where the
rendering is done remotely. So you can not use that technique for a
visualization in a PowerPoint. The flash application that you get is
not a standalone SWF file that you may play again offline.

Although, you might need to explain what you mean by "interactive
session of ParaView". Is it an interactive 3D scene with a static
content or the content is going to change based on some filter
parameter update ?

If the content is going to be static, you may want to export the scene
and view it inside any "smaller viewer".

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Windows install path
Message-ID: <BFC6F607797EE4439A63CAC7BC43A1D10B1DBC@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Hi,

We're working on a cross-platform application, which uses some of the paraview libraries. Ultimately, we want our users to be able to install Paraview, and then install our packages. For this to work, on Windows we need to be able to identify where Paraview has been installed to and add it to the Path. This doesn't seem to be an option with the current Paraview install.

My temporary fix has been to change CPACK_NSIS_MODIFY_PATH from OFF to ON in \Applications\ParaView\CMakeLists.txt, which provides the extra screen in the NSIS installer and then package up Paraview for distribution myself.

Is there a better way of doing this?
Is this kind of install something that could be provided as an option without modifying CMake files?

Thanks in advance,

Owen.

Hi Owen,

You can use the registry to determine where ParaView is currently installed
on a Windows Machine. The keys you want to look for are:


   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Kitware Inc.\ParaView 3.10.X
   (64bit machines single user install)
   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Kitware Inc.\ParaView 3.10.X (32bit machines
   single user install)
   - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Kitware Inc.\ParaView 3.10.X
   (64bit machines all users)
   - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Kitware Inc.\ParaView 3.10.X (32bit
   machines all users)

Once you find the correct registry entry I would than add that to a
custom environment variable rather than path that your application also
looks at. Adding ParaView to the users path code cause problems if they have
multiple instances installed.

Related to the latter case (3D scene with static content), I had good
luck with converting an X3D scene exported from ParaView into U3D
using Meshlab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) and then embedding U3D
into a PDF document. Something similar should be doable with
Powerpoint I'd think.

I'm not sure about the compilation error - but if you still have the paraview that works, but crashes on screenshots -toggle the value of the "use offscreen rendering for screenshots" checkbox in the edit/preferences/whatever menu/dialog - this usually fixes it.

Subject: [Paraview] Compilation problem

Dear all,

I recently install on my laptop (Intel M520 with Integrated Graphics Controller and Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS) Paraview 3.10.1 pre-compiled binaries. Nevertheless, I had some problems with that version, it crashes when saving screenshot, the error is :
----
X Error: GLXBadContextTag 170
Extension:    153 (Uknown extension)
Minor opcode: 142 (Unknown request)
Resource id:  0x1

process_responses:  L'assertion ? !(req && current_request && !(((long) (req->sequence) - (long) (current_request)) <= 0)) ? a ?chou?.
----

Therfore, I decided to compile the source but I also had an error when I built Paraview. My configuration file is :

----

and the error is :

If anyone has any suggestions, I would be happy to hear them.

Robert,

So for example, that would mean actually dumping the "iblank" array I was
referring to, and this only viewing cells that have a value > 0... Does that
sound right to you?

Jeremy,

That sounds correct. Once you dump the Ensight file with iblank array, apply
a threshold filter with the min set to be above 0.

Message-ID: <942D92BD-6451-40C1-8D67-D939F9DEC090@mcs.anl.gov>

Hi,

This is probably a silly question, but is there a straightforward way to change the orientation of a color legend from the default of vertical to horizontal?  I typically end up interactively resizing it until I somehow magically get it to flip orientation.  Is there a checkbox in the GUI somewhere that I've been missing?

Thanks,
joe.

Drag the color legend to the top or bottom of the view.  When it gets
near, it will automatically flip.

That will work. I created a sphere source, then tried this in the python shell:

>>> GetSources()
{('Sphere1', '71'): <paraview.servermanager.Sphere object at 0xb6f13ec>}

>>> dp = GetDisplayProperties('Sphere1')

but I got:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/paraview/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", line 160,
in GetDisplayProperties
    return GetRepresentation(proxy, view)
  File "/usr/lib/paraview/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", line 151,
in GetRepresentation
    rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(proxy, view)
  File "/usr/lib/paraview/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py",
line 2052, in CreateRepresentation
    display = view.SMProxy.CreateDefaultRepresentation(aProxy.SMProxy, 0)
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'SMProxy'

Once we resolve this, would it just be

dp.Representation.SelectionLineWidth = 3

?

Thanks,

David

can be related to the ActiveMQ version 3.3.0 or 3.3.4 ?

which version do you suggest?

I have tried to use an older version of ActiveMQ but did not found any 
older sources.

thanks in advance

Hi Luigi,

Please check that wiki page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Building which explain which
version is compatible with what.

Seb

PS: activemq-cpp 3.1.x is the solution... Or submit a patch with the
API changed that occurs in activemq-cpp 3.2+

Hi

I need to plot some data on a 2D polar plot. Is there pre existing

I have looked at the classes provided by VTK but couldn't find any thing
that would do the job.

Subject: [Paraview] Recommendations for display of 4D color dataset
Message-ID: <BANLkTikZVMCxvxgGLzF39nRbqMzH0a0cLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm investigating methods for display of a 4D microscopy dataset. I'd
like to be able to reproduce the style of display provided by Imaris,
however I'm not entirely sure how Imaris does it. It may be volume
rendering or a clever surface rendering.

The data is from a confocal microscope and has 3 fluorescent channels.
I can convert the data to many forms - at present I have it as 3
channel mha and 3 individual mha files.

The things I've tried are 1) volume rendering each channel
independently and applying a red, green or blue colormap. However I
don't seem to be able to set a different colormap for each volume. 2)
using the contour filter to create several contours for each channel
and colour the result. If I use a solid color for each channel and
play with opacity I can get interesting results. However I'd like to
be able to colour according to underlying brightness. I have the same
trouble with colourmaps in this approach as I do for the volume
rendering - I am only able to set one colourmap. A temporary option is
to use the colourmap for the most important channel and use solid
colors for the others.

Is anyone able to recommend a better way?

Subject: [Paraview] how to constrain interaction widgets ?
Message-ID: <BANLkTinsoHQ+=fPjHig91U6t8zWYMxz+Ag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have been trying to add a line widget to my view with one end fixed at the
origin. Basically it is going to represent and incoming ray and is going to
be used for getting the incident angle of the ray on which my filter will
work.

I looked at the elevation filter and added the line as described there but
the resulting line widget has both end freely movable. Also how can i make
the panel to be updated with the angle of the line vector instead of the
point coordinates?

thanks

What kind of data do you have? If it is simply a 2d grid, then i don't 
think that there should be a problem.
If you're problem is that you don't have the coordinates, then you might 
be able to write a simple python script to
generate it (in whatever file format you are using).

Well the data is very simple. It just has two columns one containing angles
from 0 - 360 degrees and the corresponding value for each angle.
The plotting has to be done in polar coordinates using the value as radius
and the angle as theta.

I am working on a custom app and need to make a plugin using c++. So need to
know whether there is some existing filter that I can tweak to get the job
done or I need to create my own class.

Hi,

In addition to VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA, VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN, and VTK_USE_X
what are the settings you used for

      OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR
      OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY
      OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY
      OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR
      OSMESA_LIBRARY

? You might want to attach your CMakeCache.txt, makes it easier in
general to track things like this down.

Karl

Hi,
Thanks for your response. I'm sorry, I forgot to attach the CMakeCache.
Here's what I set:

OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/include
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/libGL.so
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/libGLU.so
OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/include
OSMESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/libOSMesa.so

I'm compiling Paraview in a Fedora14 64bits
and the file CMakeCache is attached.
Thanks again :)

Hi,

I'm not perfectly sure the error you're seeing is caused by it, but
there is at least the following error in your setup: It's been recently
discussed on this mailing list that with newer versions of Mesa (> 7.5
or 7.7, I don't recall this right now) the OSMesa library does not
depend on GL (or X) and can not be linked with any other GL library. See
http://markmail.org/message/wutdc3yp56l4nmay. (Not sure which version of
Mesa ships with Fedora 14.)

Kevin also pointed out in the same thread (attachment of
http://markmail.org/message/d74tvmox4afwjqkh) that you need to leave
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY empty for newer Mesa versions. You need to reconfigure
and recompile from scratch, though.

 cmake \
               -DOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR:STRING=/usr/include \
               -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY:STRING= \
               -DOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY=/usr/lib64/libGLU.so \
               -DOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR:STRING=/usr/include \
               -DOSMESA_LIBRARY:STRING=/usr/lib64/libOSMesa.so
               -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI:BOOL=OFF \
               -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA:BOOL=ON \
               -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON \
               -DVTK_USE_X:BOOL=OFF

Hope that helps

ParaView associates color maps with array-names, so all arrays with
the same name use the same color map. An easiest way around this is to
apply the "Calculator" filter to each of the mha file readers set the
expression to the name of the input array while change the "Result
Array Name" for every instance of the calculator to be something
unique. Now you can color the results produced by each of the
calculators differently using different colormaps.

I just noticed that vtk is installed in INSTALL_DIR/bin/Python.  Is there
any reason why this isn't in the site packages in the lib/paraview
directory?

Is it possible to get my python wrapper for my vtk classes that I have in my
plugins?

Thanks,
Paul

Not exactly sure we are talking about the same thing, but if you just want
to make sure that the C++ code in your plugin is usable from VTK and
ParaView's python interfaces, take a look at:
1) Plugins/Manta/VTK/CMakeLists which can do python wrapping for the VTK
level classes there so that you can instantiate a vtkMantaRenderer for
example from vtkpython.
2) the WRAP_PLUGIN_FOR_PYTHON macro, defined in
Plugins/ParaViewPlugins.cmake which wraps the entire plugin so that you can
load the plugin from pvpython/pvbatch.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.10.1 using python to slice and integrate variable
Message-ID: <4DF8C42B.3060907@inria.fr>

We are using PV to analyze flow around a sphere.

1- We extract the surface of the sphere from the mean flow solution.
2- We make a slice in x (say at the center x=0)
3- Then click integrate variables. Result: We get the integrated values 
for the circle at x=0.
4- We would like to create a python script do automate this for say 60 
slices.

Would someone share a python script that we could adapt to do this? (We 
have zero experience with python).
We would be greatly appreciative!

Did you try python trace?  Tools menu --> Start Trace.  Then load your data
and carry out steps 1, 2, and 3.  Tools menu --> Stop Trace.

Thanks a lot John,

I uncheked  ?use offscreen rendering for screenshots? and  the pre-compiled
paraview version does not crash anymore.

If anyone has any suggestions concerning the compilation problem, I would
still be happy to hear them (maybe, I will have to build paraview in the
near future)

Folks,

We are getting close to transitioning to the new git-workflow (thanks
to Brad King for painstakingly identifying possible issues we may run
into and developing infrastructure to avoid/recover from them). Brad
has written a simplified set of instructions for developers
http://public.kitware.com/Wiki/ParaView/Git/Develop. Now would be a
good time for ParaView developers to start skimming over these. If all
goes well, we should be able to transition to the new workflow as
early as next week.

Thanks Utkarsh! If anyone else is interested, this is all it took:

dp = GetDisplayProperties(FindSource("Sphere1")) dp.SelectionLineWidth = 5

Message-ID: <20110616151129.y6osck4400g08k8c@webmail.slingshot.co.nz>

Hi,

I am actually writing the ebuild for paraview 3.10.1 on Gentoo. While studying
how to enable python sip I came across two problems.
First SIP_PYQT_DIR was put to NOT_FOUND. It is because the path where
QtCore/QtCoremod.sip is located on Gentoo is /usr/share/sip which is not in the
path searched in
  # find .sip files for Qt
  find_path(SIP_PYQT_DIR NAMES QtCore/QtCoremod.sip
    PATHS ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH}/../Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/sip/PyQt4
          ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH}/../sip/PyQt4
          ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH}/../Versions/2.5/share/sip/PyQt4
          ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH}/../share/sip/PyQt4
          /usr/share/sip/PyQt4
          /usr/local/share/sip/PyQt4
    DOC "Root directory containing all PyQt4 sip files."
    )
in VTK/GUISupport/Qt/CMakeLists.txt.
A little hack later I had it properly detected. The next problem is I think a
little bit more serious. Once SIP_PYQT_DIR was found SIP_INCLUDE_DIR wasn't.
The code to set it in VTK/CMakeLists.txt is as follow:
IF(VTK_WRAP_PYTHON_SIP)
  FIND_PROGRAM(SIP_EXECUTABLE NAMES sip DOC "Path to sip executable")
  FIND_PATH(SIP_INCLUDE_DIR NAMES sip.h
    PATHS "${PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH}"
"${PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH}/../Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/include")
ENDIF(VTK_WRAP_PYTHON_SIP)

On my box sip.h is in /usr/include/python2.7 which you would expect to be
PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH. So why wasn't it found. My guess about this is that the
variable is empty because no python detection has occurred at this stage.
Passing -DSIP_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 works of course.

Subject: [Paraview] Is is possible to create second filters menu?

Ok, I'm still not having much luck with creating my own proxy group and
associated menu. Using the 3.11.1 code from the git i have the following
menu builder routine:

void pqParaView2MenuBuilders::buildFiltersMenu(QMenu& menu, QMainWindow*
mainWindow)
{
	  pqProxyGroupMenuManager* mgr = new pqProxyGroupMenuManager(&menu,
"ParaViewFilters2");
	  mgr->addProxyDefinitionUpdateListener("filters2");
	  mgr->setRecentlyUsedMenuSize(10);

	  new pq2FiltersMenuReaction(mgr);
	  pqPVApplicationCore::instance()->registerForQuicklaunch(&menu);
}


And a plugin filter specified as 

<ProxyGroup name="filters2">
   <SourceProxy name="MyElevationFilter" class="vtkMyElevationFilter"
label="MyElevation">
...
</ProxyGroup>

The pq2FiltersMenuReaction class is a copy of the class
pqFiltersMenuReaction. 

I have discovered at least one area where things are going wrong. For
some reason the new menu manager class is not created with any actions
so the foreach loop in the updateEnableState is never entered.

  pqProxyGroupMenuManager* mgr =
    static_cast<pqProxyGroupMenuManager*>(this->parent());
 mgr->setEnabled(enabled);
 bool some_enabled = false;
 
foreach (QAction* action, mgr->actions())
{
 ... [ never goes in here ]
}

Any suggestions? Is there anything special you need to define to
initialize your own proxy groups either in the plugin or as part of the
main app?

The solution would be create a new group for your filters that's being shown in your menu. Theoretically, it should work, but I don't think we test it, but definitely worth a try.

I guess I would like to be able to do something like specify a ProxyGroup (i.e. <ProxyGroup name="MyGroup"> ... )  in the plugin XML which puts filters in the new menu rather than in with the filters as a normal <ProxyGroup name="filters"> does.

Thanks Pat,
Worked correctly (We saved the .py script for reference)
with the following exception.
The integrate variables opens a spread sheet with the different values.
We then do save data to save the spreadsheet.
Stop trace
*But* the trace does not contain the save spread sheet commands. 
Therefore we do not see how to generalize the trace.py (add a loop over 
theta 0 - 180).
Almost there, what do you suggest?
Many thanks for your help.

Where can I find that? The ParaView User's Guide
<www.paraview.org/files/v1.6/ParaViewUsersGuide.PDF> isn't too verbose
on any of that.
The Wiki, on the other hand, seems to contain a fair amount of
examples. Specifically, I've looked at
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter> to see about
programmable filters.

Unfortunately, this hasn't gotten me very far, as I'm lacking
understanding of the entities used in the examples.
Questions I asked myself were:
 * What do I need to do to fetch my point data:
self.GetPolyDataInput()? self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)? Or simply
self.GetInput()?
 * How do I access point data then?
 * Do I have to create a new vector and feed this into some sort of
output thing?

Is there a documentation as to what methods are available for those types?

The input file is Exodus, if that makes any difference.

If there's a tutorial for this kind of stuff, I'll be happy to go
through it; otherwise I'd appreciate your help here.

Cheers,
Nico

Progress!
Thanks to the incredibly helpful Trance functionality, I understand
now that something like

=================== *snip* ===================
    calc1 = pv.Calculator( ResultArrayName = '|psi|^2' )
    calc1.AttributeMode = 'point_data'
    calc1.Function = 'psi__X^2 + psi__Y^2'

    [...]
    psi_lookup_table = pv.GetLookupTableForArray( '|psi|^2', 1 )
                                         )
    data_representation.ColorArrayName = '|psi|^2'
=================== *snap* ===================

will get me pretty close to where I want to be; except that Function()
is limited to whatever help( calc1 ) just told me. -- Conditionals /
atan2()?

Subject: [Paraview] saving animations from python
Message-ID: <DCD80035-348A-4AEE-BCE2-505AE88D3922@lsu.edu>

Hi,

I am trying to script still frames and movie animations (time evolution) in python. The goal is to do batch processing of a large number of simulations.

Parsing through the online documentation and wiki, I was able to do basic movie files using the AnimateReader function, but I can't figure out how to control the properties of the movie (number of frames, number of frames per second etc). Trace does not return anything useful when using File -> Save Animation? in the GUI.
   - Is it possible to set the options from the File -> Save Animation menu programmatically in python?

I also looked into using keyframes for the time evolution, following the 3rd example at file:///opt/HPC/ParaView-3.10.1/Documentation/Book/Book_Chapter14.html#Animating but still have issues: 
   - How do I set the cue in a keyframe to be the analysis time / time step number?
   - Is it possible to programmatically save an animation to an avi file in python?

Regards,

Blaise

Hi Blaise,

Here is some example code that should help:

#ensure you have cue and the keyframes already setup

    movie = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
    movie.ViewModules = [GetActiveView()]
    movie.NumberOfFrames = 10
    movie.Cues = [cue]

    movie_writer = servermanager.vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter()
    movie_writer.SetFileName("slice_movie.avi")
    movie_writer.SetFrameRate(2)
    movie_writer.SetQuality(2)
    #movie_writer.SetMagnification(2)
    movie_writer.SetAnimationScene(movie.SMProxy)
    movie_writer.Save()

If you want more information on each of these, open up the Python Shell and
take a look at the available functions.

Cheers,

Adriano

Okay, for everyone interested: I think I got it to work, somehow, with
the help of <http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Calculator>.

The atan2() function can be imitated in ParaView's calculator filter by

================== *snip* ==================
calc2 = pv.Calculator( ResultArrayName = 'arg(psi)' )
calc2.AttributeMode = 'point_data'
from math import pi
pi2 = str( pi/2 )
calc2.Function = 'if( psi__X>0, atan(psi__Y/psi__X),' + \
                        'if( psi__X<0,' + \
                            'if ( psi__Y<0, -%s + atan(psi__Y/psi__X),
%s + atan(psi__Y/psi__X) ),' % ( pi2, pi2 ) + \
                            'if ( psi__Y>0, %s, if( psi__Y<0, -%s, 0.0
) )' % ( pi2, pi2 ) + \
                        '))'
================== *snap* ==================

Here, psi is an array with two components which are addressed by
psi__X, psi__Y, respectively (double underscore!). The logic is taken
from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2#Definition>.

Cheers,
Nico

You could interactively run through the scripts with pvpython and then use
dir() and help() to figure out how to write out the information properly.
You'll probably need to do something like:
SetActiveSource(<the filter that connects to your writer>)
writer = XMLPolyDataWriter() # most writers take off the vtk part
writer.FileName= "file.vtp"
writer.UpdatePipeline()

Hope this helps,
Andy

Another option is to write a programmable filter that will take the input
(from the integrate variables) and write it out using standard python
commands. You can then reference this in your script.
 
iv = IntegrateVariables(Input=blah)
 
pf = ProgrammableFilter(Input=pf)
pf.Script = """
 
pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
 
your_var = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("your_var")
fout = open("results.txt",'a')
 
for i in xrange(len(your_var)):
  fout.write( "%s %s %s" % (your_var.GetTuple3(i)[0],
your_var.GetTuple3(i)[1], your_var.GetTuple3(i)[2]) )
fout.close()
"""
 
If you have a number of slices stored in a vtkMultiBlockDataSet then you'll
have to iterate over each of them first.

Thanks Pat,
Worked correctly (We saved the .py script for reference)
with the following exception.
The integrate variables opens a spread sheet with the different values.
We then do save data to save the spreadsheet.
Stop trace
*But* the trace does not contain the save spread sheet commands. Therefore
we do not see how to generalize the trace.py (add a loop over theta 0 -

Almost there, what do you suggest?
Many thanks for your help.

When running in parallel on windows, I get this (frequently)

I just closed the debugger and forgot to copy the stack trace, but can post it if it helps.

Is it a known issue? (I'm using IceT master, head of current git from the paraview repo) - can I just set piece offset to the process rank?

Line 109 of reduce.c
    if (icetIsEnabled(ICET_COLLECT_IMAGES)) {
        result_image = reduceCollect(composited_image,
                                     compose_tile,
                                     piece_offset);

John,

Earlier this week I merged a change in ParaView that uses the latest (not yet released) version of IceT.  You have the dubious honor of reporting the first problem.

It appears that the MSVC debugger is checking to make sure variables are set before used as an argument to a function. (Cool feature.  I didn't know it did that.)  It looks like I violated that.  I am pretty sure this is benign; the state that leads to uninitialized variables should mean they won't be used in the function.  It's still bad and dangerous practice though, so thanks for pointing it out.

Attached is a patch that should fix the problem.  Please apply it to reduce.c and let me know if it resolves the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] IceT problem

When running in parallel on windows, I get this (frequently)

I just closed the debugger and forgot to copy the stack trace, but can post it if it helps.

Is it a known issue? (I?m using IceT master, head of current git from the paraview repo) ? can I just set piece offset to the process rank?

Line 109 of reduce.c

A small correction to the previous script: Two pi2's should be
replaced by just pi. The correct Function is

================== *snip* ==================
    calc2.Function = 'if( psi__X>0, atan(psi__Y/psi__X),' + \
                     'if( psi__X<0,' + \
                         'if ( psi__Y<0, - %s + atan(psi__Y/psi__X),
%s + atan(psi__Y/psi__X) ),' % ( pi, pi ) + \
                     'if ( psi__Y>0, %s, if( psi__Y<0, -%s, 0.0 ) )' %
( pi2, pi2 ) + \
                     '))'
================== *snap* ==================

Sorry for all the spam! :)

John,

Earlier this week I merged a change in ParaView that uses the latest (not yet released) version of IceT.  You have the dubious honor of reporting the first problem.

It appears that the MSVC debugger is checking to make sure variables are set before used as an argument to a function. (Cool feature.  I didn't know it did that.)  It looks like I violated that.  I am pretty sure this is benign; the state that leads to uninitialized variables should mean they won't be used in the function.  It's still bad and dangerous practice though, so thanks for pointing it out.

Attached is a patch that should fix the problem.  Please apply it to reduce.c and let me know if it resolves the problem.

Message-ID: <9D5D5269C4FD6E4D8FF13B6A51162558151D3E5BFE@NIHMLBX05.nih.gov>

How do I get the X thing to display on a remote machine, when I am using openmesa???

First, my configuration: a 2-machine "cluster" with a total of 3 quad-cores, running ubuntu natty narwhal. head node IP:a.b.c.d (all 64-bit machines)
My remote machine: win-xp laptop with IP add: a.b.e.f (32-bit machine)
MPICH1 up and running.  I cannot use MPICH2 since the tomographic reconstruction package that I have only works under MPICH1.  The recon
works fine and dandy within the cluster (so MPI is running, the cluster machines are happy with each other, and I can get in with my remote machine from home and chat with them nice-and-easy).

Now, the paraview bit:
I downloaded paraview source and did a manual install as per paraview.org notes to allow for MPI.  I included OpenMesa in the configuration and the paraview installed fine.  I can start up pvserver using mpi and start up paraview on the head node and that works.

However, my problem is when I am trying to use my laptop in conjunction with the cluster.  I have a win32 binary installation of paraview on my laptop.
Well I start up the server on the cluster using:
mpirun -np 4 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
and it says waiting for client and Connection URL: cs://localhost:11111

I start up the laptop paraview and ask it to use the server at a.b.c.d.
The server on the cluster gives an error message:
ERROR: In  <dirpath>/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, line 823
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x185ecd0): Tag mismatch: got 8843, expecting 99991.

It is weird that I downloaded paraview3.10.1 for both win32 and linux x86-64, but the paraview version that opens up on my linux box says it is 3.11.1
I am wondering if this is a problem?  I got both softwares from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html#latest....

I can provide more details on what all I have tried  (basically all the stuff that google has thrown up from various paraview-related websites) w/o any luck.

Berk,
I was able to get this procedure to work.  However is there a way to save out the x3d or even a vrml that contains an animated geometry ie an animated (transient) isosurface?
 
Also I found an interesting tool call pdf3d its at www.pdf3d.com 
 
They have a plugin for paraview that will write it straight to a pdf that you can import into a powerpoint using the free LiveWeb plugin skp.mvps.org/liveweb.html ( http://www.skp.mvps.org/liveweb.html )
 
Thanks,
Terry

Related to the latter case (3D scene with static content), I had good
luck with converting an X3D scene exported from ParaView into U3D
using Meshlab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) and then embedding U3D
into a PDF document. Something similar should be doable with
Powerpoint I'd think.

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and
unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Hi,

Currently the client and server versions have to exactly match for a
connection to be made. If you built ParaView from source you need to check
out the release branch in git instead of master which is the current
development version ( 3.11.1 ).

Hi,

Is it possible for a widget representation to get any more information about
the input dataset other than the bounds that are given via the call to
PlaceWidget?  I would ideally like access to the input dataset....

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Colormaps when rendering 2 volumes
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=0LDt6toAK1ysxd0J32z6ZAG-hXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I fairly recently found Paraview, and it's capabilities are truly excellent
... the only package I've found that can handle some of my more complicated
visualization tasks.

I do have a question though. I'm running into a problem trying to display 2
(or more) volumes. The color maps seem to get automatically linked: that is,
setting the colormap on one volume automatically changes the map on the
other volume. Am I missing something obvious? Is there a workaround? Or is
this a known limitation? From reading the archives, volume rendering seems a
little less mature than the other rendering options, so maybe it's a
limitation? Conceptually, I'm trying to put a colorized volume inside
another (partially transparent, grayscale) volume ...

If It matters, I'm on ParaView 3.10.1 64-bit, win7 and my volumes are being
read in as NiftiImages.

-best
Gary

The contour filter doesn't pass the input scalars by default. Make
sure that "Compute Scalars" checkbox is checked.

Subject: [Paraview] Export VRML files for meshlab to check
Message-ID: <BANLkTimwKLqH0Bf06+omvku_Wr=QOXyBtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am required to export VRML objects from ParaView using Python
scripts. I followed the examples at

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-June/017989.html

to complete the script, and outputted a .vrml file. I need to use
meshlab to check the file; it seems that meshlab can only recognise
.wrl extension, and thus I modified the .vrml file into .wrl. When
meshlab loaded the file, there is an error saying

"Error details: File without a geometry"

I searched and am not sure about how to fix the error and load the
file. Do you have any experiences on exporting VRML files and give a
hint please?

Many thanks,

Hi Sebastien,

Thanks a lot. Does that mean I have to build ParaView from the latest
git source? When should the binaries of this fixed version come to be
released if I don't build by myself?

Thanks.

I can not remember but it might be also in the 3.10.1 release. But
otherwise, yes if you pick the git/master version you will have to
compile it yourself.

If you have the git history, look for a fix from Utkarsh about exporter.

Hi Seb,

I confirm the paraview I am using is 3.10.1 64 bit, downloaded from
the official website. My OS is Ubuntu 10.04.

Thanks

How does one compute the integral of P Normal ds ? 
where Normal is the surface normal vector 

click on integrate variables computes the integral of P ds

One way is to use the calculator filter to multiply the pressure by the
normal to get force per unit area on the cylinder.  Then you can use the
integrate variables filter to get the total force on it.

If you don't have normals on your cylinder, you can use the generate surface
normals filter but that only works for polydata.  The extract surface should
get you from any other data set to the polydata you want.

Subject: [Paraview] FW: Coloured isosurfaces when running MPI
Message-ID: <004001cc2e95$29d4abb0$7d7e0310$@mech.kth.se>

Dear forum,

I am using Paraview to visualise a large dataset coming from a direct
simulation of turbulence (size of the original data of order 10-100GB).
Naturally, I am running in parallel on a cluster (using the mesa), which
also works very well. 

However, there is one issue: I want to visualise isosurfaces of a quantity,
and colour them using another scalar quantity. When running serial,
everything is fine. When using multiple processors with MPI leading to the
data being distributed, the rendering of the isosurfaces is still ok.
However, the colouring seems to be based on the scalar field of the first
data segment (i.e. the first processor) only. This then leads to very
visible boundaries between the processors as the colours are clearly not
correct (see example on
http://www.mech.kth.se/~pschlatt/files/resampled.jpg). Again, running on a
single processor everything is correct, and running on different numbers of
processors will shift the edges.

This issue could be confirmed in all version up to 3.10.

Due to this, I am required to run in serial, which is very painful both due
to memory requirements and very long rendering times (up to 15 minutes for a
single frame). Thus, if there would be a simple fix, I'd be very interested.

Thanks a lot in advance for any hint. 
Best regards,
Philipp Schlatter

I have cell normals (vector) next I do
cell data to point data
extract surface
when I do calculator, the cell normal vector is not in the list. How do 
I get the cell normal vector in the calculator list?
Thanks for your help,

Subject: [Paraview] Running ParaView Server from new ParaView code structure
	(for collaboration)
Message-ID: <BANLkTikwO+T+KZ3tg+dyLzKN3=4G0JZxuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I got the new Paraview source code that is built to enable client-to-client
collaboration from https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/ . I would like to
set up a ParaView server and test if I could connect two ParaView clients to
it.

To do that, do I have to enable PARAVIEW_USE_MPI?

I compiled Open-MPI 1.4.3 <http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/>
from source via CMake out-of-source build.  But when I build ParaView with
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI , I ran into compilation problems in the VTK and IceT
projects. They seem to be related to the inability to find MPI directories.

Alexis

I think the cell normals that you have are generated for visualization and
not really part of your data set that's directly outputted from your
filter.  So when you do cell data to point data you still don't have the
normals in there.

Did you try using the extract surface and generate surface normals filters?

Hi,
my understanding is that when you used CellDataToPointData filter, the cell
data are removed and thus they don't appear in the Calculator. The
CellDataToPointData filter has a "Pass Cell Data" option that will keep the
original data in the pipeline.
However, I didn't understand from where you got your normals: are they
generated from "Generate Surface Normals" filter or outside ParaView? When
you load your data, do you see the CellData array in the information tab of
your data?

Best regards,
Jerome

Hi..

I managed to start pvserver.exe without running MPI.  I am unable to connect
2 clients to a server. Is there some code-fix that I can implement to make
that happen?

Thanks!

The git-master code doesn't support connecting 2-clients. That feature
is under development.

It works now (when I click extract surface, the generate surface normals 
filter becomes active).

You could very easily write a C++ filter to do the same or use the
Python programmable filter. Feel free to add a feature request to the
bug tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug) for this. Should be an easy
enough fix to address for the next release.

John,

Earlier this week I merged a change in ParaView that uses the latest (not yet released) version of IceT.  You have the dubious honor of reporting the first problem.

It appears that the MSVC debugger is checking to make sure variables are set before used as an argument to a function. (Cool feature.  I didn't know it did that.)  It looks like I violated that.  I am pretty sure this is benign; the state that leads to uninitialized variables should mean they won't be used in the function.  It's still bad and dangerous practice though, so thanks for pointing it out.

Attached is a patch that should fix the problem.  Please apply it to reduce.c and let me know if it resolves the problem.

When running in parallel on windows, I get this (frequently)

I just closed the debugger and forgot to copy the stack trace, but can post it if it helps.

Is it a known issue? (I?m using IceT master, head of current git from the paraview repo) ? can I just set piece offset to the process rank?

Line 109 of reduce.c
    if (icetIsEnabled(ICET_COLLECT_IMAGES)) {
        result_image = reduceCollect(composited_image,
                                     compose_tile,
                                     piece_offset);

By the way, did you try exporting X3D instead of VRML? I believe
Meshlab can read X3D and probably convert it to VRML.

That's very peculiar. What datatype are you contouring? (With the
reader selected in the pipeline browser, go to the information tab,
what does the "Type" field say?) Also after generating the
iso-surface, open the statistics inspector (View | Statistics
Inspector). What is the size of the geometry generated from  the
contour filter. If that's not too large, you try doing local-rendering
(go to Edit | Settings, on the Server page, uncheck Remote Render
Threshold). Does that help? This will help diagnose if the issue is
with rendering or with the data generated by the contour filter
itself.

Not easily. But maybe you could create a new widget representation
modeled on the vtkCubeAxesRepresentation that provide the dataset as
the input. Then you'd need custom code to hookup the input, since
ParaView will never give an input to a widget on it's own.

All,

My current EnSight-formatted results file name is 'fmaego.data.case'

Starting with PV version 3.10.1, when I use file>open, I am asked to 
chose between the readers ParaDIS and EnSight.

Can the results file be renamed so that ParaView recognizes that it is 
formatted as EnSight results?

Thanks is advances for the bother.

Message-ID: <BANLkTimaHTPwQG8Sc9b-EOTdz3n36jkkSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi again all,

I solved my linked-colormap problem when rendering multiple volumes (thanks
Utkarsh, using separate variable names worked great!). My next issue is
this: can someone explain when colormap transparency is enabled? In some of
my data views, the opacity option is grayed out (for example, in slice
renderings, and also in points data). I kinda understand the points case,
but I was surprised by slice renderings. I suspect there is an underlying
principle I'm missing here ...

Dear Utkarsh,
Thanks a lot for your answer. The type of my data is "Rectilinear Grid"
(turbulence data on a regular grid). The test case that I use to reproduce
the data leads to a size of the contours (from the statistics inspector)
230316 cells, and a memory of 15 MB. I have turned off all the remote render
thresholds etc. and the problem persists. Thus it is likely that it is the
contour filter that causes the miscolouring. 

I have just reroduced the problem using the latest version 3.10.1 (Linux
32-bit); and I generated a screenshot on
http://www.mech.kth.se/~pschlatt/files/Screenshot.png.

The test is simple; I read in a rectilinear grid with a few velocity
components. Then I compute a new scalar field, essentially being the
x-corrdinate. Then I plot an isocontour, and colour it with the result of
the calculator. I would expect a continuous colour going from blue to red
spread over the whole x extent, however - according to the number of
processors used (in that case 16) - I get a repetitive pattern. By some more
experimenting it becomes clear that for some reason the colouring is done
based on the scalar value on the first processor only.

Running on 1 processor everything is fine.

I am of course happy to provide the respective data files, if this could
help.

Thanks for any help! 
Best regards,
Philipp

That's very peculiar. What datatype are you contouring? (With the reader
selected in the pipeline browser, go to the information tab, what does the
"Type" field say?) Also after generating the iso-surface, open the
statistics inspector (View | Statistics Inspector). What is the size of the
geometry generated from  the contour filter. If that's not too large, you
try doing local-rendering (go to Edit | Settings, on the Server page,
uncheck Remote Render Threshold). Does that help? This will help diagnose if
the issue is with rendering or with the data generated by the contour filter
itself.

Subject: [Paraview] Python builds from source
Message-ID: <BANLkTinzEWDQnhr8nCEAZo8Bn=u6AdfkCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am having to build Python to link against Paraview.  I am on Linux system
and have a number of different OS (by this I mean different versions of
linux kernels) where the clients will be running.

They all come with their own built versions of python(2.5/2.6/2.7) depending
on how up-to-date a particular machine is.  This is causing me lots of pain
as the paraview I build on machine (using my /usr/lib/python) is different
to what may be on other clients :(

I figured it may be best to build my own version of python from source and
point my cmake entries to that directory.  The questions are as follows

1)Is python 2.6 is sufficient for Paraview-3.10.1?

2)Do I need to turn on any specific flags when building?

3)Do I need any other libraries (like the imaging library) for Paraview?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Rakesh.

Hi,

First of all, thanks a lot for your help.

I have tried X3D and meshlab also complained that "Error details: File
without a geometry" for the x3d file.

Please see my piece of code:

servermanager.LoadState(stateFile)
SetActiveView(GetRenderView())

renderView = GetRenderView()
renderView.ViewTime = 1
view = Render()

exporters = servermanager.createModule("exporters")
# export to VRML format
#vrml = exporters.VRMLExporter(View = view, FileName = "foo.wrl")
#vrml.Write()
# export to X3D format
x3d = exporters.X3DExporter(View = view, FileName = "foo.x3d")
x3d.Write()

On the other hand, my boss advised that PV 3.8 worked well with vrml.
Therefore I also tried PV 3.8.1, (since I couldn't find the 3.8 from
the official website). When I executed the same code with PV 3.8.1,
pvpython complained that

vtkVRMLExporter (0x30802d0): no actors found for writing VRML file.

I am really a newbie about this and am not sure how to create actors
attached with the render.

I also attach the vrml and x3d files for your information. I look
forward to your advices. Thanks a lot.

Regards, Wayne

What is the data that you are exporting?  It doesn't seem to have any
cells (i.e. geometry). A set of points maybe?

The data are cells from CFD FVM. I just found that the PV gui could
export files which can then be loaded into meshlab; it implies that
the problem should be related to my python script.

I report the gui way worked with both pv 3.8.1 and 3.10.1, both vrml
and x3d formats.

Hello Cecilia,

I have done a small bit of texture mapping in ParaView, but not on distorted surfaces, and it sounds like you are dealing with a subtle issue that I've never run across.

You will have much more luck joining the ParaView mailing list and posting your questions there. When you post issues to the list they are exposed to so many more people with a wide range of experience. You can sign up at: http://www.paraview.org/mailman/listinfo/paraview

I am also CCing the list, so hopefully someone will have tried something similar.

Good luck,
-Eric

Hello Eric,

I have been looking on the Internet for ways to obtain a scalar-draped topography in Paraview but so far I have not been able to obtain it.  In the many pages I looked, I found that you answered a lot of questions regarding the use of ParaView. I would like to know if you would be able to provide some help with my problem.
We have been able to successfully convert stacks of grd scalar files to vtk format to make a 3d volume (through the procedure described below), and have also successfully converted single grd (topography) files to vtk format.   We have plotted both of these types of files in Paraview successfully, however what we would really like to do is drape a scalar grid (i.e. surface stress) on top of a topography grid in Paraview ? this is where we are having problems.  
 
To convert our stress grid files (.grd files) to a VTK format we use a script obtained from Thorston Becker (http://geodynamics.usc.edu/~becker /software/grd2vtk_README)
We use the grd2vtk_cart script, which assumes that the .grd files are Cartesian and creates a rectilinear vtk grid.   An example of this is attached (model_PVplot.pdf ).

To generate the stress-draped topography view in Paraview, we first convert a topography .grd file to a vtk file using the same procedure above.   This file is displayed accurately in ParaView (using the first 4 steps below), however when we try to drape an ?image? over the topography (i.e., the surface layer of our stress grids), we encounter some distortion problems.    We use the following steps, which we picked up from a handful of comments from other people online:
1.    Load topo .vtk file in ParaView
2.    Filters? Clean to Grid
3.    Filters ? Extract to Surface
4.    Filters ? Warp by Scalar
5.    Filters ? Texture Map to Plane
6.&n bsp;   (outside of Paraview) Create drape image ? make a gmt postscript file of scalar surface (stress map), convert this to a jpg, apply a 90 deg. clockwise rotation and a vertical axis flip (photoshop)
7.    (back in Paraview) Display panel: Apply Texture ? select stress map jpg

Using these rather archaic steps, we do end up with a scalar-draped topography scene, but the draped file is slightly distorted ? it almost looks like a projection issue, where the scalar map is shifted a few km to the NE and the issue gets larger along the southern portions of the scene.   To make sure the projection issue wasn?t creeping in when we made our scalar map in GMT, we generated a map with a simple linear projection (using ?Jx option).  This did not help.

I would like to know if it is possible for you to give me some advice for how to treat the scalar-draped topography issue.   Have you done this, and if so, do you have an alternative method? 

Thank you,

Cecilia

Gray,

Currently ParaView supports changing the opacity in colormaps only for
volume rendering. When rending slice or points as surface or anything
other than volume, opacity will be fixed to single value that can be
set on the Display tab.

On my Ubuntu machine I'm using the default installed python which is version
2.6.6.  I think 2.6 is sufficient.  I don't have any extra flags beyond
turning on PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON.

I confirm that the fix made it into 3.10.1 release as well. So you
should be able to export valid VRML/X3D files from 3.10.1

1) 2.6 is sufficient, but I'd recommend using the latest 2.7 source if
possible
2) a default configure should be fine
3) you might consider building numpy.  It is optional, but paraview can use
it, if available, to provide extra functionality

Hello, I confirm that the problem I have is actually not related to
the bug Seb mentioned.

I have fixed my code for loading the ensight data and export into a
vrml file, by referring to your previous post

http://markmail.org/message/h5ke2nxewvzdcaen

There are two problems I am still confused:

1. when I used meshlab to load the vrml file - it was successful, but
the object shown in meshlab is in solid colour, rather than a contour
of a quantity, such as temperature in the ensight data. Is it possible
to load the temperature as the colour?

2. when I use pvsm file instead of loading the ensight data directly, like

servermanager.LoadState(stateFile)

the function Show() complained "Show() needs a proxy argument or that
an active source is set." I then used GetSources() to check the
sources after loading the state, (because I wanted to set an active
source), GetSources() returned an empty list. I am not sure what is
the reason for this, because when using GUI to load the pvsm file,
everything looks fine.

Many thanks for your advices in advance,
Wayne

Dear All,

In reference to the following feature:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=4885

I'm interested in having the materials database ported to PV3 from PV2, as
it would be a useful feature to have. I'd like to see how far I can get with
it myself intially. Can someone point me in the right direction to get
started? Getting hold of PV2 would be the first port of call, I suppose?

Thanks,

We've moved the VTK and ParaView project bug trackers to their own mantis
server at Kitware. This is part of a new development workflow we are moving
to, in which the bug trackers are integrated into the development cycle. In
particular the projects had to be split off from the rest so that the mantis
interface and bug categories could be customized and streamlined. The new
development cycle will alleviate the longstanding problem of
inactive/ignored bugs and will improve general software quality greatly.

The bug trackers can now be found at: vtk.org/Bug and paraview.org/Bug.

More details about the new development workflow are coming shortly.
Apologies for the lack of advanced warning on the users mailing lists .

Subject: [Paraview] Further questions regarding 4D dataset
Message-ID: <BANLkTik0_b8T8HrUr5QQq5T13aUqdQh2-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
The volume rendering works successfully. Thank you for the assistance.
Further investigations have suggested that Imaris is probably
performing simple maximum intensity projection, but enabling the user
to rotate the volume and producing nice colour combinations. Is there
any MIP facility in paraview?

Thanks

	intermpolator
Message-ID: <20110623.184214.227685190.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I just came across Dave DeMarle's ParaView course slides presented
at the 6th OpenFOAM Workshop.
http://www.openfoamworkshop.org/6th_OpenFOAM_Workshop_2011/Program/Training/deMarle_slides.pdf

In the 11th slide (Temporal Processing) I see that the "Interpolation
between time steps" is grayed out, which I suspect was done so because
the temporal interpolator did not interpolate the OpenFOAM dataset
(which made path lines unpractical as well).  This is a known
problem that has fixes involving both the OpenFOAM reader and the
temporal interpolator. The fix to the former (which I backported from
my own development version) is attached in this mail and the latter
has already been filed as a bug with a patch:
http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=12151

Thanks,
Takuya

Hi Takuya,

Out of curiosity, why would the lack of temporal interpolator make
path lines impractical? The particle tracer does its own interpolation
between timesteps.

Folks,

If you were delaying reading the wiki pages until the transition to
the new git workflow, it's now that time :). The transition has
happened. The continuous dashboard will be updated to track "next"
soon. The ParaView/Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh has been updated
to include new alias and remotes for PVVTK as well, so you may want to
re-run that script.

Updated set of instructions are available at (thanks to Brad King):

Happy git-ing!

Hi,

Is it possible to "make install" with the Superbuild?  I set the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX but "make install" doesn't work and the packages are
all in a PACKAGE-prefix directory in the build directory.  Am I doing
something wrong?

Thanks,

Hi Paul,

The superbuild is something new I wrote to help produce our binaries
available for download on the website. It wouldn't be hard to propagate
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX into each of the dependencies. I will make a bug for
myself to add this functionality.

Really? Particle tracer never works for me without temporal
interpolator (I only get a polygonal mesh with 0 cells/points). How do
you make the interpolation work and how do you specify the timestep
interval?

Hmm. I believe that it uses the timesteps that are in the file and
interpolate in between for RK (2nd order I think) integration. This
should be no different than linearly interpolating between timesteps
accuracy-wise. Do you have an example dataset that I can play with?
The particle tracker's interface is a bit finicky and we have plans to
fix it.

Hello everybody,
I want to ask you a question about ParaviewWeb.
When we use the JavaApplet Renderer, is there anyway to reduce the  
image size while interacting like with JavaScriptRenderer(  
renderer.interactiveRatio=2) ?
Thank you in advance.
Have a nice day!

I just compiled it but am unable to load a CGNS file - and CGNS is not included in the list of supported file formats - so I suppose I missed something in the configuration but did not see anything related to CGNS, please tell me which option has to be toggled.

Hi Fred,

You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the
SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt
bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.

The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS
built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable
VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

Sebastien is on vacation this week. He will be able to back to you in
more detail, but if I am not mistaken, the Java renderer should
already handle the image size reduction when interacting,
automatically.

Hello,

I am trying to figure out how to stop pvserver process from running (while running ParaView) as it is very CPU intensive and can slow down my notebook considerably. I only need to use ParaView for scientific data visualisation of OpenFOAM and other CFD. Is there anyway of shutting it down without causing ParaView to shutdown as well?

Many thanks,
Max

Subject: [Paraview] help with PYTHONPATH and Medical3.py
Message-ID: <02136b6aa213f6c158c5da85841673f7.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

New python/paraview user.

I built paraview 3.10.1 on CentOS release 5.5 with python scripting enabled.
I can run the
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/demos/demo1.py
script successfully.

I am trying to get the Medical3.py script from paraview-3.4.0 working
http://paraview.sourcearchive.com/documentation/3.4.0/dir_516104d7fcb54d09cbed28399f9d6e1a.html
Is that script too old or can I get it to work in paraview 3.10 ?

To get past various error messages I tried changing my PYTHONPATH
to include various combinations of
/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/bin
/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages
/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview
/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/VTK/Wrapping/Python
/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/VTK/Wrapping/Python/vtk

got by a number of errors, but latest error, displayed in python shell is
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 11, in ?
  File
"/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/VTK/Wrapping/Python/vtk/util/misc.py",
line 13, in vtkGetDataRoot
    for i in range(0, len(sys.argv)):
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'argv'

How should I set PYTHONPATH to run Medical3.py ?

What is the difference between
/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/VTK/Wrapping/Python/vtk
and
/usr/local/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/vtk

thank you
Kate

Subject: [Paraview] Colormap opacity / transparency
Message-ID: <BANLkTinKDMNPsthN-71Pq2+OVhxT1YH6=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Utkarsh,

Half-progress. So, I can display a variable-transparency volume rendering
(in this case of a head MRI, set so that the 0s around the head are
transparent). I can then add a .vtk surface, and I can sorta see "both"
datasets when opacity on the surface is set to 1.00 ... the grayscale volume
peeks through at various points of the overlying (colorized) surface. I'd
like to be able to see more of the underlying volume, so I reduce the
opacity value for the surface. However, for any opacity value < 1.00,
paraview renders only the /back/ side of the surface (the part of the
surface on the other side of the head from the camera viewpoint) ... the
foreground portion disappears completely. After playing around with
translations, I'd guess that for opacity<1.00 the volume is entirely
rendered last, overwriting what should be foreground surface pixels. Does
that make any sense? Perhaps I need to show a picture ...

-best
Gary


Gray,

Currently ParaView supports changing the opacity in colormaps only for
volume rendering. When rending slice or points as surface or anything
other than volume, opacity will be fixed to single value that can be
set on the Display tab.

SuperBuild process? What is it?Tried the second way but was unable to build the cgns library, there is something in cmake which I can't understand: I put the hdf library name in the appropriate line but no generated Makefile contains the string "hdf", so obviously no hdf token is found at link time. configure is great!

Si I finally did it, skipping cmake to build cgns library, toggled options as written below and finally... still not abe to read any cgns file!I mean, same issue as before, ie if I select a cgns file, I am asked about which type of reader I want to use but no cgns reader in the list!

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.


The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Subject: [Paraview] readers with the parallel server
Message-ID: <BANLkTimPcb5MQjyu4pKWJBT3qFyBgBtMTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've just noticed that some of my readers aren't working in parallel.  These
are readers that I didn't intend to have parallel reading capabilities but I
did want just one process to read it in so the results that are returned are
correct.  I *thought* I could do this by adding the following to
RequestInformation:

    vtkInformation* info = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
    info->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
1);
    return 1;

...but it seems I was wrong!

Is there a way to have a standard reader just reading in to one process or
do I need to handle it all by checking the rank and number of processes?

Thanks,
Paul

Ah! Now you are getting into murky waters :). Volume rendering
together with translucent geometry is difficult thing to do with
OpenGL. You need a full fledged ray-tracer for that to work correctly.
You are correct, in VTK/ParaView, the geometries are rendered
(including translucent geometry) before volume. Since translucent
geometry does not affect Z-buffer as opaque geometry (what's the depth
for a translucent pixel, really?), the volume mapper cannot correctly
determine when to stop the ray tracing and hence the issues.

Message-ID: <4E08B41D.7010906@cea.fr>

Hi,

When using 'Save Screenshot' from the GUI, it is possible to choose 
between left and right eye in stereo mode. When doing this with Python 
Trace, the choice does appear in the trace, resulting in a script 
producing identical images, obviously with no stereo effect.

Does this mean that stereo image output of type "Crystal Eyes" is not 
possible using Python scripting ?

Thanks for the help. Regards, Vincent

Hi Vincent,

Unfortunately python trace does not capture all the screenshot parameters.
However, if you modify your python script you can accomplish this by setting
the view.StereoType property before the call to WriteImage().

Try:

view.StereoType = "Left"
WriteImage("left.png")
view.StereoType = "Right"
WriteImage("right.png")


Also, does your python trace script already contain the code to enable
stereo rendering?

view.StereoRender = 1

Pat

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel MB reader
Message-ID: <0BA83A8197CF40A8A8F32BEF794F1528@win.ara>


I've run into an issue when writing a parallel reader for partitioned files
containing multi-block data. All data reads in fine on each process and
works as expected, except for one thing. Since each partition only knows
about the blocks it contains (and not the global blocks), I've not been able
to have all the blocks available in the entire data-set available to the
user. What I get instead is the list of blocks read in by the last data
reader. I've got a couple of ideas to resolve this issue.

(1) Have some sort of communication between each of the PV processes to
ascertain which process has which data

(2) Have the number of blocks stored on each process the same as the global
number of blocks, but just allocate data to the blocks that each
partition/process has data of.

So, my questions are:

(1) Is item (1) possible and, if so, what class(es) should I be looking at
to do it

(2) Will item (2) alone solve my issue, or will I run into problems whereby
if block 0 has 50% of its data on partition 0 and the rest on partition 1
that, after reading in, I will only ever see 50% of block 0 being whichever
of partition 0 or 1 is read in last.

Thanks again,

Adriano

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.




The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

I just compiled it but am unable to load a CGNS file - and CGNS is not included in the list of supported file formats - so I suppose I missed something in the configuration but did not see anything related to CGNS, please tell me which option has to be toggled.

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Message-ID: <BANLkTindVRev3R8MNptdeBkuooOTCSDShw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a reader that produces a multiblock dataset and
want to add a GUI plug-in that applies the extract block filter
just changing the index to have all blocks (one level deep) extracted in
different objects.
I think about a loop calling the createfilter method of the builder with
"extractblock".
do you know how to get the number of blocks and how to set the index of the
block i want to extract without using the GUI?

thanks!!

Hi Fred, The basic way to use the superbuild is when you initially run
CMake, set paraview-source/SuperBuild as your source tree instead of the
root of the source tree. Note that I wrote it simply for generating release
binaries so it's not as robust or as flexible as I'd like it at the moment.
It builds nearly everything that ParaView needs, not allowing one to turn
some of the components off.

If you need any help let me know.

The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

I just compiled it but am unable to load a CGNS file - and CGNS is not included in the list of supported file formats - so I suppose I missed something in the configuration but did not see anything related to CGNS, please tell me which option has to be toggled.

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Hello,what is the current status of CGNS file support by PV?Thanks in advance for your answer.

Hi Fred, The basic way to use the superbuild is when you initially run CMake, set paraview-source/SuperBuild as your source tree instead of the root of the source tree. Note that I wrote it simply for generating release binaries so it's not as robust or as flexible as I'd like it at the moment. It builds nearly everything that ParaView needs, not allowing one to turn some of the components off.


If you need any help let me know.

If you do make FFMPEG, do you get the same error? Just curious if this
output is purely from FFMPEG or bleeding in from other processes if
you happened to do a parallel build.

'make FFMPEG' in your terminal while in your build tree.

The contour filter only operates on point scalars. If you have cell based
properties you will need to use a cell data to point data filter first.

If I understand you correctly I think you need to do 2.  Each process should
have the same multiblock structure and will just not contain a data set for
the leaves that are assigned to a different process.  Check out

Right, I did not pay attention to this since it does not appear whether data are attached to points or cells, I needed to load IntegrateVariables to see it.Thx.

The contour filter only operates on point scalars. If you have cell based properties you will need to use a cell data to point data filter first.

The information tab shows if a data array is point or cell. Point data
arrays have a point icon, while the cell data arrays have a cube icon.

Message-ID: <00bf01cc35ab$12a5fe90$37f1fbb0$@mech.kth.se>

Dear all,
Unfortunately, I am still struggling with running MPI and producing coloured
isosurfaces. A screenshot exemplifying the problem can be found at
http://www.mech.kth.se/~pschlatt/files/Screenshot.png; note that the colour
scheme based on the x-coordinate is just to show the problem, but in reality
I am using some scalar data coming from file.

Anyway, I wanted to ask you whether any of you has had similar problems,
i.e. colouring isosurfaces when running MPI. It seems to me that the data
field used to colour the surfaces is only created on one MPI rank and then
used by all other ranks, instead of computed for each rank independently
based on the local data. Can anyone confirm that behaviour?

This problem makes it at the moment impossible for me to visualise a certain
very large data set as I need to use MPI to distribute the data due to
memory limitation.

Thanks a lot for any help! 

Philipp

Dear Utkarsh,
Thanks a lot for your answer. The type of my data is "Rectilinear Grid"
(turbulence data on a regular grid). The test case that I use to reproduce
the data leads to a size of the contours (from the statistics inspector)
230316 cells, and a memory of 15 MB. I have turned off all the remote render
thresholds etc. and the problem persists. Thus it is likely that it is the
contour filter that causes the miscolouring. 

I have just reroduced the problem using the latest version 3.10.1 (Linux
32-bit); and I generated a screenshot on
http://www.mech.kth.se/~pschlatt/files/Screenshot.png.

The test is simple; I read in a rectilinear grid with a few velocity
components. Then I compute a new scalar field, essentially being the
x-corrdinate. Then I plot an isocontour, and colour it with the result of
the calculator. I would expect a continuous colour going from blue to red
spread over the whole x extent, however - according to the number of
processors used (in that case 16) - I get a repetitive pattern. By some more
experimenting it becomes clear that for some reason the colouring is done
based on the scalar value on the first processor only.

Running on 1 processor everything is fine.

I am of course happy to provide the respective data files, if this could
help.

Thanks for any help! 
Best regards,
Philipp

That's very peculiar. What datatype are you contouring? (With the reader
selected in the pipeline browser, go to the information tab, what does the
"Type" field say?) Also after generating the iso-surface, open the
statistics inspector (View | Statistics Inspector). What is the size of the
geometry generated from  the contour filter. If that's not too large, you
try doing local-rendering (go to Edit | Settings, on the Server page,
uncheck Remote Render Threshold). Does that help? This will help diagnose if
the issue is with rendering or with the data generated by the contour filter
itself.

I'm not totally sure I understand your question but this thread might be of
use where I was asking about multi block data sets in parallel:

Hi Philipp,

A couple of questions:
* Are you using the distributed 3.10.1 binaries or did you compile PV
3.10.1 from source yourself?
* Can you reproduce the behavior with the sample dataset
Data/RectGrid2.vtk (part of both git://vtk.org/VTKData.git and
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.10/ParaViewData-3.10.1.zip)? That's
also a "Rectilinear Grid". Using the Calculator operation "1 +
coordsX*coordsY" followed by a Contour filter with "Compute Scalars"
checked and 10 auto-chosen values, I got identical results with 1 and 16
cores (using PV 3.10.1 Linux 64-bit binaries and Windows 64-bit
binaries, relying on Auto-MPI ("Settings" - "Use Multi-Core") for the 16
core case)

If I understand you correctly I think you need to do 2.  Each process should
have the same multiblock structure and will just not contain a data set for
the leaves that are assigned to a different process.  Check out

if block 0 has 50% of its data on partition 0 and the rest on partition 1

Paul,
 
That's exactly what I was after and what Andy suggested. My serial reader
had an implicit assumption of the multiblock data structure to keep it
flexible. However, in parallel it meant that the data structure was never
the same on each process, as each mesh partition only knows about a small
number of the total blocks available in the serial mesh.
 
Thanks for the info!

Hi,

I'd like to generate path lines on a time series of image data. The 
various things I've tried have ended either with an empty output or in a 
crash. It may be that I'm not setting things just right in my reader, so 
I've converted the time series to vti/pvd format (attached), and still 
no luck although it's less quick to crash.

How should I set up the pipeline to generate path lines for a time aware 
reader that generates image data?

You can get access to the composite dataset information using the data
information (vtkPVDataInformation::GetCompositeDataInformation()). To
find the number of blocks 1 level deep, simply do:

dataInfo->GetCompositeDataInformation()->GetNumberOfChildren().

Determining the index for each of those children can be a little
tricky. The index of a node is the position of that node in a
pre-order traversal of that tree. So you the index of root is 0, while
that of it's first child is 1. However for the second child you have
to count the number of nodes in the entire subtree from Child0 and
then and that to the index of Child0 i.e. ( index of left sibling +
number of nodes in sub-tree rooted at left sibling).

vtkPVCompositeDataInformation itself provides access to the data
information of the child nodes, so using that you can traverse the
entire composite data tree structure. You can also use
vtkPVCompositeDataInformationIterator to traverse the tree.
vtkPVCompositeDataInformationIterator provides a GetFlatIndex() API to
obtain the index for any particular node.

Not sure why colors won't be exported. Are these cell colors or point colors?

That doesn't sound right either, especially since you say the state
loads fine when loaded from client. Can you post the state file?

great thanks Utkarsh,  I now understand how the indexes work there.
but I still don't know how to build my extractblock filter.
I mean to set the "Indices" property of the extractblock filter without
using the GUI.
I know we can get properties from vtkSMProxy::GetProperty
but I don't find a way to set them.

I thank you in advance

Subject: [Paraview] writing a bunch of polyhedrons
Message-ID: <20110629090909.283050@gmx.com>

Hi everyone, 

I have a list of polyhedrons which have arbitrary shape, and I would like to write them all down 
into a single .vtk file. I am using the POLYDATA data set. Right now, my option is:

init global points
init global faces

for all polyhedra:
 ? ?get local points
 ? ?get local faces
 ? ?add local points to global points
 ? ?map+add local faces to global faces

open the file for writing
write the .vtk header for POLYDATA 

for all points:
 ? ?write the points

for all faces:
 ? ?write the polygons

Is it possible to make this more effective? Right now I am duplicating my information when copying/mapping
to global lists. If I want to write into this file without copying the polyhedron data, I will still need
a memory buffer to store the file from the insertion point on, and it would be needed twice for each 
polyhedron:

file::seek up

write the points

file::seek down

write the faces

and at the end, I would need to insert the 

POINTS nPoints dataType

and 

POLYGONS n size

at apropriate places. 

Any advice would be appreciated! :)

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] python shell move data from client to server
Message-ID: <20110629092300.106060@gmx.net>

Hi, 

I want to create a DataObjectGenerator with an unstructered Grid. And when later I want to modify the grid. My try looks as follows:


# create the DataObjectGenerator
DataObjectGenerator1 = DataObjectGenerator()
DataObjectGenerator1.Program ='UG1'

# read some coord from over objects
...

# to manipulate the grid fetch it
mysource = FindSource("DataObjectGenerator1")
output = servermanger.Fetch(mysource)
# clean old data
output.Initialize()

# create some points and  triangle cells
pts = pts.vtkPoints()
...
output.SetPoints(pts)
...
pointIds = vtk.vtkIdList()
...
output.InsertNextCell(5,pointIds)
...
# print the ugrid object
print output
mysource.UpdatePipeline()
Render()

My problem is after i manipulate the ugrid on the client side there, i can't move it to the server side??? Is there a solution to connect the manipulated ugrid at server side with my DataObjectGenerator ?  I know there are the programmable source, but i need data from other objects to manipulate the grid and i want to use my python script as macro.

regards flo

Hi!
Thanks for the answer. Let me give some comments to your questions:
- I am using the distributed 3.10.1 binaries (32 bit), and I tried it on a  
Ubuntu 11.04 system (older dualcore T60p)
- I used now the sample dataset Data/RectGrid2.vtk. Using the calculator  
operation "CoordsX", I can reproduce the behaviour I was originally  
describing. I simply use the Contour filter ("Compute Scalars" did not  
change the behaviour). I have uploaded 3 more screenshots:


http://www.mech.kth.se/~pschlatt/files/Screenshot3.png
is the intended result, obtained using a single core (no Auto-MPI etc.)

http://www.mech.kth.se/~pschlatt/files/Screenshot2.png
is the result obtained with Auto-MPI, running on my two cores.

http://www.mech.kth.se/~pschlatt/files/Screenshot1.png
is the result obtained with explicitly initiating paraview and pvserver  
using a total of 16 MPI ranks.

I tried all/most of the rendering options (LOD etc.), however it did not  
help. Also, I have run on 64 bit version at the computer centre (with  
older versions though), and the same problem appears there too.

I am really puzzled by the fact that you could not reproduce the problem.  
Could there be some setting that is for some reason wrong in my setup?

Best regards,
Philipp

Hi Philipp,

It seems you have hit a bug in the Contour filter occurring with > 1
pvserver process and rectilinear grid input. I can reproduce the issue
you reported as such:

Load ParaView, connect to > 1 pvserver processes
Open Data/RectGrid2.vtk (e.g. from git://vtk.org/VTKData.git)
Calculator filter, operation: "coordsX",
    Result Array Name: "Result", Apply
Contour filter, Contour by "scalars", Compute Normals,
    Isosurface Value 0.5, Apply
Representation "Surface", Color by "Result"

With 1 pvserver process the surface coloring is indeed a single smooth
gradient while with more than 1 pvserver process the gradient starts
anew at half the X range. If applying an additional "Process ID Scalars"
filter, one can confirm that the "reset" happens at a process boundary.

Converting the rectilinear grid to an unstructured grid prior to
applying the contour filter may serve as as a workaround. The filters
"Clean to Grid", "Tetrahedralize" and "Tesselate" all do that trick
(they are listed with increasing memory footprint). So, I recommend
using "Clean to Grid" somewhere before applying the contour filter in
the parallel case.

Karl

Subject: [Paraview] anti aliasing
Message-ID: <BANLkTikdeF42omYVQzQxytAuhb8TgLySJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I would like to use anti-aliasing on my scenes that I create in ParaView and
output as image files. I have included 3D-models (.stl triangulated
surfaces) in the scenes but they look rather poor in certain camera
positions without anti-aliasing. I haven't found out how to activate this in
ParaView though.

Hi,

I don't know how to activate anti-aliasing directly in image file output 
process, but a way to achieve it is to render with an increase 
resolution (let's say double ligns and columns, i.e. x4 on pixel 
numbers) and after to externally resize the image files.

Anti-aliasing done by the resizing process, which can be automated with 
many free softwares, generally produces good results.

Regards, Vincent

Nope, moving data from client to server in the way you describe is not
supported in ParaView. For what you are trying to do, you should
really implement a filter (with multiple inputs, if needed) to do the
data-manipulation on the server-side itself.

Subject: [Paraview] clipped scene with GPU rendering on NVIDIA tesla C1060
Message-ID: <4E0B39E0.5070103@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
This is my configuration(PV v.3.10.1):
Server: desktop with 4 NVIDIA tesla C1060 cards; Client is a laptop.
To make use of GPU rendering, i start an Xserver on a free display like 
so(i cannot use the :0 display, also i cannot use $DISPLAY. if i use the 
$DISPLAY option, the server disconnects as soon as i load data from 
paraview):

startx -- :14

and my .xinitrc contains

exec xdm

so that xdm executes on the Xserver that is started.
once this is done, i simply run

mpirun -np 4 pvserver -display localhost:14.0
OR
pvserver -display localhost:14.0


Everything goes fine, client connects to server etc. But when the actual 
visualization is done, a strip at the top (roughly 1/3 of screen) is 
blanked(see the attached image). A curious thing that i observed was 
that when i change the orientation, rotate the object etc, the LOD actor 
seems to render properly(meaning that i can see the whole picture), but 
after i let it settle then this clipping takes place. Only a few weeks 
back the rendering seemed to have happened perfectly, so i don't know 
why it is suddenly behaving this way now.

Thanks  in advance for the help.

Subject: [Paraview] Merging Coincident Faces
Message-ID: <4E0B3BC6.5090001@gmail.com>

I'm working with an Xdmf dataset in ParaView 3.10.1 that has multiple
unstructured-grid blocks with overlap regions, however doens't seem to
actually have "ghost" cells.  This means when I extract an isosurface, I
wind up with perfectly overlapping faces.

I can use the Clean filter to eliminate coincident points, but but
coincident faces.  As an example, if I use the "Select Cells Through"
option to select 2 triangles on an overlapping border, I get 4 points
(normal for 2 triangles) but 5 cells, with perfect overlap.  The results
from an ASCII VTK File saved to disk:

vtk output
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 4 float
1.37916 0.965356 0.21928
1.37129 0.964077 0.218481
1.37613 0.958331 0.219823
1.36947 0.958944 0.21948
POLYGONS 5 20
3 0 1 2
3 2 1 3
3 0 1 2
3 2 1 3
3 2 1 3

Is there any filter in ParaView capable of fixing this? Or does it have
to be an arduously slow Python script to run in a Programmable Filter?

Subject: [Paraview] VTK File (PolyLines+Arrays) Crashes ParaView 3.10.1 when
	Rotated
Message-ID: <BANLkTimCrM4yJDDtCvEn42TreL4B8Eo6qA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have generated a Legacy VTK file using VTK's Python wrapper. This file
crashes ParaView 3.10.1 (Windows 7) when attempting to rotate it in
ParaView's viewport, however, it seems that I can appropriately apply
filters and such. However, this data did work properly on ParaView 3.8.1.

If anyone can help in inspecting the file for potential bugs, it can be
found here (~55MB):
https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/xythoswfs/webview/_xy-22178502_2

ParaView crashes in vtkQuadricClustering::AddEdges at this line:

points->GetPoint(ptIds[0], pt0);

ptIds is NULL.

The data itself is a PolyData object with PolyLines and arrays. I presume
there may be a bad/missing data structure within the data, can any ParaView
expert shed some light on the issue?

Regards,
Dennis McWherter

Thanks a lot for the help!
Concerning the suggested workaround, I have a follow-up question: How  
would one get the Gouraud shading of the isocontours working? In my case I  
will get properly coloured isocontours, but they seem to have uniform  
shade for each triangle as opposed to an interpolated shade.

Thanks,
philipp

Subject: [Paraview] How to Programatically add Items to drop down list?
Message-ID: <BANLkTin2Xn+r=uri+RdaL7fPhTXGWz339A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am writing a new vtk source and I need to programmatically populate a drop
down list in the object-inspector/Properties from RequestInformation(). Are
there any examples/code snippets that I could look at to help me do this?
I defined the static drop down list this way so far,
<code>
-<IntVectorProperty name="Studies" default_values="1" number_of_elements="1"
command="SetStudyList">

If you use the python programmable filter, you can create it & set the
filter routine (python code) via a python macro on the GUI.  If the data you
are trying to manipulate on the GUI is small, you could encode it in a
string and set it in the body of the python programmable filter.

Hi Pratik,

I have had some similar issues when my desktop screen resolution was 
higher than the server display resolution. Do you know what the display 
resolution is set to on the server side? I was able to check the server 
side resolution using xrandr command. The issue was fixed by increasing 
the server display resolution in the xorg.conf. This could be one 
possibility for what you are seeing.

In-Reply-To: <4E0B23AA.4010206@cea.fr>
Message-ID: <CA30A38F.71BA%kmorel@sandia.gov>

For what it's worth, real-time anti-aliasing rendering has been turned off in ParaView because it wrecks havoc with many of the features involving rendering including picking, parallel rendering, transparency rendering, and tiled large image screen shots.  Like Vincent suggested, if you need a high-quality screen shot, make one that is larger than you need (ParaView can generate arbitrarily large screen shots) and then shrink it to the size you want using an appropriate smoothing filter (most simple image viewing programs have this feature).  If the aliasing is really bothering you while you are using ParaView, get a larger display and sit farther back. ;)

Subject: Re: [Paraview] anti aliasing

Hi,

I don't know how to activate anti-aliasing directly in image file output process, but a way to achieve it is to render with an increase resolution (let's say double ligns and columns, i.e. x4 on pixel numbers) and after to externally resize the image files.

Anti-aliasing done by the resizing process, which can be automated with many free softwares, generally produces good results.

Regards, Vincent

Le 29/06/2011 14:55, Mattias Chevalier a ?crit :
Hello,
I would like to use anti-aliasing on my scenes that I create in ParaView and output as image files. I have included 3D-models (.stl triangulated surfaces) in the scenes but they look rather poor in certain camera positions without anti-aliasing. I haven't found out how to activate this in ParaView though.

I think I have seen something like this.  Make sure that a different version of qt isn't found earlier in your path or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This includes installs of other applications...

Hope that helps,

Bastian,

Make install should work. If you can elaborate on the issues you are
having, we can track it down. Also note everyone has different
expectations with "make install", some want the 3rd party dependencies
such as Qt, installed, others don't. It starts getting confusing
pretty quickly. So, if I am not mistaken, the default "make install"
doesn't make any attempts to install libraries not built by ParaView
itself. However it provides mechanisms to import additional cmake
files with custom rules to install any dependencies.

Message-ID: <82A6681F0CAFC84287B0E2664CE9682C013C34A4@GLKMS2114.GREENLNK.NET>

I found this thread from about a year ago... I'm keen to find out if
there was any progress on it.
 
The problem is that on image-to-image type filters where the extent of
the output is greater than the extent of the input, the output image is
cropped.
 
For example, if I have an input of extent [0 60 0 360 0 0] and an output
of extent [0 90 0 60 0 0] the output will be cropped to [0 60 0 60 0 0].
The output extent is unchanged; only the visualization in ParaView is
cropped.
 
I am using ParaView 3.10.1
 
Thanks,
 
Michael

Which filter is exhibiting this issue?

One potential source for such behavior could be that the filter in 
question is not updating the WHOLE_EXTENT key in its RequestInformation 
implementation, and/or not updating UPDATE_EXTENT correctly in its 
REQUEST_DATA implementation. As a result ParView is using the original 
extents. But I'd have to look to verify this hypothesis. If you could 
help me set up the condition I would be willing to take  look.

Subject: [Paraview] Delayed Set of WHOLE_EXTENT
Message-ID: <BANLkTima7QUMmi6xFBC17zvCSBjpOkSHAA@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a safe/proper way to update the WHOLE_EXTENT from a filter without
knowing the extent at the initial call of RequestInformation()? That is, I
may need a way to override such information in subsequent RequestData calls
(if it would be safe to do so).

The basic design to my problem is that the extent information is located
within a drop-down in the GUI loaded by the plugin. That said, I will not
have the extent information until after the user has selected an option from
the drop-down (hypothetically, my second call to RequestData just before
displaying the object).

If it is not possible to resolve this issue in such a manner, is there a
better way to accomplish this task?

Regards,
Dennis McWherter

Hi,

A related thread can be found here:
   http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg02225.html
where I also gave some links to previous threads.

Briefly, the problem is not that simple to solved: ParaView has rules about
how data are organized in order to achieve efficient parallel visualization
for a whole pipeline (ParaView gurus, tell if I am wrong!). You will have to
play with extent translators, as it had been discussed in a related thread.

As it is not a bug, but a normal consequence of the basic purpose of
ParaView, I didn't submit a feature request. I also didn't try the "Extent
translator" hack used in a provided plugin (sorry I cannot remember which
one, but you will find it in the mailing list archives).

Best regards,
Jerome

The short answer is no. No such filter exists in ParaView or VTK.

However, this can be done efficiently (no for loops within Python) if
you have ParaView compiled with a Python that has NumPy. All official
3.10 binaries should have this.

Here is the recipe:

- Load data
- Apply programmable filter with the following to assign unique ids to cells:

output.ShallowCopy(inputs[0].VTKObject)
array = numpy.arange(0, output.GetNumberOfCells(), dtype=numpy.int32)
output.CellData.append(array, 'ids')

- Apply Cell Centers

- Apply Clean to merge duplicate cell centers

- Apply programmable filter (input 0 = reader, input 1 = Clean),
output type: unstructured grid, script:

from paraview import vtk
filter = vtk.vtkExtractSelection()
sel = vtk.vtkSelection()
selNode = vtk.vtkSelectionNode()
selNode.SetFieldType(vtk.vtkSelectionNode.CELL)
selNode.SetContentType(vtk.vtkSelectionNode.INDICES)
selNode.SetSelectionList(inputs[1].PointData['ids'].VTKObject)
selNode.GetSelectionList()
sel.AddNode(selNode)
filter.SetInput(1, sel)
filter.SetInput(0, inputs[0].VTKObject)
filter.Update()
output.ShallowCopy(filter.GetOutput())

This should produce an unstructured grid of 2D cells that are unique.
Works only in serial. In parallel, you need to reduce the polydata to
1 node using All to N.

I was informed that a feature will be added in the next release to at
option correctly interpret extents at the price of potential
additional IO.

It's very easy to customize the existing vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid to
also merge coincident faces, I did it.

Hi,

 

Does anyone have any idea how to correctly set the
stereo-type to displaying ParaView on LG?s new passive stereo Cinema 3D TV or
monitor, which uses Film Patterned Retarder (FPR) technique?

Thank you,

Subject: [Paraview] Some questions regarding cave mode and tiled screens
Message-ID: <4E0C2164.5080304@in.tum.de>

Hi ,
we have a system with 6 Displays. One pair of displays belongs to one 
node and this node two NVIDIA Quadro Plex 7000 cards. I have written a 
config file(.pvx) for the cave mode. When i try to connect the client 
with the server nodes i always get a warning that the DISPLAY on server 
side is not accessible. Another problem with the cave mode is the 
visualization of some vtk-files, which i can see with the tiled-display 
mode(about 70 MB oil field data). For the tiled display mode i use 
mpirun command with the ":" separation so that i can use both displays. 
Is this approach correct? Is it possible to use data server- render 
server together with the cave mode and tiled display mode? What will be 
the optimal process-setup for data/render server mode for tiled displays.
Regards,
A.Atanasov

Message-ID: <4E0C4EED.4010500@in.tum.de>

Hello ,
i am using Paraview 3.10.1 for a tiled screen system. I have tried to 
visualize some simple sources as cylinder or sphere on the 
tiled-display(3:2). The application starts but when i try to visualize 
the pipeline it blocks. What could be the problem?
PS: i am using the normal mpich2 package of ubuntu for the mpi 
parallelization.

Burlen,
Thanks a lot for that tip! Yes, that indeed was the problem.

I was just wondering....why does the GPU rendering have to depend on the 
monitor at all? Since the GPU cards are doing the processing (at least 
as far as i know)...is there any way in which one can remove this 
monitor dependency altogether?
Also, if it is not possible to do gpu rendering without a monitor, then 
is it impossible to use the gpu's present in a cpu+gpu cluster(with 
headless nodes)?

I also tried xvfb, but it seems that it does not use the graphics cards 
at all, and i got terrible graphics.

Thanks again,
Pratik

Hi,

You will need what kind of interlacing the display is doing. ParaView does
support vertical, horizontal and checkerboard style interlacing.

Hi,

Have you made sure to launch at a single pvserver process for each tile? Are
you getting any error messages on the client machine when you attempt to
render or connect to the server?

Dear All,

I have a requirement for some communication between two or more parallel

can't seem to find anything on how to do this online or in the books. I'm
not experienced in writing code that uses MPI either. Is there any example
code that can get me started?

Thanks,

Hi,

A really simple example of using a parallel communicator inside a filter can
be found in vtkSamplePlaneSource inside Plugins/SLACTools. It uses the
parallel communicator to determine the bounds of the plane across all
processes.

There may be some issue with tile display with pvrenderserver. In
general, I'd recommend using pvserver. For reducing the slowness try
playing with the following settings  in the Edit | Settings dialog
(Render  View | Server Page) (I am assuming, the slowness you are
referring to is during interaction):

* Interactive Subsample Rate: Try increasing this. This will render
smaller images while interacting, thus reducing the load during
interaction. Generally this does the trick.
* Remote Render Threshold: Try unchecking this. For large screens,
smaller datasets, compositing may be the costlier operation. Instead
switch to data-duplication mode, in which call all tiles render the
data locally.
* Still Subsample Rate: Try checking this and experimenting with
setting the smallest value for which you get decent performance. This
controls the subsampling used for non-interactive renders. Generally
you want this to be full resolution, but if performance becomes an
issues, you can tweak this parameter.

Hope that helps.

should I fire a signal after modifying a property?

Without using paraview can you open a display on the server side? If
not I would say that there is an issue with permissions (xhost+) or
display environment.

Another problem with the cave mode is the visualization of some

I will let someone else answer this question. But I would like to
mention that we are working on a related project and as part of that
we are re-factoring some of the cave configuration (adding support for
tracker configuration, devices), stereo computation (better stereo)
and interactions in VR (via wand etc) environment. We already made
some good progress on it.  Once we reach certain level, we will send
the details out to the mailing list.

If you are interested in details, please let  us know.

Thanks,

Hi Pratik,

you do not need a physical monitor on your servers to use gpu. My 
knowledge of X11 is limited, but I think you need to declare a display 
in your xorg config, probably so the windowing system can set up buffers 
and so on(I welcome correction/clarification on this point). As long as 
you have the display resolution on the server set at least as large as 
your client's monitor you should not have the problem you experienced. 
2500x1600 would be a reasonably safe setting.

The short answer to your question is NO. Right now the cave-mode and the
tiled-diplay-mode are sort of mutually-exclusive. At any time you can use
either one but not both. The cave-mode currently only uses the
data-server::client setup but not the data-server::render-server::client
setup. We will keep this requirement in mind for future enhancements to the
cave-mode. Like Aashish mentioned, our current round of funding focuses on
interaction, enhanced stereo and the bringing in ability to plug-in numerous
input (primarily tracked input) into the cave-mode.

I will let someone else answer this question. But I would like to

Yes, this is interesting for me. I have tried to use the stereo under 
windows. Our system has Panasonic 3d screen. Is there a side-by-side 
mode for shutter glasses and how can i use it?

Subject: [Paraview] Numpy error using Paraview 2.10.1 for mac
Message-ID: <20110630142701.7pue4g4xcs4k8gk0@cubmail.cc.columbia.edu>

Hello all,

When I try to use the Python calculator I am getting the following error

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
   File
"/Users/partyd/Kitware/ParaView-3.10/build/ParaView-build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/vtk/dataset_adapter.py", line 5,  
in
<module>
RuntimeError: This module depends on the numpy module. Please makesure  
that it is
installed properly.

As I understand it, the paraview binaries should contain the necessary  
python and numpy
so I can't figure out what the problem is.

Will it be necessary to build paraview myself?

Thanks

Hi Colin,

Can you try redownloading the binary, someone else noticed this as well a
few days ago and I re-upped the binary with the missing numpy modules. If
you still have any issues please let me know.

Thanks!

Alan,

this may be a problem. I have an older qt in $PATH. Launching with a
cleaned path does not change anything. Running "make" and "make install"
with a cleaned path does not really work. How can I estimate further?

Utkarsh,

How can I elaborate on the issue? I am not sure how to go on.
I see the issues with different expectations regarding "make install". I
simply want a clean installation to distribute into our environment.
I tried different things so far. The only working solution I have so far
is to copy the paraview binary from the build-directory into the install
target. I don't think this is a good idea.

Regards Bastian

Could you try one more time, this time do:

cd /path/to/paraview-install
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/paraview-3.10.1 lib/paraview-3.10.1/paraview


And if it still does not work, please post the result of:

cd /path/to/paraview-install
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/paraview-3.10.1 ldd lib/paraview-3.10.1/paraview

And:

nm --demangle lib/lib/paraview-3.10.1/libQtNetwork.so.4 | grep

Subject: [Paraview] Error with python calculator tutorial
Message-ID: <1309490390.2759.42.camel@jregele-desktop>

Hello,

I've searched the web far and wide for an answer to this question, but
can't find it. I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and want to use the python
calculator. I downloaded the paraview-3.10.1 binary and loaded paraview.
When I follow the tutorial, create sphere assign the expression the
value 5 and apply it gives the following error.

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
File
"/usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.10/site-packages/paraview/vtk/dataset_adapter.py", line 5, in <module>
sure that it is installed properly.")
RuntimeError: This module depends on the numpy module. Please makesure
that it is installed properly.


I have python 2.6.5 installed on my computer but my understanding is
that the binary comes with its own set of python. I checked and it looks
like there is python 2.7 in the package directory. It also looks like it
comes with its own version of numpy here

/usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.10/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/


If I delete the python calculator and try it again I get a different
error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
File
"/usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.10/site-packages/paraview/vtk/dataset_adapter.py", line 2, in <module>

It gives the same error after that. The error seems to occur when it
tries to import numpy. 

In a linux terminal window, if I open python 2.6 and "import numpy" it
doesn't give me any problems. If I open the python shell in paraview and
try to import numpy I get the following output:

I've tried several things, but it just doesn't make any sense. Any
ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] trashed screen
Message-ID: <4DE95CF2.3060300@lbl.gov>

Hi

On Longhorn (GPU rendering) visualizing a 2d dataset that has a large 
ratio (w/h) I am seeing that about 5-20% of the width of the view (slice 
or surface representation) is cut off on the right side. This cut off 
area still takes on the background color until the window is resized at 
which point the area becomes trashed (attached screen shot). The size of 
the affected area seems to a be a function of the window aspect ratio.It 
happens at the same spot whether I use 1 process or more.

I have seen this once on my workstation too, but it's less easy to 
reproduce there.

Has anyone seen this, or any ideas about why it happens? I used PV 3.8.0 
on this system before without issues so I assume it's due to some 
interaction introduced since then?
