Thanks Cory, I did not realise that I can do it this way. I have another question regarding representation of properties.
Is there a way to substitute a default property widget with my own widget if I was to create one, say in the plugin xml configuration file ?

Andrzej,

Once you have the property, can't you call

vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SetNumberOfElements(0);

?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi

I want to modify a state of the DoubleVectorProperty object or its widget representation. I know that I can modify its content through vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty object retrieved with pqActiveObjects::instance().activeSource()->getSourceProxy()->GetProperty(...) method but I cannot find a method which would allow me to clear the entire content of it. I figured out that an alternative way to do that would be to retrieve the widget representation of that property which would be pqScalarValueListPropertyWidget and then call setScalars() but I do not know where I can get the object from.

For reasons I won't go into details here, a filter is not the right
place for such actions that put together representation properties. A
filter does only 1 thing: take input data and process it to produce an
output data. Since that's not what you're doing here, the code doesn't
fit inside a filter.

In addition, you may want to build or obtain CMake with SSL support. This
will enable downloading of data files over https and should avoid this kind
of problem in the future.

Hi Anton,


I just stumbled over Your post, which I had not noticed till now. Sorry, for that.
I got a plugin working that draws 3D labels:
https://github.com/romangrothausmann/TextGlyphs3D_PVp

Tries (WIP) to make the labels face the cam are in:
https://github.com/romangrothausmann/TextGlyphs3D_PVp/tree/follow_cam

HTH, let me know if You have any improvements.
Best,
Roman

Hi Amit,

I'm not familiar with the system package of ParaView on your OS, but
usually the Python dependencies are managed within ParaView.

So either you have a conflict between your system python library and the
one embedded inside ParaView,
or if that package is properly managed by the system, that mean you are
missing some python library.

For the later use case, I've attached what are required by ParaViewWeb to
work.

Thanks Sebastien

I was using autobahn 0.12.1 that was automatically installed using pip. I guess they removed RouterSession to somewhere else. Installation of autobahn==0.8.13 started the webserver and I was able to see pvweb home page at local:8080

Thanks once again.

Regards

Amit

Cool glad that worked...

Autobahn evolved to use crossbar.io, but we are not ready yet for moving to
crossbar.io on the server side hence the 'old' version.

Subject: [Paraview] Using Paraview for modeling orbital motion of many
 objects/database connectivity?
Message-ID: <B35AD61F-BF9C-494B-A366-7CD2304D6DBF@email.arizona.edu>

Hi folks -

Forgive me if this question is entirely out of scope of Paraview?s capabilities, but I?m new to the software, and still learning what it can and cannot do.  I have a rather large scale project that I have been asked to look into the feasibility of.  It involves a simulation of the display of a multitude of satellite ?and other? objects orbiting the Earth, with the correct orbital motions, and in an animated display, no less.  Due to the number of objects, I have the idea in mind that a database of some sort is the best way to store the information of the objects, and have whatever is driving the simulation call on that database.  I have no idea if Paraview could be - or has been - used with a database.  Is this at all do-able with Paraview?  And if not, what do you think I ought to be considering, for something of this scope?

Thanks much,

Cynthia

Hi Cynthia,

It's not something ParaView supports without any modifications, but it is not impossible. VTK, the toolkit ParaView is built upon, provides ways to populate tables from SQL database queries and also ways to turn those tables into polygonal datasets that can be rendered. It would take a small amount of programming to connect those two together into a ParaView pipeline object.

Depending on what's in the database, it would probably also require some filters to turn the satellite ephemera into a time-series of point coordinates for animations. I'm less certain about how much work that would be; I'm not familiar enough with orbital mechanics to know how much work that is.

	Hope that helps,
	David

I've also pulled data from a database using a ProgrammableSource and connecting to the database with Python and then building the needed VTK structures from there to pass through the pipeline. I don't know about the built-in ways to use data from SQL, I just did it a brute-force way and got my data from the DB into numpy arrays and then used the numpy->VTK tools to go from there.

Cynthia--

If I may backup from David's comments --

If by "database" you mean a simulation results file format that ParaView 
can read and that stores such things satellite position, velocity, size, 
type, nominal orbit altitudes, .... as a function of time, the answer is 
"Yes."

Personally, I use the EnSight format for such data (large deformations 
of 3-D solids, shells, beams,...).  It is well documented format and was 
originated for large datum sets. I can tell you more about it, if you like.

On the other hand, if you already have a database that contains the 
satellite info of interest, David's comments is the place to start.

Attached XML should do the trick. Load this as a plugin and then two
filters will be available ContinuousDilate3D and ContinuousErode3D.

Message-ID: <CAKsPKw=tievgOYv8fN0gzGKE2op_3y0L8ZexbuFf4tmTez1EWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a pvtu file that I can open in 4.4 but not the latest release, i.e.
5. Here's the error I get from PV:

ERROR: In

This is on OSX 10.11.3. Has there been any changes to the pvtu format with
the new release? The vtu file itself opens both in 4.4 and 5.


Thanks,

Alright. Found the culprit! There was an '&' in the filename which
apparently XML does not like.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1328538/how-do-i-escape-ampersands-in-xml

FYI, if for whatever reason you have '&' in your filename, you can replace
it with *"**&#038;" ... *or simply dont use '&' ... Also the same problem
exists in 4.4. I was opening another file by mistake.

If you don't need testing data, you can disable it with:

    -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF

or toggling it in either ccmake or cmake-gui.

Subject: [Paraview] Tuple ordering of 2nd order tensors and changes to
	vtkCellDerivatives
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+ECpiitiMFLtXjB8Cap+0MFOY0FeRugHHQQHbCPmjNHdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wanted to inform everyone that there is some inconsistencies in the way
2nd order tensors are represented in VTK data arrays. The vtkGradientFilter
outputs in C/row-major ordering while the vtkCellDerivatives filter outputs
in Fortran/column-major ordering. There are other inconsistencies to this
as well. Officially, VTK uses C/row-major ordering for tuples. An example
of this is the vtkCell::Derivatives() method (
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCell.html#aff3d8332e9d7d556a9d2e9f91173d068).


Martin Genet has brought this inconsistency to light with his work on
vtkCellDerivatives in changing this to row-major ordering output. 40e05b6a
is his commit that fixed this issue for the filter, its documentation and
how vector_gradient and strain are computed in the VTK numpy interface. He
additionally removed the vtkTensor which was only used by
vtkCellDerivatives to transpose the 2nd order tensor's output.

There may be other 2nd order tensor ordering inconsistencies in VTK that
should be cleaned up as well and we hope to address those ASAP. The most
difficult of these will likely be in the readers that bring in 2nd order
tensors. I would encourage those that are familiar with specific readers to
spend a couple of minutes verifying the correct ordering from them.

I'll be adding in notes about this fix to
Documentation/Doxygen/ChangesVTK-7-1.md shortly.

Best regards,
Andy

ps. A big thanks to Martin for his fixes and his patience on getting this
through! This is his second and third commit to VTK.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 5.0.0 with Mesa 11.2-git OSMesa /
	off-screen-rendering
Message-ID: <b7c9bcc8-d006-4c10-b1e7-56894f48d7a3@uni-heidelberg.de>

Hello!

I built [1] ParaView 5.0.0 against OSMesa 11.2 from Git 
(11.2.0-0.devel.8.24ea81a.fc24 from Fedora Rawhide [2]), but I am running 
into following problem:

ERROR: In 
/ParaView-v5.0.0-source/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, 
line 587
vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow (0x10dfcb0): GL version 2.1 with the gpu_shader4 
extension is not supported by your graphics driver but is required for the 
new OpenGL rendering backend. Please update your OpenGL driver. If you are 
using Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.
5 or later and make sure your driver in Mesa supports OpenGL 3.2.

This error message does not seem to make sense, because ParaView seems to 
be taking the OSMesaCreateContextAttribs codepath and thus should get a 
context that satisfies both OpenGL version requirements mentioned in the 
error message, judging from a KitWare blog post [3], an earlier post on 
this mailinglist [4] and the corresponding commit to Mesa [5].

Steps to reproduce:

1. Download skull.raw from [6] and place it in $HOME/paraview-samples/
2. Run: git clone --branch 5.0.0-osmesa 
https://github.com/urzds/paraview-docker.git
3. Run: docker build --tag paraview:5.0.0-osmesa paraview-docker
4. Run: docker run -i -p 11111:11111 -v $HOME/paraview-samples/:/mnt/ 
paraview:5.0.0-osmesa
5. Download ParaView 5.0.0 (Linux 64-bit) from [7] and extract it
6. Start the binary ParaView 5.0.0 client you just downloaded
7. Connect to localhost:11111
8. Verify that the connection works: Press left-mouse and drag -> observe 
movement of the coordinate system in the lower left corner
9. Open /mnt/skull.raw
10. In "Properties", set "Data Scalar Type = unsigned char" and "Data 
Extend x,y,z = 0..255", press "Apply"
11. Verify that the file loaded correctly: See a white wireframe box 
appear, press left-mouse and drag -> observe movement of the box
12. Press the "Contour" button
13. In "Properties", press "Apply"
14. Verify that the contour displays properly: See parts of the jaw appear 
in white colour, press left-mouse and drag -> observe movement of the 
displayed contour
15. In "Properties", change the "Value Range" to "50"
16. See the dialogue box: "The server side has disconnected"
17. Have a look at the server output:
```

`GL_EXT_gpu_shader4' unsupported in fragment shader
```

It appears that ParaView indeed takes the OSMesaCreateContextAttribs 
codepath, but is unable to get a context from it. Attached patch, that 
you'll also find in the 5.0.0-osmesa-debug branch of abovementioned GitHub 
repository, makes ParaView output the following:
URZDS: Using OSMesa 11.2
URZDS: OSMesaCreateContextAttribs available
URZDS: Context: (nil)

It would be great if someone could help me debug this and possibly find a 
solution.

Best regards,
Dennis

I suspect OSMesa is not built with gallium/llvm driver and hence it's
failing to give a 3.2 context. I am a little rusty on where to find
info about Fedora packages. Can you check how the osmesa library is
being configured?

Subject: [Paraview] Save data in ensight format using pvpython fails
Message-ID: <1C6B1AE477F51D42B1B0D5ABA31C187D224FD4D6@MB1-2010.ad.liu.se>

Hi,
I have trouble saving data in ensight format using python on windows 7 and Paraview 4.3.1 and 5.0.0 64-bit. This is a simplified version of what I am doing:  start a trace in the Paraview GUI, load ensight file, merge blocks, file > save data as ensight, stop trace.  When doing this in the GUI it works as intended, and data is saved in ensight format. However, when I try to use pvpython and the python file from the trace, I get "No BlockId was found" a couple of thousand times in the output when it is trying to save. The files are created but the file size is zero bytes. My input data is a multi-block dataset on an unstructured grid.

So the strange thing is that everything works when saving through the GUI, but not when using pvpython and the trace from the GUI... Any idea on how to proceed?.

A simplified version of my trace is as follows:
from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()
# create a new 'EnSight Reader'
casefilecase = EnSightReader(CaseFileName='path to ensight case file')
casefilecase.PointArrays = ['Velocity']
# create a new 'Merge Blocks'
mergeBlocks1 = MergeBlocks(Input=casefilecase)
# save data
SaveData('path to save ensight file', proxy=mergeBlocks1)

Message-ID: <1108975880.26391625.1454592285639.JavaMail.root@mail.gatech.edu>

Hi everybody,

I'm about to endeavor on the always fun process of building Paraview on Cray systems, specifically Copper (ERDC), Garnet (ERDC) and Excalibur (ARL). Little is ever easy on these systems and I've never succeeded at building paraview on them in the past. However, we want to run with co-processing on the compute nodes and so it's time to try again. 

I saw there are some build scripts in the ParaviewSuperbuild for Cray systems. Does anybody know of any documentation or examples on how to use them? What dependencies do I need to build using the superbuild and what can I use that is already on the system? For example -- python, HDF5, zlib, etc are all available, but do I need to build my own versions? 

Is it possible to build just Paraview (not using the superbuild) using the system-installed modules? Does the FREEZE_PYTHON option work or help eliminate the issues of running on the compute nodes? 

If anybody has any advice on the best way to go, I would greatly appreciate it. We need to have python, co-processing, and off-screen rendering enabled; otherwise, it's just the standard build options.

Thanks!

Tim

Subject: [Paraview] Warning about Version while Reading File
Message-ID: <HE1PR03MB1083CDDCA5DC82E2675ADF09CCD10@HE1PR03MB1083.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hello Community,


I just installed ParaView 5.0.0 and loaded a vtk-file which worked under ParaView 4.2.0! Doing so I receive the warning 'Reading file version: 4.2 with older reader version 4.0', suggesting that an outdated vtk version is used to read the file. I should mention that changing the header line in the vtk-file from '# vtk DataFile Version 4.2' to '# vtk DataFile Version 4.2' does the trick, however, I don't understand why ParaView complains? I read that ParaView uses it's own vtk version which seems to be 7.1.0 (see below), so why this warning? Is there anything else I can can do to fix that or is this a bug in ParaView? Thanks!


from __future__import print_function

import vtk

print(vtk.vtkVersion.GetVTKSourceVersion())


Best wishes, Thomas

Tim - I've already built ParaView on all of these systems - there are
modules available to load various version of Paraview.    If you need to do
your own builds to support specific functionality - I can provide you the
build scripts we use on those systems.

Hi everybody,

I'm about to endeavor on the always fun process of building Paraview on Cray
systems, specifically Copper (ERDC), Garnet (ERDC) and Excalibur (ARL).
Little is ever easy on these systems and I've never succeeded at building
paraview on them in the past. However, we want to run with co-processing on
the compute nodes and so it's time to try again. 

I saw there are some build scripts in the ParaviewSuperbuild for Cray
systems. Does anybody know of any documentation or examples on how to use
them? What dependencies do I need to build using the superbuild and what can
I use that is already on the system? For example -- python, HDF5, zlib, etc
are all available, but do I need to build my own versions? 

Is it possible to build just Paraview (not using the superbuild) using the
system-installed modules? Does the FREEZE_PYTHON option work or help
eliminate the issues of running on the compute nodes? 

If anybody has any advice on the best way to go, I would greatly appreciate
it. We need to have python, co-processing, and off-screen rendering enabled;
otherwise, it's just the standard build options.

Thanks!

Tim

Thank you, that would be incredible helpful! Do you have a list of what options your builds support? 

It looks like it doesn't have the co-processing or the development files installed during the build that are needed to link our code to paraview. Those are likely the only two additional options we need.

If you don't mind sending me the build scripts, I can get my version with those options built and tested. If it works fine for me, I can send you back the changes needed and you guys can decide if you want to update your build scripts to turn them on by default in the future. The impact of the two options should be minimal -- if it isn't used by somebody, they wouldn't know it was there. 

I don't know what the best way to share the scripts is for you. If they are already buried on the machines somewhere, I can copy them directly.

Thanks again,

Tim

Hi Rick,

Did you build ParaView with PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES enabled? Tim
will need that for using Catalyst if he's going to be using your builds but
not if he's going to do his own.

Tim, some questions on what you need:

   - Do you have a specific compiler and version you want/need to use? Same
   thing for MPI implementation.
   - Do you have a specific version of ParaView that you want to use?

I would recommend using the superbuild tools, to build statically with
Python and Mesa. The other libraries can be built with the superbuild
(definitely use system MPI though) for convenience even though for
Catalyst  you probably won't need many of them. The FREEZE_PYTHON option is
to statically linking the other Python modules into the executable. This is
definitely useful for when running with a high number of MPI ranks since
when loading a module (e.g. paraview.simple) in parallel it can really kill
the file system if thousands of processes are simultaneously trying to load
a bunch of Python modules. Note though that this isn't needed for a
Catalyst Python script since that is done specially where process 0 reads
the file and broadcasts it to all of the other processes.

Cheers,

Andy

Andy, 

We don't really care about the compiler or MPI used for paraview. Our code only supports Intel and GNU, but for simplicity I usually build paraview with GNU so everybody can use it. We usually use the default MPI for a system also, which on copper is cray-mpich/7.1.0 currently. 

When we build our code, we have to specify the Catamount toolchain so everything is statically linked because we haven't really figured out how to update everything to use shared libraries on the compute nodes. When we first set up our build environment, shared libraries wasn't an option. If we go that route, will I need the FREEZE_PYTHON option since shared linking won't be available? 

I suppose the proper answer is that we should update our build environment for shared linking rather than static. It's been on my to-do list to figure out for awhile now, but I haven't been able to write the proper toolchain file for it. 

It appears that on copper at least (haven't checked the others), the system install has the libvtkPVPythonCatalyst* libraries (I misspoke in my previous email) but it does not have the development files from the PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES option. That and PARAVIEW_ENABLE_COPROCESSING are the only options in addition to the standard set of build options we need. 

Tim

OK ? I didn?t realize that this was for Catalyst development work.   We do no currently install the development files ? but I would think that the best chance for success for inclusion of Catalyst would be a customized build using the same exact compilers/mpi as the linking computational code.   I?ll send Tim build examples directly ?.

Subject: [Paraview] how to draw a mesh in preview
Message-ID: <40FD5381-BF59-4EB8-B5DC-2127DA9997B5@gmail.com>

Hi I am new to Paraview

Can you help

I have data in a CSV spreadsheet. 


It contains the xyz point coordinates of a 3D shape (20,000+ nodes). 

The file also contains the triangulation coordinates in 3 separate columns for these nodes (40000 + triangulations). These create the faces of the mesh

I can work out how to plot the points, using 

Filter?Table to points. 


How do I plot the faces?
Do the 3 columns need to be turned into an array?


And how do I colour the faces or contour them by another value (called "bi" in the spreadsheet)



here is an example of the spreadsheet

nn = node number

the 3d coordinates of the points are x, y, z

and the faces of the mesh are specified by (XYZ)

I WISH TO PLOT Points (x, y, x) , draw faces (XYZ) colour by ?bi"



in matlab

it would be


trisurf(Tri,X,Y,Z,C) 


where Tri = array(XYX)

X,Y,Z = (x, y, z)

c= "bi"





nn	x	y	z	X	Y	Z	uni	bi

Hi Tim,

I would recommend the ParaView superbuild script at
Scripts/Sites/Cray-PrgEnv-cross-compile.sh for building PV 5.0.

The options you want to give it are the following:
Cray-PrgEnv-cross-compile.sh <comp> </path/to/cmake>
</temp/download/directory> </install/directory>

Here, comp needs to be the string used to load the program environment,
e.g. "PrgEnv-[gnu/gcc/Gnu] on those machines.

I used this to build a PV 5.0 pre-release version on Cori at NERSC and it
worked just fine. It doesn't have an option to freeze python but after
running that script you can go into the newly created
cross/paraview/src/paraview-build subdirectory and switch it to that.

Another thing is if you're using the Intel compilers you may need to do a
"module load gcc" when building and running your code. Intel's C++11
compilers rely on the GCC header files and libraries for some stuff and
without gcc loaded it will give errors like "missing GLIBC".

Good luck and let us know how it goes!

Best,
Andy

Thomas,

I'm surprised your file didn't cause a complaint in ParaView 4.2. The
legacy VTK file reader in VTK hasn't changed in quite some years. What
software writes your VTK file? If it were written with VTK (perhaps by
way of ParaView), the file version number should be 4.2.

By the way, this shouldn't be a problem other than annoying you with
the warning message.

Cory

Actually, we changed how the ghost levels are handled and had to update the
format accordingly. It may be related to that. Dan would know more.

Hi Thomas,
I am surprised that version 4.2 gets in the file. In our last upgrade to
the file format we increased the version from 3.0 to 4.0.
So format 4.2 is not out yet. I wonder if Paraview writes that.

How did you generate the file?

Thanks,
Dan

I'm really sorry for the confusion: When writing a file using ParaView I obtain 4.0 in the header, but I had a script to generate file from Matlab and for some reason I wrote 4.2 in the header of all my files. This didn't cause any problems with an older version of ParaView 4.2.0, but throws a warning in ParaView 5.0.0. Problem solved and sorry again, that was unnecessary....!


Best, Thomas

Hi Thomas,
I am surprised that version 4.2 gets in the file. In our last upgrade to the file format we increased the version from 3.0 to 4.0.
So format 4.2 is not out yet. I wonder if Paraview writes that.

How did you generate the file?

Thanks,
Dan

Thomas,

I'm surprised your file didn't cause a complaint in ParaView 4.2. The
legacy VTK file reader in VTK hasn't changed in quite some years. What
software writes your VTK file? If it were written with VTK (perhaps by
way of ParaView), the file version number should be 4.2.

By the way, this shouldn't be a problem other than annoying you with
the warning message.

Great that you figure it out.

Indeed the older readers did not care about the version. With the newer
readers we had to check the version to deal properly with ghosts.

Subject: [Paraview] Change the coordinates of a 3D Point
Message-ID: <CAGGY7DrXL16as3vKWh0xhcX+uD4pNBBkph2kP6pjDRNHqpn4dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm trying to change the coordinates of a 3D Point, and then visualize
it. I managed to change the coordinates of the point via:

import vtk.numpy_interface.dataset_adapter as dsa
pointSource1.UpdatePipeline()
rawData = servermanager.Fetch(pointSource1)
data = dsa.WrapDataObject(data)
data.Points[0][0] = 10


This sets the X-coordinate of the first point in the list to 10. Now,
if I open a spreadsheet view, upon updating  the pipeline, I can see
the manually set value in the table. But in the render-view, the point
stays in the same place. This changes, when I try select the point,
which immediately goes to the right place. Once I cancel the
selection, everything goes back to the original configuration. Also in
the information panel, the span along the X-axes doesn't change during
this whole process at all.

Does anyone know what I have to call, in order to make that change effective?

Thanks,
Dinu

Think of fetch and the python shell in general as working on copies of the
data in the client. Changes to the copy won't persist. The way it showed up
in the spreadsheet view is kind of fluke.

Try the python programmable filter which works on the data where it lives
on the server. The output of that filter will reflect the changes.

Sorry if you get this multiple times -- the original was blocked from the PV list because the output log was too big. I can send the log I referred to off-list to anybody who is interested. 

-------------------------------------------------- 

Good morning! 

Thanks Andy and Richard for the advice. 

After banging my head on my keyboard for most of the day yesterday , neither approach worked on Copper. 

For Andy's suggestion of building pv5.0 with the Cray cross compiling script, I got a bunch of errors towards the end. It looks like many things did build, but then those errors about an unknown system kicked in and it seemed to all fall apart. I attached the output log as cray_build_pv5.0.txt 

Richard, I tried your setup as well. I initially was trying to avoid the building CMake step but eventually something in the ParaviewSuperbuild failed because it said it needed CMake 2.8.11 and Copper only has 2.8.10. So, I took a step back and tried to build CMake. When I just do what is in your script -- configure and then make -- the build fails quickly because it says it cannot statically link shared libraries. So I tried to build CMake using the Catamount.cmake toolchain that we use for our application code as well. The initial configuration took over an hour, it sits at 95% for a long time going through the portion where it looks for various headers/features. But eventually it finishes and I tried to build but that failed. I get: 

tgallagh at copper01:~/cmake/build> make 
[ 3%] Built target cmsys 
[ 4%] Built target cmsys_c 
[ 6%] Built target cmzlib 
[ 6%] Building C object Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o 
/u/tgallagh/cmake/cmake/Utilities/cmcurl/lib/strerror.c:32:6: error: #error "strerror_r MUST be either POSIX, glibc or vxworks-style" 
# error "strerror_r MUST be either POSIX, glibc or vxworks-style" 
^ 
make[2]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o] Error 1 
make[1]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/all] Error 2 

So taking a big step backwards here to look at the big picture -- am I (and our lab) just using Cray systems in a fundamentally incorrect way? We've always struggled to get things to build when we never have had issues with SGI/Intel, BlueGene, or IBM machines (even when they were using PowerPC). We used to have all these same issues with our CFD code on Cray as well and the only solution we found was to build all of our codes' libraries statically and drop support for shared libraries. 

I appreciate the help with the scripts. If there's any follow-up advice on what I'm doing wrong in both/either approach, that would be great. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Hello!

Thanks for that hint. I compared the Fedora specs [1] with the KitWare 
recommendations [2]. The main difference (leaving --enable-{glx,dri,egl} 
and related switches aside) seems to be that Fedora builds with 
--enable-osmesa, while KitWare recommends --enable-gallium-osmesa. Both set 
--with-gallium-drivers=swrast and --enable-gallium-llvm, though.

All,

I need to write a routine to find voids in a mesh but I don't understand some simple stuff about points.

I want to take a section of points in a given box - say a range of Theta and range of Y to select the points in the box - I used Find Data but Trace didn't seem to give me the full set of parameters for that

Then I want to sort that subset in order of radius so that I can assign to each node the difference in radius between itself and the next outboard node in the set - the last node gets zero.  Any large values for this variable would identify the voids in the mesh.

The simple things that I don't understand are

1.      How to get that subset - I don't understand the few examples of programmatic selection that I have seen and a further complication is I need this subset to include nodes from all blocks in my MultiBlockDataset

2.      From this subset, how do I find the correct index into the original Points array for each point in my subset, so that I can assign this new variable to the correct nodes.   I'm sure there's something simple like a GlobalNodeID or something but I don't know how to do that.

Anyone got a good example?

Thanks

Dennis

Message-ID: <CA+Y385yfwRPiqFJuM=u9mJV+GQXni=b-Zjvr4pvMG+hYWpJsKA@mail.gmail.com>

How do you map a scalar field onto a surface geometry (STL file) please?

I have a structured 3d array of values such as velocity, density,
temperature etc...
and I want to map that onto a surface geometry, such as a motorbike for
example.

I have tried the "Resample with Dataset" method,  (input=scalar field,
source=surface geometry) but I'm just getting a null field (zeros) for
whichever scalar I then select to display on the surface.

Thanks UFO-CFD

That should work. Is it possible that the physical space of the two geometries do not overlap? Go to the information panel and look at the Bounds for the scalar field and the surface geometry. The bounds should overlap. If they do not, then you can use the Transform filter to move/scale one or both so that they are arranged in the same space.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] mapping scalars onto surface geometry

How do you map a scalar field onto a surface geometry (STL file) please?

I have a structured 3d array of values such as velocity, density, temperature etc...
and I want to map that onto a surface geometry, such as a motorbike for example.

I have tried the "Resample with Dataset" method,  (input=scalar field,  source=surface geometry) but I'm just getting a null field (zeros) for whichever scalar I then select to display on the surface.

Thanks UFO-CFD

Hi

I tried looking for this in the archives but did not find anything relevant.

After importing a distributed mesh from the Exodus II/Nemesis I format
into paraview, how can I ask it to color the elements based on the
file/processor ID that they were read in from?

Thanks

HI Rao,

The Process Id Scalars creates a field that shows the current partitioning
of the grid for pvserver. That may be what you're looking for. If you're
looking for the grid partitioning that was used for the simulation, this
information would need to be communicated in the ExodusII file itself.
Depending on how things are written out, there should be a block ID
available though that you give you this information for certain simulation
outputs.

Please let me know if this isn't what you're looking for and we can try and
see how to get it.

Best,
Andy

Dear Paraview enthusiasts: good day. Using paraview 4.3.1 over a parallel,
forward, shh, tunnel connection, I am unable to use the Chombo reader.
However, over a conventional, local, single processor session I am able to
do so. Is this because a chombo reader has not been installed at the
remotehost? If not, any hints will be appreciated.

Thank you.

My best, Mart?n

(Responding back to the group.)

Well, that's strange. That should work.

I notice that you originally said your scalars are in a structured grid, but the top of your data file says it is an unstructured grid. An unstructured grid can represent anything, so is there a possibility it does not represent the solid geometry you think it does? If you put a slice plane through it, does the slice and the fields on the slice look correct? Does it help if you run the "Clean to Grid" filter on the scalars?

I'm really just guessing at potential problems here. It would help if you could send some example data that exemplifies the problem.

Thanks - yes the data-sets definitely overlap.  The STL surface (blue) is well within the scalar flow field (red).  The scalars (in the flow field) are just imported as a vtk file:

I did not find the Process ID field but coloring by Pedigree Element ID
seems to have the same effect

Rao,

I think you were asking how to get the file ID representing the processor holding the piece in the simulation whereas Andy's instructions tell you the process ID that the parts got loaded into the visualization.

To get the file ID, go to the properties panel for the Exodus reader and find the property labeled "Generate File Id Array." (The easiest way to find it is to type "generate" in the search bar at the top of the properties panel.) Turn on that checkbox and ParaView will generate a field named "FileId". Just color by that field and you are good to go.

Yes, I did indeed interpret the question wrong and Ken probably gave you a
proper answer.

To finish off my question, the Process ID Scalars filter should only be
shown in the GUI if you're running the ParaView server (pvserver) in
parallel. Otherwise it's a very boring filter that just wastes compute
cycles and memory.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Coloring parallel Exodus II meshes by file/Processor ID

HI Rao,

The Process Id Scalars creates a field that shows the current partitioning of the grid for pvserver. That may be what you're looking for. If you're looking for the grid partitioning that was used for the simulation, this information would need to be communicated in the ExodusII file itself. Depending on how things are written out, there should be a block ID available though that you give you this information for certain simulation outputs.

Please let me know if this isn't what you're looking for and we can try and see how to get it.

Best,
Andy

Hi

I tried looking for this in the archives but did not find anything relevant.

After importing a distributed mesh from the Exodus II/Nemesis I format
into paraview, how can I ask it to color the elements based on the
file/processor ID that they were read in from?

Thanks

Giles,

I think I've figured out your problem. The scalars data you sent me is an unstructured grid with "voxel"-type cells. One of my least favorite features of VTK is that there is a distinction between a box in an unstructured grid (called a hexahedra) and a box in a data set with structured grid (called a voxel). These two cells are essentially the same shape, but the order of the points is different.

The reason why I dislike this feature is that it is technically allowable to put voxel cells in an unstructured grid. However, this fouls up lots of filters that don't check for this corner case. Apparently the probe filter, which is the underlying filter for resample with dataset, is one of the filters broken for voxels. (Unless there is something else about this dataset that I am missing.) I submitted a bug about this (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15982).

The most expedient way around this problem is to run the tetrahedralize filter on the scalars. That will convert the voxels to tetrahedra correctly, and the probe filter has no problem on that data type. The interpolation will be slightly different but close. Overall a better solution is to save your data as image data rather than convert it to an unstructured grid. The file will be smaller and the interpolation should happen correctly.

Kenneth, wonderful - that's done the trick (see attached).
A quick and simple solution!

Whats the difference between an image file (and the unstructured data file
that I have created)?

Thanks very much, Giles.

Hi I am new to Paraview

Can you help

I have data in a CSV spreadsheet. 


It contains the xyz point coordinates of a 3D shape (20,000+ nodes). 

The file also contains the triangulation coordinates in 3 separate columns for these nodes (40000 + triangulations). These create the faces of the mesh

I can work out how to plot the points, using 

Filter?Table to points. 


How do I plot the faces?
Do the 3 columns need to be turned into an array?


And how do I colour the faces or contour them by another value (called "bi" in the spreadsheet)



here is an example of the spreadsheet

nn = node number

the 3d coordinates of the points are x, y, z

and the faces of the mesh are specified by (XYZ)

I WISH TO PLOT Points (x, y, x) , draw faces (XYZ) colour by ?bi"



in matlab

it would be


trisurf(Tri,X,Y,Z,C) 


where Tri = array(XYX)

X,Y,Z = (x, y, z)

c= "bi"





nn	x	y	z	X	Y	Z	uni	bi
0	39.527	28.202	160.219	3435	19658	2764	3.86942	0.74871

Hi Mark,


Take a look at test/hkl.lst.fdatss.csv, load it in PV, apply TableToPoints and 
it will create point data of type string for hkl-label and hkl-latex. I guess a 
general way to create string arrays of other array types would be the PV python 
interface.
Best would be to have a drop-down field in the plug-in that allows selecting the 
point data to use and convert it to strings if necessary, however I have not 
found the time to implement that.

Hello again!

I just wanted to report success: I built Mesa 11.2.0-devel-24ea81a myself, 
following the example of the Fedora specfile, but using 
--enable-gallium-osmesa instead of --enable-osmesa [1]. The resulting 
library can run ParaView 5.0.0 in off-screen mode.

I reported the issue to the Fedora maintainers [2] and also to the Gentoo 
maintainers [3], as that package was suffering from the same issue.

Best regards,
Dennis

Hi Tim,

When building CMake on a Cray, you'll want to build using the host system
compilers, i.e. /usr/bin/gcc and /usr/bin/g++, not with the cray compiler
wrappers.  Usually I just do:

module purge
CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ /path/to/cmake_source/bootstrap
--prefix=/path/to/cmake/install --parallel=8
make -j8 install

The resulting CMake binary can then run on either the login nodes or
compute nodes and target anything that CMake supports.  I would also
suggest building CMake from either the latest git master branch or the
current 3.5 release candidate.  I've added a new platform file for the Cray
Linux Environment that knows how to introspect the compiler wrappers,
correctly deal with static / shared, etc, not currently available in the
3.4 release.  You can use it by loading your appropriate PrgEnv module
setting CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=CrayLinuxEnvironment or using a toolchain file
like this:

# The name of the target operating system
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME CrayLinuxEnvironment) # This handles all the oddball
Cray stuff

if(DEFINED ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR})    # Older Cray programming environment
  set(COMP_DIR $ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR})
elseif(DEFINED ENV{CRAYPE_DIR}) # Newer Cray programming environment
  set(COMP_DIR $ENV{CRAYPE_DIR})
else()
  message(FATAL_ERROR "Unable to determine compiler dir")
endif()

# Set the compilers
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER       ${COMP_DIR}/bin/cc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER     ${COMP_DIR}/bin/CC)
set(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/ftn)

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel unfriendly filters?
Message-ID: <CAOmyp+T1xbwga1uuVC9uWnWADAxh9hjbUJC0mV0_UQ5-V-YU9w@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running Paraview in client/server mode with the server running on an
HPC platform across multiple nodes.

My input is a multi-block silo file that contains ghost zone information.
The way I do a seamless contour when visualizing on my workstation is to do
the following:

Load the silo file
    -> Threshold out the ghost zones (threshold filter)
        -> Merge the blocks
            -> Cell data to point data
                -> Contour

This works well enough when on a single machine.  But when visualizing
client/server with the server running across multiple nodes, there appear
seams on the contours.

Is this an expected behavior given my setup?  Are any of the filters that I
listed above (Threshold, Merge Blocks, Cell data to point data, and
Contour) not fully implemented in parallel yet?

nb - I've not spent a lot of time trying to debug the problem, so I don't
know if the problem exists when a server is running on a single node only.
It looks like something that is happening at node boundaries, but I could
be wrong and it could be a per/processor thing.

Thanks.

David,
Why do you need to do 'cell data to point data'? Can you try without that
step?

Have you tried doing the threshold last (after the contour) rather than first? Generally, ParaView relies on ghost zones (cells) to avoid artifacts across process boundaries.

Kenneth:

The ghost zones are the contents of the ghost zones stored from the
calculation. They overlap into the hydro from neighboring processors (the
silo library stores a block per processor the way we're using it in our
code.)  If I leave them in there, I get artifacts.  I'm actually
thresholding out a variable called 'avtGhostZones', which the silo
libraries call the stored ghost zone values.


Dan:

Cell Data to Point Data is the only way I know of to activate the contour
filter for silo files.  The results are stored in cell arrays, which

David,

Yes, I figured that's what you meant by ghost zones. My point is that you can leave these in for the contour operation. Because you have overlapping cells, the processors on each side of the boundary will compute the same data at the boundary.

The trick is to carry avtGhostZones all the way through the calculations. If done correctly, then the surface computed by Contour will have avtGhostZones cell data, and you can strip out the ghost zones in the contour. The only caveat is to be careful with the Cell Data to Point Data filter because the avtGhostZones array will be invalid if converted from cells to points. You can tell the Cell Data to Point Data filter to just pass the cell data.

Kenneth:

The ghost zones are the contents of the ghost zones stored from the calculation. They overlap into the hydro from neighboring processors (the silo library stores a block per processor the way we're using it in our code.)  If I leave them in there, I get artifacts.  I'm actually thresholding out a variable called 'avtGhostZones', which the silo libraries call the stored ghost zone values.

Cell Data to Point Data is the only way I know of to activate the contour filter for silo files.  The results are stored in cell arrays, which apparently don't activate the contour filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Parallel unfriendly filters?

I'm running Paraview in client/server mode with the server running on an HPC platform across multiple nodes.

My input is a multi-block silo file that contains ghost zone information.  The way I do a seamless contour when visualizing on my workstation is to do the following:

Load the silo file
    -> Threshold out the ghost zones (threshold filter)
        -> Merge the blocks
            -> Cell data to point data
                -> Contour

This works well enough when on a single machine.  But when visualizing client/server with the server running across multiple nodes, there appear seams on the contours.

Is this an expected behavior given my setup?  Are any of the filters that I listed above (Threshold, Merge Blocks, Cell data to point data, and Contour) not fully implemented in parallel yet?

nb - I've not spent a lot of time trying to debug the problem, so I don't know if the problem exists when a server is running on a single node only.  It looks like something that is happening at node boundaries, but I could be wrong and it could be a per/processor thing.

I see. I would go with Ken's suggestions, then.  I would also create a new
array called  'vtkGhostType' from 'avtGhostZones'. You could do that
instead of thresholding out the ghost zones. VTK knows about vtkGhostType
name. I think you could leave those in as they should not be rendered.

You can create the new array from avtGhostZone using the Calculator filter.

Hi there,

I'm post-processing a one-sector jet engine turbine and the engine axis is

something between turbine hub and shroud radius. And it's impossible... The

Does somebody observe the same behaviour ? Is there a workaround?

Hello, 

I would like to compute the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a stress tensor using either the python calculator or the tensor glyph filter. However, as far as i understand, i need to have 3D matrices to use these filters but when reading my exodusII file in paraview, i get each stress component as a single variable. Would there be a way to group these variables into a 3D tensor within paraview?

Also, i renamed the stress components to have sxx, sxy, sxz, syx, syy, syz, szx, szy, szz notations but this gave me 3 vectors sx, sy and sz when i opened the exodusII file in paraview instead of one vector s containing all the stress components.   

Thank you for your help,

libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found

apparently ParaView's attempting to load swrast,  a mesa renderer, 
although I have nvidia gpu and drivers. I also tried the OpenGL2 backend 
and encountered the same error. To work around this I manually located 
the nvidia headers and opengl library and forced cmake to use those.

I'm not sure if you want to call this a bug in ParaView or the CMake 
find opengl module. But ParaView should probably correctly detect and 
use nvidia drivers, and ignore mesa drivers, which are likely present on 
every system no matter if third party gpu/driver is installed or not.

Hello

Newbie here, hopefully my question is not too obvious. I have two .e files from two consecutive optimization iterations. I want to show how the results evolve from one iteration to the next with an animation. What I did was to add the two files in the animation and modify the field Opacity from 1 to 0 for the first iteration and from 0 to 1 for the second one during the same time span from 0 to 1. Both with a Ramp interpolation. I would like to see that transition combined. Instead of having a value of 0.5 for both files at time 0.5, I would like to have an overall result of 1. Is it possible to add the Opacities and have that represented in the Animation?

Thanks

I don't seem to be able to access properties in the VRPlugin from a Python source or filter. I can see other Plugins in the Python Shell (if I load the plugin before opening the shell for the first time), but only filter or source plugins. Is this related to the .xml file in some plugin source directories?

I ultimately want to allow a VR CAVE user to select points in 3D space with a tracked device, much like the "Interactive Select Points On" feature in the GUI in 4.4.0 and later. If anybody has suggestions for how to do this, I would be appreciative.

ParaView doesn't provide access all the classes for access in Python
only filters/sources etc. The VR plugin doesn't have any of these are
is primarily implemented using GUI level code and hence you don't have
access to anything from the VR plugin in Python.

A good approach would be to create a new interactor style (by
subclassing  vtkVRInteractorStyle  similar to
vtkVRControlSliceOrientationStyle, vtkVRGrabWorldStyle etc.) to handle
the tracker event to then do the work for picking and showing pick

Due to differences in the OpenGL features available to the VTK OpenGL2
backend (in particular, the deprecation of the feedback render mode),
the GL2PS exporter was not compatible with builds of ParaView that
used the new backend, such as the 5.0 release.

I've recently made some changes to gl2ps and our exporter that allow
vector export to work again, although with reduced functionality. The
new (OpenGL2) GL2PS exporter will only export the following as vector
graphics:
- Charts, etc (anything drawn via the vtkContext2D interface)
- 2D Text (as native text objects or generic path objects; see
vtkGL2PSExporter::TextAsPath)
- 2D MathText (always as path objects)
- 3D Text (always as path objects)

All other rendered objects (including polygonal data previously
exported as vectors by the old backend) will be rasterized to the
image's background.

This should be available in the next paraview release. In the
meantime, builds of ParaView that use the OpenGL VTK backend will
still have the old implementation of the exporter available.

Hope this helps,
Dave

Felix,
Complicated answer to a simple question.  Here goes.

The cylinder slice and clip were added in 4.4.0.  The error you ask about below is in ParaView 4.4.0.  It was fixed for PV 5.0.0.  You may want to upgrade to ParaView 5.0.0.  However, in researching this issue, I did find a few annoying issues, and wrote up bugs.  They are here:  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15985 and  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15984.  Fixes are scheduled for next summer.

Tias,

Sure, there is, and it's easy to find out how. Under the Tools menu,
choose, Start Trace. In the dialog box that appears, click OK. Now
uncheck the Map Scalars checkbox in your pipeline object. Stop the
trace by selecting Stop Trace in the Tools menu.

Doing this for a simple sphere source, the trace gives:

# get active source.
sphere1 = GetActiveSource()

# get active view
renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
# uncomment following to set a specific view size
# renderView1.ViewSize = [684, 597]

# get display properties
sphere1Display = GetDisplayProperties(sphere1, view=renderView1)

# Properties modified on sphere1Display
sphere1Display.MapScalars = 0

This last line gets you what you want.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Cut plane average velocity over time
Message-ID: <f478ba8b5ddb4d199952c52bf31c2415@exdb01.ug.kth.se>

Dear all,

I am working with 3D velocity fields over time. I would like to extract average velocity values at given cut planes. Preferably, I would like to be able to plot the average velocity of this plane over time.

For a single point on the plane I can choose "Select Points On" and then "PlotSelectionOverTime", but I would like to get an average over an entire cut plane (over time).

Does anyone know how to do that?

Thanks for the help,

/David

Subject: [Paraview] Plot on sorted lines with Cell Array
Message-ID: <CAKtnqfkUDKaifw1PuFU41Yq9gmEi2bSawqO2EQtEeSkUiVYOdA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I want to plot a field on cells with the same discretization as my
mesh. So I don't use Plot over line, but Plot on sorted lines with 2
slices to get the polyline to plot data on.

It works well with a field on nodes, but I can't get a result with a
field on cell. Of course if I use Cell data point data, I get a plot,
but with mean values on the nodes.

In Plot on sorted lines properties, if I choose Attribute type Cell
data, I can't see my field on cells in the list of available fields.

To reproduce the issue:
- download the dataset (802K) : http://bourcier.eu/secteur.tgz
- open it
- display the field U2
- apply a slice in Z normal
- apply a slice in Y normal
- apply Plot on sorted lines
- change Attribute type to Cell data: the field U2 is not available.
- apply the filter Cell data to point data (with Pass Cell Data
ticked) before Plot on sorted lines
- in Point Data, U2 is available, but the resulting plot has mean
values on nodes between cells that have not the same value on the left
and on the right. Zoom at the right end of the line to see it.
- in Cell Data, U2 is now also available, but nothing is displayed. I
would have expected to see a stairstep graph.

Have you an idea on how to get this?

Thank you.

Christophe

Remy,

Attached is a programmable filter I wrote to do just this.   It should be fairly obvious, but ask questions if it isn't.

Hi Tim,

There isn't any such functionality that exists directly in PV like this. A
long way of doing this may be:

   - StreamTracer for first set of streamlines
   - Use threshold or cut filter to get last points before they exit the
   domain
   - Use the Transform filter to move these points to the entrance of the
   domain on the other periodic side
   - StreamTracer with Custom source using Transform filter as source to
   continue the streamlines
   - Calculator filter to adjust IntegrationTime and other field values (if
   this is important you'll probably need to do this one streamline at a time).

This may get a bit sloppy and unwieldy but that's the best way I can think
about doing what you want.

If you do this and find a better way, please let us know!

Cheers,

Andy

There is a better way. Build a multi-block structure that creates enough
copies with the appropriate transforms to advance the streamlines as many
periods as you need. Make sure to shallow copy all heavy data structures
such as data arrays. If you are using vtkImageData or vtkRectilinearGrid,
this is easy. If you are using vtkStructuredGrids or vtkUnstructuredGrids,
take a look at vtkPeriodicDataArray and its subclass
vtkAngularPeriodicDataArray. If you need other type of periodicity, you may
need to create a new subclass of vktPeriodicDataArray. Also take a look at
vtkPeriodicFilter that can create such a multi-block dataset.

Best,
-berk

AngularPeriodicFilter (since 4.4) exist that do the job, isn't it?

Yup. For angular periodicity - for things like turbomachinery. If you have
periodicity in one of the axis such as x, y or z, some custom code is
necessary.

Subject: [Paraview] Adding time steps to a data set
Message-ID: <D2E0C659.1142%salazardetro1@llnl.gov>

Hello

I have several exodus files which are snapshots of an optimization history. Each snapshot reflects a design change and how it is gradually being improved and more optimal. I want to make a movie showing this optimization history.

What I have done so far is to add all the files in the pipeline showing the design field, add each file to the Animation View as a frame and play with the Opacity and the time intervals to show the design transitions. This looks alright, but I what I think that would look better is to use a Temporal Interpolator filter. For that I would need to have a time series. I tried modifying the file names and adjust them to the convention filename.e-s.001, filename.e-s.002, etc, but this doesn?t do anything. I think the reason is because the exodus files do not contain anything related to time. Is this correct? How could I add time to my exodus files within paraview?

Thanks
Miguel

Hi Dave,

Yes, that solves the problem, thank you for both the answer and for
coding this stuff!

The exporter helps me generate some kick ass images for scientific
publications using inkscape (SVG + LaTex) directly from the simulation
data.

Best regards,
Tomislav

Subject: [Paraview] Migrating from ParaView 4.0.1 to 5.0.0
Message-ID: <B6899AF31CC24E4BB593B7FFD4C1DE811907E06A@LLE2K10-MBX01.mitll.ad.local>

I just upgraded from ver. 4.0.1 to 5.0.0. I am reading the same data set, a
frame sequence of AVS_UCD files and  I am trying to play a movie.

The playing speed in 5.0.0 is much slower than in 4.0.1, at least two times
slower. I am not using MPI option in either case. What settings should I
look for to speed up the 5.0.0 performance?

Thanks,

Vlad

Subject: [Paraview] EGL build of ParaView
Message-ID: <CADR2tx7a+oJyY=7aTwkL6eHkzFg9QxomzeCZ7ijN859WbHAu2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to make the EGL build of ParaView work, but I am encountering
some issues.

First, here is the configure line I used to build ParaView:

cmake .. \
-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_CATALYST=ON -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON \
-DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON \
-DVTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL2 -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN_EGL=ON \
-DVTK_USE_X=OFF -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF \
-DEGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY=<path_to_libGLdispatch.so.0> \
-DEGL_INCLUDE_DIR=<path_to_EGL_includes> \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_prefix>

Everything then builds and installs correctly.

But when I start a pvserver (with no X server launched) on the server where
the data is stored and with a graphic card. I end up having the following
issue in a ParaView pop-up:

"

OpenGL drivers on the server side don't support

required OpenGL features for basic rendering.

Remote rendering will be disabled.


OpenGL Vendor: NVIDIA Corporation

OpenGL Version: 4.5.0 NVIDIA 358.16

OpenGL Renderer: Tesla K80/PCIe/SSE2
"

And then I tried to use volume rendering, but I end up with this error:
"
Some of the representations in this view require remote rendering which,
however, is not available. Rendering may not work as expected.
"
And VR does not work.

I managed to replicate this issue, with both a Nvidia Tesla K80 and GTX 470
with the 358.16 driver from NVidia on a Ubuntu 14.04.

However, when I add the "--disable-xdisplay-test" option to the pvserver. I
don't get the error regarding to OpenGL drivers and I am able to do remote
rendering on the server side.

I also tried adding the "?egl-device-index=0" instead of
"--disable-xdisplay-test", but I am getting the OpenGL error.

Is there something I missed in my ParaView build ?
I guess I should be able to run the pvserver without the
"--disable-xdisplay-test" option, isn't it ?

Another last question, is the EGL internal rendering resolution available
for modification or will it fit the current view of ParaView ? (e.g. for
doing screenshots)


Thanks in advance for the answers,

Best regards,
Alexandre Ancel

Alexandre,
Can you check

EGL_INCLUDE_DIR
EGL_LIBRARIES

in CMakeCache.txt

and make sure they point to the libraries that come with the NVidia driver.

You will need:
libEGL, libOpenGL and libGLdispatch

On my machine nvidia libraries are inside
/usr/lib32/nvidia-346. (My machine has an older driver that does not
support EGL)

What are whose values?
Thanks,
Dan

Hello Dan,

Regarding to the values of the variables, I have:

//No help, variable specified on the command line.
EGL_INCLUDE_DIR:UNINITIALIZED=/data/software/install/EGL/include

//Path to a library.
EGL_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libEGL.so

//No help, variable specified on the command line.
EGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY:UNINITIALIZED=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLdispatch.so.0

//Path to a library.
EGL_opengl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so

The libraries are OK (They come from the manual installation of the Nvidia
driver which should be at least 355 if I remember well). I have a 358.16.

I didn't previously saw that EGL_INCLUDE_DIR was marked as UNINITIALIZED,
however ParaView was built successfully with the previously mentioned
options.

I am just not sure about the libGLdispatch.so.0 library, as it is not a
symlink to a libGLdispatch.so.358.16.
When I do a "strings libGLdispatch.so.0", I have gl*NV functions, so I
guess it should be ok.

As I said before, remote rendering is working but only when I add
"--disable-xdisplay-test" to the pvserver.

Regards,

Alexandre Ancel

Al this looks fine.

I see. It seems your build works fine but we should have authomatically
pass that option and now show the option in ParaView at all.
When you run through EGL there is no X involved. Opening an X display as
this test does probably screws up things.

You can also try (with this option passed as you have done) to see what is
shown in:
Help, About, Connection Information, OpenGL Renderer.

It is interesting that I have not seen this problem. I tested on a machine
that was already running X. Maybe this made a difference.
I will file a bug report as it makes sense to disable the xdisplay test.

Indeed, when I use an ssh -Y for example with the EGL version of ParaView,
I end up having this error in the pvserver:
"
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://irma-atlas:11111
Accepting connection(s): irma-atlas:11111
Client connected.
ERROR: In
/data/software/src/ParaView/ParaView-v5.0.0-source/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkEGLRenderWindow.cxx,
line 315

client API. See eglBindAPI for more information.

ERROR: In

line 575
vtkEGLRenderWindow (0x2efe490): GLEW could not be initialized.
"
and ParaVIew crashes.
I noticed that at the beginning so now I make sure to have no DISPLAY
variable set.


Regarding to what is shown in:
Help, About, Connection Information, OpenGL Renderer

In the OpenGL Renderer section, I have the reference of the graphic card I
use, either the K80 or GTX 470. So it should be OK.


Additionaly, when I built ParaView, I didn't initially put the
-DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF option, and I ended having errors with
XCreateWindow during the compilation, which seems normal as I used
-DVTK_USE_X=OFF.
Maybe the use of PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=ON should be prevented when using
VTK_USE_X=OFF ? Or if it is already the case, I might have had a mixup in
my configuration.


In any case and if it might help someone else on this list, I wrote some
notes about how to make everything work together:
https://github.com/aancel/admin/wiki/Compile-ParaView-with-EGL-support-on-Ubuntu-14.04


Hope I could have been of some help,
Regards,

Alexandre Ancel

Alexandre,
Thanks for the info.

I filed a bug report on disabling the xdisplay test.

Subject: [Paraview] pv5.0 multi-page tiff in parallel
Message-ID: <5441B291-C603-4D4D-B16D-06F3FD916D63@anl.gov>

Hi,

I?ve been looking at loading tiffs as volumes using pv5.0 and am running into trouble doing this in parallel.

Loading a stack of tiff files as a volume works great, both serially and in parallel.  And I can load a multi-page tiff as a volume using a single pvserver just fine.  But when I run the pvserver in parallel and try to load a multi-page tiff pv crashes while trying to load.  No error messages are given (beyond the usual mpi errors about one of the processes terminating badly).

I?m wondering if anyone else has had success trying to do this?

Thanks
joe

Joe,

Do you have a sample dataset to share? It's possible there's a bug in
the multipage seek code when dealing with sub extents.

Vlad,

Since 4.0 is very old, can you try comparing with 4.4 as well? Let's
see if the slow down relates to changes to the rendering backend in
ParaView 5.0 or not.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about probe point data
Message-ID: <CANO2j4Oxsv+6uGyV0J+0N0A+dz6bt+zGjm--WwWDJ3jwqJXWhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to probe point based data with Paraview.
What I did is:
1) Create probe points with "ProbeLocations"
2) Then use "Resample With Dataset", choose input as the data that I have
already had and source as "ProbeLocations" that I created in the previous
step.

The trouble that i have is:  All field data including coordinates are all
zero.

Could someone help me out?

Thank you very much!

Version 4.4 is just as fast as version 4.0

By contrast, version 5.0 is three to four x slower, at least.

I suspect this is an OPenGL issue. Can you post what the About dialog
in ParaView 5.0 says for OpenGL version?

Just an update.

Kenneth, I think I understand the logic of what you're saying.  I have a
large calculation that I'm working on this week that will require some
visualization.  I'll update this thread with my progress as I get the
chance.

I suspect this is an OPenGL issue. Can you post what the About dialog in 
ParaView 5.0 says for OpenGL version?

Eurographics 2016 Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization
(EGPGV 2016)
=========================================================================
June 6-7, 2016, Groningen, the Netherlands
Co-located with EuroVis 2016
www.egpgv.org



Call for Papers
================

The importance of parallel computing is increasing rapidly with the
ubiquitous availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems.
Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics
and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel
efficient parallel solutions. The aim of this symposium is to foster the
exchange of experiences and knowledge exploiting and defining new trends
in parallel graphics and visualization.

The proceedings of the EGPGV Symposium will be published in the
Eurographics Proceedings Series and in the Eurographics Digital Library.
Best papers from the EGPGV symposium will be invited to submit an
extended journal version to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and
Computer Graphics.

Focusing on parallel computing, the symposium seeks papers on graphics
and visualization techniques, data structures, algorithms, and systems for:

- large-data
- clusters
- (multi-)GPU computing, and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures
- out-of-core
- hybrid distributed and shared memory architectures
- grid and cloud environments

In particular the symposium topics include:

- computationally and data intensive rendering
- scientific visualization (volume rendering, flow and tensor visualization)
- information visualization and visual analytics
- simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation,
collision detection, acoustics)
- mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
- visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing
and exploitation, segmentation)
- scheduling, memory management and data coherence
- large and high resolution displays, virtual environments
- scientific, engineering, and industrial applications



Important Dates
=================

Paper Submission: February 19, 2016

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 5.0.0 with Catalyst: OpenGL2 backend in server,
	not in client
Message-ID: <CADR2tx4+DkLZXVBRF_Y=OExXVB=BnNSMaBZDOLBbCJLyzLqHbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

A word about the context: I am working on a library that uses Catalyst to
do Live visualization with ParaView. In this library, I just create a proxy
to a PVTrivialProducer and then set its output to send the data
(vtkUnstructuredGrid) to ParaView. This part is working very well.

I built the 5.0.0 version of ParaView on our data server with the OpenGL2
backend enabled, but when I built the 5.0.0 version of ParaView on my
client with OS X (I needed the developement headers), I noticed that I
forgot to add the option to enable the new OpenGL backend:
-DVTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL2. So I ended up having version 1.4 for
OpenGL in this version.

When I tried to use our application with Catalyst, everything worked fine,
until I wanted to visualize the data extract from the proxy in the ParaView
interface.
ParaView then crashed with the following error:
"
ERROR: In
/tmp/ParaView-v5.0.0-source/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxy.cxx,
line 310
vtkSISourceProxy (0x4aefb50): Failed to create
vtkPointGaussianRepresentation. Aborting for debugging purposes.

Aborted
"

Looking at the proxy definition in
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/, I see that there is a
proxy for vtkPointGaussianRepresentation in proxies_opengl2.xml, but not in
proxies_opengl1.xml.

Am I getting an expected behavior here due to the option I forgot ?


Note that I also have the standard pre-packaged version of ParaView (with
the OpenGL2 backend and OpenGL v4.1) installed on OS X and I don't get the
previous issue and everything is ok.

In summary and with version 5.0.0 for everything:
ParaView (No OpenGL2) -> pvserver (OpenGL2) : causes a crash
ParaView (OpenGL2) -> pvserver (OpenGL2) : is OK

What do you think about checking the version of the OpenGL backend when
connecting to a pv*server and see if they match ?
And possibly display a message similar to the one displayed, when ParaView
connects to a different version of pvserver (e.g. when a client in 4.4.0 to
a server in 5.0.0)


Best regards,
Alexandre Ancel

Subject: [Paraview] Question about probe point data
Message-ID: <D2E364B0.2CD95%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The "Probe Location" and the "Resample With Dataset" filters actually use the same code underneath the covers. The only difference is how the geometry source is inputted (internally generated points for "Probe Location" and another dataset for "Resample With Dataset"). Also "Probe Location" is marked to by default show the results in a table view. However, you can show the results of "Probe Location" in a 3D view as well. Just select the 3D view and turn on its visibility.

Anyway, the point of all that is that it should be unnecessary for you to run the "Resample With Dataset" filter. You should get the same data from the output of the "Probe Locations" filter.

If all the field data in the output from "Probe Locations" are zero, then there is some reason why the filter could not find field data at the selected points. Once common problem is that the points are not actually located within the volume of your data. If your input data is actually a surface, then this is likely as it is hard to place points exactly on the surface. Another cause for problems that recently came up on the mailing list is issues with using an unstructured grid dataset that has voxel-type cells in it. The thread is captured here: http://markmail.org/message/t5vbs7opn43wtkdw.

Hello,
I am trying to probe point based data with Paraview.
What I did is:
1) Create probe points with "ProbeLocations"
2) Then use "Resample With Dataset", choose input as the data that I have already had and source as "ProbeLocations" that I created in the previous step.

The trouble that i have is:  All field data including coordinates are all zero.

Could someone help me out?

Thank you very much!

Thank you for your help.
1) As you said, it is not necessary to use "Resample With Dataset" filter.
Just "Probe Location" is enough.
2) I figured out why I got all zeros: because the input data I am using is
in .h5part format and they are just points data., no surface, no grid, no
volume.
3) The way to overcome this issue is use Delaunay3D to generate grid. Then
use "Probe Location".
Hope this will help someone who also has similar problems.

Subject: [Paraview] Adding time steps to a data set
Message-ID: <D2E370C4.2CDCD%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Miguel,

As suggested by Sam, ParaView relies on the time code in the Exodus files to determine which time is valid. You can use the file sequence naming convention you state to load a time series of files (to, for example, support a changing mesh). However, each file must have a unique time value or else the reader will discard all but one as duplicates. There is an open bug (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15967) to add an option to ignore the time value in an Exodus file.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Adding time steps to a data set

Miguel,

The ExodusI/ExodusII database has from its beginning supported multiple time steps. However, it is structured with a one-time write of the time=0.0 mesh data, and then successive point, cell and global (aka 'domain') datum sets written time step after time step. If in the optimization, the structure for the mesh has been altered, then the approach you used up to now may be your only answer.

If the mesh structure has stayed the same from optimization step to optimization step and you have saved the optimization changes as point displacements, and if you have access to source coding, you might be able to repeat the optimization steps and write out into a single ExodusI/ExodusII database the sequence of optimization steps as time steps appended to the to the database. I am not in a position to tell you the subroutine calls needed to successively close and open an ExodusI/ExodusII database. You might find that information here:

Hello

I have several exodus files which are snapshots of an optimization history. Each snapshot reflects a design change and how it is gradually being improved and more optimal. I want to make a movie showing this optimization history.

What I have done so far is to add all the files in the pipeline showing the design field, add each file to the Animation View as a frame and play with the Opacity and the time intervals to show the design transitions. This looks alright, but I what I think that would look better is to use a Temporal Interpolator filter. For that I would need to have a time series. I tried modifying the file names and adjust them to the convention filename.e-s.001, filename.e-s.002, etc, but this doesn't do anything. I think the reason is because the exodus files do not contain anything related to time. Is this correct? How could I add time to my exodus files within paraview?

Thanks
Miguel

Subject: [Paraview] Get the name of a dataset
Message-ID: <6F6862A90839CE478D2A3146C2C31B4F5735DC@EMAIL2.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

I wrote a plugin which does some calculations on the scalar values of a data set. I would like to name the new scalars according to the name of the dataset. Is it possible to retrieve the name of the dataset?

With kind regards, Peter

By, name of the dataset, do you mean name shown for the reader in the
pipeline browser? I am afraid there's no easy way of getting that name
from within a filter.

Using Windows 10 64 bit any chemical format (XYZ, PDB or CML) causes a
crash in Paraview 5 (both openmpi or serial versions).
Attached is a screenshot of the error.
Is anyone facing a similar issue?

Hello,

I am working with a CFD free surface code.
I have a .vtu volume solution from which I extract one surface which is my
body and another which is my free surface.
I would like to export both surfaces in one CGNS file.
Do you have any idea how I could do that ?

Thanks in advance,

 Hello,
Even though I am able to obtain some data by first generating grid using
"Delaunay3D" and then adding "Probe Location". But the problem is that
these data that I obtained are questionable.
For example,
The coordinates of probe points is:
-64 0 15 while the coordinate  property (paraview treats all data including
property data like velocity, density and coordinate as field data)
interpolated based on probe location and grids that was generated is:
119 0 945
They are obviously different. I am not sue whether the "probed" value are
values at the probe location computed by interpolation or not?  It seems
that the interpolation is did in a incorrect way and gives me some
questionable data.

Is it possible that I can add probe locations without grids (the probe
would be interpolation purely based on point data) and define my own way of
interpolation, For example I can define kernel based collocation type of
interpolation. Do you think this is possible (feasible) in paraview?

This sounds like a perfect case for a Python Programmable Filter, looping over timesteps, accumulating data, doing the average, and setting it as a new field. Here is a script I have tested on a single block of data with multiple timesteps.

There is an init phase, to get the number of timesteps, their values (from upstream), and the first dataset at the 0-th timestep.
There is an accumulate phase, where the filter pulls all timesteps, adding to the already existing numpy array.
There is a finish phase, where we do the average and assign it to a new field.

I am doing it for Pressure, you'll have to adapt it to your fieldnames and block structures.

Hi,
It seems that it's not possible to get the python_filter_generator.py script from  https://blog.kitware.com/easy-customization-of-the-paraview-python-programmable-filter-property-panel/ (also the code snippets render weird  in the new blog design).
Is there maybe a copy of it in the wiki or in the documentation?
Thank you

Hi Alexandre,

This is a known issue in PV 5.0 in that the server and client must use the
same back-end rendering version. I believe there's a fix on the way to
better inform what the issue is when a user encounters this.

Joe,
It was indeed a bug.

Here's a fix: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1228

Would be great if you get a chance to test it.

Subject: [Paraview] state files: issue with Surface LIC representation,
 cyl slice coordinates are not kept
Message-ID: <CALhrvP86W_BTzsw=HqpN+mebe3EhzJtf-1mvdbrWjgp8B8M+XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have problems with the Surface LIC representation in my state files. I
want to visualize my cuts inside the opaque mesh (opacity 0.3). When the
slice is visualized the representation of the mesh is changed, it shows
holes on the geometry and the surfaces are not opaque. Also the text in the
colorbars look ugly with a black background. With the normal Surface
representation the problem does not occur.

An other issue I have is that the slice coordinate settings are always
reset to the default values when they are in Cylinder mode. This is
irrespective if I use a state file or I just create a new slice.

I am using "ParaView-5.0.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit".

Does any of you have a workaround for these issues?

Thanks,
Bence

Hi Bence,

Could you list the steps to reproduce this in ParaView and perhaps
post a screenshot or two of the problem?

Thanks,
Cory

For some reason I recall this issue as well. My PV build seemed to work
while the installed PV binary crashed. Maybe somehow tied into the new
DomainsChemestryOpenGL2 library that has the new specialized molecular
mappers in it.

Subject: [Paraview] Installing Paraview with OS Mesa for off screen rendering
Message-ID: <CAFtK+eu8U1fH5hNg2x9gBtDbrpDy0NaxArTPaDLVRQyvT7gEHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

  I'm trying to install Paraview-v5.0.0 with OS Mesa for off screen
rendering using cmake. I was following instructions from the wiki. I
installed the mesa libraries first.

#From Paraview wiki
./configure --disable-xvmc --disable-glx --disable-dri
--with-dri-drivers="" --with-gallium-drivers="swrast"
--enable-texture-float --disable-shared-glapi -\
-disable-egl --with-egl-platforms="" --enable-gallium-osmesa
--enable-gallium-llvm=yes --with-llvm-shared-libs

I had issues with "-disable-shared-glapi". Then on
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.science.paraview.user/26440, I saw
that this option was removed. Now it compiles ok.

./configure --disable-xvmc --disable-glx --disable-dri --with-dri-drivers=
--with-gallium-drivers=swrast --enable-texture-float --disable-egl
--with-egl-plat\
forms= --enable-gallium-osmesa --enable-gallium-llvm=yes
--prefix=/storage/home/guv106/Installers/Paraview/mesa-11.1.2 &>
log.configure

Moving on after installing a new cmake with SSL compatibility that finds
the right python etc. , I get this error now when compiling paraview

/usr/lib64/libGL.so.1: undefined reference to `_glapi_tls_Dispatch'

I see that the wiki asks me to use the system libGLU as
-DOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY={MESA_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libGLU.[so|a] \, however,
that library on my system refers to the system libGL instead of the
libOSMesa.so I just installed. How do I get around this? I'm unable to
install libGLU from freedesktop myself because it seem to need GL. Any
ideas? Am I missing some obvious step here? Should I attach my
CMakeCache.txt?

Just set libGLU to empty. If I am not mistaken, it's optional (only
needed for some testing and GMV reader from VisItBridge which you can
disable).

Subject: [Paraview] SWKey: Help with VTK XML-Formatted "Writer" Routine.
Message-ID: <56C4D10B.3030007@bresnan.net>

My simulation software has a functioning VTK XML-formatted, "ascii" 
output routine. To facilitate datum set transfers, I want to add 
arbitrary, m-vertex polyhedral finite elements to the simulation 
software's existing Writer (VTK_POLYHEDRON = 42).

Originally, I used the VTK File Formats Version 4.2 to construct the 
program's Writer. It is not clear to me what the XML structures should 
contain with respect to the polyhedral finite elements.

Three files are attached: (1) *.inp is an input snippet for a polyhedral 
finite element used by the simulation software, (2) *.png is a ParaView 
screenshot display for this polyhedron read in from an EnSight-formatted 
file, and (3) *.vtu is a ParaView 'Save Data' output file for this 
polyhedral finite element.

Referring to the *.vtu file, I am having difficulty relating the 
simulation software's and  EnSight's corresponding input description to 
the ParaView output description, particularly, "connectivity" and "faces."

Do you have any advice on how I should proceed?

Note: The simulation software does not require the polygon faces to be 
planar, nor the polyhedron volume to be convex. The simulation software 
computes proper mean quadrature gradient/divergence operators for 
non-planar facets and a restricted form of polyhedral star-convexity.

Thanks in advance for the indicating how I should continue,

On this wiki page you find information on how polyhedrons are stored in
unstructured XML files (search the page for vtkXMLUnstructuredGrid):
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Polyhedron_Support

Hope it helps.

I still get the same problem despite setting that field to empty. The
problem occurs here

[ 94%] Linking C executable ../../../../bin/icetTests_mpi_opengl
/usr/lib64/libGL.so.1: undefined reference to `_glapi_tls_Dispatch'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [bin/icetTests_mpi_opengl] Error 1
make[1]: ***
[ThirdParty/IceT/vtkicet/tests/CMakeFiles/icetTests_mpi_opengl.dir/all]
Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I guess the compiler is picking up that library on it's own. Any ideas on
what this problem is? The compilation goes all the way to 94% .. in serial
mode though!

Turned off the IceT tests using the boolean option in CMakeCache.txt. Seems
to go through with the compilation. Not sure if this will affect what I use
it for though. I do intend to run it in parallel using python scripting.
Will report back.

By, name of the dataset, do you mean name shown for the reader in the pipeline browser? I am afraid there's no easy way of getting that name from within a filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Failure to run compiled paraview under win10
Message-ID: <6F6862A90839CE478D2A3146C2C31B4F575BEF@EMAIL2.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

I tried to compile different releases of paraview under win10 with exactly the same setting and libraries as with win7 (of course I run CMake separately on each machine). On both windows machines compilation (vs2010, qt8.8.2) ends without errors, but under win10 when starting paraview.exe I get errors relates to vtkpqApplicationComponent.dll. Under win7 paraview starts without any problems.

Any ideas, what might be the issue?

With kind regards, Peter.

Runs great. Thanks. Not sure if this means that IceT tests can't run with
Mesa. The option I turned off is this one

//Build and run the IceT tests.
ICET_BUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF

However, there is this other option that asks which library IceT tests
should use to "open windows"... can this happen with Mesa? Probably a noob
question.

//The name of the library the IceT tests will use to create windows for
OpenGL contexts. Supported values are GLUT and GLFW.
ICET_OPENGL_WINDOW_LIBRARY:STRING=GLUT

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel reading of data using pvbatch + python
Message-ID: <CAFtK+evuXJ35NoszmUJOEYKFrFtUnXg1y-g0xiNHyqFabtLYjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

  I'm working with a dataset in tecplot format. Each processor generates a
separate file for its own part of the domain. I read all of them in, merge
the datasets using the group datasets filter and then visualize them (make
contours etc.).

nProcs = len(glob.glob('scalar-*dat'))
allOutData = []

for i in range(1,nProcs+1):
    # create a new 'Tecplot Reader'

allOutData.append(TecplotReader(FileNames=['out-{}-{:05d}.dat'.format(sys.argv[1],i)]))
    allOutData[-1].DataArrayStatus = ['u', 'v', 'w', 'P', 'phi', 'node']

# # create a new 'Group Datasets'
groupDatasets1 = GroupDatasets(Input=allOutData)

How can I speed this up? The reading of the data seems to be the most time
consuming part. So running paraview in parallel is not really helping as
now each processor has to read all the files as opposed to just one
processor eariler.

Subject: [Paraview]  can't cmake pv5
Message-ID: <56C6EAC0.6010609@mail.ru>

Hi!

I was trying to build pv5 with mpi and osmesa and couldn't pass cmake 
step. I use this command:

~/bin/cmake/bin/cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
-DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON \

<path>

(cmake 3.4.1, 3.4.3 and 3.5rc3 downloaded from the site, custom python 
2.7.11 and mesa 11.1.2 were used.)

and at the end of its output I see this:
{{{

See also "/home/gennadiy/bin/pv.build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".

}}}

Both log-files contain a lot of information however I can't figure out 
the real problem -- both contain the output from failed tests and 
nothing about why configuration failed.

Stdout also looks normal except messages about sizeof types:
{{{

Peter,

You could add a fake (point or cell) variable from the Calculator and then test for that in the Programmable Filter
Variable ->    Name:DataSetName  (=0?)

Within the filter you could search the keys for "Name:" and split out the DataSetName.

Not very clean, but doable.

If you run a python script you could access the filename, run a Calculator filter to add the variable and then call the Programmable filter to extract the name and use it.   That method should be able to be automated.

YMMV

Dear Jean,


thanks for the helpful advice!


However one question: aren't you right now creating a time average in for each point on a plane (or given input source)? What I was looking for was finding out the average value over a plane, and seeing how this changes over time. Can this be done in a similar fashion? Being new to paraview/python I'm though not really sure how...


Another question is regarding the output: How can I access the annoted outvalue (assigned in 'output.PointData.append(self.temp_data/self.tlen,'myOutputValueName'). Again, now it is in point data, but assuming I can get a single scalar value of the average value over a plane, how could I save this (for each time step) such that I can plot or evaluate it later on?


Again, thanks for your time and help.


/David

David

This sounds like a perfect case for a Python Programmable Filter, looping over timesteps, accumulating data, doing the average, and setting it as a new field. Here is a script I have tested on a single block of data with multiple timesteps.

There is an init phase, to get the number of timesteps, their values (from upstream), and the first dataset at the 0-th timestep.
There is an accumulate phase, where the filter pulls all timesteps, adding to the already existing numpy array.
There is a finish phase, where we do the average and assign it to a new field.

I am doing it for Pressure, you'll have to adapt it to your fieldnames and block structures.

Hi Gena,

Sometime oddities like this show up when different compiler wrappers are
being used.  In this case, your using the Intel MPI wrappers for all
compilations.  Try bypassing them for the main compilation and only using
them for MPI detection:

CC=icc CXX=icpc FC=ifort \
cmake \
  -DMPI_C_COMPILER=mpiicc \
  -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=mpiicpc \
  -DMPI_Fortran_COMPILER=mpiifort \
  <rest_of_cmake options>

Why are the Properties tab/ Transforming controls and the Transform filter different?

The Properties Tab/ Transforming looks like this:

*         Translation

*         Scale

*         Orientation

*         Origin

The Transform filter looks like this:

*         Translate

*         Rotate

*         Scale

Thanks,

Alan

Hi Islem,

This is the place to ask ParaView questions! There is some activity on
StackOverflow, but most people ask questions on this mailing list.

Could you clarify what you want to compute? Do you just want to subset
a volume mesh and display the results over time? Do you want to
compute one quantity and display it as a graph over time? Do you want
to compute a single number from a time series data set?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Cory,
Thank you very much for your prompt reply. I've attached here a picture that illustrates my problem. I am working on the break of bund walls and I want to compute the volume of water that overtops the bund wall (walls surrounding storage tank), after the ?solution reaches the steady state.?
Regards,Islem

 Hi Islem,

This is the place to ask ParaView questions! There is some activity on
StackOverflow, but most people ask questions on this mailing list.

Could you clarify what you want to compute? Do you just want to subset
a volume mesh and display the results over time? Do you want to
compute one quantity and display it as a graph over time? Do you want
to compute a single number from a time series data set?

Thanks,
Cory

Islem,

There are likely two steps:

1). Threshold your volume to identify only the water-containing cells.
It looks like you have a way to do this already?

2). Compute the volumes of the water-containing cells and summing them up.

You can use the Threshold filter to do number 1 if you have a material
code in the cell data. To compute the volume of the cells, add a
Python Annotation filter to the Threshold filter. Set the Expression
to

algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0]))

This uses the numpy-like interface in the Python layer to compute the
volumes of the cells and sum them all up. The Python Annotation filter
should display the volume with a text label in your renderer.

Hope this helps,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] When building from source with CGNS, include paths are
 not wrapped; GitLab issues broken
Message-ID: <5c2e3466fc8b4ee0bf4b12ac139a28e0@MAR190n2.marin.local>

As per title, when I build from source I configure CMake to use the path to the include file. This path is not propagated to the Wrapping/ClientServer directory, where the build fails complaining about the fact that it can?t find the included header cgnslib.h

I don?t know how to fix this, so I?m hoping anyone who is more at home in the source and CMake can do this.

Also, I tried to add a new issue for this on the gitlab page, but that is broken: 404 for the page https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/new and https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/issues/new (I?m not sure if the double paraview/paraview is needed but both don?t work)

It would be nice if I could put an issue directly to GitLab.

Best wishes,


Menno Deij ? van Rijswijk

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython script to create a screen shot of a PVSM
Message-ID: <56CB36EE.2010306@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


I'm trying to write a simple pvpython script that merely takes a screen shot of 
a loaded PVSM:
https://github.com/romangrothausmann/ParaView_scripts/blob/master/render-view.py

However, even if a voxel dataset is displayed as a volume when loaded in PV GUI, 
it does not get rendered by the script.
I've tried to explicitly set the rendering style to Volume and assigned a 
OpacityTransferFunction (as told here: 
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2013-November/029918.html)
Furthermore, the camera position stored in the PVSM does not seem to get loaded, 
nor whether an object is hidden.
What else do I need to do in the script to get PV GUI behaviour?

Also, what to do about this warning:
vtkSMProxyIterator (0x61ef820): ProxyManager is not set. Can not perform 
operation: Begin()


Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F6843583CEA@MBX211.d.ethz.ch>


I am prototyping an AMR output, using programmable source.
having trouble setting up the GhostArray. The following returns None:


grid0 = vtk.vtkUniformGrid() grid0.GenerateGhostArray(exts, True)

ga = grid0.GetCellGhostArray()

I am setting it this way instead of using vtkAMRBox because my input file already
has the cell-data for the blanking. Problem is GetCellGhostArray() returns None.

Hi again Jean,


sorry for the spamming. Just an additional question to what we discussed below:


Working a bit with what you gave me have led to some more problems/questions:


If I try to adapt your script (simply changing to a Slice or Threshold I use, and setting [\'PRES\'] to, in my case, Velocity, I end up in a endless loop where the program gets stuck in the first time step. However, I can't seem to understand why that is. I can see that data is loaded correctly into a vtkArray (if I simply run print(data)) but anyhow doesn't continue beyond the first loop.


Also, I would like to visualize the resulting average value on the same geometry that I loaded. Exiting from the python shell I can't though find my output values. Does anyone know how to give back calculated values to your model such that you can visualize it further in paraview?


FYI a few time steps of my model can be downloaded from here

https://app.box.com/s/u33085me6hh5tuzzb0kbjbpp9i8u9kdx in case anyone is interested.


Again thanks for all the help,


/David

?mne: Re: [Paraview] Cut plane average velocity over time


Dear Jean,


thanks for the helpful advice!


However one question: aren't you right now creating a time average in for each point on a plane (or given input source)? What I was looking for was finding out the average value over a plane, and seeing how this changes over time. Can this be done in a similar fashion? Being new to paraview/python I'm though not really sure how...


Another question is regarding the output: How can I access the annoted outvalue (assigned in 'output.PointData.append(self.temp_data/self.tlen,'myOutputValueName'). Again, now it is in point data, but assuming I can get a single scalar value of the average value over a plane, how could I save this (for each time step) such that I can plot or evaluate it later on?


Again, thanks for your time and help.


/David

David

This sounds like a perfect case for a Python Programmable Filter, looping over timesteps, accumulating data, doing the average, and setting it as a new field. Here is a script I have tested on a single block of data with multiple timesteps.

There is an init phase, to get the number of timesteps, their values (from upstream), and the first dataset at the 0-th timestep.
There is an accumulate phase, where the filter pulls all timesteps, adding to the already existing numpy array.
There is a finish phase, where we do the average and assign it to a new field.

I am doing it for Pressure, you'll have to adapt it to your fieldnames and block structures.

Hi, Chuck!

Thank you for the response, unfortunately it doesn't help:
1. during the cmake step now I see a lot of messages:
{{{
-- Could NOT find MPI_C (missing: MPI_C_LIBRARIES)
-- Could NOT find MPI_CXX (missing: MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES)
-- Could NOT find MPI_Fortran (missing: MPI_Fortran_LIBRARIES)
}}}
2. however, I see "Configuring done" message at the end and
3. then a lot of dev-messages like this one:
{{{
This warning is for project developers. Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

suppress this warning.

}}}
4. OK, configuring done, so I type "make" and see this:
{{{

5. and then cmake (not make!) continues from HDF5 tests and
6. finally

Subject: [Paraview] SWKey: Help with VTK XML-Formatted "Writer" Routine.

Hi Armin,

Thanks for pointing me to the relevant VTK Wiki page!

The information there cleared up my questions about how to incorporate 
an arbitrary n-vertex polyhedral finite element into the VTK 
XML-structured results file for ParaView.

My delayed reply can be attributed to the maelstrom of counters I had to 
introduce into my existing VTK XML Writer. It took a lot of time to get 
everything right. (Luckily, my software has an EnSight Writer that 
handles polyhedral finite elements and I was able to get ParaView to 
convert the 7-cell test mesh into a muti-block *.vtm collection for 
comparison.)

Hi Andy,

I just want to refresh this conversation ? sorry for not passing all messages through this mailing list? my mistake.

After I shared the case you wrote that you had tried a few things but with no luck in PV 5.0. As mentioned below I have tried the following 64-bit versions
- 3.98.1 on Win7
- 4.4.0 on Win7
- 4.2.0 on Linux HPC cluster
Regards,

Hi,

My guess is that it has to do with OpenFOAM's way of saving out extra fields for the initial time step. Several temporal filters assume that the arrays are ordered the same for different time steps but the OpenFOAM reader doesn't follow this convention.

Can you share a data set that reproduces the issue?

Hi,

I have been trying to visualize flow using the particle tracers as described at http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/HowTo_use_particle_tracer_in_paraFoam.

It works when using it on the cavity tutorial but when I try to transfer the setup to one of my own 3D OpenFOAM cases of a pump volute with e.g. 20 timesteps and 900,000 cells Paraview crashes with a segmentation fault when I hit the ?Play? button to step through the individual timesteps.

The pipeline setup is exactly as described in the HowTo (linked above) and I have tried both with and without the Temporal Interpolator and on Linux and Windows platform ? all with the same crash result.

I have tried the following 64-bit version:
3.98.1 on Win7
4.4.0 on Win7
4.2.0 on Linux HPC cluster

At first I thought the reason for the crash was due to the use of interfaces in the model but I have tried a model without interfaces at all and the result is the same.

Are there any restriction to the data which can be used?

The following is the trace right up to pressing ?Play?:

Jean,

By looking at vtkDataSet::GenerateGhostArray() implementation it appears
that ghost cell array will not be created if:
 - the grid extent is not 3D (I supposed it is not your case here)
 - if the the provided extents are the same than the data extents.

You might want to check if this last assertion is not valid for your case.

Best,
Joachim

Hi,all

I wrote the lines.vtk in binary format and the points.vtk in ASCII format

The attached pictures show the process how I get the tubes(closed surfaces

are inside the tubes (blue area in the view3), but I don't know how to work
it out.
Now I'm desperate for achieving my aim, so please help me if you know how

Subject: [Paraview] When building from source with CGNS, include paths are not wrapped; GitLab issues broken

As per title, when I build from source I configure CMake to use the path to the include file. This path is not propagated to the Wrapping/ClientServer directory, where the build fails complaining about the fact that it can?t find the included header cgnslib.h

I don?t know how to fix this, so I?m hoping anyone who is more at home in the source and CMake can do this.

Also, I tried to add a new issue for this on the gitlab page, but that is broken: 404 for the page https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/new and https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/issues/new (I?m not sure if the double paraview/paraview is needed but both don?t work)

It would be nice if I could put an issue directly to GitLab.

Hello

I have tried to submit this topic to the mailing list but did not have any
answer...

I am working with a CFD free surface code.
I have a .vtu volume solution from which I extract one surface which is my
body and another which is my free surface.
I would like to export both surfaces in one CGNS file.
Do you have any idea how I could do that ?

Thanks in advance,

Hi,

I am testing Paraview 5.0 on MacOS X Yosemite and I have noticed that the
CellDataToPointData filter has become very, very slow.

I am visualizing a timeseries and each timestep may take up to 2 seconds to
be visualized.

In order to verify I have reinstalled 4.4 and everything is smooth as
always.

Any suggestion on why this is happening? Is there any default parameter
that I should set?

Thanks

Hi,

Thank you for the bug fix. I've invoked the testing infrastructure on your
branch and will follow up with a review. The change looks simple enough.

Currently, we are not using GitLab's issue tracker, hence the error you
see. Bug reports for ParaView can be posted here:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/

Thanks,
Cory

Ruggiero,

Are you using the ParaView 5.0 MacOS binary from the ParaView
downloads page, or are you building it yourself? If the latter, make
sure to build in Release mode.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Islem,

Please reply-all to keep the discussion on the list so that others may
benefit from the discussion.

First, is there a data array that describes whether a volume element
in your mesh contains water or some other element? If so, you can use
the Threshold filter under the Filters -> Alphabetical -> Threshold
menu to select only the elements representing water. You will have to
set the minimum and maximum to the value that represents water, then
click Apply.

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

Please load the attached state file that shows how to find the points
inside an object. In this case, I use a Point Source to generate the
points and a Sphere Source to generate the object. The Programmable
Filter shows how to find the signed distance of points to the nearest
surface, then threshold those points to select all whose signed
distance is less than 0.

HTH,
Cory

Ruggiero,

Could you give us the whole pipeline involved here?
As you are processing temporal data, CellDataToPointData might not be the
problem here: the reader might be the cause.

Hi Per,

Can you share either a Python script or state file which reproduces the
problem for PV 5.0? I still have your OpenFOAM file to test with so I don't
need that.

Thanks,
Andy

Wow, this is indeed very slow.
Looking at the Timer Log it seems to me like what is slow is the rendering.
Indeed: add an Outline filter after the CellDataToPointData and hide the
CellDataToPointData source. It's fast as it should. You can also try with a
ProgrammableFilter, same result.

It looks like what is slow is coloring by a PointData array (choose a
celldata array and is fast)...

@Ken: any idea why this happens? is it something that has been fixed
recently?

Even more strange: it is slow only with one of the point data array
(scalar), with the other it is OK.

Subject: [Paraview] Number of frames depending on the Picture size
Message-ID: <D2F1EBA1.1796%salazardetro1@llnl.gov>

Hello

I am calling this function to write a movie


renderView1.ViewSize = [1984,1962]

WriteAnimation('./movie_png/optimization_movie.png',Magnification=1, FrameRate=1.0, Compression=False)

And I have noticed that the number of resulting PNG files depends on the Magnification variable and on the ViewSize. If I remove the line renderView1.ViewSize = [1984,1962] and leave Magnification as 1 I will get a greater amount of PNG files than if I increased Magnification or leave the line renderView1.ViewSize = [1984,1962] there. Why is this? It seems as I had to choose between the number of frames and the size of the movie.

Thanks
Miguel

Pulled this off list since I have some ignorant questions to ask :-)

So I loaded the data and it seems to render fine (100 fps).  I did not have
the state file so I'm not sure what pipeline etc is being used.  When I hit
the animation button it plugs along at one frame a second or so. I have no
clue if that is what is expected or not. It appears that the rendering data
is being rebuilt every frame. Again I just don't know enough about PV to
know if that is expected or not. I would think PV would cache the timesteps
if the size is modest but maybe not. I will build PV and run it in the
profiler but it may be tomorrow before the build wraps up.

If you have a modest VTK example then I could probably answer your question
easily.But PV is a much more complex beast and I do not know the internals
well enough to guess.

Thanks
Ken

Hello:

I am trying to import vector files into Paraview which are really just csv
text files delimited by whitespace. I am able to open the files, but they
read in as a single column and I am unable to find the "delimit options" in
any of the manuals or online materials.

Do vector files need to be formatted with a particular scheme in order for
Paraview to properly read them? Thanks

I?m not sure if white space works ? but comma?s do work.

For instance, X, Y, Z, Var does work.

Then, use the Table to Point filter.

There is more information here:  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Data_formats

Does that answer the question?

Dear all,

I'm using Paraview 5.0.0. I would like to use the "Edit Axes Grid ..." function as described here: https://blog.kitware.com/new-in-paraview-axes-grid-annotation/.
But all I can find is the old "Edit Cube Axes..." dialog. Could you point out to me where I find "Edit Axes Grid..."?

Henrik,

As you might know, distributed binaries for ParaView 5.0.0 are based on the
new VTK 'OpenGL2' rendering backend which provides better rendering
efficiency. However, the VTK module for exporting visualization to a PDF or
PS file is highly dependent on the rendering engine... and the adaptation
of this module this new rendering backend is still in progress.
To enable this feature again you will have to compile ParaView 5.0 with the
legacy OpenGL(1) rendering backend, or use a previous version of the
software (4.4).

Best,

Ok. The "Edit Axes Grid..." function became greyed out due to loading an old *.pvsm state file. Works fine if I just load the data.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView does not take into account 'TimeValues'
	attribute of VTK XML files
Message-ID: <CAB8-E4D1pgYOGhhdn=nV5imhcR5N80JwPLu0pqzy5V+2Xn0JvA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaView users,

I would like to report what seems to me to be a bug.

When I import an XML Vtk file in Paraview that contains several timestep
data with a 'TimeValues' attribute, ParaView does not take into account
these time values specified. ParaView seems to replace these values with
indices.

Below is a VTK XML file (vtu) that can be used to reproduce this bug in PV
5.0.
I expect ParaView to set the correct time values (0.0 to 0.4) and not 0 to
4.
The workaround is of course to use a temporal shift scale fitler, but I
would like to avoid this.

This bug or feature has already been mentioned here

Subject: [Paraview] benchmarking through pvbatch in 5.0
Message-ID: <A1A490AB-917C-406F-9B31-1E67C6A26FA1@tacc.utexas.edu>

Hello,
we are using the same benchmark scripts through pvbatch/pvpython as we were in 4.x, however with larger models we are getting odd results.  When running a 336 million triangle isosurface of the LLNL Richmtmeyer meshkov dataset in a for loop that consists of:
for i in range(0,numRuns):
	Render()

We get reported render times of 30 seconds through pvbatch/pvpython.  Using outputs in polydatamapper, I can see it?s triggering the polydatamapper on each call to Render and the timing is consistent with what you might see if LOD is changing for each of those calls.  We set the LODThreshold to be large enough to never be triggered but something appears to be ejecting the polydata representation and regenerating on each call to Render().  If we run this script through the GUI using RunScript in the python shell, we do not see this issue, it only shows up in batch.  

Any leads on what might have changed since 4.x that would trigger this?

Subject: [Paraview] How to write multiple fields to VTU
Message-ID: <56CECDF1.8030904@lspr.ch>

Dear Paraview,

After reading the VTK legacy format guide (in particular, VTU), I am left puzzled about the syntax of the following operation: adding several scalar and several vector fields to points at the same time.

Say I have two scalar fields "S1" and "S2" and two vector fields "V1" and "V2". The syntax should look something like this

<PointData Scalars="???" Vectors="???">
<DataArray type="Float32" Name="S1" NumberOfComponents="1" format="ascii"/>
<DataArray type="Float32" Name="S2" NumberOfComponents="1" format="ascii"/>
<DataArray type="Float32" Name="V1" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii"/>
<DataArray type="Float32" Name="V2" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii"/>
</PointData>

Would you be so kind to tell me what has to be written there where I have put question marks?

Best regards,
Aleksejs Fomins

Hello

I am calling this function to write a movie


renderView1.ViewSize = [1984,1962]

WriteAnimation('./movie_png/optimization_movie.png',Magnification=1, FrameRate=1.0, Compression=False)

And I have noticed that the number of resulting PNG files depends on the Magnification variable and on the ViewSize. If I remove the line renderView1.ViewSize = [1984,1962] and leave Magnification as 1 I will get a greater amount of PNG files than if I increased Magnification or leave the line renderView1.ViewSize = [1984,1962] there. Why is this? It seems as I had to choose between the number of frames and the size of the movie.

Thanks

Hi Tim,

Were you able to get Catalyst built on any of those machines? I briefly
tried on Copper and Garnet with the superbuild but hit some failure that I
didn't investigate further.

Hi Andy, 

Sorry, I thought I updated the list awhile ago! 

Using the scripts that Richard provided, I was able to build on Copper and could run the FEM coprocessing demo. But I got stuck trying to get our code to link against it. Our code is set up using the Catamount toolchain file and so things like dynamic linking don't work with the way we have been doing our build. So, I need to try and figure out how to change our build system setup to get everything to work properly. It doesn't work if we just stop using the toolchain. 

I haven't figured that bit out yet; it's on my todo list. But I was able to get PV to build with Richard's script. 

I also could not get the script that comes with the superbuild to work either, but did not dig into it because I had something that did work.

Hi Tim, 

When building CMake on a Cray, you'll want to build using the host system compilers, i.e. /usr/bin/gcc and /usr/bin/g++, not with the cray compiler wrappers. Usually I just do: 

module purge 
CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ /path/to/cmake_source/bootstrap --prefix=/path/to/cmake/install --parallel=8 
make -j8 install 

The resulting CMake binary can then run on either the login nodes or compute nodes and target anything that CMake supports. I would also suggest building CMake from either the latest git master branch or the current 3.5 release candidate. I've added a new platform file for the Cray Linux Environment that knows how to introspect the compiler wrappers, correctly deal with static / shared, etc, not currently available in the 3.4 release. You can use it by loading your appropriate PrgEnv module setting CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=CrayLinuxEnvironment or using a toolchain file like this: 

# The name of the target operating system 
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME CrayLinuxEnvironment) # This handles all the oddball Cray stuff 

if(DEFINED ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR}) # Older Cray programming environment 
set(COMP_DIR $ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR}) 
elseif(DEFINED ENV{CRAYPE_DIR}) # Newer Cray programming environment 
set(COMP_DIR $ENV{CRAYPE_DIR}) 
else() 
message(FATAL_ERROR "Unable to determine compiler dir") 
endif() 

# Set the compilers 
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/cc) 
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/CC) 
set(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/ftn)

Good morning! 

Thanks Andy and Richard for the advice. 

After banging my head on my keyboard for most of the day yesterday , neither approach worked on Copper. 

For Andy's suggestion of building pv5.0 with the Cray cross compiling script, I got a bunch of errors towards the end. It looks like many things did build, but then those errors about an unknown system kicked in and it seemed to all fall apart. I attached the output log as cray_build_pv5.0.txt 

Richard, I tried your setup as well. I initially was trying to avoid the building CMake step but eventually something in the ParaviewSuperbuild failed because it said it needed CMake 2.8.11 and Copper only has 2.8.10. So, I took a step back and tried to build CMake. When I just do what is in your script -- configure and then make -- the build fails quickly because it says it cannot statically link shared libraries. So I tried to build CMake using the Catamount.cmake toolchain that we use for our application code as well. The initial configuration took over an hour, it sits at 95% for a long time going through the portion where it looks for various headers/features. But eventually it finishes and I tried to build but that failed. I get: 

tgallagh at copper01:~/cmake/build> make 
[ 3%] Built target cmsys 
[ 4%] Built target cmsys_c 
[ 6%] Built target cmzlib 
[ 6%] Building C object Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o 
/u/tgallagh/cmake/cmake/Utilities/cmcurl/lib/strerror.c:32:6: error: #error "strerror_r MUST be either POSIX, glibc or vxworks-style"

make[2]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o] Error 1 
make[1]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/all] Error 2 

So taking a big step backwards here to look at the big picture -- am I (and our lab) just using Cray systems in a fundamentally incorrect way? We've always struggled to get things to build when we never have had issues with SGI/Intel, BlueGene, or IBM machines (even when they were using PowerPC). We used to have all these same issues with our CFD code on Cray as well and the only solution we found was to build all of our codes' libraries statically and drop support for shared libraries. 

I appreciate the help with the scripts. If there's any follow-up advice on what I'm doing wrong in both/either approach, that would be great. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Hi Tim,

Yep, you did update the list a while ago. I just wanted to make sure you
weren't stuck on something that I could potentially help with.

Good luck!

Hi Andy, 

Sorry, I thought I updated the list awhile ago! 

Using the scripts that Richard provided, I was able to build on Copper and could run the FEM coprocessing demo. But I got stuck trying to get our code to link against it. Our code is set up using the Catamount toolchain file and so things like dynamic linking don't work with the way we have been doing our build. So, I need to try and figure out how to change our build system setup to get everything to work properly. It doesn't work if we just stop using the toolchain. 

I haven't figured that bit out yet; it's on my todo list. But I was able to get PV to build with Richard's script. 

I also could not get the script that comes with the superbuild to work either, but did not dig into it because I had something that did work.

Hi Tim, 

When building CMake on a Cray, you'll want to build using the host system compilers, i.e. /usr/bin/gcc and /usr/bin/g++, not with the cray compiler wrappers. Usually I just do: 

module purge 
CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ /path/to/cmake_source/bootstrap --prefix=/path/to/cmake/install --parallel=8 
make -j8 install 

The resulting CMake binary can then run on either the login nodes or compute nodes and target anything that CMake supports. I would also suggest building CMake from either the latest git master branch or the current 3.5 release candidate. I've added a new platform file for the Cray Linux Environment that knows how to introspect the compiler wrappers, correctly deal with static / shared, etc, not currently available in the 3.4 release. You can use it by loading your appropriate PrgEnv module setting CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=CrayLinuxEnvironment or using a toolchain file like this: 

# The name of the target operating system 
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME CrayLinuxEnvironment) # This handles all the oddball Cray stuff 

if(DEFINED ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR}) # Older Cray programming environment 
set(COMP_DIR $ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR}) 
elseif(DEFINED ENV{CRAYPE_DIR}) # Newer Cray programming environment 
set(COMP_DIR $ENV{CRAYPE_DIR}) 
else() 
message(FATAL_ERROR "Unable to determine compiler dir") 
endif() 

# Set the compilers 
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/cc) 
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/CC) 
set(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/ftn)

Good morning! 

Thanks Andy and Richard for the advice. 

After banging my head on my keyboard for most of the day yesterday , neither approach worked on Copper. 

For Andy's suggestion of building pv5.0 with the Cray cross compiling script, I got a bunch of errors towards the end. It looks like many things did build, but then those errors about an unknown system kicked in and it seemed to all fall apart. I attached the output log as cray_build_pv5.0.txt 

Richard, I tried your setup as well. I initially was trying to avoid the building CMake step but eventually something in the ParaviewSuperbuild failed because it said it needed CMake 2.8.11 and Copper only has 2.8.10. So, I took a step back and tried to build CMake. When I just do what is in your script -- configure and then make -- the build fails quickly because it says it cannot statically link shared libraries. So I tried to build CMake using the Catamount.cmake toolchain that we use for our application code as well. The initial configuration took over an hour, it sits at 95% for a long time going through the portion where it looks for various headers/features. But eventually it finishes and I tried to build but that failed. I get: 

tgallagh at copper01:~/cmake/build> make 
[ 3%] Built target cmsys 
[ 4%] Built target cmsys_c 
[ 6%] Built target cmzlib 
[ 6%] Building C object Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o

make[2]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o] Error 1

Message-ID: <E9DAA1E3-DC0F-419F-B59C-3C61827F1CF8@email.arizona.edu>

Hi folks -

I am new to Paraview and even newer to scripting with Python for Paraview (though at least, I am not new to programming!).  I have a need to  run Paraview on our HPC cluster here at the University of Arizona, and I need it to run ?headless? - I desire no GUI output at all, but to process & filter an image series and create output, to be read into a local Paraview instance later.

Here?s a few details, and my questions ? the way I am going about this, I run Paraview normally, start a trace to create a python script, read in my image series and process it, then save the script.  I then upload the script and data to our HPC.  That all works great!  However, I run into trouble fully understanding how to manipulate the DATA vs. the RENDERING of what I ultimately would like to save to disk, to read into the Paraview GUI later, off line form the HPC cluster.

So, firstly ? If I read in a csv series of images, one image/file per moment in time, when I run a filter, the filter should run on the entire series, correct?  But when I do this and then try to save the data ? in this case, a series of table to points calculations, it only saves the last one.   Ideally, I?d like to save an animation and save the data, but WITHOUT calling on the GUI / rendering aspects of Paraview.   Is this possible, and if so, how do I go about it?

I did run across this thread on the web:

http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/98732-paraview-shell-mode-python-script-running.html

Which mentions building Paraview with  OSMesa (CPU based offscreen rendering) enabled? sounds like what I want, but how do I go about determining if the version of Paraview on my system ~s~ built is this manner, and if indeed it is, how do I script in Python to take advantage of that?

Many thanks,

Cynthia

Dear all,

 

I currently have a Programmable Filter that takes a long time to execute and I am looking for a way to optimize it.

The code loops over a large number of points and I have a lot of operations involving numpy arrays.

What are the possible steps that I could follow to make the execution faster ? The question is not very specific, I am looking for general guidelines.

 

Thanks in advance,

The Programmable Filter uses a plain ol' Python interpreter. Some simple Google searches will give advice on writing more efficient Python code.

Generally speaking, Python, as with any interpreted language, does not execute all that fast. Thus, long loops in Python code are probably not going to execute very fast. Operations on numpy arrays are comparatively much faster. If you could reconstruct your loops to instead do operations on numpy arrays (which internally will loop through the elements much faster), then your code should go remarkably faster. There are lots of tricks you can do with indexing to implement features like conditional execution on a per-element basis.

Cynthia,

Have you had the a look at the ParaView Guide?
http://www.paraview.org/paraview-guide/
It explains the concepts of filters and the data analysis pipelines
used in ParaView.

So if I understand this correctly, you want to open a CSV file, apply
Table to Points filter and then save the result out
as a dataset that you can open later if needed without actually doing
any rendering?

If so something like the attached Python script will do the trick. I
generated that using Trace from the GUI, but then removed all the view
related components
since I don't care about those.

You can use the pvbatch or pvpython executable to run the Python
script without the GUI.

This is only needed if you are intending to rendering and you don't
have an X server running on your cluster.

datasets that can be downloaded from paraview.org, if you need a time
varying dataset. Also what version of ParaView are you using?

Zach,

Please keep this reply on list, so we all get to learn (and I get to be corrected when I mess up).

Try changing the Field Delimiter Characters string to be ? ?

Table to point makes points (or dots).  I don?t understand your comment about vectors.

I saw the comma separation, but very inconvenient not to have whitespace delimit. That means I have to go through 30,000 files and change the format - sure it only requires writing a script to change, but white space delimit is a fairly basic standard.

I have used the table to point filter, but I have vector data, the filter reads an X, Y, and Z value. I have x and y location and then Ux, and Uy. So, i have only been able to get dots at the x,y locations so far but no vectors.

Thanks for the help.

Hello:

I am trying to import vector files into Paraview which are really just csv text files delimited by whitespace. I am able to open the files, but they read in as a single column and I am unable to find the "delimit options" in any of the manuals or online materials.

Do vector files need to be formatted with a particular scheme in order for Paraview to properly read them? Thanks

Alan,

I have tried the " ", and it didn't have the effect I had hoped for.

Yes, table to point makes points at the coordinates. I have vectors at
certain pixel coordinates - processed PIV images. I have (x,y) location
with a vector of velocity components (Ux, Uy) at those coordinates. The
table to point seems to be wanting a scalar value at the location.

Thanks

Zach

Just guessing here ? you may have more spaces in the file than you think?  Or, PV may be looking for a space, and you have two?  That?s the reason I recommend commas.

Try this little toy problem that I use all the time:

x-coord y-coord z-coord scalar
0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 2
1 1 0 2
-0.5 -0.5 1 4
-0.5 -0.5 1 5
-0.5 -0.5 1 6
-0.5 -0.5 1 7

	Gold files
Message-ID: <CANMVBVx3v8Eej1_s9Wzv6DAQdeQXs9kVe0Oxvf4Fvty0fAtQhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. We use Ansys CFX in our work but the standard post-processor
CFD-Post consumes one of Ansys licenses while Paraview is free. So I often
make pictures for reports with ParaView to preserve Ansys license for
another users/needs (because other users are not familiar with ParaView and
CFD-Post may consume general "acfd" license feature that may be used for
calculations). I convert CFX results to EnSight Gold format in CFX Solver
Manager (Export Results) and then open in ParaView. It was working well on
Linux (CentOS 6.7 x64, Ubuntu 12.04 x64 with updates) but now I work with
large files and I need to use another machine that has 128 GB of RAM and
runs Windows-7 x64.
I downloaded and installed the following version:
ParaView-5.0.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit.exe
When I open my EnSight-format file I receive the error message that
geometry file cannot be read. I tried to move EnSight files to a simple
location (D:\Temp) and renamed them (test.case, test.geom + edited the case
to change geometry file name to "simple" one). The same result, it cannot
find geometry file... Full error message is as follows:

ERROR: In
C:\bbd\df0abce0\source-paraview\VTK\IO\EnSight\vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx,

OK, I tried to open it in ParaView 4.3. It says nothing (only border of the
message window appears) and crashes. At that moment I see in the status bar
that EnSight reader progress is 100%.

Both ParaView 5.0.0 and 4.3 was tested with EnSight files exported on Linux
and Windows machine. It didn't help.

OK, I tried to export CFX results to CGNS format. ParaView 5.0.0 (without
MPI) cannot read it, so I fed it to ParaView 4.3. It says that its "unable
to filed any meshes".

I also performed an experiment on my Linux laptop. It has only 16 GB of RAM
so its unreal to work with such a big file on this machine but it reads the
same EnSight case and displays the domain! No arrays selected (mesh only),
swap file grows up to 8 GB but the file opens without errors and crashes.
It's only a test because I have not any Linux machine with memory large
enough (our Linux cluster has 128 GB of RAM on every node including master
but it has very poor video).

I switched to CFD Post for this case but I want to know are there any
workarounds to open my EnSight-format results in ParaView for Windows.

Thanks for your attention.

I think there may be two spaces, but whitespace is whitespace. Not even
Excel gets confused by the spacing. I've tried the sample case above, but
PV still did not recognize the delimit.

I have 4 columns:

x-coord y-coord u-velocity v-velocity

The x, y, z, scalar doesn't achieve what I want.

I need something of the form:

x-coord y-coord vector-direction scalar

Thanks

Do you have a sample dataset to share to reproduce this issue?

Thanks

Can you attach a sample file that "does not work"? I tried spaces,
multiple spaces, commas as separators and all worked just fine for me.
I set the "Field Delimiter Characters" as a space (or comma) and also
checked "Merge Consecutive Delimiters". Likewise, the sample file Alan
included also loads for me.

Note, a CSV file will simply be read in as a Table. If you want
ParaView to interpret the x-coord, y-coord arrays as point
coordinates, you have to apply the "Table to Points" filter and select
which columns correspond to the coordinates. Similar to combine
multiple columns into a vector, you have to apply the "Calculator"
filter and use a function such as "iHat * scalar0 + jHat * scalar1".

Attached state file and csv demonstrates how a file with 4 columns can
be processed to read points and velocity vectors.

Carson,

Can you share the data/script? I can dig in to see what could be
happening. BTW, Render() will never use LOD irrespective of
LODThreshold since Render() always triggers full-res render aka
StillRender.

Another thing to try is to run with "-dr" in both cases: pvpython and
ParaVIew GUI + Python shell. Do you still see different results
between the two?

Using outputs in polydatamapper, I can see it?s triggering the polydatamapper on each call to Render and the timing is consistent with what you might see if LOD is changing for each of those calls.  We set the LODThreshold to be large enough to never be triggered but something appears to be ejecting the polydata representation and regenerating on each call to Render().  If we run this script through the GUI using RunScript in the python shell, we do not see this issue, it only shows up in batch.

Subject: [Paraview] Run multiple processes at the same time
Message-ID: <CAAfnFpiLzxz4zVEi7HdF7FFgCn4N=Fi4rB8p6zciqQComVM9mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am stuck with a problem regarding ParaView (version 4.0.1 64-bit),
running on Ubuntu 14.04. I have written a python driver script that calls
for a script that is executed with pvpython. I need to do this about
100.000 times. I have thus written a loop around the call to pvpython to
execute things. It seems however that I execute one process at a time,
after which paraview closes (which I want) and then the next process is
called. The processes I am running are however not super intensive, so it
should be possible to run 10 to 100 of them at the same time in parallel. I
don't seem to find how I can do this. Is there anybody who can provide me
with an idea how to do this?

With kind regards,
Tim

Example script of what I have at the moment:

import subprocess
import numpy as np
import shutil

def main():

    for-loop generating filenames
           print 'We are at', filename3
           subprocess.call(['/usr/bin/pvpython', 'MakeMovie.py', '-f',
filename3])
           shutil.rmtree('./{0}'.format(filename3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Message-ID: <28354c05fea64a7381d77fd77cc57ea5@Y00330G.rd1.rf1>

Hi,



I'm working on a Catalyst adaptor written in Python for one of the CFD codes I use at work and I'm having trouble setting the MPI communicator I want the vtkCPProcessor object to use (in order to use a subset of MPI_COMM_WORLD). The MPI communicator I create is a mpi4py.MPI_Comm object, which I convert to a vtkMPICommunicator object using vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK. However vtk.vtkPVCatalystPython.vtkCPProcessor.Initialize is expecting a vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm object and there does not seem to be a way for me to create such an object from the Python interface. Am I missing something here or is something not wrapped correctly or wrong?



For the moment I use mpi4py.MPI.COMM_WORLD to test everything. The following minimal example replicates my problem:

import mpi4py.MPI

import vtk

comm = mpi4py.MPI.COMM_WORLD

coprocessor = vtk.vtkPVCatalystPython.vtkCPProcessor()

coprocessor.Initialize(vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK(comm))

The last line fails with this message:

TypeError: Initialize argument 1: method requires a vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm, a vtkMPICommunicator was provided.



I hope I post on the right mailing list as this could actually be a problem in VTK.



Thank you for your help.



Best,

Yohann V.

I was able to properly load the file you posted and the values posted by
Scott. I am not certain why it did not work before, perhaps I did not have
the "Merge Consecutive Delimiters" selected, but thought for sure I had
toggled it.

It also seems that after playing around with the "Calculator" I am able to
load the vectors as expected. Still very new to PV.

So, it seems that the two of you have been helpful in remedying my
ignorance. Thanks.

Message-ID: <8531f59b1b7854ef8a850ec9becdc181@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk>

Hi all,

This should be an easy one. I've got GEANT4 exported geometry and 
events. I've got a plugin to convert from GEANT to VTK I cut down the 
geometry to what I need, save it as VTM and use this in the future. If I 
load the HEPREP.zip events without the geometry I can press play and 
flip though event by event quickly, ~10ms per event.. But if I try and 
flip through events with geometry it takes ~10-20seconds per event.

I've tried right clicking on the geom and selecting "ignore time", but 
no luck. Can't find anything in the documentation.

Thanks,
WT

Hi WT,

Is this a new problem or is this the first time you have tried this. If
this is a new problem, in which version of ParaView did it work quickly and
in which version of ParaView did it start? If this is your first time
trying this, how large are your geometries you are trying to display?

Thanks,
Cory

Glad to help. I'd also suggested grabbing the free ParaVIew Guide PDF
to get a handle of some of the pipeline concepts in ParaView.

Hi Andy, 

I finally buckled down and got everything updated in our code to handle dynamic linking on Crays. It was actually pretty easy to write the platform file for it. 

I was able to build and run with coprocessing on Copper. I will be trying on Excalibur, Gordon, Conrad, Shepard and Lightning next. For all of those, I will try the superbuild provided script first to see if it works. Hopefully it does.

Hi Tim, 

Yep, you did update the list a while ago. I just wanted to make sure you weren't stuck on something that I could potentially help with. 

Good luck!

Hi Andy, 

Sorry, I thought I updated the list awhile ago! 

Using the scripts that Richard provided, I was able to build on Copper and could run the FEM coprocessing demo. But I got stuck trying to get our code to link against it. Our code is set up using the Catamount toolchain file and so things like dynamic linking don't work with the way we have been doing our build. So, I need to try and figure out how to change our build system setup to get everything to work properly. It doesn't work if we just stop using the toolchain. 

I haven't figured that bit out yet; it's on my todo list. But I was able to get PV to build with Richard's script. 

I also could not get the script that comes with the superbuild to work either, but did not dig into it because I had something that did work.

Hi Tim, 

Were you able to get Catalyst built on any of those machines? I briefly tried on Copper and Garnet with the superbuild but hit some failure that I didn't investigate further.

Hi Tim, 

When building CMake on a Cray, you'll want to build using the host system compilers, i.e. /usr/bin/gcc and /usr/bin/g++, not with the cray compiler wrappers. Usually I just do: 

module purge 
CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ /path/to/cmake_source/bootstrap --prefix=/path/to/cmake/install --parallel=8 
make -j8 install 

The resulting CMake binary can then run on either the login nodes or compute nodes and target anything that CMake supports. I would also suggest building CMake from either the latest git master branch or the current 3.5 release candidate. I've added a new platform file for the Cray Linux Environment that knows how to introspect the compiler wrappers, correctly deal with static / shared, etc, not currently available in the 3.4 release. You can use it by loading your appropriate PrgEnv module setting CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=CrayLinuxEnvironment or using a toolchain file like this: 

# The name of the target operating system 
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME CrayLinuxEnvironment) # This handles all the oddball Cray stuff 

if(DEFINED ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR}) # Older Cray programming environment 
set(COMP_DIR $ENV{ASYNCPE_DIR}) 
elseif(DEFINED ENV{CRAYPE_DIR}) # Newer Cray programming environment 
set(COMP_DIR $ENV{CRAYPE_DIR}) 
else() 
message(FATAL_ERROR "Unable to determine compiler dir") 
endif() 

# Set the compilers 
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/cc) 
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/CC) 
set(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER ${COMP_DIR}/bin/ftn)

Sorry if you get this multiple times -- the original was blocked from the PV list because the output log was too big. I can send the log I referred to off-list to anybody who is interested. 

-------------------------------------------------- 

Good morning! 

Thanks Andy and Richard for the advice. 

After banging my head on my keyboard for most of the day yesterday , neither approach worked on Copper. 

For Andy's suggestion of building pv5.0 with the Cray cross compiling script, I got a bunch of errors towards the end. It looks like many things did build, but then those errors about an unknown system kicked in and it seemed to all fall apart. I attached the output log as cray_build_pv5.0.txt 

Richard, I tried your setup as well. I initially was trying to avoid the building CMake step but eventually something in the ParaviewSuperbuild failed because it said it needed CMake 2.8.11 and Copper only has 2.8.10. So, I took a step back and tried to build CMake. When I just do what is in your script -- configure and then make -- the build fails quickly because it says it cannot statically link shared libraries. So I tried to build CMake using the Catamount.cmake toolchain that we use for our application code as well. The initial configuration took over an hour, it sits at 95% for a long time going through the portion where it looks for various headers/features. But eventually it finishes and I tried to build but that failed. I get: 

tgallagh at copper01:~/cmake/build> make 
[ 3%] Built target cmsys 
[ 4%] Built target cmsys_c 
[ 6%] Built target cmzlib 
[ 6%] Building C object Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o 
/u/tgallagh/cmake/cmake/Utilities/cmcurl/lib/strerror.c:32:6: error: #error "strerror_r MUST be either POSIX, glibc or vxworks-style" 
# error "strerror_r MUST be either POSIX, glibc or vxworks-style" 
^ 
make[2]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o] Error 1 
make[1]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/all] Error 2 

So taking a big step backwards here to look at the big picture -- am I (and our lab) just using Cray systems in a fundamentally incorrect way? We've always struggled to get things to build when we never have had issues with SGI/Intel, BlueGene, or IBM machines (even when they were using PowerPC). We used to have all these same issues with our CFD code on Cray as well and the only solution we found was to build all of our codes' libraries statically and drop support for shared libraries. 

I appreciate the help with the scripts. If there's any follow-up advice on what I'm doing wrong in both/either approach, that would be great. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Hello everyone, 

When I open a .pvtu (XML) file from Paraview 4.2, I occur a "GetNumberOfArraysEnabled() failed error".

    paraview: /softs/ARCHIVES/ParaView-v4.2.0-source/VTK/IO/XML/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx:317: 
    virtual void vtkXMLDataReader::SetupOutputData(): Assertion `this->NumberOfCellArrays ==

However, it seems ok for Paraview 5.0, I would like to ask if it is a bug in the old version or vtk has changed something?

Thank you very much,

With mpi4py you can have multiple python processes running in parallel.
See this script for a very basic use example:

import sys
from mpi4py import MPI

comm= MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()

print "%d" % (rank)

which you can launch by mpirun -np N script.py.

It is, however, a bad idea to have more parallel threads than available 
processors, as the overhead on the OS scheduler increases.
If you have a machine with N cores, your best bet is to run with N processes 
at a time.
You can use mpi4py over several machines though.

Hi all,

I am stuck with a problem regarding ParaView (version 4.0.1 64-bit), running 
on Ubuntu 14.04. I have written a python driver script that calls for a script 
that is executed with pvpython. I need to do this about 100.000 times. I have 
thus written a loop around the call to pvpython to execute things. It seems 
however that I execute one process at a time, after which paraview closes 
(which I want) and then the next process is called. The processes I am running 
are however not super intensive, so it should be possible to run 10 to 100 of 
them at the same time in parallel. I don't seem to find how I can do this. Is 
there anybody who can provide me with an idea how to do this?


With kind regards,

Hello. Sorry for silence, I'm usually offline on holydays, although I have
internet connection and read your mail.

Samuel Key

Thanks for your attention.

About transferring files from Linux to Windows. I use binary EnSight files
because CFX converter fails to write so large files in ASCII format. But I
tried to convert from CFX to EnSight (binary) on the same Win-7 x64 machine
with ParaView. Both installed versions (4.3 and 5.0) failed to open the
geometry (I unchecked all fields). ParaView 4.3 crashed, ParaView 5.0 just
cannot open file...

I think that the root cause may be a geometry file size. It is 4.9 GiB (5.3
GB), mesh have about 150 millions of cells, not 600 thusands like in your
case. Its possible that ParaView for Windows cannot process so large
EnSight files, although the Linux version reads in this geometry and
displays outline (swapping is so intensive so I cannot displaye something
else).

I performed another test with *EnSight 6* (not Gold) format. Conversion was
made on Win-7 x64 machine. The same results: PV 4.3 crashed, PV 5.0 "cannot
stat" (full error message is in my first post on this topic). Sorry, now I
need to work on with my report...

Another "experimental data". I was able to load this big case in ParaView
viat the CGNS format. It was neccesary to select CGNS 3.0 and HDF5 options
in CFX Converter. But when I apply the Extract Block filter I see no any
boundaries, only fluid domain (that is displayed OK). So CGNS format is not
a wayout...

Just to chime in, a new vector graphics backend is implemented for OpenGL2
and should be available in the new release. It's functionality is limited
compared to the old one (most things are just rasterized to the image
background with vectorized text, etc overlayed), but it will produce output
of the proper format.

Cheers,
Dave

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview bug found in pvtu files containing polyhedrons
Message-ID: <45EAF588-0B4F-45B9-B4AB-F1EC8EC656FF@googlemail.com>

Dear All,

I have recently been having problems reading pvtu files in paraview when those files contain arbitrary polyhedrons: this is from the output of a large scale code that runs in parallel via mpi.  To show the problem, I have written a very small sample code, attached, that runs in serial but reproduces the salient issues experienced by my larger code when run in parallel.  It is clear, via the toggling a boolean, that the problem happens when vtk_polyhedrons types are used.  There is a short description at the top of the bug.cxx file, followed by instructions.  I use stock versions of paraview here, although self compiled ones show no difference.

In short compile the code, run it, and open the pvtu file in paraview.  You should see 4 cells.
Switch the ?bug? bool to true, recompile, re-run it, and reopen the pvtu file.  The screen will be blank.  

The only difference is that cells are added to the unstructured grid explicitly as vtk_polyhedrons using a face-stream, rather than as hexs.  I cannot do this in the real code!  The rest of the code is just there to produce the ?serial? mesh, and threshold this mesh to produce two ?parallel-partition? meshes.  I use the new ghost type framework as this is consistent with the real code, and this runs and compiles on OS X and gcc.  Likewise it has been build against vtk 6.3 and the bug manifests itself in paraview 4.4 and 5.0.  Visit 2.10 does not have this bug and can correctly open the pvtu containing polyhedrons: this is my current workaround.

Can any of the developers shed light on this?  Is a fix known, if so when will it be released?  Do others have this problem [1, 2, 3] outside of those long reported? Does anyone else have workarounds?

Any help really appreciated, 
Andy

So you are saying that it doesn't work in ParaView 4.2 but it does in 5.0?
Likely a bug that was fixed. Can you just use 5.0?

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] how to draw a mesh in preview
Message-ID: <3B648009-2AE9-4578-9191-FFA3C2764E05@gmail.com>

Hi I am new to Paraview

Can you help

I have data in a CSV spreadsheet. 


It contains the xyz point coordinates of a 3D shape (20,000+ nodes). 

The file also contains the triangulation coordinates in 3 separate columns for these nodes (40000 + triangulations). These create the faces of the mesh

I can work out how to plot the points, using 

Filter?Table to points. 


How do I plot the faces?
Do the 3 columns need to be turned into an array?


And how do I colour the faces or contour them by another value (called "bi" in the spreadsheet)



here is an example of the spreadsheet

nn = node number

the 3d coordinates of the points are x, y, z

and the faces of the mesh are specified by (XYZ)

I WISH TO PLOT Points (x, y, x) , draw faces (XYZ) colour by ?bi"



in matlab

it would be


trisurf(Tri,X,Y,Z,C) 


where Tri = array(XYX)

X,Y,Z = (x, y, z)

c= "bi"




nn	x	y	z	X	Y	Z	uni	bi

Good morning! 

Thanks Andy and Richard for the advice. 

After banging my head on my keyboard for most of the day yesterday, neither approach worked on Copper. 

For Andy's suggestion of building pv5.0 with the Cray cross compiling script, I got a bunch of errors towards the end. It looks like many things did build, but then those errors about an unknown system kicked in and it seemed to all fall apart. I attached the output log as cray_build_pv5.0.txt 

Richard, I tried your setup as well. I initially was trying to avoid the building CMake step but eventually something in the ParaviewSuperbuild failed because it said it needed CMake 2.8.11 and Copper only has 2.8.10. So, I took a step back and tried to build CMake. When I just do what is in your script -- configure and then make -- the build fails quickly because it says it cannot statically link shared libraries. So I tried to build CMake using the Catamount.cmake toolchain that we use for our application code as well. The initial configuration took over an hour, it sits at 95% for a long time going through the portion where it looks for various headers/features. But eventually it finishes and I tried to build but that failed. I get: 

tgallagh at copper01:~/cmake/build> make 
[ 3%] Built target cmsys 
[ 4%] Built target cmsys_c 
[ 6%] Built target cmzlib 
[ 6%] Building C object Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o 
/u/tgallagh/cmake/cmake/Utilities/cmcurl/lib/strerror.c:32:6: error: #error "strerror_r MUST be either POSIX, glibc or vxworks-style" 
# error "strerror_r MUST be either POSIX, glibc or vxworks-style" 
^ 
make[2]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/strerror.c.o] Error 1 
make[1]: *** [Utilities/cmcurl/lib/CMakeFiles/cmcurl.dir/all] Error 2 

So taking a big step backwards here to look at the big picture -- am I (and our lab) just using Cray systems in a fundamentally incorrect way? We've always struggled to get things to build when we never have had issues with SGI/Intel, BlueGene, or IBM machines (even when they were using PowerPC). We used to have all these same issues with our CFD code on Cray as well and the only solution we found was to build all of our codes' libraries statically and drop support for shared libraries. 

I appreciate the help with the scripts. If there's any follow-up advice on what I'm doing wrong in both/either approach, that would be great. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Hi Tim, 

I would recommend the ParaView superbuild script at Scripts/Sites/Cray-PrgEnv-cross-compile.sh for building PV 5.0. 

The options you want to give it are the following: 
Cray-PrgEnv-cross-compile.sh <comp> </path/to/cmake> </temp/download/directory> </install/directory> 

Here, comp needs to be the string used to load the program environment, e.g. "PrgEnv-[gnu/gcc/Gnu] on those machines. 

I used this to build a PV 5.0 pre-release version on Cori at NERSC and it worked just fine. It doesn't have an option to freeze python but after running that script you can go into the newly created cross/paraview/src/paraview-build subdirectory and switch it to that. 

Another thing is if you're using the Intel compilers you may need to do a "module load gcc" when building and running your code. Intel's C++11 compilers rely on the GCC header files and libraries for some stuff and without gcc loaded it will give errors like "missing GLIBC". 

Good luck and let us know how it goes! 

Best, 
Andy

Andy, 

We don't really care about the compiler or MPI used for paraview. Our code only supports Intel and GNU, but for simplicity I usually build paraview with GNU so everybody can use it. We usually use the default MPI for a system also, which on copper is cray-mpich/7.1.0 currently. 

When we build our code, we have to specify the Catamount toolchain so everything is statically linked because we haven't really figured out how to update everything to use shared libraries on the compute nodes. When we first set up our build environment, shared libraries wasn't an option. If we go that route, will I need the FREEZE_PYTHON option since shared linking won't be available? 

I suppose the proper answer is that we should update our build environment for shared linking rather than static. It's been on my to-do list to figure out for awhile now, but I haven't been able to write the proper toolchain file for it. 

It appears that on copper at least (haven't checked the others), the system install has the libvtkPVPythonCatalyst* libraries (I misspoke in my previous email) but it does not have the development files from the PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES option. That and PARAVIEW_ENABLE_COPROCESSING are the only options in addition to the standard set of build options we need.

Hi Rick, 

Did you build ParaView with PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES enabled? Tim will need that for using Catalyst if he's going to be using your builds but not if he's going to do his own. 

Tim, some questions on what you need: 

    * Do you have a specific compiler and version you want/need to use? Same thing for MPI implementation. 
    * Do you have a specific version of ParaView that you want to use? 


I would recommend using the superbuild tools, to build statically with Python and Mesa. The other libraries can be built with the superbuild (definitely use system MPI though) for convenience even though for Catalyst you probably won't need many of them. The FREEZE_PYTHON option is to statically linking the other Python modules into the executable. This is definitely useful for when running with a high number of MPI ranks since when loading a module (e.g. paraview.simple) in parallel it can really kill the file system if thousands of processes are simultaneously trying to load a bunch of Python modules. Note though that this isn't needed for a Catalyst Python script since that is done specially where process 0 reads the file and broadcasts it to all of the other processes. 
Cheers, 
Andy

Hi everybody, 

I'm about to endeavor on the always fun process of building Paraview on Cray 
systems, specifically Copper (ERDC), Garnet (ERDC) and Excalibur (ARL). 
Little is ever easy on these systems and I've never succeeded at building 
paraview on them in the past. However, we want to run with co-processing on 
the compute nodes and so it's time to try again. 

I saw there are some build scripts in the ParaviewSuperbuild for Cray 
systems. Does anybody know of any documentation or examples on how to use 
them? What dependencies do I need to build using the superbuild and what can 
I use that is already on the system? For example -- python, HDF5, zlib, etc 
are all available, but do I need to build my own versions? 

Is it possible to build just Paraview (not using the superbuild) using the 
system-installed modules? Does the FREEZE_PYTHON option work or help 
eliminate the issues of running on the compute nodes? 

If anybody has any advice on the best way to go, I would greatly appreciate 
it. We need to have python, co-processing, and off-screen rendering enabled; 
otherwise, it's just the standard build options. 

Thanks! 

Tim

Giles,

"Image Data" is simply what VTK calls a structured grid with axis aligned points with uniform spacing between them. It is a restrictive data format, but if your data fits then it is a compact representation because you don't have to explicitly specify cell connections or point locations. I've attached an excerpt from the ParaView Tutorial that lists the data types including both image data and unstructured grids.

Legacy VTK files (those with a .vtk extension) can represent either unstructured grid data or image data. I've also attached an example vtk file containing image data. Complete documentation of the vtk file format can be found in this document: http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf.

Kenneth, wonderful - that's done the trick (see attached).
A quick and simple solution!

Whats the difference between an image file (and the unstructured data file that I have created)?

Thanks very much, Giles.

Giles,

I think I've figured out your problem. The scalars data you sent me is an unstructured grid with "voxel"-type cells. One of my least favorite features of VTK is that there is a distinction between a box in an unstructured grid (called a hexahedra) and a box in a data set with structured grid (called a voxel). These two cells are essentially the same shape, but the order of the points is different.

The reason why I dislike this feature is that it is technically allowable to put voxel cells in an unstructured grid. However, this fouls up lots of filters that don't check for this corner case. Apparently the probe filter, which is the underlying filter for resample with dataset, is one of the filters broken for voxels. (Unless there is something else about this dataset that I am missing.) I submitted a bug about this (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15982).

The most expedient way around this problem is to run the tetrahedralize filter on the scalars. That will convert the voxels to tetrahedra correctly, and the probe filter has no problem on that data type. The interpolation will be slightly different but close. Overall a better solution is to save your data as image data rather than convert it to an unstructured grid. The file will be smaller and the interpolation should happen correctly.

Kenneth,

I have made two files here available for download (sphere.stl and scalars.vtk).

I hope you can give these a try using "Resample with Dataset" to see what the problem is.

Hi, Cory
I have tried to take out the points inside a tube to lines in the same
programmable filter as you, but it turns out that there are always some
points outside the tube which the filter can not get rid of. I have made a
small example for you. Do you have any idea about this situation ?
