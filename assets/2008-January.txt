Subject: [Paraview] Generating an animation in Paraview 3.2.1 ( vs. Paraview
	2.6 )
Message-ID: <006e01c84d21$19480930$2212e282@mek.dtu.dk>

Dear Developers

First of all, thanks for this lovely software. 

I have happily used Paraview 2.6 which I have used for generating animations
based on STL files, like this one
http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/MPI08/paraview_movie2.avi . The sole reason for
using the STL format is that it was easy to code.

Recently I discovered the new version 3.2.1. Unfortunately I have trouble
generating animations, even with the data which is provided (Single Sphere
Animation in ParaViewData3.2.zip). 

Speaking on behalf of new and inexperienced users maybe you can help with
this question

1)
The procedure that works in version 2.6 (but not in version 3.2.1 (windows))
is
a. Open a data file, e.g. one of the STL files
http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/MPI08/ParaviewSTL/stl_data.zip

b. Press the accept button
c. Press play to see the animation

New users like to see a quick and easy demo of what the software can do. If
this is not a bug, I think it would be useful to add to the existing guide 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series how to generate an
animation.

Thanks and Happy New Year!
Allan

Hi Allan,

Am I correct in assuming you have a series of stl files?

That's a good question.  It looks like the tube filter only allows you
to vary the radius by the "active" scalars or vectors rather than
allowing you to select one.  I reported a bug on the issue:

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6208

In the mean time, you can work around the problem by using the array
calculator filter to create an "active" scalars array.  The output
variable of the array calculator filter is always set to "active."
Thus, just use it to create a new variable that is the same as the one
you want to vary the tube by.

Message-ID: <D352EECB85028F4A90BE06EC391D00290156965B@welkrock.ricerca.lan>


Dear all, 
I'm a new Paraview 3.2.0 user on a Windows platform. I  create from my applications large  VTK XML unstructuredgrid type files (.vtu), that are successfully displayed and managed by Paraview. I have only a problem: how a title string that should be automatically displayed can be added to the .vtu files (or the .pvd collecting file)  instead of  adding it all the times by hand? I have not found information about this in my VTK File Formats documentation.
Thanks

Roberto

Subject: [Paraview] Volume rendering interactivity
Message-ID: <c2f8aa50801021317r5800ab0fgcb80709a38aed551@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
  I work for a geological information company which has some basic 3D
visualization capability.

  I am trying to introduce volume visualization here through Paraview.

  While evaluating Paraview, I noticed that there is a "redraw" phase [the
progress bar shows up] when interacting with the data via mouse move.

  It was kind of unexpected as I was hoping to have smooth interactive
manipulation of the volume.

  My past experience with volume visualization has been through applications
like OpenDX and Voxler.

  Am I using Paraview wrongly?

  I am interested in Paraview because it is cross-platform, actively in
development and has a Python scripting interface.

Regards

Thanks for the advice. I do have a little endian vti file that only  
has one dataset that seems to be OK.

http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~cwarren/vtk/Utsi_1000_fs28.vti

I'll check my files, maybe its  a problem with multiple datasets.

Subject: [Paraview] save screenshot bug (?)
Message-ID: <477C0D39.5030604@t-zones.sk>

Hello everybody,

I am a newbie Paraview 3.2.1 (installed as binaries) user on Ubuntu 
Gutsy. Everything is working fine except when I am saving screenshot the 
only succesfull option is saving to pdf file, every other option is 
giving an extensive error message (see the end of this e-mail).

Could be something wrong in my installation or is it a bug? Did somebody 
recognized something similar? I did not find it within the Paraview 
error reports, however, so I have a suspection that the fault is 
somewhere on my side ... am I right?

Best regards

Tomas

p.s.: Healthy and wealthy new year for everybody! :-)

Message-ID: <c9adba420801030612xa7b1376m4ba7591f1e328cb3@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to provide a custom display panel for a plugin I have created.
The plugin is for a new source which is a subclass of
vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader (the plot3d file is generated from inputs selected
in the object panel) and I would like to customize the display options for
my users.

I can see this is done for "TextSource" and "TimeToTextConverter" but when
looking through the code (pqObjectBuilder.cxx, line 400) there is a
conditional statement to check specifically for these sources.  Does this
mean that it is not possible from a plugin? (Or am I looking in the wrong
place here?)

Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance,
Paul

PS Great software ;)

Last time I asked the same question, I was told I would have to include the
xmlName of my class to the conditional statement, and recompile paraview to
get custom display panels like TextSource to work.

Hi Paul,

In your plugin, you need to implement the pqDisplayPanelInterface (just 
what the pqStandardDisplayPanels in pqDisplayProxyEditorWidget.cxx does) 
and the register it with the plugin manager. If you look at 
pqDisplayProxyEditorWidget::updatePanel, you'll see that it checks for 
all pqDisplayPanelInterface implementations registered and asks them to 
create the panel for the source.

Hi Ken,
 Thanks for the clarification. I think a little more information is needed
as I am
running into some problem that I can't seem to resolve.

I am using 3 machines of my cluster all three are connected to 3 displays. I
want
use 2 of them as multi-tile display with 2 tiles. I have the Paraview GUI on
the
third machine. All three have X servers running and are MPI enabled. So here
is how I launch the jobs on the machines.

$ mpirun -n2 -hostlist "sva11 sva12" /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 pvserver -tdx=2
-tdy=1

and I launch the client

$ paraview

and then connect to sva11.

My servers.pvsc looks like

<Servers>
  <Server name="builtin" resource="builtin:">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="fw-sva10" resource="cs://sva10:11111">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="fw-sva11" resource="cs://sva11:11111">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="fw-sva12" resource="cs://sva12:11111">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
<Server>

But the window multi-tile window appears only on sva11 and it doesn't
span the whole screen (which it used to do previously). And it doesn't seem
like sva12 is even doing anything. I suspect this because sva11 flickers
when the client connects, but sva12 remains as it is.

If I do the reverse and connect the client to sva12, then model window
appears
on sva12 and sva11 seems to do nothing.

Is there anything I am missing ?
I am using Paraview 3.2.1.

Thanks,
Manju

This is fixed on cvs head. I am also attaching a patch in case you
want to apply it to your 3.2 source. The patch has to be applied in
the ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/ directory. The patch
only adds support for animating stl file series. We do not support
file series of formats that natively support time such as XML-based
VTK formats. To animate those, you have to write a pvd file.

Hi Utkarsh,

Does this mean that I don't need to edit the main Paraview code?  Do you
have any examples of a plugin which does this?  If not, I would be happy to
make one, but I'm still a little confused as to how to implement it.  So far
I have a plugin for the server and one for the client, adding a reader and
panel to paraview.  Below is my CMake file:

8<----------------------------------------------------------------
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})


QT4_WRAP_CPP(MOC_SRCS pqMyPanel.h)
QT4_WRAP_UI(UIC_SRCS pqMyPanel.ui)

ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL(IFACES IFACE_SRCS CLASS_NAME pqMyPanel
                          XML_NAME MyReader XML_GROUP sources)


ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyReaderSMPlugin "1.0"
                    SERVER_MANAGER_XML vtkMyReader.xml
                    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyReader.cxx)
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyReaderGUIPlugin "1.0"
                    GUI_INTERFACES ${IFACES}
                    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES pqMyReader.xml
                    SOURCES pqMyPanel.cxx ${MOC_SRCS} ${UIC_SRCS}
${IFACE_SRCS})
---------------------------------------------------------------->8

Is there a macro to add a display panel so the file can be auto generated,
or do I need to create my own subclass for pqPlugin and manually add it as
one of the interfaces?

Thanks,
Paul

To add a bit more on the compiling side of it...  there is a CMake macro 
in ParaView3/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake called 
ADD_PARAVIEW_DISPLAY_PANEL().  You can follow what it does, but you 
can't use that macro directly because the implementation it creates for 
pqDisplayPanelInterface assumes you have your own representation your're 
making a panel for.  In your case, you're making a panel for an existing 
representation.

Then you call ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN() and don't forget to fill in the 
GUI_INTERFACE argument yourself since you aren't using any macros that 
give you that.

That's correct.  You can do this in a plugin.

The closest example is ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/GUIView.  But what you 
want is different enough that it may not help much.

As Utkarsh said, you create your own implementation of 
pqDisplayPanelInterface, not pqPlugin.
There's an ADD_PARAVIEW_DISPLAY_PANEL macro that you can follow as an 
example.  Since you need to make your own pqDisplayPanelInterface,  you 
can't call that macro.
Your implementation of pqDisplayPanelInterface needs to be give to 
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN's GUI_INTERFACES argument so it can put it in the 
pqPlugin implementation it creates.

Shouldn't you be using -np 2 instead of -n2.  I don't see where you
specified your MPI implementation, but I have never used -n# in liu of
-np #.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Client server problems in running 3.2.1 on SVA

 

Hi Ken,
 Thanks for the clarification. I think a little more information is
needed as I am
running into some problem that I can't seem to resolve.

I am using 3 machines of my cluster all three are connected to 3
displays. I want 
use 2 of them as multi-tile display with 2 tiles. I have the Paraview
GUI on the 
third machine. All three have X servers running and are MPI enabled. So
here
is how I launch the jobs on the machines.

$ mpirun -n2 -hostlist "sva11 sva12" /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 pvserver -tdx=2
-tdy=1 

and I launch the client 

$ paraview

and then connect to sva11.

My servers.pvsc looks like

<Servers>
  <Server name="builtin" resource="builtin:">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="fw-sva10" resource="cs://sva10:11111">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="fw-sva11" resource="cs://sva11:11111"> 
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="fw-sva12" resource="cs://sva12:11111">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
<Server>


But the window multi-tile window appears only on sva11 and it doesn't
span the whole screen (which it used to do previously). And it doesn't
seem
like sva12 is even doing anything. I suspect this because sva11 flickers

when the client connects, but sva12 remains as it is.

If I do the reverse and connect the client to sva12, then model window
appears
on sva12 and sva11 seems to do nothing.

Is there anything I am missing ? 
I am using Paraview 3.2.1.

Thanks,
Manju

What you are trying to do does not work because ParaView is not supposed
to run like that. When running in client/server mode, ParaView connects
to process 0 of the server, and nothing else. All communication with the

client goes through process 0, and process 0 of the server uses the MPI
interconnect to pass data to and from the other nodes in the server.

ParaView is implemented in this way for convenience and scalability. It 
is not scalable to have every process in the server to connect to the
client because all communication will eventually have to go through the
same network interface on the client side. Also, the MPI interconnect on

the server is almost always faster than the socket communication between
client and server.

Subject: [Paraview] Get boundaries of the mesh
Message-ID: <e23c95830801031340l63501128gd152c3ad49e8ce51@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

In Paraview 2.6, I was able to get the outer boundaries of my mesh through

Mesh -> Extract Surface -> Extract edges

and when I displayed the edges, I could get the outer boundaries.

But now when i try to do the same with paraview 3.2, I recover the entire
mesh, as if each element is a surface of its own and generatees edges for
that surface.

I use the gui and am not familiar with python. Is there a way to generate
the edges from within the viewer?

Thanks for the help

I got it working..sorry for the spam..it should have been

Mesh -> Extract Surface -> Feature edges and not

Mesh -> Extract Surface -> Extract edges

Sorry about that...

Hi Ken,
 Yeah I am using -np 2, that was a typo. I am using HPMPI, HPs
implementation of MPI.

Thanks,

I can now change the display panel for all sources/filters relating to a
view.  Is there a way to set the display panel depending on the source or
filter?

Thanks for all the help so far,
Paul

Hi,

Is there any website where I can still get paraview-2.6.1 source code?

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple windows when running parallel PV 3.2.1
Message-ID: <477E3FA9.8050005@cea.fr>


Hello !!!

I'am trying to run ParaView 3.2.1 generated with MPI support on a 
BULL/Itanium cluster (900 nodes, 8 cores/node). In our configuration it 
is mandatory to use LSF/SLURM batch system. My test case is composed of 
16 VTU files and 1 PVTU master file. It works fine when I use only the 
Paraview client, but for some bigger cases I will need to perform a real 
parallel post-treatment (128 processors or more).

The server is launched as well in my LSF submission file :

srun -n 16 ./pvserver

The LSF submission file  "pvserver.lsf" is submitted as well :

bsub < pvserver.lsf

The hosts (or nodes) used by the server are host225 and host226.

Then, I run the client and I connect it to the  node where is running 
the MPI root process (process 0 is on host225). To do that I use the 
File/Connect menu of the client where I have defined the server with the 
manual startup mode. The connection is OK but when I click on button 
"Apply", after master file opening, 16 windows appear in addition of the 
main client window. Each of the 16 windows displays its associated 
sub-domain.

Can someone tell me how to avoid the opening of these 16 windows and how 
to make paraview display all domains in the client main window ?

Many thanks.
Manuel.

In your pqDisplayPanelInterface implementation you check for the source 
or filter like so:

bool  MyDisplayInterface::canCreatePanel(pqRepresentation* display)
{
  pqPipelineSource* s = display->getInput();
  vtkSMProxy = s->getProxy();
  if(QString("MySourceOrFilter") == s->GetXMLName())
  {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

Message-ID: <1199700253.3261.6.camel@augpc-erdw-geo-hpx-dock-2074.ethz.ch>

Hi all

I am working my way through the servermanager tutorial
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf) at the
moment. Whenever I reach page ten and type the line:
sphereSource.SetCenter(1.0, 1.0, 0.0) it results in a segmenation fault
and closes pvpython. Up to this point everything works in the tutorial,
i can also type the line when using vtkpython without a segmentation
fault. 
Has anybody encountered the same? Any help is appreciated.
I am using Suse 10.3.

Cheerz,
Corinne

Sorry to keep asking questions but pqRepresentation doesn't have a
"getInput()" method...

What happens when you run glxgears in an mpi job?

 

  mpirun -np 2 -hostlist "sva11 sva12" /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 glxgears

Hi Ken,
 Yeah I am using -np 2, that was a typo. I am using HPMPI, HPs
implementation of MPI. 

Thanks,
Manju

	 

	Shouldn't you be using -np 2 instead of -n2.  I don't see where
you specified your MPI implementation, but I have never used -n# in liu
of -np #.

on SVA

	 

	Hi Ken,
	 Thanks for the clarification. I think a little more information
is needed as I am
	running into some problem that I can't seem to resolve.
	
	I am using 3 machines of my cluster all three are connected to 3
displays. I want 
	use 2 of them as multi-tile display with 2 tiles. I have the
Paraview GUI on the 
	third machine. All three have X servers running and are MPI
enabled. So here
	is how I launch the jobs on the machines.
	
	$ mpirun -n2 -hostlist "sva11 sva12" /bin/env DISPLAY=:0
pvserver -tdx=2 -tdy=1 
	
	and I launch the client 
	
	$ paraview
	
	and then connect to sva11.
	
	My servers.pvsc looks like
	
	<Servers>
	  <Server name="builtin" resource="builtin:">
	    <ManualStartup/>
	  </Server>
	  <Server name="fw-sva10" resource="cs://sva10:11111">
	    <ManualStartup/>
	  </Server>
	  <Server name="fw-sva11" resource="cs://sva11:11111"> 
	    <ManualStartup/>
	  </Server>
	  <Server name="fw-sva12" resource="cs://sva12:11111">
	    <ManualStartup/>
	  </Server>
	<Server>

	
	But the window multi-tile window appears only on sva11 and it
doesn't
	span the whole screen (which it used to do previously). And it
doesn't seem
	like sva12 is even doing anything. I suspect this because sva11
flickers 
	when the client connects, but sva12 remains as it is.
	
	If I do the reverse and connect the client to sva12, then model
window appears
	on sva12 and sva11 seems to do nothing.
	
	Is there anything I am missing ? 
	I am using Paraview 3.2.1.
	
	Thanks,
	Manju

	What you are trying to do does not work because ParaView is not
supposed
	to run like that. When running in client/server mode, ParaView
connects
	to process 0 of the server, and nothing else. All communication
with the 
	client goes through process 0, and process 0 of the server uses
the MPI
	interconnect to pass data to and from the other nodes in the
server.
	
	ParaView is implemented in this way for convenience and
scalability. It 
	is not scalable to have every process in the server to connect
to the
	client because all communication will eventually have to go
through the
	same network interface on the client side. Also, the MPI
interconnect on 
	the server is almost always faster than the socket communication
between
	client and server.

Dear all


Hi guys, I have a huge problem, I have configured mpich, I built a 2 node
cluster - just a prototype ), I managed to configure mpich.

I could run files like cpilog and hello, and I am getting response from both
nodes. The problem is, i cant seem to run pmandel ( mpe -library examples ),
I wanted to run this file as I thought only if I can test a parallel graphic
program, I can move to installing Paraview ( as this requires parallel
graphics, i am thinking of creating one Paraview server and client )

But pmandel keeps giving error with the display.

My questions :

1) Do I really need to test pmandel, I think I have missed out some option
thingy during the mpich configuration.But of course any guide would be VERY
useful. I really hope someone can help me out

2) Should I just go ahead and configure Paraview, I have installed
everything as found in this site
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

3) Is there any other guide that I can use.

Thanks. I hope someone can help me out, I am very much a beginner.

Subject: [Paraview] Release of the "Distributed and Unified Numerics
 Environment" (DUNE) Software
In-Reply-To: <b05971d10801080208u614b7cf6v1655ae5ea61b4586@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <47836B1D.3090904@gmx.de>

We are pleased to announce the release of Version 1.0 of the
"Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment" (DUNE).

DUNE is a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
with grid-based methods. It supports the easy implementation of methods
like Finite Elements (FE), Finite Volumes (FV), and also Finite
Differences (FD).

DUNE is free software licensed under the GPL (version 2) with a
so-called "runtime exception".  This licence is similar to the one under
which the libstdc++ libraries are distributed. Thus it is possible to
use DUNE even in proprietary software.


For further information, have a look at our website
http://www.dune-project.org

The framework consists of a number of modules which are downloadable
as separate packages. The current core modules are:

dune-common
-----------
contains the basic classes used by all DUNE-modules. It provides some
infrastructural classes for debugging and exception handling as well
as a library to handle dense matrices and vectors.

dune-grid
---------
defines nonconforming, hierarchically
nested, multi-element-type, parallel grids in arbitrary space
dimensions. Graphical output with several packages is available,
e.g. file output to IBM data explorer and VTK (parallel XML format for
unstructured grids). The graphics package Grape has been integrated in
interactive mode.

dune-istl (Iterative Solver Template Library)
---------
provides generic sparse matrix/vector classes and a variety of solvers
based on these classes. A special feature is the use of templates to
exploit the recursive block structure of finite element matrices at
compile time. Available solvers include Krylov methods, (block-)
incomplete decompositions and aggregation-based algebraic multigrid.

I?m not familiar with pmandel, so I can?t help you there.  However, I
usually just run glxgears under mpirun to test the X connections of a
parallel job.  glxgears is not a parallel program, but you can still launch
it under mpirun and verify that each process can open an OpenGL window on
its local graphics hardware.  If that works, I would try compiling and
running ParaView.  The Build and Install page you point to is a good
reference.  You should also consult
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server for help on setting up
the server.

I have written a server manager plugin that uses Qt and it was complaining
about a missing symbol when scripting with python.  To fix it I needed to
add the QtCore library when linking the plugin.  How do I add libraries when
using the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro in cmake?

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN() will add the Qt libraries for you if you pass in any 
GUI_* arguments.

Otherwise if you still want to link with QtCore, you can simply do a 
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MyPlugin QtCore) after your call to 
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN().

Hi Berk,

Many thanks for your hints.
After linking ParaView with OSMESA and using the option
"--use-offscreen-rendering" to start the server it works fine.
Only the client main window appears, now, and all the subdomains
are drawn in this window.

Regards.

Message-ID: <c9adba420801090402h5afb6b7fvde0ffd5498b5bfe4@mail.gmail.com>

I've found a problem in the latest CVS version of Paraview.  The example
program ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/Reader does not add the extra file type
when trying to open a file.

Another problem I have found is that the reader from the plugin appears in
the "Sources" menu (this was the same before I updated to the latest CVS
version).  Is there a way to stop this as it depends on the filename.

Regards,
Paul

Thanks.  That's just been fixed.

That's a bug too, as it shouldn't be in the sources menu.  I'll look 
into that soon.

Message-ID: <D2D9B50F-B0BD-43F5-81D0-FC4F7E0B69EB@arsc.edu>

I'm using pvpython to automate a visualization process on a Windows  
machine and I am getting errors that are stalling things. I pre- 
create the visualization with Paraview and save the result as a state  
file which I later use with pvpython to later generate a series of  
images. However, when the state file loads, I get a series of  
warnings that while they do not affect the end product do require  
clicking through the error window. Is there a way to squelch these  
warnings?

These are the the warnings that are being created:

Subject: [Paraview] Adding custom modules in PV 3.2.1
Message-ID: <4786006B.7030806@tp1.rub.de>

Hello,

I have tried to add a existing VTK class to ParaView, using the tutorial 
taken from the ParaView Wiki.
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend)
Neither using the Custom Filter Manager from the tools menu nor setting 
PV_INTERFACE_PATH
was succesful. Even the tutorial example does not work.
ParaView does not reply with an error message, it simply does nothing.
Has anybody a solution for this ?

The interface for adding features to ParaView changed significantly with
ParaView 3.0.  The instructions you are looking at are for ParaView 2.X.
To add the class, you must build a plugin.  Instructions for that are
also on the Wiki:

There's also this wiki page for extending ParaView by building your code 
into ParaView (as opposed to building a plugin).
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ExtendingParaView
Though, you can do more with Plugins.

Change
new QPushButton("TEST", p);
to
new QPushButton("TEST", this);

So the button is a child of the display panel, and not a child of its parent.

Message-ID: <47868934.2020700@hiwaay.net>


.... new to the list, howdy :-). I am trying to use ParaView to view 
results from an inhouse multi-block CFD code. I want to modify the code 
to dump results into a file that ParaView can easily import, such as the 
'native' ParaView data file. Are there any repositories of 
already-written code that I can access as example coding to complete 
this task ? Thanks in advance.

Hi,

  Is there a nightly build location for retrieving the latest build for
testing purposes.

  I didn't see any mention on the main Paraview page.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with running paraview on linux cluster
Message-ID: <20080111042129.3103.qmail@f5mail-236-219.rediffmail.com>

I have compiled ParaView3.2.1 on a linux cluster with OpenMPI. The compilations goes fine. I launch the pvserver as
/home/raashid/openmpi_install/bin/mpirun -np 5 -hostfile nodes ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

The pvserver starts without any problem and listens to paraview client

When I connect the paraview client on my linux desktop to the head node of the linux cluster, it shows the message "Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled." on a pop-up window with an OK button, by pushing OK button the waring message disappears, but while trying to visualize large geometries all the resulting rendering is done on Client, instead of server and the memory usage on the client shoots up and client system becomes unusable.

A similar problem was reported on the mailing list previously 
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-November/006400.html)
and it was suggested to change the permissions on your X server.

Can someone please tell me how to do it ?

Thank you for the reply, yeap I managed to run X windows on each
machine, I edited the ssh_config file and changed X11 forwarding to
yes. But all I did was type xclock, glxgears and I can view the x
files. When I try running this command

-- >Master :/usr/bin/ #     /root/mpich-1.2.7p1/bin/mpirun -np 2 glxgears

I get this error--
/usr/bin/glxgears: Unsupported option '-p4pg'.
usage:  /usr/bin/glxgears [options]
-display        Set X11 display for output.
-info           Print additional GLX information.
-singletooth    Draw only one tooth for each gear (for debugging etc.).
-h              Print this help page.
-v              Verbose output.


--> and when I try with pmandel, I get this error

/root/mpich-1.2.7p1/bin/mpirun -np 2 pmandel

Could not open display
Failed to connect to Master.localhost.localdomain:0 from
Master.localhost.localdomain
Rank 0 could not connect to the display. Exiting.

should I do something with xauth, I already edited ssh_config file.
I even did the startx, xhost + and setting the display variable.

I am using Open Suse 10.3

Message-ID: <1200038093.5139.7.camel@nz23161.ukl.uni-freiburg.de>

Dear list,

I searched the paraview and vtk web sites, but could not find a good
answer whether there is an import filter that can read NIfTI 3D image
files. It does not seem to be in standard Paraview, but other vtk/itk
based medical imaging solutions seem support this format.
I would be grateful for any advice how to activate support for this file
format if it is already implemented. If its not, I will try to implement
an import filter myself.

Regards,

Message-ID: <478737B9.8040000@gmx.de>

Hello,

Does anyone has more informations about the release of the update of
ParaView Guide to v3.2. Will it take couple of days, weeks or months
until ist is available?
I like the wiki, but having a book is sometimes more complete and easier
to read.

I can only find the following at http://www.paraview.org/New/help.html:
"The online help is a reference the user interface elements and
algorithms available in ParaView. If you need more in-depth
documentation, consider buying the ParaView Guide
<http://www.kitware.com/products/paraviewguide.html> published by
Kitware Inc. <http://www.kitware.com> The current edition covers
ParaView v2.4. We are working on updating it for v3.2."

Greetings
Jens

Subject: [Paraview] Intra-zonal surfaces
Message-ID: <478778D1.9090104@cscs.ch>

When I load a complex CFD dataset with several dozen zones, I create a 
multiblock data structure which has one dataset per zone/volume.

When visualizing this as a surface only and with transparency turned on. 
The faces between zones are visible as artifacts inside the volume where 
the zones abut. I was wondering if back face culling would remove these, 
but of course, there are font faces there too.

Is there any way of coaxing d3 or similar filter to generate ghost cells 
that can be used to overcome these artifacts.
or
I am thinking that if I join all cells into a single unstructured grid 
(in parallel if necessary) then these surface cells will disappear (but 
perhaps there is a solution I have missed). Is there a filter to append 
all the zones into one already present in ParaView - like AppendFilter 
for a multiblock->single unstructured grid.

Thanks

JB

John,

I am afraid that there is no good way to do what you want right now.
There is no filter that is able to directly determine which external
faces of each block are actually abutting or are inside another block.
You could use tools like D3 or Clean to Grid, but as you suspect you
first have to cram everything in a single unstructured grid.  Right now
there is no filter to do that either.  Writing one would be trivial, and
there has been talk on this list for doing it.  I think no one has done
it because it is generally best to avoid doing so whenever possible.

Does your CFD dataset happen to look like a brick?  If so, you can fake
the operation with 6 slice filters on the boundaries of the data.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with running paraview on linux cluster

 

I have compiled ParaView3.2.1 on a linux cluster with OpenMPI. The
compilations goes fine. I launch the pvserver as
/home/raashid/openmpi_install/bin/mpirun -np 5 -hostfile nodes
./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

The pvserver starts without any problem and listens to paraview client

When I connect the paraview client on my linux desktop to the head node
of the linux cluster, it shows the message "Display is not accessible on
the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled." on a pop-up window
with an OK button, by pushing OK button the waring message disappears,
but while trying to visualize large geometries all the resulting
rendering is done on Client, instead of server and the memory usage on
the client shoots up and client system becomes unusable.

A similar problem was reported on the mailing list previously 
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-November/006400.html)
and it was suggested to change the permissions on your X server.

Can someone please tell me how to do it ?

I'm not sure if you are asking (1) "How do I get nightly sources?" (2)
"How do I get nightly binary distributions?" or (3) "How do I contribute
to the nightly dashboard tests?"  I'll answer each one.

 

1.	You have anonymous access to the ParaView CVS repository where
you can get the current sources or from any point in the past.
Instructions are at the bottom of the ParaView download page:
http://www.paraview.org/New/download.html. 
2.	Binary releases are not made nightly.  The nightly builds do not
package up their sources.  If you want binaries, you will have to go
back to the latest release (or build it yourself, of course).
3.	The ctest command will do most of the work for you, but you will
have to set up some scripts to describe your local system.  See section
8.8 of the CMake book (Setting up Automated Dashboard Clients) for
details.  There may also be information on the CMake Wiki.

Uh, sure.  Sounds good.  D3 clearly needs some updating, so hack away.

 

-Ken

 

BTW, D3 will find duplicate points and merge them together.  If you have
global point ids, that can make the process faster and more reliable.

Thanks for confirming what I suspected. As it is, I'm just finishing
vtkMultiBlockUnstructuredGridAppend
which iterates over all the leaf nodes and appends all Unstructured
Grids into a single dataset (dumps any other dataset types that may be
present). Immensely wasteful of space, but I'll just run it once and
save the surface generated by vtkGeometry filter for later use.

Since D3 will find ghost cells for a single UnstructuredGrid that is
split across processors - I will consider making a modified version
which accepts a multiblock dataset (i.e. different leaf nodes of a
compound dataset) and operates that way (D3 doesn't expect points to be
duplicated does it?). Not sure how much work that would be - but in
principal we only need to fool D3 into taking data from leaf nodes of a
dataset rather than pieces of a dataset.

That will work, yes?

JB

Hi William,

I don't know which programming language your code uses, 
but if it uses fortran you can try this fortran native 
library:

Hey Dave,

Did you ever get a chance to look into this possible bug in  
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader?

If I use that reader in Python, I can see that (as in ParaView) the  
GlobalIds have been set for my unstructured grid point data, but they  
are "int" type.

Today I was able to use the Python Programmable Filter within ParaView  
to read those "int" GlobalIds into a vtkIdTypeArray and (after a  
shallow copy of the input) set the filter output GlobalIds to this new  
array. After this, all the Global ID stuff seems to work fine, so I  
think it really is an issue with the reader.

Sorry I'm not experienced enough to take a look at the reader myself.
-Eric

I am after number (2), thanks for the information.

I am after number (2) because my volume visualization experience with the
current version 3.2 has been a little limited as in there is a long pause
between screen update.

I was hoping that the HEAD may have resolve the problem I am encountering.

I am new to ParaView and need understand it's interactive volume
visualization capabilities so that I can make appropriate recommendation to
it's usage and deployment among my colleagues.

The other visual display like isosurface is fine and interactive, it's just
the volume visualization that seems to pause every time we move the mouse to
interact with the display.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about paraview's scalability. 
Message-ID: <20080114123027.11341.qmail@f5mail-236-219.rediffmail.com>

I have finally compiled ParaView3.2.1 on a cluster with OSMesa and mpi support. It works without any X server problem on 8 nodes. 
I run paraview as 

/usr/local/openmpi-1.2.4/bin/mpirun -np 8 --x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/raashid/src/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH --mca btl ^openib,mvapi -hostfile nodes ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

I have generated a vtk-xml structured grid file with about 48 million cells (file size about 800MB) which I am able to visualize without any problem when I run pvserver on 8 nodes. I have an ensight file with 33 million cells (Unstructured grid, generated by another software, but is a lot larger in terms of disk space usage about 2.1GB). ParaView fails  while trying to load this file. pvserver crashes when the memory usage on the headnode of the cluster is about 20% to total available memory. 

Are the only some file formats which can be read and visualized in parallel efficiently ? 

I have checked the instructions given in 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server
about paraview's parallel rendering set-up, and everything appears to be working as suggested.

Message-ID: <b05971d10801140609x39bd0edaq8ea41f725c86909f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I managed to install all the requirements for Paraview, I have
installed MPICH and LAM/MPI and am using 2 node machines ( a beawoulf
cluster ). Anyway, just a curious thought, and some questions that i
would really like to know as I will be shifting this into a 32 node
cluster.

a) I have configured LAM/MPI, but am having problem with the
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH and MPI_LIBRARY  not found. I have installed it into
my home directory, and I am not root.

b) Should I just switch to OpenMPI, also.. ( how does it make a
difference to the installation of Paraview ), Any notes or tutorial I
can read, i have tried searching the net but there is not much.

c) do I really need an extra mpi library or is MPICH good enough.

Sorry, if the questions are too basic but i really need help. And I
think this first phase is really important for me, i cant change the
MPI at the last minute ). I will be configuring  it on an
heterogeneous cluster later on.

Thanks.

Hi,
i had the problem that ParaView 3.2.1 does not compile with Qt 4.3.3 because a CMakeLists.txt
entry in the subdir Qt does not check for Qt versions greater then 4.2.*.
I had to fix this entry manually.

Change the entry in ParaView3.2.1/Qt/CMakeLists.txt
from

STRING(REGEX MATCH "^4\\.2\\.[0-9]+" qt_version_tmp "${QTVERSION}")

to

STRING(REGEX MATCH "^4\\.[2-3]\\.[0-9]+" qt_version_tmp "${QTVERSION}")


ParaView compiles without problems on my OpenSUSE 10.3 32Bit as well as OpenSUSE 64Bit 
machine with Qt 4.3.3.

Best regards
Soeren

Make sure that qmake for Qt 4.3.3 is in your path BEFORE that of 4.2.1
and re-run cmake. I recommend cleaning all of your build tree first.

If they are not found that only means they were not in one of the standard 
places that cmake checks. I doubt it checks your home directory. So just set 
those values manually with ccmake or cmake -i.

I think ParaView will work with any MPI library. The important question is 
which version of MPI works best on your hardware? That is, which produces the 
fastest results without errors or failures.

> c) do I really need an extra mpi library or is MPICH good enough.

Use only one, whichever works best.

What problem?  You should be able to use the ccmake UI to point to the
include directory and the libmpi.a or libmpich.a (or equivalent .so
file).

That's up to you.  Our cluster administrators moved to OpenMPI because
it is supposed to be faster that MPICH, but I have never done any
performance tests on ParaView to know one way or another.

ParaView compiles with OpenMPI just like any other MPI implementation.
The only caveat is that you need to use the libmpi_cxx.so library in
addition libmpi.so.  The reason is that even though ParaView does not
use any of the C++ MPI bindings, the OpenMPI version of mpi.h
automatically includes some of them.  It's easiest to just add the
libmpi.so to the MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY CMake variable.

> c) do I really need an extra mpi library or is MPICH good enough.

Not unless you are getting link errors.  One of our previous clusters
used Myrinet, and the version of MPICH that uses it required linking to
the gm library.  But if ParaView compiles with your installation of
MPICH without any linker errors, then you don't need to put anything for
the MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY variable.

Kent answered your questions well enough.  However, I suspect question 
"c" may result from a misunderstanding of MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY.  This does 
not mean an entire extra MPI implementation.  Like Kent says, just pick 
one, either LAM or OpenMPI.  Use the full path of the main library file 
(e.g., libmpi.so) for MPI_LIBRARY.  If your chosen MPI implementation 
has other libraries that require inclusion, then add those to 
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY.

Sorry Eric,
I have not. Would you mind please submitting a bug report, assigned to
me, under the ParaView project? I or someone else should get to it
before the 3.4 release in the next few months.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualization problem with very large Ensight file
Message-ID: <20080115081921.22591.qmail@f5mail11.rediffmail.com>

I have compiled ParaView3.2.1 on a cluster with OSMesa and openmpi
support. It works without any X server problem on 18 nodes.
I run paraview as

/usr/local/openmpi-1.2.4/bin/mpirun -np 18 --x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/raashid/src/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH --mca btl ^openib,mvapi -hostfile nodes ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

I have generated a vtk-xml structured grid file with about 48 million
cells (file size about 800MB) which I am able to visualize without any
problem when I run pvserver on 18 nodes. While reading the files
memory usage in all the nodes go up and all the nodes seem to balance
the load.

However when I try to open an ensight file with 33 million cells
(Unstructured grid, generated by another software, but is a lot larger
in terms of disk space usage about 2.1GB). ParaView fails while trying
to load this file. pvserver crashes when the memory usage on the
headnode of the cluster is about 20% to total available memory. Also
on all other nodes, besides the head node paraview does not seem to
consume any memory. The erro message is as follows:

[raashid@n0 bin]$ /usr/local/openmpi-1.2.4/bin/mpirun -np 18 --x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/raashid/src/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH --mca btl ^openib,mvapi -hostfile nodes ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

Due to large size of the ensight file and associated memory related

simple vtk program by reading the ensight file by vtkEnSight6Reader
and writring it through vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter.

Please suggest me how to over come this problem.

Hello,

Is it possible to visualize VTK tensor data in Paraview? If not, is
this something which is planned to be included in the future releases?

I found this post

The original post from 12/4/2007:

This was entered as change request 6129 on 12/5/2007 and has become an urgent

(1) Display a full-color 2D map to establish the location of mountains, foliage

(2) In front of (1) display a plane of data using a colormap whose opacity

I'd be happy to dig into the source to enable the opacity settings in the

Hi Robert,

Just an idea... Try to extract the point coordinate components, using 
the calculator, and apply the threshold filter over the extracted datasets.

Subject: [Paraview] How to create a parallele reader for paraview ?
Message-ID: <478F256C.6070306@artenum.com>

Hello,

I would like to create a parallele reader that could be used in a
standard manner by paraview.

My problem, is that I'm not sure how paraview manage it's pipeline
distribution. (when it's deployed in MPI over a cluster)

I think, (please correct me if I'm wrong)
that paraview 3 use the VTK 5 streaming API for the standard reader to
split input data among each MPI process by selecting on piece for each
MPI process and by simply applying the processing pipeline behind each
selected piece.
Or if the distribution is not made by the reader, the
vtkDistributedDataFilter is used.

The thing is, I don't want each reader to read the file. I need only one
master reader that will generate n dataset for the n processes. And by
now, I don't know how to manage this distribution to allow paraview to
add the processing pipeline behind each distributed dataset in a
standard manner. I wanted to use the vtkTransmitXXXPiece classes to 
forward each piece to each process but I can't find any sample on how to 
make it work with paraview.

If someone has exemples or informations I would really apreciate,

Thanks,

Seb

Hello,

just to be sure, I ask ... have you constrained the 3-dimensional 
velocity field to lie on the surface; i.e. have you projected the 
velocity vector on the plane? If you did, are you selecting the correct 
vector field in the streamline tab (the projected vectors, and not the 
3d-vector)?

Seb,

It sounds like you have a pretty good grasp of how parallel readers work
in VTK/ParaView.  A reader is expected to respond to the "extent"
request that comes from the pipeline, which I think is what you mean by
the "streaming API."  It is used to both specify pieces that are
streamed in as well as specify pieces per process in a data parallel
mode (such as used in ParaView).

I cannot think of a reader that works exactly as you describe, but there
are some that do use a vtkMuliProcessController (vtkSpyPlotReader is
one).  You can get a controller with
vtkMultiProcessController::GetGlobalController().  ParaView will
initialize this global controller with the MPI controller that contains
MPI_COMM_WORLD.

Does that answer your question?

-Ken

Thanks Kenneth for your feed back.

You have pretty well explained what I meant with the "streaming API".
But to be really sure of how paraview will manage its readers.

Could you correct the following scenario and questions ?

Context:
- We suppose that Paraview is deployed over a cluster of "n" nodes

1) The user want to read a file. (click and select files in the menu)
2) Paraview create "n" instance of the reader. One instance on each 
cluster node.
3) Paraview will apply the same data processing behind each reader by 
setting in vtkInformation of each specific request
    - vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER()  equal to 
the MPI_ProcessId
    - and vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() 
equal to the total number of nodes. ("n" for us)
    - and something about GHOST_LEVEL depending on the need of the 
filter involved in the pipeline.

If so, this mean that each reader is reading indepently the same file 
and each one is reading and extracting its requesting part ?
The reader don't need to know anything about MPI. Paraview manage 
everything.
This also mean that the file must be available on the same path on each 
node of the cluster ?
I suppose that the reader will have to provide the requested level of 
ghost cell ?

Which is unfortunately not the behaviour that I'm looking for... ;-)
I will look at the vtkSpyPlotReader and will come back to you if I have 
more question.

Thanks a lot for your support,

Seb

That's pretty much it.  The only minor thing missing is that the reader
should set vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES()
in the output information during the RequestInformation pipeline phase.
You usually set this to -1 to signal that you support any number of
pieces.

That's the original idea.  In theory, it should not matter whether you
are part of an MPI job or some serial process is streaming data.  In
practice, however, it can make a big difference.  Thus, it is becoming
quite common for reader to be "MPI-aware" so that they may coordinate
the reads.

> This also mean that the file must be available on the same path on

> node of the cluster ?

Most people design their clusters to have a file system that mounted on
all the nodes and thus the files will be accessible everywhere.  It
sounds like you have a file accessible to node 0 only and want to stream
data from there to the other nodes.  That should work OK if that's how
you design your reader.  Just be aware that the built in readers will
not work that way.

> I suppose that the reader will have to provide the requested level of
> ghost cell ?

Ideally, the reader will produce ghost cells, and the readers of
structured data typically do because they are easy to find.  However, I
think all the unstructured data readers (those that ready vtkPolyData or
vtkUnstructuredGrid) do not produce ghost cells unless they are
conveniently accessible.  It is usually difficult to code and can take
longer than a user is willing to wait.  In that case, ignore the ghost
cell requests.  Use the D3 filter if you need to generate them.

Although it does not fit exactly within what was originally intended
with the parallel VTK parallel readers, I think you should just try to
do what you originally wanted.  Nothing you have said so far leads me to
believe that it will not work.

Subject: [Paraview] NULL qApp in Paraview Plugin
Message-ID: <478F989E.5080901@mcs.anl.gov>


I've written a plugin for Paraview, following the directions at

    http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo

and it works fine with the Paraview executable I've built.  I'd like for 
it to also work with the official Paraview releases, but in that case 
Paraview crashes trying to load the plugin.

That's because the plugin code makes a call against qApp (as does the 
Paraview plugin example), but qApp is NULL.  So my questions are:

- Is there a related build dependency that I need to consider?  (I've 
already ensured that my plugin uses CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=='release')

- Should I be able to successfully build plugins for loading by the 
release code?  (I expect that's the long term plan, but wonder if it is 
not yet possible.)


Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Tom

Did you build your plugin against the same Qt version and same ParaView code 
that the ParaView releases were made from?

Its possible to have a NULL qApp if a different version of Qt is used when 
building the plugin.

I'd probably check in the debugger (even in release mode) what libraries are 
actually being used, after your plugin loads.

otool (I'm on OSX currently) reports the Qt version as 4.2.2:

        @executable_path/../Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui 
(compatibility version 4.2.0, current version 4.2.2)

which is what I used to build Paraview and my plugin.  I built the 
Paraview 3.1 source, built my plugin against it, and am subsequently 
trying to load the plugin with the released 3.1 executable.

No luck yet.  I'll report back if I find my way.

Thanks,
Tom

What does otool give you when you do it on the plugin?
Does it 
contain "@executable_path/../Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui"  or 
something else?

On the Mac, if its something else, you're going to get two instances of QtGui 
in the application.

otool against the plugin gives me:

        
/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.2/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui 
(compatibility version 4.2.0, current version 4.2.2)

admittedly a different path, but the same version.

That was why Clint asked you to run otool... Both ParaView and the plugin
need to refer to exactly the same Qt shared library file, not just the same
version with two different file references.

You need to run "install_name_tool" or set up your build so that your plugin
references the Qt shared library with the same name as ParaView.

Global qt state is not really global if you have two sets of qt shared
libraries loading.

Okay, that's clear, and now works.  Thanks for your help.

I'm now off to try to replicate the same success on Linux and Windows...

Subject: [Paraview] Python Automation: Representations & the Pipeline Browser
Message-ID: <000401c85959$0d1f84f0$275e8ed0$@wille@mytum.de>

Hello everyone,

 

 

I use python-created representations in my python shell-scripts and I would
like to have them linked with their corresponding item in the Pipeline
Browser. At the moment, creating a representation on a proxy will not
trigger the "eye"-button next to the proxy in the Pipeline Browser. Can
somebody explain how the Pipeline Browser links its own GUI-created
representations with the browser entries?

 

 

Thank you,

Alex

Hello again,


careful reading of the servermanager-documentation did the job: Representations have to be registered in the "representations"-group to be linked with the GUI. Sorry for bothering you...

Subject: [Paraview] Heap corruption error in ParaView when using VS2008
Message-ID: <3331.71.179.225.195.1200665265.squirrel@webmail.cis.jhu.edu>


I am having trouble getting Paraview to run with VS2008. It is
giving me heap corruption errors. This is what I get when I try to debug
it.

CVS head gives

HEAP[paraview.exe]: Invalid Address specified to RtlValidateHeap(
07B30000, 087565D8 )
Windows has triggered a breakpoint in paraview.exe.

This may be due to a corruption of the heap, which indicates a bug in
paraview.exe or any of the DLLs it has loaded.

This occurs on startup and manifests in the dispatch area of the main
event loop

and Version 3.2.1 gives

HEAP[paraview.exe]: Invalid Address specified to RtlValidateHeap(
07AA0000, 0ADAD600 )
Windows has triggered a breakpoint in paraview.exe.

This may be due to a corruption of the heap, which indicates a bug in
paraview.exe or any of the DLLs it has loaded.

This occurs even earlier in startup where the Sources menu is being built.

I am not sure how to track these down as the corruption seems to be
occurring at some point prior to the error manifesting itself in the
debugger.

Message-ID: <47910CCF.3000208@arl.army.mil>

I build ParaView 3.2.1 on my redhat4 64 linux machine and it looks like 
the animation or the way data is loaded is no longer working or has 
changed since Paraview 2.x.

If I load ParaViewData3.2 test data 
"singleSphereAnimation_source93T0000.vtp" with Paraview 2.x the data is 
loaded and when I hit the start animation button Paraview loops through 
each of the vtp files (0-10). 

If I load ParaViewData3.2 test data 
"singleSphereAnimation_source93T0000.vtp" with Paraview 3.2.1 the data 
is loaded and when I hit the start animation button nothing happens. It 
seems like Paraview 3.2.1 does not recognize/link the other vtp files 
(0-10).  Is this expected behavior for Paraview 3.2.1?

Yes. Because XML-based VTK files support time natively and through pvd
files, we decided to no longer support file series of XML-based VTK
files. File series work for legacy VTK files as well as some other
formats that have no time support. If you have a series of vtp files,
you need to write a pvd file that points to them with the appropriate
time values to load them as a series.

Is this also true for Xdmf files, I am seeing similar behavior?

It is. However, this is easy to fix. Do we need to have file series
support for Xdmf? Jerry is adding support for time to the Xdmf format.
If we support file series, which one has priority, native time or file
series?

Berk,

I am working on an extension for the file series reader class that deals
with data readers that support time.  It might work for this instance,
too.

I have a similar interest too e.g. Mental Ray, RenderMan etc.

I'd be interested in what you find out.

I remember reading a page (wiki) on writing plugins for ParaView.

I guess the important information is how to obtain the scene graph and walk
the tree.

Hopefully, the point at which we obtain the scene graph is after where all
the filters have been applied making it more straight forward. I have done
something similar for OpenDX which I'd like to apply again to ParaView.

We will (probably) add support for X3D and VRML before the 3.4
release.  You can also export geometry objects one by one but it is
probably to tedious for re-creating a scene in povray.

Hello.

Is it possible to use a similar tool to pick filter in Paraview 3.2.1 ?
I just want to pick two points in a volume and know the distance between these two points.

Thanks in advance.

This doesn't surprise me. I applied threshold, extracting only value
8. The resulting unstructured grid is 21 million cells and uses 1.14
GB of memory. You are probably running out of memory before anything
even goes to the GPU. Depending on what you are trying to do,
isosurface may be  a better choice. Anything that doesn't convert the
volume to unstructured grid.

I have created a plugin that will extract a surface from a structured mesh.  The inputs are the block, plane (i, j, or k), index (of the selected plane) and ranges for the two other planes.  This all works but I would like to set ranges for the values.  I have tried to create a subclass of vtkSMIntRangeDomain and using it as the domain but it is complaining that it cannot create the object and asks if I am using the correct xml element - is there CMake macro I am missing?.. or an XML file I need to create?  I have linked in the object file to the plugin...

Also, are there any docs about creating domains? - I am not sure how I will reference other values when I do get it working - everything is going to be dependent on the selected block and the index/ranges will be dependent on the plane too.

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

Message-ID: <fd5546a50801211928u3de47c05x25d6492cdbe7b12f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am using ParaView 3.2.1 and Linux Ubuntu. I am trying to output an
animation based on a collection of about 2000 time frames. The output
file(s) get corrupted. I have tried exporting as AVI and JPEG but the
same issue happens. After 1 or two frames, they go black, and the
remainder of the movie is either black frames or grainy looking (like
static on digital TV). I am not sure what the problem is. I have tried
cutting the amount of time steps to 500 and I still get the same
issue. Any recommendations?

Thanks,

Alessandro

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with visualing large Ensight file - please help
	me.
Message-ID: <20080122140417.11774.qmail@f5mail-237-211.rediffmail.com>

I have a big problem while trying to visualize large multi-block
Unstructured grid dataset which is in the form of ASCII Ensight files.
(16 million cells 2.1GB disk usage).

When I start ParaView(3.1.2, complied on a Linux cluster with OpenMPI)
it starts without any problem, but ParaView fails while trying to load
this file. pvserver crashes when the memory usage on the headnode of
the cluster is about 20% to total available memory. Also on all other
nodes, besides the head node ParaView does not seem to consume any
memory. I have reported the problem on the ParaView mailing list on
15-01-2007.

However when I start the pvserver only on one node, the ParaView loads
the Ensight file without crashing, since the single node does not
sufficiently handle this large amount of data, I tried to save the
loaded data in some other file format using ParaView. But for this
data set only the option of VTK Multi-Block files is available, on
saving that I get 1 .vtm file and 11 separate *.vtu files.

Now when I restart the ParaView on 10 nodes and try loading this vtm
file, it loads properly but all the load(of memory) falls only on the
headnode of the cluster. If I perform any operation (Velocity glyphs
for example) all the load again falls only on headnode of the
cluster, this results in a very slow performance as well as risk of
crashing the entire cluster for memory expensive operations (like
isosurfaces).

According the ParaView Wiki:

"""Currently there are only a few readers that truly work in parallel:
VTK files (not legacy), partitioned legacy VTK files, ParaView data
files, HDF5 files, EnSight master server files, and raw (binary) files
can be read in parallel."""

Now what can I do with the current situation, there is no Ensight
Master-Server/HDF5 writer in VTK. Both VTK-XML and VTK-legacy file
formats don't support the multi-block data and the existing *.vtm file
does not seem to work properly when ParaView runs in parallel mode.

What can be the possible solution for the existing situations, can VTK
be of some help ? Or I have to create a new Parallel Reader for
ParaView.

Is it possible for you to post this data or a smaller version somewhere? I
need an Ensight file similar to your to experiment. It doesn't have to be
public, just accessible by Kitware.

Thanks for your answer Pei. Using FFMPEG works fine when I am able to
output the files. It is still giving me problems a certain amount of
frames in (jpg files) and creates similar effects as the export to
avi. So, it prolongs the creation of usable frames but nevertheless
stops working after a little while. Looking at the memory usage using
"top", I can see that my memory is going away at a rate of about
100MB/frame, and that is never freed (even after exiting paraview). I
am wondering if there is some sort of memory management problem with
the animation output.

Now, this wouldn't be too much of a big deal if I could tell paraview
to pick up where it left off (i.e. frame0100.jpg) and keep going until
the end, it always tries to start from the beginning (i.e.
frame0000.jpg). That's something else I noted.

My files are VTK files with a PVD file that has a collection node
(where I specify the corresponding timesteps). Correct me if I am
wrong, but I am supposed to output to each one of the files the mesh
structure (cells, nodes, offsets and type) each time I output a
timestep? I thought I could get around this and have one file that
describes the geometry, and have timesteps that only contain data
values but I am not sure how this would be done. I think that this
might have something to do with the memory problems.

Thanks,

Alessandro

There was an option in PV 2.6 called "cache geometry" where basically  
PV would load all your time steps into memory which was a problem for  
me. If you uncheck this box then PV will reuse the memory for each  
time step. This allows you to animate your entire data set but kills  
the performance of trying to playback the animation in real time from  
within PV. I would look for something similar in PV 3.

Mike,
thanks for your answer. I made sure that chache geometry was unchecked
and I am still getting the black screens. I never had that option
checked so the memory leaks are the same. Maybe I should try
installing 2.6...

The blank images could be related to the fact that we use offscreen 
rendering when saving animation images. Some cards/drivers have shown 
issues with the frame buffer object based offscreen rendering we use. 
Are you using binaries or have you built from source? In CVS paraview, 
we now have an option to disable offscreen rendering.  If you have built 
from source, I can send you a patch to disable offscreen rendering.

Last year I modified the PVD reader to do exactly that. It wasn't trivial. We 
and some of our users make use of this feature to save disk space but 
management has not yet approved it for public release.

Utkarsh,
I used the binary version first. I tried the HEAD of the CVS
repositor, compiled it and was able to run it but when I open my
dataset it hangs (it doesn't even give me the apply button.) I am not
sure if anybody else had that problem. Do send me the patch... I will
try to recompile and see what happens...

Thanks,

Alessandro

Utkarsh,
I tried recompiling ParaView 3.3 from CVS and I am still having the
same issue with VTU/PVD files. It actually opens fine the files that
come from the Examples folder from ParaView but these VTU/PVD files
that used to work in ParaView 3.2.1 don't work anymore. Different
format?

Hi Alessandro,

To help focus on the issue, why don't you try to reproduce the animation 
saving bug with an already provided dataset.
Try loading can.ex2 from eg, and saving the animation. Does that work, 
or are you still getting the blank images?

I am looking for a Paraview reader that will read a LIDAR point cloud in
(x,y,z) coordinates as a space or comma separated .txt file.
 
Does anyone know of such a reader?

You can use vtkParticleFilter but you will have to write an interface  
for ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Higher order elements
Message-ID: <50868.193.190.162.65.1201080447.squirrel@www5.vki.ac.be>

Hi all,

 I'm new to Paraview, so please excuse me if I'm asking questions that can
be answered easily. I tried to search the web and mailing list archives,
but found no answer whatsoever.
 First of all, I would like to know if Paraview is able to render
quadratic triangles. I created a sample vtk file with one quadratic
triangle (type 22), but instead of having an element with curvilinear
edges, I have four triangles (subelements of the higher order element).
Am I doing something wrong ?
 Second, if I understand it correctly, there used to be support for
postscript output in Paraview, but seems to be gone. Is it still possible
to generate eps  images or not ?
 Third, I would like to see the indexes of the nodes and elements of my
mesh. Is there a way to do this ?
 Thanks in advance.

                     Martin

Hello Martin,

Good luck with paraview a wonderful visualization tool!

Plotting finite element meshes with nodes
1. Creat nodes: in [Display] tab -> in [Style] -> [Representation] ->
[Points]
2. Creat edges: => [Filter] => [Alphabetical] => [Extract edges]
3. View edges with nodes: Activate Combine view of 1 and 2

Labelling node and element ID
1. Open Selection Inspector: [View] => [Selection Inspector]
2. Select nodes/cells to label: Either click [Select Cell On] icon on tool
bar and drag around the area OR => [Edit] =>[Select Cells On] and drag
around the area
3. View node and cell IDs: In [Selection Inspector] -> in [Diplay Style] ->
in [Cell Label] tab -> check [Visible] ->  in [Point Label] -> check
[Visible]
4. View more node and element IDs: do step 2

Saving in postscript
1. Save in any possible format from paraview
2. in opensource GIMP program open the saved figue and save in as many
formats as you like hahahahaha... (I do that in fact)

Thanks,
Hom Nath

If you are using paraview 3.2 or greater you could always write a python
programmable source, that does the reading.
If the file has a header with x/y/z this should work for you:

#!/usr/bin/env python

from paraview import vtk
import csv

output = self.GetOutput()

points = vtk.vtkPoints()
cells = vtk.vtkCellArray()

file = open("/home/rmaynard/Data/blockModel/fortuna.csv")

header = csv.reader(file).next() #get the header line
csvReader = csv.DictReader(file, header) #make a dict reader with the header
counter = 0 #need to keep track of the amount of cells
for line in csvReader:
  points.InsertNextPoint(float(line['x']), float(line['y']),
float(line['z']))   #add a point change the 'x' etc to what you have in your
header
  cells.InsertNextCell(1) #each point has its own cell
  cells.InsertCellPoint(counter)
  counter += 1

output.SetPoints(points) #need to set points
output.SetVerts(cells) #need to set cells as verts

To export from Paraview 2.6.2:

Normalize Paraview data from 0 to 1 with the calculator.
Save the normalized data in *.vtm format.
Open a new Paraview windows with the the normalized data.
Save the scene with the VRML format (*.wrl).
Use VRML2PDF3D Application to convert the VRML format to a 3D PDF.

Oh great, so the issue with animation is indeed offscreen rendering. 
I'll let some one who's more familiar with file formats answer your vtu 
file question.

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf questions
Message-ID: <4797686A.5090604@cscs.ch>

I am aware that others (who?) are working with xdmf and I have two 
specific questions I'd like to ask before diving in to make changes to 
read/writers

1) Has anyone given any consideration to time representation withing 
xdmf. Specifically, multiple time steps and the ongoing time support in 
vtk/paraview
I need to store multiple time steps preferably in the same file, but if 
one step per hdf5 file could be referenced from the xdmf xml that's be 
ok I suppose. I don't see ant references to TIME_etc vars in the code. 
If this is in development please let me know so that I can avoid 
duplication.

2) Data spaces and parallel write. I'd like to modify the xdmf writer to 
allow me to write pieces of volume data one by one  and specify the 
extents so that 8/16/64 blocks etc could be written into a single file.
Has anyone started work on this? I wuld again like to avoid duplication.

Many thanks

I use the standalone Python script given below to convert unsorted xyz  
point clouds to VTK data files, then load those in Paraview. I haven't  
bothered trying to implement this directly in Paraview but I can't  
imagine it would be to difficult.

Dear ParaView Users,

 I built client and server plugins using theparaview 3.x and it works fine when I run paraview that I built from
the sources.  I tried to load the same plugins using paraview binariesfrom the website. I get the following error message;

-----
The plugin uses incompatible Qt library.  Expected build key 'Windows msvc
release full-config', got 'Windows os-msvc2005 release full-config'
-----

I downloaded qt 4.2.3 pointed to by paraview website.  Have you seen such
an error message before and do you know how to resolve this issue ?

Please Advise,
Ravi

It looks like the paraview binaries are built with visual studio 2003.
Qt plugins won't load in those binaries unless you use the same compiler.
The error message indicates you're using 2005.

In view of this being such a common request, I have entered it into the
Mantis Bug Tracker as a feature request that vtkparticleReader be
incorporated into the current list of default readers. Hopefully this can be
easily done.

John,

I am currently adding a time facility to Xdmf. 
I'll update the wiki @ xdmf.org when I am finished
but basically time will be an additional element
which is a child of Grid. In simplest form :

<Grid GridType="Uniform" ...
     <Time Value="0.1" />

There is an XdmfTime object. time->GetTimeType() will return
XDMF_TIME_SINGLE in the above example. Others are :

#define XDMF_TIME_SINGLE    0x00
#define XDMF_TIME_UNIFORM   0x01
#define XDMF_TIME_HYPERSLAB 0x02
#define XDMF_TIME_FUNCTION  0x03

More complex :
<Grid  GridType="Collection" ....
             <Time TimeType="Uniform">
                 <DataItem Format="XML" Dimensions="5" DataType="Float">
                     1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5
                 </DataItem>
             </Time>
Both of these are working, as is :
	<Time Function="???" />
the time object doesn't do anything with it yet other than return a
string.

Here's some python from the test :

print 'Time Type = ', tt, ' : ', t.GetTimeTypeAsString() if(tt ==
XDMF_TIME_SINGLE) :
     print 'Time = ', t.GetValue()
     t.SetValue(99.0)
elif(tt == XDMF_TIME_FUNCTION) :
     print 'Function = ', t.GetFunction()
     t.SetFunction('Hello')
     print 'Function = ', t.GetFunction()
elif(tt == XDMF_TIME_UNIFORM) :
     a = t.GetArray()
     print 'Values = ', a.GetValues()
     a.SetValueFromFloat64(3, 99.0)

t.Build()
print t.Serialize()

Subject: [vtk-developers] xdmf questions

I am aware that others (who?) are working with xdmf and I have two
specific questions I'd like to ask before diving in to make changes to
read/writers

1) Has anyone given any consideration to time representation withing
xdmf. Specifically, multiple time steps and the ongoing time support in
vtk/paraview I need to store multiple time steps preferably in the same
file, but if one step per hdf5 file could be referenced from the xdmf
xml that's be ok I suppose. I don't see ant references to TIME_etc vars
in the code. 
If this is in development please let me know so that I can avoid
duplication.

2) Data spaces and parallel write. I'd like to modify the xdmf writer to
allow me to write pieces of volume data one by one  and specify the
extents so that 8/16/64 blocks etc could be written into a single file.
Has anyone started work on this? I wuld again like to avoid duplication.

Many thanks

JB

Message-ID: <e37de5890801241432ra8d4c60oaa7e3563a4d592a1@mail.gmail.com>

I'm replacing an application that previously used
vtkInputPort/vtkOutputPort.

I'm still using client server because I have large datasets (10-12GB), and
the GUI toolkits I'm using isn't 64 bit.
So I'm planning to use a 32bit client/64bit server.

I'm considering using Paraview's ServerManager, and I have a few questions:
Is there Doxygen posted somewhere for the ServerManager Library?
Are there c++ examples posted anywhere?
Can I connect an ImagePlaneWidget to a proxied server pipeline and have the
result work well if the server is local?
vtkParallel still has warnings about 32 bit/64 bit communications.  Am I
fine so long as I compile with vtkIdType 64 bit and don't use longs?

Hi,

I'm trying to get run the Plugin Examples provided by Paraview.

I get the plugins compiled and I can load them using the Plugin Manager 
in the tool menu (as described in 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo and
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ExtendingParaView)

I would like to have the plugins loaded automatically at paraview 
startup, so I set the PV_PLUGIN_PATH to point at the plugin folder. But 
the plugins will not be loaded.

Where exactly should PV_PLUGIN_PATH point at?

Thank you Enkelejda

Doxygen for Server Manager classes (and everything else in the ParaView
source) can be found at

 

  http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/html/index.html

 

If you look under the Applications directory in the ParaView source, you
will find a couple examples of "custom clients."

 

I'll leave the details of using 3D widgets to someone else.  There are
conventions in the representation/view SM classes to handle widgets.
You might want to look at vtkSMImplicitPlaneRepresentationProxy as an
example.

 

I am not aware of any problems with 32/64 bit issues between client and
server.  I added some fixes to the socket communicator before the

Subject: [Paraview] Server Manager

 

I'm replacing an application that previously used
vtkInputPort/vtkOutputPort.

I'm still using client server because I have large datasets (10-12GB),
and the GUI toolkits I'm using isn't 64 bit.
So I'm planning to use a 32bit client/64bit server. 

I'm considering using Paraview's ServerManager, and I have a few
questions:
Is there Doxygen posted somewhere for the ServerManager Library?
Are there c++ examples posted anywhere?
Can I connect an ImagePlaneWidget to a proxied server pipeline and have
the result work well if the server is local? 
vtkParallel still has warnings about 32 bit/64 bit communications.  Am I
fine so long as I compile with vtkIdType 64 bit and don't use longs?

Jerry,

Thanks for this information. I had a peek at the xdmf list archives as 
suggested by Berk and have digested what you've written below.

#define XDMF_TIME_SINGLE    0x00
ok - this seems straightforward

#define XDMF_TIME_UNIFORM   0x01
ok, a range of values specified as a vector

#define XDMF_TIME_HYPERSLAB 0x02
Not sure what this will be. Why not also XDMF_TIME_RANGE to allow a dataset to be valid for all times between t1,t2. Is this functionality going to be provided by TIME_FUNCTION or perhaps by Hyperslab.

#define XDMF_TIME_FUNCTION  0x03
ditto.

If several meshes exist inside a dataset and some have time values and 
others do noit, will the default behaviour be to assume those with no 
time attribute exist for all time values requested?

I need to start using this stuff as of yesterday-ish. Do I use the 
/cvsroot/Xdmf reporitory at kitware to get it, or is it mirrored in 
pv/vtk-utilities etc?

I am more than willing to help out, as I need to transfer a ton of 
binary fortran data into something more sensible and I'd like it to be 
hdf5 with xdmf wrappers. I will be working on the vtkXdmfReader 
andWriter classes and will add time reading support if nobody else is on 
it already.

Please feel free to transfer this discussion to an alternative list...

Thanks

JB

Message-ID: <82f536810801250752v53e96826o3d49cef254673832@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two questions about basic filters in Paraview:

1) how could I compute magnitude image given vector image? I need to
see the points where magnitude is larger than some threshold, and the
threshold filter does not accept vector values.

2) is it possible in Paraview to do logical operations on binary
images? If I have two binary images, is it possible to display only
those pixels, which are non-zero in both of them?

I don't see filters to do these operations, but I was wondering if
there any other ways.

Thanks

Look at the Calculator filter for 1 and maybe 2.

Hi Kent,

Thanks for pointing me to Calculator. Indeed, I was able to do (1),
but, as I understand, Calculator operates on one image only. Is there
any way for it to take multiple inputs?

No but there is a workaround if both images have the same geometry. Use Append 
Attributes to combine the images so that the result has the data from both. 
Then connect the result to Calculator.

If the name of the data is the same in both images Append Attributes will only 
keep one of them. In this case run one through another instance of Calculator 
to change its name then into Append Attributes.

Dear List

I have a reader (compiled as plugin with the CVS head of PV3) creating
two output ports, working very well on a single node. The second port is
functional and can be connected to other filters.

when running in parallel, with the second output port creation turned
OFF, no problem either.

when running in parallel, with the second output port turned ON, the
pvservers crash *after* I have exited from RequestData() with the
message:

ERROR: In ./ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x10eb010): Server Connection Closed!

MPI Application rank 0 killed before MPI_Finalize() with signal 11
ERROR: In ./ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 351
vtkServerConnection (0x10eb010): Server could failed to gather
information.

Does anyone have a hint on what could be going wrong? I know executing
of my reader gets all the way to the end, prints out a message as it
exits RequestData.

The only reader I could find producing 2 output ports is the prism
plugin, but I did not figure out where to load data...so I have not
tested it in parallel.

Thanks for any tip
Jean

Actually, I encountered the same problem, and I only have one compiler
(VC 2005).  I suspect it might be the fact that one compiles Qt using
the qconfigure.bat file and it compiles at the command line.  I then
used CMake & the GUI to build both ParaView and my reader plugin as per
the Wiki instructions.  Of course, I could have messed up a setting
somewhere, but I wouldn't know where.  I'm pretty sure I selected the
correct compiler in qconfigure.bat and I know I selected the correct
compiler in CMake for both PV & the reader code.

However, I did come up with a quick fix.  In your Qt directory, edit
src/corelib/global/qconfig.h
find the QT_BUILD_KEY line and replace the "Windows os-msvc2005 release
full-config" with "Windows msvc release full-config" .

Then reconfigure (from scratch) your plugin and recompile.  You don't
need to reconfigure or recompile Qt or PV.

This may be me being stubborn, but I'd rather encapsulate the way I handle
large and/or remote data away from the rest of my application.

Is there a c++ example anywhere that is like this python example:

from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect("kamino")
>>>Connection (kamino:11111)
s = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
s.UpdatePipeline()
# Get the whole sphere. DO NOT DO THIS IF THE DATA IS LARGE otherwise
# the client will run out of memory.
allsphere = servermanager.Fetch(s)
>>>getting appended
>>>use append poly data filter
allsphere.GetNumberOfPolys()

(page 17 of http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf )
Basically I want to create a pipeline to shrink my data, then either fetch
the whole thing to the client or hook that into my local pipeline's Image
Plane Widget.  At this point I don't want to use Paraview's views.

You will need to write a C++ or python reader to process the data.

If you give more information about the structure of the data, I might have
python reader that can generate the triangles.

Subject: [Paraview] How to get *.wrl files correctly displayed with paraview
Message-ID: <479A47DD.80506@lanl.gov>

I would like to learn about how to display the supported *.wrl files 
(VRML V2.0 format) in paraview 3.2.1.
I can load the data file and use glyphs to display individual atoms. 
However, paraview does not
recognize different types of atoms, which have different coloring in the 
VRML format.

Any ideas and suggestions on how to get paraview to display different 
types of atoms properly
are appreciated.

Thanks - Matthias

Hi Jean,

The GaussianCubeReader in Paraview produces 2 port output. I tried 
loading m4_TotalDensity.cube dataset (provided in VTK Data) in parallel 
and that seemed to be work okay.

The feature is not yet linked to the Probe Location Over Time filter.
In the mean time:

go to View->Pick Center (or click the icon for it in the menu bar)
click on the screen at the first point
click on the "Adjust Camera" icon (second from right on the left set
of icons above the 3D View).
The position that you have picked will be in the Center Of Rotation,
Use Cusom Center boxes.

Repeat.

I would automate the rendering process of sets of data that we routinely
generate.  I am looking at the python interface for doing this, ideally,
create a source, apply some filters and render.  Does anyone know of some
good documentation on how to do this?  I looked around and haven't found
any, and there is nothing in the examples either

Message-ID: <fd5546a50801251839w4fa7ee09i1239d58078bfb091@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again,
I am trying now to display some data that is not structured in cells and
points as a mesh would. This is a vector cloud in 3-D. Reading some of the
other threads I have found this could be done with Programmable Sources, or
vtp files. My only problem is that I am having trouble creating the actual
vectors... so I can assign points but am having issues assigning those
points, end points, to create vectors.

Here is some code, posted in this list before, that I have been using. I
think I need to add the end points as vtkPoints, is that right? Then
populate them in the loop. If anybody could point to how to do this in .vtp
xml file format that would help me even more. Like what structure should the
file have?

Thank you in advance,

Alessandro

---------------------------------------------------------------


#!/usr/bin/env python

from paraview import vtk
import csv

output = self.GetOutput()

points = vtk.vtkPoints()
data = vtk.vtkPoints() #? Is this what I need to be using?
cells = vtk.vtkCellArray()
vectors = vtk.vtkCellArray()

file = open("/home/bellina/workspace/Data/CSphere/test.vtp")

header = csv.reader(file).next() #get the header line
csvReader = csv.DictReader(file, header) #make a dict reader with the header
counter = 0 #need to keep track of the amount of cells
for line in csvReader:
  points.InsertNextPoint(float(line['x']), float(line['y']),
float(line['z']))   #add a point change the 'x' etc to what you have in your
header
  cells.InsertNextCell(1) #each point has its own cell
  cells.InsertCellPoint(counter)
  counter += 1

output.SetPoints(points) #need to set points
output.SetVerts(cells) #need to set cells as verts

I was wondering if anyone had any luck with building, or at least 
running, PV 3.2 on Leopard.  I've asked around people that I know and 
they haven't tried much.  A colleague of mine was wondering if he 
should upgrade now or wait until PV can handle 10.5.

What I have heard (thanks to Mike) is that building on 10.4 and running 
on 10.5 seems to work.  Also, VTK, except for CVS, won't build on 10.5. 
  Anything else?

Thanks,

Sean,

I am able to run the Intel binary of PV 3.2.1 available on
www.paraview.org on Leopard. The only odd behavior is that the
background of the rendering window goes white when I try to interact
with the plane widget. The orientation axes rotate, but leave
"streaks" as the results of the previous rendering never seem to get
cleared. Also, the scene gets "stuck", though the mouse events are
apparently picked up by the plane widget because the plane parameters
are modified if I happen to get lucky and grab the plane without being
able to see it.

Cory

Hi Alan,

The following documents talks about servermanager scripting used by
pvbatch: http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf

The pvbatch application is normally run the same way as pvserver
(without a client).

I've successfully built and run Paraview 3.2.1 on OSX 10.5.  I may not be
the best trial case though, as I  built it with qt 4.3.3 by disabling their
qt version check.  I was hoping I could get a 64 bit build.  Qt so far does
not support 64 bit on OSX, due to a carbon dependency.
I'm running on Intel, but I did do a ppc/x86 build.  I haven't noticed any
problems so far, but I haven't used it much.

I don't think this is easily doable. I suspect there are several
places at which the data type is hard-coded. What additional
information are you storing? Maybe we can extend the multi-block
dataset to support your case...

You should be able to build the server 64 bit by turning off the gui
and then use a 32 bit client to talk to it. I didn't try it yet since
I haven't upgraded my MacPro.

Hi Berk,

Thank you for your reply.  I need to extend in two places.  Firstly, my reader is taking an input file, running it through our meshing software and loading the structured mesh that is created into paraview.  The program also creates other files, e.g. one that gives the boundaries for that structured mesh.  I was hoping to store that addition information (like where the file is stored) for some of my other filters to use.  Instead, would it be possible for me to pass this string in another output from the reader so that I could still use the other filters associated with vtkMultiBlockDataSet as well?

The other case is where I would like to name the groups in vtkMultiGroupDataSet - that way I could have a filter that displayed the names in the object panel when selecting what to view.  This one might be more feasible to include in paraview.  What do you think?

Thanks again,
Paul

FYI, ParaView users and devs, new VTK release is planned soon.

Subject: VTK 5.2 Release Planning
To: vtkusers <vtkusers@vtk.org>, Vtk Developers <vtk-developers@vtk.org>

Dear VTK users and developers,

We are planning to create the VTK-5-2 branch in about a month (around the
end of February), followed by a month or so of bug fixing activity, followed
by the first release candidate for the VTK 5.2 release in early April, 2008.

As part of that plan, we would like to ask you, the VTK community, to
contribute to a successful release by doing the following:
- Review the non-resolved bugs in the bug database and make notes on those
you really want to see fixed.
- Help us make the "What's New in VTK 5.2" section of the Wiki page complete
(did we forget something that you know is new in 5.2?) -- contribute to the
Wiki at http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_5.2_Release_Planning
- Help us get (and keep!) the dashboards to a state of blissful green.
- Promptly add any newly found bugs or last-minute feature requests to the
bug database.
- Keep reading and responding to the mailing lists.

We will be triaging the bug database to prioritize which bugs we will fix.
If you would like to see a particular bug addressed before we release 5.2,
please visit the bug database and "vote" for that bug sometime in the next
week or two. To "vote", visit http://public.kitware.com/Bug, sign in (or
sign up for an account and then sign in), and add a note to any bug that you
would like to see fixed. That will show us what the interest level is in
fixing that particular bug. Obviously, bugs with little or no interest
expressed are less likely to be addressed than bugs with much interest
expressed.

New features in VTK since the 5.0 release include:
- Infovis kit
- Views kit
- New Widgets architecture and more than a dozen new widgets
- New Utilities: freerange, verdict, libxml2, metaio, sqlite
- Updated Utilities: freetype, zlib
- More than 300 new C++ classes.
- More than 100 new C++ tests running on most dashboards
- Many bug fixes, including much improved Java wrapping support and Mac OSX
support

For all of us VTK-ers at Kitware and around the world, thanks for your
continued contributions,
 David Cole
Kitware, Inc.

Each of the examples codes previously cited do not prevent you from handling 
data how you want to.  You can grab the relavent parts of those examples for 
setting up a client.

Another example can be found in ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Testing/Cxx,
or the pvpython client in ParaView3/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable

Fetching data in C++ can be done using 
<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/html/classvtkSMBlockDeliveryRepresentationProxy.html>
or
<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/html/classvtkSMClientDeliveryRepresentationProxy.html>
and probably some other ways too.

You can see how "Fetch()" is implemented in that python script by looking in
ParaView3/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py

You can do that now. Simply store it in the FieldData of the data
object. You will have to create a FieldData and assign it to the
output with SetFieldData(). In the field data, you can store an
arbitrary number of array of arbitrary length. For example, you can
store a string array that stores the name of the file. In the future,
you will be able to store meta-data like this using the Information
object as well.

Paul,

I am not sure how familiar you are with PV, so your issues may be way 
beyond the suggestions I am offering --

PV will read and display multiple source files. (I have been able to 
read in simultaneously an Exodus-II formatted file and an EnSight Gold 
binary formatted file.) Each displayable object can have its own filter 
pipe-line; each displayable object can have its visibility independently 
turned on/off; animation will use whatever is on the screen. I routinely 
generate a data-set for proofing the mesh, BC's and IC's followed by a 
separate file set for computed results. You can actually read the same 
data set twice and filter them differently for displaying two different 
results. You can translate and rotate one data set with respect to the 
other to watch two different views in an animation. The list goes on.

Using these features maybe a lot easy than getting entangled in writing 
your own reader.

Firstly, my reader is taking an input file, running it through our meshing software and loading the structured mesh that is created into paraview.  The program also creates other files, e.g. one that gives the boundaries for that structured mesh.  I was hoping to store that addition information (like where the file is stored) for some of my other filters to use.  Instead, would it be possible for me to pass this string in another output from the reader so that I could still use the other filters associated with vtkMultiBlockDataSet as well?

Message-ID: <004801c862c7$4e039250$773bbca3@nam.slb.com>

Hello,

 

I have installed Paraview on my linux machine (Red Hat Linux 64 bit
Operating System for Intel Extended Memory) to postprocess MFIX results. As
a first step I downloaded the *.RES file that was available on www.mfix.org
<http://www.mfix.org/>  website. This file opened fine using Paraview.

 

I installed MFIX on my machine and ran a test case given in the
mfix/tutorials. When I open the *.RES file in Paraview, the program just
freezes and I have to terminate the program. Can someone please help me in
fixing this problem?

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Nagendra.

Hello,
I have have installed the precompiled binaries of 3.2.1 on 10.5 and it works...not well but it works, I mean I can use it but it crashed really often. As for VTK 5.0 I have built it on 10.5 and did not encounter any problem, nor with C++ neither with Tcl interface but actually I did not use it intensively.
Concerning these so numerous crashes of Paraview, is it due to this Leopard binary or is it common? sorry if my question looks funny but I am a new paraview user and i only tested it with this configuration.

Message-ID: <20080130113455.8492.qmail@f5mail-236-219.rediffmail.com>

Thanks a lot to everyone for your sugestions and help. I have now
installed ParaView3.2.1 on a linux cluster and it works properly
without any problem.

ParaView scales properly for very large EnsightBinary files, however I
have some doubtes regarding it's working.

I have acess to a linux cluster with 110 nodes, each node with 2
cloverton processor and 16 GB of RAM.

When I fire pvserver on 10 nodes with the following command:

/usr/local/openmpi-1.2.4/bin/mpirun -np 10 --x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/raashid/src/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH --mca btl ^openib,mvapi -hostfile nodes ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

I find that on each node only 1 core out of available 8 is being used
by pvserver.

How can I utilize all the 8 cores available on all the nodes ?

Yes. I took a simplier case (cross-section is a rectangular surface) 
with a constant flow in the x-direction. The integrated corss-sectional 
area is correct but the flow rate is not. Paraview prints the vectors 
like (area, 0, 0) and not (-0.234,0,0) which are the real values. The 
flow rate is = the cross-sectional area and not the integral of _V_ dot 
_area_ where the underline means a vector. That is either the velocity 
vector was taken as 1.0 or not included in the integration.

The above was using 2.6.2. It does not work correctly in 2.6.2 but does 
work correctly in 3.2.1.

It is not common for paraview to regularly crash. Can you be more
specific? When does it crash? Can you find a reproducible case and
post a state file for it?

Setup your mpi such that you can launch 2 process per node (i.e. -np 20 with
the appropriate hostfile). ParaView does not yet support a hybrid
MPI/multi-threaded execution model.

Aha! Try this: Go to Prefences -> Server and turn off "Enable Depth
Peeling". I can't remember if this options is on 3.2.1. You may have
to get the latest CVS tree and compile from that source. I bet you are
using a Mac with an ATI graphics card, probably a laptop or an iMac
and you are using transparency. There are some issues in our
transparency implementation due to ATI drivers.

Could you give some more information on what the file looks like, and what
you want to see inside of paraview.

The example you included is designed to show single points as individual
cells. If you are trying to show random triangles in space, you will have to
modify the code to accept 3 points per cell and set the output type of the
cells from Verts to Polys.

Robert,
Since last time I posted this I was able to display something close to what
I want to do, but not quite exactly.

I have a 2-D vector field that changes in time. In each time step the vector
has six coordinates V = {(x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2)}. What I was ble to do
yesterday was plot them as <Lines>. So I did 2 points per line and that
worked OK. What I am interested in doing with this field is to plot a stream
(stream tracer.) So at some timestep in the future I want to be able to see
some of the old features of the previous timeteps. I think the stream tracer
filter does this but I can't use it with lines. Any other filters that do
this?

The file then has <Points> <Lines>. And <Lines> have a connectivity and
offset table.

I've seen some great renderings of stream-like behavior in ParaView.

Ultimately I'd like to be able to color the stream to imply angle of
inclination  of the vectors with respect to a normal, I think this is
secondary.

Thanks for your help,

Alessandro

It seems you want your data to be stored as an unstructured grid with cells of 
type 1 (VTK_VERTEX). At each cell you will have one attribute which is a vector 
with 3 components.

Such a grid can be run through the Glyph module to put a line or arrow at each 
cell. Let Glyph do that - don't store the data as lines.

I haven't tried it but vtkStreamTracer should be able to generate streamlines 
from such a grid.

To obtain such a grid you will need to store your data in one of the file 
formats that can represent that type of grid. For example, both the VTK legacy 
and the VTK XML file formats can do this. Their ASCII versions are easy to 
generate.

Hi, 

 Does someone have examples of python script (pvpython or pvbatch)?

 I need to load a VTK file, filter is thru ProbeLine and save the
result in a png file (snapshot). I look at Servermanager2 tutorial
but didn't succeed to do what I want. Here what I guessed from the
interactive help:

from paraview import servermanager

connection=servermanager.Connect('localhost')

reader=servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader(FileNames="/tmp/He.vtk")
reader.UpdateVTKObkject()
filter=servermanager.filters.ProbeLine(Input=reader, Source=

                                       TIA,

                                          Olivier.

i have just started myself down this road, here is something that i have
been playing with.

http://www.bettencourt.info/test.py

Hope that it helps, it reads in some frames and makes pngs using the
threshold filter, but you can swap that out

Berk,

How do I implement this easy fix you mentioned? 

Is this fix the one outlined at 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series?
If Yes -- I tried making a custom Xdmf reader that works with file 
series as outlined (attached are my XML files, please review)
          Results -- compile and runs, but no XDMF reader in GUI
          Do you see anything wrong with my XML?

If you solution is different  -- please point me in the correct direction.

Thanks,

Jose

Hi,

I can recommend using 'visit' for python batch usage. There 
you can easyly record powerful python macros on the fly, 
which makes it much easier for python scripting; at least as 
long as there is no such a feature in paraview...

Regards!

VISIT seems very limited in the types of data that it can read in, i can't
mix and match an XY slice w/ a YZ slice for example without dumping the
full 50GB dataset because it thinks that the XY slice is 2d and the yz is
3D...

Kent,
Thank you very much for your suggestion. I hadn't thought of that.

I tried it with VTK_VERTEX and I am able to see the data. I am also able to
use the Glypth module to add arrows.

Now the StreamTracer filter just doesn't makes everything disappear. I am
not sure if it works for this datatype. I am not sure if anybody has dealt
with the filter. I add it after Glyph, or even before I add Glyph, and
everything disappears.

Thank you,

Alessandro

Stream Tracer and Glyph should both be connected to the output of the reader. 
The output of Glyph will be the polygons that draw the arrows.

Do you get any error messages from Stream Tracer? You will need to carefully 
set its starting point and parameters to produce streamlines. Its documentation 
says it can use "any" data type but I've never used it with just points.

Subject: [Paraview] how to view elelemts inside the mesh?
Message-ID: <451884.29254.qm@web35301.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have a polyhedron mesh.  Is it possible to view the elements inside the mesh?  Something similar to cutting plane, but, it will show the faces of the elements.  Cutting plane cut a to a "flat" surface.  What I am looking for is to show the faces of the elements the plane passes through.

Thanks!

Peiying

This sounds strange ... I am not sure, if I got your problem 
and I am no expert in visit, but can't you adjust the 2d and 
3d setting for the slices? I did not have to handle such 
large datasets yet, but I thought visit is, like paraview, 
developed for such large datasets ...
In terms of data format visit has AFAIK more formats by 
default than paraview.

Just a small python 'plot line example':
OpenDatabase("/usr/gapps/visit/data/rect2d.silo")
AddPlot("Pseudocolor", "x-velocity")
DrawPlots()
Lineout((0.2,0.2), (0.8,1.2))

Subject: [Paraview] create scalar bar using Python
Message-ID: <cffaa6b90801310446j24d06857s1bcd376bfb518ece@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

How do I create a scalar bar using Python scripting? I can create a
ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation with this script:

#################
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()

sph = servermanager.sources.SphereSource(registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='sphere1')
elev = servermanager.filters.ElevationFilter(Input=sph,registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='elevation1')
elev.UpdatePipeline()
elevRange=elev.GetDataInformation().GetPointDataInformation().GetArrayInformation(1).GetComponentRange(0)

lTable1 = servermanager.rendering.PVLookupTable(registrationGroup='lookup_tables')
lTable1.RGBPoints = [elevRange[0], 0, 0, 1, elevRange[1], 1, 0, 0]
lTable1.ColorSpace = 1 # HSV

rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(elev,view,registrationGroup='representations')
rep.LookupTable = lTable1
rep.ColorAttributeType = 0 # point data
rep.ColorArrayName = 'Elevation' # color by Elevation

sBar1 = servermanager.rendering.ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation(registrationGroup='scalar_bars',registrationName="ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation1")
sBar1.Title = 'elevation'
sBar1.LookupTable = lTable1

view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
#################

But whenever I try to create a representation for it (for example:
rep2 = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(sBar1,view,registrationGroup='representations'))
ParaView crashes with the following message:

this is most likely getting off topic for the PV maillist.

What i am talking about is this,

if i take a data set that is 100x100x1 and import it into visit i can 
color it,  visit says it is a 2d dataset
if  i import a 1x100x100 dataset into visit, i can viz it as a 3d dataset.

if i import both, i can't viz both becuase visit won't let me mix 2d and 
3d datasets.    I am not sure i am doing something wrong or not.  I do 
know that if i take the initial dataset and turn it into a 3d dataset 
via surface (I can't recall the exact name of the filter, but DX calls 
it rubbersheet) i can then view both slices at the same time.  Maybe 
there is a way to promote the 2D data to 3D that would make visit 
usable, not sure though.

thanks

It will, for sure. Thanks.

However I cannot figure how I should give the Source of my ProbeLine
filter (in my case a Line source with 2 points and a resolution).

In your case, pvpython message was more or less clear:

>>> thresh=servermanager.filters.Threshold(Input=reader)
>>> thresh.ListProperties()
['AllScalars', 'Input', 'SelectInputScalars', 'ThresholdBetween']
>>> thresh.GetProperty('SelectInputScalars')
Property name= SelectInputScalars value = ['', '', '', '', '']

I can figure it waits for 4 data. In my case it wait for a
VTK object... 

>>> filter.GetProperty('Source')
Property name= Source value = None
>>> filter.SetPropertyWithName('Source','whatever')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/opt/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview/servermanager.py", line 163, in SetPropertyWithName
    prop.SetData(arg)
  File "/opt/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview/servermanager.py", line 584, in SetData
    self.SMProperty.AddInputConnection(op.Proxy, op.Port)
ValueError: method requires a VTK object

Is there is an API somewhere? I couldn't find the information in
VTK user's guide.

Hi again.

view.Representations.append(sBar01) did the trick!

Subject: [Paraview] Extract unstructured grid
Message-ID: <1dfc11660801310838udb9d9d2ve04eaec1d7011bef@mail.gmail.com>

Hello ParaView users,

I am (used to be) a MayaVi user for quite some time now.
Recently however, I discovered ParaView and I think that it is considerably
better. I particularly enjoy the Clip option that was not available in
MayaVi1.

My question is as follows:
I run my FE computations and export unstructured_grid VTK files. Everything
looks ok except that I cannot extract part of the grid. For example,
elements 51-105. Which filter and how should I use? I should mention that
the "Extract Subset" filter is DISABLED. In MayaVi there was the Filter
"ExtractUnstructuredGrid" that would do the job, but I can't find anything
similar here.

Thanks for any help in advance,
dqdev

ps. My VTK file has the following form:

I suggest using selection to extract the elements you want. You need
to populate the active selection with the list of elements you want to
extract, and then apply the extract selection filter.

One way to do this (warning:I am working from memory here) is to open
a spreadsheet view window, make the data you want to extract from
visible in it by clicking on the eye next to it in the pipeline
browser, use the display tab to show either the points or the cells,
then ctrl-clicking on the rows for the particular elements or cells
you are interested in. That populates the active selection and you
should see the cells highlighted in magenta in the 3D view of the
data. Now apply the extract selection filter.

cheers,
Dave

That's very nice, but that page links back to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend which could put people on
the wrong track.  I'd like to remove that link and rather point people
at the example XML that comes with ParaView.  Is that ok?

I just fixed that link to point to another page with the correct documentation

Message-ID: <31ddba770801311020g215c9102pec77d0be154a5a68@mail.gmail.com>

Deal all,

I have been banging my head (and core dumping my workstation) trying
to find the correct server XML for the SetAxisMagnificationFactor
method of vtkImageResample.

SetAxisMagnificationFactor takes an integer index as first parameter
and a double factor as the second parameter.  One does this for each
axis in the input vtkImageData.

Could anyone give me hints on the correct DoubleVectorProperty
specification for this?

Thanks,
Charl

How about starting with this?

     <StringVectorProperty
        name="AxisMagnificiationFactor"
        command="SetAxisMagnificationFactor"
        number_of_elements="2"
        element_types="0 1"
        default_values="0" >
     </StringVectorProperty>

For element_types, 0 means int, 1 means double.

Thanks for the explanation. Sorry, I can't help 
neither...and as soon as I can I would do it off the PV list.
