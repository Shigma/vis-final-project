Hello,

is anywhere a working example of the paraview web visualizer online? I 
tried without success in Chrome and Firefox:

Message-ID: <2029309824.4651838.1396361714768.JavaMail.root@univ-valenciennes.fr>

Hi all, 

There is a behavior I find really strange in some cases: it is the fact that after a plotOverLine boundary values ??are not routinely used. 

For example it's not possible to have on the curve of a plotOverLine the value of zero for the velocity at a stationary wall. 

Do you watch also this behavior? 
How can we fix it ? 

Thanks 
Francois

Hi Daniel,

Sorry one of the file to download changed its name. I've just fixed the
script and uploaded a new version.
If you download the new one, that should just work.

Thanks,

Seb

PS: Give me 5 more minutes to make sure everything works.

Should be back on now.

The issue come from our launcher that prevent too many concurrent session
to be on.
Unfortunately after a while, it prevent any new visualization to start.

Hi,

Thanks for the pointer to Group Datasets, Andy. That seems to be useful.

BUT even that has issues... if I group, then the Delauny2D applies to
all, etc. 

Is there a way to apply a global Z-scale? When working with topography
it would be nice to not worry about each of the many individual data
products brought in, and just have them all scaled by 3 or 10 in Z
only. Is this possible?

Thanks,

  -k.

Subject: [Paraview] Job Opportunity National Center for Computing,
 ORNL - Visualization Liaison
Message-ID: <27FBFE429C33854CBF8B8783969635258250AE7AAA@EXCHMBB.ornl.gov>


Dave DeMarle referred me to this venue to educate this network of two Computer Scientist positions on our Visualization Team at Oak Ridge National Lab.  The job description is attached and is below:
For more info please contact Julianna Presley at presleyj at ornl.gov<mailto:presleyj at ornl.gov>


Job Posting Title:  Computer Scientist - Visualization Liaison

Purpose:
The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) has the charge to develop and apply transformational computational science capabilities in support of advances in our understanding of the physical world.  As a designated User Facility, the OLCF delivers leadership-class computing for science and engineering; focuses on grand-challenge science and engineering applications; procures largest-scale computing systems and develops high-end operational and application software.
The National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) in the Computing and Computational Sciences Directorate at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in East Tennessee seeks to hire a Computer Scientist within the Scientific Computing Group to serve as a Visualization Liaison to users of the OLCF computing resources.
With the continuing advances in data acquisition and simulation techniques, increasingly large 3D data sets have to be processed and interactively displayed for real-time visual exploration.  The emphasis of the open position in this context is on the efficient scalable out-of-core and parallel visual data processing of very large spatial and volumetric data sets.
Major Duties/Responsibilities:
The successful candidate will directly interact with several external collaborators and data-set providers, including industrial and academic institutions.  This requires interest not only in graphics related algorithms and data structures but also in the task and data complexity of the targeted application, and collaboration with domain scientists and other institutions.  The work of the Visualization Liaison will often build on other and previously developed techniques, so a strong interest in learning new programming frameworks and 3rd-party code is necessary, in addition to established skills in numerical methods and applied mathematics.
This position provides the opportunity to develop personal research skills and experience and to contribute to the acquisition of new funding in order to develop the visualization axis within the OLCF.

Minimum Qualifications:
This position requires an M.S. in computer science or a related discipline with 2-7 years of relevant experience.  Exposure to parallel programming and distributed systems is required.  Excellent interpersonal skills, oral and written communication skills, organizational skills, and strong personal motivation are necessary.  The demonstrated ability to work in a dynamic, team-oriented environment is required.
Preferred Qualifications:
A PHD and 5+ years of experience preferred.  Established expertise in scientific visualization, interactive computer graphics, immersive technologies, computational geometry, and image processing is desired.  Experience with C/C++, OpenGL, CUDA, scripting languages, MPI programming, high-performance I/O and data movement, and a broad background of visualization software is desired.
Information about the visualization activities within the NCCS is available at:
http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/computing-resources/data-analysis/

Hi Ken,

You can apply the Delauny2D to whatever sources and/or filters you want and
then use that output to be included in the Group Datasets filter.

As for scaling, the two options that are typically used which scale in the
cartesian coordinate directions. The first is just through the filter's
view you can edit the Scale values under Transforming. The second is using
the Transform filter. If the scaling isn't axis-aligned you can try the
Calculator filter with Coordinate Results checked to tell it to use the
result array as the point coordinates array. In order for it to work for a
single input though you'd have to do this after all of the data sets are
combined with either the Group Datasets or Append Datasets filter.

Regards,
Andy

I'm debugging a ParaView client-server connection issue between ParaView
4.1.0 running on a Windows machine and a remote HPC system.    I'd like to
see the SSH string that's being generated on the Windows side, but I don't
see any output that says "Server Launch command is :"  like I see on the
Linux and Mac systems.   Is there some way to see this output on the Windows
machine?   This output must be generated by Paraview by default, because I
don't think that that I'm doing anything in my default_servers.pvsc file to
print this output.


Here's what I see on Mac/Linux in the terminal window where I run the
client.   There are the values that I'm setting in the host profile as
described in the default_servers.pvsc file, and I then see the SSH command
that gets built and executed.

Hi Rick,

If you are running from cmd.exe you capture the output in a file as follows:

    paraview.exe > out.txt 2>&1

If you launch from within a cygwin shell, you see the output as usual. I 
find cygwin much nicer than cmd.

Subject: [Paraview] Polar Plot Question
Message-ID: <6EDB7DD5-96FF-419B-B68A-3D6685773264@gmail.com>

Hi!
 
 I have a question. I have three columns of data, Wind Direction, Wind Speed, and concentration of specific gas. To determine the source location, I would like to have a polar plot showing the wind direction, wind speed as radius, and the concentration denoted in color depending on its value overlaid on the polar plot. For instance, if I have high values coming from NE direction, I would be able to see that on the polar plot. I have made something similar in MATLAB. I would like to make it more visually appealing. I am wondering whether Paraview can be used and be better. If so, can you please guide me in the process. I really appreciate of your help.
Thanks

Thanks for the tip Yves.

When possible I try to avoid compiling ParaView on the parallel file
system. These beasts are tuned for relatively small numbers of really huge
files written by many nodes, but compilation tends to read and write large
numbers of tiny files written from a single node. This usually means that
the compilation is painfully slow, and as you pointed out, brings up
obscure problems. Instead I build it on a small filesystem, nfs or even a
local /tmp dir and then install the compiled result wherever it needs to go
so that the compute nodes can access it.

Hi Rick,

If you are running from cmd.exe you capture the output in a file as follows:


	paraview.exe > out.txt 2>&1
	

If you launch from within a cygwin shell, you see the output as usual. I
find cygwin much nicer than cmd.

I`ve tried another MPI implementation, MS-MPI

The result now is different

The OPENGL screens open, but they don`t follow the cave.pvx file

They open up with a smaller resolution, different of what i set in
"Geometry"

The "FullScreen" doesn`t help either

"ShowBorders" works normally

Does anyone ever found something similar to this?

I'd like to add some pngs to an animation I'm making but this requires to
import pngs onto a plane other than the default 'z-plane' that paraview

	4.0 does not
Message-ID: <201404031101.s33B1N44070352@mech-cluster241.men.bris.ac.uk>

I'm having the following problem.
I use X server on a FreeBSD box.
I connet to a linux server with ssh -XY
On the linux server I run pvbatch or paraview
command.
With PV 3.98.1 this works, but with
PV 4.0.1 it does not work.
Paraview or pvbatch 4.0.1 sit there seemingly
doing nothing, no error, no exit, no
graphical window.

So I was suspecting a FreeBSD issue.
However, now I had a confirmation from our
IT support team that this behaviour
is reproducible on Mac, i.e. connecting
from Mac via ssh to a linux server,
and launching pvbatch or paraview from there.

I wanted to check if somebody here
can reproduce the problem, either
with FreeBSD or Mac.

Many thanks

Anton

Subject: [Paraview] Field average in Paraview
Message-ID: <7b31f5a55f554e358c6958ad1aa40932@DB3PR01MB265.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi All,


Recently I have been playing with field average in Paraview but I got some problems.


Basically I am doing pipe flow simulation in OpenFOAM and I want to achieve both axial average and circumferential average.


First thing is I want to get a 2D averaged slice to represent the 3D field, like compressing the pipe into a single plane. My idea is to get multiple slices and then take the average of them so that I can obtain a 2D plane. Is there any way to do that in Paraview?


Second one is I want to get the mean velocity profile of the pipe. I created a calculator for radius (i.e. distances from the wall) and then applied contour based on the radius variable I created. By doing this I can get a circular slice at a specific radius every time. After that I applied integrate variable for the circular slice in order to get mean velocity at that radius. The thing is I need much data at different radius, so I need to integrate variable on different circular slices. However, when I use 'new range' to get multiple circular slices and apply integrate variable, I will only get one value for all the slices. My question is how can I get a list of integrated values on each sampled slice with creating all the slices at once?


Hope anyone can give me a hint. Thank you very much.


Kind regards,

Tony

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView python scripting - capture from ParaView GUI
Message-ID: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD82021DD0E9@umechp9h.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello there,

I am trying to cook up a batch file for the visualization pipeline that I am doing on ParaView GUI so that I can run that same sequence in batch mode and in parallel using pvbatch. I can get most of the python script using the Tool->Start Trace option on ParaView GUI. However, Start Trace didn't capture python script when I do a File->Save Data command.

For example, if I open up ParaView 4.1.0 and do a Tool->Start Trace, and then load up a cone and hit Apply and then do a File-> Save Data into legacy vtk format, and then do a Tool->Stop Trace, I will get the following python script

------------------ start python script ------------------

try: paraview.simple

except: from paraview.simple import *

paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()


Cone1 = Cone()


RenderView1 = GetRenderView()


DataRepresentation1 = Show()

DataRepresentation1.ScaleFactor = 0.1

DataRepresentation1.EdgeColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.5000076295109483]


RenderView1.CameraPosition = [0.0, 0.0, 3.2036135254332487]

RenderView1.CameraClippingRange = [2.309882128879306, 4.336364527086367]

RenderView1.CameraParallelScale = 0.8291561935301535


Render()


------------- end python script -------------------

I will get the cone data saved to legacy vtk format in a file
[simonsm at abc ~]$ cat test.vtk
# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 7 float
0.5 0 0 -0.5 0.5 0 -0.5 0.25 0.433013
-0.5 -0.25 0.433013 -0.5 -0.5 6.12323e-17 -0.5 -0.25 -0.433013
-0.5 0.25 -0.433013
POLYGONS 7 31

3 0 1 2
3 0 2 3
3 0 3 4
3 0 4 5
3 0 5 6
3 0 6 1

So, what is the python script command I need to save the data and how do I turn the python script from the Start Trace output into python script that I can run with pvbatch? Anything I need to strip off the output?

thanks

I believe, the trace does not capture the inputs and the outputs. What you
can do instead, is take the output of trace, add code to it for input and
output and
run using pvpython.

Subject: [Paraview] How to save data to xmf format?
Message-ID: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD82021DD0FA@umechp9h.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

I have a visualization pipeline output that I am seeing on the ParaView GUI that I would like to use File->Save Data into xmf format. However, I am getting the following error when I try to save the file


ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 815

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x4407890): Input for connection index 0 on input port index 0 for algorithm vtkPVPostFilter(0x4472160) is of type vtkDataObject, but a vtkPolyData is required.



ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 815

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x4407890): Input for connection index 0 on input port index 0 for algorithm vtkPVPostFilter(0x4472160) is of type vtkDataObject, but a vtkPolyData is required.


I got the error above when I open ParaView-4.1.0, and then load a cone using Source->Cone option and hit apply. And then do a File->Save Data and pick xmf file format.


What would be the correct way to get my data into xmf format? And what would be the corresponding python script to do that?


thanks

Hello,

Sorry, I actually have an update. Some data was saved even I am getting those error with xmf format.  In this cone case, I am seeing everything in the legacy vtk file format  with the two error I am getting. However, with my other dataset, I am seeing missing object in the outputted xmf file format.

thanks

You don't need to strip anything off the output.

To save results add:
WriteImage("filename.png")
To save the screenshot in png format

And/Or add:

writer= CreateWriter("filename.vtk", Cone1)
writer.UpdatePipeline()

to save the Cone1's data in vtk format

Hi David,

thanks. What about saving it in to xdmf file format? Is it as simple as doing

writer=CreateWrite("filename.xmf", Cone1)?

or do I need a different writer class?

thanks

You are seeing a bug that was fixed after paraview 4.1 was released.
Specifically this VTK fix corrected it:

commit 0679bf4054088ee15408bcfda4b28539fb66bc1d
Author: Tristan Coulange <tristan.coulange at kitware.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 4 17:34:43 2014 +0100

    BUG: fix some xdmf writer crashes

    - Sets the number of output ports to 0, which avoid an error message in
      Paraview because the writer is used in a pipeline.
    - Manages a potential null pointer, avoiding a crash which occurs when
the
      user unchecks some blocks in Paraview for instance.

    Change-Id: I09c69bc6ac715bcb4297df4e2a012514a7817c57

Try a ParaView nightly build which you can get a binary for from the
download page, or build from source to obtain.

Yes, modulo the bug that we discuss in the other thread on the mailing list.
Summary of which is that it won't work because of a bug in 4.1, try master
or perhaps the 3.14 release.

This happens with pv 3.98. Is this a known bug?

Hello.

With PV401 Linux 64 bits, I have a crash every time I pick the center of 
rotation on a Normal Glyph. Is this a known bug ?

To reproduce on any dataset, use the Filters "Extract Surfaces -> 
Generate Surface Normals -> Normal Glyphs". Picking center between 
glyphs is OK, picking center on a glyph crashes.

Best regards.

Richard,

That's a new one on me, but I certainly see the same behavior. I've raised
a bug for it:

Try using the Threshold filter to remove those unwanted points (after using table to points).

Hi,
I am having difficulties to load paraview.simple in python 2.7 on my mac.
I installed the latest paraview app which is paraview.4.1.0

Here is what I do in my terminal:

Subject: [Paraview] Import list of data points to probe and export time
 series CSV data
Message-ID: <E46913E69A204DC2B842F29D8DDC2B2F@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a student researcher using Paraview for the first time. I have question.. hopefully someone can help me.

I have several hundred *.vtu files from a various flow simulations at incremental time steps.  

The data in each contains the x,y,z location information and the pressure (P) and velocity information(U1, U2, U3)

I would like to programmatically probe and export location and velocity data for each point. I cannot figure out how to do this.

Here is what I?m trying to do:

1) read in a csv list of points I would like to probe at every 5th x-index at certain y and z values, e.g. (0..5..100, 0.05, 0) (x,y,z) - technically, the points are not evenly at every 5, so when using the pipeline browser/properties area, if I input 5, it will select the nearest point to 5. Point Coordinates: 0 however will still read 5.

2) Export probed points at all time points

I found http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-May/021311.html but it is confusing to me because it doesn?t list the specifics of doing something similar, just the general steps.  

I can and have been doing this manually, but doing so takes me an enormous amount of time because of the time it takes to read the data for each point change (each vtu file is 42MB).

Can someone please help?

Thanks,

Ethan

Hi

When i create/load any vtkPolyData set (including vertices), store it as ply file and reload it then the vertice information gets lost, so there is only point data in it, no cell data which means that nothing is rendered. Is there a reason for that or is that a bug?

To be honest I have played with that and I'm confused with how the rotation
actually works! By default PV loads png files onto the z = 0 plane. Now
what I know of the final plane is that it is parallel to the 'view plane'
(i.e. the plane with \vec{PF} normal where P is the camera position and F
is the camera focal point). Is there any easy way to achieve this?

We're trying to install Paraview on a cluster here.  We've used mvapich,
mvapich2 and openmpi and turned off qt to do a server installation.  After
going through the iterative process with ccmake numerous times, configure
shows 99% then a screen pops up that says it found the blast libs and at
the bottom of the the screen it says there were errors on the last pass.
 It doesn't log any errors in any of the logs in the build directory.  Has
anybody else seen this behavior?  Can I buy an error message?

Hi,

I have a modest size problem, 100M unstructured, and I can easily load into
paraview with 64 processors / 128G ram when I load the pvtu file.

I can also work on the file, meaning creating contours, etc. However, when
I load all vtu files separately and create contours on each file separately
it seems that PV runs out of memory and my process gets terminated.

Is this normal?

 I am trying to setup a visualization solution for my research code which produces structured, nodal data, based on a discontinuous Galerkin solution method for fluid equations.

The domain is either 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, or 6D.  Yes, greater than 3D, because my primary model produces kinetic data sampled in phase space (3D position and 3D velocity).
The domain is discretized by elements that are generalized N-dimensional quadrilaterals. (quadrilaterals, hexahedrals, etc.) organized in a block-structured mesh.
The solution on any given element is smooth, represented by arbitrary order polynomials and sampled at surface and interior node locations.  I tend to use high order elements compared to typical practice, i.e. 7th, 8th, 9th-order. I?d like the visualization to capture some of the element?s internal solution structure rather than just a linear interpolation between element vertices.
The solution is multi-valued at faces where two elements are adjacent and I want the visualization to well-capture the surface discontinuity.
My mesh and nodal data are both stored in HDF5 files, with some flexibility to modify formatting.


I spent some time reviewing the ParaView user guide and document for plugin reader development and now have a few questions before I can proceed.

Obviously ParaView is focused on 2D and 3D data. The underlying VTK looks to only handle up to 3D vertex position vectors, for example.  My takeaway from this, is it is not possible to describe a 4D or higher mesh to ParaView directly.  That?s not surprising but seems to suggest I will have to write a custom reader plugin to access my 4D+data.  My survey of the documentation makes me think that I?ll be able to provide parameters to the reader plugin that control the dataset.  For example, specify what dimensions to slice and where to slice.  I suppose I need to similarly parameterize the load of the mesh.  Does this sound like a workable approach?

For the data discontinuities at element faces, I?ve seen discussions in this forum that suggest unstructured grids with duplicated/co-located vertices allows for assigning two different data values at the same physical location.  Since I am working with structured grids and data, I?m wondering if a different technique might work.  How about inserting zero-volume collapsed elements between each real element?  In this way, the real elements are still adjacent, but their vertices / nodes can be assigned different vales.  One concern I have is the hidden element would have zero-volume.  I?d hate to develop that design and then have some ParaView internal function break due to a divide by zero error or something similar.  Another problem area might be plotting stream tubes from the data set.

Lastly, for the high order visualization, I thinking the most straight forward approach is to interpolate my structured high order elements  into a new fine mesh of structured linear elements.  That should be good enough.  On this forum, vtkBridgeDataSet has been mentioned as a possible approach but requiring much development effort.  That was several years ago.  Has there been any progress by others with similar high-order or spectral data sets?

Here?s an old thread that brought up the same basic goals as mine: http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2006-October/003899.html
(The numerical scheme and element types are not exactly what I?m working on, but the ideas are similar.)

I really appreciate any feedback.

Message-ID: <5347FF94.5080902@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


Attached is a very simple test.vtp (see *_01.png) which for some reason cannot 
be converted into a single vtkPolyLine with vtkStripper. Even if I use paraview 
with Clean+Triangulate+TriangleStrip the result still consists of two 
vtkPolyLine (see extracted cell 0 (thicker line) and green cell labels in 
*_03.png).
Why does vtkStripper not yield a single vtkPolyLine from this particular 
dataset? Is it the odd order of the points and lines?
Is this a bug?
If not, how can I achieve what I need, i.e. getting a single vtkPolyLine?

Any help or hints are very much appreciated

Hi Noah,

If you are dealing with meshes where regular sampling of higher order elements is feasible and the number of samples per element per axis is high (>8?), you might consider using composite datasets (AMR or multiblock datasets), with each block holding image data for a single element.

> 	? The solution is multi-valued at faces where two elements are adjacent and I want the visualization to well-capture the surface discontinuity.

That can be troublesome with precisely coincident grid points since rendering just those boundaries will exhibit z-fighting. If you isocontour, you will see cracks at element boundaries which reflect discontinuities. A better understanding of what you intend to visualize might help decide how to organize the data.

> ... Obviously ParaView is focused on 2D and 3D data. The underlying VTK looks to only handle up to 3D vertex position vectors, for example.  My takeaway from this, is it is not possible to describe a 4D or higher mesh to ParaView directly.

Yes. You may also want to take a look at http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/InSituDataStructures and vtkTypedDataArray as a way to provide 3-d point coordinates from a higher-dimensional array (and the remaining dimensions as other independent arrays). But it's unclear to me -- assuming you regularly sample phase space the same way you sample positional space -- how you would handle places where the projection to a subset of those dimensions resulted in coincident elements in the projected space.

> For the data discontinuities at element faces, I?ve seen discussions in this forum that suggest unstructured grids with duplicated/co-located vertices allows for assigning two different data values at the same physical location.  Since I am working with structured grids and data, I?m wondering if a different technique might work.  How about inserting zero-volume collapsed elements between each real element?

I think this would be problematic for many VTK filters.

> Lastly, for the high order visualization, ... the most straight forward approach is to interpolate my structured high order elements... vtkBridgeDataSet has been mentioned as a possible approach but requiring much development effort.  That was several years ago.  Has there been any progress by others with similar high-order or spectral data sets?

Sadly, no. Although we have had a lot of interest from academia, there haven't been paying customers for this.

Hi,

I did some research, and i saw some e-mails with this subject in the past,
but they didn`t help

Nowadays, where is Paraview when it comes to Seismic Data like .sgy?

Is there any plans about seismic data readers , or some kind of help about
tranforming this type of data to another one that is known by Paraview?

Hi all,

   I found that it is easy to write a VTU with multiple pieces, say

however is there a way to make the pieces "selectable" and named ?

Hi Max,

I tend to store different "pieces" in a vtkMultiBlockDataSet instance and I
write the dataset using the vtkXMLPMultiBlockDataWriter. Then, within
ParaView, I use the "Multi-Block Inspector" (under the View menu) to
select, turn on/off different blocks.

I am not sure if there is a way to name the blocks from the UI. However, I
think you can do it programmatically when constructing the multi-block
dataset with something like this:

mbds->GetMetaData( blockIdx )->Set( vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"<SomeName>");

Cheers,
George

Max,

Attached is a *.pvd file that will present them collectively to ParaView 
as a single "model."

Any combination of individual pieces can be selected with the Extract 
Group filter for display. They all have matching point and cell datum items

However, the name attribute is ignored.

Enjoy

Message-ID: <CA+V7QS_eZXAUuU4aR_spjFRt34=8xiHu1A1_avXrwD-zP=Avgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,
I'd like to use paraview to combine volume rendering with various forms of
geometric information - meshes and streamlines. The volume information is
typically in the form of nifti files, while the geometries are VTK files.
My problem is that the nifti plugin doesn't fully utilize the nifti header
information. I think that what needs to happen is an appropriate
transformation should be set up in the loading plugin, but I have no idea
what form this should take. Is anyone aware of other plugins that load data
that includes transform information that might be appropriate as a model?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] LIC plugin version 2 of PV 410 Windows 32 bits fails :
 unsupported NVIDIA card driver ?
Message-ID: <534D10BA.5090909@onera.fr>

Hello,

On Windows Vista 32 bits with NVIDIA graphic card GeForce 8700M GT, the 
PV 401 LIC plugin works fine, but the PV 410 LIC plugin gives always 
this error:

I have seen in the "Tools->Manage plugins" menu that the LIC plugin 
Version is 1 in PV 401 and 2 in PV 410. Does the Version 2 work only 
with recent drivers ?

My NVIDIA driver version number is 7.15.11.7626 from 2008. Two years 
ago, I tried to update it with a version that was recommended by NVIDIA 
(296.10) and that should be compatible with my old graphic card, but 
some of my graphic codes have shown some artifacts, and I had to return 
to the old driver. So it would be fine if I could use a LIC plugin 
without changing my driver. I tried to replace the Version 2 LIC plugin 
of PV 410 by  the Version 1 LIC plugin of PV 401, but I did not succeed.

Best regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

Your video card is fairly old and it doesn't support the extensions used 
by the new version.

The 2.0 Surface LIC in PV 4.1 is a true parallel implementation and has 
additional requirements compared with the original serial code. However, 
there are no exotic requirements, all have been adopted into the OpenGL 
standard many years ago. So most recent hardware/drivers will provide 
the required extensions.

NVIDIA's spec 
sheet(http://developer.download.nvidia.com/opengl/specs/g80specs.pdf) 
doesn't show support for GL_ARB_depth_buffer_float. Based on the info 
you provided that's my best guess as to what's wrong. However, I found a 
mention( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_8_Series) that the new 
drivers for the 8 series support OpenGL 3.3, which includes floating 
point depth buffer. Updating your driver may resolve the issue.

Hello Burlen,

Thank you for this information.

Indeed, my laptop is very old: it is a Toshiba Satellite X 200 with 
Vista 32 bits that I purchased in 2007. The NVIDIA driver has been 
automatically updated by Windows update to the 7.15.11.7626 version in 
2008 or 2009, I don't remember. The most recent Vista 32 bits driver 
that Toshiba gives on its download page for this laptop is only the 
7.15.11.7605 version that is older than the version I got from Windows 
update!

I have downloaded the 307.83 version on the NVIDIA download page, and my 
card is in the list of compatible cards. I hope it's true! I will try to 
update my driver this evening.

Thanks again.

Richard

Thank you for the feedback David.
Another developer and I are going to forge ahead and see what sort of prototype we can get working.

For simplicity, we will avoid the composite data sets for now ? the supposed approach to use AMR-like data sets to represent each actual high order element.  In general, our simulations produce somewhere around 4-9 samples per element axis.  This falls mostly below your gut threshold for when composite data sets might be effective.  This does spur a curiosity though.  A refined AMR region adjacent to a course region could produce multi-valued nodal data or cell-centered data.  Is there anything to learn from ParaView?s treatment of multi-valued data at AMR region faces?

Since you say that zero-volume virtual-elements could be problematic, I propose a simpler approach along the same idea.  Interpolate the high-order element solution to a structured mesh, where the structured mesh samples arbitrarily close-to, but not on the original element face.  So, where the original mesh has high order elements with discontinuous solutions at the element faces, the new mesh would have structured nodal values all inside the original elements.  The new mesh might span from [1% to 99%] along each element face dimension.  This would leave one cell with about 2% element width that could have a high gradient connecting two ?element? regions.

Does that make sense?  If not, and assuming the list allows attachments, I could draw a picture.

just asking this question in a different way. What happens if I load a vtu
file in parallel? Can paraview handle that automatically (i.e. partitioning
it and sending it to different processors) or is every processor going to
load the same exact file?

If you want to use Python27, download the
"ParaView-4.1.0-Darwin-64bit-Lion-Python27.dmg" binary. You're using
the one built forPython 2.6.

Attached is a script I use to run ParaView with Python 2.6. Simply
update the script to point to directories on your machine and then run
"python2.7" instead of python2.6". Hope that helps.

Folks,

We've been working on changing how application settings work in
ParaView for the next release.

Here's a blog post that talks about the UI changes:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/652

Let us know if you have any feedback. The code hasn't landed in
git/master yet and won't for a couple more weeks.

I am not the expert in this, but I believe the reason by Nifti cannot
support volume transforms is because VTK doesn't support arbitrary
transformations on ImageData -- the type of data Nifti reader
produces.

For *.vtu files, ParaView reads the data on the 0th node and then
partitions and redistributes it to all ranks.

Hello Burlen,

Problem solved. The NVIDIA driver 307.83 allows using the Version 2 LIC 
plugin pf PV 410 with my old GeForce 8700M GT card, and all my other old 
graphic software (including games!) seems to accept this new driver.

Thank you again.

Richard.

Thanks, this works fine.
I have been looking forward to using paraview.simple in the regular python prompt.
pvpython is nice but the prompt does not provide all the features of the full prompt from python so this is a big improvement for me!

Subject: [Paraview] Pvbatch 4.1.0 core dumps when loading LIC plugin on
	server and client
Message-ID: <CAFFYk1XL8qC0jPCd531=pSs5xUD2tWcnqzE0_oEbH1tDUYu1SA@mail.gmail.com>

 Create a Python file with the following commands:

from paraview.simple import *

print 'Loading on server...'
LoadPlugin('/opt/ParaView/ParaView-4.1.0-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.1/libSurfaceLIC.so',
True, globals())
print '...loaded.'
print 'Loading on client...'
LoadPlugin('/opt/ParaView/ParaView-4.1.0-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.1/libSurfaceLIC.so',
False, globals())
print '...loaded.

And then run it to see:

$ pvbatch pv_lic_plugin_test.py
Loading on server...
...loaded.
Loading on client...
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

It doesn't work the other way around, either.

Thanks,
Joe

Message-ID: <CAFFYk1XS5wFfTQ2n2zPwNYPe99Z-MZ2xH-LknoqYrzbhTXe3mw@mail.gmail.com>

Currently, when running pvbatch, I am running a thread with optipng
running.  When an image is saved from ParaView, optipng picks the image up
and optimises it.

Just wondering why there is no built in PNG optimisation?  I'm saving ~50%
per image.

Hi Joe,
We recently solved a bug related to PNG optimization.

http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=14426

So you might need to upgrade ParaView.

Oh yes yes..
But I meant keyboard shortcut. I have to compare two consecutive frames
many times and it really sucks to use the mouse for clicking the buttons.
A keyboard shortcut would make my life so much easier...

It's unclear if the readers are being deleted and their memory
released based on what you say and hence not sure what could be
causing the problem. Another thing to try maybe the following:

+ Create a .vtm file that refers all of the vtu files. Attached file
shows the format. just add <DataSet /> elements for each of the files
with correct index. Note the file paths are relative to the vtm file.
+ Now open this and contour it. In parallel, ParaView will read each
vtu file separately on each of the processes.

Well then let me explain I'm hoping to achieve. Maybe there is a better to
achieve what I'm trying to do.

I am trying to visualize the parallel partitioning in my application (not
paraview) by moving separate partitions to different locations. Initially I
was doing this by creating threshold filters on the pvtu file that was
pointing to individual vtu files. For some reason PV runs out of memory
when doing that even though I'm doing this on a large number of processors
(100M unstructured grid partitioned among 256 processors and visualized
using paraview on 128 processors).

Anyway since that did not work, I though I would avoid the thresholds
altogether and load individual vtu files manually to have control over
individual pieces. It seems that if I use pvd instead of pvtu I can also
have access over individual parts using ExtractBlock filter but I'm not
sure if that would be any different than using the threshold filter ...
which did not work.

Is there any better way of achieving what I'm trying to do here?

No.

This really is a good idea.  Mind writing up a bug, or want me to do it?

Oh yes yes..
But I meant keyboard shortcut. I have to compare two consecutive frames
many times and it really sucks to use the mouse for clicking the buttons.
A keyboard shortcut would make my life so much easier...

I was able to reproduce using the 4.1 binary, I'll try with a debug

Burlen,

This is due to a bug in the plugin loading mechanism. For now, I suggest
Joe to only load the "Server side" plugin since that's all that's needed in
pvbatch mode.

Subject: [Paraview] Clear sequence of filter to get Particle Pathlines
Message-ID: <CACBM2g=9nHQ2yb1MozZBdXFL3gadUYk9buMKrbhB_j_u7QkDzA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am currently using 3.14.1 64 bit and I have a cylindrical domain in which
I solve Navier-Stokes equations. I would like to plot the particle
pathlines but I have not found on forums any clear indication of the list
of filters that I have to consider in order to get it.

Is there any? In case it is not, could someone put me on the right path?

I thank you in advance for any help you will provide me.

Regards,

Paolo Tricerri

Is it feasible for the plugin to populate the shift/scale/rotate transform
that is in the panel in paraview? That would be useful for many purposes.

supposed to completely remove the object from the pipeline, thus freeing

Hi

First of all, if you are using apache as a front-end, you should connect on
port 80 not 9000. Otherwise, that means that you are using Jetty as your
web server not apache.

Moreover, you've asked Jetty to tell the client to connect to "viz.local"
which is supposed to be the exact same URL that you are starting with and
not http://localhost:9000/xxxx.

On top of that, can Jetty write/create that
file? /opt/apache-2.4.7/pv-mapping-file/mapping.txt
And can apache read it?

What you should try for your local test:

1) Fix the pw-config.properties

pw.factory.session.url.generator.pattern=ws://viz.local/proxy?sessionId=SESSION_ID
==> pw.factory.session.url.generator.pattern=ws://localhost/proxy?sessionId=SESSION_ID

(I'm assuming the rest of the path are OK and ParaView works on that
machine.

2) Connect with firefox and firebug open to http://localhost/apps/Visualizer

3) Check what is happening in the console,
 /opt/apache-2.4.7/pv-mapping-file/mapping.txt file and the content of the
directory /home/pvweb/ParaView/launcher/logs

This should work. If something depends on source though (e.g. a filter that
is connected to source) than source cannot be deleted before its
dependencies are deleted/removed.

Can you perform mathematical operations (e.g. addition, subtraction) on variables between different time steps?

For example, if I have a point variable, can I compute the difference between that variable at time t with that variable at time zero?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <SNT151-W32656274ABAE975F3DDA02ED520@phx.gbl>

Dear Paraview Community:
I have a problem with performing stream tracer in parallel. It seems that it does not scale when done in paralell.Actually the time increases compared to the serial implementation.
My data set is a structured adaptive mesh of a cube, which has velocity components (u,v,w) at each vertex. I want to create streamlines with Stream Tracer with a spherical point source.I have tried to first apply the D3 filter but that does not help either. Any ideas is highly appreciated.
Regards,P.S: I am doing parallel visualization correctly, meaning that other filters scale in parallel. The only problem is StreamTracer.

The main issue is that stream tracer just doesn't scale well. It's in
essence a serial computation which is very difficult to parallelize well.

Message-ID: <84A21DF2CCDF0D4993FD880AE258BCAF84E9CD@MTMAIL1J.butte.campus>

Hello,

I have been trying to get the vr features of ParaView to work, but I have ran into a segmentation fault. I followed the information on the wiki about configuring the display pvx file and the config .pvsm file. I am able to run pvserver just fine, but when I try to load my state file in the client, the client crashes. My .pvsm file closely resembles the state file on the wiki. The error that is printed to the terminal is segmentation fault (core dumped).

When I run the client in gdb, gdb shows that there is an error in vtkSMStateLoader.cxx at line 500.

I believe??Jetty can write/create. When you said run as?http://localhost/apps/Visualizer, shouldn't it be?http://localhost:8080/apps/Visualizer?if I have?pw.web.port=8080.?http://localhost/apps/Visualizer?give me page cannot found.?

First of all, if you are using apache as a front-end, you should connect on port 80 not 9000. Otherwise, that means that you are using Jetty as your web server not apache.

Moreover, you've asked Jetty to tell the client to connect to "viz.local" which is supposed to be the exact same URL that you are starting with and not http://localhost:9000/xxxx.

On top of that, can Jetty write/create that file??/opt/apache-2.4.7/pv-mapping-file/mapping.txt
And can apache read it?

What you should try for your local test:

1) Fix the pw-config.properties

pw.factory.session.url.generator.pattern=ws://viz.local/proxy?sessionId=SESSION_ID

==>?pw.factory.session.url.generator.pattern=ws://localhost/proxy?sessionId=SESSION_ID

(I'm assuming the rest of the path are OK and ParaView works on that machine.

2) Connect with firefox and firebug open to http://localhost/apps/Visualizer

3) Check what is happening in the console, ?/opt/apache-2.4.7/pv-mapping-file/mapping.txt file and the content of the directory?/home/pvweb/ParaView/launcher/logs

Hi Amir,

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that everyone that wants
to can participate.

You could potentially do the smaller velocity data set in serial and the
larger data set in parallel but would probably take a bit of extra work
with Python. From the Python shell you have access to the AlltoN filter
which can create a copy of the data set on a reduced amount of processes.

Regards,
Andy

To: Andy Bauer <andy.bauer at kitware.com>


So maybe I need to clarify a little bit. I have two data sets M and V. M is
a very large dataset for the mesh structure (~8GB) and I only need to
perform simple filters to it which scales very well in parallel. V is the
velocity dataset which is only in part of the domain and is relatively
small. I want to do streamtrace filter on V.
The problem as I said is that if I do parallel M's filters will scale, but
the streamtracer will become many times slower. So is it possible to only
do streamtrace on one processor serially and the rest in paralllel?

Hi Andy:

Thanks for your reply. So is it possible to run the StreamTracer in serial
in a parallel setting? It would be great if this is possible, because I can
keep scaling of other filters and avoid doing everything in serial.

Best,
-Amir

The main issue is that stream tracer just doesn't scale well. It's in
essence a serial computation which is very difficult to parallelize well.

Hi Kai,

both apache and jetty are a web server, and you can only have one process
using the port 80.
So if you want apache to be the web server, you need jetty to pick
something else than port 80 (and it can be anything).
The only thing is that apache need to be aware on which port jetty is
running so it could forward all the launch request to jetty which is in the
config that you wrote for apache with port 8080...

Hello,

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting has the example on how to list the variables in a dataset.

=============

>>> reader = ExodusIIReader(FileName='.../can.ex2')
# These variables are currently selected
>>> reader.PointVariables
['DISPL', 'VEL', 'ACCL']
# These are available in the file
>>> reader.PointVariables.Available
['DISPL', 'VEL', 'ACCL']
# Enable the DISPL array only
>>> reader.PointVariables = ['DISPL']
# Force read
>>> reader.UpdatePipeline()
# Now check the output. Note: GlobalNodeId is generated automatically by the reader.
>>> reader.PointData[:]
[Array: GlobalNodeId, Array: PedigreeNodeId, Array: DISPL]
====================

If I am doing this in ParaView GUI and I load the can.ex2 data manually and then use Tools->Python Shell to get to python, how do I get a list of the variable? Who would be the parent of PointVariables.Available?  <????>.PointVariables.Available ?

thanks
-simon

Hello,

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_readers#Tecplot_Reader mentioned about pv supported Tecplot format. Where can I find more technical description of the tecplot format and where can I find an example of the Tecplot format that ParaView-4.1.0 can read? I have been trying to load my point packing mode and block packing mode Tecplot data without success. But I know my tecplot data is valid since I am able to use tecplot's preplot in version 360_2011r1 to convert my tecplot ascii to binary without any error/warning messages.

Hi Adam,

There was a bug where if the display is not found then it will crash. How
did you create this state file? Did you create something in ParaView and
then saved it
or did you create it manually?

Simon,

Selecting the reader in the pipeline browser and calling GetActiveSource()
in the python shell should return a reference to the reader.

Hi Simon,

The ParaView tecplot reader comes in through the VisIt bridge so the
documentation on it in ParaView is probably less than what you may be able
to find through VisIt.

Andy

Thanks Andy. I've drop an email with VisIt.

What version of VisIt (VisIt Bridge) is in ParaView-4.1.0?  Another word, if I can get the data loaded in a certain version of VisIt, what version of ParaView do I need to use to get VisIt Bridge in ParaView to be of the same version? The person wanting to do vis with the tecplot data has the vis pipleline setup in ParaView already that he would like to use.


thanks

That might be the problem. Can you load your data in Paraview and save it
and see if that works?

For the interactions, you would have to add that afterwards and save it as
a vr file.

Simon,


Selecting the reader in the pipeline browser and calling GetActiveSource() in 
the python shell should return a reference to the reader.

Say if I want to get the value of a variable in the data loaded,

>>> reader = GetActiveSource()
>>> reader.ElementVariables
[]
>>> reader.PointData
<paraview.servermanager.FieldDataInformation object at 0x00000000197746A0>
>>> reader.PointVariables
['DISPL', 'VEL']
>>> reader.PointVariables[0]
'DISPL'
>>> reader.PointVariables.Available
['DISPL', 'VEL', 'ACCL']
>>> reader.PointVariables.GetData
<bound method ArrayListProperty.GetData of ['DISPL', 'VEL']>
>>> reader.PointVariables.GetData['DISPL']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'instancemethod' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
>>> reader.PointVariables.GetData(DISPL)

  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'DISPL' is not defined

What is the syntax to get the actual value of the variable, say variable 
DISPL?

Message-ID: <CABObKxeEUZqGisXEGYDx8gJPCmrpjCB6_NkO_1GS8ykv2mazcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Kitware is hosting a VTK-ParaView training course in Santa Fe, NM. The
two-day course will be held from May 14 to May 15, 2014 and taught by Sebastien
Jourdain.The course will present tutorials and exercises to mix theory and
application. Using a practical oriented methodology, attendees will learn
about the common uses of VTK. In addition, the course will provide an
overview of ParaView, in particular how to visualize and browse datasets,
as well as how to use technics to post process them on a client/server
environment using examples based on use cases of several scientific domains.



Objectives of the course include to understand the VTK pipeline; to view 2D
images, meshes, and stacks of images; to discover ParaView; to load data
using ParaView; and to implement parallel processing using ParaView.
Additional details and registration information are available on the Kitware
website <http://training.kitware.fr/browse/56>.



Basic knowledge of C++ is a prerequisite for this course. The price of the
course via early registration is $1,100. Early registration is available
through April 25, 2014. The price of the course via regular registration is
$1,375.

Hi Sebastien,

I think ParaViewWeb finally work on my local machine. It seems that I should not close my terminal after I run?java -jar JettySessionManager-Server-1.1.jar pw-config.properties & ?in the background. If I close the terminal, the?http://localhost/apps/Visualizer?does not work anymore. Is there anyway to solve this??

I have apache 2.2 (From Lampstack, in etc/apache2 directory) and apache 2.4.9 (For ParaViewWeb, in /opt/apache2.4.9?directory). Is it possible for me to run ParaViewWeb on apache 2.2? If not, Is it possible to update apache 2.2 to apache 2.4.9 perhaps? I have searched through online, but I could not find anything helpful.?

I am almost ready to deploy ParaViewWeb to an Amazon EC2 Instance, and the server uses Ubuntu. On "How to set up an Amazon EC2 AMI instance to run ParaViewWeb" I believe some commands are based on RedHat Linux system.?


$ sudo yum install patch.x86_64
$ sudo yum install pcre-devel.x86_64
$ sudo yum install mesa-libGLU.x86_64
$ sudo yum install xorg*$ sudo nvidia-config


Do you know what are the Ubuntu commands for these packages? I tried sudo apt-get install XXXXX for all of these, but they don't seem to work. Thank you!

Hi Kai,

both apache and jetty are a web server, and you can only have one process using the port 80.
So if you want apache to be the web server, you need jetty to pick something else than port 80 (and it can be anything).
The only thing is that apache need to be aware on which port jetty is running so it could forward all the launch request to jetty which is in the config that you wrote for apache with port 8080...

Subject: [Paraview] SWKey: Does the PV EnSight reader accept global data?
Message-ID: <5352C1FF.20009@bresnan.net>

ParaView Users,

I have noticed that ParaView 4.1.0-64 on its third tool bar has a filter 
button for "Plot Global Variables Over Time." The simulation software 
that I run has global variables total KE, total IE, et cetera.

To date, the simulation software produces EnSight 'Gold' 
binary-formatted results file sets. To get plots of global variables 
over time, I have contemplated writing code to create an additional 
EnSight results file set that has a single-vertex cell to which all of 
the global variables are assigned. Such an approach would be efficient 
to capture every-time-step results.

However, I would like to be able to put global variables in a single 
EnSight results file set if for no other reason than to make the 
management of simulation results easier.

The question is -- Does the EnSight Gold binary-formatted reader in 
Paraview accept global variables?

Maybe the first question should be -- Does the EnSight Gold format have 
a place for global variables?

I don't know the exact match for ubuntu Package, but I should be able to
right some new doc with the latest 14 LTS ubuntu.

Subject: [Paraview] Superbuild with OSMesa and Gallium llvmpipe?
Message-ID: <CAF0i5JkNLr1BHCY-VU8rc+beyeCXsx13Bkoyr7TPBF9YaYx5OQ@mail.gmail.com>

First of all thanks to Burlen and everyone else that worked to get
SurfaceLIC running under OSMesa. I was able to build pvbatch using the
online instructions and it works well for my test cases.

Has anyone modified Superbuild to use Mesa 9.2.2  and llvm with pvbatch?

I would like to set up Paraview/Superbuild to use the Gallium llvmpipe
backend if possible. I tried modifying it versions.cmake and osmesa.cmake
to point to version Mesa 9.2.2 and use the recommended configuration
settings from the Paraview and Mesa 3D site and I must have fouled
something up since I had compilation failures under Linux.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Call for Papers for LDAV 2014
Message-ID: <CAE32kpVRboAQc8-cozMaW1R0W3OuL+khdMF6yDYwQvcLkK8LUA@mail.gmail.com>

=====================================================
Call For Papers: LDAV 2014 - BigData Analysis and Visualization
Held in conjunction with IEEE VisWeek 2014, Nov. 9-10, Paris, France.
Submission deadline: May 14, 2014
=====================================================

LDAV Symposium:

Modern large-scale scientific simulations, sensor networks, and experiments
are generating enormous datasets, with some projects approaching the
multiple exabyte range in the near term. Managing and analyzing large
datasets in order to transform it into insight is critical for a variety of
disciplines including climate science, nuclear physics, security, materials
design, transportation, and urban planning. This is currently referred to
as the Big Data Challenge. The tools and approaches needed to mine,
analyze, and visualize data at extreme scales can be fully realized only if
we have end-to-end solutions, which demands collective, interdisciplinary
efforts.

The Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) symposium, to be
held in conjunction with IEEE VisWeek 2014, is specifically targeting
possible end-to-end solutions. The LDAV symposium will bring together
domain scientists, data analysts, visualization researchers, users,
designers and artists, to foster common ground for solving both near- and
long-term problems.


Scope:

We are looking for original research contributions on a broad-range of
topics related to collection, analysis, manipulation or visualization of
large-scale data. We also welcome position papers on these topics.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Data collection, management and curation

That's been on my todo list for the cross compiled super build for a while,
but I have yet to find the time for it.

What errors did you get?

Actually, if the integration is fairly load balanced across partitions, the
streamline integration can scale OK. It is highly dependent on how the
seeds are distributed and if the integration ends up clustering on a few
processes. Amir:

- How big is your seed source? Does it span multiple partitions? How many
seed points?
- Do the streamlines stay together or do the move around the domain more
independently?

Are you running on a single machine by the way? I have been thinking about
parallelizing the streamline filter over threads, which should scale better
on a single machine.

Best,

Sam,  
With regards to your last question, does EnSight Gold format have a place for global variables, I believe the answer is yes (sort of).  From the EnSight 10 user's manual:

EnSight Case Gold (recommended format)
- is much faster than EnSight 6 and is more memory efficient (noticeable if you
have a large number of parts or for larger models)
- uses connectivity which can be separate from the node ids
- uses a part basis rather than a global array

The PDF for this manual (including a good description of the file formats) can be found online at the EnSight web page here:  http://www3.ensight.com/EnSight10_Docs/UserManual.pdf

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] SWKey: Does the PV EnSight reader accept global data?

ParaView Users,

I have noticed that ParaView 4.1.0-64 on its third tool bar has a filter button for "Plot Global Variables Over Time." The simulation software that I run has global variables total KE, total IE, et cetera.

To date, the simulation software produces EnSight 'Gold' 
binary-formatted results file sets. To get plots of global variables over time, I have contemplated writing code to create an additional EnSight results file set that has a single-vertex cell to which all of the global variables are assigned. Such an approach would be efficient to capture every-time-step results.

However, I would like to be able to put global variables in a single EnSight results file set if for no other reason than to make the management of simulation results easier.

The question is -- Does the EnSight Gold binary-formatted reader in Paraview accept global variables?

Maybe the first question should be -- Does the EnSight Gold format have a place for global variables?

Hi Berk:
Thank you for your reply. I am doing the visualization on a distributed cluster. And the StreamTracer filter is used with a point source of radius 0.1 and 100 seeds. 
It is surprising that the streamtracer in parallel takes orders of magnitude more time than when applied in serial. I tried to first apply D3 filter and then the streamtracer. That helps a little bit but still the time is prohibitively long (about an hour compared to ~5min when done in serial). I do not know if I am missing something or this is usual.
Here is the visualization that I want to create in parallel (I had to do it in serial because of this problem):https://www.dropbox.com/s/r3kkon3khjdpqs6/foam_3.png
The original dataset is about 4GB.  Here is a smaller one (~1GB) with the state files: https://www.dropbox.com/s/r6lh3sx2wojfva2/sample.tar.gz 
I would highly appreciate any suggestions.-Amir

Thanks Bill, Goodwin and Des for Your answers.
I see, perhaps this should be given as a hint in the docs. The patch seems to be 
doing something similar to my new approach. However, since my polylines 
originate from a vtkGraph, I decided to reorder the nodes/vertices with BFS.

Many thanks again for Your help

Hmmm. It certainly should not be much slower. Even in the worst load
balancing case, it should be at most slightly slower. I will take a look.

I'm trying to build Paraview 4.1 with mvapich2, gcc, cuda55, and qt 4.8.1.
 I've done the iterative configure process and I generate a make file but
make -j 8 gives me this error:

/usr/bin/ld: /cm/shared/apps/mvapich2/gcc/64/1.9/lib/libmpich.a(setbotf.o):
relocation R_X86_64_32 against `mpifcmb2_' can not be used when making a
shared object; recompile with -fPIC

/cm/shared/apps/mvapich2/gcc/64/1.9/lib/libmpich.a: could not read symbols:
Bad value

make[2]: *** [lib/libvtkVPIC-pv4.1.so.1] Error 1

make[1]: *** [VTK/ThirdParty/VPIC/CMakeFiles/VPIC.dir/all] Error 2

make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

The make ends with

Can someone translate for me?  Can I buy a vowel?  The google has run out
of gas.

Your mvapich2 installation was not compiled with -fPIC
(position-independent code) which may not be mixed with code compiled
with -fPIC (which shared building enforces). Either compile a static
ParaView or get an mvapich2 built with -fPIC.

Hi Sebastien,

Great. Thank you in advance. ?Are you going to post the new doc on this page?http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/? once you have it ready? Do you know when you might have it ready by any chance? Thank you!

Yes that is my plan, but I don't know when I'll get a chance to do it.

Hi All,

I had to reset next yesterday to get back to a clean dashboard which
finally allowed me to do a gatekeeper review today.
So if you merged your branch yesterday into next, your branch has been
reverted. And if that work still make sense, you will need to re-submit it.
And to do that you should rebase it on top of master and merge it again. At
the bottom of that mail, I've added some git help.

Thanks and sorry for the inconvenient,

Seb

I do:
- select extract surface
- select connectivity
- threshhold (to say what surface)
I now have the surface of the wing and nacelle visible.

To compute the lift and drag, I need to generate surface normals. But 
this filter is not active.
How do I generate surface normals?
Thanks,

Hi Stephen,

After thresholding you'll have an unstructured grid again. Can you try
extract surface after that again to convert it to a polydata. Then you
should be able to generate surface normals. If you don't have gradients
available you'll want to compute them before you do the first extract
surface filter as well.

Regards,
Andy

Now I have a sphere and want to show all the points of the sphere on a

ellipse.Is there a quick way to do this?
Thanks.

Dear Paraview Community,

 

It is possible to export the coordinates from a stream tracer? For my
research it is important to find the boundary line between two flow areas. I
can visualize in Paraview the boundary with the StreamTracer filter. I use a
point source with a small radius. Now I want to export the coordinates from
the stream tracers. Is there an option to get the coordinates?

 

Thanks Peter

Hi!

My name is Pablo Carpio, I am trying to visualize an isosurfaces of a scalar field with their respective critical points in ParaView. I am using a .cube file for the isosurfaces and a .vtk file for the critical points but the problem is that when I try to visualize both files at the same time I see the isosurfaces bigger than the critical points, actually it seems as if ParaView plot the files independently. 

The desire result is to visualize the isosufaces and their critical points superposed with the same scale and sharing the same coordinates. 

I will really appreciate your help 


Best regards!

Pablo,

What you are doing sounds like it should just work. Just load both files in ParaView and make them both visible.

What do you mean by ParaView plotting the files independently?

Message-ID: <CAGky7R-M6yn+Ka62qTnMWmE8wns=sj2M_joK__GLD_wVuq4tbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am currently using the server--client mode to connect to a server to use
Paraview 4.1.0.  Currently, when I want to export a screen, create an
animation, save a state file, or save a camera file, I am forced to save
the files to my desktop computer, and then transfer the files over to the
server through WinSCP.  Is there any way that I can directly export/save
these files to the server in order to avoid having to transfer the files to
server later?  Thank you.

Very respectfully
Ken

Hi Pablo,
I had similar issues with displaying isosurfaces and points (survey 
stations, in my cases) in the same 3D view. When the two objects were 
loaded for the first time, their relative location looks fine. However, 
when you save the state, and open the pvsm state file, you would see the 
stations offset quit a bit and not at the same scale.

This is a bug. My temp solution is go to the Pipe line browser, select 
the points/stations, under the properties panel, change Representation 
from "Surface" to "Surface With Edges".
Hopefully, this could make your critical points and isosurfaces plotted 
on the right spot.


Cheers,
Brian

Message-ID: <CABomCWEx41DDt2yA+dhUoCsZbv_Wq1x_Bfbd=cpemQ5H-y1v7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have a series of *.vti files on a linux server. They are 2D data.
Right now, I copy those data to local desktop and visualize them.
The drawback is transferring big data.
So I want to visualize them on the server, and get some pictures or videos.

I have no idea how to do it. I've read Wiki, but it is too obscure to me. I
guess i should use pvpython, but not so sure.
Could anyone give some advice?

Subject: [Paraview] visualise particle paths
Message-ID: <CADg6pETwoOhW=ryOQK3Q=ns_8YZ0HZkzT4SgfaWXKiZ4i-e11w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview Community,

I am trying to visualise pathlines for my particle data. I have a vtk file
with point coordinates as input.

As an example this is one input file for just three particles. With a
collection of these, is it possible to view the movement of these particles
over time?

# vtk DataFile Version 4.2
Particle data from file output.0 at time 0 ms
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 3 double
0 0 1
2 0 0
1 1 2



There's a few temporal filters, and I've had a play with them but they
currently produce errors for me, resulting in nothing shown or paraview
crashing. I have looked through the archives, and it seems there might have
been a way to do this in an old version, but not right now?

Thanks
Tim

Message-ID: <b012549f465c41e0a17361c4192bf480@U-MYKONOS2.dif.dam.intra.cea.fr>

Hi Everyone,
When using catalyst from PV 4.0.1 I have an issue (crash) when I use PlotOverLine filter in 2 different cases :

-          If I connect the output to a generic PVD writer. This is solved if I switch to a CSV writer.

-          More problematic, using PlotOverLine also crashes if I connect to catalyst through LiveLink with an interactive ParaView.
I tested it in parallel (32 PE), I haven't tested it yet with a sequential run, I'll do this asap.

Does anyone know about this issue or if it has been resolved in later releases ?

Thanks a lot for any help,

I am assuming you have a series of these files? Did you try naming them in
a way that ParaView recognizes as file series and then animating them?

Yes animating them is no problem. What I would like to see is the path that
the particles take over time, visualized as a pathline. Visualizing the
location of a particle at one point in time is not what I'm after, which is
what I see with the animation...

	Boston, MA
Message-ID: <CANjZAi90jjDkNeMFCiZN3e_bOR09F7nJvODrBWCNgq73owPPLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Kitware is hosting a VTK-ParaView training course in Boston, MA. The course
will be held on June 3, 2014. Attendees will gain practical experience in
both ParaView, a scalable application for general purpose scientific
visualization, and The Visualization Toolkit (VTK), the underlying
open-source library from which ParaView is built.



The training mixes theory and application to guide attendees through a set
of exercises, which are all given in the python programming language. Upon
completion of this course, attendees will not only know how to use ParaView
and VTK, but they will also know how to extend ParaView at run time, use it
in concert with other Python capable applications, and run it in batch
processing HPC contexts. Additional details and registration information
are available on the Kitware website <http://training.kitware.fr/browse/67>.



The price of the course via early registration is $650. Early registration
is available through May 9, 2014. The price of the course via regular
registration is $815.



In addition, Kitware will be hosting a ?Project Lifecycle Management with
the CMake Family of Tools? training course on June 4, 2014, and an
?Introduction to Python for Computer Vision? training course on June 5,
2014. Both courses will be hosted in Boston. For more information, please
visit http://www.kitware.com/products/protraining.php.

Message-ID: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD820ECD990D@umechp9h.easf.csd.disa.mil>

hello,

How do you write the output of the extract CTH parts filter to either pvd or vtk file format using python script? Using the PV GUI, the menu option save geometry will save the output to pvd formatted files.

I am using ParaView-4.1.0 on RHEL 5- 64bit (and RHEL 6 64bit). If I open PV and source a box, and then open up the Python Shell and to the following


>>> from paraview.simple import *

>>> writer=CreateWriter("/home/simonsm/filename.vtk")

>>> writer.UpdatePipeline()

>>>

it will create the filename.vtk file with the box in it.

However, in PV, using the GUI to load a CTH file and then apply the extract cth parts filters, and the do the following in the Python Shell,


>>> from paraview.simple import *

>>> writer=CreateWriter("/home/simonsm/filename.vtk")

>>> writer.UpdatePipeline()

>>>


I got the following


ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Core/vtkSMWriterFactory.cxx, line 314

The same if I run the following script via pvpython (python script at the bottom of this email). It will create the image.png file but not filename.vtk file.

Hi Thierry,

I tested out the Plot Over Line filter for a single process run and if some
of the points were not in the domain then when I used the parallel XML
polydata writer I'd get a segfault. If all of the points of the line were
in the domain though it worked in serial and parallel.

I tried doing the same thing with ParaView master and was able to write out
the file in parallel even when not all of the line's points were inside of
the domain. The live link was still funky with this but I didn't have any
problems with the main data set. Are you able to try ParaView master? Also,
is live link needed for your work?

Regards,
Andy

Hi folks,

To close the loop on this issue, this was indeed a bug. It only happened
when running in parallel and using a cell based locator (which Amir needed
due to the nature of his data). The bug caused to computation time to
increase significantly as the number of seeds increased. It caused the
re-computation of the same spatial binning structure (most expansive part
of the algorithm) per seed. The fix was simply deleting a few lines of
unnecessary code. The biggest performance improved I ever achieved by
deleting code :-)

I am working on getting the fix incorporated into VTK and then ParaView. It
should take a week or two.

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] Python GetRenderViews after Load State
Message-ID: <CAKKV2WvjYgHgK0oiB+pqqeD16rHD0a-ykQOWSdJnLFDgm2GRSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to create a script that will make a screenshot images from all
Layouts in Paraview. This is my python script that I run through
"Tools/Python Shell/Run Script".

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

count = len(GetRenderViews())

print(count)
for viewIdx in range(count):
   actView = GetRenderViews()[viewIdx]
   print(actView)
   WriteImage('img'+str(viewIdx)+'.png', view=actView)
   print('img {} done'.format(viewIdx))

print('END')

Render()

It works perfectly when I create the the Layouts "manually" (from scratch,
without loading the the state file of the session).
I save State File of this session, restart Paraview and load the State
file. Now when I run the script the length of GetRenderViews() is
incorrectly reported by Paraview. Paraview has 4 values in the
GetRenderViews() list instead of 3 (correct value).

Probably a bug?

Thank you,

Martin

Subject: [Paraview] problems building superbuild
Message-ID: <9C15B9B4-DAAA-4F88-BEC3-BBF3099DE5D4@umich.edu>

I am trying to build paraview for our cluster using the superbuild.  I am doing this because I want both the gui and server (we have VNC nodes, and client server users).

    module load gcc/4.7.0
    module load openmpi/1.6.5/gcc/4.7.0
    module load cmake/2.8.8

    git clone git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git
    git checkout -b 4.1.0 v4.1.0

    mkdir paraview-bin
    cd paraview-bin

    ccmake ../ParaViewSuperbuild


at this point I set to use system_mpi a collection of readers etc, but no mater what I do the build always fails with:

  Failed to clone repository:
  'git://kwsource.kitwarein.com/genericio/genericio.git'

I googled around for this and found reference to private plugins you can't distribute, but I specifically disable genericio (awful name if it is a private plugin, sounds like your standard readers).

Is there any way to get more information about why genericio is being pulled in?   kwsource.kitwarein.com doesn't even resolve.

Thanks!

Hi Brock,

make sure that ENABLE_cosmotools is OFF.

That is the only thing that depends on generic_io.
If you turned it ON once, you may need to delete your build tree and start
again from scratch.

If that is not the solution, we will need to digg more and figure out why
generic_io was pulled in.
But I couldn't find any reference in the super build.

Seb
