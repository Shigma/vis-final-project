VTK legacy format is a bit confusing because it follows old VTK terminology.
You seem to be setting the FieldData for the cell data. You need to set
DataObject's FieldData. Here is an example:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
FIELD FieldData 1
aFieldArray 1 1 float
2
POINTS 5 float
0 0 0.5 0 0 -0.5 0.5 0 -2.18557e-08
-0.25 0.433013 -2.18557e-08 -0.25 -0.433013 -2.18557e-08
POLYGONS 6 24
3 2 3 0
3 3 4 0
3 4 2 0
3 2 1 3
3 3 1 4
3 4 1 2

POINT_DATA 5
SCALARS Elevation float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
0.675676 0.243243 0.621622 0.540541 0.216216

No. We don't use texture based volume rendering in ParaView.

Yes. If one of the first level children is a multi-block dataset, you can do
something like:

dataInformation.GetCompositeDataInformation().GetDataInformation(i).GetCompositeDataInformation().GetInformation(j)

Alternatively you can use the vtkPVCompositeDataInformationIterator to
iterate over the blocks as well. It has a method GetCurrentName()
which can be used to obtain the name of the current block.

Subject: [Paraview] VTK EnSight Gold reader issue
Message-ID: <1384FCEA08C04B569A4E1E0D8383E90C@win.ara>


Dear All,

I have been having trouble reading in an Ensight file (just the .case and
.geo) with ParaView. When I try to read it in I get the following error
message:

ERROR: In
/usr/people/gagliard/Paraview/FILES/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkEnSightGoldBinaryRea
der.cxx, line 2475
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader (0x15d2ffb0): Invalid number of unstructured
points read; check that ByteOrder is set correctly.


ERROR: In
/usr/people/gagliard/Paraview/FILES/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkEnSightReader.cxx,
line 386
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader (0x15d2ffb0): error reading geometry file


ERROR: In

vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader(0x15d2ffb0) returned failure for request:

  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1


The mesh is approximately 70 million cells and is about 2.2Gb in size. It
reads in fine using the in-house format we routinely use. I notice the error
message asking to check if the ByteOrder has been set correctly, which I am
assuming is in the EnSight file itself as you can select this via the object
browser anymore. Would this solve the problem, or is something else the
matter here?

Regards,

Adriano

Here is a screen shot. I updated to latest cvs and recompiled. Still  
no joy. I even tried saving the data set to a new file, then loading  
the file. No luck there either. Any other suggestions are welcome. I  
do have the data file if you are interested.

Hi,

I tested my nightly clean builds of ParaView CVS HEAD (pulled via git) + Qt 4.5.2 on
* SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2
* Ubuntu 9.10 Server 64bit
* openSuSE 10.2 64bit
* openSuSE 11.1 32bit
* SPARC Solaris 10 64bit (PV CVS 2010-02-25, nothing newer as I'm having some
trouble with Mesa since Dave's commit Fri Feb 26 17:57:21 2010 +0000)

I see for all builds both point "Ids" and cell "Ids" in the Color By menu.

I also checked the tarballs of all nightly builds since beginning of February
2010 on openSuSE 11.1 and could not reproduce the issue. Cell Ids is always there.

Sven

Hi Agagliardi:

    This is a 64-bit issue that BastiL is also concerned with. There will be
a fix soon.

    Thanks.

Well, this is really getting weird. I have to admit that I have NOT  
tried it on anything other than OS X with Qt/Cocoa. I am going to try  
with OS X/Qt-Carbon (Qt 4.6.2) and see what happens. I guess I'll try  
Windows Next.

I've tried on Os X (4.6 Cocoa),  and Linux and still cannot reproduce
the issue. Mike, if you don't mind a little debugging, I can point you
to the relevant code.

Just to follow up on this. I downloaded the precompiled ParaView 3.6.2  
for OS X (Running on OS X 10.5.8/Intel). This is how I reproduced the  
problem.

Launch ParaView.
Select a Sphere source. Note that there already is a Point Array  
called "Normals" and the Color By drop down will show it.

Run the "PointDataToCellData" filter.
Note that now there is a Cell Based "Normals" array but the Color By  
drop down ONLY lists "Solid Color". Is this correct behavior?

Just FYI, I compiled ParaView 3.6.2 on Windows 7 with VS 2008 and  
running the same exact sequence I get 2 arrays under the Color By drop  
down menu. "cellNormals" and "Normals". Where "Normals" shows up under  
the "Data Arrays" list as Cell Based Arrays.

And so it goes..

Hi Zhanping,
 
Ok, I thought it may have been fixed. Is there a chance it may make the 3.8
release?
 
Thanks,

Dear All,

I have been having trouble reading in an Ensight file (just the .case and
.geo) with ParaView. When I try to read it in I get the following error

The mesh is approximately 70 million cells and is about 2.2Gb in size. It
reads in fine using the in-house format we routinely use. I notice the error
message asking to check if the ByteOrder has been set correctly, which I am
assuming is in the EnSight file itself as you can select this via the object
browser anymore. Would this solve the problem, or is something else the
matter here?

No there is no special option required but you would have to update your
paraview cvs copy as the code got into cvs last thursday.

Can you update and compile again?

Thanks,

Vishwa, I never hit it, but searching the web seems to be a difference 
in how gcc handles inline functions. Try the following:

Edit "Mesa-7.7/configs/linux"

change "-std=c99" to "-std=c89"

make distclean
make linux-x86-64

Hope that helps.

Hi Basti,

Thierry Carrard from the CEA will commit the new version of the EnSight
Reader by the end of this week.
This will be added to the Server/Filters subdirectory of ParaView and not in
VTK native, but you should not see the difference from ParaView.
This should be stabilized next week.

Best
Stephane

Berk, Zhanping, Stephane,

I have checked the latest cvs and the Ensight Reader still has all theses
2GB 64 Bit troubles. Will he fix make ists way into 3.8? Patching it
manually is a nightmare and we have theses large files.

Hi Basti,

No, the sources have not been integrated in the cvs.
We intend to integrate them for the 3.8 release

Best,
Stephane

Stephane,

I am wondering if the sources already made their way to cvs? I still
have the same problems with the latest paraview cvs sources.

So if I were to link the plugin into the client, I would modify ParaViewMainWindow.cxx and the ParaViewMainWindow::ParaViewMainWindow() constructor, right?

So I figured out where the problem lies, but not what the actual  
problem is:

QList<QString> pqPipelineRepresentation::getColorFields()
....
for(int i=0; i<cellinfo->GetNumberOfArrays(); i++)

that loop is 0 to 0 on OS X and 0 to 2 on Windows. But using the exact  
same data file. So for some reason the OS X version is NOT storing/ 
updating something properly. Odd.

Subject: [Paraview] Cells and Points in a Structured Grid Volume
In-Reply-To: <4B8A487C.7050109@rwth-aachen.de>
Message-ID: <C7B14BBE.12927%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Please read The VTK User's Guide.  In particular, Chapter 12 talks about the structure, implementation, and interface of VTK data objects.  It should clear up lots of your questions.

http://www.kitware.com/products/books/vtkguide.html

The Threshold filter converts the data from a structured grid to an unstructured grid (because it changes the topology).  The connectivity and coordinates are no longer implicit, so they have to be stored in files.  Thus, running the Threshold filter can actually change your data a lot.  There is a longer discussion of this in The ParaView Tutorial, section 3.8.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial

Thank you very much. Now things have become a little clearer. Anyway
there are a few things which I do not yet understand.

I see now from the source of the Threshold plugin that the data to be
processed is actually obtained in three different ways:

vtkPointData *pd=input->GetPointData(), *outPD=output->GetPointData();
vtkCellData *cd=input->GetCellData(), *outCD=output->GetCellData();

vtkDataArray *inScalars = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0,inputVector);
//inputVector is the input information vector


where the latter seems to be the array containing the actual volume
data. The decision if a cell or point goes through the thresholding
criteria is made a little later:

keepCell = this->EvaluateComponents( inScalars, ptId );
or
keepCell = this->EvaluateComponents( inScalars, cellId );


This raises two questions:

1) are the ptId and cellId disjunct?
2) if yes, does that mean that the InputArray contains point AND cell
data? This clearly would require additional memory which is bad if you
are working with big volumes.

Also I see the use of a DataSet which seems to hold all the cells of the
volume and each cell seems to contain points ( these must be 8, right? )
I guess these points store coordinates? At least there is still another
array containing only IDs. It seems as if there actually is a bunch of
redundant information stored when I read structured grid, or at least
when executing the Threshold filter.

This would explain why the memory usage skyrockets when manipulating our
700MB (small version!) volume.

I don't want to complain here about anything, that memory issue is
another story. More important to me is that I understand the structure
of this.


Best regards,
Christian

Hey Aashish,

I've been having trouble with it, too, on my Mac (OS X 10.6.2, PV compiled serial x86_64 arch updated from CVS and rebuilt today, CMake 2.9.20100113). Are there any special hardware requirements, then? I can see the GPU Volume Mapper option, but when I switch over to that from the "Fixed point" mapper I get this error:

ERROR: In /Users/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ParaView3/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper.cxx, line 4110
vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper (0x12082cc00): Rendering failed because the following OpenGL extensions are required but not supported:

(Just as this shows, the list of OpenGL extensions it says are required but not supported is empty...) My graphics card is a NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT.

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Cells and Points in a Structured Grid Volume
In-Reply-To: <C7B14BBE.12927%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Not sure if this is the appropriate thread:

What happens in parallel if a connectivity array for a given cell has 
point id's that are off-processor?  
Suppose:

    * processor P0 owns points x1, x2, x3 -- numCells = 3;  cell c1(x1)
      connectivity = {x2, x8}
    * processor P1 owns point x4, x5, x6,x7,x8 -- numCells = 4;  cell c8
      (x8) connectivity = {x7, x2}

What I have found is that setting global Ids on P0 for connectivity 
associated with c1 causes problems?  Does that make sense?  Is there a 
work around?

Thanks,
John

Eric,

Yes you do need to have certain extensions. Now the mapper I have not
written myself and hence I am forwarding this email to vtk users list. I
hope that the original author would respond to it.

I will see if we can produce a better message which could list the missing
extensions.

Thanks for testing it out.

~Regards,
Aashish

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Paraview 3.7-dev: Save screenshot,
 ExtractBlock in Python
Message-ID: <4B8C0448.7070009@yahoo.de>

Dear all,

I was recently faced with two Problems in 3.7-dev om Linux64:

    * "Save screenshot" with "Print" scheme does not create a white
      backgroud. It is only white behind the pop-up window.
    * Showing an ExtractBlock Filter with Python crashes Paraview:
          o eb=ExtractBlock()
          o eb.BlockIndices=[1,2]
          o eb.Show()
          o The same code works for 3.6.2 without any problems.

Any comments/hints on this? Thanks.

Regards

Sounds like an offscreen rendering issue, can you try disabling "Use
offscreen rendering for screenshots" from Edit |Settings | Render View

The points are duplicated on all processes that have cells that point to them.

Not sure if this is the appropriate thread:

What happens in parallel if a connectivity array for a given cell has point id's that are off-processor?
Suppose:

 *   processor P0 owns points x1, x2, x3 -- numCells = 3;  cell c1(x1) connectivity = {x2, x8}
 *
 *   processor P1 owns point x4, x5, x6,x7,x8 -- numCells = 4;  cell c8 (x8) connectivity = {x7, x2}
 *

What I have found is that setting global Ids on P0 for connectivity associated with c1 causes problems?  Does that make sense?  Is there a work around?

Thanks,
John

 Re: [Paraview] Cells and Points in a Structured Grid Volume Please read The VTK User's Guide.  In particular, Chapter 12 talks about the structure, implementation, and interface of VTK data objects.  It should clear up lots of your questions.


http://www.kitware.com/products/books/vtkguide.html


The Threshold filter converts the data from a structured grid to an unstructured grid (because it changes the topology).  The connectivity and coordinates are no longer implicit, so they have to be stored in files.  Thus, running the Threshold filter can actually change your data a lot.  There is a longer discussion of this in The ParaView Tutorial, section 3.8.

Thank you very much. Now things have become a little clearer. Anyway
there are a few things which I do not yet understand.

I see now from the source of the Threshold plugin that the data to be

vtkPointData *pd=input->GetPointData(), *outPD=output->GetPointData();
vtkCellData *cd=input->GetCellData(), *outCD=output->GetCellData();

vtkDataArray *inScalars = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0,inputVector);
//inputVector is the input information vector


where the latter seems to be the array containing the actual volume
data. The decision if a cell or point goes through the thresholding
criteria is made a little later:

keepCell = this->EvaluateComponents( inScalars, ptId );
or
keepCell = this->EvaluateComponents( inScalars, cellId );


This raises two questions:

1) are the ptId and cellId disjunct?
2) if yes, does that mean that the InputArray contains point AND cell
data? This clearly would require additional memory which is bad if you
are working with big volumes.

Also I see the use of a DataSet which seems to hold all the cells of the
volume and each cell seems to contain points ( these must be 8, right? )
I guess these points store coordinates? At least there is still another
array containing only IDs. It seems as if there actually is a bunch of
redundant information stored when I read structured grid, or at least
when executing the Threshold filter.

This would explain why the memory usage skyrockets when manipulating our
700MB (small version!) volume.

I don't want to complain here about anything, that memory issue is
another story. More important to me is that I understand the structure
of this.


Best regards,
Christian

One of the students in my class was using ArbitrarySourceStreamTracer 
on a mac and found that he couldn't see the Source: radio button to 
enable selection of a source.  Another student in the class noticed 
that if they resized the dialog box then they could see the 
control.  So it must be some sort of font/resizing issue.

This may affect other pop-up control panels on the mac as well.

Hey Utkarsh,

That's very cool functionality.

One part of the interface is either not very intuitive or I'm running into a bug: The "is" or "is one of" operators don't seem to work with anything other than ID or Global ID. If I try to use it, say, on an integer point data attribute and do "attribute is 0" I get this:

Warning: In /Users/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ParaView3/VTK/Graphics/vtkExtractSelectedIds.cxx, line 666

Reference Count: 1

I get the same thing when I try to do that type of query on a float or idtype attribute, too.

So, is "is" supposed to work with integer and other types like the "==" operator, or just with ID and Global ID? 

Thanks,
-Eric

Hey Russ,

This doesn't make it any more obvious, but I think you can also see the source button if you scroll down on the scrollbar that shows up to the right of the Input button. 

It only seems to do this on 3.6.2. With the current CVS version I can't get the source button to disappear no matter how small I make that dialog -- the line edit after the Input button seems to be a single line rather than a few lines long now. In general, with the current development version I have far fewer problems with list views and other widgets being tiny and un-viewable on OS X than in the past (e.g. the Data Arrays list in the Information tab of the Object Inspector doesn't show up as 1/2 a line tall any more!!!).

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hey all,

Thanks for the feedback. Yup, I can get it to error out just as you said! :)

I guess I'd seen something about this on the list regarding VTKEdge, but hadn't remembered. Please let us all know, though, if a solution pops up.

Talk to you later,

Eric,

Good catch. I must have missed this one. The problem seems to be that
vtkExtractSelectedIds has a stupid limitation where it expects the
array types to be same. I am going to look at fixing
vtkExtractSelectedIds soon (give me a day or two).

Thanks, Utkarsh -- I appreciate it.

With the way the existing query-based selection framework is implemented, is there any chance of incorporating the chaining of queries to select subsets of subsets? (With my users, I know this is one of the first things they're going to ask me when I show them the new functionality.)

I can add these as feature requests, but it would also be cool if there was a way to specify a precision for some types of selections, like within a certain error tolerance of a floating point value, or within a certain radius of a point coordinate. (I know the "is between" does the former, but for some applications the value +/- tolerance might be more natural to think about.)

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Not for 3.8, but going forward, we do plan to support use of boolean
"and" and "or" to create a long combined query that should address
your concern. In fact the GUI panel design already makes provisions
for that, the problem being underlying VTK framework doesn't have a
clean selection combination support and hence we've decided to defer
that until after 3.8.

Feel free to add feature requests for these. We can definitely look into it.

Wait, I just realized that's not right.  I don't want to build the client application.  I want to build pvserver.  Can I do that by editing pvserver.cxx?  But then where do I put the PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT macros?

Hey Adebayo,

(Please reply on list so everyone can contribute and learn together.)

If you go to the Paraview downloads page:

http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Down near the bottom of the page there are instructions for downloading (checking out with CVS) the current development distribution (3.7). This will have the Custom Applications Examples folder in the source code, and it is this version that has the ability to build "branded" applications.

Let us know if you have any trouble,
-Eric

I have ran the example program BasicApp.cxx and it works, but it uses a SphereSource.  I am loading dicom images or .vtk images.  When I edit the code for BasicApp.cxx to load .vtk files I get an error after setting the representation to volume.  From reading similar problems on forums, I think the problem pertains to colormaps and scalars, but I cannot find documentation on how to fix this in C++.  I'm including my code below.

Hmm, I haven't tried this but worth a shot: try calling
PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT() after vtkSMApplication->Initialize() has been
called in pvserver.cxx

Hello All,

The time for the 3.8 branch is quickly approaching. I just want to send out
a reminder that if there are features/bug fixes that need to be part of the
3.8 release that are not yet checked in please send me an email and let me
know what they are. We would like to make the branch mid March (2-3 weeks)
if possible.

Thanks!

Thanks Utkarsh. Turning off-screen-rednering off everything works fine.
Additionally, the problem only occurs in "SurfaceLIC" representation.
Some ideas about Python probs?

Hi,  I'm unable to reproduce that crash using paraview cvshead.  Is it
possible for you to provide a backtrace from a debugger?

Hey Utkarsh,

That works great -- thanks!

Is there an important reason for the Find Data dialog to be modal? I find myself wanting to interact with the render window to see the positions of the selected points, but I'm locked out, and then it's annoying because if I close the dialog and then want to modify my query/selection, I have to re-choose Point data and enter everything again. Is it just that if someone went and changed the selection through another mechanism, then came back to the dialog, the query wouldn't be valid any more?

Thanks again,
-Eric

Yea, I don;t see why not. You can create the iterator as follows:

In general, yes. However, I have never done this before so I need a
short introduction how to do that.

Thanks Bastian

In a terminal, cd to the paraview build directory, then:

gdb bin/paraview
run

This will open paraview.  Try to recreate the crash, then go back to the
terminal and type:

bt

Copy the entire terminal output to the mailing list.

Eric,

It's that and also the fact the the the complexity if the dialog
increases since then it needs to observer removal of source, track
active view, track active view changes. What I was playing with is
trying to enable only interaction with the view and nothing else,
which would overcome these issues -- but I didn't have much success
with that, hence decided to commit a pure modal dialog for now. I am
going to give that another try soon.

I find myself wanting to interact with the render window to see the positions of the selected points, but I'm locked out, and then it's annoying because if I close the dialog and then want to modify my query/selection, I have to re-choose Point data and enter everything again. Is it just that if someone went and changed the selection through another mechanism, then came back to the dialog, the query wouldn't be valid any more?

Hi,

After full updates on 2 computers (personal and office) both running fedora
12,
the problem persists... on one of them only! The sadness is that the
personal
one is concerned, so I cannot debug efficiently.

The point is that I didn't perform a comprehensive clean on my built tree.
This
is the next step.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.6.2 and VirtualGL
Message-ID: <4B8E55B8.4010203@sara.nl>

Hi,

I'm experimenting with running paraview on a remote visualization
server, using VirtualGL. This package basically lets you run an OpenGL
application as you normally would, but intercepts the swapbuffer events
to read back the framebuffer, which then gets JPEG compressed and sent
to a client machine (see [1] for an excerpt from the manual). On the
client side you get a normal X11 application (using X forwarding), but
the 3D rendering is done on the server side and transported using a
dedicated connection.

When using PV 3.6.2 in this setup I get the following strange results. I
have a dataset on which I apply the Glyph filter. When running PV
locally (without any remote rendering) this glyphing works fine. But,
when I run paraview remotely it refuses to show glyphs for the exact
same dataset and same pipeline. The strange thing is that I can't get
any of the glyph types to show anything, except for 2D Glyph + Vertex.
For that mode I get what I expect.

I've disabled depth peeling to exclude a source of possible
interference. VirtualGL itself should basically leave the 3D rendering
untouched, except during context creation and on swapbuffer events. Is
there anything special in how Paraview draws its glyphs?

Thanks,
Paul


[1] "Whenever a window is created by the application, VirtualGL creates
a corresponding 3D pixel buffer (?Pbuffer?) on a 3D graphics card in the
application server. Whenever the application requests that an OpenGL
rendering context be created for the window, VirtualGL intercepts the
request and creates the context on the corresponding Pbuffer instead.
Whenever the application swaps or flushes the drawing buffer to indicate
that it has finished rendering a frame, VirtualGL reads back the Pbuffer
and sends the rendered 3D image to the client."

I have tried clean builds on ParaView CVS and ParaView 3.6.2 OS X with 
Qt versions 4.5.3 and Qt 4.6.2 both carbon and Cocoa and none of that 
alleviates the problem. Not even the precompiled binary from Kitware's 
web site works correctly. It does work perfectly fine on windows though.

   I wonder where the loading of the file takes place. I have a feeling 
something is not loading the cell data correctly. Maybe.

That's very interesting. You are seeing the issue only with glyph not
with any other filter? I am wondering if you can show two 3D
geometries at the same time and does that work?

Mike, is it possible that it's a problem related to OS X 10.5? I know J?r?me is having some trouble with Fedora, but I can't reproduce the issue on Snow Leopard or Ubuntu (both x86_64 builds). Which architecture are you building PV and Qt for?

Mike, but the cell data shows up correctly on the information tab,
right? So the cell data is being loaded, and even reported to
ParaView. It's hard to imagine why it would be doing what it's doing,
esp. with the precompiled binaries on Mac, since they work fine for
me, on my Mac 10.6  :).

It cannot be a mere GUI issue since from the debugging report that
Mike gave us before, ParaView indeed doesn't report those cell arrays
to the client when rendering. I just wish I could reproduce it somehow
somewhere so I could debug it  :). I am going to test on Os X 10.5 to
see if we have any better luck.

Might be. I'll have to borrow a Snow Leopard machine to test it out.

I am building 32 bit ParaView against a 32/64 Qt 4.6.x Cocoa and a 32 
bit Qt 4.6.2 Carbon. All on OS X 10.5.8. And, again, the precompiled 
binaries from Kitware will reproduce for me. This is also on a MacPro 
with ATI 4870 video card if that means anything.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView and Python: Position of a slice and pressing
	the "Rescale to Data Range"-Button
Message-ID: <F3062708-2A9E-490E-87A2-FED5979D3EF8@stefan-kroboth.com>

Hi!

I'm new to ParaView and Python but I need to automate a workflow as part of my bachelor thesis. I already found out a lot of the things I need by myself. But, there are some things I couldn't find out. 
Is there an option to automatically render a slice when it is moved? I basically don't want to press the Apply-button whenever the slice is moved. If this isn't possible, how do i "press" the Apply-button with python? I could read the Origin-values from the Properties field of the Object Inspector and set the Origin-values from the Display field to this values. But how do I get this Origin-values (I only found the ones from the Display field in python).
I also need to press the "Rescale to Data Range" button when the slice is moved. Is this even possible? If so, how? 

Please excuse my bad english - feel free to correct it if you want ;). I hope the explanation of my problem isn't confusing. I was looking for a documentation of the ParaView/Python interface but I couldn't find any. Am I blind or is there no documentation?

Thanks,
   Stefan

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview in Cave (Integration with VRJuggler)
Message-ID: <285934511003030108u725bb0cco8529acd6533b2ae5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Berk,

As promised, I am sending the first snapshots of Paraview/VRJuggler
Integration running on the stereo projected wall here in Create
Lab<http://create.louisiana.edu/>
.

   - The wall is two sided rear projected with two stereo projectors.
   - It has some kind of optical tracking for both the head and the gamepad.
   - Since it is VRJuggler the same application can be ported to any VR
   setup (CAVE and CAVE like environments) with the appropriate configuration
   file.
   - The program loads a specified state file saved from Paraview and
   renders it in any VR environment supported by VRJuggler.
   - Image 04 shows the toy dataset rendered on a desktop. The image shows a
   simulated head and the rendered image is with respect to the simulated head
   (simulated viewport mode in VRJuggler).
   - Image 05 shows the same dataset but without the simulated head (surface
   viewport mode in VRJuggler).

The project is however at its very initial stages and needs further work. I
am currently in the process of clearing up the code and putting it up in the
public domain for anyone interested in playing with it.

Cheers,
Nikhil

I just tried on a 10.6.2 MacBook with Intel graphics and the Cell Data 
showed up just fine. So it does work on 10.6 but just not 10.5. Go 
figure. All my clients are on 10.5 so I am not sure what to do now.  
Don't really know enough about OpenGL (is my guess) capabilities or how 
to figure out why the CELL_DATA is being ignored on OS X 10.5.

Odd. Then again, this seems to fail on some linux hosts also, so not 
really sure what the issue is.

Mmm..not sure if that'd help, since you said you can reproduce the
issue with GenerateIds filter as well, right?

Yes, go to Edit | Settings. There's a check box for "Auto Accept" on
the "General" page -- check that. ParaView then auto-apply.

I am not sure I understand what you are trying to do here.

Not currently. However, you can always write up a python script that
achieves the same effect. Let me know if you need help with that.

- On a velocity field I had lying around, using the Stream Tracer
displays streamlines. Trying glyphs on the same set fails. Switching to
the slice representation works.
- Volume rendering works for the iron protein sample file, as well as
displaying output of a Contour filter. Saving the geometry and loading
it back in also displays it correctly.
- A simple Sphere source followed by e.g. Subdivide and Smooth works.
Showing the result in wireframe, points, etc. all works.
- From the PV sample data: policital.vtk shows the line map
- Glyphing doesn't work on multiple sets I tried, except for 2D vertex
glyphs. Glyph with Custom Source and e.g. a sphere source also doesn't work.

So, it seems it's basically glyping that fails...

Do you mean adding a Glyph filter twice, one set to e.g. Spheres, the
other to 2D vertex? If so, then this only shows the 2D vertices

By my side, yes: SphereSource -> GenerateIds. You are right: Information
tab shows the celldata and pointdata array, whereas "Color by" has only
point.

I meant simply try creating two sphere sources (with different
centers). Do both of them show up correctly?

Message-ID: <c108b3f1003030813v48111812t8883304f1ec0352d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have had a terrible time compiling paraview to use the pvsever on our
cluster. Not have privileges made it a little harder as I had to install a
local mesa library, cmake, qt4.

We finally compiled it and it ran on the head node and we could see the main
screen.. After a few time of trying, it started crashing with a segmentation
fault error.

I have compiled it as debug version.. and yet can't get any info when i run
it through gdb.

Finally i thought i will just run the pvserver on the headnode (
hpc4.iastate.edu) and when started it, i got the message waiting for
client..

on my laptop , i configured a server and it was of the type client/server
reverse...

and the port was 11111 and the command is as follows

 ssh -i /home/dagarshali/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vishwa at hpc4.iastate.edu pvserver
--reverse-connection --server-port=11111 --client-host=localhost


here i would like to mention that the hostname of the laptop is
olivegarden.. i am not sure if i have to leave it as localhost in the above
line or replace that with olivegarden?


when i try to connect, i get the following error message



ERROR: In
/home/vishwa/vishwa/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-1.6.x/paraview-3.6.1.old/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 708

vtkProcessModule (0x5c14f0): Server Error: Could not connect to client



and the path in the error is on the hpc4.iastate.edu

Any help?

I think you are trying to set the origin of the slice plane from python?  It
would be sliceFilter.SliceType.Origin = [0, 0, 0].

Try entering these lines in the python console for a demo:

Sphere()
s = Slice()
Show()

for i in range(100):

s.SliceType.Origin=[-0.5 + i*0.01, 0,0]

Render()


Note that when you set the Origin property from python it is automatically
applied, you don't need to click the apply button, but the screen does not
automatically render, so you need to call Render().

I don't have a CVS build on OS X 10.5.8 any more, but I booted into it and ran the 3.6.2 binary and SphereSource->GenerateIds shows all four arrays in Color By and three in Information.

Eric,

I've committed a fix to allow you to interact with the 3D windows but
nothing else while the dialog is open. There are still some kinks esp.
with the labels if you change the active view. I am going to iron
those out as well, but feel free to give it a try.

I just fire up the 3.6.2 binary from Kitware on OS X 10.5.8 on a MacBook 
Pro with nVidea 8600M graphics card and the information tab is identical 
to your image BUT my "Color By" drop down only shows "Solid Color", 
"Ids", "Normals", all of which are "Point Data" and NOT "Cell Data".

   So not really sure what is up. If someone wants to remotely work on 
my machine email me off list and I'll get you setup.

I think that's a great fix, Utkarsh!  It seems much more useful now since sometimes the selections are obscured by other objects and this allows me to go back and forth between the 3D window and the query dialog without having to re-enter the info.

Thanks a lot!

I just tried the 3.6.2 binary on a MacBook booted off an old 10.5.7 usb drive backup and all of the Color By entries showed up just fine. The MacBook has the GMA 950 on-board graphics chipset. The Mac Pro I used before has the NVidia GeForce 8800 GT card. If you can think of any other specs that might be crucial, just drop me a line.

Subject: [Paraview] link errors with CVS
Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A19060C087AE8@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>


For a few days, I have had a link errors which I cannot get rid of.

I am compiling with an installed qt4.6.1 compiled from source, shared libs, with testing, MPI, Python, and am getting this:

Linking CXX executable ../../../bin/pvtkpython
../../../bin/libvtkRendering.so.pv3.7: undefined reference to `QMapData::createData(int)'
../../../bin/libvtkRendering.so.pv3.7: undefined reference to `QPainter::drawImage(QPointF const&, QImage const&)'
../../../bin/libvtkRendering.so.pv3.7: undefined reference to `QMapData::node_create(QMapData::Node**, int, int)'
../../../bin/libvtkRendering.so.pv3.7: undefined reference to `QTextDocument::setDocumentMargin(double)'

I saw the comments in CMakeLists.txt about linking errors on the Mac, but I am not on a Mac. (Linux cluster running RH). My compile line does not include any Qt lib.

Well. I am beginning to think it is something with my system. I just 
tried the PV 3.6.1 on an OS X 10.4.11 ppc machine and everything works 
fine. I tried the PV 3.6.1 Intel version on my MacBook Pro running 
10.5.8 and the same sequence did NOT work, ie, Cell Centered data was 
NOT shown in the Color By drop down list. Odd. I'm going to try a clean 
install of OS X and see what happens.

Drum roll please....... "Corrupt" set of paraview preferences. After  
installing 10.5.8 clean from my installation disks everything worked  
as it was supposed to. So that means the only difference is between  
the 2 user environments. Preferences is the first to check. Looked in  
my home directory, blew away the .config directory, launched paraview  
on the "trouble" machine and now everything works. I could completely  
replicate this issue simply by swapping in and out the "good" and  
"bad" preferences for ParaView. I have the "bad" preferences if anyone  
wants them to try and debug what was going on.

Thanks to EVERYONE who helped me with ideas.

Fine! I renamed my ~/.config/ParaView/ParaView3.7.0.ini to
ParaView3.7.0.ini.old.
ParaView creates a new config file, and the cell arrays are back!

Thanks a lot!
For curiosity, I will remove line after line to find the bugging one.

If someone is going further on that .ini corruption, I just noted something
maybe
useful. The problem is not that CellArray are not listed in the "Color by"
combo
box: If you try with
   PointSource -> GenerateIds
instead of
   SphereSource -> GenerateIds
then the CellArray is visible. As the sphere source integrates a normal
computation,
I suspect a sort of "MaxNumberOf..." blocking the number of arrays to 2.

Anyway, Mike found the workaround. Thanks again!

maybe not what you want and maybe of some usefullness...

In the xorg.conf you can put

Section "Device"
     Identifier     "Device0"
     Driver         "nvidia"
     BusID          "PCI:07:00:00"
     Option         "UseDisplayDevice" "none"
     VendorName     "NVIDIA Corporation"
EndSection

I always had to start an xserver (if you have more than 1 GPU you can add 
device and screen sections has needed to xorg.conf). I've been using this 
to render using Tesla cards.

Off course this needs to start X...

Thanks sounds exactly what I was looking for. However I don't really
know how to use it:

source=GetActiveSource()
iter=servermanager.vtkPVCompositeDataInformationIteratior()
dir(iter) -> shows no GetCurrentName()

Thanks Bastian

 Some corrections:

I do Show(eb) not eb.Show() in my script.
Python-Interface is not working in my build directory (do not know why)
so I always have to use installed version. I ran it under gdb:

gdb  bin/paraview

Any hints? Thanks.

Seriously, though, this is cool and it's good to see in ParaView.  Thanks for adding this.  Viva la open source.

Hi Berk,

 *   The wall is two sided rear projected with two stereo projectors.
 *   It has some kind of optical tracking for both the head and the gamepad.
 *   Since it is VRJuggler the same application can be ported to any VR setup (CAVE and CAVE like environments) with the appropriate configuration file.
 *   The program loads a specified state file saved from Paraview and renders it in any VR environment supported by VRJuggler.
 *
 *   Image 04 shows the toy dataset rendered on a desktop. The image shows a simulated head and the rendered image is with respect to the simulated head (simulated viewport mode in VRJuggler).
 *   Image 05 shows the same dataset but without the simulated head (surface viewport mode in VRJuggler).

The project is however at its very initial stages and needs further work. I am currently in the process of clearing up the code and putting it up in the public domain for anyone interested in playing with it.

Cheers,
Nikhil

Subject: [Paraview] errors when trying to connect to the pvserver

Yes, you will have to set the client host to the machine your client is actually on, olivegarden.

If you are launching the ssh command from the GUI, I believe you can use the special string %PV_CLIENT_HOST% and it will be replaced with your clients hostname.

Hi,
I have had a terrible time compiling paraview to use the pvsever on our cluster. Not have privileges made it a little harder as I had to install a local mesa library, cmake, qt4.

We finally compiled it and it ran on the head node and we could see the main screen.. After a few time of trying, it started crashing with a segmentation fault error.

I have compiled it as debug version.. and yet can't get any info when i run it through gdb.

Finally i thought i will just run the pvserver on the headnode (hpc4.iastate.edu <http://hpc4.iastate.edu> ) and when started it, i got the message waiting for client..

on my laptop , i configured a server and it was of the type client/server reverse...

and the port was 11111 and the command is as follows


ssh -i /home/dagarshali/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vishwa at hpc4.iastate.edu pvserver --reverse-connection --server-port=11111 --client-host=localhost



here i would like to mention that the hostname of the laptop is olivegarden.. i am not sure if i have to leave it as localhost in the above line or replace that with olivegarden?



when i try to connect, i get the following error message




ERROR: In /home/vishwa/vishwa/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-1.6.x/paraview-3.6.1.old/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 708

vtkProcessModule (0x5c14f0): Server Error: Could not connect to client



and the path in the error is on the hpc4.iastate.edu <http://hpc4.iastate.edu>

Any help?

vishwa

Ricardo,

Thanks for the useful info. We may opt to start an X server at bootup and then allow anyone connected to use the display. We wanted to avoid the xserver because on our existing system, slurm scripts are used to allocate a node, the script starts an X server for the user to run GL apps. Unfortunately on a newer system with many more cores, this leads to wasted resources as one user allocates the GPU and one core, the other 5 are inaccessible ....

If I understand your question correctly and if PV can start its own xserver
process, then if you boot your compute nodes into level 3, it will not start
your xserver.

What I am not sure about is if PV can start its own xserver?

For example, in VisIt this is possible, and have done it.  We now have
machines with multiple GPUs (2 per node), so hoping that 2 of the four cores
on the machine can be used while the other 2 remains idle (for now).

I am happy to share our findings once we have it working (machine only got
installed yesterday :)

Thanks sounds exactly what I was looking for. However I don't really know how to use it:

source=GetActiveSource()
iter=servermanager.vtkPVCompositeDataInformationIteratior()
dir(iter) -> shows no GetCurrentName()

Thanks Bastian
---------------------

given your source, I'd bet you would need to do the following:


iter = servermanager.vtkPVCompositeDataInformationIterator()
iter.SetDataInformation(source.GetDataInformation().DataInformation)

iter.InitTraversal()
while not iter.IsDoneWithTraversal():
  print iter.GetCurrentName()
  iter.GoToNextItem()

The normals array, that is the one that is used by default in shading
by the graphics pipeline and a few other filters, is whatever one is
designated as the active normals via
vtkDataSetAttributes::SetNormals(). I do not think the array's name
matters at all.

You probably do not want to store the color information in the active
vectors array, unless you want filters to treat it like a vector, ie
you want to do things like orient glyphs or trace streamlines with it.

Storing it as the scalars is probably better, especially if it is an
unsigned char array, because VTK will color by the active scalars
array by default if the scalars array happens to be unsigned char
(either one - grayscale - or three - rgb - components wide)

Thanks, thats exactly what I was looking for!

Nevermind, I don't need this with the solution you provided above.

I guess I have to create a Lookup-Table? It seems that I need the 'scalars' values from the 'Information' page of the Object Inspector (Subsection Data Arrays). How do I get these?

It seems that I'm having another problem now. After creating the Slice, I set the ColorArrayName to 'scalars'. The "Color by" field changes, but the Slice is just red and pressing "Rescale to Data Range" doesn't change anything. When I manually change it to "Solid Color" and then change it back to "scalars", it works fine.

This is the code:

s=Slice()
sdp = GetDisplayProperties(s)
sdp.Input.SliceType.Normal = [0,0,1]
sdp.ColorArrayName = 'scalars'

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
   Stefan

Subject: [Paraview] Problem of Memory distribution
Message-ID: <36c207451003040636i28bf9cafuab0e4cc5bb77c3ad@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have 8 debian workstation (WS) A,B,C,D,E,F,G, and H with paraview 3.6.1. I
have configured all them by ssh without need to passeword. Each WS has 2
cores, thus 16 processors are accessible.  In WS A i have a machine file
consisting of all the machine names. I have copied the same dataset in all
the machines too (I am not sure if this is correct or not). The problem is
the memory consumption of ParaView. By 8 WS there is not 8 times memory
disponibility. I hoped, when I run on 8 machines, that the memory
consumption is 1/8 of the size on each machine, than when I use only one
machine. So what is the reason for this? Do I need special configuration to
minimize memory consumption?

Thank you all,

        Salman

----------------------------------------

Note:

Command line in the first workstation A:

mpirun --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0 -machinefile mymachinefile.txt -np 16
/usr/local/bin/pvserver  --use-offscreen-rendering
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Client connected.

Then in paraview executed also in WS A i add a localhost that refers to all
the 8 servers.

This is the current "hack" that I am trying. In the "Client" part of  
the CMake files I include the following:

set (PV_DOCUMENTATION_FILES
   ${AngReaderClient_SOURCE_DIR}/Resources/AngReader.html )
foreach (file ${PV_DOCUMENTATION_FILES})
     GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(fname ${file} NAME)
     configure_file(
       "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Resources/${fname}"
       "${ParaView_BINARY_DIR}/Documentation/${fname}"
     COPYONLY)
endforeach (file)

After looking through some of the actual ParaView CMake files, the  
documentation is built _after_ all the plugins and  
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES have run. The CMake commands just run  
a "Copy" from the actual ParaView Documentation directory into the  
"Build Directory"/Documentation. Then a FILE (GLOB... ) command is  
run. So I am basically just injecting my html file into the  
Documentation Directory in the Build directory and it _should_ work. I  
hope.

Which data file format?

Not all readers are able to break up the data well, in which case
paraview handles it in one of several ways, none of which is ideal.

Hey Mike,

Won't you also need to add an entry to the paraview.qhp.in file to get your docs to show up correctly in the help table of contents?

Incidentally, while I was just searching through the CVS ParaView documentation directory, it looks like ParaViewFilters.html is missing...

The CMake commands just run a "Copy" from the actual ParaView Documentation directory into the "Build Directory"/Documentation. Then a FILE (GLOB... ) command is run. So I am basically just injecting my html file into the Documentation Directory in the Build directory and it _should_ work. I hope.

Thank you David,

My dataset is of type: "Unstructured Grid"
Otherwise, i have 2 other questions:
1) what are the datasets that the readers are able to break up them?
2) I have not a cluster, thus i copied the same dataset in all WS. Is it the
correct manner to have parallel computations?

Faithfully yours,

     Salman

An ad-hoc cluster like you've got is fine, as long as you have MPI set
up on the machines and are running a copy of paraview's pvserver on it
that has been compiled to use MPI. (Our binaries do not.)

The data type (Unstructured Grid) doesn't matter, I think all VTK data
structure types can be split up (aka streamed). It is the file format
(*.vtk, *.vt?, *.xdmf, *.exo, *.case etc) that determines what reader
is invoked and thus whether the data will be read in in parallel or
not.

If I click on the "?" button when the reader is used I do get my help  
page showing up. But there does not seem to be any "links" to it in  
the TOC of the help which may or may not be a problem. I should work  
on that..

Each time i should copy the same data in all the workstations in order to
use all them. In your opinion is it the good way?

Message-ID: <b0a936c01003040834q18d18c50q4e626d138db4d675@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Attached is the Ensight gold (test.case), associated geometry file for
one 8-noded hexahedron, and variable files for scalar values in 8
nodes. But I cannot visualize the data in ParaView. I see nothing.
When I see in the information  tab, I see 0 cells. What is wrong with
my simple file?

I am using ParaView 3.6.2 in windows xp.

Thank you in advance.

ParaView tries hard NOT to ship data over the network, so every
machine potentially has to read the whole file.

So, if the file format itself isn't partitioned into multiple files
(in which case you could possibly get by with putting the right sub
file on each disk), and unless you have a shared filesystem,
replication onto each disk is your only option.

Again, which file format are you reading? What is the filename
including the extension.

The file format is VTK (filename is MyTest129.vtk).

Yep, the reader for legacy vtk format is not parallel compliant.

In that case what _should_ happen is that each of the n nodes in your
ad-hoc cluster will read the whole file, and then the pipeline will
crop out on each node the other (n-1)/n'th of the cells. So
temporarily the memory consumption will be very high, but most of that
will be freed right away.

If you can read the file, you could convert it to a parallel compliant
format with paraview by reading it in, then saving the data in either
paraview (pvd), ensight, or exodus format. All of those are better
parallelized and won't have the temporary memory consumption behavior
of the legacy format.

Yep, the reader for legacy vtk format is not parallel compliant.

In that case what _should_ happen is that each of the n nodes in your
ad-hoc cluster will read the whole file, and then the pipeline will
crop out on each node the other (n-1)/n'th of the cells. So
temporarily the memory consumption will be very high, but most of that
will be freed right away.

If you can read the file, you could convert it to a parallel compliant
format with paraview by reading it in, then saving the data in either
paraview (pvd), ensight, or exodus format. All of those are better
parallelized and won't have the temporary memory consumption behavior
of the legacy format.

Hi Zhanping,

Thank you. The problem was -- I used wrong element type "g_hexa8"
instead of "hexa8". Now, at least I can see the model. But now I have
two issues.

1. I wanted to visualize transient data, e.g., as given by two files
but with the same geometry. This case file doesn't work correctly,
only 1 time step loaded instead of 2. What is the correct way to write
case file for this problem?

2. Is there a way to define/set byte order in Ensight files?

Thanks,
Hom Nath

Hom:

    The EnSight reader automatically handles the endian-ness issue.

    Since you made some changes to your geometry file ( 'hex8'), would you
please send me the new version?

    Try removing the '1' in front of the geometry file name in the case
file.

Thank you again.

Removing 1 also didn't work. Attached are new files.

Thank you very much David,
I have converted all the dataset in all the machines to pvd. Now it works
very very better. I think there will be no problem as "Error: insuficiant
memory".

It looks like a decifiency in the exporter, it can not do color
mapping, and it will only color entire actors by solid colors or - if
the active scalars are unsigned chars and assuming ScalarVisibility is
on - it can color individual triangles by directly by their scalars.

I have to look at some related code in the vtk manta interface soon,
and will try to backport the lookup table mapping from that to the POV
exporter. I will get to that sometime after paraview 3.8.

Subject: [Paraview] Development Install Tree
Message-ID: <a44d4ae01003041342h47391775lb7fd42d4afae0d04@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Everyone,

I have recently commited a fair amount of changes to ParaView that lets a
developer create a functional development tree that could be distributed.
The development tree includes all the necessary headers, libraries, CMake
files and executable tools one would need for developing ParaView branded
applications and Plugins without building your own ParaView.

In order to create this tree you simply need to enable
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT when configuring ParaView with CMake.
Afterwards if you do a make install (linux/mac) or build the INSTALL target
(windows), a development tree will be installed at CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If
you wish to distribute a development package, running CPack with
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT turned on will also include the development
tree.

For Example:

cpack -G NSIS --config
C:\Kitware\ParaView3\bin\Applications\ParaView\CPackParaViewConfig.cmake -C
Release

Just about all of the bugs related to the development install feature have
been fixed. If anyone has any issues with them please feel free to report a
bug.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Problems loading .vtu beyond a certain resolution
Message-ID: <201003042321.32491.ejkeever@nerdshack.com>

Hello,

I'm using Paraview for visualization of 3D hydrodynamic and mhd simulations. 
My datasets are generated by a code with a structured grid and are exported 
to VTK in ascii format. Data for each variable (rho, p, e, B, gravity) is 
exported as one block in a <DataArray></DataArray>, with point data and cell 
data in 4 similar arrays with 3, 8, 8 and 12 times as many entries as there 
are points .

Trying to open a 100^3 dataset brings about a segfault in libvtkGraphics:
0x00007fffe9742d88 in vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::InsertQuadInHash(long long, 
long long, long long, long long, long long) () 
from /usr/lib64/paraview-3.6/libvtkGraphics.so.pv3.6

Opening a 99x100x100 and trying to apply CellDataToPointData causes a 
different crash:
0x00007fffe7bbfe21 in vtkCellLinks::BuildLinks(vtkDataSet*, vtkCellArray*) ()
   from /usr/lib64/paraview-3.6/libvtkFiltering.so.pv3.6

A 95x100x100 opens and works. My colleague has read that this may be a limit 
in the serial vtk format, e.g.
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013768.html

Is this fixable or do we need to export to a different format?

I don't think that this has anything to do with any limitation. I suspect
that there is
something wrong in the connectivity of your mesh. Both of those methods use
the
connectivity information and are likely to crash if you have cells pointing
to non-
existent point ids for example.

By the way, I don't recommend using the XML formats in ASCII mode for this
size
data. The reader is pretty slow in parsing ASCII files. You would get
significant
read-time improvement by using the appended mode (raw - no compression or
encoding) or even the legacy format in binary. If you must do ASCII, I
suggest
using the legacy format.

Cheers,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] running pvserver on OS X 10.6.2 from a remote client
Message-ID: <20100305.221144.112625326.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I had a hard time trying to run pvserver on OS X 10.6.2 from a remote
client with the system OpenMPI. At the very moment I was about to hit
"Send" for the following email asking for help, somehow I found a
solution. :) In case it is of any help to someone else, I am sending
the mail as-is anyway, but with the solution, which is to add
--no-daemonize to the mpirun command line.

> mpirun --no-daemonize --hostfile hostfile -np 2 pvserver

-----
I am having a hard time trying to run pvserver (built from 3.7-cvs of
around a week ago) on an OS X 10.6.2 box from a remote OS X 10.6.2
client using the system OpenMPI.

First, when pvservers are launched locally with mpirun from the
console on the server and connected from the client, everything works
perfectly. Next, I launch pvservers on the server from the client
using OpenMPI with mpirun

> mpirun --hostfile hostfile -np 2 pvserver

(where hostfile contains the hostname of the server) the ParaView
client can connect to the server. Further, I was able to open a small
case and see its (locally rendered) visualization.

However, as soon as I apply a filter that generates complex geometry
(e.g. Glyph) and the rendering switches to the server, the pvservers
crash leaving the following error message.

pvserver[7023] <Error>: kCGErrorRangeCheck: On-demand launch of the Window Server is allowed for root user only.
pvserver[7023] <Error>: kCGErrorFailure: Set a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged.
pvserver[7024] <Error>: kCGErrorRangeCheck: On-demand launch of the Window Server is allowed for root user only.
pvserver[7024] <Error>: kCGErrorFailure: Set a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged.
(backtrace follows)

I googled for "kCGErrorRangeCheck: On-demand launch of ..." but found
no useful info. Is anyone successful in this usage scenario? If so,
how?

Thanks,
Takuya

Hi,

I would like to label surfaces.  Could anyone suggest a good way to do this?
 I think it used to be available in the OpenFOAM reader although I can't
find this feature with the latest version.

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

Seems to have covered many issues. The includes are now landing in the
correct place, but I'm still uncertain about what is or should be going
on with the bin/ vs. lib/paraview-VER files on installation.

I've added a note to the existing issue:

Message-ID: <c19fcadc1003050704w1b37099bo3a24d04c5446990c@mail.gmail.com>

I am getting this error when building a plugin:

SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file

I finally remembered to try BTX ETX tags, but they didn't work this time:

The header is very simple, here is a representative sample:

#ifndef FACTOR_INCLUDED
#define FACTOR_INCLUDED
//BTX
#define SQRT_3 1.7320508075688772935

double ArcTan2(const double& y,const double& x);

//ETX
#endif // FACTOR_INCLUDED

Is there any reason the parser wouldn't like this?

Thanks,

David

Hi Paul,

Perhaps what you have in mind is the "Show Patch Names" feature in the
OpenCFD's reader (PV3FoamReader)? PV3FoamReader adds labels directly
to the client render window, outside of the pipeline, which makes the
reader incompatible with client/server mode. The feature could
otherwise be implemented into the client side code by sending all the
necessary information (labels, label coordinates, ...) from the server
to the client via information properties. However, extracting feature
edges and calculating appropriate label coordinates for decomposed
cases will require too intensive programming to be done only for
labeling surfaces. For now, I have no plan to implement the feature to
vtkPOpenFOAMReader.

After all, for that purpose I would suggest you keep PV3FoamReader in
your ParaView installation.

Hey Dave,

When building (and packaging) branded apps, is there any advantage to or difference between building against the development tree that's generated through this process vs a "non-installed" local ParaView build?

So far (on OS X 10.6.2) I've run into a couple problems building against the installed development tree {Oh, caveat, this is the CVS from 2010-03-03 because I had build errors when trying yesterday evening's code...}:

1. pq3DWidgetImplementation.cxx.in and pq3DWidgetImplementation.h.in are missing from [installRoot]/include/paraview-3.7/Qt/Components/

2. The library paths in the applications installed in [installRoot]/bin/ aren't correct, so when I try to build a branded app against this tree, the first thing I run into is:

dyld: Library not loaded: libvtkCommon.pv3.7.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/ParaView/bin/kwProcessXML
  Reason: image not found

If I run "otool -L" on kwProcessXML (or on any app in that directory), the library paths don't point to the correct lib directories:

emo2:/usr/local/ParaView/bin> otool -L kwProcessXML 
kwProcessXML:
	libvtkCommon.pv3.7.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	libvtksys.pv3.7.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 123.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.9.0)

Thanks for all the good work,
-Eric

Yeah, I am trying to fix the compile errors right now.

Can you report these as bugs? The missing files should be easy to fix.
Correcting the path in the libraries will take a little bit to track down
why they have the wrong path or creating a tool that will run
installl_name_tool and fix them.

Thanks!

There's no advantage or different when building custom apps against
installed development version or build dir. Since we'll be
distributing development builds from our website, it will just make it
easier to write plugins that work with the distributed ParaView
binaries.

Hi folks.

I ran into this problem recently with STRANDID/TIMESOLUTION as well. For my
files, they are automatically added even though there is no data for them.

 STRANDID=0, SOLUTIONTIME=0

A simple solution for me was to just eat up the token for them...

        if ( tok == "STRANDID" )
          {
          vtkErrorMacro( << this->FileName << "; Tecplot zone record
parameter "
                         << "'STRANDID' is currently unsupported." );
* **  this->Internal->GetNextToken();*
          }
        else
        if ( tok == "SOLUTIONTIME" )
          {
          vtkErrorMacro( << this->FileName << "; Tecplot zone record
parameter "
                         << "'SOLUTIONTIME' is currently unsupported." );
* **  this->Internal->GetNextToken();*
          }

and it'll just continue as if nothing was going on. Otherwise, the loop
exits the zone area and gives you a ton of errors.

Message-ID: <0FE69950-E922-4672-9373-9E8404814903@stefan-kroboth.com>

Hi!

I'm having a lot of newbie-problems here :/ 
When I try to start pvpython in the Terminal I get the following error message:

$ ./pvpython
dyld: Library not loaded: libavcodec.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/stefan/paraview/lib/paraview-3.6/pvpython-real
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap

I get the same message when I try to execute a script with the  following shebang:
#!/Users/stefan/paraview/bin/pvpython

What am I doing wrong? I couldn't find a solution for this in die FAQs or in the Wiki.
I'm using Mac OS X Snow Leopard.

Thanks,
   Stefan

Hi,
I ran into the "empty not supported extensions list", with linux/ATI/Mesa.
By reading, I found that the problem is not due to extensions, but due
to:

if(strstr(gl_vendor,"ATI")!=0)
    {
    this->LoadExtensionsSucceeded=0;
    return;
    }

and
  if(strstr(gl_version,"Mesa")!=0)
    {
    this->LoadExtensionsSucceeded=0;
    return;
    }

(Code from
ParaView3/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper.cxx)

My feeling is that GPU raycast mapping is impossible with ATI card.
My question is: Am I wrong? If there is any, what should I do to enable GPU
rendering on ATI?

Thanks a lot!

Jerome
(ps: I tried with an NVidia quadro and... wow! Thanks!)

If you are using the terminal then you can "export

Thanks, this worked (at least a bit) ... now I get the same error message as before.

$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/stefan/paraview/lib/paraview-3.6/
$ ./test.py
dyld: Library not loaded: libavcodec.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/stefan/paraview/lib/paraview-3.6/pvpython-real
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap

Thats weird.

Message-ID: <4B92F764.1020100@gmail.com>

When building PV on a Cray XT you have to patch the DynamicLoader.

http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Cross_compiling_ParaView3_and_VTK#XT4_ParaView_3.6.2

Is that something that should make it into 3.8?

Just to close the loop on this one, this issue has been resolved in
CVS, and will be included with 3.8.

Looks like there are two spaces between DATASET and STRUCTURED_GRID,
the reader is a bit too conservative and it expects a single space
between the two words.

I cannot think of why this could be happening. Try playing with scalar
coloring on/off etc. for the glyphs.

What happens if you further process the gyphs, say pass through a shrink filter?

Multiblock in legacy VTK? I am not sure what you mean. If I am not
mistaken, with VTK formats, we only support reading/writing multiblock
datasets in the xml-based ones not the legacy ones.

Subject: [Paraview] Call plugin filter from custom toolbar
Message-ID: <4B93D424.1090508@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I have written some plugins for paraview and would like to make them 
accessible in a seperate toolbar. Looking around how this might work I 
found a nice example that showed how to gerenate a new custom toolbar. ( 
/Examples/Plugins/GUIToolBar )

There I find a function that triggers some action:

void MyToolBarActions::onAction()
{
  QMessageBox::information(NULL, "MyAction", "MyAction was invoked\n");
}

How can I change this such that on of my plugins, say vtkMyFilter, is 
executed? Up until now I have to browse the alphabetic listing for this. 
I am using ParaView 3.6 by the way.


Best regards,
Christian

Hi,
here is a code-snippet I used to add a custom source to the pipeline
browser:

#####################################"
      // The objectBuilder make the view factory available
      pqObjectBuilder* builder =
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getObjectBuilder();

      // The server manager model is used for getting the server to plug the
source in.
      pqServerManagerModel* smm =
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel();
      QList<pqServer*> serversList = smm->findItems<pqServer*>( );

      // I use it only on a stand-alone paraview. So I just check the
validity of the
      // built-in server, that serverList.count() != 0 and serverList[0] is
the built-in server
      // It has to be adapted for client/server systems.
      if( serversList.count() != 0 )
      {
         pqPipelineSource* pipelineSource = 0;
         pipelineSource = builder->createSource( "sources",
                                                 "MyCustomSource",
                                                 serversList[0] );
     }
#########################################

If your filter is selectable from the menu, it means that you have a valid
XML
description: the builder will do the right job. Just adapt it for a filter
rather than
a source.

That's right, I am on Mac OS X Leopard and I regularly face such problems.
The easiest way to cope with it is to drag the object inspector out of its container and then enlarge it enough to have access to all the widgets.

Berk,

That may be; I haven't checked the routine that generates cell connectivity in 
our exporter yet. I agree that for larger output sets ascii will be too slow. 
It's already a bit plodding for ~1-2M cell simulations, and we're looking at 
5-20M cells fairly soon.

It just seems odd that so far smaller datasets work fine and larger ones 
always seem to fail though. Shouldn't bad connectivity fail indiscriminately?

That patch only works if you use a customized cmake platform file that
contains the line-

    SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME CRAYXT_COMPUTE_LINUX)

I've been discussing with Bill Hoffman a more general solution.  It will
probably involve new cmake variable that is configured into
DynamicLoader.hxx.in <http://dynamicloader.hxx.in/>.  The variable could be
set by a platform file or a try-compile test.


A separate issue- we're running into fragmentation of the cross-compile
instructions.  There are now a few different wiki pages.  The one Burlen
linked to was written by John Patchet in January based on my build notes and
his own experiences.  My notes are in a github
repository<http://github.com/patmarion/crosscompiling-paraview>and
that wiki page is no longer in sync with them.

Hi Pat,

Shouldn't it work without any changes to cmake because Cray compiler 
wrappers (CC and cc) define __CRAYXT_COMPUTE_LINUX_TARGET on the compile 
line? At least this is true on the XT5. eg CC -v to show what's there.

Hi Utkarsh,

I made the changes as we discussed. The patch is blocked by the mail 
list. I put it here:
  http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/save-cam-config/saveCam2.patch

I ran it through valgrind and ctest and it's clean. Let me know how to 
proceed.

Thanks
Burlen

Subject: [Paraview] Saving data plotted using PlotOverLine
Message-ID: <4B94D679.9030000@rhul.ac.uk>

Hi all,
I am using Paraview 3.7.0 to view a large number of data files, each 
with the same geometry.  I need to load the geometry and volume data, 
use PlotOverLine to extract the magnitude of a variable along a 
particular line, and then save this data to a CSV file.

Due to the large number of data sets I am dealing with, I have been 
trying to use the Python Trace functionality to automate this, and I am 
able to do everything except for saving the CSV file at the end.  I have 
browsed around quite a bit over the past few days, and I understand that 
the trace functionality does not work for save data commands, but I was 
wondering if someone could help me find the Python object that contains 
the relevant data so that I can write my own little routine to dump it 
to a CSV file.

Many thanks for any help you can offer.

Steve

ParaView segfaults when you try and reload a state file that contains a XDMF
file.  To reproduce: open xdmf file, save state, then load it back in.

This is in the latest CVS version.

The problem is with vtkXdmfReader::SetGridStatus.  The offending line is:

Where GetActiveDomain() is returning a null pointer.

There are other places where this it could be using a null pointer but
this is the enough to get my case loading...

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Reader GUI
Message-ID: <6CEE1F8734F04A9FBC8B15BE15A40810@win.ara>


Dear All,

I've hit a brick wall trying to implement a reader. Although everything
compiles fine, when I try to import the plugin into ParaView it doesn't
appear (no file extension). I split the plugin into SM and GUI components
and ParaView says the GUI plugin is not a valid ParaView plugin. I've spent
most of today trying to find the issue, including all the usual ones
(inconsistent reader names, wrong Client path) with no luck.

Now can anyone see anything wrong with what I've done here? And, is it
possible that an error may appear in the GUI plugin due to some issues in
the C++ source file (even if it compiles fine)?

Thanks in advance for any help whatsoever that can be provided here.

Adriano

Hey all,

In CVS the Documentation/ParaViewFilters.html file is missing, along with all of the individual filters docs. Is this something that gets auto-generated when you turn on BUILD_DOCUMENTATION, or has it really been misplaced? (I usually have doc gen turned off).

Thanks,
-Eric

Eric,

I've committed a fix to CVS. Added is a new advanced CMake variable
GENERATE_FILTERS_DOCUMENTATION which ensures that the documentation
for sources/readers etc. is built. It's off by default, since
many-a-times esp. on windows, running the documentation building
executable fails due to incomplete PATH etc. which can be very
annoying.

Any reason why you have spilt them into two plugins? You may want to
just combine them into one.

Okay, so in the past it only got generated when BUILD_DOCUMENTATION was ON, or was there some other process?

Thanks for the quick fix,

BUILD_DOCUMENTATION refers to  the doxygen documentation for the C++
classes etc., and never referred to  the help in ParaView.

Paul,

Good catch. I am looking into this. You fix does suffice since it
would result in the block selection from the state totally being
disregarded. I'll get back to you soon.

To Mark:

Thanks for the hint, but unfortunately that didn't help. 

To Utkarsh:

I normally have them combined as one. I split them to see if it would help
locate the issue, since it is quite hard to debug the XML code otherwise. 


I think I'm just going to have to check my previous revisions to see if they
work and try and find the issue that way.

Cheers,

Adriano

Any reason why you have spilt them into two plugins? You may want to just
combine them into one.

Oops..I should really start reading what I type before hitting "send"
:). What I meant to say was this:

      Good catch. I am looking into this. "Your" fix "doesn't" suffice since it
      would result in the block selection from the state totally being
      disregarded. I'll get back to you soon.

Adriano,

You don't need to put the xml file in a qrc file.  Instead you can add
the plugin as follows:


ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(
 ParaReader_GUIPlugin "1.0"
 GUI_RESOURCE_FILES Client.xml
)


Also, in the xml file you don't want to dot in the ".mesh" for the
extensions attribute.

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] volume viz question
Message-ID: <5dac92e41003080659x50f3d549s6f47f7da7b94e418@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to Paraview.  I have tried to load a 3d data set in vtk format.
That works fine and I can do slicing and contouring ok.  However  I am most
interested in doing volume viz on this data.  I saw that one has to
apparently stuff the data through tetrahedralize, which I did. However, when
selecting volume vis all I see is a box with fuzzy edges. I do not have any
opacity information in the vtk data set.  I can not seem to assign opacity
somehow on the fly.  I gather that I need to attach opacity info but don't
see how it  is done. Can you please help?

The data set is 31^3 floats.  The slices look reasonable but I really want
to start doing volume viz and hoped that Paraview will allow such...I am
pretty sure it does, but I just don't know how to do it.

Thanks for your help.

Comer Duncan

Paul,

---
You don't need to put the xml file in a qrc file.  Instead you can add the
plugin as follows:

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(
 ParaReader_GUIPlugin "1.0"
 GUI_RESOURCE_FILES Client.xml
)
---

This did the trick! Not sure why the qrc didn't work (I have other filters
that use the qrc file with no problems), but the reader is being registered
now and working (nearly) as expected. I can at least get down to finishing
it off now!

Cheers,

Adriano

Adriano,

You don't need to put the xml file in a qrc file.  Instead you can add the
plugin as follows:


ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(
 ParaReader_GUIPlugin "1.0"
 GUI_RESOURCE_FILES Client.xml
)


Also, in the xml file you don't want to dot in the ".mesh" for the
extensions attribute.

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] plotting over time..
Message-ID: <c108b3f1003080941h471974bev12758a3ed7e736f6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a transient data set... it has about 1500 files..which are the
surface data.. when i try to plot over time. it takes like half an hour to
plot it..

The way i am doing this is
1) load the data set
2) select cell by id.
3) plot selection over time

Could anybody tell me if I am doing some wrong and if not, then how to speed
up the process..

Regards,
vishwa

You can use the following:

w = DataSetCSVWriter(FileName="foo.csv")
w.UpdatePipeline()

Well, ParaView has to load all your 1500 files, one after another to
determine what's the value at the selected cell, collect that
information and then, once all files are processed, show the plot. So
it is expected to be slow (except with Exodus files, where we have
mechanism to speed this up when a global id based selection is made).

This functionality is also used for fire simulations.  Although you are not simulating fire (I assume), I wrote up a tutorial here, which may help:   http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Volume_rendering_-_Fire

Thanks for the tip.  That writes a CSV file, but it's much shorter than 
the one written by "Save Data".

The following is my python file.  Perhaps someone could comment on how 
it should be altered so as to correctly save the entire PlotOverLine 
dataset?  (One thing I notice is that the settings controling the number 
of points in the line don't seem to appear in the trace either -- 
perhaps this is the cause of my troubles?)

You're right.  I still think it would be nicer to have a cmake variable than
using the bluegene & cray defines, but I don't object to committing
__CRAYXT_COMPUTE_LINUX_TARGET for now.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems writing Ensight Gold format
Message-ID: <201003082217.38930.ejkeever@nerdshack.com>

Hello again,

After some generous help off-list I have run into a brick wall trying to get 
PV to work with the ensight files I am writing.

I have been testing the case and geometry files attached and have the binary 
scalar files referenced in them. PV opens the .case, throws no errors, 
shows 'energy' and 'mass' under cell/point array status, and then... nothing.

It refuses to admit the existance of anything except the structured grid 
itself, no matter what I do. I can click the checkboxes and press apply til 
the cows come home but nothing works. It _does_ read the scalars because it 
_does_ complain if the files aren't there, it just won't show or do anything. 
Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong?

For the "hard-test" with PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT turned on.

- make && make install
- relocate the built tree somewhere else
- rename the source tree to another name (to check if the source tree
really isn't needed).

After doing this, and setting ParaView_DIR to point to the new location,
building a separate plugin still fails, due to the following bits from
the plug CMakeLists.txt:

   FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
   INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})


The $ParaView_DIR/ParaViewConfig.cmake is found and it contains
references to the now non-existent paraview source directory.

If I move $ParaView_DIR/ParaViewConfig.cmake out of the way, the
$ParaView_DIR/lib/paraview-3.7/ParaViewConfig.cmake file is correctly
found and the build succeeds.

Is there a make target that I should be using to avoid this (eg, "make
somewhatclean") or should I just move the file out of the way and be
done with it?

Right.  As I mentioned in my email from last night, I suspected the 
problem was with the PlotOverLine object, and I was right.  I wasn't 
defining that properly, so the CSV file was empty.

Attached is the working file.

Thanks again,

Steve

Mark, do you mind reporting this as a bug. The feedback you have provided
has been very helpful.

Steve,

When you were saving your trace out, what version of ParaView were you
using? I just tried today's CVS and I do indeed get a correct trace
for the PlotOverLine as under:

....
PlotOverLine1 = PlotOverLine( Source="High Resolution Line Source" )
PlotOverLine1.Source.Point1 = [-10.0, -10.0, -10.0]
PlotOverLine1.Source.Point2 = [10.0, 10.0, 10.0]
....

Subject: [Paraview] Linking in plugin for static build
In-Reply-To: <7ba9d6a31003020637n1da410d7hcf674934d4cf65ef@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C7BBC3D1.18C19%kmorel@sandia.gov>

This appears to be working.  The only thing that seems to be wrong is that the server does not report that the plugin is loaded, so the client gives a warning as such.  Nevertheless, everything works as expected.

Message-ID: <2b35b5e91003090904g37a86b11t5b9f321e76ff0187@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently installed Ubuntu 9.10 on my computer, and so Paraview 3.6.2.

I tried to open a model in .case format, but when I click on apply no
3D model appears.

The same model opens with no problems on a Windows XP and 7, x32 and
x64 plataforms.

I already tried to open it in and out of virtual machines too. Tried
on Ubuntu 8.10, 9.04 and 9.10 and Paraview version 3.6.1, and still
nothing appears at all.

Do you have any clue about what is happening?

Basic support for cave will be included in ParaView 3.8 (it's already
available in CVS). We are working towards the release currently. We
expect to branch later this month and we should have the binaries
available in about a month after that.

Thank you for helping. I can't send them over email (my msg limit is 10MB) so 
I have to upload and link to them:

I wish I could say "any scalar file with 25MB of zeros will do" but with my 
luck that may not be the case.

Please keeping cc-ing the mailing list so that others can participate as well.

Looks like the issue is with your data file. Any possibility that you
could share it? If not try attaching a debugger to a debug build of
ParaView and post the stack trace.

So are you seeing outline boxes then? What the representation type
shown in the toolbar? Is it outline? Try switching that to surface.

I could attach it to you. The problem is that this is a 2GB+ project.
I'll ask the person who did it if there is a way to shirk the file
with less information.

I'll come back with the answer soon.

Subject: [Paraview] Simple problems with vtk files
Message-ID: <1a3131481003091117i67a08045o8da0b0212e2961cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm quite new to Paraview, so i'm terribly sorry if this is a stupid
thing to ask. I'm beginning to panic here. I wrote a routine to
generate the vtk files to render in Paraview, but i can't seem to get
in right. In a 45000 element test the output says

Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1382
Error reading ascii data. Possible mismatch of datasize with declaration.

And crashes. With about 100 elements it gives the same error, it
actually renders something, but it is totally absurd.

This is a surface unstructured mesh. Each cell has a scalar and a vector.

I'm attaching a small example of the vtk file for the 100 cell example.

Thanks in advance,
Best regards,

Hi Steve,

Is it possible you are using an older paraview?  The python code for
xycharts is relatively new.  Instead of CreateRenderView() you should have
CreateXYPlotView().  You shouldn't be calling

   DataRepresentation3.add_attribute('XArrayName','arc_length')

but just:

  DataRepresentation3.XArrayName = 'arc_length'

With the script you posted, DataRepresentation3 won't have the 'XArrayName'
attribute because you called Show when the active view was a render view,
not an XYPlotView.

I tried all the representation types available. From the information
tab, I'd say the Paraview is ignoring the 'waves' data array.

There should be appearing the edges of a cube. This is what is shown in Windows.

Utkarsh,
I was using a development version of Paraview 3.7 provided by friends at 
SLAC.  I've also tried with 3.6.2.

To be honest, I'm still having troubles.  The CSV file is written OK, 
but all values of the field magnitudes are filled with zeros.  I'm 
pretty sure the problem is that I'm not giving PlotOverLine the correct 
"Input" variable on instantiation.

Can anyone give me advice on how to do this when the data-file has been 
opened with a SLACDataReader class?

Steve

Steve,

I don't have a SLAC dataset, but here's the python script for an exodus dataset.

Message-ID: <4B96C4F9.8040105@yahoo.de>

Dear all,

I want to mention that stream tracer looks better in 3.7-dev compared to
3.6.2. I do not know what has exactly changed but I see:

    * much fewer streamlines terminating without reasons
    * no more wrong interpolation of velocities in regions with
      polyhedral cells

Thank you very much.

Regards Bastian

Thanks Utkarsh.

I'm a little confused now.  My script is pretty much identical to yours 
(with the exception of the Exodus related stuff), yet it refuses to 
write the correct values in the CSV file.  :S

I think I'll get in touch with the SLAC team to figure out what is going on.

Thanks for taking time to help me.

Steve

Subject: [Paraview] Animating Plot3d files
Message-ID: <ce609b741003092019o7a747c59k99ebd419d3154669@mail.gmail.com>

I am wondering if is possible to animate a plot3D file.  I have a
time-dependent fluid flow.  When I open my ploy3D file I first specify my
.xyz grid during the 'open' dialog.  Then in the pipeline, I select my Q
files.  My data files are in the form:
solution_ncyc000.p3d
solution_ncyc100.p3d
solution_ncyc200.p3d
solution_ncyc300.p3d
...etc

When I browse for the data file, the dialog groups all of the timesteps and
I can select them all at once.  However, after I select them and return to
the pipeline, the Q file box only shows the first one.  Is there a way to
get the whole set to show up so I can use the animation tools?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Spreadsheet View and Selection - Bug
Message-ID: <4B9765B1.9000507@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I am doing the nice Paraview Tutorial. I have to say it is a very 
comprehensive and well writting starter. However during the Exercise 
2.19 "The Spreadsheet View and Selection" I encountered some strange 
behaviour of ParaView. This holds for Version 3.6.2. and a one or two 
weeks old 3.7 cvs version.

It should be easily reproducable. I just load the example data set 
(can.ex2), split the view and create the spreadheet viewer in the new 
view. Then I select Attribute: Cell Data and select some cells. Then, 
when clicking back to the 3D view and directly back to the spreadsheet 
view, Paraview automatically sets the Attribute to Point Data. That way, 
all previously selections are lost. So it is not possible to select some 
data in the spreadsheet, investigate this in 3d and switching back to 
the data without losing the selection.
Now that I tried again I even end (ent?) up in a segmentation fault when 
switching around cell/point data / spreadsheet / 3d view (version 3.7).

Or maybe I am doing something wrong?


Best regards,
Christian

I compiled the current CVS version of paraview and my model was
displayed and animated correctly, with no crash.

I believe I'll never know what was the problem, but the important is
that it is working now. =)

Thank you, man.

Steve,

A couple of things to note:
* SLAC reader has multiple outputs. So you have to ensure that you
have connected the PlotOverLine to the "Entire Volume" output. The
trace is not recognizing what output port it was connected to
correctly. Use the following to set it up correctly.

PlotOverLine1 = PlotOverLine( Source="High Resolution Line Source",
  Input=servermanager.OutputPort(ll9cellf523_ncdf,  1))

* The data will be 0 or invalid for any location not intersected by the volume.

Subject: [Paraview] Wrapping Hints for Plugin?
Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A19060BFF2239@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

When I modify classes in the VTK core, I sometimes need to modify the Wrapping hints, by adding something along the lines of

vtkMySuperWonderClass            GetNormal                         307  3

which is ok, for a GetNormal which looks like this.
    vtkGetVector3Macro(Normal, double);

Is it possible to specify hints for ClientServerWrapping inside plugins?

JB

My 2 cents would be that I think a good coding practice is to define these
in your source file instead of the header. Especially as it they doesn't
appear to be part of your API. Or even better is to make them const
variables. That way it will actually exist as a symbol that you can see in a
debugger and, I think, optimizations can be performed.

Dave,

Good suggestion about the #defines, but that was not the problem.

The parser still chokes on the header with just one function defined:

#ifndef FACTOR_INCLUDED
#define FACTOR_INCLUDED

//BTX
double ArcTan2(const double& y,const double& x);
//ETX

#endif

Thanks,

David

Hi David, you should copy and paste the exact error message you are getting
so people can make more educated guesses.  It's probably failing not because
of the code inside the btx/etx, but because there is no vtkClass defined in
that header.  You are listing Factor.cpp as a SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES, and
therefore it gets wrapped.  Try listing it as GUI_SOURCES or
SERVER_SOURCES.  See the macro documentation in
ParaView/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake.

Pat,

Thanks for pointing me to ParaViewPlugins.cmake. I set the files as
SERVER_SOURCES as you recommended and that took care of the problem.

Thanks all,

Subject: [Paraview] Wrapping Hints for Plugin?

When I modify classes in the VTK core, I sometimes need to modify the Wrapping hints, by adding something along the lines of

vtkMySuperWonderClass            GetNormal                         307  3

which is ok, for a GetNormal which looks like this.
    vtkGetVector3Macro(Normal, double);

Is it possible to specify hints for ClientServerWrapping inside plugins?

Subject: [Paraview] Dynamically add files to Paraview reader
Message-ID: <adb0f27a1003101137n69cb292by65757f7091b6ea34@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I use Paraview to visualize optical measurement data during buckling
experiments we perform at our institute. Normally I do the
visualization after the test, however, I would like to extend our
capabilities and monitor the results during the test. I have some
experience in Python scripting in Paraview, but I cannot figure out
how to dynamically add files to a reader. What I would like to do is
launch a script that observes a directory for new files, automatically
load the file and update the render window to the last entry. In
pseudo code I would like to do something like the following (not
working):

>> observer = MyObserver('my_directory')
>> reader = XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName = ['stage-1.vtu'])
>> warp = WarpByVector()
>> ....
>> while True:
            fname = observer.next()
            if  fname:
                  reader.FileName.append(fname)
                  UpdatePipeline()
            Render()
>>

Can something like this be accomplished with the python scripting
interface to Paraview?

Thanks in advance and kind regards,

Marco

That was fast...  :) It works like a charm now, but wasn't it possible 
to select distinct additional elements using the CTRL-key? At least 
that's a common feature in such an environment. On the other side I 
don't actually see a use for this ( at least for what I am doing ).

What is much more important for me: Is there a way to do this selection 
with a plane 2D image, i.e. selecting a Pixel ( or multiple ) in the 
image and get the appropriate cell highlighted in the spreadsheet? I 
have to execute some custom plugin filter with the value of a picked 
pixel. How I pass this value to this filter is another story but some 
picking would definetely be a good start. When I load a 2D image, all 
these selection buttons are greyed out...


Best regards,
Christian

There seems to be an issue when global ids are present. CTRL key works
when global ids are not there. I'll take a look.

We don't support selections on Slice representation or in 2D views
yet. On painful workaround is to close the 2D view, open the 3D view,
and show the data as "Surface".

I guess this workaround can be scripted with Python, so I can live with 
that.

Hi Pierre,

though Berk answered your questions already, Christophe Mouton from EDF
asked me to add some details.
I contributed the rewrite of the X3D exporter and the binary X3D exporter
on behalf of EDF.

The X3D exporter is not aware of the composite data types of VTK. It works
roughly like this:

1. Get all the actors from a vtkRenderWindow (it implements the vtkExporter
interface)
2. Each Actor is mapped to a X3D <Shape>
3. Each vtkProperty/vtkTexture is mapped to a X3D <Appearance>, <Material>,
<PixelTexture>
4. Each geometry is either a vtkPolyData or is converted to vtkPoylData
using the vtkGeometryFilter
5. The vtkPolyData is mapped to X3D <IndexedFaceSet>, <LineSet>, <PointSet>

It's generally not a big task to add composite support to the exporter, the
Appearance could be reused using the USE/DEF semantic of X3D.

Dear Kristian,

I thank you for your answer.
I know understand a bit better how it works.

I was actually asking to guys of Web3D how should be managed a "mutli-part"
scene in X3D in this
thread<http://www.web3d.org/message_boards/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2084>,
and I got the answer of using X3D <Switch> which I'm not sure is the correct
answer.

What you describe is interesting and I will have a deeper analysis of it.

Thanks for you help.
Best regards,


Pierre

Hi Ken, hi all.
I was wondering whether to compile ParaView 3.6.2 to optimize the speed, we
only have to set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release in CCMake Tool, or if you need
to set other variables.

Thank you very much again

Subject: [Paraview] Create Cell or Point Data out of Image
Message-ID: <4B98B4B4.3040706@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I'd like to use the Threshold filter on some image data I have (2d and 
3d). 2d images would be any loadable .jpg .tif .png and 3d images come 
from ITK and are converted back to VTK.

The filter is greyed out, and volume rendering is not possible:

Error:

Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data available, even if I 
try to render the 3d volume from ITK.


On the other hand I am able to access process my point- and cell-less 
data in a custom filter like that:


    input->GetDimensions(dim);
    int numvox  = dim[0]*dim[1]*dim[2];
    int numcomp = input->GetNumberOfScalarComponents();
   
    vtkDataArray* inarray  = input->GetPointData()->GetScalars();
    vtkDataArray* outarray = output->GetPointData()->GetScalars();
   
    unsigned char in=255;
    unsigned char out=0;
   
    for (int component=0; component < numcomp; component++) { ...


This is an extract of the SimpleExecute  function I overwrite from 
vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter. So  here I am working on PointData... ?


Is there a way to convert the data such that I have proper cell and 
point data?


Best regards,
Christian

Dear Pierre,

I guess now I understood your intention and here some answers (I hope this
is not too off topic for other ParaView users):

- The X3D exporter just exports the results of the VTK pipeline you
configured using VTK
- So if you implement some kind of "Switch" by grouping two sources and
than extract one of them using VTK filters, this functionality will not be
mapped to X3D, just the active result of the pipeline gets exported. It
would be possible to "emulate" the VTK pipeline to some degree using X3D,
but this needs much more logic than the current exporter.
- Some of the functionalities (like naming the sources) is a ParaView
specific functionality. The X3D exporter has access to the VTK data
structure only, so you i.e. won't find them in the export

So the answer from the Web3D forum thread is not wrong. To pick up your
example:
1. Create the box and the cone.
2. Export the scene to X3D. You will find three shapes. The first is the
center actor that is in the same renderer (you can deactivate this actor in
View->Show Center). The two other shapes are the box and the cone.
3. Surround the two shapes with a switch node and then you can choose one
or the other to display using the whichChoice attribute.

Best regards,
Kristian

Dear Kristian,

Thanks again for this most valuable answer.

There is I guess a slight misunderstanding in the web3d forum. I do not
whish specifically to focus on a switch function.
I would like to keep the possibility to configure (in a specific "selection
frame") the set of objects to be displayed in a java applet using Xj3D and
stored in the X3D file:
- it can be the box
- it can be the cone
- it can be both if both are selected

My question was more to know if it does exist a way to differentiate objects
in X3D, and how to identify them (how can we store the ID of these objects)?
Then (back on ParaView and VTK!), can we set an ID in ParaView to each of
the different objects so that it is possible to identify them in the X3D
file and be able to "select" them in a X3D file?

I have to study this problem more deeply (I am not an expert of X3D format),
but I guess that using the X3D <Shape> you mention, it should be possible to
store each object as different objects.

I guess that even we don't have the possibility to name the objects, they
are stored in X3D in the same order than they are read in ParaView.

if in ParaView:
1 I read box.vtk
2 I read cone.vtk
3 I save them in X3D

I will have in the X3D file:
Shape 1
                  (the box description)
Shape 2
                  (the cone description)

So that in the end, if I keep track of what has been read in Paraview, I
should be able to recognise what is selected by the user.

I thank you again for your help and advices.
Best regards,


Pierre

Dear Pierre,

I skipped the ParaView list, cause it get's very X3D specific now.

You can name the shapes with the DEF attribute. This is not done by the
exporter as it has no access to names.

Some more tips how you could achieve the functionality you descriped:

If Xj3D supports the CAD profile, you could pack the shapes into a CADLayer
and give this Layer a name (i.e. via XSLT):

<CADLayer DEF="MyLayer" visible="true false">
<Shape DEF="Box">...</Shape>
<Shape DEF="Cone">...</Shape>
</CADLayer>

Then use the Java API to do something like this:

X3DScene scene = (X3DScene) browser.getExecutionContext();
X3DNode boxLayer = scene.getNamedNode("BoxLayer");
MFBool visibleArray = boxLayer.getField("visible");
visibleArray.setValue(...)

Actually I never worked with the Xj3D Java API, but I guess this should
work ;)

Best regards,
Kristian

Subject: [Paraview] How to optimize ParaView compilation
In-Reply-To: <dcdb4e1c1003110110q49211442le817d5167b547388@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C7BE4BA4.13409%kmorel@sandia.gov>

If you mean turn on the appropriate optimization flags in the compiler, then yes all you have to do is set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release.  You might also want to look at the CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE  and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE variables.  These are the actual flags that get added, but if you are using the Gnu compiler you should be fine.

You don't really need to worry about the MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS variable.  That is just used when running the tests.  It has no effect on how pvserver gets launched, which you will have to do yourself.

I'm sorry,
I forgot this: MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS variable must be changed (default value is 2, but we have 64 cores)?

Thank you again.

Hi Ken, hi all.
I was wondering whether to compile ParaView 3.6.2 to optimize the speed, we only have to set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release in CCMake Tool, or if you need to set other variables.

Thank you very much again
Luis

Utkarsh,

I tried it and I get no crash anymore. It seems to work fine now.

Bastian,

I've committed fixed to CVS head. The problem was with the SurfaceLIC
representation and not the ExtractBlock filter :).

Subject: [Paraview] VTK-Import, NaN-entries
Message-ID: <4B9A11A3.8020508@gmx.net>

Hello,

I am using Paraview 3.6.2 to visualize some simulation data by
converting my program's output to an ascii-vtk file using a self-made
shell script. These (in fact many) vtk files are then imported to
Paraview and used for animations etc.

During testing, rewirting some code etc., my original simulation data
contains invalid numbers (divisions by zero etc.) which are printed as
"NaN" when output by Fortran. My data conversion to vtk works anyway,
but Paraview cannot import these files since it obviously treats the
"NaN" entries as text or something instead as numbers.

Do you know if there is some "NaN"-analogon that can be used inside vtk
files for Paraview importing? I already tried "nan", "Nan", "NAN", but
no success.

Attached to this eMail there is a short example file which contains an
"NaN" in line 517. After replacing it by "0", the file can be correctly
imported, otherwise one half of the dataset epond is missing and an
error message is generated.
However, I wouldn't like to replace any "NaN" by zeros, since these
values are not zero :-)

Thank you in advance for your ideas.

Regards,

Mathias

Subject: [Paraview] custom vtk filter import into paraview
Message-ID: <20100312105205.79270@gmx.net>

Hello,

I'd like to add an existing vtk-filter to paraview and so I tried the vtkCellDrivatives sample from the wiki. This didn't work (didn't show up in the filters menu list) - I assume because of Compute Derivatives is already part of the built-in filters.
So I switched to another filter for testing purpose: vtkExtractVectorComponents. In my opinion, it should work with quite the same setup in the xml-file like CellDerivatives, except the SourceProxy name, class and label entries. Success here in that way, that this new filter appeared in the filters list in paraview after restart. But: when I want to use it for an existing dataset in the pipeline, I get an error message saying :
----------------
ERROR: In ..\..\..src\servers\Common\vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1051
vtkProcessModule (0C8F8368): Object type: vtkExtractVectorComponents, could not find requested method: "SetInput"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
...
----------------
But vtkExtractVectorComponents definitely has the SetInput-method and on the other hand going the XML-only way of adding filters to paraview, I don't have an influence on how arguments are passed to the function (, do I?)

I hope someone has an advice,
regards,
Ben

Message-ID: <E8419B1DCF2B7744BB436FE879711DEB08B4B3C4@memc053.de.mtu.corp>

Hello 
when I'm trying to run paraview (pvserver) on a single host using mpirun with 4 -8 processes, it works.
The problem is :
when i'm trying to spread pvserver over multiple hosts, using mpirun and a hostfile, the server processes and the client crash when I connect the client to the server.
Im'getting these messages in the client's shell:

ERROR: In /yatest/cae/src/Paraview3.6.2/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x1140c30): Server Connection Closed!


ERROR: In /yatest/cae/src/Paraview3.6.2/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 345
vtkServerConnection (0x1140c30): Server failed to gather information.

If I use the option cslog=/home/.../cstream.log when executing pvserver, it works slowly, but it works on two hosts with 4 processes on each host.


Paraview Client and Server are the same Version 3.6.2
Open MPI is 1.4.1


Has anyone experienced the same ?  
Any hint would be great.

spot the regions where your simulation has fallen over ...

Message-ID: <CEBDC6ED8541AF44A7FFED3221D587951B7F72439C@CLUEX4.medizin.uni-leipzig.de>


Hi,

I am trying to reconstruct data generated by a surface scanner with paraview. The data is structured as xyzuv arrays. I managed to calculate the surface by using the filters "Table to points" and "Delaunay 2D".

But I could not figure out, how to apply the texture to the surface. The uv-coordinates have the same format as the maps generated by the paraview texture filters (normalized position of bitmap).

How can I make paraview using my own texture map?


Best,

Christian

Hello,

Thank you for your answer.

Obviously, replacing the invalid data by some number seems to be the
only way. After digging through the Paraview-source I found, that the
vtk-files are read using an istream object with the >> operator (
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/istream/operator%3E%3E/ ),
that by standardization does not support non-number-arguments.

So I changed my converter script to replace any "NaN" by something like
-0.9999E30. The value -1e99 did not work for me. Obviously, the allowed
data range is limited to exponents somewhere around 1e43. However, I did
not check that in detail...

If anybody has a better solution, pleas let me know :-)

Thank you and have a nice weekend,

Mathias

Ben, I agree that the wiki should be changed to a filter that is not already
available in Paraview.

I tried to do what you did (here is the code so someone can cut and paste to
reproduce):

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="filters">
   <SourceProxy name="ExtractVectorComponents"
class="vtkExtractVectorComponents" label="ExtractVectorComponents">
     <Documentation
        long_help="Extract vector components."
        short_help="Extract vector components.">
     </Documentation>
     <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInput">
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
             <Group name="sources"/>
             <Group name="filters"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
             <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
           </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>

   </SourceProxy>
 </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

and I got the same error.

I'd also recommend a warning/error message be added in the first case - "the
CellDerivatives filter is already available in Paraview" or something like
that, instead of it simply not appearing in the filters menu.

Thanks,

David

New bug report added:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10411


0010411: Development install tree cannot find documentation Description
With PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT turned on.

It looks like the same problem that Paul reported:
www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg06349.html

- make && make HTMLDocumentation && make install

Both Documentation/ and doc/ directories exist in the install
directory, but paraview reports the following:

QTextBrowser: No document for
qthelp://paraview.org/paraview/ParaViewFilters.html

Hey Christian,

If your data already has valid texture coordinates, highlight your surface in the Pipeline Browser. You should be able to go to the Display tab of the Object Inspector and in the Color section there is an Apply Texture combo box that should not be grayed-out if everything is ready for texturing. If you pull down to Load... it will let you load your texture image and you should see it on your surface.

Let us know if you have problems,
-Eric

I haven't really read  the full thread but I saw that everyone seems
to using "make install". A couple of comments about that.

Currently, we recommend users to use "cpack" to create the package
(tgz or what have you) instead of "make install" since currently,
"make install" doesn't support component-based install i.e. ParaView
source cannot pick which "INSTALL" command have any effect based on
their "COMPONENT". Consequently, you might end up with more stuff in
your install tree than expected.

To run cpack on ParaView application, you do something as follows:

cpack -G TGZ --config
<path-to-paraview-build-dir>/Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewConfig.cmake


Once the tar ball is generated, you can then unpack it at whatever
location that you want.

Hi Eric,

Unfortunately this does not work. Neither for the point cloud, nor for the surface. It does only work after generating a map by paraview, but this is the wrong map.

I also tried to rename the columns header the way paraview does, but it did not work. I am looking for an option similar to the "table to points filter", where I am asked which column has which meaning.

Thanks,

Christian

The problem is that the uv array needs to be marked as "Texture"
attribute for the PointData. You can write a PythonProgrammableFilter
which generate an output with the Texture coords setup correctly. Let
me know if you need help with that. Also remember this filter will
have to combine the two "u" and "v" arrays produced by
vtkTableToPoints into a single array with 2 components.

Hey Utkarsh,

Offhand, do you think it would be straightforward to pull vtkAssignAttribute into ParaView as a plugin? This would be nice for these types of situations where attributes are already there (or could be generated by the Calculator) and just need to be assigned properly.

Thanks,
-Eric

Hi Utkarsh,

I am not familiar with Python and also not with VTK.

I was looking for a free tool to test 3d scanner data reconstruction. The pipeline system and the fact that the program never crashed convinced me.

Is it a big deal to develop the proposed python script? What level of knowledge of VTK is required?


Cheers,
Christian

The problem is that the uv array needs to be marked as "Texture"
attribute for the PointData. You can write a PythonProgrammableFilter
which generate an output with the Texture coords setup correctly. Let
me know if you need help with that. Also remember this filter will
have to combine the two "u" and "v" arrays produced by
vtkTableToPoints into a single array with 2 components.

Upon further inspection, it will draw color mapped scalars (of any
type), but not if VTK is mapping scalar values before coloring
(vtkMapper::InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping).

In ParaView that setting is controlled by the  Interpolate Scalars
checkbox on the Display tab.

Even after having previously built everything (make && make
HTMLDocumentation, as well as make preinstall for good measure) the
above mentioned cpack command still takes about 5minutes to compile
stuff and pack everything up.

The resulting tar.gz file may look fairly clean, but all of the cmake
files are missing (which means it can't be used for building plugins).
I thought that the cpack was supposed to pick up what was specified to
cmake, but it didn't seem to know that
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT:BOOL=ON had been specified ... and it still
can't find its documentation.


Another interesting result (I really didn't expect this):
All of the VTK libraries have been eliminated and instead the bin/
directory contains monster binaries: paraview, pvdataserver,
pvrenderserver, pvserver with about 162M-177MB each.


I don't mean to be particular obtuse, but how in the world does one
manage achieve the following:
  A working paraview
  - that is fully relocatable
  - that can be used for building plugins
  - that also manages to find its own documentation.

I'm obviously doing something wrong - could someone please supply a
recipe for doing this?

I just tried this on my Debian machine and the biggest executable in my bin
dir weighs in at 2.5 MB. Note that this is a Debug build as my Release build
tree is a bit out of date at the moment. Also all of the CMake files appear
to be in ParaView-3.7.0-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.7/CMake/ and all of the
vtk libs are in in ParaView-3.7.0-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.7/. So this is
really puzzling. Have you tried doing this from a fresh clean build?

Dave, can you verify this?

Are you building static libraries? Make sure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ON
and VTK_USE_RPATH is OFF.

Dave, can we add a set of instructions on the Wiki detailing every
step to follow (all cmake variables etc) for this?

Another comment about make HTMLDocumentation. Following a recent
commit (due to an issue Eric raised on the mailing list a few days
ago), people should forget about this target :). Instead, turn
GENERATE_FILTERS_DOCUMENTATION to ON and rest assured that the filters
documentation will get included.

Subject: [Paraview] Input Editor - Cramped Input Port Selection
Message-ID: <4B9A8F46.7020504@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I wonder why the input port selection is so cramped in the input editor. 
It is really bad that you cannot actually read out the selections you 
make without moving the scrollbar. Then, after scrolling, you cannot 
change the other input without scrolling back. This really steals your 
time. On the other hand there is that pipeline preview which is nice to 
see but honestly I'd instantly trade it away for a better overview on my 
inputs. I have attached a picture that shows the situation on my PC.

By the way, doesn't anyone have any idea about my last issue? (no 
cell/point data in imported ITK volumes):

Christian

The problem indeed occurs only when rpath is off and you have some
other Qt  version installed (I had Qt 4.5 in /usr/lib). I just set my
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to Qt 4.6 lib dir and then make proceeded
without any issues.

Someone with better understand of dependency resolution should comment
on a possible solution for this.

Message-ID: <5dac92e41003130810m551b85b4hbfe30a5ec3e735c0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two questions related to volume visualization in Paraview and VTK.

1. I would like to know more about the algorithm that is used in Paraview to
do volume viz.  I have used Paraview to viz a cartesian grid data set with
reaonable success.  I can not seem to locate in the documentation much at
all about just which algorithm is being used.  And how come there is a need
to stuff the data through tetrahedralize first?

2. I have recently taken a look at the vtk examples for volume viz.  They
are nice.  However, I decided to take a look at modifying SimpleRayCast.py
to viz my 31^3 data set i doubles but seem to find that the routine which
does the heavy lifting does not take doubles.  What do I need to do first to
make use of this example?

Thanks very much for your help.

Hi all,

I want to see the debug information of ParaView while executing it, so I
changed this->Debug=0 to this->Debug=1 in the constructor of vtkObject.cxx,
but compilation failed. I want to know how to turn the DEBUG flag on.(I

I just tried it again (from a fresh build directory and with
GENERATE_FILTERS_DOCUMENTATION:BOOL=ON instead of "make
HTMLDocumentation") and it looks a fair bit better. I suspect my
previous problems might have been from mixing build and install
directories.

Using cpack, I no long have monster binaries, just that the VPIC lib
seems to have gone missing:

    paraview-real: error while loading shared libraries: libVPIC.so:
    cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

... but it is also getting missed for the "make install" target too, so
the problem is elsewhere. As a stop-gap, sync'ing the library from the
build directory did the trick.


Apart from the inconvenience of using cpack (I really just want to
create an installed version and not a tar.gz that I have to subsequently
unpack and rename the directories to suit my own conventions), I'm a
disconcerted by that fact that the cpack variant also seems to miss
installing a fair number of files (see attached diff from ls -1R
outputs).

Apart from various missing headers, the resulting cpack'ed installation
doesn't work for building plugins later on since it is missing
vtkWrapClientServer.

make[2]: *** No rule to make target
`paraview-3.7.0/bin/vtkWrapClientServer', needed by ...


The installation with "make install" did work though.


This seems to be the current status:
- use separate build and install directories!
- use "make install" -- cpack misses too many files and is too clumsy
for a local install.
- GENERATE_FILTERS_DOCUMENTATION should work, but doesn't.
- "make HTMLDocumentation" doesn't seem to work either


These tests were made against this commit level:

Hi,

I solved my problem with building documentation by building initially
with "make HTMLDocumentation".  It didn't include the filters/sources
(in the help - files existed on disk) if I did a normal make first.

Regards,
Paul

That's indeed a missing install rule, which I believe Dave fixed over
the weekend.

Thanks for the diffs. We'll take a look to verify that the necessary
files get cpacked as well.

I must be missing something here. We are talking about the
documentation for the "SphereSource", for example when one hits the
"?" button, right?
What cmake version are we using?

I am not sure now the compilation could fail. Can you post the error?
Are you missing a ";" or something of that sort?

Indeed - it's been caught. Sorry about the noise on that one.

For cpack to be even more useful, it would be really helpful to some
form of a 'prefix' option (perhaps I missed that one) and the ability to
write to stdout (I also might have missed that one too).

For example,

$ cpack -G TAR- -D PREFIX=platforms/linux64Gcc/paraview-3.7.0
<buildDir>/Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewConfig.cmake >
myParaview.tar


It could also be used (or misused) to install directly without an
intermediate file:

$ cpack -G TAR- -D PREFIX=platforms/linux64Gcc/paraview-3.7.0
<buildDir>/Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewConfig.cmake | (cd MY_PATH
&& tar -xBf -)


"man git-archive" describes fairly closely what would be desirable.

I'm reaching (or missing it) via the Help (F1) and trying to get
information on the sources, filters or readers as illustrated in the
attached screenshot.

One simple fix would be to make sure that the preview window isn't
selectable.  A lot of my users get confused thinking one box is for
the input and the other as the source.

I've committed a fix for the missing sources/filters documentation.
There was a dependency issue. Feel free to give it a try.

No change, still no results.

One thing I just noticed in shock is that when I use the precompiled
3.6.2 binaries from paraview.org I *do* get glyphs when using remote
rendering. So this seems to be a case in which my own compiled binaries
misbehave. Could this be due to using the 3.6.2 sources which require Qt
4.3, while Ubuntu 9.10 provides Qt 4.5.2? I noticed the warning during
configuration, but compilation seemed to work, so didn't think much of it.

[two hours later]
And sure enough, after compiling Qt 4.3.5 and recompiling Paraview
against it I now have working glyphs when using remote rendering...

As a user, may I present three suggestions, two of which should be very 
easy and still yield an improvement.

1) remove the Pipeline Preview: This may be rude because it's somehow 
nice. But then again, you cannot change what happens to the pipeline 
anyway. Also, I don't think one would change his mind about the 
selection of the inputs just because the Pipeline Preview shows 
something unsuspected. Most of the time the user knows what he is doing 
and wants to quickly and easily select his inputs. The actual layout 
works against this intend. The Pipeline Preview can be included again 
once a nice layout is found.

2) hide the Pipeline Preview and make it visible if the user wants to

3) change the layout such that the inputs are shown on top and let QT 
manage the form's height. You normally don't use so many inputs, so 
this  most probably would never lead to problems.


Best regards,
Christian

If you have more than one processor core per node, and the problem only
occurs when you use more than one process per node, then try adding

-mca btl_sm_num_fifos 16

to your mpirun/mpiexec/orterun command line. Replace "16" with a number
grater than or equal to twice the number of processes per node.

Open MPI has this bug with certain compilers :

Utkarsh,

I can confirm that help for sources/filters/readers/writers works like a charm
again.

Thanks
Sven

Subject: [Paraview] Problems writing Ensight Gold format
In-Reply-To: <201003091023.52153.ejkeever@nerdshack.com>
References: <201003082217.38930.ejkeever@nerdshack.com>

Hi Erik:

   Debug shows that your cell data files (test*.00) are not in valid EnSight
Gold format.
A valid binary 'Scalar per Element' (i.e., scalar cell data) file begins
with a 80-char description
line, followed by a 80-char line that contains token 'part'. Then comes with
an integer (in binary)
that serves as the part / zone Id. What follows is a list of element (cell)
types with the
associated element (cell) based scalar values. Specifically, each element /
cell type occupies
a 80-char line. The 'block' section should come at the very end of a 'scalar
per element' file,
whereas the 'block' token emerges at the third line (while actually the
aformentioned integer value in binary
--- the part/zone Id is expected) of your file.

   Please note that even a binary EnSight Gold file usually contains chars
(e.g., description
lines and EnSight tokens) and in this case, the chars are encoded in the
file on a 80-char-line basis
and each such line ends with a cariage-return symbol.
   Please reference pp. 536, the EnSight User Manual (
http://vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/ensight/docs82/UserManual.pdf)
to find the valid format for a 'scalar per element' file. Also, you may use
EnSight Format Checker
(http://aero.ist.utl.pt/~rreis/ens_checker.32 and
http://aero.ist.utl.pt/~rreis/ens_checker.64)
to check your EnSight files, though these two checkers are 'necessary' but
not 'sufficient'.

I am not sure what the "Pipeline Preview" is, but if you mean the 
"Pipeline Browser," I use the Pipeline Browser extensively: (1) to A-B 
visibility for comparisons, (2) to fork additional pipelines, and (3) to 
alter what is displaced in multi-view scenarios, that is, frequently 
switch keyboard focus for tweaking individual display contents.  Thus, 
please don't remove the Pipeline Browser, The Pipeline Browser, along 
with the filters is one of PV's major strengths for me. This also 
applies to the fact that ParaView can access multiple results databases 
(even in different formats); one cannot do this and keep it all straight 
without the Pipleline Browser.

Hey Utkarsh,

That looks great -- thanks for updating it!

Some small question regarding the Compiling on the Mac section: 

Do we really need the suggestion of VTK_USE_CARBON=ON any more now that Qt 4.6 supports Cocoa just fine? (There could be a note saying that it should automatically detect your Qt setting, but maybe it's still needed...) 

Also, maybe the note about VTK_USE_RPATH=ON could be moved up to the Description of the build flag (since now it's a little deceptive -- I, at least, have had trouble building on the Mac with that flag OFF, and as written, if you don't read down the rest of the page, it seems to suggest it's possible or even advised). 

Then, if these are moved, that section could just be removed.

If you think these changes would be okay, I can make them, I just wanted to check with you first.

Thanks,
-Eric

P.S. It may be nice to link to this page, too, from the Packaging section of Writing_Custom_Applications since the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_INSTALL_RULES_FILE stuff isn't covered there... (or, just copy and paste that little bit over to the branding page)

Agreed. We'll need to look into this to make is as painless as possible.


> Also, maybe the note about VTK_USE_RPATH=ON could be moved up to the Description of the build flag (since now it's a little deceptive -- I, at least, have had trouble building on the Mac with that flag OFF, and as written, if you don't read down the rest of the page, it seems to suggest it's possible or even advised).

RPATH=OFF should work on Mac as well. We've been doing that to build
the server executable tar-balls for the Mac. I will have to test that
one out.

Well when I was thinking of PARAVIEW_EXTRA_INSTALL_RULES_FILE I was
only thinking of ParaView packaging, not custom app packaging. Since
if custom apps want to include some install rules for additional
libraries, they can always just put those rules in their
CMakeLists.txt. So, I am not sure how much use
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_INSTALL_RULES_FILE is going to be for custom
applications. The original goal was to make our life easier for
packaging on different platforms for building the ParaView binaries,
since invariably we have to install custom dll's or so's based on the
platform.

Message-ID: <3b6093ef1003151444v576a3b89h90997989bbdd9c87@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I need to perform some computations on my data and for speed reasons I would
like to use fortran to accomplish this.  Using pvpython I can get the data I
need, and using f2py I can wrap my fortran subroutine but I can only get
f2py to create a .so file which pvpython doesn't seem to recognize when I
try to import it as a module.  Can someone tell me how to either:

1.  Get pvpython to recognize the .so file created by f2py or

2.  Use f2py to generate a .py file instead of a .so file

Thanks in advance,

Peter.

Hey Peter,

What platform are you using and how are you trying to import the .so file? On my Mac, any of the VTK libraries (my own or original VTK) which are wrapped in Python end up as .so files, and they load just fine. What is python saying when it "doesn't seem to recognize" them?

Hi Eric,

I'm use Fedora 11 64-bit.  I tried a few more things so maybe this will
help.  Using f2py gives me a .so file (streamfunc.so) which I can then
import in a pvpython script using:

import streamfunc

My problem is that I have a programmable filter which needs this module but
when I import it in my programmable filter script I get the error:

ImportError: No module named streamfunc

So it seems the problem is with the programmable filter and not with
pvpython itself.

Message-ID: <5a8c03ba1003151527h591652f7o3b2aca347d5638f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm having trouble visualizing a transient simulation with exodusII
files. If I open each file one at the time everything works fine, but i cant
run a simulation w all the files, with the corresponding time steps. Files
are named out.ex2.010, out.ex2.011, out.ex2.012 and so on. I'm loading the
files w the following configuration:
File prefix: PATH/out.ex2.0
File pattern: %s%i
First file index: 10
Last file index: 50

I think it's worth mentioning that each file has a different mesh of same
physical dimensions (i.e. refined mesh). Also the time information in the
object inspector reads:
Index   Value
0             0
...           ...
8             0
9           0.25 (just the last index have value!=0, that value correspond
to the 1st time step of the first file out.ex2.010)

Why isn't working? I'll appreciate any suggestion. Thanks a lot,

Nestor Solalinde

Hey Peter,

Maybe the problem is that the PYTHONPATH that the programmable filter knows doesn't contain your module? 

Try adding at the beginning of your Programmable Filter:

import sys
sys.path.append('/Dir/of/your/library')

so it can see things in your library directory and see if your import statement works after that.

I don't know the "real" way, offhand, to include new directories in the PYTHONPATH of the programmable filter (i.e. I don't know if the PYTHONPATH environment variable affects the PPF).

That seems to do the trick.

Another wrinkle is that the PYTHONPATH the programmable filter sees is on the server machine and not the client. So your streamfunc.so has to be on the server machine. If you are running the builtin server it won't matter, but it is still useful information for the thread's sake.

Also, you might put the PYTHONPATH in the text box at the bottom of the properties panel of the programmable filter.

I agree, the pipeline preview is confusing and for the most part
useless. Unless people object, I'd vote for removing it as well.

Attached is a sample mockup. In case of filters like Append which have
single input port, but multiple input connections, the use can type in
a comma separated list of the inputs in the input field or select
multiple items using the pipeline browser in the dialog.

So I tried to download the 3.6.1, but it still says "paraview: Mach-O
executable i386".

I have the MacOS 10.5.8. Is there a way to get a 64-bit executable of
paraview?

You will have to build ParaView against a 64 bit build of Qt yourself.
Which means compiling Qt as a Cocoa Framework, then compiling ParaView
against that version of Qt. There are some minor user interface issues
due mainly to the Cocoa Port of Qt not being up to the same level as
the Carbon version but you can usually work through those.

Hi Paraview users and developers,

I'm wondering if there is a 64-but version of paraview for MacOS. don't seem
to see one under 3.6.2. The 3.6.1 one for Macintosh OS X, Tiger and Leopard
(Intel) is in 64 bits right?

Thanks,
Karen

My 2 cents on this :
It seems to me that the input list is provided in alphabetical order. In my
case I have a lot of custom plugins that take 2 inputs, one being
vtkImageData
and the other a vtkPolyData (such a stream tracer with custom source).
Depending on wich is the 'principal' input, the default input setting of
this
panel have non-corresponding type. For instance, the Image input is set
to an existing PointSet.

I don't know if I am clear enough, but maybe you can try with the stream
tracer
with custom source: in the current configuration, there is no problem. But I
am
quite sure that if you rename the 2nd input "Source" to "ArbitrarySource" in
the
filters.xml, you will understand this tiny problem.

Hi,

It may have taken a bit too long, but we are pleased to inform that we
have finished the Japanese translation of The ParaView Tutorial for
ParaView 3.6 and it is now publicly available.

http://oshima.eng.niigata-u.ac.jp/ParaViewTutorial-jp.pdf

We heard that the previous translation (the SC08 version) was used not
only by indivisuals but also for in-house teachings in some industrial
companies. Hence we believe that the translation also helps to enlarge
the community as well.

Many thnaks to Kenneth Moreland for the nice tutorial and providing
the LaTeX sources and images.

p.s.
Am I allowd to create an account and update the wiki
http://paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial
or can I ask to somebody?

Good morning,

I have basic question: when calculating the gradient of a vector the output are 9 scalars ranging from 0 to 8. What do they represent? Are they ordered linewise, columnwise or first diagonal entries... ?
Thanks for the help

could you give me some hints or catchwords how to realize that filter? Perhaps a link to tutorial you recommend?

attribute for the PointData. You can write a PythonProgrammableFilter
which generate an output with the Texture coords setup correctly. Let
me know if you need help with that. Also remember this filter will
have to combine the two "u" and "v" arrays produced by
vtkTableToPoints into a single array with 2 components.

Things built fine for me on debian/sid/amd64. I can't reproduce these
errors.

If you're using the debian (or ubuntu) source packages, maybe you can
get more specific help by asking on a debian/ubuntu list.

Christian,

Sorry I've been meaning to write up a quick  script for you. For
starters take a look at:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_recipes

Here's the algorithm:
* Create a new vtkDoubleArray (or another vtkDataArray subclass) with
2 components and number of tuples = number of points.
* Get access the to two input arrays you want to use an texture coordinates.
* Iterate over each value in the two array and insert them as the two
components in the new array
* Set the new array as the TCoords in the output's point data.

Hey Karen,

No, the 3.6.1 binary for Intel is i386 architecture. Like Mike said yesterday, you'll have to build your own version of Qt 4.6.2 with x86_64 architecture and Cocoa, and then build ParaView from source against that Qt build, itself with x86_64 arch, too.

I'm not sure if there are any issues with 64-bit ParaView Python support in Leopard since for OS X 10.5 you can't get (as far as I know) a 64-bit python executable...?

Talk to you later,
-Eric

I am not sure why that could be the case. The only thing that happens
on setting cslog is that each the server process starts writing out an
output log file. Also I am not sure why mpi would hang on attaching a
debugger. Try debugging by just running 2 processes. Is it possible
you have a  broken MPI?

Message-ID: <705C2BBC-D621-4E7D-BDF8-6D3C8C298072@cs.duke.edu>

Hey all,

I'm having trouble today packaging my branded app on 64-bit Ubuntu. I'm just trying to run ccmake to configure, I have  BUILD_SHARED: ON, but it has trouble when I turn CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH:ON. It seems to be having trouble expanding ParaView_SOURCE_DIR on line 172 of ParaViewMacros.cmake, giving me this error during configure stage:

CMake Error: File /Servers/Executables/pv-forward.c.in does not exist.

 CMake Error at /home/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ParaView3/CMake/ParaViewMacros.cmake:172
 (CONFIGURE_FILE):
   configure_file Problem configuring file
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   /home/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ParaView3/CMake/ParaViewBranding.cmake:263
 (add_executable_with_forwarding2)
   MSI_Strip3/CMakeLists.txt:48 (build_paraview_client)

Any clue whether this is something I have set up wrong, or is it a bug? I rebuilt paraview yesterday with a new build of Qt, so I'm not sure if I screwed something up since this used to work fine.

(CVS 2010-03-15 ParaView, Qt 4.6.2 from source, ffmpeg, CMake 2.6-patch 4)

Thanks,
-Eric

Message-ID: <c9adba421003160735x8a36097me64c20681bd7f2f3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there something I need to do to my reader in order to load in
multiple files that I can animate with?  I have put numbers in the
file names and loaded up file.*.dat but stepping the time doesn't work
(and it doesn't show timesteps in the information tab in the object
inspector).

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Mark,

vtkWrapClientServer should be installed now correctly in the bin dir.
Apparently there was a bug in the install rule that installed it. Thanks for
catching that!

Hey Greg,

Thanks for passing along that info. I had forgotten the PPF had a spot for extra PYTHONPATH entries, and that's a good point about behavior under separate client/server.

So, Peter, if you're doing this from pvpython instead of the GUI, the ProgrammableFilter has a PythonPath property that you can set, too, that I had never noticed before Greg mentioned this.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Using pvpython I can get the data I need, and using f2py I can wrap my fortran subroutine but I can only get f2py to create a .so file which pvpython doesn't seem to recognize when I try to import it as a module.

Good catch. We have a fix for it. Dave should have it committed soon.

p.s. you guys have been really great (and patient) at helping us
identify and iron out these build/install issues. Thanks!

I am not sure why there's a problem. In your case, your filters have 2
input ports. e.g. in the stream tracer case,  referring to the mockup,
INPUT1 will be called "Input" while INPUT2 will be called
"ArbitrarySource" or "Source" as the case may be. Both of which
allowing the user to only add  1 item in the input box next to them.

Hi Eric, try now. I have moved that file into ParaView\CMake (as it is only
used by ParaViewMacros.cmake) and just added the missing install rule for
it. Let me know if it still gives the error.

Then I was right : I was not clear enough!

First, I talked about the current panel, not your mockup. I agree with
those who enthousiastic.
Second, the problem I noted on the multiple-input-port panel is that
the input are not ordered by index, but by name. Changing "Source"
to "ArbirtraySource" in the filters.xml for streamer with custom source
will change the order the inputs appear. Well, I know, if the name are
well-chosen, it is not a problem.

Now, let's take this pipeline:

builtin
   |
   |---Wavelet
   |        |
   |    Gradient
   |
   | --- PointSource

If you want to initialize a stream tracer in the Gradient at each point
of PointSource, you have to select Gradient, then choose filter ->
Stream tracer with custom source. The inputs panel is shown, with
the Input field being already set to the selected 'Gradient'. What you
have to do is to set the Source to PointSource from the pipeline. Well...
Attached is a screenshot of this procedure, but Source is named
ArbitrarySource. The Gradient is set as ArbitrarySource, and Input field
is not set.

I hope I am clearer now!

Hey Christian,

Something like this should work:

# =============
pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

numPts = pdi.GetPoints().GetNumberOfPoints()
Uarray = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray('U')
Varray = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray('V')

tc = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
tc.SetNumberOfComponents(2)
tc.SetNumberOfTuples(numPts)
tc.SetName('TCoords')

for ii in range(numPts):
  Uval = Uarray.GetTuple1(ii)
  Vval = Varray.GetTuple1(ii)
  tc.SetTuple2(ii,Uval,Vval)

pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(tc)
pdo.GetPointData().SetActiveTCoords('TCoords')
# =============

-Eric

Hey Christian,

Something like this should work:

# =============
pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

numPts = pdi.GetPoints().GetNumberOfPoints()
Uarray = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray('U')
Varray = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray('V')

tc = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
tc.SetNumberOfComponents(2)
tc.SetNumberOfTuples(numPts)
tc.SetName('TCoords')

for ii in range(numPts):
  Uval = Uarray.GetTuple1(ii)
  Vval = Varray.GetTuple1(ii)
  tc.SetTuple2(ii,Uval,Vval)

pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(tc)
pdo.GetPointData().SetActiveTCoords('TCoords')
# =============

-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Second try re:Question about volume viz algorithm(s)
Message-ID: <5dac92e41003161208g45d68228j9d2f2fd1038f5213@mail.gmail.com>

Not having heard back, I am trying this submission again.  Please help.

I have two questions related to volume visualization in Paraview and VTK.

1. I would like to know more about the algorithm that is used in Paraview to
do volume viz.  I have used Paraview to viz a cartesian grid data set with
reaonable success.  I can not seem to locate in the documentation much at
all about just which algorithm is being used.  And how come there is a need
to stuff the data through tetrahedralize first?

2. I have recently taken a look at the vtk examples for volume viz.  They
are nice.  However, I decided to take a look at modifying SimpleRayCast.py
to viz my 31^3 data set i doubles but seem to find that the routine which
does the heavy lifting does not take doubles.  What do I need to do first to
make use of this example?

Thanks very much for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] FFMPEG swscale required?
Message-ID: <25DBDEE7-C2F0-47CE-AA83-A0E6B5ACC9DF@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I had to rebuild ParaView on my 64-bit Ubuntu (9.10) system yesterday. Today when I remembered I needed to turn on FFMPEG, I switched VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER: ON and ran into a cmake error during config:

CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
 Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
 FFMPEG_swscale_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
     linked by target "vtkIO" in directory /home/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ParaView3/VTK/IO

I'm using the old FFMPEG sources from the VTK site that I compiled a couple months ago, and it was working back then. CMake was able to find the libraries I have okay:

FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR               /usr/local/include/ffmpeg                                                                            
FFMPEG_avcodec_LIBRARY           /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.so                                                                          
FFMPEG_avformat_LIBRARY          /usr/local/lib/libavformat.so                                                                         
FFMPEG_avutil_LIBRARY            /usr/local/lib/libavutil.so            

Is it just not auto-detecting that I'm using the old FFMPEG? Has there been a change recently that might cause this, or do you think I might have something configured wrong? 

The only other difference in this build was I started using Qt 4.6.2 I compiled from source rather than the package I can apt-get with Ubuntu. (CVS ParaView from today, CMake 2.6-patch 4)

Thanks,
-Eric

Eric,

I have a couple of questions about building paraview with x86_64 architecture on OS-X:

1.  You recommend building Qt 4.6.2 from source, but there is a binary version build with x86_64 and Cocoa available from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/mac-os-cpp (the file is qt-mac-cocoa-opensource-4.6.2.dmg) .  Is there any reason not to use this binary version of Qt instead of building Qt from source?

2. When configuring paraview 3.6.2, if I try to set VTK_USE_CARBON to OFF and VTK_USE_COCOA to ON, CMake just flips them back again when I hit Configure.  Is there any way to force this so that it can be built with Cocoa?

Thanks,
Eric

3.6.2 will not work with Cocoa. You will have to use CVS ParaView.

You will probably have to use ParaView from CVS "Head" in order to fix  
the "Carbon/Cocoa" thing. There is a quick patch you can do to a stock  
ParaView 3.6.2 to fix the problem if you want. <http://www.bluequartz.net/cgi-bin/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=ParaView3.git;a=blob;f=CMakeLists.txt;h=34aee621d3888e3e5afea9fc2063963ab4dc0e53;hb=HEAD 
 > will have the necessary code.

The download from nokia should be just fine.

In general, 64 bit support is pretty good in 10.5.x.  But it's much
better in 10.6.  And the upgrade is very cheap, unless you're on
PowerPC, in which case the upgrade is impossible. :(

If 64 bit is important to you, don't use 10.5.

Subject: [Paraview] Hidden Properties for Plugins
Message-ID: <4BA09993.4070407@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I'd like to know if it is possible to set properties to some value 
without letting the user change that. This would be nice, since e.g. the 
vtkImageGaussianSmooth requires a call "SetDimensionality" to setup 
whether to use a 1D, 2D or 3D Gaussian Smooth. Depending on that the 
user has to provide one, two, or three values for the 
StandardDeviations. So I chose to make a 2D version and a seperate 3D 
Version where I provide 2, repectively 3 input fields for these values. 
The SetDimensionality should then be called properly without the user 
having to take care about that.

Best regards,
Christian

I think you could set the "show" hint in the server manager XML. for eg

<SourceProxy ... >
...
<IntVectorProperty
    name="Dimensionailty"
    command="SetDimensionality"
    number_of_elements="1"
    default_values="2">
</IntVectorProperty>
...
<Hints>
  <Property name="Dimensionality" show="0"/>
</Hints>

</SourceProxy>

Thanks, Dave. I really appreciate all of the work on the install and packaging stuff, and how quickly you've been making the changes we need.

Talk to you later,

Agreed - it's nice to see that we are now able to build a paraview that
can relocated and still be usable for building plugins without needing
to sed edit a pile of *cmake any more.
And to boot, it'll presumably make the cut for the 3.8 release!

Folks,

I've committed some changes. A slight change from the mockup is the
placement of the radio buttons, since the buttons on the top seemed
disconnected from the pipeline view when more than 1 input ports were
present. Also, if there's only 1 input port, the radio buttons are now
hidden.


Jeremy,

I think I understood what you meant, and I've tried to address that
issue as well. Feel free to give that a try.

It does work, but needs a bit of fixing up before you can use it. The problem is that the people at Nokia constantly forget to include the full QtDBus.framework in their installer (they just create the directory and some manifest file). This is not a real problem, since ParaView doesn't use it directly nor any component which requires it, but FindQt4 adds it to the list of libraries if it finds it, causing linking to fail.

See here for the details: http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-6429

If I remember correctly, I just removed the bogus /Library/Frameworks/QtDBus.framework directory (make sure it REALLY is bogus).

I just verified that's already the case: VTK_USE_CARBON/VTK_USE_COCOA
flags are automatically updated based on whether Qt was built with
Cocoa or Carbon.

Subject: [Paraview] FFMPEG swscale required?

Hey again,

At least as things naturally happen on my Ubuntu machine, there is definitely something wrong with the test for whether FFMPEG has "old headers" (setting VTK_FFMPEG_HAS_OLD_HEADER):

Building the old ffmpeg downloaded from the VTK site, according to Dave DeMarle's README instructions, (after make install) results in {prefix}/include/ffmpeg/avformat.h (among other files, of course).

If you configure ParaView with ccmake and turn VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER to ON, it runs FindFFMPEG.cmake, which will assign FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR to {prefix}/include/ffmpeg, because that's where it's finding avformat.h. Then, it runs the vtkTestFFMPEG.cmake and looks for the existence of a subdirectory within FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR called ffmpeg to see if you have "old headers". It doesn't find this, so it thinks you have new headers and tests whether all the needed "modern" libraries are present, and doesn't find them (giving the error I mentioned below). Now, if you try to change FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR manually (within a ccmake session) back to {prefix}/include so it can detect the existence of the ffmpeg subdirectory within, it now turns VTK_FFMPEG_HAS_OLD_HEADER back to TRUE, which is good, but still won't let me finish configuring (probably because of some other cached values that I haven't traced).

I was able to get it to build by creating a dummy ffmpeg directory within my {prefix}/include/ffmpeg directory to trick it into knowing that I have old headers right from the beginning. You may also be able to get it to work by manually feeding cmake the right FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR value right from the command line a the start of your config, but I didn't try that.

Anyway, I don't know if this is just on my system, but I thought I'd pass it along just in case it helps.

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] cannot load *.pvs state files from v2.6 in current
	version of paraview
Message-ID: <8F825B08-76DB-4A6E-98AD-94F95ECB75A9@umich.edu>

Dear paraview list:

I am new to using paraview, and I would appreciate your help with the  
following question. In our group, we have some old state files (*.pvs  
extension) that were created with paraview version 2.6 (according to  
the header of the file). I cannot load these .pvs state files in the  
current version of paraview (3.6.2). If I try to load the *pvs files,  
I get this error: "ERROR: In /Users/partyd/Kitware/ParaView-3.6/ 
ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLParser.cxx, line 484 vtkPVXMLParser  
(0x23506f10): Error parsing XML in stream at line 1, column 1, byte  
index 1: not well-formed (invalid token)
Root does not exist. Either state file could not be opened or it does  
not contain valid xml"
If I try to open the *pvs files, I get this error: "A reader for [file  
name] could not be found".

Is there a way to load old state files ( *.pvs made in version 2.6) in  
the current version?

I have searched the mailing list archives and did not find an answer.  
If the documentation for this is already available, please point me in  
the correct direction.

Thanks so much,

Amy,

ParaView has under went fundamental changes since 2.6 and hence we do
not support importing 2.6 or earlier state files since 3.0.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview won't read plot3D files
Message-ID: <91BABC7D-1B4A-4918-91E7-180617D5E1F0@mchsi.com>

Paraview appears to have a limited ability certain plot3D files that  
were likely generated from C/C++ code, but is unable to read plot3D  
files generated from Fortran code.  When I open a Fortran generated  
plot3D file I select "plot3D" as the file type and then select the  
following three options: "binary file", "has byte count" and if needed  
"multigrid".  I have tried various combinations of these options  
without success.  I wrote a short and simple Fortran program to  
generate a small test plot3D grid file and data file, which I can  
successfully read with tecplot, but is not readable in paraview  
3.6.1.  Has anyone had success reading Fortran generated plot3D files  
with a recent version of paraview and if so, what plot3D format was  
used and what paraview file options were selected?

This is for paraview 3.6.1 on a mac running leopard.  However, I run  
into the same problem on the windows version of paraview as well.

Here is the error message I receive:

ERROR: In /Users/kitware/ParaViewReleases/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/

Yes, I have also generated an ASCII plot3D file, which I can get  
paraview to read.  However, paraview does not correctly interpret the  
grid file.  The geometry I create with my simple Fortran code is a  
cube.  Paraview successfully reads both the ASCII grid and data files,  
but when I view it in paraview the geometry is incorrect.  Tecplot  
does not have this problem with the same grid and data files.  I am  
interested in any suggestions on the right combination of options to  
choose when reading this plot3D file into paraview, but I have not  
been able to find the correct combination of options to read a plot3D  
binary grid and data file.  In addition, since paraview does not  
display the correct geometry when I have it read an ASCII version of  
the same grid and data plot3D files I believe there is more to this  
than just choosing the right options.

There are a number of different plot3D formats and I have tried  
reading a number of these into paraview, all with the same results.

Sincerely,
Rick

Message-ID: <636847371003180101h331cef7boa59df894a46c44b6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all .

Now we are doing an in-situ viz project. According to the Vis09 tutorials,
we believe Python to be the bridge between simulation side and viz side.
ParaView has a python client,that is pvpython, and it interact with ParaView
very well.But I do not know how the interaction is accomplished. Could
someone give me some help?

PS: Boost.Python seems to be capable of enabling Python to invoke C++
methods.Does ParaView use Boost.Python ?

Thanks a lot.

It does not. For completeness you should also investigate swig which is the
standard for doing that.

But ParaView uses neither of those. Instead it has its own (older) wrapping
technology, which is the same technology at work in Tcl, Java and Python
wrapped VTK, and also behind the wrapping into ParaView's own client server
language. The idea is the same behind all of them, cmake scripts that drive
a lex/yacc based executable that parses VTK C++ header files to create code
that can instantiate VTK classes and then call public methods on those
instances. See http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Python_Wrapping_FAQ for more
information. But you will have to read the code to learn the details.

Once wrapped, python scripts can call into ParaView's C++ servermanager API
just like the standard C++ client does once they have loaded the wrapped
ParaView libraries.


Thanks a lot.

I'm working on doing in situ viz with paraview and have committed some beta
code into the paraview repository.  The code is in ParaView3/CoProcessing if
you want to look at it.  You can turn it on by setting the
paraview_enable_coprocessing cmake variable to on.  It uses python to set up
the pipelines for you in the coprocessing libraries.  You can also build
paraview with PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_CoProcessingScriptGenerator which will
create a plugin to create the python scripts for coprocessing.  We have this
working and are in the processing of getting performance numbers on some
supercomputers with a parallel cfd code but everything is still a bit
sparsely documented.  If you're interested I can give you more details.

I am sorry. I test it in a Linux machine. But the machine has some problems
now. I will post the error if the machine is fixed.But I am sure it is not a
syntax error.

Hi Andy,

That is great! I will try the CoProcessing soon. We have a cluster(about 500
nodes) to do physical simulation. The generated data mainly consist of
volume data ,meshes and particles. We want to visualize the data and show
the result using a tiled display. People can interact with the viz process
through a master node. I really appreciate if you can give me more details.

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] pqViewManager in Clone2
Message-ID: <ef7bd411003180722q5e596a4dte5666e2bf3be0128@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am attempting to use the Clone2 CustomApplication example to write a
custom application in C++.  The wiki documentation on Custom Applications
suggest using pqViewManager to control the view of the application.

I want to split the frame into four different windows, each with its own
view.  I am assuming the program starts with one frame and one view.  Is
this assumption correct?

I reference the pqViewManager with the following code:
       this->Internals->MultiViewManager

the active view (I'm guessing the only view at this point is):
       pqView* view = this->Internals->MultiViewManager->getActiveView();

This problem is there are no public methods to split the frame in
pqViewManager.  It is possible to get the pqMultiViewFrame:
        pqMultiViewFrame * multiViewFrame =
this->Internals->MultiViewManager->getFrame(view);

I've tested this by:
        multiViewFrame->setTitle("HELLO WORLD!");

and it works, but I've tried multiple tries to get the frame to split
without success.  Any insight will help.
Thanks!

Hello,

If you are creating a custom application which always has 4 render
windows, then I'd suggest not even using the pqViewManager.
Simply create the 4 views yourself and pack them into a QWidget using
a QGridLayout. For example, the following code can be used after a
server connection has been made to set up the 4 views.

QWidget* centralWidget = new QWidget();
mainWindow->setCentralWidget(centralWidget);
QGridLayout* gl  = new QGridLayout(centralWidget);

for (int xx=0; xx < 2; xx++)
{
  for (int yy=0; yy < 2; yy++)
    {
    pqRenderView* view = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
      ob->createView(pqRenderView::renderViewType(), server));
    gl->addWidget(view->getWidget(), yy, xx);
    }
}

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin Installation Location
Message-ID: <E4254B17-7806-4F7F-99EC-6339B233D5F2@bluequartz.net>

I was running the "install" target from a Visual Studio instance and  
noticed that my custom client side plugins were NOT being loaded. When  
I looked at the install tree I noticed the following:

ParaView/bin/plugins/AngReaderClientPlugin/AngReaderClientPlugin.dll   
which obviously is not correct. I think I have tracked it down to the  
following bit of CMake code in ParaView/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake:

MACRO(internal_paraview_install_plugin name)
   IF (PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR)
     INSTALL(TARGETS ${name}
==>      DESTINATION "${PV_INSTALL_PLUGIN_DIR}/${name}"
       COMPONENT Runtime)
   ENDIF (PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR)
ENDMACRO(internal_paraview_install_plugin)

I think that should be DESTINATION "${PV_INSTALL_PLUGIN_DIR}/"  
instead. Is this a bug? Something similar to this error is also  
present in the ParaView 3.6.2 sources (where I originally found the  
issue).

Thanks for any info/feedback.

Hello, 


My Paraview & pvserver processes still crashes with the message:

Here's some more debugin output from mpirun and valgrind when running on 4 dualcore hosts, with 2 processes of pvserver on each.
The valgrind outputs of the pvserver processes in my opinion don't show any hints of errors in pvserver.
(I attached one processes's valgrind output below the mpirun output; the others all look similar to this one, no error hints)

Could it be the case that theres's something wrong with open mpi's directory settings,  as mpirun claims that

Any hint would be appreciated...
Thanks.

What is your data type? If it's a vtkImageData then you shouldn't need
to tetrahedralize. If it's vtkStructuredGrid then you'll need to
tetrahedralize since ParaView currently only supports volume rendering
for regular cartesian grids i.e image data and unstructured grids.

For image data, ParaView uses fixed-point-ray-cast mapper (software)
or a gpu-based raycaster. For details for the two algorithms used look
at
* http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper.html#_details

For unstructured grid, we have:

* ZSweep - http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper.html#_details
* Projected Tetrahedra  -
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper.html#_details

You may want to use something like vtkImageShiftScale
(http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkImageShiftScale.html) to
transform your data to the appropriate type.

Utkarsh,

Thanks very much for your reply.  I appreciate it.

My data is a 31x31x31 array of doubles in a 3d cartesian grid.  The vtk file
header plus a couple of numbers is:

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
brillset_a6_n64_dx0p15625_gxx.dat
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 31 31 31
ORIGIN 0 0 0
SPACING 0.412500 0.412500 0.412500
POINT_DATA 29791
 SCALARS gxx float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
1.00006867
1.00006955
...
...
...

so, it's structured. The min is .953... and the max is 1.030... so it covers
a pretty modest range.  I have viewed this data with Paraview and thought I
had to stuff it through tetrahedralize first...was wondering how come?
The volume viz of it shows most of the action is in the middle of the
volume. Have played around with diverging and other maps. Have run
isosurface on it with success.

I am just trying to understand what methods are being used in Paraview in
order to better learn how to do better viz.

Thanks very much for the pointers. Will take a look.

I guess not, as my data isn't an image.


Thanks again for taking the time to answer my questions.

Comer,

If your data is structured points, it is indeed a vtkImageData and
hence you should be able to volume render it directly as well as use
vtkImageShiftScale filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin works - doesnt - works - doesnt - ...
Message-ID: <4BA26F03.3030009@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I am experiencing strange behaviour in ParaView. Believe it or not, I 
have a plugin that works every second time I start Paraview. I am doing 
the exactly same thing with one specific image, all steps are absolutely 
identical, still it works exactly only every second time.
If I have, say, an even Paraview Session, the plugin works any time. I 
can use it as much as I like, change values, update it, remove it, use 
it again, ... it just works.

The other (odd) time I get:


Warning: In /opt/ParaView3.7/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 180

vtkTexturePainter (0x1b64340): Failed to locate selected scalars. Will 
use image scalars by default.


This holds for an older and the actual cvs version 3.7. When I compile 
the plugin for 3.6 it works ALWAYS.

I have difficulties in locating what the problem is. It seems that it is 
because I am using ITK filters in this plugin (derived from 
vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter) - all my VTK-only filters work without a 
problem. Maybe these scalars get somehow messed up during the conversion 
between ITK and VTK (every second time ...)

I know this most probably won't help you developers find any bug but I 
am asking because maybe this is somehow a known issue...? Something must 
have changed since Paraview 3.6 here... Since it works for many image 
types it is quite big, so I can't attach it to let you check this.


Best regards,
Christian

Ah..yes...well it's not a bug per say. We did that in past to make it
easier for people to locate plugins that are packaged with ParaView,
but we don't need that anymore since distributed plugins are
automatically listed by the plugin manager dialog. I think we should
remove the ${name}. Dave, any concerns with doing so?

If you start paraview with "-dr" command line option everytime, do you
still see the odd/even behavior?

Yeah, it should be fine to remove ${name}. In 3.6 it was done for
organizational purposes for the most part.

Like this I always get the error message.

This is what I wanted to say, the first time I start up ParaView (after 
rebooting) always failed.

Subject: [Paraview] Debug Qt Libraries NOT being installed on MSVC Builds
Message-ID: <811a1f291003181146r5d515117pa1ea163e84441084@mail.gmail.com>

This is with ParaView CVS HEAD and VS 2008 running on Windows 7. When
I build a "Debug" version then run the "INSTALL" project in the
Paraview.sln file I get the NON-Debug versions of the Qt libraries. I
have to go back and manually copy the libraries from the Qt
Installation location into the "bin" directory of the installation. Is
this intended behavior or a bug? I have a possible patch if needed
that would help clear this up.

Message-ID: <811a1f291003181148o650b1499q64d50eadd67a5c62@mail.gmail.com>

Can the "FindHDF5.cmake" file in the current ParaView CVS Head be
replaced with something a bit more "significant"? Like maybe the one
from current CMake? I have to use an external HDF5 library (Version
1.6.9) in order to get one of my plugins to work and the current
"FindHDF5.cmake" does not seem to find my installed version of HDF5
and still set all the needed CMake variables, namely HDF5_LIBRARY is
NOT getting set.

 I have a version of FindHDF5.cmake that could be used. There was also
a good discussion in the past few months on the CMake list about
replacing/adding the one with CMake. Thanks

Is there any possibility of updating HDF5 to a newer version? At least
maybe the 1.6.10 release? The 1.6.2 is pretty old at this point and
really should be updated.

Thanks

Best thing is, when I just close the "odd" ParaView sessions right after 
startup (no image loading, nothing, just close), the filter always 
works. The plugin is loaded on startup though. When I disable autoload 
and load the filter on demand, then it again never works. It seems to 
get lost in ITK though, I have checked that now. The vtkImageData input 
that arrives at SimpleExecute is okay, but after converting back to VTK 
its gone...

But then again, in ParaView 3.6 and VTK-only it works perfectly.

It's a bug, the install rule doesn't respect configuration type.

Ok. I'm trying to peruse through the ParaView CMake files but am not  
really coming up where those install rules are set? Care to give a  
hint. I may have a patch for you...

John Bidiscombe mentioned earlier today that he has a working version of 1.8
ready to commit. It's too close to the branch to check in now but he should
be able to push it in after the branch/git switch over.

So this sounds like the upgrade is going to miss the PV 3.8 cut off?

Hi All,

The ParaView team has finalized the 3.8 branch date to be next Friday, March
26th. Please be aware that we are going to lock CVS HEAD on Tuesday March
23rd for final Dashboard Greening. If you have any more additions/fixes for
3.8 please get them checked in as soon as possible. Patches will be accepted
for Dashboard fixes while the lock is in place.

Thank you all for your cooperation.

I have just confirmed that when using Paraview 3.6, even with the -dr 
option, everything works fine. Whether the plugin is located such that 
it is loaded automatically or I load it myself doesn't change anything. 
It works.

Also, I traced the image down to the point where it vanishes in Paraview 
3.7. It is definetely during the ITK filtering. The conversion to ITK 
works, but then it disappears. Maybe it isn't a Paraview issue after all...?

I'm going to try and put up a public wiki this weekend about the
coprocessing/in situ viz.  If I don't send out the link on Monday bug me
about it until I get it done :)

Hey Rick,

Can you post the header part of an ASCII Plot3D file that you have?
ParaView reads only one flavor of Plot3D so I want to make sure that
that is what you have.

Hi all,

I have committed a fix for this issue and verified that ParaView can
read VStress from brick_with_hole2-out.e . I've cleared the continuous
dashboard and will watch the nightlies. It should be in ParaView 3.8.

Berk, please let me know if/when the contract w/ EDF goes through and I
can have the reader tag array components with names.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview won't read plot3D files
In-Reply-To: <45d654b1003181447k67984cf5ufc0421b0e3255b15@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <3CC8C853-8FFC-4988-B017-081500867943@mchsi.com>

Here is the plot3D ASCII grid file header section:

      3
    121    40   121
    121    41   121
    121    42   121

The first row containing "3" indicates the number of blocks.
The second through 4th rows give the dimensions of each block.

Upon reviewing the multiple test files I have generated I found I was  
originally incorrect when I thought that paraview was interpreting the  
geometry of the ASCII plot3D grid file differently than tecplot.

If you look at the plot3D User Manual, I am following the  
specification for a 3D, whole, multigrid plot3D grid file and solution  
file (see pages 164 and 165) .  There are three blocks in this case.   
Up until this afternoon I have been generating double-precision files,  
but today I also tried generating a single-precision plot3D grid file  
and solution file and still could not read it in paraview.

Which plot3D file format is supported in paraview and does paraview  
only support single-precision?  Also, which options must I select when  
reading in the plot3D file?

How can I go about requesting a more robust plot3D capability in a  
future version of paraview?  I would really like to see the ability to  
read in plot3D function files (3D, multigrid, generated froma bunch of  
x-y planes: see pages 166 & 167 of the plot3D User Manual), which is  
what my Fortran-based CFD post-processor writes out.

I can provide the Fortran source that generates my test plot3D binary  
grid and solution files, plus the actual plot3D grid and solution  
files themselves.

Sincerely,
Rick

Now I miss an edit box or alike that shows your selection for every 
input! I think this is important, at least I scrolled around to see what 
the edit boxes say with the actual form in the first place! :)

Message-ID: <55c3450a1003190058i37e0083ckd71698f42f5bb6e2@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,


I am trying to create a reader plugin which could launch multiple .pvd files
at once.
Let say that I have an input file with a list of 2 pvd files.
I want my plugin to read through this list and launch a PVDReader for the 2
files.

I am not sure this could be made.
How should I call the PVDReader command in my vtk classes?

Any help will be appreciated.

Cheers

Tristan

Thanks Utkarsh

I like it ! However - let me know if I am boring ;) -, for multiple inputs
on
one port (such as AppendGeometry), it would be nice if the current inputs
are already selected when choosing "Change Input" in the pipeline
browser. Lazy men (yes, I am) don't want to reselect them...

Anyway, that's good !

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting: Updating PVDReader source when pvd
 file has changed and rendering latest time step
Message-ID: <4BA370BF.4040408@kth.se>

Hi,

I'm trying to get ParaView to work in an interactive context for
numerical simulations. The first goal is to have ParaView visualize time
steps as they are output by the solver (vtu for individual steps, pvd as
collection). I searched the wiki, mailing lists etc. and it seems this
cannot be done easily.

My current approach uses the python scripting interface. I open a socket
in python and wait for messages from the solver that a time step was
finished and a new file written out. When this happens for the first
time I initialize the visualization, i.e. load the pvd file and set some
basic properties. For every subsequent event I set ViewTime to the
latest sample and re-render the view. Is there a more elegant way to do
that?

This works as long as the pvd file contains all the expected time steps
from the beginning. But the solver updates the pvd file for every vtu
file written out and appends it to the collection. Hence, when I
initially load the pvd, I only have the first time step. I tried all
methods PVDReader provides but there seems to be no way to re-read the
file of a PVDReader source. Did I miss something?

I wonder if it might be a better option to try to realize this as a
plugin, since in the end is should also be possible to send messages
back to the solver to trigger a parameter change for the next time step
while the simulation is running. As I'm not so familiar with the VTK /
ParaView source and have no experience writing ParaView plugins I'd be
happy to get some input or estimate if that is achievable in a
reasonable amount of time.

Best regards,
Florian

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.6.x connection definition files
In-Reply-To: <7ba9d6a31001120637r6e523102g756c577e65d1fd87@mail.gmail.com>
References: <7ba9d6a31001120637r6e523102g756c577e65d1fd87@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <4BA39B39.8000607@us.army.mil>

I've run into a situation where things are not yet being handled 
correctly with this issue.     I'm currently testing with 3.7.x assuming 
that's the where the work is going on for the next release.   The 
original issue can be found here:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9866#c18827


As stated in the issue resolution, the saved values are now being stored 
in the users .ini file, but they are not unique for each server.     
That is,  it appears to be creating "global variables" rather than 
saving off variables per server.     So, I have something that looks 
like this in my .ini file:

[SERVER_STARUP]
SSHLOC=/usr/local/bin/ssh
LOGINNODE=login-node1
USERNAME=user
PROJECTNUM=ABC123Project
PV_CONNECT_ID=13829
NODES=2
QUEUE=debug
SERVER_PORT=55876
WALLTIME=60
VERSION=3.7.0

If I now load up a different server which happens to use the same 
variable names, these automatically get dumped into the connection 
definition file, which is OK assuming that you have the same USERNAME, 
PROJECTNUM, etc across all systems, which is not the case.    So, I have 
multiple connection definition files pointing to multiple machines with 
different usernames and ProjectIDs, and by default I'm getting the 
values from the previous session rather than the values from the 
previous session for that particular server.   I'm wondering if the best 
way to save these variables is something more like this:

hostname1.USERNAME=jimuser
hostname1.PROJECTNUM=ABC123Project
hostname2.USERNAME=joeuser
hostname2.PROJECTNUM=XYZ789Project

Where "hostname" is the Server name from the .pvsc file.

  I have a polygonal mesh that I am rendering. I would like to adjust  
the specular intensity and focus of the rendered mesh BUT that section  
of the "Display" tab is disabled. If I create a simple Sphere source  
then the section is enabled. I tried generating point normals for my  
mesh but that did not seem to help. I am sure it is something simple.  
This is with OS X 10.5.8/ Qt 4.6.2 Cocoa/ intel/ with PV CVS Head.

Hey Mike,

For me, though, even the Sphere Source doesn't have those options if I'm coloring by a scalar or vector -- only if I've chosen "Solid Color". I don't know if this is how it's supposed to be or not.

And you call it like this: From ${ParaView_SOURCE}/Applications/ 
ParaView/CMakeLists.txt

SET (qtliblist QtCore QtGui QtNetwork QtXml QtSql QtHelp QtWebKit  
QtCLucene Phonon QtXmlPatterns)

That seems to work fine for both Debug and Release modes. This was  
tested on Windows 7 x64 running Visual Studio 2008 RTM and CMake 2.6.4

   Hope it helps. I git cloned to "git clone git:// 
echo1.bluequartz.net/ParaView.git" and have my changes there.

The specular options are disabled when coloring with an array by
design to avoid any interference with the scalar colors which can
result in misinterpretation of the data.

Um.. So how do I get the adjustments back? Do I need a certain type of  
Array data or to remove a certain type of array data?

Just choose to color by "Solid Color" and those options should be enabled.

How ironic. I wrote a filter to create really pretty colors and now I  
have to throw those away in order to get a nice "shiny" surface. I  
will just assume that this is area that needs some more work?

Folks,

ParaView introduced Comparative Views for parameter studies a while
ago. They have undergone some usability cleanups for the upcoming 3.8
release. Feel free to give them a try.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview:  python script from the command line
Message-ID: <4BA3D3A2.7030407@us.army.mil>

Is there a way to startup paraview and have it run a python script from 
the command line?   I know that I can load a state with the "--state" 
flag.    And, I can run a python script from within ParaView by going to 
the python tool and running the script.     As far as I can tell, I'm 
limited to running the python script after ParaView GUI starts up.    It 
would be nice to be able to load that same script from the command line.

That's a reasonable request. We don't have such an option currently.
Let me see if I can add it before 3.8.

Do I still get the GUI if I us pvpython or vtkpython?  I'm looking to 
jumpstart the Paraview GUI using a python script.

You're probably looking for pypython but vtkpython may also work.

Hi,

I dig out this old thread when searching how to Update the pipeline from
code. In my
case, I don't want an auto-apply behaviour. But as soon as a special
interaction occurs,
I want the whole pipeline to update.
I tried different things I though suitable, but it was not:
- renderAllViews( true ) from a newly object-builder-created
pqPipelineSource
- UpdatePipeline from the same proxy
- Render from the underlying vtkRenderWindowInteractor

I didn't find in the code what the click-apply-button signal actually does.
What I want is to embed in a single clck on a image the following
interaction steps:
1) add a PointSource to the server
2) set the position in the image
3) click the Apply button

The first 2 steps are OK. Still remain the 3rd, which I have to do by hand.
Reminder: I am *very* lazy!

Thanks for your suggestions
Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] Windows intall issue
Message-ID: <BAY109-W51D25527A0451BCEFDD899B2290@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I try to install PV on Windows, I am a Mac user.
So I install everything necessary for compiling PV from source, since I would like to be able to compile some plugins too: Cygwin, MinGV, CMake, Qt and of course PV.
I managed to run CMake, following the instructions on the PV pages. Now I have some Makefiles but only the Visual Studio procedure is described on the doc pages and I use g++ through Cygwin.
So I go in the ParaView_BUILD dir and run make, but nothing happen, make seems to find that nothing has to be done.
So I checked the Makefile, which seems to be ok.
Any idea?

Thanks, That worked well.  I am currently trying to load a .vtk file with
the following:

    QStringList fileList;
    QString reprType;
    reprType = "VOLUME";

    fileList.push_back("../
ParaViewData/Data/blow.vtk");
    pqPipelineSource *readerSource = pqLoadDataReaction::loadData(fileList);

    pqDataRepresentation * repr =
objBuilder->createDataRepresentation(readerSource->getOutputPort(0),
reprType);

I get a popup window with a window label "Open Data With ..." and message "A
reader for '../ParaViewData/Data/blow.vtk' could not be found.  Please
choose one:"

There are no reader options available.

The program will need to load multiple file types so I want to use a module
that can load any valid file type.  Are the reader options loaded
automatically from ParaViewReader.xml?  Is pqLoadDataReaction the correct
class for loading files?
Thanks!

OK, let's go further on my investigations : I found that
pqObjectInspectorWidget
is responsible of emitting the 'accept' signal and implements also the
'onaccept'
slot. The latter seems to do what I want! But I didn't find, for now, how to
get
an instance of the pqObjectInspectorWidget.

Work and see...

Subject: [Paraview] Distorted Images in Paraview
Message-ID: <4BA672A5.7020602@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I am again having bad results in ParaView with my custom VTK filters 
(you might notice that this is not the first time). I just don't know 
what the problem is. Again, the filter works perfectly in VTK-only, but 
in ParaView my result image has some serious errors (always, no 
switching behaviour this time...).
I have attached three images. The first one shows the original, the 
second shows the result in vtk-only (removal of small objects), the 
third shows the exact same filter compiled as a ParaView plugin.

I have already spent a lot of time looking at examples and reading 
matching chapters in the VTK Users Guide, I just do not see what I am 
doing wrong. In my code, I use recursion to traverse through connected 
components and pass on scalar pointers, is that a problem?? At least 
some more basic filter doesn't produce errors. Or maybe I mistype 
something? Am I breaking important rules? Is my coding style 
intrinsically error prone?

I'd really appreciate if somebody could look into this. I also attached 
the very well documented code.


Best regards,
Christian

Finally, I got it. I had to use UpdateSelfAndAllInputs( ) from the
vtkSMProxy,
then set a representation of that proxy to visible (create one if
necessary),
then call render() on the application core instance and finally set the
modified
state of the underlying pqPipelineSource to UNMODIFIED (that switch off the
Apply button).

Well, sorry for that soliloquy. 'Hope it will help someone other than me!

Thank you very much Jonathan, you saved my day! It indeed was because of 
uninitialized data, I just write to the output at positions that had 
foreground pixels. Very irritating though, that with VTK-only the data 
seems to always be initialized with 0.

Best regards,
Christian

Jonathan provided the right answer to this problem here. It turned out 
that the output contained random artifacts in those places that weren't 
explicitely painted (the background). In VTK-only the output image 
somehow always initialized with 0, either on purpose or by pure 
coincidence, or because the filter is always reloaded in my bash 
sessions such that memory is freed. I don't know, but you obviously have 
to care about that yourself.

Best regards,
Christian

Message-ID: <b0a936c01003220549w7ea41383x866bab3178907826@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have 8-core machine with CentOS 5. I am trying to install CVS
version fo ParaView with following cmake variables

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                 ON
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI                  ON
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON    ON

During make I get the following error:

/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libpython2.6.a(abstract.o): relocation
R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a
shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/local/lib/libpython2.6.a: could not read symbols: Bad value


I have python-2.6.4 ad qt-4.6.2.

Any help/suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

Thanks,
Hom Nath

Hello,
you have to rebuild your python with the -fPIC option.
Before making ./configure you have to set CPPFLAGS to "-fPIC".
For example,
export CPPFLAGS="-fPIC"
./configure ...
make
make install

Didier

That's because you haven't registered any readers with the "reader factory".

Look at:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_Custom_Applications#ParaViewReaders:_Reader_Factory_Configuration

You need to specify an XML with the names of the readers that your
applications wants to expose in the build_paraview_client() function
call.

You can directly instantiate two instances for vtkPVDReader in your
filter class and use those to read the two files.

Any reason why you are not simply using Visual Studio tools for

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting: Updating PVDReader source when pvd
	file has changed and rendering latest time step

The vtkPVDReader (you may want to look at it's superclasses as well)
does not re-read the XML file, unless the reader is modified. What you
really need, is somehow call "Modified()" on the reader. One way would
be setting the filename to empty (then call
vtkSMPRoxy::UpdateVTKObjects()) and then setting it back  (and again
calling vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects()".

Subject: [Paraview] Build Error on CVSHEAD on OS X
Message-ID: <09C8A070-B4E2-444D-B8A1-4C65FDEE4858@bluequartz.net>

When building ParaView CVSHEAD I get the following error:

[ 24%] Generating vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h
dyld: Library not loaded: libvtksys.pv3.7.dylib
   Referenced from: /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView/Build/VTK/ 
Parallel/../../bin/vtkHashSource
   Reason: image not found
/bin/sh: line 1: 36264 Trace/BPT trap          ../../bin/ 
vtkHashSource /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView/VTK/Parallel/ 
vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx vtkSocketCommunicatorHash  
vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h
make[2]: *** [VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h] Error 133
make[1]: *** [VTK/Parallel/CMakeFiles/vtkParallel.dir/all] Error 2

 From the error I deduced that the build system is trying to run an  
executable that was dynamically linked against the vtksys.dylib  
library. With the default build configuration on OS X this is a  
problem because the "install_name" on the libraries do NOT have a  
path, just the name of the library. This can be solved by running the  
following from my particular build directory:

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/bin

Is this a known bug or something that needs to be done during the  
builds as a matter of building paraview?

Thanks

Try this:

- Binary File
- Multi Grid
- Has Byte Count (all files written from Fortran do)
- Little Endian

At one point, we'll have Plot3D reader detect these settings
automatically but it hasn't been a priority.

Hey Mike,

Just out of curiosity, were you building with VTK_USE_RPATH: OFF? I run into something like this when trying to build on OS X without using rpath.

With the default build configuration on OS X this is a problem because the "install_name" on the libraries do NOT have a path, just the name of the library.

Yes. the default was with the rpath=OFF. I tried turning it ON but  
this caused some other problems. Maybe I'll start with a fresh build  
directory.

Just a suggestion but maybe that variable should be named:

PARAVIEW_GENERATE_FILTERS_DOCUMENTATION

so that CMake properly groups it with the other ParaView variables?

I think there may be an issue with the installation rule, at least on  
OS X. I do a "make install" and the documentation does not seem to get  
copied/registered/whatever. I tried turning on the  
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT to see if that helped but didn't seem to.  
Suggestions?

Walking through the source code it seems that the entire  
"paraview.qch" file is pushed into a ".cxx" file which is then  
directly compiled into ParaView. Ok. When I click on the "?" button  
for the Sphere source I get the following in a pop up window:

QTextBrowser: No document for qthelp://paraview.org/paraview/ 
SphereSource.html

Any help with this would be great. If there is a bug I'll post the  
patch...

Message-ID: <c9010c7d1003220941n3a6d97d8j536770e76ed3d776@mail.gmail.com>

I added a wiki page for the coprocessing work that is getting integrated
into paraview.  It is at http://paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing

The wiki still needs a bit more work but hopefully it will get people going
in the proper direction and answer most of the basic questions.  Note that
the paraview "nightly" documentation hasn't been updated since 1/5/2010 so
it doesn't include information on coprocessing yet but we are working on
fixing the problem.

I'm using Clone2 as a base for the application and it has:

  ...
  ...
  PVMAIN_WINDOW_INCLUDE myMainWindow.h
  GUI_CONFIGURATION_XMLS
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ParaViewSources.xml
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ParaViewFilters.xml
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ParaViewReaders.xml
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ParaViewWriters.xml
  SOURCES ${ParaView_SOURCE_FILES}
)

in the CMakeLists.txt file.  I want to use the open file routine used to
open any legal file type, but in code.
Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Data set comparison
Message-ID: <OF3B23F175.77D8B27E-ONC12576EE.0053E7A0-C12576EE.005E80B0@tororosso.com>

Hi all,
Im trying to compare two data sets in Ensight .case format. 

I found only this thread referring to data set comparison: 
http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-November/010034.html

But I could not get it to work. I tried resamply directly the two Ensight 
data reader. Then I also tried to filter the two Ensight data readers 
through a CellDatatoPointData reader and also through a CellCenter (with 
vertex cells active), but I always get:
ERROR: In 
/home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDataSet.cxx,

I also tried the programmable filter suggested in the previous email, 
(using two input file with the same geometry), but in that case I always 
get:

paraview version 3.6.2, Date: 2009-05-18 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 25, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 5, in RequestData
AttributeError: GetPointData


That's the filter Im trying to use:
i0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
i1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
o = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
o.GetPointData().AddArray(i0.GetPointData().GetArray("meanTotalPressureMonitor"))
o.GetPointData().AddArray(i1.GetPointData().GetArray("meanTotalPressureMonitor"))


Thank you very much for your help!

Sincerely,
Luca

When you do a "make install" it does include the paraview.qch file in [install]/doc/ but it looks like you're right that the filters and sources help is not being included in this even though the ParaViewFilters.html and ParaViewSources.html are being generated properly in the [build]/Documentation/ directory. (The [build]/Documentation/paraview.qch file doesn't include the Filters or Sources info, either.) 

I wonder if things are just being generated in the wrong order? (html after qch instead of the other way around)

Good idea. I've changed it to PARAVIEW_GENERATE_PROXY_DOCUMENTATION.

/cvsroot/ParaView3/ParaView3/Documentation/CMakeLists.txt,v  <--
Documentation/CMakeLists.txt
new revision: 1.29; previous revision: 1.28

I am trying to follow what is going on but still not real sure of the  
sequence. This is the latest error that I get when I try to load the  
help for the Sphere Source.

Could not locate index.html
QTextBrowser: No document for qthelp://paraview.org/paraview/ 
SphereSource.html

Interesting. I thing I added the dependency on the wrong target -- I
made the target that compiled the qhp file to depend on the generate
the the proxy documentation htmls, but the html files need to be
listed in the qhp file in the first place to get compiled in. Fixed
that by adding dependencies so that the qhp file is generated after
HTMLDocumentation target is built.

That should work. Are you trying to call loadData() in the constructor
of your mainWindow class by any chance? If so that's too early, since
ParaView initialization code hasn't yet had the opportunity to read
the xml configuration files to initialize supported reader types etc.
You may want to use a timer to call the code after sometime.

Just coz having the same environment on the Mac and on Win is more comfortable for me.
So I tried to use the command line ccmake instead, configuring PV in the same way as on Linux.
But this time I faced another issue, which turns out to have been already identified here:

http://www.itk.org/Bug/view.php?id=8516

without having been fixed by the cmake team!

I'm thinking that this change is *almost* correct, but maybe not quite?  
It looks like you appended the server resource string rather than the 
server name?    I'm not sure that the resource string works well in this 
instance????

Subject: [Paraview] python support to open ComparativeView ?
Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A19060C087B54@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

Hi all

How does one go about creating a ComparativeView multi-viewport in a python script?

I tried the trace thing, but it only gave me an incomplete description, and then it failed, when reloading, on the keywords

ComparativeRenderView2.Cues = []

I have found in simple.py the definitions for XYChartView, XYBarChartView and the regular RenderView, and I guessed I could do a

servermanager._create_view("ComparativeRenderView")
then register my proxy, etc, etc.

Could we ask the developers to add the correct definition of CreateComparativeRenderView in  simple.py?

TIA
Jean

I'm concerned that this is not a unique identifier.      For a variety 
of reasons, we have to do a lot of reverse connections, SSH tunnels, 
etc, and ALL of my connection definition files use a resource of 
"csrc%3A\127.0.0.1"

Your timing couldn't be more perfect :), I just realized this a while
ago and was working on it.

I've added CreateComparativeRenderView() etc. to simple.py and it gets
traced as well.  However it's going to be a bit of work to get
comparative views working well with tracing since they use some wacky
proxies.

I've added a feature request for that:
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10450

However here's a sample python script:

-------------------------------
view = CreateComparativeRenderView()
sp = Sphere()
Show()
view.GetRootView().ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()

parameter_cue = servermanager.animation.ComparativeAnimationCue()
parameter_cue.AnimatedProxy = sp
parameter_cue.AnimatedElement=0
parameter_cue.AnimatedPropertyName = "Radius"

# Look at vtkSMComparativeAnimationCueProxy for available methods.
parameter_cue.UpdateWholeRange(0.1, 0.5)

view.Cues = [parameter_cue]
view.StillRender()
-------------------------------

This is because the EnSight reader produces a multi-block dataset. Try
applying Merge Blocks filter first.

Message-ID: <7ba9d6a31003231359n7c9d3e6dm5ddf51fc929cafe1@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I've just committed changes to paraview.simple to use the same logic
that ParaView GUI uses to load a data file using an extension. This
will be included in ParaView 3.8.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Loading_Data_Files

Example:
-------------------------------------------
from paraview.simple import *
reader = OpenDataFile("../can.ex2")
Show()
Render()
-------------------------------------------

Greetings Everyone,

The VTK and ParaView's repositories are now locked for final fixes to get
the dashboard green. If there are any fixes/patches that need to be made
before we create the 3.8 branch (on Friday March 26) please email them to
the list.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Problem reading Ensight Gold file with large number of
	time steps
Message-ID: <b0a936c01003240052t43b49fc5gd2d7961fce0a22db@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to read a case file attached, where I have 200 time steps.
But I get the following error:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\Temp\ParaView3\Servers\Filters\vtkEnSightReader2.cxx,
line 1152
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader2 (08526E00): Error with vtkEnSightReader2:
'time values' not found!!!

When I delete all but first 10 values and modify the number of time
steps to 10, that works. It seems that there is the limitation in line
size in the reader. But we need to give all the time values in a same
line according to the format.

I would appreciate your suggestions.

Hom Nath

This is a bit off-topic, but got me thinking about command-line options
again.

Would there be a way to specify multiple '--data=...' on the
command-line?
For example,

    paraview --data=myMesh.foam --data=skin.obj --data=slice.stl

to load several files at once.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Reader Issue
Message-ID: <DC2549B0B1E64746BB05F9E461904FF2@win.ara>


Hi,

I have a reader that currently reads in a mesh. As an option it will read in
a data file associated with the mesh, if provided via file browsing. At the
moment the list of data arrays only appears after the filter is applied,
since it will only then read in the data file. So the user then has to
select the variables he/she wants and then reapplies the filter. I'd like to
avoid this and, instead, have it so if the user browses and selects a data
file that it will then populate the point array selection immediately i.e.
before the filter is applied. Is this possible?

Regards,

Adriano

I saw the code in vtkEnSightReader2.cxx, and noticed that I can use
the multiple lines for time values. That works fine.

Thanks.

Yeah, that's what I am using at the moment. However, when I select my mesh
file initially using File->Open, RequestInformation is called. At this point
in time, no data file has been selected. I then have a vtkSetStringMacro
that allows me to browse for a second input file (the data file). However,
for this to then be read in to obtain the variables contained within (hence
populate the point array table), I need to click apply again so that
RequestInformation is called. I was just wondering if there was a workaround
so I could avoid having to reapply the filter.

AFIAK that's the purpose of the RequestInformation() method.
You can use it populate arrays etc. The vtkOpenFOAMReader.cxx (for
example) does just that too.

Hi Adriano,

Rather than using the vtkSetStringMacro you could implement your own
method that is called when the data file is set.  As well as doing
what the macro does (i.e. set the member variable, call SetModified
etc), this function could request information from the server about
what arrays can be found on the file and update the object panel.

Regards,
Paul

Yes and no.

You should take a look at how to write custom panels
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CustomObjectPanels

This will let you add various Qt elements to the reader panel.
If you mark their corresponding properties with << is_internal="1" >> in
the SM xml, you can set/unset the values directly.
One of the elements could, for example, be used to populate/repopulate
some vtkDataArraySelection containers.

For these purposes, inheriting from pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel should be
sufficient.

There is only one side-effect that I haven't been able to work around:
Updating the vtkDataArraySelection in this manner *will* cause the
reader panel to notice that it has been changed (lighting up the Apply
button). Pressing the Reset button fixes that while still retaining the
changes that your custom Qt bits did.

It would still be nice to figure how to avoid this last bit.
Perhaps someone from the mailing list, or from KitWare, has a good
suggestion.

Hom:

    You are right.

    (1) There is a 80-char limit on the length of any line in the case file
(actually also on the length of any line that stores ASCII/descriptive
information in a binary file). Thus the 200 time values can not be placed on
a single line. Otherwise only the first several would be parsed while the
rest would be ignored.

    (2) As you noticed from the code, the time values can be placed on
multiple lines to address the aforementioned over-limit issue.

    (3) Even the first several time values are not necessarily placed on the
same line as that of the "TIME VALUES" token. In other words, the time
values may be placed beginning on a line following the token line --- the
non-inline case.

    Good luck.

Paul/Mark,

Thanks for the suggestions. I am going to take a look at both options and
get an idea of time to implement. I knew some work with Qt code was
possible, but I didn't realise it was possible to implement your own method
instead of using the vtkMacros. 

Again, thanks for the suggestions. I'll do a bit more investigating.

Regards,

Adriano

Hi Adriano,

Rather than using the vtkSetStringMacro you could implement your own method
that is called when the data file is set.  As well as doing what the macro
does (i.e. set the member variable, call SetModified etc), this function
could request information from the server about what arrays can be found on
the file and update the object panel.

Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <C7CF9F10.13B24%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Nestor,

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I have been out of the office for a while.

What Sam says is mostly correct.  In general, the Exodus reader assumes that numbered files are partitions in space and that all the files hold all the time steps for that partition.  However, we have run into exceptions, like the one you find yourself in, in which you also need to specify a time series of files.  The most common reasons are a restarted simulation writing to a new set of files or the topology of the mesh changing (which is your case).  The instructions for specifying temporal Exodus sequences are documented on this Wiki page, which I have just updated for new features that will be available in version 3.8.

Nestor,

This will not answer your How-To question, but may help you structuring your Exodus output.

Unless I am mistaken, the serial indexes on an Exodus file-set refer to spatial domains, that is, separate portions of an analysis from a parallel execution. In addition, part of the datum sets are index arrays that tell the Exodus reader how to piece (or knit) the individual domains back together.

Each Exodus file contains all of its time steps, that is, if each of your files contains one time step, then the Exodus reader considers the simulation to be a "static" analysis.

Someone intimately familiar with the PV Exodus reader may know how to structure your Exodus datum sets so that the reader skips over gracefully "piecing the domains together," and observes the time-step indexes and values to produce the animation which you are expecting.

Regards,

Sam Key

Hi, I'm having trouble visualizing a transient simulation with exodusII files. If I open each file one at the time everything works fine, but i cant run a simulation w all the files, with the corresponding time steps. Files are named out.ex2.010, out.ex2.011, out.ex2.012 and so on. I'm loading the files w the following configuration:
File prefix: PATH/out.ex2.0
File pattern: %s%i
First file index: 10
Last file index: 50

I think it's worth mentioning that each file has a different mesh of same physical dimensions (i.e. refined mesh). Also the time information in the object inspector reads:
Index   Value
0             0
...           ...
8             0
9           0.25 (just the last index have value!=0, that value correspond to the 1st time step of the first file out.ex2.010)

Why isn't working? I'll appreciate any suggestion. Thanks a lot,

Nestor Solalinde

Subject: [Paraview] reading multiple files
In-Reply-To: <7ba9d6a31003171353t60c55035q9f42dd1da84e6988@mail.gmail.com>

Paul,

If you are trying to get ParaView to use a "simple" reader that only knows how to read a single file to read in a sequence of files as a time series, you can leverage the file-series meta reader.  This Wiki page gives information on how to do that.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Restarted_Simulation_Readers#Customized_Restart_Reader

Note that the Wiki page talks of "restarts" which in your case you can think of a time step.  I originally wrote this document to address a time series caused by a simulation crashing and being restarted, but the same technique works fine for a simple time series of files.

10.5.8 with a binary Qt 4.5.2 install. I am using CMake 2.6-4. I had
this working earlier on a different machine, but on a cleanly
installed system I get the following error:

Scanning dependencies of target QVTK

During configuration, if I uncheck the VTK_USE_CARBON flag, it is
automatically turned back on. If I check the VTK_USE_COCOA flag, it is
automatically turned back off. It isn't clear why this happens; even
with "Debug Output" set on, there is no output explaining this in
CMake's bottom panel.

Has anybody else seen this, or better yet, overcome it?

Thanks,

Hi Ning,

The most common use case will be to call the adapter on every node/process.
The python script for the coprocessing will by default run on every process
as well (if I remember correctly this is the symmetric python mode).  I'm
not that familiar with the parallel rendering and compositing process in
paraview but I'm assuming that it will work properly.  You will have to
modify the python script yourself though in order to do that.  The current
script generator is set up to use the parallel XML writers in order to
output the desired results.  We have plans to stream the results from the
simulation to a paraview client but that is not a top priority at this time.

By the way, the nightly paraview documentation has been updated so that it
will now include the coprocessing classes.  For now just look for the
classes that begin with vtkCP.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Ensight GOLD file: time steps not loaded
Message-ID: <b0a936c01003250608p3c902161v7f063bdbb26c4e04@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am writing a parallel Ensight gold files, say 8 partitions. I am
visualizing them in 8 cores machine.

Each case file represents the 2 time steps as in the one example
attached file. SOS file But when I load the SOS file, I can see the
complete and correct image but the times steps are not loaded, and
therefore I cannot animate. Obviously, when I load only one case file
that is fine. Is there any mistakes in my SOS or case file?

mesh and data files are too big to attach unfortunately.

I would appreciate your help/suggestions.

Thanks,
Hom Nath

What's the file format? Most probably the reader is reading the whole
dataset on all processes and then removing parts of the dataset not
relevant for the processes.

Are you planning to fix the EnSight reader to be able to read in parallel,  in the next version ?
That will be helpfull for us.

Have a good day

By -no 32 do you mean you are starting a 32 process MPI job?

If so, and you can load the dataset on your personal computer in one
process, try -no 1. Extra processes add overhead. If the reader isn't
a parallel capable one, for example, you are temporarily loading
32*133 million points.

Yes

Ok I do know that, I am not a programming newbie! lol
But the loading time is about to 32 x the loading time on a single process, and this is not a normal behaviour.
the overhead you are talking about should just be due to the fact there is a need to establish proper connections between data subsets so as to be able to properly track a streamline integration for instance, but this should not lead to such an overhead in loading the data I think.

This is a .pvd file, might there be a problem?

Subject: [Paraview] vtu: how to represent variation in cell end values?
Message-ID: <SNT104-W15619533C2972A6146C00CF3240@phx.gbl>


Hello,



I am writing a vtu file to represent data for a simple dataset in 
Paraview and I have run into a problem.  What I would like to do is to 
be able to represent a variation in a field value over the length of a 
cell and look at this variation as a single layer in Paraview (not 
separately as the sets of end values for end 1 and end 2, 
respectively).  More simply, each cell is assigned a field value at each 
end point and I want to be able to visualize this variation in end 
values for each cell for all of the cells in my (small) model.



As the simplest example of my problem, let's say I have 3 points and 2 
cells between the points.  Cell 1 has point 1 at its left end and point 
2 at its right end and cell 2 has point 2 at its left end and point 3 at 
its left end (in my field this might represent a beam finite element). 
1---2---3

Cell 1: 1=>2 (finite element 1)

Cell 2: 2=>3 (finite element 2)



I've figured out how to represent the field data at the points 
(physically these would be displacements, rotations, etc.).  However, I 
need to figure out what syntax to use to represent the variation in a 
physical quantity over the length of the cell.  Let's say the y-force 
for element 1 has values of 100 at point 1 and -500 at point 2, and that 
y-force for element 2 has values of +500 at point 2 and -200 at point 3.



Locally this variation in y-force is:

Cell 1: 100=>-500

Cell 2: +500=>-200



Summing the effect of the y-force at each point:

Point 1: 100

Point 2: -500+500 = 0

Point 3: -200



I have tried the following syntax:

<CellData Scalars="scalars">

<DataArray type="Float32" Name="y-force-el" NumberOfComponents="2">

100 -500

500 -200

</DataArray> 


However, when I used the above syntax I found that in Paraview I can 
only view the x-points (100 and 500), the y-points (-500 and -200) or 
the vector magnitudes for each cell (509.9 and  538.5) at one time.



Does anyone know what syntax I need?



(Once I figure out the syntax, I'll be all set to modify the code I 
wrote to read in my data and output it to vtu format).



Thanks!

Since you have 32 processes all reading the same file off of the same
filesystem it is likely to be at least 32 x slower.

There are _many_ potential sources of overhead in parallel. In your
case I am guessing the bottlenecks are IO to the filesystem, then RAM
contention, then way down at the bottom of the list, inteprocess
communication and finally computational load.

If the pvd file references a single data file yes. You still have 32
processes hitting the same disk and RAM simultanously. If the pvd file
references 32 different "striped" files, the file IO will be lower
(each process hits a different file and takes up only 1/32 of the
whole dataset size) but still substantial.

Try fewer processes and let us know what happens. It would help to
know how many processors are on your machine and how much RAM.

A .pvd file point to what kind of files? There should be some sort of
.vtX or .pvtX file(s) that the .pvd file points to. Also, do you know
what kind of file system the data is on? Some sort shared disk (NFS,
Samba etc.) or is it a parallel file system (pvfs, lustre, gpfs etc.).

I haven't taken the problem so serious since (as you say) it can be
easily cancelled by pressing Reset, but if you do really care (I
recall you mentioned the problem some time ago as well), it looks like
it is because the client side essentially is not made to respect the
(un)modified state of the vtkDataArraySelection in the server side. As
you well know, vtkDataArraySelection remains unmodified when a new
array is added by AddArray(). If I try to fix the problem by somewhat
emulating the behavior in client side, it could be as attached
(pqSignalAdaptorSelectionTreeWidget.cxx.diff).

But I am unsure if it is a right fix and will not cause any unintended
side effects. Perhaps someone from the mailing list, or from KitWare,
has a good suggestion. :)

Anyway, I submitted a bug: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10462

Subject: [Paraview] TecPlot problem or question for alternative format
Message-ID: <4BAC7611.5090206@am.uni-erlangen.de>

Hi,

I got a code which exports data (LBM) in a very simple format:

---
TITLE=" LBM data"
VARIABLES = "X", "Y", "RHO", "U", "V", "VOR"
 ZONE T = "Z"
 I=  351, J=  122, K=1,  ZONETYPE=ORDERED
 DATAPACKING=POINT
 DT=(SINGLE SINGLE SINGLE SINGLE SINGLE SINGLE)
    1    1  0.000000000000000D+00  0.000000000000000D+00
0.000000000000000D+00  0.000000000000000D+00
    2    1  0.000000000000000D+00  0.000000000000000D+00
0.000000000000000D+00  0.000000000000000D+00
...
---
The format of point data is: x, y, several scalar data values

I was told this is TecPlot and the guy uses TecPlot for visualization.

I exchanged the format "D+" by "e+" and opened the file with the CVS
version from 03/25/2010.

The file is recognized by the TecPlot reader but the geometry of the
visualization is not correct.

I understand that TecPlot is quite complicated (I saw just the number
of pages in the data format docu).

I assume that it is more easy for me to convert the simple data to a
structure that PV 3.6.2 can read.
What is the most simple PV format for this?

Thanks,

Fabian

Message-ID: <898447c41003260640r40269a3ejfd24603111dd97d1@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I have programmed a plugin, and I want to get it to work with ParaView
3.6.2  32 and/or 64 release, distributed in the website www.paraview.org.

I compiled ParaView 3.6.2 with Qt 4.3.5 Opensource in release mode, then
pointed the plugin to this version with Cmake, compiled in release mode, and
it works fine: I manage to download the ParaView 3.6.2 in the website and
load my plugin on it. This was made in a Windows Vista Ultimate 32bits
machine.

Now I want to compile it for 64 bits version. I took the source from
ParaView 3.6.2 and Qt 4.3.5, compiled them in a Windows 7 Professional 64
machine, and compiled the plugin pointing to this version. The plugin
compiles and works fine with my self compiled version of ParaView. But, when
I download the 64 (or the 32) version of ParaView in the website, I can't
load the plugin ! It says something like: "This is not a valid Qt Plugin"
when I try to load it. But I'm sure I matched the version of ParaView and
Qt, 3.6.2 and 4.3.5.

Does anyone know what might be happening ?

Thanks in advance,
Rafael.

Hey Kevin, For those 5 can you run them by hand and see if you notice why
they are hanging/failing? On some of them it looks like pvserver might be

Thank you very much for offering to help.

Hi Rafael,

Did you set VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS to OFF? If not that might very well
explain your problem on 64 bit. See also

No, I actually didn't do anything different when compiling the 32 and 64
versions of ParaView. Just checked "BUILD SHARED LIBS", that's all.

There are some flags in CMAKE which I'm not certain what value should I set.
For instance there is a flag CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS which is set to /DWIN32.
Shouldn't be /DWIN64 or something ? Also, as I compiled with Visual Studio
2008, should I have compiled some sorte of "Qt 64bits" ? I noticed that in
Start Menu I have "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt" and "Visual Studio
2008 x64 win64 Command Prompt". Should I have compiled Qt with the second
one ? As I'm not sure which one I've used, I'm compiling Qt again...

Thanks,

Farian:

    It seems the Tecplot file does not provide the section of x and y
corrdinates (before the solution) at all, or you just skipped it at your
e-mail for simplification purposes?

Subject: [Paraview] Algorithm causing reader RequestData when running
Message-ID: <c9adba421003260742hbec8f39wc722f66c4ec14ffd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am writing an algorithm to operate on a vtkMultiBlockDataSet where I
would like to extract blocks depending on field data that is set.
Internally in my algorithm I am using the vtkExtractBlock filter and
when this is updated it causes the RequestData for my reader to be
executed again.  This doesn't happen when applying ExtractBlock in
ParaView.  Below I have included an example RequestData that causes
the data to be reloaded (note: this only happens when running in
parallel):

8<-----------------------------------------------------------------
int vtkTestMulti::RequestData(
        vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed(request),
        vtkInformationVector** inputVector,
        vtkInformationVector* outputVector)
{

    vtkInformation* inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet* input = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(
            inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

    vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet* output = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(
            outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

    VTK_CREATE(vtkExtractBlock, extractBlockFilter);
    extractBlockFilter->SetInput(input);
    extractBlockFilter->AddIndex(1);
    extractBlockFilter->Update();
    output->ShallowCopy(extractBlockFilter->GetOutput());

    return 1;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------->8

Can anyone see what I am doing wrong or provide any pointers for where to look?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

YES. You need to use the proper command prompt from the start menu  
when compiling Qt to make sure you get the correct type of build (32  
vs 64 bit).

AFTER you have then built Qt correctly, then launch CMake-GUI and  
configure ParaView to build using a clean build directory. MAKE SURE  
YOU select the "Visual Studio 9 2008 x64" as the generator.

pv.XdmfReadStructuredGrid.XdmfReadStructuredGridCollection.XdmfGridAttributes

I got an "Output Messages" window that says :

ERROR: In /home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkPNGReader.cxx, line 53
vtkPNGReader (0x4bdb950): Unknown file type! Not a PNG file!

This text appeared on the console but I could not reproduce it.

I tried to narrow the problem down so I ran each of the three parts
separately. The XdmfGridAttributes.xml part is failing.

No, I did not skip anything, this is the data I have. The X and Y
coordinates
are just data values as the following RHO, U, V, ...

So the TecPlot file is not valid?

Which simple file format for 3.6.2 do you suggest to convert the data to?

Thanks,

Fabian

If I'm not mistaken, when creating a VTK pipeline inside of a PV filter, 
you need to make a shallow copy of the input dataset in order to keep 
the PV pipeline isolated as your VTK pipeline executes.

Try making a shallow copy of "input" and passing that into 
"extractBlockFilter", and see if it helps.

The two data servers are spinning which reminded me of an openmpi bug so
I stuck "btl_sm_num_fifos = 15" in ~/.openmpi/mca-params.conf but that
didn't help. I got back traces for the render server and the two data
servers:

Emily,

It sounds like you need point data not cell data. Point data arrays
contain a value per point (those values are interpolated to obtain
values that are in the interior of the cell), cell data array contain
a value per cell (which is assumed to be constant across the cell).
VTK will interpolate point arrays linearly over a cell of type Line.

Is this ParaView cvs head or 3.8 branch? I don't think that you need a
patch anymore. ParaView now supports the latest version of ffmpeg.

I suggest legacy VTK (http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf). It
sounds like this is a structured grid. One thing: VTK formats (and VTK
itself) does not directly support 2D so you will have to add a Z
value. Setting all Zs to 0 should work fine.

Try removing 'K = 1' from the zone header to see it the Tecplot reader
works. As Berk suggested, you may converted the data to legacy VTK.

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting: Updating PVDReader source when pvd
 file has changed and rendering latest time step

Translating that to Python as I understand it would correspond to:
reader.FileName = ""
reader.FileName = original

That does the trick, thank you! I had tried that before and had hoped
there is a nicer way, since I get VTK errors about not being able to
open the file and read the file information on the terminal and the
output window.

The only way to define discontinuities like that is to split cells. So
you would have:

Cell1: point1 -> point2
Cell2: point3 -> point4

where point2 == point3. I know it is a waste of memory but it is the only way.

Utkarsh - this also works well under some circumstances, but leave it to 
the customers to figure out how to break it.   If we startup paraview:

paraview --server=Host --script=myscript.py

And "Host" is a reverse-connection, the python script executes locally 
without waiting for the remote server to start up.

Thanks for your reply, it did not work. I'll create a VTK file by
myself, it's
not that much.

XdmfGridAttributes.xml mentions only one file :

$PARAVIEW_DATA_ROOT/Data/RodPlate/RodPlate.xmf

When I load this file in paraview there are many data arrays but they
are all zeros except for "MaterialID" which is all ones.

	'Information Helper"
Message-ID: <6E3B25EE-A47D-4E5D-8E98-9BC813FED99A@bluequartz.net>

I have a custom reader. Part of the reader is getting a "NeighborList"  
which is an vtkIntArray object although I have declared the following  
methods in my "reader" class:

   int* GetNeighborList();
   void GetNeighborList(int* list);
   vtkIdType GetNumberOfNeighbors();

And in my ServerManagerXML file I have the following:
       <IntVectorProperty name="NeighborList"
         command="GetNeighborList"
         argument_is_array="1"
         number_of_elements="0"
         repeat_command="0"
         number_of_elements_per_command="1"
         use_index="0" >
         <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
         <Documentation>
             This property lists the neighbors of the grain
           </Documentation>
         </IntVectorProperty>

On the Client side I have the following bit of code to populate a  
QListWidget:

void pqH5TiDataReaderPanel::updateNeighborList(QListWidget*  
qListWidget, QString property)
{
   vtkSMProperty* smProperty = this->proxy()- 
 >GetProperty(property.toAscii());
   if (NULL == smProperty)
   {
     std::string msg = "SMProperty [int] was NULL for ";
     msg.append(property.toAscii() );
     DebugTrace(<< msg.c_str() );
     return;
   }
   vtkSMIntVectorProperty* intProperty
                     = vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(smProperty);
   if (NULL == intProperty)
   {
     std::string msg = "Could not SafeDownCase to  
vtkSMIntVectorProperty for property ";
     msg.append(property.toAscii() );
     DebugTrace(<< msg.c_str() );
     return;
   }
   //intProperty->GetArgumentIsArray();
   int* elements = intProperty->GetElements();
   int nElements = intProperty->GetNumberOfElements(); //<== ALWAYS 0
   qListWidget->clear();  // Remove all the content

   for (int i = 0; i < nElements; ++i)
   {
     qListWidget->addItem(QString::number(elements[i])); //<==== NEVER  
GETS HERE
   }
}

So, what am I doing wrong? I have tried reading through the relevant  
sections of the "ParaView Guide" but nothing is really jumping out.  
Also went looking for examples somewhere in the ParaView source code  
but came up empty. The ContourWidget is close but it "sends" its  
array, it never receives one from the server.

Any pointers would be great and much appreciated.

Message-ID: <D492B53B-5001-4B64-A940-FEAA49A7BFFE@bluequartz.net>

The problem is down in a generated file on the server side.

   if (!strcmp("GetNeighborList",method) &&  
msg.GetNumberOfArguments(0) == 3)
     {
     vtkClientServerStreamDataArg<int    > temp0(msg, 0, 2);
     if(temp0)
       {
       op->GetNeighborList(temp0);
       return 1;
       }
     }

The problem is that msg.GetNumberOfArguments(0) returns 2 and NOT 3. I  
have no idea of the internals of the msg object to try and figure out  
what is trying to be passed. Is the client sending in a index also? 2  
pointers? no idea.

I'll just assume from this that it is basically impossible to pass an  
array from the server to the Client in an "Information Only" fashion.  
I guess I can encode the values to a string and send that. Seems odd  
to have to encode the data into a string...

If anyone else has a better Idea I would much appreciate it.

Try returning a vtkIntArray from your reader instead and use
<IntArrayInformationHelper /> as the information helper. (Look at it's
use in readers.xml).

THANKS! that worked great. One last item - where would I look for an  
example of have a custom widget (QListWidget) that is NOT getting  
registered with the proxy mananger, so that when something changes,  
like the selection, the "Accept" button gets "lighted up". I am trying  
to work through the pqContourWidget but not sure if that is the best  
place to start.

I agree, the new input dialogs are a great improvement. May I suggest to 
slightly increase the dialog's width? I use to work with files with a 
rather long name. The dialog is quite small right now, could it be 
increase by, lets say 100 pixels? That't roughly what I am doing 
manually from time to time now.

Best regards,
Christian

Subject: [Paraview] Auto Apply after choosing filters - fatal
Message-ID: <4BAE813B.7010104@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I remember there was a discussion about the Apply button. Somebody 
mentioned it would be nice if a filter is automatically applied after a 
short moment when selected. I don't know how this happened but I have 
this behaviour now with my current cvs version. This is fatal, because 
like that, I cannot use some filters anymore on some of my data (e.g. 
Threshold, it eats my memory and cpu power away with it's standard 
settings, effectively freezing my PC for a long time until it crashes).

It seems that this functionality has to be enabled somehow and that I 
did that without knowing. At least I cannot remember installing a more 
recent cvs version for many days, and this behaviour is new. The actual 
version which I now installed also goes with auto-apply.

Despite that, this auto apply is really a very good idea. Maybe one 
could provide a <hint> in the appropriate xml that tells if this filter 
can safely be auto executed. But this is definetly not the case for all 
filters!

Can anyone tell me how to disable this?


Best regards,
Christian

Go to Edit | Settings dialog. On the first page itself (General),
there's a "Auto Accept" check box -- uncheck that to disable
auto-apply.

Subject: [Paraview] Selection of Multiple distinct cells/points
Message-ID: <4BAE9360.4030703@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I like the selection/spreadsheet combination. It helps you analyse your 
data alot. However in my case, I'd like to select several distinct cells 
in the 3D view by pressing the CTRL key, like in the spreadsheet view. 
This would save me a lot of time since I have to manually cut out (or 
extract the invers of) several unwanted objects out of my data.

Also, I would like to know if there is a way to select all cells 
belonging to one object (by connectivity). This would help in situations 
where different objects occlude each other. I have attached an image 
that explains the situation. In this case it is difficult to select the 
red object - parts of the green object which lies behind the red one are 
selected, too. I have data that will yield a lot more different objects. 
This will make the selection pretty hard.
Multiple selection would already help here, in that I could subsequently 
mark an object's cells from different viewpoints until I have captured 
it completely.

The data is the result a Contour filter with a Connectivity filter 
applied afterwards.

Best regards,
Christian

The ctrl+click selection would also help my group quite a bit. We typically
export and use Blender for these operations - it would be nice to stay in
Paraview.


Christian,
The Connectivity filter produces a "RegionId" array. You could use a
Threshold filter on the RegionId to select the object you want. It would be
nice if this could be wrapped into the "select connected object" filter that
you are talking about.

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] choppy derivatives
Message-ID: <3b6093ef1003272245g2c695843wf6b6781609817631@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

I have a 3D dataset with a Temperature field.  My goal is to insert a sphere
source and determine the tangential temperature gradient on the surface of
the sphere at various zenith angles.  The data is output from the code as
cell data.  Here is the way I'm doing this (through pvpython)

1.  Apply CellDataToPointData
2.  Apply ComputeDerivatives (to get the 'Scalar Gradient')
3.  Apply another CellDataToPointData (to turn the derivatives into point
data)
4.  Resample the data from step 3 with my sphere source.
5.  Use a programmable filter to combine the xyz derivatives appropriately.

The data is reasonable but it's fairly choppy.  When I look at dT/dx, dT/dy,
and dT/dz (before I project them onto the sphere surface), and plot them at
a particular zenith angle around the azimuth of the drop, dTdx and dTdy are
very smooth but dT/dz is fairly choppy (especially above the equator of the
drop).  If I expand my sphere to a place where there's not a lot going on
dT/dz seems to calm down.  Is there a way to smooth dT/dz in the location of
interest or should I try to write my own derivatives filter to make them
smoother?  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Peter.

Hi David,

thanks for your suggestion. The Threshold may help in the occluding 
scenario, but I am mainly looking for a way to extract several objects 
which might have completely different IDs, e.g. 2,10 and 137. Multiple 
selection would help here very much! For what I am doing it would 
perfectly suffice if I could just select one point per object on 
mulitple objects and only extract those points. Somehow I have the 
feeling that this was possible in 3.6. I will try that.

Best regards,
Christian

I just found out that the desired functionality IS there (multiselect 
with Ctrl). It just doesn't work with the frustum selection. Maybe this 
could be accomplished, too? Anyway I am fine for the moment.

Put together there remains this wishlist:   Selection of cells by 
connectivity (select all cells with same RegionID with one click)
                                                             Multiselect 
with Frustum
                                                             Multiselect 
with new RegionID Selection feature ... :)

Best regards,
Christian

Hey Christian,

There is also the new Find Data functionality in ParaView CVS that Utkarsh informed us about recently:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Find_Data_using_Queries

One of the choices there is "is one of", which takes a comma-separated list of attributes. So if you know the Region ID of the pieces you want, you can just list them there and "Run Selection" to grab them. It's maybe not as nice as just clicking, but it might do the trick.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Thanks for the info! However I am sorry to tell you that this selection 
query does not do its job. When I choose to select points with Region ID 
6,23 then it selects all points with region ID 0. It works if I say 6 
and 23 seperately (one at a time), but this way I cannot select both 
simultaneously. Also, the selection in general behaves strange. It seems 
to have a few glitches, I could reproduce this:

1) Have your objects in a 3D view and don't select anything. Then split 
your view and start a spreadsheet view. Select points in your 3D and 
switch back to spreadsheet view. Selection is gone.
2) In the 3D view and select some points. Open up a spreadsheet view. 
Switch between those two Views. Selection is gone.
3) When switching and selecting new points, then the spreadsheet does 
not always show the newly selected points. If it does, then some 
previously shown points are not listed anymore. In particular it listed 
only those points up to ID X where X is the RegionID of the newly 
selected points. I have to switch between "show all" and "show selected" 
to make the spreadsheet list all points again.

This is for a very recent (maybe two days old) cvs version.


Best regards,
Chrisian

Hello

I try to visualize data from an Octave finite difference calculation. I have the data in a csv file but I have 
only the result values somehow in a mesh structure (values are arranged as mesh from calculation. Is it possible to 
visualize this without preparing it in e.g. excel (putting all values in one column and adding coordinate columns)?

Thanks

Dear Berk,

this really helped me a lot, thanks!


But now Im stuck with another problem.

The scalar value that I'm trying to compare from the two data sets have the
same names.


meanTotalPressure


So when I do the AddArray() in my script the second array simply overrides
the first one.

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkFieldData.html#a22259e3c071ac8ff7a62ac49e9f1a92e



I tried to change the name with SetName() method, but it changes the Array
name globally, and the second time I run the filter the GetArray returns
NoneType object.


Do I have to copy the object to rename it?


Sincerely,

Luca

-----------------------------------
i0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
i1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
o = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
print "the class is: " + str(i0.GetPointData().GetArray
("meanTotalPressureMonitor").__class__)
array0 = i0.GetPointData().GetArray("meanTotalPressureMonitor")
array0.SetName("meanTotalPressure0")
o.GetPointData().AddArray(array0)
array1 = i1.GetPointData().GetArray("meanTotalPressureMonitor")
array1.SetName("meanTotalPressure1")
o.GetPointData().AddArray(array1)

Subject: [Paraview] How to have QWidget change the "Accept" state when it
	changes
Message-ID: <D67E8F73-35EF-4F22-B8E5-762C98AB2640@bluequartz.net>

  I have a custom reader panel that I am implementing. In the panel is  
a QListWidget that is filled with some integer values. The user can  
select any, some or none of them. The problem that I am having is that  
when the user changes their selection how do I trigger the "Accept"  
button to change state and thus when the "accept" button is clicked my  
new values will get passed back to the server.

  It looks like I should use the pqPropertyManger::registerLink(...)  
method but I am not real sure what all the arguments should be. Any  
pointers to examples or other sources would be great. I tried to  
follow the pqContourFilterPanel but got lost in the implementation  
details.

The PVSM XML that is being used is
<IntVectorProperty
   name="SelectedNeighborList"
   command="SetSelectedNeighborList"
   number_of_elements="0"
   argument_is_array="1"
   set_number_command="SetLoadNumberOfNeighbors"
   repeat_command="0"
   number_of_elements_per_command="1"
   use_index="0">
   <Documentation> This property lists the neighbors that will be loaded
     in addition to the main grain</Documentation>
</IntVectorProperty>

Thanks

Message-ID: <c19fcadc1003291051o528c4c8bx9adbe439ae7c190@mail.gmail.com>

I have some filters that make graphs on point clouds. They currently derive
from vtkGraphAlgorithm and then in FillInputPortInformation they accept a
vtkDataSet instead of a vtkGraph. The output remains a vtkGraph. To
visualize these things in Paraview, I have been using vtkGraphToPolyData to
convert the graph to a polydata data which can be written to a vtp file.

My question is: if I want to make a plugin for these graph-on-point-set
creation filters, should I make a wrapper class that derives from
vtkPolyDataAlgorithm and simply calls my class (which produces a vtkGraph)
followed by a call to vtkGraphToPolyData? Or is there a way that Paraview
can handle a vtkGraph output object directly?

Thanks,

David

Make sure you pick "is one of" as the query condition when using ","
separated values.

How are you making the spreadsheet view active? Are you clicking in
the blank part or the part showing data in the spreadsheet view? That
clears the selection in the spreadsheet view. You should click on the
titlebar or scrollbar or the headers.

All you really need it call setModified() on the pqObjectPanel
subclass every time the selection changes. That will enable the apply
button. Then override "accept()" and "reset()" methods to update the
servermanager-property using the selection  or vice-versa
respectively.

I verified this is indeed a bug. I've added it to the bugtracker :

It's because of the way selections on table views in Qt work. Short of
having Qt folks fix the behavior I don't see any non-hackish way of
dealing with it.

Subject: [Paraview] choppy derivatives
In-Reply-To: <3b6093ef1003272245g2c695843wf6b6781609817631@mail.gmail.com>

If you are looking to try different derivative filters, you could try the one of the Gradient filters.  They are similar to the ComputeDerivatives filter but should allow you to combine steps 2 and 3 together.  There is also recently added a vtkDataSetGradient filter to VTK.  It's not exposed in the ParaView filters list, but you could do so by plugging in some XML specification.  It provides yet another way to take the gradient and can go directly from cell data to point data.

Hello list,

I have a 3D dataset with a Temperature field.  My goal is to insert a sphere source and determine the tangential temperature gradient on the surface of the sphere at various zenith angles.  The data is output from the code as cell data.  Here is the way I'm doing this (through pvpython)

1.  Apply CellDataToPointData
2.  Apply ComputeDerivatives (to get the 'Scalar Gradient')
3.  Apply another CellDataToPointData (to turn the derivatives into point data)
4.  Resample the data from step 3 with my sphere source.
5.  Use a programmable filter to combine the xyz derivatives appropriately.

The data is reasonable but it's fairly choppy.  When I look at dT/dx, dT/dy, and dT/dz (before I project them onto the sphere surface), and plot them at a particular zenith angle around the azimuth of the drop, dTdx and dTdy are very smooth but dT/dz is fairly choppy (especially above the equator of the drop).  If I expand my sphere to a place where there's not a lot going on dT/dz seems to calm down.  Is there a way to smooth dT/dz in the location of interest or should I try to write my own derivatives filter to make them smoother?  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Peter.

Ok. Is there a way I can tell the Paraview plugin to run
vtkGraphToPolyData on the output of my filter so that paraview can
then display it? e.g. instead of calling GetOutput() on my filter,
could Paraview call GetPolyDataOutput()?

Thanks,

Easiest option would be create a new filter that applies your filter
and then graph-to-poly-data internally or use a Custom Filter --
manually create the pipeline once in the GUI then use Tools | Create
Custom Filter to create the custom filter.

I created a custom filter from 2 plugins (FullyConnectedGraphFilter
(.so) and GraphToPolyData (.xml) ). The filter worked correctly. Then
I restarted Paraview, and I got these errors:

I'm assuming it's related to my last email about .xml plugins not
getting loaded at startup? (since the custom filter is using the
plugin and it's not loaded yet, I guess that is a problem?)

Can anyone confirm this is what is happening and/or suggest a workaround?

To create a plugin, you need to specify its interface, that is the components of its object inspector and where the new filter should appear in the menus.
And then the linker generates a library, which extension is .so in the case of a dynamic library on Linux.
So may be the plugin appears in the plugin manager with its extension but there is only one plugin and the .xml should not appear as far as I know.
And the .xml file allows you to put your new filter in the filter list, or even create a new submenu with your own plugins grouped into it, which would avoir the need to go to the plugin inspector to launch them.
Hope it helps.

What about switching views with TAB? There is that blue border on the 
"active" widget. It sort of tempts you to first activate the other view 
before doing anything there.

A .so plugin I have a .h, .cxx, and .xml file that I have compiled
into a .so file. A .xml plugin I ONLY have a .xml file that is using
existing vtk .cxx/.h files. In the plugin manager, when you load a new
plugin, you have to change the file type drop down box to ".xml" to
load an xml file directly.

Sorry if that wasn't clear before.

Thanks,

David

Interesting idea. Feel free to add a feature request for that. We can

Unfortunately, you have to copy the array with something like:

copy_array = original_array.NewInstance()
copy_array.DeepCopy(original_array)
copy_array.SetName("foo")
copy_array.UnRegister(None)

Having said that there might be a better way of doing this. Are you
planning to use the calculator to compare these arrays later in the
pipeline?

I wonder if this is because of the multiple celldata -> point data
conversions. Do you have an example dataset you can share?

Dear Berk,
Yes, I'd like to get the difference of the two arrays. 
Maybe I should try to do it directly in the programmable filter and simply 
return the result array...

Any suggestion is welcome...

Thank you very much for your help,
Luca

I just noticed that the ParaView-3-8 branch on github is incomplete.  Is this branch intended to be supported on github, or do we have to wait for ParaView to switch from CVS to git?

Is there any chance you can compile from source? There is an easy way
of doing this in 3.8. (There will be an even easier one after 3.8).

Requirements:
- ParaView compiled with Python
- NumPy

Recipe:
- Select 2 objects in the pipeline browser
- Apply Programmable Filter
- Use a script like the following:

output.PointData.append(inputs[0].PointData['Normals'] -
inputs[1].PointData['Normals'], 'difference')

(replace Normals with whatever array you want to compare).

Note that you will still need to merge the blocks beforehand if your
objects are multi-block.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkCompositeDataIterator and GoToFirstItem()
Message-ID: <31F5C6F81A444689A3E6458A5D652045@win.ara>


I'm using the vtkCompositeDataIterator to iterate over a multiblock data-set
multiple times. I'd like to reuse the iterator I create in the first
instance by using GoToFirstItem after it has finished the traversal, but I'm
getting a segmentation fault. Is this possible or am I doing this wrong?
Example code below:

      for ( vtkIdType i = 0; i != max; ++i ) {
	  vtkCompositeDataIterator* iter = test->NewIterator();
        iter->GoToFirstItem();
        for ( int j = 0; j != test->GetNumberOfBlocks(); ++j ) {
          //do something here
        }
        iter->GoToNextItem();
      }
      iter->Delete();

It works when the for loops are switched around. I'm just interested to see
what the performance difference is between them:

	vtkCompositeDataIterator* iter = test->NewIterator();
      iter->GoToFirstItem();
	for ( int j = 0; j != test->GetNumberOfBlocks(); ++j ) {
        for ( vtkIdType i = 0; i != max; ++i ) {
          //do something here
        }
        iter->GoToNextItem();
      }
      iter->Delete();

Cheers,

Adriano

You might want to attach a debugger and produce a stack trace to see
where you are getting a segfault.

Sorry, I forgot to mention that. The seg fault occurs when the new
vtkCompositeDataIterator is created at i=1. I just realised the first block
of code I posted was wrong anyway. This is the correct (but not working)
routine:

 ? ? ?for ( vtkIdType i = 0; i != max; ++i ) {
 ? ? ? ?vtkCompositeDataIterator* iter = test->NewIterator();
 ? ? ? ?iter->GoToFirstItem();
 ? ? ? ?for ( int j = 0; j != test->GetNumberOfBlocks(); ++j ) {
 ? ? ? ? ?//do something here

	    iter->GoToNextItem();
 ? ? ? ?}
 ?      iter->Delete();
 ? ? ?}

I'm assuming that what I'm trying just isn't possible, but it would be nice
to know if there is a way of achieving this.

You might want to attach a debugger and produce a stack trace to see where
you are getting a segfault.

Subject: [Paraview] Default representation for a custom source/filter
Message-ID: <z2rc9adba421003311011vc2753f40re9c8adb2246753b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a way in the XML file to set the default representation for
the output of a custom source/filter?  One thing I have noticed is
that a reader creating a multiblock dataset containing an unstructured
grid does not obey the outline threshold limit in the settings
(although applying filters afterwards does - e.g. if I extract the
unstructured grid from the dataset).

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Do you need to call InitTraversal first?

GoToFirstItem() and InitTraversal() are almost equivalent, so that
should not matter. What's happening in "//do something here". Are you
sure test remains valid at the end of it?

You might want to check
vtkCompositeDataIterator::IsDoneWithTraversal() to make sure you stay
within the bounds.

I think my question is fairly simple: If I create a new vtkunstructuredgrid
object, how to write it to a file?

Thanks you for being so supportive!

What exactly is the goal with your script? Are you always going to use<br>

"git-pull - Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch"

So in effect what you did was you tried to merge the release branch
into the one you were currently on (probably master).

What I do in such cases is:
> git fetch origin
> git checkout -b <local branch name> origin/release

ing I couldn&#39;t reproduce the orphans with out doing something a little =
odd namely, ssh ... &amp;&amp; =A0sleep 1d. Although the fact that a user r=
eported suggests that it may occur in the real world as well. The question =
is this: should an application explicitly clean up resources it allocates? =
or should an application rely on the user not only knowing that there is th=
e potential for a resource leak but also knowing enough to do the right thi=
ng to avoid it (eg ssh -tt ...)? In my opinion, as a matter of principle, i=
f PV spawns a process it should explicitly clean it up and there should be =
no way it can become an orphan. In this case the fact that the orphan can h=
old ports open is particularly insidious, because further connection attemp=
t on that port fails with no helpful error information. Also it is not very=
 difficult to clean up a spawned process. What it comes down to is a little=
 book keeping to hang on to the qprocess handle and a few lines of code cal=
led from pqCommandServerStartup destructor to make certain it&#39;s cleaned=
 up. This is from the patch I submitted when I filed the bug report.<br>

<br>
+ =A0 =A0// close running process<br>
+ =A0 =A0if (this-&gt;Process-&gt;state()=3D=3DQProcess::Running)<br>
+ =A0 =A0 =A0{<br>
+ =A0 =A0 =A0this-&gt;Process-&gt;close();<br>
+ =A0 =A0 =A0}<br>
+ =A0 =A0// free the object<br>
+ =A0 =A0delete this-&gt;Process;<br>
+ =A0 =A0this-&gt;Process=3DNULL;<br>
<br>
I think if the cluster admins out there new which ssh options (GatewayPorts=
 etc) are important for ParView to work seamlessly, then they might be will=
ing to open them up. It&#39;s my impression that the folks that build clust=
ers want tools like PV to be easy to use, but they don&#39;t necessarily kn=
ow all the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of confinguring and running PV.<br>

<br>
Thanks for looking at this again! The -tt option to ssh is indeed a good fi=
nd.<br>

Hi all!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m bringing this thread back- I have learned a couple new things...<br=
>
<br>
-----------------------<br>
No more orphans:<br>
<br>
Here is an easy way to create an orphan:<br>
<br>
 =A0 $ ssh localhost sleep 1d<br>
 =A0 $ &lt;press control c&gt;<br>
<br>
The ssh process is cleaned up, but sshd orphans the sleep process. =A0You c=
an avoid this by adding &#39;-t&#39; to ssh:<br>
<br>
 =A0$ ssh -t localhost sleep 1d<br>
<br>
Works like a charm! =A0But then there is another problem... try this comman=
d from paraview (using QProcess) and it still leaves an orphan, doh! =A0Go =
back and re-read ssh&#39;s man page and you have the solution, use &#39;-t&=
#39; twice: ssh -tt<br>

<br>
-------------------------<br>
GatewayPorts and portfwd workaround:<br>
<br>
In this scenario we have 3 machines: workstation, service-node, and compute=
-node. =A0I want to ssh from workstation to service-node and submit a job t=
hat will run pvserver on compute-node. =A0When pvserver starts on compute-n=
ode I want it to reverse connect to service-node and I want service-node to=
 forward the connection to workstation. =A0So here I go:<br>

<br>
 =A0 $ ssh -R11111:localhost:11111 service-node qsub start_pvserver.sh<br>
<br>
Oops, the qsub command returns immediately and closes my ssh tunnel. =A0Let=
&#39;s pretend that the scheduler doesn&#39;t provide an easy way to keep t=
he command alive, so I have resorted to using &#39;sleep 1d&#39;. =A0So her=
e I go, using -tt to prevent orphans:<br>

<br>
 =A0$ ssh -tt -R11111:localhost:11111 service-node &quot;qsub start_pvserve=
r.sh &amp;&amp; sleep 1d&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, this will only work if GatewayPorts is enabled in sshd_config on serv=
ice-node. =A0If GatewayPorts is not enabled, the ssh tunnel will only accep=
t connections from localhost, it will not accept a connection from compute-=
node. =A0We can ask the sysadmin to enable GatewayPorts, or we could use po=
rtfwd. =A0You can run portfwd on service-node to forward port 22222 to port=
 11111, then have compute-node connect to service-node:22222. =A0So your jo=
b script would launch pvserver like this:<br>

<br>
 =A0pvserver -rc -ch=3Dservice-node -sp=3D22222<br>
<br>
Problem solved! =A0Also convenient, we can use portfwd to replace &#39;slee=

ing I couldn&#39;t reproduce the orphans with out doing something a little =
odd namely, ssh ... &amp;&amp; =A0sleep 1d. Although the fact that a user r=
eported suggests that it may occur in the real world as well. The question =
is this: should an application explicitly clean up resources it allocates? =
or should an application rely on the user not only knowing that there is th=
e potential for a resource leak but also knowing enough to do the right thi=
ng to avoid it (eg ssh -tt ...)? In my opinion, as a matter of principle, i=
f PV spawns a process it should explicitly clean it up and there should be =
no way it can become an orphan. In this case the fact that the orphan can h=
old ports open is particularly insidious, because further connection attemp=
t on that port fails with no helpful error information. Also it is not very=
 difficult to clean up a spawned process. What it comes down to is a little=
 book keeping to hang on to the qprocess handle and a few lines of code cal=
led from pqCommandServerStartup destructor to make certain it&#39;s cleaned=
 up. This is from the patch I submitted when I filed the bug report.<br>

<br>
I think if the cluster admins out there new which ssh options (GatewayPorts=
 etc) are important for ParView to work seamlessly, then they might be will=
ing to open them up. It&#39;s my impression that the folks that build clust=
ers want tools like PV to be easy to use, but they don&#39;t necessarily kn=
ow all the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of confinguring and running PV.<br>


<br>
Thanks for looking at this again! The -tt option to ssh is indeed a good fi=
nd.<br>

Hi all!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m bringing this thread back- I have learned a couple new things...<br=
>
<br>
-----------------------<br>
No more orphans:<br>
<br>
Here is an easy way to create an orphan:<br>
<br>
 =A0 $ ssh localhost sleep 1d<br>
 =A0 $ &lt;press control c&gt;<br>
<br>
The ssh process is cleaned up, but sshd orphans the sleep process. =A0You c=
an avoid this by adding &#39;-t&#39; to ssh:<br>
<br>
 =A0$ ssh -t localhost sleep 1d<br>
<br>
Works like a charm! =A0But then there is another problem... try this comman=
d from paraview (using QProcess) and it still leaves an orphan, doh! =A0Go =
back and re-read ssh&#39;s man page and you have the solution, use &#39;-t&=
#39; twice: ssh -tt<br>


<br>
-------------------------<br>
GatewayPorts and portfwd workaround:<br>
<br>
In this scenario we have 3 machines: workstation, service-node, and compute=
-node. =A0I want to ssh from workstation to service-node and submit a job t=
hat will run pvserver on compute-node. =A0When pvserver starts on compute-n=
ode I want it to reverse connect to service-node and I want service-node to=
 forward the connection to workstation. =A0So here I go:<br>


<br>
 =A0 $ ssh -R11111:localhost:11111 service-node qsub start_pvserver.sh<br>
<br>
Oops, the qsub command returns immediately and closes my ssh tunnel. =A0Let=
&#39;s pretend that the scheduler doesn&#39;t provide an easy way to keep t=
he command alive, so I have resorted to using &#39;sleep 1d&#39;. =A0So her=
e I go, using -tt to prevent orphans:<br>


<br>
 =A0$ ssh -tt -R11111:localhost:11111 service-node &quot;qsub start_pvserve=
r.sh &amp;&amp; sleep 1d&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, this will only work if GatewayPorts is enabled in sshd_config on serv=
ice-node. =A0If GatewayPorts is not enabled, the ssh tunnel will only accep=
t connections from localhost, it will not accept a connection from compute-=
node. =A0We can ask the sysadmin to enable GatewayPorts, or we could use po=
rtfwd. =A0You can run portfwd on service-node to forward port 22222 to port=
 11111, then have compute-node connect to service-node:22222. =A0So your jo=
b script would launch pvserver like this:<br>


<br>
 =A0pvserver -rc -ch=3Dservice-node -sp=3D22222<br>
<br>
Problem solved! =A0Also convenient, we can use portfwd to replace &#39;slee=
p 1d&#39;. =A0So the final command, executed by paraview client:<br>
<br>
 =A0ssh -tt -R 11111:localhost:11111 service-node &quot;qsub start_pvserver=
.sh &amp;&amp; portfwd -g -c fwd.cfg&quot;<br>
<br>
Where fwd.cfg contains:<br>
<br>
 =A0tcp { 22222 { =3D&gt; localhost:11111 } }<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>
<br>
Pat<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slice1.Input = OutputPort(ll9cellf523_ncdf, 1)<br>
<br>
But that gives<br>

Trying either<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slice1.Input = ll9cellf523_ncdf.Port(1)<br>

runs, but the slice is still only slicing the external surface.<br>
<br>
My test script is below.<br>

p.s., I actually want to do something else (use a calculator to get
efield magnitude, and then plot isocontour surfaces from that), but
this slice example seemed simplest, and I'm assuming that once that
works, the other stuff will work in the same way.<br>

like I should be able to:<br>
    <br>
=A0=A0=A0=A0 Slice1.Input =3D OutputPort(ll9cellf523_ncdf, 1)<br>
    <br>
But that gives<br>
    <br>
=A0=A0=A0 NameError: name &#39;OutputPort&#39; is not defined<br>
    <br>
Trying either<br>
=A0=A0=A0 <br>
=A0=A0=A0 Slice1.Input =3D ll9cellf523_ncdf.Port(0)=A0 <br>
=A0=A0=A0 Slice1.Input =3D ll9cellf523_ncdf.Port(1)<br>
    <br>
runs, but the slice is still only slicing the external surface.<br>
    <br>
My test script is below.<br>
    <br>
Thanks for any help.<br>
    <br>

p.s., I actually want to do something else (use a calculator to get
efield magnitude, and then plot isocontour surfaces from that), but
this slice example seemed simplest, and I&#39;m assuming that once that
works, the other stuff will work in the same way.<br>

Grid. I don't know resampling filters for such data in VTK/ParaView.
One solution could be to resample your input volume, and then perform the
sphere/plane slicing.
Take a look at VTK's vtkImageResample and how to enable a native VTK filter
in ParaView: if you get it working, please tell me! I had a weird bounded extent
when performing oversampling.
