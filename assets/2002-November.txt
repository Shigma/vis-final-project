Subject: [Paraview] No rendering output
Message-ID: <3DCA3A91.CFC6ED30@cns.mpg.de>

Hi,

I have been trying to get ParaView(v0.6) to run on an SGI O2, Irix 6.5.
However, all I see are gray rectangles in the 3d View output regardless
whether I load/create simple objects(spheres etc) or try to run the
demo. (I can send a screenshot if necessary)
I am using the precompiled binaries for Irix6.5.

I have also been trying to compile the sources for ParaView Complete
v0.6. CMake configuration runs fine.
However, I get a compilation error early on in the build process:

cmake.depends is up-to-date
cd /opt/ParaViewComplete06/tcl8.3.2/unix gmake
/bin/sh: cd: bad substitution
gmake[1]: *** [maketcl] Error 1
gmake: *** [default_target] Error 2

Is it ok to use the SGI TCL interpreter when prompted by CMake ?

Any hints as to what is going wrong are greatly appreciated.

A screenshot would be nice. Also, can you try to run with the -r option?
This option enables software rendering. I have never tested the IRIX 
binary with SGI OpenGL since I only have remote access to SGIs. I have
always used software rendering (Mesa) on Octanes and that worked.
If there are ParaView users which have access to SGIs, I would 
appreciate it if they try the SGI binary and let me know know if they
have the same problem.

Which version of CMake are you using ? You will need CMake 1.4.5
or later to build ParaView.

Which option is this ? Are you using cmake -i or ccmake ?

Subject: [Paraview] Raw File Reader
Message-ID: <3DCB925B.A2EDDA93@copepod.de>

Hi,
I would like to load a 2D-image-stack into ParaView. If I just use "open
data" it does not work. Therefore I am trying to use the "Raw File
Reader" now. In order to do that I figured I will have to convert the
TIF images to RAW format. This seems to be difficult since no universal
definition exsists for the RAW format. Still I was lucky to find out
that the newest version of "Irfan View" does do batch file conversion
from TIF to RAW file format. ParaView does seem to load the image-stack
but still I couldn't make ParaView display it. Also the choices Irfan
View offers for saving in RAW format (f.ex. RGB vs. BGR)  seem to be
about different topics than the choices ParaView offers for reading RAW
format (f. ex. data typ: char, short, etc.). Does anyone have any
suggestions how this problem may be solved? I would very much appreciate
any idea you could offer.
With regards,
Birke

Can you describe a little bit what kind of visualization you are after 
and what kind of data you are processing ?
ParaView's support for loading 3D images written in 2D slices and
displaying them is relatively primitive since it was not designed for
visualizing medical data (or any data obtained from 3D scanners etc).

After fiddling around a little bit with the raw files, I managed to
load it properly into ParaView (heeren_example_rgb_planar.raw).
Here are the settings for the reader:
File Prefix: /home/berk/heeren_example_rgb_planar.raw
File Pattern: %s
Data Type: Unsigned char
Byte Order: Little Endian
Origin: 0 0 0
Spacing: 1 1 1 (you might have to play with spacing, I didn't know the
values)
Extent: 0 511 0 511 0 0
Num. Components: 1

To load a stack of images, you will have to change the file prefix,
file pattern and the last value of the extent.

I put the image into a different folder and then I was able to open it with
the raw file reader. Before the image had been in a subdirectory of a
subdirectory of ... - maybe the path had gotten too long for Paraview to
handle it?

By any chance, did the previous path contain a space ?

Hi,
why is it that my graylevel image (loaded with the raw file reader) is
displayed in color? For example, the background should be black but is
displayed in bright green.
When I load a 2D-image-stack (instead of just on 2D-image) an empty box
appears in the display window but nothing else.

ParaView was not designed as an image processing tool. Because of
this, it does not know that you are loading a greyscale image. It
treats this data as a uniform grid which has scalar values at each
point. Because of this: 1. you will notice that interacting with
large 2D images is slow, because ParaView will generate a polygon for
each cell (pixel) and render them in full 3D, 2. the colors will not
match that of the image. Essentially, ParaView uses a lookup table 
to map scalar values (in this case, each pixel value) to colors.
The default lookup table maps the lowest value to red and highest
value to blue. You can change to a grayscale lookup table using
Edit Color Map in the Display page. See the documentation for datails.

Indeed. Since ParaView does not support volume rendering, it has
no default way of displaying volumes. You will have to either
1. extract cut planes, 2. extract sub-grids, 3. extract iso-surfaces
or 4. extract external surfaces to look at your data. The head
screenshots on the ParaView web page were creating using the
cut and iso-surface tools.

Message-ID: <1021112100847.ZM5617@pecos.ncsa.uiuc.edu>

As I get ready to build Paraview 0.6, a question... I've recently built VTK
myself (on Linux, using libtcl8.3.so) and I see that Paraview requires Tcl/Tk
8.3.2.  Does that mean I would have had to build VTK with 8.3.2 also?

What's the Tcl cmd to find out what version is running?  (In the superior
Python lng, simply typing in 'python' will tell you exactly which version is
running :)

thanks,

info tclversion

which will probably say 8.3 not 8.3.2. To see whether it's
8.3.2, you have to look at tcl.h.
