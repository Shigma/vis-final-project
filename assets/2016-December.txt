Camera link is nice, but not what I want.

Example:
- load a stl file
- make a clip and use red as solid color
- open a new view or layout

Now it would be useful to have the same "image" in the new view or layout:
- the clip is in show
- the clipped geometry has the color red

It's like a copy and paste of all settings of a view.

You mean link the cameras for two views?  Right click on the background, then left click in the other view.

Hi,

do you know a way to duplicate a Layout, in GUI or python?
This would be useful when you want to have different Layouts with slightly different color bar settings, for example.

Kind regards

Tobias

Hi Tobias

You could get the DisplayProperties of all your objects and then set them
accordingly in the new render window using the Python Shell. I have written a
short script for myself for this task --- however something is not quite
correct, as strange colorings sometimes appear after turning the model in the
second view. It can be fixed by making that object invisible and visible again,
but still.... Maybe someone more experienced can correct my answer in that
respect or has a better idea to tackle this problem...?

Here is my code:

rv1=GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
ALL=GetSources()

dispProps=list()
for i in range(len(ALL.keys())):
	dispProps.append(GetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[i]))

viewLayout1 = GetLayout()
viewLayout1.SplitHorizontal(0, 0.5)

rv2=CreateView('RenderView')
viewLayout1.AssignView(2, rv2)

SetActiveView(rv2)

for j in range(len(ALL.keys())):
	SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Visibility=dispProps[j].Visibility)

SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],ColorArrayName=dispProps[j].ColorArrayName[1])
	SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],LookupTable=dispProps[j].LookupTable)
	SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],DiffuseColor=dispProps[j].DiffuseColor)
	SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Scale=dispProps[j].Scale)

SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Representation=dispProps[j].Representation)
	SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Texture=dispProps[j].Texture)



Cheers
Venke

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to rescale properly the color map
Message-ID: <DB5PR04MB2088F99B7EA9970315C3D498B98F0@DB5PR04MB2088.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear developers,


I'm loading a vtp file in Paraview 5.2 containing the agglomerated mesh and a scalar field (INT32) for the global cellID. The coarsest mesh has few cells characterized by a high identification number (cellID ranges from 1600000 to 1600010]. Paraview is not able to rescale properly the range of the color map even with the custom data range and everything is displayed with a blue color and it becomes useless. Is there a way to change the precision for the color map.


I have also tested the version 5.0.1 which scales better but still cannot go below a certain range.


Please let me know.


Best regards,


Luigi

To follow up on this issue, I have done some more testing. From the link
below you can find two datasets with polyhedral cells, where one is
working just fine and the other one is crashing consistently when
opening it in ParaView 5.2.
The XDMF files are created form the respective .vtu files with ParaView
5.2 (Kitware binaries, Linux 64bit) using the Xdmf3 writer.

The strange thing is that the dataset leading to the seg fault is a
subset of the dataset that just works fine.

Here the link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5CHY8CFeTf2V09NVUhTRkpYSE0/view?usp=sharing

Alessandro, can you test these files and report back which ones are
working on your PC?

Thanks,
Armin

Message-ID: <7d1d07e4-427c-3077-35c0-268bab93b671@uwaterloo.ca>

Dear Paraview Developer,

May you please help me with the following issue:

Suppose when a solver writes data out, the field data is written in 
Ensight format, and the time sequence is streamed in "ensight.case".
Meanwhile, the geometry data is written in VTK format, and the time 
sequence is streamed in "paraview.pvd".
At last, let's assume the number of time sequences is 500.

Then, when loading into paraview, it does not synchronize the cases in a 
perfect sense and would show up with 1000 cases. When animating,
there is a slight mismatch in time for the field data and geometry data. 
However, if I use the VTK format for both the field and geometry data,
then paraview does a great job to synchronize the data sets.

Therefore, my question would be that is it possible to handle time 
synchronization even for different formats?

Thank you very much for your time and help,
Huangrui

Not sure if this is the correct answer, but try view/ animation View.  Then, change the Mode to Real Time.  Enter your start time and end time, and number of time steps of interest (i.e., 500).

Is that what you are looking for?

Message-ID: <zarafa.5840623b.03fa.35a25cb057f7e5ca@mail-znode-stud1.rus.uni-stuttgart.de>

?Good day,

I am currently developping a bunch of plugins (filters) for Paraview in the following setup:



I have input data as a rectilinear grid, including an array of scalar values per cell (volume-of-fluid data (vof)). On this data I now want to perform some calculations. First, a plugin calculates the gradient. Then, another plugin takes the grid with the vof-data and the gradients to calculate other vectors. This goes on for a few plugins.

The problem I get is that every time another filter is applied onto the last one, I copy all the data and add another array with the filter's own results. Thus, the second filter stores its own calculation and the source data, the third filter stores its own calculation, the calculation of the previous plugin and the source data.

You can see, that this results in a huge increase of memory usage.

Now to my question: Is there a possibility or method which passes along a pointer, or a copy pointing to the input of the plugin to which I then only need to add another array? Additionally I might add that the grid itself always stays the same, only each filter appends another array.

I hope you can help me, or at least quickly tell me if it is not possible at all.

Kind regards,
Alexander Straub

Lugi,
I am fairly sure you are seeing this bug: https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/16978.  It is scheduled to be fixed in an upcoming release, but the solution isn't trivial.  I will add your example to the bug.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Unable to rescale properly the color map


Dear developers,



I'm loading a vtp file in Paraview 5.2 containing the agglomerated mesh and a scalar field (INT32) for the global cellID. The coarsest mesh has few cells characterized by a high identification number (cellID ranges from 1600000 to 1600010]. Paraview is not able to rescale properly the range of the color map even with the custom data range and everything is displayed with a blue color and it becomes useless. Is there a way to change the precision for the color map.



I have also tested the version 5.0.1 which scales better but still cannot go below a certain range.



Please let me know.



Best regards,



Luigi

Many VTK objects have a ShallowCopy method that does what you want. You can
shallow copy the entire datasets (which just copies pointers to data into a
new dataset container), or selectively copy e.g. points.

Datasets can easily share components. For instance, if you have two grids
that have the same points, you can do something like:

grid1->SetPoints(grid2->GetPoints());

and both grids will share the same vtkPoints object and its associated
memory buffers.

Actually, I think Sequence mode is more appropriate than Real Time mode in this case, but I too think that is the answer. 

To explain more what (we think) is going on: When you load data with time in ParaView, it goes to a Snap to Timesteps mode where it will visit each unique timestep once regardless of how far apart they are. Thus, ParaView is treating the numerical imprecision of the different times as unique time steps. If you switch to Sequence or Real Time mode, ParaView uses its own time units and will provide an even temporal spacing. 

There is more information about the different animation modes in the ParaView tutorial.

Huangrui,

I found a work around that I think does what you want. After you load in your two data sets, right click on one of them in the Pipeline Browser and check on the ?Ignore Time? option. This will tell ParaView to ignore the time in that data set, so will only visit the time steps in the other data set.

Actually, this _almost_ works. There is in fact a problem (at least with the example data sets you sent us). The imprecision is not uniform. Sometimes the time for field.case is ahead, other times the time for geo_stl.pvd is ahead. So, when you play through the time steps, sometimes the data for which you are ignoring time are skipped because the time is first just before one step and then just after another.

To fix this problem, you can use the Temporal Shift Scale filter to adjust the time of one of the data sets to subtract a bit to ensure that every time hits in between time steps. Here is specifically what I did with the test data that you sent to fix the problem.

1. Load in the field.case and geo_stl.pvd files. Apply both.
2. Add the Temporal Shift Scale filter to geo_stl.pvd. Set the Pre Shift to -0.005. Apply.
3. Right click on TemporalShiftScale1 in the pipeline browser and select ?Ignore Time?

Now when you hit play you should get the right amount of time steps with the data you expect loaded.

    Hello Alan and Ken,
    
    Thank you very much for your prompt response of my question.
    
    After testing your suggestions, I found both the Real Time Mode and 
    Sequence Mode can correctly synchronize the
    two data sets with mixed formats, if a correct number of steps is given. 
    However, both of the above two methods
    share a common subproblem: they give artificial time steps that are 
    different with the "true" time moments contained in
    the case (or pvd) files, when a annotated time filter is used, even the 
    specified number of steps matches the true number of case files.
    
    Regarding the Snap to Timesteps mode and the numerical imprecision of 
    the different times problem raised by Ken, I provided an example
    data set attached in this email. This data set contains the simulated 
    flow field of three airfoils running on a fixed Cartesian background grid.
    Since the Cartesian grid is fixed, therefore, using Ensight format for 
    the field data has the advantage to avoid outputting the grid 
    coordinates in each
    time step but only the physical quantities. To facilitate the testing, I 
    solved this problem exactly twice, the only difference is that one uses 
    Ensight for field data
    and VTK for geometry, the other uses both VTK. Each data sets has 10 
    time sequences, and the time steps in each data sets are all the same.
    
    When loading the mixed data sets, the field.case + geo_stl.pvd gives 20 
    sequences, and the field.pvd + geo_stl.pvd  gives 10 synchronized sequences.
    
    Due to the artificial times steps in the Real Time Mode and Sequence 
    Mod, is there a way to synchronize the mixed case in the Snap to 
    Timesteps mode?
    
    Thanks a lot,
    Huangrui

Hello Ken,

Thank you for the provided solution, however, it seems like the solution 
does not work well: using the Paraview 5.2.0
(I just downloaded the latest version, and realizing that there is a 
modification on showing the max counter of time steps),
after applying the method you provided, it artificially works for the 
first 9 counts, but when you input "10", then you would realize that
the mismatch is still there :D

I have found the following weired situation:

1) The time values in field.case, field.pvd, geo_stl.pvd are all exactly 
the same and are all in ASCII format.
2) When paraview read in the field.pvd or geo_stl.pvd, it will change 
the floating point values slightly, however, it maintains consistence
if they are ".pvd" files. Therefore, it correctly synchronizes these two 
data sets.
3) When paraview read in the field.case, the floating point 
representation of the time values are changed slightly and are not 
consistently with ".pvd" files.
However, in this mixed case, the "0" value is the same, so paraview 
merges field.case and geo_stl.pvd for time "0", and reduces the total 
number of cases
from 11 + 11 to 21. (sorry for previous miscalculation of the counter, 
it's 11 rather than 10 for each data set.)

Is it because when reading Ensight format, paraview choose single 
precision, but using double  precision for .pvd file? Is there a way to 
fix this problem, since
the time values are all in ASCII format.

Thanks,
Huangrui

Sometimes the time for field.case is ahead, other times the time for geo_stl.pvd is ahead. So, when you play through the time steps, sometimes the data for which you are ignoring time are skipped because the time is first just before one step and then just after another.

If you switch to Sequence or Real Time mode, ParaView uses its own time units and will provide an even temporal spacing.

If I understand you correctly, you were able to take each experimental plane and sample it in a the CFD data on the same plane? Now you would like to stack your experimental planes together and interpolate it onto the CFD grid?


I haven't done this, so I'm not sure if it's going to work, but can't you do a little preprocessing and then do the steps in reverse from before? What I mean is:


1. Take all your experimental planes (u, v, w, x, y) at a given z and concatenate the files together, adding the z coordinate at the end, to get (u, v, w, x, y, z)

2. Load this into Paraview and use the TableToPoints filter

3. Load your CFD grid

4. Select your TableToPoints filter and do:

    a. ResampleWithDataset -- select the TableToPoints as the input and the CFD grid as the Source


This should then give you the data points from the experimental data interpolated onto the CFD grid.


Does that seem like what you are trying to do?

Tim,

I successfully used my experimental data planes to sample my CFD data for comparison, but now I've got another procedure to tackle.

I am looking to interpolate between my experimental planes and fill in the volumetric velocity data. I've spent significant time working with the GaussianResample filter, but it seems to eliminate some of my data. Specifically, GaussianResample can only interpolate scalars, so I have to decompose my velocity vector into its components. This seems to work fine, except that when the GaussianResample filter is applied the negative values of these components are eliminated. Then, when I re-calculate my velocity vector as a sum of the component it is obviously wrong because none of the components are permitted to be negative.

Are there any other filters in existence that I can use for interpolation?

Any help will be most appreciated.

Mike,


Your state file doesn't work without the data files that go along with it.


That said, here is how you can do it:


1. Load your .dat file and use the TableToPoints filter to create points from the data table -- select your x, y, z appropriately

2. Load your CFD data file

3. Select your CFD data file and then do:

    a. ResampleWithDataset -- select the CFD data as the Input and the TableToPoints as the Source

4. This will give you the data interpolated to the points in the table, if you want a plane from this data, apply the Delaunay2D filter and select Best-Fitting Plane (if the points are not X-Y points only).


That should give you the data from your CFD simulation on the same plane as your PIV data.


I see you are at GT -- let me know if you are still unclear on these steps and would like to talk in person.

I have three planes of experimental PIV data with velocity point data in .dat format loaded in Paraview. I am hoping to use these planes to interpolate/extrapolate velocity values onto a custom volumetric mesh (i.e. from a CFD simulation) to compare experimental results with simulation results in hopes of validating the simulation. I have attached my Paraview state file. Any help will be much appreciated.

No problem Alan. Thanks for replying. I thought my issue was due to truncation. Anyhow, I had a look at the bug #16978 and, if I can, I would like to give my opinion. When min and max are the same or both zero, I expect as user to see an unique color in the color map either red or blue. If you add an eps to the max and still show the full rgb color map, I would think immediately that there are not enough digit in the label and I would start playing with that or rescaling to find where the differences are.


Best regards,


Luigi

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Unable to rescale properly the color map



Dear developers,



I'm loading a vtp file in Paraview 5.2 containing the agglomerated mesh and a scalar field (INT32) for the global cellID. The coarsest mesh has few cells characterized by a high identification number (cellID ranges from 1600000 to 1600010]. Paraview is not able to rescale properly the range of the color map even with the custom data range and everything is displayed with a blue color and it becomes useless. Is there a way to change the precision for the color map.



I have also tested the version 5.0.1 which scales better but still cannot go below a certain range.



Please let me know.



Best regards,



Luigi

I may have told you the wrong parameters. Try using 0.005 for the temporal shift rather than -0.005.

    Hello Ken,
    
    Thank you for the provided solution, however, it seems like the solution 
    does not work well: using the Paraview 5.2.0
    (I just downloaded the latest version, and realizing that there is a 
    modification on showing the max counter of time steps),
    after applying the method you provided, it artificially works for the 
    first 9 counts, but when you input "10", then you would realize that
    the mismatch is still there :D
    
    I have found the following weired situation:
    
    1) The time values in field.case, field.pvd, geo_stl.pvd are all exactly 
    the same and are all in ASCII format.
    2) When paraview read in the field.pvd or geo_stl.pvd, it will change 
    the floating point values slightly, however, it maintains consistence
    if they are ".pvd" files. Therefore, it correctly synchronizes these two 
    data sets.
    3) When paraview read in the field.case, the floating point 
    representation of the time values are changed slightly and are not 
    consistently with ".pvd" files.
    However, in this mixed case, the "0" value is the same, so paraview 
    merges field.case and geo_stl.pvd for time "0", and reduces the total 
    number of cases
    from 11 + 11 to 21. (sorry for previous miscalculation of the counter, 
    it's 11 rather than 10 for each data set.)
    
    Is it because when reading Ensight format, paraview choose single 
    precision, but using double  precision for .pvd file? Is there a way to 
    fix this problem, since
    the time values are all in ASCII format.
    
    Thanks,
    Huangrui

Sometimes the time for field.case is ahead, other times the time for geo_stl.pvd is ahead. So, when you play through the time steps, sometimes the data for which you are ignoring time are skipped because the time is first just before one step and then just after another.

Thus, ParaView is treating the numerical imprecision of the different times as unique time steps. If you switch to Sequence or Real Time mode, ParaView uses its own time units and will provide an even temporal spacing.

Subject: [Paraview] Segmentation fault when starting ParaView
Message-ID: <22a176bd-6ed5-64e5-bca2-21dd1419bc62@itlr.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hello everyone,

I am running into a strange issue and hope someone can help me:

I'm compiling ParaView 5.2.0 locally on my openSuse 13.1 system (gcc).
Configuring and compiling works just fine. However, as soon as is try to 
execute ParaView, I immediately end up with a segmentation fault.

Running ParaView with gdb shows that the error is somewhere in vtk. I 
attached the backtrace below.
So I started asking around and no one I know ran into this error.
Therefore, I started experimenting and set up a virtual box with 
openSuse 13.1. The strange thing now is, that everything works just fine 
in the virtual environment. No warnings, no seg faults.

I'm grateful for any help you can offer.

Kind regards,
Martin

This sounds like maybe something with your PV config. Try running with the
--dr flag to disable reading in your config file.

Hi Andy,

thanks for your swift reply. Disabling the PV config file resulted in 
another error:
vtkEventQtSlotConnect (0x1a18b10): Cannot connect NULL objects.

However, your remark set me on the right track. The problem was an old 
PV_PLUGIN_PATH variable which pointed to python plugins that I built for 
a different PV version. A simple $ export PV_PLUGIN_PATH="" did the 
trick. Thanks again!

Cheers,
Martin

Glad to hear you're up and running again. Also, glad that you figured out
that saying to use --dr didn't mess you up more. It should have been -dr.

Hi Ken,

Yes, it works properly now. I would follow your suggestion that using 
dt/2 shift to fix this problem for future cases.
Thank you very much for your help.

Best wishes,
Huangrui

Sometimes the time for field.case is ahead, other times the time for geo_stl.pvd is ahead. So, when you play through the time steps, sometimes the data for which you are ignoring time are skipped because the time is first just before one step and then just after another.

Thus, ParaView is treating the numerical imprecision of the different times as unique time steps. If you switch to Sequence or Real Time mode, ParaView uses its own time units and will provide an even temporal spacing.

Yes. The use multi block data set for this. Basically it is a way to group
any  number of atomic dataset types together.

Subject: [Paraview] How to set properties of custom vtkSMProxies (python)?
Message-ID: <CADzkqRE6oU7n6moumjBOgH05NK2y5J76opZEReYhPAkqfD2i4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I'd like to work with custom vtk objects from the ParaView python shell.

Unfortunately, I cannot find in the docs, how to define a property
"MyProperty" in my custom class, that I can access in python using either
myobj.SetMyProperty(<value>) or
myobj.GetProperty("MyProperty").SetElement(0,<value>).

I thought that it was sufficient to have the methods "SetMyProperty" and
"GetMyProperty", in my custom class, which would be wrapped automatically
to create a Property "MyProperty", but it isn't. The class defined below is
wrapped into vtkMyObjectClientServer.cxx during the build process, and it
checks for the method name "Set/GetMyProperty" inside
vtkMyObjectClientServer::vtkMyObjectCommand, but I have no idea how I can
modify these server side property values from the python shell on the
client?

What I have done:
1. define class in vtkMyObject.h:
#ifndef __vtkMyObject_h
#define __vtkMyObject_h
#include "vtkObject.h"
class vtkMyObject : public vtkObject
{
  public:
    static vtkMyObject *New();
    vtkTypeMacro(vtkMyObject,vtkObject);
    void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent
indent){this->Superclass::PrintSelf(os, indent);}
    vtkGetMacro(MyProperty,double);
    vtkSetMacro(MyProperty,double);
  private:
    double MyProperty;
    ~vtkMyObject(){}
    vtkMyObject(){}
};
#endif

2. vtkMyObject.cxx:
#include "vtkMyObject.h"

3. CMakeLists.txt:
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(
   Example
  "1.0"
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyConfig.xml
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyObject.cxx
 )

4. MyConfig.xml:
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="my">
   <Proxy name="MyObject" class="vtkMyObject"
label="MyObject">
   </Proxy>
 </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

5. create plugin using cmake and make and load it in paraview. Then open
the python shell and execute:
myobj=servermanager.CreateProxy("my","MyObject")
print myobj
prop=myobj.GetProperty("MyProperty")
--> myobj is shown as vtkSMProxy, but prop is None.

Can you explain what I have to change, or point my to the relevant
documentation?
Thanks
Mario

Hi Cory,


Thanks for your advice.
I tried some minimal cases again.

I executed pvserver with 2 CPUs, and generate a wavelet source.
Then I tried to select the points (RTData is >= 100).

The messages on Command Prompt are as follows:

My PV is v5.2.0 on Windows 7/8 64bit, just downloaded from Kitware?s download site.
MPI is Microsoft HPC Pack 2008 R2.

Perhaps the provided binary does not fully support MPI processing?
I should build PV with MPI by myself?

Hi Luigi,


I have the same problem when I display color contours with UNIX Timestamps.

The instant solution is using Calculator filter.
Subtract 1600000 from CellIDs, you may get correct results.

# Of course I want to be fixed the problem about the precision of contour ranges, too.

Thanks Magician, I have been using that workaround so far but it was annoying. At moment I am adding a new scalar in the file containing the localID.

Hello

You must use the mpirun/mpiexec provided by ParaView, not your own.

I think the issue is that vtk doesn't bundle mpi4py on windows like it does
elsewhere,  so this paraview query that internally relies on it won't work
there.

Hi Mathieu,


Thanks for your advice.

I searched the mpirun/mpiexec on my /ParaView folder, but no executable is found.
PV 4.4.0 (provided by Kitware) has mpirun/mpiexec in the /bin folder, but the latest version doesn?t.

Are there additional install options?


Magician

Message-ID: <33006fd3a64847108ef06f5cd802a196@RZJMBX2.jr1.local>

Hi

I am programming a vtk Polydata source on my own. The source is reading a proprietary file which consists of very simple 0 to N polygonal objects with a string identifier. My question is: Where do I specify the number of outputs (RequestInformation?) and where can I tell paraview the string identifier of the polygonal data (when I set number of outputs to 10 in filters constructor I get "Output-0" string in paraview's pipeline browser, I want to specify that string on my own)!

Thanks for help...

Hi Gerald,

To give a name to the different ports of your filter in ParaView, you need
to add some "OutputPort" hints to the definition of your filter's proxy.

<SourceProxy class="..." ...>
...
  <Hints>
    <OutputPort index="0" name="*My Output 0*"/>
    <OutputPort index="1" name="*My Output 1*"/>
    <OutputPort index="2" name="*My Output 2*"/>
     ...
  </Hint>
</SourceProxy>

Best,
Joachim

But here i need to know it at compiletime. The ouputs name is in my file name which differs from input file to input file?

e.g. I want to load a file

myfile.myformat

which has a polydata ?SomeString? and a polydata ?someOtherString? in it.

When my reader applys, there should be 2 outputs with 2 vtkPolyDatas with those strings, is that possible?

Hi Gerald,
To give a name to the different ports of your filter in ParaView, you need to add some "OutputPort" hints to the definition of your filter's proxy.
<SourceProxy class="..." ...>
...
  <Hints>
    <OutputPort index="0" name="My Output 0"/>
    <OutputPort index="1" name="My Output 1"/>
    <OutputPort index="2" name="My Output 2"/>
     ...
  </Hint>
</SourceProxy>
Best,
Joachim

Hi

I am programming a vtk Polydata source on my own. The source is reading a proprietary file which consists of very simple 0 to N polygonal objects with a string identifier. My question is: Where do I specify the number of outputs (RequestInformation?) and where can I tell paraview the string identifier of the polygonal data (when I set number of outputs to 10 in filters constructor I get ?Output-0? string in paraview?s pipeline browser, I want to specify that string on my own)!

Thanks for help?

Unfortunately it is not possible.
You could however have a single multiblock outpout port that would contains
your meshes and set the name of each block with the name you read in your
file.
Eg:

  vtkPolyData* polyData[10];
  std::string polyDataName[10];
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    mb->SetBlock(i, polydata[i]);
    mb->GetMetaData(i)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
polyDataName[i].c_str());
  }

Subject: [Paraview] Convert Large CGNS Dataset to numpy
Message-ID: <CANijUir90a8vBbF2bus0EBQ9qSWRGu+jYJYud38_kvyY87t7Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have some CGNS files I want to "convert" to numpy array. To write my
script I first use a more direct method :

   - Converting CGNS to VTK
   - Use vtk_to_numpy method
   - process numpy array

This task is time consuming and I need a more direct option (if possible).

For this, I tried to use paraview CGNSReader and simple module.

I'm able to convert CGNS data to numpy with small data set (Some MB) with
this approach :







*Case = CGNSSeriesReader(filename)Case.UpdatePipeline()rawData =
servermanager.Fetch(Case)import vtk.numpy_interface.dataset_adapter as dsa#
Wrap the raw data object to access NumPy friendly APIdata =
dsa.WrapDataObject(rawData)*

But as it said her <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting>e
*: **Do not do this if data is large otherwise the client will run out of
memory.*

So, I can I do this without running out of memory ? I don't need to load
all Point Arrays at once.

Is it possible to select just 'Temperature' for example and only one block
? I guess it might be less memory consuming.

Any other ideas ?
Thanks,
Thomas

Mathieu and Magician,

In fact, the ParaView 5.2 Windows binaries do not ship with MPI
executables. They are built to use the Microsoft MPI implementation,
as Magician has tried.

The Find Dialog uses mpi4py for parallel queries, but we don't ship
mpi4py on Windows because we haven't tried building against the
Microsoft MPI and there hasn't been much demand to get it working. In
theory it might be possible.

If you'd like to try building mpi4py against the Microsoft MPI and
report back whether it was easy or difficult, it would be much
appreciated!

Thanks,
Cory

That warning is more for if you've got some very large data set loaded
into a ParaView server running on a large computing resource. If you
call this, it will load all that data onto the client, which may not
have enough RAM to hold the very large data set.

If you are working locally with a data set that the ParaView client
can load, then you shouldn't have any problems with the script above.

> Is it possible to select just 'Temperature' for example and only one block ?
> I guess it might be less memory consuming.

To select just 'Temperature', you should be able to do something like:

Case.PointVariables = ['Temperature']

If you need to, you can add an ExtractBlock to your pipeline:

extractBlock1 = ExtractBlock(Input=Case)
extractBlock1.BlockIndices = [1]

I probably wouldn't do the above unless you try your original script
and run into out-of-memory errors.

HTH,
Cory

?handle win32 exception occurred in paraview.exe?

I have tried the different paraview versions in 5.2 and 5.1. Any advise to help with this problem?

Thanks.

So it might come from something else. Python crashed with a 1.4gb file and
not with a smaller one.

I'm on windows with a 32bits version of python and launching it with
pycharm. I will test on a Linux cluster and/or with a 64bits version.

Thanks for your fast and clear answer !

Subject: [Paraview] fontconfig warnings

Alan,

To follow up on this on the mailing list, ParaView ships with a
version of fontconfig newer than the one on your system. The new
fontconfig complains when it finds certain parts of the old file
format. These are just warnings that shouldn't affect anything.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to quiet these warnings. We'll
need to discuss this further to decide on a course of action.

An issues is reported on the ParaView bug tracker here:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17068

Best,
Cory

For file sizes in the several GB range, you'll definitely want to use
a 64bit version, particularly on Windows.

Thank you, that works.
However, I have modified the method SetMyProperty, so that it performs some
additional logic. Now, the problem is, that I need SetMyProperty to be
called even when setting the same value again. ParaView caches the
property, so that SetMyProperty is only executed when the argument is
different from a previous call. Is it possible to change a flag or
something to force the remote procedure call even if the argument is the
same?

Thanks
Mario

Message-ID: <f7063e2eaf37422080cdb4f736124d48@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

If I have a time series with positions (It's a set of csv files, one time step per file, each file has the same set of points), is there a method of computing the delta position from the current time to the next time and using that as a glyph vector?

Thanks,

Alan

The immediate_update flag that you can set in XML doesn't quite do what you
want and it seems like it may be deprecated soon.

Internally vtkSMProxy::UpdateProperty takes an optional force flag, but I
don't see that exposed anywhere public that won't involve writing some
paraview SM code to use it.

What you might do is add a pure vtkProperty (not vtk*vector property) that
calls some method on your class. Those take no arguments so they always
execute on the server when asked for by the client.

Hi,

Could you pass the -dr flag to paraview.exe when it starts up. This
flag will disable any custom settings you may have set up for previous
versions of ParaView that may be interfering with the current version.
We don't have a list of these settings, but I would like to track down
which settings can lead to crashes if that is indeed the issue.

To start ParaView with the -dr flag, please find the shortcut to
"ParaView 5.2.0", which is probably under something like
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\ParaView
5.2.0-Qt-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit. Right-click on this shortcut and
append to the Target: field the argument "-dr". Double-click the
shortcut to launch ParaView.

Does ParaView crash if you do that?

Thanks,
Cory

Here is what I tried that did stop the warnings.  Hack yes, long term fix no, but it worked.

./paraview |& grep -v Fontconfig

Alan,

To follow up on this on the mailing list, ParaView ships with a version of fontconfig newer than the one on your system. The new fontconfig complains when it finds certain parts of the old file format. These are just warnings that shouldn't affect anything.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to quiet these warnings. We'll need to discuss this further to decide on a course of action.

An issues is reported on the ParaView bug tracker here:

Best,
Cory

Hi,

I followed the instructions given here

Hi Venke,

thank you for your Script.
I modified your Script a little. It is working for me, as long as I have only one view in the layout.
When I have more than one view I can't reproduce the layout. It is possible to read and set the ViewSize. Is there a way to read and define the exact location of a view in a layout?

Here the modified script, in case it helps someone:

rv1=GetActiveView()
ALL=GetSources()

dispProps=list()

for i in range(len(ALL.keys())):
    dispProps.append(GetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[i]))


viewLayout1 = GetLayout()
#viewLayout1.SplitHorizontal(0, 0.5)

viewLayout2 = CreateLayout()

rv2=CreateView('RenderView')

SetActiveView(rv2)

propNameList=['Visibility', 'Color', 'LookupTable', 'DiffuseColor', 'Scale', 'Representation', 'Texture', 'Opacity','Origin','Position','ScaleFactor']

for j in range(len(ALL.keys())):

    SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],ColorArrayName=dispProps[j].ColorArrayName[1])
    for name in propNameList:
        try:
            eval('SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j], ' + name + ' =dispProps[j].' + name + ')')
        except:
            pass



ResetCamera()

Greetings
Tobias

Betreff: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Duplicate Layouts

Hi Tobias

You could get the DisplayProperties of all your objects and then set them
accordingly in the new render window using the Python Shell. I have written a
short script for myself for this task --- however something is not quite
correct, as strange colorings sometimes appear after turning the model in the
second view. It can be fixed by making that object invisible and visible again,
but still.... Maybe someone more experienced can correct my answer in that
respect or has a better idea to tackle this problem...?

Here is my code:

rv1=GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
ALL=GetSources()

dispProps=list()
for i in range(len(ALL.keys())):
        dispProps.append(GetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[i]))

viewLayout1 = GetLayout()
viewLayout1.SplitHorizontal(0, 0.5)

rv2=CreateView('RenderView')
viewLayout1.AssignView(2, rv2)

SetActiveView(rv2)

for j in range(len(ALL.keys())):
        SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Visibility=dispProps[j].Visibility)

SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],ColorArrayName=dispProps[j].ColorArrayName[1])
        SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],LookupTable=dispProps[j].LookupTable)
        SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],DiffuseColor=dispProps[j].DiffuseColor)
        SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Scale=dispProps[j].Scale)

SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Representation=dispProps[j].Representation)
        SetDisplayProperties(ALL.values()[j],Texture=dispProps[j].Texture)



Cheers
Venke

Hi Tobias

Thanks for your feedback. I will use your modifications the next time when I
need this.

rv1.ViewSize will hold the size of the first RenderView. But I think it doesn't
affect the size of the render window, only the view itself. Maybe this is still
helpful to you. I haven't done anything with more than two windows yet.

Cheers
Venke

Thanks for trying with the -dr option. Grrr, Windows error messages
are not terribly helpful.

We do test ParaView nightly on Windows 7 64-bit and it runs fine. Does
any version of ParaView run on the system in question? Do you have
another Windows 7 machine on which to try it?

Another wild guess - you may have to temporarily disable anti-virus
software when installing 5.2.

Debopam,

I just tried what you ran on Windows 10 and it ran fine for me. One
thing I had to fix, which I doubt is the cause of your crash, is the
data argument is actually just --data and not --data-dir.

We've had some other reports of 5.2 crashing on start up on Windows.
Did 5.1 run fine for you?

I wonder if you could try installing ParaView 4.4 from
http://www.paraview.org/download/ to see if it runs. If it does, that
gives me a clue on where to look.

Thanks,
Cory

Correction: I could run ParaViewWeb on Windows 10, but I couldn't load
data through the web client. I didn't get pvpython.exe to crash,
though.

Cory you need to provide an absolute path as argument "c:\.....".

But the issue seems to be on ParaView itself. The (Qt) executable crash at
startup on there machine, regardless of their goal to use ParaViewWeb down
the road.

Subject: [Paraview] Invoke remote procedure from proxy with argument and
	return value
Message-ID: <CADzkqRGsqG88jMPOmOr9paRTXeHFOWzw47eqpM9Q5abhu6GUxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have a use case, where a vtkObject on the server implements a method like

std::string doSomething(std::string arg);

Now, with a proxy prx on the client for  that class, I would like to call
the remote procedure similar to

result=prx.InvokeCommand("doSomething",[arg])

Is something like this possible?
I found a very complicated workaround by first defining the arguments as
properties, defining the result as information_only property linked to on
of the args, then calling "UpdateVTKObjects" to push the arguments and
finally "UpdateInformationProperties" to pull the result. Is there an
easier solution, possible with a short example?

Thank you
Mario

Message-ID: <CAOO6v073V5dOJ6UjxwU1QPBTOVZPH9qReVUnpR8GSZA-pMDhcA@mail.gmail.com>

I am attempting to save an animation of particles traversing a fluid field
by either saving a series of images or through the .avi format directly.
Either way, my animation save freezes at 10% complete every time. I have
successfully saved the data for every time step from the ParticleTracer
filter, but cannot manage to save the animation.

Any information will be helpful.

Hi Cory,

I tried to run Paraview 5.1.2, but it gives the same error. However, I was
able to run Paraview 4.1 successfully on Window 10.

But ParaviewWeb failed to run as it seems that version 4.1 does not have
the python script used for running ParaviewWeb.



Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Hi Depobam,

Thanks for trying out the other ParaView versions. I suspect there
might be a problem with the new OpenGL backend on your system as that
has changed between ParaView 4 and 5. What kind of graphics card do
you have on your system. You can get some of the display properties by
going to

Settings -> System -> Display -> Advanced display settings -> Display
adapter properties

Ken,

Are there any things Depobam can do on his Windows 10 system to help
diagnose whether the OpenGL2 backend is causing the crash he is seeing
in ParaView?

Thanks,
Cory

Message-ID: <CANXz0SaNvh=F193BuQQh470UqYfetbaH9SyGn4sN6kBdQMnphQ@mail.gmail.com>

There is a new VR version of ParaView based on the 5.2.0 release available
at www.paraview.org/download under 5.2/Experimental Demos.  In addition to
all the 5.2 paraview changes it includes:

- big performance fix where the VR rendering was being held up by Vsync
limits on the screen window
- performance fix when grabbing and moving objects in paraview VR
- a few other small performance optimizations to improve tracking accuracy
and reduce latency

Thanks
Ken

Hello

I have a custom filter that reads data with vtk exodus reader. I don't
understand how to display information about blocks(like using paraview
reader). I tried to add SILDomain from readers.xml but it doesn't work.

Is it possible to implement this using custom filters or should I write my
own reader based exodus?

Best Regards,

I don't know what happened with the pvpython. I have a complete

can be imported from the bash coming along with the installation.

Thank you!

Hello ParaView World,


 I'm working on a project that uses extensively the concept of "scene graph" where a modification on a parent node is propagated to children nodes. The scene consists of relatively big number of objects. For example, I want that when applying a rotation to the root node, the rotation is perceived by all the children.


 I tried using the pipeline architecture of paraview with the transform filter. Unfortunately, it appears that this causes a huge problem of performance.


 My idea was to use the transforming parameters in the advanced panel that appears to apply the modifications almost instantly. The problem with that is that transformations are not perceived by children nodes. Correct me if I'm wrong but, I think that those transformations are applied to vtkActors associated with the objects and not the objects data.


 So my question is : Is there a way to propagate the transformations to children nodes efficiently?


Best regards,

Mohamed Anis Bouriga.

Message-ID: <e366bf29-3117-cd97-c094-aa92a4899a16@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am using allinputsgridwriter.py to write data that are coming from 
co-processing. The problem is that the result file does not contain all 
the fields. The adaptor code sends two fields but the written file has 
only single field (the first one). The same adaptor code and 
allinputsgridwriter.py script generate desired output with an other 
model code. So, i think that the adaptor and allinputsgridwriter.py are 
fine. There must be a problem in the model code but i could not find it. 
At this point, i just wonder which part of code could cause the problem. 
Can you suggest me any particular key point that i need to focus?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CAC-oNP6WWSpwiEpX6OzDQOFNDPa=p=LnQ6TETSzDFn7AZzYc8g@mail.gmail.com>

Paraview community,

I am trying to batch process CFD results for aero-optic analysis. My plan
is to create a series of PlotOverLine interpolations between the sensor and
farfield boundary, and then use the data along that ray to do the
aero-optic calculations. I will be using pvbatch since I have no need to
visualize any step of the process.

What is the best way to extract the data arrays (preferably only the arrays
I need, by name), from the PlotOverLine object? For example, I can call "
plotOverLine1.PointData['Density'].GetRange()" to get the min and max of
the Density array, but I want the whole array.

Thank you,

Ben Orr

Stefan,

I am testing out 5.2.0 with offscreen rendering and have observed similar
results.  My version built with OpenGL2 is slightly faster than the OpenGL
version for non surface LIC operations, but massively slower when using
Surface LIC.

Comparing back to version 4.4.0, version 5.2.0 with OpenGL2 is faster for
non-Surface LIC operations but much slower for surface LIC.  In fact when
using Surface LIC, version 4.4.0 is faster then 5.2.0 with OpenGL.

My test case involves creating a slice in an unstructured dataset and
sweeping this slice in one direction taking multiple snapshots.

Hopefully someone more knowledgeable on this subject than me has some ideas
on the problem and how to address it.

-Andy

Are the fields uniquely named? That would be my first guess. Other than
that, what are the names of the fields? Some names are specially handled in
which case they may be hidden in the  ParaView GUI.

I have not had time to look into this, but my quick guess is that you have
a multiblock dataset with a lot of blocks. Can you try merging the blocks
all together somehow into one block and see if the rendering speed improves?

Thanks for your help Andy. No. Their names are "tsfc" and "psfc". In this
case, I have only one input port and two fields. I could also try to test
with different fields but I could do it on Monday when I have access to
server.

You can use the Assign Attributes filter to apply the field from one data set to another.

Hi Stephen,

The polyline is separate from the other data after the filter is run, so in
a sense it is already extracted.

If by extract you mean you want to save the data to a file, in the pipeline
browser, select the Contour filter that produces the polyline, then File ->
Save Data... and choose the format to which you want it.

If you mean something else by "extract", please clarify.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Invoke remote procedure from proxy with argument and
	return value
In-Reply-To: <CADzkqRGsqG88jMPOmOr9paRTXeHFOWzw47eqpM9Q5abhu6GUxg@mail.gmail.com>
References: <CADzkqRGsqG88jMPOmOr9paRTXeHFOWzw47eqpM9Q5abhu6GUxg@mail.gmail.com>

Why is it so complicated to call a procedure and receive a return value on
the client?

I am attaching my attempt (CMakeLists.txt, vtkSquareFun.cxx, vtkSquareFun.h
and TestPlugin.xml, each less than 20 lines of code), which basically
calculates the square of an argument in vtkSquareFun::eval(double x).

When I load this plugin in Paraview and open the Python Shell, I can
evaluate vtkSquareFun::eval() using a detour by first setting the argument
and then getting the result, which is linked to the argument property in
TestPlugin.xml:

fun=servermanager.CreateProxy("test","SquareFun")
fun.GetProperty("Arg").SetElement(0,999)
fun.UpdateVTKObjects()
fun.UpdatePropertyInformation()
fun.GetProperty("Result").GetElement(0)
... showing the correct result 998001.

Why can't I simply run the following?
fun=servermanager.CreateProxy("test","SquareFun")
result=fun.InvokeCommand("eval",[999.0])

Does Paraview really not provide any means of calling a function with
arguments and return value within a single client-server communication? All
these individual message transfers are a bottleneck in our application.
Does the Paraview architecture exclude more universal remote procedure
calls, or do you think that one could just augment the available procedures
with another procedure that can deliver a set of custom return values?

Thanks
Mario

Dear Ben,

 

Your data reside on the server side of ParaView, so you can't access it
through ParaView proxies (like plotOverLine). Proxies only let you access
some info about the data, like min and max.

You have two options to access the whole array :

- fetch  the data from the server to the client using servermanager.Fetch
(this may be computationally costly depending on the size of the data) ;

- or access the data on the server side using a programmable filter.

 

HTH,

Jean-Michel

Hi Andy,

I tested code with different variable names but the result is same. I 
also tried to get index of added array by using following call

int i = dataSet->GetPointData()->AddArray(field);

but the returned value "i" is always zero for all the variables. I think 
that this affects the number of fields that are written to the file. By 
the way, i print out the value of 
dataSet->GetPointData()->GetNumberOfArrays() and it returns always 1. 
So, somehow i am missing something but i could not find. The part of the 
code that is responsible to add array is

   template<GridType gridType>
   void Grid<gridType>::SetAttributeValue(vtkCPDataDescription* 
coprocessorData, double* data, const char* vname, const char* pname, 
int* size, int* mpiSize, int* mpiRank) {
     //
     // Get grid
     //
     vtkCPInputDataDescription* idd = 
coprocessorData->GetInputDescriptionByName(pname);
     vtkMultiBlockDataSet *grid = 
vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(idd->GetGrid());
     if (!grid) {
       vtkGenericWarningMacro("No adaptor grid to attach field data to.");
       return;
     }

     //
     // Create dataset and fill with input data
     //
     vtkMultiPieceDataSet *multiPiece = 
vtkMultiPieceDataSet::SafeDownCast(grid->GetBlock(0));
     vtkDataSet *dataSet = 
vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(multiPiece->GetPiece(*mpiRank));

     if (idd->IsFieldNeeded(vname)) {
       //std::cout << "update variable " << vname << " " << 
coprocessorData->GetTime() << std::endl;
       vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray> field = 
vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>::New();
       field->SetName(vname);
       field->SetNumberOfComponents(1);

       //field->SetArray(data, *size, 1);
       field->SetNumberOfValues(*size);
       for (int i = 0; i < *size; i++) {
         field->SetValue(i, data[i]);
       }

       int i = dataSet->GetPointData()->AddArray(field);
       std::cout << *mpiRank << " " << vname << " " << i << " " << 
dataSet->GetPointData()->GetNumberOfArrays() << std::endl;
     }
   }

Any chance that you have a different grid that you're adding the field to?
What happens if you print out the number of point data arrays before you
add the grid?

Ben,

Try

polydata = paraview.servermanager.Fetch(plotOverLine1)
density_array = polydata.GetPointData().GetArray('Density')

paraview.servermanager.Fetch retrieves the entire data object so that
you can access the array you want.

Best,
Cory

Mohamed,

You should do this with "Group Datasets". Group your children nodes
together, then apply a Transform filter to the group. You can further
group the Transform filters to apply additional rotations to the
higher level grouping as you would expect in a scene graph.

This won't be as efficient as applying a transform at every scene
graph level in the GPU, for example, but it should provide you some
basic scene graph capabilities.

HTH,
Cory

Ken,

You are correct in your assumption about my dataset; it is multiblock
unstructured data.  Adding a MergeBlocks filter to my slice does improve
the 5.2.0 with OpenGL2 significantly.
With that change the performance of 5.2.0 with OpenGL2 is on the same order
of magnitude as 5.2.0 with OpenGL and with 4.4.0, though the 5.2.0 variants
are still slower than 4.4.0.

I realized after posting that my comparison is not exactly apples to apples
- my build of 5.2.0 required updates to mesa (13.0.0) compared with the
version I used for 4.4.0 (11.2.0).
I will recompile 4.4.0 with the same mesa version I used with 5.2.0 and
report back.

Thank you for your input.

-Andy

Hi Andy,

Thanks for the clue. Actually, the code was creating the underlying grid 
multiple times with the same name. It basically overwrites the grid 
every time step and then i think that adaptor code lost the reference 
for the grid (even if it is the same name) and assumes that it is a new 
one and shows the single field that is attached to it. Anyway, there was 
a bug in the piece of model code that controls the grid is defined or 
not? So, i fixed it now and i could see the all the variables as 
expected. Thanks for your great help. Sometimes, i could lost in the 
code :) and it makes hard to debug. Anyway, thanks again.

Regards,

--ufuk

Hi everyboby

I tried to create the trace of some steady heavy rendering staff and I 
used the Interpolate Camera Locations for the animation but the trace 
failed, i.e it is not recording the different views ! I really prefer 
the Interpolate Camera Locations way.
Someone can give me some hints to fix it.

thank you very much

Mario,

Firstly, there's no way from Python to do what you want to do except
using the property mechanism, since well, the goal with ParaView was
not to provide a general purpose RPC framework. In C++, you can do
that you want as follows:

vtkSMProxy* proxy = ...
std::string arg = ...;
vtkClientServerStream stream;
stream << vtkClientServerStream::Invoke
            << VTKOBJECT(proxy)
            << "doSomething" << arg.c_str()
            << vtkClientServerStream::End;

vtkSMSession* session = proxy->GetSession();
session->ExecuteStream(
   /*location*/ proxy->GetLocation(),
  /* ignore_errores*/ false);

vtkClientServerStream result = session->GetLastResult(proxy->GetLocation());
if (result.GetNumberOfMessages() == 1 && result.GetNumberOfArguments(0) == 1)
{
   std:string aresult;
  result.GetArgument(0, 0, &aresult);
}

Subject: [Paraview] How to map point cloud data to surface
Message-ID: <140e94fa-ec65-443a-a135-5b71abb34bfa@Spark>

Hi I am not sure it is possible.
I am doing sloshing tank simulation.
Pressure is sampled in probe points on the wall and the data is point cloud with pressure value.
Point cloud itself is not good to visualize pressure distribution. so I want to map the point data onto tank surface and visualize pressure using surface representation.

This will be a two step process.

1. Use  "Point Interpolation" to interpolate point cloud to a 3D
volume (https://blog.kitware.com/point-and-smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics-sph-interpolation-in-paraview/)
2. Use the "Resample To DataSet" filter to resample the 3D volume on
to the surface of interest
(https://blog.kitware.com/dataset-resampling-filters/)

Subject: [Paraview] time series error with EnSight format
Message-ID: <CAC-oNP6unWmCxAWc2w6eAYVFQWebkXTZMvmybAr5buzCy5Tt9A@mail.gmail.com>

When I open a time series of EnSight files, the file-open browser shows
that it intends to open the whole series, and then names the node in the
pipline with the "*" notation. However, the "Case File Name" does not get
the "*", and if I add it, I get the following error (sensitive path names
replaced with XXX):

I have tried paraview versions 5.0.1 and 5.1.2, both 32 and 64 bit, and get
the same error. My ensight files are named "ensight.var.time". For example,
"ensight.case.0001", "ensight.case.0002", ... and "ensight.Desity.0001",
"ensight.Density.0002", ... I can open any given timestep by itself with no
error.


Is this an error in the ensight reader, or am I doing something wrong?


Thank you,

Dear All,

this year we made our Christmas Cards with ParaView.  ;-)
Except for the text and the logos, this image was created solely using 
ParaView 5.2 and OSPRay. It shows liquid cloud water as clouds and 
streamtubes visualizing wind velocity. Thank you all for making such a 
superb piece of software! I hope that you all have some deserved time 
off during the holiday season.

If someone is interested in the data, it is -- except for Santa of 
course -- part of the 2017 IEEE SciVis contest and can be downloaded 
here:   https://www.dkrz.de/SciVis

Merry Christmas,
Niklas

Yeah, it isn't a full Python; I had tried stripping it down, but that
turns out to have been a bad decision. 5.2.1 will have a complete
Python.

Message-ID: <CAOJY6rf7NWi+jYYzLuohrbaOpX9hLVVzu5rVM8j9K4NwZy9cTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Some time ago I wrote a script that took active representation and its
client side object and the return value was vtkPVCompositeRepresentation but
now it is vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm . Is it possible to get representation
again instead of algorithm?

Thanks

Rustem,

The client-side object is still a vtkPVCompositeRepresentation:

r = GetRepresentation()
print(r.GetClientSideObject().GetClassName())

produces vtkPVCompositeRepresentation.

HTH,
Cory

Thank you for your kind reply, Utkarsh.
The C++ example clarifies many of the details that I couldn't find
explained anywhere.

I will try to wrap the missing parts in python, because we can't afford to
migrate the rest of our application to C++.
Just asking, before I waste my time with a bunch of problems that you know
in advance that cannot be solved: Is there any reason why the steps you
showed cannot be wrapped in python, or has it "just not been done, yet"?

Thanks
Mario

Mario,

You can definitely add a new utility VTK class that wraps this logic
and then wrap it and call that from Python. Don't go about trying to
wrap vtkClientServerStream, however. That may be a dead end.

Yes, It shows up in the spreadsheet view when you switch from to look at
field aligned quantities. You can access the data within the python
programmable filter and recent versions of paraview give you the option of
color mapping the entire block by it.

The not cell or point aligned data that go in the field array collection
tends to be application specific, so it is harder to be specific about how
one utilizes it. The Gaussian Quadrature filter for instance uses
specifically named and formatted entries there to put quantities at
arbitrary points within cells. Other filters do other very specific things
with the data there an they also can impose requirements on it.

Ah, looks like you're using a Python programmable filter. Alas,
currently, it's a bit complicated to do this for a Programmable
filter, it'll need some figuring out on my part. In the mean time,
subclassing Exodus reader may be the easier option.

Subject: [Paraview] building qt via paraview-superbuild on macOS 10.12 still
	fails
Message-ID: <9E79FAAF-30E1-4032-AEBC-38E8D10C8E25@fau.de>

Yesterday qt 5.7.1 was released but I still have issues building qt via pvsb while building qt everywhere manually with the very same configure options just works. 

configuring qt manually results in linker calls like
clang++ -headerpad_max_install_names -stdlib=libc++ -Wl,-syslibroot ?

When I verbose the build out of pvsb the options ?-headerpad_max_install_names -stdlib=libc++? are missing. Adding them manually for the single link case, linking works.

I have no idea why the identical configuring from pvsb/cmake leads to different results on macOS 10.12.

I added the details to https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/issues/29

Any help is very much appreciated,

Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] State File Errors
Message-ID: <CAEOCX7dDoTYudqyUn1RT3+fxPJWu38NO=Q0fDpiHvrM4n1hkJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm new to Paraview, so apologies if my beginner-type questions is too
basic. However, I'm glad there is such a list to send messages to, and I
would be very grateful if someone could help me.

I've installed Paraview 5.0.1 on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS machine (64 bit)
alongside OpenFOAM 4.0. Sometimes I can load .pvsm files, and sometimes
not. The errors I get are errors.txt and the .pvsm file is attached.

I will try and use Python tracing, but I would prefer also to have a saved
state. Any ideas about how I can solve this would be great.

The only non-standard thing I've done was this in
/opt/openfoam4/etc/.bashrc:

# Location of user files - edited
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# export WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR=$HOME/$WM_PROJECT/$USER-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION
export WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR=$HOME/Dropbox/7_OpenFOAM

I'm also creating .openfoam files via:

$ paraFoam -touch

Kind regards,

Andrew

Can confirm that it Alessangro's initial xdmf file fails on windows (crash
is in somewhere in the rendering stack - need a debug build to diagnose
further) but works OK on Linux.

Please submit an issue on the ParaView issue tracker.

some of the time. ;)

If you open it up with the spreadsheet view (so no rendering), you can see
that the cell connectivity array gets nonsense in it - some of the time.
When you then open a renderview and show it, it crashes.

So something about the read in of the connectivity data has an
uninitialized/misaligned word somewhere.

Thanks for trying it out. I do want to fix the compositeLic to be fast as
 well.  It just has to be reworked to use the new always fast
compositePolyDataMapper2 approach.  I hope to get to it early next year.
Just wanted to  let you know.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Subject: Problem setting extents in parallel
	programmable source
Message-ID: <CA+a=0o78iXVM7XGS89wH-YwJd5XVciB8HPf1M=HbHvJpUtasMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I'm writing because after a couple dozen hours I'm still unable to make a
Python Programmable Source that works in more than 1 process. I've been up
and down through the Paraview Guide and spent lots of times googling, but
the only useful posts (and mails from this lists) that seemed useful, used
what I think is a deprecated API (Executive's ExtentTranslator).

I'm trying to read three Fortran unformatted records which contain one
component of a 3-component field each. I've been using Python scripts to
read the data and save it in .vtr format, but is getting tedious and wanted
to just open the files directly from paraview.

This is the code I'm using:

RequestInfo: http://pastebin.com/szqtJbH8
RequestData: http://pastebin.com/pyAZxcN8

I tried using if rank == 0 for all the RequestData() function (except for
the last line setting extents) but that produces segfault on pvserver for
ranks != 0 while (for example) clipping data.

Sorry for bothering here, but I think I've really run out of resources to
read and I still can't grasp it.

Thanks,
Mauro

Sorry you had such trouble. Here is an example you can play with. It generates a Rectilinear Grid, in parallel, on any number of MPI tasks. You set the dims[] array, and ParaView does the splitting.

Tested with 5.2.

Andrew,

Looks like the state file uses some plugin that provides the
`PV4FoamReader` proxy. The errors are reported when the plugin wasn't
loaded before the state file was loaded.

I've done some more debugging on this topic.

The problem is not related only to windows machines: the easy example that
I attached at the beginning of this post (polyhedron.xmf) seems to be
correctly opened on Linux machines, but if you try to reopen it several
times (for example using the new 5.2 feature of "Reload Files"), not very
often but sometimes it gives segfault also on Linux machines. Moreover, if
you try to open a bigger file (with more polyhedra inside) it fails more
often or, sometimes, it seems not to read all the polyhedral cells in the
mesh.

I've tried to investigate the code and I think I've found the reason of
this behaviour, but of course, as I'm not an expert in VTK programming, a
more relevant opinion from the experts in this forum would be appreciated.
The function that builds the VTK topology starting from what has been read
from a xmdf file is vtkXdmf3DataSet::CopyShape in the source file
 vtkXdmf3DataSet.cxx (path superbuild/paraview/src/VTK/IO/Xdmf3/ in the
5.2.0 superbuild building directory). In case of "mixed" XdmfTopologyType
(line 1460 of the file) it creates a vtkCellArray structure named vCells
that at line 1548 is passed to the SetCells function to create the
connectivity information of the DataSet. This vCells structure is filled
through the pointer *cells_ptr that is initially dimensioned with a size
equal to conn_lenght (line 1470) that is the size of the topology array
xTopology that comes form xdmf file reading.
This structure is filled as a sequence of blocks: each block for each cell.
If the cell is not a polyhedron it contains the number of points for that
cell followed by the list of pointID of the vertices. If the cell is a
polyhedron, as it's explained at lines 1531-1534, the cell information is
the sequence of: cell Lenght (that is the size of the following list for
that cell), the number of faces and, for each face, the number of points
and the list of points. So this array is exactly the same of the one that
has been read from the xdmf file, with the substitution of the cell type
for non polyhedral cells with the number of points for that cell, and, with
the substitution of the cell type with the cell lenght for polyhedral cells.

But, after the loop on cells to fill this structure, at line 1547 there is
a call to the function Resize to reduce the Array to an overall lenght
index-sub where index is the original array lenght and sub is the number of
polyhedral cells.

I think that this Resize call il wrong because the array lenght is correct
before this reduction.
If you print the content of the vCell structure after the Resize, for the
example of polyhedron.xmf, the last two elements of the array (that are the
last two nodes of the last hexaedron cell of the mesh) are missing.

Probably when the SetCells function is called at line 1548 with a cell_type
array of the right lenght but a truncated vCells array as the second
argument, the missing elements of vCell array "could" be available  as they
should be next in memory to the truncated array, but this is not guaranteed
because it is randomical and it depends on the operating system (that could
explain the different behaviour between linux and windows).

In any case I've tried to comment the Resize function call and the xmdf
reader has been able to read all the cases that I've tried to read with
polyhedral and not polyhedral 3d cells (there is still a problem with
polygons but I'll write another post on this topic).

As I've said at the beginning of this too much long message, I hope that
VTK/Paraview developers give their opinion about my hypothesis.

Thank you

Alessandro

Subject: [Paraview] Trouble compiling Paraview with off-screen rendering
	with Mesa
Message-ID: <CABu2j5opPOoP-tuqFqysEFPy9CJxFWoJ6dVPz=wcR174k0o9Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying compile paraview-4.4 on opensuse to run as a server with
off-screen rendering support. As I don't have graphics hardware there I
want to use Mesa for graphics.

I followed instructions on this page,
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D_tmp#ParaView_with_Offscreen_Mesa

 to use Mesa-7.7 I configure Mesa with,

./configure --with-driver=xlib --enable-osmesa --prefix={MESA_INSTALL_PREFIX}

After compiling mesa I tried to compile Paraview but getting following error,

Message-ID: <CAD6x9sPZDo-0W2ees8ioYFZXV-WOYWR6k5sDqtwMWj+YA6+JFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just saw that the paraview superbuild has be greatly refactored. I
wanted to try and give another shot to something that I have been
trying to do for a while now. My goal is to compile a version of
paraview with osmesa enabled such that an HPC code that is
instrumented with Catalyst calls can run on a computer without having
to open up a window to render images.

Has anyone had luck building the superbuild with osmesa on OpenSuse
13.2? I'm trying to put together an appropriate configuration script
that conforms to the new superbuild's style.

Thank you,

Hi Christopher,

While I haven't tested with OpenSuSE, I have been testing extensively with
SLES12.2 and EL7.   I usually recommend to build a CMake cache file to
encode the appropriate options used that you can save off as your build's
configuration file.  You can see many current examples in the cmake/sites
directory.  Specifically, the EL7-OSMesa.cmake configuration will likely be
a good place to start for you.  To use it:

# Clone the repo and it's submodules
# The current superbuild master/ branch is pointing to the ParaView 5.2.0
release
git clone https;//gitlab./kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild.git
source
cd source
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Setup the build location
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure
cmake -C /path/to/sb-source/cmake/sites/EL7-OSMesa.cmake /path/to/sb-source

# Build
make

# Install
make install

In your case specifically, you'll want to add the following to the config
file:

set(ENABLE_paraviewsdk ON CACHE "")

This will make sure the necessary headers and CMake files get packaged for
using Catalyst.  This will build with OSMesa enabling both the llvmpipe and
OpenSWR drivers.  Also, instead of a "make install", you can run "ctest -R
cpack-paraviewsdk-TGZ" which will generate a tarball that you can "install"
by extracting wherever you want it to end up.

We're still working on getting good HowTo docs for the Superbuild, which
has been challenging because many different users tend to use it in many
different ways.  I hope this helps give you a good place to start though.

With 5.2.0, you also have the option of building with EGL which will let
you directly render on your NVidia GPU w/o an x11 server, vs using OSMesa
for CPU based rendering.

That is a 32 bit error, from trying to index something with more than
(2^32)/2 elements or indices. Are you using any custom
libraries/packages/modules which might not be 64 bit compliant? Are
you sure you built a 64 bit version (check your gcc -v).

Chuck and Ken,

I really appreciate you both following up with me.  I will have some time
this week to update my osmesa builds for a proper 4.4.0 vs 5.2.0 comparison
and I will try out the EGL option; I honestly forgot that it was available.

Hopefully I will have more to report back soon.

Thanks,
Andy

There are two parts to this issue. The first is that that
vtkMPICommunicator for PV 4.3.1 won't communicate data that is over 2^31
bytes of data. This is fixed in PV 5.2. The other issue is due to MPI
having a limit of 2^31 objects to be communicated in a single shot. This is
MPI's API in that the count for objects that are typically sent/received is
an int. See  http://www.mpich.org/static/docs/v3.1/www3/MPI_Send.html for
example.

Thank you for the suggestions Chuck,

I tried the configuration: EL7-OSMesa.cmake  with the edit that you
suggested.

It first failed when I ran: cmake -C
../paraview-superbuild/cmake/sites/EL7-OSMesa.cmake  ../paraview-superbuild/

The error was:








*CMake Error at superbuild/cmake/SuperbuildRevisionMacros.cmake:339
(message):  The 5.2.0-RC4 source selection for paraview does not exist.Call
Stack (most recent call first):  versions.cmake:60
(superbuild_set_selectable_source)  superbuild/CMakeLists.txt:96
(include)-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!*

I took at a look at the EL7-OSMesa.cmake file and it looks like there is a
hardcoded paraview version in there. The option:
set(paraview_SOURCE_SELECTION 5.2.0-RC4 CACHE BOOL "") . I changed it from
5.2.0-RC4 to 5.2.0 and the configuration continued on until it hit another
failure. I changed set(ENABLE_paraviewsdk ON CACHE "")  to
 set(ENABLE_paraviewsdk ON CACHE BOOL "") [note the BOOL], and that seemed
to fix the issue.


Upon doing 'make' the compilation failed in the HDF5 stage with the
following error.














*CMakeFiles/Makefile2:127: recipe for target 'src/CMakeFiles/hdf5.dir/all'
failedgmake[4]: *** [src/CMakeFiles/hdf5.dir/all] Error 2Makefile:149:

'all' failedmake: *** [all] Error 2*

I'm unsure about how to resolve the failure. I am using cmake-3.6. There is
a version of hdf5 already installed on the system( which h5dump gives:
/usr/lib64/mpi/gcc/openmpi/bin/h5dump ).

Have you ever had issues with the hdf5 compilation of the superbuild?

Thank you,

Hi,

I have a volume that looks fine inside Paraview when I set the mode to surface. However, there is no option to save the model as a standard 3D model file format. .obj, .ply, .fbx, 3ds etc. If I add glyphs I can export the glyphs just fine as a .ply file, but for some reason that is not available for the surface.

Is it possible to get a geometric model of the surface exported to a "proper" geometric 3D model format?

Yours,
Magnus Elden

Setting ENABLE_foo to ON turn on a sub-project, defaulting to building our
own version.  Setting USE_SYSTEM_foo to ON will override that default and
use a system version instead.  In your case, you'll want to also set
USE_SYSTEM_hdf5 to ON.  Given your particular configuration and which
packages you have installed, set ENABLE_foo and USE_SYSTEM_foo
accordingly.  Using the cache file is functionally equivalent to:

cmake -DENABLE_foo=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_foo=ON [more cmake options]...

The cache file works by pre-loading the settings.  You can also pass
additional options on the command line as cmake -D flags to override or
supplement the cache script settings.  When trying to work out the settings
you want to use, it may be easiest to iterate with -D flags on the command
line until you get it just how you want it and then translate those into a
site-specific cache script that you can keep around.

Subject: [Paraview] Export the surface model in a format that can be

Magnus,

The Surface mode, or "representation", in ParaView displays just the
surface extracted from the underlying volume. Underneath, it is still
a volumetric dataset, so ParaView does not present surface data
writers when you try to save it to a file. The representation is just
the way the underlying data is displayed - you wouldn't be saving just
the edges if you saved the data when the Wireframe mode is chosen, for
instance.

To enable saving it as a surface, you must first extract the surfaces
from the volume using a filter such as Extract Surface. The display in
Surface mode will look exactly the same, but the underlying data in
the output of this filter *is* actually a surface. When you save it
from ParaView, you will have the expected writers from which to
choose.

The Glyph filter produces surface data, hence you get the expected
surface options available for the file format.

HTH,
Cory

I've been slowly moving from v4 to v5. Is programmable filter gone? I
use to do  a lot of operations like;

 data_0 = inputs[0].CellData['data']
 data_1 = inputs[1].CellData['data']
 output.CellData.append(data_1 - data_0, 'difference')

or more complicated then simple differencing, e.g.;

 data_0 = inputs[0].CellData['data']
 data_1 = inputs[1].CellData['data']

tmp1=A * data_0^3 + B * data_0^2 + C * data_0^3

etc...

can anyone point me to where its documented how to do this now (and
please dont just say pytrhon calculator).

thanks!

Programmable Filter is not gone, it's still around, alive and well. It's
under Filters | Data Analysis menu, as before. If you're not seeing it
there, make sure your ParaView build is built with Python support enabled.

Thanks again Chuck. I would prefer to have the superbuild compile its own
hdf5 to eliminate any possibility of errors on my side. When I use the
'ENABLE_hdf5' option in the cache file there still appears to be an issue
with the compilation in the hdf5 area.

I got the same error when I used my version of hdf5(also 1.8.13), so I'm
trying to understand what the make utility is trying to tell me the trouble
it is having on my OpenSuse system. I've also attached the cache file that
I'm feeding to Cmake.

Thank you,

Besides what others said here, I am curious why ParaView is trying to move

gather and deliver the entire dataset to the client. Which in itself would
be a problem with data this size. What operation leads to this error?

Subject: [Paraview] color mapping of XDMF and HDF5 file is not shown
Message-ID: <c61f74db-98b1-ef72-f49f-8a4ce1dbf6b7@gmail.com>

Hi,


I am woking with HDF5 and XDMF file to visualize in ParaView.

three problems are found in reading xdmf reader.

1) in MS Windows, color map is shown correctly but in Linux, color map 
is gone and nothing is shown but grid surface.

2) in Linux (not sure in Windows), Paraview 5.1.2 has problem in reading 
attribute data

3) xdmf3 reader cannot read my xdmf file. which part should I correct in 
order for xdmf3 reader working


Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] plugins with 5.2
Message-ID: <956770b0-b7f3-2931-622d-df0abdbe5aa5@gmail.com>

After upgrading to 5.2 my plugin is not compiling. When I configure the 
plugin I see a few pages of the following:

    CMake Warning (dev) at io/CMakeLists.txt:54 (add_library):
       Policy CMP0028 is not set: Double colon in target name means ALIAS or
       IMPORTED target.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0028" for policy
    details.
       Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
    warning.

       Target "teca_io" links to target "Qt4::QtCore" but the target was not
       found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED
    target, or
       an ALIAS target is missing?
    This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

then linker errors

    [ 32%] Linking CXX shared library ../lib/libteca_io.so
    /bin/ld: cannot find -lQt4::QtCore
    /bin/ld: cannot find -lQt4::QtGui

    make[1]: *** [io/CMakeFiles/teca_io.dir/all] Error 2
    Makefile:127: recipe for target 'all' failed
    make: *** [all] Error 2

It's not a library so I set  the policy to new,  and the cmake configure 
errors out. Any idea what's missing?

Looked into this. There are two errors going on.

1: The type should be "Float" not "Double" Xdmf defines double as float with precision 8.

2: There is an order of operations error in the handling of the X_Y_Z type. We'll put a fix for it into the next Xdmf3 reader.

Magician,

I am transitioning this thread over to the ParaView users mailing list
as you are using pvpython, and this is actually simpler to do using
the paraview.simple module rather than with VTK directly.

What you are trying to do is not going to work with pvpython. pvpython
is a client that you can use with either the built-in server or by
connecting to a remote server, much like the ParaView application. You
won't be able to run it in parallel and run parallel VTK code with it.

Instead, you will need to invoke pvpython with a script that connects
to a running pvserver with 2 processors.

Here's something that worked for me for partitioning a point source:

* Launch pvserver with two processes (mpirun -np 2 pvserver)
* Launch pvpython script.py
* The contents of script.py should be:

from paraview.simple import *

Connect("localhost")

pointSource = PointSource()
pointSource.NumberOfPoints = 10000
pointSource.Radius = 1.0

glyph = Glyph(Input=pointSource, GlyphType='Arrow')
glyph.GlyphType = '2D Glyph'
glyph.GlyphType.GlyphType = 'Vertex'
glyph.GlyphMode = 'All Points'

d3 = D3(Input=glyph)

SaveData('tmp.pvtu', proxy=d3)

The Glyph filter is needed to add vertex cells at each point. D3 needs
these cells to do the partitioning properly.

Can you get this script to work?

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] moving streamlines with flow
Message-ID: <936df9e4-c529-8f18-9051-ffafc176304d@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am running simulations of magnetized plasma flow through a 
computational domain. In the simulation the magnetic field lines are 
moving with the flow. When generating an animation over different time 
steps (frames), however, the streamtracer uses the same seeds for each 
frame, and hence the resulting impression is that the field lines do not 
move in time.

Would anybody have an idea on how to accomplish moving field lines?

Thank you!

Jan

I have tested color map problem a little.
Problem is due to the field value at initial time.
Initial value of field of the time series is zero.
I guess the behavior for the zero field is dependent on os. In MS windows, mapping data is visible in color map editor but in Linux mapping data for the initial time is gone until I remap the data after time marching

Subject: [Paraview] git question on paraview-superbuild master
Message-ID: <f0a0f15b-a277-6221-fed5-dc15ea8a4e55@fau.de>

I have a question, which is probably related to my lack of experience 
with git:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/common-superbuild/blob/master/versions.cmake

contains the line
set(qt5_ver "${qt5_ver_series}.1")

However, when I follow 
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/ and do

git clone --recursive 
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild.git
cd paraview-superbuild
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git submodule update

I get with
grep qt5_ver_series superbuild/versions.cmake
the old content
set(qt5_ver "${qt5_ver_series}.0")

However, when I do
cd superbuild
git checkout master

it works:
set(qt5_ver "${qt5_ver_series}.1")

Do I miss something?
Does the checkout always be repeated in superbuild? Then I request to 
change
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/

What is the relationship of paraview-superbuild and common-superbuild?

Thanks,

Fabian

Jan,

Do you have a sample dataset to share? It'll be easier for me to try a few
things locally before suggesting what could work.

Jan,

This will straddle the boundary of ParaView and Plasma Physics: first, this is a good lesson in the non-reality of the ?frozen-in? condition for field lines ? they are just integral lines and something to always keep in mind; second, I think you would have to specify your own list of seed points and have them advect with the plasma over each time step. You would have to use a zero radius and one streamline from each ? otherwise you would get something different each time that wouldn?t look frozen-in.

Subject: [Paraview] moving streamlines with flow

Hello,

I am running simulations of magnetized plasma flow through a
computational domain. In the simulation the magnetic field lines are
moving with the flow. When generating an animation over different time
steps (frames), however, the streamtracer uses the same seeds for each
frame, and hence the resulting impression is that the field lines do not
move in time.

Would anybody have an idea on how to accomplish moving field lines?

Thank you!

If you want the seeds to move my suggestion would be to use a programmable
source that generates those seeds and then use the Stream Tracer With
Custom Source filter. This does require knowing the how the seeds change
with time a priori. If you want the seeds to advect with the flow you could
try the particle path filter to advect the seeds and use that as your input
into the stream tracer with custom source filter. If you do that I'd love
to see the resulting animation -- I'd bet it would be quite spectacular!

Subject: [Paraview] parallel rendering is slower than single process
 rendering and when using D3 filter it becomes much more slower
Message-ID: <292811.898d.1592a3b701a.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hi everyone,

I'm using PavaView rendering a dataset which contains 5,000,000 particles. The output file of each single time step is about 172 MB in size. It takes about 100 seconds to render 9 time steps' data when using a single process,and I think it is large enough to take the advantage of parallel rendering. However, it turns out to take almost the same rendering time of single process rendering when I use "mpirun -np 8 pvserver". The dataset is polydata, so I use D3 filter to redistribute it among the 8 processes. To my disappointment, it takes almost 3 times of the rendering time of single process rendering! I'm sure there are 8 cores in my rendering server, and the remote render threshold is 20 MB. Could you tell me why the parallel rendering is so slow and how I can make it faster? Should'n it be faster than single process rendering? By the way, I'm using ParaView 4.4.0 and the operating system is CentOS 6.3.

The common superbuild is updated via merge requests in
paraview-superbuild; it does not track master automatically. I'll make a
merge request here today.

You can update locally by going into the superbuild/ directory and
checkout out `origin/master`.

D3 is an expensive operation but when the data starts of as a single
partition, there's not a whole lot of other options for re-distributing
it.  When the data is genereated, is it in a single partition or do you
combine it into one before vistualizing?  If it's generated in parallel
then opening the data in it's still-parallel state with ParaView  will let
you avoid the repartitioning and re-distribution step.

To my disappointment, it takes almost 3 times of the rendering time of

The rendering step alone or the combined D3 + rendering?

In general yes, but it depends on a few factors, one of which is the
structure of the input data and how well it's partitioned.  in your case,
it's not partitioned at all and required repartitioning with D3, which is
very expensive.  Are you rendering with a GPU or are you rendering in
software using OSMesa?

By the way, I'm using ParaView 4.4.0 and the operating system is CentOS 6.3.

I would strongly suggest using 5.2 since the newer OpenGL backend used by
5.x is anywhere from 10x to 100x faster for most workloads.  If you're
using CPU based rendering with OSMesa, then you should also look at
building against a new Mesa, i.e 13.0.2 with swr, a high performance
multi-threaded CPU based renderer.

The only way to gain knowledge and experience is by doing.  It will pass
and you'll get more comfortable with the various techniques the more you
use it over time.

5M point's is actually a pretty small dataset that should be easy to handle
from a rendering standpoint, i.e. youshould be fine handling it on a single
node.  Most of your time is likely spent in I/O and data conversion rather
than rendering.  How are you getting your data into ParaView, i.e. what
file format are you using?  There is likely a better way that my address
most of the performance issues you are having and remove the need for
parallel rendering entirely.

If that's the case then you won't have the IO time with Catalyst that youre
seeing with the ParaView application as the data will end up getting passed
directly in memory.

The C2050s should support the fuill OpenGL stack and they will certainly
give you better performance than the CPU based rendering.  Which driver
version are you using (check with the nvidia-smi command)?  If it's new
enough, you may be able to use EGL which would be ideal.

This is a seperate issue and I'd be happy to help you get 5.2 up in
running.  If you'd still like to pursue it, please start a new thread by
posting a message with the actual error you're getting.

Just for some context, I generated 5M random points in a 100x100x100 cube
with a single field data assigned to each point.
CSV File:

   - File size: 177M
   - Read file: 29 sec
   - Convert to points: 0.1 sec

VTK XML (binary encoding of data arrays):

   - File Size: 130M
   - Read File: 1.4 sec.

In both cases, once the file is read, the first frame render time with the
basic on-board Intel graphics card on my laptop is only 0.15 sec with the
subsequent frame render times being 0.04 sec.  You can see from this that
the bulk of the time is spent in file I/O and data conversion, especialy
with using something like CSV.  This was with ParaView 5.2.  With 4.4, the
I/O times are the same but the first-frame render time is much slower: 0.6
sec.  Still much closer to a usable frame rate. than 100 sec.

Message-ID: <17674e8.1bd13.1594548c15a.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hi Chuck, I'm happy you are willing to help me with the problem of ParaView 5.2.0.



Firstly, the operation system on my rendering server is CentOS 6.3 and on my PC it's CentOS 6.8. I think I have built the ParaView 5.2.0 successfully from the source package, because during the processes of configure with CMake and the following make, there was no error. Then I start the pvserver on the rendering server:

[root at V18 bin]# ./pvserver

Waiting for client...

Connection URL: cs://V18:11111

Accepting connection(s): V18:11111

Then I connect to the server with the paraview client GUI on my PC, which is also 5.2.0. It seems that the connection is completed, but actually I get output messages from the GUI immediately like this:




And the command line reads:

ERROR: In /home/buildslave/dashboards/buildbot/paraview-pvbinsdash-linux-shared-release_opengl2_qt4_superbuild/source-paraview/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx, line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x1c9aa20): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.


And this message repeats for dozens of times. Actually they are the same of the output messages on the GUI. Then, 5 or so seconds later, antoher dialog popped up :




For clicking No or Yes, the GUI shutdown or save a file that records the state of ParaView and then shutdown, respectively.


On the command line of the server, it reads:

Client connected.


X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext

    Major opcode of failed request:  135 (GLX)

    Minor opcode of failed request:  5  (X_GLXMakeCurrent)

    Serial number of failed request:  28

    Current serial number in output stream:  28

I googled the error messages above and got many answers indicating that it's a problem about OpenGL. Actually I indeed got confused when I configured ParaView with Cmake.The options of VTK_RENDER_BACKEND:STRING are OpenGL,OpenGL2 and None. I don't no what's the difference between the first two options but the OpenGL version on my server is 4.4.0 and on my PC it's 4.5.0. There are GPUs on both the server and my PC so I didn't use OSMesa.  I have tried both OpenGL and OpenGL2 for that variable, but got the same error finally.

Oddly, the ParaView 4.4.0 works perfectly on the same machine after the same process of configure and make. What the difference is, when I start the 5.2.0 paraview GUI from command line, there are lots of warnings like this:


Fontconfig warning: "/etc/fonts/conf.d/45-latin.conf", line 39: Having multiple <family> in <alias> isn't supported and may not work as expected
Fontconfig warning: "/etc/fonts/conf.d/45-latin.conf", line 56: Having multiple <family> in <alias> isn't supported and may not work as expected

but when I start the 4.4.0 GUI from command line, there is nothing wrong.

These are all the messages I can get about my problem. I'm not sure whether they are the actual error youmentioned in your last email. Hope they can give you enough information about my problem and you could help me solve it. Thank you!

Sincerely

-Zhang

Message-ID: <D4895A09.2F027%Richard.C.Angelini.CIV@mail.mil>

I?ve stumbled onto an issue with the 5.2 Superbuild ? I?ve looked around in
the email archives but didn?t see this problem reported.

I?m building on a generic RHEL6 workstation and I get a successful build,
but the install fails.    It seems to be a simple misconfiguration in the
superbuild/projects/qt4.functions.cmake ?..

The error that I?m seeing is ?Unable to find the sqldrivers/libqsqlite
plugin from QT4 under /home/angel/PV-Build/install/../plugins.    The issue
is that the plugins directory  is in ?install/plugins? not
?install/../plugins?.    If I make that change in qt4.functions.cmake, the
install completes successfully.

(see attached screenshot)

I?m not doing anything in the cmake command to override or change the
installation paths during the build ? or at least I don?t think I am!

I am out this week, so I am not following this thread closely, but it's not clear from the description of your hardware that you are ever going to get an improvement from parallel rendering.

You said you have 8 cores. Are these 8 cores in the same machine? If so, I don't think running in parallel will help with your rendering. Probably all 8 instances of MPI are rendering with the same GPU, which means all the rendering instructions from the parallel job fight with each other to get queued up on the same GPU, which will make the overall rendering slower, not faster.

Somewhere in the thread I thought I read that you have 2 GPUs. Unless you have set up something special, one of them is probably being ignored. Even if you go through the pain of managing to set up a parallel ParaView to use both GPUs, I doubt you will get much if any speed up. The parallel rendering, which was designed for cluster computing, has an overhead; buffers are read back, pixels are transferred, and blending operations are performed. You are unlikely to gain much of that back with only 2 GPUs.

In my case, the dataset consists only of random numbers and it's in a single partition. I will try to generate a dataset in parallel in a few days and render it as you told me.

5M point's is actually a pretty small dataset that should be easy to handle from a rendering standpoint, i.e. you should be fine handling it on a single node.  Most of your time is likely spent in I/O and data conversion rather than rendering.  How are you getting your data into ParaView, i.e. what file format are you using?  There is likely a better way that my address most of the performance issues you are having and remove the need for parallel rendering entirely.

Just for some context, I generated 5M random points in a 100x100x100 cube with a single field data assigned to each point.
CSV File:

  *   File size: 177M
  *   Read file: 29 sec
  *   Convert to points: 0.1 sec

VTK XML (binary encoding of data arrays):

  *   File Size: 130M
  *   Read File: 1.4 sec.

In both cases, once the file is read, the first frame render time with the basic on-board Intel graphics card on my laptop is only 0.15 sec with the subsequent frame render times being 0.04 sec.  You can see from this that the bulk of the time is spent in file I/O and data conversion, especialy with using something like CSV.  This was with ParaView 5.2.  With 4.4, the I/O times are the same but the first-frame render time is much slower: 0.6 sec.  Still much closer to a usable frame rate. than 100 sec.

I suspected as much.  The text output files are easier to look at since you
can open them and visually verify them but they are much more costly to
process.  Binary formats will almost always be more performant.

5M points is a pretty small dataset so I doubt you'd be render bound if you
can use a GPU.  A modern NVidia GPU can easily do several hundred million
triangles / sec.  Even a CPU based render can easily crank out several
million triangles per second.  Moving to 5.2 will help substantially in
render performance.  WRT parallel rendering and Catalyst, if you're code is
MPI based then you'll automatically get parallel rendering since Catalyst
runs in the same process as the simulation code.

A helpful tool in thh ParaView GUI for performing timing is the "Timer Log"
feature.  To use it, open "Tools -> Timer Log", then select [Clear].  Now
do some operation and select [Refresh].  In this case, you can open the
data file, clear the timer, play the series, then refresh the timer.  You
should see something like this:

...

RenderView::Update, 2.37109 seconds

    vtkPVView::Update,  2.37103 seconds

*        Execute vtkFileSeriesReader id: 4778,  1.52852 seconds*

        Execute vtkGeometryRepresentationWithFa,  0.09836 seconds

XMLPolyDataReader::GatherInformation,  0.179643 seconds

*Still Render,  0.626876 seconds*

    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.601433 seconds

RenderView::Update,  2.3188 seconds

    vtkPVView::Update,  2.31873 seconds

*        Execute vtkFileSeriesReader id: 4778,  1.49044 seconds*

        Execute vtkGeometryRepresentationWithFa,  0.097739 seconds

XMLPolyDataReader::GatherInformation,  0.178735 seconds

*Still Render,  0.628595 seconds*

    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.603274 seconds
...


>From this you can see the vtkFileSeriesReader times, which is how long it
takes to read the data file, and the "Still Render" time, which is how long
it takes to actually render the dataset.  From this you should be able to
see the substantially improves render times in 5.2 vs 4.4

Ken is also right, however, in that parallel rendering is not likely to
help with a dataset this size.  It's worth the experiment to get it set up
to enable you to use it for larger datasets but the overhead on a single
machine may still not give you any speed up.

This is an indication that pvserver is not able to access an X server.  How
are you starting pvserver?  Is it over ssh, vnc, running it directly from
the server's console, etc?  Does glxinfo work?  i.e. what's your output
from "glxinfo | grep OpenGL"? In order to access the GPUs you'll either
need to use a running X server or EGL, depending on the NVidia driver
version.  What version fo the NVidia driver are you using?  eg:

This is certainly a confusing option.  It's not actually referring the the
version of OpenGL that's getting used but the version of VTK's OpenGL
backend.  The OpenGL backend is the first generation of our renbdering
backend and uses OpenGL v1.2.  The OpenGL2 backend is the second generation
of our rendering backend and uses OpenGL v3.3.

These are an artifact of ParaView 5.2 using a newer fontconfig library than
the system.  For reasons outside of the scope here,  it's not likely to get
fixed.  However, it should go away when running on a newer Linux distro.
It's nothing to worry about and can be safely ignored.

Subject: [Paraview] Automating loading of binary files
Message-ID: <CAH9P_kTiPgg-E-vx1zFx4A7NS5CHrYmoDgH20Kz11fxkdDVD+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone

Many thanks for Paraview.

I have a Python script that processes a series of volumetric data files and
exports simple binary files of three dimensional data of intermediate
stages of computation just for me to check that things are proceeding as
intended.

The "problem" is that to load a volume I have to do lots of clicks (specify
the spacing, the dimensions, the data type, the endianess, etc) and this is
getting tiring after a few times so I decided to automate this by writing a
script.

The script is dead simple and looks roughly like this:

from paraview.simple import *

Q = OpenDataFile("someFile.raw")
Q.SetPropertyWithName("DataScalarType","double")
Q.SetPropertyWithName("DataByteOrder","LittleEndian")
Q.SetPropertyWithName("DataSpacing",(1,2,2))
Q.SetPropertyWithName("DataExtent",(0,31,0,31,0,31))

Show()

#Find the object name, possibly this can be done in a better way
proxyID = Q.GetGlobalIDAsString()
objectName = filter(lambda x:x[1]==proxyID,GetSources().keys())[0]
GetRepresentation(FindSource(objectName[0])).SetPropertyWithName("
Representation","Volume")

At that last step, paraview is crashing. Previously, I simply had it as
GetRepresentation(something).Representation = "Volume" and it was still
crashing.

I would appreciate your help with the following:

1) What is the best practice way to change the representation to Volume?
2) To get the representation, I first allow paraview to create the object
and then look for it via its ID. Is there a way to retrieve it by name?

Looking forward to hearing from you
AA

Hi Chuck,

I start the pvserver through vnc. On my rendering server, the output from "glxinfo | grep OpenGL" is as follow:

OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: Tesla C2050/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL version string: 4.4.0 NVIDIA 331.67
OpenGL shading language version string: 4.40 NVIDIA via Cg compiler
OpenGL extensions:

And the output from "nvidia-smi" is:



On my PC, the output from "glxinfo | grep OpenGL" is:

OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: GeForce GT 730/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL version string: 4.5.0 NVIDIA 375.20
OpenGL shading language version string: 4.50 NVIDIA
OpenGL extensions:

And the output from "nvidia-smi" is:



Actually I'm not very clear about the meaning of the outputs above. Hope they can give you enough information to help me get 5.2.0 run on my server. Waiting for your good news.

Message-ID: <86B5D07F-3D3D-4559-8F1E-32B3A74A21D1@nasa.gov>

 Hi,  I?m trying to do something I thought would be simple and I?ll bet it is once I see my error - but I?ve spent several hours trying things and searching for answers in the docs.   I want to add an entry box in the property panel for Gamma in the PLOT3D reader. I?m compiling version 5.2.   I noticed in the header file that there are already MACRO?s for Gamma:
  /**
   * Set/Get the ratio of specific heats. Default is 1.4.
   */
  vtkSetMacro(Gamma,double);
  vtkGetMacro(Gamma,double);

I thought all I would have to do is add appropriate entries into the readers.xml file  and it would appear in the property panel. I?ve tried various things but they all look essentially like this:

      <!-- start TAB add -->
      <DoubleVectorProperty command="SetGamma"
                            name="Gamma"
                            default_values="1.4"
                            number_of_elements="1"
                            panel_visibility="default">
        <Documentation> Set Gamma </Documentation>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>
      <!-- end TAB add -->

It compiles and runs but I don?t get an entry  box. What am I missing?  I am stumped for now so any help would be appreciated.  I?ll hit it again  next week.
Thanks

Hi Ken,

When we start paraview web we noted two things:

1. In the Visualizer, the Files tab is not showing any files. Please refer
to the attached screenshot (paraview_home.jpg)
2. There is an error showing up at the browser console
(paraview_console_error.jpg, paraview_console_error2.jpg)

The paraview startup messages are also given for your reference
(paraview_log.jpg)



Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Hi Rick,

Is it tied to a particular compiler / os combination?  Better yet, is there
a machine I can reproduce it on? I've got an active account on most of the
HPCMP systems.

 Hi AA,

1) What is the best practice way to change the representation to Volume?
> 2) To get the representation, I first allow paraview to create the object
> and then look for it via its ID. Is there a way to retrieve it by name?

Show() returns the representation object that, if stored, you can use to
set the volume representation:

q = OpenDataFile("someFile.raw")
...
qDisplay = Show()
qDisplay.SetRepresentationType('Volume')

Hi Debopam,

1) I'm not sure to know what is the issue with the path but try with either:

"C:/ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit/data"
or
"C:\\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\\data"

2) paraview_console_error.jpg is not an error since you are not using the
launcher. So that part is actually expected.
For the second error when you try to delete the TimeAnnotation, I'm not
sure to know what is the issue. You should know more by looking at the
output of the command line.

Seb

Hello Chuck

Thank you very much for the helpful response.

My version was the one that is available by default at the Trusty Tahr's
repositories (4.0.1) and in that one, there was no SetRepresentationType. I
tried with qDisplay.Representation="Volume" (following your formalism) but
no matter what I tried in that version, the minute I was switching the
representation the whole thing was coming down.

I downloaded the latest binary and it worked immediately.


All the best
AA

we have a legacy implementation of a PV reader plugin which is patched into the PV code.

I want to refactor this approach to an external plugin.

In https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild it says:
????-
External plugins
The superbuild supports building more plugins into ParaView using the paraviewexternalplugins project. As an example, to build two external plugins a and b, the following settings should be used:
? enable_paraviewexternalplugins:BOOL=ON: Enables building using external plugins.
? paraview_PLUGINS_EXTERNAL:STRING=a;b: The list of plugins to build.
? paraview_PLUGIN_a_PATH:PATH=/path/to/plugin/a: The path to plugin a's source directory. It must contain a plugins.cmake to be picked up by ParaView.
??????
Sounds good, I assumed I have to add this via -D to the superbuild cmake, however it tells me
CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:
    enable_paraviewexternalplugins

And indeed I could not find anything about this, not in the code and not with google.

what do I miss? I there somewhere an example or documentation? Is this something new with 5.2?

Thanks for any help,

Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] How to start the Catalyst example: CxxFullExample
Message-ID: <1e16d1e.252e6.15952d934da.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hello everyone,

I'm learning the ParaView Catalyst by starting at the CxxFullExample, which is one of the Catalyst examples from https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode-MOVED-. I have compiled and built it and got the CxxFullExample executable. It is said that it's a full example of a simulation code interfacing with Catalyst, but I don't know how to execute it. I typed "./CxxFullExample" in the command line under the build directory of the example and nothing happened. I read the Chapter 2 of the Catalyst User's Guide and found what's  mainly discussed is about creating ParaView Catalyst scripts in ParaView. It is said that to create ParaView Catalyst scripts in ParaView, I must have a representative dataset, and the Appendix 7.1.2 of the guide has a script that can be used to create the dataset. I managed to get lots of files named "filename_x_x.vtu" and "filename_x.pvtu"(x is a number) by typing "./CxxFullExample ./pvpython python.py"(python.py is the script from the appendix 7.1.2 of the user's guide) in the command line under the bin directory of ParaView 4.4.0. Then I followed the section 2.2 of the user's guide with one of the file I generated above, only to get another script. Actually, what I want is a condition shown at www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/722, but after read the section 2.3 of the user's guide, I'm still unable to implement it. How should I organize the Catalyst enabled simulation and ParaView? Can it work in the client-server mode? Can I get it to work without much knowledge of Python? Maybe I'm on the wrong way of learning Catalyst, if so, you can ignore my questions and just tell me the right way. Thanks a lot!
