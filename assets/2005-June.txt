Dear Berk,

 

At first, thanks for your answers!

In the three steps you described:

"1. The gui elements make calls on an (C++) API called "server manager"
2. The server manager translates these into a stream that can be sent
  over the network
3. An interpreter receives these streams, parses them and converts
  them into C++ calls."

I have found the related source code for the second and third step, but I still could not find out that how the gui elements calls are passed to "server manager".

For example, when I choose the gui item "open data" in the "File" menu, the related processing source code is 

"this->MenuFile->InsertCommand(

clidx++, VTK_PV_OPEN_DATA_MENU_LABEL, this, "OpenCallback",0);"

 

And I also find the code that interpreter parses this stream as:

"int VTKTCL_EXPORT vtkPVWindowCppCommand(vtkPVWindow *op, Tcl_Interp *interp,

             int argc, char *argv[])

{

 

...

if ((!strcmp("OpenCallback",argv[1]))&&(argc == 2))

    {

    op->OpenCallback();

    Tcl_ResetResult(interp);

    return TCL_OK;

}

....

}"

 

BUT, I can not find the trace from gui element to server manager, that is the first step.

Can you explain this process for me using this example?

Please forgive my stupid, but I am indeed need some help.

 

Best,

Nancy

The paraview architecture is a wee bit to complicated to describe in
an e-mail. The ParaView Guide explains it some. In short:

1. The gui elements make calls on an (C++) API called "server manager"
2. The server manager translates these into a stream that can be sent
over the network
3. An interpreter receives these streams, parses them and converts
them into C++ calls.

Instead of using something like CORBA, we developed a very simple and
light layer that is automatically generated at compile time (generated
pretty much the same way Tcl, Python and Java wrappers are generated
for VTK automatically).

Has anyone worked on a Tecplot file reader/converter for ParaView that
supports multi-block format?  I have written a Tecplot-to-VTK (Legacy,
Unstructured) translator, but it looks like the best that I can do with the
.vtk file is to generate separate files for the different zones within the
Tecplot file.

I have one, but it actually implements an on-line conversion from TECPLOT
ASCII multi-block to a single unstructured VTK grid. It merges points on 
all the common grid boundaries. The reason I did that is because my users had
many (500+) blocks, each block being rather small (11x11x11, or 9x9x9). The
overhead in ParaView was too much. Merging while reading the blocks one after
the other was much faster. I guess you could start from that, and we could
make merging an option. R you still interested?

Greetings Mathieu;

I have accessed the VTK cvs repository as you
suggested for Giuseppe Gariup below.

I have been reviewing their content. I am planning
on using the Fortran calls to see if I can generate
acceptable (that is, readable) files for ParaView.

I did spot a typo that needs to be corrected:

At line 142 in file 'vtkXMLCInterface.cxx' the binding

void VTK_FORTRAN_NAME(vtkxml_setcelldata, VTKXML_SETPOINTDATA)

needs to be changed to 

void VTK_FORTRAN_NAME(vtkxml_setcelldata, VTKXML_SETCELLDATA)

I will see if I can expand 'TestXMLCInterface.c' slightly for you.

I will work with Brian Wylie to get the neccessary object libs when I 
think I am ready to test the Fortran Binding in my code Fma-3D.

Regards,

Sam Key

hi,all:
    I am just a new paraview code reader,and I had bought "ParaView Guide".When I
had Read the chapter 18,I knew how to modify the user interface.A Questionis:
    When I add a button "PrintColorButton" just as in the book ,the callback function is PrintColor.
when I build the code, the system automatically generate the correspond code in function "vtkPVWindowCommand" of vtkPVWindowTcl.cxx.
    There also many vtk***Command as vtkPVWindowCommand ,which is define as CommandFunction.
My Qustion is :when I click the PrintColorButton, if the any message generate as programs in VC60?
if generated which class generated it, and which class reacted it?
    forgive my stupid and thanks all.

Sam,

   I am glad you are keeping an eye on the mailing list, this is very important for an opensource project!

   The reason I did not warn you directly about it, is because the fortran interface involved a great knowledge in cmake, linkers and compilers. The task was then delegated to Brad Kind. According to him, he rewrote most of what was commited in CVS, for a more simpliest interface. Thus I believe the error you reported should go away. As a side note he also gave a more OO look to the interface giving you access to the full range of datasets available in VTK and not only vtkUnstructuredGrid.

   Brad, could you confirm you'll have something commited in VTK within the next few days ?

Best regards,
Mathieu

I've re-written the C interface to support multiple simultaneous writer 
instances and all 5 standard vtkDataObject types.  There is also a 
fortran interfaace wrapping the C interface, and I've successfully 
written a small .vtu file from a Fortran program.  I plan to commit the 
new C interface into VTK/IO on Monday as part of the vtkIO kit.  A C 
program will be able to include "vtkXMLWriterC.h" and link to the 
standard vtkIO library.

I'm not sure what to do with the fortran interface file, though.  It is 
a .c file that has some macros at the top to configure it for a 
particular fortran compiler.  The most flexible thing to do is 
distribute this .c file with VTK in soruce form and let fortran 
programmers include it in their build with a few -D options to the C 
compiler to tell it what the fortran compiler expects.  The drawback is 
that the fortran programmer will need a C compiler to build the small 
interface to VTK.

Suggestions?

Thanks,
-Brad

Hello,

I got a problem to get ParaView running on three linux computer.
So that my documentation only covers 1.8 and I want to use 2.01, I need
some help.
I thought about to have one client (I) and two server (II + III).

I started on III the server: ./pvserver

I started on II on another server: ./pvserver -m=machines.txt
With the following file machines.txt:

	node 0 computerIII

I tried also:

	node 0 computerII
	node 1 computerIII

	
I start the client on I: ./pvclient --data-server-host=computerII

The client I connects to II, but III is still only listening.

What do I wrong?

Thanks

Jan

You cannot have 2 servers. You can run paraview in three ways:

* standalone (paraview)
* server (pvserver)/client (pvclient)
* data server (pvdataserver)/render server (pvrenderserver)/client (pvclient)

Hi Jan,

You can only connect one pvserver to a pvclient.  If you are trying to 
start a data server and a render server, then do the following.

computerII:  ./pvdataserver
computerIII:  ./pvrenderserver -m=machines.txt
computerI:   ./pvclient -crs --data-server-host=computerII 
--render-server-host=computerIII

If instead you want to use both computerII and computerIII as part of 
pvserver, then do the following.

computerII:  Start ./pvserver with MPI, and specify that you want to run 
this executable on computerII and computerIII.  How you do this depends on 
your MPI installatation.
computerI:   ./pvclent --server-host=computerII

Greetings Brad,

Needing to have a C-compiler is not a problem for me; I have one.

Let me try to work with what you commit next week and see if I have
any ideas. I will be gone all next week, so you won't hear from me
until week after next. With luck you may hear from someone else
that will help keep you busy, though I suspect "busy" is not a
problem for you.

Regards,

OpenCallback() and other functions similar to it eventually lead to calling
vtkPVSource *vtkPVWindow::CreatePVSource();

This function, through a cloning process (which I am proud of
writing), instantiate and populate with right widgets a vtkPVSource.
The widgets that are added to vtkPVSource are created and set up using
an xml file in GUI/Client/Resources/.
These widgets are the ones that make calls on the server manager. For
example, you can look at vtkPVVectorEntry. There is some seriously
hard-to-follow code in there. Hopefully, it will be cleaned one day.

The callbacks are, in the core, implemented by the Tcl interpreter. If
you search for online information about how Tcl/Tk works and keep in
mind that vtkPVWindow has a corresponding Tcl command that can make
calls on the actual object, you will have a better shot at
understanding how it works. Windows events are created/caught by Tk.

Changing the default font for X in paraview/GUI/Client/vtkPVApplication.cxx 
-> vtkPVApplication::Start from

   -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-67-iso8859-1

to, for example,

   -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-18-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1

makes the ParaView GUI much easier to read. Only a few menus and panes have 
to be stretched to show all the options. FYI, the font for Windows is also 
set in that same routine.

Is this the best way to change the font? I couldn't find mention of X or 
Tcl/Tk defaults files.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 2.0.2...
Message-ID: <42A0C132.2080206@osc.edu>

I have downloaded and installed paraview v. 2.0.2 and noticed, in the 
bin/ directory, the added executables, pvbatch  pvclient,  
pvdataserver,  pvrenderserver and pvserver. This is from the binary 
distribution. I had used v. 1.8.5, again binary distribution, and was 
following chapter 13, the tutorial, of _The Paraview Guide_. From 
reading the section of the tutorial on running parallel, I was prepared 
to compile, from the source, version 2.0.2 on a linux cluster. But, when 
I noticed the pvserver executable, I wondered if version 2.0.2 binary 
distribution comes compiled with the parallel feature? Or is the 
recommended routine to compile from the source distribution?

Thanks for any clarification.

You can use the separate client/server executables from the binary to 
run a single node of each type.  If you want to use MPI to run a 
multi-node server you'll still have to build from source.

Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA919@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Hello ParaView List -

I've been trying to build an MPI-enabled, 64-bit version of ParaView for the last few days on our SGI but it keeps terminating during the build of HDF5 with a complaint of missing libraries. I suspect that there are a number of SGI builds out there and was wondering what changes or configurations were needed to get ParaView to compile properly.

Can you use the IRIX CMake binaries available on the cmake.org site or must you build cmake from scratch for an appropriate compile?
Are there any special flags in addition to '-64 -LANG:std' that you use for the compilers?
Are there any special flags in addition to '-64' that you use for the linkers?
Do you use the ParaView HDF5 or one already built / installed on your system?

My particular problem is in compiling the HDF5 libraries - this problem occurs on both the stable release (2.0.2) and the latest CVS sources. We have a standard install of IRIX 6.5.26m with the 7.4.2m MipsPro compilers so I don't believe any critical libs are missing - based on reading the SGI freeware build tips I think some of the libs (libdl.so, libsocket.so) are being called for inclusion in hdf5 when there aren't needed (and IRIX doesn't provide them - at least not in the requested form). This is basically a newbie suspicion, so before I start learning / reading / digging through cmake files and makefiles to test it I thought I should ask what others had experienced - I take the "DO NOT HAND EDIT" warnings seriously :)

Thanks in advance for your guidance. BTW, for those who sent advice on building ParaView on the Opteron in response to my previous post, please accept my thanks - I haven't reported success (or failure) yet because we needed some extra hardware that won't arrive until Monday.

Best regards -

Dear paraview listers

Sorry to bother you with such a small thing...

I'm begining to use paraview to visualize   a numeric solution to a
simple  diffusion problem on a cubic domain. I'm plotting my initial
condition, a uniform scalar field over a cube with a smaller cube in the
center. I'm using the .vtk 2.0 file format and a RECTILINEAR GRID  data
format. My diffusion code is in fortran but I call a C subroutine to
write the .vtk files.  

 I read the file with paraview 1.4 release 3  and cut in the midle of
the cube with an implicit plane. I expect to get a square in the center
of the cutting plane. 

I observe some diffuse figure with a square resemblance but not a net
square. If I change to flat display style I get a net figure but with
saw like sides. 

Is this the expected behavior or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks very much for your time

Luis Card?n

Hello Amy,

I play a little bit around, but I'm still not knowing, how to solve my
problem. I want to use the second approach.

But first one question to the first, what stands in the machine file?
What do I have to declare here? 

In the second approach I can use multiple computers to make the
calcutions. I use mpich 1.2.6 and try to get it run with mpirun. (But I
really don't know the way to go).
I tried the following:

ComputerII: mpirun  -machinefile machines.LINUX -np 2 pvserver 

with machines.LINUX including ComputerII & Computer III

Then I start the client:

ComputerI: ./pvclient --server-host=ComputerII

Then I get the following error:

Connect to ComputerII:11111
ERROR: In
/home/linnenko/lib/paraview-2.0.1/VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, line 539
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x8075100): Could not send tag.

The client starts up but crashes later on...
(When I run it with -np 1 it works fine)

Bye Jan

I do not much about the hdf5 configuration nor have I built paraview
on sgis recently. I suspect a configuration error in ParaView's
CMakeLists.txt. Please submit a but report at:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug

Meanwhile, I recommend building hdf5 yourself and enabling
PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 in the paraview configuration (probably an
advanced option). This options allows you to specify your own hdf5
library to use with paraview. Make sure that the hdf5 library is built
with the same options as paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] A very simple and useful filter...
Message-ID: <20050606143922.6415272780@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi all,

Does anybody know if there's a way to provide a "copy filter" in future
Paraview's releases? I think that it would be very simple to implement and
useful. 

Sometimes I have to "derive" some filters to produce the effect that I want,
for example: when you are working with several 3D Texts with the same
atributes (size, position, actor color, etc...) you are forced to create
several 3D Text sources and set up the atributes one-by-one and it is too
boring.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.33.0506061045130.8488-100000@pscuxc.psc.edu>


Hello,

I have a simple question. I'm using Paraview version 2.0.1 and I'm trying
to run a batch job in client/server mode. However pvbatch only executes
batch scripts and does not connect to server, while pvclient just connects
to server and does not execute batch scripts. Is there a way to execute a
paraview .pvb script in client/server mode without using the older
version?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <E1BD088683EF744ABFB0ED62370BEB8B52D0E8@ERD-ML4ERD.erd.ds.usace.army.mil>

para-people,

 

I have a single legacy vtk rectilinear grid data file that has approx 3.8
Gcells.

 

paraview fails to read it and so does VTK for that matter.

the trouble is the number of cells is larger that 2^31 since when the

cell data is read it's called with a good old int (not even an unsigned int).

 

I've rebuild paraview and vtk with 64-bit IdTypes; but this doesn't help.

 

any thing else to try ?

Okay, the C/Fortran interface is now available.  A C program can do

#include "vtkXMLWriterC.h"

and link to vtkIO.  A Fortran program can use the interface (see the 
example code below) but will need to compile one extra .c file to link 
properly to vtkIO.  See VTK/IO/vtkXMLWriterF.h for instructions.

I am attempting to compile Paraview on our linux cluster, and have some 
errors:

   1.  Warning: The BUILD_EXAMPLES option now requires CMake 2.0.4 or
      higher and is being ignored.
      CMake 2.0.6 has been installed under /usr/local/cmake-2.0.6 and
      cmake, ccmake and ctest all refer to /usr/local/cmake-2.0.6/bin.
   2.  CMake Error: File
      /usr/local/share/CMake/Templates/TestDriver.cxx.in does not exist.
      Indeed TestDriver.cxx does not exist but does reside in
      /usr/local/cmake-2.0.6/share/CMake/Templates/TestDriver.cxx.in.
      How can I steer the various CMakeLists.txt to  look in the
      installed dir?
   3. This is not an error, but I just would like some clarification.
      When setting the NUMPROCS value, here I am just testing a setting
      of 2, the NUMPROCS_FLAG requires a value? For example "-np 2"?

Thanks for any suggestions.

This probably means you have an existing build tree using a cmake from 
another path.  Try this command:

/usr/local/cmake-2.0.6/bin/cmake /path/to/build/tree

Hi all

I have been measuring the Still Render time of a subset of an EnSight
case file with 46 datasets. The subset is made of 12 parts, for a total
of 85K cells and 43K points, i.e. pretty small stuff.

I tested 3 options:

1) rendering the "Extract Parts" object made of 12 parts.
2) Saving it to a *.pvd file (collecting 12 *.vtu) files, reloading and
rendering
3) Use AppendDatasets, save to disk as a single *.vtu file, reloading
and rendering.

All renderings are done on a dual-cpu Linux desktop, with Parallel
Projection, no strips, immediate mode ON, one scalar variable at the nodes.

With PV 1.8.4 compiled on my linux box (gcc 3.3.5), I get the same
rendering time () of 0.04 seconds. No problem thus far. That is my
reference time.

I switched to PV 2.0.2 and PV nightly and rendering times are up to 30
times longer.

Option 1) takes 1.3 seconds
Option 2) takes 0.10 seconds
Option 3) takes 0.05 seconds (pretty close to the resulsts of PV1.8.4)

Can anyone bring some light to this?

Option 1) being what I use most of the time (to avoid creating all these
additional *vtu) files, I have seen my application render data at about
4/5 seconds per frame (I have many EnSight files, with CAD, external and
internal CFD, thus with hundreds of datasets).

Using LOD does not help and every time the window is obscured (by a menu
pop-up for example), a still render takes place and takes too long...

I have compared the output of "ldd" on all my executables and they all
use exactly the same libs (OGL included).

So, while single dataset visualization seems equal in PV1.8.4 and PV2.*,
multi-dataset handling sems to have changed a lot between the two
releases. Or am I missing something?

I'm trying, by studying vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet, Graphics/Testing/Cxx/vtkTestHierarchicalDataReader.* and Graphics/Testing/Cxx/TestHierarchicalBoxPipeline.cxx, to create a version of my paraview Flash reader that loads the data into the AMR structure you folks've been working on.

I use the contour and cutting filters right now on the vtkUnstructuredGrid output of my current reader.  
1)  Will I be able to apply those to the AMR structure?
2)  Will I also be able to do clipping, streamlines of vector data, data probing and volume rendering?

For my current reader, paraview keeps track of multiple scalar variables that are attributes of the same grid.
1)  Will the same happen with the AMR structure, or must I take care of that myself?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA926@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Hello ParaView List -

I've been having some problems building ParaView on IRIX6.5 that are related to the building of the HDF5 libraries.  Following the advice of Berk Geveci, I downloaded and built the HDF5 libraries separately.  I had some issues during the build that the kind folks at NCSA helped me with and I wanted to forward this on to the ParaView list.

I appear to have a successful out-of-source build (build dir is /usr/local/hdf5-sgi) using the following commands (using bash shell);

>RUNPARALLEL="mpirun -np 2"
>export RUNPARALLEL
>LIBS="-lmpi"
>export LIBS
>MAKE=gmake CC='cc -64 -LANG:std' CFLAGS='-woff 1035' LD='cc -64' ../hdf5/configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-parallel
>gmake
>gmake check
>gmake install

Points of note for the newbies among us - 
You want to use gmake if you are performing an out-of-source build as it handles the path resolution properly.
If you received errors while running "gmake check" during the MPI tests, make sure that your array services are running.  If they aren't, use "chkconfig array on" to turn them on.

All tests performed during the "gmake check" were passed.

All the best -
Ken

I have an AMR reader for an in-house format based on HDF5. The reader is
 compatible with the current ParaView nightly (thanks to some tips by
Berk Geveci).

My experience is that clipping, contouring and cutting work well across
levels and across multiple grids, although you might still have some

The main difference between ParaView 1.8 and 2.0 are:
* the pipeline change and addition of garbage collection
* new animation support. 
The fact that (3) takes a lot less to render than (1) leads me to
believe that there is additional overhead due to the number of
filters/mappers in the pipeline.  It is hard to say more without
profiling information. I can look into this when I have some free
time. Can I have the data?

Luis,

This is not a bug but rather a side effect of the way OpenGL
interpolates colors as well how the cut filter works. We have improved
on this by offering the option of using 1D texture maps instead of
OpenGL interpolation. If you upgrade to paraview 1.8 or 2.0, you
should get better results. Also, when you move to larger data sizes,
the result will look much better since the triangles will be smaller.

You cannot run batch in client/server mode. The way it is designed to work is:
1. run interactive client/server session and save batch (edit if
necessary) OR write batch from scratch
2. copy the batch to the server (we should probably allow the batch to
be written to the server directly, hmmm, useful feature...)
3. run the batch on the server
4. copy resulting images to the client as appropriate

I have not been able to reproduce this behavior on the 2.0.2 release.  I 
can color an implicit cut plane using cell data in both 2.0.1 and 
2.0.2.  You can download 2.0.1 from our web site at 
http://www.paraview.org/files/v2.0/.

Are you coloring by a cell scalar array or a cell vector array?  If it's a 
vector array, the default is to color by the vector magnitude, and if all 
the vectors had the same magnitude, then the plane would be all the same color.

- Amy

PS  Is it possible for you to either send us your data or a small sample 
data set that demonstrates this behavior?  It would also be helpful if you 
sent us a trace or session file from your ParaView session when you see 
this problem.

I am working on streamlines and probing. Lisa and Yogi are working on

You don't have to do anything.

The advantages of using the AMR structure are:
* A lot more memory efficient than unstructured
* A lot more cpu efficient
* The data structure visualized is much closer to the simulation data
structure. It is possible to extract levels, blocks etc.. without
recreating an unstructured grid.
* Algorithms based on structured data will work better (for example
volume rendering)

Hi all,

I am currently developing volume mappers for VTK which support 
vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet as input (AMR volume rendering). I would like to 
now solicit some assistance from the VTK / ParaView community - if you are 
working with AMR data (in VTK / ParaView or in other applications) I would 
appreciate hearing from you on the following items:

- what application area are you working in? (astrophysics? climate studies? 
combustion? biomedical?)

- what is your data like? (scalar fields? vector fields? time varying? what 
is the size? what file format?)

- what are your computing resources for visualizing this data? (desktop 
system? cluster? multi-processor system?)

- what are the most important features that you need to visualize your 
data? Would you use volume rendering?

- do you have some data you would be willing to share?


Since I am expecting a flood of responses from the masses of folks out 
there using AMR data :-) please respond directly to me and not to the whole 
list.


Thanks!

Lisa

Thanks for checking. The problem is intermittent and I haven't seen any 
pattern so far. The next day, with everything the same (except maybe the 
angle of the sun) it all worked fine. Actually, there are various bugs like 
these that occur after hours of adding and deleting modules. I'll let you

I'm trying to determine, by looking at vtkTestHierarchicalDataReader, how I'll load multiple scalars (or vectors for that matter) into the AMR structure.  I see that each image dataset read by the vtkXMLImageDataReader in vtkTestHierarchicalDataReader::RequestData() is passed to vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet::SetDataSet().

My data is an octree of what are called "blocks", which are regular grids.  I expect I will have to either 

o  load all the scalars from a block into its vtkUniformGrid, and then pass that once to SetDataSet(), or 

o  load one scalar, pass the vtkUniformGrid to SetDataSet(), then somehow load the rest of the scalars into that vtkUniformGrid, which has already been made part of the vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet.


1)  Which of those two, if any, sounds right?
2)  Are the vtkUniformGrid's you define for vtkTestHierarchicalDataReader all leaves, or are some of them parents of others?

Thanks.

Although both would work, I have always used the first one.

> 2)  Are the vtkUniformGrid's you define for vtkTestHierarchicalDataReader all leaves, or are some of them parents of others?

Parents and leaves are both there. For regions of parents that are
refined, you still have to provide storage for data. This data can be
invalid however.
Another possibility is to break the parents into blocks in such a way
that all the data is valid. ChomboVis uses this approach. Both are
supported.

Upon further investigation I discovered that the support was already 
there for the EnSight reader, so adding it to the XMLCollecitonReader 
was trivial.  It is present as of revision 1.10 of 
vtkXMLCollectionReader.cxx in the CVS version of ParaView.

I cannot figure out how to add this to my xml file.  Could someone please provide an example? Thank you

Subject: [Paraview] Simple Filter Problem
Message-ID: <002701c56db1$91ad2650$8964a8c0@wolf>

Hi

I have expanded the vtkSimpleImagetoImage Filter to substract the
horizontal average of each plane of a 3d box to display the relative
fluctuations only. The project is attached. 
The problem is : 
After applying the Filter I get a completely white box, althought the
values I set with outPtr[index] = inPtr[index] - horizontal[i]; seem
to be correct when printing them with printf.
and .
Why is the Contour-Filter disabled after applying the HA-Filter?

thanks in advance

--------------------------------------------

I don't know if making ParaView and Xdmf work with HDF5-1.6.4 is that important; I certainly don't want to pester anyone either - I'm sure all you folks are busy enough.  Should I just build the "favored" version of HDF5 (v1.6.1) and be done with it?

Your advice and comments are welcome, and are always appreciated.

Best regards -
Ken

Looks like some parameters changed from hssize_t to hsize_t in HDF5
1.6.4 (by default paraview uses 1.6.1). I made some changes and checked
it into cvs. It compiles on my IRIX64 box ... give it a try.

Hello,

I think it would be very nice, when Kitware would expand their wiki on
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki and build in a link for ParaView on the start
page.
That would be a nice location for all the faq reported again and again
in this mailing list. And it would be much more easier for a newcomer
like me to find right solutions in the start phase.

I agree. I just haven't got around doing it. Andy said he'll create
the first page. Hopefully, the paraview users will maintain and update
it after that.

Hi All,

Just wanted to let everybody know that I setup a Wiki pages for
ParaView. The address is:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView

You are more than welcome to add pages, modify existing pages etc. The
only request I have is that for new pages you add ParaView: in front of
their name. For example, FAQ is ParaView:FAQ.

Thank you.

Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA92D@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Hello ParaView List -

I had what appears to be a successful parallel 64-bit build with the latest CVS ParaView using HDF5 v1.6.1.  Unfortunately I can't get paraview to run; I call the executable in the following manner -

mpirun -v -np 2 /opt/bin/paraview

This generates the following error:
MPI: libxmpi.so 'SGI MPI 4.4 MPT 1.9  11/11/03 01:10:38'
MPI: libmpi.so  'SGI MPI 4.4 MPT 1.9  11/11/03 01:10:29      (64_M4)'
MPI: MPI_MSGS_MAX = 524288
MPI: MPI_BUFS_PER_PROC= 32
MPI: MPI_COMM_WORLD rank 0 has terminated without calling MPI_Finalize()
MPI: aborting job
MPI: Received signal 11

DDD reports that ParaView is generating the signal 11 but it doesn't provide details that I can see.

I have a couple of newbie questions so please bear with me -

Im attempting to run ParaView in 64bit mode and take advantage of both processors on our workstation. I assumed that I would need to compile with 64bit libs and MPI to do this on our SGI box; Am I doing this in the proper manner or am I wrong about this? Does paraview utilize multiple processors on an SMP machine without MPI?

I specify libmpi++.so and libmpi.so for linking into ParaView. The above error shows libxmpi.so is being called - Do I also need to link in this library?

Your advice and suggestions would be very welcome - Im quite lost.  All the best.

Attached is a sample *.pvd file that uses the name="abc...xyz"
feature for the xml Collection tag. The big plus to this feature
is that when name="..." is present, the designated name string
shows up in the Extract Parts face sheet selection-box!!!

PS Thanks to Brad King for the feature! Now, if the animation could
just see beyond the 1st  part="..." listed, we'd have a first class way to
turn domains on and off for animation like we can do now for the static
visualization. :=)  (I believe this shortcoming in animation has been
reported to the bug list a couple of times.)

Subject: [Paraview] Problems mit Offline-Rendering (Mesa)
Message-ID: <1118651214.5675.16.camel@grid25.slf.local.slf.local>

Hello,

I had some problems with the offline-rendering. On the machines I used,
I didn't have the opportunity to login locally with an X-Server. Because
of this, I tried to use the mesa option to render offline. On the client
I want to render onscreen (therefore I build two versions, one with Mesa
and without Mesa support).

So I followed the build instruction on
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_OpenGL. I tried the mangled mesa and the
pure mesa way. With both I get the following interupt of the program
listed on the end of this email.

So why do he try to use a X server connection? I thought he should take
the mesa rendering. Where is my mistake?

I use the following things: ParaView CVS Version, MPI 2.01, Mesa 6.2.1

Thanks Jan

Hi Henry,

I don't know exactly why the Extract Parts menu is grayed out, but I have 
attached a sample .pvd file that does make the listed names appear when you 
apply an Extract Parts filter.  Maybe you can determine what difference 
between this file and yours is causing the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Distributed file format
Message-ID: <20050613182808.EFAEF72780@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi all,

does anybody could give me any suggestion about which file format is more
suitable for distributed computations? 

I've been running CFD computations based on message passing parallelism
where the unstructured mesh is previously partitioned by Metis library and
locally reordered according to each partition. Thus, after this procedure I
have n partitions with nodes and elements numbered from 1 up to k entities
(nodes and elements). Actually, I've been joining my n result files with a
posprocessor program to recover my "global mesh" in an Ensight file format
but I really like to avoid this step and produce the result files for each
partition directly.

I have the Paraview's Guide and I've already tried to understand the VTK's
file formats,  but unfortunately, they are too hard to use when you are
programming with Fortran.

I think that although Paraview is focused on parallelism there is a lack of
information about the file formats are more suitable for it yet.

Thanks a lot for any discussion about this issue

Message-ID: <200506140625.j5E6PHFP009860@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hi folks;
  I'm attempting to save a keyframe animation to a .pvb file from ParaView 
2.0.1, and then to render it using pvbatch.  The series of steps to do this 
job with ParaView 1.8 and the old animator doesn't seem to work.  If I set up 
a keyframe animation and then do 'File/Save batch script' I get a pvb file 
which produces only a single image.  It looks like adding the right bit of tcl 
code to the bottom of the .pvb file could cause the full animation to be 
rendered, but I can't find any documentation for the tcl calls to do so.
  Should this work?  How does one save a keyframe animation as a pvb file?

Thanks,

Hello,
Is there some type of guide for making the annotation things?  Like an
example document of all the different kinds of command you can use.  For
example could I grab the name from the pvd file: <DataSet timestep="0"

And then display that?

Hi all,

I'm looking for a distributed file format suitable to work with huge data
sets in Paraview. Therefore, as I'm used to work with binary Ensight (NOT
GOLD) files on my Fortran programs I was thinking about try to use the
Ensight server-of-server file format. 

According to Ensight's user guide, this file format works pointing to
multiple/distributed case files (ensight6, gold or plot3d formatted) each
one with your own local and numbered data set.

Has anybody already used this file format with Paraview that could share
experiences and/or example files with me?

Thanks for any help.

I recommend using the xml based vtk file formats instead of using
EnSight files. I know they are hard to write. This is why C and
Fortran interfaces have been developed. You link your application
again some VTK libraries and make function calls to have the file
written for you. I will ask the developer to provide more information
(I believe there has already been a discussion about this).

I don't think paraview ever supported field data. The reader probably
reads it but the application will not do anything with it.

There is but it is very kludgy. We have a feature request to improve
this but I don't know when we will get to it. If you want, I can show

The program that we generate our paraview data works with
unequal/variable length time steps.  Is there some way to handle these
in the animation in paraview, so that a timevalue of 1:1, to 1:2, does
not animate for the same length as 1:1, to 1:53.4?  Where 1:1 =

I guess you could do this by creating individual keyframes for each
file but it would be cumbersome. Furthermore, ParaView does not
interpolate datasets therefore between 1:1 and 1:53.4 nothing would
change. I can't think of any other way of doing this, short of
changing the reader to take time as a floating point value. It might
be possible to do it with EnSIght files but there still won't be any
interpolation in between.

I have no idea :-)

If you figure out, let me know too, please. There must be some system
setting somewhere, I gather.

By UI, do you mean some extra buttons etc. in 3D View Settings or a
completely new page?

The CaveRenderModule provides only a viewing area. This means that for
working in the cave one needs to use a mouse and keyboard. Our goal is to
use our normal 3D visualization tools from within the cave, not just at
some outside terminal with a mouse and keyboard. For example, at a very
basic level, we're hoping to incorporate our 3D tracking stereo glasses
so that we move the camera based on the headset location. So I guess I
want to create a completely new page. Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Memory consumption
Message-ID: <1118926767.5675.65.camel@grid25.slf.local.slf.local>

Hello,

I just looked at the memory consumption of ParaView. I use a 120MB
microCT-File as input (size 400*400*400, 16bit, fileformat pvd). Then I
do the following steps: Loading data, median filter, treshold surface
(pvclient, pvserver(2), ParaViewCVS version).
I hoped, when I run on 2 machines, that the memory consumption is half
of the size on each machine, than when I use only one machine (with the
processing time this works fine). But it is nearly the same size. 
So what is the reason for this? Do I need special input data, to
minimize memory consumption?

does not show a corresponding change, thereby giving an incorrect reading of

Dear all:

Recently I am studying the Paraview's programming structure. I had read the
paraview guide book, ,In the chapter 16, I knew the Paraview server manager
is responsible for handing communication between the client and the servers.
A question is :

Which part is the server manager running on?Only on the client or on both
the client and the server.

Please give me some concept of how  the server manager running.

Thanks!

You can use the 'transform' filter. That actually changes the value of
the bounds of the object. The actor control is simply a 'visual' change.

Subject: [Paraview] Anyone have a successful IRIX64 build?
Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA93B@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Hi there -

I've had zero success in building the latest devel and stable versions of ParaView on our Octane2. Because of problems with building the included HDF5 (seems to be a bug) I've been attempting to build HDF5 first and tell ccmake where to find it. 

I would greatly appreciate any hints, tips, tricks, suggestions, guidance, and maybe even simple riddles from any folks who have built the latest ParaView successfully on their IRIX64 box.  I was going for a 64 bit, parallel build with the IRIX MPT libs; If there are any special flags passed to the HDF5 configure script that would be really handy -  I think I'm matching everything between HDF5 and ParaView but since it still isn't working I have my concerns. I'd be glad to make a synopsis and put it in the ParaView Wiki for other IRIX folks to use - I can usually type stuff up successfully. :)

For those interested, my 64-bit nonparallel build completes (as does the parallel build) but ParaView dies with a signal 11 before bringing up any GUI.  The stack trace is included below and appears to indicate a memory allocation problem; Again - I appreciate your help and apologize in advance if I have done something stupid.  Please let me know if there is some other information that would be useful to post for debugging purposes.

all the best -
Ken

Martin,

ServerManager is created only on the client.
ServerManager is set up when the GUI (on the client side) is created.
Once a servermanager object i.e. a proxy has been created, the GUI does 
not have to bother about where the VTK object(s) reside. It just 
manipulates the properties of the proxy. The servermanager decides where 
the command for manipulation of the VTK are to be sent and how.

I am new to paraview and need some help.

I want to extend paraview so that I can move
my dataset relative to another dataset by
mouse operations.
I know there exists "Actor Control" and "Transform
Filter", however, in those commands, I can't
move my dataset directly.
(I need to move it like Camera control in 3Dview.
Rotate by dragging...etc.)

Does anyone know easy way to do it?
Do I have to write a filter?

Thanks for any help.

It looks like it's getting confused on that symbol.  The linking  
command in the log prior to this should shed some light on the issue,  
such as multiple linking to a library or two different libraries,  
like the old libgcc.a format library and the newer, more easily  
confused, dynamically linked library libgcc_s.dylib (which is  
probably /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.0.dylib or similar in disguise).

It's been a while since I built 2.0.2 but try turning off dynamically  
linked libraries in configuration if you can.  Sure your binaries  
will be 50 megabytes, but at least then we can rule out dynamic  
library hell as a source of issues.

Cheers,
Joe

Subject: [Paraview] Anyone have a successful IRIX64 build?

A few things to try:

* Does <ParaviewBuildDir>/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/tclsh run?
* What happends when you do a 
ctest -E ParaView 
where ctest is in the same place as cmake.
* What happens if you run pvserver?

I'd be glad to make a synopsis and put it in the ParaView Wiki for other IRIX folks to use - I can usually type stuff up successfully. :)

You need to write a new interactor style to do this. This is too
complicated to explain here. A few places to look:
* VTK interactor style classes
* VTK user's guide
* VTK mailing list
* VTK examples

Once you write a new interactor style, you have to make changes
vtkPVWindow to "install" the interactor style into paraview. It is
also possible to change the existing interactor style to add a new
mode.

Berk -

I ran the tests you suggested;

* Does <ParaviewBuildDir>/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/tclsh run?
Yes - I'm not familiar with Tcl/Tk but a prompt comes up and I was able to query help and exit without a problem. Is there any other functionality I should test at the prompt?

* What happends when you do a ctest -E ParaView where ctest is in the same place as cmake.
Most of the tests pass - here is the summary
89% tests passed, 7 tests failed out of 64

The following tests FAILED:
         53 - TestSetObjectMacro-PVServer-Common (Failed)
         54 - TestSetObjectMacro-PVServer-Filters (Failed)
         55 - TestSetObjectMacro-PVServer-ServerManager (Failed)
         57 - TestSetObjectMacro-KWWidgets (Failed)
         61 - TestSetGet-PVBatch (Failed)
         62 - PVLocal (Failed)
         64 - TestSetObjectMacro-PVGUI-Client (Failed)

When I first ran ctest I forgot to include the -E option and some of the pvclient and pvbatch tests ran; These almost all terminated with errors and generated the following alerts in the console -

ALERT: Process [pvclient] 373627 generated trap, but has signal 11 held or ignored
        epc 0xd9fc8c8 ra 0xd9fc6ac badvaddr 0x1539be88
        process has been terminated to prevent infinite loop

* What happens if you run pvserver?
Running pvserver with no options generates the following...
/opt/bin/pvserver
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...

pvserver waits for a response idefinitely.

Thanks for your help and guidance; Any comments and/or suggestions are welcome.

All the best -
Ken

Is it possible that there are compiler and/or compiler options
mismatch between paraview and tcl? Although tcl and tk are built as
part of paraview, they do not use the same build process. They use
configure instead of cmake. Can you delete some objects files (some
*.o from <builddir>/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix and some from
<builddir>/VTK/Common) and compile with make VERBOSE=1 to see which
compiler/command line options are used?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 2.0.3
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050621150752.02d79028@pop.biz.rr.com>

Dear ParaView users and developers,

We are nearly ready to cut the ParaView 2.2 CVS branch.  We are just 
waiting until we get the Dashboard cleaned up a little more.  In the 
meantime, we have enough changes on the ParaView 2.0 branch to create a new 
patch release.  The ParaView 2.0.3 release is now available for download 
from the ParaView web site: http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html. 
There are several changes included in this release.

changes from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3:
1) The SPCTH reader is working again.
2) When you click the Delete button for a reader/source/filter or choose 
"Delete All Modules" from the Edit menu, memory is appropriately released.
3) Lookmarks are automatically saved at the end of a UNIX session.  (This 
was already happening for Windows sessions.)
4) The vtkGaussianCubeReader now uses its vtkTransform to map the atoms' 
coordinates back to the Grid domain (bug #1594).
5) In ParaView/Utilities/Xdmf/Ice/CMakeLists.txt, a typo was corrected so 
that we now have matching {}'s.

changes from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2:
1) In loading EnSight data sets, both "tensor per node" and "tensor symm 
per node" are acceptable in the .case file.
2) All expected glyphs are av available to the glyph filter, not just arrow 
and line. (bug #1774)
3) The command-line options --cave-configuration and -cc have been 
re-enabled, although they are deprecated and will be removed in ParaView 
2.2. (See next change.)
4) The variables for cave setup are to be specified in the XML 
configuration file.  See attachment.  This configuration file should be 
passed to each executable run to start ParaView (e.g., pvserver 
"/path/to/file/config.pvx", pvclient "/path/to/file/config.pvx", etc.).
5) The list of machine names in the render server (or data server if the 
render server connects to the data server) is to be specified in the XML 
configuration file.  The use of a separate machines file has been 
deprecated, but it will continue to work until the release of ParaView 
2.2.  See attachment.
6) In the Exodus reader, array selection widgets have been added for side 
sets and node sets.
7) When a second contour filter is applied to a data set, all the 
point-centered scalar arrays are available to it. (bug #1809)
8) A correction has been made to the tooltip for the "LOD threshold" 
slider. (bug #1474)
9) The volume rendering editor was unusable (and sometimes crashed) when 
cell-centered variables were used.  This has been corrected. (bug #1844)
10) It is now possible to run in cave mode with more than one display.

changes from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1:
1) The size of the precompiled binary files for linux has been 
significantly reduced. The .gz file went from 64.3 MB to 22.1 MB. The .Z 
one is down to 33.7 MB from 108 MB.
2) When "Play Demo" is selected from the Help menu, the Demo1.pvs file is 
correctly located, and the demo runs.
3) On Windows, all the ParaView-related executables are included in the 
precompiled binaries.
4) On Windows, the Uninstall executable actually uninstalls ParaView 
(including removing it from the Start menu and the registry).
5) The auto-accept feature has been turned off for the array calculator. 
Using auto-accept with this filter caused ParaView to produce errors 
because it tried to evaluate the expression in the calculator before it had 
been completely entered (bug #1549).
6) The problem with Cache Geometry in animation in client / server mode 
where the animated parameter stops changing has been corrected (bug #1502).
7) Clicking the "Label Point Ids" check box no longer crashes the 
application (bug #1657).
8) When probing with a line, you can now select which array(s) to display 
in the XY plot. The results can be exported to a CSV file, which is 
readable by MS Excel.
9) The PVD reader loads all parts, not just the first one (bug #1742).
10) In pvTestDriver.cxx (used in ParaView's regression testing), a 
correction was made to the code determining which tests are allowed to have 
errors and still pass.
11) The "Save SM State" item has been removed from the File menu. This is a 
development feature and was not intended for the release.

We hope you enjoy this new patch release of ParaView.

- Amy

Message-ID: <42BBE737@webmail.ualberta.ca>

Hello,

I just tried installing the latest build of paraview (2.0.2) on an IBM p690 
machine running AIX 5.2 and ran into some problems.
After configuring ccmake, and trying to make, we got the following error:

Error 0031-808: Hostfile or pool must be used to request node.

Also, in place of MPI we are trying to use POE, and tried changing the ccmake 
parameters to that fact.

Has anyone else managed to get Paraview to run successfully on AIX? Any 
guidelines or tips that we should try to get this up and running? Thanks alot.

Eugene Chan

After about 3 weeks of struggling with the #%*& IBM, I got a 64-bit
version to compile. I remember having two problems that I had to patch:
 1. Add "class vtkKWFrame;" to
GUI/Client/vtkPVHorizontalAnimationInterface.h
 2. I had some problem with one of the standard stream interfaces
(ostrstr?) but I don't remember which one.

The error you're seeing is that the IBM is trying to run an executable
that is parallel (my experience is MPI here, so I'll use that). The
standard IBM MPI way is 
 mpiexec -n 1 paraview -hfile file_containing_name_of_hosts_to_run_on

Now, if you're seeing this while running ccmake, then with the options
that you've selected is causing cmake to generate it's helper/test apps
with parallel options. The best way I found to fix it is to jam all of
the parallel options onto the MPI_ lines in the cmake config. That way,
only executables that are linked with the mpi libraries need the mpiexec
to run.

Hope this helps,

Mark

I finally got it to compile!


To compile ParaView 2.0.3 on Mac OS X (10.4.1):

1. From /usr/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin8/4.0.0/libgcc.a
remove

_udivdi3.o
_divdi3.o

Why is this static library being linked?

In /usr/include/X11/
replace

X.h
Xatom.h
Xutil.h
keysymdef.h
keysym.h
cursorfont.h
Xfuncproto.h
Xlib.h

with the newer, corresponding files in the ParaView distribution 
(paraview-2.0.3/Utilities/TclTk/tk8.4.5/xlib/X11/).

Why are the older files being linked?

How should the cmake files be modified?

Looking at the above code line 18 is:
set kw(vtkTemp738) [$kw(vtkTemp734) GetChild "Sources.[$kw(vtkTemp660) GetName].TimeStep.0"]

Can anyone help fix this problem? Thanks in advance.

Berk -

I deleted some of the object files (libraries for tcl/tk) and reran with "make VERBOSE=1"; The tcl/tk components are compiled with the c99 compiler with the 64bit flag; The vtk components are built with the CC compiler and the 64bit and LANG:std flags.  I don't think the LANG flag is an issue because according to the MIPsPro docs the LANG:std flag is on by default for c++ code.  I've enclosed some representative entries below - I can post the whole logfile but it is a little long.

Would it be beneficial to run this again and save the preprocessed source? To the best of my knowledge, the compiler flags appear to be consistent. Perhaps something is getting pulled in that shouldn't be?

Any and all help would be appreciated. Thanks for your guidance.

Best regards -
Ken

Subject: [Paraview] dead Keyboard in paraView
Message-ID: <20050624072440.23787.qmail@web30807.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi there!
I installed OpenFoam with ParaView 1.8 R5 in my Fedora
3 machine (kernel 2.6.11-1.27_FC3 with gnome). The
program runs well, except by the keyboard, which is
totally unresponsive in paraview (no key works: not
even bakcspace / delete keys; neither do short-cuts).

I followed the suggestion I received in the OpenFoam
forum about killing all processes related to language
input swithcing, to no avail. I also did my homework,
googling for "unresponsive keyboard" and implemented
some  tricks, but none of those work (it seems some
people with non-US keyboards have problems in Java). I
changed kbd_mode from -a to -u with the two other
options in between: nothing! I tryed with function
keys, dead keys and enabling/disabling the num, caps
ans scroll lock: nothing :(  (also changed keyboard
layouts, language, etc.)

I then downloaded 2.0 R3 and the problem is
consistently the same.

I can select, de-select with the mouse (I can paste
text by clicking with the center button), click on 
buttons, etc, OK.
I can input text in the "command" window in Paraview
(in both releases), but the rest of the text boxes are
just out of scope :(

Is there anything I can do to solve this, or any other
information that can be useful to track what's
happening??

I appreciate your help!

G.P.

Hallo,

I would like to add some functionality to paraview. Could someone please 
enlighten me on the following points?

Unless there is a particular reason for having a special version of 
external libs (vtk itself, tk etc.) that are shipped with the paraview's 
source, I would like to separate the code from external libs and compile 
paraview using externally available system versions (linux/debian). How 
do I proceed? It is not much clear for me which variables to set in the 
cmake config files.

thanks and regards,
Dominik

Message-ID: <20050625124501.GD1184@ddorf.de>

Hi,

I wonder if anybody could get his cfx 5.7.1 results into
paraview using some kind of ensight format.
In CFX you have a couple options:

Output Level:                               1 2 3
Use corrected Boudary nodes:                yes/no
Include variables only found on Boundaries: yes/no
Ensight Version:                            5 6 7
Format:                                     Unstructured Binary ASCII

I tried a coupled different options, but it seems that
paraview shuts down after pressing the accept button.

Do you have any idea which option I should use?

Best Greetings!
Fabian

This bug has been fixed a few days ago on the CVS trunk.
If you need to reuse the broken trace file, simply
insert
   $kw(vtkTemp660) AcceptCallback
before the line
   set kw(vtkTemp746) [$kw(vtkTemp5) GetAnimationManager]

Subject: [Paraview] 3-D image display question
Message-ID: <20050626195043.23641.qmail@web50804.mail.yahoo.com>

I am having trouble displaying a 3-D image in
Paraview. I have a 100x100x100 image, in which there
is a 50x50x50 cube of intensity = 1. On one surface of
this cube, there is a stripe, with intensity = 2.
However, when I open the file in Paraview and then use
"Contour" to view my cube, the stripe does not appear
a different color, but rather just as a protrusion
from the surface. How can I get it to display
different intensities as different colors?

Sincerely,
Vishal Majithia

I just posted on displaying different intensities as
different colors. I think I figured it out. If I
select "Calculate Gradient" and then "Color By: Point
Gradient(3)", I get what I'm looking for. Is that
correct?

Finally solved the problem, after killing htt_xbe
(http://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/iiimf-htt-xbe.html),
an implementation of the IIIM (for those of you who
need to change input methods: asian languages, etc).
Once I killed that process, I was able to start typing
into paraView's text boxes.

Not only that, but also the time that paraView spends
opening was significantly shortened (before it used to
take a lot of time in the splash screen).

For future reference: the process that is causing the
problem in Fedora (and likely in Debian also) is
htt_xbe; in SuSE it is scim (I got that in the
OpenFoam forum).

Cheers!
G.P.

Message-ID: <20050627090931.GC1184@ddorf.de>

Hi,

I have a surface mounted cube geometry and exported the data
from fluent to ensight (like mentioned a couple threads
above); reading it works fine.
Now, I want to display the pressure on the cube's surface,
but I am not able to select the cube, because it is
connected to the overall geometry. My idea was to draw a new
cube, but then there is no contour-filter anymore...

Does anybody have an idea?

Greetings!

If you haven't figured out what settings to use and you think that the
paraview is reader is buggy, can you please post a bug report at
http://www.paraview.org/Bug
and post a small datafile. If you have figured it out, can you please
post to the mailing list what you did?

Even though a few libraries (like hdf5) can be external, ParaView
requires internal Tcl/Tk and VTK. There are no cmake options to enable
external VTK and Tcl/Tk libraries. A few releases ago, we decided to
drop support for external libraries because it was causing too many
problems.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050627090346.02ee5a80@pop.biz.rr.com>

Hi All,

The ParaView 2.2 beta release (version 2.2.0) is now available for download 
from the ParaView web site: http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html.  It 
is also available through CVS; the tag is ParaView-2-2-0.  If you find bugs 
in the release, please e-mail me; preferably also send me a patch file to 
fix the problem.  There have been several changes since the 2.0 release of 
ParaView; they include the following.

* projected tetra unstructured grid volume rendering
* zsweep unstructured grid volume rendering
* choice of still render methods for unstructured grid volume rendering 
(ray cast, zsweep, projected tetra)
* RenderModules/Displays are now ServerManager proxies.
* Added support to animate the Camera.
*Enhance XML format to support Time Steps
* allow people to write XML file through a C or Fortran interface (more VTK 
than ParaView really).
* Comparative visualization. First prototype for comparative visualization 
framework.
* Better AMR support. Made many improvements and bug fixes to the AMR 
framework. Added several filters, including filters for extracting levels, 
coloring by levels. This is ongoing work.
* New SPCTH reader and new Extract CTH Part filter that work now by using a 
vtkHierarchicalDataSet instead of a vtkCTHData.  (Note: now, a file opened 
with extension .spcth will run the new reader, the exact same file with 
extension .amrspcth will run the old reader based on vtkCTHData.)
* Xdmf reader: now it can deals with "collection" of datasets by grouping 
them into a vtkHierarchicalDataSet.

The web site lists precompiled binaries for Windows and Linux.  We are 
working on one for Mac OSX.

Hope you enjoy the new release.

No, unfortunately I haven't figured it out. My hope is that
somebody uses cfx and has an idea. I would not say it is a
bug; I rather think that I don't find a solution.

Just a few more details about XML / TimeSteps support in VTK:

The idea behind was to be able to support TimeSteps using the same XML 
file format already being used. The challenge was to avoid splitting 
into multiple 'raw' files since they would not make sense on there own 
(at least not without a header). The solution was then to put all the 
data within the <DataArray> XML tag.

For example in binary mode (not appended), DataArray would look like:

<DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="1" format="binary">
   AwAAAAAA....
</DataArray>
<DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="4" format="binary">
   AwBBBBBB....
</DataArray>

For example in a UnstructuredGrid, you can define as many Points as you 
want, simple add another <DataArray> for each TimeStep.

Now all you need to do is define the TimeSteps above the <Piece> 
section, in the DataSet section, for instance:

<UnstructuredGrid TimeValues="0 20 40 60 80 100">

This means you have a dataset made of 6 timesteps. And the DataArray #0 
will refer to a TimeValue=0, TimeStep="1" would refer to TimeValue="20" ...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let say your Points is not changing over time, there is no need to 
duplicate the DataArray. So you would just do:

<Points>
   <DataArray type="Float32" format="binary">
     AwAAAAAA....
   </DataArray>
</Points>

If you do not specify 'TimeStep' within the DataArray tag (but you did 
define a TimeValue in the DataSet section), then it make the DataArray 
valid for all timestep. As a side note this is internally stored and 
data are not being reread.

As a side this is perfectly legal to defined it as:


<Points>
   <DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="0 1 2 3 4 5" format="binary">
     AwAAAAAA....
   </DataArray>
</Points>

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally this code is only a demonstration since the XML reader would be 
really slow on this type of XML file (binary, not appended). The 
recommended format (and the default in the VTK-XML Writer) is rather: 
Binary/Appended. All the remaining remarks remains true, we only need to 
introduced the 'offset' tag.

Let say that your Points is changing over time, like this:
- TimeStep 0 to 2 are the same,
- TimeStep 3 to 4 are the same,
- TimeStep 5 is the same as 0-2

You would then write in a Binary/Appended XML file:

<Points>
   <DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="0 1 2" format="appended" offset="0"/>
   <DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="3 4" format="appended" 
offset="129684"/>
   <DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="5" format="appended" offset="0"/>
</Points>

Therefore when moving on to the next timestep, the appended section 
gives us an offset in the file to directly point to, making the reading 
much faster.
Note: Again another valid solution could be to write the first DataArray as:
...
<DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="0 1 2 5" format="appended" offset="0"/>
...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION:
In the case of multiple PointData/CellData changing over time, you need 
to explictely specify a Name to differenciate the case.

<PointData>
   <DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="0" format="appended" offset="0"/>
   <DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="0" format="appended" offset="12"/>
   <DataArray type="Float32" TimeStep="1" format="appended" offset="34"/>
   ...
</PointData>

The third line could either describe the first PointData array or the 
second (there is no notion of implicit order). So you need to define a 
name to differenciate cases:


<PointData>
   <DataArray type="Float32" Name""foo" TimeStep="0" format="appended" 
offset="0"/>
   <DataArray type="Float32" Name="bar" TimeStep="0" format="appended" 
offset="12"/>
   <DataArray type="Float32" Name="bar" TimeStep="1" format="appended" 
offset="34"/>
   ...
</PointData>

Let me try to help you with something...

I did a very simple test with CFX 5.7.1 and Paraview read the file with
Ensight's format without any problem, so I'll let you know wich steps I've
followed:

CFX 5.7.1 (Win32)
=========
- Open the CFX solver manager
- Go to menu tools/export
- I set the options as described in the file placed at
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/cfx-screen.png

PARAVIEW 2.0.2 (Win32)
==============
- I set the options described in the file placed at
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/paraview-screen.png

I hope that it help you

Dear List Members -

Would someone with a successful 64bit IRIX build be willing to send me their CMake* files so I could have a peek at the settings used? Environmental vars would be useful too. I just want to know if there is something I am missing here.

BTW - do folks compile their own CMake for 64bit IRIX builds or just download the binaries from cmake.org?

I can't seem to get ParaView to correctly show its tick marks on cube axes.
In particular, the tick marks for the minimum and the maximum points in each
coordinate are always a little bit off their actual locations.  For example,
when I plot a simple cube using the following VTK file and enable Cube Axes,
the tick marks for 0s and 1s are located slightly inside of the edges rather
than being ON the edges. Am I missing something in how ParaView interprets
these points?  Thank you for any help.

Dave,

I actually 'fixed' the cube axes some time back. The rational behind
having the ticks 'inset' a bit is so that when two axes come to the same
endpoint the text does not overlap.

The old mode of operation was to inset the ticks and then actually show
a different value like .95 instead of 1. This pissed off most users to
no end because they couldn't actually see the true extents of their
data. I certainly believe that showing the actual end point values is
preferred...  The only question is how do you adjust the text so that is
does not overlap in a reasonable way. Probably the best solution is to
have the ticks at the end but then have the text offset enough to avoid
overlap. 

If the current mode bothers you, just enter in a feature/bug request. :)

Thanks for the info.  Another way would be to make the tick marks that come
together at a point to point at 90-deg from each other.

Thank you! It works in the second run. I did not used
version 7 (I thought it is too new) and probably the more
important thing: I didn't select 'little indian' in
paraview!

Best Greetings!

Subject: [Paraview] exporting in various 3D file formats
Message-ID: <15647740.1119953592129.JavaMail.www@wwinf0901>

Hi,
I would like to know if there is any possibility to export VTK data in 3d formats such as DXF, VRML ... and so on using paraview. Is there any plugin, module, or source code I could use to do so ?
My goal is to use VTK medical volumes gathered from a neuronavigation system and use them with 3d animation tools such as Blender, Wings 3D or Art Of Illusion. This is the reason why I need to export those data.
Sincerely,
Marie

Subject: [Paraview] C interface to write VTK XML files
Message-ID: <42C1622C.2020807@kitware.com>


Full documentation can be found in:

VTK/IO/vtkXMLWriterC.h
VTK/IO/vtkXMLWriterC.cxx

A simple test of writing a timestep cube can be found at:

VTK/IO/Testing/Cxx/TestXMLCInterface.c
-------------------------------------------

The basic idea was to provide an OO-like C interface to access the 
vtkXML*Writer classes. The C interface hold a reference to the 
vtkDataSet you are writting. So the main difference between a C++ code 
and the equivalent C code is that you are passing structure directly to 
the writer (instead of creating a vtkDataSet).

For example the C++ code:

vtkXMLWriter *writer = vtkXMLWriter::New();
vtkUnstructuredGrid *ug = vtkUnstructuredGrid::New();
writer->SetInput( ug );
writer->SetFileName( "bla.vtu" );
ug->SetPoints( mypoints );
...
writer->Write();

becomes:

vtkXMLWriterC* writer = vtkXMLWriterC_New();
/* #define VTK_UNSTRUCTURED_GRID               4 */
vtkXMLWriterC_SetDataObjectType(writer, 4);
vtkXMLWriterC_SetFileName(writer, "bla.vtu");
vtkXMLWriterC_SetPoints(writer, 10, mypoints_raw_pointer, NPOINTS);
...
vtkXMLWriterC_Write(writer);

looking at the source code (GUI/Client/vtkPVRenderView.cxx) clarifies this:

void vtkPVRenderView::SetCameraState(float p0, float p1, float p2,
                                     float fp0, float fp1, float fp2,
                                     float up0, float up1, float up2)
{
  vtkCamera *cam;

  // This is to trace effects of loaded scripts.
  this->GetTraceHelper()->AddEntry(
    "$kw(%s) SetCameraState %.3f %.3f %.3f  %.3f %.3f %.3f  %.3f %.3f
%.3f",
    this->GetTclName(), p0, p1, p2, fp0, fp1, fp2, up0, up1, up2);

  cam = this->GetRenderer()->GetActiveCamera();
  cam->SetPosition(p0, p1, p2);
  cam->SetFocalPoint(fp0, fp1, fp2);
  cam->SetViewUp(up0, up1, up2);

  this->EventuallyRender();
}

The first three arguments are the position of the camera.  The next three 
are the focal point.  The last three are the view up vector.  So in your 
example, the camera is located at (0.000, -5.000, 22.816).  It is looking 
at the point (0.000, -5.000, -9.968).  The up direction for the camera is 
the positive Y-axis.

   Hi I'm a graduate student at CU and I'm trying to convert data sets to vtk
format to be read by ParaView. Is there anyone who could show an example of a
vtk file format which contains an unstructured mesh with density, pressure,
velocity or displacements data sets for different time steps? Also a reference
text would be helpfull, I went through the web and did not have success in
finding any information I could use.

Thanks in advance for helping,

Manuel Barcelos.

Hi Manuel,

Have a look at http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf.  It describes the 
VTK data file formats.  Also, this message 
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2005-June/001662.html) posted 
yesterday on this mailing list discusses in the VTK XML file format.

Hi Manuel,

Let's keep the discussion on the ParaView users list.  The first link I 
sent you would not have information about time-dependent data sets in the 
legacy format because that format did not support time-dependent data.  The 
XML format has recently been updated to handle time-dependent data.

Subject: [Paraview] IRIX64 64bit parallel build success!
Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA969@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Dear list members -

I was finally able to get a good (99% of tests passed) 64bit parallel build of ParaView under IRIX64. For the other newbies out there, my procedure was as follows:

Download CMake from CVS (this seemed to be the critical step)
Set the following environmental vars 
 CXX=CC
 CC=c99
 CXXFLAGS=-64
 CFLAGS=-64 -LANG:std=ON
 FFLAGS=-64
 LDFLAGS=-64
Export the environmental vars and run ./boostrap
gmake && gmake install

This produces a 64bit cmake and ccmake - the curses lib was found automagically.

I then downloaded paraview from CVS (I still had the environmental vars set), performed an out-of-source build with ccmake and turned on VTK_USE_PARALLEL and VTK_USE_MPI; all 64bit libs were found properly. gmake and gmake test showed 99% of the test passing, with the last two volrendering tests failing. It's not perfect but better than what I was getting, thats for sure.

I hope this is of use to someone else out there; If anyone has any comments or suggestions, please let me know and I'll try to get something final posted in the WIKI next week.  Thanks to all who helped me on this, especially Berk Geveci - I'm sorry it took so long with so many messages.

All the best -
Ken

Hi Ryan,

I'm copying the ParaView users'  list on this in case other people are 
interested.

I had no problems getting the same mp2 file to play on both Windows and 
Linux.  On Windows, I use the Windows Media Player, and on Linux, I use 
Totem Movie Player.

Hello,

I tried to run ParaView in stereo mode on a linux and a windows
computer. But in the actual version (CVS) the red-green stereo view
semms to be only from one "eye". In version 2.02 this has worked fine on
both OS.

What change?

There seems to be a bug in the ParaView stereo rendering. I will look at 
it and get back.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050629114453.02c26458@pop.mcs.anl.gov>


So.  I've slapped together a Flash-to-AMR reader for ParaView.

(This image, http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~hudson/htmlbase/pvreader/sedovcorner_blocks_alllevels.jpg, shows all blocks (on all of 4 levels).
This image, http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~hudson/htmlbase/pvreader/sedovcorner_cells_lev3.jpg, show cells at the 4th level.)

There are two AMR filters for which I can add icons to the top of the paraview window:  one for showing outlines of all AMR blocks, and one for extracting the outer surface from am AMR dataset.  The icons are ghosted out and the filters unavailable.  There are also several AMR filters under the filter menu, but these are specified as "CTH AMR" filters.

1       Are the icon-ed filters really "CTH AMR" filters?
2       I assume I can't expect to use these on my flavor of AMR data.  Is that correct?

3       Should I be able to filter my AMR data -- either all levels or just one extracted level -- with the cutting and contour filters?

Thanks.

Let me try to help you with something...

I did a very simple test with CFX 5.7.1 and Paraview read the file with
Ensight's format without any problem, so I'll let you know wich steps I've
followed:

CFX 5.7.1 (Win32)
=========
- Open the CFX solver manager
- Go to menu tools/export
- I set the options as described in the file attached (cfx-screen.png)

PARAVIEW 2.0.2 (Win32)
==============
- I set the options described in the file attached (paraview-screen.png)

I hope that it help you

No, unfortunately I haven't figured it out. My hope is that somebody uses
cfx and has an idea. I would not say it is a bug; I rather think that I
don't find a solution.

maybe paraview is getting the wrong run-time c++ library? checking
dependency with ldd might help. if you post you CMakeCache.txt and the
result of ldd, someone might have an idea.

I could not get the screenshots but I am assuming the reader is
working as expected. In that case,
* most regular filters, including contour, cut, clip should work. If
your data is cell centered, you have to run cell data to point data
first. Some will not function properly: streamlines, probe, glyph. I
am working on getting those to work

* there are some special filters: level scalars, extract level, extract datasets

It looks like you created a special tcl script to put the name of a
file on the annotation. However, this script hardcodes the name of the
reader (PVDReader0). I am guessing that when you load the script, you
get a different name. Maybe because you already had another reader. I
don't know how to get around it other than deleting the offending
lines from the script. I hope to work on better annotation support in
the future but I don't know when I will have the time.

The easiest thing would be to write a small VTK script (in your
language of choice, Tcl, python) that converts VTK file format to VRML
or another file format you prefer. Refer to online VTK documentation
for the list of writers/exporters.

Is there any other reason, as it displays the correct information, and
works just fine.  The name is also PVDReader0, so that is not the issue?

Just a quick note, by X11 we mean the official X11 release from Apple:

http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/x11formacosx.html

This paraview release will not work using fink's Xfree86 package.
