Hi Bane,

I'm using the binary version of Paraview available in Kitware's website, so
I don't know much about what should be written in the C code.
But in the xml, I'm using this and it works perfectly:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="filters">
    <SourceProxy class="vtkPythonProgrammableFilter"
                 label="toto"
                 name="To To">
  <InputProperty clean_command="RemoveAllInputs"
                     command="AddInputConnection"
                     multiple_input="2"
                     name="Inputs">
<ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
<Group name="sources" />
<Group name="filters" />
  </ProxyGroupDomain>
  </InputProperty>
...

Hope this helps,

Ga?l

Message-ID: <2B61FBB88A39B549BA8029E6EDC5B4A1249972@MTLWAEXCH005.ca.aero.bombardier.net>

Hi All,

I've recently installed the most full-featured version of Catalyst available on the website, but I noticed it's lacking a lot of filters that I need very much (streamlines, for example).  I understand the installed packages are fully customizable, but can't find any good documentation on how to go about doing this.   Is this as simple as enabling different options in the cmake.sh script? And if so, is there a complete list of the filters in paraview and the modules that contain them somewhere?

Cheers,
Gregg

Hi Mark,

If you want to create images from Catalyst runs you'll probably want to
build the ParaView that you're linking to with either OSMesa or EGL (and Qt
disabled). This gets around needing the X context for rendering since I
believe running with offscreen enabled is not sufficient. EGL comes with
most of the NVIDIA drivers -- see
https://blog.kitware.com/off-screen-rendering-through-the-native-platform-interface-egl/
for how to build PV with it. If you want to go the OSMesa route I'd
recommend using the ParaView superbuild (
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild) to build it for
you.

Does this answer your question? I just got back from vacation and am trying
to catch up on more things than my brain can currently handle so let me
know if you have more questions.

Best,
Andy

Hi Andy,

Welcome back from hols!

This actually missed the question.

I assume that we get whatever pvserver up and running in parallel 
(generally have indeed used a pvserver build with mesa and llvmpipe 
rendering), how do we attach to it from catalyst?

Using a GUI "connect" button seems pointless/self-defeating, but how can 
I convey to catalyst that I'd like to connect to a particular server?

Cheers,

/mark

Hi Gregg,

You can always use a full build of ParaView for Catalyst to make sure you
get all of the filters available during Catalyst runs.

There is information at
https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-catalyst-editions-what-are-they/ which
gives details about the editions but there's currently not a lot of details
on how to make your own edition. Editing the cmake.sh script to add in more
VTK filters will likely not work as the Catalyst editions don't even have
all of the source code from the ParaView source.

As for finding the full list of filters and modules available, the blog
post has some of that but it's changed some. My recommendation would be to
build an edition with Python enabled and then use pvpython to see what's
available. Alternatively you could look at files like filters.xml in the
Catalyst source code to see what's there. It's not ideal but allows you to
check on stuff before actually running a simulation.

Best,
Andy

Hi Andrea,

The correct line would be :

clipper.PreserveInputCells(True)

Hi Mark,

With Catalyst you only connect the running simulation to a pvserver if
you're using ParaView Live to do a connection from the GUI to the
simulation.

If you're running Catalyst in "batch" the in situ operations are done in
the same process space as the simulation and no pvserver process is needed.

Best,
Andy

Some users at NERSC already requested it! FYI, I ran into an issue when 
trying to install, some missing symbols from the VisIt readers. Seems 
some files are missing? I worked around by editing the cmake code to 
avoid VISIT_STATIC and things went fine after that.

here's the error:

ISAV 2018: In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and
Visualization

Held in conjunction with SC18: The International Conference on High
Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, Dallas, Texas,
U.S.A.


ISAV 2018 --  <http://dav.lbl.gov/events/ISAV2018/>
http://dav.lbl.gov/events/ISAV2018/      


 

Full-day 9:00 AM - 5:30 PM Monday 12 Nov 2018


Workshop Theme


The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ analysis
and visualization is  due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings,
where data is analyzed/visualized while  being generated, without first
storing to a file system. Second is the potential for increased  accuracy,
where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some complex
behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all
available resources, CPUs and accelerators, in the computation of analysis
products. 

 

The workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners from
industry, academia, and government laboratories developing, applying, and
deploying in situ methods in extreme-scale, high performance computing. The
goal is to present research findings, lessons learned, and insights related
to developing and applying in situ methods and infrastructure across a range
of science and engineering applications in HPC environments; to discuss
topics like opportunities presented by new architectures, existing
infrastructure needs, requirements, and gaps, and experiences to foster and
enable in situ analysis and visualization; to serve as a "center of gravity"
for researchers, practitioners, and users/consumers of in situ methods and
infrastructure in the HPC space.


Participation/Call for Papers and Oral Presentations


We invite two types of submissions to ISAV 2018: (1) short, 4-page papers
that present research results, that identify opportunities or challenges,
and that present case studies/best practices for in situ
methods/infrastructure in the areas of data management, analysis and
visualization; (2) lightning presentation submission, consisting of a 1- or
2-page submission, for a brief oral presentation at the workshop. Short
papers will appear in the workshop proceedings and will be invited to give
an oral presentation of 15 to 20 minutes; lightning round submissions that
are invited to present at the workshop will have author names and titles
included as part of the proceedings. Submissions of both types are welcome
that fall within one or more areas of interest, as follows: 

 

Areas of interest for ISAV, include, but are not limited to:


In situ infrastructures

*	Current Systems: production quality, research prototypes
*	Opportunities
*	Gaps


System resources, hardware, and emerging architectures

*	Enabling Hardware
*	Hardware and architectures that provide opportunities for In situ
processing, such as burst buffers, staging computations on I/O nodes,
sharing cores within a node for both simulation and in situ processing


Methods/algorithms/applications/Case studies

*	Best practices
*	Analysis: feature detection, statistical methods, temporal methods,
geometric methods
*	Visualization: information visualization, scientific visualization,
time-varying methods
*	Data reduction/compression
*	Examples/case studies of solving a specific science challenge with
in situ methods/infrastructure.


Simulation

*	Integration:data modeling, software-engineering
*	Resilience: error detection, fault recovery
*	Workflows for supporting complex in situ processing pipelines


Requirements

*	Preserve important elements
*	Significantly reduce the data size
*	Flexibility for post-processing exploration


Review Process


All submissions will undergo a peer-review process consisting of three
reviews by experts in the field, and evaluated according to relevance to the
workshop theme, technical soundness, creativity, originality, and
impactfulness of method/results. Lightning round submissions will be
evaluated primarily for relevance to the workshop.


Submission Process


Authors are invited to submit papers of at most 4 pages in PDF format,
excluding references, and lightning presentations of at most 2 pages in PDF
format, excluding references. Papers must be submitted in PDF format
(readable by Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 and higher) and formatted for 8.5" x
11" (U.S. Letter). 

A Latex template will be provided via the submission website,
<https://submissions.supercomputing.org/>
https://submissions.supercomputing.org, and via workshop website,
<http://dav.lbl.gov/events/ISAV2018/> http://dav.lbl.gov/events/ISAV2018/.

We believe that reproducible science is essential, and that SC should be a
leader in this effort. As a consequence ISAV 2018 participates in the SC
reproducibility initiative and encourages submitters to include an appendix
with reproducibility information. While we will not disqualify a paper based
on information provided or not provided in this appendix, nor if the
appendix is not available, the availability and quality of an appendix will
be used in ranking a paper. For more information, see the
<http://dav.lbl.gov/events/ISAV2018/reproducibility-faq.html> ISAV 2018
reproducibility FAQ.

Papers must be self-contained and provide the technical substance required
for the program committee to evaluate their contributions. Submitted papers
must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under
consideration for another conference or a journal. See the
<http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/> ACM Prior Publication Policy for
more details. Papers can be submitted at
<https://submissions.supercomputing.org/>
https://submissions.supercomputing.org.


Publication in proceedings, presentation at the workshop


All paper submissions that receive favorable reviews will be included as
part of the workshop proceedings. Lightning round submission will not be
included as part of the proceedings.

 

Subject to the constraints of workshop length, some subset of the accepted
publications will be invited to give a brief oral presentation at the
workshop. The exact number of such presentations and their length will be
determined after the review process has been completed.

Subject: Find the intersection point between a connectivity and a stream tracer

Dear Users,
I need to find the intersection point between a connectivity surface (portion of a slice) and a stream tracer that runs through this.
I have tried the IntersectFragments it doesn?t work with stream tracer.
Someone of you have some suggestions?
Best regards,
Andrea

Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F685CBAEBBE@MBX211.d.ethz.ch>

ParaView 5.5 Release Notes present a JSON-based reader for time series. I have prepared a meta-data file for a series of *vtu files, I called it name.vtu.series

but ParaView 5.5.1 does not present me with any choice of reader  which would accept it. Is there a compile option to enable, or what is the trick?

*.series are not listed as "Supported Files"

Here are the first few lines of my file:

{
  "file-series-version" : "1.0",
  "files" : [
{ "name" : "noname_0000000.vtu", "time" : 0.0 },
{ "name" : "noname_0000251.vtu", "time" : 0.0335713 },
{ "name" : "noname_0000358.vtu", "time" : 0.066844 },
{ "name" : "noname_0000440.vtu", "time" : 0.100014 },
..etc...
  ]
}
Any help would be appreciated.

Never, I'll answer my own question.
Must have been an operator error.

Selecting "All Files (*)" and simply double-clicking on the file name does the job.

That is a great addition to ParaView. Well done!

Paraview,

I am trying to have the index of the points that are selected and extracted displayed in the trace. They are seen in the Properties Bar on the right when the ExtractSelection1 is active, however they are not seen in the trace. How do I get this information into python script or the trace?
Thank you,

Andrea,

In fact, you can use the Slice filter itself to compute the intersection of
streamlines with a plane. Just apply a Slice filter to your StreamTracer
output, align the Slice with your desired plane, and you will get the
intersection points.

See the attached image that shows stream tracer output, the plane widget
from the Slice filter (red rectangle), and the intersection points depicted
with blue spherical glyphs.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Sarah,

I'm afraid that selections are not currently well supported in Python.
Because of that, they are not recorded in Python traces.

It is on our todo list to provide a real Python API for selections in one
of the next ParaView releases.

Best regards,
Cory

Cory,

If it does not show in the trace, is it possible to access those numbers through the python shell?

Hi Sarah,

I'm afraid that selections are not currently well supported in Python. Because of that, they are not recorded in Python traces.

It is on our todo list to provide a real Python API for selections in one of the next ParaView releases.

Best regards,
Cory

Alas, the situation is the same.

As a workaround, you can add a GenerateIds filter to your data to generate
point and cell IDs, and add an Extract Selection filter with Preserve
Topology on, which generates a 'vtkInsidedness' point and cell array
marking which points/cells have been selected. Then, you can add an Append
Attributes filter to both the GenerateIds and Extract Selection filters to
combine the IDs and vtkInsidedness arrays. Finally, add z Threshold filter
and threshold by the vtkInsidedness array. The result will be a data set
containing only selected cells and points with the original cell/point IDs.
You can then access these IDs through Python.

Hi ParaView community,

This is just a reminder that we are transitioning our community support
forums to

https://discourse.paraview.org/

Discourse is now the preferred place to post new topics and help requests.
In just a week of operation there are already a good number of discussions
taking place there.

By the way, if you prefer interacting via mailing list, Discourse provides
a mailing list mode that you can enable by following the guide Utkarsh
posted:

https://discourse.paraview.org/t/using-discourse-as-a-mailing-list/64

Thanks!

Hi Gregg,

Please keep the conversations on the mailing list so that everyone can
participate (also, emails get lost in my inbox so that can also delay a
quick response).

I believe that the Catalyst examples should compile properly with all of
the Catalyst editions (though I haven't tested them). If you were able to
use an OpenGL with some editions then that should work for any edition that
depends on OpenGL. Are you working with a Catalyst edition build directory
or an install directory? If you give me some more information on how to
reproduce the error I can try and track things down.

Also, what version of ParaView are you using?

Cheers,
Andy

Hi,I'm stuck with a problem concerning colors assignment to data.I've a list of 8 tensors (here represented as circular ellipsoids, see short vtk file below)I typically open the file and filter using ("tensor glyph").Now I would like to assign to each tensor glyph a unique color specified by an rgba sequence (e.g. 0.1 0.3 0.2 1)How can I do that? I tried to append a scalar lookup table followed by a rgba one but without successThanks? ?-Claudio

The indices of the points selected are in a field called "vtkOriginalPointIds". It is a field with a special meaning and is hidden in some cases.

if you write the selected data to disk, it will show up as field "vtkOriginalPointIds"

Consider the pvpython code below:

from paraview.simple import *

w = Wavelet()
w.UpdatePipeline()

selection=SelectPoints()
selection.QueryString="RTData <= 40"
selection.FieldType = 'POINT'
selection.UpdatePipelineInformation()

# create a new 'Extract Selection'
mySelection = ExtractSelection(Input=w, Selection=selection)
mySelection.UpdatePipeline()
SaveData("foo.vtk", mySelection)

and inspect the contents of foo.vtk, you will find your ids.

if you need more, I simply use a Python Calculator to rename the field and I can then access the array

passthru = PythonCalculator(Input = mySelection)
passthru.Expression = 'inputs[0].PointData["vtkOriginalPointIds"]'
passthru.ArrayAssociation = "Point Data"
passthru.ArrayName = 'ids'
passthru.UpdatePipeline()

passthru.GetPointDataInformation().GetArray("ids").GetName()

Thank you Cory for the answer,
Your idea works also if I have, instead of a slice, only a portion of a slice (I cut slices portions thanks to the connectivity filter)?
In the image attached, I have created a connectivity (in blue) of a slice and a streamline in red that crosses it.

Andrea,

In fact, you can use the Slice filter itself to compute the intersection of streamlines with a plane. Just apply a Slice filter to your StreamTracer output, align the Slice with your desired plane, and you will get the intersection points.

See the attached image that shows stream tracer output, the plane widget from the Slice filter (red rectangle), and the intersection points depicted with blue spherical glyphs.

Cory

Dear Users,
I need to find the intersection point between a connectivity surface (portion of a slice) and a stream tracer that runs through this.
I have tried the IntersectFragments it doesn?t work with stream tracer.
Someone of you have some suggestions?

Hey Andy,

Apologies, I must have hit ?reply? without thinking, rather than reply all.  I?ve actually managed to resolve that issue, it turned out to be a configuration issue with my build of OpenGL.

I do have another question though.  I?ve been playing around processing some data using Catalyst?s python scripting in parallel and the results aren?t quite what I expected.  What I?ve been using is a toy 50,000,000 node cube mesh with an arbitrary velocity field, and having Catalyst do some assorted processing ? taking cuts etc.  I?ve divided the mesh into 256 blocks using the VTKMultiBlockDataSet structure, on 256 cores.  But when I load the results into Paraview it only indicates 12 VTKBlocks on the VTBBlockColors filter. There are 256 divisions in the mesh, but 244 of them are duplicates, coloured with one of the 1st 12 colours.

Adding new lines to the color map, mapped to values >11, doesn?t appear to change anything.

I?m also not seeing much in the way  of performance variation when I use 13-256 cores, it?s only when I drop below 12 that things take appreciably longer.

Is Paraview by default only taking advantage of 12 cores at a time?  Is this something I can change?

Hi Gregg,

Please keep the conversations on the mailing list so that everyone can participate (also, emails get lost in my inbox so that can also delay a quick response).

I believe that the Catalyst examples should compile properly with all of the Catalyst editions (though I haven't tested them). If you were able to use an OpenGL with some editions then that should work for any edition that depends on OpenGL. Are you working with a Catalyst edition build directory or an install directory? If you give me some more information on how to reproduce the error I can try and track things down.

Also, what version of ParaView are you using?

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Andy,

Thanks for the information.  I had a full compile of Paraview running on the side just in case, I was just curious if there was an easy and efficient way to customize a Catalyst install.

I?ve since gotten Paraview compiled, but when I try to test the functionality using some of the included Catalyst examples (Examples/Catalyst) they don?t work.  Specifically several of them throw ?undefined reference? errors during compilation, referring to a couple of OpenGL files in the Paraview install.  These examples worked fine when I compiled them with the Catalyst build I was testing before.  Do these examples require a specific build of OpenGL (or are they incompatible with certain other modules)?

Thanks,
Gregg

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Adding Filters to Catalyst

Hi Gregg,

You can always use a full build of ParaView for Catalyst to make sure you get all of the filters available during Catalyst runs.

There is information at https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-catalyst-editions-what-are-they/ which gives details about the editions but there's currently not a lot of details on how to make your own edition. Editing the cmake.sh script to add in more VTK filters will likely not work as the Catalyst editions don't even have all of the source code from the ParaView source.

As for finding the full list of filters and modules available, the blog post has some of that but it's changed some. My recommendation would be to build an edition with Python enabled and then use pvpython to see what's available. Alternatively you could look at files like filters.xml in the Catalyst source code to see what's there. It's not ideal but allows you to check on stuff before actually running a simulation.

Best,
Andy

Hi All,

I?ve recently installed the most full-featured version of Catalyst available on the website, but I noticed it?s lacking a lot of filters that I need very much (streamlines, for example).  I understand the installed packages are fully customizable, but can?t find any good documentation on how to go about doing this.   Is this as simple as enabling different options in the cmake.sh script? And if so, is there a complete list of the filters in paraview and the modules that contain them somewhere?

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting Data Over Curves
Message-ID: <9CE36D33-5A20-4297-8FC3-3AB01D2C3B9D@pointwise.com>

I have a question about how to go about plotting a variable over a curve.  I have a solution for a half-symmetry model of a duct where the flow direction is aligned with the x-direction.  Along the symmetry plane, I would like to plot a variable along the upper duct wall and lower duct wall between an explicit range of values in the flow direction.

I?ve tried extracting the curves by first using the Extract Surface filter on my volume data, and then applying a slice along the symmetry plane.  This gives me all of the edges along the symmetry plane, and I can use the Plot Data filter along with a custom range for the x-axis.  However, I really need to isolate the curve along the upper wall from the lower wall, and my approach doesn?t quite get me what I wanted.  Is there a better way of doing this, or perhaps I?m overlooking another filter which will get me what I?m looking for.

Best Regards,



Zach Davis

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF and PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE=ON will reproduce the

Hi Gregg,

Catalyst will use all of the MPI ranks in the global communicator unless
you pass it another MPI communicator upon initialization. It sounds like
the data isn't getting constructed in the adaptor the way you think it is.
You may want to try the Process Id Scalars filter to see where the data is
really located and add some print statements in the adaptor to verify the
behavior.

Best,
Andy

No, my solution is for the special case of a plane. For your case, please
see my tip on our Discourse forum that will explain how to do this for your
portion of a slice:
https://discourse.paraview.org/t/compute-the-signed-distance-field-from-a-polygonal-mesh/123

Once you have followed the steps in the tip, apply a Contour filter to the
output of the Programmable Filter. Set the isovalue to 0 and the Contour By
property to Distance. The output will consist of your intersection points.
See the attached image where I have done this. The red spheres show the
intersection points.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Odd problem slicing/cutting complex polyhedron
Message-ID: <6D0F63C3-109B-4B80-9D50-0C1CDB7A02D6@googlemail.com>

Hi,

I have attached two files.  One is a single-cell complex polyhedron which I wish to be able to use and visualise (as is, without tessellation and tetrahedralization).  Using 5.5.0 this fails to slice/cut in paraview in any major plane.  Paraview complains about non-manifold (under-connected) edges.  To debug I wrote out as a vtkPolyData containing all the faces of this single cell polyhedron.  This polyData Slices/cuts just fine.  All faces added to the vtp file as VTK_POLYGON, likewise are added as a face-stream when added as a VTK_POLYHEDRON to the vtu file.  To be clear, I write the faces out to the vtp in the same loop I build the faces for the single cell vtu mesh, so they are carbon copies of the faces, including numbering, ordering etc.  I am aware there are more vertices in the file than need be (27 rather than 19), but it was easier...

My working assumption is that there is no problem visualising and working with cells of this type (non-convex) in paraview (real use cases includes a mesh with many of these types of cells).  Clarity on this point would also be good?

I believe paraview should work for concave cells and I suspect it?s a bug (either in paraview or my face-data) because if I use 5.4.1 (or indeed 5.2.0) I can clip the singleCell in the x-plane (with inside-out flag on/off) and I get the expected results. However, in the y and z planes I do not get the expected results and those versions either return an empty result or the whole cell.  I get no results in 5.5.0 regardless of plane.  Finally, I get no results in 5.5.1 either.  So it sort of used to work in earlier versions depending on the plane of slicing, but now does not. 

I?m not sure what I?m doing wrong, can somebody shed some light or spot an error in the attached file?  This may be linked to:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18003

Thanks again,
Andy

If we are looking for 5.5.2 bits:

In 5.5.1 it seems that I still need to patch 
VTK/ThirdParty/vtkm/vtk-m/CMake/VTKmDetermineVersion.cmake

(commit cf91ca520e38faa1afae5d0bcc6788b2b4660c3e)


I that Andy's catalyst changes might have made it in, but wasn't really 
surprised not to see them since they do change the API. Nonetheless, 
I'll express them as a wish:

CoProcessing/Catalyst/vtkCPProcessor.cxx
CoProcessing/Catalyst/vtkCPProcessor.h
CoProcessing/Catalyst/vtkCPXMLPWriterPipeline.cxx
Wrapping/Python/paraview/coprocessing.py

Subject: [Paraview] vtk renderer
Message-ID: <CABrYh3ofx_7QE31uMDViD+kL5rBaGhjpM9tnjwmXPOXdgET_CQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

I'm not sure if this is a VTK question or a Paraview question, so apologies
in advance. In a ParaViewWeb application, I have a vtkRenderer in a div in
another div, etc. The vtkRenderer seems to adjust when I make the window
it's in bigger or the container, but it does not resize when I make the
window smaller. Using the browser's element viewer, I can see the <canvas>
object inside, and see its width reach when I expand elements and refuse to
react when I contract the window or container.

When I create the vtk renderer, I use this code:

           this.renderers.push(VtkRenderer.newInstance({
                  client: this.model.pvwClient,
                  viewId: result,
                }) );

    ... and then later...

      SizeHelper.onSizeChange(() => {
        this.renderers[0].resize();
        this.renderers[1].resize();
      });
      SizeHelper.startListening();

I invoke the SizeHelper.triggerChange() method regularly and it seems to
work, though again only to make the renderer bigger.

Should I be resizing these with a direct call to some method? What is the
way I should be doing this?

Thank you,

 -Tom

Hi Tom,

That would be a ParaViewWeb question. The issue is related to the css for
your div that contains the renderer.
To allow the renderer to shrink you need to set "overflow: hidden;"
assuming the rest of the size of the div is defined by other constraints.

Hi Sebastien:

Looks like this:

            <div id="renderContainerTwo"
                 style={{position: 'relative',
                         height: '80vh',
                         overflow: 'hidden',
                         zIndex: '10',
                        }}
            />

Another data point: when I shrink or grow the window in the vertical, the
*height* of the canvas element changes in both directions, but the width
only changes when I grow the window and not when I shrink it. Maybe what
you're saying though is that I should travel up the hierarchy and see where
I'm setting heights and widths in non-parallel ways?

Thank you,

 -Tom

Andy,

ParaView uses vtkPolyhdron data-structure to store polyhedron.
As you can read on this page
<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPolyhedron.html#details>,
vtkPolyhdron requires:
*"The polyhedron should be watertight, non-self-intersecting and manifold
(each edge is used twice)."*

Clearly, your cell here is not watertight (see attached picture), so I fear
you won't be able to
process it correctly with VTK based tools.

Best,

The renderer will ask for its container size when you call resize() on it.
So if that container keep growing due to the setup of your css, the size
propagation won't go to the server as the container will never shrink.

You need to fix the width in some way like you did for the height. You can
use 50vw or use a mix of absolute/relative position in your dom hierarchy.

Hi Ga?l,

Thank you for your help! I was aware of this way to add multiple inputs to
a programmable filter and FYI if you would like to have a dialog appear in
the PV GUI to select the inputs in a non-arbitrary order then try making
several InputProperty attributes in the XML rather than using the
multiple_input variable.

Unfortunately, this still does not address my original issue. I need the
inputs to each be on their own port rather than multiple connections on a
single port. This is because I will implement the ability to select input
arrays from each port via drop down menus.

Does anyone know how to give the vtkPythonProgrammableFilter multiple input
ports or a means to select input arrays to process when having multiple
connections on one port? I have a robust means of selecting input arrays
for just one input but I cannot get it to work for more than one input.

Thank you,

Bane

Your filter creates errors in my case, I would like to know if it's a problem of my mesh or I'm using it the wrong way ...

Thank you Cory for the answer,
Your idea works also if I have, instead of a slice, only a portion of a slice (I cut slices portions thanks to the connectivity filter)?

No, my solution is for the special case of a plane. For your case, please see my tip on our Discourse forum that will explain how to do this for your portion of a slice: https://discourse.paraview.org/t/compute-the-signed-distance-field-from-a-polygonal-mesh/123

Once you have followed the steps in the tip, apply a Contour filter to the output of the Programmable Filter. Set the isovalue to 0 and the Contour By property to Distance. The output will consist of your intersection points. See the attached image where I have done this. The red spheres show the intersection points.

HTH,
Cory

In the image attached, I have created a connectivity (in blue) of a slice and a streamline in red that crosses it.

Andrea,

In fact, you can use the Slice filter itself to compute the intersection of streamlines with a plane. Just apply a Slice filter to your StreamTracer output, align the Slice with your desired plane, and you will get the intersection points.

See the attached image that shows stream tracer output, the plane widget from the Slice filter (red rectangle), and the intersection points depicted with blue spherical glyphs.

Subject: Find the intersection point between a connectivity and a stream tracer

Dear Users,
I need to find the intersection point between a connectivity surface (portion of a slice) and a stream tracer that runs through this.
I have tried the IntersectFragments it doesn?t work with stream tracer.
Someone of you have some suggestions?
Best regards,
Andrea

Subject: [Paraview] Exporting publication-quality images
Message-ID: <CAGnrKXuoKU=K2DFzgHixzSE-gRhSdZqRf+4gg6rTHWnsdohzXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have two main questions about publication-quality images. I got stuck in
making quality images for my journal article. Since, all my charts/render
views is in Paraview.

First, I am trying to export vector graphics such as postscript, SVG, or
PDF for chart view. In vector graphics, axes titles have wrong font type,
size and positions. Also, x-axis limits are not applied. I think the reason
of the wrong type and size is that I used MathText in the axis titles but I
don't know the reasons of the wrong position and limits for x axis. There
are two images with true (png) and false (vector) in attachment (Drive).
How can I export vector graphics with appearance of the Paraview rendering?
Additionally, I guess we can not export vector graphics for comparative
chart or render views because of disabling "export scenes" choice. Is there
really no way?

Second, if I prefer a raster format like tif/png, is it possible to adjust
DPI quality of the image not the image size? If not, do you have any
suggestions (including other than Paraview)?

Note: I tried Paraview v5.2, v5.3, v5.4 and v5.5. The problem happens in
all Paraview versions that I tried and all vector graphics formats.  Data
types are csv for chart view, OpenFOAM results for render view. I tested
"render text as paths" or other options in the export scene.

Thanks in advance,

Best regards,

Ahmet

Hi guys,

I am trying to calculate the gradient of an unstructed data set saved in 
vtk format with the function in the following:

Somehow I am not able to access the PointData of the solution. The error 
is always


*??? Grad_DMDu = dataAdp.PointData['Grad_DMDu']*
 ??? obj._dataset.Set(dataset.VTKObject)
 ??? TypeError: Set argument 1: method requires a VTK objec


So what am I doing wrong here?

Thanks in advance

Bane,

In your XML, instead of using `post_creation` and `argument`
attributes, just add a `input_ports="2"` attribute.

BTW, on-going work on Python algorithm will make this much easier. In
this example [1], one could simply pass in `nInputPorts=2` to require
two input ports. I plan to add example with multiple input ports
before this MR [2] gets merged.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Clip a domain using a close surface

Hi Andrea,
Here is an updated script to clip instead of cutting.
You will recover the volume of your main dataset which is inside the provided surface.
(if your are interested by what is outside, just change the InsideOut value)

import vtk.vtkPVVTKExtensionsDefault as ext



inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )

inpClip = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )

out = self.GetOutput()



clipper = ext.vtkPVMetaClipDataSet()

clipper.SetInputDataObject(inpMain)

clipper.SetInsideOut(True)

clipFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()

clipFunction.SetInput(inpClip)

clipper.SetClipFunction(clipFunction)

clipper.Update()



outData = clipper.GetOutputDataObject(0)

out.DeepCopy(outData)

I've included the state file and a dataset to test with. make sure to set the path to the dataset when loading the state file.
You may also want to take a look into the resample with dataset solution.
Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Thank you Mathieu for your answer,
When I tries your filter I obtain ?an intersection? between the sphere and my domain.
While the result that I would get is a clipped domain, I have included a Statefile for demonstration on what I would get.
Maybe I'm using your filter in a wrong way?

Hi Andrea,
This is achievable using a Programmable Filter, with the following script :

inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )

inpCut = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )

out = self.GetOutput()



cutter = vtk.vtkCutter()

cutter.SetInputDataObject( inpMain )

cutFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()

cutFunction.SetInput( inpCut )

cutter.SetCutFunction( cutFunction )

cutter.Update()



outData = cutter.GetOutputDataObject( 0 )

out.DeepCopy(outData)

(thanks @Yves Roger for providing it here :  https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-April/033903.html)

In case you do not know how to use the programmable filter in this case, I have included a StateFile that demonstrate it.
Notice that we are using an "output data type : vtkPolyData".

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Clip a domain using a close surface

Dear users,
I need to clip a domain with a close surface.
More in details I have a cfd domain with pressure and velocity field, I import a table of point and I create a closed surface using delunay3d filters.
At this stage, I would clip the computational domain using the close surface dividing the cfd domain or in the internal part of the close surface or in the external part.

I have tried using clip with scalars, but I am not able to understand how use it properly.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Andrea

Subject: [Paraview] Letters of Support for VTK proposal
Message-ID: <CAEiDrtU=f6ckrKoZ4NC4fViQv-EYVHOheNUofsYigzhW1iJEyQ@mail.gmail.com>

*Dear VTK Community-Kitware is submitting a VTK development grant proposal
to the NIH in early July, and we?d like you to send us a letter of support
for that proposal. This four year proposal aims to make significant
improvements to VTK including rendering enhancements (VR and AR), better
support for the web (such as VTK.js), improved data integration (supporting
deep learning systems and federated, distributed databases, for example),
and updated mechanisms for community support (improving the software and
contribution process, documentation).We are very excited about the proposal
since it will make a very positive impact on VTK, its community, and the
many applications that use VTK. Several years ago we received a similar
award and were able to revamp our rendering support (OpenGL), improve our
software processes, and lay the foundation for VTK.js (among other
achievements). Now, we can really use your help with our follow-on
proposal. Part of the strategy of our proposal is to demonstrate to the
reviewers that VTK plays a critical part in medical innovation. Along this
line, we want to hear from the developers and users of VTK, so that they
can indicate their support for VTK and our proposal.If you?d like to help,
we have included three example letters.  Please modify one of them to fit
your circumstances, copy it to your letterhead, sign it, and then send it
(a scanned pdf is fine) directly to me by June 30. These letters in no way
obligate you or your employer, they simply state ?VTK is great and
important to my work.? Also, don?t worry if you are not doing biomedical
research, we want to hear from everybody. Note that this information (i.e.,
the names of endorsers) is considered private, only the writers of the VTK
proposal and the NIH review team will see this information.If you have any
questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly. Thanks and
we hope to hear from you (by June 30). Feel free to forward this to friends
and family.Sincerely,Will SchroederStephen AylwardKen MartinExample support
letters follow:Example 1=========Dr. Ken MartinKitware, Inc.28 Corporate
DriveClifton Park, NY 12065, USADear Dr. Martin,I am writing to indicate my
support for your NIH proposal for the continued development of VTK. The VTK
standards and software are absolutely critical to my lab, the ___ Lab at
___ University, and to my collaborators around the world. Even as we speak,
I am working on a project involving complex visualizations using 3D Slicer,
Osirix, ParaView, and ITKSnap (which are largely built on VTK). Several of
my students also use VTK software libraries to write customized user
interfaces and visualizations for my scientific and clinical collaborators.
Our most recent application was for a physiologist who wanted to explore
very specialized data related to the movement of the tongue in speech after
glossectomy surgery.There are many worthy software projects under
development around the world, but very few who can claim to be
foundational. VTK can claim this, and I'm certain it can claim to be at the
core of hundreds of software products that will be used by many biomedical
researchers and thousands more that will be developed and used in-house.
The complexity of visualization tasks has continued to grow with the volume
of data and its connections across scales and from anatomy to function and
from individuals to populations. VTK is keeping up with the demand?leading
the rest, in fact?and should be a high priority for continued
funding.Example 2=========Dr. William J. SchroederKitware, Inc.28 Corporate
DriveClifton Park, NY 12065, USADear Dr. Schroeder,I enthusiastically
endorse your proposed effort to support and improve VTK. We use this open
source software in our work and have found it extremely helpful as we
create new technological solutions. We have developed a software
application that is currently being used by around the world for scientific
data visualization to gain new insights. Your Visualization Toolkit has
provided the software tools needed to develop that application that has
satisfied the needs of a very diverse customer base. We definitely would be
interested in your proposed VR/AR enhancements and improved integration
with web services. VTK fills a vital role in the international community?s
scientific computing infrastructure; additional developments along the
lines that you propose will certainly accelerate innovation.Example
3=========Dr. Stephen R. AylwardKitware, Inc.101 East Weaver St, Ste
G4Carrboro, NC  27510, USADear Dr. Aylward,I am writing in ardent support
of your NIH proposal to continue the development, enhancement, and
dissemination of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Not only do I use it in
several projects myself, but I have found that it fosters the dissemination
and extension of research by allowing the community to efficiently
reproduce research, to easily combine contributions in unexpected ways, and
to transfer research into production. Developing and maintaining a project
as large and complex as VTK while fostering such an active community is a
breathtaking achievement, and I hope Kitware obtains the funding it needs
to keep this work up. *

Hi Mark,

The VTKm patch issue should be resolved in 5.5.2. I'd love to have the
Catalyst API changes in 5.5.2 but that's a bit much for a patch change. 5.6
will have it though and that's due out in September so people won't have to
wait too long for that.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] No labels on Axes Grid to show object dimensions
Message-ID: <CAApgMT4ti9GvcK1Qo8s0yfA45ZUQFAGC7i+Ejjcg1ogbOT=-dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a problem with Axes Grid under view.

I would like to show the size of my object with some axes/ruler at the
edges just to show the reader the dimensions of the domain that I am
working on.

I guess Axes Grid on under View is designed for this but if I check the
box, I can see the white lines around my object but it has no labels.
Attached is a screen shot without the labels.

Any comments are appreciated.

BR,
Umut

Hi Umut,

That is odd. What do you get when you click on the "Edit" button to the
right of the "Axes Grid"? You should be able to turn on and off various
labels in that (hit the advanced/gear icon to see the full set of controls)
there. The defaults should be set with  "Axes To Label" all on. Only by
turning them off can I reproduce something like what you are getting.

Utkarsh,

Using the  `input_ports="2"` attribute did the trick!

The changes in your merge request have me really excited! Would this make
it possible to make a class like `class
PythonSuperquadricSource(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase)` in a .py file and load
that as a plugin at runtime? If so AWESOME!

Thank you for you help,

Bane

Bane,

In your XML, instead of using `post_creation` and `argument`
attributes, just add a `input_ports="2"` attribute.

BTW, on-going work on Python algorithm will make this much easier. In
this example [1], one could simply pass in `nInputPorts=2` to require
two input ports. I plan to add example with multiple input ports
before this MR [2] gets merged.

Glad to hear.

Indeed. In fact, your py file can have multiple classes and all of
them will get added, be they filters, sources, reader or writers. The
MR is pretty close to final, I just need to add more docs, examples
and missing decorators. I imagine we will continue to add more
decorators as time progresses, but I want to have an initial set that
covers common use-cases.

All,

Okay, I'm guilty, I have not delved into the View, Display, Representation objects in PV, I mostly compute stuff.

However, I would like to know if it is possible within a Programmable Filter to set the variable (Cell, Point, or Field) that the result will be colored by?

Thanks for any hints.

Dear David,
Thanks for the quick reply. Well, they all seem to be turned on like you
mentioned. I could not manage to get a screenshot of that at the moment,
just took a picture with the phone.(since I selecting another button the
pane under Axes to Label dissappears.)
I guess in previous releases there was sth like "Show Cube Axes", but I
could only find pointers to Axes Grid.
BR,
Umut

So, on a related note, I just tried the .series format with silo files, but
it doesn't seem to work.

I get the correct filename and time in the 'Info' tab as I click the
forward timestep button, but I'm never given an option of which silo
variables to load, and no silo file loads.

Is the .series file only for certain filetypes?

Hi Claudio,
I have never done this, but it sounds like you are looking for an annotation, rather than a continuous color map.  Could you flip to annotations, then color using an int?

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] rgb lookup table

Hi,
I'm stuck with a problem concerning colors assignment to data.
I've a list of 8 tensors (here represented as circular ellipsoids, see short vtk file below)
I typically open the file and filter using ("tensor glyph").
Now I would like to assign to each tensor glyph a unique color specified by an rgba sequence (e.g. 0.1 0.3 0.2 1)
How can I do that? I tried to append a scalar lookup table followed by a rgba one but without success
Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Exporting publication-quality images from Paraview
Message-ID: <CAGnrKXvTiWKqhusgsLHHN=54VOD4q9EO+5ijB26+oGHt-3rDHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have two main questions about publication-quality images. I got stuck in
making quality images for my journal article. Since, all my charts/render
views is in Paraview.

First, I am trying to export vector graphics such as postscript, SVG, or
PDF for chart view. In vector graphics, axes titles have wrong font type,
size and positions. Also, x-axis limits are not applied. I think the reason
of the wrong type and size is that I used MathText in the axis titles but I
don't know the reasons of the wrong position and limits for x axis. There
are two images with true (png) and false (vector) in attachment (Drive).
How can I export vector graphics with appearance of the Paraview rendering?
Additionally, I guess we can not export vector graphics for comparative
chart or render views because of disabling "export scenes" choice. Is there
really no way?

Second, if I prefer a raster format like tif/png, is it possible to adjust
DPI quality of the image not the image size? If not, do you have any
suggestions (including other than Paraview)?

Note: I tried Paraview v5.2, v5.3, v5.4 and v5.5. The problem happens in
all Paraview versions that I tried and all vector graphics formats.  Data
types are csv for chart view, OpenFOAM results for render view. I tested
"render text as paths" or other options in the export scene.

Thanks in advance,

Best regards,

Ahmet

Hi,

I've defined a plugin that gathers a set of python programmable filters
into an XML file.

How can I setup in this XML file the version number that ParaView displays
in the plugin manager window ?

Hi!

Looking here:
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Embedding_Python_Source_as_Modules
it seems like you can specify the version number with CMakeLists.txt, but
not with the XML file.

HTH,
Aron

Hi Ahmet,

I don't know much about the vector graphics exports.  I'll leave that for
others on the list to answer.

I have used Apple's Preview application before to adjust the DPI of
VTK/ParaView's saved images.  IIRC it supports saving the image with a new
DPI, so if you can get access to a Mac you could try that.

Loic,

I believe the Tools/Plugin Manager will display the name of the .xml file.

So you could make the file as MyPlugin_v8.3.xml and "MyPlugin_v8.3 will be displayed in the Plugin Manager.

There is a ansys to vtk python module available online.

Could this be integrated into paraview?

Hi Sebastien:

I'm afraid I don't understand what you're saying here. Why would the
container grow due to the setup of my css? I thought the way it works is
that I resize the window, and SIzeHelper.onSizeChange() gets called. I use
that function to call .resize() on the renderers and the vertical works
perfectly, but the horizontal only goes one direction.

Here's the entire hierarchy. There is no external CSS, so this is
everything. I went back and tried to make the height and width parallel,
set the same way. What I observe is that as I change the window size, the
height (the number '686' in the image) changes when I make the window
smaller or larger, but the width (the number '565') only changes when I
make the window wider. When I make the window narrower I have to refresh
the page to get the new width and then it looks right. Can you identify
what isn't the same between width and height in my hierarchy?

Thanks,

 -Tom

I should also add that the reason I need this is because I'm trying to
toggle the visibility of one of two side-by-side vtkRenderer objects. But
what happens is that when I make one of them invisible, the container of
the other assumes a width of 100% and the VtkRenderer also gets wide. But
then when I make it visible again, the VTKRenderer is a fixed width and
will not shrink to fit its window.

I imagine I can also deal with this by explicitly setting the width of the
VtkRenderer, but don't understand why it doesn't work automatically. But
maybe setting it explicitly is the preferred method?

Thanks,

 -Tom

Subject: [Paraview] Font troubles + fontconfig errors and warnings
Message-ID: <3e09a95e-1355-9432-0531-10d28f274bed@surfsara.nl>

Hi,

With versions of PV based on Qt5 I get quite a few errors/warnings in 
the console, as shown below. Furthermore, the actual font used in the UI 
becomes a pretty horrible serif-based one. I saw a bug report from 2016 
mentioning that the fontconfig version PV used might be newer than what 
is installed on the OS, but here the opposite might be true. My Arch 
system has fontconfig 2.13.0, which is the newest. The issue happens 
with the official binaries for 5.3.0, 5.4.1 and 5.5.1. The regular Qt 
Assistant for the installed Qt5 does not have any issues, so this 
appears to be a PV specific problem. Is there any way to force a better 
font, without having to build a PV version myself?

Thanks in advance for any help,
Paul

This issue is already listed here :

We indeed need to upgrade fontconfig in our ParaView build.

Ok, turns out this is a CSS question. Table-layout: 'fixed' is the answer
(in the display: 'table' div), in case someone else is ever wondering why
their cells grow but do not shrink. Sorry for the extra traffic.

Subject: [Paraview] setting camera angles for the same projected view
Message-ID: <CAApgMT42E6Jf6WZmT4AheB7wGork666tc75K=Fz9ph-AWbPi6w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

For my thesis, I am trying to get some screenshots of some finite element
models from paraview.

I would like to use the same camera angles for different views of the same
model for instance.

At the moment, I am doing it by hand, is there a way to unify the selection
of the camera angles by some settings where I can be sure that projection
oriented the same in my outputs.

Thanks in advance.

You can use the "camera configs" accessible from the
?[image: image.png] button. Pre 5.5., only 4 camera locations could be
saved. Since 5.5 (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17951),
arbitrarily many are supported.

Hello,

Please use the Camera Settings dialog for that, next to the 2D/3D selector

Hi Tom,

Glad you figure it out. What I was previously trying to say was that in you
CSS definition you were not providing any constraint on the width and the
behavior of a container was to match the width of what it contains unless
the contains is smaller than the width of the window (block). So the parent
container has no reason to shrink since it always contains a canvas of a
fixed size. Unless you tell that container that it should not be affected
by the size of what is inside.

Claudio,

ParaView ignores the LOOKUP_TABLE you specified in your VTK file. Instead,
elaborating on what Alan suggested, you can do the following:

* Load your data
* Add a "Tensor Glyph" filter.
* Color the "Tensor Glyph" filter by the "sample_scalars" array. This
should actually happen by default.
* Open up the Color Map Editor.
* Near the top of the Color Map Editor dialog, check the box "Interpret
Values as Categories"
* Under "Annotations", click on the toolbutton "Add active values from
selected sources". This will assign a unique color to each glyph. You can
customize these colors by clicking on the circular color swatch in the left
column of the Annotations table.

Hope that helps,
Cory

This line looks suspicious to me:

rawData = rawData.Get

It looks like you are setting `rawData` to a function `rawData.Get`. That
should be a syntax error.

If fixing that doesn't help, what does

print(type(rawData))

produce?

Regarding the axis label problem....

I had the same issue with earlier Versions. Running paraview in mesa 
mode helped me out there, with the new PV Version 5.5 I do not have such 
problems any more.

Umut,

There was a post a while ago with a similar issue. The solution was to go
to Edit > Settings... and under the "Render View" tab, click the gear to
access the "Depth Peeling" and "Depth Peeling for Volumes" options and turn
them off. Try that and see if the axis labels appear.

Thanks,
Cory

Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7AEA436B79@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello ParaView,

I can't seem to get either ParticlePath or StreakLine to produce output which changes as the flow changes. The data is a series of VTK legacy files. I read https://blog.kitware.com/improvements-in-path-tracing-in-vtk/ but I feel like I'm missing something. If I add a ParticlePath filter, change the Termination time to > 0, hit apply, then some paths get created as polylines. I then hit play, and nothing happens. Is that expected?

I can get both Particle Tracer and Temporal Particles to PathLines to generate points and polylines which evolve with the flow. I can stay with these but was curious about the other two filters.


Thanks,
Mark

I think I have seen stuff like this in the past.  I am assuming you are on ParaView 5.5.X.  First thing to try is to reset ParaView to default settings.  Try Edit/ Reset to Default Settings/ Yes, and Backup Current Settings.  Then, restart ParaView, and try again.  Does that help?  If not, maybe try updating your graphics drivers?

Hi all,

I have a problem with Axes Grid under view.

I would like to show the size of my object with some axes/ruler at the edges just to show the reader the dimensions of the domain that I am working on.

I guess Axes Grid on under View is designed for this but if I check the box, I can see the white lines around my object but it has no labels. Attached is a screen shot without the labels.

Any comments are appreciated.

BR,

That was the trick ;-)

Subject: [Paraview] warp by vector field(displacement) with pressure field
 problem
Message-ID: <CAApgMT5Nk2m_1iHsgS6RNSAMfy_yh8X21UN4O1Na96D9-7+UgA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

On a 2d model, I am trying to plot some mode shape for a coupled
fluid-structure problem where a beam is coupled to a cavity domain. I have
two variables for this problem: scalar pressure variable for the cavity and
the displacement vectors for the beam at the top edges of the domain.

I am writing the attached vtk input file with my post processing codes.

And the result is somewhat as expected except that another pressure profile
with an undeformed structural part is also visible with what I actually
want to get. Please see the attached screenshot with the settings and
visible fields.

Do I have a misunderstanding to accomplish this task. At the end, I would
like to show the pressure profile which is a scalar field in the file along
with the displacement field on the beam at the top edge.

I was thinking if there is deformed+undeformed visibility selection
somehwere or not, maybe the issue is completely something else.

Any comments are appreciated.

BR,
Umut

P.S. For a decent view for the deformed vector field, you can set the scale
factor of the warpbyvector field to 0.1 to 0.15

Umut,

Great, glad to hear it.

Which of the settings, "Depth Peeling" or "Depth Peeling for Volumes",
caused the problem? Or was it both?

I'll fill an issue on our bug tracker, but I would like some more
information to help track down why this is happening. In addition, could
you post information about your graphics accelerator? You can find this in
ParaView's About dialog available through the Help menu.

Thanks,
Cory

Did you turn off the visibility of the original file? I suspect you are
seeing the original undisplaced surface in that location, and it is
covering up the warped surface.

Umit,

I took a look at your data, and the warp by vector filter is behaving exactly how I would expect.

The displacement field in your data is 0 everywhere except at the top edge. Thus, when you apply the warp the top edge will move and everything else will stay fixed where it is. In the middle of the top edge the warp vectors are pushing down into the rest of the mesh. This is causing some self-intersection with the mesh, which is why you are seeing the pressure profile sticking out the top.

You can use the Threshold filter to remove all cells that are not moving. However, that is only going to leave the top layer of cells, which I?m not sure what you want.

Hi Lev,

Are you changing the image dimensions when you save out the screenshot?

If so, in the "Save Screenshot Options" dialog, click on the gear icon in
the upper right and change the "Font Scaling" option to "Do not scale
fonts", and see if that improves the output.

Thanks,

Dear Kenneth and Cory,

Yes, indeed, I was missing this detail. The reason what made me think wrong
is that on a 3d model I was not observing this behaviour with a similar
approach(At least, that is what I think). See the attached pictures on a 3d
post-processing view which also has a lot of zeros in the input file except
for the z-direction displacement field.

In the sliced figure for the 3d example, you can also see that the mesh
elements at the top face are deformed too much. On one side of the mesh
they are moving out of the box and on the other side they are moving into
the box(one is basically compressing the air and the other side is
expanding which is of course exaggerated too much).

I was thinking that the same approach should also hold for the 2d case. At
the end, what I would like to do is to displace the structure with the
vector field and show the pressure profile as a color field on this
deformed mesh. Since pressure is a scalar, I thought that using the scalar
pressure values at the deformed locations of the nodes would give me what I
want. But apparently for 2d case, this is not happening(for 3d case, I
still believe it is working if I look at the results).

Is not my interpretation correct?

Ps. I will send another mail excluding paraview list with the input vtk
file for one set of data to your mail addresses for a further check if you
have time.

Thanks for the help in advance.

Regards,
Umut

Dear Cory,

The first time it worked it was the Depth Peeling alone as far as I
remember.

But, strangely enough, this time, it is working without checking those
boxes, I also did not understand now.

Please see the attached screenshot, very strange.

Best regards,
Umut

Hi Cory, Scott, thanks for your replies!

yes I am changing dimensions. I tried the option you suggested and this is
what I got (still doesn't match what I see on the screen):
https://image.ibb.co/e6N0kJ/centered_60_5myr.png

Resetting to default setting solved the problem, I attached the backups of
my settings. If you could tell me what caused it (some residual setting
from an older version of Paraview maybe?), that would be great because I'd
take that line out and restore the settings instead of setting things up
from scratch.

Best regards,
Lev Karatun.

Thanks, Umut.

To help track this issue could you send me a screenshot of your Help ->
About dialog? That contains information about your graphics driver that
will be useful to know.

Thanks,
Cory

Please see the attached. Hope it helps.
As mentioned before, it does not have any problems at the moment, very

Subject: [Paraview] warp by vector field(displacement) with pressure
 field problem
Message-ID: <adfbc898c56147339eb85d526ca5af3c@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Umut,

In the 3D case you are still getting overlap, but you are not seeing it because of an oddity of the way ParaView renders 3D solids. When rendering a 3D solid, ParaView removes the inside of the volume and just renders the outer surface. Most of the time this is correct because you won?t be able to see anything through the outer surface. However, if the volume is intersecting itself, the interior may poke out of the ?external? surface, but you won?t see that because ParaView is not rendering the interior of the surface.

In your 3D slice example, try moving the slice plane back to where the displacement dips into the volume and you will see something weird. Instead of seeing a cutaway of the dip, you will see a thin wall built where the clip plane is (see the attached screenshot). This is because, unlike rendering, the clip operation takes into account the entire volume and will find those interior cells that are overlapped. That thin wall becomes the exterior so you can see that part during rendering.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] warp by vector field(displacement) with pressure field problem

Dear Kenneth and Cory,

Yes, indeed, I was missing this detail. The reason what made me think wrong is that on a 3d model I was not observing this behaviour with a similar approach(At least, that is what I think). See the attached pictures on a 3d post-processing view which also has a lot of zeros in the input file except for the z-direction displacement field.

In the sliced figure for the 3d example, you can also see that the mesh elements at the top face are deformed too much. On one side of the mesh they are moving out of the box and on the other side they are moving into the box(one is basically compressing the air and the other side is expanding which is of course exaggerated too much).

I was thinking that the same approach should also hold for the 2d case. At the end, what I would like to do is to displace the structure with the vector field and show the pressure profile as a color field on this deformed mesh. Since pressure is a scalar, I thought that using the scalar pressure values at the deformed locations of the nodes would give me what I want. But apparently for 2d case, this is not happening(for 3d case, I still believe it is working if I look at the results).

Is not my interpretation correct?

Ps. I will send another mail excluding paraview list with the input vtk file for one set of data to your mail addresses for a further check if you have time.

Thanks for the help in advance.

Regards,
Umut

Umit,

I took a look at your data, and the warp by vector filter is behaving exactly how I would expect.

The displacement field in your data is 0 everywhere except at the top edge. Thus, when you apply the warp the top edge will move and everything else will stay fixed where it is. In the middle of the top edge the warp vectors are pushing down into the rest of the mesh. This is causing some self-intersection with the mesh, which is why you are seeing the pressure profile sticking out the top.

You can use the Threshold filter to remove all cells that are not moving. However, that is only going to leave the top layer of cells, which I?m not sure what you want.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] warp by vector field(displacement) with pressure field problem

Dear all,

On a 2d model, I am trying to plot some mode shape for a coupled fluid-structure problem where a beam is coupled to a cavity domain. I have two variables for this problem: scalar pressure variable for the cavity and the displacement vectors for the beam at the top edges of the domain.

I am writing the attached vtk input file with my post processing codes.

And the result is somewhat as expected except that another pressure profile with an undeformed structural part is also visible with what I actually want to get. Please see the attached screenshot with the settings and visible fields.

Do I have a misunderstanding to accomplish this task. At the end, I would like to show the pressure profile which is a scalar field in the file along with the displacement field on the beam at the top edge.

I was thinking if there is deformed+undeformed visibility selection somehwere or not, maybe the issue is completely something else.

Any comments are appreciated.

BR,
Umut

P.S. For a decent view for the deformed vector field, you can set the scale factor of the warpbyvector field to 0.1 to 0.15

to group the geometry and streamlines together?

I have an HDF5 file with an XDMF wrapper that reads just fine on macOS using ParaView 5.5.2 but on Windows using 5.5.2 when I visualize the Int64 array where ALL the values should be 20 every other slice of data is 0. This is a "ImageData" type geometry. I am happy to share the files. Just not sure what is going wrong or if there is a bug in the XDMF reader or ParaView or my .xdmf file.

Dear All,

I have a large simulation result as ensight case including the velocity as vector.

I want to plot streamlines, however if I press apply for the stream tracer, no calculation do starts (or at least I do not see anything), no output messages appear ...
.. it seems that nothing happens. I tried different settings for the Integration, for the seed type ... nothing changed

Does anybody had the same experience? I am a bit confused as there appears no error message.

Hi,

There are a variety of reasons why the Stream Tracer won't output anything.
These include:

   - The seeds are not in any of the cells
   - The velocity at the seeds is 0 (really below the Terminal Speed)
   - For multiblock datasets if the field arrays are not consistent across
   all blocks

I don't know the Ensight format well enough but my guess would be the last
situation. You can verify that this is the case by looking at the
Information tab and seeing if the Type is Multi-block Dataset or something
similar AND if in the data arrays any of them has listed "(partial)" in the
name. If this is the case, you'll want to get rid of the blocks that have
the missing field values using the Extract Blocks filter. Alternatively,
you can use the Pass Arrays filter to only pass your velocity array through
to the Stream Tracer filter.

Message-ID: <CABrYh3qswqNjehwTJjwjEjRLL4ZNUbJH6JyhJoFoXVCuKoQsOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

I'm working on a ParaViewWeb client talking to a pvpython server that shows
two linked renderviews. The link works, and it all looks great, but there
remain a couple of oddities I can't seem to squeeze out:

 - The mouse handler seems to listen only to one view, and I can't seem to
control which one it pays attention to. How can I demand it listen to one
or the other?

 - The behavior I observe is that one of the views moves with the mouse on
a click and the other catches up when I release it. They do not move
together, although this is close enough. Is this the expected behavior?

A possibly relevant data point: On the machine where the pvpython server is
running, there is a little undecorated window that appears, and the view
that I see in there is the one that moves with the mouse. But I can't seem
to control which view is visible there. Most of the time it seems to be the
one I draw second, but not all the time. What is this window and what can
it tell me?

One other issue:

 - When I make one of the views invisible (by simply not rendering it in
the parent React object) I can't get it to render when it reappears. The
render function is being invoked, but nothing appears. If I refresh the
whole page, it appears again.


Thank you,

 -Tom

Hi Tom,

- The mouse handler seems to listen only to one view...

I though the example in https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb-examples was
taking care of that. Or maybe I don't understand what you mean here.

- The behavior I observe is that one of the views moves...

That could be possible but are you using the latest ParaView/master?
Normally any registered view should receive a stream of images. With the
fix I've done last time for the multi-view.

- When I make one of the views invisible...

Do you still have a css / size issue when you make it available again? You
need to inspect the DOM to see where that component is present (area of
active).
Then does interacting on that area is not enough to get the images, or
interacting does not work because the "active" area has a size 0x0?

I'm not really sure if it is or it isn't. It may be an illusion created by
the other problem, but I don't know how to tell for sure which view is
listening.

The example you wrote behaves this way for me, too, even when I link the
views (see patch attached). One moves with the cursor and the other only
moves when you lift up the mouse button. Change the sphere to something you
can see move better and you'll see. I'm using the ParaViewWeb 3.2.2 that
you made. Or are you talking about Paraview itself? That's at 5.5.0rc3.
Were there relevant changes since then?

I did fix the css / size issue that was pestering me last week. Your
explanation has the air of plausibility, but I don't completely understand
how this would work. Can you suggest how I would find the size of the
active area?

Thanks,

 -Tom

You need ParaView 5.5.2 or master as I said last time, I fixed some stuff
on the python side to properly register animation on a given view.
Or you may have patched your ParaView. But for sure, you need Python code
along with the pvw change I made.

Hi Sebastien:

Actually no, that doesn't change this behavior. One view moves with the
cursor when I click on it, while the other only moves when the mouse button
is lifted. This is true on your example, as well as my code, and I seem
unable to control which one is which. Are you saying your example works
differently for you?

Thanks,

 -Tom

Subject: [Paraview] Setting a specific time in pvpython
Message-ID: <20180621091832.Horde.Qrxs_ucTq2oY6bHl0NdJFL8@webmail.ens-paris-saclay.fr>


Hi all,

 From a simulation in Paraview Python (V.4.3.1), I need to extract the  
displacement from a specific time. What I have tried (without success)  
to set the time I want is to use the following commands in my pvython  
script:

animationScene1.AnimationTime = 200.0

Also tried,

animationScene1.PlayMode = 'Sequence'

# Properties modified on animationScene1
animationScene1.LockStartTime = 0

animationScene1.Play()

animationScene1.LockEndTime = 200
animationScene1.UpdateAnimationUsingDataTimeSteps()

Is there another way in which I can set a specific time here?

Thanks a lot!

Juan

Hi guys,

I am wondering if you guys have a script as (programmable filter) which 
unrolls rotational 3D geometry (eg axial fan) which you could share.

Thanks in advance,

Gabriel

Juan,

In newer versions of ParaView (5.5.2 was released just a couple days ago),
you can use the Force Time filter to lock a data set at a specific time. In
Python, this looks like

# create a new 'Force Time'

forceTime1 = ForceTime(Input=canex2)


# Properties modified on forceTime1

forceTime1.ForcedTime = 20.0


Here, I am forcing the data set to be at time 20.0.

See this post which may further address what you are trying to do:
https://discourse.paraview.org/t/how-to-displace-by-time-t-time-0/138

Thanks!
Cory

p.s. We are moving community support to https://discourse.paraview.org/.
Please post additional help requests on that forum.

Very likely to be a bug in the reader (or possibly the library) where we
assume the wrong size for int on 64 bit windows.

If you can't narrow it down yourself, share the data and let me know if
this is XDMF2 or XDMF3 or both, and I can probably find some time via
Marcus's project.

So ParaView 5.5.2 still don't have the correct code base, but
ParaView/master works exactly as expected...

If you look back at our previous email thread, I must have highlighted  to
you what was the change I had to do on the server side, which you can
easily pick since it is just Python code with your current ParaView version.

Got it. I had misunderstood that message to only refer to the PVW changes.
I found the protocol.py file and made the change and it seems to work fine
now.

Thank you,

 -Tom


For those who are interested, it involves changing the

/Applications/ParaView-5.5.2.app/Contents/Python/paraview/web/protocols.py
file like this, around line 605:


        if not realViewId in self.trackingViews:
            observerCallback = lambda *args, **kwargs:
self.pushRender(realViewId)
-            startCallback = lambda *args, **kwargs:
self.startViewAnimation()
-            stopCallback = lambda *args, **kwargs: self.stopViewAnimation()
+            startCallback = lambda *args, **kwargs:
self.startViewAnimation(realViewId)
+            stopCallback = lambda *args, **kwargs:
self.stopViewAnimation(realViewId)
            tag = self.getApplication().AddObserver('UpdateEvent',
observerCallback)
            tagStart =
self.getApplication().AddObserver('StartInteractionEvent', startCallback)
            tagStop =
self.getApplication().AddObserver('EndInteractionEvent', stopCallback)

Forgot to ask: When do you think that will make it into the codebase?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] IEEE Supercomputing 2018 - Kitware wants to promote your
 work!
Message-ID: <CANjZAi9u8-2M=NO6udy+WuPuqC2sHkYNcQ-Dnp9-PJzNU51Osw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings VTK and ParaView communities,

We at Kitware are searching for compelling images, videos, and entire
applications enabled by VTK and ParaView to show in our booth at this year's
 Supercomputing conference <https://sc18.supercomputing.org/>. For a sample
of what we demonstrated before, check out last year's highlights
<https://vimeo.com/242962117>. In conjunction with SC18, and again with
your permission, we would also like to reference your work from the
galleries and success stories on paraview.org or vtk.org.

So, if you've got a cool app, or have recently used VTK and ParaView to
make some great looking visualizations, are able to share them, and want us
to show them off for you, please contact me so we can discuss the details.
Videos should ideally be 1920x1080 pixels for HD display, and still
visualizations should be 150ppi when scaled to 100%. For the attribution,
we will need at a minimum your name, a title or brief caption, and the
acknowledgement as you would like it to appear.

Finally, if you happen to be going to the conference and would like a forum
to present your work at, please let me know so we can schedule your
presentation in our booth.

thanks, and I hope to see many of you at SuperComputing in November!

We missed 5.5.2, but it will be in 5.6.x which should be out in less than 3
months.

Subject: [Paraview] Pb with programmable filter with vtkThreshold
Message-ID: <CAJ-2Sz33_YjvARw81v7YWfERAOgJtRNSC9X8Ohnqsw=CUH4new@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



I?m trying to create a PythonProgrammableFilter using vtk and the
vtkThreshold filter.

There seems to be a problem when I load a state file containing that filter
in ParaView.



I?ve attached a state file created with ParaView 5.5.0 showing the problem.

The pipeline contains two programmable filters with exactly the same code.

When I load that state file in Paraview :

-          The first filter shows an unstructured grid with 0 cells

-          The second filter shows as expected an unstructured grid with 18
cells



Then, if I add some spaces in the first filter and run it again it returns
as expected a grid with 18 cells.



I think there must be something that is not well initialized in the first
run but I can?t find why.

Do you have any idea on what is missing ?

Thanks for the help.

Best regards.


Lo?c

Message-ID: <DM5PR2001MB1866C19DF28ECFD05F2E24BD81750@DM5PR2001MB1866.namprd20.prod.outlook.com>

Hello

I have a C++ application that uses catalyst.  I am using the class vtkCPProcessor like this (consider that I am using: typedef vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPProcessor> Processor;):


    auto processor = Processor::New();
    processor->Initialize();

    vtkNew<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline> pipeline;
    pipeline->Initialize(path_to_script);
    processor->AddPipeline(pipeline.GetPointer());

And then, I have in another part of my code this call:


  processorMutex.lock();
  processor->CoProcess(dataDescription);
  processorMutex.unlock();

It works just fine in a single thread, but if I run the code with multiple threads, even though I make sure there is a single instance of the processor and the calls are protected by mutexes the application crash at the
processor->CoProcess(dataDescription) command with some memory error (usually SIGSEGV).

If I use many instances, the app crash when I try to Initialize the new Processor. Thus, I'd like to know if there is a way to safely call CoProcess from many threads?

Thanks

There is none, I am afraid. All of the client code is expected to be
called from the same thread.

Subject: [Paraview] ExtractBlock on PVDReader object
Message-ID: <6fb4f676-9c3c-f058-4f47-5f17ba0316cb@dcs-computing.com>

Hi all,

I am currently working on a small Python script that should extract a 
block from a vtkMultiBlockDataSet. In particular, I have a PVD file 
which links each time step to the respective vtkMultiBlockDataSet. So I 
started with

pvd = OpenDataFile("data.pvd")

in general it's straightforward to extract a block via

eb = ExtractBlock(Input=pvd)
eb.BlockIndices = [1]

now I previously wrote my vtm files in serial. Because of that I knew 
exactly what the index of my block was (1 in this case). Now I'm writing 
my vtm files in parallel and using ParaView's trace functionality told 
me that my indices of the different blocks are completely different. So 
I would like to know how to get the index of the block I want to 
extract. I know the name of the block, so ideally I can have a get 
function that takes the name string as input and gives me the index 
integer as output.

The only success I had was actually reading the name of my blocks using

pvd.GetDataInformation().GetCompositeDataInformation().GetName(1)

or equivalently

pvd.GetDataInformation().GetCompositeDataInformation().GetDataInformation(1).GetCompositeDataSetName()

but I could not figure out how to obtain the index from these 
vtkPVDataInformation objects.

Any help is appreciated.

Kind regards,
Arno

Have Paraview some tools in order to check this?

We recently added a Extract Enclosed Points filter that takes two inputs: a
point cloud and closed, manifold polygonal surface. The filter outputs the
points interior to the surface.

You mention the output of vtkDelaunay3D which is not a surface but a mesh.
I haven't tried this but maybe a probe operation will indicate whether the
point is interior to the mesh.

I believe if you send to VR again, even if you are already in VR, it may do
what you want, at least worth a shot.

I think in the past PV with OpenVR has been built on Linux and worked. But
that was months ago so I'm not sure the current state of it.

I did manage to build and run it, but the drivers caused frequent hangs and crashes (not just ParaView, but all of Steam's apps, too).

Subject: [Paraview] vtk renderer question
Message-ID: <CABrYh3rap2frRxk=PRZzUUGSv3cJ3A+7-eQCgpAT3a0w-Ug3bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

I have a vtk renderer in a ParaViewWeb application. I create it and then
attach it to a container for display using the setContainer() method.

                this.renderers.push(VtkRenderer.newInstance({
                  client: this.model.pvwClient,
                  viewId: result,
                }) );
                this.renderers[this.renderers.length - 1].setContainer(
                  document.getElementById(container));

This renders fine, and I can see the <div> I created and the <canvas>
inside it that appears to be the vtkRenderer.

When I render the container invisible (through the click of a user button)
in the render function of its container, it disappears obediently, but when
I make it visible again, the canvas inside my container is missing. Not
zero size, just not present. I tried explicitly calling the render() method
of the vtkRenderer object, but that doesn't seem to do anything.

Here's what I'm doing:

        <button onClick={()=>{
          this.rendererTwoVisible = !this.rendererTwoVisible;
          if (this.rendererTwoVisible) this.renderers[1].render(); //
Doesn't do anything.
        }}>
   ...
        { this.rendererTwoVisible ? (
          <div style={{display: 'table-cell',
                       width: '50%',
                      }}>
            <MyControlPanel model={this.model}

 view={this.renderers[1]?this.renderers[1].getViewId():""}
            />
            <div id="renderContainerTwo"
                 style={{position: 'relative',
                             height: '80vh',
                             resize: 'both',
                             overflow: 'hidden',
                             zIndex: '10',
                        }}
            />
          </div>
        ) : null }

I feel like there is a render method I should be calling directly
somewhere, but can't figure out what or where that should be. Any
suggestions welcome,

Thank you,

 -Tom

The reason why it is not working is because you removed the container of
the renderer from the DOM.
Therefore, you will have to set its container again... Basically it is
rendering somewhere in a detached DOM element.

You can do that, or simply use CSS to hide that DOM element.

Subject: [Paraview] Remote Connections Failing
Message-ID: <ADF86D1FAF9B1343A1CC280AE5BB77DC13F34DF2@colo-mail-2.exchange2.ara.wan>

I use ParaView all the time in client-server mode without problems.  However, one group of systems I'm using doesn't work presumably because of the way they are locked down.  When I first tried to connect to a remote server in Windows 10, I received the Windows Firewall prompt to allow connections via different network types.  I allowed everything like normal, but then I get an error message about a process could not be started.  If I try to connect again, as soon as I hit the connect button after choosing a server, I immediately get that same error message (it is instant).  That tells me something cannot start.  What is ParaView trying to do or start (maybe it has something to do with plink.exe from putty I'm using too)?  I cannot find any logs to tell me what's being stopped so I can investigate further.

As of ParaView 5.2, you can use the Force Time filter to move a data source
to a specified time. You should no longer need to use a programmable
filter. Simply apply a Force Time filter to your data source for all the
time steps you want to plot, then apply a Plot Over Line filter to each one.

By the way, we are now using discourse.paraview.org for community support
of ParaView, so you can post future questions there.

HTH,
Cory

Message-ID: <CAE=GJrZ_grB6KuuG5DF83gzH_ZidoUR4+v6uOP1s02zV_eWFFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a set of RenderView's opened in my ParaView and after some
modifications trough the PythonShell* I would like to Render() them all
simultaneously.*

The camera's are not linked and won't help me if it is the only way
possible.

With *RenderAllViews()* command the rendering occurs one by one
sequentially.

I tried python thread library but it did not went well.

*Is simultaneously render of multiple RenderView's possible?*

Hello,

What are you trying to achieve ?
RenderAllViews does render the views one by one, but is usually fast enough
for a human eye not being able to tell the diff?rence.

Best,

Hi,

It's large data on HPC sometimes trough Megabit Ethernet, so my FPS is kind
of low.

Rendering one by one takes N times the FPS where N is the number of
RenderView's.

Rendering them all simultaneously would be a huge increase in usage.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] Incorrectly reading Int64 values from XDMF file on
 Windows (5.5.2)

This is with the Xdmf reader on ParaView 5.5.2 on Windows. I did not try the Xdmf 3 reader as it does not work on our .xdmf file. I can probably get the data to you for testing although it can be quite large (4GB I think?)

Very likely to be a bug in the reader (or possibly the library) where we assume the wrong size for int on 64 bit windows.

 

If you can't narrow it down yourself, share the data and let me know if this is XDMF2 or XDMF3 or both, and I can probably find some time via Marcus's project.

I have an HDF5 file with an XDMF wrapper that reads just fine on macOS using ParaView 5.5.2 but on Windows using 5.5.2 when I visualize the Int64 array where ALL the values should be 20 every other slice of data is 0. This is a "ImageData" type geometry. I am happy to share the files. Just not sure what is going wrong or if there is a bug in the XDMF reader or ParaView or my .xdmf file.
