Hi Prem,

It would be great if you could share some data to reproduce.

Subject: [Paraview] reading classic *.cosmo files in versions greater
	than 3

Hi Bucky,

ParaView 4.3 uses a reader code from the CosmoTools library. This is unlike
previous versions which had a built-in reader. The new reader code is
up-to-date with the current HACC output and is maintained the the HACC
team. Hence the difference. Looking at the CosmoTools library, there seems
to be a compile time option to set the integer types to 32 bits
(TYPE_IDS_64BITS). However, since this is a compile time option in
CosmoTools, the only way to get at this is to recompile CosmoTools and
ParaView. If you are interested in pursuing this option, we can help. We
can't really change the binaries we distribute since the 64 bit tags is
currently what HACC outputs.

Best,

Sergi,

I can confirm the crash you are seeing in the same location in the code.
I'm looking for the cause.

What software produced these data files?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Steven,

This is odd since the OpenGL2 mapper should have detected FBO support. I
will have a look at it.

Hi Andy,

D'oh! sorry, pvbatch does work as expected.

Hi Mark,

Is that a typo or are you really using pvpython? You said "aprun -n 32 pvpython myscript.py". Otherwise I don't see anything that shouldn't work.

Best,
Andy

Hi ParaView,

When using the client GUI, Save Data will write out a pvti/vti data set with a vti for each processor. When trying this with pvbatch I'm only getting a single vti. I'm calling the pvbatch with

aprun -n 32 pvpython myscript.py

which I think should generate 1 pvti and 32 vtis. This is using ParaView 4.1.0.

myscript.py is a hack, I'm reading a pvti that's split into 8192 vtis and trying to re-write out fewer, say 32 or 64. This is part of troubleshooting what I think might be a lustre issue.

# myscript.py
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.Connect()
reader = XMLPartitionedImageDataReader(FileName=['test-input.pvti'])
writer = XMLPImageDataWriter()
writer.Input = reader
writer.CompressorType = 'ZLib'
writer.FileName = 'test-output.pvti'
writer.UpdatePipeline()

Is what I want to do possible? If not, is there a recommended way to merge vtis?
Mark

Hi Cory,

Thanks for your time. These data files have been produced by a software 
that I'm developing with some colleagues.

Best regards,

Sergi

Subject: [Paraview] Wrong fetched data
Message-ID: <5000545d13da0baa4fa1c3d1e3c44423@fe.up.pt>

Hi,

I am currently using Paraview 4.2, 64, in Windows. (but tried 4.3 and 
same problem happened)

My case is Ensight transient. Cylinder with 3.6 million cells, 
two-phase flow.

I created a python code, which I run from the shell in the GUI.


The main parts of the code are:


enscase = EnSightReader(CaseFileName = direcp + 'ensfinal.case')
...
axis = Line()
...
rAxis = ResampleWithDataset(Input = enscase , Source = axis)
...
rAxis.SMProxy.UpdatePipeline(7) # enscase.SMProxy yields same problem
rAxis.UpdatePipelineInformation()
dAxis = servermanager.Fetch(rAxis)



Now, for example:
print dAxis.GetPointData().GetArray(7).GetValue(150)
which gives me the value 150 of the phase array.

This data is wrong. On the other hand, if I go to the GUI Pipeline and 
create a Spreadsheet, the values are the real ones (confirmed in 
Fluent).

So, the fetched data in the python shell is, for some reason, wrong.
What is my mistake?


Thanks
Filipe Direito

Hi Ryan,

When you zoom in on your grid in the black and white image, do the thick
lines change to two thinner lines? What I think is going on is that your
grid lines are so close together that some of them have a zero-pixel gap
between them, making them appear thicker.

Thanks,
Cory

Ryan,

I thought of another thing to try with your original data: under Backface
Styling, change the Backface Representation to "Cull Backface". This should
remove the edges from the backside of your data set.

If that doesn't work, can you share a data set?

To turn off lighting and set the color to white, I did what you did, but set

r.Ambient = 1.0
r.AmbientColor = [1, 1, 1]

That made the surface white without lighting.

Cory

Hi Cory,

I had to spread my time over several topics these days... So I had not 
much time to get back to the paraview writer.

I believe I have done pretty much everything for the writer to work but 
at save time, I still get this error :
~> ERROR: In 
/home/houssen/Programs/ParaView/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxy.cxx, 
line 307
vtkSIWriterProxy (0x5cc38e0): Failed to create myWriter. Aborting for 
debugging purposes.
The writer instance is not created for some reason.

At this point, I run paraview, I load the plugin with "tools / manage 
plugins" (load seems OK), I open some data, I save with "my writer" (I 
see my writer in the save GUI + I am asked for a file-to-save name), I 
click OK and then it crahses. I believe the xml file is wrong and / or 
something is missing... But I didn't yet figured it out. It seems I have 
no pvserver (see in the mail) : can this trigger the crash ? Do I need a 
pvserver for the writer to work ?

I answered your question in the mail.

OK (I suppose I'll get vtkStructuredGrid / vtkUnstructuredGrid as 
vtkObject in myWriter::RequestData according to 
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Tutorials/New_Pipeline#Typical_Pipeline_Execution)

No I just run a client. I don't need the server : is it necessary for

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView builds part of VTK
Message-ID: <55945BCE.7060407@telus.net>

I am running on fedora 20, x86-64, and have successfully built ParaView 
4.3 and the VTK 6.2 subset that comes along for the ride. 
(congratulations to the devel team that have prepared such a painless 
build for this complex system!).  I am wondering what is the most 
painless / recommended way for me to have access to all of VTK 6.2:

1.  Somehow tell the ParaView build system to build all of VTK (not just 
the part it needs),
2.  Run a separate build on the VTK folder that ships with ParaView,
3.  Do an independent install of VTK 6.2 (this would mean having a 
potential problem with two installs of VTK), or
4.  Tell ParaView to use an externally built VTK 6.2

For the #4, I know there is the cmake flag

-DUSE_EXTERNAL_VTK:BOOL=ON

but I am not clear what else needs to be done to make #4 work

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Adding functionality to the apply event
Message-ID: <55945D96.5040503@micron.com>

Hello List,

In a [much much] older version of ParaView, I have a working 
filter/objectPanel pair that inherits from pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel 
and overloads the accept method.  I want to update this to work with 
PV4.3.  ObjectPanels have been replaced with the PropertyPanel.  Do I 
want to inherit from pqPropertyPanel and overload the apply method?  If 
so, is there a CMake macro to add this?  It doesn't look like 
ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL will work with the new panel philosophy.  If 
creating a new panel is not the right thing to do anymore, how do I add 
functionality to the apply event?

Thanks, Chris

Message-ID: <559465BA.2030506@ornl.gov>

ParaViewWeb gurus,

Is there a correct way to send a zoom request through the ParaViewWeb API?

I'm especially looking at the PVW MouseHandler (documentation here -- 
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/api/protocols.ParaViewWebMouseHandler)

I have had some success by sending a right-click with a small y value 
(looks like it needs to be between 0 and 1), the action set to "none", 
and buttonRight set to "true". However, when I afterward rotate the view 
(using the same RPC call with different methods), the rendered object 
just vanishes, although the axes and legend are still there.

Scott, et al,

It appears nothing has changed in the latest nightly build.

However, I have found that the remote X display I'm using is set to a 
resolution of 640x480. Given that info, it might make sense that 
ParaView is not rendering anything bigger than 636x420 if it's 
restricted to the X display's size. Is it possible to get around the 
size of the remote X display when rendering something offscreen with 
ParaView?

The "viewport.image.render" rpc call includes the browser viewport size as
a parameter, and the server-side peer window should resize itself so that
you get the correct image in your browser.  However, if the remote display
is configured to have a maximum size of 640 x 480, then I do not believe
there is any way to request a larger image from the client side.  Perhaps
someone else knows otherwise though.

Cheers,
Scott

Here is a sample from my websocket frames just now:

[48,4996973606207488,{},"viewport.mouse.interaction",[{"view":353,"action":"move","altKey":false,"ctrlKey":false,"shiftKey":false,"metaKey":false,"buttonLeft":false,"buttonMiddle":false,"buttonRight":true,"x":0.7654596100278551,"y":0.38173817381738173}]]

It seems the "action" should be set to "move" rather than "none", as in the
documentation you linked, "none" does not seem to be an option.  Also, as
that documentation states, x and y should be normalized to [0, 1], as you
correctly guessed.  And finally, you may need to provide all the parameters
with values like I show above, not just the ones you are interested in.

But at any rate, this should not then affect the center of rotation, but it
sounds like in your case maybe it is?  Can you see if moving just a *tiny*
bit keeps at least some of the object in view?

Cheers,
Scott

Can you change the remote X setting to have a larger resolution?

Scott is right, the x,y values are normalized, so depending on your screen
size if your image is 1000 pixel wide and you want to reflect a move of 10
pixel, you should send a x of 10/1000=0.01.

Subject: [Paraview] Supress windows on pv_web_visualizer.py
Message-ID: <COL127-W212DB71416372ABEE510B81970@phx.gbl>

Hello everyone

I am using Paraview Web with the Jetty launcher and the Web Visualizer. Anytime a new page is loaded for a new visualization, also a new window appears on my desktop (I am using ubuntu with KDE installed, and running the web server locally for test purposes). I'd like to know if there is a way to supress theses windows with the visualizations. They are a little bit annoying.
To me it's enough to show the visualization on the browser only.

I ran pv_web_visualizer.py with --help , but there wasn't any option related to my "issue". So I wonder if there's a way of doing it.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating a vtp file
Message-ID: <5594D2CE.9080805@telus.net>

 From net examples and on-line docs, I have gleaned some of the info to 
create a full 1-piece vtp file:

Call
vtkXMLPolyDataWriter::SetInputData( vtkDataObject 
<http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkDataObject.html> *)

where you pass in a vtkPolyData, which you first set up with the methods:

SetVerts
SetLines
SetPolys
SetStrips

and the parent method

SetPoints

What I have not figured out is how to set the vtp fields
PointData and CellData

Any pointers much appreciated ...

Hi Norman,

To set point data, you can first get the point data object with

vtkPointData* pointData = polydata->GetPointData();

Then you can add arrays to it:

vtkFloatArray* myArrray = vtkFloatArray::New();
myArray->SetName("myArray");
myArray->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
myArray->SetNumberOfTuples(polydata->GetNumberOfPoints());
// Set array elements here...

pointData->AddArray(myArray);

The same holds true for cell data, just replace PointData with CellData,
and set the number of tuples to the number of cells instead of the number
of points.

Hope this helps,

Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Probe location in a script
Message-ID: <ea-mime-55953f28-5f6b-59a2e5c4@www-2.netcourrier.com>


Hi everybody,

I am a new Paraview user. I am trying to extract points from a bunch of vtu files. It is pretty easily done with "probe location". But since I have a lot of files, I would like to automatize the process (with a macro or a python script). 

Could someone maybe show me how it's done?

My best guess is that I should have the following in a python script:
Probelocation.ProbeType.Center = [10.0,20.0,30.0] 
assuming I want to probe at x=10, y=20, z=30. But then, I don't really know how to retrieve the variables values at that location.

Thanks a lot,
Mc Fly

Hi McFly,

The Python Tracing facility in ParaView is perfect for this kind of task.
It records a trace of your actions in the ParaView GUI to a Python script
that you can modify a bit to process a bunch of files. To turn on tracing,
choose the Tools -> Start Trace menu item.

More info on tracing is available in the ParaView User Guide [1] under
section 1.6.2.

Best regards,
Cory

Hello.
I use ParaView to visualize Code_Saturne (CFD) calculation results (ParaVis
module in Salome). But I cannot integrate any variable except coordinates
and area or volume. I tried the "Cell data to point data" before
IntegrateVariables, it changed nothing. I asked this question on Salome and
CFD-Online forums, but noone replied me. Please, help.
Thanks.

Thanks for the tip. I actually already used tracing in order to find the command:
??? Probelocation.ProbeType.Center = [10.0,20.0,30.0] 

But the problem is that I don't know how to access to the data (rho, vx, vy...) at that location in the python script

And since tracing does not capture "Save data", I don't even know how to write the data in a file

Cheers,
Mc Fly

Have you tried doing the Integrate Variables filter with something like the
Wavelet source? If that works for you as expected, can you share a
representative data set that you're having problems with?

Here is a little script that shows you how to read and write dataset in 
ParaView using a simple for loop.

Hope this helps.

As far as I know, the only way to do that would be to rebuild ParaView with
OSMesa support and stop using your GPU to do the rendering.  This will
cause things to be rendered slower, but you would no longer see the peer
window.  If anyone out there knows how to get an OpenGL context to do
GPU-based rendering that doesn't require an actual window, I hope they will
chime in.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi, everyone. 
I intend to use the paraview remote visualization by run pvserver and paraview on different computer in a LAN environment. However, the paraview client cannot connect to pvserver as there is no DNS in LAN, and the server configuration has the syntax "cs://localhost:11111". It seems that pvserver must be configured as a domain resource, which is impractical in LAN. I wonder if the pvserver can be configured just using IP address, or other configurations needed. Can somebody provide me useful suggestions?

cs://A.B.C.D:port should work too where A.B.C.D are the ip address.

Also, don't forget the reverse connection capability, where the server
initiates the contact back to the waiting client. This is helpful with
firewalls and when the exact address of the server is not known ahead of
time (as when running on a compute node assigned by a scheduler).

Yes, thanks, that is exactly what I needed.

PS
I was getting memory errors when using myArrray->InsertNextTuple1( value )
This cleared up when I switched to myArrray->InsertTuple1( index, value ).

I wasn't really sure what to use for the action.


(I will double check that I'm sending the full request with all parameters.) I'll try using "move" instead of "none". I'll also try programmatically sending a very small mouse movement with the left click, and report back if I can find anything out.


Thanks!

Jordan

Scott is right, the x,y values are normalized, so depending on your screen size if your image is 1000 pixel wide and you want to reflect a move of 10 pixel, you should send a x of 10/1000=0.01.

Here is a sample from my websocket frames just now:

[48,4996973606207488,{},"viewport.mouse.interaction",[{"view":353,"action":"move","altKey":false,"ctrlKey":false,"shiftKey":false,"metaKey":false,"buttonLeft":false,"buttonMiddle":false,"buttonRight":true,"x":0.7654596100278551,"y":0.38173817381738173}]]

It seems the "action" should be set to "move" rather than "none", as in the documentation you linked, "none" does not seem to be an option.  Also, as that documentation states, x and y should be normalized to [0, 1], as you correctly guessed.  And finally, you may need to provide all the parameters with values like I show above, not just the ones you are interested in.

But at any rate, this should not then affect the center of rotation, but it sounds like in your case maybe it is?  Can you see if moving just a *tiny* bit keeps at least some of the object in view?

Cheers,
Scott

ParaViewWeb gurus,

Is there a correct way to send a zoom request through the ParaViewWeb API?

I'm especially looking at the PVW MouseHandler (documentation here -- http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/api/protocols.ParaViewWebMouseHandler)

I have had some success by sending a right-click with a small y value (looks like it needs to be between 0 and 1), the action set to "none", and buttonRight set to "true". However, when I afterward rotate the view (using the same RPC call with different methods), the rendered object just vanishes, although the axes and legend are still there.

Can you change the remote X setting to have a larger resolution?

The "viewport.image.render" rpc call includes the browser viewport size as a parameter, and the server-side peer window should resize itself so that you get the correct image in your browser.  However, if the remote display is configured to have a maximum size of 640 x 480, then I do not believe there is any way to request a larger image from the client side.  Perhaps someone else knows otherwise though.

Scott, et al,

It appears nothing has changed in the latest nightly build.

However, I have found that the remote X display I'm using is set to a resolution of 640x480. Given that info, it might make sense that ParaView is not rendering anything bigger than 636x420 if it's restricted to the X display's size. Is it possible to get around the size of the remote X display when rendering something offscreen with ParaView?

ParaView gurus,

I am working on a project that uses the JSON RPC protocols provided by ParaViewWeb. I've noticed that the image quality for ViewPorts seems bad regardless of what is specified in the call to viewport.image.render (docs here: http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/api/protocols.ParaViewWebViewPortImageDelivery<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#%21/api/protocols.ParaViewWebViewPortImageDelivery> ).

After decoding the returned image from the Base64 encoding, the JPEG image comes out as 636x420, while the quality is listed as 100 and the original size is 1440x850.

The JSON object passed to viewport.image.render looks like

{"args":[{
    "localtime":1425413914878,
    "view":-1,
    "size":[1440,850],
    "quality":100}]
}

While the returned object from that RPC call looks like

{
    "image": "very long encoded image text here",
    "localTime": 0,
    "stale": false,
    "size": [1440,850],
    "format": "jpeg;base64",
    "global_id": "315",
    "mtime": 3068929,
    "workTime": 1
}

I've used two separate Base64 decoders, and both result in a JPEG image that is 636x420, not the reported 1440x850.

Any idea what could be the problem here? Is this a bug in ParaViewWeb? I'm running the latest stable ParaView release (4.3.1) on RHEL.

Thanks,
Jordan

Dear all the Paraview users?

I have some problems about saving point set rendered by Point Sprite mode
both in eps format and in jpg format in paraview.

(1) When I employed eps format to save the current screen, it gives me
nothing but the points without any rendering, just like fig.1 below.
The reason I think maybe either that Point Sprite mode can not any more
encourage the eps saving or that there is something wrong in the saving process

(2) Then I used jpg format to save, but the only successful one is provided by
choosing the default resolution (925 * 718 here)(fig.2). Others may finally lead to
failure(fig.3). Now I get no point about this.

Does anyone get the solution? I need your help!

Best regards
Zuoguang Fu

Subject: [Paraview] IntegrateVariables filter (add variables)
Message-ID: <CANMVBVzhWqOyqutPj5xvt4fdFiufR_TEiWaK0+GUxX=ukooYJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.
I tried WaveLet filter and IntegrateVariables works with it. But I need my
flow field variables (pressure, velocity e.t.c.) to be processed.
Calculator filter accept that variables (I can visualise result), but
Integrate filter "doesn't see" the result of Calculator (and it also
doesn't see any flow field variables if it's source is a results file or
"cell data to point data"). I gave a link on example files to be processed
in previous message (see below).
Thanks for your attention...

Thanks for the script, but how can I now access the data that were found by ProbeLocation? How can I put them in a variable, print them on the screen?

Cheers,

Here is a little script that shows you how to read and write dataset in 
ParaView using a simple for loop.

Hope this helps.

Mc Fly,

ParaView always runs as a client-server application, even when just using
the GUI without connecting to a remote server (i.e., the "builtin" server).
The data resides on the server, while the commands you execute are on the
client. Hence, you need to move the data from the server to the client to
access it directly.

Fortunately, this is easy. Let's assume that your ProbeLocation filter is
named "Probelocation". Then all you need to do is run

polyData = servermanager.Fetch(Probelocation)

This brings the probe data, in the form of a vtkPolyData, over to the
client side. Now you can access the probed data through the PointData
attribute of the polyData object:

pointData = polyData.GetPointData()
rhoArray = pointData.GetArray('rho')
value = rhoArray.GetTuple(0)

I hope that helps. For more information on using Fetch, see [1].

Cheers,
Cory

I typically use VTK directly when I want to access the raw data from 
python/numpy.  See the series of Blog post by Berk Geveci for more 
information on that: http://kitware.com/blog/home/post/709

In ParaView, to my understanding, you first have to get the data from 
the backend to the frontend with "servermanager.Fetch".  I attached a 
modified version of the script that shows you how to do this in a 
quick-and-dirty way.  See more here: 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

If there is a better way to get access to the raw data, I would be 
really happy to learn how to do this.

Best regards,
Armin

Hi,

The issue is that you're using a multiblock data set that has fields
defined over only some of the blocks. In the Information tab under Data
Arrays you'll see the list of arrays with "(partial)" in their name. It
will only do the integration for variables that are defined over all
blocks. You can test this out by using the calculator filter to generate a
field over all of the blocks and then use the Integrate Variables filter.

To integrate the partial arrays you'll need the extract block filter to
extract the blocks corresponding to the arrays you want to integrate and
then you can use the Integrate Variables filter.

Regards,
Andy

Hi Filipe,

Perhaps the array at index 7 is not the array you are expecting? Could you
access the array by name instead, .e.g.,

dAxis.GetPointData().GetArray('variable_name').GetValue(150)

and see if that works better?

Thanks,
Cory

Thanks!
I don't know how to generate "common" field from partial blocks with
Calculator but I'm familiar with Extract Blocks cause I use it to extract
boundaries. AFAIR, I tried to integrate on the extracted boundary without
success but I will play with Extract Block filter in different ways, hope
I'll find the solution. If not, I will write on this mailing list (I have a
holydays for month so I will be online in august).

Hi Chris,

The pqPropertiesPanel fires off applied() and applied(pqProxy *) signals
when the "Apply" button is clicked. Would it work for you to connect one of
these signals to a slot in a custom Qt-side class in your plugin? If so,
can make your plugin an autostart plugin (see [1]) to instantiate your Qt
class, and connect it to signals fired from the pqPropertiesPanel. You
should be able to do this by looping over all the pqPropertiesPanels like
this in your plugin's custom Qt class onStart() slot:

foreach (pqPropertiesPanel* ppanel,
mainWindow->findChildren<pqPropertiesPanel*>())
{
  connect(ppanel, SIGNAL(applied()), myCustomQtObject, SLOT(onApplied()));
}

where you do your additional actions in the onApplied() slot.

Please let me know if that wasn't clear.

Hi Gabe,

Thank you for providing  the sample data set. I see the same problem with
the clipping filter you report. In fact, I believe this bug in the bug
tracker is related [1]. To work around this, you could run the Extract
Surface filter and clip by scalars.

As for the problem you report with opacity mapping on surfaces, I do see
problems with the Slice representation on the original data while setting
opacity below the 0 data value to 0 and the opacity above 0 to 1. If I
change the representation to Surface, the opacity mapping seems to work as
expected.

I hope that helps,
Cory

I have noticed that "zoom to box" does not result in the zoom that the 
user has requested.
There seems to be a tracker on this:

Other than this little thing, kudos to paraview.

Hi Norman,

Thanks for pointing this out. I added a note to the bug tracker to the
effect of "using a 2D rectangle to specify a zoom-in region under
perspective projection is tricky". For fun, you could try turning on the
"Camera Parallel Projection" option. It is much more straightforward to map
the rectangle you have selected to camera zoom, so you should see "better"
results this way.

Cheers,
Cory

I am getting an error when loading a NetCDF file that is written using CDF-5 mode using pnetcdf library. This is the error output:

There is no problem if I create the file using the classical mode for a smaller dimension (<2^32), and I can load it into paraview.However, for large problems I have to enable CDF-5.

I am using paraview 4.3.1.

Hi everyone. I intend to run paraview in C/S mode to use remote and parallel visualization in my lab. As the network is LAN, I simply fill the server ip address in paraview's host value. However, the connection process returns "Socket error in call to connect. No route to host." I aslo use test the connectivity using ping command and the result is positive. Besides, I test the C/S function using one machine as client and server, and the connection is completed as well, which proves the port is working. So I really don't know what is going wrong here. Please help.

Subject: [Paraview] Box clipping is very slow and wasteful!
Message-ID: <CAGGY7Dp5P7QQ-Wm=F=hwKYVL_GQ_smcYBCgzKbYNHMCdt6RH5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm new to this forum, and I am not entirely sure if this is the right
place to post this question, so please direct me to the right corner if
that should be the case.

Ok - to the technical bit now: I am using paraview 4.3.1 to load a 2gb vtk
dataset. One the volume is loaded, I see a memory increase of about 7gb.
Now, as a very first thing, I want to clip the volume, to about a 10th
(with the box option selected from the clip menu). Now, I set up the box
from which I want to extract the volume - but the entire rest of physical
memory (about 5gb) gets eaten up plus another 32gb swap space. By than,
paraview gets killed and I have to start all over again. So why is it that
selecting a small range out of a 7gb volume ends up taking least 37gbs of
memory?

Thanks.

This indicates that ParaView is not selecting a subset of your current 
dataset, but creates a new one.  Things like that happen, when you have 
a structured dataset and apply e.g. the threshold or clipping filter. 
By this, you do not only duplicate a part of the orignal data, you also 
create a unstructured dataset which uses significantly more memory than 
a structured dataset.

So, which kind of dataset do you have?

If you have a structured grid (e.g. vtkImageData, vtkRectilinearGrid, 
vtkStructuredGrid) then you could use the "Extract Subset" instead of 
the clipping filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom animation help? (Corrected image)
Message-ID: <A9BF9A24-AFD8-41DD-8F0C-446AD9B8702C@udel.edu>

Greetings all,

  I sent this message last week, but errantly sent the .tif image which made it a huge file. The JPG is now attached.

   I?m trying to make an animation in Paraview. I took a stab at it before with Paraview, but I recall it as being tedious. Maybe I can get some pointers from the experts.

  So, the attached imaged is a cube view of the electromagnetic response over sea ice. What Im trying to do with this animation is two things:

  1.) Move the horizontal slice and Y-Z vertical slice (the slice without the tubes) up and down, and side to side, respectively, such that as if you selected the particular slide in the Pipeline browser, you could drag the slice in question and move it manually to see the different responses. Therefore I?m trying to automate it.

  2.) Rotate it about the z-axis 5 degrees (to about 180) at each iteration and return, then rotate it 5 degrees at each iteration about the y-axis (till about 45 degrees) and return. These rotations will occur while ?action item" 1 is happening.

   Any thoughts/suggestions?

    Thanks!
    Jesse

Hi,

Thank you for your reply.

No, the mistake is not there. In the meantime I did realize what is 
exactly happening.

I have, say, 200 timesteps.
 From 0 to 6, data obtained from my code matches the data when I just 
use the GUI.
Starting in timestep 7 (always) till the end, data (for all timesteps) 
is the data from the last timestep.
So, when in python shell I go to timestep 6, I see timestep 6. But when 
I go to timestep 7, or 100, or 133, I see timestep 199. At the same 
time, if I go to the GUI, everything is ok.

By coincidence, the ".case" time step data is organized in seven 
columns. Is this related to the problem?

Thank you
Filipe Direito

I am getting an error when loading a NetCDF file that is written using CDF-5 mode using pnetcdf library. This is the error output:


ERROR: In /home1/01249/gda/modules/paraview/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkExecutive.cxx, line 784vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (0x2aaab6364390): Algorithm vtkVisItMFIXCDFReader(0x2aaab635b0e0) returned failure for request: vtkInformation (0x2aaab6263000)  Debug: Off  Modified Time: 885475  Reference Count: 1  Registered Events: (none)  Request: REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0


When I run ncmpidump on the data file it shows the following:
netcdf data_in {// file format: CDF-5 (big variables)dimensions:	x = 1024;	y = 1024 ;	z = 1024 ;variables:	double data(x, y, z) ;
// global attributes:		:CDF-5 mode = 1 ;}

There is no problem if I create the file using the classical mode for a smaller dimension (<2^32), and I can load it into paraview.However, for large problems I have to enable CDF-5.

I am using paraview 4.3.1.

Hi,

As i know there is a large file support option and you could select during
ParaView installation. I am not sure about it's value in the binary
distribution of ParaView. By the way, the NetCDF library used in the
ParaView reader could only support NetCDF classic as default and you might
need to install from source using NetCDF4 library.

I hope it helps,
Regards,

--ufuk

ParaView has supported netcdf4 since 3.14. 3.14.0 only through our internal
libnetcdf/hdf; 3.14.1 added it through external too.

However, I do not know if anyone has used the pnetcdf variant. You may be
the first Amir.

Can anyone else on the list comment on the status of pnetcdf support in
ParaView?

I am getting an error when loading a NetCDF file that is written using
CDF-5 mode using pnetcdf library. This is the error output:
According to the Parallel NetCDF website, CFD-5 is not supported by the NetCDF library at all: https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/parallel-netcdf/wiki/FileLimits

Thus I think you either need to modify your ParaView sources to use the parallel netcdf library for reading NetCDF files, or you could write your own reader plugin.

I figured out my problem. Basically, the API has an expected chain of 
mouse interaction requests:

When zooming:
1 - (fired when ctrl+right-mouse is pressed)
/action/: down
/states/: buttonRight and ctrlKey should be true
/y/: should be the current, normalized zoom (something between 0 and 1)
2 - (fired when mouse moves along y-axis)
/action/: move
/states/: buttonRight and ctrlKey should be true
/y/: should be the current, normalized zoom based on the change in y
3 - (fired when scrolling stops)
/action/: up
/states/: buttonRight and ctrlKey should be false this time
/y/: should be the current, normalized zoom

When rotating:
1 - (fired when left-mouse is pressed)
/action/: down
/states/: buttonLeft is true
/x,y/: should be the current cursor location, normalized
2 - (fired when mouse moves)
/action/: move
/states/: buttonLeft is true
/x,y/: should be the current cursor location, normalized
3 - (fired when left-mouse is released)
/action/: up
/states/: buttonLeft should be false this time
/x,y/: should be the current cursor location, normalized

As long as those requests take place in the right order, everything 
works as expected. Thanks for the clues, guys.

Message-ID: <9FB544F7B8D99E42ABADFEEB0BC26EE421C56BE9@045-SN2MPN2-051.045d.mgd.msft.net>

I have successfully implemented some macros to run under Paraview 4.3.1 on my windows laptop.  I now want to run this as a client / server on a remote system running unix.   I installed the latest paraview 4.3.1 from the linux tar.gz file on to the remote computer, but this only contains pvserver 3.8.1.  The version mismatch does not allow me to connect.  I have verified that I can connect successfully if I run paraview 3.8.1 on my laptop.

Is pvserver 4.3.1 for unix available?   I have searched and cannot find it anywhere, and  I really don't want to have to start compiling, so binary executables would be wonderful.

I suspect your PATH is putting a different pvserver in the way.

What does "which pvserver" return?

Dear community ,
I am trying to visualize array of atoms with their displacement vectors in Paraview. The structure is complicated and cannot be represented by StructuredGrid. The goal is to have slices with surface vectors (displacement) and atoms. I have tried two ways:
1. ??????  Generate a vtk file. In this case I have a polydata of points and vectors, but I cannot use SurfaceVectors filter in this dataset. I tried Delaunay3D filter to produce a grid, but it produces too many cells, which do not represent my structure properly, and instead of one vector per atom I have some strange distribution.
2. ??????  Load lammps dump file. In this case after MergeBlocks and Calculator filters I have unstructured grid with points and vectors, but cannot use this vectors in Slice->SurfaceVector pipeline anyway. SurfaceVectors are inactive.
I understand that in the first case I need to generate a grid with each atom inside one cell. However, I do not know how to do it. And in the second I do not understand why SurfaceVectors are inactive on the unstructured grid? I would appreciate any help, explanation or reference how to do it right.
Thanks.

So one of the reasons I have to use CDF-5 is that netcdf4 does not support large arrays (>2GiB), but CDF-5 does.So I have a question: Is it possible to break a large file into netcdf4 files and write a parent wrapper around it  and use that as input to paraview? What I mean is to write a pvti (or similar) parent file, that links smaller netcdf files together. Paraview recognizes netcdf4, so that should not be a problem.If this works, then the size limitation of netcdf would not be a problem and I can avoid going the CDF-5 route.

distribution of ParaView. By the way, the NetCDF library used in the

ParaView reader could only support NetCDF classic as default and you might

need to install from source using NetCDF4 library.



ParaView has supported netcdf4 since 3.14. 3.14.0 only through our internal libnetcdf/hdf; 3.14.1 added it through external too.
However, I do not know if anyone has used the pnetcdf variant. You may be the first Amir.
Can anyone else on the list comment on the status of pnetcdf support in ParaView?
 

I hope it helps,

Message-ID: <20150708074214.ED383124F2D5@shakotay.alphanet.ch>

Hi, 

I am using Paraview with Salome-Meca + Code_Aster and I have e little 
problem : impossible to see the movement of a part that is moving. 

In fact the simulation is very simple : I have 2 cylinders, one is fixed by 
one face and the other have a movement on a face. The simulation converges 
and when I open the mmed or rmed file (result) with Paraview, impossible to 
see any movement even if I clic "play". 

Simply nothing happens. 

Can please someone help me ? 

Best regards, 

Amka

If your vector field name is "v", then you should be able to use the
Calculator filter with the expression

(v_Y*iHat) + (v_X*jHat)

The result will be an array with three elements, but that shouldn't be a
problem.

HTH,
Cory

Do you have a sample dataset to share? That'll make this easier.

Typically, movement comes from one of the following:
1. Readers: the reader itself translates the points in the grid as time
changes
2. Filters: if the grid doesn't change but has attributes that indicate the
displacement, one can apply a filter to transform the grid using those
displacement vectors.

Message-ID: <CAPHwKk4MQ712ohKjL6avaZ27sYKzk-scHZRVOfn6FLJP_fSqtg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:


How does ParaView handle local rendering of geometry computed remotely? In
other words, once an object has been rendered locally, and I start rotating
it with my mouse, am I manipulating a locally stored copy of the object,
and, if so, will that copy change only when I change the object?s
properties (by adding a filter, changing its coloring, etc.)?


I noticed that ParaView would freeze when I applied filters to my data set,
but would rotate smoothly once the filters had been applied.


Regards,

Krishna

Yes, if the surface mesh is smaller than the limit set in your preferences,
the rendering infrastructure sends them from the root node of the server to
the client. Until something changes that mesh, the client takes over
rendering. Once the pipeline changes, then the server has generate a new
mesh and send it over the wire.

Amel,

The dataset didn't come through, I am afraid. Is it may be easier to upload
it somewhere eg. dropbox/google drive?

In order to use multi-core cpu well, I want to use multiprocessing module in paraview python script. But following error was occurred when I try to run following code on Paraview Python Shell:

import multiprocessing

It looks like all threads are attempting to open a display on an xserver
but Xlib has not been initialized to use multiple threads.

Interestingly, I can execute your code in my development build of pvpython
just fine under Ubuntu 14.04.

May I ask what you are planning to do with the multiprocessing package?
Maybe there is another way you can accomplish it without the
multiprocessing package?

Thanks Cory for your reply.

My developing environment is Ubuntu 14.04 + Paraview 4.3.
This issue will occur when I run those code in both Paraview Python Shell under GUI and pvpython command line.

I am attempting to implement a python script filter to handle my CFD in paraview pipeline, and my machine has multi-core cpu, meanwhile the filter has large part of separated calculation. So I think I can separate them into parts and use multi-processing to handle them.

For now, my script just use one core cpu, it?s slow and wasted.

Thank you.

Utkarsh,

I did something on google drive, I shared the file with your e-mail and 
here you have the url :

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_ag1ge2Wc1nSS10M1JYampTb00

I hope all is OK like this, it's the first time I use google drive. Say 
me please if something misses.

Subject: [Paraview] Orient created vectors
Message-ID: <CAM4K3YdAJ+XvjbShzT3uJL3ntYwwitjUPdryzrx5pZUOGEa4LQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using Paraview 4.3.1 (64-bit) to display data from a tecplot format
file.

Data is points coordinates (x,y,z) and vectors coordinates (u,v,w) for each
point.


   - I have created vectors with "Calculator" filter (Result =
   u*iHat+v*jHat+w*kHat) and it creates vectors with thewanted coordinates (I
   can see that in the spreadsheet view)


   - Then I made a glyph to display these vectors as arrows.

Magnitude is displayed without problem but i did'nt find how to orient
correctly the vectors.
Whether i check or not the "Orient" feature it doesn't change anything :
vectors are always oriented along the x axis...

Does anybody can help me on that issue ?

Thanks so much in advance.

Regards,

Aymeric

Hi Aymeric,

Did you choose the "Result" array as the "Vectors" property in the
Properties panel of the Glyph filter?

HTH,

I see. Thanks for explaining what you are working on. Unfortunately, I
don't have an answer for you on how to make it work.

Perhaps you could work around this problem by creating a subprocess with
another plain Python console in your ParaView Python script where you
execute your CFD code with the multiprocessing package in the subprocess
and then read the data in your ParaView pipeline after that process is
complete?

Hello,

Thanks for considering my problem.

Yes, in the Glyph Filter I have the following *Active Attributes* :

   - *Scalars *: FF wich is the magnitude in the (x,y) plane (calculated
   with another "calculator" filter : FF=(U^2+V^2)^0.5) : it's the length of
   the arrows I want to display.


   - *Vectors *: Result (vectors from the previously described calculator)

Can you verify that the second and third components of your Result vector
field have a range outside [0, 0]? You can get this information under the
Information tab in the Data Arrays table.

I am currently working on building the Paraview PCL Plugin as found here
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/PCL_Plugin/Download_And_Build_Instructions>.
I was wondering if anyone has had any success building the plugin with PCL
versions later than 1.5.1.  The latest info I've found was several years
old.

Thanks.

Dear Oksana,

You do need to generate a volumetric mesh first and then slice it to
generate a polygonal mesh. The volumetric mesh needs to interpolate your
values in space somehow. This is what Delaunay would give you - it will
generate a mesh where each atom is a node of a tetrahedra and the values
are interpolated over the tets. Is the interpolation the cause of "which do
not represent my structure properly"? What do you expect the slice to look
like? Maybe you need to project the closest atoms to the slice instead of
interpolating?

Best,

Hmm, well it does indeed have non-zero Y and Z components. Could you share
this dataset?

Thanks,

Hi Eric,

Thanks for your interest in the PCL plugin, I have used the plugin more
recently than PCL 1.5.1.  I last tested with ParaView 4.1 and PCL master
(from around February of this year).  I have a few small patches to the
plugin, and I'll share those shortly.   What errors are you seeing in the
build?

What features of PCL are you interested in using in ParaView?  There are
binaries of ParaView/PCL built here if that helps.

Casey,

I am mostly interested in the feature extraction routines and Paraview
integration with the Velodyne VLP-16.  I'd like to experiment with PCL
algorithms to try and pick out fixed objects such as buoys or piers from a
VLP-16 mounted on our research vessel as we travel up the coast.  I think
most of my errors are from attempting to build using Visual Studio 2013 pro
and older Qt/PCL versions.  If I can use the most recent versions, that
might help things.

The binaries you linked to here still require installation of Paraview and
PCL correct?

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Sergi,

I played with your data set a little but haven't found what is wrong. I am
suspicious of two things in the data file, the extent and the offset in the
second data array (it looks too small).

What are the dimensions of your grid? Note that the whole extent upper
values need to be the dimension - 1, e.g., for a 300x300x300 grid, the
whole extent should be 0 299 0 299 0 299.

Thanks,
Cory

Sounds like a cool project.  You may need to add some additional wrappers
for feature extraction if you are looking for things beyond the sample
consensus models that we have.  I dont think any of the point feature
histogram utilities are currently wrapped.

Windows builds of the whole stack are a bit tricky.  Feel free to share
your error messages, and I'll help where I can.

The plugin does not include support for the VLP-16 in its current state.
We have another project VeloView <https://github.com/Kitware/VeloView> that
builds a paraview plugin for VLP-16.  I have used this in combination with
the PCL plugin in the past, but the build is not straightforward at this
time.

This binary is ParaView with the pcl plugin built and packaged.  If you
download this it includes paraview and PCL.

Thanks Casey.  For someone with only moderate programming experience, how
difficult would you say creating those additional wrappers and building a
VLP-16 paraview plugin would be?  Do you happen to have any resources or
guides for doing so?

I will continue to look at building from source and check out Project
Tango.  Thanks for the link.

Thanks,
Eric

I should also mention that I have been reading this paper
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/1/1e/Paper.pdf> and a few other
sources.  I think I have a basic idea of the framework.

Amel,

What's the Result_DEPL array? Is that displacement? Assuming that, I
applied two calculators: first to convert the Result_DEPL array to a 3
component vector and the second to translate the coordinate positions using
the vector computed by the previous one. If the Result_DEPL changes in your
dataset over time, you'll see the movement.

State file attached.

Subject: [Paraview] displaying multiple timesteps
Message-ID: <559EEDD2.90100@nasa.gov>

Hi. I have a bunch of image files f_0.vti, f_1.vti etc. I am using 
ParaView's play button to go through them. However, the files are ~6G in 
size, so reading files between each time step takes a while. Is there 
any good way to speed this up? Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAB5Fpx4JY7KvHdnDyY1hCZ8HcM+HDhjb0xGXRJrP++kyPHUrEw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaView community,

I wrote a blog post on the Python color map design utility viscm by Stefan
van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith and how to get the color maps it produces
into ParaView. van der Walt and Smith used this utility to design proposed
replacements for matplotlib's default color map, one of which is included
as a file you can import into ParaView.

You can read the post here:

Cheers, and happy color mapping,

Utarsh, 

Thank you for your reply, I will try to do what you say this week-end. 

Another fact is a few strange : when I opened my rmed file with Paraview 
(using for this the http://www.alneos.com/telechargement/paraview-avec-med 
software), I simply could clic on the "Wrap" button (or a name near that) 
and, when I clic "Play" after I can see the movement... 

This same "Wrap" button is disabled (for this simualtion) in my Salome-Meca 
Paraview module, with which I work, and I don't understand why...

Hi, 
I wish to use Paraview to display data stored in EnSight Gold format. 
I would like to display only certain parts of the geometry. 
In EnSight it's quite easy to select the parts you want to display. 
How can I do the same in Paraview? 

Thanks for any hints 
Best regards 
C

Hello,

If I am not wrong, loading Ensight Gold files in ParaView will be seen as a
Multi-Block Dataset in the Information section of the data. You can then
use the "Extract Block" filter to extract the different parts of the data.

Hope it helps

Best regards,
Alexandre Ancel

Subject: [Paraview] Can I parallelize different input files?
Message-ID: <CANjddW23Bd6DODMSbv9aqrYfipxa5H8gdkvGSu87mjnL39xkfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi - I have 12 fairly large vti files (each one is a simulation of part of
the magnetic field of my particle physics detector). Each file covers a
distinct part of the total volume, so that all 12 together covers the whole
thing. This would seem to be a perfect opportunity to try to parallelize
Paraview's handling of these files - one CPU per vti file.  I have a
machine with lots of cores at my disposal. Will Paraview recognize by
itself that it can parallelize its operations, one CPU per vti file, or do
I need to do something to make that happen? There's no overlap between the
files - will that be a problem? My plan is to run a pvserver on the
many-core CPU machine and connect to it via my Mac. Any advice would be
helpful and appreciated!  Thanks! -- Adam

That would be questions to ask to the folks who developed the reader, I am
afraid. I suspect the "Wrap" button expected an array of certain shape/name
and that's missing in your dataset. I suspect its the fact that your DEPL
array is a 4 component array, rather than 3 -- but that's just a wild guess.

Eric,

That paper describes the approach for filter wrapping.  You will also need
to compile VeloView against your paraview build and then include the
VeloView plugin alongside the PCL plugin.

Hope that helps.

Hi Amel,

I followed the discussion between Utkarsh and you on this topic. Could 
you share the rmed file from Code-Aster? The download from your google 
drive seems to be restricted to specific email addresses.

Thanks Casey.  I'm reading in the Veloview Developer guide (
https://github.com/Kitware/VeloView/tree/master/Documentation) that
Veloview requires VTK6 and Qt 4.8.  I'm currently compiling Paraview from
source using Qt5.5 and VTK libraries that came with Paraview source.  Do I
need to download VTK6 and Qt4.8 and use those?  I've had some issues with
VS2013 and compiling with Qt4.

Also, I'm currently getting the following repeating error upon configuring
in CMake:

CMake Warning (dev) in ThirdParty/QtTesting/vtkqttesting/CMakeLists.txt:
Policy CMP0020 is not set: Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain
target on Windows. Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0020" for policy details.
Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers. Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

I'm seeing some references on the VTK users group (
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtkusers/2013-July/080543.html) that
seem to indicate you can ignore them.  Any reason I shouldn't continue with
Qt5.5?

Thanks,
Eric

Let's try to refine this. How would you pick which atoms to project to the
plane? Keep the atoms that are under a certain distance to the plane? Also,
once you project the points on the plane, are you looking to interpolate
the values on the plane continuously or simply show the vectors as glyphs?

Best,
-berk

You should compile against the VTK of paraview.  I have not tested Qt 5.5.

I have not recently tested building VeloView  against paraview outside of
the VeloView superbuild.  There may be unexpected problems.

I created a superbuild yesterday, and now when I run ParaView, I see the following error.  Then, Linux basically locks up.  I also get the second line below in the ParaView Output window.  Has anyone else seen this?

Thanks,

Alan

Hi Jesse,

It should be possible to do this. See Chapter 7 of the ParaView User Guide

I notice that the Superbuild is running Qt 5.4.1.  Any idea where I can find the Windows installer (i.e., I don't want to build from source)?

Thanks!

Casey,

When building Paraview 4.3.1 from source with QT5.5 in Visual Studio 2013,
I get 3 failed out of 569.  I pasted in the relevant parts of the VS output
log below (full log too big to attach):

567>  Generating Code...

========== Build: 566 succeeded, 3 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped
==========

Doing some Google searches seem to indicate that in order to clear the
LNK2019 error, I would need to change the project type
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6626397/error-lnk2019-unresolved-external-symbol-winmain16-referenced-in-function>.
And that in order to do that, I would need to change the configuration
type from
utility to something else
<http://gotoanswer.com/?q=No+Linker+option+in+Visual+Studio+Project+Properties>
.

I suspect that I am just missing something obvious, but I'm not sure what
it is.  Can you offer any advice?

Thanks,
Eric

Utarsh,

Yes, I think that DEPL is "d?placement" in French - that is displacement 
in English.

I tried to do the job. I opened with Paraview my vtm file with all the 
timesteps, I copied pasted the formulas of the two calculators I found 
in your state file in my two calculators, but no movement if I clic play.

Probably I did something wrong...

Hi Cory,

Thanks for your time. I have been playing a bit with the files too and I 
realized that replacing the whole_extent of each *.vti  by the whole 
dataset everything works.

I would like to generate something like this: 
http://vtk.1045678.n5.nabble.com/Example-vti-file-td3381382.html . In 
this example, each imagedata has whole_extent=whole size but its pieces 
only contain a portion of the whole dataset. Does this configuration 
make sense?

I have been trying to generate something like that but I failed. My code 
looks like this one: 
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/IO/WriteVTI but using 
VtkFloatArray as buffers and attaching them to the VtkImageData. I tried 
defining the set of the VtkImageData as the whole dataset and defining 
the VtkFloatArrays of the size of each portion but it didn't work :(

Any clue?

Thanks!
Sergi

Subject: [Paraview] vtkDoubleArray with >3 components
Message-ID: <CAEc4V-bvd0SRk35cuPM7Z9WhoH8WSL=7S_6kr7_Op5aOeoMN6A@mail.gmail.com>

I am creating vtkDoubleArrays based on averaging some input data to a
reduced set of points. The input data includes various vtk arrays which
have 1, 3 and 9 components.

After averaging, I am writing the data to c++ arrays, and creating a new
vtkDoubleArray using the SetArray() function to pass the c++ arrays. This
works fine for 1 and 3 component arrays, however for the 9 component arrays
paraview shows that every element is set to 0.

If I hardcode it so that 9 component arrays become 3 component arrays
(reading only the first 3 components from the input array), then I get the
correct data for the first 3 components, though I obviously need the other
6 components in the end.

Has anyone encountered this before?

Subject: [Paraview] Can I parallelize different input files?

Hi Adam,

The PVTI file format should work perfectly for this application. The PVTI
file is an XML file that specifies the different pieces in the whole image
and points to the VTI images that contain the pieces. When loaded, each
piece should land on a different CPU - if you are running 12 CPUs. The
extents in your VTI files need to be defined in terms of the overall image
extent - if they aren't you'll need to modify them so that they are.

I have attached an example PVTI file with four associated VTI files that
you can use as a model to define your own PVTI file.

Please let us know if you have any trouble.

Thanks,
Cory

Cool! Thanks - I'll try that.  I tried just loading a few vti files anyway
running the pvserver under mpirun on the multi-core machine. This machine
has no GPU and I got a lot of "swrast" errors (one per core). So I think I
don't have a good OpenGL on this machine. I tried building my own Mesa
OpenGL according to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D, but got
compilation errors using the newest version of llvm. Then I had to move on
to other things.  Not sure if you've tried this - maybe you have some
ideas. Anyway, I hope to try this again sometime this week.  --- Adam

Sergi,

Your VTI file extents should only describe the region of the whole image
they occupy, so you are on the right track. In situations like these where
it isn't obvious what is wrong, I tend to start from the beginning with a
very small example and build up from there. For example, you could start
with a small image - say 2 x 4 pixels (2D) split into two pieces. Start
with one data array for this example and make sure it works - use ASCII
encoding so that you know for sure what is in the XML file and then switch
to raw binary, then zipped binary. Then add a second data array. When you
are confident that works, change the example to four pieces, then make the
image 3D and so on.

It can take a while to do this, but you'll come out really understanding
the file format and will probably figure out what you had wrong in the
first place.

Thanks,
Cory

Franck,

Thanks for letting us know. I'm glad you figured it out. The client/server
wrapping indeed assumes your class header file is defined in a .h file. You
should, however, have gotten a warning that said something like

Unable to find: myWriter

Subject: [Paraview] Python: Save Screenshot in parallel projection
Message-ID: <CAEqguQY8z8zHaX9ErnnoAxjfWgtA5tSHNCU_P8coyx9DTVtYHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, when i try to switch to parallel projection on in my script i can
only save a screenshot with parallel projection disabled:

self.__getView().CameraParallelProjection = 1
self.__getView().CameraParallelScale = 1.0
self.__getView().CameraViewUp = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
self.__getView().CameraPosition = camdirection[axis]
self.__getView().CameraFocalPoint = [0.0, 0.0, 33.32500076293945]
self.__getView().CameraClippingRange = [154.56988142373606, 215.9545612783452]

SaveScreenshot(str(self.__getConfig().get("save", "path") + 'img-') +
str(axis) + "-" + str(distribution) + '.png', self.__getView())

When when i print out the parallel scale AFTER savin the screenshot it
is set to 46.6471043813.


is this the same bug like here: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7466

?

Is there a workaround or am i doing something wrong?

Thanks,

Jonas

Downloads are found here:

    http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.4/5.4.1/

The superbuild is meant to run with MSVC2013, but I see that only
MSVC2013 has 64 bit and OpenGL support anyways with the prebuilt
binaries.

Hi,

I can share the following: http://we.tl/3CPwe5y9vA
An easy way to see the problem might be creating a line source in the 
axis of the cylinder, doing Resample and see where interface is located.

Thanks,
Filipe Direito

Casey,

I don't mean to take up so much of your time, but I've been reviewing the
cmake configuration and I found that there were a number of HDF5 tests that
failed (see below).  Is that significant?

*Found PythonInterp: C:/Program Files/Pydro64/python.exe (found suitable
version "2.7.3", minimum required is "2") *

*Found ZLIB:
C:/Users/eric.g.younkin/Documents/PCL_ParaView/flann-1.8.4/hdf5/lib/zlib.lib
(found version "1.2.8") *

*HDF5: SOVERSION: 8.0.2*

*HDF5: Performing Other Test STDC_HEADERS - Success*

*HDF5: Performing CXX Test OLD_HEADER_FILENAME - Failed*

*HDF5: Performing CXX Test H5_NO_NAMESPACE - Failed*

*HDF5: Performing CXX Test H5_NO_STD - Failed*

*HDF5: Performing CXX Test BOOL_NOTDEFINED - Failed*

*HDF5: Performing CXX Test NO_STATIC_CAST - Failed*

*HDF5: Checking for InitOnceExecuteOnce:*

*HDF5: Performing Test InitOnceExecuteOnce - Success*

*HDF5: Performing Other Test INLINE_TEST_inline - Failed*

*HDF5: Performing Other Test INLINE_TEST___inline__ - Failed*

*HDF5: Performing Other Test INLINE_TEST___inline - Success*

*HDF5: checking IF converting from long double to integers is accurate...
yes*

*HDF5: checking IF accurately converting from integers to long double...
yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF accurately converting unsigned long to float values...
yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF accurately roundup converting floating-point to unsigned
long long values... yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF right maximum converting floating-point to unsigned long
long values... yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF correctly converting long double to unsigned int
values... yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF overflows normally converting floating-point to integer
values... yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF correctly converting long double to (unsigned) long long
values... yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF correctly converting (unsigned) long long to long double
values... yes*

*HDF5: Checking IF alignment restrictions are strictly enforced... yes*

*HDF5: Filter ZLIB is ON*


Also, one of the errors I saw upon rebuilding:


*error C1041: cannot open program database
'c:\users\eric.g.younkin\documents\pcl_paraview\paraview-v4.3.1-source\build\plugins\sciberquesttoolkit\paraviewplugin\sciberquesttoolkit.dir\debug\vc120.pdb';
if multiple CL.EXE write to the same .PDB file, please use /FS
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\Plugins\SciberQuestToolKit\ParaViewPlugin\moc_pqSQFieldTracerImplementation.cpp)*


Led me to the moc_pqSQFieldTracerImplementation.cpp which had a comment at
the top stating


*"This file was generated using the moc from 5.5.0. It cannot be used with
the include files from this version of Qt. (The moc has changed too much.)"*


So I will try with Qt5.4.1 instead.


Thanks,
Eric

 At best it would be to keep atoms that are under a certain distance to the plane, however to keep only atoms belonging to the plane is also OK. Vectors should be glyphs, one atom with one vector.
May be it woould help if I attach the file?

Faithfully yours,

Subject: [Paraview] Compilation problem of ParaView 3.14.1 on Ubuntu 14.04
Message-ID: <mo2g4i$4io$1@ger.gmane.org>

I'm trying to compile a rather old version of ParaView (3.14.1) from source, since 
I need it to compile, in turn, the PCL plugin.

However, I was not able to build ParaView after successfully running ccmake to 
configure and generate the makefiles; in fact, when I try make, the result is:

[  0%] Built target vtkWrapHierarchy
[  0%] Built target vtkWrapPython
[  0%] Built target vtkWrapPythonInit

make: *** [all] Error 2


I tried to fiddle around with the CCMKake flags, but, despite my efforts, only a 
few modules compiled, hence I concluded there is something deeper that I am 
missing: could someone shed some light?

I had a look at the PCL plugin and couldn?t help notice that you?ve copied some of my particle partition filtering code into the plugin, though it does not look functional as it?s not enabled in the cmake and does not include the relevant Zoltan sources or the vtkZoltanV1PartitionFilter base class.

The partitioning (both particle and mesh) have been refactored (from the pv-meshles plugin) into their own self contained plugin for some time now and it would be cleaner in my view to have an option in the PCL plugin to enable parallel partitioning and use the pv-zoltan plugin as a submodule where necessary
https://github.com/biddisco/pv-zoltan

(I tend to use GitExternal and SubProject cmake modules rather than a git submodule, I can send links if you?re interested).

The pv-zoltan code is currently under development (and is working with pv-4.4/master) to improve it as part of a GSOC project and should soon be compatible with zoltan2 rather than Zoltan. I can make sure a pv-4.4+zoltan1 compatible branch remains functional should we make major changes.

I might even volunteer to do the clean integration of pv-zoltan with the pcl plugin should you be in need of volunteers.

I do not think this is a problem.


Also, one of the errors I saw upon rebuilding:



error C1041: cannot open program database 'c:\users\eric.g.younkin\documents\pcl_paraview\paraview-v4.3.1-source\build\plugins\sciberquesttoolkit\paraviewplugin\sciberquesttoolkit.dir\debug\vc120.pdb'; if multiple CL.EXE write to the same .PDB file, please use /FS C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\Plugins\SciberQuestToolKit\ParaViewPlugin\moc_pqSQFieldTracerImplementation.cpp)



Led me to the moc_pqSQFieldTracerImplementation.cpp which had a comment at the top stating



"This file was generated using the moc from 5.5.0. It cannot be used with the include files from this version of Qt. (The moc has changed too much.)"



So I will try with Qt5.4.1 instead.



I am not familiar with this problem.  Maybe the filename is getting too long for windows?  Maybe another developer can help with the Qt issues, I am not an expert in this area.

Apologies for the interruption, but I tried to build the PCL plugin following the 
instructions [1] against an old version of ParaView, and run into problems (see my 
other post today),  but then I noticed this thread and realized that I may try to 
build it against a more recent version of ParaView: will it work following the 
dame instructions, as provided by  or some extra care is needed?

Message-ID: <CAG+yLxmwg6W9mD9NcVYmuopZFqwMh3_cWcC=k_kfZcjGrf07=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a set of data with displacement point data. I want to create a new
variable that:

New_displacement (t) = displacement (t) - displacement (t=0)

Any idea on how to do that? I was trying to use calculator but I don't know
how can I specific displacement for t=0.

Also, is there any easy way in Paraview to find the maximum displacement
throughout all time steps?

Thank you!

Hi John,

I am trying to remember the history of why that code is there, and the
reason escapes me right now.

Pat Marion: Do you remember this?

I propose that we remove it from the plugin until a time that we can sync
with your latest work.

Does that sound reasonable?

Luca,

You should be able to use a more recent ParaView.  If you run across
problems with the build you can ask here.  It should work, but you may
encounter some problems.  I believe I tested as recently as paraview 4.2

Folks,
Any add-ons for doing mass weighted and mass flow weighted averages.
Just getting started with paraview, I think I see the path to do this. But am not proud and am sufficiently lazy to use the works of others ;-)
Thanks

I think the best way would be to use the Calculator filter to compute your
derived quantities (e.g. whatever field you want mass weighted divided by
density) and then use the Integrate Variables filter to get the integrated
values of the quantities. I'd need to see some equations before giving you
a more precise set of instructions.

By the way, the ParaView User's Guide (
http://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v4.3&type=data&os=all&downloadFile=TheParaViewGuide-v4.3-CC-Edition.pdf)
is a good place to start getting familiar with ParaView. A printed edition
is available but will have to be purchased at
http://www.kitware.com/products/books.php. It has a couple more chapters
that can be helpful to some users.

Thanks,
I have worked with the calculator filter and figured out how to use the integraton filter.  Just figured that in the CFD world this is a pretty standard thing to do, and might already exist.
Thanks again

ParaView was designed as a general viz & analysis tool so it doesn't have a
lot of built-in short cuts for doing complex operations that are tailored
to specific analysis domains (e.g. CFD). This works well when you want to
do something slightly off from "standard" because you can control each step
of a multi-step process. If you have repetitive tasks that you're doing
ParaView has ways to automate them (state files, Python scripts, macros) to
save you time. If you really want to speed up those tasks and make it very
streamlined to your analysis domain, ParaView can be customized for that as
well. It's just a matter of effort for how streamlined you want ParaView to
be for your workflow.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Combining vtk and paraview python scripts
Message-ID: <55A55C2C.2030107@nasa.gov>

Hi.

As a proof of concept, I have a vtk script that reads some binary data, 
and produces a vti file. I then have a second script that I generated 
using ParaView's tracing facility while viewing the data. Now I'd like 
to combine them, so as to eliminate the intermediate file, i.e., go from 
binary data directly to rendering. To be specific, my vtk script ends 
like this:

steinbmag = steinbmag.reshape(nx,ny,nz).T

vtkImporter = vtk.vtkImageImport()
vtkImporter.CopyImportVoidPointer(steinbmag, steinbmag.nbytes)

vtkImporter.SetDataScalarTypeToFloat()
vtkImporter.SetNumberOfScalarComponents(1)
vtkImporter.SetDataExtent(0, nx-1, 0, ny-1, 0, nz-1)
vtkImporter.SetWholeExtent(0, nx-1, 0, ny-1, 0, nz-1)
vtkImporter.SetScalarArrayName('B field magnitude')

writer=vtk.vtkXMLImageDataWriter()
writer.SetFileName(out_fname)
writer.SetInputConnection(vtkImporter.GetOutputPort())
writer.Write()

and the ParaView script starts like this:

from paraview.simple import *

paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

filepfx = '/nobackup/jcbecker/steinBmag_0'
infile = filepfx+'.vti'
# create a new 'XML Image Data Reader'
steinBmag_ = XMLImageDataReader(FileName=infile)
steinBmag_.CellArrayStatus = []
steinBmag_.PointArrayStatus = ['B field magnitude']

# get animation scene
animationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()

# update animation scene based on data timesteps
animationScene1.UpdateAnimationUsingDataTimeSteps()

# get active view
renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
# uncomment following to set a specific view size
renderView1.ViewSize = [1090, 761]

I'm looking at the VTK examples and pvpython documentation, but any help 
is appreciated.

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] How to get pvdataserver/pvrenderserver connected to my
 client using primarily the ParaView GUI?
Message-ID: <CAPHwKk77=h43eS1YfBsGRwUPSWEw2SzxUEnTjYhCESFZd+GWvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been trying to run pvdataserver and pvrenderserver on a computer on my
network through a reverse connection back to the client running on my local
machine by establishing an ssh tunnel through the GUI (command startup).

Server name="othermachine2" configuration="" resource="cdsrsrc://
127.0.0.1//127.0.0.1">
    <CommandStartup>
      <Command exec="ssh" delay="0">
        <Arguments>
          <Argument value="-R"/>
          <Argument value="11111:127.0.0.1:11111"/>
          <Argument value="-l"/>
          <Argument value="pai"/>
          <Argument value="othermachine"/>
          <Argument value="/home/pai/pvds.sh"/>
        </Arguments>
      </Command>
      <Command exec="ssh" delay="0">
        <Arguments>
           <Argument value="-R"/>
           <Argument value="22221:127.0.0.1:22221"/>
           <Argument value="-l"/>
           <Argument value="pai"/>
           <Argument value="othermachine"/>
           <Argument value="/home/pai/pvrs.sh"/>
        </Arguments>
      </Command>
    </CommandStartup>
  </Server>

pvdataserver ends up running and connecting to my client. But then the
second command block doesn't appear to run to set up the render server,
maybe because of whatever is making the terminal stop being interactive
after it prints the "client connected" message. I want to be able to create
a second tunnel to run pvrenderserver from a different port, but the above
doesn't work. Suggestions?

Thanks,
Krishna Pai

Thanks. That's pretty neat, but what I'd really like is a standalone 
script I can run in batch mode (no interaction) to generate one png file 
per timestep for all the timesteps in the data set. Essentially I'd like 
a way to construct a pipeline between the vtk.vtkImageImport()  object 
and the ParaView renderView1.

All of that functionality is available through pvpython, or pvbatch in
parallel. I'd suggest you look into using the GUI's Python trace
functionality to help you make that script. pvpython can also be used as an
interactive Python shell if you want.

 Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and Visualization an SC15 Workshop
Message-ID: <CAM8hOwbAfj3P+XmoVK8k-n2RQYN=wcQh7TEQ0vAMOdHYG7DnTg@mail.gmail.com>

Extended Deadline (Paper submission deadline: 16 August 2015; other
deadlines: see below)

ISAV: In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and
Visualization
an SC15 Workshop
Monday afternoon 16 November 2015, Austin, TX, USA

Event web page: http://vis.lbl.gov/Events/ISAV-2015/

== Scope ==
This workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners
from industry, academia, and government laboratories who use in situ
methods in extreme-scale, high performance computing. The goal is to
present existing in-situ infrastructures, reference examples in a range of
science and engineering applications, to discuss topics like opportunities
presented by new architectures; existing infrastructure needs,
requirements, and gaps; and experiences to foster and enable in situ
analysis and visualization.

The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ analysis
and visualization is due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings,
where data is analyzed/visualized while being generated, without first
storing to a filesystem. Second is the potential for increased accuracy,
where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some
complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability
to use all available resources, CPU?s and accelerators, in the computation
of analysis products.

In Situ processing is still a relatively new idea, and up until recently,
most implementations have been ad hoc, proof-of-concept prototypes.
However, several in situ infrastructure implementations have emerged.
ParaView and VisIt both provide tools for in situ analysis and
visualization. ParaView Catalyst can be  linked to a simulation, allowing
the simulation to share data with Catalyst for visualization. Similar
capabilities are available within VisIt with the libsim library. Both
Catalyst (through Live) and libsim enable the opposite flow of information,
sending data from the client to the simulation, enabling the possibility of
simulation steering. ADIOS and GLEAN allow simulations to adopt in situ
techniques by leveraging their advanced I/O infrastructures that enable
co-analysis pipelines rather than changing the simulator. The non-intrusive
integration provide resilience to third party library bugs and possible
jitter in the simulation.
Participation/Call for Papers
We invite short (4-page) papers that identify opportunities, challenges and
case studies/best practices for in situ analysis and visualization. These
papers could propose actions, or provide position, or experience reports on
in situ analysis and visualization.

Areas of interest for ISAV, include, but are not limited to:
* In situ infrastructures
 - Current Systems: production quality, research prototypes
 - Opportunities
 - Gaps
* System resources, hardware, and emerging architectures
 - Enabling Hardware
 - Hardware and architectures that provide opportunities for In situ
processing, such as burst buffers, staging computations on I/O nodes,
sharing cores within a node for both simulation and in situ processing

* Examples/Case studies
 - Best practices
 - Analysis: feature detection, statistical methods, temporal methods,
geometric methods
 - Visualization: information visualization, scientific visualization,
time-varying methods
 - Data reduction/compression

* Simulation
 - Integration:data modeling, software-engineering
 - Resilience: error detection, fault recovery
 - Workflows for supporting complex in situ processing pipelines

* Requirements
 - Preserve important elements
 - Significantly reduce the data size
 - Flexibility for post-processing exploration

== Submitting Papers ==
Submissions are limited to 4 pages in the ACM format (see
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). The 4-page
limit includes figures, tables, and appendices, but does not include
references, for which you may use up to one additional page.
Please submit your paper via the ISAV 2015 EasyChair submission page at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isav2015.

Dan and Cory,

Thanks for the guides. I?m getting a lot better at animations now! Awesome! The guides helped a lot.

  1 more quick question for you.

 I know how to save state files, but is there such a way to save the animation ?state? that I just created in a state file, such that, if I use that state file, the animation scheme will reappear to other data files I?ve created?

   Wasn?t too sure on this.

 Thanks!
  Jesse

Subject: [Paraview] Plot cumulative integral over time of a variable
Message-ID: <f00630c065ee4933aff5a6f5aeee21d7@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Question from a user:

I would like to use paraview to do the following:

1)      Integrate a nodal variable over a volume (IntegrateVariables filter does this)

2)      Then, integrate the result of the volume integral over time (cumulative integral)

The "IntegrateVariables" filter works just fine to integrate over the volume, and I can plot the results of it over time by selecting "RowData" from the "PlotSelectionOverTime" filter.  I just can't figure out how to do #2 - integrate these results over time with something like "numpy.trapz" or "scipy.integrate.cumtrapz".

I feel like this has probably been asked a million times, but I still seem to have trouble with it.  I think I usually fall back to other post processing tools.  Can this be done all in Paraview?



Thanks,

Alan

Message-ID: <CANt3wQti+7nAcLhyCaD9yiaNgsAS2cJXOgpBJA5bZ5nhNrniUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am trying to load multiple state files by running a python script with
python shell. The script is the following

#### import the simple module from the paraview
from paraview.simple import *

for time in range(0,200):
        renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')

        # destroy renderView1
        Delete(renderView1)
        del renderView1

        filename = 'filepath/filename-%s.pvsm' % time
        servermanager.LoadState(filename)
        renderView=SetActiveView(GetRenderView())
        Render()
        # get layout
        viewLayout = GetLayout()

        # save screenshot
        SaveScreenshot('filepath/filename-%s.png' % time,
layout=viewLayout, magnification=3, quality=100)

I was monitoring the memory used by machine, after some time steps the
memory used by the machine is whole RAM. Can anybody tell me what I am
doing wrong here.

I appreciate your time and support.


Thanks
Raj

Message-ID: <DUB129-W7355D78AA3B5C1BFA154CBB39A0@phx.gbl>

Hi there,

My name is Andrei Cimpoeru and I'm using Paraview 4.2. I came across with a lot of unsteady data from a   CFD simulation and I need time-average it. I used the temporal statistics filter available in Paraview but is very slow. Is there a way to speed up the process? Also I would like to know if there is way of how to time average only for a range of time steps rather than the whole simulation?
I would appreciate your help and many thanks.

Regards

 

Andrei Cimpoeru

when open the eye on pipeline, but I can't find a way to export these whole
STL mesh. I tried many ways such as click Apply button below the pipeline
browser and changed some parameters; chose all files by pressing ctrl, but
it didn't work when I save it as another file, it often saved as the last

Please help me if you know how to merge STL files. By the way, do not
change any of its original settings will be better.

Anny,

You will need to apply an Append Geometry filter to your two STL files. To
use it, control-click on your two STL files in the Pipeline Browser. Then
choose the Filters -> Alphabetical -> Append Geometry filter and click
apply. You should get a new pipeline object named "AppendGeometry1". Click
on this and choose File -> Save Data... Find the STL extension in the
"Files of type" menu save your STL file.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hello all,
?
I'd like to create a custom filter that accepts arbitrary number of input connections (using InputProperty with multiple_input="1") and fills a CompositeTreeDomain widget (or similar) with those objects, so that the user can select a subset of inputs to work with.
How can this be accomplished?
?
Thanks in advance

Hi,

You may want to look at ParaView's spatio-temporal parallelism tool --
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Spatio-Temporal_Parallelism. The bottom line
with respect to performance for temporal statistics is that there's a lot
of file IO involved and usually that's the bottleneck.

As for averaging over only a subset of time steps, the only ways I can
currently think of doing this are:

   - Only read in the time steps you want. This would be dependent on the
   file format and its corresponding reader in PV.
   - Use a Python Programmable Filter to get rid of the time steps you
   don't want.

Cheers,

Andy

Delete() will only remove the render view, not all other proxies that were
created as part of the state loading operation. The following script should
do the trick:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from paraview.simple import *

def ResetSession():
    pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
    pxm.UnRegisterProxies()
    del pxm
    Disconnect()
    Connect()

for i in range(0, 10):
    ResetSession()
    servermanager.LoadState("/tmp/sample.pvsm")
    renderView=SetActiveView(GetRenderView())
    Render()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Alan,

For #2, a hacky way would be to use the temporal statistics to get the
average value and then multiply that by the number of time steps. The only
other way I can think of is by using a Python Programmable Filter to
integrate the values over time. The Python Programmable Filter recently was
changed to have access to the pipeline executive so that you can have it
iterate over time steps.

Attached is a state file which I used to iterate over time steps in a
programmable filter. It's not working with PV 4.3.1 but it may help give
you some guidance on how to do it. If it's overly confusing  (which it very
well could be -- I'm too lazy to look at it closely right now) let me know
and I can see if I can update it to work with the latest version of PV.

Best,
Andy

Elaine,

I am assuming that you have time-series data and that your displacement
values are defined in a point data array named "Displacement".

I suggest the following:

- Load your time series data by selecting all the files in the series in
the file dialog (input[0])
- Load just the first time step (input[1])
- Control-click each of the sources in the Pipeline Browser so that they
are selected.
- Use the Python Calculator with an expression like

inputs[0].PointData['Normals'] - inputs[1].PointData['Normals']

You can set the output array name to "New_displacement".

To find the maximum displacement in all the timesteps, you can color your
data set by "New_displacement." In the Color Map Editor, click on the
"Rescale to data range over all timesteps" button. This will compute
New_displacement over all timesteps and the maximum value will be in the
maximum entry of the color map, which can be accessed by clicking on the
"Rescale to custom range" button" and viewing the value in the dialog box
that appears.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Jesse,

When you load a state file, you get the chance to update the data file
paths in the state file. You can use this mechanism to load a different
data file with the same state applied to it.

Alan,

Attached is a state file (using can.ex2) which indeed uses numpy.trapz() to
do the work. It needs a small patch to be applied to VTK (attached) to
avoid a segfault.

The Programmable Filter adds a new row-data array named "trapz" which is
the result of the operation (it's repeated so we can add it to RowData
rather than field data.

Cory,

Right, but isn?t that going to ?throw away? the animation ?tracks" I just created?

For instance, I have created an animation with a vtk data set I?m working with. Cool.

But say I close Paraview, I lose the animation tracks I just created. Right.

So how can I save those animation tracks? Is this even possible in Paraview?

Thanks!
Jesse

Question from a user:

I would like to use paraview to do the following:

1)      Integrate a nodal variable over a volume (IntegrateVariables filter does this)

2)      Then, integrate the result of the volume integral over time (cumulative integral)

The "IntegrateVariables" filter works just fine to integrate over the volume, and I can plot the results of it over time by selecting "RowData" from the "PlotSelectionOverTime" filter.  I just can't figure out how to do #2 - integrate these results over time with something like "numpy.trapz" or "scipy.integrate.cumtrapz".

I feel like this has probably been asked a million times, but I still seem to have trouble with it.  I think I usually fall back to other post processing tools.  Can this be done all in Paraview?



Thanks,

Alan

Jesse,

The animation tracks will be saved in the state file. I just tested
ParaView to see if that is the case, and it is. Let us know if it isn't
working for you.

Thanks,
Cory

Hello Everyone,

I am trying to write a python script to output data for each time step. I
know to use the following script to save data for one time step:

I'm curious how I may do this for every time step?

Thank you for your help,

One thing I have not found a way to make a countour plot where there is a black line separating every Nth contour level.
Manual is not that much help
Can this be done directly with the baseline tool?
Thanks

Cory,

  Yes that does the trick, but one more question (and I?ve always wondered this). I had 2 vtk files open in the Pipeline browser when I saved the ?animation track? state file as discussed, but, when I select load state file, it's is now pointing to/asking for two vtk files. 

   Any way to adjust this since I want to open only one vtk file, or am I stuck?

   Thanks again!

Jesse,

- Load your state file.
- Delete the second VTK file you don't need.
- Save the state

That should do it.

Andy,

I don't think there is a way to do this with a single Contour filter. If I
understand what you want correctly, you could do it with two Contour
filters where one has the isovalues for every Nth contour where you want
black lines and another Contour filter for all the other contour values.
Then just change the color in the Display properties for each Contour
filter appropriately.

Paraview for Dummies question - it won?t let me delete that other VTK file in the Pipeline browser (grayed out).

There?s only an option for delete all (yikes!). Any other suggestions?

Subject: [Paraview]  Output data across all timesteps with Python
Message-ID: <CACPGBqHm20CiV6MEheDFmA7VYpenJZzgk_B5sXXZx8DnPFi-KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am trying to write a python script to output data for each time step. I
know to use the following script to save data for one time step:

>>> writer = CreateWriter(".../foo.csv", source)>>> writer.FieldAssociation = "Points" # or "Cells">>> writer.UpdatePipeline()>>> del writer


I'm curious how I may do this for every time step?

Thank you for your help,

Patrick

Subject: [Paraview] Pipeline's filters and multiblock order
Message-ID: <7C93ECB5-86A2-463A-988A-BF55929C49F4@gmail.com>

Hello,

I?m working with Fluent and exporting the results like an Ensight case. When I open this case in ParaView, I get all the mesh's zones like blocks and I can hide and show them with the multiblock inspector utility. Later I use a short Python's script that I found in the wiki, which creates a Filter in the pipeline from each block (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python/Extracting_Multiple_Blocks <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python/Extracting_Multiple_Blocks>).

My problem is that I have a lot of mesh?s zones and ParaView sorts them in some strange manner that I really don?t understand. I want to have them sort by name, alphabetically. Is there any way to do this??

Best regards and thanks for your time.

The "Pipeline Browser" shows the filters in pipeline order (or the order
they are created in). This can't be changed, I am afraid. BTW, rather that
using that script, you can use the "Extract Block" filter to extract blocks
of your choice if you're only interested in a few blocks (or few groups of
blocks). That may make it easier to use. In the "Block Indices" widget for
the Extract Block filter, you can use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) to search for a
block by name.

If you know the timestep values you're interested in, you can do the
following:

for t in [0, 0.001, 0.002]:
  writer = CreateWriter(".../foo_%d.csv" % t, source)
  writer.FieldAssociation = "Points" # or "Cells"
  writer.UpdatePipeline(t)
  del writer

Subject: [Paraview] Transforming a spherical slice into a map projection
Message-ID: <CAK3vnGc2pHaxZXhGtto8JzOo6Nu_UL84+rEMES6z5-x6Ei+=bw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm a new user and am having difficulty navigating Paraview. I would really
appreciate any pointers!

I'm using code called ASPECT (aspect.dealii.org) to generate models of the
Earth's interior. My data are unstructured grids that contain different
data arrays: velocity, temperature, etc. I hope that makes sense. I have a
spherical volume, essentially. I know how to play around with the basic
filters, and I'm able to take spherical slices which represent
velocity/temperature/etc. fields at different depths in the Earth.

But, I'm not sure how to "flatten" these slices into a map projection (for
example, a simple rectangle with latitude-longitude axes). Most tutorials
don't deal with VTK inputs and I'm not familiar enough with Paraview to
figure out my own script.

Thanks!

Marie

Marie,

Do you have a sample dataset? That'll make it easier to determine the
filters etc. you can apply.

Casey,

I managed to build from source, Paraview 4.3.1 in VS2013.  It looks like my
problem had to do with ZLIB and how I set the cmake parameters.  Also had
to change the Paraview project subsystem type from windows to console.
This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but it did get it working.

Now when I run Paraview.exe, I get the following output messages on startup:

QWindowsWindow::setGeometryDp: Unable to set geometry 1920x1017+4+23 on
QWidgetWindow/'pqClientMainWindowWindow'. Resulting geometry: 1370x753+4+23
(frame: 4, 23, 4, 4, custom margin: 0, 0, 0, 0, minimum size: 471x407,
maximum size: 16777215x16777215). (qwindowswindow.cpp:1323, void __cdecl
QWindowsWindow::setGeometryDp(const class QRect &))

Is this something I should be concerned about?  Some kind of resolution
issue?  I haven't seen it on the install I have using the binaries from the
Paraview site.

Thanks,
Eric

Thanks Robert for taking the time to answer my post; however, I've found out, from 
the "PCL Plugin" thread, that a newer version of ParaView can be used to build the 
PCL plugin, and, many hours later, I was able to finally compile ParaView 4 on 
Ubuntu 14.04.

Thanks Casey for your answer, which led me to successfully compile, ParaView 4.2 
and PCL 1.7.0. However, it looks the PAraView PCL plugin expects an older version 
of PCL:

Message-ID: <CAFtK+evM=vwqHoeX4-4hrwzTG3u8wphkheMuiPMzFLiVZ=Ku2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

  I'm trying to install paraview-4.3.1 on a cluster with off-screen
rendering. I'm following instructions on the wiki. I installed mesa-10.6.0
and included that


I get a whole bunch of warnings after i do ccmake like these.

 WARNING: Target "vtkParallelMPI" requests linking to directory
"/opt/cray/mpt/7.1.3/gni/mpich2-gnu/49/lib/".  Targets may link only
 to libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.

Probably about 50 or so of these with various vtk classes saying the same
thing. I'm trying to use the system's cray-mpich2 library. Hence I use the
MPI_CXX_NO_INTERROGATE and  MPI_C_NO_INTERROGATE variables. However, I
realize that MPI_LIBRARY currently points to a directory. I'm not sure if
this is even relevant. If it is, I don't know how to get rid of it. I tried
replacing this variable with a semicolon separated list of individual files
inside the MPI library to link it to. But on performing configure it gives
the same set of warnings and worse.. it reverts back to the original
setting of pointing to a directory.

If I ignore these and continue ahead with the make, this is what I get.

There's more. But I'm not sure. what exactly the error is. If it's a
problem with HDF5 library, I'm not sure where I need to point to the system
installation. Should I point to a parallel-HDF5 or a serial HDF5? I do need
HDF5 support through XDMF... I guess parallel is better. But I could take
care of that at a later date. I need something (without HDF5 even) working
now.

Sorry Oksana. I have been swamped. I hope to get back to you soon. The
solution will be to use the Python Calculator or Programmable Filter to do
the projection of the points on the plane and threshold based on the
distance. There are instructions on how to use these on the Users' Guide. I
also wrote a number of blogs on this:

http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/user/53

See the earlier blogs on VTK-numpy integration.

Best,
-berk

This needs to be updated for VTK 6 and is unrelated to the  PCL version.
You need to checkout the latest version of the plugin from here
https://github.com/Kitware/PCLPlugin where this has been fixed.

Hi Bruce,

I haven't seen this, but ParaView may be interpreting this array as a
tensor field. Do you have a smallish test data file that you can share that
shows the problem?

Thanks,
Cory

It looks like you're building with GCC on a Cray.  Are you using gcc
directly or are you using the wrappers provides by the PrgEnv-gnu module?
The CMake FindMPI module should work correctly with the Cray wrappers.  In
that case, cc and CC will work as mpicc and mpiCC, automatically wrapping
the Cray MPI libraries into the compiler args, which the FindMPI module can
detect appropriately.

If you load the cray-hdf5 module, that will set the HDF5_DIR environment
variable to the correct location.  Unfortunately, CMake uses the HDF5_ROOT
variable instead to look for it so you'll neet to set it accordingly.

If you're using the bash shell, the following sequence should prep your
environment accordingly:

# Start with a pristine environment
module purge
module load modules

# Load the compilers
module load PrgEnv-gnu

# Use the Cray wrappers for the compilers instead of calling gcc and g++
directly
export CC=$(which cc)
export CXX=$(which CC)
export FC=$(which ftn)

# Load the Cray-provided libraries
module load cray-hdf5
module load cray-mpich

# Used by the CMake FindHDF5.cmake module
export HDF5_ROOT=${HDF5_DIR}

Try configuring ParaView starting from that environment.

Out of curiosity, where is the machine located?  We maintain ParaView
installations at many different HPC sites on a range of Cray systems.

Dear Chuck,

  The machine is NICS - Darter -
http://www.nics.tennessee.edu/computing-resources/darter. The last I
checked, there's no paraview module on Darter. Hence my attempt at the
installation.

This is what I have from ccmake window. Does this seem right?

I don't have much experience with cmake, but can I set additional variables
in the ccmake window? Should this variable show up there asking to be set
if you turn on the advanced mode toggle?

Subject: [Paraview] Extract all points inside volume
Message-ID: <4E09FD4309849147BFDAED6FAAC87A956B0D54AF@EP1EXMB004.corp.halliburton.com>

Dear Paraviewers,

I am trying to select and extract all points that lie within a particular volume of my dataset. The volume is irregularly shaped (hence a simple clip is not an option), and created by a 3D Delaunay triangulation. Is there a straightforward way to do this in Paraview? I feel like there must be, but have been drawing a blank so far.

Many thanks,

Tom

Hi Aymeric,

Sorry, I have been swamped.

I just looked at your data. The state file you sent invoked an error in the
Output Window. Indeed, I could see the arrows aligned only with the X axis.

If I load just your data, I have more success. Here's what I did:

- load Test_Set.tp
- Calculator filter
-- Result array name = Velocity
-- express = U*iHat + V*jHat + W*kHat
- Glyph filter
-- Glyph Type = Arrow
-- Vectors = Velocity
-- Glyph Mode = Every Nth Point
-- Stride 300
- color by "GlyphVector"

I get the attached image when doing this.

My suspicion is that an error that occurred somewhere along the way during
your interaction with ParaView, and it has crept into the state file and is
causing a problem with the glyph display. I recommend starting fresh, like
I did, and see if you can get the vectors to point the right way.

Best regards,
Cory

Different find modules work differently.  The FindHDF5 module uses the
HDF5_ROOT environment variable (not CMake variable, which is why it won't
show up in the ccmake UI) as a hint for where to search, hence exporting it
as an env var prior to running CMake.  You'll also want to be sure to
specify to use an external HDF5 rather than ParaView building it's own:

  -DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=ON


 CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS                  -L/lustre/medusa/gantech/
> software/mesa-10.6.0/lib
>
...

>
...

>  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS           -L/lustre/medusa/gantech/
> software/mesa-10.6.0/lib
>

Instead of setting these in the compiler flags, it's better to tell
ParaView where to explicitly find the libraries and to configure
accordingly for OSMesa.  You can pass these as command line arguments to
cmake or ccmake with -D, or set them in the ccmake UI:

  -DOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=
  -DOPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=
  -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=
  -DOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=
  -DOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/lustre/medusa/gantech/
software/mesa-10.6.0/include
  -DOSMESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/lustre/medusa/gantech/
software/mesa-10.6.0/lib/libOSMesa.a
  -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA:BOOL=ON
  -DVTK_USE_X:BOOL=OFF



>  CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER           /opt/gcc/4.9.2/bin/gfortran

Not that it will really matter since we're not compiling Fortran code, but
this should be /opt/cray/craype/2.2.1/bin/ftn

It does look like the wrappers are correctly getting used for mpicc and
mpiCC and you can see the include dirs getting set accordingly, but these
do not look right.  Which version of CMake are you using?  Here's what I
get using CMake 3.2.3 (current cmake) on a Cray XC30 when not setting any
MPI variables, just letting CMake auto-detect them by enabling
ParaView_USE_MPI=ON:

 MPI_CXX_COMPILER
/opt/cray/craype/2.1.0/bin/CC
 MPI_CXX_COMPILE_FLAGS

 MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH

 MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES

 MPI_CXX_LINK_FLAGS

 MPI_CXX_NO_INTERROGATE
/opt/cray/craype/2.1.0/bin/CC
 MPI_C_COMPILER
/opt/cray/craype/2.1.0/bin/cc
 MPI_C_COMPILE_FLAGS

 MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH

 MPI_C_LIBRARIES

 MPI_C_LINK_FLAGS

 MPI_C_NO_INTERROGATE
/opt/cray/craype/2.1.0/bin/cc
 MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
 MPI_Fortran_COMPILER
/opt/cray/craype/2.1.0/bin/ftn
 MPI_Fortran_COMPILE_FLAGS

 MPI_Fortran_INCLUDE_PATH

 MPI_Fortran_LIBRARIES

 MPI_Fortran_LINK_FLAGS

 MPI_Fortran_NO_INTERROGATE
/opt/cray/craype/2.1.0/bin/ftn
 MPI_LIBRARY                      MPI_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND

Because the Cray wrappers automatically add the mpi libs and headers
(behaving like mpiCC), then the MPI code should compile without any
additional flags.

Hi Bruce,

I have attached a ParaView state file with a Programmable Source that
produces a vtkPolyData with 100 random points and a point data array with 9
components. It seems to display the various component ranges just fine.

Best,
Cory

I think the issue is that I want to use a threshold value to define the volume of interest, but then want to extract all of the points within that volume including those that don't satisfy the threshold filter. So far I can only extract the points that satisfy the threshold condition.

Select points through (i.e., frustum select)?  Then, on the Find Data dialog, Freeze Selection.  Last, Filter/ Extract Selection?

Dear Paraviewers,

I am trying to select and extract all points that lie within a particular volume of my dataset. The volume is irregularly shaped (hence a simple clip is not an option), and created by a 3D Delaunay triangulation. Is there a straightforward way to do this in Paraview? I feel like there must be, but have been drawing a blank so far.

Many thanks,

Tom

I installed version 4.3.1 . My script is working now. I hate to admit it
but from all my testing i forgot to remove one line of code that was
constantly toggling ON parallel projection. So it did not matter if i
toggle it in a function befor because it got resettet al the time...

I also testet it with version 4.2.0 and it does work.

Sorry for wasting some of your time by this mistake of mine. And thank you
for your effort Cory.


Jonas


PS. since i know how helpful these emails can be in the future, here the
code to toggle parallel projection:

(assuming my_view is an object created by 'my_view = CreateRenderView()')

my_view.CameraParallelProjection = 1  # 1 = parallel
my__view.CameraParallelScale = 1.0

Thanks Casey, I was finally able to use the plugin :)

May I suggest that an update to the "ParaView/PCL Plugin/Download And Build 
Instructions" page may be helpful?

Subject: [Paraview] GPU volume rendering failure on Intel HD XXXX/Iris,
 Windows and recent drivers
Message-ID: <CAC9gB0ArB3vVBbcQnk-52ymwKYpBuk7ZLRXJD8-RevF7NRGg6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We're experiencing GPU volume rendering failure on a lot (maybe all ?)
Intel HD windows system with up to date drivers.

This is reproducible in Paraview or with the GPURenderDemo example from
VTK, just load a volume and try to render the volume... Here is a result
image from paraview on a Dell Latitude E7450 (Intel HD 5500 inside), with
GPU rendering [1] and the same volume with CPU VR rendering [2].
Interestingly, the volume rendering used to work with drivers older or
equal to the version 10.18.10.3496 [3]. As a work around, we ask our
customers to downgrade their driver version to this one, and they're
enjoying smooth GPU rendering. But this driver is quite old and does not
support recent chipset...

I've built and tested the GPURenderDemo with the brand new OpenGL2 backend
on an affected machine and of course it does work out of the box
(congratulations for this amazing work !). But our application is FDA/CE
marked and we need to wait that this new backend is completely ready for
prime time. So for now, we have to stick with VTK 6.1 ...

Anyone has any clue ? They're some warning that pop up from paraview
related to the extension "gl_version_1_2" that could not be loaded, not
sure if that could be related ? Following this thread [4] and the fix
proposed, I've tried to replace
/*****************/
extensions->LoadExtension("GL_VERSION_1_2")
/*****************/
by
/*****************/
extensions->LoadExtension("GL_EXT_texture3D");
extensions->LoadExtension( "GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two" );
/*****************/
in the vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper.cxx, The warning disappears but
there is still no volume rendering (tested with GPURenderDemo). Maybe it
needs some others extensions ?

Should I fill a bug in paraview, vtk ? Are there any plan to maintain and
maybe fix this for the old backend ?

Thanks,
--

Hi Cory,

Your intuition was right: the problem is related in some way with the 
offset. I've changed the DataMote to ASCII and everything worked :)  
Note that in this mode the offset field is not used, instead of that VTK 
generates a DataArray.

I would like to know how the offset is computed since I can't find any 
relation between the  offset value and my data.

Thanks!

Sergi

Hi again,

I've just tried storing the data as a binary and It  crashes. In this 
case we are not using the offset field either.

May the problem be related to the data compression?

Best,
Sergi

Most of the tests are passing for OpenGL2 (
https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=VTK) on most of the dashboards
(various configurations etc) but it is a moving target just like VTK itself
is a moving target. I guess you are waiting for a VTK release that defaults
to OpenGL2 as oppose to OpenGL?

Yes, there is a patch and I can send it to you. I have to talk to folks
here if we can fix the old mapper with those changes but as of now it is
not in the plan.

Dear Aashish,

Thank you very much for you answer.
Yes you are right, we are waiting for a new VTK release that defaults to
the new OpenGL2 backend, for safety and because a change of VTK version
requires a lot of extra work with our current framework... But the green
dashboard indeed looks really promising, and we will probably make the move
as soon as it's ready !

Meanwhile, I would be really glad if you could send me the patch that
solves this issue with the old backend, or guide me through the needed
modification to make it work.

Thanks again
Simon

Message-ID: <CADHSJjAJS1YR9gHfAte4f5Ga+ij0vGghSQ21Hto+uYX+JbhWiw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

Since we're getting close to the next release, I just wanted to send out an
email to let everyone know how we're planning to do the next release.

+ We'll do a ParaView 4.4 release will all features/fixes planned for the
next release. This will use the older rendering code (same as previous
release) that doesn't using OpenGL 2+ features.

+  Following the same pattern as VTK, soon after (at the same time, if
possible), we'll release ParaView 5.0. This will be ParaView 4.4 but with
OpenGL2 backend.

The main reason for this separation would be to have a fallback in case
showstopper issues are noticed with the major rendering changes and for
legacy systems that don't have a newer OpenGL.

Any thoughts? Comments? Suggestions? If things go according to plan,
release candidates should start popping up mid/late August.

Utkarsh

p.s. Originally, we also intended to upgrade ParaView 5.0 to use Qt 5, by
default. However, there are a few outstanding issues with Qt 5 (some in Qt
5 itself, and some in our testing code) and hence the upgrade to Qt 5 has
been tabled for now.

With reference to OpenGL, will the new updates via 4,4 or 5 be compatible
with Windows 7(or 8) or does it expect a newer version of OpenGL on the
target system?

It would be my pleasure to give something back to the community.

As per the best way to do it, hmm... I'd rather like build documentation to be as 
close to the source code as possible, lest they diverge. Therefore, I would prefer 
updating the readme on the GitHub repo and drop the "Download And Build 
Instructions" wiki page: what do you think?

Folks,

I would like to compute PCA on some LIDAR data in order to tell, say, walls from 
cables. Therefore, it would be useful to know the eigenvectors/eigenvalues of the 
point clouds belonging to voxels of different sizes.

However, I have been unable so far to find a way to achieve this in ParaView, 
possibly using Python: can someone be so benevolent as to show me the way?

Dear All

I need to non-interactively make png images of a series of sequentially
numbered vts/vtk files. Since this is a large amount of data, I would like
to do this using a cluster. The cluster has paraview and OpenFoam. I am not
very familiar with OpenFoam, and have just started using Paraview in
terms of python scripts. When I submit the job, I get an error. I gather
that the error is because there is always a blank Paraview OpenGL window
that opens when I use the script below. Can someone suggest a solution?

thanks
Sanjay

The error message indicates that pv batch can not connect the xwindows.
If the cluster is configured to run X for you, ensure that the job has the
correct DISPLAY environment variable.
If not, you should either start X in the job ("xinit pvbatch" or something
like that) or recompile paraview to use offscreen rendering.

Hi


It looks like that my question is more for pbs/torque rather than paraview.

But I will still ask.


I am not wanting to do the visualisation using the PBS -X option, which

will forward the X11 graphics from the compute mnodes to my desktop screen.

I want to do it completely non-interactively. I could not find any other way of

changing the DISPLAY variable. If there is one, please suggest.


In the meantime, I am trying to find out of the paraview on our cluster is

compiled to use off screen rendering. I will also try to have a go at using

some precompiled binaries (pvbatch) if I can find any.


cheers

Sanjay

Dear All

I need to non-interactively make png images of a series of sequentially

to do this using a cluster. The cluster has paraview and OpenFoam. I am not
very familiar with OpenFoam, and have just started using Paraview in

that the error is because there is always a blank Paraview OpenGL window

To elaborate on what Andy said, you can stick your entire VTK script in
side the programmable source. Which you can use in batch mode as well. If
you want to keep your VTK script as a reusable code, I recommend making it
a module that you import from the programmable source.

Best,

Lester,

ParaView 4.4  won't have any major OpenGL related changes so it should work
on platforms ParaView 4.3 or earlier worked. ParaView 5 (with its use of
OpenGL 2.1/3.2 features) should indeed still work on Windows 7/8 with
relatively modern drivers. Note, OpenGL 3.2 is still quite old (~2009). If
you're using remote-desktop, however, you may want to switch to using VNC.
Remote desktop uses a software OpenGL implementation, which (when last I
checked) was only OpenGL 1.1 compatible.

(cc-ing Ken to correct me if I am mistaken)

Agreed. Don't forward X, N compute nodes sending their graphics calls over
the network to your desktop is much worse than N times slower.

Hi Aashish,

Thanks for the patchs.
However, I've tried them but without success, the GPU rendering won't show
up on an Intel HD chipset using the GPURenderDemo (the same exe/dll works
fine on a machine with an NVidia/Ati card). The warning disappeared though
...
The proposed patchs seems to affect only the TextureMapper 3D, shouldn't
there be modification to
the vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper::LoadExtensions method as well?

I've tried to uncomment all added lines in the GL_VERSION_1_2_DEPRECATED
part of vtkgl.cxx, build correctly everything, and on the problematic
machine the checkIfNull() fail for all the lines, the program prints out :
Function pointer vtkgl::ColorTable is invalid
Function pointer vtkgl::.. is invalid
For every one of them.

Also the vtkgl.cxx file is generated by the vtkParseOGLExt exe, shouldn't
there be modification in the headers glext.h/glxext.h/wglext.h instead ?
Maybe this is causing some troubles elsewhere...

If you have some other magical trick to solve this, I would be glad to hear
about it! Also I can provide more informations if you want

Thank You
Simon

This sounds great.  If you create a pull request on github, I will review
and edit the old wiki to point there.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem while exporting views in batch
Message-ID: <CAGox_oxa+PdQ2d5OHZR5barjJp2vGaA75p9V_stev4NE1=87Tw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am used to create vector images (PDF) using the export view tool in the
Paraview 4.3 GUI.
As I wanted to use it in scripts I used Start Trace to get the python
instructions which is :

*ExportView('your_path.pdf', view=your_render_view, Rasterize3DGeometry=0)*

Problem is, the Rasterize3DGeometry option is unknown when you try and use
it in the console (and without it you get a pixeled image).

I looked up old messages and found this piece of code :









*rw = your_render_view.GetRenderWindow()exp =
paraview.vtk.vtkInstantiator.CreateInstance('vtkGL2PSExporter')exp.SetRenderWindow(rw)exp.SetDrawBackground(0)exp.SetSortToSimple()exp.SetFileFormatToPDF()exp.SetFilePrefix("your_path.pdf")exp.Write3DPropsAsRasterImageOff()exp.Write()*

that should take care of it in a less direct way. Unfortunately, the
instanciation fail and the object (named exp here) is undefined.

Is it only an interface problem with python ? Is there any way to get the
correct instance of the renderer ?

Best regards,

Silv?re Pierre

Hey,

I also had problems compiling paraview. There is a pre-build binary
[1] for Mac, Linux, and Windows. However, the OpenNI source is not
included.

Luca, is the OpenNI source available for you after you compiled everything?


Best,
 Stefan

The old mapper had issues on some of the ATI cards (specifically on Mac)
and Intel chipset as well. So I am not surprised that it didn't work.

That method calls the vtkGL method I believe which I took care of it. I
will have a second look at it today.

Yes and No. Basically what happened was  that newer drivers stopped
reporting *1_2* variables and that's why you are running into issues. Since
the newer backend uses GLEW, all of this mostly works correctly.

I will have a look at it but even if we can fix all the extension issue,
things may not work on Intel.

Have you seen this

Are you just looking for a more detailed example?  I'm also looking to
eventually do something similar, once I get it all set up in the end.

Hi Aashish,

Thanks you very much for looking into this issue. Our customers (and I
believe the community since the issue is visible in paraview) would really
benefit from such a fix. Quite a lot of new computers just have an intel
chipset nowadays.
This of course until the new OpenGL2 backend is ready !

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Thanks a lot
Simon

The OpenGL2 mapper works on most of the intel chipset. I cannot promise
that we can get the old mapper working on Intel cards unless it can be
fixed by telling it that all the extensions are there.

Subject: [Paraview] Transforming a spherical slice into a map projection

Dear Marie,

You can use vtkGeoSphereTransform class to transfrom from Cartesian
(Spherical grid X,Y,Z) to Sphereical (Lat,Lon coordinates). Once you have
Lat-Lon, you can just treat them as in flat projection (Projection 4326).
This class is not exposed in ParaView, so you would have to use Python to
do the job or write a plugin for Paraview. Please let us know if you have
any questions.

Thanks,

Jesse,

Delete is typically greyed out when there's a filter connected to that
particular source/filter. You need to delete all downstream stream filters
before you can delete the active one. In other words, you cannot delete a
filter/source in the middle of a pipeline. You can only delete the "sinks"
or leaves.

Eric,

I am not familiar with the state of ParaView and Qt5 to be able to help.  I
believe there was a status update on the paraview-developers list recently.

Weiguang,

Points are duplicated for the polygons defining the end caps so that a
separate normal for the end cap can be specified - it's a common computer
graphics technique to get sharp edges where desired. Uncheck the "Capping"
property and your source will have 20 points as you probably expected (but
no end caps).

If the point duplicating weren't done, the cylinder would look funny at the
ends. Try running the Clean filter on the cylinder to see what it would
look like. This merges the duplicate points.

This looks beautiful, and exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much! I'll
work with this and let you know if I have any significant difficulties
moving forward (but I'll definitely read that section of the Paraview
manual first).

So if the last thing my VTK script does is set up a vtkImageImport 
object should that work as a programmable source (I tried but ParaView 
didn't get any bounds or scalar field name even though I set them up)? 
If not, what else do I need to do? Thanks.

You probably need to update vtkImageExport and shallow copy its output to
the programmable source's output. You also need to add something to the
RequestInformation setting the whole extent. You need something like:

from paraview import util

util.SetOutputWholeExtent(self, [0,nx-1,0,ny-1,0,nz-1])

By the way, there are better ways of getting numpy arrays into VTK than the
image import stuff. See some of the earlier blogs here:

I am not searching for the normal to a surface, but the orientation of a cloud of 
points (in other words, PCA) to tell a wall from a cable (a wall should have big 
first and second eigenvalues and a small third one, while a cable should have a 
big first eigenvalues, and small second and third ones).

Anyway, a fragment of Python calling a vtkPCAStatistics on point data would be 
great (my very first steps in both ParaView and Python, so bear with me).

Thanks, but I tried that out and seemed a bit brittle to me (I managed to crashed 
it while testing a programmable filter); moreover, I would have liked something 
more current.

However, I'm currently using the Project Tango build for Ubuntu, since my static 
build is not terribly stable either (I presume my Ubuntu box has some library 
version inconsistency).


> Luca, is the OpenNI source available for you after you compiled everything?

Hmm... I don;t quite get the question: do you mind elaborating?

Subject: [Paraview] PV 4.10 plot over line using mesh coordinates
Message-ID: <55AE09A1.8040504@inria.fr>

One of the inputs to Plot over line  is the number of points (equally 
spaced, I assumed).
The solution is interpolated to the points. This poses a problem for 
highly stretched meshes like the normal coordinate in a boundary layer.

I would like to plot over line using the actual mesh values and NOT the 
interpolated values.
Is this possible in PV?

How do I extract a line using the filters? That would be useful.

Hope my questions are clear,
Stephen

 Dear Berk,

Thank you for the reply. I was trying to use the Python Calculator.? I created a plane source, but I do not know how to put it into projection calculation. The idea was to use one normal vector to find dislacement vectors projections in a plane. How to create a threshold I have no idea at all. May be you could provide some more reference.

Faithfully yours,
Oksana

Right. I found the RequestInformation info above from searching the web. 
Then I was able to follow the instructions in the ParaView Guide section 
13.2.4 Reading binary 2D image. I basically replaced the image import 
stuff with code analogous  to the output assignment,

Thanks for your help.

Hi Cory,

Sorry for the delayed response, I've hit another more serious bug which has
been diverting my attention from this.

Thanks for the state file, I haven't got it to work as I don't have numpy
set up, but I have also got this working with 9 component arrays in
paraview using a python script. However, I am now trying to port my python
plugin to c++ which is where I am seeing the error.

In my plugin I want to output a vtkarray for each vtkarray in the input
dataset. The values in the output vtkarrays are interpolated from those in
the input vtkarrays. Rather than working directly on vtkarray objects, I am
allocating c++ arrays for each vtkarray, performing the interpolation, then
creating vtkDoubleArrays and using SetArray to pass a pointer to my
allocated c++ arrays to the output vtkarrays. The code for setting up the
output vtkarrays is roughly as follows

                vtkPointData *pointData = input->GetPointData();
                vtkDataArray *dArray = pointData->GetArray(i);
vtkDoubleArray *vtkDArrayAve = vtkDoubleArray::New();
vtkDArrayAve->SetName(dArray->GetName());
vtkDArrayAve->SetArray(dArraysAve[i],hgrid->GetTotalCells(),0);
vtkDArrayAve->SetNumberOfComponents(numComponents[i]);
vtkDArrayAve->SetNumberOfTuples(hgrid->GetTotalCells());
output->GetPointData()->AddArray(vtkDArrayAve);

dArraysAve is an array of pointers pointing to my c++ arrays
hgrid->GetTotalCells() returns the number of data points for my output

I also have another mode of operation for this plugin, where I perform the
interpolation differently, in that function, if I make the call to
SetNumberOfComponents() some heap corruption occurs and I get a segfault
when I try to subsequently free my c++ arrays. Commenting out the call to
SetNumberOfComponents avoids the segfault, but then I am limited to single
component arrays. This is the more serious bug I mentioned, initially I
figured they were unrelated, but I can't deny the number of components
coincidence.

Cheers,
Bruce

	GLXBadContext
Message-ID: <705948642.2469781.1437532967881.JavaMail.apache@nm43.abv.bg>

Hello,

I am a total newbie in CFD and ParaView. I was trying to do the OpenFOAM tutorials and running ParaView to view the mesh was one of the first steps, and unfortunately it's where I stumble upon:

X Error: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) 2

 Extension:


 149 (Uknown extension)

 Minor opcode: 3 (Unknown request)

 Resource id:
 0x0
X Error: GLXBadContext 151

 Extension:


 149 (Uknown extension)

 Minor opcode: 5 (Unknown request)

 Resource id:
 0x10002bc

ParaView gives indication of starting then freezes wihout displayng the contents of the opened windows. The version of ParaView I'm using is 3.12.0 for 64-bit systems. I'm using it via the Cygwin Terminal.
To be honest, I have limitted expirience with SSH (I have just started) and everything I read sounds like Chinese to me. If anybody can help and also explain to me what and why I will be extremely grateful. (It may happen that you need to tell me things in a way that a 90-year old grandma who sees computer for the first time would understand :( )

Hi Bruce,

SetNumberOfTuples reallocates the internal datastructure of the data array
to be the new required size based on the new number of components and
number of tuples.  This (combined with trying to clean up the old data from
SetArray) may be causing the heap corruption you are seeing.  Try setting
the number of components and number of tuples before adding the data to the
array.

HTH,
Shawn

Actually, don't call SetNumberOfTuples() at all if you are using
SetArray(). It will unnecessarily allocate memory if you call it before
SetArray().

Hi Guys,

I have just tried it as you suggested, doing SetNumberOfComponents then
SetArray, without doing SetNumberOfTuples. Unfortunately I am still getting
the same behaviour.

Cheers,
Bruce

Subject: [Paraview] [Catalyst] Ghost cells
Message-ID: <9b365a0ae2be4a7e8225e5e218c49da1@MAR190n2.marin.local>

Hi,

I?m slowly getting to grips with PVCatalyst, trying to create an adaptor for our simulation code. Our code is distributed using MPI and has normal and ghost cells for each process. Should I take these ghost cells into account in the adaptor, and if so, how can this be done? There does not seem to be an example for this in the example code repository, but maybe there is an example somewhere else that I can use to understand this?

Thanks and best wishes,


Menno

Subject: [Paraview] Bug with the trace tool : Exporting view instruction not
	repeatable
Message-ID: <CAGox_owQwgeuDchfmGgA+SY10on4fXFTmqmX4SHMHvNDBXg_XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am used to create vector images (PDF) using the export view tool in the
Paraview 4.3 GUI.
As I wanted to use it in scripts I used Start Trace to get the python
instructions which is :

ExportView('your_path.pdf', view=your_render_view, Rasterize3DGeometry=0)

Problem is, the Rasterize3DGeometry option is unknown when you try and use
it in the console (and without it you get a pixeled image).

I looked up old messages and found this piece of code :

rw = your_render_view.GetRenderWindow()
exp = paraview.vtk.vtkInstantiator.CreateInstance('vtkGL2PSExporter')
exp.SetRenderWindow(rw)
exp.SetDrawBackground(0)
exp.SetSortToSimple()
exp.SetFileFormatToPDF()
exp.SetFilePrefix("your_path.pdf")
exp.Write3DPropsAsRasterImageOff()
exp.Write()

that should take care of it in a less direct way. Unfortunately, the
instanciation fail and the object (named exp here) is undefined.

Is it only an interface problem with python ? Is there any way to get the
correct instance of the renderer ?

Best regards,

Silv?re Pierre

Hi Menno,

Did you look at the http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/856 blog about
ghost cells? That has a good explanation of where ParaView is going for
improving ghost cell support in general. I haven't gotten around to making
a Catalyst example yet that uses ghost cells but hopefully someone can find
some time to do that soon with the changes to ghost cell support in
ParaView.

If you try a simple example and notice some unexpected behavior, please let
us know. Also, if you get something working and want to share it in the
Catalyst examples repo (
https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode) I would appreciate
it.

Best,
Andy

The solution is in the documentation:

  // This method lets the user specify data to be held by the array.  The
  // array argument is a pointer to the data.  size is the size of the
  // array supplied by the user.  Set save to 1 to keep the class from
  // deleting the array when it cleans up or reallocates memory.  The class
  // uses the actual array provided; it does not copy the data from the
  // suppled array. If specified, the delete method determines how the data
  // array will be deallocated. If the delete method is
  // VTK_DATA_ARRAY_FREE, free() will be used. If the delete method is
  // DELETE, delete[] will be used. The default is FREE.

You are passing 0 for the "save" argument, which means that VTK will delete
the array when the VTK array object is deleted, which would cause a double
delete/free. Use 1 as the second argument of SetArray() if you are managing
the memory. Also, make sure that the VTK array is not used after you free
your array.

Best,
-berk

Thanks Berk,

I have tried with both zero and 1 as the save argument and am getting the
same behavior. As before, if I comment the SetNumberOfComponents call (or
set number of components to 1) everything works, except I only have single
component arrays in the output.

I'm going to put together a minimum working example with the issue this
afternoon so that I can show you guys in more detail.

Cheers,
Bruce

Hey Guys,

I have created a minimum working example (attached). This example is built
as a paraview plugin, build environment specified below. The plugin takes
point data as input (sample attached), and just does the memory allocation
and creation of output arrays as I have previously described. On my
machine, as soon as I apply the filter, paraview crashes. Commenting line
107 in vtkHeapCorruption.cxx allows the filter to run, but the output is
then limited to single component arrays, where some of the input arrays
have 3 or 9 components.

QT 4.8.6, Visual Studio 2010, Built against Paraview commit SHA1
ID: 70155c17cfe7c2f547bb25ddb859a65518896ee3

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 4.1 and greater not getting slice
 representation on remote logins
Message-ID: <55AFEA19.5040104@pitt.edu>

Hi,

On Paraview versions 4.1 and greater if I ssh -X from a Centos machine 
into an Ubuntu
graphics server to run Paraview I have a problem with viewing images.

I load the AnalyzeNifTIIO plugin, and load a nifti image, and I believe 
it loads correctly.
I get the wireframe, the Information panel gives the correct 
cells/point.  If I change to
Slice representation the view window stays blank.  Volume representation 
is fine, I get the
3D rendering.
Same thing if I load a vti format of the data, no slice view.

This happens when I ssh from a Centos machine, it does not happen when I 
ssh from
an Ubuntu machine.   In both cases I believe I am using glx to do the 
rendering locally,
not doing a setenv DISPLAY to ship the rendered picture over the net.
It is the same glx version on the Ubuntu and Centos machine, but they 
have different
graphics cards.

In Paraview ParaView-v4.0.1 I do not have this problem.
I have the problem in Paraview-4.1, 4.2, 4.3.

I am using your pre-compiled binaries as test, but I have the same problem
with my compilation.

Do you know what changed from ParaView-v4.0.1 to ParaView-v4.1 that 
would cause
this or what the workaround is ?

thanks

Kate,

I suspect it's related to this fix:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/92

I tested with the latest git/master and it does render correctly in
client-server mode too.

A workaround would be to use the Slice filter instead. It will be a
little slower and more memory intensive than "Slice" representation,
however.

Silv?re,

There was a bug in the code that traced it where it picked up an
incorrect property name. As a workaround, you can change the
"Rasterize3DGeometry" to "Rasterize3Dgeometry" (note the different
case).

e.g.
ExportView('/tmp/sample.pdf', view=renderView1, Rasterize3Dgeometry=0)

Subject: [Paraview] disable Ubuntu Unity global menu in ParaView
Message-ID: <55AFE46C.2090702@pitt.edu>

Hi,

When I compiled Paraview-4.3.1 on Ubuntu-14.04 the top menu bar for the 
Paraview window
was no longer on the Paraview window but at the top of the console 
screen.   This "global" or
"single" application menu is an Ubuntu  Unity desktop  thing.
To disable this I edited the source code and added
menubar()->setNativeMenuBar(false);
in the paraview code that initializes the application.
I see in the precompiled paraview binaries that you release that the 
menubar does stay
on the paraview application window.   How did you do that ?
Is there a cmake setting I can use to do this instead of editing source 
code ?

thanks
Kate

Now that I can load image (uniform rectilinear grid) data using the 
Python Programmable Source, I'm trying to do this on four gpu nodes 
(using mpirun -np 4 pvserver). Once I load my image, I thought it would 
be automatically distributed (equally) to the four nodes, but coloring 
by process id shows that everything happens on one node. What do I need 
to do (short of writing out four pvti files and reading them back in) to 
automatically distribute my data?

Thanks.

Dear Chuck,

   Finally, I got this done. I could get paraview to configure without
giving any errors. I removed the build directory and started afresh.
However, it fails at the same place during the compilation. Could you
advise as to what might be the problem.

Hi Ganesh,

Can you post your CMakeCache.txt?  Also, if you build with "make VERBOSE=1"
that will give the  full command that gets executed for the failing link
step.  Posting both of those will be helpful.

Hi Stephen,

To my knowledge there is no filter in ParaView to do what you are asking.
For an unstructured grid, it seems to me that no matter where the sample
points are on the line, you are going to need some kind of interpolation at
cell faces and edges where the line intersects the mesh structure to get
the data values to plot. For structured grids, you might be able to plot
values along a 1D subset of the mesh with some work, but not using the Plot
Over Line filter.

Thanks,
Cory

I think you may be able to get what you want if you first do a Slice
through your domain (for 3D only) and then do a Plot on Intersections Curve.

Stephen,

Andy is right, that should work, but it isn't as straightforward as placing
two end points. Instead, you'll need to define the line as the intersection
of two planes, one of which is the plane used to extract the Slice and the
other is the plane from Plot on Intersections Curve. You'll need to
intersect these planes along the line you want to query.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Translucent Rendering  Options
Message-ID: <55B105ED.7030501@lsce.ipsl.fr>

Hi,

Is it possible to render polydata cells without any depth consideration 
when they are rendered with opacity ?

The attached image shows the problem.
The different cells (made from cap of sphere sources) intersect on some 
planes. That is correct.
But I would like to render the cells without this problem of 
intersection of planes by setting some opacity.
So what ever the position of 2 cells, if one is above or bellow or 
intersect the other one, I will see the overlap
  (the information I am looking for actually) from the "addition" of the 
color.
Is it clear ?

I have tried different settings from the Render View on the Translucent 
Rendring Options but without success.

Any idea ?

You can find the vtk file example from 
http://dods.ipsl.jussieu.fr/brocksce/tmp/disk.vtk

Thanks
Patrick

Dear All


I found that I can use VNC server (and which is available to me on my current machine) with the offscreen rendering options to paraview.


VNC server seems to be a proprietary software. Are there free options available?


cheers

Sanjay

I am not wanting to do the visualisation using the PBS -X option, which

will forward the X11 graphics from the compute mnodes to my desktop screen.

I want to do it completely non-interactively.

Agreed. Don't forward X, N compute nodes sending their graphics calls over the network to your desktop is much worse than N times slower.


I could not find any other way of

changing the DISPLAY variable. If there is one, please suggest.


I think it is site specific. Talk with your sys admins about how to submit a job that has access to X displays on the compute nodes.


In the meantime, I am trying to find out of the paraview on our cluster is

compiled to use off screen rendering. I will also try to have a go at using

some precompiled binaries (pvbatch) if I can find any.


Sounds like a good backup plan. If that fails, you can compile paraview for offscreen rendering yourself and run your own binary.


cheers

Sanjay


good luck!

The error message indicates that pv batch can not connect the xwindows.
If the cluster is configured to run X for you, ensure that the job has the correct DISPLAY environment variable.
If not, you should either start X in the job ("xinit pvbatch" or something like that) or recompile paraview to use offscreen rendering.

Dear All

I need to non-interactively make png images of a series of sequentially
numbered vts/vtk files. Since this is a large amount of data, I would like
to do this using a cluster. The cluster has paraview and OpenFoam. I am not
very familiar with OpenFoam, and have just started using Paraview in
terms of python scripts. When I submit the job, I get an error. I gather
that the error is because there is always a blank Paraview OpenGL window
that opens when I use the script below. Can someone suggest a solution?

thanks

error from the pbs job:

Hi Patrick,

have you tried to just get rid of the depth peeling ?
(Settings -> Render view tab -> Advanced mode -> Uncheck the depth 
peeling box) and set an opacity < 1.0 on the object.

Cheers,

Yves

Hi. I do "mpirun -np 4 pvserver --client-host=xxx

see 4 nodes in the memory inspector, but when I start a python shell in 
ParaView, and do:

I get the answer 1. Shouldn't it be 4? Thanks.

pyhon shell runs on the client side.

try doing that within the python programmable filter, which runs on the
server side.

Yes that works. Thanks. Now I will try to use that and follow

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-August/022421.html

to get my existing Image Data producing Python Programmable Source to 
distribute the data across the servers. Any additional advice? Thanks again.

In the e-mail thread quoted below, it says:

Is this still the case, and if so, how does this translate to VTK 6? Thanks.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for your super fast response.
Using a  slice filter I also get no slice image.
I downloaded nightly build ParaView-4.3.1-882-gbdceec7-Linux-64bit
and I still have the problem.  Is that the most recent git/master ?

When you say you think the problem is related to the fix you list,
do you mean that the 15457 fix you needed to do for parallel
slice had the side effect of causing this remote connection issue, or,
do you mean that the parallel slice fix would hopefully solve
the remote connection issue ?

I tried to take a look at the code changes in the fix.
I saw some stuff with extents.   Do you think that the
problem is that the extent is computed incorrectly, eg
way too small, eg 0 ?   Why would that happen only
on the Centos->Ubuntu remote connection ?

thanks very much,
Kate

Hi Kevin,

Here's one way you can get a structured (actually uniform rectilinear) grid
from an unstructured grid:

- start ParaView
- load your unstructured grid
- create a Wavelet source with the extent set to the extent of your desired
structured grid
- Filters -> Resample With Dataset. Set the Input to your unstructured grid
and Source to the Wavelet. Click OK.

HTH,
Cory

putting the following code in your ScriptRequestInformation should tell ParaView that you can handle sub-divisions:

executive = self.GetExecutive ()
outInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)
outInfo.Set(vtk.vtkAlgorithm.CAN_PRODUCE_SUB_EXTENT(), 1)

it is then up to you, to correctly handle UPDATE_EXTENT() and WHOLE_EXTENT() in your Script.

Hi Cory,

I have been doing some experiments with the encoding formats but I've 
not progressed much.

The elements of my mesh are floats and the mesh dimensions are 
201x201x201 (X,Y,Z). I executed all the experiments with 2 MPI processes 
and the data domain was manually partionated by the Z axis, i.e. each 
process computes half of the cube.

The program basically writes, at each position of the mesh, the 
identifier of the MPI process that computed that position (mpi rank). In 
our case, this means that half of the cube has a '0' whereas the other 
portion has a '1'.

Attached to this email you will  a tarball with 3 outputs, one for each 
different encoding (ASCII, zipped binary, raw binary). The size of the 
mesh is 201x201x201 and the only difference among the executions is the 
encoding format.

I hope you could give me some light.

Thanks!

Sergi

Thanks Cory, that did get me a little further. However, at the moment, I am
trying to stream (multiple) vtkPolyData Objects. For Some reason, I can't
get them to update by pieces/blocks (i tried referring to
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Streaming &
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/797).

So I ended up converting them to vtkImageData (but could only load one of
the two). I put them into a vtkAppendFilter() and converted them to a
structured grid and Utilized vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm. I can visualize
either the entire block which contains the two separate Objects, or the
points of each object instead of the Surface Representation of each block.
I'll keep trying to figure it out :-), I'm getting closer (and this helped
so thank you).

Thanks,

Kevin

Subject: [Paraview] Memory seeking problems in using the xdmf2 reader
Message-ID: <E65EBD9CD7A9004A924D2E7C5ED608D58BA250C8@ECS-EXG-P-MB05.win.lanl.gov>

Hello,

I have written a custom xmf file used by the xdmf2 reader to properly read in (raw) binary data into Paraview. This normally works but only for small datasets. The file requires the input of a memory "seek" location to start reading the different scalar components of the data. A problem arises when there is a 512^3 dataset, with 5 scalar components that are required to be read in. The first two scalar components are read in correctly, then the next two components receive the error:


ERROR: In /Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release-Python27/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/Xdmf2/vtkXdmfHeavyData.cxx, line 1128

vtkXdmfReader (0x7f8614672af0): Failed to read attribute data

The 5th component then becomes a duplicate of the 1st component.
What I believe that's happening is that the "seek" value is only being represented as a signed integer, this would explain the memory location rolling from MAX_INT to -MAX_INT, and failing to read in scalar components 3 and 4. Their seek locations fall within this case. By the time the 5th component is read, the seek value may have rolled over back to positive values (seek > 0) and then duplicates the same data as the 1st component.

Is this assumption correct and intended? Is there fix for this or an alternative way around reading large, raw datasets using this format? I'm attaching a sample xmf file

Thank you,
Jesus

Hi,

No slice appears with wavelet source.

Casey,

Understood.  I will continue to look into it.

I have run into another roadblock that I was thinking you might
understand.  I have the following VTK libraries linked in all of my PCL
solution projects with the incorrect name:

They show up as:
vtkutilitiespythoninitializer.lib
vtkSciberQuest.lib
vtkQvis.lib
vtkPVPythonCatalyst.lib
vtkPVCatalystTestDriver.lib
vtkPointSpriteRendering.lib
vtkPointSpriteGraphics.lib
vtkeyedomelighting.lib

When they should show up as:
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\lib\Debug\vtkEyeDomeLighting-pv4.3.lib
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\lib\Debug\vtkPointSpriteGraphics-pv4.3.lib
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\lib\Debug\vtkPointSpriteRendering-pv4.3.lib
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\lib\Debug\vtkPVPythonCatalyst-pv4.3.lib
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\lib\Debug\vtkQvis-pv4.3.lib
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\lib\Debug\vtkSciberQuest-pv4.3.lib
C:\Users\eric.g.younkin\Documents\PCL_ParaView\ParaView-v4.3.1-source\build\lib\Debug\vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer-pv4.3.lib

I can't seem to find where these libraries are originally linked on
configuration.  Am I missing something in CMake?  Is there a particular
CMake file that addresses all of these?

Thanks,
Eric

Dear David, All

I am now using VNC and got my scripts to do non-interactive viz, i.e.
making of png files using the script below. However, I have a question
regarding efficiency of the run.

As of now, I am doing a serial run. The first several png files are produced
swiftly. However, eventually, the run slows down considerably.
e.g. files 1 to 200 are at a rate of 10 per second
but files 300 to 35 are almost 1 every 2 minutes.#

Any ideas why this is, and how to rectify this? Isthis a memory leak and if so
how not do introduce this when making the .py script using the trace option
in the GUI?

cheers
Sanjay

I think your memory usage is growing with each iteration, Try moving
everything out of the loop and then just changing what you have to in the
fixed pipeline inside the loop.


i = 415
RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

Render()
WriteImage("Endo_dir_%06i.png" % (i))

I just did that, and the 4000 file run finished in 15 minutes!


Just for completeness, I would like to know this: What was the part in my

script that was allocating memory at each call of the iteration, causing

a progressive increase of memory use (and thus time)?


I could take a guess, but that would just be a guess, so any responses

are appreciated.


cheers

Sanjay

Dear David, All

I am now using VNC and got my scripts to do non-interactive viz, i.e.
making of png files using the script below. However, I have a question
regarding efficiency of the run.

As of now, I am doing a serial run. The first several png files are produced
swiftly. However, eventually, the run slows down considerably.
e.g. files 1 to 200 are at a rate of 10 per second
but files 300 to 35 are almost 1 every 2 minutes.#

Any ideas why this is, and how to rectify this? Isthis a memory leak and if so
how not do introduce this when making the .py script using the trace option
in the GUI?

cheers
Sanjay

I think it was the new reader each iteration, and also possibly the new
representation (output of Show()).
They stick around because of reference counting, even when they go out of
scope the view still has access to them, so they aren't deallocated.

hth and glad to got it working!

You are making a new reader, but never connecting it to the View.

not:
  HumanSAN000001_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['HumanSAN%06i.vtk' %
(j)] )
rather
  HumanSAN000001_vtk.FileNames=['HumanSAN%06i.vtk' % (j)]

try that

that was one of the combinations I tried, and it didnt work.


I am looking at the ParaView wiki right now. Appareltly there is a Delete(XX)

which should be used to delete objects. I am trying to work out what to

Delete and what not to delete.

You are making a new reader, but never connecting it to the View.

not:
  HumanSAN000001_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['HumanSAN%06i.vtk' % (j)] )
rather
  HumanSAN000001_vtk.FileNames=['HumanSAN%06i.vtk' % (j)]

try that

I think your memory usage is growing with each iteration, Try moving everything out of the loop and then just changing what you have to in the fixed pipeline inside the loop.


i = 415
RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
?
Render()
WriteImage("Endo_dir_%06i.png" % (i))
for i in range(416?):
   HumanSAN000001_vtk.FileName='HumanSAN%06i.vtk' % (i)

Dear David, All

I am now using VNC and got my scripts to do non-interactive viz, i.e.
making of png files using the script below. However, I have a question
regarding efficiency of the run.

As of now, I am doing a serial run. The first several png files are produced
swiftly. However, eventually, the run slows down considerably.
e.g. files 1 to 200 are at a rate of 10 per second
but files 300 to 35 are almost 1 every 2 minutes.#

Any ideas why this is, and how to rectify this? Isthis a memory leak and if so
how not do introduce this when making the .py script using the trace option
in the GUI?

cheers

Try to do this with some similar data in the python GUI's Tools->Python
Shell on your local machine.

That way you get tab completion and can see things happen in the GUI to
help you learn the syntax.

addressed my reply to only Chuck. I'm sorry (reply vs. reply all).

I've uploaded the CMakeCache.txt here
https://psu.box.com/s/xsrbpsu73exqmz6v1rsy8jy2mtyzabhk.

This is the error message when using the verbose option.

Casey,

I ended up manually changing the additional dependencies I referenced above
for all projects.  Never figured where they were in the cmake files.  I
think some of them were related to the plugins I had enabled.

I am now configuring the PCL Plugin and I'm finding a few things that I
haven't seen while configuring PCL or Paraview.  CMake output below:

Configuring done


Is there something I can change to allow the QT 5.4.1 libraries to be
recognized?  I saw a few references to QT4 in the CMakeLists.  Also,  I
would really like to build with PCAP support.  I have added the library
path in CMake, but it still says it is disabled (see above).  If you have
any ideas, I would welcome your advice.


Thanks,
Eric

Hi Dave, All


I will work through the Python shell of the GUI in the next few days, but I need to do a satisfactory viz now.

I may have a working solution which is not perfect.


Looking into the mailing list's archives and doing a general google search, I found that Delete 'ing

the view and the object makes it easier on the memory, and I get a fast viz simulation.

However, the viz does progressively slow down.  Files 1 to 100 come out at 50 per second.

Files 2000 to 2100 come out 10 per second.


cheers

Sanjay

Try to do this with some similar data in the python GUI's Tools->Python Shell on your local machine.

That way you get tab completion and can see things happen in the GUI to help you learn the syntax.

I am looking at the ParaView wiki right now. Appareltly there is a Delete(XX)

which should be used to delete objects. I am trying to work out what to

Delete and what not to delete.

You are making a new reader, but never connecting it to the View.

not:
  HumanSAN000001_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['HumanSAN%06i.vtk' % (j)] )
rather
  HumanSAN000001_vtk.FileNames=['HumanSAN%06i.vtk' % (j)]

try that

I think your memory usage is growing with each iteration, Try moving everything out of the loop and then just changing what you have to in the fixed pipeline inside the loop.


i = 415
RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
...
Render()
WriteImage("Endo_dir_%06i.png" % (i))

Dear David, All

I am now using VNC and got my scripts to do non-interactive viz, i.e.
making of png files using the script below. However, I have a question
regarding efficiency of the run.

As of now, I am doing a serial run. The first several png files are produced
swiftly. However, eventually, the run slows down considerably.
e.g. files 1 to 200 are at a rate of 10 per second
but files 300 to 35 are almost 1 every 2 minutes.#

Any ideas why this is, and how to rectify this? Isthis a memory leak and if so
how not do introduce this when making the .py script using the trace option
in the GUI?

Message-ID: <CAPHwKk7_6tpmjwkLC5CnSm1jx5==HhvMJ=ENJ4T85dS-TmrcEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is there a way to select all the cells that share the same ProcessId (or
other field) without using my mouse to click or drag over every one? My
goal is to use ParaView to visualize the results of several simulations in
parallel, with each process handling the visualization of a single
simulation. Along that same line, is there a way ParaView can make each
process look into a different directory of simulation data so I can
accomplish this?

Thanks,
Krishna Pai

Hi all,

I apply the Glyph filter to the velocity field with zero vectors at the
walls.
At that time, to plot the normalized vectors, I set the "Scale Mode"
property to off. But Glyph filter is drawing arrows oriented along (1, 0,
0) for zero vectors.

Do you have any idea that I could plot normalized zero vectors that have no
length?

You can use the "Find Data" dialog to select all elements with a particular field value as well as many other selection criteria. This feature is documented in the most recent version of both the ParaView Tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) and the ParaView Guide (http://www.paraview.org/paraview-guide/). Both are available for free, and "find data" is referenced in the index of each.

Thanks Ken,

For some reason, I wasn't finding success with Find Data (every query I
tried resulted in an empty table), but I was able to use a combination of
the ProcessIdScalars and the Threshold filters to do what I wanted, shortly
before you replied.

Message-ID: <A26AAC9B-7CB6-4DFB-B5ED-048B995AE55E@udel.edu>

Greetings all,

  Attached is a rendering I constructed with Paraview. I turned the StreamTracer on so you can see the purpose behind my question.

 The StreamTracer (thin blue lines) is in the correct position, however the yellow Tube is not (it?s translated by 5 units on the y-axis as I soon discovered).

  My question is - is there some type of automatic setting with Tubes in Paraview? I didn?t touch the translation at all, so I?m curious why the Tubes are pushed out a bit.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] How to assign separate parallel pvserver processes to
 separate independent datasets?
Message-ID: <CAPHwKk48ggjkoDaJ+1Tfaez7ASgz3cFXKgosWMzYUx+ZEXzy6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I know that, normally, ParaView works with one large dataset and partitions
it based on the number of processes, then renders and merges the results,
which I can then view on my ParaView GUI locally. What I want to do is take
a bunch of independent datasets and make each parallel process render them
without partitioning them further. In other words, I want a one-to-one
correspondence between a parallel process and a dataset with the ability to
view them separately locally (which I can do by filtering by Process ID).
So far, I've tried opening a couple of datasets separately and
simultaneously (using ctrl to select them both), and combined them with
AppendDatasets to see if they would separate out in the way I want. That
didn't work. In both instances, ParaView partitioned each dataset and
rendered a part of them in each process. I would appreciate any tips.

Thanks,
Krishna Pai

   - Add /bigobj to the project properties in Visual Studio

Now I am trying to compile the Paraview PythonQT Plugin and I get the

Anyone have any idea what that is from?  I know this is generally because
an library file isn't properly linked, but I have no idea which one or how
to tell.

Hey Guys,

I have successfully built a recent commit in the paraview repository. I
would like to do some testing against the most recent paraview release
(4.3.1), however when I check out the release branch and try to configure
with cmake I get the error below. I am building on windows with visual
studio 2010. Can anyone explain this error?

Cheers,
Bruce

Did you run

git submodule update

after checking out the commit of ParaView you want to build? It looks like
your VTK may not be the right one.

Thanks,

CosmoTools is part of a closed-source project at ANL.  The
COSMOTOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR is incorrect and you need to provide the
COSMOTOOLS_LIBRARIES variable with the external library to link against.
The small part of it that the ParaView module depends on was added to
ParaView so that we wouldn't have the closed-source dependency.
Unfortunately, that change didn't make it into 4.3.1, but if you build
against ParaView's master branch, you will no longer need the closed source
cosmotools package and will still have most of the features in the
CosmoTools module.

HTH,
Shawn

Cory,

Thank you for your response. This works fine.
I hope that Glyph filter has the feature to always remove glyphs for zero
vectors.
Thank you again for your help.

Best,
yoshimi

Subject: [Paraview] Reg. paraview using off
Message-ID: <CAFtK+eubFC-2qodP-4sA66uvknW5d5tbSA7PApWmXypG-joseg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

  I'm trying to install paraview using off-screen rendering on a cluster. I
attached my CMakeCache. It configures just fine. However, I'm unable to
progress beyond this error during the compile. Could anyone please help?
I load the required modules first

module load gcc/4.9.2
module load cmake/3.1.0
module load python/2.7.9
module load hdf5/1.8.14
export HDF5_ROOT=/opt/aci/sw/gcc/hdf5/1.8.14_gcc-4.9.2/
export PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS=/opt/aci/sw/python27/2.7.9_gcc-4.9.2-1/include/
export PYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/aci/sw/python27/2.7.9_gcc-4.9.2-1/lib/
libpython2.7.so
export PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/aci/sw/python27/2.7.9_gcc-4.9.2-1/bin/python

Then, I configured as

ccmake ~/software/ParaView-v4.3.1-source
-DOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/storage/home/guv106/software/mesa-10.5.4/include
-DOSMESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/storage/home/guv106/software/mesa-10.5.4/lib/gallium/libOSMesa.so
-DVTK_USE_X:BOOL=OFF  -DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=ON
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS=/opt/aci/sw/python27/2.7.9_gcc-4.9.2-1/include/python2.7/

The error during the make process is

Subject: [Paraview] How to assign separate parallel pvserver processes

The closest thing I can think of is doing this in batch. Information on
that is available at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Spatio-Temporal_Parallelism. It's probably
doable in ParaView but would likely take significant amount of
modification.

Check this out:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D#Configuring_ParaView_for_use_with_OSMesa

You're missing several other flags needed for ParaView to use OSMesa
e.g. VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA. Also, your CMakeCache.txt shows that
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY, OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY, OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR are set to
use system OpenGL. That will cause runtime issues. The Wiki indicates
the values that these should be set to.

Thanks for the recommendation, Andy. I've decided to use the
spatio-temporal parallelism plugin for a different application: I've found
that D3 re-partitions my data every time step, and I think this plugin
might be a better way to handle my spatio-temporal data. However, the
instructions on the wiki say to run it using pvbatch, which, as far as I
know, doesn't allow for interactive visualizations. Is there a way to
somehow run the python script it generates through the ParaView GUI instead
of by mpirunning pvbatch to allow for interactivity?

Subject: [Paraview] adjusting vertical level setting via paraview python
	script
Message-ID: <D1DF8851.718%aeatmon@lanl.gov>

I?m one of the DSS interns working under Jim Ahrens for the summer. I am using paraviews python script in the HPC and I?m having an issue adjusting an attribute of paraview.simple.netcdfmpasreader ?VerticalLevel?.

I want to adjust it from the default to one and attempted:

paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = 1
paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = ?1'
And
paraview.simple.GetActiveSource().VerticalLevel = 1

The first two operate with no errors doing nothing in the program and the last returns an error that the class bars adding attributes to prevent errors due to spelling.

How do I adjust the vertical level setting?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] adjusting vertical level setting via paraview python script

I added a line to the code to explicitly set the value to 0 and ran the script again, however it still does not adjust the vertical level.

I added paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.ShowMultilayerView = 0
And then set vertical level to two different values and saw no change in the output.

Is my syntax correct? Should the values be defined in the above way or as  ?ShowMultilayerView = ?1? ?

As a followup to my last reply, I?m pasting the script below for reference because there may be a problem within of which I am not aware. The script is not too clean, though.

Also attached is an image of the output where I see the vertical level still needs to be turned down.

paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = 1
paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = ?1'
And
paraview.simple.GetActiveSource().VerticalLevel = 1

The first two operate with no errors doing nothing in the program and the last returns an error that the class bars adding attributes to prevent errors due to spelling.

How do I adjust the vertical level setting?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Subject: [Paraview] Using SpatioTemporalParallelism plugin in ParaView
Message-ID: <CAPHwKk6esyqjhDVVjiQ9+4BDrPjicDs-mjuj4VxOfm_risekTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been working with spatio-temporal data stored in an xdmf file. I found
that ParaView doesn't handle parallel processing of this file well, so I
thought I would use the SpatioTemporalParallelism plugin to partition the
data better. I chose the Parallel Image Data Writer to write to a .pvti
before using the plugin to export state. Once the python script was
generated, and I tried running it with pvbatch, I got the following error
message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./yoda.py", line 26, in <module>
    xdmf_test_v01xdmf = STP.CreateReader(XDMFReader,
fileinfo='/lustre/cmf/scratch/k/kpai/projects/NeptuneData_2015-07-28/xdmf_test_v01.xdmf')
TypeError: CreateReader() takes exactly 2 non-keyword arguments (1 given)

The file path above is to the xdmf file on a remote machine.
I'm not sure what other arguments need to be given, considering the script
was generated by ParaView (maybe I exported state incorrectly?). I would
appreciate any help.

Thanks,
Krishna Pai

I verified in the GUI that I can change the level and see it take effect,
so it should work in principle. You might want to open that file in the
paraView GUI and do the same exercise.

In your script a couple of bits looks fishy to me and might cause the
problem.

paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.PointArrayStatus = ['temperature']
paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.ShowMultilayerView = 0
paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = '1' *#use = 1 not = '1'*

later

paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = 1

just do it one time


I think the above all do something like set propeties of the global
netcdmfmpasreader class, not the one specific instance of that class that
you care about.

# get active source.
# Level2 = paraview.simple.GetActiveSource()
# Level2.VerticalLevel = 1

this is closer, try
level2=paraview.simple.FindSource('X_Y_Z_1LAYER-primal')

or better yet, since it is defined early on just

Layer2 = output00240101_000000nc

Either should give you the specific instance and then you can call
Layer2.VerticalLevel
= 1 on it.

Subject: [Paraview] adjusting vertical level setting via paraview python
 script

I noticed when pasting into the email and tried to change them, but the problem still persists even when adjusting them as you stated


  # Properties modified on output00240101_000000nc

      paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.PointArrayStatus = ['temperature']

      paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.ShowMultilayerView = 0

      paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = 32



And I commented the repeating lines out




      # paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.ShowMultilayerView = 0

      # paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = 1


 However output remains exactly the same even adjusting the vertical level to something like 33 that would return an extremely noticeable difference.



I do see it is possible in the GUI however, it works exactly as it should there.
On a wing of faith, I also tried formatting as = [?1?] and that did not work either.

Thank you for your continuing assistance by the way, I asked around and it does seem to be a difficult issue to remedy.

Subject: [Paraview] Differences between OpenGL and OpenGL2 versions of
	ParaView
Message-ID: <CANjddW2ooLsY9yo+7+-ON9-uRftDmvc0CiMNS1qCy_6bb2-bOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,  I'm trying to use ParaView built with OpenGL2, hoping to see some
speed improvement when I interact with my visualization. Indeed for a
complicated geometry I see significant speed up (e.g. ~25 fps with OpenGL2
vs. 5 fps with regular ParaView). But I also see serious errors in the
display. I've attached two images of our "g-2 muon storage ring" (never
mind what it actually is, though it is very cool :-) ..

[image: Inline image 1]

The first, mostly blue image, is from regular ParaView (downloaded Mac
binary 4.3.1 64 bit)  and is what the ring is supposed to look like. There
is a color vector selected and I've unchecked "Map scalars" so that the
colors are "true". And indeed the RGB color values in the vector are what
is shown on the display.


[image: Inline image 2]
The next image, with a chunk on the left side missing, is from the OpenGL2
ParaView (Mac built from source 4.3.1-882-gbdceec7 64 bit) configured
identically as the other ParaView. So it should look identical to the
mostly blue picture. Along with the missing chunk, you see the colors look
very wrong. What's even stranger is that the missing chunk is really
missing - not invisible - the visualization is made of multiblock datasets,
and right clicking where a structure should be only brings up the link
camera option.

You can try this yourself -- see
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/900ocfc90v0w3r6/AACmqz8kVrGPUMnJbpxAFOzBa?dl=0 .
The "gm2ring.zip" file has gm2ring.vtm (with the corresponding gm2ring
directory) and gm2ring.pvsm to restore my configuration.

I'm looking forward to using the OpenGL2 version when it works better. I
hope this helps in working out its kinks (or hoping to find out I've built
or configured something incorrectly). Let me know how I can help!  Thanks!

      Layer2.VerticalLevel = 32


Also,

I tried both of the above both individually with the other commented out and running at the same time, they both return that the attribute VerticalLevel does not exist in that class. It seems to solely exist in paraview.simple.NetCDFreader.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] adjusting vertical level setting via paraview python script

I verified in the GUI that I can change the level and see it take effect, so it should work in principle. You might want to open that file in the paraView GUI and do the same exercise.

In your script a couple of bits looks fishy to me and might cause the problem.

paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.PointArrayStatus = ['temperature']
paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.ShowMultilayerView = 0
paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = '1' #use = 1 not = '1'

later

paraview.simple.NetCDFMPASreader.VerticalLevel = 1

just do it one time


I think the above all do something like set propeties of the global netcdmfmpasreader class, not the one specific instance of that class that you care about.

# get active source.
# Level2 = paraview.simple.GetActiveSource()
# Level2.VerticalLevel = 1

this is closer, try
level2=paraview.simple.FindSource('X_Y_Z_1LAYER-primal')

or better yet, since it is defined early on just

Layer2 = output00240101_000000nc

Either should give you the specific instance and then you can call Layer2.VerticalLevel = 1 on it.

As a followup to my last reply, I?m pasting the script below for reference because there may be a problem within of which I am not aware. The script is not too clean, though.

Also attached is an image of the output where I see the vertical level still needs to be turned down.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] adjusting vertical level setting via paraview python script

Regarding the adding attributes error message, it is likely that the ActiveSource is not an MPAS reader at that point in time.
?GetActiveSource().__class__ should tell your what it is.

Regarding the level setting - what is yourReader.ShowMultilayerView?
The docs indicated a value of 1 makes VerticalLayer immaterial.

The first two operate with no errors doing nothing in the program and the last returns an error that the class bars adding attributes to prevent errors due to spelling.

How do I adjust the vertical level setting?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Thanks all. This is super awesome and now allows me to get real time
updates on the status of simulations instead of wheeling the data out to
some other place.. tarring, scping, untarring.... phew!

Hi David,

The patch did not work, the file is still not read correctly after the second scalar component.

After applying your patch, I did a bit of debugging myself. I enabled XDMF Debug in the code and found that the seek values are incorrect for scalar fields 3, 4, and 6.
They seem to be stuck at the value 2147483647. On the plus side, it looks like the array size (array size in bytes) is being computed correctly.

Please take a look at the parsed debug log file that I've attached. Maybe the seek value is being malformed somewhere before it reaches XdmfValuesBinary.cxx?

Thanks,
Jesus

Hello,

I have written a custom xmf file used by the xdmf2 reader to properly read in (raw) binary data into Paraview. This normally works but only for small datasets. The file requires the input of a memory "seek" location to start reading the different scalar components of the data. A problem arises when there is a 512^3 dataset, with 5 scalar components that are required to be read in. The first two scalar components are read in correctly, then the next two components receive the error:


ERROR: In /Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release-Python27/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/Xdmf2/vtkXdmfHeavyData.cxx, line 1128

vtkXdmfReader (0x7f8614672af0): Failed to read attribute data

The 5th component then becomes a duplicate of the 1st component.
What I believe that's happening is that the "seek" value is only being represented as a signed integer, this would explain the memory location rolling from MAX_INT to -MAX_INT, and failing to read in scalar components 3 and 4. Their seek locations fall within this case. By the time the 5th component is read, the seek value may have rolled over back to positive values (seek > 0) and then duplicates the same data as the 1st component.

Is this assumption correct and intended? Is there fix for this or an alternative way around reading large, raw datasets using this format? I'm attaching a sample xmf file

Thank you,
Jesus

If I?m not mistaken, it should be called like this

xdmf_test_v01xdmf = STP.CreateReader(XDMFReader, '/lustre/cmf/scratch/k/kpai/projects/NeptuneData_2015-07-28/xdmf_test_v01.xdmf')

That is, without the keyword argument fileinfo='<path>'

Subject: [Paraview] Using SpatioTemporalParallelism plugin in ParaView

Hi all,
I've been working with spatio-temporal data stored in an xdmf file. I found that ParaView doesn't handle parallel processing of this file well, so I thought I would use the SpatioTemporalParallelism plugin to partition the data better. I chose the Parallel Image Data Writer to write to a .pvti before using the plugin to export state. Once the python script was generated, and I tried running it with pvbatch, I got the following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./yoda.py", line 26, in <module>
    xdmf_test_v01xdmf = STP.CreateReader(XDMFReader, fileinfo='/lustre/cmf/scratch/k/kpai/projects/NeptuneData_2015-07-28/xdmf_test_v01.xdmf')
TypeError: CreateReader() takes exactly 2 non-keyword arguments (1 given)
The file path above is to the xdmf file on a remote machine.
I'm not sure what other arguments need to be given, considering the script was generated by ParaView (maybe I exported state incorrectly?). I would appreciate any help.
Thanks,
Krishna Pai

Subject: [Paraview] Differences between OpenGL and OpenGL2 versions of
	ParaView

Adam,

The color difference can be explained by the default coloring mode
introduced recently (before the git tag version you tested with).
Multiblocks are now automatically colored by blocks. Toggle the Color
Legend and see the coloring array, "vtkBlockColors" is selected wereas in
previous version it was Solid Color I guess.
Regarding the missing pieces, I can tell that with the same git version and
with the OpenGL backend 1 (the old), all pieces are correctly drawn. What
is specific is that this missing blocks (the data has like a global gemetry
block + all the internal pieces) are the last block if the first level
block hierarchy.

Hi Joachim - Yes, I noticed that the default color is now vtkBlockColors.
However I changed that to the "color" vector in my data and that change was
not honored by the program. Thanks, Adam

Thanks for the reply, Menno. I tried doing that before, but I got a
segmentation fault due to a missing filename, and I'm not sure where in the
function call for CreateReader I would put a file name or what file name I
should use. I ended up getting the following error message along with 2
slight variations on it, followed by the segmentation fault message:

ERROR: In
/lustre/cmf/scratch/k/kpai/projects/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/VTK/IO/Xdmf2/vtkXdmfReader.cxx,
line 189
vtkXdmfReader (0x48997f0): File name not set

ERROR: In
/lustre/cmf/scratch/k/kpai/projects/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkExecutive.cxx,
line 784
vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (0x489fe20): Algorithm
vtkFileSeriesReader(0x489de90) returned failure for request: vtkInformation

  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 165325
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT
  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1

Unless there's a bug in the plugin, I don't think this should be happening
if I input the required information correctly. Here's what I did:

1. I opened the xdmf file in ParaView and added a ParallelImageDataWriter
to it in the pipeline. In the File Name field of ParallelImageDataWriter, I
entered output%t.pvti. I expect the output files to be in this form if I
understand what ParallelImageDataWriter does correctly.

2. I exported state from the SpatioTemporal menu. As my xdmf file was the
only file in the pipeline, I simply added it.

3. Next, as the xdmf file gets its data from binary files in a separate
directory, I entered the file path to those files in the file location
field (i.e. <path>/NeptuneData_2015-07-28/0000/f*.bin). I think this is
where the plugin will get its data (this may be where the problem is).

4. Finally, I chose not to output images, entered a time compartment size
of 4, and chose a location to save the generated python script.

Obviously, the generated script contained the fileinfo=<path> argument in
the CreateReader call among other issues, and I just want to understand
what's going wrong. As always, any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Krishna Pai

Message-ID: <CAEc4V-ZjcqgdVpR9Cf=Yz4EL2gwXY6v=pqrKy5NpGwgh0nzPvA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to build the superbuild for x64 on windows. I have configured
everything with cmake (i have only selected ENABLE_paraview and ENABLE_qt)
and am trying to do a release build. The build fails with,

7>  CMake Error at VTK/CMake/vtkModuleAPI.cmake:53 (message):
7>    No such module: "vtkCommonDataModel"

Any suggestions?

Cheers,
Bruce

I've attached the xdmf file and the generated python script for
clarification.

What CMake generator did you use? The superbuild is only tested with
Ninja on Windows:

    C:\> REM Open a VS2010 x64 Command Tools Prompt
    C:\> cmake -GNinja ../path/to/superbuild/source
    C:\> REM Edit configuration in cmake-gui
    C:\> ninja

Ninja is available from:

    https://martine.github.io/ninja

if you do not have it already.

Hi all,


I have noticed that  the max and min values of the x, y, and z coordinates of all of the vertices are displayed at the bottom of the 'Information' tab when I load a computational grid file into Paraview.  Is there a way to extract this information via a Python call to the Paraview library?

Thank you,

Here is a state file to try, and the snapshot I created.

The sampling resolution is set to be 128x64. You can change that to anything you want, in the ProgrammableSource. Two objects are created (a sphere and a plane). The sphere is used to resample the volume. The plane is used, to "flatten" the data copied over from the sphere.

Details on how to use the Programmable Sources and Filters are in the PV Guide (Chapter 13)

let me know if this works.

Hi Andras,

Please find the patchs attached. If you run into issues let me know. I
should mention that apply these patches at your discretion as I have not
done enough testing to ensure the quality of the patches but the test
passed last time I applied them.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom animation help?
Message-ID: <3EA27BD7-25EE-4A60-8229-64ABE18836AC@udel.edu>

Greetings all,

   I?m trying to make an animation in Paraview. I took a stab at it before with Paraview, but I recall it as being tedious. Maybe I can get some pointers from the experts.

  So, the attached imaged is a cube view of the electromagnetic response over sea ice. What Im trying to do with this animation is two things:

  1.) Move the horizontal slice and Y-Z vertical slice (the slice without the tubes) up and down, and side to side, respectively, such that as if you selected the particular slide in the Pipeline browser, you could drag the slice in question and move it manually to see the different responses. Therefore I?m trying to automate it.

  2.) Rotate it about the z-axis 5 degrees (to about 180) at each iteration and return, then rotate it 5 degrees at each iteration about the y-axis (till about 45 degrees) and return. These rotations will occur while ?action item" 1 is happening.

   Any thoughts/suggestions?

    Thanks!
    Jesse

Hi,

Thanks for your reply.

Of course I have data to share. The rmed result comressed file is too 
big (35 MB), so I send here the hdf and comm files, you only need to 
compute the (3) meshes and to run the simulation to have this rmed file.

Say me if you need something else, I hope all is clear enough like this   :)

Amel
