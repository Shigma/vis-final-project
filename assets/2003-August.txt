I upgraded from 0.6 to 1.0 today.  I'm running on Win2K.  I get
an error message, and not sure if it is serious or not.  Could be
a bug in my environment.  I can send details if that would help.

thanks,

I am not able to input a 2D mesh.  Should that work?  I can specify
a flat 3D mesh, with all z coords == 0.0.  Is that what I should

What is the difference between specifying data as a FIELD with 1 component

Scalars are also stored in the field data, but scalars are marked as 
special and many filters look for this special/default array.  If you 
specify attribute data as a field, then you will have to do addition stuff 
to get filters to process this array (or color an actor by this array).

VTK only has 3 component points, so for 2D meshes you would have to set one 
component (z) to 0.0.

That's clear.  If I recall from some other email, it is possible to input
only one SCALAR field, right?

Thanks for the response.

BTW, the upgrade from .6 to 1.0 is very smooth.  You guys have done a
great job.

Now that 1.0 is out, I'd like to learn how to input transient

tell ParaView about this?  Can I use the XML file format (.vts files)?  I
think that for now I have to replicate the mesh in every file, right?  Is
there some naming convention I should use for the different time steps?

I've looked through the (very execellent) User Guide and Quick Start docs,

Hi Dave,

We usually do something like:

mpirun -np 8 paraview

There are couple of issues though.

1. Your mpi has to be configured properly.
2. If you use binaries, they are not build with MPI. You should build
paraview with mpi support.

Dave,

Just running ParaView with MPI will put the user interface on the MPI 
process 0.

You can also run paraview client/server:

mpirun -np 4 paraview --server
paraview --client --host=...


The user interface is created on the client of course.

Charles.

Hello,
	I am using vtkLOD actor and I have defined an LOD(by addLODMapper which
takes output from vtkDecimatePro) . I have noticed that there is a delay of
3 to 4 second when I try to move it for the first time after it has been
loaded. Then onwards the object moves/rotates normally. This happens in
Paraview(version .6) as well if I change the LOD threshold and try to move
the object.(I am talking about reasonably large datasets 15 MB binary stl
file) . Is there any workaround for this problem?

Thanks

Dave,

Tiled displays are being actively developed.  Two options have made it into 
the ParaView 1.0 release (Chromium will be later).  ParaView has a native 
option which is the default.  You have to run with the command line options 
(for a 3x4 tiled display):

server:
mpirun -np 12 paraview --server
client:
paraview --client --host=serverName -td -tdx=4 -tdy=3

This "render module"  will duplicate small geometry on all tile processes, 
and composite large geometry.



The second option uses the IceT rendering library developed at Sandia.
You have to compile IceT (available by CVS on paraview.org) and configure 
ParaView to link to the IceT libraries.
You then can run:

server:
mpirun -np 12 paraview --server
client:
paraview --client --host=serverName -td -tdx=4 -tdy=3 
--render-module=IceTDisplayRenderModule


This module does not currently have all the features of the native tiled 
display render module, but it has better compositing performance.

Charles.

Ok, success! I was able to fire up paraview on 4 nodes of our cluster. Our 
cluster also runs
a tiled display. I fired up the display to see what running across the 
nodes would do. I was
under the impression that running in parallel would place a render window 
on each node. I
saw no such behavior. I assume that geometry is created in parallel and the 
head node
renders in the default setup. I noticed some rendering controls on the 
console. What are
the settings for parallel rendering?

Thanks,
Dave

Dave,

If geometry is small, then ParaView does not bother 
compositing.  Everything gets rendered on client (or process 0 if running 
straight MPI).

There is a slider in view properties called composite threshold.  It allows 
the user control when distributed rendering occurs.

Subject: [Paraview] Tiled Displays
Message-ID: <00c401c35eaa$da4a9cc0$04361cac@F2GO>

Hi ParaViewers...

I have made a translator between vtk and OpenSceneGraph
(www.openscenegraph.org),
so that vtk actors can be displayed as OSG Geodes. The main purpose is to
get a better
and more flexible display than that ParaView can offer, enabling cluster
support (such that
2x4 PCs e.g. can render each (stereo) side in a 4 sided CAVE). I have
already experimented
a little with ParaViews Tiled display support, but have found that it
doesn't work on windows(?)
and can't see from the manual how it distributes each tile and how you
specify which computer
is connected to which part of your tiled display.

What is currently beeing done on this in ParaView? Is CAVE support (via a PC
cluster) on its way?
or is my OSG coupling welcomed? Would it be easier to just use the existing
framework in ParaView
using MPI to do the job?

Subject: [Paraview] Probe filter
Message-ID: <1661.128.165.144.120.1060817093.squirrel@webmail.pair.com>

I'd like to use the Probe filter in Paraview.  I've
got a number of fields in my data, some scalar and some vector.
How do I tell the probe which field to probe?  It seems
to be probing one component of one of my vector fields.

thanks,

I believe that the ParaView file are written correctly but only the mesh
is plotted correctly. All the values for the density are zero. Any idea
where to start looking to resolve the problem?

Thanks for the tip on using Probe.  Connecting to
it from a Calculator works fine.

Another question, though.  I'm having trouble updating the
XY-plot.  I'd like the XY plot to be updated as I go through an animation.
 That doesn't happen, though.  Instead, the only way I can get an update
is to uncheck "Show XY-plot", Accept, check "Show XY-plot", Accept again,
and then the correct information shows.  I probably have a misconception
about how this should work.  But, is there a way to have the probe update
automatically?

thanks,

This is a bug.  As a work around, you can use the animation script editor 
to update the probe module.

Find the probe module name with (command prompt)

vtkPVProbe ListInstances
vtkTemp533

Then call

vtkTemp533 AcceptCallback
as an animation script.

Of course, the vtkTemp533 will replaced by what ever your probe module is 
named.

Would these be parallelisable?

Hi Dan,

ParaView would work fine on 4 node Linux cluster. I would invest a bit
of money to get a gigabit ethernet, otherwise the network file system
will eat in your bandidth. Also, since you do not have graphics card,
each node will have to do software rendering. Depending on the number of
polygons ParaView will display, you will get various results. 

So, I would say processor power, memory, and network are places where
you should not be cheap. What hardware do you have in mind?

Hi Andy,

So is it possible to have a good openGL enable graphics card on each=20
node to do some number crunching, and send the results back to the=20
master node.
I thought  everything on the graphics card went in only 1 direction:=20
out to the monitor?

I was thinking 4 Athalon equipped motherboards with 1Gb ram and normal=20=

ethernet cards, that each boot off the master node, so no hard disks or=20=

video cards.
I guess without the videocard hardware acceleration on each node, the=20
nodes wouldn't really speed up the openGL display on the master node=20
(with a nice videocard), since software rendering is so much slower=20
than hardware?

What i am looking for is fast interactive display of large datasets,=20
using isosurfaces or even better true volume rendering (which I know=20
isn't in paraview yet, but i can do it with some other vtk tools, ie=20
Mayavi with the experimental volume module. Volume rendering with=20
composite ray cast function is slow at high quality settings, that is=20
what I want to speed up. It would be nice if the hardware stereo wasn't=20=

Are you telling me that parrallelisation of the vtkVolumeRayCastMapper=20=

Hi Dan,

You should think of graphic card as two things:

1. Almost general purpose computer wich is optimized for doing graphics
stuff, such as OpenGL, ...
2. Something that takes frame buffer and sends it to the monitor. 

You can take frame buffer and send it back to the main CPU though. That
is what ParaView does.

Depending on where the bottleneck is. If it is in the displaying, then
you will lose. If it is in the number crunching, then you win. The
second thing is especially the case when the number crunching part can
be parallelized. ParaView does a great job in that. If you do not have
space problem, then I would get cheap nVidia cards and put them in. They
will speed-up the rendering, so no Mesa, more CPU for the other stuff.

ParaView at this point does not support volume rendering. That said,
volume rendering is primarly cpu intensive and not graphics intensive.
(Except of-course if you use VolumePro or 3D texture mapper). In most
cases all you need to do is display a 2D image, which can be almost as
fast with no graphics card (if you do not do any zooming and panning).

If you do isosurface, then you need to consider two things:

1. Isosurface tends to be processor intensive and slow operation (if you
do not use patented algorithms).

2. It can produce lot's of polygons, which could be slow on software
rendering.

Hello,

Either I have not understood how to do this or I've found a bug. I want to
isolate a subset of blocks in a multi block, structured mesh to generate
glyphs representing the velocity vector only for these blocks.
This is what I did :

connectivity filter to find the blocks
treshold filter to isolate blocks
glyphs on the isolated blocks

the problem is that it seems that paraview generates glyps on all blocks
and not on the subset. Is this a bug or a feature ??

Jouke,

I tried something similar (ParaView 1.0) and it worked for me.  Are you 
sure that the input to your glyph filter is the threshold filter?

If you want to send me your data set (or save your paraview session and 
send me the pvs file), I will take a look at the issue.

I think I did something wrong during compilation. I recompiled and now it
