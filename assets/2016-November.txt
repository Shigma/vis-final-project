Assuming both the coordinates are stored in separate CSV files, there
what you can do:

1. Open both the files, one after another.
2. Select both in the Pipeline Browser, and then create "Python
Calculator" with the following expression: `inputs[1].Points -
inputs[0].Points`
3. Now apply the Glyph filter and set `Vectors` to result and change
Scale Factor to 1 and `Scale Mode` to `vector`.

Example state file attached.

If you want to draw a line from point positions at two subsequent time steps, you can use the Temporal Particles To Pathlines filter, which traces a line behind particles as they move through space and time. When you use this filter for your purposes, set Mask Points to 1 and Max Track Length to 2. (You can increase Max Track Length to lengthen the line to connect more than 2 timesteps.) Note that you will not see any lines until you step time.

The Temporal Particles to Pathlines filter actually has two outputs. The first, named Pathlines, contains the lines. The second, named Particles, is a point at the end position of the line. You can add a glyph to this output to create arrow-like filters.

Hello everyone,

I am working on visualizing some brain imaging data. I have a bunch of points in 3D space, which have two sets of coordinates: x1/y1/z1 and x2/y2/z2. All I need is to show arrow glyphs starting from the first coordinate and ending to the second coordinate. I currently import the data as csv. I tried using the time series option, and I can loop through the two time points, but can't find how to model a line or an arrow for each point between the two times. I also tried to compute what is called "velocity fields", that is a set of 3 scalar factors that if multiplied with the original coordinates would yield the second coordinate (using Calculator):
iHat*X snapped+jHat*Y snapped+kHat*Z snapped

Still, I don't get reasonable results. The problem looks trivial but I couldn't find any solution online after hours of search. It is not even clear to me what does the above formula do exactly.

Can someone help if this is possible?

Thank you both for the suggestions. I managed to have the arrows via python
calculator, but couldn't make the Temporal Particles to Pathlines filter
produce arrows.

Can I bug you with another question?

I want to apply a Slice filter to see the arrows that depart from that
slice. But the filter in Paraview just cuts through the objects in that
slice, it doesn't show the whole arrows. It also does not have any
tolerance (i.e., to pick points 2mm before and after the slice). Is there
another way to get a slice with full arrows, and have some tolerance to
pick up more points before and after the slice?

Thank you Samuel,

The "Clip-> Box" filter is definitely better, but it still cuts out
portions of arrows. I am ataching a picture for illustration.

[image: Inline image 1]

These issues seem to arise because the arrows are not seen as unitary
objects, but as a tube and a pointer. Using cones instead of arrows is not
useful, the cones do not respect the start and end points same as arrows.

Hi Dorian,

Try applying the clip to the original data before you apply the glyphs.
That should do what you want.  The data will be clipped and then the glyphs
will be applied later and not restricted by the bounds of the clip.

HTH,
Shawn

Alan,

Not possible with the Calculator as far as I know.

With the Python Calculator, you can indeed *use* a global variable
defined in the field data of the data set with the expression:

inputs[0].FieldData['TMSTEP'][time_index]

Here, time_index is the timestep index, not the time value. The Python
Calculator does not let you store the result in a new global variable.

The Programmable Filter is the most flexible filter that lets you read
the global data and store a new result. At the moment, however, I
cannot recall how to obtain the current timestep in the programmable
filter.

Maybe someone else can chime in, or I'll get back to you on how to do
this with the Programmable Filter. It is definitely more involved than
the using the Python Calculator.

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

We're planning on dropping 32bit binaries (currently only provided on

Any objections?

Subject: [Paraview] GNOME is hanging with co-processing ...
Message-ID: <64db4af1-48dd-940c-1d41-cf0d4ff40152@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am trying to run a parallel code with co-processing support but when i 
run the code, it is hanging without opening x-window and writing the png 
files. In this case, i could not use or interact with any other app with 
GUI such as firefox, terminal etc. It seems that it affects the GNOME. 
On the other hand, if i connect to machine remotely via ssh and kill the 
MPI process than the machine back to the normal and i could interact 
with terminal and other apps with GUI nornally. The system has Centos 
(7.1) operating system along with ParaView 5.2.0RC3 (BTW, i compiled 
ParaView from source). In this case, i am just running the code with 
standard mpirun command as follows,

mpirun -np 16 ./main.x

to find the source of the problem, i included strace command to the 
mpirun like following

mpirun -np 16 strace ./main.x

and it runs without any problem and produces desired output. So, at this 
point i am little bit confused and i just wonder that is there anybody 
else had similar issue before. Strace somehow solves the problem but i 
don't know how. It seems that it is related with the system because same 
code runs without any problem under MacOS. I also compiled code with 
ParaView 5.1 and it also hangs. The standard allinputsgridwriter.py is 
working without any problem and writes the data to disk. So, somehow it 
is related with the system (probably GNOME) or the ParaView installation.

Another question is that is there any way to prevent opening x-window 
and still getting advantage of having GPU in this case? The code only 
writes the result in png format. So, i need installation for headless 
server (without any screen attached) but i am not sure. I think that it 
requires special configuration options for the ParaView installation. 
So, please let me know also about those special options.

Regards,

--ufuk

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting different lines plot on one plot.
Message-ID: <CAAcjakkzQ7exu42phqGm_RvY+trxXKF5UPwGhukkK_+8Th+z_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All;
I know the questions sounds weird or misleading. But, the first step of any
CFD simulation is a grid sensitivity analysis. Thus, I am doing Velocity vs
height plots with three different meshes. Having each plot isolated does
not help much, unless I can plot the three different solutions on the same
plot.
Is there any way to do that. I have loaded the three different data sets
and I have three line plots but how can I plot one graph (line plot) on top
the other one ?

Thanks
Julio

Subject: [Paraview] Startup Bug
Message-ID: <CA+yet-5KnuW7tj-UveZa8xWi47_9N9k0Rf5h_Ea+01R4ue62ag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have recently started to use pvtu files in Paraview and for some reason
they seem to be causing program startup issues for me. I startup Paraview,
load my pvtu files, and can apply filters as desired. Everything seems to
work fine until I close Paraview and try to launch a new session. After
this, Paraview will not launch and crashes on startup every time. Applying
or not applying filters does not seem to matter, nor does saving or not
saving the session. Simply loading a pvtu file and then closing the program
does not allow me to open Paraview again. This persists even after a full
system restart.

The only way I can get Paraview to start again is to do a fresh install. I
have had this happen with several fresh installs of 5.1.2 and 5.2.0 so far.
I should note that I have not had any problems with non-partitioned vtu
files before. I made the switch to using pvtu files after discovering I
could perform Elmer simulations on multiple cores, speeding things up quite
a bit. I am on Windows 10 64bit.

I plan to try older versions of Paraview to see if I get the same result.
Wondering if anybody has experienced this before or might be able to help
me troubleshoot?

Thanks,
Clayton

That's very odd. Can you remove the config file mentioned here
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files) and then try?

You indeed can. Just turn on the visibility of multiple "Plot Over
Line" filters in the same view by making the view active and then
clicking on the eyeballs for the filters in the Pipeline Browser.

Hi Ufuk,

I haven't heard of any issues like this. Do you get similar behavior on the
machine when running ParaView with a separate, connected pvserver?

If you have an NVIDIA card you may be able to use their EGL libs for
offscreen rendering (i.e. no x-windows needed). See the blog post at
https://blog.kitware.com/off-screen-rendering-through-the-native-platform-interface-egl/.


Best,
Andy

Hi Chris and Andy,

It is good to know that i am not alone. It is very strange issue. Are you
also using GNOME in OpenSuse? It might narrow down the issue. As i told
before, if i use strace, the problem is dissapeared. It might help to find
the source of the problem but it requires deep knowledge about OS and also
GNOME. For temporary solution, i'll try to setup offscreen rendering using
Nvidia EGL libraries.

Thanks,
Regards,

Hi Ufuk,

I have experienced a similar issue when trying to instrument a code with Catalyst. I was running OpenSuse 13.2.  I start the parallel from a terminal window, and the entire GUI just locks up completely. Sometimes it seems to be permanently stuck and I have to do that you did i.e. ssh from another computer and kill the process. It?s quite frustrating, and it is the reason that I started looking into running with osMesa as a way to completely stop the calls to Catalyst from opening up an x-window.

I can?t really offer any solutions because I still haven?t figured out what is going on, but I can tell you that you are not the only one having that issue.

Best regards,
Chris Neal

Thanks Utkarsh,

Deleting the config file allows Paraview to launch again. The bug still
persists after opening my pvtu files, but at least I do not have to
reinstall the program and this works for my purposes (data manipulation and
extraction). Let me know if you need me to do any testing to get to the
root of the problem.

Cheers,
Clayton

Dear community 
I was wondering if it is possible to do contour plots with lines. Instead of having the contour flooded by color. I would like to have 2D contour plots only with lines like other packages do. 

Thanks you all!!

Hi Andy,

I am trying to install ParaView with EGL under Centos 7.1 but ParaView 
configuration could not find following libraries,

  EGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY EGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
  EGL_opengl_LIBRARY              EGL_opengl_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND

I checked the OS and Nvidia drivers and i confirmed that i don't have 
libGLdispatch library.

BTW, i am using Nvidia driver version 352.79. It is little bit old and 
now it is 367.57. Do you think that my driver is not capable to install 
the ParaView with EGL? If this is the case, i will try to upgrade the 
Nvidia library but i just want to be sure.

Thanks for your help,
Regards,

--ufuk

Subject: [Paraview] Volume Render Plot - Unreasonable results with vector
 components or magnitude
Message-ID: <9CFCBC636AF2B64FA55E32727F91D379430923A8@SVREXC01.intern.fitr.de>

Hello everyone,

I am using Paraview's Volume Render plot to visualize a velocity field inside some technical equipment. In case of plotting a component of the vector field or the magnitude of the vector (both from the drop-down menu) with volume render I get unreasonable results, e.g. minimum or maximum zones are not shown correctly or the flow direction seems wrong. However, if I calculate a scalar value from the vector that corresponds to the component or to the magnitude (e.g. using the calculator filter in Paraview) and then plot by volume render, the fluid field is represented correctly.

The data itself seems OK since a surface or slice plot leads to the same (correct) results, no matter  whether I use the vector component directly or the scalar value. I tested the behavior with several data sets. I am using Paraview 4.3.1 64-bit and Paraview 5.1.2 64-bit - both show the same behavior.

I appreciate any comment.

Best regards
Mathias Dietzel

Hello. I noticed the same behaviour in ParaView 4.3 on CentOS 6.7. Looks
like bug. Worked around with calculating the velocity magnitude as scalar.
There is also another bug or feature of volume rendering: I couldn't make
it render for all domains, it only renders one domain (for example, when I
load a CFD study results in EnSight Gold format).

Hi Julio,

Yes, you can do that. In 2D the grid can be colored by a solid color (or
pseudo-colored by a field variable). Then, use the Contour filter to create
the lines. Again, you can color the lines by a field variable or have them
a solid color. See the attached image and state file for PV 5.1.2 and how
to do that.

Let me know if this isn't what you're looking for. Also, if you have an
image of what you're looking to do then please include that as well.

Best,
Andy

Hi Mathias and Andrew,

Volume rendering by vector component should be fixed in the ParaView
5.2 release, due out in the next two weeks.

See https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1105

Thanks,
Cory

Julio,

Try using PV's Extract Surface Filter and then use the Contour filter. 
This works for me on 3D, unstructured meshes.

Hi,

To add to Cory's feedback -- installers and source code are available for
the 5.2 release candidate if you'd like to try it out and see if it's
fixed. If it's not fixed and you let us know ASAP, we may be able to get it
fixed in time for the 5.2 release. You can get the release candidate and
paraview.org/download -- just choose the 5.2 RC3.

Best,
Andy

Hi,

You'll probably want to use PV 5.1.2 or greater for this. Also, note that
the blog post says that the NVIDIA EGL driver minimum version needed is
355.11.

Currently, the volume rendering only supports rendering 1 block in the
multiblock dataset. We're working on a solution that can handle
multiple blocks seamlessly. In the meantime, you can use "Merge
Blocks" filter to merge all blocks into a single block, or use the
"Resample To Image" filter to resample the dataset to a single image
dataset and then volume rendering the result.

It's not exactly clear what you're looking for. Maybe if you can attach a
sample dataset, it may help. Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Possible regression ? Error when generating Coprocessing
	script
Message-ID: <1478185435.16393.4.camel@free.fr>

Hello,

When trying to generate a coprocessing script with ParaView 5.2.0-RC3-
14-gc56cebd (based on rather simple EnSight data), I have the following
error:


Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "<string>", line 1, in <module>

I had the same error with an earlier RC1 version, while I had never
encountered this issue before (upgrading my ParaView build from master
every few weeks, and using the Coprocessing generator plugin on and off
for the last 2 years or more).

Is it something with my build, or have others encountered this issue ?

All of PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON, PARAVIEW_ENABLE_CATALYST, and
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI are enabled in my builds.

Best regards,

  Yvan Fournier

Hi Yvan,

I just tried doing something similar with my build of the latest git
revision of PV and didn't have any problems with exporting.

Could you try running paraview with the "-dr" flag to disable your
registry? Maybe something in there is causing problems.

If that doesn't fix the issue, could you share a sample data set along with
all of the steps that you go through so that I can try and replicate it?

Thanks,
Andy

Hi,

first of all many thanks to the numerous and quick responses. Great work!

I did a quick test of the volume rendering in ParaView 5.2.0-RC3 64 bit (Windows 7). The issue is still the same, that is volume rendering by vector components does not seem to be fixed.

Additionally, I noticed one more issue occurring in PV 5.2-RC3: when changing from one component (e.g. x) to another one (e.g. y) in volume rendering, the title of the legend changes but nothing else. The legend keeps the same scaling parameters like min. and max. value (which may be intended) and the volume render plot is not re-rendered. One has to hit ?Rescale? in order to get an update of the volume render plot (which is confusing to me).

Alvaro mentioned that I ought to use the ?GPU mapper? but I was not able to find this option in the settings or properties. Actually I don?t know whether I am using the CPU or GPU or which mapper in particular. Where can I adjust that?

Let me know if I can give you any further support. Many thanks!

Best wishes
Mathias

Hi,
To add to Cory's feedback -- installers and source code are available for the 5.2 release candidate if you'd like to try it out and see if it's fixed. If it's not fixed and you let us know ASAP, we may be able to get it fixed in time for the 5.2 release. You can get the release candidate and paraview.org/download<http://paraview.org/download> -- just choose the 5.2 RC3.
Best,

Hello,

OK, rebuilding from a new build directory seems to have fixed the issue
(rerunning cmake and building did not; also, I used raw cmake instead
of "ccmake -i" just in case...

Sorry for the false alarm.

Hi,

I think the filter vtkRuledSurfaceFilter is what you are looking for. However, this filter is not in the Paraview?s Filter menu.

If I have a time series with positions (It's a set of csv files, one time step per file, each file has the same set of points), is there a method of computing the delta position from the current time to the next time and using that as a glyph vector?


Thanks,
Alan

Thank you Utkarsh and Jonathan for responding me.

In Fact, Jonathan i am clueless how to add that filter to paraview:(

Btw, i got something like this using Delauny3D filter. But there is an
error (i have marked a red circle where there is no coordinate as such).
Can you kindly tell me how to get rid of that point. That's the only issue
that bothers me now.

Hi Alvaro,

your last advise is actually the solution!! ? Volume rendering works fine for structured data.

I have been working with multi-block unstructured data (Ensight files exported form Ansys Fluent CFD) which leads to the discussed problems. By the way, that is why I could not find the ?Volume Rendering? section on the ?Properties? tab since this is shown for structured data only. For unstructured data the ?Volume Rendering? section will not appear although a volume render plot is displayed. Maybe a comment in the corresponding section of the PV manual would be helpful.

After converting my unstructured grid to structured data (?Resample to Image? as you suggested), volume render works fine (both for ?Smart? and ?GPU Based? rendering mode) and is MUCH faster (100^3 sampling). Anyway, resampling to structured data is time consuming, creates a ?bounding box? and leads to large grids if you want to capture small details. So I guess I keep the current limitations of volume render in mind and work with scalar fields instead which seems to work perfect with unstructured data.

Thanks to everyone! Great work!

Best wishes
Mathias

Hi Mathias,

thanks for your feedback.  I downloaded the ParaView-5.2-RC3 binaries and tried them out on Windows 7 and vector data seems to render correctly.  Something important that I missed to point out is that this is currently supported for structured data only, so this might be the issue.  To ensure that you are using the GPU mapper look for the 'Volume Rendering' section on the 'Properties' tab and select 'GPU Based' on  'Volume Rendering Mode'.

One thing you could try (in case your data is unstructured) is using the "Resample to Image" filter to convert your data to structured and then volume render that.

Let us know if that helps.
Alvaro

Hi,

first of all many thanks to the numerous and quick responses. Great work!

I did a quick test of the volume rendering in ParaView 5.2.0-RC3 64 bit (Windows 7). The issue is still the same, that is volume rendering by vector components does not seem to be fixed.

Additionally, I noticed one more issue occurring in PV 5.2-RC3: when changing from one component (e.g. x) to another one (e.g. y) in volume rendering, the title of the legend changes but nothing else. The legend keeps the same scaling parameters like min. and max. value (which may be intended) and the volume render plot is not re-rendered. One has to hit ?Rescale? in order to get an update of the volume render plot (which is confusing to me).

Alvaro mentioned that I ought to use the ?GPU mapper? but I was not able to find this option in the settings or properties. Actually I don?t know whether I am using the CPU or GPU or which mapper in particular. Where can I adjust that?

Let me know if I can give you any further support. Many thanks!

Best wishes
Mathias

Hi,
To add to Cory's feedback -- installers and source code are available for the 5.2 release candidate if you'd like to try it out and see if it's fixed. If it's not fixed and you let us know ASAP, we may be able to get it fixed in time for the 5.2 release. You can get the release candidate and paraview.org/download<http://paraview.org/download> -- just choose the 5.2 RC3.

Hi Andy,

I updated driver and install PV successfully. As you point out, the 
recent driver solves the problem. By the way, i installed the 
co-processing code with PV with EGL support and now it runs without any 
problem and produces desired png files. The only minor problem is that 
the result png files do not have axis titles and axis labels. There 
could be a bug related with co-processing.

Thanks for your help and suggestions,
Regards,

--ufuk

That is odd. Perhaps there is point in your data that is not used in the initial geometry. Try running the Clean To Grid filter before the Delaunay filter.

Btw, i got something like this using Delauny3D filter. But there is an error (i have marked a red circle where there is no coordinate as such). Can you kindly tell me how to get rid of that point. That's the only issue that bothers me now.

Hi,

I think the filter vtkRuledSurfaceFilter is what you are looking for. However, this filter is not in the Paraview's Filter menu.

Alas, I am not aware of any filter in ParaView that will generate a surface from the line-source you have.

Hi,

I tested 5.2 RC3 and encountered an issue when reading OpenFOAM cases.

The problem only occurs when the OpenFOAM data (i.e. the mesh or fields)
are written in binary format. I setup two test cases that are otherwise
identical, where for the one the data is in ascii and the other one in
binary format.
With ParaView 5.1.2 I can read both cases without any error, but with
ParaView 5.2 RC3 the cases for which the data is in binary format leads
to an error (see below for the exact error message).

The case is taken directly from the official OpenFOAM 4.x tutorials, and
here is a link to the case files that can be directly used for debugging:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/l0cb8vd6pjkb1zz/debug_PV_OF.tar.gz?dl=0

All tests were done with the ParaView binaries distributed by Kitware.

Let me know if you need more information or if I can help debugging this
further.

Cheers,
Armin

Thanks for the bug report! I have a patch for this here:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/2147

This should be able to make it into the upcoming release.

Message-ID: <23842c59d80e4acb91d1659323e8bb27@msicalexch1.matrix-solutions.com>

Good day

I'm trying to use a Programmable Source to read data from a proprietary file format (DHI/MikeZero).

I have access to its SDK via Python, however, it uses managed code (natively written in C#), hence I got my environment set up to use the CLR module and add references to the MikeZero SDK:

import clr
clr.AddReference("DHI.Generic.MikeZero.DFS")
from DHI.Generic.MikeZero.DFS import *

This works well in "stand alone" python scripts.

I tried using the same approach in ParaView/Programmable Source, but it can't find the CLR module.

Is there a set-up step I'm missing in the ParaView Environment to get access to external modules such as CLR?

Thanks, Chris

You may need to set things like your PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the
programmable source itself instead of in the environment you're running
ParaView from. For example:
import sys
sys.path.append("/home/me/mypy")

Remember that the programmable source runs the script on the server.

Thanks ... Will look into that

Luckily, our models aren't large enough to run them distributed/on clients, hence I don't think I'll have to worry about that too much, but will keep that in mind as well ..

Subject: [Paraview] Curvilinear Elements?
Message-ID: <cf6668ca-b651-e560-f9b7-6ca5e8025976@lspr.swiss>

Dear Paraview,

I do calculations on curvilinear tetrahedral meshes and at some point have written a curvilinear VTK/VTU/PVTU writer for my code. It does virtual refinement of curvilinear elements, and thus writes curvilinear elements as a set of smaller linear elements.

I was wondering if it was possible to upgrade my output to use native Paraview curvilinear support.

1) Does Paraview support curvilinear elements in VTK/VTU formats? How high can the curvilinear order go? Is there documentation for the curvilinear format

2) If not VTK/VTU, perhaps there is another format?


Best regards,

Aleksejs Fomins

Subject: [Paraview] Vectorized data assignment
Message-ID: <67f0377a7fb946bf82e703b1688150df@msicalexch1.matrix-solutions.com>

Good day.

I found this example code<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Python/GeometricObjects/Display/Cell3DDemonstration>:

    # Create the points
    points = vtk.vtkPoints()
    points.InsertNextPoint(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    points.InsertNextPoint(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    points.InsertNextPoint(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    points.InsertNextPoint(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    ... ... ...

which had me wonder if there is a way to assign data in a vectorized fashion instead of point by point?

Let's say I can read in 3 1D arrays (vectors) with X, Y, Z data or one 2D array (matrix, dataframe) with the same data in columns, is there a way to assign that data to the points all at once instead of iteratively?

    points = vtk.vtkPoints()
    points.InsertNextPoint(X, Y, Z)    - just saying; this is obviously not correct!

Obviously, any data could be combined and reshaped first to whatever format required ....

Given that ParaView/VTK was designed to work with (very) large data sets I'd be surprised if there were no vectorized operations implemented.

Thanks, Chris

In C++, there are a number of ways to do this by modifying the data array
directly (instead of going through the vtkPoints interface). You can
extract the data array from the points by calling points.GetData(). You can
also create a points array separately and assign it to the vtkPoints
instance by calling points.SetData(myArray).

There are two types of arrays in VTK, AoS (Array-of-Structs, the default
used for e.g. vtkFloatArray, etc), and SoA (Struct-of-Arrays, still
somewhat experimental at this point):

These doxygen pages describe the specific APIs for them:

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkAOSDataArrayTemplate.html
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkSOADataArrayTemplate.html

There are several ways to do low-level copying of data using methods like
AoS::SetArray, SoA::SetComponentArray, AoS::GetPointer,
SoA::GetComponentArrayPointer, etc, which will allow you to set the array's
memory buffer explicitly, or just get low-level access to it for for
modifications.

However, I'm not sure how much of this is exposed in the python/numpy
layers, so it might take some experimentation. Hopefully someone more
familiar with the python bindings will chime in.

HTH,
Dave

Thanks Dave.

That?s good to know. My background is actually in C++ programming, but the SDK I?m trying to link in is natively in C# and wrapped with Python. I could try mix-code programming (C++/C#), but trying to avoid that for now and use Python instead ?.

Good day.

I found this example code<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Python/GeometricObjects/Display/Cell3DDemonstration>:

    # Create the points
    points = vtk.vtkPoints()
    points.InsertNextPoint(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    points.InsertNextPoint(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    points.InsertNextPoint(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    points.InsertNextPoint(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    ? ? ?

which had me wonder if there is a way to assign data in a vectorized fashion instead of point by point?

Let?s say I can read in 3 1D arrays (vectors) with X, Y, Z data or one 2D array (matrix, dataframe) with the same data in columns, is there a way to assign that data to the points all at once instead of iteratively?

    points = vtk.vtkPoints()
    points.InsertNextPoint(X, Y, Z)    - just saying; this is obviously not correct!

Obviously, any data could be combined and reshaped first to whatever format required ?.

Given that ParaView/VTK was designed to work with (very) large data sets I?d be surprised if there were no vectorized operations implemented.

In C++, there are a number of ways to do this by modifying the data array directly (instead of going through the vtkPoints interface). You can extract the data array from the points by calling points.GetData(). You can also create a points array separately and assign it to the vtkPoints instance by calling points.SetData(myArray).

There are two types of arrays in VTK, AoS (Array-of-Structs, the default used for e.g. vtkFloatArray, etc), and SoA (Struct-of-Arrays, still somewhat experimental at this point):

These doxygen pages describe the specific APIs for them:

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkAOSDataArrayTemplate.html
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkSOADataArrayTemplate.html

There are several ways to do low-level copying of data using methods like AoS::SetArray, SoA::SetComponentArray, AoS::GetPointer, SoA::GetComponentArrayPointer, etc, which will allow you to set the array's memory buffer explicitly, or just get low-level access to it for for modifications.

However, I'm not sure how much of this is exposed in the python/numpy layers, so it might take some experimentation. Hopefully someone more familiar with the python bindings will chime in.

HTH,
Dave

I know that our python bindings have some level of compatibility with numpy
arrays, so it may be possible to pack your data into a numpy array and just
use the SetArray / SetComponentArray methods directly with them. Not 100%
sure though...

If you're using the ParaView client binary downloaded from paraview.org,
it's using it's own internal python, not the one set up on your system
already (which can use the clr module).  As Andy already mentioned, setting
PYTHONPATH to the directory containing the clr module should let ParaView's
python find the module, but this is why it's probably happening in the
first place.

Subject: [Paraview] parellel processing problem
Message-ID: <8215d6b6822d91dac07cedc3b6a81f46@rpi.edu>

Hello,

I am brand new to Paraview and I an having a serious parallel processing 
problem when using a pvserver client/server connection, Paraview 4.4.0, 
and mvapitch2-2.0a-gcc44. The server and the client run linux.

Attached is my .pvd file and a photo of what the model should look like 
(ie. when I am using 1 processor) and what the model looks like when I 
am using more than one processor.

When I ran this FEM simulation I used 16 processors. So, for each time 
step folder (for ex. DRPTransientN_13, which is for the 13th time step) 
there is a folder inside named '0' that contains 16 .vtu files.

Also, when using multiple processors in Paraview I can 'scrub' through 
time with this one chunk of the model.


It seems like Paraview isnt reading the .pvd file correctly, or 
something....


Do you have any idea what the issue is? Any fixes that I can implement?


I would be most grateful for any help you can provide.

Thanks for your response Utkarsh.

Please see the sample data set.

Can you kindly tell me how to get a nice 3D model from this? I need to
obtain the surface of the slices.

Thanks in advance.

Alan,

One can use the Force Time filter to do this.

Load the csv files twice, and apply a Force Time filter to both. In
one Force Time filter, set the first time step (real time, not time
index) in the Forced Time property, and in the second set the Forced
Time to the next time step. Then select both Force Time filters in the
Pipeline Browser and add a Python Calculator. The expression you want
is

inputs[0].Points - inputs[1].Points

By default, the difference will be saved to a Point Data array with
the name in the "Array Name" property of the Python Calculator.

You might need to swap the 0 and 1 indices above based on how ParaView
orders the inputs into the Python Calculator. Unfortunately, that's
not well-defined right now.

Attached is a state file with an example using the can.ex2 file.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Kenneth, you made my day. Clean to Grid filter worked like a charm. omg,
thank you so much.
I have attached the input and outputs, below.
Let me ask you one last question. How to get those circles back in the 3D
model? (it shd look like a tube)



INPUT as below:
[image: Inline image 2]



OUTPUT_1 as below (Delaunay3D Filter): (if i get those circles back in the
below model, that will be awesome)
[image: Inline image 3]

But in OUTPUT2_Delaunay2D (has those circles)
[image: Inline image 4]

I?m not entirely sure what you expect to see. It?s hard to tell from the static images, but it looks like those circles are located inside of the shape, so maybe you just cannot see them.

Although Delaunay3D won?t actively find the circles and preserve them, but based on the nature of the algorithm I would expect that the circles? connections would become edges in the final mesh. If you are trying to see the circles in the mesh, you might try the surface with edges representation. You may also need to clip or slice through your mesh to see the circles if they are in the middle.

Thanks for your response Utkarsh.

Please see the sample data set.

Can you kindly tell me how to get a nice 3D model from this? I need to obtain the surface of the slices.

Thanks in advance.

Thank you very much, Ken,
 i would like to see all the circles(which is inside the image)but  they
are aligned on top of another where they looks like a small tube. Any idea
how to get that?

Sorry, but I don?t think I understand what you are trying to or expecting to see. Do you just want to draw the circles so that you can see them inside of the shape?

Although Delaunay3D won?t actively find the circles and preserve them, but based on the nature of the algorithm I would expect that the circles? connections would become edges in the final mesh. If you are trying to see the circles in the mesh, you might try the surface with edges representation. You may also need to clip or slice through your mesh to see the circles if they are in the middle.

Hi Kenneth, you made my day. Clean to Grid filter worked like a charm. omg, thank you so much.
I have attached the input and outputs, below.
Let me ask you one last question. How to get those circles back in the 3D model? (it shd look like a tube)



INPUT as below:
[line image 2]



OUTPUT_1 as below (Delaunay3D Filter): (if i get those circles back in the below model, that will be awesome)
[line image 3]

But in OUTPUT2_Delaunay2D (has those circles)
[line image 4]

Hi,
Kenneth, here's what i got (couldn't get the tube though within the shape
itself)

1st image(with surface, using 3D Delaunay filter)
[image: Inline image 1]


2nd image(points, using 3D Delaunay filter))
[image: Inline image 2]


Kenneth is it possible to get a nice tube inside , still having the surface
on (Clipping thing didn't work for me :-(...)

Thank you so much in advance.

I?m not sure what else to suggest. It looks like a tube is there, but you cannot see it because it is imbedded within the volume. ParaView does not have a way to distinguish the tube part from the rest of the volume. Short of extracting the circles by hand or providing a custom operation to automatically find, register, and connect the circles into tubes, I don?t know how else you would do it.

Hi,
Kenneth, here's what i got (couldn't get the tube though within the shape itself)

1st image(with surface, using 3D Delaunay filter)
[Inline image 1]


2nd image(points, using 3D Delaunay filter))
[Inline image 2]


Kenneth is it possible to get a nice tube inside , still having the surface on (Clipping thing didn't work for me :-(...)

Thank you so much in advance.

Like I said earlier, there is no guarantee that Delaunay will construct the tube you are expecting, but I would expect it at least give you something close. However, even if it does, it will be hard to see because it will be embedded in the larger volume. Once you build the mesh it is treated like a solid block.

You might try extracting the circles with a box clip before running Delaunay. If you could do that, it should create a tube-like structure.

You can make the surface transparent by changing the opacity parameter in the properties panel.

That's exactly right.As these circles in the real world should look like a tube inside the shape. Since i have 3 circles, i am expecting 3 tubes inside this shape.

I?m not entirely sure what you expect to see. It?s hard to tell from the static images, but it looks like those circles are located inside of the shape, so maybe you just cannot see them.

Although Delaunay3D won?t actively find the circles and preserve them, but based on the nature of the algorithm I would expect that the circles? connections would become edges in the final mesh. If you are trying to see the circles in the mesh, you might try the surface with edges representation. You may also need to clip or slice through your mesh to see the circles if they are in the middle.

Hi Brennen,

ParaView has support for loading multiple files as a time series if you
name them file1.vtk, file2.vtk, etc.  We realize that sometimes these
multiple files are multiple blocks of output rather than multiple timesteps
so I recently implemented a filter that converts the time series into a
multiblock dataset by putting each time step into a block in the dataset.
You can use this with the existing reader to convert the time series that
ParaView thinks your data is into a multiblock dataset with all of the data
in it.  The new filter is called 'Group Time Steps' and is available in
master or the 5.2 release candidates.

HTH,
Shawn

If you look in the Properties panel in the Display section under the heading ?X Axis Parameters,? there is a combo box named ?X Array Name.? Change the value of that box from arc_length to Points_Y.

Hi,

I would like to create a plot of the electric field vs y_coordinate. I created a .sif file (attached) which computes the electric field using the ElmerFEM software and I exported all the results into a .vtu file (attached).
All I have done is to use the filter PlotOverLine but what I get as a plot is the electric field vs the arc_length.

Mike,


Your state file doesn't work without the data files that go along with it.


That said, here is how you can do it:


1. Load your .dat file and use the TableToPoints filter to create points from the data table -- select your x, y, z appropriately

2. Load your CFD data file

3. Select your CFD data file and then do:

    a. ResampleWithDataset -- select the CFD data as the Input and the TableToPoints as the Source

4. This will give you the data interpolated to the points in the table, if you want a plane from this data, apply the Delaunay2D filter and select Best-Fitting Plane (if the points are not X-Y points only).


That should give you the data from your CFD simulation on the same plane as your PIV data.


I see you are at GT -- let me know if you are still unclear on these steps and would like to talk in person.


Tim

I have three planes of experimental PIV data with velocity point data in .dat format loaded in Paraview. I am hoping to use these planes to interpolate/extrapolate velocity values onto a custom volumetric mesh (i.e. from a CFD simulation) to compare experimental results with simulation results in hopes of validating the simulation. I have attached my Paraview state file. Any help will be much appreciated.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Volume Rendering "Brightness"
Message-ID: <78cbf20dc3ab44dd89da1f2d58fc84cb@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

It looks like this is an old message that has been stuck waiting for a moderator to release it, but in case you are still interested in the answer here goes.

There used to be a parameter in the color map named Scalar Opacity Unit Distance (or something like that) that could be used to uniformly control how opaque the opacity parameter is interpreted. However, it looks like that option was removed from the GUI quite a while ago (probably because no one understood it). The effect would be a perceived change in the brightness of the volume.

You can still get around it through the Python interface though. I used that to create the following pair of macros. To load them in ParaView, go to the Macros -> Add New Macro menu item and load in each file. You can then increase and decrease the brightness of a volume rendering by hitting the two macro buttons.

Sorry for the delay.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Volume Rendering "Brightness"

Hello all,
This may be a silly question, but is there a way to increase the brightness of a volume rendering?  For instance, in the image below, the render on the right is brighter than the render on the left:

[Inline image 1]
The difference is that the image on the right is just two volume representations of the same object.  Is there a smarter way to increase the brightness?
Thanks,

Hi L?cio,

This should be fixed in the soon-to-be-released ParaView 5.2.0
release. You can try ParaView 5.2.0 Release Candidate 3, available at
http://www.paraview.org/download/ , to confirm.

HTH,

In the meantime, try saving in tiff format instead of png.
I ran into the same thing and found that tiff was more stable.

I am pretty sure it's nothing to do with the file format. The bug was
in the code that handle overlapping between viewports when rendering
large resolutions. ParaView 5.2. should fix the issue for OpenGL2
backend.

Subject: [Paraview] How to apply different color maps to different datasets.
Message-ID: <5820E341.2070204@bluequartz.net>

I would like to load up 2 different files and then display one using a 
gray scale color map and the other a simple RGB color map and some 
transparency so that I can "overlay" one image onto the other. It would 
seem that when I apply a color map to one data set it applies to all the 
data sets. How can I change this behavior?

Thanks

Mike,

You can think of color maps in ParaView as being stored in a map from
data array name to color map. If you care coloring two data sets by
arrays of the same name, then the same color map will be used for
each.

A workaround is to rename a data array using the Calculator filter.
Set the expression to the name of the array you want to view, then set
the "Result Array Name" to something else. Choose the new name to
color by, and you will be able to color the data sets differently.

HTH,
Cory

Hello. Possibly Threshold filter will help you. To limit points by 3
coordinates try to define 3 Threshold filters in series.

Daniel,

I just tried loading the file you attached in the latest development
version of ParaView, and it loaded just fine.

One thing you could try would be to delete your ParaView configuration
files. We're not sure why yet, but this sometimes mysteriously solves
problems. The configuration files on linux are located under
$HOME/.config/ParaView. Try moving the .ini and .json files there to
another location - if removing them solves the problem, I'd like to
see those configuration files to help figure out what the problem is.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Regarding filtering of point data array

Vaibhav,

It's a little involved, but you can filter with the Threshold filter
as Andrew recommends. Attached is a state file showing the pipeline.

First, we apply a Mask filter. We do not want to mask any points, so
we set the On Ratio to 1 and set the Maximum Number of Points to some
high number. The important part here is that we need to generate cells
that the Threshold filter can operate on. Hence we turn on the
Generate Vertices and Single Vertex Per Cell option.

Next, you create a Calculator filter to extract the X coordinate, then
filter the result with a Threshold filter applied to the X coordinate
array. The same is done for Y and Z.

You probably found that the Clip filter does this very quickly with a
box Clip Type setting, but for your application the Box parameters are
not very intuitive.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] webserver write up
Message-ID: <CAHhX17d2n28XV3MpA-eHS9JrK+zfWeRqnvVwCktF5B6DVrTEJw@mail.gmail.com>

Could someone explain to me how to correctly set up a local paraview webserver??

I've tried to follow the write-ups here;
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/quick_start

But they seem inaccuracte/out of date. I have tried both the
quickstart and Ububtu LTS writeups.

I have an apache 2 server running.

Ive tried installing PV from both the direct download page (source and
binaries) as well as a github clone.


In regards to the quickstart it also seems like the given paths have
changed? (can someone verify??)

in the weite up
/bin/pvpython lib/paraview-4.1/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py
 \
            --content ./share/paraview-4.1/www
            \
            --data-dir /path-to-share/
            \
            --port 8080 &

to:
./bin/pvpython share/paraview-5.2/web/visualizer/server/pvw-visualizer.py \
 --content share/paraview-5.2/web/visualizer/www  \
--data-dir  /path-to-share
--port 8080

I can get a visualizer window up and running, but there are no control
buttons to load buttons just a frozen screen of the paraview grey
background and axis (which I can not rotate).

If I need to compile from source are there any specific flags I need
to set in ccmake beside paraview python?


Thanks!

The ParaViewWeb documentation has moved to
https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/.

We are still in the process of deprecating the previous documentation
location.

Ashton,

You should be able to download ParaView 5.2 RC3 or better RC4 (small fixes
went in)

Then you should be able to run one of the following command line to try it
out.

[image: Inline image 2]

Otherwise building ParaView yourself will only require to turn Python ON.

Then you can get visualizer here: https://kitware.github.io/visualizer/

Hope that help,

Seb

Sebastien,

I followed the Ubuntu guide I found through the link you sent me at;
https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/ubuntu_14_04.html#Installation-of-ParaViewWeb

although between this morning and now, it seems to have gone 404.

is that not a valid write up?

I keep getting a
"ERROR: Launch request is missing application key."

when I try and load;
localhost/visualizer
or
localhost/lightviz

To fix the "Next/Previous" link issue, I had to move some files arounds. If
you remove /guides/ you should be good.

Let me know if I missed a link to go to that page.

It should be a valid write up, but I may have failed to update visualizer
and light-viz inside ParaView bundle.
Which version of ParaView are you using?

If you don't mind try to replace index.html inside
/data/www/{visualizer/lightviz}/index.html by the one you can download here:

https://github.com/Kitware/visualizer/blob/master/dist/index.html
https://github.com/Kitware/light-viz/blob/master/dist/index.html

Version;
ParaView-5.2.0-RC3-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit

changing the index fixed the application key issue so I can bring up;
mymachine/visualizer

(a blank grey static paraview box with no controls)

but not sure how I acutally get the paraview gui. from the old write up
mymachine/paraview would bring it up but this fails with a;
{"error": "id not provided in GET request"}


once I get this working, let me know if you want a modified version of the
writeup


relevant configs, sorry for the extended path locations...

Dennis,

You are absolutely right. I wasn't familiar enough with the syntax for
selection on point coordinates to be confident in suggesting that, but
I looked and it turns out to be

(xmin < points[:,0]) & (points[:,0] < xmax) & (ymin < points[:,1]) &
(points[:,1] < ymax) & (zmin < points[:,2]) & (points[:,2] < zmax)

where xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, and zmax are the bounds of the box.

Enter the above expression in the Find Data dialog with appropriate
substitutions for xmin, etc. into expression at the top, and change
the leftmost combobox from ID to Query and the middle combo box to
"is". Change the "Find" combobox to Points and choose your data source
in the combobox on the right. It should look like the attached image.

After you have it set up, you can extract the selection by clicking
the Extract Selection button.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Cindy,

I'm not sure if background images are supported on tiled screens.
Maybe someone with more experience with tiled displays can chime in.

Hi Akhilesh,

Could you post a bit more of your error message? There isn't enough to
see what might be going wrong.

Cindy,

Cory is right, background texture is not supported in CAVE (or
immersive) mode. It is supported for flat tiled displays however (the
case where all your screens are in the same plane.

Hello,

Unfortunately there is no Nastran reader provided with ParaView.
However, such a reader could be developed quite easily and integrated to
ParaView using a plugin or a Python script.
Of course, that would require C++ or Python and VTK knowledges. Hopefuly,
there are plenty of examples and wiki pages that can be used to help you in
this task.

Through a support contract, Kitware can also assist you or do the
development for you.

Best,

Hello,

Recent versions of ParaViewData (5.0.0 and above) have their file names as
md5 sums.
While version 4.4.0 of ParaViewData and earlier used human readable names.
Is there still a version of ParaViewData (5.0.0 and above) that has human
readable names?

Thank,

Joe

Joe,

If you do a build of ParaView with testing enabled, you'll have files with
human readable names in the build directory under "ExternalData/".

Subject: [Paraview] geotiff aerial imagery
Message-ID: <CAHhX17cJhzuYzqFxp7NS5Me2HS4Jztyb3Qe5Gu8KGiBMxMvoPw@mail.gmail.com>

How do I properly display an RGB image from a 3 band (or 4 if alpha)
geotiff? I know Ive done this before, but forgot how. In older
versions you had to turn off color mapping and explicitly set RGB
scalars, but those options went away after PVv4 if I remember.

They are still there but hidden by default as considered as advanced.
So you can either turn the advance button ON or simply write in the search
box: "map scalars"

Subject: [Paraview] csv point data through time
Message-ID: <CAHhX17e2UV3CG_s3VhHGqO0BeXj0ocT3nGTj9cMB+jTS6k8h7Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have a database of earthquakes in a csv file formatted as;

x,y,z,M,time
344914.339004,4153503.07632,-7703,1.22,441772084.24
337090.052527,4158668.87752,-10404,1.06,441774936.69
335085.941364,4156934.63971,-7245,0.72,441789441.37
337111.336138,4167120.16812,-8539,0.76,441790442.57
335024.848735,4159463.38774,-4032,0.71,441801083.1
338135.588075,4159856.10709,-4160,1.17,441821076.16

where time is in unix seconds.

Normally I plot this by table_to_points, as spherical glpyhs, colored
by time and sized by "M" (magnitude), see image;
http://tinyurl.com/neaxe7n


But it would be nice to step through these points with time. I just
cant figure out how to actually get paraview to recognize my time
column in my table (or my point attribute).

Normally I would either reformat this to a netcdf or create individual
file at each time step, but for this case these are not suitable
options.

Any suggestions?

You can use the Process Id Scalars to examine the data distribution and
maybe see if something funky is going on there. In parallel there's also a
helper array which you can pseudo-color by to see the partitioning but I
don't remember the name of that array.

You could also try doing something like a Wavelet source in parallel and
pseudo-color that by process id to see if the partitioning is working
properly for that..

Andrea,

I'm sure someone else will have a more elegant solution, but for a quick workaround I would threshold on time then animate the min and max and you could play the animation to see these over time - going to an individual frame would show you a specific time period

Hope this helps

Message-ID: <CANijUiqf69Pn5omc_aqQMRcSC4i1OJFP8q26xMBMuvFVksQoqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
first of all thanks for the work done for this software !

I face a problem with a CGNS file. All the block are not shown and cannot
be selected.
https://imagebin.ca/v/31V0hxFE1vcO
Here you can see that in CGNSplot you have element Sections are <Boundary
Conditions>. But paraview just show two depth.

The mesh and the variables are well imported.

Do I understand the soft correctely ? How can I correct this ?

Regards,
Thomas PEDOT

Thomas,

Can you share a sample dataset? I am guessing there's a difference between
what CGNSplot calls a block and what ParaView considers a block.

You put together a "Programmable Source" to do that. Attached is  a Plugin
with such a Programmable source/reader. Load it using "Tools | Plugins".
Then when you open the csv file, you'll be promped to choose a reader,
choose the ""CSV Reader With Time Column".

Thanks Utkarsh! Out of curiosity, should the plugin work out of the
box or is it meant to be an example I should deconstruct. (I load a
x,y,z,time file as you described but get no output)

Anyone out there actively using Paraview for earth science, and has
recommendations on useful plugins? Is there anytype of gdal plugin?
Coordinate transformation? Did anyone every pick up the torch from the
previous paraviewgeo plugin library?

Dear Andrea,

We are using ParaView for earth science indirectly (helping others). Which

have GDAL plugin for ParaView (require <2.0 of gdal though) and will

Subject: [Paraview] Color by Source JPEG
Message-ID: <CAKT148tEjrh9nxCEQbaWpKnA0_b4Mz2t3SQhS_koYB8SQ=rqvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to view a series of exported JPEG CFD results in Paraview. The
problem I'm having is Paraview automatically colors them to a particular
colormap. Is there a way to simply render them with the jpeg colours? The
available color options refer to a 'Magnitude', X, Y and Z options which
are automatically generated and none of which are the source colours. I
have attached one of my source images and what it looks like in Paraview.

Thanks,
Jeremy

I typically use it for plotting 3D volumes from geophysical inversions
(seismic/gravity,etc), underneath digital elevation models. Sometimes
I bring in aerial imagery, earthquake locations etc.

Things that I would find helpful would be a plugin to handle
coordinate transformations. (hence my interest in a gdal plugin) Now I
just make sure everything is in the same UTM beforehand, but its not
ideal.

I am also very interested in being able to bring in shape files so I
can overlay geologically mapped units.

Also just kind of curious of what's out there. There are some things
that I dont have an immediate need for, but would find interesting
(plotting earthquake focal mechanisms, etc).

Hey Jeremy,

In the search box next to the gear icon search for "map scalars", its
hidden by default (or just turn the advanced button, the gear icon,
ON). Once you find it, turn "map scalars" off.

Actually, it looks like Visit can read NASTRAN files.
It means theorically it should be possible to quite easily read them
through ParaView's VisitBridge component.

This all sounds very exciting. What format do you use for seismic dataset?

That would be actually using the PROJ4. I will see if we can push a plugin
that can expose the projection capabilities.  How soon do you need this?

Right, the GDAL plugin will enable loading of shapefiles (and other
formats). Let me find the status of our code and I can follow up with you
on it sometime very soon.

Hi,

So is there any options in Paraview to vary different surfaces. Suppose
this model(below image)  is one of a human organ. How could you change the
surfaces to make it look like a real model? Is it possible in Paraview?

Hello,

Did you tried the "advanced settings" (little wheel) when loading your 
cgns file ?
By the way,  "Zone_t" of cgns files are loaded as ParaView "blocks" 
since the 3D volume mesh and solution(s) are defined at this level. 
Sections are used to define parts of the mesh but we don't really have 
any equivalent structure in ParaView.

Regards

Mickael

Hi Chathuri,

ParaView does not have any modeling tools that you would need to transform
the surface in your example image to another shape. It supports basic
transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation.

Best regards,
Cory

The seismic datasets are coming from my own inversion/tomography code,
and I usually just format them into a Paraview readable netcdf format.

In terms of projection capabilties, I'd be using it as soon as you
push it. But, like I mentioned, I have reasoanble workarounds
(projecting everything pre import).

A gdal plugin that could load shape files would be really useful!

Can you send me a shapefile that I can confirm works?  (I have plenty but
just wanted to make sure I test with yours).

Thanks,

This would be an example of the type of shapefiles;

Thomas,

You should definitely be able to do this, and what you are seeing
looks like a bug. I suggest trying a more recent ParaView, such as
5.1.2, to see if the bug persists.

Best regards,
Cory

Do you mean applying a texture rather than coloring by a scalar value on
the surface?

I am plotting data over a line within a solid model.  The plot appears correctly.

How can I copy the data plotted to place in an external spreadsheet?  Can't seem to find this.

With the plot over line filter selected in the pipeline browser go to
file->save data, and select save as comma separated values CSV file.

Message-ID: <22CAF6244B430349A0C545A43E351A593DD0FE00@MERCURY.emc-sq.com>

I found out how from another thread.  Here is the way.

On the pipeline browser select the filter for plot over line, then you should be able to see a row of five buttons at the top left corner of where your graph plot, click on the rectangle symbol and pick the points on your plot. Once that is visible you should be able to go to file>export to export scene your data as a .csv file.

I am plotting data over a line within a solid model.  The plot appears correctly.

How can I copy the data plotted to place in an external spreadsheet?  Can't seem to find this.

Subject: [Paraview] Volume positioning
Message-ID: <94585a17-46f8-10c7-ea73-f0309a1e64fb@gmail.com>

Dear list,

I have been having problems with the positioning of volumes using 
Paraview. ITK tells me that, using,

     IteratorType  it2( img_input, img_input->GetLargestPossibleRegion() );

     it2.GoToBegin();
     ImageType::IndexType begin = it2.GetIndex();
     img_input->TransformIndexToPhysicalPoint(it2.GetIndex(),p0);
     it2.GoToEnd();
     --it2;
     img_input->TransformIndexToPhysicalPoint(it2.GetIndex(),p1);
     std::cout << p0 <<  p1 << std::endl;

  two volumes I have have the positions


[-102.536, -106.413, 30.1491][102.512, 106.414, 177.564]

and

[-102.536, -106.413, 30.1491][102.512, 106.414, -117.265]

When I load these into Paraview they occupy the same volume. In Slicer3D 
the volumes are distinct as I expect above.

Thanks

Hi,
I tried your solution I didn't notice this little wheel, and... It works as
expected. It's not exactly the same organization but it is good for my
needs !

Thanks for your concerns !
Have a nice day.

Good morning, Aashish



I've been following your email thread with Ashton with quite some interest, as I'm considering using ParaView in a similar way.



In my case, I'm looking into 3D visualisation of groundwater modelling results (from MikeShe). The subsurface (below a DEM) is represented on an unstructured grid:



[cid:image001.jpg at 01D230F1.D9A2EA70]



MikeShe has its own proprietary file format which I have access to via a Python SDK; my goal is to develop a "programmable source" that would read those files directly into ParaView for visualisation.



Then adding shape files (base mapping) on top of this would actually be really cool.



I'll keep following along .... Chris

Right, the GDAL plugin will enable loading of shapefiles (and other formats). Let me find the status of our code and I can follow up with you on it sometime very soon.

What file format are you using to load the volumes into ParaView? A
number of formats support volume positioning, so this should be
possible, unless you are loading a series of TIFF images, for example.

I have used MHA and NIFTII. I have converted the MHA into NIFTII using 
both c3d and ITK.

MHA and NIFTII definitely contain position information that ParaView
should read. Do you have any small-ish representative volumes you can
share (privately with me if needed).

Attached are two volumes that have an overlap in paraview but the ITK 
volume I find using the code below means there should be no overlap

Subject: [Paraview] Optional input ports
In-Reply-To: <CACqg2jfLuKscxfxFWJcdC6EAeS_8YGmft_A+TUWM7cNLRSaCBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Parview users,

This question seems trivial - but I do not find any solution on my own!

I have a filter with one mandatory and two optional input ports, and this
is how I proceed with it:

- Select some data object, then call that filter. It does not open the
input port item selection dialog because the one mandatory input is already
satisfied.

- I want to add one of the optional inputs (or both) - but the "change
input" option is greyed! Strange - because for me this would be the logical
moment to specify additional input, i.e.: BEFORE pressing the Apply
button...

- Ok, I press the Apply button thus. Of course the output is not what I
want because the optional inputs were missing...

- However, now I can choose also the "change input" option - and I do so. I
select the two optional inputs. But now nothing happens any more - and now
the Apply button is grey, so no way to trigger an update of the output!

To me this does not look very logical, so I assume that I am missing some
point...

The other "intuitive option" would be to select all the desired input
items, and only then open the filter. However this is impossible from the
beginning because now the filter is already greyed in the menu as being
"not applicable"!

Thanks for any helpful hints!

Regards,
Cornelis Bockem?hl

Hello,

I?m trying to visualise lagrangian particle pathlines.  I have run an openFoam simulation with particle tracking and would like to view the paths that the particles take.  I have read lots of discussion of this on the internet, but without much success.  I can load the data in Paraview and assign glyphs, but I can?t visualise the pathlines taken by the particles.

I am cautious that Paraview might have some functionality for interpolating particle tracking from the eulerian data.  I might end-up visualising this approximation, rather than the lagrangian data calculated on a timestep-by-timestep basis by openFoam.  (Although an ability to do either or both would be useful!)

So far, my best luck seems to have come from masking my data and then using the particlepath filter, using the un-masked data as my input and the masked data as a seed.  This is OK, but requires me to incrementally increase the finished time to observe the particle paths.

Can you offer any help?

Are you somehow opening these files in ParaView? I was not able to
either gzipped or not, which is what I expect because ParaView does
not have a Nifti reader to my knowledge.

In Slicer, which can open these files, the volumes are reported to
occupy the same space with an origin at (102.536, 106.413, 30.149).

Please provide more details, step-by-step, about how you are viewing
these files in ParaView.

Thanks,
Cory

Cory,

I think that reader is a plugin.  There is a plugin with NIFTI in the name
anyway.

Hi Chathuri,

Please keep your replies on the list so that others may have a chance to
participate in the discussion.

i meant applying a texture to the model rather than coloring it. Is it
> possible in Paraview?
>

Yes, it is possible. Please see page 60 as numbered on the pages (page 74
in the PDF) in the ParaView Guide to see how:

http://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.
php?submit=Download&version=v5.0&type=data&os=all&
downloadFile=ParaViewGuide-CE-v5.0.0.pdf

The relevant text is copied here for your convenience:

"Properties under the Miscellaneous group include Pickable. Uncheck this if
you want the dataset to be ignored when making selections. If the dataset
has a texture coordinates array, you can apply a texture to the dataset
surface using the Texture combo-box. Choose Load to load a texture or apply
a previously loaded texture listed in the combo-box. If your dataset
doesn?t have texture coordinates, you can create them by applying one of
Texture Map to Cylinder, Texture Map to Sphere, or Texture Map To Plane
filters."

HTH,
Cory

I have been using the analyseniftiio plugin to open .nii files in paraview.


In Slicer 4.6.2 they do not occupy the same physical space. The 
direction is different although the origin is the same.


Thanks

That sounds like a job for the "Temporal Particles To Pathlines" filter.

Hello,

I'm trying to visualise lagrangian particle pathlines.  I have run an openFoam simulation with particle tracking and would like to view the paths that the particles take.  I have read lots of discussion of this on the internet, but without much success.  I can load the data in Paraview and assign glyphs, but I can't visualise the pathlines taken by the particles.

I am cautious that Paraview might have some functionality for interpolating particle tracking from the eulerian data.  I might end-up visualising this approximation, rather than the lagrangian data calculated on a timestep-by-timestep basis by openFoam.  (Although an ability to do either or both would be useful!)

So far, my best luck seems to have come from masking my data and then using the particlepath filter, using the un-masked data as my input and the masked data as a seed.  This is OK, but requires me to incrementally increase the finished time to observe the particle paths.

Can you offer any help?

Ah, I see. I had forgotten about that one.

I looked again in Slicer and you are right. Looking at
vtkNIfTIReader.cxx, the direction information seems to be ignored by
ParaView. Which makes sense because VTK and ParaView do not support
the concept of direction cosines, just origin and spacing. In
ParaView, you'll have to transform one of the volumes using the
Transform filter and scaling the Z direction by -1. Because the x and
y direction diagonals are also -1, you may want to scale those axes by
-1 as well.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Cory,


It doesn't seem right to me that the coordinates are not correctly 
applied in Paraview and that a user should have to apply a 
transformation. I thought initially the issue was with VTK but on 
emailing the devel group I got the following response

Utkarsk,

Any way to make the points in time accumulate? I.e. not have the point
from t < current time, not disapear?

Yes, it is unfortunate. We wish ParaView could support every feature
one may find useful. Contributions from the community to support new
features are welcome!

Subject: [Paraview] errors when reading with Tecplot reader
Message-ID: <CALnXtyhvpKB_C4e9N=R0ri6f-6yUnpruC72VbRLHVieLEfwWmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

my name is Hao, I'm new here, I try to plot the .dat file (Tecplot file)
with Paraview 5.2.0, but get the following errors and so on.I guess it is
because, In 2012 paraview doesn't support Zonetype= Febrick, should it work
right now? How ?
febrick_3d.dat is an example file from Tecplot 360.

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering Backend OpenGL2 & PV 5.2.0-RC4 & SurfaceLic
	--> Problem...
Message-ID: <84a5a6aa-326f-a1ff-7789-28204a0ee502@DLR.de>

Hi,


i have a problem which is there in all RCs (1-4) of current ParaView: if 
i compile the RenderingBackend to "OpenGL2" and use SurfaceLic the 
visualization time goes up from a few seconds (with "OpenGL") to many 
minutes and the memory consumption from a few GByte to approx 100 GByte. 
Switching back to OpenGL any thing is fine. Without SurfaceLIC the 
OpenGL2 works although fine for me.

Has any one tested OpenGL2 with SurfaceLIC-Plugin the last time and has 
(the same)  problems?

o Kernel 4.7.6-1/ x86-64
o Quadro 4000
o NVidia driver v367.57
o PV 5.2.0 RC1 - RC4

Best regards,

        Stefan

Hi Cory,

Thanks for your response.

Well, for the benefit of others i will repeat my question & Cory's response.
So my question was how to change the texture of the 3D model (model can be
seen in my 1st mail)

Cory's response:
*Please see page 60 as numbered on the pages (page 74 in the PDF) in the
ParaView Guide to see how:*

*http://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.0&type=data&os=all&downloadFile=ParaViewGuide-CE-v5.0.0.pdf*
<http://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.0&type=data&os=all&downloadFile=ParaViewGuide-CE-v5.0.0.pdf>

*The relevant text is copied here for your convenience:*

*Properties under the Miscellaneous group include Pickable. Uncheck this if
you want the dataset to be ignored when making selections. If the dataset
has a texture coordinates array, you can apply a texture to the dataset
surface using the Texture combo-box. Choose Load to load a texture or apply
a previously loaded texture listed in the combo-box. If your dataset
doesn?t have texture coordinates, you can create them by applying one of
Texture Map to Cylinder, Texture Map to Sphere, or Texture Map To Plane
filters.*


Thank you once again Cory for your response. Appreciate it.

Chathuri Gunasekera.

Subject: [Paraview] Automatic connect to Catalyst
Message-ID: <f7c2aa9d-9c68-c770-3628-264f9199548e@dcs-computing.com>

Dear all,

I have written an adaptor for in situ visualization which works 
perfectly fine. In order to even further lower the entry barrier, I 
would like to be able to launch a ParaView session that automatically 
connects to that simulation and displays something.

Now obviously I know exactly how my Catalyst script looks like, so I 
know what types of data are available. And we can assume that this is 
not going to change.

I tried to generate a PV Python script using the trace option, but it 
did not show me any output related to connecting to the Catalyst 
simulation. Is it at all possible to do this via a Python script?

I also have not found any command line options that would allow me to 
connect to a certain Catalyst port, did I miss something here?

And finally if none of the above works, would a custom plug-in that is 
auto loaded allow me to perform this small piece of magic? Or any other 
ways of doing this?

Thanks in advance,

Arno

Samuel,

In the Contour filter, make sure you have the Compute Scalars option
on to be able to color your Contour by 'Max-Velocity-Mag'. I believe
the default was changed to not add this array as the array consists of
only the Contour value.

HTH,
Cory

Evan,

I can confirm loading your attached test.vtk file does not act right
in ParaView's development branch. The image dimensions and data arrays
appear to be read, but nothing shows up in the view, which is not
expected. I do not see the warning message you reported, though.

Could you zip up and share the VTK ASCII file that works as expected?

Thanks,
Cory

(Replying back to the ParaView mailing list so others can benefit from the conversation or fill in my knowledge gaps.)

I admit that I have found the Temporal Particles To Pathlines filter sometimes temperamental. I have to guess what might be going wrong. Here are some possibilities:


?         The filter draws lines of data as points move around over time. No lines will be drawn unless you hit that play button.

?         The filter needs to have consistent ids to know how to attach points from one time step to another.

?         The filter has a mask points feature that by default tracks only 1 out of every 100 points. You might need to lower that (possibly down to 1) to make things visible.

?         The filter has a max step distance option that will ignore connections of particles that move more than a certain distance between time steps. By default, that distance is 1 unit in every direction. If you have data that covers a large space, it might be the particles are moving too far to be tracked. You might need to bump that up.

?         The filter relies on time metadata in its input dataset to track when time advances. If this metadata is not there, you will probably get some errors in the output message window (with one about DATA_TIME_STEPS), and you will get no output data.

Without seeing your data, I don?t think I can narrow down the problem any further.

Hi Ken,

Do you know how to make that work?  I?ve have wrestled with that filter endlessly with no success.  I just get a blank screen, or it crashes.

That sounds like a job for the "Temporal Particles To Pathlines" filter.

Hello,

I?m trying to visualise lagrangian particle pathlines.  I have run an openFoam simulation with particle tracking and would like to view the paths that the particles take.  I have read lots of discussion of this on the internet, but without much success.  I can load the data in Paraview and assign glyphs, but I can?t visualise the pathlines taken by the particles.

I am cautious that Paraview might have some functionality for interpolating particle tracking from the eulerian data.  I might end-up visualising this approximation, rather than the lagrangian data calculated on a timestep-by-timestep basis by openFoam.  (Although an ability to do either or both would be useful!)

So far, my best luck seems to have come from masking my data and then using the particlepath filter, using the un-masked data as my input and the masked data as a seed.  This is OK, but requires me to incrementally increase the finished time to observe the particle paths.

Can you offer any help?

Subject: [Paraview] Optional input ports
Message-ID: <CACqg2jccZQUhk1CukjZs2CqHvJfyQ9OGwy_k2AZ+q8tnSK6uAw@mail.gmail.com>

Looks like I may have to provide an example that everybody can follow!?

The "Multicorrelative Statistics" filter is already such an example!

Reading the docs and looking into the server XML it is obvious that you can
optionally provide a model as a second input port. However, I cannot find
any way how to specify this second input:

- Directly selecting it (next to the primary input) has the effect that the
filter is greyed out in Paraview - no chance!

- Selecting only the primary data input allows to choose the
"Multicorrelative Statistics" filter just fine. I would expect that before
pressing "Apply" I should still specify the second input (the model thus),
but no chance: In the context menu, the "Change Input" option is greyed out
- and I cannot find any other way to enter any second input data.

- Pressing "Apply" does apply the filter, but without the optional model
data. Now the "Change Input" would be avaliable in the context menu, but
specifying any additional input NOW has no effect: the calculation is not
redone any more...

Bottom line: My first example was from a self-written filter, so there is
still the possibility that I have done something wrong. But with the
standard filter that comes with every Paraview installation I would expect
that there MUST be some way to provide that second input data item!?

I am simply lost here!

Regards,
Cornelis

Dear Mathieu,

As I said I do not think it is a problem in my XML or C++ code, but a
"simple user question"! Which is why I explained that it also happens with
the "standard filter" from the standard package: Multicorrelative
Statistics.

For this reason I am now providing also simply the XML for that filter
which is from the following file in the paraview sources:

ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/filter.xml

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    <SourceProxy class="vtkPSciVizMultiCorrelativeStats"
                 label="Multicorrelative Statistics"
                 name="MulticorrelativeStatistics">
      <Documentation long_help="Compute a statistical model of a dataset
and/or assess the dataset with a statistical model."
                     short_help="Compute a statistical model of a dataset
and/or assess the dataset with a statistical model.">
      This filter either computes a statistical model of a dataset or takes
      such a model as its second input. Then, the model (however it is
      obtained) may optionally be used to assess the input dataset.&lt;p&gt;
      This filter computes the covariance matrix for all the arrays you
select
      plus the mean of each array. The model is thus a multivariate Gaussian
      distribution with the mean vector and variances provided. Data is
      assessed using this model by computing the Mahalanobis distance for
each
      input point. This distance will always be positive.&lt;p&gt; The
learned
      model output format is rather dense and can be confusing, so it is
      discussed here. The first filter output is a multiblock dataset
      consisting of 2 tables: &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; Raw covariance data.
      &lt;li&gt; Covariance matrix and its Cholesky decomposition.
&lt;/ol&gt;
      The raw covariance table has 3 meaningful columns: 2 titled "Column1"
and
      "Column2" whose entries generally refer to the N arrays you selected
when
      preparing the filter and 1 column titled "Entries" that contains
numeric
      values. The first row will always contain the number of observations
in
      the statistical analysis. The next N rows contain the mean for each of
      the N arrays you selected. The remaining rows contain covariances of
      pairs of arrays.&lt;p&gt; The second table (covariance matrix and
      Cholesky decomposition) contains information derived from the raw
      covariance data of the first table. The first N rows of the first
column
      contain the name of one array you selected for analysis. These rows
are
      followed by a single entry labeled "Cholesky" for a total of N+1 rows.
      The second column, Mean contains the mean of each variable in the
first N
      entries and the number of observations processed in the final (N+1)
      row.&lt;p&gt; The remaining columns (there are N, one for each array)
      contain 2 matrices in triangular format. The upper right triangle
      contains the covariance matrix (which is symmetric, so its lower
triangle
      may be inferred). The lower left triangle contains the Cholesky
      decomposition of the covariance matrix (which is triangular, so its
upper
      triangle is zero). Because the diagonal must be stored for both
matrices,
      an additional row is required &#226;&#8364;&#8221; hence the N+1 rows
and
      the final entry of the column named "Column".</Documentation>

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You find the explanation about the "optional" model input, and also the
second "InputProperty" tag, with the name "ModelInput", and the "Hint"
"optional".

My problem is that if I am running ParaView just normally and try to
provide a first and second input to that filter, I do not find a way to
provide the second one that is "optional"!

With my own filter I found now some stupid workaround: just drop the
"optional" in the "Hints": then it is not any more optional, but a window
pops up that asks for the inputs. In this case I can of course specify the
second input - or leave it: It is then a question of the RequestData
function in the C++ to handle this case properly: a second input with a
null pointer.

But this is

a) probably not how it SHOULD work, and
b) not an option for the standard filters (such as Multicorrelative
Statistics) - if I do not want to change all the paraview sources (xml) and
recompile...

Sorry to bother this list at all because I am afraid that the solution is
in some very simple and "almost obvious" little thing that I have
overlooked in the paraview GUI... ;-)

Cornelis

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with plot over line in 2D data sets
Message-ID: <CAAcjak=j8S5-DLK+mPg2E21rfsE5PE2deicYQYV5TbZWU39rWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all;
I wrote my own subroutine to export my CFD data to Paraview using ensight
gold format. I have two different subroutines. One for 3D datasets and
another for 2D datasets. I did this because in Paraview although the vector
field is 2D, the 3D subroutine allowed me to rotate a 2D datasets, which
does not make sense. When I use the 2D subroutine the contour plot is a
plane and it does not rotate. Ok. so far everything works perfect. I can
obtain my contour plots and so forth. But, when I apply the filer: plot
over line, the plot does not shown anything. It seems like paraview does
not read anything., However, when I use the probe filter , the probe
retrieve data from the dataset.
What might be the problem?

Thanks
Julio Mendez

Hello

Sorry i missed the part when you said that a standard filter showed this
behavior.
Indeed, the behavior you are seeing is normal, considering the input
management greyed out. One could argue the that it should be authorized to
change input before applying but it is not supported.

However, this part
| Now the "Change Input" would be avaliable in the context menu, but
specifying any additional input NOW has no effect: the calculation is not
redone any more...

Looks like a bug in your filter. I know nothing about statistics, but a
tried specifying the optional model input this way with multicorelative,
and it seems to change trigger a recomputation of the filter with different
results.

Mathieu Westphal

Hello Mathieu,

Right: also for me "something" is changing - just after adding the second
input: I will have to check whether it is indeed the right thing!

So maybe this is indeed the way how it should operate - and I have to see
that it does it the same way also for my own filter.

I was fixed on the expectation that I would have to at least press "Apply"
again - or even be able to define the second input already before doing a
first "Apply" - but maybe this is not what the Paraview designers had in
mind...

However, just reasoning: In a simple case (like also mine) it may not be a
big deal to do the calculation twice, but if it is more "serious", this
extra "Apply" (once without then once more with the second input) looks a
bit weird to me!?

Anyway, let's try to play according to the rules - and change them only
with very serious reasons!

Thanks and regards,
Cornelis

Hi there, I searched the maillist but found that this has never been

isosurface and the other for coloring the isosurface. How can I make this

You can combine two data sources with the Append Attributes filter in
ParaView, but they must have the same topology (points and cells). The
scalar arrays should also have different names. If this is the case
for your two VTK files, you can Contour by one, then color by the
other.

HTH,
Cory

Thanks  a lot Cory - you saved my day!

While this must be trivial for experienced paraview users, I still 
want to share the detailed steps: (1) load two files one by one; make sure 
they have the same topology and different scalar array names; (2) 
select both files in the pipeline window by using Shift key and 
clicking two file names; (3) with two files selected, go to Filters 
and choose Append Attributes; This creates a new object AppendAttributes1; 
(4) using this new object to create contour and color it. Now there are 
options in Contour by and Coloring when creating contour. Choose the array
at your choice.

Thanks again.

Subject: [Paraview] PythonQt build error
Message-ID: <31681a3f-d328-f5c0-8271-1bf84f259e72@iinet.net.au>

Building PythonQt plugin for paraview-5.2.0 fails due to use of Qt4::moc 
command in the generated file 
(build)/Plugins/PythonQtPlugin/CMakeFiles/PythonQtPlugin.dir/build.make

I can work around the problem locally by using sed in my build script to 
replace "Qt4::moc" in that file with plain "moc" just after cmake 
configuration, but it would be nicer not to have to do that.

No such problem with previous building of paraview-5.1.2.

I'm using x86_64 Linux with cmake-3.5.2, qt-4.8.7 and PythonQt from 
commontk git repo 20160810.

Hello,

In the binary package of the 5.2.0 release for linux
(ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz) the python libraries
are under:
'ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/python2.7', whereas with
the 5.1.2 release, the files are located under:
'ParaView-5.1.2-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-5.1/lib/python2.7'.

Is it an intentional change ? Because with this new location, there is
many file conflicts with system python libraries located in
'/usr/lib/python2.7'.

Thanks by advance,

Regards.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug with PV 5.2 with python max / min
Message-ID: <CAB8-E4DA53Ko6OM8PeCzm7-b0=+HxctYNr9FxDkYcMn5B9YiSA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have just tested the new paraview 5.2 with a python script.

With versions 4.4.0 and 5.1.2, this script worked fine.

In this script, I have a ProgrammableSource where I compute the maximum
values of two scalars with max function.

The code looks like this in the Script of the ProgrammableSource

maxValue = max(1,2)

This instruction creates an error: instead of using built-in max function,
ParaView5.2 uses a max function defined with vtk and numpy:

ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit\bin\Lib\site-
packages\vtk\numpy_interface\algorithms.py line 315

And apparently, it does not work (whereas in 4.4.0 and 5.1.2 it worked,
maybe these versions did not use this function).

For the time being, I have created a dirty workaround where I have defined
new min / max functions

    fmin = lambda x,y:x if x<y else y
    fmax = lambda x,y:x if x>y else y



Below are the message error and a python script that reproduces the bug


Traceback (most recent call last):

Hi Guillaume,

Thanks for the report.

As a workaround, you can still use the builtin min() function with

from __builtin__ import min as min, max as max

Actually, you should be able to just use

from __builtin__ import min, max

Also, I filed a bug report here:

Yes, it was done intentionally, though possibly in ignorance to use
cases where it being separate is a benefit. The idea is to make the
package look as much like you'd expect if ParaView were installed
normally (i.e., a Python module would be put under the expected
site-packages directory).

You can create symlinks from anywhere to the paraview and vtk
directories in the packaged binary and set PYTHONPATH to it if you'd
like to use an external Python as a stopgap, but what is your reason for
wanting an external Python? Would making those packages available to the
packaged Python be sufficient?

Julio,

Plot Over Line can have some difficulty to probe line locations along
a 2D plane, if the locations end up slightly above of below the plane.
I suspect that what's you're seeing. When you say you use the  probe,
is that the "Probe Location" filter that you're using?

Subject: [Paraview] RAW (binary) file import issues
Message-ID: <30A66172CB124E45B9646EE1B4567000A7DC6D42@SRV00046.soton.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I am encountering issues when trying to import large 8 bit RAW volumes to Paraview 5.1.2 (64 bit).

The file I wish to import has xyz dimensions of 2000x2000x1920 voxels (Unsigned char), 7.5GB.  I am running a machine with 192 GB RAM and 12 CPU cores.

I can import up to a 2000x2000x1000 crop of this file, but I encounter the following message when I attempt larger z dimensions:

ERROR: In C:\bbd\df0abce0\source-paraview\VTK\IO\Image\vtkImageReader2.cxx, line 592

vtkPVImageReader (0000000007767F90): Initialize: Could not open file \\cseg_2\ERC\SLS_201606\Myco_2\CT2PpR3h1_\Hyphalseg_Raw_2000_2000_1920_8bit_SKELETON_FILT_PARAVIEW_TEST.raw


I cannot find an obvious memory ceiling within the paraview settings - any ideas as to whether there is some effective upper limit to import file size?

Thanks for looking at it so quickly. However that change doesn't fix it 
for me. Here's some of the session:

- first confirm that change (addition of "include(ParaViewQt)" is applied:
root at sl64-142-vmbuilder:/tmp/SBo/ParaView-v5.2.0/build# head -13 
/tmp/SBo/ParaView-v5.2.0/Plugins/PythonQtPlugin/CMakeLists.txt
if (ParaView_SOURCE_DIR)
else()
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.3)
   project(PythonQtPlugin)

   find_package(ParaView REQUIRED)
   include(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
endif()


include(ParaViewQt)
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
find_package(PythonQt REQUIRED)

- yes, patch applied so try make:
root at sl64-142-vmbuilder:/tmp/SBo/ParaView-v5.2.0/build# make -j1
.....
[ 99%] Generating moc_pqPythonQtPluginImplementation.cxx
/bin/sh: Qt4::moc: command not found
Plugins/PythonQtPlugin/CMakeFiles/PythonQtPlugin.dir/build.make:62: 
recipe for target 
'Plugins/PythonQtPlugin/moc_pqPythonQtPluginImplementation.cxx' failed
make[2]: ***

make[1]: *** [Plugins/PythonQtPlugin/CMakeFiles/PythonQtPlugin.dir/all] 
Error 2
Makefile:149: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2


So I still have a failure, even with the change in place. If I edit the 
offending file 
Plugins/PythonQtPlugin/CMakeFiles/PythonQtPlugin.dir/build.make and 
change all instances of "Qt4::moc" to plain "moc", then compilation 
carries on to completion:

Ok, I saw the issue #16870 after sending my question. There is also some
conflicts with binary files (for instance mpiexec).

I think I will drop everything in /opt instead of /usr to avoid those
conflicts with system files.

Oops, I should have tested with Qt 4. It worked for some reason with Qt 5.
I've updated the MR, it was indeed missing essential components.

Hi all,


When I operating ParaView on MPI mode, Find Data function does not work correctly.
The dialog is just opened, but the 'Run Selection Query' always returns no cell or point.

How to select specific cells or points on parallel ParaView?
My PV is v5.2.0-RC1 on Windows 8 64bit, and MPI is Microsoft HPC Pack 2008 R2.

Hi All,

I manually import data for NS equations, create filter, and finally save
some pictures. I was wondering if paraview can reproduce exactly the same
things I have done before by using scripts?

In CUBIT, anythings users did will be saved a jour file, and this file can
be used to reproduce what have done before. Does paraview have a similar
thing?

ParaView has extensive Python scripting capabilities that will do what
you are looking for. Usually the easiest way to get started is to
create a Python trace, which is a script generated from actions you
take in the GUI. Launch ParaView, then select the menu item "Tools ->
Start Trace". Do the actions you want, then select "Tools -> Stop
Trace". You'll see the generated Python script in a window that pops
up. You can save that script and then run it with pvpython or through
the Python console in the ParaView application. You can of course
modify the Python script to open different input files and save images
to different file names.

Please consult the ParaView Guide [1] for additional details on Python
scripting in ParaView.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting solution vector from Matlab in Paraview
Message-ID: <CAPXVtiRn+GpbMDNqZ1H0TEcCk=FkEXRe+kxFdkaH0OUve7xhdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello fellow members,

I am solving a 2D hyperbolic PDE, which gives me a solution in 'x' and 'y'
direction for each node on the mesh, for each time step. Therefore, if I
freeze the time step, I have a solution vector in 'x', and 'y', for the
whole mesh, i.e., a single value in both 'x' and 'y' direction, for each
node on mesh.

It looks like this when the solution is initially viewed in Paraview.
Observe any one of the below.


?
You can notice the 'x' and 'y' solution for all points (nodes). The no. of
rows is the total no. of nodes on mesh.

Then, I convert this vtk file to .csv, and import it to MATLAB, where I run
some post processing on the 'x' and 'y' solution vectors. Now, I have
replaced the originally imported solution vectors 'x' and 'y', with some
new values. I wanted to take back these new solutions to Paraview again for
plotting. So I used a tool called vtktrisurf in MATLAB. The problem was
that this tool only takes 1 solution vector, i.e., I can either give the
'x' solution vector or 'y'. So, I used pythagoras theorem on respective
elements of 'x' and 'y' solutions, to generate a single vector. The vtk was
created, and the simulation in PARAVIEW was exactly what I was hoping to
see. However, when I use pythagoras theorem, I convert all negative
components of the solution to positive. It will show me what I want to see
when there is no scalar warping. However, when I warp it with scalar in
Paraview, it shows the entire profile in positive values. That is not
actually true, because there were negative values in the solution. Long
story short, how can I view the correct simulation. Maybe the answer goes
back to the point where I convert my matrix in MATLAB to vtk. I also have
the option of creating a separate vtk for 'x' solution and separate for
'y'. In that case, is there a way to superpose them in Paraview to view the
correct profile?

Thanks a lot for your time and help!

Sincerely,
Chaitanya

Message-ID: <CACmOSR0trYj7qWq_jW-M15xrMthGGZoYZh19fzxWjayLQiH3Vg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have checked the paraview mail list, as far as I know, pvpython do not
work with python 3 until last year. However, a year past, dose it work with
python 3 now?

The document said it works,
*ParaView is working towards full Python 3 support. To that end, python
code should be written so it is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5. *
See
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/python-2-vs-3.html

If it works, what should I do to use it?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] empty xdmf-file causes paraview crash
Message-ID: <82c7b233-d064-5128-0ab9-3a8125f3cc54@fcc.chalmers.se>

Hi All,

I'm trying to get Paraview (5.0.0) to read *.xmf-files and encounter 
difficulties when the geometry is "empty". Paraview is then crashing. 
The example I'm using to encounter the error looks as follows:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">
   <Domain>
     <Grid GridType="Uniform">
       <Topology TopologyType="Triangle" Dimensions="0">
       </Topology>
       <Geometry GeometryType="XYZ" Dimensions="0">
       </Geometry>
     </Grid>
   </Domain>
</Xdmf>

How is an empty xdmf geometry supposed to be specified?

One workaround is to add a dummy point e.g.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">
   <Domain>
     <Grid GridType="Uniform">
       <Topology TopologyType="Triangle" Dimensions="0">
       </Topology>
       <Geometry GeometryType="XYZ">
         <DataItem Dimensions="1 3" NumberType="Float" Precision="4" 
Format="XML">
0 0 0
</DataItem>
       </Geometry>
     </Grid>
   </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Will I have to settle with this workaround? How is an empty geometry 
supposed to be specified?

Python 3 support should be officially supported in the next release,
sometime in spring 2017.

You can experimentally build ParaView's development version with
Python 3 using the following settings (taken from a build on Ubuntu):

PYTHON_EXECUTABLE             /usr/bin/python3
PYTHON_EXTRA_LIBS
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR            /usr/include/python3.5m
PYTHON_LIBRARY                /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so
PYTHON_UTIL_LIBRARY           /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libutil.so
VTK_PYTHON_VERSION                3

ParaViewWeb won't work, because it depends on Twisted server which is
still python2, so make sure ParaViewWeb is disabled.

You may also need to install on Ubuntu the following:

sudo apt-get install python2-dev python3-dev

python3.5m gets installed by python3 package

Thanks,
Cory

Dear Cory,

Thanks very much for your reply.

I have tried what you said, however, I got some error report,
*[  2%] Compiling Python package 'twisted'*

It looks like that python 2 have been used when I make the code.

The configure commands I used associated with python are showing below, I
think I told the compiler use a python 3 environment.

Thanks.

Yep, as I mentioned the version of twisted ParaViewWeb uses is not
compatible with Python 3. Set PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB to OFF and try again.

The twisted package needs to be updated to work with Python 3, but that has
not happened yet.

Is VTK_Group_Web ON? Try turning it off. Also make sure all the
Module_vtkWeb* options are off.

Dear Cory,

I have checked, and any option include WEB have been turned OFF.

I setted options BUILD_EXAMPLES, BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, BUILD_DOCUMENTATION,
BUILD_TESTING, and PARAVIEW_ENABLE_CATALYST off, and now the error
information changs. I'm not sure which one works actually.
Now the message is:
*In file included from

I'm not sure what the problem is. We've barely tested building against
Python 3, and I personally have never built with Python 3, so it's quite
possible you have uncovered a problem. Unfortunately, I don't have time to
investigate further at the moment.

If you figure it out, please let us know.

Best,
Cory

Just to add one small data point, I was able to compile ParaView
master against Python 3 on my Linux system. Right now it looks like
opening the Python shell causes a segfault (at least for me). Tomviz
is a ParaView based GUI, and it also hits a compile failure at the
moment.

Hopefully we will have more time to look at this in December/January,
but it is not a high priority right now (although I don't want to wait
too long).

Thanks for both of you. I think the best way for me is waiting the new

Hi

I currently updated my paraview and saw that my custom filter object panels which are inherited from pqObjectPanel and pqNamedObjectPanel seems to be deprecated.. I googled but could not find a migration guide. Can you give me a hint where to look?

thanks

Gerald,

The pqObjectPanel/pqNamedObjectPanel have been long deprecated --
~4.0. This page covers the new design:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Properties_Panel

This covers the changes to the plugins:

Arno,

Not currently, I am afraid. The connect-to-live functionality is
currently not exposed to Python and hence not scriptable or accessible
via Python API alone.

> I also have not found any command line options that would allow me to
> connect to a certain Catalyst port, did I miss something here?

Correct, they don't exist either. Feel free to add a feature request
for the case or put together a merge-request to add support for this.

Yes, that may be possible. Follow the code path starting with
pqCatalystConnectReaction::connect()[1]. That will tell you how
ParaView connects to insitu. You can mimic parts of that in your
plugin's auto-start method.

Gerald,

The pqObjectPanel/pqNamedObjectPanel have been long deprecated -- ~4.0. This page covers the new design:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Properties_Panel

This covers the changes to the plugins:

Utkarsh,

thanks for your reply. As you suggested I opened the following issue on 
your gitlab page:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17037

Unfortunately I do not have time to devote to resolving this issue 
myself currently. Whether or not that will change is unclear at the moment.

Thanks,
Arno

Hmmm that happens to be around 4 GB which makes me wonder if there is a
limit somewhere in that reader... Any chance you can try this on a Linux
machine?

I've hit that before. the RAW reader uses MPI-I/O, and MPI uses signed 
int everywhere in its API, so there are limits that you end up hitting. 
For instance to partition the data among processors one must give 
MPI-I/O the starting offset of the data in the file as a signed int, and 
that is limited to 2^31.

Message-ID: <CAE=GJrZt5HPZxgeGPj775WJzoARUvNpxe2LKT3SS-LRfYBuTKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

After version 5.0 of paraview for Windows x64 everytime I export a Scene in
VRML format I get the warning

Warning: In

It happens with any data, even a Box from Source.

The data seems to be exported correctly though.

Is that a bug?

Can anyone help me turning it off? My macros won't work because of that.

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <44db108eb6024280b31a555bdbc95754@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Although we have certainly run into issues with communicating large messages, I?m not sure this is the issue with MPI-I/O. File sizes and linear offsets use a type MPI_Offset, which according to the specification should be large enough to hold the size of any file supported by the file system. Although it is true that creating the 3D subarray uses 32-bit indices, those are for each of the separate dimensions, and 2000 falls well below that limit.

Besides, it looks like that error happens when checking an ifstream object, so it looks like the reader is bypassing the MPI-I/O path anyway.

I would follow Berk?s suggesting of looking into the filesystem before diving into the guts of MPI-I/O.

I cannot find an obvious memory ceiling within the paraview settings - any ideas as to whether there is some effective upper limit to import file size?

I believe Visual studio 2010 does not properly handle file seeks/etc beyond
32 bit even on 64 bit builds. If you are using VS 2010 or earlier that is
possibly the issue. I believe it is fixed in VS 2013 and later.

I can certainly reproduce the issue. I'll try to track it down tomorrow and
get back to you.

Leo,

The issue was that the exporer was warning unnecessarily when exporting
empty datasets. At the same time, it would end up modifying the exported
file partially for the empty dataset. This MR should fix both issues:

Do you think you can test it out before we merge this in?

Thanks

Hi!

In order to test I would have to build Paraview, right?
I'm not used to build quickly for testing, I did it only a few times with
the porpuse of using Paraview for VR(MPI + VRPN) in a CAVE. It may take a
considerable amount of time for me to learn. I would be glad to do it but
I'm not sure I can. Sorry Utkarsh.

Best Regards,

The problem I was having is that I was planning and trying  to use a polygon.  It seems that if you try to use that Slice Along Polyline, but select a polygon for the input, it crashes paraview (it should probably bring up an error, or only allow a polyline!).  I realized that it actually wants a polyline, and once I created one for my region, the filter does what I had been looking for.  
But, that leads to another question?  If I want a whole region to be another color, is there a way to fill the output of SliceAlongPolyLine?  So, instead of just an outline, I can get the inside to also be a certain color?  

Thanks for the help.

I just realized that my test was a little unfair, I used the build
parameters for ParaView that Tomviz uses to enable threaded Python
support,

     VTK_PYTHON_FULL_THREADSAFE:BOOL=ON
     VTK_NO_PYTHON_THREADS:BOOL=OFF

If I switch that to

     VTK_NO_PYTHON_THREADS:BOOL=ON

then ParaView seems to work quite well, and I can start the Python
shell without issue. This is obviously a concern for us as we would
like to use threaded Python to execute workloads on a worker thread
that doesn't freeze the user interface, but if you leave these CMake
flags at their default it would appear to be a usable ParaView build
in my limited testing.

Subject: [Paraview] Need urgent help: Edit Color Bar: How to revert to
	default
Message-ID: <CAOjpMgX8_sFcWv1tLVqvzs+FO5hs1wireLT7bH+97ENCaQzZVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Fellow Members,

I was playing with the Paraview Color bar editor and I messed up the Color
Scale bar. I just kept clicking and new points were created and I kept
moving them here and there. Initially, the color space was set to
'diverging', and the initial color bar was ranging from red to navy blue
color.

I was doing all this under the assumption that the "Make default" button at
the bottom will set everything to default again. But it doesn't work.

I even uninstalled Paraview and reinstalled again, but the changes I made
remain.

Can any one please tell me how to get rid of this and revert back to my
original red to blue scale. I tried reading how to edit the bar but I
couldn't revert back to the original colors. Some what close but not
original.

Please help.

Thanks!

Hi Cindy!

Could you please give us more information about the type of dataset you are
working with (structured or unstructured, multiblock or not) and the total
number of points & cells of those models?
Is your input stored in a paralle data format (eg.PVT*, xdmf, hdf5 etc)?
If not, and data is unstructured, there is pretty good chances that all the
data will be loaded only on the first rank of your server and then
processing only performed with real data on this rank (other will just pass
through empty dataset). You can check if data is distributed by applying
the "Process Id Scalars" and color the grid with this field, it will show
data partitionning over the processors (1 color per rank). If it is all
blue, data is only on first rank, bad news.
In this last case, you can indeed use D3 to redistribute the data over all
the processors, then all processors (apply Process Id Scalars) should show
better result.
Problem is that D3 takes time to perform and if your data is temporal, it
will be run at every timestep!

Hope it helps!

A+ et bon courage :)

Hi Tommy,

I have tested with ParaView 5.2 and it works as expected, no crash.
Xdmf reader has been patched at different places since 5.0 and ParaView
also comes with an optional Xdmf3 reader.
Thus I would recommend that you update your ParaView to 5.2.

Hi,

 

                Can  someone tell us how to customize the Paraview Web
buttonbar, please? Exactly we would be interested in hiding Show File List
and Show Save Options buttons. Can someone say to us which section of code
could we edit to do this?

 

Thank you in advance, regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Need node numbers and element node connectivity
Message-ID: <CAPXVtiRqkxTaNOJy1oKALMVgr4xabtNRopBhsWJd2nyqo8sZFw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I run a FEM simulation in FEniCS to obtain two output files. One is of .vtu
format and the other is of .xdmf format.

However, because I do parallel processing, in the former case, I actually
obtain different .vtu files for different processors, a single .pvtu file
and  a single .pvd file. In the latter case, I obtain a single .xdmf and a
.h5 file.

Both simulations are 2D, and if you open the spreadsheet format in
Paraview, you see something like this:


?
I need to do some post processing on the solution vectors 'u' and 'v'. You
may also refer to them as 'ux' and 'uy' OR "f_18_1" and "f_18_2".
Therefore, I need to import it in MATLAB. To do that, in ParaView, I first
go to menu >> save data >> save file in CSV format for all points. The csv
file I am looking at gives me 6 columns - Coordinate X, Y, Z, Solution ux,
uy, uz. Here Z and uz are zero vectors. How can I also get the node number
for the given node coordinates, and how can I get the elemental nodal
connectivity? Any help is greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
Chaitanya

Hello,

is there any work on integrating ITK filters into PV?

What is the easiest way to do it?

Is there other 2D images filters available?

Thx in advance for your help.

hmm, that may be but there are places in MPI I/O that limit to size of 
signed int, here is cut direct from the mpi 3 standard:

    int MPI_File_read_all(MPI_File fh, void *buf, int count,
    MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Status *status)

the count argument is a signed int, so one can't read more than INT_MAX 
in one go, and here is the VTK code where that is used

291   // Figure out how many bytes to read.
292   vtkIdType length = this->GetDataScalarTypeSize();
293   length *= this->NumberOfScalarComponents;
294   length *= extent[1]-extent[0]+1;
295   length *= extent[3]-extent[2]+1;
296   if (this->GetFileDimensionality() == 3) length *= 
extent[5]-extent[4]+1;
297
298   if (length > VTK_INT_MAX)
299     {
300     vtkErrorMacro(<< "Cannot read more than " << VTK_INT_MAX
301                   << " bytes at a time.");
302     }
303
304   // Do the read.  This is a coordinated parallel operation for 
efficiency.
305   MPICall(MPI_File_read_all(file.Handle, buffer, 
static_cast<int>(length),
306                             MPI_BYTE, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE));

the VTK code checks for over flow. however as that is not the error 
reported by the user, I have to admit that I am wrong about Sam's 
problem. Sorry about that.

Hi,

Is there an API in C++/Python, to read and write *.vtm multiblock files?

Ideally I expect this to be there in the VTK library. If not, it should at least be there in Paraview.

Thank you.

vtkXMLMultiBlockDataWriter can be used for this

Hello,

It seems that it was possible to change Orientation Axes in the past.
Is it possible to do it now? I can't find a way to do it. I attach an
image and a Paraview Session file to illustrate different styles that
I would like to have.

It would be cool to have these styles by default, but being able to
add them afterward might work as well.

Thanks,

I just tried it with 5.2.0 in parallel and the Find Data dialog works
fine for the queries I tried.

Could you provide more information about what you are trying to get to
work? Listing the steps you take before running into the problem is
helpful. For example, telling us which data file you loaded, what your
Find Data query is, etc.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi ALL,

There is question. I have a pressure variable named p defined on the whole

should integrate p on the whole domain, then and divide by the volume of
the domain.

Thanks so much.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Need node numbers and element node connectivity

Dear All,

I run a FEM simulation in FEniCS to obtain two output files. One is of .vtu format and the other is of .xdmf format.

However, because I do parallel processing, in the former case, I actually obtain different .vtu files for different processors, a single .pvtu file and  a single .pvd file. In the latter case, I obtain a single .xdmf and a .h5 file.

Both simulations are 2D, and if you open the spreadsheet format in Paraview, you see something like this:

[cid:image001.png at 01D248D2.926E9B60]
?
I need to do some post processing on the solution vectors 'u' and 'v'. You may also refer to them as 'ux' and 'uy' OR "f_18_1" and "f_18_2". Therefore, I need to import it in MATLAB. To do that, in ParaView, I first go to menu >> save data >> save file in CSV format for all points. The csv file I am looking at gives me 6 columns - Coordinate X, Y, Z, Solution ux, uy, uz. Here Z and uz are zero vectors. How can I also get the node number for the given node coordinates, and how can I get the elemental nodal connectivity? Any help is greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
Chaitanya

Message-ID: <BE3BD724-0B30-4134-957E-653F478CF2AF@sandia.gov>

Marc,

Sorry for the low response on this question. Your question came in right as Thanksgiving holiday weekend started in the US.

If you scroll down to the bottom of the Color Map Editor you will see a row of buttons on the bottom. The leftmost of these buttons is a circle of two arrows. If you press that button, the current color map will be restored to ParaView defaults. Then you should press the button that is two over with the same icon as save data (a folder with a green arrow pointing down into it). When you click that button, the current color map becomes the default color map.

If you are still having trouble, you should be able to get around the problem by simply deleting your ParaView configuration files, which will restore all of ParaView settings to their defaults. The location of these configuration files is documented here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files

Hello Fellow Members,

I was playing with the Paraview Color bar editor and I messed up the Color Scale bar. I just kept clicking and new points were created and I kept moving them here and there. Initially, the color space was set to 'diverging', and the initial color bar was ranging from red to navy blue color.

I was doing all this under the assumption that the "Make default" button at the bottom will set everything to default again. But it doesn't work.

I even uninstalled Paraview and reinstalled again, but the changes I made remain.

Can any one please tell me how to get rid of this and revert back to my original red to blue scale. I tried reading how to edit the bar but I couldn't revert back to the original colors. Some what close but not original.

Please help.

Thanks!
Marc

Hi Nicolas,

Unfortunately, in recent versions ParaView does not offer (in the GUI) the
possibility to customize the orientation axes (except label color).

I am curious, in which version did you have to possibility to change more
options?

Is it possible to add more options in this direction? Most of the time
I don't use the orientation axes, but in the cases I do I would like
to have options. Each visualization is different and requires
different treatment.

I think that a set of predefined options and some edition
possibilities would be really useful.

I don't remember, but I remember more options in previous versions (maybe 3.x?).

Nicolas,
If this was possible, it was a long time ago.  At present, ParaView does not have the ability to change orientation axes as you specify.  You could add the request to the User Voice.  You can add these from Paraview's front page, under "Request a New Feature".  

The orientation axis is somewhat customizable with regards to color.  In the Properties tab, search for Axes.

Nicolas,

ParaView is an open-source project and everybody is welcome to participate.
At Kitware we lead the project and develop the tool and new features
according our customer's need.
Unless a customer request (and pay for) this feature and unless a good
Samaritan
develop it and share, you can only count on yourself here. Of course if you
want to do it,
you will certainly get help on the developers mailing list (paraview-dev).
There is one chance however to have this done by us one day: talk loud
enough on ParaView's uservoice
<https://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general> and ... cross your
fingers ;)

Best,
Joachim

In the past, I have used ITK in custom ParaView plugins written in
C++. That's a fairly straightforward approach when you use the VtkGlue
module from ITK to transfer data between VTK and ITK image data types.
See http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo for information
about ParaView plugins.

Another approached used by Tomviz, a ParaView-based application,
involves using ITK in some filtering operations. It uses ITK's Python
bindings and imports the itk package in the ITK-based Python filters.
See https://github.com/OpenChemistry/tomviz for the Tomviz source
code.

HTH,
Cory

Hi there,

I was trying to follow the instructions on this wiki
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Space_Navigator) to make my Space Mouse
Pro work with Paraview 5.2.0. I succeeded in doing the first step, but
then the wiki says the following:

"NOTE: You have to manually build ParaView from source with
PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_VRPNPlugin set to ON. We are looking into
packing the plugin with distributed binaries onwards."

Somehow this option is not available in cmake file although the VR
Plugin is in the Plugins directory.

Two questions:
1. That page was last updated in 2014; did since then the plan succeed
to include it in the binaries (I guess not, as I could not locate it)

2. If it is not included in the binaries, what should I add to the
CMakeList to correctly install the plugin?

Thanks,
D.

You should just enable PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_VRPlugin as the
instructions say. It is an advanced CMakeLists.txt option, so make
sure you have the advanced mode enabled in the CMake user interface.

If I may, I?ll soften Joachim?s response a bit.

Kitware, Sandia, and many other stakeholders care a lot about the stability, usability, and features of ParaView. But as with any software product, we have limited resources for development and must prioritize the work that we do. There are several independent developers contributing changes most important to them, but we also want to make sure ParaView satisfies the needs of as many users as possible. As multiple people have already stated, we use https://paraview.uservoice.com as a tool to gauge how important new features are to multiple users. Those features that are upvoted by the most users are prioritized to be implemented. Thus if you would like to see a new feature in ParaView, going to its uservoice page is your best bet.

Nicolas,
ParaView is an open-source project and everybody is welcome to participate.
At Kitware we lead the project and develop the tool and new features according our customer's need.
Unless a customer request (and pay for) this feature and unless a good Samaritan
develop it and share, you can only count on yourself here. Of course if you want to do it,
you will certainly get help on the developers mailing list (paraview-dev).
There is one chance however to have this done by us one day: talk loud
enough on ParaView's uservoice<%20https:/paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general> and ... cross your fingers ;)
Best,

Hello Joachim,

Is it possible to add more options in this direction? Most of the time
I don't use the orientation axes, but in the cases I do I would like
to have options. Each visualization is different and requires
different treatment.

I think that a set of predefined options and some edition
possibilities would be really useful.

I don't remember, but I remember more options in previous versions (maybe 3.x?).

Hi Cory,

Ah Yeah, I forgot to mention that I'm compiling on OSx. This option is
not available neither in Paraview 5.2.0 nor in 5.0.0 (both of which I
compiled from source). Have a look at the screenshot.

Thanks,
D.

Dinu,

I do my main development on a Mac and the option is indeed listed in
the ccmake. The option variable is not defined in the top-level
CMakeLists.txt file, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. There is
some CMake code that looks in the plugins directory and creates the
option variable for each plugin during CMake configuration.

Try this:

In your ParaView build directory, run

ccmake .

Toggle the advanced options on by pressing the 't' key. Now type '/'
and search for PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_VRPlugin. It should be listed,
with a default setting to off.

Let us know how it goes,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Segfault reading polyhedral cells xdmf3 file
Message-ID: <CAKQvD9SZ7sfbryHhX=yCK=kGan7CdABad7UdyPm4WFZPrPocAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
     I would like to use xdmf file format for exporting polyhedral mesh
results from a CFD code to be opened with Paraview. If I'm not wrong
Paraview 5.2.0 should be able to read/write such kind o files.

Just to understand the format of the xmf file, I've been trying to open a
very easy example taken from the post by Armin Wehrfritz (Tue Sep 27
09:03:00 EDT 2016) in this mailing list (the title of the post was
"Combination of polygonal-data and unstructured grid") named polyhedron.xmf
(that I put in attach to this post). But using Paraview 5.2.0 (Windows
64bit) binary, it gives segmentation fault immediately after the "Apply"
button click.

I've tried also to read the vtu version of the same geometry
(polyhedron.vtu taken from the same post of Armin and in attach) and to
save it from Paraview in xdmf3 file format. Once I try to re-read the xmf
generated file, the behaviour is the same and Paraview crashes.

Has anyone of you experience with xdmf polyhedral files in Paraview?

Thank you in advance for any suggestion

Alessandro De Maio

Dear Cory,

You were of right. The option was there - I needed to set the correct
path for the QT directory for all modules to show up. I ignored at the
beginning the QT error, and tried to see whether this plugin is
available to start with.

Solved.

Thanks!

P.S. Looking fwd. for having this feature shipped with the binaries.

Hi Adam,

The Slice Along PolyLine filter looks for a vtkPolyLine type cell.  But
there is no reason the algorithm itself can't work with a polygon (the
current implementation just doesn't look for one and may not handle it the
way you want if you pass a polyline that happens to have a first and last
point that are the same).  You would have to modify vtkPolyPlane to handle
a polygon input rather than assuming the first and last segments go off to
infinity (add an option for this).

If you want to color the inside, you have to get into how the algorithm
works a bit.  Internally I am using a vtkImplicitFunciton (vtkPolyPlane) to
compute the distance of each point in the dataset (or its projection into
the plane of the polyline) from the polyline.  Then I run a Contour filter
(vtkCutter), contouring where that filter's value is 0 and the output is
the slice along the polyline.  But if you directly applied the vtkPolyPlane
implicit function to your dataset and appended that as a data array rather
than contouring by it and throwing it away, you could get colors for
distance from the line.  You could then use the Calculator filter to scale
and color this however you wanted since the distance will be negative for
one side of the line.

HTH,
Shawn

I may mess with it some.
FYI, I did convert my polygon to a polyline, and got it to work.  But, if I have two polylines (actually two completely separate regions) the slice along polyline filter then connects them even though they should not be connected.  Perhaps this is just what you mentioned below about having the same first and last point?
I appreciate both the filter and the feedback below.

Thank you,

Hi Adam,
The Slice Along PolyLine filter looks for a vtkPolyLine type cell.  But there is no reason the algorithm itself can't work with a polygon (the current implementation just doesn't look for one and may not handle it the way you want if you pass a polyline that happens to have a first and last point that are the same).  You would have to modify vtkPolyPlane to handle a polygon input rather than assuming the first and last segments go off to infinity (add an option for this).
If you want to color the inside, you have to get into how the algorithm works a bit.  Internally I am using a vtkImplicitFunciton (vtkPolyPlane) to compute the distance of each point in the dataset (or its projection into the plane of the polyline) from the polyline.  Then I run a Contour filter (vtkCutter), contouring where that filter's value is 0 and the output is the slice along the polyline.  But if you directly applied the vtkPolyPlane implicit function to your dataset and appended that as a data array rather than contouring by it and throwing it away, you could get colors for distance from the line.  You could then use the Calculator filter to scale and color this however you wanted since the distance will be negative for one side of the line.
HTH,
Shawn

The problem I was having is that I was planning and trying  to use a polygon.  It seems that if you try to use that Slice Along Polyline, but select a polygon for the input, it crashes paraview (it should probably bring up an error, or only allow a polyline!).  I realized that it actually wants a polyline, and once I created one for my region, the filter does what I had been looking for.
But, that leads to another question?  If I want a whole region to be another color, is there a way to fill the output of SliceAlongPolyLine?  So, instead of just an outline, I can get the inside to also be a certain color?

Thanks for the help.

No, that another issue and was done intentionally.  When running ParaView
in client-server mode with multiple MPI server processes, it is possible
the input polyline could be spread across the servers.  So it gathers them
from all the processes and merges all the polylines into one long line
before executing the filter.  I don't think there is a good way (other than
running multiple Slice Along Polyline filters) to get two separate regions
to work.  Also, the math for the implicit function you have to write gets
more complicated with two regions.  The current vtkPolyPlane won't handle
it.

Shawn

Hi Alessandro,

I just tested the .xmf file on my Linux work-station using the ParaView
5.2 binaries from the Kitware webpage and everything works as expected.

Also, reading the .vtu file and saving the data as xdmf works correctly
on my machine.

I don't have a Windows PC and have never tested this functionality
anywhere else than under Linux. However, IIRC, the implementation of the
polyhedral cell support doesn't have any operating system specific code.
Just to note though, you need to use the Xdmf3 reader/writer in ParaView
for xdmf files with polyhedral cells.

Can you check that the .xmf file you generated from the .vtu file has
the same topology information as the original .xmf file?

Cheers,
Armin

Message-ID: <CAD6x9sPb9AUkTQWjQi2fpY-6krq5YcGRzU22riwDqakJtCiiCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to write a grid file that contains 3D mesh information as
well as separate blocks for each surface(defined by a unique marker), such
that a user could extract each individual surface from the data set?

For example, a 3D cube filled with an unstructured grid. A user could
extract one of the 6 surfaces of the cube based on picking a particular
block in a data set.

Thank you,

Hi,

do you know a way to duplicate a Layout, in GUI or python?
This would be useful when you want to have different Layouts with slightly different color bar settings, for example.

Kind regards

Hi Armin,
     thank you for your reply.
I've used both for reading and writing the Xdmf3 choose.
In attach you can find the output of the saving of the polyhedron.vtu
(saved.xmf and saved.h5) from the Windows machine.

I've tried also to repeat the procedure (reading of your xmf file) on a
Linux workstation and the behaviour is different: it seems that
randomically the crash happens again (once on about ten tries) and
sometimes it seems that the topology has a connectivity error (see the
image in attachment), while for the most of the times it seems to do the
right job.

I've tried also another case, a little bit heavier: a polyhedral mesh read
from the vtu in attach (cube.vtu) and saved with the Xdmf3 writer. Trying
to re-read the xmf version of this geometry always  produces a crash also
on the Linux machine.

 Thank again for your help.

Cheers

Alessandro

they look "like a movie"; 2D representation of a moving field. We are
however unable to visualize this using paraview but we really would like to.

Has any of you encountered this problem? Any suggestions will be very
appreciated.

Thank you very much.

My best, Mart?n

OK, I tested the "saved.xmf" file and I can open it on my Linux machine
without issues. Also, I compared the files generated on windows and
linux machines, and the topology data is the same for both of them. The
datatype in the h5 file is different (H5T_STD_I32LE for the file from
the Windows machine vs. H5T_STD_I64LE for the file from the Linux
machine). The end of line in the xmf file is different, but I don't
think either one of them should cause an issue.

As said, on my Linux machine it works consistently.

I can confirm that the xmf file produce from the cube.vtu (using the
Xdmf3 writer in ParaView 5.2) leads consistently to seg fault.
However, even though the .vtu file works correctly, I'm not entirely
sure if this is xmf specific problem. To be more precise, the
implementation of polyhedral cells requires the face polygons to be
planar (see http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Polyhedron_Support). The example
file you send has a whole lot of faces that are not planar.

I extracted a single cell with several non-planar faces from your
example and saved it as .xmf file (attached). I can read this particular
file without issues on my Linux machine, whereas the original data file
leads to a seg fault. One reason why the cube.vtu file works and the
respective .xmf doesn't, could be related to the different approaches
polyhedral cells are stored in vtu and xdmf files, but debugging this
would require quite a bit of work...

Maybe somebody else has an idea here.

Hi,

do you know a way to duplicate a Layout, in GUI or python?
This would be useful when you want to have different Layouts with slightly different color bar settings, for example.

You're right: the polyhedral cells of the cube.vtu example do not guarantee
the planarity of faces, but this is a typical case of a polyhedral mesh
automatically generated starting from a tetrahedral one (this example has
been built using the Ansys-Fluent converter) and I think it's quite a usual
situation.
But I'm not sure this could generate a segfault as the problem could be in
the algorythms applied by Paraview after the reading of the file that could
consider this hypothesis (as you remarked), while the VTK topological
description of a polyhedral cell doesn't seem to need it, and the reading
phase should only build the data structure compliant with VTK data
representation, as actually happens for vtu file format. But this is only
my opinion and of course it could be wrong as I don't have a deep knowledge
of all the involved procedures.
My idea is that the problem could be due to a memory error, as it's only
unfrequent with a small case (by the way the one cell mesh you attached can
be read also on the windows machine although with a randomic connectivity
error as the one I showed in the image attached to the previous message)
but very frequent with a quite bigger case as the cube.
Is it possible to use something like valgrind to check for memory errors in
Paraview ?

Hi Martin,

Unfortunately there is no reader for this format in VTK/ParaView.
Moreoever, VPL looks like a
vector graphics format and there is no such similar reader in VTK. However
it looks like
Madagascar can convert them to raster format (PNG, JPEG etc).

i) A way to go would be to develop a new C++ or Python reader for VPL that
wiil on the fly convert them to a
raster file and load them as a 2D image. As this is a animated file the
reader will have to
declare the number of frames in the animation as the number time steps of
the data and then
be able to provide the conversion of the frame requested by the pipeline.

ii) Simpler : if conversion cannot be performed on the fly or if you can
create a series of PNG/JPG files
from Madagascar, you can just load them as a time series with ParaView (all
files should be suffixed with the frame id (eg: frame0.png, frame1.png etc.)
then in the Open File dialog of ParaView just select "frame*.png" item.
Thus each file will be considered
as a timestep of the time serie.

Hope it is clear,
Best

Message-ID: <BN3PR14MB0882310746F06F3728E9D6E0CB8C0@BN3PR14MB0882.namprd14.prod.outlook.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to create and save a state that includes points with data labels using the Python interface. Past answers from Utkarsh and Menno Deij have been helpful in generating the data labels in the viewer either via a selection source or using servermanager.rendering.DataLabelRepresentation(), but neither approach successfully exports the labels. If I reload the state file, the labels have disappeared.

Is there a way to export a state including data labels using just Python? Do I need to do something to the labels so the exporter will "see" them?

Thanks,
Bing

Subject: [Paraview] Changes in grid spacing in ImageData time series not
 reflected in Paraview
Message-ID: <20161201000634.GO31784@riseup.net>

Hi all,

I have generated a time series of ImageData files (.vti), where the grid spacing 
changes over time.  If I load for example the first and last file separately 
into Paraview 5.2.0 for OSX, it correctly renders the two grids in differing 
sizes.  However, if I open the entire time series into Paraview the grid retains 
the spacing from the first file as I step through the time.

Am I using the wrong data/file type for the job, or is this a bug?

The files can be downloaded from here:
https://adamsgaard.dk/files/image-data-files.tar.gz [36.6 MB]

Let me know if you have any further questions, and thanks for any help.

Cheers, Anders
