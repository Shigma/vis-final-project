Subject: [Paraview] ellipsoids
Message-ID: <BANLkTikL49Gb=mrLL1aeT8iNG9HTKmeWSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a vtkImageData file, that
I want to visualize. Each point
on the grid is a 3x3 tensor (matrix).
-> for each point I have 3 eigenvalues,
that I would like to map to the radiuses
of an ellipsoid.

What filter should I apply,
or maybe it is under glyphs,
but I just can't find it.

Thank you,
uliana

Hi,
Try the Tensor glyph filter OR the superquadric Tensor Glyph filter. 
These are user-created plugins and can be found here:

paraview uses a geometry filter to display datasets - this filter extracts the visible surface of your data, hence you only see the points on the outer surface.

you can see the points themselves by using the point sprite renderer plugin, or use the cell centre filter with vertexcells enabled to see the centres of each cell (not the original edge points)

Also, how do i change it so that the volume is completely filled with 
points? In PV it seems that only the bounding box has been created, as 
can be seen by choosing:"Points" as the representation. I was looking 
for a 3-d grid to define my equations on.....

Subject: [Paraview] Extract Data on a time range
Message-ID: <067AE44E-0AE4-4DFA-8D24-13C8E6A59274@gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to ignore my X first data (transient time): currently, my data is vti slices. 
Until now, I create a new directory with the only needed slices... but I like scripting tasks, so...
The best will be to write a script to create new source without some time steps. A kind of time extract filter...Any idea of python function?

Best regards,

Stephane

Please keep discussions on the mailing list so everyone can contribute
and benefit.

Sorry I assumed git clone would obtain a particular branch from a url
directly, so my instructions were not detailed enough.
Try this command instead:
git clone --recursive -b vector-graphics-export

In case you prefer using ParaView 3.10.1 and not the development version, here's
a recipe to backport the patches (which are intended for the development version
after the Collaboration branch merge) to 3.10.1. (To avoid confusion w.r.t.
mail-induced line breaks the recipe as an attachment, not inline.)

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb : Adding interactive slice filter to
	pipeline

Hi Raj,

You are not getting the propers bounds when you directly access them like
that:

> reader.Bounds

In fact, if you validate each line that you wrote inside the JavaScript
console of your browser, you could have seen that Bounds was not part of the
reader proxy. Moreover, it goes against the idea that Proxy do not have
methods/fields but only properties that can be set/get based on their name.
So eventually, it could have been reader.getBounds(). Although, bounds is
not a property of the reader.
In order to get the right informations, you do need to do call a method on
ParaView:

> var dataInfo = pv.GetDataInformation({proxy:reader});

The returned value is not a proxy, it's just a data structure with all the
data informations of the given proxy. (Fields name, Time, scalar range,
bounds, memory consumption on the server...)

Then you can do :
> sr.setPlaceWidget(dataInfo.Bounds);

I do believe that you  look at the file ParaWebFunctions.js inside the PWApp
to get that close. If not, it could provide you some help on how to handle
some common actions.

Thanks,

Seb

Hello,

I frequently perform the procedure below, and would prefer to put it in
a python script. Can anyone give me a some assistance in doing this?

* read a vtu file
* apply the plot-over-line filter, specifying the start and end points,
and number of points
* write the result to a csv file.

Many thanks,

Have you tried using the Python trace functionality in ParaView? It
should help you generate such scripts using the actions you perform in
the GUI.

Three questions:

1) Does it build if you use -j 1?

2) Is the pvpythonmodule.h anywhere in your build tree?
cmake should create the file when you compile and put it at:
${YOUR_PV_BUILD}./Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable/pvpythonmodules.h

3) Are you building static libraries?
That file is for the special case of building paraview with python
without using dynamic linking, which takes some care to set up
correctly.

I would go about it like so:

1) read in a vtp file containing the list of points you want to probe
at (alternatively use a python programmable source to specify them or
read a csv file and apply table to points)
2) read in the data you want to probe within
3) apply the resample with data set filter, the "input" should be the
data you want to probe in, "source" should be the list of points
4) file save as csv
5) once you know how to do it via the GUI, turn on python trace and
record your actions as python script to translate

Hi,

I'm trying to make a custom selection toolbar with two buttons as a plugin.
I actually want to select a set of points belonging to the same edge or face
just using mouse control.
I have read the pqSelectionToolbar .cxx and .h but can't find the action's
code neither figure out where they are linker to the renderer.
could you explain it or tell me where I could find some explanations about
it?

Regards,
Papa

No, effectively it gives the same error... just much time later (around 70%)

No, unfortunately is not exactly there , it is in

./Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable/scratch_local/pro3dwe1/build/ba_builds/ParaView/3.10.1_qt_static1/bld/ParaView/build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable/pvpythonmodules.h

that is

${MY_PV_BUILD}./Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable/<absolute path of ${MY_PV_BUILD}>/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable/pvpythonmodules.h

Not that I' m aware of, but I can check... which cmake vars control it?  
do I have to search on CMakeCache?

Thanks a lot for the help

Ok, probably I found the problem:

the function used to build pvpythonmodules.h is
PYTHON_WRITE_MODULES_HEADER that is defined inside FindPythonLibs,cmake
it   is  present in two locations:  as a CMake standard modulefiles 
(${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules)
as well inside ${PARAVIEW_SOURCE}/VTK/CMake

the problem is that  these files differ for the way they interpret the 
filename parameter:
standard CMake (2.8.4) add this line
SET(_filename ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${_filename})
so that the input filename  get interpreted as a relative path to 
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} ...
while VTK files does not have the line, so it interpret the name as an 
absolute path.

I am effectively tampering with CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to use my version of 
FindPythonLibs that in turns call
${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules/FindPythonLibs.cmake (trying to force the 
exclusion of system wide searching)

I' ll now try to exclude this hack and see what happen....

Thanks again and sorry for the noise...

P.S.
the current cmake 2.8.4 implementation of PYTHON_WRITE_MODULES_HEADER  
interpreting the file as a relative to
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} seems to me a bit hard...
would not be better to interpret it as relative ONLY if it is effective 
relative (it absolut path differ from its path) and as basolute if it is 
absoulute?

Thanks Pat,

I have searched for information about the live-data feature, but I
found only two interesting links :
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView:Live_Data_Introduction and
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Animating_Live_Data
In my case, the generating data program is a car embedded platform
programming with C++/Qt. It contains a main program that manage many
processes. Each process can be launched to do a particular feature and
can communicate together with shared memories. For example, there is a
process that reads vehicle speed from car network (CAN bus) and saves
data into a shared memory. Another process uses this data to do some
treatments with other data. The car is equipped with others sensors as
radar, or lidar, or camera... and an process save data into the shared
memory.
The goal of my project is to create a process that read some data in
many defines shared memories and to send this data to Paraview so that
it displays for example a graph of speed changes and a representation
of the car environment thanks to the radar and other data that we can
choose before launching the process.
So the process must be available to launch Paraview, open a predefined
configuration and send in real time all data read into shared
memories.
For now, I have only played with Paraview thanks to some tutorials,
but each time, data comes from a fixed file.
First I would like develop a simple process that send the vehicle
speed (a float number) and displays the value in a graph view into
Paraview.
Where can I found Paraview sources that use live-data ? Is there an
example of program that interface with paraview library and send
live-data ?
Thank you in advance for your help.

Hello,

I would like to get the coordinates of one or more selected points (I 
think the button 'select points on' is the right tool for this) using a 
python script (or programmable filter).

Does anyone have an idea, how to do this?
Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <4DBF08CC.7000909@gmail.com>

hello,
Can you please tell me whether the libraries given here:
http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html
are still valid for compiling with PV? I tried to do just that, but i 
was getting error that libawscale.so was not found, but that library is 
not included in  file!
I had read that FFMPEG had changed its api, so does PV now accept the 
latest ffmpeg api? which api does PV 3.10 accept (version number of ffmpeg)?

Thank you

That version of FFMPEG doesn't make swscale. What you need to do is delete
all of the FFMPEG_ variables from cmake and then reconfigure. As the FFMPEG
detection logic code caches several decisions about whether the FFMPEG build
is an older FFMPEG (which you are trying to use) or a more modern version
with swscale. Otherwise use the latest version, that is what was used in the
ParaView 3.10 binaries.

Hi Raj,

Another thing. You should do that to set origin and normal.

var plan = sliceFilter.getSliceType();
plan.setOrigin(0,0,0);
plan.setNormal(1,0,0);

in fact the methods SetSliceOrigin/Normal are helper methods on python
objects and not properties. You can notice it because of the capital S in
the set. This must come from the python trace. If it was a property in
python it would have been written:

sliceFilter.SliceNormal = [1,0,0];

Hope this help you to understand how it is working underneath and how to
easily convert Python generated code into similar JavaScript one.

Subject: [Paraview] Using XDMF to extract data from multi-dimensional array
Message-ID: <7F3DC016-3B3A-40C7-A616-C4DE0034F47D@mcs.anl.gov>

Apologies for cross-posting, I'm hoping that someone from one of these two lists can help with my problem.

I have an hdf5 file which contains a number of Datasets, and I'm having trouble pulling out a subset of one of them.  An h5ls of the file looks something like this:

Var1	Dataset {64, 64, 64}
Var2	Dataset {1, 1, 100, 64, 64, 64}

I can successfully define a Grid for visualizing Var1 using:
<Grid Name="MyGrid">
<Topology  
	Typology Type="3DCORECTMESH" Dimensions="64 64 64" NumberOfElements="64 64 64">
</Topology>
<Geometry Type="ORIGIN_DXDYDZ">
	<DataItem Name="Origin" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">
		0 0 0
	</DataItem>
	<DataItem Name="Spacing" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">
		1 1 1
	</DataItem>
</Geometry>
<Attribute Active="1" Type="Scalar" Center="Node" Name="Var1">
	<DataItem DataType="Double"  Dimensions="64 64 64" Format="HDF">
		DataFile.hdf5:Var1
	</DataItem>
</Attribute>
</Grid>


For Var2, the last three dimensions (64, 64, 64) corresponds to a 3DCORECTMESH, similar to Var1.  So, in this example, I would have 100 of them (the first two dimensions of the array are 1, but in future cases they will not be.)  I have tried without success to define a HyperSlab or a SubSet that will allow me to extract one of those 64^3  volumes from this multidimensional array.  Has anyone here done something like this before?  I would have thought that this would be relatively straightforward, but I have not had any luck finding any examples that do quite the right thing.  I'm hoping that this is possible without reading the entire array from disk, as this won't be possible as the sizes increase.  

Any pointers or suggestions would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
joe.

Hi Raj,

Python trace provide mostly a state of your action which already give you
some hints on the properties involved and the values that you need.
Although, I agree that it doesn't do the whole work for you, but it's
definitely a good start. If you are really expecting to have an API for the
proxies you can give a look at the following pages that list all the filters
available with their properties. But once again, you should write your code
in an interactive manner inside the JavaScript console in order to validate
each peace of it.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Sources
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_filters

After that I agree that developing your own application on top of ParaView
do require some skills on the ParaView framework itself.

Regarding the PlaceWidget() question, this is based on VTK (as ParaView rely
on VTK). It allow the widget to stick to a given location based on bounds
that are used to draw the bounding box with the plane inside it.

Seb

PS: I've paste a simple code that do what you want I believe.

Message-ID: <C9E4A3C3.4D24%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I have not been following this mail thread, but it is possible that the
filter you are using is not requesting the appropriate layer of ghost
cells in its RequestInformation.  If ghost cells are not requested, D3
will not create them.

I might be a bit biased, but sometimes I really wonder why people are so
keen on the ffmpeg writer. It is a major PITA to build the correct
ffmpeg libraries since there are no official releases, the API is a fast
moving target and the patent status is dodgy at best.

Using the provided Ogg/Theora encoder works out of the box, produces
good quality animations, is in my experience faster and it is
patent-free and fully open source. Virtually every media player on any
Linux distro plays Ogg/Theora without further ado, and there are plugins
for QuickTime (Mac) and DirectShow (Windows) available from the Xiph
foundation (www.xiph.org). If you really want to have a AVI movie, you
then can still use any of the readily available ffmpeg binaries for
conversion.

My 2c...

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for your help, trace is really great. It makes automation of the
first two tasks trivial, however I am having trouble working out how to
write the plot over line data to a csv file (the trace functionality
doesn't generate anything for File>Save Data).

Any suggestions about how to write the PlotOverLine data to csv would be
great.

Thanks!
Jade


I hadn't tried traceTrace is excellent

Jade,

Here's the link to the Wiki about saving CSV files:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Exporting_CSV_Data

In short, the following script should do it:

>>> writer = CreateWriter(".../foo.csv", source)
>>> writer.FieldAssociation = "Points" # or "Cells"
>>> writer.UpdatePipeline()
>>> del writer

Hi Raj,

Normally there shouldn't be any difference except maybe for the
representation part that should be 'Surface' and not 'Volume'. But the best
thing to do is probably post your code here so I can see it so I can figure
out what might be wrong.

You could try calling the files file.01.csv, file.02.csv, etc and then see
if paraview recognises that as a series of files. That mighty work but if it
doesn't you will need to add it as a FileSeriesReader - search the mailing
list for how to do that.

I also tried running the same example on an sgi altix cluster: same 
result. Do i have to choose any specific options during the build to 
enable volume rendering to work correctly?

	pipeline
Message-ID: <520751.85400.qm@web161606.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi Sebastien
?? So I did make progress and am able to correctly show 
an interactive slice filter on a volume using all the advice you gave. 
Thank you for that. I'm attaching a screenshot and the only thing that's
 missing is the coloring by a lookup table. As you can see currently the
 lookup table has no effect. When I try to set the DisplayProperties of 
the slice proxy to specify the 'ColorArrayName', the browser complains 
:? "Error: uncaught exception: Could not locate array ImageFile in the 
input.". I'm not sure why it cannot find the array. The look up table is
 correct since I'm using it for doing volume rendering of the same 
dataset in a different piece of code.

So I commented the 'ColorArrayName' option out in the code for now.? The code looks is as shown below :


// Set the web service base URL
???
 var serverUrl = 
"<%=request.getScheme()%>://<%=request.getServerName()%>:<%=request.getServerPort()%>/PWService";
??? //
??? // Create a paraview proxy
??? //
??? var pv = new Paraview(serverUrl);
??? pv.createSession("Test ParaviewWeb", "Just testing", "default");


??? // Create pipeline
??? var f = 'test.vtk';
??? var reader1 = pv.OpenDataFile({filename : f});

??? var dataInfo = pv.GetDataInformation({proxy : reader1});

??? var view1 = pv.CreateIfNeededRenderView();

??? pv.Show({proxy : reader1});

??? // set origin in the middle of dataset
??? pv.ResetCamera();
??? //var activeView =
 pv.CreateIfNeededRenderView();
??? view1.setCenterOfRotation(view1.getCameraFocalPoint());

??? // instantiate a slice filter object
??? var slice = pv.Slice({Input : reader1, SliceType : 'Plane'});
??? var sliceType = slice.getSliceType();

??? var sliceWidget = pv.CreateBindedWidget({proxy : sliceType, view : view1});
??? sliceWidget.setPlaceWidget(dataInfo.Bounds);
??? sliceWidget.setEnabled(1);
??? sliceWidget.setVisibility(1);
??? sliceWidget.setNormal(0,0,1);
??? sliceWidget.setOrigin(view1.getCenterOfRotation());

???
 var lut1 = pv.GetLookupTableForArray({arrayname : 'ImageFile', 
num_components : 1, HSVWrap : 0, NanColor : [0.0, 0.66666666666666663, 
0.0], RGBPoints : [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 16564.27904630101, 1.0, 
0.035950255588616767, 0.0,
 19924.923666800998, 1.0, 0.035950255588616767, 0.0, 39728.909301543368,
 0.0, 0.66666666666666663, 0.0, 65294.000000000007, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 
ColorSpace : 'HSV'});

??? // Set display properties for the slice proxy
??? pv.SetDisplayProperties( {
??? ??? proxy : slice,
??? ??? view? : view1,
??? ??? Representation : 'Surface',
//??? ??? ColorArrayName : 'ImageFile',
??? ??? LookupTable : lut1
??? } );

??? pv.Hide({proxy : reader1});
??? var dataRep1 = pv.Show({proxy : slice});
??? pv.Render();

??? // Create and bind renderer
??? var renderer = new JavaScriptRenderer("rendererName", serverUrl);
???
 renderer.init(pv.sessionId, view1.__selfid__);
??? renderer.setSize('720','480');
??? renderer.bindToElementId("renderer-container-id");
??? renderer.start();

Hi Raj,
Normally there shouldn't be any difference except maybe for the representation part that should be 'Surface' and not 'Volume'. But the best thing to do is probably post your code here so I can see it so I can figure out what might be wrong.

Thanks Sebastien. I must have been very close because that's practically what I tried too. I just copy pasted your code into a file and it works great. I just had to change the normal to (1,0,0) but I can see the interactive slice widget and that makes me very happy :)


But then I tried to replace the source with a test volume file read by OpenDataFile() and though I can see the outline of the data, the Slice widget does not show any more. 

Do I need to do something different for volume data ?

Hi Raj,
Python trace provide mostly a state of your action which already give you some hints on the properties involved and the values that you need.
Although, I agree that it doesn't do the whole work for you, but it's definitely a good start. If you are really expecting to have an API for the proxies you can give a look at the following pages that list all the filters available with their properties. But once again, you should write your code in an interactive manner inside the JavaScript console in order to validate each peace of it.


http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Sourceshttp://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_filters


After that I agree that developing your own application on top of ParaView do require some skills on the ParaView framework itself.
Regarding the PlaceWidget() question, this is based on VTK (as ParaView rely on VTK). It allow the widget to stick to a given location based on bounds that are used to draw the bounding box with the plane inside it.


Seb
PS: I've paste a simple code that do what you want I believe.

?? Thanks once again for the prompt response. I realize I should not make assumptions about properties but the whole Javascript model makes it difficult to debug. This is my first Javascript experience and I'm guessing that is my biggest problem :)



Also there is an inherent problem with the Python trace in Paraview. In theory it sounds wonderful but when I use it from the UI, it seems to miss some important information which makes it feel
 like it cannot be trusted.? As a simple example, if I create a cone source and apply the slice filter to it and click the "Show Widget" check box on and off, the python trace I get is as follows? :

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

Cone2 = Cone()

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

Render()

Notice there is no record of the 'Show Widget' or 'Hide Widget' property being set.

Also translating this to Javascript shows a slice of a cone .. but there is no interaction plane to adjust the slicing .. like in Paraview. I guess this is where we are supposed to look at the source code to figure out what's missing .. which takes a lot of trial and error without documentation. I some cases I can't tell what the property is supposed to actually do.



I've been looking at the ParaviewWeb.js file for a while and it provides useful hints but no definite answers. For e.g I noticed from the file that I need to set the PlaceWidget property for the slice filter but I don't really know what it's supposed to do. When I set it, on one of my data sets I saw the interactive widget .. and then on another it disappeared. Very confusing.

Hi Raj,
Another thing. You should do that to set origin and normal.
var plan = sliceFilter.getSliceType();plan.setOrigin(0,0,0);
plan.setNormal(1,0,0);

in fact the methods SetSliceOrigin/Normal are helper methods on python objects and not properties. You can notice it because of the capital S in the set. This must come from the python trace. If it was a property in python it would have been written:



sliceFilter.SliceNormal = [1,0,0];
Hope this help you to understand how it is working underneath and how to easily convert Python generated code into similar JavaScript one.

Hi Raj,
You are not getting the propers bounds when you directly access them like that:



> reader.Bounds


In fact, if you validate each line that you wrote inside the JavaScript console of your browser, you could have seen that Bounds was not part of the reader proxy. Moreover, it goes against the idea that Proxy do not have methods/fields but only properties that can be set/get based on their name. So eventually, it could have been reader.getBounds(). Although, bounds is not a property of the reader.



In order to get the right informations, you do need to do call a method on ParaView:
> var dataInfo = pv.GetDataInformation({proxy:reader});
The returned value is not a proxy, it's just a data structure with all the data informations of the given proxy. (Fields name, Time, scalar range, bounds, memory consumption on the server...)




Then you can do :>?sr.setPlaceWidget(dataInfo.Bounds);
I do believe that you ?look at the file ParaWebFunctions.js inside the PWApp to get that close. If not, it could provide you some help on how to handle some common actions.




Thanks,
Seb

Hi
?? I am trying to add a simple slice filter to a ParaviewWeb client that users could use interact with a volume. The bundled PWApp application does this already and so I tried to go through the code and looked at some Python examples. I was able to get an interactive widget to render but it shows a blank slice. Also the bounds are not correct since the volume is 'flat' and what I see is a cube. 





Here's the code I'm using :

var reader = pv.OpenDataFile({filename : "test.vtk"});??? 
??? var view1 = pv.CreateIfNeededRenderView();
??? pv.Render();




??? 
??? var sliceFilter = pv.Slice({Input : reader});
??? sliceFilter.SetSliceNormal = [0,0,1]; // sliec along Z
???
 sliceFilter.SetSliceOrigin = [0,0,0];
??? sliceFilter.SetSliceType = 'Plane';
//??? sliceFilter.SetInputBounds = pv.GetDataInformation.Bounds;

??? var sr = pv.CreateBindedWidget({proxy : sliceFilter.getSliceType(), view : view1});




??? sr.setPlaceWidget(reader.Bounds);
??? sr.setEnabled(1);
??? sr.setVisibility(1);

??? var dataRep1 = pv.Show({proxy : sliceFilter});
??? 

??? pv.SetDisplayProperties( {
??? proxy : sliceFilter,




??? view? : view1,
??? Representation : 'Surface',
??? } );

I'm attaching a screenshot of what's rendered in my browser. I'm obviously not setting some property correctly .. I just can't tell which one.





Thanks in advance
Raj

Hi Raj,

do you have a server instance where I can interactively interact with your
use case ?
If so, can you send me the url so I can give a try to set the color mapping
correctly.
(You can do it in private and I will post the solution on the mailing list).

Thanks,

Seb

Hi Raj,

I managed to show the correct color by executing that:

sliceType.setNormal(0,0,1);
sliceType.setOrigin(view1.getCenterOfRotation());
pv.SetDisplayProperties( {proxy : slice, view  : view1, Representation :
'Surface', ColorArrayName : 'ImageFile'} );

In fact you shouldn't set any normal/origin on the widget, but instead set
them on the plan of the Slice filter.
The reason why you couldn't select the ColorArrayName was because the plane
was outside the bound of your dataset which was producing no output and
therefore no data array.

Great .. yes the colors show up correctly and though now the interactive widget has disappeared I think I'm going to work around it by having a UI slider which lets the users slice through the data in X, Y or Z..

Thanks once again for all the patience and help.

Hi Raj,?

pv.SetDisplayProperties( {proxy : slice, view ?: view1,?Representation : 'Surface',?ColorArrayName : 'ImageFile'} );

Hi Raj,

It's true that you will get a better precision with a slider. For that you
can use the JQuery library, it is lighter than Dojo.
Dojo is the one I used in two of our sample application.

Subject: [Paraview] vtk files with different time steps
Message-ID: <BANLkTini6iiX9vjQZFCgDt=zfNqWVKr2vg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I generate two sets of data files. One is called ?particles_%.vtk? and
the other is ?fluid_%.vti? where % stands for the time the files
represent. Time series of particles is [0, 30, 60, 90, ..., 15000 ]
and the time series of the fluid is [0, 300, 600, 900, ..., 15000 ].
So I take a picture of particles every 30 time step whereas I take a
picture of the fluid every 300 steps only. Is there any way to plot
the two file series together with synchronized timing? Now Paraview
assumes that the time 30 = 300, 60 = 600 etc. which is wrong...

Thank you for the help.

I tried using volume rendering for the following example. It did work,

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with 'interpolate scalars before mapping' in
	v3.10
Message-ID: <BANLkTin=v2R4NejL6FQwrPZLCaYgWucp_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm having some problems with porting my ParaView exporter plug-in to
v3.10, because ParaView started using vtkCompositeDataSet internally
instead of keeping components merged. The problem is in performing
transformation of scalars to texture using vtkScalarsToColorsPainter
class. Here is approximately my code (questions come after
pseudo-code):

for every actor in currently active renderer:
  for every component of composite data object (I retrieve
vtkDataObject* with vtkCompositeDataIterator::GetCurrentDataObject()
call)

    // prepare new actor which defines component
    dynamic cast vtkDataObject* data_object to vtkPolyData* poly_data;
    create new vtkPolyDataMapper* pdm;
    pdm->ShallowCopy(composite_mapper);
    pdm->SetInput(poly_data);
    allocate new actor and do actor->ShallowCopy(ptrActor) //
ptrActor) is selected actor from currently active renderer - line 1
    actor->SetMapper(pdm);

    // perform converting from scalars to texture
    ConvertScalarsToColors(actor);

Routine ConvertScalarsToColors(vtkActor*) is defined in following way:

L1 get actor's poly_data and mapper references,
L2 create s2c - instance of MyVtkScalarsToColorsPainter (derived from
vtkScalarsToColorsPainter for allowing setting its protected
attributes),
L3 initialize s2c parameters from mapper and poly_data
L4 if s2c->CanUseTextureMapForColoring(poly_data) returns true,
s2c->PrepareForRendering(), get texture and texture coordinates and
sets them to passed actor

Q1: First problem is in L3 when setting s2c parameters. Original
mapper has turned on InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping flag, but new one
doesn't have it. How to safely copy properties of
vtkCompositePolyDataMapper2 to vtkPolyDataMapper or I shouldn't do it?

Q2: Even if I override above problem by turning on manually
InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping, I get very bad texture on output. It
looks like scalars were not interpolated before mapping, sometimes
even more distorted..

The same code works with v3.8 perfectly. I also tried to apply
vtkCompositeDataGeometryFilter to composite data object and to apply
ConvertScalarsToColors() to result (even without creating new actor),
but without success. Strange thing is that when I try this with
manually created VTK scene (out of ParaView) it works perfectly and
texture looks great!

I would appreciate any help!

Best regards,
Nenad.

Subject: [Paraview] error:Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data
	available.
Message-ID: <4DC14CCC.9080503@gmail.com>

Greetings,
I loaded a scalar data (defined on a 3d grid) into paraview 3.10.1. When 
i try to change "Representation" to "Volume", i get the error:

Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data available.

But this can't be true since the "Information" tab shows that:

Statistics:
type:Image(Uniform Rectilinear Grid)
Number of Cells: 2048383
Number of Points: 2146689
Memory: 1.6e+02 MB
and the data arrays do show the 2 dataitems that i read in; a scalar 
data S and a tensor data Q

hmm..any ideas on why this is happening? Thanks in advance for the help.

Nenad,

I am not sure I understand where this code is being put. You say it's
an exporter? Meaning it exports to something like a vrml/x3d file? But
that doesn't seem right since you say you are using the
PolyDataMapper.

What is this plugin trying to achieve?

ParaView only supports volume rendering point data for 3D uniform grid
datasets. You can apply a cell-data-to-point-data filter and the then
volume render.

I am not sure what's the problem. I could easily volume render your
dataset (image attached). Are you running in parallel or using builtin
mode?

Subject: [Paraview] vtk files with different time steps
In-Reply-To: <BANLkTini6iiX9vjQZFCgDt=zfNqWVKr2vg@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C9E6AFB3.52A1%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I believe that the file series reader ignores the actual numbers that
distinguish files series and just assigns them sequential integers for
time (0, 1, 2, 3,...).  If you think ParaView should be using the indices
in the filenames for the time value (a reasonable request), then you
should add a suggestion to ParaView uservoice
(http://paraview.uservoice.com).

ParaView will synchronize the times correctly if the appropriate time
value is recorded in the files, but the basic VTK files do not store time
step.  You can create a .pvd file that provides time values for the time
series of .vti files.  I don't think it yet supports .vtk files, but if
you convert it to .vtp or .vtu it would work.

Alternatively, a quick a dirty way to just get things working is to use
the temporal shift scale filter to adjust the time series to match.  Scale
the particle time by 30 and the fluid time by 300.

Dear Utkarsh,

Thank You very much on Your answer.

Yes, my plug-in is exporter, which means I define it in class derived
from vtkExporter. It extracts all possible scene information from
vtkExporter::RenderWindow object (in both Qt-client and python-client
modes) and writes these data to very special format using proprietary
software. Because output format is a bit specific, I have to convert
scalar values to texture first and then to export the texture, I
cannot output interpolated scalars or colors.

Like in my pseudo-code, I first take currently active renderer (from
vtkExporter::RenderWindow) and collect geometry / topology /
other_info from it using my pseudo-code. After this step, I write
collected data to my format using other software without problems.
However, I have problems with transforming scalars to texture. Btw,
I'm sure collected data is fine, because I can preview it using other
software.. Also, it works perfect under v3.8.*.

Do You have any idea?

Thanks,
Nenad.

Subject: [Paraview] Single Reader to Multiple Views
Message-ID: <4DC1BD60.8060807@us.army.mil>

Is it possible to have a singe reader (reads in to a 
vtkMultiBlockDataSet) and have multiple views to display the data at the 
same time? For instance, Block 1 would have data for a sphere and Block 
2 would have data for a 2D chart representing some statistic. Once you 
read the data, it will load two separate views, one 3d view for the 
sphere and one 2d view for the chart.

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

I would think that it's possible but would take a bit of programming to work
properly.  If I were to try that I'd first look at the SLAC reader plugin as
that does something fairly similar.  Somebody else can probably give you
better direction but the SLAC reader is a decent start.

Hi All,

I have a reader that gets the information object from it's output and 
adds some keys for downstream filters to use. This recently stopped 
working with version 3.10. Can anyone shed some light on what might have 
caused the change in behavior in version 3.10? Was this a deliberate 
change?

Thanks

Hello,

I would like to add something in one of my python scripts to tell temporal statistic filter to not use all time steps... At the moment, I create a directory containing only interesting vti files (vti data set beyond transient time)... not very efficient!

Any Idea?

Hi,
If you want to change the representation of outline, you should
plug your source into a Outline filter: it will outputs a cube
representing the bounding box of your data. This cube is a
vtkPolyData for which you can change the representation as you
want (color, but also line width and opacity)

Burlen,

Keys are not propagated by pipeline by default. So your approach would
only work when there's no other filter between the reader and your
filters. With ParaView 3.10, vtkPVPostFilter get inserted always into
the pipeline after every algorithm. As a result your keys maybe
getting eaten up by the post-filter.

What keys are these?

I'm not sure of how you would do it currently, but here's what I'd do if I had to do it ...
(using c++) 

Have a look at TemporalShiftScale for an idea.
instead of changing the time values, delete all those before X, and those after Y, to give you your time range in the Time Requests. Now any filter operating with the new filter in place, will only see a subset of times available and the statistics filter will do what you want.
Load this new filter as a plugin and use it from python, setting the ranges appropriately.

It ought to be added to one of the temporal filters, (I have some changes that need to be committed so next time I look at this, I'll add a time range clamper function)

Hello,

I would like to add something in one of my python scripts to tell temporal statistic filter to not use all time steps... At the moment, I create a directory containing only interesting vti files (vti data set beyond transient time)... not very efficient!

Any Idea?

Thanks in advance,

Best,

Hi Andrey,

For 1), you need to pass pvserver a .pvx file on the command line.  You can
put the pvx filename at the very end of the pvserver command line.  The pvx
file should contain the hostname or IP address of each pvserver process.  So
if there will be two pvserver processess running on the machines
myserverhost0 and myserverhost1, then the pvx file would look like:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
  <Process Type="server">
    <Machine Name="myserverhost0" />
    <Machine Name="myserverhost1" />
  </Process>
</pvx>

When you have this pvx file, the pvserver to send these hostnames to the
coprocessor, this allows the coprocessor nodes to know which hosts they
should connect to.  You also need to make sure that your cpscript.py
contains the right hostname for the pvserver root process.  So the cpscript
would contain:

host = "myserverhost0"
port = 22222

Also, make sure you have the latest commits in the live-data branch on
github, because I added a fix related to this pvx file.


For 2), the coprocessor code can send any type of dataset to the pvserver,
so unstructured grid should be fine.  But, if you are doing a data
aggregation step on the coprocessor, then that code has only been
implemented for vtkPolyData.  For example, if you have 1000 simulation procs
and 10 pvserver procs, then the coprocessor will need to aggregate all the
data from 1000 procs to 10 simulation procs, then those 10 simulation procs
will send their data to the 10 pvserver procs.

I have new code that allows you to write your own custom aggregation
routine.  What does your unstructured grid look like?  If it is something
with homogeneous cell type, like all tetrahedron, then it will be really
easy to modify some example code I have to work for your data.  Also, I
added the ability to open multiple sockets on the pvserver process.  So if
each of the 10 pvserver procs open 20 sockets, then there will be 200
sockets available to the coprocessor, so then the data only needs to be
aggregated from 1000 to 200 procs before sending to pvserver.  This code has
not made it's way onto github, but I could add it today.  Let me know if you
would benefit from this.

Hi Utkarsh,

Yes, I had connected the reader or source directly to the filter with no 
other filters intervening.

I have used the keys for a number of things. In addition to passing meta 
data I also implemented dynamic load balancing in a couple of algorithms 
by passing vtkObjects. For example the demand loading strategy in our 
stream tracer expects to receive a reader object in the pipeline 
information. The reader object also implements a LRU block cache to 
reduce I/O footprint.

We've used a similar strategy to generate seed cell geometry on demand, 
where our volume source passes a cell generator object downstream in the 
pipeline information which the stream tracer uses to access any cell in 
any order (dynamic load balancing part) with a minimum communication and 
memory footprint. We did that because we  ran our of memory when both 
the source and the stream tracer had a copy of the seed geometry.

The use case I'm describing is the generation of topographic maps of the 
magnetosphere which in the 3D case requires 10's of millions of stream 
traces and the seed geometry is colored in the mapper output. Dynamic 
load balancing of the stream tracing provides a nice speed up.

The vtkPVPostFilter looks to add nice new features to extracting 
components form vectors and converting cell to point data and so on. I 
do see why PV can't copy keys from input to output blindly.  But, do you 
think vtkPVPostFilter could copy the information from input to output as 
well? It doesn't after all modify the existing arrays or geometry (if 
I'm reading it right it only adds arrays if they are requested).? Or is 
there another work around that would get our filters working again?

Thanks
Burlen

Folks,

Recently an issue was noticed by some of our users. Evidently, when
resizing ParaView client that is connected to a pvserver using OSMesa,
the server would hang if there were any text items (such as "Text"
source) in the view. I am trying to gauge if any other users have seem
similar issues.

Subject: [Paraview] 3D Glyph Representation Question
Message-ID: <4DC30947.4030806@us.army.mil>

I currently have a reader that creates a vtkMultiBlockDataSet with two 
blocks: one of which is a polydata consisting of vertices and lines. I 
see the data in a 3D plot as pixels and lines connecting them. To make 
it more visually appealing, I was looking into views and a saw that they 
basically just load representations.  I now am trying to create a new 
representation that replaces each of the vertices with a 3d glyph (lets 
just say a cube for simplicity). Would I be going about this the correct 
way if I were to derive a new representation from 
vtkGlyph3DRepresentation, then load that representation in my view? Are 
there any examples that show something similar to what I am trying to do?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

Hello everyone,

Perhaps I was a bit unclear in my previous messages. Here are more
details about the problem and test case.

I use ParaView v3.10.1 release sources, Visual Studio 2008 SP1, Python
2.7, OpenMPI 1.4.3 on Vista SP2. I compiled sources with standard
options (just turned on BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, MPI and Python). I derived
new class from vtkExporter, vtkMyExporter, and in
vtkMyExporter::WriteData() I call code specified down. The problem is
in QMessage line, which reports always 0, even when this flag is
turned on. Same is happening with most of other parameters.

I believe that learning how to decompose composite ptrActor into
several actors with vtkPolyDataMapper mapper and vtkPolyData data will
solve all other problems (which occur when generating texture from
scalars). At the moment, I'm interested only in actors which use
vtkCompositePolyDataMapper2 mappers. As input I use disk_out_ref.ex2
with selected H2 (or any other channel) for mapping colors. Does
anyone have any idea how this can be done? Btw, this worked perfectly
under ParaView v.3.8.1 and with RenderWindow created using VTK 5.4.2
(where I create vtkCompositePolyDataMapper2 and populate it manually).

Thank You very much for Your help!

Best regards,
Nenad.

--------------------

1) Get interactive renderer 'InteractiveRenderer' from
vtkMyExporter::RenderWindow
2) For every actor 'ptrActor' (3D actors only) in InteractiveRenderer do:

    vtkCompositeDataIterator* actor_iterator;
    vtkCompositePolyDataMapper2* composite_mapper = NULL;

    // get actor's mapper
    vtkMapper* mapper = ptrActor->GetMapper();
    if(mapper == NULL)

Hi!



I'm trying to build ParaView 3.8.0-RC2 on Windows XP. I'm using Visual C++ Express 9 (2008).

I've compiled Qt 4.6.2 with Visual C++ Express. 

Following the instructions on the "ParaView Build and Install"- page on the Wiki,

I get to actually build the code, but linking the target 'paraview' I get the error

error LNK2019: Undefined symbol "_WinMain at 16" in function "___tmainCRTStartup".

What can I do?

Thanks,
Natalie

Hi Brian,

it is possible that I made a similar thing before. If you please have a look 
at 

http://www.lnm.mw.tum.de/Members/ismail/red_d_fsi_models.jpeg

The lung geometry to the right actually only consists of line elements. The 3D 
feeling comes from the glyph filter, which  creates tubes over the 2D line 
elements. A programmable filter was used to calculate and provide the glyph 
filter with the radius and the orientation of the tubes. I can send you 
screenshots of the single steps taken and the programmable filter script to 
your  personal email (as I have no idea if the mailing list accepts file 
attachments).

Regards,
Andreas

Hi all,

Forgive my silly questions as a newby,

I am actually building  Paraview reader for a multiblock dataset.
There will be many blocks in the files I want to load and I am thinking
about offering the possibility to choose
the blocks that will be loaded.
Can I have something similar to cell/point ArrayStatus working for blocks?
Whick type should I use in the XML for a checkbox with the blocks' names in
the GUI so that I can retrieve the selected blocks
in RequestData?

I can not reproduce the problem with the development versions of
ParaView and Mesa on murron.

I will try again with ParaView-3.10.1 and Mesa-7.10.2 when I get
to work.

There is a similar discussion on the vtk-list:
<http://vtk.1045678.n5.nabble.com/QT-VKT-ITK-VS2008-td4343251.html>
and  especially:
<http://vtk.1045678.n5.nabble.com/QT-VKT-ITK-VS2008-td4343251.html#a4343497>

maybe this helps.

kind regards

Nenad,

There;s nothing much different about the vtkCompositePolyDataMapper or
vtkPolyDataMapper as far as the state of the
InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping flag goes. I cannot see how that
variable can return false if it is indeed set to true as you are
saying. Can you share the plugin?

This really seems to solve my problem if I would find the part in the CMakeList.txt where this reply points to:

In your CMakeLists.txt file you need the following set of commands to properly find Qt4 and set it up for use:


 # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   #  Qt 4 Section

   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   # by default only QtCore and QtGui modules are enabled

   # other modules must be enabled like this:  

   IF (WIN32)

       SET (QT_USE_QTMAIN TRUE)

   ENDIF (WIN32)


   # this command finds Qt4 libraries and sets all required variables

   # note that it's Qt4, not QT4 or qt4

   FIND_PACKAGE( Qt4 REQUIRED )

   # add some useful macros and variables

   # (QT_USE_FILE is a variable defined by FIND_PACKAGE( Qt4 ) that 

   # contains a path to CMake script)

   INCLUDE( ${QT_USE_FILE} )


# Set some Win32 Specific Settings

IF(WIN32)

 SET(GUI_TYPE WIN32)

ENDIF(WIN32)



add_executable (MyProgram ${GUI_TYPE}  ${SRCS})

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MyProgram ${QT_LIBRARIES})


Cheers

There are so many CMakeList.txt files in the source-code. I would have thought that somethin like this would be in the top CMakeList.txt (in ../ParaView-3.8.0-RC2) but in this file I do not find a call "Target_link_libraries" or "add_executable" - somewhere those calls must be?!

Thx,
Natalie

Hi Burlen,

There is support for this in the pipeline. In the appropriate pipeline pass
(REQUEST_INFORMATION, REQUEST_UPDATE_EXTENT ro
REQUEST_DATA), add the keys you want copied to the request object
(the first argument to ProcessRequest) under the KEYS_TO_COPY key.
This will tell the executive to propagate those keys all the way upstream
or downstream depending on the pass. See vtkExecutive::CopyDefaultInformation()
for the implementation if something is not working right.

Best,
-berk

I was not able to reproduce the problem using ParaView-3.10.1 and
Mesa-7.10.2.

What I understood so far is that all the information are put into the SIL
and sent throug the pipeline.
the question is how does the user modify the SIL?

Hi Grzegorz,

I've cc'd the main ParaView list as this thread does not relate to specific
ParaView development issues.  This also allows other people to participate.

For the adaptor stuff that you're probably interested in the 2011 tutorial
won't have much new compared to the 2010 tutorial.  If your code isn't
python based then the python part of the coprocessing tools are essentially
self-sufficient, unless someone wants to hand edit the python coprocessing
script.  The best way to move forward is by understanding the VTK data
structures used to represent the data structures in your code.  The VTK
User's Guide is probably the best place for learning that.

Hi,
I copied the code for vtkCellDerivatives.xml given here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Enabling_an_existing_VTK_filter
verbatim and loaded it into PV 3.10.1 through the plugin manager, but 
the filter does not appear on the filters->alphabetical tab.
Is there something else that I have to do to get the filter to appear?

There's already a filter named "CellDerivative" in paraview and hence
it doesnt' show up separately. Just rename the proxy as
"CellDerrivative2" or something and  you'll see it in the filters
list. I am going to update the wiki as well.

Dear Utkarsh,

I uploaded test plugin that shows my problem at
http://alas.matf.bg.ac.rs/~mr00053/projects/PVTest.zip.

After I build and load the plugin from Qt client, I load
disk_out_ref.ex2, select "H2" for mapping scalars, check Interpolate
Scalars on Display tab in Object inspector and go on File->Export
(select .my file). I get 6 message boxes which report 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
(instead of 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1) as values for
vtkMapper::InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping. So, here is first
question: "How to create multiple vtkActor objects from
vtkCompositePolyDataMapper2's input"? I thought that vtkMyExporter.cpp
Ln 138-162 should be fine, but uploaded sources shows different.

Thanks,
Nenad.

The plugin loaded on the client. But when i try to load it on the

Load error: path/to/file/vtkcellderivatives.xml :invalid ELF header

Message-ID: <20110509143331.527E.F353B791@bpe.es.osaka-u.ac.jp>

Dear Paraview developer,

I am trying to select surface cells of 3D object.
I am wondering why selected cell-id (label) is greater than
original cell(surface) labels (of cource using "Extract Surface" filter). 
Dose anyone show me how VTK labels such selected cells ?
How can I identify the triangle from such a label refering
a VTK file ?

Best regards,

Oka

Also, i compiled the plugin to create a shared library on both server 
and client (built seperately using respective builds).
However, is the cell derivates plugin supposed to work without any more 
code? I tried it on the "sphere " source on my client and it crashed. 
Also, i tried it on my data on the Cluster(which is definetly a scalar 
data defined on cells) and i think it crashed there too (got a message 
saying that server connection closed).
Do you have an idea why this may be behaving as such? In particular, 
does the plugin work on the sphere source on your build?

pratik

P.S: i think the name of the file should be "CellDerivatives.xml" (i.e 
without the "vtk-") for the CMakeLists that you have given in the tutorial

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Error .
Message-ID: <BANLkTik9hw3_PdQnsaD8_SHMHBpLvom+JQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,
I have installed paraview on ubuntu 10.04 and use it for post processing
OpenFOAM results . After todays ubuntu update I got the following error :
X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3
  Extension:    137 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 4 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x4a0026e

What might this indicate ? Can anyone help me to overcome this ??


Thanks .

That's not a filter. That is a python library you can use inside the python
programmable filter in Paraview.
Which version of Paraview are you using ?

Hi Bastien,

The live-data code is currently hosted on github.  The repository url is
git://github.com/patmarion/ParaView.git and the branch name is live-data.  I
think the live-data branch might be more than you need.  It is designed to
run in a client-server configuration with a parallel server (though the
parallel part is not required.)  When the live-data branch is eventually
merged with paraview master, I hope to update it so that does not require
client-server, but that work has not been done yet.  If you're willing to
run in client-server mode then the live-data branch will work for you.  The
first step it to try linking your project with the coprocessor library
(libvtkCoProcessor.so) and then try writing an adapter that converts your
data into a vtk data object.  Does your project use CMake?  If not, you will
have to write link and include lines yourself for your Makefile.

You don't have to load XML plugins on server side.

Hi all,

I have a structured grid and want to extract edges containing points with a
non-zero value
on one of the point arrays. Is there a way paraview filters can do this? or
do I have to build my
own filter?

Regards,

There was another bug in the XML, I've fixed it. Now it should not
crash on Sphere. However it won't generate any gradient either. Try
applying an Elevation filter to add some scalars to the dataset before
using the cell derrivatives filter.

Apply Extract Edges filter and then apply Threshold filter to remove
points that don't match your criteria.

up-to-date? Have you tried running any other OpenGL based application?

You can compile ParaView with OSMesa support and the use
--use-offscreen-rendering flag to launch pvpython/pvbatch.

To see how to build ParaView with OSMesa, refer to

You should use the last 3.10 binary version. Numpy is embedded in the
pvpython = python included in the binary release.
After that, check out the part of the manual user, available in the binary
package of the 3.10, talking about the programmable filter. (p.60)

Then you will write something like that in the programmable filter, after
having cut your cylinder with the plane (for a simple arithmetic averaging,
that certainly doesn't fit to your situation)

array
= inputs[0].PointData[NameOfYourPressureArray]

print numpy.mean(array)

Hi,

I'd like to add filters to the pipeline when RequestData() is called on my
reader so as to extract some parts of
 a structured grid (Faces and edges) and offer the possibility to toggle
their visibility with the pipeline browser.
How do I do this?

I have created a reader which makes a vtkMultiBlockDataSet containing a 
vtkPolyData. It reads in 100 some points and plots lines between them. 
After I read them in, I don't have the option to use any filters on the 
data. Any idea why this is disabled? Could it be related to the data 
having time steps?

Unstructured Grid, 1: NA
with Unstructed Grid selected Statistics shows:
Type: Unstructured Grid

My reader does have a custom accept. Could that be the issue?

"Custom accept"? What's that? And yes, if you are doing some funky
stuff to update the reader, it could explain why the GUI never
realizes that the reader has been updated.

Algorithms can have internal pipelines. The trick is that they have to
use a shallow copy to get the end results out of the internal pipline.
Otherwise the executives gets confused figuring out who depends on what.

See vtkSpherePuzzle for an example.

Subject: [Paraview] 2dcorectmesh with tensor data in ParaView
Message-ID: <4DC839BE.6070709@gmail.com>

I am trying to define a 256X256 grid with tensors defined at each point. 
Here is one part of the  code (one out of 50 same time steps):

<Grid Name="NemTensValues" GridType="Uniform">
<Time Value= "26" />
<Topology TopologyType="2DCoRectMesh" Dimensions = "256 256 9">
</Topology>
<Geometry GeometryType="ORIGIN_DXDY">
<DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions= "2" Format="XML">0.0 0.0 </DataItem>
<DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions= "2" Format="XML">0.1 0.1 </DataItem>
</Geometry>
<Attribute Name="S" Center="Node" AttributeType="Scalar" Precision="8">
<DataItem Format="HDF" Center="Node" NumberType="Float" Dimensions="256 
256" Precision="8">
                             a.h5:/S_00000026
</DataItem>
</Attribute>
<Attribute Name="sig" Center="Node"  AttributeType="Tensor" Precision="8">
<DataItem  Format="HDF" NumberType="Float" Dimensions="256 256 9" 
Precision="8">
                             Q.h5:/Q/Q_00000026
</DataItem>
</Attribute>
</Grid>

However, when i load the data, all i get is a blank screen,
Under the information tab, I seem Memory is 0MB but :
number of cells 520200
number of points 599058

What is wrong with my XDMF? I have tried this on 3d data with tensors 
and it works perfectly....

Has anybody seen this error using the downloaded PV 3.10.1 source code:

This is on OS X 10.6.7 with Xcode 3.2.6 on both Release and Debug builds. I also pulled the Git tag for 3.10.1 and got the same error. I am building some custom plugins but have not regressed through the code to figure out if that is the issue.

Are you targeting 10.5? This makes me think this is the reverse iterator
issue.

The custom accept is on a custom panel. The custom accept just makes 
sure the GUI selections are sent to the vtkobjects. When apply is 
pressed on the panel, the data gets updated and plotted on the 3d graph 
(Vertices will be updated based on time). Thus I believe the GUI is 
being updated as it should. I can press the play button and watch 
everything move as it should. However, I am never able to filter any of 
the data even if I select points.

It looks like the reverse iterator issue, I wonder if it is a caching
issue, as a compile test is done to determine if
reverse_const_iterator is usable. If you configure on 10.6, and then
change to 10.5 you might see this issue as the STL has changed and I
don't think CMake knows to invalidate that entry.

Yep, that was the issue. I would like to target 10.5 as I may have users on that system. I'll set a -D variable for the OSX_* for 10.5 the first time I Invoke cmake which should fix the problem for me. 
  Thanks for the sanity check.

The problem is pretty straight forward. Looks like
vtkMapper::ShallowCopy(..) does not copy the state of
InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping. I will commit a fix for that for next
release. Until then, you'll have to manually copy ivars that you care
about.

But you're saying the information tab doesn't show the data
information correctly, right? That implies that some essential
"notification" is missing. Hard to say which one without looking at
the code, however.

Everything in the information tab does look correct. (Sorry I forgot to 
mention that I switched from PolyData to UnstructuredGrid earlier). 
Basically everything works as it should, but I don't have the option to 
use the filters on the data.

With:

Type: Unstructured Grid
Num Cells: 159
Num Points: 159

I figured I would have at least a few filters. Or after I selected a few 
points some filters would show up.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb two sessions, two views, two volume datasets
Message-ID: <905107.44364.qm@web161602.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone
??? I would like to load two volume datasets (called FISH and SIMS in the code below) in ParaviewWeb and then render them side by side in two different views. The users should be able to 'lock' the camera amongst the two views so that moving the object in one window also affects the camera in the other. 

I tried the following piece of code but ran into a error which made me think maybe I don't understand the concept of sessions and Display properties well. Hoping somebody could help shed some light. There are two functions that I've copy pasted below. Most of the variables are global for now and shared between the functions.


// The init function loads and displays the two datasets 
this.init = function() {
??? ??? ??? // Set the web service base URL
??? ??? ??? var i;
??? ??? ??? var serverUrl = "<%=request.getScheme()%>://<%=request.getServerName()%>:<%=request.getServerPort()%>/PWService";
??? ??? ??? //
??? ??? ??? // Create paraview sessions .. one each for FISH and SIMS 
??? ??? ??? //
??? ??? ??? pv_FISH = new Paraview(serverUrl);
??? ??? ??? pv_FISH.createSession("CAVIAT-session-1", "FISH data", "default");
??? ??? ??? view_FISH = pv_FISH.CreateIfNeededRenderView();
??? ??? ??? pv_FISH.Render();

??? ??? ??? pv_SIMS = new Paraview(serverUrl);
??? ??? ??? pv_SIMS.createSession("CAVIAT-session-2", "SIMS data", "default");
??? ??? ??? view_SIMS = pv_SIMS.CreateIfNeededRenderView();
??? ??? ??? pv_SIMS.Render();
??? 
??? ??? ??? // Load the data files from disk
??? ??? ??? data_FISH = pv_FISH.OpenDataFile({filename : file_FISH});
??? ??? ??? data_SIMS = pv_FISH.OpenDataFile({filename : file_SIMS});
??? ??? ??? 
??? ??? ??? // For volume rendering set the display properties for each dataset loaded
??? ??? ??? 
??? ??? ??? this.setupVolumeView(data_FISH, view_FISH, pv_FISH);
??? ??? ??? this.setupVolumeView(data_SIMS, view_SIMS, pv_SIMS);
??? ??? ?? 
??? ??? ??? pv_FISH.Show({proxy : data_FISH});
??? ??? ??? pv_FISH.UpdatePipeline();

??? ??? ??? pv_SIMS.Show({proxy : data_SIMS});
??? ??? ??? pv_SIMS.UpdatePipeline();


??? ??? ??? // set origin in the middle of dataset
??? ??? ??? pv_FISH.ResetCamera();
??? ??? ??? view_FISH.setCenterOfRotation(view_FISH.getCameraFocalPoint());

??? ??? ??? pv_SIMS.ResetCamera();
??? ??? ??? view_SIMS.setCenterOfRotation(view_SIMS.getCameraFocalPoint());

??? ??? ??? // Create and bind renderers for both sessions
??? ??? ??? var renderer_FISH = new JavaScriptRenderer("rendererName", serverUrl);
??? ??? ??? renderer_FISH.init(pv_FISH.sessionId, view_FISH.__selfid__);
??? ??? ??? renderer_FISH.setSize('720','720');
??? ??? ??? renderer_FISH.bindToElementId("FISH-container");
??? ??? ??? renderer_FISH.start();

??? ??? ??? var renderer_SIMS = new JavaScriptRenderer("rendererName", serverUrl);
??? ??? ??? renderer_SIMS.init(pv_SIMS.sessionId, view_SIMS.__selfid__);
??? ??? ??? renderer_SIMS.setSize('720','720');
??? ??? ??? renderer_SIMS.bindToElementId("SIMS-container");
??? ??? ??? renderer_SIMS.start();

??? ??? }


????? // setupVolumeView will prepare the LUT and Scalar Opacity function needed for volume rendering
????? this.setupVolumeView = function (_data, _view, _pv) {

??? ??? ??? // *** Check to see is scope of lut and sof is valid for a per volume operation ***
??? ??? ??? var lut = _pv.GetLookupTableForArray({arrayname : "ImageFile", num_components : 1, HSVWrap : 0, NanColor : [0.0, 0.66666666666666663, 0.0], RGBPoints : [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 16564.27904630101, 1.0, 0.035950255588616767, 0.0, 19924.923666800998, 1.0, 0.035950255588616767, 0.0, 39728.909301543368, 0.0, 0.66666666666666663, 0.0, 65294.000000000007, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ColorSpace : 'HSV'});

??? ??? ??? var sof = _pv.CreatePiecewiseFunction( {Points:[0.0, 0.0, 2762.37, 0.0588235, 2882.47, 0, 6965.97, 0.235294, 15373.2, 0.323529, 25221.6, 0, 26662.9, 0, 36751.5, 0, 44318, 0.0, 52124.7, 0.323529, 63054, 0.294118, 65336, 0.294118] });


??? ??? ??? _pv.SetDisplayProperties( {
??? ??? ??? proxy : _data,
??? ??? ??? view? : _view,
??? ??? ??? SelectMapper : 'GPU',
??? ??? ??? Representation : 'Volume',
??? ??? ??? LookupTable : lut,
??? ??? ??? ColorArrayName : 'ImageFile',
??? ??? ??? ScalarOpacityFunction : sof
??? ??? ??? } );

?? } // end of setDisplayToVolume()



The error occurs when the code calls the following line inside the init() function.



this.setupVolumeView(data_SIMS, view_SIMS, pv_SIMS);

Inside the setupVolumeView() function, while calling SetDisplayProperties(), the code complains "Uncaught exception: Volume is not a valid volume." This does not happen for the first data but for the second one only. 


Thanks
Raj

Hi Michel,

I haven't tried it but it should be possible to run it headless on a Linux

Hi Raj,

first of all you only need one session. A session is basically a dedicated
connection to a ParaView server. So by creating 2 session, you were creating
2 server where you could have created 2 views in the same session and setup
a mechanism to keep both camera of the views in synch.
Moreover, as you are using the same session, you can reuse your objects such
as the LUT.
To keep object in synch, you will have to write some piece of code on the
server side that you could call from your javascript client.
I don't have a simple example in mind but you could look at the pwsimple.py
where I had some binding between the widget and the implicit functions that
it represent. Of course the event type won't be the same but the idea is
there.

In fact inside a Python plugin you should define a method like that:

def bindViews(view1, view2):
   # add some python code to bind the two camera together
   # or maybe set the active camera of view1 to be the active
   # camera of view 2.

I know that it does not give you the full answer but at least it give you
some hints.

Thanks,

I was trying to do it by telling the builder instance in the server to add
objects but
this ways seems cleaner.

Subject: [Paraview] a two in one filter
Message-ID: <BANLkTikZuENQ1ipLmNZ06eFLjCKChhG90Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a structured DataSet and want to extract some edges according to
a given value on a point DataArray. But I want only one element added to the

pipeline browser. I think about making a filter subclassing vtkExtractEdges
and
adding a vtkTreshold attribute.
Is there a cleaner way to do it?

Subject: [Paraview] Slice Offset
Message-ID: <BANLkTimvDTRc4=vorMrwih8gKJNThZcCnA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Here is the description of a bug I would like to know if it is repeatable :

Creating a plane by using the slice tool, I set then one or several offset
values in order to see parallel planes.
After that, when deleting the offset values, keeping only the zero one, and
clicking on "Apply" in order to see only the main plane, the others parallel
planes are not deleted.

Thanks for answer,
Regards,

A.Marsan

Dear Sebastien,

hello, now I'm trying to build ParaViewWeb server on Windows.
Your colleague could built it smoothly... but now I am in a mess.

I am ashamed my poor skill. And I need your support.

I read website "http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Building" and FAQ,
but the description is only for UNIX. So I wonder if I shoud install Cygwin
or install Windows utilities individually. ( For example "nmake" )

So it is very helpful for me to know more detailed building procedure for Windows.
And as you wrote, now getting activemq-cpp 3.1.0. is very difficult...
Please let me know how to get/build activemq-cpp 3.1.0.

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Dear Utkarsh,

Thank You very much, but unfortunately, adding manually copying of
parameters didn't solve all problems. I updated test plug-in with
manually copying, converting scalars to texture, applying texture to
actor and showing resulting actor in vtkRenderWindow. You can find
updated sources at
http://alas.matf.bg.ac.rs/~mr00053/projects/PVTest.zip.

If You load again disk_out_ref.ex2, select H2 and try to export to
.my, You'll see in separate vtkRenderWindow same object with applied
generated
texture which looks very bad. Again, it works fine in v3.8.1. I
believe I'm not initializing new actors properly? Do You have some
idea how to fix it?

Thanks,
Nenad.

Hi Katsumi,

as I said previously, ParaViewWeb should work on Windows but it's a
non-tested platform. Which means we can't really help you with that.
So if you don't have any skills in building such system on Windows,
you should definitely try to get a Linux or a Mac. That's exactly what
happen with Luca who finally managed to setup a server on Linux.

Wonderful,

You definitely getting there. BTW, what do you mean by a "weird clipping
between refresh" ?

Subject: [Paraview] XML-only Plugins
Message-ID: <BANLkTiky29pBut4zMASpaChYQLTKaae8zQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I noticed that the bug http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10835 has been
updated and fixed. As I wanted to confirm the resolution on my machine, I
tried to load some XML plugins and received the following message :

 ERROR: In
> /home/euHeart/Codes/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx,
> line 184
>
> vtkPVPluginLoader (0x26b01b0):
> /home/euHeart/Codes/Peavip/Plugins/Filters/ImageCast.xml: invalid ELF header
>

The wiki has a section entitled "Invalid ELF header" but it is empty.

The plugin is successfully loaded when using a compilation step. Please find
attached an XML that triggers the error (it simply exposes vtkImageCast
filter to paraview). Maybe some things has changed in PV-3.10.x and my XML
is not ParaView compliant anymore ? In this case, why the compiled plugin
does work ??? I encoutnered this error with PV-3.10.1 and pv 3.11.1

Thanks a lot !

Jerome

Jerome,

I committed that fix last evening to git-master. Make sure you have
updated and built your paraview. I loaded your XML and it works fine
for me after yesterday's commits.

Try selecting something else in the pipeline browser and then select
the filter again. Does that seem to update the menus correctly?

Can you post your xml description for the reader? There may be
something wrong in there.

Yes, by selecting a different source, the filter menu is enabled. When I 
go back to my reader the filters are again disabled. So I feel like 
something is not being set correctly when I press accept().  Or maybe it 
has something to do with the fact that the data hierarchy is Multi-block 
Dataset -> Unstructured Grid?

My accept looks as such:

[code]
void
MyReaderPanel::accept()
{
    vtkSMStringVectorProperty* lb = 
dynamic_cast<vtkSMStringVectorProperty*>(
        this->proxy()->GetProperty("lbSelection"));

    lb->SetNumberOfElements(this->widgets.lbSelection->count()*2);
    for(int i = 1; i < this->widgets.lbSelection->count()+1; i++)
    {
        lb->SetElement(2*i-2, 
this->widgets.lbSelection->item(i-1)->text().toStdString().c_str());

        if(this->widgets.lbSelection->item(i-1)->checkState() == 
Qt::Checked)
        {
            lb->SetElement(2*i-1, "1");
        }
        else
        {
            lb->SetElement(2*i-1, "0");
        }
    }

    this->proxy()->UpdateProperty("lbSelection", 1);
    vtkSMStringVectorProperty* lb2 = 
dynamic_cast<vtkSMStringVectorProperty*>(
        this->proxy()->GetProperty("lbSelection"));
}
[/code]

Hi Luca,

I've cc the ParaView mailing list (as you should do) so other could
benefit from your experience as well.

Which version of ParaView are you using ? If it's the release one, you
should follow the instruction that I've posted on the ParaView mailing
list to checkout the correct corresponding tag.

FYI, here is the mail:

====
Hi Folks,

I've just push today some fix to the ParaViewWeb repository to support
the latest ParaView git/master.

But for the users of ParaViewWeb that want to use the latest ParaView
release (3.10.1) instead, you should checkout the tag "pv-3.10.1" in
the ParaViewWeb repository.
In order to do that, you can simply type the following command line
inside the ParaViewWeb directory: "git checkout pv-3.10.1 -b
pv-release".

For those who are just starting to here about ParaViewWeb and want to
know more, they can give a look at the Wiki documentation here:
- http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb

And if you have questions or issue to report, use the paraview mailing list.

Hi Luca,

You might not have set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly. So when the
application start, it does not find the so file and the same will
happen for ParaView ones as soon as you fix that error.

Subject: [Paraview]  D3 with custom cuts
Message-ID: <CBBB81512D1FE445823400465FCCFFF2010B832D@sluga.fer.hr>

I am trying to implement an idea based on D3 filter
but with customized decomposition of data.
I'm prototyping the idea with Python script (ProgrammableFilter).

I found that I can set my own cuts on D3 with
D3Object->SetCuts(cuts)
but I am having problem setting the cuts object.

vtkBSPCuts class reference shows there are two functions to create cuts:

1) void CreateCuts (double *bounds, int ncuts, int *dim, double *coord, int *lower, int *upper, double *lowerDataCoord, double *upperDataCoord, int *npoints)

and

2) void CreateCuts (vtkKdNode *kd)


I'm using the first function (with some random values):
cuts.CreateCuts([-5.75, 5.75,-5.75, 5.75,-5.75, 5.75],2,[0, 1],[5.0, 10.0],[0, 1],[5, 10],[1.0,2.0],[1.0,2.0],[1,2])

but Python shell keeps giving me the same error:
"TypeError: CreateCuts() takes exactly 1 argument (9 given)"

?? Why? 
Can't I use CreateCuts with 9 arguments?

Dear Sebastien,

hello, thank you for reply. I understand the situation. We will try to build on Linux or
(if possible) Windows.

But anyway threre is one problem. I installed Cygwin and try to get source file
and makefile and other resources, but our company proxy server does not open
git-protocol port, so I couldn't get them. And it might impossible to open this port.

So... if possible, could you send me these resources as attachments? 
And if it is difficult, it is very helpful to let me know any download sites...

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Hi Katsumi,

If you can get a Linux machine, it will be way simpler.
On the other hand, for git you can use the http url which use the
standard http protocol to communicate. So you shouldn't get any issue
with your proxy.

Hi Stephen,

The FX580 is considered to be a entry level quadro card. I would review the
quadro comparison chart at
http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/product-comparison/product-comparison-master-revised.pdf.
A quick scan leads me to believe the Quadro 2000 is a good starting card.

hello everybody!
      I am in the trouble of adding a volume plugin. I add a new mapper to

Subject: [Paraview] error with python state file
Message-ID: <4DCAE63F.2020701@gmx.de>

Hello,

I am trying to adjust the filename of the python state file when using 
the openfoam reader.


I adjusted the FileName entry to read the declared FILE:

FILE="/home/gcae504/HOME/scr/ceplx049/scr2/gcae504/Dissertation/3D_Nielsen/OpenFoam/01_SAS_SSTF_URANS/01__56T_SST_1.7/.foam"



a_foam = OpenFOAMReader( guiName=".foam", Decomposepolyhedra=1, 
CaseType='Decomposed Case', MeshRegions=['internalMesh'], 
Createcelltopointfiltereddata=1, Cachemesh=1, FileName=FILE, 
LagrangianArrays=[], CellArrays=['k', 'nut', 'omega', 'p', 'U'], 
LagrangianpositionsareinOF13binaryformat=0, PointArrays=[], Readzones=0, 
Adddimensionalunitstoarraynames=0, ListtimestepsaccordingtocontrolDict=0 )

This works so fine well, but as soon as I set it to a different path like:

FILE="/home/gcae504/HOME/scr/ceplx049/scr2/gcae504/Dissertation/3D_Nielsen/OpenFoam/01_SAS_SSTF_URANS/01__56T_SST_HRV0/Hrv.foam"

I get this error message:


[ceplx049] 01__56T_SST_1.7 > pvpython plot.py
vtkPOpenFOAMReader : [ ...........]
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "plot.py", line 186, in <module>

   File

     "to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute ScalarOpacityUnitDistance does not exist. 
This class does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes 
due to typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.

I get the 'same' error message with a script which executes the python 
state file and resets the FileName (the FileName is set using sys.argv), 
when I do not define the complete path....

Does anyone know, what I am doing wrong!?

Best Regards!
Fabian

Hi Fabian,

Does the answer provided in the last paragraph of this email help?

    http://markmail.org/message/sq7dafegnrh7exth


Could you let me know, for each .foam file, what data types the multiblock
dataset contains?  Are the blocks unstructured grid, polydata, other?  You
should be able to avoid the problem by commenting line 186 in your plot.py
file, where ScalarOpacityUnitDistance is assigned.

Hi Pat,

Thank you. In order to answer to your question, my project use CMake.
For now, I have installed git and download paraview sources. I have changed to branch live-data, and I am doing a git submodule update (I am seeing it is downloading vtk sources)
Next I have to configure cmake, which option must be activated for my case ? After, I will do a make in order to compile paraview...
And after ? How can I test paraview with live data ?
What have I to do with libvtkCoProcessor.so library ? My project use system of shared memories. Is it possible to create a function into the coprocessor library so that the function read a shared memory and update paraview view ?
Have you an example, because the work I have to do isn't very clear !
Thank you !

> The live-data code is currently hosted on github.  The repository url is git://github.com/patmarion/ParaView.git and the branch name is live-data.  I think the live-data branch might be more than you need.  It is designed to run in a client-server configuration with a parallel server (though the parallel part is not required.)  When the live-data branch is eventually merged with paraview master, I hope to update it so that does not require client-server, but that work has not been done yet.  If you're willing to run in client-server mode then the live-data branch will work for you.  The first step it to try linking your project with the coprocessor library (libvtkCoProcessor.so) and then try writing an adapter that converts your data into a vtk data object.  Does your project use CMake?  If not, you will have to write link and include lines yourself for your Makefile.

This was obviously a similar problem, but now it is not the trace, but 
the state file in 3.10.1.

Both .foam files are bascically the same geometry calculated with just a 
different equation solver... so the structure should be quite similar.
Just commenting outhe the line 186 gives same error for other variables:

[ceplx049] 01__56T_SST_1.7 > pvpython plot.py

Subject: [Paraview] error with python state file
In-Reply-To: <4DCAF153.9060104@gmx.de>

Message-ID: <BANLkTinNYHo4KmMG+njyx4DRdnEkg-JRQw@mail.gmail.com>

The problem in general is-  the script calls Show() and depending on the
dataset, paraview creates either a "GeometryRepresentation" or a
"UnstructuredGridRepresentation".  The script expects one type of display to
be created, but when it is executed with a different dataset (or possibly
the same dataset but different blocks toggled) a different type of display
is created.  The different display types have different properties.  The
script tries to set properties on the display that do not exist and fails.

I think it would be worth making a bug report for this and maybe we can come
up with a solution to avoid this in future versions of paraview.

In order to resolve some vtk commits, you'll probably have to cd to ParaView
and enter these commands:

cd VTK
git remote add github git://github.com/patmarion/VTK.git
git fetch github
cd ..
git submodule update


Honestly, you might want to investigate a simpler solution than the
coprocessor.  You could write a paraview plugin with a custom qt panel and
put a routine that reads from shared memory into the qt panel.  When
paraview is run in builtin mode (not client-server), the qt panel can
directly access vtk filters.  So the panel could use a QTimer to update the
vtk filter.  The coprocessor is powerful but is oriented toward parallel
simulations, it might be more than you need.  To learn more about the
coprocessor you should read:

  http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CoProcessing

And for a c++ example, including the CMake code you'll need to interface
your project with the coprocessor, see:

  http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_example

Subject: [Paraview] isovolume filter robust?
Message-ID: <4DCBAE29.8030606@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I wanted to view my 3d scalar data using a volume rendering. If i just 
load the data and use the volume representation option, the view i get 
is too crowded with data to be useful. Which is why i tried ot use the 
IsoVolume option. It worked alright when representation was surface, but 
changing representation to 'volume' causes paraview to hang. I am using 
PV3.10 in client server mode, pvserver was running on 32cpu cores(SGI 
Altix system).

You may want to play with the color table and change the transfer
function to reduce the "crowding". IsoVolume will covert your image
data to unstructured grid which takes up more memory in general.

Subject: [Paraview] Using implicit plane widget in a plugin,

Message-ID: <BANLkTikg_ps30MgPsRK8ihNss4xjzQzPfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would need to include an implicit plane widget as an input to my plugin,
and I have googled for it (or for any other widget), and I have found almost
no info. I've been reading the paraview source code for hours, but these
built in filters XMLs and code are really different from what I usually do
in my plugin XML. Is there any place where I can find this information? Do
you have a simple plugin XML that includes a 3d widget?

I would really appreciate any hint about this.

Thanks in advance,

Federico

Hi,
Have  you tried exposing the clip filter through your xml? The 
severmanager XML for the clip  can be found in 
/path-to-paraview/Severs/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml.

Thanks Pratik. I've been exploring the filters.xml before writing to the
list. The thing is that I don't know where to find the complete
syntax/semantics of the plugins XMLs, so, actually, I know how to show combo
boxes, vector properties, etc, but I don't know how to include a
ProxyProperty in my plugin. Do you know where can I find a good reference on
the web?

Thanks a lot,

Federico

Hi,
Detailed information about servermanager XML is available in the 
"Paraview Guide" (and not anywhere else, apparently :( ). However, a 
nice presentation:

So, 

I have followed your instructions. But during compilation, an error occurred at 85% of compiling, It was a problem with Qt, a file was truncated...
So, I run ccmake and disable qt compiling option. Now, I launch make and I am waiting the end of compilation.
Is it the good solution I choose ?
When compilation will be terminated, how can use a basic plugin ?
In a first time, I would like to be able to display for example a new point each second in paraview...
Where can I found an example that change data every seconds....

You could write a paraview plugin with a custom qt panel and put a routine that reads from shared memory into the qt panel.  When paraview is run in builtin mode (not client-server), the qt panel can directly access vtk filters.  So the panel could use a QTimer to update the vtk filter.  The coprocessor is powerful but is oriented toward parallel simulations, it might be more than you need.  To learn more about the coprocessor you should read:

I think the live-data branch might be more than you need.  It is designed to run in a client-server configuration with a parallel server (though the parallel part is not required.)  When the live-data branch is eventually merged with paraview master, I hope to update it so that does not require client-server, but that work has not been done yet.  If you're willing to run in client-server mode then the live-data branch will work for you.  The first step it to try linking your project with the coprocessor library (libvtkCoProcessor.so) and then try writing an adapter that converts your data into a vtk data object.  Does your project use CMake?  If not, you will have to write link and include lines yourself for your Makefile.

Hi Bastien,

You'll want to learn how to write a vtk filter that outputs a vtkPointSet.
There are two ways, a python programmable filter, or a c++ filter.
Ultimately I think you want to write your own vtk filter in c++ and a custom
panel in qt/c++.

See these examples:

ParaView/Examples/Plugins/Filter
ParaView/Examples/Plugins/GUIObjectPanel

And read the Plugins paraview wiki page, and the Python Programmable Filter
wiki page.

To get access to your vtk filter from the qt panel, you just need to do:

pxy->getProxy()->GetClientSideObject();

I have a reader plugin that has a group of VTK_LINES that exist between 
points. The color of these lines represent statistical data at a 
specific time. Sometimes there is no data for the line, thus the scalar 
= 0. When this occurs, I would like to hide the line from sight. Is 
there a way to do this, or will I need to add and remove the cell for 
each time step?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

Hi,

You should be able to apply a threshold filter on the dataset set to only
show scalar values greater than 0.

Hi
?? I would like to provide the ParaviewWeb session users to be able to view their data along the major axes at any point. I looked at the view properties and there were member functions for setCameraViewUp() and setCameraPosition() but I was not able to orient the camera correctly. Am I missing any other function .. maybe for the camera itself ?

Thanks

Hello,

one idea I have right now is to use the PointSource...
than one could read the center information. Unfortunately, it seems, 
that the key "P" does not allow any snappy to the next cell point, which 
makes it a bit fuzzy!?

Hi, there,
Just wanted to follow up to see if there was any progress on this?  It seems stalled for the last month.  I appreciate the attention you have put on it.  I'm hoping to resolve this for our user.

Hi Rich,

The 3.10.1 version was being tested internally while I was fixing the mili reader. You should expect the next release of ParaView to have the fixes for the mili reader.

I have no problem with you submitting a bug about the Mili reader, so that you can track my progress on the issue.

ParaView 3.10.1 is now available for download on the ParaView download page.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Release Notes:

ParaView 3.10.1

ParaView 3.10.1 is a patch release to address a few issues detected in 3.10.0.

ParaView Binaries:
* Fixed crash on 32 bit Windows when opening CGNS files.
* Resolved crash issue when opening Xdmf files on 64 bit Windows.
* Fixed an issue where playing an animation would cause an increase in memory.
* Corrected a performance slowdown when parsing python array calculator expressions.

Development:
* Removed install rule for ParaViewLibraryDepends as it is no longer is being generated.
* Corrected Install rule for vtkPVApplicationComponents that was not exporting correctly causing link errors when compiling the SpreadSheet example on Fedora.
* Removed duplicate vtkVector class that was in ParaView but not used.
* Added exclusions to the wrapping parser that would inadvertently attempt to wrap gl.h which would subsequently cause builds to hang on some systems.

For an exhaustive list of the new features and bug-fixes, please refer to the change log at: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php?version_id=82

As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better. Please use http://paraview.uservoice.com<http://paraview.uservoice.com/> or click on the "Tell us what you think" link on paraview.org<http://paraview.org/> to leave your feedback and vote for new features.

Hi Raj,

if you create a 2D view instead of a 3D one, you'll get exactly what you
want.
But, since it's a hidden API from the JavaScript, you'll need to make a
python plugin to enable that API

You need to call: paraview.simple._create_view("2DRenderView")

them, you just need to play with some display properties.

DataRepresentation5 = GetDisplayProperties(Wavelet1)

DataRepresentation5.SliceMode = 'XY Plane'

DataRepresentation5.Slice = 10


You can look in the wiki some sample code that was used for the manta
plugin.

Subject: [Paraview] case sensitivity, vtk legacy file formats
Message-ID: <col110-w4C561D71CD10341E017E8958A0@phx.gbl>



I was trying to load a file with VTK Legacy Formats, and I found that

dataset unstructured_grid

doesn't work, but

DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID

works.

According to 'VTK File Formats', the keywords are case insensitive, so this could be a potential bug.

Thanks,

Shin

Subject: [Paraview] Viewing a simulation as it evolves
Message-ID: <COL117-W384F3768E9D822C2C0FBD0A68A0@phx.gbl>


Hi 

I am using Paraview to view the results of my CFD simulations and would like to view the simulation as it evolves but without having to reload images from earlier in the simulation. At the moment I create a vtk file every 1000 iterations and transfer it from the remote computer where the file is created onto my laptop. But if I have for example 10 vtk files from the simulation already in Paraview and copy the 11th and 12th files that have just been created from the simulation to the same directory containing the 10 files is there anyway I can simply add those files to the animation without having to watch the 10 files again?

Hello,

I think you could use the ExtractSelection tool, and then look at the
coordinates of the points on the display tab.
Or print them using the programmable filter.

thanks for your hint. Do you have an idea, how I can access the 
information of the ExtractSelection tool using the programmable filter?

Subject: [Paraview] Segmentation Fault with vkt Unstructured Data file
Message-ID: <BANLkTik5eRO8To0yu92N23F9kob3Y9aJdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I wrote a program to translate a Gmsh mesh into a vtkUnstructuredGrid.  The
translation is successful and the resulting ASCII vtk file matches the vtk
file-formats.pdf.

However, when I try to open it in ParaView I get a segmentation fault.

I have posted the original Gmsh file at http://ubuntuone.com/p/tlB/
and the resulting vtk file at http://ubuntuone.com/p/tlA/

Can anybody else open this file?  If not, what could be the problem?

Regards,
Seth

Seth,

Try using point numbers to build up your cells starting from 0, not 1.
That should do the trick.

Hi,

Did anyone try to use pyqt in a macro (to get some input from the user)?
I can't make anything working with signal and slots, it seems to mess with 
the python threads.
I can understand that it may not be possible to use non modal dialogs 
because the paraview gui in single-threaded, but even modal dialogs freeze 
if I use signals.

Any hint or recommendation?

Best,
Stephane

I have done it in past. Attached is a python script. The key is to avoid
using anything but direct SMproxies or SMproperties, never their python
wrapped counter parts.
(Note you may not be able to use the script directly since it expects a
certain kind of state file loaded, but should serve as an example
nonetheless)

Subject: [Paraview] How to repeat a 1 deg segment to produce larger angles
Message-ID: <BANLkTikwyJX0Z8m6m0XtU68QphY9hvQfFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am doing an axial symmetrical model by rotating a 2D geometry along
the circumferential direction by only 1 degree. This is sufficient for
the modelling; however I expect to represent the modelling results in
ParaView with 10 to 20 degrees, which would be larger and better for
3D presentations. I am wondering how I can repeat the 1 deg only
result periodically to produce a 3D view with at least 10 degrees.

Thanks a lot for your advices in advance.

Best regards,

Hi Stephane,

Have you seen this email before?

http://paraview.markmail.org/message/6h767kpak5dcoqwt

Are you using a paraview release or building from source?  If you're
building from source I can send you a patch that will fix the multiple
interpreter issue for pyqt.  With that patch, the workaround described in
the above link is not needed.

It seems to me, that the numpy module is not complete!? Or do I need to 
recompile paraview to get the filter working correctly!?

Best Regards!

Hi Rich,

I haven't forgotten about this issue. I just haven't had time to finish
testing the solution that is currently on git master.

I've published the patches on github now.  The branch is called
fix-multi-interp and the repo is git://github.com/patmarion/ParaView.git

    https://github.com/patmarion/ParaView/commits/fix-multi-interp

These commits fix the issues with using pyqt signal/slots in the paraview
python console, at least in my limited test cases.

Hmm, we don't have a nice interface for that.

The reflection filter will copy geometry across the x,y or z vector
and optionally aggregate the input and output together. But it looks
like that won't do anything but right angles.

The transformation filter will let you do arbitrary rotations so you
can rotate out each additional degree. It won't aggregate so you will
need an append filter to merge the results back together if you want
to control them all afterwards as one. The interface to specify the
transformation is either via text entry (exact) or via a widget that
you can drag around in the scene (easy).

I suggest setting up the transform manually via python scripting and
submitting a request on user voice for some new widget that is both
easy to use and exact and repeatable.

Alternatively a python programmable filter could do it fairly easily
by copying the data through and then applying a rotation to the
points.

Message-ID: <COL110-W41AA2E88264138F7D625D3958F0@phx.gbl>



Hi,

I'm trying to make animations using ParaView 3.10.1 64-bit for Linux.  When I load a state file to change 'Start Time' and 'End Time' in 'Animation View', 'Time' is not adjusted accordingly anymore, i.e., animation goes from the beginning to the end of the original data.  Has anyone had this issue?  The Windows version (ParaView 3.10.1 64-bit) doesn't seem to have this issue.

Regards,

Shin

No, don't recompile Paraview.
In the worst case, you simply want to install python 2.7 (same as Paraview)
on your computer, add the numpy library, and set your PYTHONPATH to this new
numpy directory.

I check if the numpy import works well with the binary package on a 64-bits
linux, I will let you know.
For now, I'm on a windows machine.

The import works fine for me, even with the 64-bits linux release.

Dear David,

Thanks a lot for your detailed suggestions. I will try these solutions
after the result has been prepared.

By the way, if the original result is based on a 2D axial symmetrical
model, can I do a rotation transformation to produce a 3D full cycle
result?

I will see how to submit a user voice to the website.

Thanks again.

Best regards,

GetRenderView() actually creates a second view, and it is empty. That is what you see being rendered.

to get the existing view after reloading your state, I suggest using

SetActiveView(GetRenderViews()[0])
Render()

and you will get your cone and your sphere.

Hi Christopher,

Would you be able to send me the older plt file that is failing and the
resulting file after it has been converted to the latest version of tecplot.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb : Repeated calls to GetLookupTableForArray
	do not change the RGBpoints array
Message-ID: <335458.99326.qm@web161603.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi
?? I've a case where the users can load .xml files saved from the Paraview's 'Edit Color Map' widget and apply the color maps (containing R,G,B and Opacity values) to volume rendering.

When I start the application a call is made is load a "default.xml" file and then do a :

Lut = pv.GetLookupTableForArray({arrayname : "ImageFile", num_components : 1, HSVWrap : 0, NanColor : nanColor, RGBPoints : rgbPoints, ColorSpace : colorSpace});

Sof = pv.CreatePiecewiseFunction( {Points: sofPoints});??? 

The variables nanColor, rgbPoints, sofPoints etc are populated by the XML file data. Then the Lookuptable is applied to the DisplayProperties for volume rendering. This part works well. 

However when the user changes the .xml color map file from a drop down, the same code is called again and this time it does something funny. It seems to retain the previous RGBPoints information and adds the new color map to it. So the two lookup tables look like they are merged. Is this expected ?

Is there a way to reset the lookup table ? I did not see any obvious call within simple.py or pwsimple.py.

Thanks
Raj

Subject: [Paraview] change default unstructured volume mapper in paraview
Message-ID: <BANLkTinzg4RDG+XkzvryJobX8zzHjwcBUg@mail.gmail.com>

hi everybody:
  firstly, I want to ask that can we change default unstructured volume
mapper in paraview. I find that paraview use
vtkProjectedTetrahedraVolumeMapper to do unstructured volume rendering. I
want to use vtkHAVSVolumeMapper or vtkOpenGLHAVSVolumeMapper instead. Can we
do it in paraview? Secondly, I change the rendering.xml in paraview source
code. I change ProjectedTetrahedraVolumeMapper of subproxy vtkPTMapper to
HAVSVolumeMapper or OpenGLHAVSVolumeMapper, but when I use volume rendering
in Paraviewl, the result image is wrong, I don't know why. Anybody know?
thank you in advance!

Message-ID: <1305792404.5433.9.camel@cribber>

Dear ParaViewer's,

Is there a way to pass text data along the pipeline, like a VTK text
object or something? Eventually I'd want to create something like a
custom source to generate an initial block of text, and then subsequent
filters in the pipeline to add to to it. Any suggestions for where to
start will be gratefully received.

cheers

My ParaviewWeb was compiled base on Paraview 3.11, I tried to load the  
plugins in PWConsole and they seem to be loaded (no error) but I can't  
open any data file (.img or .nii). I tried then using pvpython and got  
the same results (no reader found for ....).
After that, I decided to use another version of Paraview to see what happen:
  Paraview 3.10.1: - In pvpython: AnalyzeReader works, NIfTIReader NOT
                   - In GUI     : Both Work
  Paraview 3.8.1 : - In pvpython: Both NOT work
                   - IN GUI     : Both Work

I cant figure out what's going wrong here.
Could someone please help me ?
Many thanks!
Have a nice day!

Make sure everything has been compiled consistently, i.e. using the
same compiler version etc.

Subject: [Paraview] default value for DoubleVectorProperty
Message-ID: <BANLkTimd=BMG+CvngtY6zDdXtX5Sc4xKtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to set the default values in the below server manager
code to the one used by default in the class rather then explicit
values?

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
<ProxyGroup name="filters">
<SourceProxy class="vtkMyClass" ...
...
<DoubleVectorProperty name=... command="SetSomething"
number_of_elements="3" default_values="0 0 0" />

This is because some classes use e.g. VTK_DOUBLE_MAX, which I can not
smuggle through the xml.

Many thanks for any hints.

How are you loading the default.xml? Do the best of my knowledge, ParaView
Python API has no call to setup LUTs from XML.

I suggest putting the text you want into an array within the vtkDataObject's
field arrays (not the point associated or cell associated arrays).
See vtkDataObject::Get/SetFieldData.

Those arrays are generally passed through unmodified as most filters ignore
them.
But filters can be written that make use of them, for instance to add to the
text or which reads the text out and pass it along to a text display
representation.

Hello,
i'm writing simple reader to load binary .op2 files from nastran into Paraview.
Is it possible to use vtkCaptionActor2D (which i use extensively in my simple VTK-based program) in Paraview?
Is it possible also to get display (x and y in pixels of screen) coordinates of a point with given world coordinates?
Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Hi Utkarsh? ? I'm using Jquery to load the .XML files. It works without any problems the first time and RGBPoints extracted from the XML are applied correctly.?
The problem arises when the users selects a different XML file (different colormap). When the?GetLookupTableForArray is called again with the new set of RGBPoints, the visualization does not look correct. It looks like the the lookuptable maintained the earlier RGBPoints and merged the new set with the old.?
I was wondering if this was a bug or if their was a way to reset the lut to forget the old RGBPoints
ThanksRaj

When I start the application a call is made is load a "default.xml" file and then do a :

Lut = pv.GetLookupTableForArray({arrayname : "ImageFile", num_components : 1, HSVWrap : 0, NanColor : nanColor, RGBPoints : rgbPoints, ColorSpace : colorSpace});


Sof = pv.CreatePiecewiseFunction( {Points: sofPoints});??? 

The variables nanColor, rgbPoints, sofPoints etc are populated by the XML file data. Then the Lookuptable is applied to the DisplayProperties for volume rendering. This part works well. 


However when the user changes the .xml color map file from a drop down, the same code is called again and this time it does
 something funny. It seems to retain the previous RGBPoints information and adds the new color map to it. So the two lookup tables look like they are merged. Is this expected ?

Is there a way to reset the lookup table ? I did not see any obvious call within simple.py or pwsimple.py.


Thanks
Raj

Hi Sebastien

Here are the two javascript functions used for setting up the volume visualization. The second one (loadXMLColorMap()) is where Jquery is used to read the colormaps from the XML file. The variables Lut, Sof and CurrColormapFile are global. CurrColormapFile is the XML file chosen by the user from the UI :

??????? // **********************************************************************************************
??? ??? // set displayProperties for a particular data to show as volume 
??? ??? // **********************************************************************************************
??? ??? this.setupVolumeView = function (_data, _view) {

??? ??? ??? // load and setup the LUT and SOF before changing representation
??? ??? ??? this.loadXMLColorMap("./colormaps/" + CurrColormapFile);

??? ??? ??? pv.SetDisplayProperties( {
??? ??? ??? proxy : _data,
??? ??? ??? view? : _view,
??? ??? ??? SelectMapper : 'GPU',
??? ??? ??? Representation : 'Volume',
??? ??? ??? LookupTable : Lut,
??? ??? ??? ColorArrayName : 'ImageFile',
??? ??? ??? ScalarOpacityFunction : Sof
??? ??? ??? } );

??? ??? } // end of setDisplayToVolume()


??????? // **********************************************************************************************
??? ??? // Load a Paraview color map from an XML file
??? ??? // **********************************************************************************************
??? ??? this.loadXMLColorMap = function(_file) {

??? ??? ??? var colorSpace = 'None';
??? ??? ??? var nanField;
??? ??? ??? var rgbPointsIdx = 0;
??? ??? ??? var sofPointsIdx = 0;
??? ??? ??? var i, x, o, r, g, b;
??? ??? ??? 
??? ??? ??? var nanColor = new Array();
??? ??? ??? var rgbPoints = new Array();
??? ??? ??? var sofPoints = new Array();

??? ??? ??? jQuery.ajax({
??? ??? ??? ??? url : _file,
??? ??? ??? ??? success : function(data) {
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? // get the color space
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? colorSpace = jQuery(data).find("ColorMap").attr("space");

??? ??? ??? ??? ??? // get the values to create LUT and SOF??? 
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? jQuery(data).find("Point").each(function() {
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? i = jQuery(this);
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? x = parseFloat(i.attr("x"));
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? o = parseFloat(i.attr("o"));
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? r = parseFloat(i.attr("r"));
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? g = parseFloat(i.attr("g"));
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? b = parseFloat(i.attr("b"));
??? 
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? // Populate the rgbPoints array
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? rgbPoints[rgbPointsIdx++] = x;
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? rgbPoints[rgbPointsIdx++] = r;
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? rgbPoints[rgbPointsIdx++] = g;
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? rgbPoints[rgbPointsIdx++] = b;

??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? //Populate the sof Points array
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? sofPoints[sofPointsIdx++] = x;
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? sofPoints[sofPointsIdx++] = o;

??? ??? ??? ??? ??? });

??? ??? ??? ??? ??? nanField = jQuery(data).find("NaN");
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? nanColor[0] = parseFloat(nanField.attr("r"));
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? nanColor[1] = parseFloat(nanField.attr("g"));
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? nanColor[2] = parseFloat(nanField.attr("b"));
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? },
??? ??? ??? ??? 
??? ??? ??? ??? async : false
??? ??? ??? });

??? ??? ??? ??? 
??? ??? ??? 
??? ??? ??? // Create the LUT and SOF needed for the transfer function
??? ??? ??? Lut = pv.GetLookupTableForArray({arrayname : "ImageFile", num_components : 1, HSVWrap : 0, NanColor : nanColor, RGBPoints : rgbPoints, ColorSpace : colorSpace});

??? ??? ??? Sof = pv.CreatePiecewiseFunction( {Points: sofPoints});??? ??? ??? 

??? ??? } // End of loadXMLColorMap()



Thanks again.

Hi Raj,
could you send the piece of code that update those?RGBPoints values ??
Thanks,
Seb

Hi Utkarsh
? ? I'm using Jquery to load the .XML files. It works without any problems the first time and RGBPoints extracted from the XML are applied correctly.?

The problem arises when the users selects a different XML file (different colormap). When the?GetLookupTableForArray is called again with the new set of RGBPoints, the visualization does not look correct. It looks like the the lookuptable maintained the earlier RGBPoints and merged the new set with the old.?

I was wondering if this was a bug or if their
 was a way to reset the lut to forget the old RGBPoints
ThanksRaj

How are you loading
 the default.xml? Do the best of my knowledge, ParaView Python API has no call to setup LUTs from XML.

Hi
?? I've a case where the users can load .xml files saved from the Paraview's 'Edit Color Map' widget and apply the color maps (containing R,G,B and Opacity values) to volume rendering.



When I start the application a call is made is load a "default.xml" file and then do a :

Lut = pv.GetLookupTableForArray({arrayname : "ImageFile", num_components : 1, HSVWrap : 0, NanColor : nanColor, RGBPoints : rgbPoints, ColorSpace : colorSpace});



Sof = pv.CreatePiecewiseFunction( {Points: sofPoints});??? 

The variables nanColor, rgbPoints, sofPoints etc are populated by the XML file data. Then the Lookuptable is applied to the DisplayProperties for volume rendering. This part works well. 



However when the user changes the .xml color map file from a drop down, the same code is called again and this time it does
 something funny. It seems to retain the previous RGBPoints information and adds the new color map to it. So the two lookup tables look like they are merged. Is this expected ?

Is there a way to reset the lookup table ? I did not see any obvious call within simple.py or pwsimple.py.



Thanks
Raj

Hi Raj,

why don't you get the LUT the first time and then just change the values on
it.

 Lut.setRGBPoints(rgbPoints) ?

Indeed that's what you should do. GetLookupTableForArray's documentation
states that: "...Keyword arguments can be passed in to initialize the LUT if
a new one is created.". Hence the arguments are used only the first time
when the LUT is created.

Subject: [Paraview] problems with ServerManagerConfiguration and
	vtkImageReslice
Message-ID: <BANLkTinymKadeRaA3ki0XgUqQNn34H2QaQ@mail.gmail.com>

So far I was able to add a few simple custom plugins, but am slowly
losing the grip.
I am trying to resample an image like this:

<SourceProxy name="ImageResample" class="vtkImageResample"
label="ImageResample">
<InputProperty name="Input" command="SetInputConnection">
	<ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
		<Group name="sources"/>
		<Group name="filters"/>
	</ProxyGroupDomain>
	<DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
		<DataType value="vtkImageData"/>
	</DataTypeDomain>
</InputProperty>
<DoubleVectorProperty name="Magnification Factor"
command="SetAxisMagnificationFactor" number_of_elements="3"
number_of_elements_per_command="1" repeat_command="1" use_index="1"
default_values="1 1 1"/>

I get these 2 problems:

1) There appear two (!) outputs (named Output-0 and Output-1). I get
this message:

ERROR: In /home/dsz/pack/ParaView/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 827
vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x3aa4f60): Input for connection index 0 on
input port index 0 for algorithm vtkPVPostFilter(0x2cfb850) is of type
vtkImageStencilData, but a vtkDataSet is required.

2) The first output has the expected Spacing, but it does not contain
the same scalar array as in the input. Instead, it contains a new
array ImageScalars ranging [0,0]. I get this message:

Warning: In /home/dsz/pack/ParaView/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkTexturePainter.cxx,
line 179
vtkTexturePainter (0x339fa70): Failed to locate selected scalars. Will
use image scalars by default.

I have been so far successful with other image algorithms, however
they were all deriving from vtkImageAlgorithm. This one derives from
vtkThreadedImageAlgorithm - could this have anything to do here?
Could anyone point me into the right direction? After inspection of
the xml files in the ParaView source tree I am still clueless.

Thanks and regards,
Dominik

Seems, a some problem with off-screen rendering.
When I use WriteImage instead AnimationView and run script with

pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering test.py

I get memory leak.
But without --use-offscreen-rendering option there is no memory leak.
(But a window is blink. How can I avoid this?)
I attach modified test.py (with WriteImage)

I think my theory that it has to do with threading may be correct...

I just tried instead of my custom plugin to run the built-in Gradient
or Median on my vtkImageData and Paraview (3.11) silently segfaults.
Both these built-in filters derive from vtkThreadedImageAlgorithm.
Built-in vtkExtractVOI. however, works correctly, just as my other
custom plugins deriving from vtkImageAlgorithm.

Any pointers in this bug hunting are appreciated.

Hi,
regarding the vtkImageSlice exposition in ParaView, you should take
a look at these threads:
- issue report:
   http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg02225.html
   http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg08260.html
- issue deep explanation:
   http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-June/017738.html

regarding the segfault, I feel surprise ! I use Median and Gradient very
often, and I never noticed a bug. Can you give the step to reproduce ?

Best regards,
Jerome

Hi Jerome,

Thanks for the references, but there does not to be any solution in there?
And yes, "strange extents" are also taking place in some cases, i.e.,
extents are actually correct, but the content of the image data is
smaller if the new spacing is finer than the original.
Due to the lack of detailed description of this whole mechanism I can
not say if this is my lack of knowledge or a bug.

Regarding segfaults, the only non-standard thing I can say about my
input image data is that it contains a scalar type "double". The said
filters will work with image generated by Sources/Wavelet, but the
type of that one is float. I am afraid something is hardcoded
somewhere.

Regards,
Dominik

It does not work with OSMesa. Tried it already. But it shall work with a proper GPU. If I recall it correctly, there was some information flying around in this forum about which type of GPU is needed.

Hi All,

For some reason Surface LIC doesn't work for me. Should the surface LIC
work with osmesa ?

thanks

I don't have any problem running Median or Gradient on image of type
double. If you are allowed to share your data, I may give a try here.

Maybe are you running out of memory? You can try to extract a subset
of your data and see if the segfault occurs.

It is definitively not an out-of-memory problem!!
Your data makes my paraview crashed too, but not only. I tried with a vtk
python script (thus nothing to do with paraview) and the same occurs.

The reason comes from the way your Image.vti is built: the output of the
vtkXMLImageDataReader contains one PointData array, but scalars are not
set. You have to write somewhere when you build your image something like
that :
   myImage->GetPointData()->SetScalars(
myImage->GetPointData()->GetArray(0))

For a ParaView-exclusive solution, just plug a Calculator after the
Image.vti source
and set the operation to "FractalIterations" only. It will set properly the
output scalars.

Thank you so much. By using your commands the plugin works!
But how can we use it in PWConsole of ParaviewWeb ? (my goal is using  
paraviewWeb, so the use of javascript is important to me :) )
I tried with this but it didt work :(
paraview.LoadPlugin( {filename: '.../libAnalyzeReader.so',  
remote:false, ns:globals()});

I think that there's sth wrong with ns:globals().

Have a nice day!

Hello, I figured out how to load the plugin in paraviewWeb.
Just create a python file in your plugin directory of ParaviewWeb, and  
then you can load your plugin in it.
Have a nice day everybody :)

I generated the image by a custom filter operating on a generic
vtkDataSet, it just happens to be vtkImageData at this time. Your code
resolves the issue indeed, many thanks! But should the same be done
with other data types or only images? Do Scalars/Vectors always need
to be specified? These scalars/vectors/field data etc. remain unclear
for me for years.

Dominik

SurfaceLIC doesn't work with Mesa. It uses some OpenGL extensions that
Mesa has no plans to support due to IP issues.

Hello,

It's not going to be easy for someone without familiarity to
ParaView's internals to add a new unstructured volume mapper to
ParaView. Once I find some time I can probably write an example to
demonstrate the same. However, until then please be patient.

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph Trouble
Message-ID: <4DD69332.60703@us.army.mil>

I'm trying to put a glyph on every point for a filter. Currently it 
apply only one glyph containing all of the points. Am I doing something 
wrong here?

[code]
vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyData> pd =
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyData>::New();
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints> points2 =
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints>::New();
    points2->InsertNextPoint(0,0,1);
    points2->InsertNextPoint(1,1,1);
    points2->InsertNextPoint(2,2,1);
    points2->InsertNextPoint(100,2,1);
    pd->SetPoints(points2);
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkCubeSource> cubeSource =
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkCubeSource>::New();

    vtkSmartPointer<vtkGlyph3D> glyph3D =
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkGlyph3D>::New();
    glyph3D->SetSource(cubeSource->GetOutput());
    glyph3D->SetInput(pd);
    glyph3D->Update();

    this->data->SetBlock(1, glyph3D->GetOutput());

    output->DeepCopy(this->data);
[/code]

Thanks,

Ah, I had the Style Representation set to Outline, so the Outline 
contained all of the points. When changed to surface, I see what I want.

Hi Utkarsh,

I also had to patch the CMakeFile so that the server manager parts of 
the plugin would build without qt, which is a common use case for me. 
I'm attaching it in case you will support it.

Sounds good, I think I have a bug in my backlog to do the same.

I am able to read the file but unable to display it.
I could not find any documentation on netcdf display in ParaView.
Can anyone suggest me as how I can use ParaView 3.10 to display netcdf file.

Hi,

There are several NetCDF readers in ParaView.  The problem is that NetCDF
isn't a single file format but a method/library for storing and retrieving
data.  A convention must be specified to figure out how to interpret that
data. What convention is your file?  You can do "ncdump -h <filename>" to
see a brief description of what's in the file.  If you send the file (if
it's under 10mb) or include the output from that I may have an idea of which
NetCDF reader may work for you.

Hello everyone,

Just to announce - the problem is solved! It seems the problem was in
plugin's sources when setting texture coordinates data. So, if in
vtkMyExporter.cpp I remove

tex_coord_data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);

or set number of components to 2, correct texture will be generated!

Thanks everyone on Your help!

Best regards,
Nenad.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom application reading live-data
Message-ID: <13394624-735A-4149-905A-C0976F843232@gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to develop an custom application based on Paraview in order to read a live-data from an extern C++ class and display a graphical view of this data.
I have written this code thanks to an example :

myMainWindow::myMainWindow(QWidget* parentObject,
  Qt::WindowFlags wflags) : Superclass(parentObject, wflags)
{
  Ui::myMainWindow ui;
  ui.setupUi(this);

  // Get access to the for standard paraview views.
  pqPluginManager* pgm = pqApplicationCore::instance()->getPluginManager();
  pgm->addInterface(new pqStandardViewModules(pgm));

  // Make a connection to the builtin server
  pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
  core->getObjectBuilder()->createServer(pqServerResource("builtin:"));

  // Create render view
  pqRenderView* view = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
    pqApplicationCore::instance()->getObjectBuilder()->createView(
      pqRenderView::renderViewType(),
      pqActiveObjects::instance().activeServer()));
  pqActiveObjects::instance().setActiveView(view);

  // Set it as the central widget
  this->setCentralWidget(view->getWidget());

  pqApplicationCore::instance()->showOutputWindow();
}

Now I want to access to the pipeline and to put data into it. Could someone help me, because I don't see how to do this.
Thanks...

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with self-made VTK Unstructured Grid file in xml
	format
Message-ID: <4DDA2E39.6000501@gmx.net>

Hello,

I am currently writing my visualization data to vtk-xml files in 
unstructured grid format. As long as I do not add any cell information, 
this works fine. However, as soon as I have a single cell inside my 
data, Paraview 3.10.1 (32 bit precompiled binary on SUSE Linux) crashes 
when I press "Apply" after loading the data.

In the attachment, there is a very small example of my files - can 
anybody see a mistake therein?

Thank you in advance,

Mathias

Hi Mathias,

The content of "offsets" DataArray should be 8, not 1.

Hello Takuya,

Thank you for that hint. I just did not recognize, that "offset" points 
to the end of a cell instead of the beginning.

Now anything works fine.

Thanks again,

Mathias

Subject: [Paraview] segfault in a custom plugin
Message-ID: <BANLkTinzsQpx+Vb-m4Fk8nFCLi9w79Lsfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I am facing a segfault with a custom filter. Here a minimalistic setup
to reproduce the problem, Ubuntu 10.10 64bit:

I have copied the original vtkImageClip class, as well as its
ServerManager xml part, merely renaming it to vtkMyImageResample. I
have added a plugin like


ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyImageResample_Plugin "1.0"
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyImageResample.xml
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyImageResample.cxx
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES MyImageResampleGUI.xml)

The GUI part can not be simpler:

<ParaViewFilters>
 <Category name="My Filters">
  <Filter name="MyImageResample"/>
 </Category>
</ParaViewFilters>

Now I create an image using Sources->Wavelet (default options) and
call my filter. ParaView crashes with the backtrace pasted below.
Does anyone have any hints how to proceed from here?

Many thanks and best regards,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] paraview can't read back its own VTK grids with
	FieldData?
Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F68053056@MBX20.d.ethz.ch>

Hello

When using ParaView (v 3.11) to write data in the legacy format, I cannot read the files back, if they contain Field Data.

I have noticed that Paraview writes the Field Data before the DIMENSIONS tag, and when it reads the file back, it complains and cannot draw any data. I have noticed that the order of writing of the different tags matters greatly. I.e., the DIMENSIONS tag must be written before the FIELD data.

I edited  VTK/IO/vtkStructuredGridWriter.cxx and swapped a few lines of code, i.e.

 *fp << "DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID\n";

  input->GetDimensions(dim);
  *fp << "DIMENSIONS " << dim[0] << " " << dim[1] << " " << dim[2] << "\n";

  if (!this->WriteDataSetData(fp, input))
    {
........
    }

and ParaView can now read its own data. 

Can this cosmetic change be applied to all legacy writers, or is there something against it?

Interesting, I wonder how that could have worked with older version of
ParaView then. Did that piece of code change recently?

Dominik,

Can you attach the full source tar ball please? Would just make it
easier to try it out.

Thanks

Try removing the Plugins directory in under build directory and see if
that helps.

Hi,

The archive is here:

http://otoro.ethz.ch/~dominik/tmp/plugin.tar.bz2

Once again, the filter vtkMyImageResample is just a copy of
vtkImageChangeInformation with a customised name. I have also tried
vtkImageClip and vtkImageExtractVoi - they all segfault in the same
location. Note, removing the server CXX file and referencing the
original class in the xml file result in a proper operation, it is the
custom CXX part that generates the segfault.

Many thanks and best regards,
Dominik

See: http://paraview.org/Wiki/StreamingParaView

Streaming processes the data in small pieces to prevent memory exhaustion,
but it still makes the assumption that all of the data is available to read
from (it does not attempt to solve the problem of concurrent access).

Little of that code is useful for live data, other than the qt render
reschedule loop (see Plugins/StreamingView/ParaView/StreamingView.cxx in
3.10). In the distant past I used that trick to poll for either:
1) new data in a live data capable reader (simple)
2) a ready message from a live data capable server (difficult but efficient)

I have found out the reason to be VTK and ParaView conflict. It's
described on the Wiki, but I was not aware I have this problem,
because the libs listed by ldd plugin.so were pointing to ParaVIew's
VTK. But I do have VTK built independently elsewhere, if I rename it ,
the problem is gone. Apparently, ParaView sees the library paths
differently than ldd.

Because I knew of the warning in the Wiki and yet got into this trap I
suggest the Wiki entry is slightly extended:

* add another symptom: "Segmentation fault.
0x00007fffe8386dae in
vtkInformationVector::GetNumberOfInformationObjects (this=0x0)
   at /home/domel/pack/ParaView-3.10.1/VTK/Common/vtkInformationVector.h:43
43        int GetNumberOfInformationObjects() { return
this->NumberOfInformationObjects; };"

* Dependencies reported by ldd are not reliable, because ParaView may
see different library paths than ldd.


Thanks and best regards,
Dominik

To open this file in ParaView, just select it in the "Open File" dialog in
the GUI.  Then it will ask you which reader to use -- select the "NetCDF
files generic and CF conventions".

Looking at ncbrowse it appears to only handle structured rectilinear grids.
Some of the NetCDF conventions that ParaView supports include unstructured
grid data.

Dear Utkarsh,

Yes, it works perfectly with ParaView v3.8.* release sources. The
reason is in vtkScalarsToColorsPainter class which produces 256x1
texture in ParaView v3.8.*, while in ParaView 3.10.* (and current SVN
sources) it produces 256x2 texture. In v3.10.* case, in first row
(bottom-up) are texels with colors copied from lookup table, while in
second row (or first in top-down view) all texels are (64, 0, 0) -
dark red.

Best regards,
Nenad.

Subject: [Paraview] No "make package" for ParaView 3.10.1
Message-ID: <D594AE3B-ADC7-46E0-AE45-099A4ABDFC0A@bluequartz.net>

I have compiled ParaView with my own plugins and I would like to make some sort of zip or installer or DMG so I can easily pass it out at an upcoming event. I generated "makefiles" when I compiled ParaView. I tried "make package" and got an error back. How do I go about making a redistirbutable package?

Thanks. I Followed those directions and the Application bundle when launched has no menu bar, and only says "NewApplication". The Main ParaView windows does show up though. If I run it from the build directory all is fine. Am I missing something?

Subject: [Paraview] image extent problems in plugins
Message-ID: <BANLkTinqNQ+axw=FV1qx0t3Dw2EU6Hkm4w@mail.gmail.com>

This problem has been reported several times according to google, but
never resolved. I am just curious what goes on here, i.e. if the bug
is not acknowledged, low priority or otherwise will not be fixed on
low popularity.
If I wrap vtkImageResample - or any other vtk filter altering image
extents - into XML server code and load it into ParaView it will not
work correctly, because ParaView would not interpret the resulting
(modified) extents properly. The same filters used via python console
will save correct outputs to a file, but ParaView will not display
them correctly when run from a plugin.

I am just wondering how/if/when this can be fixed, willing to engage,
but in need of certain guidance.

Subject: [Paraview] Redistributable ParaView OS X Package is unusable.
Message-ID: <ECE484D8-0A1F-4FBF-A36E-652AD6D279B4@bluequartz.net>

I followed the directions on the wiki page to compile my own ParaView 3.10.1 because I have some custom plugins that I compile. The .dmg image was created just fine but the contained "ParaView.app" when launched only has a menu bar that has "New Application" menu. Nothing else. Yet when I run it from the Build folder everything works just fine. Is there something in the cmake configuration of ParaView that I need to set that tells CMake that I am going to making a redistributable package? The same thing happens if I try a "make install" from the command line. This is on OS X 10.6.8 with CMake 2.8.3 and the ParaView 3.10.1 sources from the web site.

I've never seen anything like that, as that is the same process I used to
make the 3.10.1 binaries. Though I did use cmake 2.8.4. Are you using a
really new Qt or something along those lines?

At first I would say it could be the version of Qt BUT the fact that everything works just fine running from the build directory tends to lead me away from that theory. Unless there are specific Qt 4.6.2 stuff in the CPack Configuration. It is like the MenuBar is not even getting loaded. Maybe a library not getting loaded which _should_ be in the install but is NOT? Not to complain here but I have a training class on wednesday where we are supposed to use ParaView for the visualizations.

Thanks

When running CPack on a "clean" paraview build directory where NONE of my plugins are being build I get the following after trying to run CPack:

cpack -G DragNDrop --config Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewConfig.cmake

I am really unsure, I haven't ever seen these kinds of errors before and I
am unable to reproduce this. sla.r on my system appears to just contain
license information. Have you tried manually removeing the _CPack_Packages
directory in your build tree to see if for some reason cpack isn't able to
blow it away entirely?

Can you provide the initial cmake configuration details of your vanila
paraview build?

Dave/Michael,
I possibly have the same issue going on .  I will be at Kitware tomorrow (Tuesday), and David and I should be able to take a look at it then.  Since I will have meetings, it may not happen until later in the day.

Dave, 
  What is the configuration you are using? Qt Version? As Carbon or Cocoa? Universal Binaries or x64 only? Self build or download from Nokia?

  What tag from paraview git repository are you using? I may be able to get my environment going like yours. 
 
  I also tried the latest ParaView master from head and my plugins need to be updated for that to work so using that is out of the question at this point.

 This is what I have tried and have not worked:
    Qt 4.6.2 Self built with NO custom plugins
    Qt 4.7.2 Self built with NO custom plugins
    "make install" of both of the above.
    using sudo for everything to avoid possible permissions issues.

I'll download the prebuilt Qt libraries from Nokia and try those. I guess I could also try CMake 2.8.4

Subject: [Paraview] origin of arc_length after application of "plot on
	intersection line" filter
Message-ID: <BANLkTinABY1N23H77oMqsLk=iP3SZvR9sg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all;

I have been calculated  a flow around a car in a duct.
I hope to know the distribution of pressure coefficient  on the body
surface, particularly on the typical intersection lines
in order to compare experimental results.

Please let me know about the "plot on intersection line"
After plotting the surface pressure, I had applied the " plot on
intersection line" filter to the surface plot.
I choose a y-normal intersection (y = 0, center of the body) and the
plot will be done to the X-Z surface intersection line.
I can see the 2-D plot of pressure (Vert. axis) vs arc_length (Hori.axis).

Then, my first question is where is the point of the arc_length == 0,
i.e.,  what are values of x and z at the arc_length == 0 ?
Second one is the calculation direction of the arc_length, because the
arc_length calculation can be defined CW or CCW  to the y-normal axis.

Best regards.

Subject: [Paraview] Non parallel filters under MPI
Message-ID: <BANLkTimigx8RN=6Ec6gpx=Y-of+V6Hd_7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on a seed connectivity filter for Paraview. It works as
expected when executed with only one server node. Nevertheless, when I
try to execute it in several nodes with mpi + pvserver, it doesn't
work any more because it tries to access the seed pixel in all the
pieces, and thus it is out of their extents. In addition, the
algorithm won't work if applied in sub-samples.

How can I force the filter to be executed in a single node even if run
under mpi?

I also pass these in as -D arguments on initial configure with cmake.

set(CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES "x86_64" CACHE STRING "force build for 64-bit
Leopard" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET "10.5" CACHE STRING "force build for 64-bit

set(CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT "/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk" CACHE PATH "force

Hmm. I am not seeing anything in there that is different from my setup
besides the Qt version. I have tried both 4.6.3 and 4.7.2 of Qt and
CMake versions 2.8.3 and 2.8.4. All with the same issue. Maybe asking
on the Qt interest list if anyone has ever seen this type of behavior
before?

It's difficult to figure out what you're trying to do as I'm not sure what a
seed connectivity filter should do.  Is the algorithm dependent on the input
grid?  In general the grid will be partitioned across multiple processes.

Subject: [Paraview] [help] Volume rendering in ParaviewWeb
Message-ID: <20110524161430.1849544ahtyl6oco@webmail2.insa-lyon.fr>

Hello everybody,
I tried to write a plugin (renderVol.py attached) to do a volume  
rendering in PWConsole of ParaviewWeb.
When I tried to set the ColorArrayName or Representation (functions in  
renderVol.py), I always got this:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<jsonrpc>", line 147, in handle_request
   File "/root/ParaViewWeb/WebServer/PW-work/plugins/renderVol.py",

     raise ValueError("Expected a tuple of 2 values or a string.")
ValueError: Expected a tuple of 2 values or a string.

execute_command_on_plugin {'error': {'message': 'Expected a tuple of 2

It'll work fine if I set them fix in my renderVol.py
examples:
    dp.ColorArrayName = 'MetaImage'
or dp.Representation = 'Volume'
But I want to set them manualy in PWConsole and then get that error :(
Could anyone please help me ? :)

Thank you in advance.
Have a nice day :)

Basically, I select a pixel on a grayscale vtkImage and then return a binary 
image with all pixels that are connected to the selected one as foreground 
pixels (black color) and the rest as background pixel (white color). The 
problem is, because the grid is partitioned across multiple processes, the 
selected pixel is only in one of the partitioned grids (I could just run the 
algorithm if the pixel is inside those grids) but connectivity could continue 
across other partitions.

I hope now it's a bit clearer. Anyway, thanks for answering.

Hi,

You should provide the JavaScript has well. Otherwise it's thought to
understand what is wrong when you have half of the informations.
Moreover, you can also look at that previous e-mail.
(http://markmail.org/thread/bm32g6sckjqvyiy5) It show some code on how
to setup the volume rendering from the JavaScript itself.

Hi,
My fault, I'm sorry :)

Here is what I did in PWConsole:

paraview.loadPlugins();
aaa = paraview.OpenDataFile({filename:"/root/DATA/hola.mhd"});    
//It's just a .mhd which point to a .raw data
paraview.Show();
vol = paraview.plugins.renderVol;
vol.init();
vol.setColorArrayName('MetaImage')  --> error in log (I pasted it in  
previous mail)
vol.setRepresentation('Volume')     --> same error

No matter how I try with 'Volume' or "Volume" or Volume or modify the  
way of parsing the arguments in renderVol.py, it didnt work :(

Thank for you link, I'll give it a try :)

Regards!

Subject: [Paraview] Cpack failing after ParaView build
Message-ID: <874E5F2FF2714086B8435C283B2B08ED@win.ara>


Dear All,

I've built ParaView 3.10.1 on a 64-bit CentOS system without any problems or
errors first time. I'd now like to package this into a tarball using Cpack,
but it is failing on line 44 in cmake_install.cmake with the same error
message but repeated for each folder:

CMake Error: The end of a CMakeLists file was reached with a FOREACH
statement that was not closed properly. Within the directory:
CMake Error: Error in cmake code at
/usr/people/gagliard/Paraview/ParaView-3.10.1-Release/VTK/Utilities/vtkhdf5/
src/cmake_install.cmake:44:
IF had incorrect arguments: EXISTS "${file}" AND NOT IS_SYMLINK "${file}"
(Unknown arguments specified).
Current CMake stack:

/usr/people/gagliard/Paraview/ParaView-3.10.1-Release/VTK/Utilities/vtkhdf5/
src/cmake_install.cmake

e
[1]
/usr/people/gagliard/Paraview/ParaView-3.10.1-Release/cmake_install.cmake

Then, at the very end there is this:
CMake Error: The end of a CMakeLists file was reached with a FOREACH
statement that was not closed properly. Within the directory:
CMake Error: The end of a CMakeLists file was reached with a FOREACH

Within the directory:
The arguments are: EXISTS
"$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/paraview-3.10/ParaViewTargets.cmak
e"
CPack Error: Error when generating package: IceT


I've tried this after compiling with VTK_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS ON and OFF to
see if it helped. I've also switched the CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH flag, but no luck.

Has anyone else had any issues using cpack with the latest release?

Thanks,

Adriano

How are you running cpack? What exactly is the command line you're giving
it.

In the project build directory, I just run the following command:

and it runs. This has worked in the past (but that means
ParaView-3.6.2-RC2). I'm trying again with:
 
>> cpack -C CPackConfig.cmake

What you're seeing is a bug I need to address as it is attempting to package
ice-t from the root of the ParaView build. With the branding changes to
ParaView the cpack configuration files for the core ParaView application are
in Applications/ParaView.

Take a look at this wiki page.

Problem solved.
 
I've just realised that I was using the system install of CPack 2.4.7 for
packaging, but was building ParaView with a user-specific build of CMake
2.8.3. This would explain those errors as I'd assume the syntax wasn't
supported in older versions of CPack. They have all disappeared now.
 
I have some new error messages but I think they are LD_LIBRARY_PATH related.
 
Thanks for the help!

How are you running cpack? What exactly is the command line you're giving
it.

What you're seeing is a bug I need to address as it is attempting to package
ice-t from the root of the ParaView build. With the branding changes to
ParaView the cpack configuration files for the core ParaView application are
in Applications/ParaView. 

Take a look at this wiki page.

The only other thing I can think of is that I don't run any of those
commands as sudo to create the binary. If you mix/match
priviledge/non-priviliedged execution, something will likely have a
permission problem and fail. To generate the binary this is my bash
history verbatim.

Using the command from the link got rid of the Ice-T error, but I still have
the INSTALL error appearing when looking for /usr/lib64/vtk/gnome-pty-helper
(it does exist and is in the system path). Any ideas what is causing this?

What you're seeing is a bug I need to address as it is attempting to package
ice-t from the root of the ParaView build. With the branding changes to
ParaView the cpack configuration files for the core ParaView application are
in Applications/ParaView. 

Take a look at this wiki page.

In the project build directory, I just run the following command:

How are you running cpack? What exactly is the command line you're giving
it.

Dear All,

I've built ParaView 3.10.1 on a 64-bit CentOS system without any problems or
errors first time. I'd now like to package this into a tarball using Cpack,
but it is failing on line 44 in cmake_install.cmake with the same error
message but repeated for each folder:

CMake Error: The end of a CMakeLists file was reached with a FOREACH
statement that was not closed properly. Within the directory:

Then, at the very end there is this:
CMake Error: The end of a CMakeLists file was reached with a FOREACH
statement that was not closed properly. Within the directory:
CMake Error: The end of a CMakeLists file was reached with a FOREACH

CPack Error: Error when generating package: IceT


I've tried this after compiling with VTK_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS ON and OFF to
see if it helped. I've also switched the CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH flag, but no luck.

Has anyone else had any issues using cpack with the latest release?

Thanks,

Adriano

This may be fixupbundle being over zealous in it's attempt to scan all of
paraview's dependencies. You may want to try turning off
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES.

I don't usually run them as 'sudo' either but I am grasping at anything at this point. This almost seems like the main ParaView program isn't loading a library/plugin that contains the menu bar setup code. Is that code in fact in a library or plugin? Maybe that library/plugin isn't getting properly setup during the fixup_bundle stage? Maybe I have a missmash of code in my ParaView source directory? What is the git tag for ParaView 3.10.1? Maybe I am not pulling correctly? Getting ready for another build with a completely clean 3.10.1 download from Kitware.

Just tried on a clean checkout of source with cmake 2.8.4 and have the same
result. Application has no real menu bar. Just a single menu that says
"NewApplication".
   Still no idea what is going wrong. This was with Qt 4.7.2 self compiled.

Sorry Michael - we are both in meetings, and so keep having large gaps in our day.

I did push a copy of my bundle to Dave's machines, and they seem to work.  Thus, I need to go back to my machine at home and try to figure out what is going on.  Maybe my machine has a different setup of some type?

You may want to do the same as I did - push the bundle to Dave, and have him try to run it on his machine.  That way you will know if it is the machine or bundle...  Sorry I don't have better ideas...

Just tried on a clean checkout of source with cmake 2.8.4 and have the same result. Application has no real menu bar. Just a single menu that says "NewApplication".
   Still no idea what is going wrong. This was with Qt 4.7.2 self compiled.

I don't usually run them as 'sudo' either but I am grasping at anything at this point. This almost seems like the main ParaView program isn't loading a library/plugin that contains the menu bar setup code. Is that code in fact in a library or plugin? Maybe that library/plugin isn't getting properly setup during the fixup_bundle stage? Maybe I have a missmash of code in my ParaView source directory? What is the git tag for ParaView 3.10.1? Maybe I am not pulling correctly? Getting ready for another build with a completely clean 3.10.1 download from Kitware.

Is a list of the original sources for the data files distributed with ParaView available?  I've searched the web with limited success, only turning up information about the bluntfin data set.  The data set I am most interested in is disk_out_ref, but I'd be grateful for pointers to the literature linked to any of the other files in the distribution.

Thanks,
Bob

Bad ParaView preferences in the ~/.config/ParaView directory. Blew it away and started ParaView just fine. I have had problems with ParaView preferences in the past.

 Thanks for the help.

The .dmg image was created just fine but the contained "ParaView.app" when launched only has a menu bar that has "New Application" menu. Nothing else. Yet when I run it from the Build folder everything works just fine. Is there something in the cmake configuration of ParaView that I need to set that tells CMake that I am going to making a redistributable package? The same thing happens if I try a "make install" from the command line. This is on OS X 10.6.8 with CMake 2.8.3 and the ParaView 3.10.1 sources from the web site.

from paraview for writing a new Unstructured grid volume Mapper?
Or just give me a simple example? Thank you so much!

waku2005,

* Make the intersection line visible in the 3D view by clicking the
eye-icon
* Open Selection Inspector
* Choose the PlotOnIntersectionCurve object from Current Object
* Click Create Selection
* Choose POINT from Field Type
* Click New Value
* Enter Composite ID of your interst DataSet from the Data Hierarchy
  list on the left
* Enter 0 in the Index field

And you should be able to see the origin point is highlighted in the
3D view and the 2D plot view.

Additionaly, you can see which points in 3D view corresponds to which
part of the plot by clicking Select Points On in the menu bar and
selecting the points by mouse, with point ID labels if you further do
* Click Point Label in the selection inspector
* Check Visible
* Label Mode: Point IDs.

Subject: [Paraview] wrong scalar type
Message-ID: <BANLkTingYfA5uS_ddC8k+rBiARyFoP_3_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am reading in my data this way:

reader = vtkXdmfReader()
reader.SetFileName(infile)
reader.Update()
dataset = reader.GetOutputDataObject(0)
print dataset.GetScalarType()

The problem, very likely a bug, is, that the scalar type after loading
is reported as 11 (VTK_DOUBLE) and not as expected 10 (VTK_FLOAT).
This fools some filters later on, so I need to fix it. The input data
is cited below, and is consistent with the actual content in the hdf5
file.
I am willing to fix this bug and submit a patch, but I can not find my
way through the vtkXdfm reader. There are only two instances of
VTK_DOUBLE, and none seems related to reading (one in reading points,
one in converting to xdmf array). Chances are, "11" is hardcoded
somewhere. I will be glad to receive some starting pointers.

Best regards,
Dominik

This may be fixupbundle being over zealous in it's attempt to scan all of

What you're seeing is a bug I need to address as it is attempting to package
ice-t from the root of the ParaView build. With the branding changes to
ParaView the cpack configuration files for the core ParaView application are
in Applications/ParaView. 

Take a look at this wiki page.

Dear All,

I've built ParaView 3.10.1 on a 64-bit CentOS system without any problems or

I've tried this after compiling with VTK_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS ON and OFF to
see if it helped. I've also switched the CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH flag, but no luck.

Has anyone else had any issues using cpack with the latest release?

Subject: [Paraview] 3.10.0 on mac OS X
Message-ID: <BANLkTinFa=BH0G4=nGOJQOVTgA8R6pz98Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have OS X 10.6.7 snow leopard on my laptop, and I'm trying to install
version 3.10.0 on it from
https://wiki-rdav.nics.tennessee.edu/index.php/Using_ParaView_on_Nautilus .
After it installs and I click the .dmg, it opens the window to drag the .app
into the applications directory. However, the .app has a symbol on it
notifying me that it is not compatible with my version of mac.  When I
download the 32 bit version 3.8.1, this does not occur.  Is this problem
related to 3.10.0 being 64 bit?  Snow Leopard should be able to handle this
issue... Thanks for any help.

That binary is 64 bit only. Depending on your hardware/how you installed
snow leopard can cause your snow leopard installation to be 32bit only. For
example if you had upgraded from a 32 bit leopard install (I've seen this
case a number of times). To get your snow leopard 64 bit you have to clean
install (use disk utilities and reformat your disk).

Anyway, I can generate a 32 bit 3.10.1 mac binary without too much effort
but I may not get to it for a few days, unless the 3.8 verion does
everything you need?

Hi Rich,

I haven't forgotten about this issue. I just haven't had time to finish testing the solution that is currently on git master.

Hi Rich,

The 3.10.1 version was being tested internally while I was fixing the mili reader. You should expect the next release of ParaView to have the fixes for the mili reader.

I have no problem with you submitting a bug about the Mili reader, so that you can track my progress on the issue.

ParaView 3.10.1 is now available for download on the ParaView download page.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Release Notes:

ParaView 3.10.1

ParaView 3.10.1 is a patch release to address a few issues detected in 3.10.0.

ParaView Binaries:
* Fixed crash on 32 bit Windows when opening CGNS files.
* Resolved crash issue when opening Xdmf files on 64 bit Windows.
* Fixed an issue where playing an animation would cause an increase in memory.
* Corrected a performance slowdown when parsing python array calculator expressions.

Development:
* Removed install rule for ParaViewLibraryDepends as it is no longer is being generated.
* Corrected Install rule for vtkPVApplicationComponents that was not exporting correctly causing link errors when compiling the SpreadSheet example on Fedora.
* Removed duplicate vtkVector class that was in ParaView but not used.
* Added exclusions to the wrapping parser that would inadvertently attempt to wrap gl.h which would subsequently cause builds to hang on some systems.

For an exhaustive list of the new features and bug-fixes, please refer to the change log at: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php?version_id=82

Dear Sebastien,

hello, now I'm trying build ParaViewWeb server on Linux(CentOS5.6).
But at the make process of activemq-cpp, error has occured. 
The message is "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -luuid".
So I search some uuid-rpms and attached them, but the situation doesn't change.
So please let me know how can I resolve this error.

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf + vtk image extents
Message-ID: <BANLkTinYhyzmUCRCvetZrJ3nrQ6Z+Riwhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have realized that Xdmf does not have a concept of "extents", just
as vtkImageData does.
This is a problem for me, because I need to store separate VOI's that
make up one consistent canvas.
What's the best way to accomplish this with Xdmf? I am aware of the
HyperSlab concept, but the examples I saw so far were of the type:

<DataItem ItemType="HyperSlab"
  Dimensions="25 50 75 3"
  Type="HyperSlab">
  <DataItem
    Dimensions="3 4"
    Format="XML">
    0 0 0 0
    2 2 2 1
    25 50 75 3
    </DataItem>
    <DataItem
    Name="Points"
    Dimensions="100 200 300 3"
    Format="HDF">
    MyData.h5:/XYZ
  </DataItem>
</DataItem>

e.g. referencing subset of some full, but existing dataset. I do not
have this full dataset, I have multiple ones making up for one full.
How do others deal with this?

Best regards,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] Xdmf versus XML image data reader
Message-ID: <BANLkTikwZtu3GrL08ccz39ox+bsFBWG1OQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have found experimentally that the same image data takes much longer
to read and write using XdmfReader/Writer as compared to
XMLImageDataReader/Writer.
Does anyone have similar findings? What could be the reason?

PS. I am on Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 both 64 bits, Xdmf as of git, vtk
5.6.1 ParaView 3.10.1 and 3.11, serial hdf5 1.8.4.

Hi Everyone,
Is PV known to cause arrayd services (on SGI ALTIX system) to crash? This
does not always happen; but my system admin is blaming me that PV is
crashing the array services on some nodes, and I really don't know how to
confirm/refute this.

Hi Katsumi,

did you looked at that web page ?
http://activemq.apache.org/building-activemq-cpp.html

The first link refer to the project that you are missing. I guess, in
your case, you'll have to build that project too.

Message-ID: <4DDE5B380200003800025DF4@gwia1.im.jku.at>

** Reply Requested When Convenient **


Hy everybody ! 

I have a serie of .png file Named xxx1001.png to xxx1400.png i want to read it as a  volume , 
when i try to read it with the png reader in paraview i get the hole slices 0 - 400 listed but when i try to read it  
it shows only one slice, i think that i'm for sure doing something wrong because it allready recognises the series of .png files ,and i just dont get the spacing etc. between the slice of each file. 
what is the error ! 

thank you

I don't think anyone has ever put that list together.

To go about doing that, inspect the commit log messages for files in the

Any information regarding this would be really helpful.

Subject: [Paraview] Possible NetCDF conflict?
Message-ID: <75533FA2C7524169BCC09A37E2A111DE@win.ara>


Dear All,

I appear to be getting a conflict between a reader plugin I developed that
handles the NetCDF format and the latest release of ParaView. The call that
is giving me issues is the NcVar function call, name(), which returns a
NcToken (const char *). The issue is that the call now returns a NULL
pointer regardless of dataset, which is wrong. 

To be clear:

(1) I have compiled my plugin with the same, static netcdf libraries
consistently between both versions of ParaView.
(2) The reader code has not changed between both versions of ParaView.
(3) All variables exist in the NetCDF files and the data files themselves
have not changed between both versions of ParaView.
(4) By removing the NcVar var->name() call in the code and hard-coding a
variable name that exists in the file (e.g. const char* = "pressure"), the
reader works i.e. it detects the variable, loads it in and displays it
correctly.

Item 4 is what leads me to believe there is now some sort of conflict
occuring between the old (PV3.6.2) and new (3.10.1) versions of ParaView. I
know there is support for specific NetCDF files in ParaView already. If
possible, I'd like to try and compile my plugin against the NetCDF libraries
used for those readers. Can I do this? In the meantime, I'm going to try
downloading and compiling against the latest NetCDF libraries to see if it
resolves the issue.

Thanks,

Adriano

Hi Adriano,

I wrote the vtkNetCDFCAMReader and I'm using the C++ API to NetCDF in that
reader.  The NcVar::name() method is used in that code.  Instead of using
the standard netcdf c++ header file you can include vtk_netcdfcpp.h
instead.  A couple of finer points that may or may not affect you:

1) There may be some issue with including mpi.h and having the netcdf header
files rename some of the mpi constants.

2) The default netcdf error condition (e.g. trying to access a variable that
doesn't exist using get_var() ) is to call exit.   You can do something
like  "NcError ncError(NcError::verbose_nonfatal);" to turn this behavior
off while ncError is in scope.

Andy

Correct, as is can.exo.  I could probably ask around and try to figure out who created it, if needed.

Yup.  In addition I happen to know that can.exo is generated by the Pronto 3D solver (part of Sierra Mechanics).  That data set happens to be documented in this technical report:

I have an obj file and a ply file which both have a lot of detail. The

(.2MB). I want to use these two as glyphs for each point in my reader. I

hi,
Are you just using the default glyphs that come with Paraview? i think 
they include a maskpoints option too.

I'm using custom polydata saved to obj/ply files that was used for other 
projects. The other projects needed the detail they provide. I, however, 
do not. So to speed up what I'm doing, I'd like to reduce them to a more 
manageable size.

You could try using the Clean filter to merge redundant points, and play with the tolerance to further reduce complexity.

Subject: [Paraview] Access to paraview pipeline
Message-ID: <4DBE871B-AC02-41A8-8778-FF4D4BCF04AE@gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to develop an custom application based on Paraview in order to read a live-data from an extern C++ class and display a graphical view of this data.
I have written this code thanks to an example :

myMainWindow::myMainWindow(QWidget* parentObject,
 Qt::WindowFlags wflags) : Superclass(parentObject, wflags)
{
 Ui::myMainWindow ui;
 ui.setupUi(this);

 // Get access to the for standard paraview views.
 pqPluginManager* pgm = pqApplicationCore::instance()->getPluginManager();
 pgm->addInterface(new pqStandardViewModules(pgm));

 // Make a connection to the builtin server
 pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
 core->getObjectBuilder()->createServer(pqServerResource("builtin:"));

 // Create render view
 pqRenderView* view = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
   pqApplicationCore::instance()->getObjectBuilder()->createView(
     pqRenderView::renderViewType(),
     pqActiveObjects::instance().activeServer()));
 pqActiveObjects::instance().setActiveView(view);

 // Set it as the central widget
 this->setCentralWidget(view->getWidget());

 pqApplicationCore::instance()->showOutputWindow();
}

Now I want to access to the pipeline and to put data into it. Could someone help me, because I don't see how to do this.
I would like some explanation to be able to progress in my project because I'm stuck.

Thanks in advance

Bastien

It's quite easy to do in the XMF file:

<Attribute AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Cell" Name="H2O_mass_fraction">
  <DataItem NumberType="Float" Dimensions="36 36 28" Precision="8" Format="HDF">&outputpath;/RESTS/REST_N_R00/REST_N_00000/REST_N_00000.h5:/FlowData/H2O_mass_fraction</DataItem>
</Attribute>

for example.

What I mean is to set the array name from the writer in the program,
not tweaking the xml file. Or did I get you wrong?

Message-ID: <BANLkTimyK0fOGSZrH5-6uxXUAmLNKBT4Xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to export an animation in ParaView.  It seems I have to load all
frames in before I can export the movie (analogous to the "flipbook" in
EnSight).  As is possible in EnSight, is there a way to export a movie from
ParaView without having to load in all frames first? (This would be great as
I would not have to return to my machine and save the movie after all the
frames are loaded).  Thanks!

I am being a bit confused - just open your data, then go File/ Save Animation, and save the file.   You do not have to hit the "Play" button before saving an animation.  If this doesn't write out  your animation, you may have found a bug.  Please give us directions on how to replicate it.

I have pvserver connecting to my client through reverse connection. 
However, after i disconnect from the gui, the job (submitted through 
PBSPro 10.6) continues to run, and i checked and saw that pvserver was 
still running on the nodes. Is there any option by which the pbs job 
will terminate when i disconnect from paraview client gui?

Hi Andy,
 
Well, I managed to get it compiled and working by linking against NetCDF
4.1.1. However, I think it makes sense to remain consistent with the NetCDF
version that ParaView uses, which is what I've done and I've got that
working now as well. I've not had any issues with respect to MPI so far, but
I've still to finish testing. If I find any issues, I'll be sure to repost!
 
Thanks for your help.

Hi Adriano,

I wrote the vtkNetCDFCAMReader and I'm using the C++ API to NetCDF in that
reader.  The NcVar::name() method is used in that code.  Instead of using
the standard netcdf c++ header file you can include vtk_netcdfcpp.h instead.
A couple of finer points that may or may not affect you:

1) There may be some issue with including mpi.h and having the netcdf header
files rename some of the mpi constants.

2) The default netcdf error condition (e.g. trying to access a variable that
doesn't exist using get_var() ) is to call exit.   You can do something like
"NcError ncError(NcError::verbose_nonfatal);" to turn this behavior off
while ncError is in scope.

Dear All,

I appear to be getting a conflict between a reader plugin I developed that
handles the NetCDF format and the latest release of ParaView. The call that
is giving me issues is the NcVar function call, name(), which returns a
NcToken (const char *). The issue is that the call now returns a NULL
pointer regardless of dataset, which is wrong.

To be clear:

(1) I have compiled my plugin with the same, static netcdf libraries
consistently between both versions of ParaView.
(2) The reader code has not changed between both versions of ParaView.
(3) All variables exist in the NetCDF files and the data files themselves
have not changed between both versions of ParaView.
(4) By removing the NcVar var->name() call in the code and hard-coding a
variable name that exists in the file (e.g. const char* = "pressure"), the
reader works i.e. it detects the variable, loads it in and displays it
correctly.

Item 4 is what leads me to believe there is now some sort of conflict
occuring between the old (PV3.6.2) and new (3.10.1) versions of ParaView. I
know there is support for specific NetCDF files in ParaView already. If
possible, I'd like to try and compile my plugin against the NetCDF libraries
used for those readers. Can I do this? In the meantime, I'm going to try
downloading and compiling against the latest NetCDF libraries to see if it
resolves the issue.

Thanks,

Adriano

Has anyone else had the same problem. I'm never certain if I have somehow messed up my plugins/build or if it's a new bug ....

Oh before I started debugging this, you mentioned plugins, so are
these custom filters being loaded from a plugin? If so, is the plugin
being loaded on the server too? Unlike before, filter xmls are now
exclusively loaded from the server.

pvserver is designed to quit after the client disconnects. Does this
show up after a particular operations or always? Is this a debug
build? Can you post the stack track for the place where the server is
wainting after client quits?

Subject: [Paraview] VisTrails plugin build issue
Message-ID: <34BCFC17F6F54E899756F1DC77871B73@win.ara>


I've picked up on a small issue with the VisTrails plugin. My recent
ParaView build was made against a version of Python that did not include the
PyQt libraries, and the VisTrails plugin built without any issues. When
loading the plugin into ParaView, an error message appears on the command
line:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/raid2/rrns/ARA_builds/x86_64/ParaView-3.10.1-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.1
0/vistrails/api/VisTrails.py", line 48, in ?
    from plugin.app import CaptureAPI
  File
"/raid2/rrns/ARA_builds/x86_64/ParaView-3.10.1-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.1
0/vistrails/plugin/app/CaptureAPI.py", line 27, in ?
    from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtNetwork, QtGui
ImportError: No module named PyQt4

ParaView continues to work fine. However, ParaView will not close down
properly after and I'm required to send a kill command to the process. In
doing so, none of the changes I may have made in the session are written to
my .config directory. I guess it may be worth cancelling the VisTrails build
process if PyQt isn't found?

Thanks,

Adriano

Hi Andy,
 
Well, I managed to get it compiled and working by linking against NetCDF
4.1.1. However, I think it makes sense to remain consistent with the NetCDF
version that ParaView uses, which is what I've done and I've got that
working now as well. I've not had any issues with respect to MPI so far, but
I've still to finish testing. If I find any issues, I'll be sure to repost!
 
Thanks for your help.
 
Adriano

Hi Adriano,

I wrote the vtkNetCDFCAMReader and I'm using the C++ API to NetCDF in that
reader.  The NcVar::name() method is used in that code.  Instead of using
the standard netcdf c++ header file you can include vtk_netcdfcpp.h instead.
A couple of finer points that may or may not affect you:

1) There may be some issue with including mpi.h and having the netcdf header
files rename some of the mpi constants.

2) The default netcdf error condition (e.g. trying to access a variable that
doesn't exist using get_var() ) is to call exit.   You can do something like
"NcError ncError(NcError::verbose_nonfatal);" to turn this behavior off
while ncError is in scope.

Dear All,

I appear to be getting a conflict between a reader plugin I developed that
handles the NetCDF format and the latest release of ParaView. The call that
is giving me issues is the NcVar function call, name(), which returns a
NcToken (const char *). The issue is that the call now returns a NULL
pointer regardless of dataset, which is wrong.

To be clear:

(1) I have compiled my plugin with the same, static netcdf libraries
consistently between both versions of ParaView.
(2) The reader code has not changed between both versions of ParaView.
(3) All variables exist in the NetCDF files and the data files themselves
have not changed between both versions of ParaView.
(4) By removing the NcVar var->name() call in the code and hard-coding a
variable name that exists in the file (e.g. const char* = "pressure"), the
reader works i.e. it detects the variable, loads it in and displays it
correctly.

Item 4 is what leads me to believe there is now some sort of conflict
occuring between the old (PV3.6.2) and new (3.10.1) versions of ParaView. I
know there is support for specific NetCDF files in ParaView already. If
possible, I'd like to try and compile my plugin against the NetCDF libraries
used for those readers. Can I do this? In the meantime, I'm going to try
downloading and compiling against the latest NetCDF libraries to see if it
resolves the issue.

Thanks,

Adriano

Utkarsh

The plugins are loaded on client and server (did you really need to ask?)

I had an idea which I tested. I have custom panels (dockwindows), which create proxies, when the gui starts up, the proxies are generated correctly. Then I connect to a server, panels are still ok, but proxeies have been destroyed. I may have messup up my callbacks to the server closed and reopened after the changes to connection manager. Menus are now gone from plugins.

However. if I disable plugins autoload, then connect to server, then manually load plugins - panels work correct because proxies are correctly created on the server and menus are available.

for now I can manually load plugins (yawn) and fix my unregistering of proxies when the server is disconnected and reconnected - this might be enough - but if you can see/say why the menus fail to appear - then any clues are welcome. Try a simple plugin (eg point sprite). when autoloaded and a connection is made - fail - when manually loaded afterwards - ok - can you duplicate that? yes ?

Oh before I started debugging this, you mentioned plugins, so are
these custom filters being loaded from a plugin? If so, is the plugin
being loaded on the server too? Unlike before, filter xmls are now
exclusively loaded from the server.

ParaView's creates its (potentially remote and parallel) VTK data processing
pipeline by creating and managing vtkSMSourceProxies (
http://www.paraview.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkSMSourceProxy.html). Source
Proxies are what you see in the Pipeline Browser.

You can think of a source proxy as a handle to one vtkAlgorithm within the
pipeline (in practice it isn't always 1:1 but it helps to think of it that
way). The Proxy is what allows paraview to control the many parallel copies
of the vtkAlgorithm that are instantiated in the nodes of the remote server
machine. SMSourceProxy adds additional infrastructure to SMProxy to manage
vtkAlgorithm output ports so that they can be connected into a pipeline and
so that the vtkDataObjects produced by the filter can be managed.

See Qt/Core/Testing/BasicApp.cxx for a demonstration of the use of source
proxies to create a small pipeline.

Hi Utkarsh,
This problem always shows up, even if i do not load any data.
The build is: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG (PV 3.10.1, both server and client)
Can you please tell me how I can do a stack trace of pvserver?

Also,
1) pvserver disconnects properly when run on head node standalone
2) pvserver disconnects properly when run on *one* node via PBS job 
scheduler.

problem arises when i try to use more than one node in the cluster.

Is paraview reading it as a time series? If so the bottom of the information
tab will show 400 odd timesteps pressing the play vcr control button will
play them like a movie.

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver does not terminate after gui disconnects

Hi Guys,

I have noticed this as well. I have been dealing with it by using qdel 
to make sure the pvserver gets shut down and allocation doesn't get 
wasted. I thought this happened because I used ncat to forward a port, 
so I never looked into it.

I've used a bash script to submit the pvserver job to the batch system 
so I can deal with this as follows: qsub returns the job id which I 
save, I register an exit handler with bash to run the qdel command when 
the script exits. then keep the script running in a while loop. This may 
help you while this resolved.

JID=`qsub -v ... start_pvserver.qsub`
ERRNO=$?
if [ $ERRNO == 0 ]
then
echo "Job submitted succesfully."
else
echo "ERROR $ERRNO: in job submission."
fi

# make sure the job is deleted, if this window closes.
trap "{ qdel $JID; exit 0;  }" EXIT

JIDNO=`echo $JID | cut -d. -f1`

# keep the shell open
while :
do
   echo "Enter command (h for help):"
   echo
   echo -n "$"
   read -n 1 inchar
   case $inchar in
     H|h)
       echo

       echo "    p - pages job $JID's stderr/stdout stream."
       echo "    l - ls job $JID's stderr/stdout file."
       echo "    h - print help message."

Hi Jeremy,

32 frames per second should work.

Subject: [Paraview] error making animation
Message-ID: <BANLkTikysJ=Em3h4c+ev+YLCRwC5nxd9bA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

If I specify the fps to be 1, then the animation gets saved properly.
However, it doesn't look good because it takes too long to transition
between frames.  If I set the fps to 20, I get the following error:

  Generic Warning: In
/home/kitware/Projects/ParaView-3.10/source/VTK/IO/vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx, line
211

Could not open codec.

 ERROR: In
/home/kitware/Projects/ParaView-3.10/source/VTK/IO/vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx, line

vtkFFMPEGWriter (0xd421880): Error initializing video stream.

Does anyone know why this occurs?

Here some numbers.

Data generated as

source = vtkImageSinusoidSource()
source.SetWholeExtent(0,512,0,512,0,512)
source.Update()

is saved as: VTI uncompressed, VTI compressed, XDMF. The sizes on disk
are, respecitvely 1080046108,105356654 and 1080047720 (h5 part). The
files are then read back. It takes about 1s, 4s and *100s*
respectively. Writing seems reasonable, but there is clearly a serious
issue with the Xdmf reader, because if I read the data in the h5 file
using python tables it takes about 4s.

I will be glad to hear any suggestions how to locate the problem.

Regards,
Dominik

I think the "Collection" Gridtype is the answer for this.

Specify the whole object via the collection grid and the individual pieces
as subgrids each covering different portions of the domain.

Below is a fake example, (I couldn't get parallel paraview git master server
to write the wavelet source out correctly, but suspect an earlier version
would), but the overall layout should look like this:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">

  <Grid Name="Wavelet" GridType="Collection">

Subject: [Paraview] showing geometry when running in parallel

Hello,

I like to show the geometry of my computational domain as a surface with low
opacity in my animations.  When running in parallel, the interprocessor
boundaries are shown.  Is there a way to show the actual physical boundary
without showing these as well?

If each processor has a layer of ghost cells (ie cells flagged as being the
responsibility of the neighbor processor on the other side of the internal
boundary) paraview will have enough information not to show the internal
boundaries.

HI David,

As I see it, you have two blocks here with separate origins. It can be
used to approximate what I want, but it is not the same. I mean one
origin for all blocks, but different extents, just like outputs from
vtkExtractVOI. VTK XML formats can store such information. But I guess
this concept is too VTK specific... please correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] Test Data for Particle Tracer ?
Message-ID: <BANLkTineAR10zi8QCckwNV0rwMqmwQXD6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Referring to the email at
http://www.vtk.org/pipermail/vtk-developers/2008-August/005449.html, I
assume that there is test data for the Particle Tracer Plugin in ParaView.
Where can I access it?

Thanks!

I have been digging deep into this issue for the recent days.
It has destructive consequences in scenarios like:

* read an xdmf file using vtkXdmfReader
* use a (old designed?) filter relying on image scalars, not point/cell data
* <bang> update the pipeline </bang>

I have seen things from crashes to highly inconsistent and
irreproducible behaviors, including segfaults on program exit and
invalid values in the output. <highlight> All these issues go away
when I use the XML VTI image reader </highlight>. I think this needs
treatment. I am glad to involve in any discussion.

Once the pvserver process has hanged, connect to any one of the processes with gdb. Use gdb --pid= to attach to a particular process. Then type "where" and that will give you the call stack. Do this for both the processes and we'd know where they ate stuck.

Subject: [Paraview] plugin proxy timing issue
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990BE38C@MBX20.d.ethz.ch>

Trying to resolve the problem of plugins creating proxies on startup, then deleting them and recreating them again when a new connection to pvserver instances. I find that plugin panels 
1) Receive aboutToRemoveServer, serverAdded, aboutToRemoveServer, serverAdded (twice when the self connection is closed and a pvserver connection is made. This is not a problem, but nonetheless odd and probably a bug.
2) plugins on the client, receive serverAdded, before plugins on the server have been loaded, so if they try to create proxies via the proxymanager - they fail because the server doesn't have them yet and can't create them.

#2 is a problem. I'm looking around to see if there is some other way I can destroy and recreate proxies when the gui starts up and then the user makes a new connection. Ideally I need a pluginsLoaded (on the server) rather than a serverAdded event.

If anyone knows a way, please tell. It may save me some time :)

Thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Calling GetProperty() of server manager proxy object
 from plugin object panel
Message-ID: <20110529.183750.39665193.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

In the GUI panel (a subclass of pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel) of my
reader plugin I have lines getting property of its corresponding
server manager proxy object, like
  vtkSMIntVectorProperty *uiRescale
      = vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(this->proxy()->GetProperty("UiRescale"));

This works fine with PV 3.10.1 in both builtin and client server modes,
and in builtin mode of PV git master. However in client server mode of
PV git master as of today, the call
  this->proxy()->GetProperty("UiRescale")
returns a null pointer. Did anything in this regard change with the
git master?

The tested platform is OS X 10.6.7, Qt 4.7.2, CMake 2.8.4.

Thanks,
Takuya

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver on node with 4 gpu's and 1 cpu(4 cores)
Message-ID: <4DE2BE0B.9060200@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I am trying to  run pvserver on a computer with 4 tesla c1040 gpu's and 
a  4 core CPU.
In the Paraview wiki about running on nodes with multiple gpu the 
following is mentioned:

"For example, if you have two GPUs on a node, they are probably 
referenced by the displays localhost:0.0 and localhost:0.1."

How to i find out which gpu's are referenced by which displays? If they 
are not referenced by any displays, can anyone please tell me how i go
about in actually setting it? In particular i saw this thread:
http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-April/017171.html
but could not figure out the above question.

Thanks in advance,

pratik

Dear Sebastien,

hello, as you mentioned,  I missed activemq-cpp project build. Sorry...
I successed activemq-cpp build and ParaView build. But in the next phase,
I met a trouble.

By the manual (website and readme.txt), I have to build the "build-pw" directory
by "ccmake ../SOURCE_DIR". But I couldn't find "SOURCE_DIR".
So I tried "ParaViewWeb" directory gotten by git command. But cmake doesn't work...
How should I indicate directory as the "SOURCE_DIR" ?

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Hi Katsumi,

your first attempt was the right one. SOURCE_DIR is the ParaViewWeb
source directory that you get from git. It's the higher directory that
contains a CMakeList.txt file.

Now the question is, what do you mean by CMake doesn't work.

That sounds very fishy. I'll take a look at this.

> 2) plugins on the client, receive serverAdded, before plugins on the server have been loaded, so if they try to create proxies via the proxymanager - they fail because the server doesn't have them yet and can't create them.

That's interesting. I didn't realize this use-case. Let me try to
restructure the plugin-auto-loading mechanism to ensure that the
plugins are loaded before the serverAdded gets fired. The fix would be
auto-load server-side plugins in aboutToAddServer (or whatever the
corresponding signal is called).

Is the plugin being loaded on the server-side as well? XML's are now
fetched from  the server-side in ParaView so pure-XML plugins should
be loaded on server-side as well.

Message-ID: <5D923A09-42DB-4D8A-88C2-ABF6BFAD2B25@bluequartz.net>

I am creating an STL Binary file from another program. I am then trying to load it in ParaView. ParaView seems to recognize the STL file but after I load it nothing appears. I click on the "Information" tab and it says Polygonal Mesh but 0 cells and 0 points. There are no error messages or anything else. Is there something I can enable to try and figure out why nothing is showing up or the read is failing?

Thanks

Get the XMLName and XMLGroup for the proxy you are accessing. Is it
what you expect?

Hi Mike,

I saw this issue when running with a non english locale : all "." had been 
replaced by "," characters, and the file was not read properly. Just an 
idea...

Best,
Stephane

Hi,

The current STL reader has no debug information to tell you why it failed to
read a file. If you are able to send me the file I can look into why the
reader fails.

I'm writing a Binary STL file which I would think would avoid those types of locale conversion issues but it is always a possibility. I wonder if ParaView assumes an ASCII STL file and not a binary STL file.

Hi Utkarsh,

Please excuse me on this, but the cluster that I was working on will not 
be available for me for the next
week or so. As soon as it is back up, i will test this and send it to 
you (most likely by saturday/sunday)

Thanks,
pratik

Figured it out. The issue was obviously in my writer. I was not offsetting into the file correctly to write the data which lead ParaView to basically just read junk data would be my guess and could not interpret it.

Sounds good. Thanks.

If the call stack is same on both processes, it may be that
MPI_Finalize is freezing. Then we can try to track down why
MPI_Finalize would freeze and that would help us get to  the root
cause of the issue.

I took a look at the STL Reader class in VTK and I did notice something that would cause issues with some STL files. In Binary STL files the 49 and 50 byte of each triangle is set to be the "Attribute Byte Count". In our case this may NOT actually be zero as we are contemplating actually using that capability of the STL File to encode some information for the triangle. In our case this would be a non zero number but the VTK STL reader assumes it is zero by reading and then throwing away those 2 bytes. I believe to be most compatible with the STL spec one should read the two bytes, then skip ahead the value of those 2 bytes.
  Now the "Devil's advocates" among us are going to say that this may break compatibility with existing STL files. Those STL files are Technically wrong BUT there could always be a user option to enable/disable "Strict" STL mode for the reader? Better error reporting and warning feedback might also help users who are writing their own STL files spot their mistakes, like the number of triangles not being correct in the file, or the attribute byte length being zero when it isn't but needs to be.
  Anyways, thanks for offering to help with my file.

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that everyone can
contribute to and benefit from the answers.

We don't have a clean way to disambiguate between when a series of files
means temporal extent or when it means spatial partitions (or both for that
matter). In the case of PNG ParaView thinks it always means temporal. To get
around that you could either:
1) make a plugin (an XML only plugin might work) that exposes vtkPNGReader's
SetFilePrefix and SetFilePattern interface. See the ImageReader proxy
definition in readers.xml for an example.
2) from the python shell, instantiate a VTK level vtkPNGReader and
vtkImageDataWriter to convert formats into something that ParaView
recognizes as a volume.

Yes. I can see that the server side plugin (which is not a pure-XML
plugin but a dylib) is loaded in the plugin manager screen.

John,

I was able to reproduce the problem. I am working on it. There's
something not right about the way the transfer of XML definitions is
being handled between the client and server. I am cleaning that code
up.

Thanks Utkarsh.

For now I've dropped back to 3.10 as I need stuff for a tutorial, once that's out of the way I can offer some help tracking down the problems (assuming you've not already fixed them by then).

John,

I was able to reproduce the problem. I am working on it. There's
something not right about the way the transfer of XML definitions is
being handled between the client and server. I am cleaning that code
up.

Unfortunately, a cursory glance did not turn up a test in ParaView for the
particle tracer plugin itself.

VTKLargeData can be found via this page:
  http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_Datasets

In it you can find particle data used to test the SLAC plugin see:

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/testSummary.php?project=9&name=SLACParticleReader&date=2011-05-30,
but
not necessarily particle tracing, and it does not hold the data that John
was referring to in that post.

Takuya,

Your problem may be related to an issue recently posted on the list by
John Biddiscombe, titled "custom filters missing from menus". I am
looking into the issue.

John,

I've committed a fix for this issue on the stage
(12240_cleanup_proxy_definition_manager). Can you please test it out
if you get the chance? It should fix the proxies definitions not
showing up for auto-loaded plugins issue.

So I pulled the stage branch 12240_cleanup_proxy_definition_manager
mentioned in another post, rebuilt ParaView and the plugin is working
again. Thanks!

Message-ID: <20110531.112030.145496176.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I've got another problem with the client server mode when trying to
connecting/disconnecting to pvservers multiple times. Try this:

1. File->Connect...
2. Choose a properly configured entry from the "Choose a servrer:" list
3. File->Disconnect
4. File->Connect...
5. Choose a properly configured entry from the "Choose a servrer:" list

Then pvserver doesn't start. Both the
12240_cleanup_proxy_definition_manager branch and the git master has
the problem but the console logs are different.

(12240_cleanup_proxy_definition_manager)
Unknown server type:  "" 

(git master)
Multiple server connections not supported yet. 
Requesting to remove a non-added server.

Dear Sebastien,

hello, thank you for reply. I understand SOURCE_DIR equals ParaViewWeb.
And I will explain my operation.

I use cmake istead of ccmake because ccmake doesn't work in my environment.
So I modified "CMakeLists.txt" of "ParaVIewWeb" as follows.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#          ParaView Web Visualisation @ Kitware
#

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)
set(ACTIVEMQ_CPP "/usr/local/lib/libactivemq-cpp.so")
set(ACTIVEMQ_INCLUDE_DIR "/usr/local/include/activemq-cpp-3.1.0/")
set(BUILD_PW_SERVER "ON")
set(BUILD_TESTING "ON")
set(BUILD_WEB_SERVICE "OFF")
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Debug")
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "../install-pw")
set(ParaView_DIR "../build-paraview")
project(PARAVIEW_WEB)
:
:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These "set" operations seem to work well in "ParaView build" process, 
but in "build-pw" process, messages are as follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[root at yshimizu1 build-pw]# cmake ../ParaViewWeb

CMake Error at ParaViewAdapter/CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  Could not find module FindParaView.cmake or a configuration file for
  package ParaView.

  Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find FindParaView.cmake or set ParaView_DIR to
  the directory containing a CMake configuration file for ParaView.  The file
  will have one of the following names:

    ParaViewConfig.cmake
    paraview-config.cmake



CMake Error at ParaViewAdapter/CMakeLists.txt:12 (include):
  include called with wrong number of arguments.  Include only takes one
  file.


CMake Error at ParaViewAdapter/CMakeLists.txt:50 (add_paraview_plugin):
  Unknown CMake command "add_paraview_plugin".


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess... in this case, setting variable operations are wrong... If so, 
please let me know the right way to set variable.

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Subject: [Paraview] Holes in animation when generating animatioin on Win7
Message-ID: <BANLkTikmxMjwY1K_=FHj7PT1_qpk27RkEA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaView Team,

I have the same problem as Ricardo Canelas reported on
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-April/020795.html :
Saving an animation to avi doesn't work on my win7 64bit computer
runnung ParaView 3.10.1 64-bit.
I then tried to save jpgs and transform them into a video file myself.
But here the next problem arised:
The jpgs  (or tifs) have "holes". The first few frames are ok but then
it seems like certain areas are just not rendered. Is there any
solution to that? My mesh is ply file that is about 20MB, has 498310
vertices and 995707 faces.

The temporary solution was to run Paraview on my mac, which works fine
as long as the mesh is not huge.
Important: When saving an animation to an avi on a mac, the framerate
needs to be a power of 2 (1,2,4,8,16,32,..), as David Partyka pointed
out on http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=11923 , otherwise
there's an error "vtkFFMPEGWriter: Error initializing video stream" .
This seems to be another bug, but not such an important one, provided
one knows what framerates work. For the time being, it would be nice
to at least notify the user what framerates do work. I guess I was
just lucky to stumble upon David's solution.

Best regards,
Adrian

Hi Katsumi,

if you have a server X running, you can launch cmake-gui which will
pop-up a graphical application ?
On the other hand, could you explain why ccmake is not working ?

Moreover, use absolute path inside your configuration instead of the
relative ones.
And the error that you are seeing is because you need to point to the
build directory of ParaView so you can build one of the components
needed by ParaViewWeb.

Seb

PS: You shouldn't change anything from the source directory. And if
you use cmake instead of ccmake, it should work in the same way but
less interactively. But the file that you can change inside the build
directory is the CMakeCache.txt...

Interesting, I could not reproduce the problem. Are the server-configs
that you are trying to connect also staring the pvserver process? Can
you post the server config you're trying to use? Maybe I can try to
reproduce the problem with that server config.

Hi David

Thanks for the pointer! I downloaded the datasets and attempted to use the
Particle Tracer plugin on them anyway, but did not get it working.

Does anyone has any pointers on how to make a pvd file work with the
Particle Tracer plugin? I have a pvd file of this format:
http://www.vtk.org/pipermail/vtkusers/2004-June/074341.html

We tried encoding the actual time in

*timestep="0"*

but that did not work either.

Yes I am starting pvservers from the server config as attached.

And now I noticed that I don't have the problem if I start pvservers
manually from the command line and let the client connect to the
pvservers.

Both these issues should now be addressed. I could reproduce (1),
however a fix has been committed for (2). Now server-side plugins are
loaded before serverAdded() gets fired.

If you have PyQt4, you could do this:

[w for w in QtGui.QApplication.topLevelWidgets() if type(w) ==

Hello,

I am using paraview to examine models relating to the solidification of
metallic alloys. I would like to add a time-dependent parameter similar to
AnnotateTime Source that uses as input a text file with, in column 1 the
time, and in column 2 the time-dependent Numeric Value.

Does anyone have ideas as to how to do this?
Thank you

Subject: [Paraview] paraview with NVIDA gpu's? (for superquadric glyphs)
Message-ID: <4DE59000.3090809@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,
i am currently running pvserver on a computer with 4-core Cpu and 4 
Tesla C1060 gpu cards.
My question was:
1)does paraview use the graphics card for rendering only or also for 
processing (computing)?
2) I am guessing it is the former. If so, is it possible to use CUDA to 
use gpu's to speedup the computation? (I am using the superquadric glyph 
filters (http://www.itk.org/Wiki/User_Created_Plugins), and i wanted to 
speed that up) In particular, will PV compile with the nvidia C compiler 
(Has anyone done this?) so that i can use the CUDA code in it?

Thanks in advance,
Pratik

Thanks Andy.
I have attached one typical nc file that I use for ocean models.
Shown below is the plot at a particular time using ncbrowse.
How do I access netcdf readers. Are they plugins or different netcdf file formats I see in open dialog box when I tried to load an nc file?
It will be convenient if we can have one reader like ncbrowse which can access all types of netcdf files.

Regards,
Venkat

Hi,

There are several NetCDF readers in ParaView.  The problem is that NetCDF isn't a single file format but a method/library for storing and retrieving data.  A convention must be specified to figure out how to interpret that data. What convention is your file?  You can do "ncdump -h <filename>" to see a brief description of what's in the file.  If you send the file (if it's under 10mb) or include the output from that I may have an idea of which NetCDF reader may work for you.
