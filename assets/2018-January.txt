Subject: [Paraview] Updated OpenFOAMReader supporting OpenFOAM 5.x

It looks like there are some issues preventing us from reviewing/merging
this patch, as I mentioned on the merge request here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/3750

Once those are addressed we can do a more thorough code review/testing
cycle.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] How to plot selection over time of slice
Message-ID: <CAHyF3oiCEcK51CZh5mnZLL8HH43kyThgH9vXeeqeDM426p-ADw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
   I have a simulation where I have exported the inlets and outlets of a
domain. I was able to use a box clip for each inlet/outlet, calculate the
flux through each face, integrate, and then plot selection over time. I was
able to plot flow overt time. (this worked)

steps that work:
1) box clip the portion of the slice of interest
2) calculator to get flux
3) integrate variables
4) plot selection overtime

However, the problem I am having now, is that I want to take multiple slice
locations and do the same thing, however when i do the following.

1) create slice
2) box clip the portion of the slice of interest
3) calculator to get flux
4) integrate variables
5) plot selection overtime

There is no output. It's clear that the slice operation is doing something
different or I am missing a step such that I can't select the entity of
interest.


Regards,
  ~Kurt

Subject: [Paraview] Confirming that pvserver runs with OSMesa + OpenSWR

Hi Fabrizio,

in the shell where you launch your pvserver you could set the following 
environment variables:

    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 GALLIUM_DRIVER=swr

this is bash syntax, your shell may be different. When I do that I see 
"SWR detected AVX" print in that shell when the connection to paraview 
client is made.

Subject: [Paraview] n-D reader wanted
Message-ID: <CABaWRZYaMUZOrnE_3LQWUym83DMPDeoRaZ0rmQxKa5N-92ECsA@mail.gmail.com>

Prior to writing one, I?m interested to see if someone has done this
previously. I have n-D rectilinear, structured data (usually 4-10D) with a
small number of dependent variables. We?re adding output code to our apps
that will create vtkTable files for the results. What I would like is a
paraview source object to read the data, allow the user to select which
n<=3 dimensions are of interest and then output the appropriate subset in
the rectilinear structured form consumable within paraview.



This seems like a straightforward object, so I assuming there is a chance
someone has already written one.



Thanks for pointers, thoughts, comments.

Hi,

I am trying to read a pvtk file with data store in vtk file. when I read it
on my own local computer, paraview will always crash. but when I read it by
using paraview on remote supercomputer, it works. May I ask why? I used a
MPI supported version in my local computer. did I miss something in my

I don't think so. the test file is not big. and I check the memory usage of
paraview on remote machine, it is only 500MB. and My local machine should
have enough memory space.

Yangguang,

If the file size is not too big and you are using the Kitware build of ParaView, here are 2 other things you might want to check (although they seem less likely than what you already checked).

Corrupt files. Make sure the files did not get corrupted when you copied them to your local computer. Check that the file sizes are the same. Also, try running a hash function (like md5) at each location and make sure they are the same.

Bad filenames. Windows file systems are a bit more restrictive than Linux file systems when it comes to allowable characters. If you have a strange character in a filename, that might be enough to crash the program when it tries to open it.

If you can verify that the files are identical on both systems and all files have ordinary names, then I have no idea what the problem could be.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Error about reading .pvtk file

Hi,

I am trying to read a pvtk file with data store in vtk file. when I read it on my own local computer, paraview will always crash. but when I read it by using paraview on remote supercomputer, it works. May I ask why? I used a MPI supported version in my local computer. did I miss something in my build?

Subject: [Paraview] About Paraview on TACC Maverick
Message-ID: <CAGRwkcEcyc9vxBkkabMJ6rLuo95CVDkK2inSAoTLJt3wwOxhkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Does anyone use paraview on TACC Maverick before. Can we have access to the
paraview build so we can add our own plugin to it? or  I can download
paraview source and build my own version on Maverick?

There are two version of paraview on Maverick, 4.3.1 and 5.4.1, I only use
4.3.1 to run paraview in parallel mode, anyone know if there is a way to
run 5.4.1 in parallel mode?
Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashes with XDMF3 Reader
Message-ID: <CAJ-2Sz0_UBA+52BAaw_KDE1a=naoBE+3bYcRJ0fFn+cioVwHRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When I try to open XDMF files, ParaView crashes when I use the XDMF3 Reader.
It seems to load fine with the classical "XDMF Reader".

I've had this issue with the following version of ParaView :
- Paraview 5.4.1 under Windows 7
- Paraview 5.0.1 under Linux 64

I've open a ticket in the bug tracker with a test case to reproduce this
problem:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17871

Could you clarify which limitations come with the new XDMF3 reader ?

Thanks.

Best place to ask would be TACC's helpdesk.

https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu login and then open a consulting ticket on
the top right.

They won't necessarily see/answer questions on this paraview mailing list,
will be the intimately familiar with the installs and resources at TACC,
and will generally be quite helpful.

Hi,

I will bump my own post from a month back (see below) and just will answer the
question in case anyone else was looking for something similar. I haven't found
a way to remotely navigate the file system through ParaView Python API objects,
but of course there are other Python packages which can achieve that. I used
paramiko. Below is my minimal example.


    from paraview.simple import LegacyVTKReader, RenameSource, Connect
    from paramiko import SSHClient, AutoAddPolicy

    '''
    This script extracts the output of a remote ls command with to feed into
    a LegacyVTKReader. The main use is it to make a collection of VTK files 
    into a time sequence inside PV.
    '''

    # Inputs:
    host = 'remote.host.com'
    port = 22
    username = 'me'
    key_filename = '/path/to/private/key'

    pvhost = 'localhost'    # I typically run pvserver through an ssh tunnel so
    pvport = 22227          # these are the parameters for local port forward

    data_dir = '/path/to/data/on/remote'

    # SSH part
    # to get a list of files to open
    client = SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(AutoAddPolicy())

    client.connect(
        host, port=port,
        username=username,
        key_filename=key_filename)

    stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command(
        'ls -1 {0}'.format(data_dir))
    lslines = stdout.readlines()
    client.close()

    # ParaView part
    Connect('localhost', 22227)
    reader = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=[
         'data/{0}'.format(l.strip()) for l in lslines])
    RenameSource('source', reader)

Hope this helps someone!

Dear all

How can I plot the average over time of only the threshold cells? It should
only average the cells that are within the threshold.

Thanks a lot!

Robert,

Sorry I missed the email earlier. What you have as an alternative is
indeed a reasonable approach. Once can also use ParaView's
infrastructure used by the file dialog, but it's a little clunky
currently, since it needs to be pythonified for easier user.

Here's how you'd do this with 5.4.1.

from paraview import servermanager as sm

helper = sm.misc.FileInformationHelper()
helper.DirectoryListing = 1
helper.WorkingDirecotry = "'/path/to/data/on/remote"

pvinfo = servermanager.vtkPVFileInformation()
helper.GatherInformation(pvinfo)
for a_pvinfo in pvinfo.GetConents():
   if a_pvinfo.GetType() == a_pvinfo.FILE_GROUP:
     for b_pvinfo in a_pvinfo.GetContents():
        assert b_pvinfo.GetType() == b_pvinfo.SINGLE_FILE
        print (b_pvinfo.GetName(),  b_pvinfo.GetFullPath())
   elif a_pvinfo.GetType() ==  a_pvinfo.SINGLE_FILE
      print (a_pvinfo.GetName(),  a_pvinfo.GetFullPath())

This will print all files in the directory.

See vtkPVFileInformation docs
(https://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/classvtkPVFileInformation.html)
for more API details.

Hope that helps.

Hi,

I used some vtkOpenGL class in my plugin. When I developed in my own
machine, I have paraview source which has vtkOpenGL.cmake that I can use to
include header file I need. but when I try to compile my plugin on
Maverick, it only has release paraview, which doesn't have such .cmake
file. but Maverick does have VTK installed. How should I modify my
cmakelists.txt to include vtkOpengl lib.
Thanks.

Doesn't your plugin need other classes from VTK/ParaView? If so, you
can't mix and match. I am afraid you'll have to build ParaView from
source and then compile the plugin against it.

I see, yes, I will use some classes in Paraview/VTK, which mean if your
plugin use inside source you will need to build your own paraview to run it?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CAGRwkcGa_JtqCRZrYqRO7OkzQvN6nUh=KV7C_YNe27sUw3TmCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Anyone has experience build paraview on TACC Maverick or other clusters
before? I need to build my own paraview. I use superbuild to build
paraview. but everytime it stop at the step of configure paraview due to
GCC version is lower than 4.6. Maverick does have GCC 4.9 and 5.4 installed
and also have intel icc and icpc installed. When I try to change
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to high verion GCC it still detect GCC is lower than
4.6. Even when I try to use icc to compile it still detects GCC lower
version error. No idea how to fix. I know I should probably ask Maverick
system admin. Just wonder if anybody happen to know this issue.
Thanks.

Hello,

I am trying to compile Paraview 5.4 in MacOS 10.13.2 (High Sierra), using software from MacPorts 2.4.2. After a successful configuration, 
the make -j 4 command give the following error:

/Users/sergiogalembeck/paraview_install/ParaView/VTK/ThirdParty/xdmf2/vtkxdmf2/libsrc/XdmfDsmComm.cxx:55:18: error:

    if(Msg->Data <= 0 ){

How can I solve this problem?

Best regards,

It's kind of a quirk of CMake, but once CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER is set by
the initial CMake configuration, you can't change it. So what should
you do?

The solution is to set an environment variable named
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER in your shell prior to running CMake for the first
time. Set that variable to the path of version of gcc or icc you want
to use, and that should do it. You may also need to set
CMAKE_C_COMPILER as well.

HTH,
Cory

Sergio,

This problem was fixed in November 2016, so I am surprised you are
running into it. Current ParaView master includes VTK that contains
the commit

    [bugfix] Invalid pointer comparisons.

    The code was performing a null pointer check
    using (void*)Data <= 0 instead of Data == NULL
    (or nullptr). This results in a compilation
    error with clang trunk (future clang 4.0).

Make sure you have run `git submodule update` to ensure your VTK is up to date.

Thanks for both of your suggestions. I have now looked at them and they both
look pretty good to me. I'll practice with these solutions and see which one I

Actually I find the easiest way to do it is, assuming you have icc in your path, to set the CC and CXX environment variables on the command of the first run of cmake (or ccmake or cmake-gui, whichever one you are using). So the start of your build would be something like this:

mkdir paraview-build
cd paraview-build
CC=icc CXX=icc cmake ../paraview

That should ignore gcc. (Remember, you have to delete all of any build files you have created so far and start over. Once CMake picks a compiler, you cannot change it without starting over.)

Ah, that's right, Ken. It has been a while since I have done this, but
you are right that setting CC and CXX is the way to do it.

Dear community,


When I try to scale cylindrical glyph objects by a 'Scalar', it scales both the radius and height of the glyphs.

Is there a way to scale the radius by a Scalar1, and the height be a Scalar2?


I have an unstructured grid, and for each point I want to create a cylinder that can have an arbitrary radius and height.

I thought Glyphs would be the way to go, but I'm kind of stuck with this issue.


Any help is much appreciated; or if you can recommend a different way to achieve the above-mentioned please let me know!


Best,

Ahmad

Hello,

I want to extract the output from a Glyph filter into a spreadsheet. I want the coordinates of the origin of each glyph and its components so I can plot the same vectors using matplotlib.quiver capability. I tried to do this using the Spreadsheet view, but I ran into some issues:
- First, even that the Glyph only shows a subset of all points (using the Masking option), the spreadsheet view actually contains the entire data set.
- Second, the scaling is not reflected in the components of the field GlyphVector in the spreadsheet view, but it is reflected in the field Points, in a way that is not easy to reason.

How could I get around these two issues to get to my goal? What is the meaning of the field Points in the Glyph filter?

Thanks
Miguel

Ok, I see that the Points field represent the points of the Glyph object. For instance, if we are using 2D Glyph as the Glyph type, there will be 4 entries in the Spreadsheet view with the same GlyphVector field, but different Point values. These 4 points represent the points used to draw the arrow (2 for the shaft and 2 for the head). There are more points for the regular arrow (it?s a 3D object).

Subject: [Paraview] Glyphs and spreadsheets

Hello,

I want to extract the output from a Glyph filter into a spreadsheet. I want the coordinates of the origin of each glyph and its components so I can plot the same vectors using matplotlib.quiver capability. I tried to do this using the Spreadsheet view, but I ran into some issues:
- First, even that the Glyph only shows a subset of all points (using the Masking option), the spreadsheet view actually contains the entire data set.
- Second, the scaling is not reflected in the components of the field GlyphVector in the spreadsheet view, but it is reflected in the field Points, in a way that is not easy to reason.

How could I get around these two issues to get to my goal? What is the meaning of the field Points in the Glyph filter?

Thanks
Miguel

Following up on my own question, I found out that if I scale by "Vector Components" it is possible to change the length of the cylinders with the second vector index, and the radius with the first and third. I need to rearrange my attribute data as such: [radius_x, length, radius_z]. If I keep radius_x == radius_z, then the cylinder will not deform, and the cross section stays a perfect circle. See the image in the attachment please.


BUT the problem here is that "vector components" also affects the orientation of my cylindrical glyphs. I can turn this off in the properties menu, but I need to orient my cylinders based on another vector attribute data...


I feel I'm getting somewhere, but if someone could give me an idea on how to now orient my glyphs with another vector data than the one I use now for scaling, that would be much appreciated!

Best,
Ahmad

Onderwerp: Scaling cylinder glyph's radius and height individually


Dear community,


When I try to scale cylindrical glyph objects by a 'Scalar', it scales both the radius and height of the glyphs.

Is there a way to scale the radius by a Scalar1, and the height be a Scalar2?


I have an unstructured grid, and for each point I want to create a cylinder that can have an arbitrary radius and height.

I thought Glyphs would be the way to go, but I'm kind of stuck with this issue.


Any help is much appreciated; or if you can recommend a different way to achieve the above-mentioned please let me know!


Best,

Ahmad

Jairaj,

I?m not sure what exactly you mean by ?the threshold,? but there are many ways to plot the average of a threshold-selection of cells over time.

The most straightforward way is to open up the Find Data dialog box, select the cells you want to plot, and then create a Plot Selection Over Time filter. Specifically, here are steps that will do such a plot:


  1.  Open your data in ParaView. Apply.
  2.  Open the Find Data dialog box (Edit ? Find Data or click the toolbar button on the top toolbar).
  3.  In the top row, set the left combo box to either ?Cell(s)? or ?Point(s)? depending on whether your data is cell or point data. In the longer combo box to the right, make sure that your data is selected.
  4.  In the second row, set the left combo box to the field you want to threshold on. Change the next combo box to say ?is between?. This will create to text edit boxes where you enter the minimum and maximum values of your threshold range.
  5.  Click the ?Run Selection Query? button. This will select all cells or points matching your threshold.
  6.  Click the ?Plot Selection Over Time? at the bottom of the Find Data dialog box. This will create a filter in the pipeline browser.
  7.  Close the Find Data dialog box and click the Apply button.

Dear all

How can I plot the average over time of only the threshold cells? It should only average the cells that are within the threshold.

Thanks a lot!

Message-ID: <CAH8S-AhXQc8ijkp0E9wLy+r=NG3_E9Arm+8QQL7a85ekDP7Few@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I use ParaView to visualize data of our simulations using the Unstructured
Grid data format. Up until ParaView 4.x everything worked fine: we
typically visualize one set of data files as Surfaces and another as
Wireframe. The Wireframe dataset refers to "fracture lines" in our
simulations.

See below how the simulation looked like in PV version 4.x. You could
clearly see the line around the boundaries of the model.

[image: Inline image 1]

However, in PV 5.x the lines are not fully visualized as if they're hidden
below the other data object:

[image: Inline image 2]

I've tried a few versions of 5.x but they all behave similarly.

Does anyone know what might be going on here? Is this a bug / removed
featured from the new version or should I do something different with 5.x?
I've noticed that this issue does not happen consistently. I've seen the
issue on both Linux Mint 17.3 (64 bit) and Ubuntu

I've attached two example VTU files. Please visualize the second file as
Wireframe (_broken_joint). Below are two large VTU files.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzt4jq1wbwfua4j/out.zip?dl=0

Can someone else reproduce this issue?

I'd really hope to start using ParaView 5 since it finally has the
long-missing Reload Files options!

Thank you,
Omid

Omid,

I am unable to replicate your issue in ParaView 5.4.1. When I loaded your data and showed the broken_joint data in wireframe, I was clearly able to see the lines of broken_joint over the polygons of basic. (See the attached image.)

The problem you are getting is likely caused by z-buffer fighting in the rendering. This happens when two objects are the exact same distance from the viewer, as I believe is the case in your data. Wanting to draw lines on top of polygons is common enough that there are some corrections to help the rendering determine what to draw in front. Perhaps by changing the settings on resolving coincident topology will resolve your issue. You can find them by opening the ParaView settings dialog (Edit ? Settings), clicking on the Render View tab, and turning on the advanced options. The options you are looking for are ?Resolve Coincident Topology,? ?Polygon Offset Parameters?, and ?Z Shift.?

Another, possibly easier, solution it to simply move the lines of the broken_joint data closer to the camera. Click the broken_joint object and add the Transform filter. Change the Translate parameter to 0, 0, 1 and apply. That should shift the wireframe forward enough to see it properly.

Just want to add that a programmatic (C++) solution is preferred rather than using the GUI

I have a C++ pipeline where I can set the properties of the cylinder glyph with vtkSMPropertyHelper.

I have looked in filters.xml under vtkPVGlyphFilter source proxy (file located in <paraview_home>/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources) to see what my options are, but there is only one "SetInputArrayToProcess" that takes a vector attribute as input; nothing about a vector specifically for orientation..

Suggestions on how to handle this issue, are very welcome; other approaches than mine as well!

Onderwerp: Reading group of pvti files: vtkImageData is static over time


Hello,


I have a vtkImageData object that I write (with a XMLPImageDataWriter) every time step to a pvti file.

When I open the group of output_*.pvti files, properties like X, Y, Z extent and range do not change as I animate over time.

But when I open the actual files I can see that these values in fact are different.


And if I open the files individually (for example output_99.pvti) these properties are displayed correctly in ParaView.

The problem appears when I open them as a group; it then keeps the properties of the first file.


Does anyone else has this issue, and is there a way to solve this?

Hi Ahmad,

Alas, reading the code of vtkGlyph3D, you cannot orient by a vector
array different from the vector array used to do the scaling using the
functionality in ParaView. You would have to modify either
vtkPVGlyphFilter or its parent class vtkGlyph3D, to do this, and
expose the new VTK class through a ParaView plugin [1]. A simple
modification would be to add a ScaleMode, say VTK_SCALE_BY_NORMAL, to
vtkGlyph3D, and then set the active normals in your data set to the
vector by which you wish to scale. Then the "vectors" property could
control the orientation and the active normals would control the
scale. That's kind of kludgey, but it would be a fairly fast
modification to make.

HTH,
Cory

Hello,

I wonder if there is any option to change SIZE of the glyphs (arrows or
spheres)? They look enormously large and tend block each other on my scalar
data set while using Glyph option.

I will appreciate any tip.

Reduce the value of the "Scale Factor" property in the Glyph filter to
reduce the glyph size.

Yes, modify the Rotate property of the Glyph filter. Setting the
Rotation to [0, 90, 0] should point the glyphs down the negative z
axis.

 Visualize Stretch as Geometric Change in Mesh
Message-ID: <CA+ECd_qddLMZvWnXMVE2V9cB3efDRA6C46=WLZyU13FBjgm8TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, this is my first time posting to paraview-users, and I am wondering how
to visualize displacements by changes in the mesh rather than field
quantities (for attached file, px and py, displacements in x and y
coordinates).

Is this possible in paraview?  How so?  Thanks!

Charlie,

You can use the Warp by Vector filter to warp the points in your data
set according to a vector field. To get that vector field from your
p_x and p_y scalar arrays, it is convenient to use the Python
Calculator with the expression

make_vector(p_x, p_y, np.zeros(p_x.shape))

Apply the Python Calculator filter to your data set, then add a Warp
by Vector filter off the Python Calculator filter. Set the Vectors
property to "result", the default name of the array produced by the
Python Calculator.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Replying back to the list so that others may benefit from and
contribute to the conversation.

Rotate is an advanced property. To show advanced properties, look in
the Properties panel. Click the gear icon to the right of the text box
that says "Search ...". You can also search for "Rotate" in that text
box.

HTH,
Cory

Dear ParaView team,

I read a post at the ParaView website concerning variables and different 
time steps (see 
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2014-May/031054.html). I 
have a similar problem and I want to access values from different time 
steps using the programmable filter with multiple inputs. I 
unfortunately have no idea how to access other time steps using the 
programmable filter. Could you give me some advice or a hint where I can 
find detailed information about that issue? I would be very happy if you 
could help me.

Best regards,
Carolin.

The easiest way to do such a thing is as follows:

1. Apply Extract TimeSteps filter to your reader/source to choose the
timesteps of interest.
2. Apply Group TimeSteps filter to it to group the timesteps extracted
in (1) into a mutliblock dataset with 1 block for each selected
timestep in order.
3. Now add your programmable filter to (2) and you can access all
timesteps of interest as blocks in your input.

You can skip (1) if you want to use all timesteps, and not just a subset.

Hi Ken,
Thanks for the detailed reply. I could not get anything out of the settings
dialog as per your suggestion. Did you have a combination of those settings
that might work for my files?

I can also see the image you sent; that's usually fine. However, I
typically apply a Threshold filter to the _basic_ files (Scalar: alive;
min: 0.1; max: 1). In this case, the _basic_ object is always drawn in
front of the _broken_joint_ object.

In addition, I visualize dozens of these files every day so Transforming
every single object is a bit tedious.

Thank you,
Omid

Omid,

Even after applying the Threshold filter, I cannot replicate your problem. I?ve tried on both ParaView 5.2 and 5.4. Both work fine for me.

My settings are the default. ?Resolve Coincident Topology? is set to ?Shift z-buffer when rendering lines and points?. ?Z Shift? is set to 0.002. (Polygon offset should not matter in this mode.) You could try increasing the Z Shift to fix the problem. Note that you have to restart ParaView in order for these options to take effect.

It is possible that there is some quirk with the rendering system on your computer that does not implement the topology resolution. Do you happen to have another computer on which you can try to run this? I also noted that if I turn on OSPRay rendering, I do get the missing line issue you describe. There might be other display/rendering parameters that cause issues. But the defaults should be fine, so unless you have done some tinkering you should be OK.

I am unable to replicate your issue in ParaView 5.4.1. When I loaded your data and showed the broken_joint data in wireframe, I was clearly able to see the lines of broken_joint over the polygons of basic. (See the attached image.)

The problem you are getting is likely caused by z-buffer fighting in the rendering. This happens when two objects are the exact same distance from the viewer, as I believe is the case in your data. Wanting to draw lines on top of polygons is common enough that there are some corrections to help the rendering determine what to draw in front. Perhaps by changing the settings on resolving coincident topology will resolve your issue. You can find them by opening the ParaView settings dialog (Edit ? Settings), clicking on the Render View tab, and turning on the advanced options. The options you are looking for are ?Resolve Coincident Topology,? ?Polygon Offset Parameters?, and ?Z Shift.?

Another, possibly easier, solution it to simply move the lines of the broken_joint data closer to the camera. Click the broken_joint object and add the Transform filter. Change the Translate parameter to 0, 0, 1 and apply. That should shift the wireframe forward enough to see it properly.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] ParaView 5.x not showing all objects available in Pipeline Browser

Hi,
I use ParaView to visualize data of our simulations using the Unstructured Grid data format. Up until ParaView 4.x everything worked fine: we typically visualize one set of data files as Surfaces and another as Wireframe. The Wireframe dataset refers to "fracture lines" in our simulations.
See below how the simulation looked like in PV version 4.x. You could clearly see the line around the boundaries of the model.

[Inline image 1]
However, in PV 5.x the lines are not fully visualized as if they're hidden below the other data object:

[Inline image 2]
I've tried a few versions of 5.x but they all behave similarly.
Does anyone know what might be going on here? Is this a bug / removed featured from the new version or should I do something different with 5.x? I've noticed that this issue does not happen consistently. I've seen the issue on both Linux Mint 17.3 (64 bit) and Ubuntu
I've attached two example VTU files. Please visualize the second file as Wireframe (_broken_joint). Below are two large VTU files.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzt4jq1wbwfua4j/out.zip?dl=0

Can someone else reproduce this issue?

I'd really hope to start using ParaView 5 since it finally has the long-missing Reload Files options!
Thank you,
Omid

Subject: [Paraview] CS Wrapper for plugins ignores preprocessor variable
Message-ID: <ce41c199af36431bb67570ae919035cc@impromptu.visus.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hello ParaView community,

while programming a ParaView filter I encountered a problem with the CS wrapping. In the following I will describe the problem. The ParaView version I am currently using is 5.3.0.

In my project I created a filter that has one of two possible outputs, depending on a preprocessor variable. The idea behind this is, that there is a define "_DETAILED" that can be set via cmake. If it is not defined, a vtkRectilinearGrid is created. It it is defined, the plugin outputs a multiblock data set with an additional polydata object.

The problem now is that the generation of the MyPluginClientServer.cxx doesn't account for the preprocessor variable and just takes the last defined algorithm. In my case, this means that in the MyPluginClientServer.cxx file the line is always written as
const char* commandName = "vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm";
This leads to a runtime error when applying the filter because it erroneously tries to downcast the plugin to the wrong algorithm data type.

Here the error message:
ERROR: In T:\paraview\source\ParaView-v5.3.0\ParaViewCore\ServerImplementation\Core\vtkPVSessionCore.cxx, line 371
vtkPVSessionCore (000001D0D3633550): Cannot cast MyPlugin object to vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm.  This probably means the class specifies the incorrect superclass in vtkTypeMacro.
while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = vtk_object_pointer {MyPlugin (000001D080685680)}
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetInputConnection}
  Argument 2 = vtk_object_pointer {vtkAlgorithmOutput (000001D0E3D49AB0)}

The following is how I create the plugin class:
[...]
#ifdef _DETAILED
// Create multi block data set for additional output as polydata
#include "vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm.h"

class VTK_EXPORT MyPlugin : public vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm
{
public:
       static MyPlugin* New();
       vtkTypeMacro(MyPlugin, vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm);
#else
// Create rectilinear grid
#include "vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm.h"

class VTK_EXPORT MyPlugin : public vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm
{
public:
       static MyPlugin* New();
       vtkTypeMacro(MyPlugin, vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm);
#endif
[...]

The work-around so far is to manually edit the MyPluginClientServer.cxx file to use the correct algorithm base class. This however is very unpractical as the code is supposed to be distributed to others. As I don't have enough knowledge of the inner workings of ParaView, especially the wrapping that is done, I don't know where or how to fix this. I would be glad if someone was able to help me with this issue.

Kind regards,
Alex

Two approaches:

1. put the two is separate headers and pick the approach header based
on if _DETAILED was defined at cmake configure time.
2. change header as follows:

#ifndef __VTK_WRAP__
#ifdef __DETAILED
#define vtkAlgorithm vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm
#else
#define vtkAlgorithm vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm
#endif
#endif

class ... MyPlugin: public vtkAlgorithm
{
   static MyPlugin* New();
   vtkTypeMacro(MyPlugin, vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm);
#ifndef __VTK_WRAP__
#undef vtkAlgorithm
#endif

};

Here, the wrapper will not provide any API on the the real superclass
but most likely, you only care about API in vtkAlgorithm to be
wrapped. See vtkFloatArray as an example on how this is done.

Carolin,

Check this post out:
https://blog.kitware.com/improved-vtk-numpy-integration-part-5/

The input to your filter as a vtkMultiBlockDataSet with each block
being a timestep, you can access individual arrays as described in the
post or you can use the following approach:

from paraview.vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
dataset_time0 = dsa.WrapDataObject(inputs[0].GetBlock(0))
dataset_time1 = dsa.WrapDataObject(inputs[0].GetBlock(1))

etc.

Hi Ken

This is EXACTLY what I wanted! Thank you so much. Is it possible to create
a custom filter to do this, so that I dont have to follow these steps?

Hi Jairaj,
This is exactly what the 'trace' and python macro functions are for. Take a
look in the Tools menu, and choose Start Trace. If you check the 'show
incremental trace' button you can see it's recording a python script as you
take actions in the GUI. When you've completed your steps, you can choose
'save as python macro' and you'll get a button that can repeat the steps.

To go more in-depth, look for information on python scripting in Paraview!
Regards,
Aron

Cory,

Sorry, I am trying to install Paraview 5.2.0. Even doing 'git submodule update ?init?
the error that I noticed continues.

What do you suggest?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Generating Surface Plot from 2D rectilinear grid +
 scalar value (x, y, f(x, y))
Message-ID: <MWHPR06MB32770D742CF6B72AC8FF041980170@MWHPR06MB3277.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,


I have 2D rectilinear data and associated scalar values at each grid point. I can generate a colorplot in Paraview but would like to make a surface plot that has color and height, where the height represents the magnitude of the scalar. MATLAB's surface plot function surf(x,y,f) is a good example.


I have attached some of my data files as an example. Any help would be appreciated.


Thank you,

Nick Stegmeier

Alas, this fix was made after ParaView 5.2 was released.

If you really need ParaView 5.2 instead of 5.3 or 5.4.1, you can apply
the patch in my previous email to the VTK subdirectory in the ParaView
source code. As you can see, just two lines need to be modified, so
you could easily do this manually.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Nick,

Use the filter "Warp by Scalar" to do this.

Hi Aron

I tried your method and created the trace. When I go to the python shell
and run that python macro, it says that the custom filter I had created
does not exist. My custom filter consists of 2 calculator filters, each
calculating different things. To create that custom filter, I selected both
the calculators on the pipeline browser, right click-> create custom
filter->finish.

To create my python macro, I first load up my .vtu files in the pipeline
browser, hit apply, then I start trace. I add my custom filter, follow
Kenneth's procedure to obtain the plot over time, then I hit Stop trace.
Then in the script generated, file->save as macro.

Hi, Cory,

Sorry for the late reply, no clue why this email came to my trash. I tried
to builld paraview. and the problem is that paraview failed on qt compile
step due to low version of glibc.(which in Maverick is 2.13 and the minimum
is 2.14).
So I also try to get ride of GUI first, and then I successfully build
paraview. but when I want to start a pvserver, the error comes with low
glibcxx version which I think is the same problem with low version glibc in
build.
Do you know how can I fixed this?

Thanks,
Yangguang

Sorry, I was thinking you were building on a Mac with Mavericks
installed, but now I think that is not right. Are you trying to build
on Maverick Meerkat (Ubuntu 10.10)?

Ah, I see.

Make sure the same compiler module is loaded when you compile pvserver
as when you run it. That should ensure a consistent glibc version.

Your local user support or system administrators should also be able
to help with the module system usage on Maverick.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] PV4.1.0 multiple rulers

I have a slice plane with 2 cylinders separated. 

I use rule to measure the length of the re-circulation zone after each cylinder. 
Independently, the ruler shows the distance. When I save the jpg I would like to see both distances on the figure. At the moment I can only see one not both. 
Is there away to see both? 
Hope my question is clear,

Not in 4.1.0. I believe this was fixed in 5.2. 5.2 onwards, you can
create and show multiple rulers.

Subject: [Paraview] custom view plugin - minimal example needed
Message-ID: <CAPN39MUUHkMgpkYv6ULSwkKp3mnNrTK7u3Xan6-6v=d_eYyTHg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear plugin developers,
I need to implement a custom view to present datasets in a detailed
editable format.

This link says that the plugin tutorial is obsolete for the view part:
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_custom_view_.2A_obsolete_.2A

The Examples/Plugins/GUIView suggested in the link doesn't exist. The
Plugins/MantaView is rather complex and doesn't compile due to other bugs
as reported elsewhere, so that I can't get a clue how the MantaView plugin
is supposed to work.

Could some kind developer upload a minimal working view plugin example,
which needs to display only a simple QButton or any other widget? This will
help to allow users build their custom views for ParaView 5.x.y.
Thank you
Kolja

Hello,

Having looked at the docs and explored the UI, I can't tell whether
Paraview can do what I want.  I have some scalar field data on a regular
grid.  I import that into Paraview and then use the Gradient filter to
calculate the gradient of this data.  Now what I want to do is query both
of these data sets and plot the scalar field data only if it falls within a
certain range of values AND its gradient also falls within a certain
range.  I can imagine doing this either by writing a filter to create a
third data set which contains only those points which pass the test, but
neither the Calculator nor the Custom Filter seem to let me do that.  Or I
could create the plot more directly by creating a multivariate transfer
function, but I can't find any way to do that in the UI.  Can Paraview do
this kind of thing from within the UI?

Eventually I will want to add the Laplacian and be able to query all 3
field properties in order to determine what to plot, but for now I thought
I would work on the simpler 2-variable case.

Try typing "v" This should pop-up a panel that will let you select a 
datum subset.

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <CAJbHkX_Mhm_OeC2Uf3TzK_r4uD5Xb_EZKvwKHCg6BQb7V21gJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

I have a user that use intensively xml files to deploy and customise his
python programmable filters.
He would like to know if there is a list with all the xml keyword available
(for filters, readers,writers).
He uses the files in
"./ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/*.xml"  for
inspiration but not actually sure about the potential and limits of the xml
customization.

for info: We use also the wiki  (
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_Categories_to_the_Filters_Menu
)
for inspiration

Felipe,

Unfortunately, there is no one place that documents all the XML
elements and attributes. There is some documentation on property
attributes in [1], but I'm not sure this is an exhaustive list. Your
user is doing one of the most effective things already, looking for
desired functionality in an existing source/filter and looking at how
it is done in the .xml files.

Digging deeper, one can view the code in the methods ReadXMLAttributes
in the various vtkSM*Proxy classes in ParaView, e.g.,
vtkSMProxy::ReadXMLAttributes [2]., to understand which attributes are
available in different proxies.

Hope that helps,
Cory

I have stripped down Plugin/MantaView until all compilation problems
disappear. What is left, is basically a plugin for a vtkOpenGLRenderer.
The code, consisting of only two minimal classes, is attached and can be
built using:
unzip snippet-viewplugin.zip && mkdir build && cd build && cmake && make
(tested with ParaView 5.4.1)

This brings me back to my initial question. I'd like to show a custom view,
made of a number of Qt widgets (buttons and text) to show important
statistics.
In SnippetView.xml, the view is declared as:
<SnippetViewProxy class="vtkPVSnippetView" ... base_proxygroup="views"
base_proxyname="RenderView" ...

How can I replace 'base_proxyname="RenderView"' by some generic view, to be
filled with widgets? "View" or "ViewBase" are not recognized as base
proxies.
Thank you
Kolja

Hi Ken,
Thanks for your feedback and sorry for my late reply. Somehow I didn't get
this message and only found your reply after searching in my mailbox.

I tried various values for the Z Shift, increasing it by one order of
magnitude until reaching a value of 200, restarting in between changes.
This didn't help.

I haven't really made any other changes in ParaView settings. I even
restored to defaults a couple of times. I've been using Linux Mint 17 and
have also experienced the same issue on Ubuntu 14.04 both 64 bit.

Thanks

Best regards,
Omid

Omid,

The only other thing I can think of is that there is something odd about the OpenGL driver/hardware on your system that for some reason is not supporting the coincident topology resolution in ParaView. ParaView changed its rendering system from OpenGL 1.3 to OpenGL 3.1 in version 5, the version that you report seeing the issue.

Once again, I recommend trying to run ParaView on a completely different computer if you can find access to one. You might also try updating the OpenGL drivers on your computer. Beyond that, I am out of ideas.

My settings are the default. ?Resolve Coincident Topology? is set to ?Shift z-buffer when rendering lines and points?. ?Z Shift? is set to 0.002. (Polygon offset should not matter in this mode.) You could try increasing the Z Shift to fix the problem. Note that you have to restart ParaView in order for these options to take effect.

It is possible that there is some quirk with the rendering system on your computer that does not implement the topology resolution. Do you happen to have another computer on which you can try to run this? I also noted that if I turn on OSPRay rendering, I do get the missing line issue you describe. There might be other display/rendering parameters that cause issues. But the defaults should be fine, so unless you have done some tinkering you should be OK.

Hi Ken,
Thanks for the detailed reply. I could not get anything out of the settings dialog as per your suggestion. Did you have a combination of those settings that might work for my files?
I can also see the image you sent; that's usually fine. However, I typically apply a Threshold filter to the _basic_ files (Scalar: alive; min: 0.1; max: 1). In this case, the _basic_ object is always drawn in front of the _broken_joint_ object.
In addition, I visualize dozens of these files every day so Transforming every single object is a bit tedious.
Thank you,
Omid

Omid,

I am unable to replicate your issue in ParaView 5.4.1. When I loaded your data and showed the broken_joint data in wireframe, I was clearly able to see the lines of broken_joint over the polygons of basic. (See the attached image.)

The problem you are getting is likely caused by z-buffer fighting in the rendering. This happens when two objects are the exact same distance from the viewer, as I believe is the case in your data. Wanting to draw lines on top of polygons is common enough that there are some corrections to help the rendering determine what to draw in front. Perhaps by changing the settings on resolving coincident topology will resolve your issue. You can find them by opening the ParaView settings dialog (Edit ? Settings), clicking on the Render View tab, and turning on the advanced options. The options you are looking for are ?Resolve Coincident Topology,? ?Polygon Offset Parameters?, and ?Z Shift.?

Another, possibly easier, solution it to simply move the lines of the broken_joint data closer to the camera. Click the broken_joint object and add the Transform filter. Change the Translate parameter to 0, 0, 1 and apply. That should shift the wireframe forward enough to see it properly.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] ParaView 5.x not showing all objects available in Pipeline Browser

Hi,
I use ParaView to visualize data of our simulations using the Unstructured Grid data format. Up until ParaView 4.x everything worked fine: we typically visualize one set of data files as Surfaces and another as Wireframe. The Wireframe dataset refers to "fracture lines" in our simulations.
See below how the simulation looked like in PV version 4.x. You could clearly see the line around the boundaries of the model.

[nline image 1]
However, in PV 5.x the lines are not fully visualized as if they're hidden below the other data object:

[nline image 2]
I've tried a few versions of 5.x but they all behave similarly.
Does anyone know what might be going on here? Is this a bug / removed featured from the new version or should I do something different with 5.x? I've noticed that this issue does not happen consistently. I've seen the issue on both Linux Mint 17.3 (64 bit) and Ubuntu
I've attached two example VTU files. Please visualize the second file as Wireframe (_broken_joint). Below are two large VTU files.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzt4jq1wbwfua4j/out.zip?dl=0

Can someone else reproduce this issue?

I'd really hope to start using ParaView 5 since it finally has the long-missing Reload Files options!
Thank you,
Omid

I have a user that wants to use the equivalent of the Material Interface Filter on VTK files.  Is there a way to do this?  I did find the Connectivity filter, that gets me half way.  I then want to find the mass of these individual fragments.

To test, I used Wavelet, the Clip by Sphere, then made the Radius 15, then ran the connectivity filter.

Is it possible to write a plugin that derives from vtkPVView instead of
vtkPVRenderView?

I don't know how I can further shorten my question. The answer is quite
important to decide whether we can continue our ParaView developments.

 renderviews
Message-ID: <CALVockf8rDU2KrNyQ=oPeYS3NTb7KLMUOTvUmj+L+s4_h+ALUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I want to compare two vtk files by having two render views and dump these
two renderviews into a single image file. The py script recorded by trace
works from GUI but not from the command line using pvpython. Using pvpython
the second renderview has no data and there is also other artefacts. You
can see the difference in the attached two files.

I put it up as an issue here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17938

Any ideas?

Hi Kolja

I have a simple view plugin project ongoing that I should be able to scale
down for your needs.
I will try to find the time to do it before the end fo the week.

Subject: [Paraview] filename_%t is not expanded to current time in Catalyst
Message-ID: <8bd0e10d-db57-b2dc-a944-2cbe609e4192@gmail.com>

Hi,

I wrote a OpenFOAM adaptor for Catalyst.

In the ParaView, the connection is made good and shows filtered flow 
field as written in the python script.

However, filename_%t and image_%t is not expanded as time marching but 
just write filename_0 and image_0.png.

As far as I know, %t should be replaced with current time as given in 
dataDescription->SetTimeData.

Any help would be appreciated.


snippet of my OpenFOAM Adaptor code for Catalyst is as follows:

// icoFoam.C

#ifdef USE_CATALYST
 ??? Foam::HashTable<string> options = args.options();
 ??? IStringStream is(options["scriptList"]);
 ??? wordList scriptList = readList<word>(is);
 ??? OFAdaptor::Initialize(scriptList, mesh);
#endif
 ??? while (runTime.loop())
 ??? {
 ??????? runTime.write();
#ifdef USE_CATALYST
 ??????? OFAdaptor::CoProcess(mesh, runTime);
#endif
 ??? }
#ifdef USE_CATALYST
 ??? OFAdaptor::Finalize();
#endif


// OFAdaptor.C

void CoProcess(Foam::fvMesh& mesh, Foam::Time& runTime)
{
 ?????? vtkNew<vtkCPDataDescription> dataDescription;
 ?????? dataDescription->AddInput("input");
 ?????? dataDescription->SetTimeData(runTime.value(),

Hi,

My guess is that the TimeStep isn't getting set properly in the adaptor
(though it looks like it should be in
"dataDescription->SetTimeData(runTime.value(),
runTime.deltaTValue());"). My suggestion would be to add in the following
to either the RequestDataDescription() or DoCoProcessing() methods in the
python script to see what Catalyst thinks the time step is:
    print("In script2.py, the data time step is ",
datadescription.GetTimeStep())

The best way I can think of is to then use the threshold filter to isolate
each of the pieces and then use the cell size filter on each piece. This
would be fairly easy to automate in a Python script to just print out the
values.

Alternatively, I don't see a reason why the Connectivity filter couldn't
have an option added to output a field data array with the summed sizes of
each piece. Since Cory just made the connectivity filter work correctly in
parallel it would surprise me that he may be familiar enough with the code
to do the change in a couple of hours.

Hey Paraview community!

I have unstructured grid type data, which consists of a network of
polygons. Is there a direct way to fit an ellipse and find the properties
like major axis/minor axis?

Thanking you

Message-ID: <1CE2C3C3-874B-4080-99B1-E6D30B4F16D2@iris.washington.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to see if I can visualize my netCDF Earth models (longitude, latitude,depth) using ParaView. I have been able to load the models, with the "Spherical Coordinates" option selected. However it appears that I now lose my coordinates and depth values and as a result to extract a subset, I have to use the depth index (not the actual depth value). Is there a way to preserve the latitude, longitude and depth values and work with ParaView using the actual values (not their index) directly?

Thank you,

Manochehr,

If you uncheck the ?Spherical Coordiantes? option, then the longitude, latitude, and depth values will be preserved as x, y, and z coordinates. (Instead of translated to a sphere, the data will appear in a rectangle.)

Ken,

Thanks for your reply. The problem with that approach is that all the features I am interested in make sense if they are plotted on a sphere (they approximate the Earth surface). So, there is no builtin solution for that?

One more question: How can I access the actual latitude, longitude and depth parameter values using Python. I can see their extent and bounds, but I can not see how I can access the individual values:

temp.GetBounds()
(0.0, 359.0, -89.0, 89.0, -2750.0, 50.0)
temp.GetDimensions()
(360, 179, 57)
temp.GetExtent()
(0, 359, 0, 178, 0, 56)
temp.GetCenter()
(179.5, 0.0, -1350.0)
temp.GetNumberOfPoints()
3673080L

Really appreciate your help

Thanks Andy!  Although I will take a round about method, I would love a real solution.

Cory?  Thoughts?

The best way I can think of is to then use the threshold filter to isolate each of the pieces and then use the cell size filter on each piece. This would be fairly easy to automate in a Python script to just print out the values.
Alternatively, I don't see a reason why the Connectivity filter couldn't have an option added to output a field data array with the summed sizes of each piece. Since Cory just made the connectivity filter work correctly in parallel it would surprise me that he may be familiar enough with the code to do the change in a couple of hours.

I have a user that wants to use the equivalent of the Material Interface Filter on VTK files.  Is there a way to do this?  I did find the Connectivity filter, that gets me half way.  I then want to find the mass of these individual fragments.

To test, I used Wavelet, the Clip by Sphere, then made the Radius 15, then ran the connectivity filter.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Scaling View Question
Message-ID: <BAD19BFC-5B1F-402F-8ABE-BA6DE6AAB7E0@exponent.com>

I have a view with a number of different objects in it.  For example, assume that there are a number of cylinders sitting on a plane.  I want to increase the scale in the Z-axis so that I can better compare the objects.  Is there any way to increase the scale for the whole view?
I know that for each object I can increase the z-scale in the Transforming Properties box.  And that is exactly what I want to do, except I just would like to be able to do it for the whole view, instead of having to do it for each object separately, one by one.  I want everything in the view to be scaled in the Z-axis by the same amount.  So, it would look the same as if I were to go to each object and put in that new scale value.
I have searched around but haven?t been able to find a way to do that.

Any suggestions?  Did I miss an option somewhere?

Thanks,


-- Adam

Hi Manoch,

I think what you want is not possible right now but let us get back to you
on it as something we might want to look into before we can say it for
sure. One workaround would be you load the data (uncheck the sphere
coordinate system), apply the filter, and then write the data back as
NetCDF. It is not ideal by any means. You can also look into
vtkSphericalTransform (if you want to convert data back to spherical
coordinate system) but you will not get the exact shape of earth which is a
ellipsoid (which I am not sure if you would be interested in anyways).

Hope this helps.

Hi Aashish,

Thank you for your reply. That will be great if it gets looked into:) Going back and forth between coordinate systems may be a little confusing, but I will give it a try and see how it works out.


Could you also point me in the right direction for getting the latitude, longitude and depth arrays? As I mentioned in my reply to Ken (below), using Python, I go as far as getting the extents and bounds but cannot get the actual values.

Thank you again for your quick reply and useful suggestions.

Best,

?manoch

Subject: [Paraview] Image Filter plugin - making output larger than input
Message-ID: <E9283CEABE3D474B902D8859C0CEA8C35FFC55@exchmbx01>

Hello,

I have been writing a plugin that takes in ImageData as input and outputs ImageData. The problem is that the ImageData output can be larger than the input. If I use output->SetExtent() to the correct output extents, the information panel in ParaView shows the correct extents but the actual rendering is the size of the input, which is smaller in every dimension. My data shows correctly, but is clipped due to this.

I have tried using outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), DataExtent, 6 ); and outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(), DataExtent, 6 ); instead of output->SetExtent() but these do not help.

I have also tried implementing RequestInformation and RequestUpdateExtent, and if I set outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), DataExtent, 6 ); in RequestInformation the output renders to the correct size, however my algorithm calculates the dimensions non-trivially so I'd be having to repeat work in RequestInformation and RequestData.

Is there a way to set the correct output extent/dimensions in RequestData? Any help would be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Louise Davies

Manochehr,

ParaView always renders in a Cartesian space. So if you want the lat/lon/depth values to look like a sphere, the coordinates have to be converted and you will loose the original values. I can see the point of your use case. It just never came up before. It seems reasonable to be able to save the original lat/lon values in a field, so I raised a bug for it.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17943

As far as getting the coordinates in a script, it is possible but not recommended. If you need to access field or coordinate values directly, it is usually best to do so in a programmable filter.

However it appears that I now lose my coordinates and depth values and as a result to extract a subset, I have to use the depth index (not the actual depth value). Is there a way to preserve the latitude, longitude and depth values and work with ParaView using the actual values (not their index) directly?

Thanks Ken. I will try this on other machines. BTW I have version 3.0 of
OpenGL:
$ glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"
OpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 10.5.9

Hello,

I am wondering how to build a version of ParaView with OpenVR plugin? Which version of OpenVR shall I use? I used the OpenVR from https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr  with just basic/minimal cmake option. I am using the following  cmake line for ParaView 

cmake ..\paraview -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=U:\tools\ParaView\ParaView -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF -DPARAVIEW_QT_VERSION=5 -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE:BOOL=ON -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=U:/tools/boost/boost-1.65.1/include/boost-1_65_1 -DBOOST_ROOT=U:/tools/boost/boost-1.65.1 -DModule_vtkAcceleratorsVTKm:BOOL=ON -DModule_vtkRenderingOpenVR:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_OpenVR:BOOL=ON -DOPENVR_INCLUDE_DIR=U:/tools/OpenVR/OpenVR/include -DOPENVR_LIBRARY=U:/tools/OpenVR/OpenVR/lib/openvr_api64.lib

I am running into the following error

Hi,

Does binary release version work for you? (At present only Windows is 
available), seem to be a few things to fix on Linux & Mac.


Have you tried build using flags similar to binary release version?

Dear all,

Sorry to post onto an old thread. I have been reading this thread and the
related write up here:
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Advanced_Tips_and_Tricks#Animating_a_static_vector_field

This thread (and the tips and tricks post) is really close to what I want
to do, but I have a few follow-up questions.  I too have a steady-state
solution field. I want to trace particles from the inlet of my domain to
the exit, following the steady-state velocity field, and report for each
particle the temperature-time history (or any other scalar from my
simulation) that the particle sees.  In additional and crucially, the time
the particle has within the domain: a residence time.  The residence time
would be the maximum value or IntegrationTime each particle attains before
it leaves the domain.

I see that if I follow the notes I can plot (using Glyphs) the temperature
as it varies across my domain as the particles are animated down the
streamlines: this is working.  What I do not seem to be able to find
however, is the IntegrationTime.  It appears as point-field data after the
streamlines are created, but vanishes after the contour filter is applied.
I guess the contour filter is computing a singular value for all values of
the IntegrationTime from T=0 to T=N with a specific level of granularity.
However, I can't seem to extract the specific value of IntegrationTime (the
contour value) when I stop the simulation at any given point.  Do you know
how to do that?  The "time" scale in the VCR window always goes from 0->1
not from 0->(max value of IntegrationTime in seconds).  Can the actual
value of time be backed out or animated? If so how do I do that, or am I
applying the Contour filter wrongly: as per the post, I am only using the
default values in the Counter filter panel.

Finally, and importantly for me, while the Glyphs move across the screen
following the streamlines, and render via the temperature field, how to I
actually extract information from this pseudo time series to perform
analysis?  For example, the min and max temperature seen by a particle as
it moved across the streamline for instance?  I'm actually hoping to plot
offline (as a function of IntegrationTime) the min and max temperature
obtained for each particle: I can then take the min and max of that set for
the quickest and slowest particles.

Using the latest stock version of paraview.

Cheers,
Andy

By default, the Contour filter does not copy the scalar field used to
determine the contour surface since it will always be the same value.
You can tell it to copy the scalar field by enabling the Compute
Scalars option.

Instead of using the Sequence animation mode, use Real Time. Then, set
the Start Time to the minimum IntegrationTime value and End Time to
the maximum IntegrationTime value. You can see these listed either in
the Information tab of the StreamTracer filter in the Pipeline Browser
or under the Contour filter's Property tab under the Isosurfaces
section (Value Range). To show the current time in the render view,
use an Annotate Time source, available in the Sources menu.

You can run the Connectivity filter on the StreamTracer output to
assign a unique value to each streamline. This unique value will be
called RegionId. It starts at 0 and ends at the number of stream lines
minus 1. Selecting each stream line can be done with the Threshold
filter in ParaView using the RegionId as the threshold array, then you
can see the min/max of your temperature and IntegrationTime variables
in the Information tab. Iterating over all stream lines and saving the
min/max of the different scalar fields is possible using ParaView's
Python scripting capabilities. However, you may find it faster to
export the data to a tool with which you are more familiar.

To do that, I would suggest saving the Connectivity filter output to a
.csv file. The CSV file will contain all the scalar fields in
different columns, including the aforementioned RegionId field. Simply
filter on the RegionId field using your favorite software/plotting
tool to find the min and max temperature and max IntegrationTime of
the particle along the stream line.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Simon & Benson,

I would bet steam has changed their API (again :-) and removed that method.
Maybe try downloading/git checkout using the 1.0.10 version of OpenVR. That
is what I last tested with and it should build fine against that.

Thanks!
Ken

Those flags look reasonable, but last I checked the OpenVR  CMake files had
some minor issues. I use a small patch file for OpenVR 1.0.10 in the
paraview superbuild. The patch file is here

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/blob/master/projects/win32/patches/openvr-improve-install.patch

I think it mostly fixes install issues and shared library support.

Hi Ken,

I guess that's the price to pay when working with cutting edge technology :)  Thanks for the OpenVR version info. I used the release version of it.  What is your cmake flag for OpenVR? I just used

cmake ../OpenVR -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/OpenVR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Any other variable I need to specify? I will try to compile it with OpenVR version 1.0.10. Thank you

And Benson, yes the binary version worked ok with our HTC Vive. 

Thanks
-simon

Hi Simon & Benson,

I would bet steam has changed their API (again :-) and removed that method. Maybe try downloading/git checkout using the 1.0.10 version of OpenVR. That is what I last tested with and it should build fine against that.

Thanks!
Ken

Those flags look reasonable, but last I checked the OpenVR  CMake files had some minor issues. I use a small patch file for OpenVR 1.0.10 in the paraview superbuild. The patch file is here

Caution-https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/blob/master/projects/win32/patches/openvr-improve-install.patch < Caution-https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/blob/master/projects/win32/patches/openvr-improve-install.patch > 


I think it mostly fixes install issues and shared library support.

	Hi Ken,
	
	I guess that's the price to pay when working with cutting edge technology :)  Thanks for the OpenVR version info. I used the release version of it.  What is your cmake flag for OpenVR? I just used
	
	cmake ../OpenVR -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/OpenVR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	
	Any other variable I need to specify? I will try to compile it with OpenVR version 1.0.10. Thank you
	
	And Benson, yes the binary version worked ok with our HTC Vive.
	
	Thanks

	Hi Simon & Benson,
	
	I would bet steam has changed their API (again :-) and removed that method. Maybe try downloading/git checkout using the 1.0.10 version of OpenVR. That is what I last tested with and it should build fine against that.
	
	Thanks!

	        Hi,
	
	        Does binary release version work for you? (At present only Windows is available), seem to be a few things to fix on Linux & Mac.
	
	
	        Have you tried build using flags similar to binary release version?

Right. Unfortunately, implementing my suggestion would require creating a
subclass of vtkPVGlyphFilter and importing that with a ParaView plugin. See
the ParaView Howto on how to add a filter to ParaView.

Yes, that should do it. Your modified glyph class will be available once
you've imported the ParaView plugin mentioned above.

A quick question about setting the active normals. Is there an existing way

I think that should work.

Message-ID: <DBEF383764FCE7428354CFA9A0591A860209332336@eonblitz16.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de>

Dear all,

I have a "Structured (Curvilinear) Grid" (*.vts), which gets read in as 314531 cells and 330000 points. I would like to tell Paraview that this is equidistant cell-centered data (330000 cells). I want every cell to get one color, such that color interpolation becomes correct.

Can I somehow convert the data I have?

Thank you!
Henrik B?sing

Message-ID: <MWHPR06MB3277D443E3B7E512B1A980BD80ED0@MWHPR06MB3277.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,


I recently tried to create a large animation using parallel paraview with 40 cores, but I received this error:


"ERROR: In paraview/paraview-v5.4.1/VTK/Common/Core/vtkGenericDataArray.txx, line 442

vtkIdTypeArray(0x2aaabc66a8e0): Unable to allocate 131071 elements of size 8 bytes."


More details:

  *   I have 500 time steps, 192 files for each timestep (was run on 192 processors), and the total domain is roughly size 60x80x130.
  *   The files rectilinear vtk format (pvtr/vtr)
  *   I made the animation by loading all the data files into Paraview and using "export animation". The resultion was roughly 1200x800 at 8 frames/sec.


Is there any way I can make such a large animation?


Thank you,

Nick Stegmeier

Thank you, Mathieu,
any update on this?
All my research seems to point to a few hardcoded views that are
accessible. I simply can't find a solution to implement a new view and open
it from a plugin.
Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst dlopen issues with OpenGL2 support for
 off-screen Mesa
In-Reply-To: <1495671484.31674.2.camel@free.fr>
Message-ID: <1117834666.2988077.1516673773622.JavaMail.root@zimbra10-e2>

Hello,

I made further progress on this old thread, so am answering myself to close this issue...

With recent versions of OSMesa (17.2 or 17.8), I observed that using LD_PRELOAD with OSMesa.so.8 also avoided the incorrect initialization issue of OSMesa leading to Catalyst complaining aboit OpenGL2 features not being available.

On an Arch Linux system, I had also reproduced the reported issue at one time, but do not reproduce it anymore with Mesa 17.3.
On a Debian 8 based system, I still reproduce it, but running new tests, instead of LD_PRELOAD, using RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_GLOBAL as dlopen flags solves the issue (either RTLD_LAZY or RTLD_NOW work with RTLD_GLOBAL, none work wth RTLD_LOCAL). I am pretty sure I had run similar tests a few month ago with older versions, with less success.

I assume the improvements come from Mesa updates, though as the behavior of dlopen is concerned, it might also be due to lower level patches.

In any case, I started building a small test case to reproduce this, but it was not working yet (trying to get the
correct libraries to link in a minimal setting, or other options correct while not being familiar with CMake), so as I have a good work, I guess I'll leave it there and hope the issue does not resurfaces.

Best regards,

  Yvan

Objet: Re: [Paraview] Catalyst dlopen issues with OpenGL2 support for off-screen Mesa

Hello,

I reproduced the issue described 2 months ago relative to detection of OSMesa
OpenGL2 support using dynamically loaded shared libraries on another machine.

I had reproduced this issue on Debian-9 based systems, but not with the
preconfigured Mesa/OSMesa from Arch Linux. Recently, I had other issues with the
 packaged library on Arch (Mesa 17.1.0, including both off-screen and on-screen
drivers), as glGetString and a few other symbols were not found.

So I recompiled Mesa for off-screen mode, using the recommendations from the
ParaView Wiki (with the packaged LLVM 4.0), and encounter the following error
again when starting Catalyst:

--------------------------------
ERROR: In
/home/yvan/src/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line
831

vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow (0x72e3c00): GL version 2.1 with the gpu_shader4

r the new OpenGL rendering backend. Please update your OpenGL driver. If you are
using Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.5 or later 
and make sure your driver in Mesa supports OpenGL 3.2.
--------------------------------

Trying to force usage of OpenSWR (using "export GALLIUM_DRIVER=swr") I have
another error:

--------------------------------
SWR detected AVX2

SWR library load failure: /home/yvan/opt/osmesa/lib/libswrAVX2.so: undefined
symbol: _glapi_tls_Dispatch
--------------------------------

So this seems quite reproducible on various systems, and both with LLVM 3.9 or
LLVM 4, Mesa 13 or 17.

When linking ParaView (Catalyst) normally (rather than linking them with a
smaller module loaded as a plugin with dlopen), both the default LLVMpipe and
OpenSwr errors dissapear, and things work fine

Does anybody have an idea what I may be missing when loading with dlopen ?

Best regards,

  Yvan

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting data on the surface of a block?
Message-ID: <2F8BA25CC0B82C4DB6756F8F663E6DB36B665067@CITESMBX3.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi Everyone,

I am performing a multiphase CFD computation. Basically I am looking at an oil drop rising buoyantly in water.

The output from my computations is in the ExodusII format, which I read into ParaView, and I am using multiple blocks, where mesh nodes coincide with the drop's surface (moving mesh, boundary conforming technique).

I would like to extract information on the deformable surface of the drop around the circumference of the surface at specific elevations.

How could this be accomplished?

I tried some filters, for example extracting the surface of the block forming the oil drop, and then applying a "PlotOnIntersectionCurves" filter, using a planar surface, so that a planar surface would cut the surface of the drop, forming a circular arc with constant elevation.

This seemed to produce reasonable looking results, but I was not able to specify the number of points along the arc where data was extracted. Also, upon saving, three files were produced file0.csv, file1.csv, file2.csv, and file3.csv. Not sure why I am not getting just one file?

Is there a way to have a bit more control over the resolution used when interpolating and extracting data in this case?

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

Thanks very much,

I'm hesitant to add an option in the Connectivity filter to do this.
Instead, I can imagine uses for a volume computation for
surfaces/volumes labeled by a RegionId that isn't necessarily assigned
as a function of connectivity. Instead, I would prefer to create a
separate filter that computes volumes for each RegionId in the input
dataset. You would feed the output of the Connectivity filter to this
new filter and get the volume-per-region information you want.

Hello

Here is a minimal example for creating a new type of view within a plugin.
You actually cannot inherit directly from vtkPVView, you must inherit for a
base view, which can be :
 - vtkPVRenderView
 - vtkPVContextView
 - vtkPythonView
 - vtkSpreadSheetView
(

This choice is also visible in the associated xml files where you precise
which kind of proxy you want to create.

In the attached example, I demonstrated how to add a clone of the Render
View, called Render View 2.

Hope it helps,

As a happy coincidence, Will Schroeder just posted a merge request for
a VTK filter that computes the volumes of connected regions in a poly
data and stores the volumes in field data:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/3825. We could
expose this in ParaView once it lands in VTK.

Louis,

PlotOnIntersectionCurves essentially slices the dataset using a
implicit plane. The points you get are indeed the insection points
between your polydata and the plane and hence there's no control over
how many points there can be, besides what's determined by your mesh.

If you can share the sample data (feel free to do it off the list,if
you'd like), I can see what other options may work.

Are you using "save data"? I'd suggest selecting the "Chart View" and
then using "Export View" option to export the curves. That will give
you a since CSV for the fields you've selected.

By "Export View", I meant "Export Scene" under the "File" menu.

Hi Yvan,

Thanks for the update.

I haven't seen anything like this yet but if I'm able to reproduce it I'll
see if I can track down the issue.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] OSPRay ignores transparency
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQuSnuDYy3aEAo7wBrUHeGvn9oVDi7MhP-Ep8KnZe=QJbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I tried both ParaView v5.4 and current v5.5 binaries, Windows x64, but,
when I set a surface object opacity to e.g. 0.5, then enable OSPRay,
surfaces goes back to fully opaque. Is transparency currently ignored?

Thanks,
Nenad.

It is a known bug in VTK's interface to OSPRay such that opacity is ignored
in some cases dependent on some of the other color controls.

My guess would be that you're accessing a nullptr in
`vtkLIC3DRepresentation::AddToView`. I'd recommend doing a debug build
of ParaView, and then attaching a debugger to confirm and fix.

I run this paraview on TACC Maverick, which I have no access to debug
build. But I run the same plugin on my Windows Paraview build and there is
no such error. How could I fix it?
Thanks

Thanks, Mathieu, unfortunately the RenderView or the other hardcoded views
won't work for us.
As I described, I need to implement a custom view with a bunch of input
fields and buttons to represent data statistics.

The corresponding Qt views of the 4 mentioned View classes are created in
pqStandardServerManagerModelInterface::CreatePQView using hardcoded tests
such as:
 if (xmlname == pqSpreadSheetView::spreadsheetViewType())
  {
    return new pqSpreadSheetView(group, name, proxy, server, parent);
  }
Is it feasible to create another, generic vtkPVView-derived class besides
vtkPVRenderView...vtkSpreadSheetView, which will allow to define the view
elements using the plugin mechanism?

We can add menus, buttons and toolbars through plugins, why not customize a
generic view? Is there a reason that forbids such customization, or is it
just one of those topics that hasn't received sufficient interest or
funding, but could be implemented in principle?
Thanks
Kolja

Maybe if you share the code for vtkLIC3DRepresentation I may be able
to offer suggestions. You could also try getting a access to some
other linux machine on which you should be able to reproduce the
issue.

Andy,
Wouldn't the upcoming volume filter calculate the volume of fragments coming from the Connectivity filter?

It sounds like it. I believe that the user would have to use the extract
surface filter first though.

Subject: [Paraview] Unexpected measurement appears in 5.4.1 but not 5.0.1
Message-ID: <CAPYmBX07Sms0ruz12SgF4E8LfsOy0LER5jwUqqQzy_qy-ibWcg@mail.gmail.com>

The attached image shows the unexpected measure with text. I tested two
versions of ParaView and it only happens in 5.4.1 but not 5.0.1.

180 stacks are loaded and set to volume rendering by my Python script,
which is also attached.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Joe,

Are you referring to the circular (polar axes) in the image? It says
90.0 deg, 45.0 deg., etc.

Thanks,
Cory

fb13726dbfdcb5479c393720abaf8234edd42609
(version on Dec 1 2017), The latest has changed some source code, and I'm
working on fix it.

Even with fb13726dbfdcb5479c393720abaf8234edd42609, it fails to build. I'll
wait for you to update your code to build with latest ParaView before
testing it. A quick look at the "AddToView" method and I don't see anything
wrong with it, so it will need some debugging.

Hi Utkarsh,

My data file is rather large, but here is a link to the data:

https://uofi.box.com/s/u4hpipt8kbo0u3oxhz92xeya75kzf6kd

Please let me know if this is too large and I can try to send a smaller version.

I have been using "save data". It seems I have data sets under the "Composite Data Set Index" list in the PlotOnIntersection pipeline.

How is "Chart View" selected again? I didn't find it in the "View" drop down menu at the top, but I was able to open a new layout and select "SpreadSheetView".

Thanks again,

By "Export View", I meant "Export Scene" under the "File" menu.

Hi Louise,
To find Chart View, look for the words RenderView, to the left of the view splitting icons.  Right click just left of there, in the white open header area.  Select Convert To...

Hello again,


Could someone please confirm this to be a bug, or otherwise tell me how it could be resolved?


The problem is that my vtkImageData object changes in size over time, but visually it stays the same when I import it in ParaView as a group and play it as an animation.

Please see https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17732 for a reproducer and a screenshot of the problem.


Best,
Ahmad

Was about to create a new question about this, but I remembered I had asked it already a few months back ;-)

However I didn't receive a reply unfortunately.


Does anyone have a clue? I also opened an issue about this on gitlab: https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17698

There are also the files that demonstrate the issue.


Cheers!

Onderwerp: Reading group of pvti files: vtkImageData is static over time


Hello,


I have a vtkImageData object that I write (with a XMLPImageDataWriter) every time step to a pvti file.

When I open the group of output_*.pvti files, properties like X, Y, Z extent and range do not change as I animate over time.

But when I open the actual files I can see that these values in fact are different.


And if I open the files individually (for example output_99.pvti) these properties are displayed correctly in ParaView.

The problem appears when I open them as a group; it then keeps the properties of the first file.


Does anyone else has this issue, and is there a way to solve this?


Best,

Ahmad

By selecting the "Chart View", I meant simply click on the view that's
showing the plots after you applied the "PlotOnIntersectionCurves"
filter. That will activate the view. Now, when you choose File |
Export View, you'll export the contents of the selected view.

Louis,

Can you also attach a state file for the vis you're generating
currently, so I get a starting point? I am not sure which block is the
oil drop.

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Hello

It's been a while but I'm back to trying to solve this issue. 
Unfortunately this doesn't solve the issue. Using paraview 5.4.1 from 
latest Fedora?

Anything else I should try ?

paraview-superbuild
$ mkdir paraview-superbuild-build
$ cd paraview-superbuild-build
$ ccmake ../paraview-superbuild

There is a mismatch between the python it wants and the python on my system
so the configure step will not run and gives this error:

   Python interpreter version (2.7.13) does not match the library
version (2.7.10)

The /usr/bin/python on my system is 2.7.10. What's it complaining about?
There are other Pythons on my system. I changed my $PATH so /usr/bin is
first, and deleted the contents of the paraview-superbuild-build directory
and that seems to have taken care of it.

This doesn't seem like the right solution to me, posting here either to
help someone else with the same problem, or so that some developer of the
superbuild can fix this.

Thank you,

 -Tom

Subject: [Paraview] Error when trying to turn on Volume Rendering for large
 tetrahedral data in ParaView 5.4.1
Message-ID: <10A03274360DCF47A6EE78C9952A31CA9201397B@UCOLHPUD.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

I am experiencing an error with volume rendering very large
tetrahedral data with ParaView version  5.4.1.

The data is loaded properly and the surface representation works,
but when I change the representation to Volume, I get the standard 
dialog below to which I respond "Yes" 

'This will change the representation type to "Volume".
That may take a while, depending on your dataset. Are you sure?'

I am tested this on two of the HPC supercomputer systems
while connected to a remote server with multiple compute nodes,
communicating over MPI. I have verified, I am not running out of memory
 on the compute nodes or on the client but on large data,
(over 40 million or so tetrahedrons) the compute nodes will crash
without any error messages and the remote connection will drop,
running out of memory would cause a similar failure, but as far as
I can tell, that is not the case here.

I wanted to see if anyone else had hit this problem, before I try building 
debug versions of the software and using a debugger on them,
to trace the failure down more thoroughly.

The data has 4 vectors and a scalar defined at each tetrahedron,
and it renders fine with smaller subsets (less than 20 million
or so tetrahedron). I would like to be able to scale up to a billion
tetrahedrons eventually, so a 40 million limit is a problem.

I suspect that there might be an issue in 
vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper.cxx
where some buffer is maybe 32 bit instead of 64 bit,
but I have not confirmed this.

Has anyone already solved this problem yet?

Thanks,

Joe

Joe,

Sorry, doesn't ring a bell. One thing to try is to turn of "Use Data
Partitions" (see [1]) if your data is already partitioned between
ranks such that we can build a sorting order.

Hi Seongmo,

Please keep the conversations on the mailing list so that anyone can follow
along or participate. Also, these types of things often get lost in my
inbox when they don't make it back to the ParaView mailing list.

What version of ParaView Catalyst are you using? I think the annotate time
filter should work with Catalyst but I haven't verified that. I vaguely
remember others using that filter with Catalyst though. Also, I think the
colormap bug was fixed. If you have a way of sharing a sample that
demonstrates either of those bugs I can try taking a look at the issue.

Best,
Andy

Utkarsh,

Thanks, turning on "Use Data Partitions" helped quite a bit.
The rendering is working for me now. I still suspect there
is a bug somewhere, but with "Use Data Partitions" on
I do not seem to be hitting it, and it is renders faster as well.

Thanks,

Joe

I have encountered the same problem with the interpreter version
differing from the library version while having a homebrew Python
installed on my system. Perhaps there is an opportunity for a bug fix
in CMake's FindPythonInterp.cmake and FindPythonLibs.cmake files.

For now, what you have done is a reasonable workaround.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Seongmo,

I am using following steps to add annotation to Catalyst,

1 - Create a ProgrammableFilter
2 - Add following code to it (don?t forget to modify epoc)

import paraview.simple
import paraview.servermanager
import datetime
import locale

# get output port and copy it to input
out = self.GetOutput()
out.ShallowCopy(self.GetInput())

# define epoc
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_TIME, "en_US")
epoc = datetime.datetime(1949, 12, 1, 0, 0, 0)

# get time value
tval = self.GetInput().GetInformation().Get(out.DATA_TIME_STEP())

# find time by adding hours
#t1 = epoc+datetime.timedelta(seconds=tval)
t1 = epoc+datetime.timedelta(hours=tval)
tstr = t1.strftime(?%d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S UTC")

# output
label = vtk.vtkStringArray()
label.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
label.Resize(1)
label.SetName("TimeLabel")
label.SetValue(0, t1)
out.GetFieldData().AddArray(label)

3 - Add AnnotateGlobalData1 and select ?TimeLabel? as array (needs 
MergeBlocks filter in case of multiblock datasets)

You could modify the section related with generation of time string for 
your needs. I hope it helps.

Regards,

--ufuk

Hi,

I don't know if there is a proper fix but there is a CMake option to bypass
this check:
 set PYTHON_I_KNOW_WHAT_IM_DOING to true may solve the problem.

Dear Andy Bauer,

For the color map issue, I think ParaView 5.4.1 resolved it. But, I 
could not figure out annotate time filter issue. may be it is just 
simple problem but I am not sure. Coprocess routine is as follows and 
python script is attached.

It would be appreciated if you make some advice.


void CoProcess(Foam::fvMesh& mesh, Foam::Time& runTime)
{
 ?????? vtkNew<vtkCPDataDescription> dataDescription;
 ?????? dataDescription->AddInput("input");
 ?????? const double time = runTime.value();
 ?????? const unsigned int timeStep = runTime.timeIndex();
 ?????? dataDescription->SetTimeData(time, timeStep);

 ?????? if (runTime.end())
 ?????? {
 ?????????? // assume that we want to all the pipelines to execute
 ?????????? // if it is the last time step
 ?????????? dataDescription->ForceOutputOn();
 ?????? }
 ?????? if 
(Processor->RequestDataDescription(dataDescription.GetPointer()) != 0)
 ?????? {
 ?????????? Foam::polyMesh::readUpdateState meshState = mesh.readUpdate();

 ?????????? if(meshState != Foam::polyMesh::UNCHANGED)
 ?????????? {
 ?????????????? // mesh moved? or mesh topology changed?
 ?????????????? BuildVTKGrid(mesh, true);
 ?????????? }
 ?????????? UpdateVTKAttributes(mesh);
dataDescription->GetInputDescriptionByName("input")->
 ?????????????? SetGrid(multiBlockDataSet);
 ?????????? Processor->CoProcess(dataDescription.GetPointer());
 ?????? }
}

Regards.

Subject: [Paraview] OpenGL Vendor
Message-ID: <440f9c18fdd24a38b416dd1268a12c3e@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

With a remote server running on a cluster, what does the Help/ About/ Connection Information/ OpenGL Version string mean?  Where is this found?  Isn't this the version of OpenGL compiled into the pvserver?  What is the name of this library, and any idea how I can find what is being used?

I have a situation where my builds show OpenGL version 3.3 (and can open a specific dataset), and a user's shows 2.1 (and he cannot open a specific dataset).

Thanks all,

Alan

Dear Mathieu,
I may be missing the point of your suggested code. I asked whether plugins
can provide views beyond the existing RenderViews, on 15 January I sent a
code snippet to the list to show my successful attempts that implement a
new RenderView and ask how to replace it with a generic view containing
other Qt widgets, and now you reproduced another version of the
functionality from my snippet.

Why?

Hi Kolja

Inheriting directly from vtkPVView is not possible as there is specific
code dedicated to managing each type of base view. Even if it was possible,
it would not allow you to add QtWidget anywhere in the view.
This is not possible due to design.
However, there are possibilities to add Qt widgets in the properties panel,
in the view tool items and in any dedicated QDockWidget or QToolbar you may
want to add in your plugin.

Also please keep in mind this mailing list is a volontary Q&A, We do offer
consulting services [1] if you want to work with ParaView development team
directly.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple identical "sources" proxies in a saved XML
 state file (GlyphType)
Message-ID: <9924A21B-248A-44FA-A6BF-7F290167D317@gmail.com>

Hello, dear developers.

I have issued this question on a bug tracker, but will duplicate it here, if you do not mind
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17957 <https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17957>


I'm not sure if this is a bug, but I have noticed, that saved xml state file contains many identical proxies, that belongs to group "sources". These proxies are actual source proxies, and participating in property  of every saved "GeometryRepresentation" proxy. 

So every "GeometryRepresentation" have it's own bunch of GlyphType source proxy instances (listed in proxy_list Domain), and all of them are saved to a state file.

I can understand, that saving all of them can be explained by "unified approach" to saving proxy to state file, but I have trouble with resulting state file - we tracking it's change with VCS (git, if it matters), and so many unnecessary (cause they are identical, except GlobalId) proxies saved gives us additional pain.

As an additional side effect we have increased state loading time. This issue might be related to appearance of saved GlyphType proxies in a state file: 
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17768

Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but one can not change the Domain type at runtime, so this proxy_list will be constant until changed in a views_and_representations.xml. If so, than maybe there is a way to save GlyphType proxies to state file only once (or not at all) and reference their GlobalIds from any other GeometryRepresentation?

Thanks in advance, 
Artem Bodrin.

Utkarsh,

I forget, meant to say blocks 1 and 2 represent the drop. I actually extracted and merged these two in ParaView.

Will send a state file soon, apologies for late, I have been traveling the past two days.

Subject: [Paraview] Plain text data with white space delimiters;
 Use raw array as axis/variables
Message-ID: <CAHQkNjR9T_LRuEpmydT9MWTn3HO7vC08nxQDzE_SyRtNVVAabg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

1) Does the ParaView GUI read a plain text file with white space as
delimiters?
2) Can ParaView use a giving 1d array as an axis?

My problem:

I have a plain text data file, each column is a different variable, and
delimiters are white space, e.g.,

x y z variable1 variable 2

Is there a way to read such a file and use x, y, z as coordinates of the
resulting variables?

For example, in TecPlot you can read in such a file and set axises to use
the x, y, z (or any other named variables).

For 1), does ParaView have an extra setting to set common options for plain
text data like delimiter, header, skiprow, etc.?

For 2), it appears to me that in ParaView all field/cell data is associated
with a predefined axis, so it is not that straightforward to use a raw
array as axis or as variable, though this is possible in the Python
interface. Is this correct.

Best,

Liang

Artem,

You raise good points. In reality, only saving the state of the
currently selected proxy from proxy-list domain should be sufficient.
There are challenges to doing that given the current implementation,
however. Let me try to figure out a viable solution and get back to
you.

Hi,

ParaView should be able to handle this. Try giving the filename a .csv
extension and then add a space for the Field Delimiter Characters options.
Optionally, you may also want to enable the Merge Consecutive Delimiters
option.

I forgot to mention that I can write out the number of frames I want if I use Sequence instead of Snap to TimeSteps, however, then an Annotate Time source will show an interpolated time based on the sequence rather than the actual timesteps. If there's a work around for that behavior I could do that instead.

Subject: Save Animation option in ParaView 5.4.0 vs 5.3.0

Hello,

In ParaView 5.3.0 and earlier, when Animation mode was Snap to TimeSteps, in the Save Animation dialog box there was an option for No. of Frames / timestep. This doesn't show up in the 5.4.0 dialog box. Was this just moved or was it removed completely?

My use case for this is a data set with 25 timesteps, each of which is on the order of either 5 minutes or 30 minutes apart in real world time. I'd render 30 frames / timestep to get a 25 second movie to show each discrete timestep for one second. The video should show those discrete jumps in time and not use interpolation.

I can do the frame replication in BASH but it was handy to have that option.

Thanks,
Mark

OpenGL is loaded at runtime so what matters is the mostly the system it is
running on as opposed to the system it was compiled on (except OSMesa see
below).

To make it a bit more complicated, if you use GLXforwarding or a similar
OpenGL forwarding mechanism then what matters is some combination of the
forwarding library on the system PV is running on and the OpenGL hardware
of the system you are *displaying* on. This bites people when PV runs fine
locally on a system but when they forward their display/remote desktop to
another system it fails.

Finally when building with OSMesa, as long as the runtime system picks up
the OSMesa libs you built, then it really is the version of OSMesa you
compiled against that matters.

On linux I think a ldd on the PV executable can show which library is being
picked up. (should have ogl or opengl, nvidia, mesa etc in the path) but a
linux person might know better.

To add to what Ken said, the "Client Information" tab shows you info
about OpenGL for the "paraview" executable, while the "Connection
Information" gives you info for the "pvserver", if any.

Hey Mark,

Looks like we took that out as part of the revamp described here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/15917

Specifically this merge request took out the "No. Frames" entry.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/896
because, at least at that time, apparently the control didn't do anything
at all.

A 1 commit merge request that restores the widget and hooks it up to do
what it apparently did at one time is
here. https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/2197

Thanks, Andy. That works! Now the problem is how I can use the 1d arrays to
construct 3d plots.

Now I have many 1d arrays: x, y, z, variable1, variable2, ..., etc.

Unfortunately, they are AMR data, not regularly indexed, (in fact they are
TecPlot ascii data, but ParaView could not read them correctly for some
reason, this is another issue, though).

I would like to make 3d plots, 2d slice, or at least 1d cuts. I am OK to
use Python interface but might need some instruction how to create 3d data
from these flattened 1d arrays.
I guess there are some tutorials to convert numpy array to vtk arrays, I
might start from that. Then I need to convert the row data ParaView GUI
reads in to numpy array then to vtk array?

I have attached the data if anyone can kindly try it. At least it is a
valid TecPlot file which other people tested using TecPlot.

Greetings,

Currently I am using my own application to generate a simple CSV file which
can be loaded up in ParaView. I then create the visualization I want with a
few manual filter operations.

What I would like is to generate a file, preferably still with a field for
CSV-like raw data, that tells ParaView to load the data and then apply the
filters I want, so the view I want is immediately available upon loading
the file and the raw data is available if I want to try other filters.

I've taken a look at vpt and pvd files saved from my intended view but I'm
not seeing much correspondence between the CSV data I generate, the filters
I apply and the data fields in there. I'm also pondering the save-state and
trace/macro features of ParaView but I suspect those won't quite square
with my aim of generating a file in an external application which includes
data.

Could someone point me toward a proper way to do this? If it comes down to
plugin development I'm willing to take a look at that.

Thanks,
Wyatt Spear

Wyatt--

While ParaView can read CSV files and subsequently generate images, the 
CSV format for simulation results limits the functionality available to 
you in ParaView. My suggestion is that you write your simulation results 
in a format that contains geometry information, as well as, Point and 
Cell centered values like displacement, velocity, acceleration, 
temperature, concentrations, volume fractions, /et cetera./

The attached document is a good place to start. (This document is very 
concise and very complete, but the information is only written down 
once. As a result, the format information is sometimes not located where 
you need it.)

If your simulations are concerned with the deformation of 3-D solids and 
structures, I can provide you with FORTRAN95 routines that you can use 
to write VTK-formatted simulation results.

Once you can generate VTK-formatted datum sets, The File > Save State 
command will generate *.pvsm files that will let you "recreate" a 
previously constructed Browser Pipeline. (The PV *.pvsm reader gives you 
the opportunity to select a different datum set.)

There is a small two-cell mesh file attached that might be helpful to 
you when constructing a VTK-formatted file writer in your application.

Utkarsh,

I forget, meant to say blocks 1 and 2 represent the drop. I actually extracted and merged these two in ParaView.

Will send a state file soon, apologies for late, I have been traveling the past two days.

Hello, dear participants.

Actually, one can do what Kolja needs. If you are still interested, I can deduce the sample from my plugin.

In 2 words: 
1) inherit main view class MyView from pqView
2) create a stub class vtkPVMyView, inherited from vtkPVView, override pure virtual functions
3) add to plugin's XML:

</ServerManagerConfiguration>
    <!-- declare a view -->
    <ProxyGroup name="views">
        <ViewProxy
                name="MyView"
                class="vtkPVMyView"
                processes="client"
                base_proxygroup="internal_views"
                base_proxyname="ViewBase"
                label="My View">
        </ViewProxy>
    </ProxyGroup>
    <!-- here is your other stuff -->
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

4) create your own container widget class and return it from MyView::createWidget() method
5) use this in your plugin?s CMakeLists.txt:

   add_pqproxy(
      VIEW_IFACE VIEW_IFACE_SRCS
      TYPE MyView
      XML_GROUP views
      XML_NAME MyView
   )

That?s it. I used SpreadSheet view implementation for inspiration.

Hello,

I have a problem of showing files about _broken_joint_* in my Paraview.
Currently, both the version of 4.2 and 5.* cannot work successfully on
these files. My Graphic card is AMD and OS is Ubuntu 16.04.

Thank you.

Hi, Andy Bauer,


My script should show streamline with time of cavity tutorial of 
OpenFOAM as attached.

However, my script makes a error which does not the case without 
annotate time filter.

I checked my script with your script and found the following difference.


My script:

annotateTime1Display = Show(annotateTime1, renderView1)

SetActiveSource(parallelMultiBlockDataSetWriter1)

return PipeLine()


Andy Bauer's script:

annotateTime1Display = Show(annotateTime1, renderView1)

annotateTime1Display.FontFile = ''

SetActiveSource(annotateTime1)

return PipeLine()


I guess this difference is related to my error but my question is how 
can I get my field with time plotted without setting annotateTime1 as 
active source.


Below is the error message, FYI.

Mark,

One more thing to help until the num frames/time step comes back. If you want to use the sequence mode and get a time stamp that reflects the time in your time step, try using the Annotate Time Filter (as opposed to the Annotate Time Source) and attach it to your data. That should report the time of your data instead of the global ParaView time. (There is an exercise in the ParaView tutorial demonstrating this.)

Hey Mark,

Looks like we took that out as part of the revamp described here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/15917

Specifically this merge request took out the "No. Frames" entry.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/896
because, at least at that time, apparently the control didn't do anything at all.

A 1 commit merge request that restores the widget and hooks it up to do what it apparently did at one time is

Hello,

In ParaView 5.3.0 and earlier, when Animation mode was Snap to TimeSteps, in the Save Animation dialog box there was an option for No. of Frames / timestep. This doesn't show up in the 5.4.0 dialog box. Was this just moved or was it removed completely?

My use case for this is a data set with 25 timesteps, each of which is on the order of either 5 minutes or 30 minutes apart in real world time. I'd render 30 frames / timestep to get a 25 second movie to show each discrete timestep for one second. The video should show those discrete jumps in time and not use interpolation.

I can do the frame replication in BASH but it was handy to have that option.

Thanks,
Mark

Thanks, I'll take a look at this. My use case is pretty severely
underutilizing ParaView's capabilities though. I'm rendering very large
multi-variable heat maps. So color mapped 2d points are all I need
rendered, (until I can figure out how to map glyph height to another
variable).

Wyatt,

ParaView provides extensive Python scriptability. One solution is to
write out a Python script from your program. Within the Pythons
script, you set up the data, set up filters and modify visualization
settings just as you wish. Once it is loaded, you can continue to
explore your data by creating new filters, changing visualization
parameters, and so on.

Creating example Python scripts is easy using the Trace functionality
(Tools menu -> Start Trace) - you just interact with the UI and the
equivalent Python operations will be written to the trace file. Use
such a trace as a basis for what is written from your program.

To save the data to the Python script and then load it is a different
use case from what we typical support, but I think it is doable. It
would just look a little ugly (and it would only work in built-in
server mode). Basically, you could write out your data in a NumPy
array within the script, as if you were entering the array information
by hand, then provide that data to what's called a TrivialProducer
source. This source would stand in place of a reader. There is a
little bit of code required to do that that isn't super obvious -
before sketching it out, would this approach work for your needs?

Thanks,
Cory

Indeed, this is the workaround. The problem is that we've had folks with
Homebrew Python where we end up finding `/usr/bin/python`, the library
from the SDK, and the headers from Homebrew. This, to say the least,
tends not to work out too well. However, you usually don't know until
your `pvpython` ends up busted, so instead we put the logic in the
superbuild. That escape hatch is there to avoid the check, but you
really should be using Python bits which agree on their version.

Thanks all!  

To add to what Ken said, you can't find the OpenGL library from pvserver.  You need to cd into the lib/paraview-*.* directory, and do an ldd on libvtkRenderingOpenGL2-pv5.4.so.  This tells you where libOSMesa.so is located.

Hi guys.

My Paraview 5.4 is constantly crashing when I try to load many (~20) TIFF
files as a single time varying dataset.

I am on MAC OS 10.12.

Any clue why?

Out of memory?  Try using the View/ Memory Inspector to see if you are low on memory?

Are you by chance scrolling through your Pipeline Browser with your
mouse wheel? That is a known issue on mac OS that is fixed for
ParaView 5.5.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17890

If that's not it, there is not enough information to help diagnose the
problem you are encountering. Please choose to send a report to Apple
when the program crashes, copy the message you find in the window and
paste it in a response to this list, then cancel sending of the report
to Apple. That will at least give us a clue where ParaView is
crashing.

Thanks,
Cory

I think the python scripting with embedded data is worth a try. I'm not
familiar with the built-in vs other server modes so I'm not sure what kind
of restrictions that entails.  Probably my ultimate goal is to build a
reader plugin that will parse the data out of my application's native
format but generating a script seems like a decent interim solution.

Thanks,
Wyatt

Thanks Artem, but we have decided to complete the project without any
Paraview dependencies. The Kitware business model is not working for us.

Hi guys. Sorry.

That was the problem. When I convert RGBA to RGB everything works fine.

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Can I tie Z Axis Grid labels to the unscaled range of
 the Scalar Value used in the Warp By Scalar filter?
Message-ID: <CAHQ20ofAR0iLDYwybRt22LtVvdDcOQowEoNRA2=8LkUpWf8rmw@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to add a 3d-component to my heat maps and it looks like the
Warp By Scalar filter is the most straightforward way to map a scalar value
to the Z axis. My trouble is, the labels on the Z axis grid are not
displaying the actual range of values provided by the scalar when I change
the warp scale factor. A scale factor of 1 gives the expected axis labels,
of course, but puts my Z axis out of visual range. Is there a reasonable
way to tie the Z axis labels to the range provided by the raw scalar data,
so changing the scale factor of the warp doesn't effect Z Axis labels and
their values remain representative of my data?

Thanks,
Wyatt Spear

Message-ID: <CAFvyM3TmkRMSGZ0V=N8Nuc_6XZvCaQpcZKntv6HBafsWhuTcmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am currently writing a plugin for ml labelling purposes. I split
different volumes into slices, grid them, and label them. I currently use
the properties panel one grid (pixel) at a time (which for time purposes
isn't the best obviously). Is it possible to incorporate ParaView's
Selection Widget to get the cells that are currently highlighted in order
to change their cell labels? Thank you,

Hi, Andi Bauer,

I found that annotate time filter works in live visualization and the error occurs when output rendering components is activated.
gdb says the error occurs at vtkSMBoundsDomain.cxx: 60
? vtkPVDataInformation* info = this->GetInputInformation();
? if (info)
? {
??? double bounds[6];
??? info->GetBounds(bounds);
??? this->SetDomainValues(bounds);
? }

and the vtkPVDataInformation has the following information:

members of vtkPVDataInformation:
? DataSetType = 19,
? CompositeDataSetType = -1,
? NumberOfDataSets = 1,
? NumberOfPoints = 0,
? NumberOfCells = 1,
? NumberOfRows = 1,
? MemorySize = 1,
? PolygonCount = 0,
? Bounds = {1.0000000000000001e+299, -1.0000000000000001e+299, 1.0000000000000001e+299, -1.0000000000000001e+299, 1.0000000000000001e+299, -1.0000000000000001e+299},
? Extent = {2147483647, -2147483647, 2147483647, -2147483647, 2147483647, -2147483647},
? TimeSpan = {-1.0000000000000001e+299, 1.0000000000000001e+299},
? Time = 0.0050000000000000001,
? HasTime = 1,
? NumberOfTimeSteps = 0,
? DataClassName = 0x55555996b050 "vtkTable",
? TimeLabel = 0x0,
? CompositeDataClassName = 0x0,
? CompositeDataSetName = 0x0,
? PointDataInformation = 0x555558ec6430,
? CellDataInformation = 0x555558ec66d0,
? FieldDataInformation = 0x555558ec6770,
? VertexDataInformation = 0x555558ec6890,
? EdgeDataInformation = 0x555558ec67f0,
? RowDataInformation = 0x555558ec6370,
? CompositeDataInformation = 0x555558eb5430,
? PointArrayInformation = 0x555558ec6c50,
? PortNumber = 0

my guess is that annotate time filter is a type of vtkTable and Bounds member variable has too large values. Any idea?

I vaguely remember others using that filter with Catalyst though. Also, I think the colormap bug was fixed. If you have a way of sharing a sample that demonstrates either of those bugs I can try taking a look at the issue.

The axes are tied to the physical extent of the data, as you have
observed, not the scalar range of the array mapped to Z. You can edit
the Data Axes Grid "Z Axis Label Properties" and enable "Z Axis Use
Custom Labels" to manually set the label values to those of your data
array. It is not automatically tied to the scalar array range, though,
but the Z labels will be independent of changes to the warp scale
factor.

Another option is to use the "Data Transform" properties on the Axes
Grid. In the "Edit" Axes Grid dialog, if you press the gear icon to
show advanced properties, you'll see the "Data Transform" properties.
For example, if I scale my dataset by (1, 1, 10), I can set the "Data
Scale" to (1, 1, 10) and I'll get labels matching the original
unscaled range.

Hope that helps.

Loius,

Looks like what you have is quite reasonable. You can drop the
"Extract Surface" filter and simply connect the "Plot On Intersection
Curves" to the "Merge Blocks" as the "Plot On .." filter does an
"Extract Surface" internally.

Another option, if you want finer control over the sampling resolution
would be to use the "Resample With Dataset" filter" with a custom
source that correponds to the sampling locations. I created one by
using a Sphere source and then slicing it. State attached. By changing
the resolution of the Sphere, you can change the refinement.

Hope that helps

Hello, guys,

I have a problem of showing files, *_broken_joint_* , *n my Paraview.
Please see them in the attachment in this email. Currently, both the
version of 4.2 and 5.* cannot work successfully on these files. My Graphic

Could you help me figure out this problem.

Thank you.

X. Y.,

Your cells seem odd. Try changing the representation type to
"Wireframe", you'll see a grid. Then use spreadsheet view, in "Cell
Data" mode, clicking on each cells to see if the cell seems correct.
You have cells that form lines and hence the default "surface"
representation is failing to render it correctly.

Hello, Utkarsh,

When I changed the representation type to "Wireframe", it still did not
work. But if I copy these files to another computer, the grid can be shown.
This seems to be some sort of incompatibility or bugs of Paraview with my
computer.

May you help me to solve this imcompatibility issue?

Thank you.

Xiang-Yu.

In theory the Data Transform should be ideal. I didn't see it before
because I was looking at the 'Data Axes Grid' which doesn't have that
option instead of the 'Axes Grid' which does.

It seemed to work on less extreme scales but when I had to scale my warp by
.00001 and set the same value to the Z Axis Data Scale the axes exploded
out of view-ability. I'm not sure what's going on there; I had assumed that
this would only change the labels and not the size of the axes.

Thanks,
Wyatt

Sounds like a bug. If you can put together a small example to
reproduce the issue and report it here [1], we can track it down.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Not Reading Some Fields in Dataset
Message-ID: <CAKneYkywENFL=NXh2WExYn4eEL-v4R58t-4W5Zxi_oVHdfAWGw@mail.gmail.com>

I've output a vtu file from a CFD code. When trying to load the dataset
into Paraview I get the following errors:

[CODE]Error reading uncompressed binary data header. Read 0 of 4 bytes.
ERROR: In
C:\bbd\7cc78367\source-paraview\VTK\IO\XMLParser\vtkXMLDataParser.cxx, line
609 vtkXMLDataParser (0000009CC7674520): Error reading uncompressed binary
data header. Read 0 of 4 bytes.

Cannot read point data array "Cyl_Velocity" from PointData in piece 0. The
data array in the element may be too short. ERROR: In
C:\bbd\7cc78367\source-paraview\VTK\IO\XML\vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 443
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0000009C837CFCE0): Cannot read point data
array "Cyl_Velocity" from PointData in piece 0. The data array in the
element may be too short.[/CODE]

If I ask Paraview to not read the offending arrays, it reads the other
arrays in fine. From these errors, it seems the data file has some issues
with a few specific arrays.

Upon inspection of the first part of the vtu file, the offending arrays
(Cyl_Velocity and Rel_Velocity) have negative offsets.

The CFD code also can output data files for a specific surface. When I load
one of those into Paraview, it has no issues with any data array in that
file, and everything works fine.

Upon inspection of the first part of a single surface vtu file with no
issues, no array has a negative offset.

So I think the offset sign is relevant to my problem, but I don't really
know what it means or how to fix it. Does anyone know what I can do to fix
my data set, or at least know what the underlying problem is?

Thank you.

It looks like you have integer overflow (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow). I'd suggest using a
datatype with more precision and see if that fixes the issue.

Message-ID: <FE8DF8A0F0A2DF49B370F02586E8D7B4198EF0BF@MBX116.d.ethz.ch>

Hi,

I am having problems using paraview because the whole window doesnt display properly. Meaning that the upper bar with File View etc is not displayed, but when I move the courser where the symbols should be the drop down menu shows up. Also the whole window seems slightly unfocused. Some buttons are where they are supposed to be and some arent really where they appear to be. It's very weird. I tried different paraview version etc and always have the same problem.
I've attached a screenshot to this mail.

It works totally fine on my other computer...

Best,
Richard

This may be same as the issue described here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17499
Try switching to NVidia GPU, if you can, if Intel graphics is indeed
the issue in your case.

Dear Community,


I've recently upgraded to ParaView 5.4.1 since ParaView 5.0.0 stopped working on my workstation. Therefore, I've downloaded and unpacked ParaView-5.4.1-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz, however, receive the following error message upon execution:


Warning: In /home/buildslave/dashboards/buildbot/paraview-pvbinsdash-linux-shared-release_superbuild/build/superbuild/paraview/src/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 838
vtkGenericOpenGLRenderWindow (0x3846580): VTK is designed to work with OpenGL version 3.2 but it appears it has been given a context that does not support 3.2. VTK will run in a compatibility mode designed to work with earlier versions of OpenGL but some features may not work.

Segmentation fault


I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on my workstation and should probably mention that I receive this error message right after execution of 'paraview', i.e., the Graphical User Interface never appears. Does anybody have a similar problem or know on how to resolve this issue? Thanks!


Best, Thomas

Thomas,

Check your graphics drivers. You can use tools like `glxinfo` to tell
you which OpenGL version is supported. ParaView now requires 3.2 or
newer. If you cannot upgrade your graphics drivers, you can use
software OpenGL implementation packaged by ParaView binaries as
follows:

Loius,

Looks like what you have is quite reasonable. You can drop the
"Extract Surface" filter and simply connect the "Plot On Intersection
Curves" to the "Merge Blocks" as the "Plot On .." filter does an
"Extract Surface" internally.

Another option, if you want finer control over the sampling resolution
would be to use the "Resample With Dataset" filter" with a custom
source that correponds to the sampling locations. I created one by
using a Sphere source and then slicing it. State attached. By changing
the resolution of the Sphere, you can change the refinement.

Hope that helps

Utkarsh

Dear Utkarsh,


I really appreciate your immediate response, thanks! I've check the graphics drivers as you suggested:


tf13 at bioeng087-pc:~$ glxinfo
name of display: :0
X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext
Major opcode of failed request:  155 (GLX)
Minor opcode of failed request:  6 (X_GLXIsDirect)
Serial number of failed request:  26
Current serial number in output stream:  26

In addition, execution of './paraview --mesa' works, meaning there's an issue with the graphics drivers?

Best, Thomas

That'd be my guess.

Hmm, that's weird. The Polar Axes should be off by default. Do the
Polar Axes appear when creating a Sphere source?

You should be able to force it off by adding the following line to the
loadFile() function in your script:

display.PolarAxes.Visibility = 0

HTH,

I found a solution to the problem. The CFD code was writing the offsets
incorrectly. When I adjust them manually, Paraview can read the file just
fine.

This thread goes into a little more detail:

Wyatt,

Here's a simple script that sets up a 200 x 200 image data object like
you might use for displaying a heat map.

#### import the simple module from the paraview
from paraview.simple import *
#### disable automatic camera reset on 'Show'
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

# Create a 2D image data object
from paraview import vtk
vtk_image = vtk.vtkImageData()
vtk_image.SetDimensions(200, 200, 1) # Your size may vary

# Wrap data in numpy interface
from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
image = dsa.WrapDataObject(vtk_image)

# Create numpy array. Set your data here
import numpy as np
arr = np.zeros(200*200)

# Set the data in the image object
image.PointData.append(arr, 'myarray')

# Now set up a ParaView proxy for the image data
tp = PVTrivialProducer()
tp.GetClientSideObject().SetOutput(vtk_image)
Show(tp)


# Set up filters, display options, etc. below


You can modify it as needed to set up your data array as a numpy array.

Hope that helps,
Cory

I don't know it is related or not. I have very similar behavior under 5.4.1. If i save a state and load it later, Polar Axes show up and i need to disable it from the properties panel. Somehow, ParaView loads Polar Axes even if it is not activated in the original pipeline. It might help to find the source of the issue.

Best Regards,

--ufuk

Hmm, that's weird. The Polar Axes should be off by default. Do the
Polar Axes appear when creating a Sphere source?

You should be able to force it off by adding the following line to the
loadFile() function in your script:

display.PolarAxes.Visibility = 0

HTH,
Cory

Sorry for the delayed response, thanks for looking at this. I subscribed to the issue in GitLab.

Hey Mark,

Looks like we took that out as part of the revamp described here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/15917

Specifically this merge request took out the "No. Frames" entry.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/896
because, at least at that time, apparently the control didn't do anything at all.

A 1 commit merge request that restores the widget and hooks it up to do what it apparently did at one time is
here. https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/2197

Hello,

In ParaView 5.3.0 and earlier, when Animation mode was Snap to TimeSteps, in the Save Animation dialog box there was an option for No. of Frames / timestep. This doesn?t show up in the 5.4.0 dialog box. Was this just moved or was it removed completely?

My use case for this is a data set with 25 timesteps, each of which is on the order of either 5 minutes or 30 minutes apart in real world time. I?d render 30 frames / timestep to get a 25 second movie to show each discrete timestep for one second. The video should show those discrete jumps in time and not use interpolation.

I can do the frame replication in BASH but it was handy to have that option.

Thanks,
Mark

Ufuk,

Thanks for the report. Is there a reliable way to reproduce the
behavior that you can share?

Best,
Cory

Somehow, ParaView loads Polar Axes even if it is not activated in the original pipeline. It might help to find the source of the issue.

Hi Jens,

I was not able to reproduce the missing data in the bottom render view.

As for the legend size changing, I explained it and how to fix it in
your issue https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17938

Thanks,
Cory

The data that I'm generating has a set of scalar values for every point in
the 2D matrix, so a single data row looks like
xcoord, ycoord, zcord(probably superfluous), scalar1, scalar2,...scalarN
Since the data in your example is being rendered as an image directly I'm
not sure how I could incorporate different scalar data which can be
selected from the UI, as I can when running the table-to-points filter on a
loaded CSV file.

Is there a way to have a python macro cause ParaView to request a file
selection through the UI? Then I could have this single macro loaded and it
could process any CSV file I select.

Thanks,
Wyatt
