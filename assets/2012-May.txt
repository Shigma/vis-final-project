Dear All,

This is Shimoyama Tomohisa from Japan.

Thank everyone for quickly reply,
I completed to clearly express 3-D picture.

I have one question.
I am used to do GMT, so I would like to exchange  *vtk file to *grd or *xyz
file.

Can I do this? I do not know how to exchange.

If someone knows how to do, please let me teach.

Cheers.

Shimoyama Tomohisa

Hi,
I'm from Japan too. :)


Almost all users may be trying to do postprocessing
all data on ParaView.
So I think it's pretty difficult to get informations
about converters from VTK.

If you want to convert VTK to other format,
this document might help you.
> http://paraview.org/Wiki/Data_formats

VTK format is open and easy to read.
How to try to convert yourself?

I already have python-vtk installed and have had it installed the whole 
time together with paraview-python - still I got the problem I mentioned 
in the initial post...

I feel more safe in terms of conflicting behaviour when I use ubuntu 
package manager for as many things as possible. If everything else 
fails, however, I'll try to follow your suggestion and compile from source..

Hi Sebastien,

I did wrote a plugin that was exactly doing what you want but it was
relying on the Generic framework of VTK:
http://vtk.org/VTK/img/AdaptorFramework.pdf

It was using a third party library for the field interpolation
computation. Unfortunately I don't know if that code can be released.
On the other hand, I'm not sure that would be easy to understand as it
also has some optimization that was specific to the file format used.

But I can certainly try to help and guide you using the mailing list,

Seb

Message-ID: <561DA372-50E7-40AB-BFC6-5426E14263EA@bluequartz.net>

Once I have finally been able to get coerce ParaView/Superbuild to actually compile all the way through, just how do I create a "Distribution" or install it somewhere of my choosing? I tried running ccmake and setting the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX but that didn't not effect any of the projects.
   All I am really after (ON OS X) is the fixup-bundle so my plugin can get it's internal library paths adjusted to match what the Kitware distribution is. I have a plugin that I want to post to my website that works with the downloadable version of ParaView is my end goal.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAEqXkzfteinUzK49PdhK=suydsY=0PvLvoeBO+yT2bLUQEHiuQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am attempting to run the SuperBuild for ParaView Version 3.14.1
(Source downloaded from link on downloads page). At least when
building a 32 bit windows executable using VS 2008 SP1 the png gives a
few installation errors. It can not find and therefor install the
following files:

libpng-config
libpng15-config
libpng.pc
libpng15.pc

Not sure if this is causing my other build issues later on but just
wanted to mention this.

I somehow got SuperBuild to compile in win64 mode to get 64 bit
binaries. Not sure where the failure between the 2 lies.

Thanks for any help or clarifications.

Subject: [Paraview] headless paraview installation
Message-ID: <CAHoiV3agZTj0LR6Cg5hUQmk=0tFS+mg6P+NMz=TvkS7S=DX67Q@mail.gmail.com>

We are interested in using paraviewweb in
our lab and integrate it with the segmentation
tools we are developing.

We were able to install and use paraviewweb on my
local machine. All the examples, shuttle, service etc
worked as expected.

Our second installation was on a server without X.
The installation went fine but webgl does not
seem to work for this installation however JS, Java, Flex are
all working. Could this be related to the graphics card of
the machine ? I am not a paraview or GL expert but if
paraview is doing server side rendering and the graphics
card is not compatible for webgl, then this would be a
problem I guess ?

Any clues are greatly appreciated.

Hi Cagatay,

What version of PVW are you using?

I installed PVW on a headless AWS server last Aug and WebGL rendering
wouldn't work because of a bug
in  vtkPVSynchronizedRenderWindows::GetIsInCave()

To fix the bug, just replace the method body with "return false;"

I would think that the bug has been fixed in a release version since then
though.

Hi guys,

the WebGL export need to be requested by the client. Is the issue
happening with the sample applications or with a custom one ?
Do you know if switching back to another render just work or as
Goodwin suggested a segfault occurred ?
You can look at the log files in the working.dir/logs/pw-xxxx.log

Moreover, which version of ParaView are you using ? 3.14.1 ?

Using the latest ParaView solved the problem.
We were using 3.12 before. There were quite
a few hacks that we had to do to get things working.

It is a joy to watch once things start rolling :)

I compiled paraview 3.14 on snowleopard, with the cmake OSX variables set
to 10.5 so that the resulting binary would run on everything above leopard.

For the vistrails plugin in 3.14 I built it against the super built
paraview, and then used a modified version of the script that Filipe
posted to the list (http://markmail.org/thread/l6ks36ra7ont466p) to
fixup the library paths. (ie otool -L to see what the lib names are
are install_name_tool to make them all be relative to either the
paraview install location or the plugin package itself.)

Glad to hear that you solved your problem.

And please share your "hacks" if you think they could be useful to
other or if something can be improved in ParaViewWeb itself...

Thanks,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] 3D scalar field contour visualisation not working from
	CSV
Message-ID: <CAAWB-0d8B9XaFJCqjgfjTQZ2ugCJ-FzVrzbfwaYUcSMxbbGUnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been trying to create contour and slice maps from a csv file
(x,y,z,data1,data2) where x,y,z form a regular 3d array.

I have no problems importing and visualising the data by selecting
open-->table to points, then displaying and colouring the points by data1
or data2.

The problem is that if I then select contour of slice filters, I get the
options, but nothing displayed (the wire-frame of the slice is displayed,
but no actual interpolated slice map. Nothing at all for contour.)
In contour, I cannot select 'compute scalars' either (it is greyed out).

thanks in advance for your help!

Best,

Apply the Delauney filter to fill in space between the infinately
small point samples you've got, then the slice and contour filters
will have something to cut into.

I took a look at that page a it struck me that at least one of the errors (ncconfig.h.in) is clearly a bug. From the wiki page are your hints:

? Problems with vtkNetCDF when building win32 with MSVC2008:
? The error message was paraview-3.14.1-superbuild\include\H5public.h(133) : error C2632: 'int' followed by 'int' is illegal.
? To fix this, go to the folder ParaView-xxx-SuperBuild\ParaView-build\VTK\Utilities\vtknetcdf and edit the file ncconfig.h.

The relevant lines are:

/* Define to `int' if system doesn't define.  */
#cmakedefine ssize_t @ssize_t@

Those lines should probably be:

#ifndef ssize_t
#cmakedefine ssize_t @ssize_t@
#endif

 Because the issue is that NetCDF pulls in HDF5 and ssize_t is already defined in H5public.h.

My other question to the Kitware folks is that why are the NOT getting this error on their builds? I'll assume they are NOT getting the error because nothing in the SuperBuild would indicate this type of patch is needed for their builds?

That didn't work. I think because in H5public.h ssize_t is a typedef and NetCDF is using a #define instead? My c fu isn't that strong to figure it out. I'll just comment it out and move on.

Subject: [Paraview] Calculating rms values using the Temporal Statistics
	filter
Message-ID: <5241B35CC134BE4DBC1DFF0CAEE271372C43D9BB@rexma.intranet.epfl.ch>

Hello all,

I would like to calculate rms values for my simulations.

For example, for the calculations of the axial velocity u'rms = sqr( ( (u')^2)_ave )

I first need to calculate the fluctuations, u'_x = u_x - u_x_ave.

I obtain:
1) u_x via the calculator.
2) u_x_ave using the temporal statistics filter

The problem that I am having is subtracting them from each other. I have tried in two ways.

a) calculating 1) and 2) in separate branches but then I cannot see the variables from each
b) calculating 1) and 2) in the same branch but then I do not have access to u_x because the statistical filter averages it out.


Any help is appreciated.

Best regards,
Janusz

You should be able to use method (a) and then use the append attributes filter to combine the fields in the two branches into one dataset.

Hi,

I use Visual Studio 2008 Professional to generate the ParaView binaries and
have to do no modification of Silo or NetCDF. I feel the problem might be
related to using a older version of CMake that isn't properly executing all
the custom build steps. We have a custom step for Silo that does upgrade
the solution file.

The install issue with png feels like that it is not properly building the
project. The png project doesn't have any fancy custom steps, so I wonder
if it is a time stamp issue and ExternalProject thinks png is built when it
actually isn't. If you fully
remove the png-build and png-prefix directories does it properly build and
install than?

Hi,

is it possible to change the representation from 'surface' to 
'wireframe' in an animation similar e.g. to changing the visibility from 
'off' to 'on'?

I am running CMake 2.8.7 for these builds. I am also using VS2008 SP1 for the build because I need it match exactly the Kitware build environment. I didn't do anything special in the install of Visual Studio. I did put the CMake installation in C:/Applications (where I put some other items).

 I pulled the ParaView source from the ParaView download page and unpacked it.

 I do run Windows 7 x64 Ult in a Parallels Virtual Machine hosted on OS X 10.6.8. The VM has 4 CPUs and 4GB of Memory. The host system has 32GB of RAM.

The other interesting part is that I tool a look at my HDF5 1.8.7 source (Directly from the HDF5 group) and the H5public.h file is different from that included with VTK/Utilities. In the VTK/Utilities/vtkhdf5 version there is an extra
#ifdef WIN32
#undef ssize_t
#endif

Which I am not sure why it is needed. I see that the version of HDF5 that is included with VTK is HDF5 1.8.5-post2 which was still being developed. The latest is 1.8.8 with a soon to be released 1.8.9. I know there have been some bug fixes to the CMake files in these later versions. Maybe that would help to update HDF5 to a slightly newer version. 
   I build HDF5 in both 32 and 64 bit without issues on windows all the time.

 Comments Welcome.

I feel the problem might be related to using a older version of CMake that isn't properly executing all the custom build steps. We have a custom step for Silo that does upgrade the solution file.

Hi Paul,

your vtk class are not "python" wrapped automatically when provided
from plugin. But you might be able to use a CMake macro that has been
defined in ParaView to force your vtk classes to be Python wrapped.
Although, I'm not fully certain that will just work.
Unfortunately I don't have much insight on where to look.

Dave DeMarle might be able to point you to the right direction...

I'm not sure this is what you're looking for but the proxy does get wrapped
such that it's available through pvpython and pvbatch.  When you load the
plugin, do "LoadPlugin("<shared lib location>", True, globals())" and it
should be available.  If you're want the actual VTK class to by python
wrapped, I think Sebastien is correct though.

I'm actually wanting the VTK classes rather than the proxy.

Sebastian: are you referring to the VTK_WRAP_PYTHON_SIP option?  I don't
have that enabled atm but could try...

Thanks,

Hi Paul,

it is not a CMake option but a CMake macro/function that need to be
called inside your Plugin CMake file... But I have no clue how, has I
took another path when I solved that exact same problem.
In my case, I simply extended ParaView itself instead of relying on a plugin...

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Building

1) There is no field CORE_SERVICE_URL
 CORE_SERVICE_URL           http://localhost:8080/PWService     <---- Use
the deployment address otherwise the sample

2) The following fields have different names. This was not that hard to
figure anyway.

JAVA_ARCHIVE               /opt/jdk1.6.0_18/bin/jar
  JAVA_RUNTIME               /opt/jdk1.6.0_18/bin/java
  JAVA_COMPILE               /opt/jdk1.6.0_18/bin/javac


3) ParaviewAdapter and PWServer used interchangeable, which confused me.

4) All the components (PWAdapter, PWService, PWApp, PWConsole) are being
installed to the same directory install-pw. I am not sure why one
needs to do these one by one, when we have cmake. This process could
possiblly be automated.



http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_with_system_tomcat_package

5) The following fields should be filled as well
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY
OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR   OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND

however OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY should be left empty. This is reported in
one of the kitware forums. I guess it was vtk issue tracker.

The last issue that I remember is that, Paraview was trying to run
PWServer from / directory. Not sure why, but we had to put a link
there.

Thank Cagatay for your feedback,

I'll update the wiki.
For the point 4: we do have a super build now that automate all that
process and the point of that documentation was to illustrate each
pieces independently from each other instead of explaining the setup
for a monolithic system. But I agree this can be confusing, that's why
I finally wrote the super build that basically build everything for
you as well as fetching the third party.

Subject: [Paraview] Calculation of eigenvalues of velocity tensors
Message-ID: <5241B35CC134BE4DBC1DFF0CAEE271372C43DADB@rexma.intranet.epfl.ch>

Hello all,

Has anyone tried to compute the eigenvalues of tensors?

In particular, I am interested in plotting the isosurface of the second eigenvalue of S^2+Omega^2 where S and Omega are the symmetric and antisymetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor \nabla U.

Thank you in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview handles data different on MacOS
Message-ID: <4FA23D56.8050308@rwth-aachen.de>

Dear Paraview developers and users,

I am using Paraview (3.14.1) to visualize the solution of a simulation 
program. The program generates data files in vtp format (ASCII). A 
representative file is attached.
Using Paraview on Windows 7 (64 Bit)  or ubuntu12.04 (32 Bit) everything 
works, but on Mac OS X (64 Bit) it crashes after clicking on the 
'Apply'-Button or gives the message:

Is there anything I can do to handle this Mac OS specific problem?

Edit your file and change types from 32 to 64 (Int32 -> Int64, Float32 -> Float64).

    Dear Paraview developers and users,

    

    I am using Paraview (3.14.1) to visualize the solution of a
    simulation program. The program generates data files in vtp format
    (ASCII). A representative file is attached.

    Using Paraview on Windows 7 (64 Bit)  or ubuntu12.04 (32 Bit)
    everything works, but on Mac OS X (64 Bit) it crashes after clicking
    on the 'Apply'-Button or gives the message:

     'ERROR: In
    /Source/ParaView/release/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line
    510 vtkXMLPolyDataReader (0x126f7c220): 

     Cannot read point data array "my_scalars" from PointData in piece
    0. The data array in the element may be too short.'

    

    Is there anything I can do to handle this Mac OS specific problem?

    

    Thanks for help,

    Fabian

I can confirm the crash on OS X. Here is the top part of the stack trace:

Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000000

And the same file works just fine on Windows 7 x64 using both a 32 bit and 64 bit ParaView. Odd. I don't think changing the floats->doubles is going to solve the problem. I did find some blank lines in the file, removed those but still crashed on OS X.

Changing the type attributes of the data arrays from e.g. float32 to 
float64 solved the problem on Mac OS X.

Hi Janusz,

If you have image data there is a filter for this.

Hi,

Is it possible to format cube axis now, i.e. font size, line weight
etc ? If yes, can someone please guide me how?
I have seen the request for this before, haven't been able to find if
the solution is already available.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug in setting negative extents in Wavelet and
	Mandelbrot source
Message-ID: <CANmPiKDH6yAAF010eoYUgthujbNvFLJQ3wStDZXcUBvwSfwuew@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running ParaView 3.14.1 on Mac OS X. When I use either the Wavelet
or Mandelbrot sources and try to modify the extent in any dimension to
be negative, something strange happens if I clear out the text field
first before editing it. When I type the negative sign -, the number 1
is inserted. If the text field is not empty, I can move the cursor to
the front of the line edit widget and insert a negative sign if there
isn't one already. The Windows version of 3.14.1 also shows this
behavior.

This behavior does not occur in ParaView 3.12.0 on Mac OS X or Windows.

The common theme might be that the <IntVectorProperty> element for the
extent parameters defined in
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/sources.xml have an
<IntRangeDomain name="range"/> element that isn't being handled
properly. Perhaps something changed in how text field formatting is
handled in ParaView 3.14.1? I haven't yet found a smoking gun.

Thanks,
Cory

No, at present you cannot change font size or line width.  A quick look did not turn up a specific feature request for this functionality.  Please add one to the bug tracker.

I am trying to build a web application that
can visualize different objects by the use
of a drop down bar. I do not want to create
new connections or sessions every time the
user changes object to be visualized. I've
been trying the whole morning and could not
figure out how to i) delete the current view,
ii) set it to the view view and iii) refresh the
page. Here is what I have so far.

You can convert between any two compatible VTK formats using something
like this:

Subject: [Paraview] Can't open any file after paraview crashed
Message-ID: <CABnFT4XxdoMXb1TyynKdWEVRbrW0LWTu9EtucK67gy2SmhOWNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
One of our paraview users crashed paraview, probably because of a problem
with the data. But now he can't open any file. The paraview window comes
up, lets you select a case but then paraview gets stuck. Nothing happens in
Display tab for instance.
It works for other users as well as for this particular user if I create a
new home directory for him. So I suspect there a file somewhere that
paraview loads on start up that makes it freeze but I can't find this file.
We are using paraview version 3.14.1 that I installed from the binaries on
a Linux Centos 5.8 (kernel 2.6.18-194.32.1.el5).
Any clue?
Thanks,
David

Hi Cagatay,

does your data needs to be a ParaView state file, our would it be
better if it was some other VTK compatible file ?

Normally loading a state file should re-initialize everything, so the

activeView = paraview.CreateIfNeededRenderView();
paraview.ResetCamera();
activeView.setCenterOfRotation(activeView.getCameraFocalPoint());

should be redone and all the renderer should be re-init with the new view id.

Something is corrupted in his .config/ParaView/ParaView3.14.1.ini
file. (Or  %APPDATA%\ParaView\ParaView3.14.1.ini on windows).

Copy that to something else, and have him reload the data.

Comparing the new one ParaView generates to the corrupted one should
show what exactly got corrupted.

It only re-initializes if I create another session like this
paraview.createSession("Shuttle", "", "default");
but I think I shouldn't be creating a new session
just to see a different object.

I am completely ok with using different file formats. All
I am trying to do is to minimize the paraviewweb-js-python
scripting part as I have very limited experience there.  That's
why I was using state files. Is it better to use something else ?

Thank you,
Cagatay

Well there is several way to deal with what you want to achieve.

1) if all the data that you are interested are kind of small then you
can all load them and just call "paraview.Show({proxy: objA})" or
"paraview.Hide({proxy: objA})"

To get the proper references of objA, objB, ..., from the state file,
you can query ParaView for that like that:

var objA = paraview.FindSource( { name: "nameInPipelineBrowserInParaView" });

2) if you really want to load and unload them, you will have to
re-init the renderers as I was saying in one of my previous mail. Just
let me know if you want to take that route, I can try to explain more.

Hope that give you enough hints,

Seb

Hi Seb,

The first option will not scale. We will
have a growing number of tissue samples
to be visualized and this option will be
infeasible soon.

I am already re-initializing the renderer
with the new activeview. The minimal
example illustrating the issue is here

var renderers = {};
var paraview;
var activeView;
var basePath = 'data/';
var dataFile = 'sphere.pvsm';

paraview = new Paraview(serverUrl);
paraview.createSession("Shuttle", "", "default");

function start(){
  paraview.LoadState({filename: basePath + dataFile});
  activeView = paraview.CreateIfNeededRenderView();
  paraview.ResetCamera();
  activeView.setCenterOfRotation(activeView.getCameraFocalPoint());

  paraview.updateConfiguration(true, "JPEG", "WebGL");
  renderers.webgl = new WebGLRenderer("webglRenderer", serverUrl);
  renderers.webgl.init(paraview.sessionId, activeView.__selfid__);

  // Use webgl as default
  renderers.current = renderers.webgl;
  renderers.current.bindToElementId("renderercontainer");
  renderers.current.start();

  // Update render size
  updateSize();
}
...
function switchData(){
  dataFile = 'cone.pvsm';
  start();
}

This script successfully loads the sphere but
does not switch to cone. If I move the
paraview.createSession("Shuttle", "", "default");
in to start function, things start working as expected:
Sphere is visualized first, and cone is loaded and
visualized when the button is clicked at the cost of
an unnecessary session. I am trying to do things
cleanly, and do not want to have dangling sessions
for no reason.

Thank you for your help,
Cagatay

Hello Roberto,

I have the same messages when launching paraview.
Did you find a solution ?

I needed to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors from a tensor recently and 
wrote a macro to do it.  I'll attach it.

Hum,

I will have to do it myself to see exactly what is going on.
Unfortunately there is no clean way to cleanup the proxies of
ParaView, so you know that you start from fresh for each data.
I'm wondering if calling Diconnect() before loading the new data could
solve the issue.

On the other hand, in your current code, I don't see any "unbind" of
your renderer which could end-up being on the top of the new one you
just create. Did you double check that the view id that you get is
different ?

Subject: [Paraview] VisIt Plugin Bridge
Message-ID: <CAMOfXyORDDCJyyQiiEZe3uy2z3kVdjXADDfkgRANqLWrGOrCxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to compile a VisIt plugin for ParaView using the VIsIt
Bridge Plugin.
(Version 3.14.1 of ParaView, compiled from source, with the VisIt
Bridge enabled)

My custom (working with VisIt 2.4.2) VisIt plugin is in the relative
directory ../cnsVisIt and there are some extra include files needed
which are in ../ and ../coreSystem/include
I am building the ParaView plugin in a separate directory from the
VisIt one to avoid clashes.

My CMakeLists.txt is as follows:

PROJECT(CNSVisIt)

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(../cnsVisIt ../ ../coreSystem/include)

SET(SOURCES
 ../cnsVisIt/avtcnsVisItFileFormat.C
 )

ADD_DEFINITIONS("-DUSE_EXPRESSION_TEMPLATES")

ADD_VISIT_PLUGIN_READER(cnsVisItReader "1.0"
  VISIT_READER_NAME "avtcnsVisItFileFormat"
  VISIT_READER_TYPE "STMD"
  VISIT_READER_FILE_PATTERN "hdf"
  SERVER_SOURCES ${SOURCES}
  )

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(CNSVisIt vtkVisItAVTAlgorithms)
---------EOF----------------

However, when I run "cmake ." I get:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES):
  Cannot specify link libraries for target "CNSVisIt" which is not built by
  this project.

If I replace TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES by LINK_LIBRARIES then cmake works,
and then running make results in a file libcnsVisItReader.so but this
does not contain the symbols _ZN21avtcnsVisItFileFormatC1EPKc or
_ZTI21avtcnsVisItFileFormat. As far as I can tell, the file
avtcnsVisItFileFormat.C is not being compiled and linked at all, which
would explain why these symbols are missing.

The include files and ../cnsVisIt/avtcnsFileFormat.h files are
definitely being picked up since I get some compiler warnings from
them (due to a redefinition of VERSION which is nothing to do with
VisIt or ParaView).

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong?

Thanks,

Philip

Thanks; that removes the issue with "Cannot specify..." but it still
doesn't compile and link the avtcnsVisItFileFormat.C file.

Hi Philip,

Can you please explicitly state in the SOURCES list the header and
implementation file, that fixes the issue for me.

OK, that now compiles avtcnsVisItFileFormat.cxx correctly. I now get
undefined symbols from external libraries, but I should be able to
figure out how to link those in.

Thanks for your help,

Philip

I think you are using and older user guide.
The 2004 book describes the "File->Save Batch Script" functionality of
the ParaView 2.x releases.

The 2007 book describes the corresponding "File->Save State"
functionality of the early ParaView 3.x releases.

For late 3.x releases, see the "Persistent Sessions" section of:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Introduction
and
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Batch_Processing

adding the following line did not change anything
renderers.current.unbindToElementId('renderercontainer');
and I do not know how to check the view id

Calling disconnect and connecting again would
indeed solve the problem but why would anyone
want to do that? I am already connected, all I want
to do is load some other data. You do not
connect/disconnect for every query you are going
to execute on database, so why do it here ?

Is there a paravievweb document I can read somewhere,
like the ITK or VTK books? That would help greatly.

Thank you,
Cagatay

By disconnect, I mean the python method Disconnect that basically
reset the ServerManager layer without stoping ParaView.

To print the view id, if you are using firebug or any development
javascript console you can see the output of some JavaScript code if
you write

console.log(activeView.__selfid__)

or if you prefer a popup window, you can call

alert(activeView.__selfid__)

Most of the documentation is on the wiki of ParaView or inside the
sample codes in the git repo.

Hi Seb,
I am completely lost here. I tried the disconnect,
and as I was expecting the render window is
gone and I do not see any visualization. I would
guess I will need to reconnect again.

The view id is the same before and after.
The datafile is correctly changed though.
I guess that is the problem ?

Hi Seb,

There is really not much in my pipeline at the
moment. I will do offline rendering using vtk,
save the vtp file, and load it on paraviewweb.
At the moment I play with sphere and cone
objects.

I uploaded the application here with the state files
http://vision.lbl.gov/People/bilgin/PWShuttle.tar.gz

Thank you,
Cagatay

Subject: [Paraview] Install ParaView on a specified directory
Message-ID: <83016249-292C-4981-B4FC-73B989FE55DF@mac.com>

Hi all,


I built ParaView with helpful advices of the ML's users.

Now I want to install ParaView on a specified directory.
(ex. /usr/local/paraview-3.14.1)
There appeared to be a parameter such as CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX,
so I set it as "/usr/local/paraview-3.14.1" and ran configure.

The installation looked successfully finished.
Additionally I appended libraries' paths to /etc/ld.so.conf.
I could execute "/usr/local/paraview-3.14.1/bin/paraview"
and everything looked fine.

But if I made symbolic link as
"ln -s /usr/local/paraview-3.14.1/bin/paraview /usr/local/bin/paraview"
and tried to execute "paraview", I got an error as below:
> Error converting executable file "/usr/local/bin/../lib/paraview-3.14/paraview"
> to real path: No such file or directory

Which is the best way to change the installation directory
and execute with a symbolic link on /usr/local/bin?

"paraview" executable expects to find the libs either the standard
libs locations or that specified by LD_LIBRARY_PATH or under a
relative path <exe_dir>../lib/paraview-3.14 (from memory, so may be
slightly different). When you make a symbolic link, you end up messing
this "search" logic.

One solution is to use patchelf (http://nixos.org/patchelf.html) to
add the location of the libs to the rpath for every executable you're
creating the symlink for.

Hi all,

I have a pvbatch script that worked in version 3.12. It uses plot over line and writes out CSV data.  Now I get the following error in version 3.14:

Is this a bug or am I supposed to call the writer differently in 3.14?

Thanks!

Tony

Hi Utkarsh,


Thanks for your advice.
I tried patchelf, but I couldn't get expected result.

The best way now I found was to add a path to /usr/local/paraview-3.14.1/bin.
I'll do it for a time.

Hmm interesting. I haven't used patchelf myself, I'll play with it at
some point and document the best way to do such things.

Subject: [Paraview] animation with timesteps of varying size
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E05073E3E@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I have a transient simulation where the timestep changes. When I save an animation, each timestep has the same length in the resulting movie, so the timescale is distorted.
Now I want to create an animation where the timestep size is taken into account, so that the progress of the simulation is to scale in time. Can this be done in paraview?

Thank you,

Matthias

Matthias,

Refer to section "Animation View Header" on page 128 (132) of "ParaView
Users Guide v3.14.pdf" shipped with the binary releases and learn about
Real Time mode, Snap To TimeSteps mode and Sequence mode. The Temporal
Interpolator filter (and Temporal Cache) may come in handy for your use
case, too.

Thank you Karl, Real Time Mode was what I was looking for. I just hadn't discovered the Animation View before.

Subject: [Paraview] Wrong coordinates when reading text tecplot file
Message-ID: <CANtqHwzYoJwVChOyqYGWtxXA3ir1akXnqhyUXyHk-Q9kpJ3spQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
We encountered a problem when reading a text tecplot file using both VisIt
reader and the old Paraview reader.
The coordinates (at least the Z component in the sample test) (not the X,
Y, Z, as scalar variables) are taken from different variable than the X, Y,
Z themselves. Due to that problem some filters that use the coordinates
fail, for instance "Plot on intersection curves".
Attached is a file that demonstrates that problem.

Open the file->information tab->bounds, The Z range is actually the one of
the K variable, Z as a scalar variable is correct (about ~2)
Try to use Plot On Intersection Curves using Z Normal nothing comes out,
attempt to fix the default coordinates of the plot filter does not help.
Only overriding the coords with the calculator and saving K to a different
variable (again with the calculator) makes it possible to use the file, it
is a very annoying solution, however it bypasses the bug.
I will appreciate it very much if a fix that corrects that bug will be
available.
Thanks
Yonadav

Is there a reference somewhere that says what the color table format that paraview can import is? I think it is some sort of XML file if I remember correctly.

Thanks

I don't think it is documented anywhere.

It is easy to put one together though by exporting a color map by
clicking "Save" and then "Export" on the "Color Scale Editor" dialog
and opening up the resulting xml file in a text editor. It also helps
to look at: Qt/Components/pqColorPresetManager::importColorMap()

Hi Guys,

I think it is minimally documented on the wiki.

http://paraview.org/Wiki/Colormaps

A couple months ago I added 91 new lut's there. They are huge help for 
making nice pseudo color plots, but they are cumbersome when volume 
rendering since opacity is tied to each of the 256 color points. 
changing the transfer function requires tweaking a large number of them 
and they are very dense in the UI so you can't even click on them 
individually. I recall in 3.14 the transfer function editor was 
improved, does pv now support a separate opacity and color point in the 
transfer function color map table? if so them was that also added to the 
xml format? If not this may be something to think about in the future.

Burlen

Thanks! That is exactly what I was looking for including the presets that you came up with. Thanks again. My google fu was not strong today.

great! I have just spent some time experimenting with 3.14 and it seems 
that the xml file format has not been updated to support the separation 
of color control points and opacity control points. That would be a huge 
improvement to support this in the xml format. by the way I also noticed 
an issue in the first set of luts and fixed it, new file is on the wiki.

Great work, Burlen, and you are right that the xml file format has not
been updated to support the latest changes in color editor. Would you
mind creating an entry for this in Mantis?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Reading a constant EnSight Geometry Mesh with Variables
 that Change over Time
Message-ID: <OF55CC1761.088A32F5-ON852579F8.006E5B71-852579F8.006F6B1C@faa.gov>

Hello!
     I am currently trying to create an EnSight Gold dataset that defines 
a Structured Grid Geometry Mesh that is constant for all time values, but 
the VARIABLES section contains scalars which change over time.  This is 
extremely desirable, as it reduces the file size significantly by not 
requiring me to repeat a large mesh of points for each timestep - when the 
mesh itself is constant and never changes over time.

     I saw this issue was brought up back in 2006, and it does not appear 
that the thread was ever resolved:
               
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-November/004180.html 
Has anybody had any luck defining a constant mesh with variables changing 
over time within the mesh with EnSight?

I have attached an example snippet of what I have come up with so far. 
This file will pass the "ens_checker" validation program provided with the
EnSight software, but when I attempt to open it in ParaView, ParaView 
locks up and crashes.


Best Wishes!

Subject: [Paraview] Stereo Saving Glitch?
Message-ID: <CBCF089E.41C4%273753@win.lanl.gov>

I am having a problem with the ParaView save stereo animation. The normal window stereo is fine for the program and works great. However, when I go to save animation and output images, they are not in stereo. I have tried saving individual jpeg images for both left and right eyes, but they are the same. The interlaced image comes out as one image. Therefore, it seems there is a glitch in the saving properties or output files.

I have done this on 3.14, 3.12, 3.10 binaries, as well as 3.14 build. It only seems to work on a previous built version of 3.6.2.

Are there any suggestions?

Thanks,

J

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with memory footprint of parallel Paraview
Message-ID: <4FAA3CA0.10202@fz-juelich.de>

Hello,

I have some problems with the memory footprint of Paraview 3.14.0.
I run pvserver in parallel on 4 nodes of a cluster with 2 Paraview
processes on each node. Each node has 16GB main memory.
So in total I have 8 Paraview processes and 64GB main memory
(distributed on 4 nodes).

For testing purpose I loaded a dataset in hdf5/xdmf format with the xdmf
reader. The dataset is a simple uniform rectilinear grid with one float
attribute.
The size of the data is 16GB.

After loading the data everything seems reasonable. Each of the 8
Paraview processes allocates about 2GB main memory.
Then I create a contour. After that, each process allocates 2GB
additional memory (resulting in 4GB for EACH of the 8 processes),
although the memory inspector tells me that the generated contour is
just 145MB.
Then I create a slice (plane). Ones again, every process allocates 2GB
additional memory (resulting in 6GB total for each process) for a simple
plane (of 350MB).

Of course, things are even getting worse when I try to load a 32GB
dataset. Then every process allocates 4GB main memory, then 4GB in
addition, and so on...

Is there any solution for the strange behavior? Maybe I have to set some
special cmake compiler flags?


Thanks in advance,

Herwig

Subject: [Paraview] Export X3D Files via Python >version 3.8
Message-ID: <4FAA86E9.5030508@iag.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hey folks,
I'm looking for a way to export X3D files with a python script for 
Paraview version 3.14.
In v 3.8, what worked was:

from paraview.simple import *
exporters=servermanager.createModule("exporters")
Cone()
Show()
SetActiveView(GetRenderView())
Render()
x3dExporter=exporters.X3DExporter(View=view, 
FileName="/home/iagbeck/demo/foo.x3d")
x3dExporter.Write()

but that won't work in any version > 3.8 (see also bug tracker report 
here: http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=12738). 
<http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=12738>

Is there anyone who knows how to do that? Alternatively, if you have 
some code snippets about exporting / importing files (tecplot bins) 
lying around, please let me know!

Thanks for the help!

Hi,
I too have this issue. I did find that View and Write attributes of  
X3DExporter were removed from the  
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/utilities.xml but removing  
View does work but does not write the file.

The updated python script looks like:

from paraview.simple import *
exporters=servermanager.createModule("exporters")
source=Cone()
view = GetActiveView()
Show(view)
render=Render()
x3dExporter=exporters.X3DExporter(FileName="foo.x3d")
x3dExporter.Write()

If source, view, or render are added to the x3dexporter constructor such as

x3dExporter=exporters.X3DExporter(source,FileName="foo.x3d")

I get recursive errors:
Exception exceptions.RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded'  
in <bound method X3DExporter.__del__ of  
<paraview.servermanager.X3DExporter object at 0x2b8e69567f10>> ignored


Hopefully this bug is fixed soon or someone with knowledge can provide  
the correct way to use it.

Thanks,
Pat

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with displaying labels floating over data points
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQt2Lp-zDa7mmdCUuSx087bPzvP4c7j0-bUR-VW2=5qnqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a set of points over which I would like to have floating labels
rendered from values defined in per-point attribute array. If I select
these points and turn on "Point Labels", on Selection Inspector
docking panel, I get exactly what I need, but, I would like to have
these labels not bound to currently selected points.

I figured out that these labels are drawn using
vtkDataLabelRepresentation class, but I was unable to apply this
representation to points I extracted from plugin. My idea was to
create a filter, which will extract all points I'm interested in, and
to catch adding new representation
object to Server Manager and current view and replace it with
pqDataRepresentation which points to vtkDataLabelRepresentation.
Unfortunately, it didn't work. I also tried with patching
vtkPVCompositeRepresentation to have always turned on these labels,
but it failed too.

Does anyone have idea how I could add these labels?

Thanks to everyone!

Nenad.

Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD214509906B75899@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

Has anyone out there used any filters/mappers that make use of CUDA in paraview, If so are there examples I can look at to get an idea of how to integrate some CUDA rendering into a paraview plugin. It doesn't actually have to be rendering as such as my current version just renders using software into a standard memory buffer and then copies that into OpenGL prior to letting paraview composite everything. It's mostly the setup/compilation etc that I haven't tried with CUDA and would like to experiment.

thanks

Creating a DataLabelRepresentation should have worked. Here's a Python
script that illustrates the same:

from paraview.simple import *
s = Sphere()
r = Show()
v = Render()
l = servermanager.rendering.DataLabelRepresentation()
l.Input = s
l.PointLabelVisibility = 1
l.PointLabelMode = "IDs"
v.Representations.append(l)
Render()

Hi guys,

the solution is as follow:

from paraview.simple import *
exporters=servermanager.createModule("exporters")
source=Cone()
view = GetActiveView()
Show(view)
render=Render()
x3dExporter=exporters.X3DExporter(FileName="foo.x3d")
x3dExporter.SetView(view) # <===== NEW LINE
x3dExporter.Write()

The reason for that is SetView and Write are not Proxy properties but
local methods on the current proxy implementation. Therefore, you must
call them as is.

The array contains the value "6.44569e-302" that is outside the
range "float" can hold so the Mac streams library gives up when
parsing.  Test with this code:

  #include <sstream>
  #include <iostream>
  int main()
  {
    std::istringstream is("6.44569e-302");
    float f; // double works
    if(is >> f)
      {
      std::cout << f << std::endl;
      }
    else
      {
      std::cout << "failed" << std::endl;
      }
    return 0;
  }

Thanks a lot, Sebastian!
That did the trick. The only thing I had change was the line marked 
below, or I got the error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<string>", line 5, in <module>
   File 
"/home/ParaView-3.14.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-3.14/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", 
line 249, in Show
     raise RuntimeError, "Could not create a representation object for 
proxy %s" % proxy.GetXMLLabel()
RuntimeError: Could not create a representation object for proxy RenderView

Otherwise, it worked fine. Thank you very much. BTW, is there a good 
reference for the API somewhere? All the stuff I could find online was 
either outdated or incomplete.

All the best,
Andrea

Hi All,

Is there a way to change shape of points in data representation from
squares to circles? I know I can change the size.

The shape of a GL_POINT is largely open GL driver dependent.

However, since you want circles, try the point sprite plugin, which
draws spheres for points.

Use a glyph filter, then set the glyph type to 2D glyph, and then set 
the glyph type to filled circle.

Hi all,

Here is a problem that were already encountered.
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2011-June/021919.html

I have exactly the same error message, that I can not understand.

Linking CXX shared module ../../bin/vtkIOPython.so

Any idea about the origin of that sudden compilation stop ?

I am compiling on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 64bits.

Thanks,

Hi Andrea,

your question about the python documentation, it is kind of tricky.
For the python API, basically it's the merge of those components:
- src/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py
- src/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py
- src/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/*.xml
+ some custom proxy which was the case for exporter.

If we could figure out a way to generate something that would be
great. But so far, it is not the case.

Although, from the XML we generate the following documentation (See Appendix):
- http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents

Is this your own csv writer? if yes, did you have hints for the writer
in your xml config file

</WriterProxy>
    ......

      <Hints>
        <WriterFactory extensions="csv"
           file_description="my csv writer"/>
      </Hints>

</WriterProxy>

This is something I found out that I have to do for my writer plugin with 3.14.

Luis,

I had similar problem with some writers.
It was very strange and sporadic (it occurred both when I used *.vtu and
*.csv writers).
I kind of got the feeling that most of the times it appeared when I ran PV
in parallel so I could solve it by running PV in serial mode.
But as I said, I am not 100% what is going on.

Good luck,
Mohamad

Hello Utkarsh,

Thank You very much for Your help! It works great when created as
Python macro. I probably messed up something in my C++ code.

Best regards,
Nenad.

There definitely seems to be a bug in the WriterFactory which fails to
return valid readers when running through Python. We are looking into
it.

Subject: [Paraview] OpenDataFile with ParaViewWeb JavaScript Console
Message-ID: <75b73146-4a7c-4e39-826e-b661d18a42a2@zstore2>

Hi everybody,
    I have a question to ask. I use ParaViewWeb JavaScript Console to load an image file to ParaViewWeb, I use the followed code "var reader =paraview.OpenDataFile({filename:"../NameOfFile"});"     I tried with the absolute path of my PC (which is normally not the good solution) and get the "ServerDownException"
    So, if I want ParaViewWeb to look at in the web-apps of tomcat server, which path I have to use? As I know, if the file is in the same location as the PWConsole.war, we can access to it directly using {filename:"hola.mhd"} (for example)
    Anyone have an idea?
   Thank in advance.

You can create your own python plugin that will append the proper path
in front of the provided name.

=== myPlugin.py ===
from paraview import simple

def load(file):
   return simple.OpenDataFile('/your-path/' + file)

=======

In JS you'll do something like that

var plugin = paraview.getPlugin('myPlugin');
var reader = plugin.load('NameOfFile.mhd');

But you should figure out why the server crashed by looking at the log
if you can. The full path should have worked.

Sorry I jut see your answer.

Using the french system language, I had the same error message with ubuntu
12.04.
But We find a solution today : to set the ubuntu language environment in
english, instead of french.

I also had an other error message when compiling using "make -j", at
approx. 5% of the compilation, that didn't occured anymore when compiling
using "make" only. (sorry, I don't remember where...)
That error was linked to the language : unknown /xc3 character, or
something like that, and make us try to compile with ubuntu in english.

Does that make sense to you ?

Thanks,

Aur?lien

Message-ID: <CAHa6DTFyNufCxfhLgySAyKH73PnTm0ip6b=cqVRR1SYyYJTZzg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to change the visibility property of a specific actor in
the renderer. Right now, I need to remember which orderly ID my actor
is in the actor list and iterate through the following to get to the
actor,

vtkPropCollection* props = renderer->GetViewProps();
props->InitTraversal();
for(int i = 0; i < props->GetNumberOfItems(); i++){...}

This is quite complicated, and once one actor in the list is removed,
the ID may change.
Is there a way to set a name to an actor, and just traverse though the
list to search for the actor with the specific name?

Or there is a correct way to do so that I do not know of yet.

Thanks in advance,

Li

Li,

I don't know of a way to add a name or other identifier to a vtkObject.

It might be easier to have an auxiliary data structure that stores
references to the vtkActors and lets you set the visibility by
accessing the vtkActor through that data structure. I tend to find
this easier than working with the VTK structures directly. For
example, you might just use a map from your program-specific data
structure to the vtkActor that represents it.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi all,

I was able to get it to work in 3.14 by doing:

        PlotOverLine1.UpdatePipeline()

before creating the writer. 

Thanks,

Tony

Subject: [Paraview] Stream traces show through surfaces
Message-ID: <BAY171-W193BD6D5920DB31ABDDDDBEB140@phx.gbl>


Hello all,

I am using the StreamTracer filter on a SurfaceVectors filter to get surface streamlines on CFD data.  The problem is that the rendered view shows portions of the traces that should be hidden by the surface representation of the CFD grid.  This makes for a confusing picture.  I can't find a way to resolve this issue through the rendering options in the GUI.  Should I be making my surface traces a different way?  Any help would be appreciated.  

I am using Paraview 3.10.1 64-bit Linux, but the same thing happens in 3.14.1 64-bit Linux.  

Thanks,
Bryan

After import the data into paraview and click the "Stream Tracer" button ,
then apply, but the view port
became blank(nothing but coordinate axis) .

btw. The contour button is grey, Why?

Thanks!

Thank you Seb,
    So, If I understand well, I will charge the file in 2 step, the first one is to charge a file in plugin with "myPlugin.py", then use the plugin to charge the file in ParaViewWeb?
    So, in your reply
 
   "def load(file):
    return simple.OpenDataFile('/your-path/' + file)"

    the parameter ('nameOfFile.mhd') will be parsed directly to OpenDataFile('/my-path/'+file) and become ('/my-path/nameOfFile.mhd')
    I wonder if I'm right. Sorry for this question but I just want to be sured.

You can create your own python plugin that will append the proper path
in front of the provided name.

=== myPlugin.py ===
from paraview import simple

def load(file):
  return simple.OpenDataFile('/your-path/' + file)

=======

In JS you'll do something like that

var plugin = paraview.getPlugin('myPlugin');
var reader = plugin.load('NameOfFile.mhd');

But you should figure out why the server crashed by looking at the log
if you can. The full path should have worked.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems loading saved states
Message-ID: <001d01cd31ae$b943a0e0$2bcae2a0$@ib-bauklimatik.de>

Hello everyone around.

 

as a newbie to this list - and a relative beginner with ParaView - I'm glad
to have found you, and very relieved by the prospect of possibly getting
some help for my present problems with ParaView. Apologies in advance, in
case my beginner-questions should turn out to be quite basic.

 

Most pressing problem is, that my installation (ParaView 3.14.1 64 bit,
running on WIN7) is extremely unreliable, when it comes to loading saved
states. In fact, that works very rarely. Most of the times, I get error
messages similar to this one

 

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkXMLParser.cxx, line 483

vtkPVXMLParser (000000000C1412F0): Error parsing XML in stream at line 2149,
column 35, byte index 109506: not well-formed (invalid token)

Root does not exist. Either state file could not be opened or it does not
contain valid xml

 

There is no indication of any problems while working with ParaView or when
saving a state. I don't think I'm using any exotic filters (ENSIGHT-reader,
calculator, slices etc.). The crash occurs before I'm asked which data file
to read, right after picking a *.pvsm file to load.

 

I will now try to work around the problem by tracing my work, but would very
much prefer a proper start from a saved state. Any hint on possible solution
will be very much appreciated.

 

Regards

Chris

Message-ID: <c80c40fa-c73a-4093-b397-283c61d12fb9@zstore2>

Hi everybody,
    I have a question about the using of JavaScript API in ParaViewWeb.
    I succeeded in loading a file using OpenDataFile via a plugin.

  And now I want to apply a filter to my files.
  When I tried to call, for example ImageThreshold
   
  p = paraview();
  var reader = plugin.load('myFile.mhd');    //I succeeded in loading this file
  reader = p.ImageThreshold(reader);                    // it's here I want to apply a filter, but I have the followed error : Object #<Paraview> has no method 'ImageThreshold'  I also tried with reader = p.vtkImageThreshold but the same error. 
   
  So I want to know how to call a ParaView function in JavaScript Terminal of PWConsole?
  Thank in advance

Try changing the value of the z-shift in the settings window (option under
render view) - make the number smaller.

Is it possible that you have some non-ascii chars in your state file
that could come from your field data ?

For that you will need to know the name of the ParaView Proxy. You can
find-out by using ParaView and the trace function.
Then by referring to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/What_is_the_full_JavaScript_API , you
should be able to convert the Python trace to a JavaScript code.
Moreover, if you use directly the JavaScript console of Firebug or
Chrome, you have the completions on the ParaView object.

I think in your case you should write your code as follow:

p = paraview();
var reader = plugin.load('myFile.mhd');
filter = p.Threshold( {proxy:reader} ); // The arg is optional as the
reader is currently active
representation = p.Show()
p.Render()

No, not that I am aware of. We do have those weird special chars in German
(?, ?, ?, ?), which I've learned long ago better to avoid in technical
software. And I did, as far as I can see.
But, since you mention it, I did at one point have the feeling, that
ParaView doesn't treat the german standard notation for decimal numbers
(decimal comma, separator point) consistently. My system is set to that
format, but (most, possibly not all) numbers in ParaView's menus appear in
anglo-saxon notation (decimal point). Unfortunately, I can't find an example
for exceptions right now.
Could that be something?

Is it possible that you have some non-ascii chars in your state file that
could come from your field data ?

You can try to look at your pvsm file and see if you find something
suspicious. Otherwise, if you can share the state file without the
data, you can send it to us so we can try to track the problem down.

Please find a little sample attached. The message I get when trying to open
it is this here:


	ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkXMLParser.cxx, line 483
	vtkPVXMLParser (000000000C09BE60): Error parsing XML in stream at
line 3771, column 35, byte index 186690: not well-formed (invalid token)
	Root does not exist. Either state file could not be opened or it
does not contain valid xml


Looking at the pvsm file in the appropriate line, I don't understand all of
it, but can't see anything  suspicious either.

Indeed a nice job. I just click on the sample sample vtk and got this 
error. Probably something on my side.

It is a direct link. Because of the xml structure of the file, your 
browser thinks it can parse it. Try to right-click on the file + download.

Hi all,

I have figured out how to create a surface from a file (using contour).  However, the surface ends up looking like a step function, whereby the transitions are not smooth.  I assume this is because the file used to create the surface has a voxel resolution that is coarse enough for these transitions are obvious.  However, I'd like to smooth the surface in some way, to eliminate the obvious step transitions.  I've tried the smooth function, but that has minimal effect on my image.  I've also tried setting "compute normals" on the contour filter.  This does smooth the edges, but it doesn't eliminate the obvious steps along the surface.  Is there any way to smooth the surface even more, perhaps by iterations of eroding and dilating?

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

-Tom

Subject: [Paraview] Basic Time Plot Questions
Message-ID: <CANDesvJ6D=y3h6jyiYUGKd5gggNLHs+TcuhEF8tsCResTFN6=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ParaViewers,

I'm new to ParaView and am having trouble figuring out these two
things. (I'm using version 3.6.2)

First question:

The documentation talks about being able to select multiple files by
holding down command and selecting the files. Or using shift, as one
would most file dialogs. I've had no luck with this using ParaView via
VNC on a Mac (Chicken of the VNC) and also on a Linux box via X. If I
can't figure out how to do this, I'm going to have to put all my data
in one file, which may be a nightmare.

Second question:

I suppose this question may be irrelevant if I can get the first one
answered, since I think the file-naming will take care of the time
steps (?). At any rate, I'm wondering if ParaView can make an
animation of data in a CSV which is set up like this:

timestep, x-coord, y-coord, z-coord, intensity

The z-coord is always zero since I'm doing a 2d problem. I can plot
the points using the Table to Points filter, but I can't figure out
how to get ParaView to recognize the timestep column as the timestep.

Any assistance on either of these questions would be most appreciated. Thanks,

--Danny

Hi,

did you try shape based interpolation? It's not just an option in 
ParaView but you would have to implement it e.g. using ITK as a 
preprocessing step.

Maybe the ? in ?C is causing the trouble?

Subject: [Paraview] JavaScript API - ParaViewWeb - how to call function
In-Reply-To: <CABObKxcucKY9WPD2RC1_OssNroHn9YsFkNiL5YB63fo9NiFqUg@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you very much Seb,
I have another question : I read the simple.py and certainly, I found all the function about rendering, read file, etc. but I didn't find out anything about all the filters.
So if a want to use these filter, in python and after, in javascript. Where can I find the header (to know how to use these functions - some files like simple.py)? Do I have to import the vtk Library or something like that so we can use them in ParaViewWeb? 
About the plugin, I (suppose) write a plugin, with the .xml and .cxx file (as instructed in the Wiki page), write .py file and place it into the folder plugins of working-directory.
So, in the PWConsole, I suppose to load the plugin so it can be use in PWConsole? I wonder if i'm right.
Thank you once more.

For that you will need to know the name of the ParaView Proxy. You can
find-out by using ParaView and the trace function.
Then by referring to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/What_is_the_full_JavaScript_API , you
should be able to convert the Python trace to a JavaScript code.
Moreover, if you use directly the JavaScript console of Firebug or
Chrome, you have the completions on the ParaView object.

I think in your case you should write your code as follow:

p = paraview();
var reader = plugin.load('myFile.mhd');
filter = p.Threshold( {proxy:reader} ); // The arg is optional as the
reader is currently active
representation = p.Show()
p.Render()

Subject: [Paraview] Screenshot resolution
Message-ID: <CAE_bc5bQ1+qqwjJFiEfkoVxcBC=v9uHrMXs-NQk38W0DsSxCzA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

A simple question.
When I try to save the screenshot on current view, I would like to increase
the resolution of the image I can see on the screen.
Obviously, when I use the default resolution suggested by paraview and save
the image, everything looks fine.
Problem rises when I, for instance, use a double pixels in each direction.
The created image is not really the original one with a higher resolution.
It seems that Paraview just extends the borders and add white space to the
extended area.
Is it something I am missing here?

Thanks,
Mohamad

Ooops ? thanks for the hint.  I did a test with a very basic setup, and
reloading the state worked just fine. Hopefully, that was not only
coincidence.

 

Thanks again,

You can try to look at your pvsm file and see if you find something
suspicious. Otherwise, if you can share the state file without the data, you
can send it to us so we can try to track the problem down.

No, not that I am aware of. We do have those weird special chars in

But, since you mention it, I did at one point have the feeling, that 
ParaView doesn't treat the german standard notation for decimal 
numbers (decimal comma, separator point) consistently. My system is 
set to that format, but (most, possibly not all) numbers in ParaView's 
menus appear in anglo-saxon notation (decimal point). Unfortunately, I 
can't find an example for exceptions right now.
Could that be something?

Hello everyone around.
 
 
 
as a newbie to this list ? and a relative beginner with ParaView ? 
I?m glad to have found you, and very relieved by the prospect of 
possibly getting some help for my present problems with ParaView. 
Apologies in advance, in case my beginner-questions should turn out to be

quite basic.

 
 
 
Most pressing problem is, that my installation (ParaView 3.14.1 64 
bit, running on WIN7) is extremely unreliable, when it comes to 
loading saved states. In fact, that works very rarely. Most of the 
times, I get error messages similar to this one

token)
 
Root does not exist. Either state file could not be opened or it does 
not contain valid xml
 
 
 
There is no indication of any problems while working with ParaView or 
when saving a state. I don?t think I?m using any exotic filters 
(ENSIGHT-reader, calculator, slices etc.). The crash occurs before 
I?m asked which data file to read, right after picking a *.pvsm file to

load.

 
 
 
I will now try to work around the problem by tracing my work, but 
would very much prefer a proper start from a saved state. Any hint on 
possible solution will be very much appreciated.

did you try toggling the 'use offscreen rendering for screenshots' option in the mina options dialog. This often fixes dodgy results like the one you describe.

Hi Tuan,

The 'missing' documentation that you are looking for is inside the
appendix of http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents
under "List of ...".
Those API's are defined by some XML files that describe all the
ParaView proxies. ParaView does not use VTK class directly but instead
use Proxy to abstract the location and distribution of the real VTK
class instance.

Regarding the plugin part, I was talking about ParaViewWeb plugin
(Python), not ParaView plugin (XML/C++) but in any case you can use
both if you need to.

Moreover, depending on what you are doing you shouldn't need to use
VTK classes directly and you should stick to the ParaView proxy
paradigm.

Thank you Seb,
I tried to use OpenDataFile() in the simple.py but I think that it's not the right reader to use (it weird because the comment say that OpenDataFile will search for the right reader).
Now I want to use MetaFileSeriesReader('fileName'), a reader of VTK.
So I write a loadFile.py as followed
 

from paraview.simple import *
from paraview import vtk


def MetaImageReader(file):
    return vtk.vtkMetaFileSeriesReader('/home/thtran/'+file);
I tried return vtk.vtkMetaFileSeriesReader ... as well as return vtk.MetaFilSeriesReader 
but always Uncaught 'module' object has no attribute 'MetaFileSeriesReader'

I think that the proxy I provided is wrong. but I don't have any idea about how it'll be.
Do you have any idea?
Thank you in advance

Using directly a VTK class on the python layer does not make it a
proxy... You need to stick to the ParaView proxy that are defined
inside the XML.

OpenDataFile should be the correct method to call. Try to debug your
script inside the Python shell of ParaView to see why it is
complaining for.
And once your python is OK, then use it inside ParaViewWeb...

D,
First off, I would update ParaView.  You are using a very old version.

* I believe this functionality does not exist in 3.6.2.  It does in 3.14.0.  However, you should be able to open one file, then open the next file, etc.
* No clue.  Maybe open can.exo, save data as a csv file, and look at that?

Alan

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Basic Time Plot Questions

Hi ParaViewers,

I'm new to ParaView and am having trouble figuring out these two things. (I'm using version 3.6.2)

First question:

The documentation talks about being able to select multiple files by holding down command and selecting the files. Or using shift, as one would most file dialogs. I've had no luck with this using ParaView via VNC on a Mac (Chicken of the VNC) and also on a Linux box via X. If I can't figure out how to do this, I'm going to have to put all my data in one file, which may be a nightmare.

Second question:

I suppose this question may be irrelevant if I can get the first one answered, since I think the file-naming will take care of the time steps (?). At any rate, I'm wondering if ParaView can make an animation of data in a CSV which is set up like this:

timestep, x-coord, y-coord, z-coord, intensity

The z-coord is always zero since I'm doing a 2d problem. I can plot the points using the Table to Points filter, but I can't figure out how to get ParaView to recognize the timestep column as the timestep.

Any assistance on either of these questions would be most appreciated. Thanks,

--Danny

A simple question.=20

When I try to save the screenshot on current view=2C I would like to increa=

The created image is not really the original one with a higher resolution. =
It seems that Paraview just extends the borders and add white space to the =

Is it something I am missing here?=20

Thanks Luis,

I have played around with magnification factor as well. But that does not
seem to solve the problem.
I have used the same command with magnification=1, 2, and 4.
This is what I get.

I would like to save the original snapshot, just with higher quality.

Thanks,
Mohamad

Thanks John.
Please be patient be with me here. By "mina options dialog", what do you
exactly mean?
Is it the same thing as compiling paraview with Mesa to have offscreen
rendering mode? I alreay use that as well. Still a bit confused about
zooming and high resolution images.

Thanks,

Hi guys,

A simple question.
When I try to save the screenshot on current view, I would like to increase the resolution of the image I can see on the screen.
Obviously, when I use the default resolution suggested by paraview and save the image, everything looks fine.
Problem rises when I, for instance, use a double pixels in each direction.
The created image is not really the original one with a higher resolution. It seems that Paraview just extends the borders and add white space to the extended area.
Is it something I am missing here?

Thanks,

Hi guys,

I have a problem getting pv open my binary file. It basically segfaults and
terminates without any information. When I run in gdb I get:

ERROR: In /build/buildd/paraview-3.8.1/VTK/IO/vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1910

Program terminated with signal SIGBUS, Bus error.

Is there something wrong with my data file? I could send a sample file if
needed. I basically followed http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf to
write the binary format.

Hi Tom

Lucky you are not the only one who encountered with this problem.
If you develop with VTK this
link<http://itk-insight-users.2283740.n2.nabble.com/How-to-smooth-the-segmented-surface-td7387850.html>can
help you, just follow the discussion and try to implement the

Subject: [Paraview] different orientation of input files

Hi everyone,

I have a question about changing/editing the orientation and origin information about an input file.  Basically, the problem is this: I have a 3D volume (originally voxel data) file that contains statistics on its surface that I want to display color-coded.  I can create a nice smoothed version of the surface using a different piece of software (ITK-SNAP), and this is the surface I'd like to use to display my stats (Paraview does not allow you to smooth the surface in the same way that ITK-SNAP does, eliminating the stair-step surface artifacts).  I can indeed read both the stats file and the surface file from ITK-SNAP into Paraview, but unfortunately they now have different origins. That is, they don't overlap (the bounding box for the stats is completely outside the surface model that ITK-SNAP created.

Originally, both files had the same orientation and origin: ITK-SNAP used the same file to create the beautiful surface that the stats were created with.  

So Paraview apparently does not read the header info the same way for the two types of files, even though ITK-SNAP does.  

Is there a way to change the origin and/or orientation of files in Paraview?  I'm assuming there is a simple transform I could figure out by trial and error to get them to overlap again, but I don't know how or where I would do this.

Thanks for any suggestions!

-Tom

Subject: [Paraview] No volume representation for cell-centered data with
	center-to-point filter
Message-ID: <CAGCCrwHh_3TMAz9owDHn6d4dKO7015imDYmUCdkJyODpwMgkhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, everybody,

Recently, we are trying to output our simulation results (  some
scalars ) with cell-centered scheme and xmdf format.

The problem now is that with the center-to-point filter, we can get
the contour(seems not work with cell-centered representation), while
we still can not use the volume representation.

The file header is provided as the following. We use some rectangular
mesh, while due to some requirements, the sizes of the mesh cells can
be different. So we have to output the coordinates (X, Y, Z ) of the
nodes to represent the mesh.

Could anybody tell me how I can do the volume rendering with our data?

Thank you very much.

Best Regards,
Kai

I must be missing something.  It only seems to move the bounding box, but not the location of the contour itself.. Not sure what that would be useful for, but in any case, I need to move the contour and/or data within the workspace, so the two overlap.  Transform is only changing the box, not changing the location of the object within the box.  Again, maybe I'm missing something.

So, I just tried the following:
*Sources/ Wavelet.  Apply.  Display this by Outline.
* Filters/ Alphabetical/ Transform.  Translate X by 10.  Apply.
* Leaving the Transform filter highlighted in the pipeline browser, Filters/ Common/ Contor.  Apply.
* Now, if you turn on visibility of the original Wavelet, you see that the wavelet has moved along with the contour.

Or are you saying you want to move the two different files?  Then, you use two transforms - one per file.

Tom,

Will the Transform filter work for you? (Filters>Alphabetical>Transform)

It works for me with unstructured meshes. I don't know if it will work with a surface mesh produced ITK-SNAP.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Thanks Paul!  Decreasing the z-shift solved the issue.

Try changing the value of the z-shift in the settings window (option under render view) - make the number smaller.

Hello all,

I am using the StreamTracer filter on a SurfaceVectors filter to get surface streamlines on CFD data.  The problem is that the rendered view shows portions of the traces that should be hidden by the surface representation of the CFD grid.  This makes for a confusing picture.  I can't find a way to resolve this issue through the rendering options in the GUI.  Should I be making my surface traces a different way?  Any help would be appreciated.  


I am using Paraview 3.10.1 64-bit Linux, but the same thing happens in 3.14.1 64-bit Linux.  

Thanks,
Bryan

OK, that worked. I've figured out how it works, following what you suggested.

Unfortunately, Paraview didn't just shift the data over, leaving it in the same orientation, it also inexplicably changed the orientation by several degrees (??).  Even if I am able to get the two boxes in basically the same location, the shifted orientation makes it impossible to be confident the data are overlaid in the right places.  This is very frustrating.  Apparently Paraview makes random changes to the orientation??  Why on earth would it do that?

Xdmf's 3DRectMesh maps to VTK's vtkRectilinearGrid.

But, ParaView only has volume rendering representations for
vtkImageData and vtkUnstructuredGrids.

So, convert your data from a rectilinear grid to an unstructured grid,
and then volume render that. You could go the other way but you'd
loose the variability in the cell size.

One way to convert is to apply the threshold filter and keep the
entire data range inside the threshold to keep all of the cells.

It shouldn't do that, certainly not randomly.

All the filter does is apply the transformation matrix you give it
(specified by the properties panel and/or by moving the box widget in
the 3D view) to the point coordinates and the vector and normal data
fields of the input data set to make a new data set.

Can you send a picture to the list to help diagnose what is going on?

Also, take a look at both the Rotate and Scale entries in the
Properties tab of the transform filter, and the Bounds field in the
information tab for both the input and output to the transform filter,
to make sure that you haven't unintentionally added any rotation or
scaling components to the transformation matrix.

What does the information tab say about the extent and bounds of both
the original file and the file produced by ITK-snap?

Having never used it myself, I am suspicious that ITK-snap might not
be respecting the input data sets origin or spacing, which could
matter if they are not 0,0,0 and 1,1,1 respectively.

If that is the case, you can use this Script in a python programmable
filter to arbitrarily move the structured grid input to match the
transformed location of the isocontour.

id = self.GetInput()
od = self.GetOutput()
od.ShallowCopy(id)
od.SetOrigin(10,10,10)
od.SetSpacing(2,2,2)

Hi,

I have had some success with the Reflect filter. Often the SNAP meshes are reflected about the origin of the image. Thus I do Reflect on the mesh (I always find it easier to transform the mesh rather than the image in Paraview), with Plane set to X / Y / Z as appropriate, and Center set to the Center of the image. 

The Center of the image in Paraview might not agree with what's in the image header, at least not for NIFTI files. You can figure out the Center in Paraview by selecting the image and then looking at the Information tab. The Bounds box will tell you the min and max in each coordinate. For the Reflect filter, you want the Center to be halfway between the min and max bound of the image.

This usually solves my problems with meshes and images not lining up. I'm assuming here that you are loading the same image from which the mesh was defined.

Even if I am able to get the two boxes in basically the same location, the shifted orientation makes it impossible to be confident the data are overlaid in the right places.  This is very frustrating.  Apparently Paraview makes random changes to the orientation??  Why on earth would it do that?

Something is wrong with this binary file. Paraview opens up other
binary files just fine, but 3.8 and newer versions of paraview don't
open up this one.

ParaView appears to failing near vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter.cxx:1097
where it is trying to process the cells.

Try these to diagnose the specific problem:
* take a closer look at http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf
* load this in a simple vtk program that loads and then renders the
data under a debugger
* change your writer to convert this binary file to the corresponding
ascii version.

Trying this out on some actual data - it seems the reflection should actually be about the boundary of the image, not the center. Here the x-bounds of my image are 114 to 337 in Paraview (note this does not agree with the NIFTI or ITK coordinates), so I reflected the mesh (blue) about 114 in the x-axis, giving me what I think is a correctly oriented mesh. 

Unfortunately, there appear to be other transformations at play as well. You can't see it in this view but the red mesh is offset in the Z-axis. I think this is because of the disagreement between the NIFTI and Paraview coordinates.

Thus I do Reflect on the mesh (I always find it easier to transform the mesh rather than the image in Paraview), with Plane set to X / Y / Z as appropriate, and Center set to the Center of the image.

You can figure out the Center in Paraview by selecting the image and then looking at the Information tab. The Bounds box will tell you the min and max in each coordinate. For the Reflect filter, you want the Center to be halfway between the min and max bound of the image.

Even if I am able to get the two boxes in basically the same location, the shifted orientation makes it impossible to be confident the data are overlaid in the right places.  This is very frustrating.  Apparently Paraview makes random changes to the orientation??  Why on earth would it do that?

Not sure what that would be useful for, but in any case, I need to move the contour and/or data within the workspace, so the two overlap.  Transform is only changing the box, not changing the location of the object within the box.  Again, maybe I'm missing something.

Basically, the problem is this: I have a 3D volume (originally voxel data) file that contains statistics on its surface that I want to display color-coded.  I can create a nice smoothed version of the surface using a different piece of software (ITK-SNAP), and this is the surface I'd like to use to display my stats (Paraview does not allow you to smooth the surface in the same way that ITK-SNAP does, eliminating the stair-step surface artifacts).  I can indeed read both the stats file and the surface file from ITK-SNAP into Paraview, but unfortunately they now have different origins. That is, they don't overlap (the bounding box for the stats is completely outside the surface model that ITK-SNAP created.

Subject: [Paraview] Reading data directly from RS232 interface on

Message-ID: <20120517163634.GB3055@solfire>

Hi,


I want to read and display data of an ADC in the range of 0-65535, which is to
be read from the RS232 interface on UNIX?Windows (/dev/ttyS<n>, COM-Port on
Windows) in ASCII-Format. The stream is multichanneled with about 250
values per second.

Is this possible and how?

Thank you very much for any help in advance!
Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] set camera center of rotation
Message-ID: <CAHa6DTG+KxLn281a_FjzFnpjTqNO8FuOURG4z5JN-6-tfk-6ZA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to set the center of rotation of my environment w.r.t. the 3D
model I loaded.

pqView * view = pqActiveObjects::instance().activeView();
vtkSMRenderViewProxy *proxy =
vtkSMRenderViewProxy::SafeDownCast(view->getViewProxy());
...
...
proxy->GetRenderer()->AddActor(actor);
proxy->GetRenderer()->ResetCamera();
proxy->GetRenderWindow()->Render();

My problem is that when the model is loaded, it is located at the center of
the rendering window, however, when I use mouse to rotate the model, it
immediately moves w.r.t. a different center of location. In fact, I checked
the center of rotation is always 0,0,0 at "Adjust Camera" window, I thought
ResetCamera() function will adjust the center of rotation?

How do I set it the correct way so that the rotation is around my model?

Thanks a lot,

Li

Thanks David. I have thoroughly looked through that file format document
but with no luck. It the mean time, I have tried the xml format and while
my ascii writer (both in legacy and xml versions) work, I'm hopeless when
it comes to the binary version.

It seems that (for xml binary) pv is confused (well, actually I'm also!).
What exactly should the offset values be? Initially I thought they are
simply the size of the DataArray you are writing, but then I loaded my
ascii version and saved it as a binary file. Comparing the two, it seems pv
adds another variable of sizeof(int). What exactly is this? I cannot find
any hint in the file-format document or anywhere online!

I can send my code again if someone is willing to take a look.

Thanks

YESSSSSSSSS! Alright fixed the problem. This might help other folks having
the same problem:

Since I know what big pain this is, email me if you needed assistance
getting your code working :D

Hello,
           I am new to Paraview and visualization tools. I just want to
know, is there any possibility to integrate Paraview into a  web browser so
that people can visualize the data in real time.

Thank you!
Wathsa.

Yes. See:

No.

Visualizing data as it arrives with paraview is still pretty much a
research topic. Search the mailing list via markmail.org for threads
on this topic. It has been done (several times) but none of those
efforts have graduated it into ParaView proper yet.

Unless, by "real time", you meant "interactively", in which case the
answer is Yes. You can use ParaViewWeb for interactive 3D
visualization in a web browser.

OK, so Paraview screws up NIFTI coordinates, or doesn't read the header right?  The surface mesh that ITK-SNAP makes is in vtk format, so it must be that ITK-SNAP doesn't put the orientation info into the right format?  

Looking closely at my image, I can see that the vtk mesh in Paraview is indeed left-right reversed compared to the original in ITK-SNAP (in addition to being shifted in various ways out of alignment inexplicably).  

Here are the bounds in Paraview for the mesh:

X range: -98.9 to -9.78 (delta: 89.1)

If I put the following for Reflect:
plane: X
center: 50

Then the images are no longer left-right reversed from each other, but they are still not overlapping.  There is some kind of Y and Z shift also going on.

Here the x-bounds of my image are 114 to 337 in Paraview (note this does not agree with the NIFTI or ITK coordinates), so I reflected the mesh (blue) about 114 in the x-axis, giving me what I think is a correctly oriented mesh.

Thus I do Reflect on the mesh (I always find it easier to transform the mesh rather than the image in Paraview), with Plane set to X / Y / Z as appropriate, and Center set to the Center of the image.

You can figure out the Center in Paraview by selecting the image and then looking at the Information tab. The Bounds box will tell you the min and max in each coordinate. For the Reflect filter, you want the Center to be halfway between the min and max bound of the image.

Even if I am able to get the two boxes in basically the same location, the shifted orientation makes it impossible to be confident the data are overlaid in the right places.  This is very frustrating.  Apparently Paraview makes random changes to the orientation??  Why on earth would it do that?

Not sure what that would be useful for, but in any case, I need to move the contour and/or data within the workspace, so the two overlap.  Transform is only changing the box, not changing the location of the object within the box.  Again, maybe I'm missing something.

Basically, the problem is this: I have a 3D volume (originally voxel data) file that contains statistics on its surface that I want to display color-coded.  I can create a nice smoothed version of the surface using a different piece of software (ITK-SNAP), and this is the surface I'd like to use to display my stats (Paraview does not allow you to smooth the surface in the same way that ITK-SNAP does, eliminating the stair-step surface artifacts).  I can indeed read both the stats file and the surface file from ITK-SNAP into Paraview, but unfortunately they now have different origins. That is, they don't overlap (the bounding box for the stats is completely outside the surface model that ITK-SNAP created.

Subject: [Paraview] mesh with refinement
Message-ID: <1337375901.79390.YahooMailNeo@web160104.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview experts,

I have a fluid mesh (and liquid/air interfaces) with refinements - see picture attached.? There is only 1 fluid domain and this domain has not been partitioned.? But, paraview displays "shading" at the boundaries of the refinement region.? I am wondering how to remove these shading.

I have tried "clean cells to grid" and "clean to grid". But, both did not help.

Thank you!

Pei-Ying

Subject: [Paraview] saving color map
Message-ID: <CACeyOhbL8cTn-VKv8CHDoDF=ztw1VCLaB3B7bRs4A1CnvytH2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ParaView users,

forgive me if my question was asked a lot ... I'm new to Paraview.
I have a vtp file which is a colored surface.
when I open it in Paraview the scalars array appears.
I edited the color map with the color scale and the viewing is great!

now I want to save it in order to open it in another software (that knows
to view colors from scalars as well)
so how can I do this? the saving with colors process ...
I tried by 'Save Data' option but the scalars as were edited weren't saved
...

I have figured out how to get my surface meshes (from ITK-SNAP) to line up perfectly with my stat data (calculated originally on the same image). Here is how I did it:

1) reflected the ITK-SNAP surface mesh about the X axis:
With the surface mesh highlighted in the pipeline browser, select
Filters>Alphabetical>Reflect
set:
Plane: X
Center: 0
Press "apply"

2) load the stat data file (press "apply")
Go to the Information tab for this file and note the X, Y, and Z range bounds for this file.  The bounds for my image say, for example:
X range: 109 to 218 (delta: 109)
Y range: -107 to -0.5 (delta: 106)
Z range: 136 to 272 (delta: 136)

3) return to the ITK-SNAP surface mesh, reflected version (click on the "Reflect" object in the pipeline browser listed just below your ITK-SNAP surface mesh file, so that it is highlighted).  Then select:
Filters>Alphabetical>Transform
In the "Translate" boxes of the Transform properties tab, enter the first number for each of your X, Y, and Z ranges, that you noted in step 2 above, in each of the boxes (unfortunately not labeled "X", "Y" and "Z").
E.g., for my data, the boxes for the "Translate" row would read:
Translate:    109    -107    136
Leave the "Rotate" and "Scale" at their default values.
Press "apply"

This moves the mesh to perfectly overlap my stat data.

However, now I can't figure out how to have the stat data attach to my beautiful ITK-SNAP surface mesh.  I tried 
Filters>Alphabetical>Append Attributes
with both the translated (and previously reflected) mesh highlighted along with the stat data file, but this doesn't seem to work.  The AppendAttributes object now claims to have my stat data attached (Properties shows them as scalars), but there is no option to display them.  The "color by" option under the display tab for this object only has "solid color" as an option.  Any ideas how I might be able to get these scalars to display on my beautiful mesh?

Here the x-bounds of my image are 114 to 337 in Paraview (note this does not agree with the NIFTI or ITK coordinates), so I reflected the mesh (blue) about 114 in the x-axis, giving me what I think is a correctly oriented mesh.

You can figure out the Center in Paraview by selecting the image and then looking at the Information tab. The Bounds box will tell you the min and max in each coordinate. For the Reflect filter, you want the Center to be halfway between the min and max bound of the image.

Even if I am able to get the two boxes in basically the same location, the shifted orientation makes it impossible to be confident the data are overlaid in the right places.  This is very frustrating.  Apparently Paraview makes random changes to the orientation??  Why on earth would it do that?

Not sure what that would be useful for, but in any case, I need to move the contour and/or data within the workspace, so the two overlap.  Transform is only changing the box, not changing the location of the object within the box.  Again, maybe I'm missing something.

Subject: [Paraview] Understanding XDMF
Message-ID: <4FB6E093.3060602@mst.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to understand the XDMF file format to import my own files 
into ParaView. Let's say I have the following 16 XYZ points:

    12.3500   95.1900        20.00
    27.2600   60.2600        33.00
    38.6000   69.5200        33.00
    60.2000        -152.3300    93.00
    -15.9600    26.0800        33.00
    -17.8400    168.0900    61.00
    13.8000        -90.7300    59.00
    6.8400        -73.0700    163.00
    -15.6200    26.3200        33.00
    -31.2100    58.7200        10.00
    38.8100        -27.7800    10.00
    51.1500        -129.8700    10.00
    3.4900        126.7200    54.00
    24.0500        121.7200    65.00
    -13.4700    166.7500    60.00
    3.1100        -79.3700    33.00

with intensity values:

    5.10
    5.30
    4.20
    4.20
    4.10
    4.80
    4.60
    4.70
    4.20
    5.00
    7.20
    4.40
    5.00
    4.00
    5.10
    4.20

How do I get these to points to be displayed as a 3d scatter plot in 
ParaView with the intensity values changing the color of each point? I 
made some attempt at an xdmf file but it currently only shows a single 
white dot. The "Information" tab in paraview recognizes all 16 points 
and seems to know where they should be (creates good axises), but only 
the first one is being displayed. Attached is my attempt. I'm guessing 
it's something to do with the "dimensions" attribute and whether or not 
there should be spaces, tabs, or new lines between each value for the 
topology. These aspects very much confuse me.

Thanks,
David Zemon

Hi Hila,


How about using "Save State" into .pvsm?
If you read .pvsm file from "Load State", all states will be restored.

Hi, Felipe,

Thanks a lot for the reply!

This mesh was done using cut cell method in Ansys Workbensh.  It uses hanging nodes at different refinement level.  Could it be possible that paraview does not support hanging nodes?

So, how would one "layer" a stat (voxel data) file over a mesh file, to color code the surface of the mesh?

The AppendAttributes object now claims to have my stat data attached (Properties shows them as scalars), but there is no option to display them.  The "color by" option under the display tab for this object only has "solid color" as an option.  Any ideas how I might be able to get these scalars to display on my beautiful mesh?

Thus I do Reflect on the mesh (I always find it easier to transform the mesh rather than the image in Paraview), with Plane set to X / Y / Z as appropriate, and Center set to the Center of the image.

You can figure out the Center in Paraview by selecting the image and then looking at the Information tab. The Bounds box will tell you the min and max in each coordinate. For the Reflect filter, you want the Center to be halfway between the min and max bound of the image.

Even if I am able to get the two boxes in basically the same location, the shifted orientation makes it impossible to be confident the data are overlaid in the right places.  This is very frustrating.  Apparently Paraview makes random changes to the orientation??  Why on earth would it do that?

Not sure what that would be useful for, but in any case, I need to move the contour and/or data within the workspace, so the two overlap.  Transform is only changing the box, not changing the location of the object within the box.  Again, maybe I'm missing something.

Basically, the problem is this: I have a 3D volume (originally voxel data) file that contains statistics on its surface that I want to display color-coded.  I can create a nice smoothed version of the surface using a different piece of software (ITK-SNAP), and this is the surface I'd like to use to display my stats (Paraview does not allow you to smooth the surface in the same way that ITK-SNAP does, eliminating the stair-step surface artifacts).  I can indeed read both the stats file and the surface file from ITK-SNAP into Paraview, but unfortunately they now have different origins. That is, they don't overlap (the bounding box for the stats is completely outside the surface model that ITK-SNAP created.

Apply the "Glyph" filter to your dataset once you've opened it in
ParaView. You can change the "Glyph Type" to Sphere to get something
like the image attached with Cube Axes turned on.

Subject: [Paraview] advice on saving outputs
Message-ID: <CAKsPKw=Tjkp+dnVi9gOyd78R7x0=Hxk=H45swEh8szsk6HoTNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I need a little bit of advice on how I'm outputting data. So far I have
been using a simple legacy VTK format and dumping my grid and all
sclaar/vectors into that single file. Basically I start with writing the
grid and then append as many as variables that I like to the file. This has
the problem that it was ascii and slow for large data sets, especially fro
a parallel code where the solver was taking only 5 sec but the IO was
around 20!!

So I want to turn into binary and I have learned how to output binary vtu
files. The issue is, since the cluster I'm working with has kill times (Max
24 hr) I also need to be able to save and resume my simulation. So, what I
do right now is dump my variables in binary form into a single file that
does not have any xml tag or anything -- just raw binary data. This is a
preferred method since when I want to resume, I do not need to parse the
xml code; I just read the bindary file and that's it. Besides, I save on
the grid information I'm writing to disk. For a 23M grid point, the grid
information (which basically is a quadtree saved as a
general unstructured grid with cell connectivity information etc) file is
about 1GB whereas my actual data is only about 150MB. In most cases my grid
does not change with time, so I really only need to save it once and that's
enough.

Now, the problem is, I want to be able to use or refer to these binary
files using the xml tags. Here are the questions:

1) Is this supported in .vtu format? How can I refer to a binary file
instead of dumping all the binary information in the file?
2) If this is not supported in .vtu, is it something xdmf can do? If so
how? Can you please point me to a tutorial?
3) Is there any plan or strategy that would be better than what I have in
mind right now? Please remember that retaining the raw binary format of the
files is a must for me (well I do not see convincing reasons to give up on
it, but if there is one, please let me know)

Thanks
Mohammad

Message-ID: <CAE_bc5Z+oWR-RB_RRVpmWcdDEP+PVdF_XV3SSv9rtG_2CCA0Bg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

A simple question.
Is there anyway for the objects in the pipeline to inherit display
properties from their parents (sources)?
To be more clear, I will say this example.
I have my velocity field, then I apply a Calculator filter to the dataset.
Then, I would add a StreamTrace. Then, I would add a Glyph filter and so on
and so forth.

Now, if I the original dataset (Velocity field which is the parent in the
pipeline) is rotated, PV does not pass on the rotations (display
information) to the subsequent filters and I have to manually enter the
orientation information for each created filter again.

Is there anyway around this?
Thanks,
Mohamad

Mohamad,

You can use the transform filter to change (rotate) your data  
permanently (instead of using display properties), before all the  
other filters.

Just this week, I wrote a Python program that uses the numpy.fromfile 
function and ParaView's paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter.numpyTovtkDataArray 
and paraview.vtk.io.vtkXMLPolyDataWriter functions to convert a large 
binary file to .vtp format.  It is reasonably fast.  Maybe you can use 
something like that as a post-processing step.

This separates the tasks of producing data and converting it to VTK format.

Hi,

If you know the structure of the binary file, you can use xdmf format  
file to read your binary data.


for the binary part use something like this:
<DataItem ItemType="Uniform"
  Format="Binary"
  Dimensions="64 128 256"
  Seek="1234">
   PressureFile.bin
</DataItem>

if you grid does not change over time you can use XPath:
"XPath, allows for elements in the XML document and the API to  
reference specific elements in a document"
http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format



I use xdmf all the time, I think is very flexible (ascii, binary, HDF5  
heavy data storage), time, grids, extra data using "Information" tag.   
And all kinds of topologies and geometries.

This was actually my first thought but the reason I didn't go with it is
that it is dependent on the vtk API. I prefer to keep my code's dependency
minimal. Also it rewrites basically the same information redundantly in a
vtk file. Still I think that's the way to if one wants to stick with vtu
for instance if you want to benefit from .pvtu format.


> If you know the structure of the binary file, you can use xdmf format

Actually I went ahead and learned it and now can write xdmf files to point
to my binary files. I like and seems to be quite flexible; for example I
can switch to HDF5 in the future if I want to and can keep my
xmdf writer objects (with minor modifications).

I actually did not understand when I was reading the tutorial. Can I use
this feature to include other xdmf files as well? I am thinking on how to
replicate .pvtu functionality with xdmf. Or maybe its possible to point to
xdmf files in .pvtu directly? Could you please comment on this?

Thanks,
Mohammad

Subject: [Paraview] Best file format for volume rendering in ParaView?
Message-ID: <CAHwVLShOfAEdNY61WpVYycFd6Fqoeg=gfvPGtz5UtZNigyXh2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

What are your thoughts on the best file format to use when doing volume
rendering in ParaView?

I have been trying out the ensight format and the vtk format and find them
less then ideal, is there anything better?

Findings for ensight:
ParaView does not appear to support volume rendering of ensight files due
to it not supporting volume rendering of multi-block datasets and the
ensight reader always imports things in multi block mode. There are ways to
get around this (tetrahedralize together with calculator filter) but the
end results appear to be extremely slow when volume rendering.

Findings for vtk:
Importing a volume of data as image data and volume rendering it works well
but image data in the vtk format must always be aligned to the global
orthogonal (x, y, z) axes so it cannot be rotated. Since we have multiple
data files that all must be positioned and rotated in a scene (MRI volumes
and image planes) this makes things uncomfortable. There is a transform
filter in ParaView but after applying it to image data it changes the data
type to curvalinear grid which ParaView cannot volume render.


What are the alternatives?

Christoffer,

Ensight format - You can volume render multi-block datasets by first using the Merge Blocks filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Best file format for volume rendering in ParaView?

Hello

What are your thoughts on the best file format to use when doing volume rendering in ParaView?

I have been trying out the ensight format and the vtk format and find them less then ideal, is there anything better?

Findings for ensight:
ParaView does not appear to support volume rendering of ensight files due to it not supporting volume rendering of multi-block datasets and the ensight reader always imports things in multi block mode. There are ways to get around this (tetrahedralize together with calculator filter) but the end results appear to be extremely slow when volume rendering.

Findings for vtk:
Importing a volume of data as image data and volume rendering it works well but image data in the vtk format must always be aligned to the global orthogonal (x, y, z) axes so it cannot be rotated. Since we have multiple data files that all must be positioned and rotated in a scene (MRI volumes and image planes) this makes things uncomfortable. There is a transform filter in ParaView but after applying it to image data it changes the data type to curvalinear grid which ParaView cannot volume render.

Message-ID: <CAPyAeYohiLu4CDFDP5RPQJZpOsNNEVOfZmyMnCBWjKYZPagMDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to build my custom plugin to work with the official ParaView
binaries; is there any good way to do this (I am running Windows 7 with
MSVC 2008)? I have referenced this page (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Plugin_Deployment_with_Development_Installs),
but it is outdated. Furthermore, I have found this document about the build
information for ParaView 3.14.1 (http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries).
I have tried to build ParaView accordingly to the specs (in Release and
RelWithDebInfo modes), but the plugins I build from these are not
compatible with the binaries on the website.

I get a message as follows when trying to load my plugin (on official
binaries): "The specified procedure could not be found."

Any help is appreciated.

Regards,
Dennis McWherter

Try opening one that actually has a mesh, like office.binary.vtk. That one
is a bad example for ParaView in that it doesn't have any mesh associated
with it, just bunch of arrays. We could make ParaView support that file
pretty easily but it has never been a priority. Overall, support for the
legacy VTK format is there and we don't plan on dropping it ever.

What is your end goal? Volume rendering a collection of MRI volumes
(together? non-overlapping?) that may not be axis aligned? One way of doing
this in ParaView would be to convert them to unstructured grid (by using
clean-to-grid for example) but this comes at a large memory overhead and
performance overhead. The simpler and more efficient way of doing it is to
load each MRI volume as a separate image data and then use the
Transformation setting from the Display panel to position and orient them
as necessary. It would pretty straightforward to write a macro to do all of
this automatically given a particular file.

Greetings Dennis,

Although the instructions have been tagged as obsolete, they are still 
working if you use the unofficial super-builds. In the first link you 
gave, it reads:

    Download and install the appropriate Development Installation from
    here. (Note: unofficial releases also available here)

The second "here" link on the original text points to here: 
http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/
You'll also find instructions on how to "do it yourself", which 
basically detail the steps taken to achieved the uploaded packages.

If you have problems with the packages on those unofficial builds, feel 
free to either ask here for help or preferably use the Issue tracker on 
that project!

Best regards,
Bruno Santos

Ok, I understand but does it mean that PV is supposed not to be used for visualizing data that are not spacially defined?
I have time series of global simulation quantities, such as energy, mean pressure and so, and I would like to draw a set of y=f(t) curves using the Plot filter, how could I built an appropriate datafile?

VTK and ParaView were designed initially for visualizing spatially
defined data, and it is still what they are best at.

The modern mechanism in VTK for working with general data is to use
the vtkTable and vtkGraph data structures. These have their
corresponding readers/writers and file formats. The financial data
example predates them and isn't as well supported in ParaView.

The simplest way to get non spatially oriented data into ParaView is
to simply open up a CSV (comma separated values) text file.

I think the JOIN function is supposed to allow that:
From:http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format
See:
    <DataItem ItemType="Function"
        Function="JOIN($0 , $1, $2)">
        <DataItem Reference="/Xdmf/DataItem[1]" />
        <DataItem Reference="/Xdmf/DataItem[2]" />
        <DataItem Reference="/Xdmf/DataItem[3]" />
    </DataItem>

But I had trouble using that when I tried long ago and resorted to
using the calculator filter to do the corresponding thing after the
read. (field1*iHat+field2*jHat+field3*kHat).

Is there a way here to get the python include directory that was used by
VTK? i.e. in the wrap_python function I need the following lines:
    include_directories(${library_name}PythonD ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR})
    include_directories(${library_name}Python ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR})

But, I'm not sure how to get the PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR from VTK (other that
set it again when configuring).

Thanks,
Paul

Ok, found the solution - VTK_PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR

Sorry for the noise!

Hi Valdo,

ParaView can definitely be used to visualize tabular data. However, very
few people use the VTK file format for that - in fact that example is the
only one I have seen and it was created for the VTK book a long time ago.
If folks feel like they want to use the VTK format rather than CSV and
such, we can fix this issue.

Hello

Thank you for the suggestions.

The use case is that I am currently writing an application (based on
ParaView) that is going to be used by doctors/researchers for visualizing
MRI data of blood flow (some more information can be found here:
http://www.jcmr-online.com/content/14/S1/W14 ). This means that the user
has some data files (volumes of velocity data, 2d image planes, none of the
data is axis aligned, all of it overlapping) and they need to get this data
in to the application and I am currently trying to figure out what the
recommended way of doing this would be. I can not rely on the users having
any deep knowledge of ParaView, 3d math or even above basic general
computer skills so asking them to write macros or manually rotating the
data might not work well :)

The data->cleantogrid->volume render workflow sounds interesting. My
current problem with it (as well as using mergeblocks instead of
cleantogird) is that it appears to take about 8 hours to produce a result
that way (I do not know what that result is yet since I have not seen it
through to the end). This is off course unacceptably slow but perhaps this
is a bug?

But if I understand you correctly you are saying that unstructured grid is
the data format that would be best for this. Is there any file format that
when imported is an unstructured grid by default and would doing it that
way speed things up massively?

Hello

Thank you for the suggestion.

If I do this:

Import ensight (that is multi-block) data->apply MergeBlocks filter-> Apply
calculator filter (to get magnitude of the velocity data, volume rendering
complains of lack of points otherwise). And then select volume as
representation then I get a progressbar that says
"OpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper: 1" that extremely slow, appears to get
incremented by 1% every 5 minutes or so.


Is this by design or a bug? I have tried it on 2 different computers.

The data set used is a 80x80x46 point volume cube.

Subject: [Paraview] programmable access to vector components (via Python)
Message-ID: <4FBCC9ED.8060407@am.uni-erlangen.de>

I have vector data with 6 elements.

The vector is called 'mechTensor' and I can visualize all components 
and the
magnitude where the components are called XX, YY, ZZ, XY, YZ, XZ. Btw, 
this
is the Voigt notation for stresses and strains.

I do not know, where the component names are assigned, they are not 
defined in
the hdf5 file. Maybe this is done in our proprietary reader but I 
could not
find it there up to now.

I cannot access the components in the calculator. Having the "equation"
"mechTensor_XX" where the string is selected from the Scalars menue, I 
get the error:

"vtkFunctionParser (0x17f8b50): Syntax error: operator expected;  see 
position 12"

I guess that the parser has a problem with the double character after 
the underline ?!

Then I tried the Python Calculator. Here I do not know how to access 
the components.

inputs[0].CellData['mechTensor'][0]

Results in

"Cell array result with 6 components, has only 1 tuples but there are 
2 cells"

I have indeed only two elements, i.e. two times the 6 components vector.

I have a bunch of questions: :)

* am I right with the assumption, that the calculator does not like 
double characters
   after the underline?
* Is this XX, YY, ... coming from Paraview?
* How do I access the vector components via python?
* Where can I find more information about the python interface?

Thanks a lot for your help!

Fabian

P.S.: Same behavior with ParaView 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14

I have re-done things with a smaller set... and paraview worked fine. I 
re-tried with the initial set, cleanup the xmdf  and... it works fine. 
Some there was probably some error in my end or something happened during 
the night.

Thanks for everything

Thanks!

JOIN and the other xdmf Function ItemTypes looked really useful to me.
I'm glad to see they can work in ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] tecplot missing variable
Message-ID: <1337785612.5232.77.camel@pbslinux.pbsdomain.net>

Hi,
We are working with some tecplot data and finding that the last variable
does not show in paraview (Windows, linux, 32 and 64 bit). The files are
about 100MB each but the head is as follows:

TITLE = "title"
VARIABLES  = X, Y, Z, "pressure", "x-velocity", "y-velocity",
"z-velocity", "x-vorticity", "y-vorticity", "z-vorticity", "temperature"
ZONE T="Rampant", N=332518, E=1866141, ET=TETRAHEDRON, F=FEBLOCK


With this file, temperature is not visible, or available.

In the following file

TITLE = "title"
VARIABLES  = X, Y, Z, "pressure", "x-velocity", "y-velocity",
"z-velocity", "temperature", "h2o"
ZONE T="Rampant", N=332518, E=1866141, ET=TETRAHEDRON, F=FEBLOCK

the "h2o" variable is not available.

Seems to be an issue with the tecplot reader plugin token manipulation
functions skipping the last variable. Any help would be appreciated.


Thanks,
Pat

Subject: [Paraview] glyph filter - added keeprandompoints
Message-ID: <1337796148.5232.200.camel@pbslinux.pbsdomain.net>

Hi,
We added some functionality we were hoping you could add to the Paraview
source for next release. It adds a "Keep Random Points" checkbox to the
glyph filter such that if both "Mask Points" and "Random Mode" are
checked, it will maintain the same random points across all timesteps
rather than the default method of choosing a new set of random points
for each timestep. It is only useful if the same points are referenced
in the same order for each timestep. It should work cross platform.

You can see a comparison of current random and mask points

https://snoid.sv.vt.edu/~shpatric/100mb-random.avi

and random and mask points with keep random points

https://snoid.sv.vt.edu/~shpatric/100mb-random-kept.avi

A patch is attached.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Pat

Hi Sam,

thanks for your reply.

The ensight file canot be read:

vtkPGenericEnSightReader (0x1e74fc0): Assuming binary file

But as far as I understand, the XX, ... comes from Paraview ?!

Can you apply Stress_XX in the calculator?

I converted my file to VTK and it appears that Paraview adds the XX, ...
BTW, this Voigt interpretation is in my case the wrong interpretation.
My 6-element vector is neither stress nor strain but the upper part of a
3x3 Voigt elasticity tensor.

Also with the VTK file I cannot use the components in the calculator.
This seems to be a Bug ?!

  Hi

  now I trying the ABS operation in xmdf. paraview loads the files but the 
values presented are not the ABS, as expected.

  what operations are implemented in the xmdf filter in paraview?

Just wondering if anyone had any hints they could give me about things to try.

The AppendAttributes object now claims to have my stat data attached (Properties shows them as scalars), but there is no option to display them.  The "color by" option under the display tab for this object only has "solid color" as an option.  Any ideas how I might be able to get these scalars to display on my beautiful mesh?

Here the x-bounds of my image are 114 to 337 in Paraview (note this does not agree with the NIFTI or ITK coordinates), so I reflected the mesh (blue) about 114 in the x-axis, giving me what I think is a correctly oriented mesh.

Thus I do Reflect on the mesh (I always find it easier to transform the mesh rather than the image in Paraview), with Plane set to X / Y / Z as appropriate, and Center set to the Center of the image.

You can figure out the Center in Paraview by selecting the image and then looking at the Information tab. The Bounds box will tell you the min and max in each coordinate. For the Reflect filter, you want the Center to be halfway between the min and max bound of the image.

Even if I am able to get the two boxes in basically the same location, the shifted orientation makes it impossible to be confident the data are overlaid in the right places.  This is very frustrating.  Apparently Paraview makes random changes to the orientation??  Why on earth would it do that?

Not sure what that would be useful for, but in any case, I need to move the contour and/or data within the workspace, so the two overlap.  Transform is only changing the box, not changing the location of the object within the box.  Again, maybe I'm missing something.

Basically, the problem is this: I have a 3D volume (originally voxel data) file that contains statistics on its surface that I want to display color-coded.  I can create a nice smoothed version of the surface using a different piece of software (ITK-SNAP), and this is the surface I'd like to use to display my stats (Paraview does not allow you to smooth the surface in the same way that ITK-SNAP does, eliminating the stair-step surface artifacts).  I can indeed read both the stats file and the surface file from ITK-SNAP into Paraview, but unfortunately they now have different origins. That is, they don't overlap (the bounding box for the stats is completely outside the surface model that ITK-SNAP created.

Hey John,

I've been working with LANL to get their PISTON library integrated
into VTK and ParaView. It will be making its way into master over the
next few weeks. Our work involves both GPGPU (data manipulation only)
filters and a new direct from thrust to GL (glInterop) mapper.

Getting vtk/paraview to use cuda wasn't too hard, just use CMake's
FindCUDA module to get a hold of nvcc and then run that on the .cu
files to get object files/symbols you can use from your VTK classes.

It doesn't actually have to be rendering as such as my current version just renders using software into a standard memory buffer and then copies that into OpenGL prior to letting paraview composite everything. It's mostly the setup/compilation etc that I haven't tried with CUDA and would like to experiment.

Not sure if this is what you are trying but you can always sample
values from a field onto a mesh by using the ResampleWithDataset
filter.

See the attached state file for a demo.

Subject: [Paraview] slice rep ignores dataset origin in cs mode
Message-ID: <4FBEA344.9000807@gmail.com>

in pv 3.14 the slice rep is ignoring a dataset's origin and rendering it 
at 0,0. This is a change from the previous releases where slice rep 
rendered the dataset at it's origin.  The attached two datasets could be 
used to reproduce. They have different origin's and extents but should 
be coincident in the scene. The other rep's still use the dataset origin 
so you could switch d2 between slice and outline to illustrate. it only 
happens in cs mode.

These datasets show another bug. When I first open the dataset the gui 
is messed up (many things are grayed out) and nothing is displayed. You 
need to change the camera to +y to see the data but you can't. To work 
around I had to delete the view and make a new one. things work fine 
after that.

Not sure if these are known issues.

Disclaimer: I am not a medical guy and I don't deal with volumes very often.

I suspect that your best bet is to use ITK (or VTK) filters to somehow
create one or more axis-aligned, non-overlapping volumes out of the
original data. This could be done as a pre-processing step or within the
reader. I don't know which filters would be best for this. I suspect that
you will need at least vtkImageReslice. You might need to go to the ITK or
VTK list for more detail. Once you have non-overlapping, axis-aligned
volumes, you can volume render them the usual way. It would be pretty easy
to write a volume representation that can handle a multi-block dataset of
non-overlapping images.

Best,

Thanks David. I'll give it a try. it's a project that's being squeezed in between other stuff so takes low(ish) priority. 

Incidentally, I noticed Burlen had some CUDA related stuff in SQtoolkit that I found when googling. I will check that for hints.
(I would like to add support for the CUDA version of the splotch mapper I've been helping out with, pic attached cos it looks nice)

Hey John,

I've been working with LANL to get their PISTON library integrated into VTK and ParaView. It will be making its way into master over the next few weeks. Our work involves both GPGPU (data manipulation only) filters and a new direct from thrust to GL (glInterop) mapper.

Getting vtk/paraview to use cuda wasn't too hard, just use CMake's FindCUDA module to get a hold of nvcc and then run that on the .cu files to get object files/symbols you can use from your VTK classes.

It doesn't actually have to be rendering as such as my current version just renders using software into a standard memory buffer and then copies that into OpenGL prior to letting paraview composite everything. It's mostly the setup/compilation etc that I haven't tried with CUDA and would like to experiment.

Got that to work, thanks!

However, my ultimate goal is to display stats smoothly on a smooth mesh.  The problem here is that the data are calculated on voxel data, which are inherently unsmooth (unless the size of the voxels is tiny enough).  When I put the data on the smooth mesh with ResampleWithDataset, the unsmooth data gets placed on the smooth mesh, such that the image isn't accomplishing what I'd hoped.  Here is the result of data + smooth mesh:



You can see how the data coloring highlights the step-function as a result of the data being voxel based. 

Here is the smooth mesh by itself:


This smooth mesh was created by ITK-SNAP, which based it on voxel data.  So there is a way to smooth voxel data, but it may not be in Paraview?  Or is there some way to accomplish my goal in Paraview?  

Thanks for any suggestions, if anyone has any!  And thanks for getting me this far.

We are happy with HDF5 but this requires a own reader plugin for
our format which we wrote some years ago. With HDF5 we have also access
via Matlab, with is a plus for us.

My "mechTensor" is just a vector with 6 components, so the limitation is
with the size of the vector.

This answers two of my questions:

> * am I right with the assumption, that the calculator does not like double characters after the underline?

Anyone who can help me with the following two?

Thanks a lot,

Apply the CellDataToPointData filter to your stats volume first, that will
give the resample filter something to interpolate with inside of each cell.

CellDataToPointData filter option is grayed out - it won't let me apply this to my stat data.  The online help says: "Cell Data to Point Data filter operates on any type of data set", so I don't know why it wouldn't. I'm clearly missing something here.

The problem here is that the data are calculated on voxel data, which are inherently unsmooth (unless the size of the voxels is tiny enough).  When I put the data on the smooth mesh with ResampleWithDataset, the unsmooth data gets placed on the smooth mesh, such that the image isn't accomplishing what I'd hoped.  Here is the result of data + smooth mesh:

If you mean what is listed under "Data Arrays", in the "name column", I can't tell if it is a cube or a dot.  It looks like it could be a very small cube, but it is so small I would call it a dot.  I'd need something to compare it to.

Regardless, does this mean that if I had the stat data in a volume (e.g., nifti format), it should work?  Does Paraview read such data?  I'll try it..

When I put the data on the smooth mesh with ResampleWithDataset, the unsmooth data gets placed on the smooth mesh, such that the image isn't accomplishing what I'd hoped.

OK, I read the nifti (.nii) stat data file into Paraview (had to tell it that the file was "Analyze" format - there is no "NIFTI" format option).  However, the CellDataToPointData filter option is still grayed out.

Exactly what kind of data does it operate on?  I'm not clear on all the different formats - forgive me.

The problem here is that the data are calculated on voxel data, which are inherently unsmooth (unless the size of the voxels is tiny enough).  When I put the data on the smooth mesh with ResampleWithDataset, the unsmooth data gets placed on the smooth mesh, such that the image isn't accomplishing what I'd hoped.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Interaction Style Without Mouse
Message-ID: <CAGKeP0SbwE8FtFARebJE8hWcQ_p7tm3HBX6jjrPUb649qtyJcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My team and I are working on creating a new method to interact with
ParaView. Our library currently has a skeleton framework with events of its
own to be called for zoom or pan or rotate (more will be added when we get
one of them working). We are having immense difficulty interacting with
ParaView, however. We found the vtkPVInteractorStyle class and have been
attempting to access it (our library was set as a friend) but most recently
ran into a problem when calling "OnButtonUp". The exact error was related
to X - "X Error: BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)".
We've found that ParaView hangs for about 5 to 10 seconds on this line
"this->InvokeEvent(vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent);" of this method "void
vtkPVInteractorStyle::OnButtonUp(int button)" in vtkPVInteractorStyle.cxx.

There must be some way to control the renderer using something other than a
mouse and keyboard. Are we going about this the correct way? Is there an
entirely different method we should be using? Any and all help is
appreciated.

Thanks,
David Zemon

Which version of ParaView is this? This bug sounds very familiar to me and
I vaguely remember sitting down with Utkarsh to fix it. If it is an older
version, can you try 3.14?

As for the Python notation, take a look at:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Programmable_Filter
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Calculator

You need to use something like: inputs[0].CellData['**mechTensor'][:, n]
where n is whichever component that you are accessing. This notation is
based on Numpy. You can learn more about it here:

Guide to NumPy -
Trelgol<http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=numpy%20book&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CGAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tramy.us%2Fnumpybook.pdf&ei=iee_T6LGNeK02gWuqqSwDQ&usg=AFQjCNEqRdLrjjyLB8CFsWb1wecnEuDfNg>

Note that NumPy is much more powerful and efficient that the Array
Calculator so I'd recommend using the Python Calculator or the Python
Programmable Filter whenever possible.

Message-ID: <CACeyOhY1wFEOOiEQBqnNWhoQgUwKosieHdOrpV0peRp1PUAjMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a blood vessels segmentation (as attached).
But I don't happy with it because it's not look like a tube, more like
chips (as marked in red) :-)
do you have any idea how can I make it look more as a smoothed tube?

Thanks in advance.

Fred,

Are you sure you really used the file name "myfile.csv" (and did not
alter that part of the error message for your posting)? Sounds a bit
like http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12181, especially because
you're still using ParaView 3.10.1

Sven

Subject: [Paraview] Data"decoding"...how
Message-ID: <20120528045810.GA3014@solfire>

Hi,

My environment is a Linux system.

I want to plot data in 2D-graphs.

The data are represented by ASCII integers in the range of 
0 to 65535 in a kind of "csv"...

The data are given in blocks, which are repeated along 
the stream.

$1;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$5;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$2;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$6;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$3;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$7;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$4;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$8;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;0

"$<n>" where "n" represents the "kind of measurement" (for example 
       "$1" contains values of all channels of the measurement of
       the temperatur, each value stand for the output of one sensor.
1      is no value. It is just there and should be ignored.
00000  is the measurement value itsself. It is always represented by 
       five digits, anything greater "0" have leading zeroes, for
       example 03141.
0      at the end of each line is a "end of line"-marker(I guess).

The blocks are repeated n times with a constant frequency, each 
represents one reading of all sensors.

Each graph is build from the series of <n> values of a certain sensor
of a certain kind of measurement ("$<n>") of all blocks. That is:
The graph consists of as much values as there are blocks given.

Here is an example:

$1;1;;00000;00000;val01;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;0

$3;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;00000;0
$7;1;;00000;00000;00000;00000;0

where val01,vall02,val03,val04 build the first four values of one of
the graphs to plot (four values of the same sensor).

Ideally there is no reformatting of the data with Unix/Linux tools
like sed, grep, awk,....etc in beforehand of the handling of the data
with paraview.

Ideally the stream of blocks is read from /dev/ttyS0 (RS232 serial interface 
of Linux). Second choice would be to first record the data and display
then.



* What steps are needed to correctly display the data as 2D-graphs
  in paraview?

* Is it possible to read the data directly and "life" from the serial
  interface?



Thank you very much in advance for any help!
Best regards,
mcc

Thanks a lot for your answer. I will use your suggestion. Unfortunately, I
am know facing the problem of getting those screenshots remotely, without X
server, and I have not been able to compile paraview with offscreen
support. When I finally got it, I will return to the script. Thanks again.

Best regards / Cordialmente,

In the Display tab, you can transform its representation, by changing
its rotation, scale and translation.

There is also a transformation filter, which has the same controls as on the display tab but for technical reasons is more reliable.

I've just noticed that none of my writer plugins are working from the GUI.
 They appear but when trying to write I get the following output:

Failed to create writer for:  "/path/to/file.mytype"
ERROR: In /ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/vtkSMWriterFactory.cxx, line
374
vtkSMWriterFactory (0x8b3d8a0): No matching writer found for extension:
mytype

Is this intentional and do we need to put in hints for each writer now?  I
thought the type just went in the pqXML file.

Thanks,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Controlling Render Views without Mouse
Message-ID: <CAGKeP0Rk6nzTCV0usnjRruH+Sp6sz1n2gNodb0VCRe4mrZOv4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

*Overview*
I am attempting to control ParaView v3.14.1 with something other than a
mouse and keyboard. I don't know how to do this - I've taken some wild
guesses and bits 'n' pieces have started to work. I could really use some
help from someone that knows the inner-workings though.

*What I'd Like to Happen*
I have an class, foo, with some events and callbacks of its own. Foo is not
related to ParaView in any way other than foo needs to make ParaView do
stuff as it sees fit. In the callbacks, I'd like to do things like zoom,
pan and rotate. Eventually I'd like foo to be able add filters and such
too, but that's a long way down the road.

*What I've Tried*
foo has 3 events similar to OnButtonDown, OnMouseMove, and OnButtonUp. I
figure, why not just call these methods (within vtkPVInteractorStyle) from
foo? This is what I've been trying.
I have made foo a friend of vtkPVInteractorStyle. I've created a global
pointer variable, g_pInteractorStyle, which points to vtkPVInteractorStyle.
I've created a mutator and two integer variables - m_x and m_y - within foo
to hold mouse coordinates. Any time that GetEventPosition()[0/1] is called,
I save those values to local variables - x and y - and pass them into foo's
mutator. This way, any time a real mouse is used, foo gets updated
coordinates. This also now gives me starting points to pass into
OnMouseMove.

Message-ID: <mailman.9.1338269033.22907.paraview@paraview.org>

this will initiate zoom, which it seems to.
Following that, I make a series of calls following the pattern:
g_pInteractorStyle->Current->OnMouseMove(m_x, m_y + *offset*,
g_pInteractorStyle->CurrentRenderer, g_pInteractorStyle->Interactor), where
*offset* is some integer value from -49 to 49 and neither m_x or m_y change
during the series of calls.
Finally, I call g_pInteractorStyle->OnButtonup(3).

I have also commented out one line each from OnButonDown and OnButtonUp:
this->InvokeEvent(vtkCommand::[Start/End]InteractionEvent). With these two
lines in place, OnButtonUp causes a crash. Without these lines in place
(when they're commented out), ParaView acts just fine. I know this is NOT a
good fix and I'm open to other suggestions, but it (this aspect) seems to
be working at the moment.

I've also tried looking into the QT libraries and moving the cursor via QT.
Unfortunately, I've been unable to find the right cursor because nothing
I've done has had any effect on the cursor I'm staring at (tried setPos()
and setShape()).

*The Problem*
OnMouseMove() has caused problem after problem. In our current setup
OnButtonDown(3, 0, 0) works great. OnMouseMove() kills paraview when it
reaches vtkPVRenderView::Render() called from somewhere within
vtkPVGenericRenderWindowInteractor. In a weak attempt to "fix" the problem,
I tried commenting out this Render() call. Nothing too major seemed to
break except that I'm blind as i try to zoom until I release the mouse
button (tests were done using the mouse at first). In other words:
Everything still working, but no rendering during zoom - only renders upon
releasing the mouse. I now try it with foo, and it acts as though
OnButtonUp(3) was never called - the whole foo routine finishes then I use
the mouse and click somewhere to start a new interaction, and it zooms to
wherever it should have zoomed when it finished foo's routines.

So two options: I can either let it die every time it tries to render, or
hold off rendering until I finish "moving the mouse" and then still be
required to click the mouse somewhere when I'm finished.

This is broken. And something tells me I'm going about this in a very wrong
fashion. How should I be doing this?

Thanks,
David Zemon

Have you posted on the paraview mailing list? This seems like a PV bug.

Subject: [Paraview] comparison of two dataset (same mesh ) but not in the
	same order
Message-ID: <4FC493BF.1020504@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi,

One of my student is validating his code, and we want to compare the 
results (point data, cell data).
We have two result: one from a commercial code, and the other from our code.

The dicretisation are the same: same number of node, same number of 
element. But the order of the node and element in the files are not the 
same, so we cant use append attributes.

For for the point data we use re-sample with dataset. But the problem is 
than the celldata is automatically converted to point data (I know there 
is no definition of  re-sample with dataset with cells in the source).

So my question is "Is there an easy way of sorting the point and cells 
so they have the same order for the two datasets so I can use append 
attributes?"

A sort of "clean to grid" that also apply a unique order to the point 
and cells.

Thanks,

Hi,

I tried to control my paraview from my Xoom tablet, throw plugin  
successfully.  I used a plugin that opens a port and listen to python 
commands, then from my tablet I send python command to rotate zoom, pan 
clip... (so now a have a realy big pad ;) ).

I don't think such a filter exists in ParaView. You'll have to write a
custom filter or a Python programmable filter to convert one of the
datasets to the same point/cell order as the other.

Hum, the GUI XML should be fine. Did you try to add those hint in the
XML itself to see if that solve the issue or not ?

Please let us know, as it looks like a bug to me.

Try the smooth filter. See the help on the filter for how the filter works
and what the controls do. Another option is the Loop Subdivision filter.

I would go so far as to say that there probably is no easy way to find consistent ordering of topology. In fact, I suspect that this is an NP-hard problem. (General graph isomorphism certainly is.) 

I would first pursue other resampling methods. You could apply the cell centers filter to the grid with cell data. That gives you a cloud of points at the center of each cell. The distinction between cell and point data is now in name only. Then, resample the point data grid with the cell centers. That will give you the point data interpolated to the cell centers.

Message-ID: <CAK6Z60ddqLZM-wR-33vXfyq8okv1FNiqc4rWV4T5NWSj-_9EHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have this tetrahedron as a VTK file. Is there any way to just
display its edges? I found the "Extract Edges" filter, but that show
all the edges of the discretization (whereas I'm only interested in
the edges of the geometry).

Cheers,
Nico

Or if you are only interested in viewing you could just change the display to wireframe, which only shows the edges on the surface.

Nico,

I suggest you apply the filter vtkPolyDataSilhouette and play with its settings.
The XML plugin to expose this VTK filter in the ParaView GUI is available as
attached file for bug 12619 (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12619).

Can you try: Filters -> Extract Surface, then Filters->Feature Edges and see if this is what you want?

Hi all,

I have this tetrahedron as a VTK file. Is there any way to just
display its edges? I found the "Extract Edges" filter, but that show
all the edges of the discretization (whereas I'm only interested in
the edges of the geometry).

Cheers,
Nico

Subject: [Paraview] Color surface by normal direction (inwards or outwards)
Message-ID: <5BCFF8DF-896F-4F9B-9BEF-1D45B612D7E2@gmail.com>

Hi all;
I was wondering if there's a way in paraview to color surfaces (ie triangles in a stl file) by the direction of their normals (inwards or outwards).

Meaning, if you pick a triangle, one side of it will be of one color while the other side will be of a different color, depending on whether that triangle normal is point towards the triangle of away from it.


Thank you

Lorenzo

Hi all,


I want to visualize time-averaged flow patterns of 3D CFD models,
but ParaView may not have integration filter over time.
Is there any ideas to do it on latest version of ParaView?

The workaround is to change the title at the same time to force a full
generation of the axis.
This issue is related to a change in the behavior of the VTK layer.
Here is the bug associated to it: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13064

Lorenzo,

Yes, you can do this.

Under the Display tab, choose the color of the front face in the
"Color" control panel. Set the "Color by" option to Solid Color, then
pick the color you want with the "Set Solid Color..." button. Then
scroll down almost to the bottom of the Display tab. There is a
"Backface Style" panel. If you set the representation to Surface, you
can then pick the color of the backface.

You can do other things, to, such as turn on front face or back face
culling, which you might find useful.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Lorenzo,

Please don't forget to CC the list so that others may benefit from the
discussion now and in the future through the list archives.

As I mentioned in my previous email, using the Surface representation lets
you pick the color. I just mentioned the culling options as potentially
useful ways to see some things on your geometry. I didn't mean to lead you
astray from your goal.

Message-ID: <69BF1B91005F564585971C3437CDAD7B29D8080F@umechphe.easf.csd.disa.mil>

I have a flyer plate in a simulation and would like to track the position
over time of a few prescribed points individually.  When I load my .exo
files
position is not a history variable.  If I make a selection of elements or
nodes is there a way to track one of those single nodes or elements.  I
thought about using a line tool but the displacement is not 1D.  There are
two other files called a .lis and a .hiso which do track the x y z min and
max
displacements of the inserted blocks in my simulation but im looking for
specific locations not just the min or max.

Thank you

Hi John,

Yes, I have a filter that uses cuda. I'm in progress of adding streaming 
capability to support larger datasets, and I'd have to roll back my 
current checkout to share with you which I haven't had time to do yet. 
My experience was similar to Dave's. It's very easy to use cuda from 
with PV, more challenging to use it well. I think you'll have no problem 
even without an example to work from.

It's mostly the setup/compilation etc that I haven't tried with CUDA and would like to experiment.

Hi Benjamin,

if you are using the spreadsheet view you can select the interesting
points and only show those ones. Once you play with time, you will see
the coordinates of those points updating.

If you were thinking of something else when you said tracking could
you be more precise on what you had in mind ? Live text annotation /
3D lines...

I know this should be very simple, but it certainly doesn't appear to be.

I have to different sets of .vtk files each one representing different variables.  All that I want to do is see the instantaneous correlation between the variables, i.e. I want to multiply them together.  Unfortunately I can't figure out how to specify data from different files in the calculator.  When I group the datasets, there is nothing that indicates what the name of the variables are...I'm guessing that would be helpful.

Take a look at this:

You can use similar approach to other arithmetic besides difference.

I got something like this, but it didn't work...It's a python script.
Each line in "D.txt" is a vector b, and I want to transform the default
arrow(vector a) to b's direction.
Firstly I calculate Quaternions to represent the rotation, then I got the
euler angle from the quaternions.
What's wrong with the following code? Please help me! Thanks a lot!!

Hi there,

for a couple of hours I have been trying to visualize my ANSYS Static Structrual results in ParaView. My goal is to visualize stream lines to document the force flow inside a part. 

Up to now I manage to import my 3d-mesh into paraview using the stl-interface. Importing the *.inp does end up with error messages. 
But what is the fastest and easiest way to import the FE-result, principal stress, ...

Thanks for your help,

Subject: [Paraview] change color map separately
Message-ID: <CACeyOhbxtVNo84Gr_bxqmNUCKutiChMJ4NrGKeJx6LwDGCrDpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,


I have multiple number of polydata and I want to change their color map in
order to manipulate the colors...
color by->Scalars; Edit color map;

However, I want to change each object* separately*, but when I try to do
so, all of the objects change due to the new parameters.

I think the reason is the same name of the scalars (Scalars) (?)

How can I overcome this ?



Regards,

Hila.

Hello,

 

since my last git update on the master branch I've got an error during
compilation:

 

"UnPutEnv" is not a member of vtksys::SystemTools.

 

I use Windows 7 64 Bit and Visual Studio 2008 (64 Bit compiler)and CMake
2.8.8. All submodules are up-to-date. Did I missed something?

 

Cheers,

Stephan

You need to start from a clean build directory.
The same thing happen to me yesterday.

Apply the "Calculator" or "Python Calculator" filters to give the
arrays unique names and then they will get their own color tables.

Yeah, this helps. Thank you.

Unfortunately I'm running into more trouble right now. During linking the
OpenMPI library, these projects yields some errors:

Cosmo
VPIC
Xdmf
vtkParallelMPI
vtkIOMPIImage
vtkIOParallelNetCDF 

Those projects references some MPI related functions (160 linker errors at
all). 

Any ideas?

Cheers,
Stephan

Can you explain what you mean by time-averaged flow patterns?

You can use temporal statistics to get statics over time. Is this what you
want?

For flow visualisation,  you can use Particle Tracer to trace particles.
You can also attach a Particle Pathlines filter to get path lines.
However, I should warn that those tracers are somewhat buggy in the current
release. I am currently working on revamping these filters and adding a new
streakline filter. The new filters should go into the development branch in
the next week or so.

Hello All,

I have
- two files "A" and "B";
- two different color scales "X" and "Y";

I applied elevation filter on "A"
and chose to color filter's output  using "X".
Then I applied elevation filter on "B"
and chose color scale "Y".

Result: both "A" and "B" were colored
according to "Y".

Is there an option to have "X" and "Y"
on the same screen?

Thank you,
Uliana

Hello,

In a filter I am writing, I am looking to hide certain points within my
dataset in the event of a given condition; is there a good way of doing
this? I have been reading the docs and experimenting with different things,
but I cannot find how to do this. In fact, I do not even need to "hide"
points, but I really just need to "disable" data on certain points at
certain times.

Hi Jane,

Do you know if you properly installed the opengl library ? Usually
they come with the NVidia driver. Did you properly installed your
video card driver ? Which version of the super build did you used ?
The one from the wiki, or the one from the source code ?

Thanks,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] time data in imported Tecplot file
Message-ID: <CAEfhisZmGLHtgQGHhD4iz5L3hXJM0CoSY4P66CZb+Ze6MHsL5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am new to Paraview, I have previously used Tecplot during my grad
studies.  I am using Paraview 3.14.1 64 bit on Linux Mint 13.  I am loading
a Tecplot binary (*.plt) file. The file is a 2D triangular mesh with a
number of time dependant variables (results from an oceanographic
circulation model).  As long as data data sharing linkage is not enabled
the file seems to load without problems.

My issue is that Paraview does not seem to associate a time with each of
the zones in the Tecplot data file.  The file loads as a multi-block data
file, I can examine each of the blocks using the 'extract block' filter,
but, I can't animate through the data as a time series.

How can I either: load the Tecplot file so that each zone is associated
with a time-step, or convert a multi-block data-set to that it is
interpreted by Paraview as a time-series?

Many Thanks,

Clayton

Yeah, this helps. Thank you.

Unfortunately I'm running into more trouble right now. During linking the
OpenMPI library, these projects yields some errors:

Cosmo
VPIC
Xdmf
vtkParallelMPI
vtkIOMPIImage
vtkIOParallelNetCDF 

Those projects references some MPI related functions (160 linker errors at
all). 

Any ideas?

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Streamtracer
Message-ID: <000d01cd3f05$b5dc6a40$21953ec0$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I have a question related to the parallelism of the stream tracer: As I
understand the code right, each line integration (trace) is processed in an
own MPI process. Right? 

To test the scalability of the Stream tracer I've load a structured
(curvilinear) grid and applied the filter with a Seed resolution of 1500 and
check the timings in a single and multi-thread (Multi Core enabled in PV
GUI) situation. 

I was really surprised that multi core slows done the execution time to 4
seconds. The single core takes only 1.2 seconds. Data migration cannot be
the explanation for that behavior (0.5 seconds). What is the problem here?

Please see attached some statistics...

Data:
* Structured (Curvilinear) Grid
* 244030 Cells
* 37 MB Memory

System:
* Intel i7-2600K (4 Cores + HT = 8 Threads)

Subject: [Paraview] How to gegt back a cell selection?
Message-ID: <BAY148-W2685FA9A0C555D43F08F5CB20B0@phx.gbl>


I have a "large" dataset, actually about 150k cells - it is large if you have to browse all cell ids of the IntegrateVariables table.
I want to select a cell in the 3D view and get back the cell id to use it as a seed cell for a near-by-near propagation algorithm.
First solution: I select it and look in the IntegrateVariable table display the cell id: the problem here is I have to browse hundreds of pages to find the selected cell and indeed the cell seems to be highlighted only if it lies in the current page displayed, so anyway it is not satisfying for large dataset.
Second solution: would it be possible to extract the cell id directly, ie to have it displayed so as to be able to copy it into the parameter of the next class?
Third - ideal - solution: to have the selected cell if copied directly into the parameter value of the next class.
Any suggestion?

Hi everyone, 
   I'm searching a way to convert a class (developed by our laboratory) to ParaView plugin.
   So, they have the  vtkOtsuSphereSource.cxx and vtkOtsuSphereSource.h file as in the attachments.
   With this class, they will be able to calculate the optimal threshold of an vtkImageData. The return value is this optimal threshold.
   
   I have some questions to ask you about how to convert this class so it can be used as ParaView plugin.
   - What does it means "vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkOtsuSphereSource)" and does it mandatory?
   - Error when compiling vtkOtsuSphereSourceClientServer.cxx:13:10: error: ?New? is not a member of ?vtkOtsuSphereSource?, so, it's because I don't have static vtkOtsuSphereSource* New(); in the .h file. So I want to ask : what is this?
   - When I added this static vtkOtsuSphereSource* New(); in the .h file. another compiling error : /vtkOtsuSphereSource/bin/vtkOtsuSphereSourceClientServer.cxx:13:35: error: cannot convert ?vtkOtsuSphereSource*? to ?vtkObjectBase*? in return so my class is not a vtkObjectBase, but how can we go through this error?
  
The following lines indicate the compiling error with static vtkOtsuSphereSource* New(); in .h file

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with particle cloud rendering
Message-ID: <CAE_bc5YySXNz7Kt7-oaOCGGF82uGgYtX_Ftsb4ay3nu5bqak-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to load vktPolydata file (time series) which shows point
particles.
When I try to change the camera View Angle from the default value (30.0')
to 0.0, ParaView messes the colors of those point particles and cannot
exactly define the order of the objects in the camera view rendering
process.

To be more specific, I first load the vtkpolydata to show the particles.
Then, I load another vtk file to represent a solid surface.
Logically, without any opacity, the solid surface should block view where
particles are covered. This is happeneing correctly in the defauly camera
view angle, 30.0
(see attached, good.png)
When I change the camera angle view to 0, this is what I get.
(see attached, bad.png)

I have tried this on 3.14.1 on both Ubuntu and Windows (64bit).
Can someone verify if this could be a bug?

Thanks,
Mohamad

I tried Temporal Statistics, and I got really good results.

Thanks a lot.

However, I should warn that those tracers are somewhat buggy in the current release. I am currently working on revamping these filters and adding a new streakline filter. The new filters should go into the development branch in the next week or so.

Hi Stephan,

The parallel stream tracer uses the partitioning of the grid to determine
which process does the integration. When the streamline exits the subdomain
of a process there is a search to see if it enters a subdomain assigned to
any other processes before figuring it whether it has left the entire
domain.

Leo, copied here, has been improving the streamline implementation inside
of VTK so you may want to get his newer version. It is a pretty tough
algorithm to parallelize efficiently without making any assumptions on the
flow or partitioning.

Hi Uliana,

ParaView has the restriction that it uses the same color scale for
variables with the same name. If you want two independent color bars I'd
suggest using the calculator filter to rename one of the fields.

Hi, Stephan,
   The previous implementation only has serial performance:  It traces the
streamlines one at a time and never starts a new streamline until the
previous one finishes.  With communication overhead, it is not surprising
it got slower.

  My new implementation is able to let the processes working on different
streamlines simultaneously and should scale much better.

Subject: [Paraview] Please could explain what
 vtkUnstructuredGrid::GetCellNeighbors(vtkIdType cellId, vtkIdList *ptIds,
 vtkIdList *cellIds) actually does?
Message-ID: <BAY148-W41E6BE051C940C6A4F33EAB20B0@phx.gbl>


This method is really badly documented: "Topological inquiry to get all cells using list of points exclusive of cell specified (e.g., cellId)."
What does it mean? What is the purpose of ptIds?
I have spent about 30 minutes trying to understand the code but I rarely saw a so complicated and unclear algorithm (3 for loops, 14 different local variables + 3 arguments in 50 lines of code) and actually I still do not understand the code (why is it necessary to find the point with the least valence??).
So my problem is simple : I want to get the cell neightbors of a given cell (neightbor = share at least a face), please could anybody tell me what I should put in that ptIds parameter?
Thx in advance for your help.

Hi, Andy and Leo,

thanks for your replies.

Is it possible to get this new implementation? I would to give it a try.

Subject: [Paraview] Thresholding an image
Message-ID: <CABDpjTmUTpa88U=bd5NdtpqPMhG7hKNXPqZK7VRiGcHz-weGGg@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to look for the pixels in an image whose magnitude are
above a certain value. I loaded the image, then tried to use the
Threshold filter. The tooltip says "Requires an attribute array with 1
component."

Question 1) Would it make sense to allow this filter to operate on one
of the channels of the image instead of having to extract it manually?

To generate this attribute array, I used the Calculator filter to make
an array called AbsX with abs(MetaImage_X). Then I applied a Threshold
filter to this new array. The values in this array are in [0 512].
When I leave the Lower Threshold all the way down and the Upper
Threshold all the way up, I can view the image just fine. In the
Display tab, the Color By is set to AbsX, like I want. However, as
soon as I move the Lower Threshold slider, the image disappears. When
I look in the Display tab, the only option for Color By is now Solid
Color.

Question 2) Why would the Color By options change based on the
threshold that is set? (I'd also ask why the image is disappearing,
but I think it might have to do with the coloring).

If I then try to glyph the output of the threshold filter (to draw
spheres or something at the location of the pixels that remain), the
Scalars option of the glyphs shows my AbsX array, but it is not
enabled. The only choice is under Vectors, and it is my MetaImage
array.

Question 3) Why can I not glyph the AbsX array?

Sorry for the long winded question, but hopefully someone can shed
some light on these issues!

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] VTK/ParaView and shared libs ...
Message-ID: <4FC83993.7060102@DLR.de>

Hi,


i noticed an behavior of VTK, which i cant explain at the moment. Maybe, 
someone found the same effect and has some thoughts ...

Ok - what was done:

o compiling ParaView 3.14.1 with QT 4.6.2 on a 64bit linux box
o comparing the Version without and with shared libs (BUILD_SHARED off 
and on)
o starting ParaView and have a look on the loading time / the time for 
the first interaction (e.g. clicking on load-button)
o measure the loading time of an complex case and the time for the 
rendering after a rotation of the (complex) model on the screen
o measurements done with TimerLog of ParaView

What i found was:

        | static          | shared
=====================================
GUI    | ok              | slow
Load   | 7.139 sec.      | 11.47 sec.
Rotate | 0.088 sec.      | 0.029 sec.

The slow GUI response (approx. 3-5 secs) of the shared variant is clear 
because of the loading time of all libs. The same holds for the "Load" - 
however - why is the render time after a rotation more then _two times 
faster as for the static case_?

Further on, these test above was done on a linux box with Quadro4000 
graphics card, 295.33 NVidia driver, SLED-Linux with 3.0.13er kernel and 
Xorg 7.4.

Now, i did the same tests on the same linux box, but with OpenSuse 12.1, 
3.1.10er kernel and Xorg 7.6 and got

        | static          | shared
=====================================
GUI    | ok              | ok
Load   | 7.279 sec.      | 11.28 sec.
Rotate | 0.5 sec.        | 0.028 sec.

Thats now really interesting: In both cases (static and shared) now the 
GUI is fast - why - i dont know. The Loading time is comparable to SLED 
- but the render time of the static case is now about 6 times slower 
then with SLED?! And - it has some unsteady delays in the redraw. The 
shared variant is ok and_again faster then the static one_...

Any ideas why the rendering is faster with shared libs?!

Best regards and thank you,

      Stefan

Message-ID: <FD119DD7-92AD-4D14-9349-BC2364D9E833@mac.com>

Hi all,


I was trying to build ParaView on CentOS.
It looked OK, but today other users on our machine tried to run ParaView,
they got errors as below:
> ERROR: In /home/magician/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 404

Maybe our ParaView tried to access my home directory from other users,
these errors are dumped.

I checked my CMakeCache again, and I found these parameters:
> VTK_GLEXT_FILE: /home/magician/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Utilities/ParseOGLExt/headers/glext.h
> VTK_GLXEXT_FILE: /home/magician/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Utilities/ParseOGLExt/headers/glxext.h
> VTK_MATERIAL_DIRS: /home/magician/ParaView-bin/VTK/Utilities/MaterialLibrary/Repository
> VTK_WGLEXT_FILE: /home/magician/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Utilities/ParseOGLExt/headers/wglext.h
> VTK_WRAP_HINTS: /home/magician/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Wrapping/hints

Maybe our ParaView's build setting depends on original source data on my home directory,
but it's not good for using many users.

Which is the best way to change our GL settings?

device on 1 (or sensor1)  which is given a name "head". "iotracker.head"
implies that we are using "iotracker.sensor1" for the tracking style.
Sensor 0 is not being used hence ignored.  I think your configuration may
be okay.

However I am not clear about what you are trying to do with rotation. There
is a slight rotation but it may not be very noticeable with head tracking.

My problem is that i have a data field (for example Pressure)  on a 3D mesh
and i want to interpolate this data to a 3D surface.

Can someone help me to solve this problem by using PV ?

different than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will
pick up the python header files and libraries from one version of python
and the python interpretor will be from a different version. I don't think
that's what's going on but you may want to check on that in CMake.

Can you send me your Fortran version of the wiki example?<br><br>From what =
I remember, CMake treats the Python interpretor/executable different than t=
he header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick up the pyth=
on header files and libraries from one version of python and the python int=
erpretor will be from a different version. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s wha=
t&#39;s going on but you may want to check on that in CMake.<br>

 What version are you on?<br>

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I&#39;m thinking of ways t=

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

I think the reason you didn&#39;t get any coprocessing tests is that they d=
epend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

I think I can guess what the problem is but can&#39;t be certain without so=
me more information. My guess is that you&#39;re using ParaView 3.14.1 for =
this and you&#39;re trying to use the fortran interface but haven&#39;t bui=
lt ParaView with Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at&#39;s not the case though I&#39;ll need more information on versions and=
 maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't=
 see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpr=
eter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

 a problem with the actors's visibility in the views getting screwed up. Bo=

Can I ignore this error? Anyway, the python interpreter seems to be created=

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figur=

 That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I coul=

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=
t unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any pro=
blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=
 version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=

self.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn=

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=
 have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been iro=
ned out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more inf=
ormation on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView=
 build directory.

t">It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything th=
at looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is=
 that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

<br>
I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe s=
ending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=

python interpretor will be from
 a different version. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on but =
you may want to check on that in CMake.<br>

o simplify the build since I haven&#39;t tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+P=
ython myself.<br>

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=

I think I can guess what the problem is but can&#39;t be certain without so=

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=
p the python header files and libraries from one version of python and the =
python interpretor will be from a different version. I don't think that's w=

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don=
=92t see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an int=
erpreter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

 a problem with the actors's visibility in the views getting screwed up. Bo=
th of those things are not my area of expertise so I've been reluctant to g=

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing=
 compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/o=
penmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors.=
 That=92s why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I co=
uld try gcc/openmpi and see if that linked to pgi/openmpi will run.

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=
t unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any pro=
blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=
 version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=
mplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+Python my=
self.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=
ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and retry this?

Thanks,

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn=

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=
 have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been iro=
ned out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more inf=
ormation on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView=
 build directory.

<div>Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stag=
e/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on =
the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:<br>
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in t=
he library (<a href=3D"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.o=
rg/wiki/Visibility</a>) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to=
 other libraries and executables trying
 to link to them.<br>
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through =
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it sh=
ould be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to ma=
ke the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
 which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you=
 noticed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on=
 it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake=
 too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attach=
ing it in case you'd like to use
 it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work dir=
ectly with ParaView builds.<br>
<br>
Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being mo=
re as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.<br>
<br>
By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or =
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.<br>

 What version are you on?<br>

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

built it properly. At least I don't see anything that looks wrong. I think =
the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is that they depend on Par=
aViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to
 download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.g=
it" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>) and then set the l=
ocation ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests (ctes=
t -R CoProcess) and show me the output
 from that.<br>

<br>
I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe s=
ending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't=
 see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpr=
eter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

Can I ignore this error? Anyway, the python interpreter seems to be created=

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figur=

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing=

 That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I coul=

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=
t unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any pro=
blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=
 version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=

self.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn=

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=
 have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been iro=
ned out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more inf=
ormation on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView=
 build directory.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:12.0pt">Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stag=
e/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on =
the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:<br>
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in t=
he library (<a href=3D"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.o=
rg/wiki/Visibility</a>) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to=
 other libraries and executables trying
 to link to them.<br>
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through =
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it sh=
ould be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to ma=
ke the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
 which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you=
 noticed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on=
 it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake=
 too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attach=
ing it in case you'd like to use
 it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work dir=
ectly with ParaView builds.<br>
<br>
Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being mo=
re as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.<br>
<br>
By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or =
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=
p the python header files and libraries from one version of python and the =
python interpretor will be from
 a different version. I don't think that's what's going on but you may want=

t">Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a=
 bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any =
problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.
 What version are you on?<br>
<br>
Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=
mplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI&#43;CUDA&#43;MPI&#=
43;Python myself.<br>

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=
ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and
 retry this?<br>

Thanks,<br>

t">It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything th=
at looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is=
 that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

<br>
I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe s=
ending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=
p the python header files and libraries from one version of python and the =
python interpretor will be from
 a different version. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on but =
you may want to check on that in CMake.<br>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:12.0pt">Hmm, ParaView has bee=
n undergoing a lot of changes lately so it&#39;s been a bit unstable. I jus=
t checked out a clean version and built it without any problems. The SHA fr=
om that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.
 What version are you on?<br>
<br>
Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I&#39;m thinking of ways t=
o simplify the build since I haven&#39;t tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+P=
ython myself.<br>

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=

python interpretor will be from a different version. I don't think that's w=

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't=
 see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpr=
eter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

nd to it yet. I think it's either a parallel rendering/compositing issue or=
 a problem with the actors's visibility in the views getting screwed up. Bo=
th of those things are not my area of expertise so I've been reluctant to g=

Not sure what changed, but I was able to build pgi/openmpi and got to the p=

Can I ignore this error? Anyway, the python interpreter seems to be created=

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figur=

working with PGI, CUDA and everything else.

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing=
 compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/o=
penmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors.=
 That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I coul=

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=
t unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any pro=
blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=
 version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=
mplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+Python my=
self.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=
ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and retry this?

Thanks,

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn=

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=
 have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been iro=
ned out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more inf=
ormation on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView=
 build directory.

So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

<br>
I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stag=
e/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on =
the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:<br>
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in t=
he library (<a href=3D"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility" target=3D"_blank=
">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a>) the FortranAdaptor API methods we=
ren't available to other libraries and
 executables trying to link to them.<br>
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through =
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it sh=
ould be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to ma=
ke the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
 which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you=
 noticed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on=
 it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake=
 too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attach=
ing it in case you'd like to use
 it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work dir=

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being mo=

<br>
By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or =
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.<br>

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=
ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and
 retry this?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Andy<o:p></o:p></p>

at looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is=
 that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

<br>
I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe s=
ending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=
p the python header files and libraries from one version of python and the =
python interpretor will be from
 a different version. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on but =
you may want to check on that in CMake.<br>

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=

pdate your version of ParaView and
 retry this?<br>

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't=
 see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpr=
eter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figur=

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing=
 compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/o=
penmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors.=
 That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I coul=

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=
t unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any pro=
blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn=
't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=
nning tests?

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=
 have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Andy,

I set PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON to ON, is more needed? It did build pvpython, =
I don't know if that's separate thing entirely, though.
$ pvserver -version
paraview version 3.14.1-1549-g5f34f40

$ python -version
Python 2.6.6

$ cmake -version
cmake version 2.8.9

CMakeCache.txt is attached.

I also just noticed that ctest -R CoProcessing returns No tests were found!=
!!, yet it does have other tests.
Let me know what else you need.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been iro=
ned out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more inf=
ormation on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView=
 build directory.

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()

  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonS=

coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Thanks,
Mark

 for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on
 my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now=
.<br>
<br>
Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki ex=

e interested.

Thanks, <br>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0p=
t">Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stag=
e/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on =
the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:<br>
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in t=
he library (<a href=3D"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility" target=3D"_blank=
">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a>) the FortranAdaptor API methods we=
ren't available to other libraries and
 executables trying to link to them.<br>
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through =
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it sh=
ould be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to ma=
ke the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
 which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you=
 noticed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on=
 it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake=
 too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attach=
ing it in case you'd like to use
 it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work dir=
ectly with ParaView builds.<br>
<br>
Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being mo=
re as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.<br>
<br>
By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or =
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=

 bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any =
problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.
 What version are you on?<br>
<br>
Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=
mplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI&#43;CUDA&#43;MPI&#=

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and
 retry this?<br>

t">It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything th=
at looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is=
 that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=

 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=

python interpretor will be from a different version. I don't think that's w=

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't=
 see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpr=
eter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

 a problem with the actors's visibility in the views getting screwed up. Bo=

Not sure what changed, but I was able to build pgi/openmpi and got to the p=

Can I ignore this error? Anyway, the python interpreter seems to be created=

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figur=

tunately at this point I don't know how to move forward except for trying t=
o piecemeal from having it working with GCC without everything you need to =
working with PGI, CUDA and everything else.

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing=
 compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/o=
penmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors.=
 That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I coul=

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=
t unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any pro=
blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=
 version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=

self.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=
ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=

Thanks,

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn=
't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=
nning tests?

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=
 have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Andy,

I set PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON to ON, is more needed? It did build pvpython, =
I don't know if that's separate thing entirely, though.
$ pvserver -version
paraview version 3.14.1-1549-g5f34f40

$ python -version
Python 2.6.6

$ cmake -version
cmake version 2.8.9

CMakeCache.txt is attached.

I also just noticed that ctest -R CoProcessing returns No tests were found!=
!!, yet it does have other tests.
Let me know what else you need.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been iro=
ned out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more inf=
ormation on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView=
 build directory.

Hello,

I'm setting up someone's code to use coprocessing with OSMesa and openmpi/p=

0x2B62188CFD9A:  48 8B 41 38            movq   56(%rcx),%rax

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()
{
  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonS=
criptPipeline.cxx
coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Thanks,
Mark

 for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on
 my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now=
.<br>
<br>
Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki ex=

e interested.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0p=
t">Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stag=
e/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on =
the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:<br>
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in t=
he library (<a href=3D"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility" target=3D"_blank=
">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a>) the FortranAdaptor API methods we=
ren't available to other libraries and
 executables trying to link to them.<br>
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through =
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it sh=
ould be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to ma=
ke the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
 which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you=
 noticed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on=
 it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake=
 too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attach=
ing it in case you'd like to use
 it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work dir=
ectly with ParaView builds.<br>
<br>
Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being mo=
re as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.<br>
<br>
By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or =
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=

 bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any =
problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.
 What version are you on?<br>
<br>
Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=
mplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI&#43;CUDA&#43;MPI&#=

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and
 retry this?<br>

t">It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything th=
at looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is=
 that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

<br>
I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe s=
ending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=
p the python header files and libraries from one version of python and the =
python interpretor will be from
 a different version. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on but =
you may want to check on that in CMake.<br>

 What version are you on?<br>
<br>
Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I&#39;m thinking of ways t=

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

I think the reason you didn&#39;t get any coprocessing tests is that they d=

 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

I think I can guess what the problem is but can&#39;t be certain without so=
me more information. My guess is that you&#39;re using ParaView 3.14.1 for =
this and you&#39;re trying to use the fortran interface but haven&#39;t bui=
lt ParaView with Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=

 maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=

I think the reason you didn&#39;t get any coprocessing tests is that they d=
epend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't=
 see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpr=
eter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing=

 That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I coul=

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=

blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=

 the type of grid that you're planning on using? The PhastaAdaptor is an ex=
ample of dealing with an unstructured grid. I also just updated the coproce=
ssing tutorials page (now at
<a href=3D"http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials" target=3D"_blan=
k">http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials</a>) to include the tuto=
rial I'll be doing at SC12. It should have some useful information for doin=
g this. You could just do a polydata
 input, just set the center of the sphere source in your example based on t=
he process rank (e.g. Sphere-&gt;SetCenter(10*rank, 0, 0); ) so that it's e=
asy to tell the difference between each processes input part/domain partiti=
on.<br>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0p=
t">Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stag=
e/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on =
the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:<br>
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in t=
he library (<a href=3D"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility" target=3D"_blank=
">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a>) the FortranAdaptor API methods we=
ren't available to other libraries and
 executables trying to link to them.<br>
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through =
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it sh=
ould be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to ma=
ke the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
 which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you=
 noticed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on=
 it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake=
 too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attach=
ing it in case you'd like to use
 it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work dir=
ectly with ParaView builds.<br>
<br>
Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being mo=
re as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.<br>
<br>
By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or =
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.<br>

 that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=

) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=

 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=
p the python header files and libraries from one version of python and the =
python interpretor will be from a different version. I don't think that's w=
hat's going on but you may want to check on that in CMake.

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/=
pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm worki=
ng on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 =
and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source ta=
rball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaVi=
ew-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git bran=
ch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to r=
eturn the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't=
 see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpr=
eter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think y=

nd to it yet. I think it's either a parallel rendering/compositing issue or=
 a problem with the actors's visibility in the views getting screwed up. Bo=
th of those things are not my area of expertise so I've been reluctant to g=
o and fix it. Now that you've publicly shamed me I'm going to have to bite =
the bullet and fix it :)  Hopefully by the end of next week it will be fixe=

Hi Andy,
Not sure what changed, but I was able to build pgi/openmpi and got to the p=

Can I ignore this error? Anyway, the python interpreter seems to be created=

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figur=

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing=
 compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/o=
penmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors.=
 That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I coul=
d try gcc/openmpi and see if that linked to pgi/openmpi will run.

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bi=
t unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any pro=
blems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What=
 version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=
mplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+Python my=
self.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=
ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and retry this?

Thanks,

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn=

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when ru=

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just=
 have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that =
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is th=
at they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaView=
Data (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.=
git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the =
coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been iro=
ned out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more inf=
ormation on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView=
 build directory.

So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

By single node I'm assuming that you mean a single process, correct? What's=

<a href=3D"http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials" target=3D"_blan=

 for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on
 my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now=
.<br>
<br>
Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki ex=

e interested.

Thanks, <br>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0p=
t">Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stag=
e/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on =
the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:<br>
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in t=
he library (<a href=3D"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility" target=3D"_blank=
">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a>) the FortranAdaptor API methods we=
ren't available to other libraries and
 executables trying to link to them.<br>
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through =
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it sh=
ould be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to ma=
ke the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
 which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you=
 noticed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on=
 it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake=
 too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attach=
ing it in case you'd like to use
 it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work dir=
ectly with ParaView builds.<br>
<br>
Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being mo=
re as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.<br>
<br>
By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or =
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=

python interpretor will be from
 a different version. I don't think that's what's going on but you may want=

t">Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a=
 bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any =
problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.
 What version are you on?<br>
<br>
Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to si=
mplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI&#43;CUDA&#43;MPI&#=

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=
porarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs b=
ut gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to u=
pdate your version of ParaView and
 retry this?<br>

Thanks,<br>

t">It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything th=
at looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is=
 that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe
 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=
ocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess)
 and show me the output from that.<br>

<br>
I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some m=
ore information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and=
 you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with=
 Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe s=
ending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

ent than the header files and libraries. By this I mean that it will pick u=

python interpretor will be from
 a different version. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on but =
you may want to check on that in CMake.<br>

 What version are you on?<br>
<br>
Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I&#39;m thinking of ways t=

<br>
With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were tem=

I think the reason you didn&#39;t get any coprocessing tests is that they d=

 the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://<a href=3D"http://paravie=
w.org/ParaViewData.git" target=3D"_blank">paraview.org/ParaViewData.git</a>=
) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the copr=

 and show me the output from that.<br>

I think I can guess what the problem is but can&#39;t be certain without so=
me more information. My guess is that you&#39;re using ParaView 3.14.1 for =
this and you&#39;re trying to use the fortran interface but haven&#39;t bui=
lt ParaView with Python enabled. There were some
 dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If th=
at&#39;s not the case though I&#39;ll need more information on versions and=
 maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.<br>

Seems I am missing some arguments here.
