Although I am not sure the command you want, let me tell you  how to find it.

Run ParaView.
Tools/ Start Trace

Save some geometry (I assume you mean File/ Save Data)

Tools/ Stop Trace.

If that doesn?t work, we have a bug in ParaView.  Please report it.

Thanks,

Alan

I finally tried to follow up on this, and since I am downloading binary releases, there is no such directory for me of course.
Where can I find a reference or generate one for the python interface?  How do people learn this stuff or explore it?

Hi Rich,

Maybe the active view is not the one that has your rendering.
You may need to call SetView(RenderView2).

However, I'm still curious as to how the person in question discovered how to do it.  Where is all the good python documentation/lore stored?  The wiki wasn't too helpful to me in that respect, i.e., as a reference, although it has a lot of good ideas/information.

I recorded a script to try to understand how to export a time series of an isosurface as .x3d files so I can muck with them using blender.

Hi,

In my project i got a trajectory of a oil leak

The problem is that the only data that i get about the trajectory its
positions over time

With that, right now, i can only plot points

I would like to give the impression of a oil slick to that animation

The animation is done with a series of .CSV files containig the positions
of the trajectory information

Does someone know or have a hint how to help me?

A user asks the following question.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Alan


As a quick follow-up, Jeff mentioned that I could use any python interpreter.  I have been trying to get this to work on my Windows 7 PC, but I am having some problems loading the "python.simple" module.  

I've added several paths to my user environment variables (PATH and PYTHONPATH), but I still get the error:

>> from paraview.simple import *

ImportError: No module named paraview.simple.

I'm guessing this is a simple problem with the interpreter not finding the correct path.  I just don't know where it is.  I've tried adding:

C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.0.1\lib; C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.0.1\lib\paraview-4.0; C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.0.1\lib\paraview-4.0\site-packages;
C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.0.1\bin; C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.0.1\bin\Lib

Do you have any idea what the solution is for this?

Thanks,
Kevin

Is it possible that spaces in the pathnames are causing problems?

Message-ID: <76FE9F3BFF0B1B4A9EFDA35095CBA32C18E272F2@PRDEXMBX-07.the-lab.llnl.gov>

I consider it a bug that I cannot paste more than one line of text at a time into the ParaView Python Shell window.  If for example I paste two lines of python, only the first line is executed.  This is a hassle for experimenters like myself who create a code snippet, try it out, modify it, try it again?. This happens on Linux and Mac for me.  I am displaying back to a Mac even when running on Linux, so it might be that there is some Mac-specific XQuartz window manager/line ending trickery happening.
Not sure where to report so I'm posting to the list.  Apologies if this is the wrong venue.
Thanks!

I just tried the directions I gave below, and this command is not correctly written using the Trace Recorder.  This is a bug.  Would you mind writing it up, or should I?

I don?t know the answer to your question, hopefully someone else on the list can help.

Please keep replies on the paraview list, so everyone can learn and participate.

Alan

 I mean the Python's language command in the Python Shell.

I need a command, a similar call certain functions from the File -> Save Geometry

.

Although I am not sure the command you want, let me tell you  how to find it.



Run ParaView.

Tools/ Start Trace



Save some geometry (I assume you mean File/ Save Data)



Tools/ Stop Trace.



If that doesn?t work, we have a bug in ParaView.  Please report it.



Thanks,



Alan

I think Utkarsh pushed some stuff to generate some documentation related to
that.
This should start showing up in couple of days here:

Sounds like your data comes from a smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation or something similar. Representing the particles as connected liquids is hard, and I don't think ParaView has very many solutions. 

You could try using the point sprite plugin to render the points as larger spheres. It will probably look more like a bumpy blob than an liquid, but the overlap will at least represent larger structures.

I'm pretty sure I added a commit that fixes this behavior, but that may
have happened after the 4.0 release.  See commit:


commit af99ee38d6edcefaeb5f5bd2936f0bf82bdcf565
Author: Pat Marion <pat.marion at kitware.com>
Date:   Fri May 24 12:23:56 2013 +1000

    Change the behavior of pqPythonShell::pushScript() to split over
newlines

    Previously, you could not paste multiline statements into the ParaView
    python console.  This commit changes the behavior of the pushScript()
    function so that it splits the script code over the newline character
    and pushes each line separately.

    This does change the behavior of entering multiline statements:
previously
    pushScript() would attempt to detect the indent and start the next line
    using the indent of the previous line.  This behavior has been removed.

    The new behavior closely matches the behavior of the standard
commandline
    python interpreter.

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot build ParaView for VS 2010
Message-ID: <CADnW_h0LOYwamJ6yHe6oGzs0R__4OWrByKjhat_XgieYG4TTAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I am having a really hard time building ParaView for VS 2010 even after
putting in 2 weeks of dogged effort. All the following attempts were made
with Visual Studio 2010 with Service Pack1, and with QT add-in installed.

Here are the list of troubles I am running into :

1) For a 64 bit build with Python : The build just hangs midway. For
instance, it will build 53 projects and then just halt there forever. I
have to crash Visual Studio at this point. An interesting observation is
that devenv.exe still keeps running even after I have terminated the Visual
STudio application from the task manager. For 64 bit build, I build QT
4.8.4 from source on my own as per these instructions :
http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/2011/02/01/how-to-compile-qt-4-7-with-visual-studio-2010/

2) For a 32 bit build (without Python) : I am able to build ParaView. But
when I launch ParaView, it crashes if I try to do Volume Rendering. This
same problem was reported by another person earlier here :
http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg19197.html

3) For builds with Visual Studio 2008, the build is successful. But when
the executable is launched, my debugger breaks into some assembly code and
the application crashes.

FYI, I have 24 GB of ram, and a Sandy Bridge core i&-3930K CPU, and my
build tools work fine except while building ParaView.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <B23B9359-74D6-4EB2-9749-D20FC06C0981@ltd.uni-erlangen.de>

Hello,

since now I was using Paraview 4.0.0-RC1 on a Mac with OS X 10.9. I visualised vtk files containing simulation output created by own MATLAB code.

Today, I updated Paraview to the current version 4.0 (Darwin). Now, I can not open my vtk files any more. Find an example file attached. Paraview recognises neither any points, nor cells nor other grid data.

I also tried the Python 2.7 version of Paraview, the current nightly build and finally I downgraded to v. 3.98, but the problem still remains. Is there a fault in my vtk file structure that coincidentally used to be working with the 4.0 RC version? Or is there something wrong with the Paraview import filter?

Cheers
Tristan

Subject: [Paraview] view 8-node quad mesh
Message-ID: <5277A0B2.9030401@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Now I have a problem to view 8-node quad mesh in vtk file. The mesh 
(wireframe) is displayed as triangles rather than quads. It seems there 
is a similar issue reported in

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-September/022599.html

But I don't know how to solve it. I'm using 4.0.1 64bit version with 
'Use Multi-Core' option switched off. An example vtk file is attached.

The data file you attached doesn't have quads, it indeed has
triangles. If you look at the values for "types" array for cells in
the file. It's 5 which corresponds to triangles. How was the file
generated?

Can you build ParaView in debug mode and send us the stack trace?

Subject: [Paraview] plot 2D integral of 3D scalar field
Message-ID: <bc51350815803346c83cfdc0ab7654b8@ill.fr>

 Hello,
I can't seem to figure out whether this is possible with Paraview... My
data consists of a scalar field localized in one region of space,
representing a density. I want to compute and plot the 2D integral of
this density to obtain in the form of a curve, i.e. the density along
the z-axis would be:
int2d [rho(x,y,z) dx dy]
Also, can I compute the moments of my distribution, for instance Rx^2 =
int3d (rho*x^2) ?
Thanks,
Airidas

Message-ID: <a5432a1f471444948758cbd8d6a6b2eb@AMSPR01MB167.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>


Dear all,

I'm trying to export 2D vector fields from a MATLAB array to .vtk format to be read in paraview. I am currently using a modified version of a third-party routine developed by William Thecke

http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34310-matlab-3d-vectors-to-paraview-via-binary-vtk-file

I can finally get Paraview to read them because I basically zero all the z components, but I'm having problems doing streamlines and such from this. Is there something special I need to take into consideration when trying to view 2D stuff in Paraview?

Any help would be appreciated.

Many thanks,

Khurom Kiyani

Ashish,

*What version of ParaView you are building? Is this the first time you are
trying to build this version?*
>>> I am trying to build ParaView 4 (64 bit). It now compiles successfully
(but does not run properly). I am now using an identical set of tools and
libraries as have been used in building ParaView 4 64 bit release, as per
this wiki entry <http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries>. I have Visual
Studio 2008 SP1, QT 4.8.2 and Python 2.7.3. and Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.

With the above mentioned set of tools and libraries, I am able to CMAKE
generate a Visual Studio solution containing 593 projects. And they all
compile successfully upon ALL_BUILD. However, when I launch my application,
it still crashes when I try to do Volume Rendering. My datasets are .VTK
files of 300x300x500 voxels, and they do work just fine with the ParaView4
installed directly from the binaries hosted on ParaView website.

*Did you use any special flags when you attempted to build ParaView (such
as /Mp)*
>>> No, I do not use any special flags other than ENABLE_PYTHON, and CMake
iteratively until all Python paths are set. (Until all red turns white in
CMake GUI)

I have attached my CMakeCache and Debug Stack Trace. The Stack Trace was
taken at the point in time when ParaView crashes while trying to render
Volume. The crash happens at line 'input2->ShallowCopy(this->GetInput());'
inside vtkSmartVolumeMapper::ConnectFilterInput(vtkImageResample *f) scope.
Thank you for looking into this.

Regards

Greetings,

   I am a new Paraview user, and am still getting used to the program.
 
   I have several .vtk files that have a EM grid, as well as the corresponding electric and magnetic field data,

   When I open the EM grid, I can see that without any problems, but I cannot see the field lines at all.

   I don't know the easiest way to show this on the mailing list, but can anyone provide me with further instructions/guidance?

  Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAKY2W8CUmE2qxKSMDMzYnwrvwv2fkqNVwwavSO5e559a=WJzLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Paraview'ers,

When loading a Netcdf with irregular time steps, Paraview (4.0.1, 64bit)
does not seem able to cope and only shows just one time step.  It's not a
really problem for me per se, since I discovered it by accident when my
data had irregular time steps by mistake.  But it might be a bug that
affects someone else with irregularly time spaced Netcdf data.

Cheers,

Paul

That sounds weird. I don't recall hearing that before.

How irregular were the time steps? Were they not monotonically increasing? I can imagine that might foul up ParaView.

Any chance you could send a sample?

Hi Ken,

In my haste I deleted the problem file, unfortunately.  I tried replicating
it but haven't been able to so far.

I actually think the problem was that the problem timesteps were earlier in
time but later in the sequence, so not monotonically increasing.

I'll certainly send you a sample if I can replicate it.

Paul

Hi all,

Is there a special reason why two individual IsoVolumes (set to Volume 
representation) do not clip against each other at all? The last one in 
the pipeline simply wins. I tried to change a lot of stuff from props, 
nothing helps. If I switch one to surface representation, everything 
works as expected. The two volumes are like 2 separate images blended 
into each other. I attached two images.

All the best and thanks for this great tool,
Christian

ParaView and VTK in general, doesn't support rendering multiple
datasets as volume-rendering in the same view. One solution is to
append the two datasets and then volume render the result. Note this
will increase memory and append will need as much extra memory as the
two combined datasets.

Subject: [Paraview] Delaunay 2D question
Message-ID: <09DA13BF-7960-4FD3-8F3F-D42F44AB9598@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I have a query regarding the optimal way of visualising some point data from an experiment & CFD.

I have several 2D PIV windows from an experiment which have between 100 and 800 points arranged at several x and y locations. In order to compare these against CFD simulations I output the data from the same points in the CFD solver.

To visualise them I currently use the CSV reader, table to points, and then the Delaunay2D filters to turn this data into 2D slices.

The problem I have is when I have a gap in the data i.e the shape is not a square but has an empty bit in the middle. The Delaunay 2D filter triangulates all the data and it therefore doesn't constrain to the boundaries of the data.

I have attached three files which hopefully illustrate my problem.

I wanted to ask if there is a way to constrain the Delaunay2D filter or use an alternative method to ensure that the shape of the PIV/data window is preserved. I'm sure this type of thing is done fairly regularly but I couldn't figure out how to do this in Paraview.

Many thanks,

Neil

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview and GPU
Message-ID: <1383749235.93531.YahooMailNeo@web163002.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I'm using paraview on a Linux-64 machine with 4 cores. I run paraview with multicore enabled (4 cores). My video card is 

NVIDIA Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 430]. I have 16GB RAM installed.


Currently, the interaction with large datasets are very slow. The memory usage is at most 8GB, so I do not think it is a RAM issue. I assume that my videocard is not good enough. I'm considering upgrading it, but before want to be sure of everything. 


My first question is whether I need to do anything special to make paraview use GPU. When I buy a videocard with a better GPU, will paraview utilize it automatically? 

I'll appreciate your response. Regards

Birkan

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.98 build error with ffmpeg
Message-ID: <527A595D.7070403@legi.grenoble-inp.fr>

I'm building paraview 3.98 with FFMPEG enabled.
I've installed FFMPEG 2.1 from http://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_2.1

I get two errors in ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/IO/FFMPEG/vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx:

1) vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx:165:18: error: ?CodecID? was not declared in this scope
c->codec_id = (CodecID)this->avOutputFormat->video_codec;

2) vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx:234:28: error: ?avcodec_open? was not declared in this scope
if (avcodec_open(c, codec) < 0)

I was unable to find if there is a recommended version of ffmpeg to use for 
building paraview 3.98 and I'm not familiar with ffmpeg.

Thanks for your advices.

Patrick

Message-ID: <CAEc4V-Z00u0x1ZvnC9rc_2h-M_CLspZzsfTnGx2u0JXEqGMBgw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to use the python shell to get the data for a single point
from a data set. I have point data which is imported as a Polygonal Mesh.

I can use the following to get a handle to an array,

data = GetActiveSource()
pointdata = data.PointData()
pressure_array = pointdata.GetArray('Pressure')

However at this point I can't extract the value for a given point index,
I've tried,

pressure_array.GetValue(17)
pressure_array.GetPointData(17)

Where 17 is a point index. both these functions just give me an error. Can
anyone help with this?

Cheers,
Bruce

That version of ParaView doesn't support FFMPEG 2.1. Try an older
version of FFMEG
(http://www.paraview.org/files/dependencies/ffmpeg-0.6.5.tar.gz).

In-Reply-To: <09DA13BF-7960-4FD3-8F3F-D42F44AB9598@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk>
Message-ID: <CE9FB456.120B6%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The problem you have is that you have no way to define what the outer boundaries of the shape are. As a human looking at the shape, I can reasonably guess that the space in the middle bottom of the data is supposed to be empty. But even then I'm not totally sure where the boundary is. I don't think there is any reasonable way a filter can predict where there is or isn't supposed to be data. The Delaunay filter makes the reasonable (but often wrong) assumption that mesh should cover the convex hull. However, the convex hull is conservative in that the result will always cover the space that should be covered plus some extra. So perhaps the easiest thing to do is remove the extra. I can think of three possible ways to do this.

First, you mentioned that you have a CFD solver. I presume that means you have a proper mesh for the CFD solver. Bring in that mesh and then run the Resample With Dataset filter with the results of the Delaunay2D as the Input and the CFD mesh as the Source. This will give you the CFD grid with the experimental values interpolated on the points.

The second thing you could try is to remove "bad" triangles. In you image I notice that most if not all of the polygons in the "empty space" region are either unusually large or unusually thin. You can use the Mesh Quality filter to get the area and aspect ratio of the triangles and then use the threshold filter to remove the triangles that are unusually large or thin.

The third thing you could try is to simply use the extract selection filter to get the cells you want. Use the "Select Cells On" tool to select the empty region of the data, then invert the selection, then run the Extract Selection filter.

I hope that helps.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Delaunay 2D question

Hi all,

I have a query regarding the optimal way of visualising some point data from an experiment & CFD.

I have several 2D PIV windows from an experiment which have between 100 and 800 points arranged at several x and y locations. In order to compare these against CFD simulations I output the data from the same points in the CFD solver.

To visualise them I currently use the CSV reader, table to points, and then the Delaunay2D filters to turn this data into 2D slices.

The problem I have is when I have a gap in the data i.e the shape is not a square but has an empty bit in the middle. The Delaunay 2D filter triangulates all the data and it therefore doesn't constrain to the boundaries of the data.

I have attached three files which hopefully illustrate my problem.

I wanted to ask if there is a way to constrain the Delaunay2D filter or use an alternative method to ensure that the shape of the PIV/data window is preserved. I'm sure this type of thing is done fairly regularly but I couldn't figure out how to do this in Paraview.

Many thanks,

Neil

That is not a lot of detail to go on so I have to guess what the problem is. It is probably either that the seeds are not intersecting the mesh or that vectors do not yield good lines.

If you mesh is very thin or comprises surface elements, then chances are all the seed points are outside your mesh. The default point source is actually a point cloud with randomly selected points within a sphere of a certain radius. If your mesh is flat, the chance of any seed happening to hit it are extremely low. Try changing to a line source and see if that helps.

It could be that the vectors your creating are not integrating well. It could be that the vectors are pointing off of the mesh (which is also common in thin or flat meshes). Thus it dies before it starts. Or perhaps it has some other feature that makes it difficult to integrate.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for your suggestions.  I still haven't worked out why it's not
working, but I notice that no data is registering in the Stream Tracer
filter.  It's mesh is empty - no points or cells - and the bounding
information not available.

I tried a high density Line Source, as you suggested, as well as increasing
the number of seed points within the radial ball of the Point Source but
without success.  However, both the Line Source and the Point Source
correctly display within the domain of the 3D vector field.

The vectors themselves (from the glyph filter) display correctly.

Paul

Thank you Ken, that was exactly the reply I was hoping for. I used the extraction tool to remove the unwanted cells, but I will also investigate the first two steps too.

The problem you have is that you have no way to define what the outer boundaries of the shape are. As a human looking at the shape, I can reasonably guess that the space in the middle bottom of the data is supposed to be empty. But even then I'm not totally sure where the boundary is. I don't think there is any reasonable way a filter can predict where there is or isn't supposed to be data. The Delaunay filter makes the reasonable (but often wrong) assumption that mesh should cover the convex hull. However, the convex hull is conservative in that the result will always cover the space that should be covered plus some extra. So perhaps the easiest thing to do is remove the extra. I can think of three possible ways to do this.

First, you mentioned that you have a CFD solver. I presume that means you have a proper mesh for the CFD solver. Bring in that mesh and then run the Resample With Dataset filter with the results of the Delaunay2D as the Input and the CFD mesh as the Source. This will give you the CFD grid with the experimental values interpolated on the points.

The second thing you could try is to remove "bad" triangles. In you image I notice that most if not all of the polygons in the "empty space" region are either unusually large or unusually thin. You can use the Mesh Quality filter to get the area and aspect ratio of the triangles and then use the threshold filter to remove the triangles that are unusually large or thin.

The third thing you could try is to simply use the extract selection filter to get the cells you want. Use the "Select Cells On" tool to select the empty region of the data, then invert the selection, then run the Extract Selection filter.

I hope that helps.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Delaunay 2D question

Hi all,

I have a query regarding the optimal way of visualising some point data from an experiment & CFD.

I have several 2D PIV windows from an experiment which have between 100 and 800 points arranged at several x and y locations. In order to compare these against CFD simulations I output the data from the same points in the CFD solver.

To visualise them I currently use the CSV reader, table to points, and then the Delaunay2D filters to turn this data into 2D slices.

The problem I have is when I have a gap in the data i.e the shape is not a square but has an empty bit in the middle. The Delaunay 2D filter triangulates all the data and it therefore doesn't constrain to the boundaries of the data.

I have attached three files which hopefully illustrate my problem.

I wanted to ask if there is a way to constrain the Delaunay2D filter or use an alternative method to ensure that the shape of the PIV/data window is preserved. I'm sure this type of thing is done fairly regularly but I couldn't figure out how to do this in Paraview.

Many thanks,

Neil

Thanks all for your quick answers!

Utkarsh,
I've downloaded ffmpeg-0.6.5.tar.gz  yesterday evening but it doesn't compile 
with gcc 4.8. I've tried a newer versionffmpeg-0.6.7 but the problem remains.
The error was in ffserver.c with an implicit function declaration. I solved it 
with adding "#include "libavformat/internal.h" in this file.
Paraview 3.98.1 compiled successfully this night with ffmpeg enabled.

Alan,
Yes I will use ParaView version 4.1 but I had some trouble compiling this 
version with the boost library and paraview. May be there is also a recommended 
version of boost to use. So I fall back to paraview 3.98.1 which is the version 
in prod. I was needing to compile it back because
- I had disabled ffmpeg in the previous compilation
- I've a new version of MPI and GCC
- I've setup an infiniband connection between the nodes of my cluster to run 
large visualizations.
So, moving to ParaView 4.1 start now as 3.98.1 has compiled with this new setup 
and will be in prod this morning.

Thanks again

Patrick

Just in case anyone else makes the attempt and fails and to remind myself when I lose my config ? (apologies, I?ve never used a mac before, so I?m new to this and I?ve had it less than 24 hours so it may be there are easier ways to get this done).

Assuming you are using default clang

/usr/bin/c++ --version

Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)

Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.2

Thread model: posix

qt4 - did not compile out of the box, this link
http://trac.macports.org/ticket/40852
lists a bunch of patches. I downloaded the diffs for the Qt part (ignore the mac ports diffs) and applied them to the qt-4.8.5 source from
http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.5/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.5.tar.gz
I only applied the patches with .2 in them where there are more than one for the same file (was that wrong?)

patch-src_3rdparty_clucene_src_CLucene_search_FieldCacheImpl.cpp.diff

patch-src_3rdparty_webkit_Source_WebCore_platform_Timer.cpp.2.diff

 To build Qt I used the following config line (I had to disable webkit even with the patches supplied, also lib tiff gave me trouble so I disabled that too)

configure --prefix=/Users/biddisco/apps/qt/4.8.5/clang_64 -system-zlib -confirm-license -opensource -nomake demos -nomake examples -cocoa -fast -release -no-3dnow -L/opt/X11/lib -I/opt/X11/include -platform unsupported/macx-clang -no-qt3support -no-libtiff -no-webkit -nomake docs -arch x86_64

Mpich-3.0.4 did not compile out of the box either, so instead I installed ?brew? for package management and used

brew install mpich2

Which in fact installs

mpich2-3.0.4
Which is just what we want

Before building paraview, apply a couple of small patches

Hi Ken,

Thanks for your suggestions.  I still haven't worked out why it's not working, but I notice that no data is registering in the Stream Tracer filter.  It's mesh is empty - no points or cells - and the bounding information not available.

I tried a high density Line Source, as you suggested, as well as increasing the number of seed points within the radial ball of the Point Source but without success.  However, both the Line Source and the Point Source correctly display within the domain of the 3D vector field.

The vectors themselves (from the glyph filter) display correctly.

Paul

If you mesh is very thin or comprises surface elements, then chances are all the seed points are outside your mesh. The default point source is actually a point cloud with randomly selected points within a sphere of a certain radius. If your mesh is flat, the chance of any seed happening to hit it are extremely low. Try changing to a line source and see if that helps.

It could be that the vectors your creating are not integrating well. It could be that the vectors are pointing off of the mesh (which is also common in thin or flat meshes). Thus it dies before it starts. Or perhaps it has some other feature that makes it difficult to integrate.

Yup, figured it out. There are a couple of problems with the state file you sent me.

First, you have the stream tracer filter connected to the output of the glyph filter. It needs to be connected to the calculator (VectorCalc) filter. I'm sure that was just a silly mistake.

Second, your data set is super extremely long. The dimensions are 45 x 40 x 98,800. As I said in a previous email, if your data is very skinny (or thin), then the point seed for the stream tracer is likely to completely miss the data. The line source doesn't seem to be working either. Perhaps the cells are so long and thin the cell locator or integrator is not operating correctly.

I see you tried to correct this skinniness by using the scale transform in the display properties. This only scaled the data when rendering. The underlying data that filters operate on is still really, really skinny. I advise to never, never, never use the transform options in the display properties. They screw up some other features in ParaView and also lead to pretty confusing behavior even when the result is technically "right" (as you just experienced). I've advocated in the past in getting rid of this feature, but too many people rely on it.

Anyway, the right thing to do is use the transform filter to adjust the scale of the actual data. Once you do that, the data will behave as expected. Attached is a screenshot of some successful streamlines.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for figuring it out.  It's a tremendous help!

So now I know I should have used the transform filter on the data from the
beginning, rather than the transform option in the display properties.
This makes a lot of sense since it saves having to transform each and every
time a new variable is displayed (I feel like a dummy for not doing this
first off, but I am fairly new to Paraview).

Greatly appreciated,

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] problems with paraview running on windows
Message-ID: <575E8096A9930B46851CC5AD8DCAF7A9122E8CCC@Gandalf2.ipat-dom.ipat.uni-erlangen.de>

Hello,

I'm using paraview version 4.0.1 Windows 64 bit, but the problem also occured with an older version. I have problems when exporting videos or "plotting selection over time". The transient data has about 5000 time steps and the mesh has 1 500 000 cells. All the data is formatted in ensight gold (export from star-ccm+).  When I'm exporting a video, at a certain time step, paraview does no longer export images. Consequently from this certain time step, the video is frozen. When I reduce the number of time steps to for example to 500, the problem did not occur. When I do the same thing on a linux machine, the problem does not occur. My PC has 12 GB RAM - so I think, there are no problems with the memory. A similar problem appears when I am plotting a selection over time. At a certain time step, paraview aborts with an error. I get the following message from windows (sorry the message is in german):

Problemsignatur:

  Zusatzinformation 3:                          0523
  Zusatzinformation 4:                         0523f1535bf8c8ee986876df2b6b020c

Again, when I do the same on a linux system, the error does not occur. A similar thing appears when I plot over a line and I want to export the line data over the time with "save data".  Again at a certain time step, paraview stops to export .csv files. When I reduce the number of decimal places (number format), paraview achieves to write more .csv files, but still aborts. I already tried to run paraview as administrator and in the compatibility modus. I also deactivated the windows firewall. None of these actions were successful. I am really grateful for every advice. Thanks.

Kind Regards
Stefan

Stefan,

Have you tried saving animation out as a png? Does that make any
difference? When doing a plot selection over time, how many
cells/points are you selecting?

Subject: [Paraview] How to re-render or update the window through python
	script
Message-ID: <CA+dOOGgptgHbHajqqGFxZUO76bdko_i1F6+ypH0a8TdP=M=72Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using python script to read data files. Render() function is called as
many times as the number of files. I found that after I call render() for
40 or 50 times, the speed of rendering is very slow. Is there a way to
solve it? Instead of calling Render() function several times, is there a
way to update or re-render?

Best wishes,
Junyi Han

it sounds like what happens when one leaks datasets, filters, or other 
vtk objects that hold large amounts of data. Could you share your script?

There was an issue with Python with the nightly Windows binaries last week.
That should be fixed now. Feel free to download the latest nightly binaries
and give them a go.

Thanks

Actually, wait another day since it takes a few days before the nightlies
show up on the download link. Otherwise, try downloading from the dashboard
directly:

Message-ID: <000601cede75$45749050$d05db0f0$@infovalley.net.my>

Hi,

 

 

I believe this predicament is inherited from ParaView as previously
mentioned below:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2013-January/027283.html

 

The volume can be rendered just dandy via pv_web_visualizer.py. It turned
into an 'invisible box' when the switch -ds-host is triggered for remote
rendering. How can I set the threshold in ParaViewWeb? 

 

Another thing is, is it possible to set transfer function opacity under
ParaViewWeb?

 

BTW, the ParaView version is 4.0.1-379-ge8498ed.

 

 

Best Regards,

Den

Hi Den,

I don't remember on the top of my head to to change the remote-rendering
threshold from python but Utkarsh might know.

Regarding your second question, you can certainly do it but you will need
to expose that API via a new protocol and have the JavaScript use it in
some way.

view.RemoteRenderThreshold=0 should do the trick.

Subject: [Paraview] building from source
Message-ID: <CAFr3Oanx8UCuK=s89p_4=sDFCoeZT0ujV18U1xMx5kjG5vMTew@mail.gmail.com>

Hello to the entire community.

I did succefuly build paraview 4.0.1 from source.
However, upon start I briefly see the splash screen and get
"segmentation fault" right after.

I'm using a server (rug) machine with 16CPUs and old ATI card
 (ES1000) very old ATI Rage generation if not mistaken. So I use the
default drivers (open source I guess) coming with vanilla Debian. I
think software rendering is a better in this case?

from what I managed to find it is OpenGL realted.
the recomendation was to disbale Qt from cmake configuration and use
the mesa drivers.
However, this only cause a configuration error using cmake-gui.

I assume messa is the curent default opengl driver( I tried building
them from source but the depenadcies are just countless and I could
resolve all of them under debian :((( )

I run through ssh session from CentOS to the Debian server machine.
(if that has anything to do with it)

Any help in tackling this issue will be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Petar

Subject: [Paraview] Jetty Session Manager deployment and sources
Message-ID: <528242F1.7050101@simscale.de>

Hi all,

At our company we are integrating the new ParaviewWeb module from the
4.0 release of Paraview for simulation and scientific data visualization
and post-processing.


From bogus@does.not.exist.com  Tue Nov  5 09:07:12 2013

Subject: No subject
Message-ID: <mailman.0.1384268914.30620.paraview@paraview.org>

understanding that there currently are two main methods to make use of
ParaviewWeb in a multi-session setting:

-Using the provided Jetty session manager jar.
-Placing an Apache2 web server as a front-end.

Our Use Cases require the use of SSL encryption for the Paraview
sessions, which means that it would not be possible to use only the
session manager. We have tested Apache as a front-end and it works, but
it is not the best solution for us, as we'd rather not have an
additional layer. Besides the session manager looks like a light-weight
alternative.

I would have a few questions:

-Is there currently a modality to integrate the session manager or
ParaviewWeb service into Tomcat with the current realease?

-Is there a link to or would it be possible to have access to the jetty
session manager source code. This would help us considerably, as we
could potentially expand it to use SSL and alter different parameters.

Thanks in advance for your kind replies.

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Subject: [Paraview] Jetty Session Manager - Session time-out and websocket
	message size
Message-ID: <52824DF2.8080804@simscale.de>

Hi All,

While running the Jetty Session Manager for ParaviewWeb the following is
being written to the console output:

oejw.WebSocketConnectionRFC6455:Text message too large > 2097152 chars

Is it possible to specify the maximum websocket text message size
somewhere in a configuration file or as an argument in the command line
when launching the jar file?

The second question refers to the default time-out of 5 minutes for an
idle ParaviewWeb session. Where can one specify what its value should be.

Thanks again for your replies!

Regards,
Bogdan

Hi Bogdan,

The Session manager code is available here:
http://paraview.org/ParaViewSessionManager.git

And you should be able to use the set of servlets/classes directly in
Tomcat.

But remember that our current implementation of the WS forwarding inside
Jetty is not the most robust one. You may want to revisit that piece of
code.
Or maybe Tomcat provide a built-in mechanism to handle WS forwarding.

Hope that helps,

Seb

Some recent push in the session manager should have exposed some options
regarding the timeout configuration.

But regarding the limitation of the web socket payload size, I'm not sure.
I think that you are running into issue here as you may try to share a
directory (--data-dir) that has too big file tree.

I've been working in improving the way we manage file listing to avoid such
limitation issue. But that work is still in progress.

Hello,

I am using Paraview 4.0 version.
I am a newbie and would like to know whether the glyph filter is supported
in ParaviewWeb ?

I am unable to find this filter in ParaviewWeb. If someone could help me
know why this filter is not visible ?

Thanking u in advance

Hi Amrita,

I suppose that you mean inside the Web Visualiser application?
If so, the reason was that I only exposed a subset of filters to the UI,
but this can be easily extended. Although, I haven't tested if the panel
generator was working properly with the glyph filter.

To do that, you can edit the file /.../paraview/web/protocols.py and update
the method listFilters()

Nevertheless as a framework ParaViewWeb as access to any filter or any
capability of ParaView that is available via Python.

Subject: [Paraview] installing pv-meshless plugin for ParaView
Message-ID: <CAKHqD-WT8zKPW0T6N3Sqj7jZ4m_-zh1mG+MAu1vWEzocpxCpCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am interested in using the pv-meshless plugin for ParaView to post
process SPH data. From what I've read it seems the only way to install a
plug-in that is not loaded with ParaView is by building the entire
application from the source code. I am under this impression b/c one of the
parameters that is needed to be passed to CMake when building pv-meshless
is the directory folder "paraview/build" where it looks for other
CMakeLists for the paraview application. The problem is if you install
paraview from the binaries there is no paraview/build directory so CMake
complains. Basically I am not sure how to properly install an unsupported
plug-in for ParaView. My background with software/programming is mostly
limited to Java & Eclipse IDE. I'd like to think it would have been as
simple as downloading a dll file for the plugin and pointing ParaView to
find the correct dll file. But I am guessing ParaView doesn't magically
support plug-ins  besides default ones. I would have thought pv-meshless
would have been a supported plug-in in the recent binary distribution but I
guess it is not. :(

Yesterday I tried building the ParaViewSuperbuild from source  with the
following CMake Enable options (I should point out I'm not really sure what
options to choose, never used CMake before..But I am guessing the following
three components are critical to have a minimally running paraview gui):

ENABLE_paraview
ENABLE_python
ENABLE_qt

I opened the cmake gui from the VS command prompt to auto set correct path
variables for various things. I also opened visual studio as the
administrator. It took maybe 2-3 hrs + to finish compiling. These are the
problems I ran into:


(1) When I open the executable for paraview it failed to find the
python27.lib even though I saw that it was built under:

\Build\python\src\python\PCbuild

I added the path to my PATH environment variable and ParaView started up
fine.

(2) When I try to open the python shell PV crashes. This is tells me some
other executables path  was not set correctly. This is probably an
indication of a bigger problem so I am not sure if I compiled PV correctly.
Any clue why the path variables weren't set correctly?

(3) it also failed to build ParaView under the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
specified directory..

Also if I anyone can direct me to the list where the ENABLE_Components are
described as they relate to ParaView functionality I'd really appreciate
it. Also is it quicker to build from source on a UNIX based machine? It
mentions building QT is time consuming on windows is it substantially
faster on other OS's?

*Info:*
cmake-2.8.8-win32-x86 (just found out it is recommended to use 2.8.9+ )
Visual Studio 2008, 9.0 Professional Edition
OS: Windows 7 64 bit
Accessing ParaView-Superbuild and appropriate downloads via git


Thanks for any help/tips

	4.0?
Message-ID: <CANcsQPfdYjdGorcB50QbBC-MGnfw62sg4StiCvq6ewVEUreZ4A@mail.gmail.com>

Earlier versions of Paraview (3.x) had the extremely useful option to use
the value of any variable as the label for selected points or cells.  That
feature seems to be missing in version 4.0 and newer.  Has this been
removed completely, or is there just a different way of doing that in the
new version?

Thanks,
Ben

Ben,

That hasn't changed in 3.x or 4.0. You go to the "Selection Inspector"
panel to do that. In the upcoming 4.1 there's a new panel that makes
this even easier  -- just FYI.

There is a difference in the behavior after 4.0 in visualizing Exodus
files.  In the old version (3.14.1), the "Label Mode" pull-down list under
the "Point Label" tab in the Selection Inspector contained a full list of
all of the nodal variables that were loaded in, while in the new version
(4.0.1), the only options are PointIDs, GlobalNodeId, and PedigreeNodeId.
 Same deal for cell labels.

the problem. Are you sure you're loading all the variables you're
interested in from the "Properties" panel for the Exodus reader? Do
you have a sample dataset to reproduce this problem?

Yaroslav

I do not support the pv-meshless code any more, there are some branches in the git repo which work with pv4.x but they are all in various stages of experimentation. I am not currently working on particle based simulations so don?t have the time to look after the code. Building paraview from source should be very straightforward (I do not use super build, just standard build using cmake+compiler). The latest pv-meshless code is in the branch openmp but this uses another plugin pv-zoltan which handles the load-balancing (partitioning) for large datasets and that plugin is also in an experimental state (I.e. Not released formally) . The last version of pv-meshless I recall being stable for joe public was tagged for spheric 2012.

Subject: [Paraview] installing pv-meshless plugin for ParaView

Hi All,

I am interested in using the pv-meshless plugin for ParaView to post process SPH data. From what I've read it seems the only way to install a plug-in that is not loaded with ParaView is by building the entire application from the source code. I am under this impression b/c one of the parameters that is needed to be passed to CMake when building pv-meshless is the directory folder "paraview/build" where it looks for other CMakeLists for the paraview application. The problem is if you install paraview from the binaries there is no paraview/build directory so CMake complains. Basically I am not sure how to properly install an unsupported plug-in for ParaView. My background with software/programming is mostly limited to Java & Eclipse IDE. I'd like to think it would have been as simple as downloading a dll file for the plugin and pointing ParaView to find the correct dll file. But I am guessing ParaView doesn't magically support plug-ins  besides default ones. I would have thought pv-meshless would have been a supported plug-in in the recent binary distribution but I guess it is not. :(

Yesterday I tried building the ParaViewSuperbuild from source  with the following CMake Enable options (I should point out I'm not really sure what options to choose, never used CMake before..But I am guessing the following three components are critical to have a minimally running paraview gui):

ENABLE_paraview
ENABLE_python
ENABLE_qt

I opened the cmake gui from the VS command prompt to auto set correct path variables for various things. I also opened visual studio as the administrator. It took maybe 2-3 hrs + to finish compiling. These are the problems I ran into:


(1) When I open the executable for paraview it failed to find the python27.lib even though I saw that it was built under:

\Build\python\src\python\PCbuild

I added the path to my PATH environment variable and ParaView started up fine.

(2) When I try to open the python shell PV crashes. This is tells me some other executables path  was not set correctly. This is probably an indication of a bigger problem so I am not sure if I compiled PV correctly. Any clue why the path variables weren't set correctly?

(3) it also failed to build ParaView under the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX specified directory..

Also if I anyone can direct me to the list where the ENABLE_Components are described as they relate to ParaView functionality I'd really appreciate it. Also is it quicker to build from source on a UNIX based machine? It mentions building QT is time consuming on windows is it substantially faster on other OS's?

Info:
cmake-2.8.8-win32-x86 (just found out it is recommended to use 2.8.9+ )
Visual Studio 2008, 9.0 Professional Edition
OS: Windows 7 64 bit
Accessing ParaView-Superbuild and appropriate downloads via git


Thanks for any help/tips

Yaro

Yes, I'm positive that I've loaded the variables.  I don't know if it makes
any difference, but I'm using a Mac 64 bit executable for both 3.x and 4.x.
 I'll directly send you a small example dataset off the list.  Thanks for
looking into this.

Message-ID: <CAA1+L46sN_hS7xzO8yCB9RWPrp+xkAKeiQZ87-NwS-Q=MrE6VA@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to install paraview using git following the Unix-like
instructions at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Checkout_Development_Version_from_git
.
 All this works fine (although I had to use 'http' protocol to clone):

Prepare directory for download
 # mkdir $HOME/projects
 # cd $HOME/projects

To download the source code
 # git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git ParaView
 # cd ParaView
 # git checkout -b trunk origin/master
 # git submodule init


However, when I try the next step (git update submodules), I see this:

zzz at zzz:~/code/ParaView$ git submodule update
fatal: Needed a single revision
Unable to find current revision in submodule path 'ThirdParty/IceT/vtkicet'

At first I thought it was an access issue, and changed the 'git' protocol
to 'http' in the .gitmodules file, but I still see the same message.

Any help would be appreciated.

Ok, I tried a different approach that seemed to work:

1) I modified my global .gitconfig with lines like this (as per
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Git/Trouble#Firewall_Blocks_Port_9418):

[url "http://paraview.org/ParaView.git"]
insteadOf = git://paraview.org/ParaView.git

[url "http://vtk.org/VTK.git"]
insteadOf = git://vtk.org/VTK.git

[url "http://paraview.org/VisItBridge.git"]
insteadOf = git://paraview.org/VisItBridge.git

[url "http://public.kitware.com/protobuf.git"]
insteadOf = git://public.kitware.com/protobuf.git

[url "http://paraview.org/QtTesting.git"]
insteadOf = git://paraview.org/QtTesting.git

2) and then, ran git clone --recursive git://paraview.org/ParaView.git (as
per http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Git/Download#Clone).

It ultimately failed:
zzz at zzz:~/code$ git clone --recursive git://paraview.org/ParaView.gitparaview4

3) But then I realized that I forgot to put this in the .gitconfig file:

[url "http://paraview.org/IceT.git"]
insteadOf = git://paraview.org/IceT.git

4) Then ran git submodule update and it seemed to work:

Subject: [Paraview] How to tell the pvdataserver where to find pvrenderserver
Message-ID: <CA+dOOGiFLE7TH4H4gTAUvVci_f=ib0eDDOYi_2Qr3+fimcv=oA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to run pvdataserver adn pvrenderserver on different machines. I
have some questions for it.

1. When using client- render server - data server model, client only needs
to connect to render server and it's the render server communicates with
data server. Is that right?

2. By starting up data server, I got:

Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cdsrs://xxxx:11111/<render-server-hostname>:22221
Accepting connection(s): xxxx:11111

It seems data server doesn't know where is the render server, how can I
assign render server to render-server-hostname?
I tried to follow steps shown on Configuring Server Environment Using *.pvx
XML Files<http://paraview.org/Wiki/Configuring_Server_Environment_Using_*.pvx_XML_Files#Related_Pages>,
but I can't find how to tell data server where is the render server.

Thanks for any help!

Best wishes,
Junyi Han

Hi Junyi,

That specific sample application expect a session manager to automatically start a new python process for each visualization. 

If you run an existing web application, you can only load its corresponding web page. 

Hope that make sense,

Seb

Hi Seb,

Thanks very much for your help.
I'm trying to open a vtk file by modifying the sample code. Could you
please help me to understand following code:
pv.connection.session.call("pv:openFileFromPath",
filePath).then(function(reply){pv.viewport.render();});

1. After connecting to a session, methods such as pv:openFileFromPath and
vtk:render can be called. But I don't know where to find those methods, I
only got these two from examples.
2. Where is the session defined? I want to know how does session function
works.

Best wishes,
Junyi Han

Hi Junyi Han,

those methods are defined on the server side using "protocols". To know
which one is available you can look at the file src/Web/Python/protocols.py.

But usually those method are already wrapped into some UI component that
could be directly reused.

All the selection mechanism is not exposed yet. So in order to use it, you
will have to create you own set of protocols (see:
src/Web/Python/protocols.py for examples) and write the appropriate Python
code to perform the selection.
For the key binding (if I understand correctly), you will need to do that
in JavaScript and trigger the appropriate call to your custom protocols
methods in order to perform the requested selection.

To change the view from 2D to 3D, same things. You will need to add a new
protocol and call the right method on the view proxy.

Subject: [Paraview] paraviewweb portability question
Message-ID: <CANOHavEr1kbPi4g8Af8UoWhG9C0hO86PE1gQwwa94bPNYWrRYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm evaluating ParaViewWeb as part of the ParaView 4.0 release and the
4.x nightly Git builds.

The current contents of http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb are a
bit stale as it still mentions pipeline_manager.py (removed in commit
bbb9a40). It took me a while to figure out how to execute the web
visualizer with 4.1-RC1 and the nightlies. For the record this works
for 4.0.1:

 ~$ pvpython paraview/pipeline_manager.py --content www --data-dir
$PARAVIEW_DATA

And this is the syntax past that version:

 ~$ pvpython paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --content www
--data-dir $PARAVIEW_DATA
 ~$ pvpython paraview/web/pv_web_file_loader.py --content www
--data-dir $PARAVIEW_DATA
 ...

I've noticed a few platform differences when trying to display the
can.ex2 data set and from adding, say, sphere geometry.

CentOS6.4
- 4.0.1 displays data set fine
- 4.1-RC1 webapp came up, but did not display data set
- 4.x-64bit-glibc-2.3.6-NIGHTLY-20131113 webapp came up, but did not
display data set
- 4.x-64bit-glibc-2.3.6-NIGHTLY-20131115 webapp came up, but did not
display data set

OSX10.7
- 4.0.1 webapp came up, but did not display data set
- 4.1-RC1 displays data set fine
- 4.x-NIGHTLY-20131113 displays data set fine

Win7
- 4.0.1 webapp UI wedges after "WebVisualizer" link is clicked
- 4.1-RC1 share/paraview-4.1/www is not present
- 4.x-NIGHTLY-20131113 share/paraview-4.*/www is not present

I'm not that interested in Windows (just tried it out of curiosity);
my interest is primarily Linux, then OSX, with the nightly builds.

In the cases where no geometry is displayed I can still interactive
with the view... rotating w/ mouse and observing axis movement. Also I
don't see any stdout/err difference between the versions that work and
the versions that do not. Any pointers on getting it to work?

Thanks,
Josh

Hi,

I can't see the can.ex2 shown on the LiveArticles After clicking on the
viewport, it turns black with a stencil. But WebVisualizer works well.
I'm sure the can.ex2 is under the --data-dir directory.
What did I miss?

Best wishes,

Subject: [Paraview] CMake couldn't find VTKConfig.cmake file (trying to
 install pv-meshless plugin)
Message-ID: <CAKHqD-VMytVUzdQCEJHyJQd7LR-XDzPYMuoOy8GSU1_0L_Zhew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have successfully compiled and installed ParaView on Ubuntu 12.04.
However, now I am trying to install the pv-meshless plugin.  After I
compile ParaView and then try to compile the plugin CMake complains
and can't find the VTKConfig.cmake in the ParaView build folder even
though I can see the VTK directory and the VTKConfig.cmake folder.

Am I correct in thinking that once I point cmake running from the
plugin src directory to the correct Paraview build directory it should
then look at the cmake files there and rebuild what it needs? I am not
sure why it's not finding the VTK folder since I didn't change the
directory structure.

Also in the cmake gui for the plugin I don't see any variables to
specifically set to help it find the VTK cmake file (even when I
toggle). Which I am guessing I shouldn't since this should all be
specified in paraview cmake file.

Error:

 CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:45 (INCLUDE):
   include could not find load file:

     /VTKConfig.cmake

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Yaro

Hi Josh,

thanks for your feedback evaluation.

Sorry for the confusion on the wiki but as you mentioned the text is valid
for the latest release but not consistent with git master.
I'll do a pass to update it.

For the windows package, it is true that we still need to fix the install
tree.
Will do it before the official ParaView release.

Regarding the issue where the data does not load, I'm a bit confused on
what you are exactly doing to load that can.ex2.
Is the issue that when you open the file browser, you can not select the
file or when you click on the file nothing happen?

Seb

Hi Sebastien,

Thank you for the quick response.

To load the can.ex2 data set I'm following http://vimeo.com/77824433
step-for-step. It's when I click on the filename that nothing seems to
happen in the 3D view. Similarly, when I click the + button and add,
say, a sphere nothing seems to happen.

Josh

Do you have a session manager that start automatically the pvpython process
for you?

Hum, this is weird? What browser are you using?

Can you enable the javascript console to see if you notice error?

Thanks,

and no error when you click on the file...
All the current error regarding /paraview is related to the fact that it
tries to request a new process launch using a session manager.
Which you don't have as you run the server application directly.

But I don't see anything related to the file loading issue. And in the
standard output of the pvpython process, you don't see anything?

Thanks,

Seb

Hi, again I feel as if I'm doing something wrong.
In the attached image, shouldn't I be able to change the value from 0 to something else?  In particular, I want to type an "8" in that box and go to the 9th timestep.

If I click the up arrow, it plays every timestep.  If I try to change either the Time or whatever the other 0 is, it just gives me an "error beep."

Rich,
Did you load this data from a state file that was created with a different dataset?  If so, this is a known bug that we are working to replicate.

Sure, can you remind me the bug report url?
And the data can be shared -- it might be too big for you -- each timestep is 3GB

Rich,

A couple of questions:

+ What OsX version is this?
+ Have been able to reproduce the behavior with any other type of dataset,
e.g. can.ex2 from ParaView testing data (
http://paraview.org/files/v4.0/ParaViewData-v4.0.1.tar.gz).

FYI, the first 0 next to the "Time:" is the time value while the second "0"
in the spin-box corresponds to the timestep number.

Folks,

I just posted an introductory blog post on using the new color map
editor panel in the upcoming ParaView 4.1. Give it a read if you have
any questions about this panel. The post just covers the basics. I
plan on a couple more to cover annotations and categorical colors in
the near future. Any feedback to improve the
post/documentation/functionality is, as always, welcome.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualising specific snippet in paraview
Message-ID: <1384741956541.2fa889a4@Nodemailer>

Dear all






I am simulating a 75% filled drum mixer with two coloured particles in 3D. With the help of paraview I can visualise the radial and. Axial segregation as an external viewer of the drum. In addition to this I want to look inside the drum that the cores are forming, how different it is when we look the drum from outside.






In simple words, I may want to turn off visualising for the some part of drum and look at a particle slice. That will help me in the image processing of the snapshot.






I hope you understood the issue. How it is possible in paraview.






Thanks in advance

I am not sure I follow, but take a look at the "Clip" or the "Slice"
filters. Is that what you're looking for?

Subject: [Paraview] copy-paste (or clone/dublicate) a filter
Message-ID: <5289D238.8030605@fmi.fi>

Hi all,

I'd like to copy-paste (or clone/dublicate) a filter in paraview, i.e. 
applying exactly the same filter on two different sources without having 
to redefine the filter. For the moment I'm doing that via 
save-state/load-state and adjusting each time the input file (or via 
"change input" to a filter), but it would be more convenient to be able 
to have the results of the filter applied to the different sources at 
the same time to compare them side by side.
That concerns for example the "clip" or "slice" filter where it would be 
really handy not having to copy by hand the definition of the plane 
used; or when doing a plot with isolines I'd like to have the same line 
"elevations" and drawing options for various input datasets.

According to the various websites and also messages in this mailing 
list, "copy" and "paste" from the menu "edit" or with the 
mouse-left-click should work. However, when I do "paste" nothing happens.
Has anybody experience with that? Is there any other way to do it? Or is 
there any "trick" how to do use the "paste function?

Thanks a lot!

Martina Sch?fer

Message-ID: <CAOkZLxoRRWfCWM4oagexHMijDS2xAiG0amoT62nniDy3iB9Fvg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using Paraviewweb-Linux-64bit-glibc-2.3.6-NIGHTLY and use a custom
class to implement some functions. I can take a trace in standalone
Paraview and copy the Python code into my functions which works well for
several actions.

But I want to be able to make a selection (initially on the surface of my
data volume) in Paraview/Web and then display the labels of the selected
points.

I tried, without success:

 RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

RenderView1.InteractionMode = 'Selection'


active_objects.source.SMProxy.InvokeEvent('UserEvent', 'ShowWidget')



RenderView1.CameraClippingRange = [15652.96264371555, 48851.728930038546]

RenderView1.InteractionMode = '3D'


Render()


How can I enable the selection function in Paraviewweb ?


Many thanks,


k.

Martina,

Regarding your question, I do not do this routinely, but it looks to me 
that if you hold down the Ctrl-key and select two datum two sets and 
then apply the Group Datasets filter you get a single combined datum 
stream to which can apply the same filter to both using a single common 
parameter specification. In a single view, this may require a coordinate 
translation of one datum set with respect to the other in order that 
they are not overlaid (use the Transform filter on one of the datum sets 
before grouping). In addition, it is likely that the point and cell 
variable sets for both objects need to be the same (except for the 
values). Likely some care will be needed for the Slice and Clip filters 
because you will only have a "single" object after grouping.

Hope this helps.

Sam

Hi Sam,

I wasn't aware of the "Group Dataset" Filter, you are right in the case 
of Cliping or Sliceing it's doing sort of the job (eventhough I haven't 
managed to get the translation right), but already for the Isolines or 
PlotOnIntersectionCurve it gets difficult. (And I have actually not only 
one datafile, but around 20 which I would like to produce the same 
figures from and grouping them all together gets a mess!)
Similar to your idea I tried it now with AppendAttributes, that still 
leaves the work of copy-ing by hand (at least I do not know how to do 
that otherwise) the variables them I'm interested from each dataset to 
another name, i.e. velocity -> velocity-dataset1, velocity -> 
velocity-dataset2 and so on beforehand, but then I can use Clips or 
Slices in one figure for each of the datasets. But since I then have 
different variable names, it does again not work for the Isocontours... 
PlotOnIntersectionCurves however seems to be doing ok.
It also would mean to apply AppendAttributes to around 20files, I'm not 
quite sure if that's a good way to go.

I'd be happy about any other ideas! What is the "copy" function supposed 
to do anyhow? After all this menu-item exists when I do 
right-mouse-click on a filter?

Martina,

Given that you have 20+/- datum sets (and one geometry?), you might be 
able to construct a pseudo time sequence by labeling the files:

myjob001.vtu, myjob002.vtu, myjob003.vtu, ...

(Note. The file-ending "*.vtu" refers to an XML-formatted datum set)

ParaView will assume they are a time-sequence and you can use the 
animation to perform the identical display processing on each image, 
When you are satisfied with the results, save the animation as *.pgn 
images; you will get one frame in each datum set.

If you already have a naming convention for the *.vtu files that you 
want to keep, then you can use a *.pvd meta-file to specify the 
pseudo-time sequence, see the attached *.pvd file as an example. (The 
part-tag allows sub-datum-sets; in my case there are different 
materials. The name-tag is currently a do-nothing; it is not required.)

Hi Seb,

I tried to make the file_loader module can push new data to clients. But I
always get an error like:
exceptions.AttributeError: _FileOpener instance has no attribute
'pubHandlers'. Do you have any ideas about this?

thanks!

the other way around is to create a custom filter to group all your filter into one and expose only the desired properties.

Hey - maybe I'll get a response this time, because the last time I sent something, I didn't!

I am new to ParaView. I have loaded a .vtk file and state file, and someone was helping me with Paraveiw by editing the properties in the Pipeline Browser.

How can I save all the information I see in Paraview?

File/ Save State?  Is this what you mean?  Then, File/ Load State?

Also, although many of the good folks on this list volunteer their time and knowledge,  sometimes they/we get busy with work and life, and miss an e-mail.  If you don't get an answer, just ping the list again.

No Alan (and thanks for the reply btw). But then again I'm a noob at ParaView, so go easy on me.

So, I loaded in a .vtk file from a program a ran, in combination with a state file that was given to me. That resulted in an awesome image.

However, the person who provided me with the state file also edited the rendered image. And since I'm new at all this, I was wondering if there was an option to not only save the image as a file, but also all of the parameters he edited in Properties.

Would this be considered a state file?

Thanks!
Jesse

Jesse,

I think a state file is the closest thing to what you are asking for. As you observed, it captures all of the readers and objects you are using along with all the parameters so that you can recreate them.

What Ken said.  :-)

If you want to only save the image (which you don't), that is another command file/ save screenshot.  To save a movie, file/ save animation.

Subject: [Paraview] x3d geometry export garbled?
Message-ID: <76FE9F3BFF0B1B4A9EFDA35095CBA32C18E413AA@PRDEXMBX-07.the-lab.llnl.gov>

Hi,
I have been trying to get paraview to play nice with blender.  Specifically, I'd like to export an x3d file which blender will draw nicely.
I was able to do so from a dataset when reading the data locally, but to do so requires some awful contortions.  I have to export the data first from VisIt as a set of VTK files, then read those in with paraview, then export as x3d, so blender imports them as a set of objects, and it is difficult to color all those pieces in blender.  So I'd like to have a more direct way to do this.
What happens in parallel is that if I "Export Scene" of a contour that looks like this in paraview:
[cid:FB539EBB-675C-4338-B214-3752ABFBE96A at llnl.gov]


The resulting x3d object displays like this in blender:


[cid:4F3D56D0-1FF0-43D3-9998-55AB8328CEA4 at llnl.gov]

I believe that this means that Paraview is exporting the data out of order.  But there may be ambiguity in some specification.  Can someone help with this?
Thanks!

Rich,
The vast majority of the ParaView team is crazy busy at SC.  I.e. if you don?t get an answer by next week, ping again.

OK, thinking out loud here ? you are contouring by the density at the points (nodes), but coloring by a subtly different variable ? density at the cells (elements).  Since you should have it available (coming out of the cell to point filter), how about coloring by point density?  (You can tell by the cute cube in front of the density variable ? points look like ... um ... points.)  That?s the only thing I can think of...

the attached is an image I made by creating a contour of the density variable resulting from the CellDatatoPointData filter on some Miranda data.  I colored by density.  Shouldn't it all be one color?

When I did this for myself in my recent exploration my recollection is it's no help.
However, I did discover this:

exporters=servermanager.createModule("exporters")
view = GetActiveView()

for ts in range(12):
    print "rendering timestep", ts
    sys.stdout.flush()
    RenderView2.ViewTime = 10.0 * ts
    x3dExporter=exporters.X3DExporter(FileName="/Users/cook47/Desktop/foo%03d.x3d"%ts)
    x3dExporter.SetView(RenderView2) # <===== NEW LINE
    x3dExporter.Write()

RenderView2.RemoteRenderThreshold = 2.0

I got it off some old mailing list or something -- it works.  For x3d.  YMMV

I just tried the directions I gave below, and this command is not correctly written using the Trace Recorder.  This is a bug.  Would you mind writing it up, or should I?

I don?t know the answer to your question, hopefully someone else on the list can help.

Please keep replies on the paraview list, so everyone can learn and participate.

 I mean the Python's language command in the Python Shell.

I need a command, a similar call certain functions from the File -> Save Geometry

.

Although I am not sure the command you want, let me tell you  how to find it.



Run ParaView.

Tools/ Start Trace



Save some geometry (I assume you mean File/ Save Data)



Tools/ Stop Trace.



If that doesn?t work, we have a bug in ParaView.  Please report it.



Thanks,

I did notice that.  It does not allow me to color by point density.  I don't think the values really vary by that much near the isosurface, but I might be wrong.

I believe Alan is right. The cell to point operation performs something of a low pass filtering of the data, meaning that extrema get smoothed out. It is entirely possible that is happening here.

It is strange that you cannot color by the point density. I would expect that to be output by the filter.

OK, thinking out loud here ? you are contouring by the density at the points (nodes), but coloring by a subtly different variable ? density at the cells (elements).  Since you should have it available (coming out of the cell to point filter), how about coloring by point density?

If your data has time, save animation will save out a movie file or sequence of movie frames. Save screenshot will save just one image.

Hi, sorry it's 10.8.5
Did not understand your second + sign.  Did you mean "Have not"?

Rich,

A couple of questions:

+ What OsX version is this?
+ Have been able to reproduce the behavior with any other type of dataset, e.g. can.ex2 from ParaView testing data (http://paraview.org/files/v4.0/ParaViewData-v4.0.1.tar.gz).

FYI, the first 0 next to the "Time:" is the time value while the second "0" in the spin-box corresponds to the timestep number.

Did you load this data from a state file that was created with a different dataset?  If so, this is a known bug that we are working to replicate.

Hi, again I feel as if I'm doing something wrong.
In the attached image, shouldn't I be able to change the value from 0 to something else?  In particular, I want to type an "8" in that box and go to the 9th timestep.

If I click the up arrow, it plays every timestep.  If I try to change either the Time or whatever the other 0 is, it just gives me an "error beep."

Ken/Rich,
This is actually expected behavior that I have noticed before.  If we contoured on a variable, that variable is now a constant for this surface.  Thus, it is useless.  I don?t know if we still should pass it on, but we don?t.

I believe Alan is right. The cell to point operation performs something of a low pass filtering of the data, meaning that extrema get smoothed out. It is entirely possible that is happening here.

It is strange that you cannot color by the point density. I would expect that to be output by the filter.

I disagree -- it seems to me that it would be very good to have the correct color applied to the isosurface using the color map for the variable being used.  This can provide information in a scene that is relevant and important.  Having to manually choose a "constant color" does not make sense to me.  Should it be purple?  Grey?  Arbitrary and misleading.

I have looked closer at the image.  What first looks like the tiles are out of order is not the case.  What I believe is actually happening is that a different color map is being applied to each tile.  So the problem is in the "colors" section of the x3d file.  You can see this by looking at the patterns across the "tile" boundaries in the attached image.  The patterns are continuous but there is a discontinuity in the colors being applied.  For example, the green square in the image surrounds 9 tiles which share such a pattern in the image, kind of shaped like an ameoba.
I suspect that the part of the paraview code which assigns colors is not savvy about the idea that there are 16 processors and so is using a local coloring scheme.

Hi,
I have been trying to get paraview to play nice with blender.  Specifically, I'd like to export an x3d file which blender will draw nicely.
I was able to do so from a dataset when reading the data locally, but to do so requires some awful contortions.  I have to export the data first from VisIt as a set of VTK files, then read those in with paraview, then export as x3d, so blender imports them as a set of objects, and it is difficult to color all those pieces in blender.  So I'd like to have a more direct way to do this.
What happens in parallel is that if I "Export Scene" of a contour that looks like this in paraview:
<ParaViewScreenSnapz003 copy.jpg>


The resulting x3d object displays like this in blender:


<BlenderScreenSnapz001 copy.jpg>

I believe that this means that Paraview is exporting the data out of order.  But there may be ambiguity in some specification.  Can someone help with this?
Thanks!

then i build the ALL_BUILD


Should i get 0 errors in order to paraview work properly?

The executables will be under the build directory in the bin folder?

No need to click advanced, it is the Compute Scalars control you want.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkbool: Plugin for boolean operations of vtkPolyData
Message-ID: <CAPK9r69RuYC1c4MPP_H0FBDQFmhc6EiSTUf_ZwbktKRfJnU-Vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to draw attention to my development of a filter to perform
boolean operations on meshes of type vtkPolyData. The filter doesn't need
any libraries other than VTK itself and has, besides the primary and most
obviously goal, two secondary goals. Firstly the filter should not use
triangulation to work and secondly should handle concruent polygons in the
right way. I started developing the filter in a time before VTK gots a
filter with a functionality like that. After a long break I decided to
continue my work because the added filter works in a different manner and
has some weaknesses. Here is the link to the project on GitHub:

https://github.com/zippy84/vtkbool

I tested the filter in-depth, but I am sure that real examples are able to
afford not known cases. Test it with your applicational data and let me
know if it is so or not. Report your bugs on the named website (not here)
and I will look to solve the new issues in a short time. Don't forget to
attach your examples with coordinates in the position of the operation or
just the original meshes with the used transformation matrices. Patches are
also welcome.

All features and limitations are listed on the Readme at GitHub.

Best regards.

FYI, the first 0 next to the "Time:" is the time value while the second "0" in the spin-box corresponds to the timestep number.

Hi Rich,

when you interact with the 3d view and you get back to the time spinner.
Can you change the time?
To me I've seen some issue with Qt where I was not able to edit any
property unless I was interacting with the 3D view first.

Hello Utkarsh,

Nice blog! Although I have been using Paraview for a while now, it is still
very interesting to read. I am looking forward to a follow-up. In
particular,
I am looking forward to the annotation (custom labels) part. This is highly
usefull for the work that I do.

Subject: [Paraview] Spherical texture map bug
Message-ID: <528CC3A0.3020702@dlr.de>

Hi,
just discovered a bug if I apply a texture map to sphere on a sphere 
(from source). The last theta and phi segments seem to get the entire 
map again crammed into that segment. If you increase the resolution of 
the sphere an ugly streak remains. The option avoid smear produces two 
mirrored sections that are not usable.

All the best,
Christian

Message-ID: <CAMFgkwfjLtxn2xnehVfBcz4nFzs2aO7y-pQTc=jKw3TmSRStzA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on a vtk dataset and i'm using particle tracer to visualize
particle motion.
I'd like to ask you about the numeral method used by this filter to trace
the particle path through the field.
Does the filter use fourth order Runge-Kutta method?
The time step (delta_t) associated to the numerical method is the reader
time?

Thanks in advance

Enrico

Dear all,

thanks for your input to my question about dublicating filter.
I'm still a bit puzzled that sth what I'd need on a daily basis and seem 
so simply to me, doesn't really exist :-).

Does anyone understand what these
http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/309655-add-copy-and-paste-properties-or-clone-filter-
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.science.paraview.user/14764
posts are about? Do they understand sth different from dublicating a 
filter than me?

Sorry, maybe my messages are a bit confusing - I was looking for this 
cloneing filter not only for one single special purpose, but I'm really 
missing it on a daily basis for various applications and I am (or was at 
least) so ambitious to look for one solution that solves all of these 
applications, but probably I should give that up and deal with 
case-to-case solutions, which you gave me already quite some hints for!
With the "artifical" time-series (thanks Sam) and custom filters (thanks 
Felipe) I should be able to solve most of my issues!

Martina


@Sam:
That's a great idea for producing a lot of identical plots, thanks! The 
only thing that would go missing then with respect to my current plots 
is some text, which I had adjusted for each dataset, sort of like a 
title. (I haven't yet checked your pvd file since it was not attached to 
the email for and I haven't yet figured out how to get it, so maybe 
there is a solution for that in the pvd file which I ignore for the moment.)
Still, it doesn't satisfy me completely for other purposes, for example 
when just wanting to apply quickly the same clip to 2 or 3 datasets and 
comparing them side-by-side.

Thanks Felipe, I had been trying that earlier, but somehow I never 
managed to create custom filters. Now I tried again and it seemed to 
work at least for simple things like Thresholds or Clips. I have to test 
further how it'll be in my more complexer filter-chains.

Ugh, I cannot even reproduce it now.  I can type into the timestep field all day long no matter what I do.  For the past few days, I repeatedly could not.  Apparently I'm taking a different workflow or something now.  It's raining, maybe that is helping.  :-|  Sheesh.

FYI, the first 0 next to the "Time:" is the time value while the second "0" in the spin-box corresponds to the timestep number.

You're right, with Compute Scalars checked, ParaView gives me the option to color by the variable I created the contour with.

Ken/Rich,
This is actually expected behavior that I have noticed before.  If we contoured on a variable, that variable is now a constant for this surface.  Thus, it is useless.  I don?t know if we still should pass it on, but we don?t.

I believe Alan is right. The cell to point operation performs something of a low pass filtering of the data, meaning that extrema get smoothed out. It is entirely possible that is happening here.

It is strange that you cannot color by the point density. I would expect that to be output by the filter.

The vast majority of the ParaView team is crazy busy at SC.  I.e. if you don?t get an answer by next week, ping again.

OK, thinking out loud here ? you are contouring by the density at the points (nodes), but coloring by a subtly different variable ? density at the cells (elements).  Since you should have it available (coming out of the cell to point filter), how about coloring by point density?  (You can tell by the cute cube in front of the density variable ? points look like ... um ... points.)  That?s the only thing I can think of...

the attached is an image I made by creating a contour of the density variable resulting from the CellDatatoPointData filter on some Miranda data.  I colored by density.  Shouldn't it all be one color?

Subject: [Paraview] x3d geometry export garbled?

I have discovered that this is connected with the Miranda reader.  I believe the actual culprit is the "Cell Data to Point Data" filter.  In that step, somehow the x3d exporter fumbles somewhere.  Just a theory.  Without any developer feedback, I'm going to just make stuff up.  :-)
When I export the geometry from my scene and then re-import it, then save the scene to x3d, the colors are properly preserved and blender can deal with it.
I now have a path forward.  It's ugly, but if I can put it into a script once then fuggetaboutit it's done.  That's a pretty big "if" but I think
Thanks for listening to my podcast folks!  I'm here each week.

Summary:

1.  First create the desired contours in Paraview using parallel rendering.  How to:
    A.  Open the plot.mir file in ParaView after connecting in parallel.
    B.  Enable the variables you want to have available to contour and color by; click Apply
    C.  Since paraview views Miranda data as being zonal, to create a contour of Miranda data, you have to first apply the "Cell Data to Point Data" filter.   Enable "Pass Cell Data" to allow the next step to color by nodal values, which looks better than zonal, given the contour is nodal.   click Apply
    D.  Apply a Contour filter by clicking the onion shell in the toolbar or with Filters->Contour.  Click "Compute Scalars".  Click Apply.  You can now change the Coloring to be by another variable.

2.  Choose File --> "Save Geometry".  This will save all timesteps, so be patient.

3.  Import the saved geometry again and then export each timestep as an x3d file.  With many timesteps, you might want to script the tedious part.

I have looked closer at the image.  What first looks like the tiles are out of order is not the case.  What I believe is actually happening is that a different color map is being applied to each tile.  So the problem is in the "colors" section of the x3d file.  You can see this by looking at the patterns across the "tile" boundaries in the attached image.  The patterns are continuous but there is a discontinuity in the colors being applied.  For example, the green square in the image surrounds 9 tiles which share such a pattern in the image, kind of shaped like an ameoba.
I suspect that the part of the paraview code which assigns colors is not savvy about the idea that there are 16 processors and so is using a local coloring scheme.

Hi,
I have been trying to get paraview to play nice with blender.  Specifically, I'd like to export an x3d file which blender will draw nicely.
I was able to do so from a dataset when reading the data locally, but to do so requires some awful contortions.  I have to export the data first from VisIt as a set of VTK files, then read those in with paraview, then export as x3d, so blender imports them as a set of objects, and it is difficult to color all those pieces in blender.  So I'd like to have a more direct way to do this.
What happens in parallel is that if I "Export Scene" of a contour that looks like this in paraview:
<ParaViewScreenSnapz003 copy.jpg>


The resulting x3d object displays like this in blender:


<BlenderScreenSnapz001 copy.jpg>

I believe that this means that Paraview is exporting the data out of order.  But there may be ambiguity in some specification.  Can someone help with this?
Thanks!

Hi Martina,

I had the same question myself. Now, I have just tried "copy" and 
"paste", and found out, that it obviously copies and pastes all the 
properties of the filter, and you can paste these into a filter of the 
same kind. So you create, e.g., Clip1 with all the settings you need, 
and copy its properties (right-click + copy). Then you create Clip2, and 
paste the properties into Clip2 (right-click + paste). I think, the 
important thing is to understand, that you do not copy the filter, but 
only its properties. At least, that is what is looks like to me.

I hope that helps.
Kind regards
Ian

Hi Ian,

great, that's a good point and now I understand better the exact 
formulation of the other posts that I had read in the web. I was just 
doing copy and paste without creating beforehand a new filter to paste into.
However, now I'm ending up with the seg.faults that others have also 
described (and as I see without reporting solutions to it).
Which version of paraview did you try since it worked for you apparently 
without seg.fault? I tried 3.14 and 4.0.

Thanks,
Martina

Hi Shiyuan,

The scalar bar label is taken from the name of the array in the "Coloring"
property. By renaming the array to a string containing tex markup (such as
"$\pi^2$") you can get special characters, superscripts, etc.

There might be an easier way to do this, but arrays can be renamed with the
Calculator filter:

1) Add a calculator filter
2) Set "Attribute Mode" to Point Data or Cell Data
3) Select the input array using the "Scalars" or "Vectors" pulldown menus
4) Set the "Result Array Name" to the tex string
5) Change the "Coloring" array to the new array

Hope this helps,
Dave

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb4 Jetty Session manager - Out of memory error
Message-ID: <528E3A55.3050008@simscale.de>

Hello all,

Thanks for the useful answers to my previous questions.

I am encountering a problem with the Jetty Session Manager and the fact
that the java process runs out of memory, under what could be a memory leak.

1. Description:
* The Problem: The (java) Jetty session manager runs out of memory after
establishing multiple sessions either sequentially or simultaneously.
For example the error could manifest itself after 30 paraview sessions
being started and terminated. The stacktrace appended at the end of the
e-mail:

* Repeatability: always. It happens much sooner on jvms on 32-bit
machines than on 64-bit ones.

* My changes to the Session Manager: In
SessionManager/src/main/java/com/kitware/paraviewweb/external/SimpleWebSocketProxyManager.java:

DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE -> From 2 to 4 MB (Increased the websocket
message size)
DEFAULT_FACTORY_BUFFER_SIZE -> From 1 to 2 MB

* session manager started with:
java -jar SessionManager.jar default-config.properties

Using the -Xms and -Xmx options to increase allocated memory when
launching the process only delays the final error for a little longer,
as sooner or later it shows up.

2. Questions
-Do you perhaps know how this issue could be addressed, or any advice on
how to mitigate it and where to look for a possible memory leak?

-From your experience with the current implementation of the Session
Manager, what would be the current practical limit on the number of
concurrent (I have specified a maximum of 80 in the config file) and
sequential sessions?

3. Error Stacktrace

Hi Rich,

I think that the save geometry option saves the last data that's passed 
into the rendering portion of the pipeline, it's typically a surface but 
depends on which representation you're using. Most of the time you can 
mimic the functionality  by applying the extract surface filter and 
writing the result. For example:

ws = Wavelet()
es = ExtractSurface()
sw = CreateWriter('wavesurf.vtp')
sw.UpdatePipeline()

Does that work for your situation?

Hi Martina,

obviously, the error does not depend on the version of ParaView (I have 
3.14.1 and 3.98.0), but on the filter. My first try was with the 
WarpByVector filter, because I had it in the first file I opened, and it 
worked. With the Clip filter, I get the error, too.

Maybe, there is an error report or a plan to fix it (maybe someone on 
the list knows about it??).
I'm sorry, that I can't help you more.

Kind regards
Ian

Subject: [Paraview] About visualizing vtk files in Paraview to show data
 changes maybe with two layers?
Message-ID: <CA+O2AoNDa5N7cyze1QejxqAdXUONF3fEx3ybgBXe8frSKpx+dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to visualize some vtk files which are generally a series of
values of wave and sea level of some area. Now I can just save an animation
to show some movies of frame1,2,3,....
However, it is not clear for some regions that the values there are
changed. For example, when the wave goes to land, the value for the land
increases from saying 5m to 6m, so there is 1m flood however which is not
easy to see such small difference especially the change is even smaller
saying 0.2 m..
What I am thinking is to 1) keep the first frame which is the initial value
for the area as one layer or background with some color scheme; then 2)
based on the background from 1), difference between the values at step i
(i=2,3,...) and the initial value (step 0, background) are shown with
another color scheme, so both the initial image for the area and the
changes afterwards can be shown clearly.

But I am really not expert in such visualizing work or Paraview, so I come
here and ask for help. Anyone knows that if I can do such complicated work
in Paraview and how? Thank you all for attention!

Cheers,
Xiao Guo

Hi,
I finally got the process together to write isosurfaces to read into blender.  there is one glitch remaining, and it's tantalizing to try to fix it.  In paraview, the contour looks like this:
[cid:B50194C6-EC06-45F1-8ECA-D75D125E671D at llnl.gov]

In blender, the result looks like this:

[cid:9029DA75-0349-4A21-8411-C45D660BC324 at llnl.gov]

I've confirmed the difference is in the values being written to the x3d file.  The aspect ratio is different too.  The z axis is squashed by a factor of about 4, so the surface is not as wrinkly.
How can I debug this?
Thanks

Hi Utkarsh,

I used it the other day when updating the projected tetrahedra ctest. 
This is a big improvement,I love it!

I noticed that the ranges are lost when changing LUT's. For example 
create a wavelet source and change the LUT (I used Rainbow Desaturated). 
If I open the "rescale to custom range" dialog, range show -1 to 1.  I 
have to hit "rescale to data range" button to get it to update. Custom 
ranges are also lost during LUT changes, those are more annoying.

The issue is related to the web socket proxy section which was there to
show the feasibility not the robustness.
For that you rather use apache 2.4+.

Rich,

Try this: in the properties panel search for "interpolate scalar before
mapping" and uncheck that. Now export. Does that make any difference in the
color?

I am not sure what could be the matter with the aspect ratio. I'll give it
a test once I get back to the office -- at SC this week.

I don't see any such option.  I'm attaching a screen shot of all the contour properties.  I also don't see that in the Preferences anywhere.

Rich,

Try this: in the properties panel search for "interpolate scalar before mapping" and uncheck that. Now export. Does that make any difference in the color?

I am not sure what could be the matter with the aspect ratio. I'll give it a test once I get back to the office -- at SC this week.

Sounds good.
If I can get x3d to write out a reasonable set of color values, I'll try this.
Thanks

Hi Rich,

I think that the save geometry option saves the last data that's passed into the rendering portion of the pipeline, it's typically a surface but depends on which representation you're using. Most of the time you can mimic the functionality  by applying the extract surface filter and writing the result. For example:

ws = Wavelet()
es = ExtractSurface()
sw = CreateWriter('wavesurf.vtp')
sw.UpdatePipeline()

Does that work for your situation?

Subject: [Paraview] neglect zeros in data range
Message-ID: <528EF823.50002@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a data set from celldatatopointdata which contains a lot of zeros 
in the higher order nodes. I want to neglect these zero values in color 
map and hope the displayed data range is bounded by valid min and max 
values (all positive here after deleting these zeros). How to do this 
without manually finding the minimum positive data?

Message-ID: <76FE9F3BFF0B1B4A9EFDA35095CBA32C18E46259@PRDEXMBX-07.the-lab.llnl.gov>

Hi,
I have a dataset that shows cracks when I make an isosurface, because it's in multiple domains and paraview doesn't know how to do ghost zones with it.
In VisIt, I can solve this by resampling onto a grid which is the same size as my input object.  This new grid gets the proper ghost zones and solves the problem.
In ParaView, can I do the same thing?  Here is a picture of what I'm talking about.  You can see the cracks where the processor data boundaries are; one per processor.  This is a fault with the data reader (which I maintain), but I'm hoping I can solve it with the GUI.

Hi!

Try ResampleWithDataset filter. Its input is your data and mesh on which
you want to resample your data.

The main issue starts with the fact that for multiple processes that when
you use the cell data to point data you're not getting a continuous value
across processes. The cell data to point data filter has an "Piece
Invariant" option which you should check so that it uses ghost cells to
compute the point data and thus you should get continuous point data values
between processes. Then the contour should work as you want it to.

I tried that but what mesh can I resample onto?  I don't have a big mesh laying around without cracks in it.  Can I create one using the Sources menu?

Hi!

Try ResampleWithDataset filter. Its input is your data and mesh on which
you want to resample your data.

Subject: [Paraview] Coordinates range
Message-ID: <5290B6B9.1060708@ann.jussieu.fr>

Dear all
My 3D data is defined in a  VTK  "DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS". The 
coordinates ranges are several order of magnitude apart, for instance x 
from 0 to 200 and y, z from 0 to 1.
I would like the display to fill the image on all directions (direction 
wise scaling) but at the same time to retain the true coordinates, for 
subsequent operations like Slice or ProbeLocation.
I have tried without success different combinations of "SPACING" and 
also to redefine axes CustomRange and CustomBounds. I am sure mine is a 
common  problem. Thank you in advance for your solutions
Best regards
Marie

Burlen, I am not sure I can reproduce this. Are you just missing
clicking the "Update" button after changing the range? Note there's an
"auto-update" button too, which is not pressed by default.

Message-ID: <CA+dOOGgT1=6No+fcsOqReb_yszOwhi_9aGkQfxC32scx2nU6yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I tried to use the file_loader to open up a file on a remote pvserver. As
mentioned here<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.web.pv_web_file_loader.html>,
some arguments such as --ds-host and --ds-port are supposed to point to the
remote server. But it seems the file_loader.py in paraview4.0.1 doesn't
take them as arguments. Is there another way to do that?

Best wishes,
Junyi Han

Yes, you can indeed write a client-side plugin that updates the active
opacity transfer function. Your plugin can monitor pqActiveObjects
singleton to get access to the active representation and from that you
can access it's ScalarOpacityFunction. Look at pqColorMapEditor and
pqColorOpacityEditorWidget in ParaView 4.1.0 source to see how that
could be done.

Hi Junyi Han,

You are right but you can use the pv_web_visualizer.py instead.

Subject: [Paraview] How to set the address of pvserver for the
 web.pv_web_file_loader module

Thanks Seb,

I'm using 4.0, so I think the pv_web_visualizer should be something like
pipeline_manager.py, right?
I need to modify the function about loading files and I can understand most
of codes in file_loader.py. But it seems the pipeline_manager package all
functions into protocols.
Can I just add simple.Connect() to somewhere in the file_loader.py to make
it connect to a particular pvserver? Or can you help me to locate which
remote procedure is called when open a file in the WebVisualizer
application.

Appreciate for your help!

There indeed is an easier way to do this. You can directly change the
label used for the color scalar bar without having to change the array
name. Refer to the following blog post on how to edit the Color Legend
parameters:

http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/578

There you can enter the mathtext as Dave suggested in the "Title" field.

This is indeed the recommended way for changing color legend titles. I
would not use the calculator as that would unnecessarily result in
duplicating of the data array.

Rich,

As Berk mentioned in another email, several members of the ParaView
development team were at SuperComputing last week. Since there are
several emails floating around about X3D, and I am not a very good
summarizer of emails, I am not sure where things stand, so let's start
at the start.

I've attached a simple X3D output generated from the attached ParaView
state file (for ParaView 4.1.0-RC1). I don't have much experience with
Blender and hence haven't been able to show the result as expected in
Blender. But if you don't mind, can you try loading the X3D file to
see if it renders as expected (ParaView rendered image attached)? It's
a very simple geometry with 5 points colored with 5 different colors.
Let's try to see if the exported X3D file is bad in the first place.
Just looking at the file, the contents seem reasonable to me.

Are you fellows absolutely certain you are exporting x3d files correctly?
When I open them in blender, they get colored wrong.  I'm trying to figure out if this is a problem in blender or in paraview, but am not sure where to start.
Here is an image of the color attribute textured onto a slice plane as exported in x3d from paraview.

Message-ID: <76FE9F3BFF0B1B4A9EFDA35095CBA32C18E4136C@PRDEXMBX-07.the-lab.llnl.gov>

Hi,
I have been trying to get paraview to play nice with blender.  Specifically, I'd like to export an x3d file which blender will draw nicely.
I was able to do so from a dataset when reading the data locally, but to do so requires some awful contortions.  I have to export the data first from VisIt as a set of VTK files, then read those in with paraview, then export as x3d, so blender imports them as a set of objects, and it is difficult to color all those pieces in blender.  So I'd like to have a more direct way to do this.
What happens in parallel is that if I "Export Scene" of a contour that looks like this in paraview:
[cid:59407FF3-5409-4450-9870-1F8A3134D3FB at llnl.gov]


The resulting x3d object displays like this in blender:

[cid:93F94BA2-FA18-44B3-B8C6-3186FD66C189 at llnl.gov]


I believe that this means that Paraview is exporting the data out of order.  But there may be ambiguity in some specification.  Can someone help with this?
Thanks!

> I don't see any such option.  I'm attaching a screen shot of all the contour properties.  I also don't see that in the Preferences anywhere.

Rich, the properties panels provides a "search box" on the top of the
panel. It's generally easy to simply use that to find the properties.
The panel has a "advanced" view and a "default" view and hence not all
available properties are shown in the panel. However, if you search,
all properties are searched irrespective of whether the panel is in
advanced or simple view. So just type  "interpolate " in the "Search"
box and you'll see the attached image:

For more details on the design on the properties panel, here's a post:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491

I tried to reproduce the issue using a wavelet source instead, but my
blender skills are limited and I can't seem to get any color rendered.
I'll wait till I get your response about what happens for you with the
simple sphere case to continue.

Rich,

It has been several years since we looked at the X3D exporting code, so
it's possible there are issues with it. There are a few users that I know
of that use X3D from ParaView, since we haven't heard any complains, we
assumed it should be doing the right thing especially for the basic stuff.

OsX and Qt can be funny at times. We'll try to see if we can reproduce
this one our side too. Feel free to ping me if can reproduce this
again.

FYI, we're planning on updating to latest Qt (5+) next release (not
the upcoming 4.1, but the one after that). Hopefully that should help
iron out some of these kinks.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks a lot for these nice and instructive blog posts. This is a very
useful capability for me.

As a side note, an additional nice feature would be, to create an exploded
view in Paraview
based on the values corresponding to the categorical color maps. Something
like
the shrink filter, but than not by cell, but by group of cells. This is a
very useful
feature for visualization of large mechanical assemblies (like aerospace
structures).
Is this possible, and if not, would it be difficult to implement. I would
like to give it
a shot and contribute the code if it works properly. (I just checked out the
paraview/vtk course list and I am considering enlisting for them. So an
writing an
explode filter for grouped cells might be a nice excersise :) ).

Thanks again and looking forward to other blog posts from Kitware!

Marco

Subject: [Paraview] [paraview]visualizing vtk files in Paraview to show data
 changes maybe with two layers?
Message-ID: <CA+O2AoM4BKsBiStowwOyB4qUDw4oeL6Td632dT1xMOEK9Ub8YQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Sorry for sending again if you received this already,, but I did not
receive it .. it may fail to be sent..

I am trying to visualize some vtk files which are generally a series of
values of wave and sea level of some area. Now I can just save an animation
to show some movies of frame1,2,3,....
However, it is not clear for some regions that the values there are
changed. For example, when the wave goes to land, the value for the land
increases from saying 5m to 6m, so there is 1m flood however which is not
easy to see such small difference especially the change is even smaller
saying 0.2 m..
What I am thinking is to 1) keep the first frame which is the initial value
for the area as one layer or background with some color scheme; then 2)
based on the background from 1), difference between the values at step i
(i=2,3,...) and the initial value (step 0, background) are shown with
another color scheme, so both the initial image for the area and the
changes afterwards can be shown clearly.

But I am really not expert in such visualizing work or Paraview, so I come
here and ask for help. Anyone knows that if I can do such complicated work
in Paraview and how? Thank you all for attention!

Cheers,
Xiao Guo

I don't think so.
If you color by the point aligned density it should be all one color.
Coloring by cell aligned density will show variation due to the averaging
used to create values on the points.
Show surfaces with edges mode, zoom in, and try selection labeling to see
the variation on a small patch.

I'm not surprised piece invariant doesn't solve the problem. Almost
all filters that could use ghost cells to overcome such a problem will
not work since all rely on the reader providing the ghost cells which
you said yours didn't. What is the output type for the dataset from
plot.mir reader? You can use D3 on unstructured datasets to generate
ghost cells -- but that's expensive since it also redistributes the
data. George is currently developing a filter that will simply
generate/communicate ghost cells without redistributing the data.
George, would your filter help in this case, or do I remember  things
incorrectly?

To: "vtkusers at vtk.org" <vtkusers at vtk.org>


All,

In an effort to spark some comments I thought I'd try to provide a small
example for what I want to do in case my previous post (below) was unclear.
 Below is a valid xdmf file that paraview understands for a plane.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd">
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">
  <Domain>
    <Grid GridType="Uniform">
      <Topology TopologyType="Quadrilateral" Dimensions="1">
        <DataItem Dimensions="1 4" NumberType="Int" Precision="8"
Format="XML">
           0 1 3 2
</DataItem>
      </Topology>
      <Geometry GeometryType="XYZ">
        <DataItem Dimensions="4 3" NumberType="Float" Precision="4"
Format="XML">
  -0.5 -0.5 0
  0.5 -0.5 0
  -0.5 0.5 0
  0.5 0.5 0
</DataItem>
      </Geometry>
    </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

---  Now, what I want to do is to allow for the fact that the nodes
defining this plane, may happen to be labelled 300, 20, 22, 80 instead of
0->3.  The key point being that there is still only 4 nodes, not 300 in the
file for which I only need 4 to define the geom, but need to write out 300
to all for the 0-based implicit ordering.  Therefore, I'd like a section in
the geom part of the xmf file to qualify this numbering.  It doesn't bother
me if they're subsequently renumbered inside paraview/vtk, only that I
don't have to, as this is a simplistic version of something more
complicated.  So to be verbose, it should now look like:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd">
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">
  <Domain>
    <Grid GridType="Uniform">
      <Topology TopologyType="Quadrilateral" Dimensions="1">
        <DataItem Dimensions="1 4" NumberType="Int" Precision="8"
Format="XML">
          * 300 20 22 80 *
</DataItem>
      </Topology>
      <Geometry GeometryType="*XYZ_Explicit*">
        <DataItem Dimensions="4 3" NumberType="Float" Precision="4"
Format="XML">
*   20 -0.5 -0.5 0 *
*   22 0.5 -0.5 0 *
*   80 -0.5 0.5 0 *
*   300 0.5 0.5 0 *
 </DataItem>
      </Geometry>
    </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Can this be done, or could this be done in the future?  Am I being daft and
there is an easy way to do this?

Cheers again,
Andy

Hello Andy

The XDMF2 library has the ability to assign Attributes and Information data
to Geometry objects. So you wouldn't be changing the node numbers, you'd
just be adding a new Attribute that has different values at each node, and
you'd need to display this new Attribute in Paraview instead of the node
numbers.

Since you mentioned offsets for XDMF arrays: I've been working on an XDMF2
implementation for ADCIRC, a finite element coastal ocean model. Being a
fortran code, ADCIRC uses 1-offset arrays, while the XDMF2 standard is
0-offset.

Its easy enough for us to subtract 1 from the node numbers in the element
table when storing mesh data as XDMF2, reversing the operation upon read
into ADCIRC or leaving them as-is for reading into Paraview. However, when
looking at node and element number labels on ADCIRC data in Paraview, the
analyst has to remember that all the displayed values are actually off by
1.

I emailed the XDMF mailing list and got a reply from the primary developers
that they were previously unaware of the demand for 1-offset arrays, but
they are now researching the possibility of adding this.

Your case is a little different, since it seems you are interested in
arbitrary node numbering. But I thought I would mention the above
background info for completeness. As I said, XDMF2 Attributes may be the
solution for you.

Cheers
Jason

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF and AMR grids
Message-ID: <572D1986-43B4-42B4-9C7F-2D028600AAC3@gmail.com>

Is there a way to store an AMR grid in XDMF format so that Paraview understands it? There was a post on this list in 2011 about doing this using a SubSet grid type in the XDMF file (titled ?SubSet grid type in Xdmf?). One of the responses to that post recommended using an iblank cell array to turn off the lower resolution levels. Is that still the recommended method?

Hi Jason,

Many thanks for your reply.  In my case I'm not quite sure how attributes
would help me, but I may not fully understand how they work.  As I posted
in the second xmf example file in my last email, given 4 nodes with 4
unique positions, I can completely define the plane topologically by
writing the node numbers out in the correct order, their actual
label/value/number doesn't matter (as long as it consistently refers to the
correct position).

In my example I used [300 20 22 80] as the node labels to define a 2D
plane.  However, my current understanding of xdmf(2) is that I would need
to supply in the geometry section (regardless of GeometryType) 301 x, y and
z node positions (even if 297 are just zeros), just so that I could conform
to the zero-based implicit numbering of that section.  That allows paraview
to index that data and pick out (the only) 4 positions it requires to
define the plane.

I'm asking whether there is a way round this so that, as I gave as an
example in my second xmf file, one could additionally provide an explicit
node number next to each x,y,z position so that the implicit zero-based
numbering could be skipped and only 4 x,y,z positions needed to be added to
the file in addition to their label/value/number.

Can attributes do this?  If so could you provide a quick example, ideally
just with reference to the second example file I included in my email?  Do
you have a link to the xdmf(2) mail list?

Many thanks again,
Andy

I don't think so.
If you color by the point aligned density it should be all one color.
Coloring by cell aligned density will show variation due to the averaging
used to create values on the points.
Show surfaces with edges mode, zoom in, and try selection labeling to see
the variation on a small patch.

Yep.
I understand about SC.  Let me catch you up to save some time.
In summary, when I render x3d objects from paraview that are exported from scenes rendered in serial, everything is fine.  But when rendering in parallel in ParaView, the x3d exporter hoses the colors AFAICT.

I've attached a screen shot of what your "sphere" looks like in a simple scene in blender.

Rich,

As Berk mentioned in another email, several members of the ParaView
development team were at SuperComputing last week. Since there are
several emails floating around about X3D, and I am not a very good
summarizer of emails, I am not sure where things stand, so let's start
at the start.

I've attached a simple X3D output generated from the attached ParaView
state file (for ParaView 4.1.0-RC1). I don't have much experience with
Blender and hence haven't been able to show the result as expected in
Blender. But if you don't mind, can you try loading the X3D file to
see if it renders as expected (ParaView rendered image attached)? It's
a very simple geometry with 5 points colored with 5 different colors.
Let's try to see if the exported X3D file is bad in the first place.
Just looking at the file, the contents seem reasonable to me.

Ah. I wonder if that has something to do with remote rendering. Let's try
disabling remote rendering and then export the state. Can you try this:

+ from Edit | Settings dialog (on Mac, I believe this is under the ParaView
menu itself), open the "Render VIew" page and select "Server" page. There,
uncheck "Remote Render Threshold" (image attached). Now all rendering will
happen locally on the client side.

+ Now try and export the X3D (you may want to interact with the  just to
make sure that a render happens before you export the x3d state). Any
change?

Marco,

That sounds like a good idea. Let me know if you need help. You may be
able to get by by "exploding" blocks in a multiblock dataset since in
most cases, a large mechanical model may come into ParaView as several
blocks in a multiblock dataset rather than a single dataset.

Hello Andy

Ok I think I have a better understanding of what you need. You'd like to
pick several nodes out of a larger dataset and feed them to Paraview
without having to change the node numbers, is that right? I don't think
that is possible at all, unfortunately. The XDMF reader doesn't distinguish
between the node's ID and the node's index in the array.

However, I was able to modify your example with an Attribute to reflect the
original node numbers, while also providing connectivity that complies with
the expectation of 0-offset. I loaded the result into Paraview and was able
to display your original node numbers (pls see attached).

It might be easy for you to provide a little conversion code to do the node
renumbering for XDMF. You'd have to make an array to act as a lookup table
between the original node numbers and the new, contiguous, 0-offset node
numbers. Then map old to new, and store to XDMF. The Attribute element is
then used to store the lookup table.

Here is your example with the modifications described above:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd">
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">
  <Domain>
    <Grid GridType="Uniform">
      <Topology TopologyType="Quadrilateral" Dimensions="1">
        <DataItem Dimensions="1 4" NumberType="Int" Precision="8"
Format="XML">
           0 1 3 2
        </DataItem>
      </Topology>
      <Geometry GeometryType="XYZ">
        <DataItem Dimensions="4 3" NumberType="Float" Precision="4"

          0.5 -0.5 0
          -0.5 0.5 0
           0.5 0.5 0
        </DataItem>
      </Geometry>
      <Attribute Name="myNodeLabel" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Node">
         <DataItem Dimensions="4" NumberType="Int" Precision="4"
Format="XML">
            300 20 22 80
         </DataItem>
      </Attribute>
    </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Cheers
Jason

I already had remote rendering disabled.  If I don't, then I very short files with nothing in them.  Just double-checked to make sure.

Ah. I wonder if that has something to do with remote rendering. Let's try disabling remote rendering and then export the state. Can you try this:

Yep.
I understand about SC.  Let me catch you up to save some time.
In summary, when I render x3d objects from paraview that are exported from scenes rendered in serial, everything is fine.  But when rendering in parallel in ParaView, the x3d exporter hoses the colors AFAICT.

I've attached a screen shot of what your "sphere" looks like in a simple scene in blender.

Rich,

As Berk mentioned in another email, several members of the ParaView
development team were at SuperComputing last week. Since there are
several emails floating around about X3D, and I am not a very good
summarizer of emails, I am not sure where things stand, so let's start
at the start.

I've attached a simple X3D output generated from the attached ParaView
state file (for ParaView 4.1.0-RC1). I don't have much experience with
Blender and hence haven't been able to show the result as expected in
Blender. But if you don't mind, can you try loading the X3D file to
see if it renders as expected (ParaView rendered image attached)? It's
a very simple geometry with 5 points colored with 5 different colors.
Let's try to see if the exported X3D file is bad in the first place.
Just looking at the file, the contents seem reasonable to me.

Hello,

The two main requirements for the filter that I am working on are:
(1) Need to have a GlobalIDs array associated with the nodes
(2) Single partition per process

If this case satisfies (1) and (2), then I think that the new filter can
help.

Best,
George

I can make it happen with or without the auto update enabled, although 
it's a bit flakey. See if you can reproduce it this way:

start pv, create wavelet, surface rep, color by RTData
open colormap editor, open preset color scales and without closing it, 
first choose "rainbow desaturated" then switch to "erdc_rainbow_bright".

at this point the UI  for interacting with the LUT gets messed up and 
when I close the preset color scales  dialog and click set range I see 
-1 to 1, rather than the RTData min/max. After that I have to click 
rescale to data range to get it back to where it should be.

"interpolate colors before mapping" is turned on for all objects.  
Hmm -- I just got a good image -- hold on while I figure out what I did.  I went into the advanced settings and changed a couple things.  Let's see if I can figure out when it works and when it doesn't.

There was a post on this list in 2011 about doing this using a SubSet grid type in the XDMF file (titled ?SubSet grid type in Xdmf?). One of the responses to that post recommended using an iblank cell array to turn off the lower resolution levels. Is that still the recommended method?

Along the same lines?I followed the recommendation in the aforementioned post, and the result is that I can see all my data but none of Paraview?s AMR-specific tools work. Is there a way read in an AMR grid from an XDMF file and have it treated as AMR by Paraview?

Btw, you might want to turn it off. When it's on, ParaView uses a
texture, when it's off, it maps the data values to color directly.
I'll let you get back with what happened that it worked :).

It seems as though in the "bad x3d export" case with garbled colors, I had selected the "pressure as zones" coloring method:

[cid:F2926246-67D8-45AB-9A9F-B4F94E158E99 at llnl.gov]

This does not play well with point data apparently.  Here is what I get in blender (in paraview it looks fine):

[cid:0FC308C9-AA2A-40CE-8BBF-B7750CC86B6D at llnl.gov]

When I changed this to "color by pressure as nodes":

[cid:79403207-F4EF-4EF6-918E-5D5E333878E4 at llnl.gov]

The export looks coherent and properly colored in blender:

[cid:F06B99C3-DBEF-476E-87D0-0935AF30FA1D at llnl.gov]

Although I know I should not color nodal data by zones for optimal behavior, if the GUI is going to let me do this, I would argue that all hell should not break loose.  :-)

Anyhow, workaround found, problem solved, etc.
Thanks!

Rich, the properties panels provides a "search box" on the top of the
panel. It's generally easy to simply use that to find the properties.
The panel has a "advanced" view and a "default" view and hence not all
available properties are shown in the panel. However, if you search,
all properties are searched irrespective of whether the panel is in
advanced or simple view. So just type  "interpolate " in the "Search"
box and you'll see the attached image:

For more details on the design on the properties panel, here's a post:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491

I tried to reproduce the issue using a wavelet source instead, but my
blender skills are limited and I can't seem to get any color rendered.
I'll wait till I get your response about what happens for you with the
simple sphere case to continue.

Ah! I think the problem boils down to X3D exporter not exporting cell-data
correctly. I've reported a bug: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14423

Thanks for figuring this out :).

Cool, now I have to figure out how to get rid of the cracks in my images and I'll be all set.

Although I know I should not color nodal data by zones for optimal behavior, if the GUI is going to let me do this, I would argue that all hell should not break loose.  :-)

Anyhow, workaround found, problem solved, etc.
Thanks!

Hmm -- I just got a good image -- hold on while I figure out what I did.  I went into the advanced settings and changed a couple things.  Let's see if I can figure out when it works and when it doesn't.

Rich, the properties panels provides a "search box" on the top of the
panel. It's generally easy to simply use that to find the properties.
The panel has a "advanced" view and a "default" view and hence not all
available properties are shown in the panel. However, if you search,
all properties are searched irrespective of whether the panel is in
advanced or simple view. So just type  "interpolate " in the "Search"
box and you'll see the attached image:

For more details on the design on the properties panel, here's a post:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491

I tried to reproduce the issue using a wavelet source instead, but my
blender skills are limited and I can't seem to get any color rendered.
I'll wait till I get your response about what happens for you with the
simple sphere case to continue.

Subject: [Paraview] Setting the representation to Volume doesn't work in
	Python script.
Message-ID: <CA+dOOGgOGpQYVHBmwyBM=z67Uo6pNs2zTrR-0PVMQKoAkXr39A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to set the representation to 'Volume' instead of 'Surface'. But the
result shows the representation is still the 'Surface' after I modified my
code as shown below. Thanks ahead for any help!

Best wishes,
Junyi Han


CODE:

    reader = OpenDataFile(VTKFile)
    reader.PointData
    view = GetRenderView()

    dp = GetDisplayProperties()
    dp.Representation = 'Volume'
    lut = CreateLookupTable()
    lut.RGBPoints  = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0,
                        3.3, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0,
                      6.674, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    readerRep = GetRepresentation()
    readerRep.ColorArrayName = 'scaler_name'
    readerRep.LookupTable = lut

    Show(reader)
    Render()

# Get a nice view angle
    if count == 0:
        cam = GetActiveCamera()
        cam.Elevation(30)
        cam.Azimuth(30)
        Render()

Is that data shareable? Can you send it to  me? I can see if there's
something that could be done. If you can send me the data in VTK
format so I don't need to your reader code and I think that should
work too.

I am sure what you want could be done. Do you have a sample dataset so

is working on a newer version. Dave, will the new version have support

The new version won't produce AMR at this point either, just vtkMultiBlock
of vtkUniformGrid.
In that case George's suggestion about ginning up a blanking array is the
way to go.

Sure, absolutely.

You're missing the setting up of ScalarOpacityFunction. I'd suggest
using the Tools | Start Trace/Stop Trace to generate a trace for what
happens when one sets up a volume rendering and then use the generate
code as  a guide.

Hi!

I've noticed that screenshot in png format has too big size compared to, 
for example, jpg. Tried to play with output image quality -- size didn't 
changed. For jpg all works as expected...


P.S. ParaView 4.1.0-RC1 64-bit downloaded from the site, OS: Debian 
testing amd64

Folks,

Sorry for chiming in this late. Let me start by explaining how
Copy-Paste is supposed to work. Check out the attached video.
Basically you copy parameters from one filter/source to paste on
another existing filter/source -- in the attached video, it's the
"Slice" filter. There is indeed a bug currently with filters such as
Clip/Cut. I've a fix in works for that which will get included in the
4.1 release. http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14424

Hope that clarifies things a bit.

What is the specific problem when you give it your file? Without that it is
hard to say but I am _guessing_ that xdmf doesn't like the fact that it
can't pick which atomic grids to get for each time in the temporal
collection.

    <Grid Name="mesh1" GridType="Uniform">
      ...
      <Time Value="00000"/>
      ...
        vor_00000_445_coarsed.h5:/vor
      ...
    </Grid>
    <Grid Name="mesh1" GridType="Uniform">
      ...
      <Time Value="00000"/>
      ...
        vor_00000_455_coarsed.h5:/vor
      ...
    </Grid>

To fix, put each pair of atomic data sets inside a spatial collection in
the temporal one.
< temporal
  < spatial
     time=0
     < grid 1 >
     < grid 2 >
   >
  < spatial
     time=1
     < grid 1 >
     < grid 2 >
   >
  ...

Would be nice.  I get the creepy feeling that sometimes the interface is not telling me the whole truth, and I can't put my finger on exactly when or why

that's generally expected because png's compression is loss-less while 
jpg's lossy. png uses zlib which does have a few options for adjusting 
compression vs decode/encode speed but looks like they're not exposed in PV.

So is this a bug? For me it is because in previous version of PV (4.0.1) 
I'm getting much smaller png file (almost 3 times smaller than jpg).

Hi all,

thanks Ian and Utkarsh again for you feedback, probably I was unlucky enough to choose the wrong filters when I tried your explications, Ian :-).
I'm looking forward to the new version!

Cheers,
Martina

Hi Sebastian,

Understood, thanks for the kind and quick reply. As you mentioned, we
will probably have to do some rework of this part of the session manager.

Best regards,
Bogdan

Subject: [Paraview] In-situ file/image output on Titan with 18k cores
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D875191051500286CA@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

I have done several simulation runs linked with ParaView Catalyst for in-situ visualization on Titan with 18k cores and have the following observations/questions hoping to seek input from this list.


1.       It appears IceT-based image compositing for 18k cores takes such a long time that it becomes unpractical to output images in-situ. Specifically, in our case, it takes about 14 minutes for coprocessing for one time point that output a composited image while simulation alone for one time point only takes about 7 seconds. I have also done a simulation run with in-situ visualization on Titan with 64 cores on a much lower resolution mesh (10 million element mesh as opposed on 167 million element mesh for 18k core run), in which case coprocessing with image output for 64 cores takes about 25 seconds. Question: is there any way to improve performance of image compositing for 18k cores for in-situ visualization?

2.       I also tried to avoid image output, but output polydata extracts using XMLPPolyDataWriter instead on 18k cores. In this case, in-situ coprocessing only takes about 20 seconds (compared to 14 minutes with image output). However, too many files are generated to a point that breaks the hard limit on maximal number of files in a directory since the parallel writer writes a vtp file from each of 18k cores. So the output data files have to be broken up into different directories. However, I got "cannot find file" error when I put a directory name as a parameter in coprocessor.CreateWriter() function call in my python script. I tried initially to put "data/vorticity_%t.pvtp" as a parameter, but it fails with "cannot find file" error. Not sure whether this is a bug or I need to put absolute full path in rather than a relative path to the current directory. Another question is whether there are ways to composite these files generated from different cores into one single file while doing coprocessing so only one composite file is generated rather than a huge number of files when running on large number of cores.

Thanks for any input, suggestions, and comments!

Regards,
Hong

Hi Hong,

Can you describe the type of view you're trying to output? If I remember
correctly it was volume rendering of an image data. Also, some details on
the grid would be helpful.

As for the parallel XML polydata writer, we were talking about changing it
so that it would only write out files for polydata with points and cells in
them which may help alleviate this issue some. I'm not sure what's going on
with the file -- you may need to share more information to help diagnose
the problem. Is it a writing problem during your run or a reading problem
during post-processing? The XML writers won't create a directory if it
doesn't exists yet in order to write a file.

As for reducing the number of processes that are writing, you could use the
vtkAllToNRedistributePolyData filter to reduce the number of processes that
contain any points and cells and then create another vtkMPIController that
is used by the parallel XML writer to make sure only the proper processes
write out any data. This would take quite a bit of custom coding though.

Subject: [Paraview] Session Manager with Apache front-end - session.map
Message-ID: <5294CAAD.5080707@simscale.de>

Hello all,

I am also testing a deployment of ParaviewWeb with the Apache front-end
and am encountering a problem with the configuration.

The guide describing the process makes reference to the file
session.map, which should be generated by the session manager.

The session manager does not generate one by default and have been
unable to find how and where in the settings its path can be written or
whether it has to be created.

Looking through the source code of the session manager, there are two
classes that should generate this file: JsonFileProxyConnectionAdapter
and ApacheModRewriteMapFileConnectionAdapter.

Could you please help me with a quick explanation of how to configure
the session manager so the session.map file is generated?

Kind regards,
Bogdan Daqui

it could be a bug if you saw a big increase in file size of saved png 
images between versions when rendering exactly the same scene. It'd be 
helpful if you could create a bug report, with steps to reproduce, and 
two png images that are different size.

Greetings,

   And if more information is needed, please let me know. We're looking to see if Paraview can create a volumetric slice with transparency of the following image created in Paraview.

  I saved the state file if needed, and have the data too, but since I'm a newbie here, I'm not too sure what to do.

  Thanks!

Hi Andy,

I am attaching the python coprocessing script that outputs data (rather than images) so that you can easily have an idea on what type of views I am trying to output. Basically, it is an image with vorticity contours overlaid on subchannel wall contours identified by zero velocity so that researchers can see how flow vorticity changes going through subchannel walls. The grid is unstructured grid. In fact, the simulation software is a variant of PHASTA that allows multi-phase turbulence simulation. Let me know if you need more information.

That explains it - The XML writers won't create a directory if it doesn't exists yet in order to write a file. I did not create the directory beforehand, so that must be the reason. I already suspected that is the reason, many thanks for confirming it.

Thanks for the suggestion on reducing the number of processes that are writing. I will investigate this further when I have time. Let me know if you are aware of any example on using these filters to achieve this purpose.

Thanks again for the helpful information and let me know if you have other suggestions.

Best regards,

Hong

Another question is whether there are ways to composite these files generated from different cores into one single file while doing coprocessing so only one composite file is generated rather than a huge number of files when running on large number of cores.

Thanks for any input, suggestions, and comments!

Regards,
Hong

I am not sure what you mean by volumetric slice. Does it mean multiple
slices parallel to the one slice you have in your image? If so, the "Slice"
filter does allow specifying additional offsets to slice. Switch the
Properties panel to show advanced properties (
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491) or search for "offset" in the
"search box" at the top of the Properties panel. Now you can add offsets
around the default slice.

If this is a structured dataset, try using "Extract Subset" filter.
Otherwise, you'll have to use a pair of Clip filters to get the
desired effect.

Also, since you mention transparency, there are two ways I know of (using PV 4.1.0-RC1) to get transparency.  One is down on the Properties panel - you can change the transparency of the whole slice.  The other is on the new, nifty color editor.  Open the color editor, then turn on Enable Opacity Mapping.

As with many things in ParaView, there are lots of ways to do what you are
asking, each with a slightly different behavior. I'll list through the
ones I can think of.

* Like Utkarsh said, if your data is structured, you can use the "Extract
Subset" filter. This will be the most efficient option, but the UI will be
pretty crummy.

* Also like Utkarsh said, you can use a pair of clip filters (instead of
slice) to grab a reason. Use the Inside Out option on one of the clip
filters so that the intersection of the half spaces become a slab.

* You can change the Clip Type of the clip to a Box region. This will
allow you clip a slab in one operation. The disadvantage is that the box
clip operation can introduce more artifacts than a Plane clip. Also, you
need to make sure the clip is Inside Out.

* You should also try the Extract Cells By Region filter in place of the
clip filter. Rather than cutting up cells, it will keep full cells that
intersect a region you specify. Like Clip, Extract Cells By Region allows
you to define cells by planes and boxes (although the inside/outside
semantics are reversed). I suspect the Extract Cells By Region filter with
a Box intersection will be the closest to what you want.

Ah! I see what's happening. ColorMap XMLs have a mechanism to say of the
control points are "absolute" or must be treated as normalized and should
be scaled to data range. "erdc_rainbow_bright" Color Map specifies explicit
control point locations and hence those are used rather than scaling them
automatically. I'll see how this can be made more explicit/easier to
comprehend from the user's point of view.

Subject: [Paraview] programmable filter in a python script
Message-ID: <BA00AF8E-EABF-40A6-B5F7-61F92AA6BA2E@anl.gov>

Hi,

I am guessing that there must be a trivial way of doing this, but I have yet to discover exactly how.  I have a python script that I pass to pvbatch, which includes a ProgrammableFilter.  I originally generated this from the GUI, where I could fairly easily edit the script of the ProgrammableFilter in the text box on the GUI.  After saving this as a python state file, the script of the Programmable filter becomes one big long string with "\n" characters rather than actual carriage returns.  Which makes sense, but makes the script terribly difficult to parse and edit.  So, my question is, can I create the script of the Programmable filter as a separate python script, and then just give the Programmable filter the path to this external python script?

Thanks,
joe

Yup, you indeed can. In fact, the programmable filter/source also has
a property named "PythonPath" that you can set to the location where
you'll have the python script you want to import in the filter code
(you may have to put the path in quotes). State file attached. It will
import foo in the Python programmable source when foo.py is put in
/tmp.

Hi,

I'd like to expose a double variable in the form of slider. In the Wiki

any why to read the scalar range in my code and reflect that back to the

or you can use the execfile('myfiltersource.py') instruction of  
python, and you put all you filter's code in the file.

Hi paraviewers,

   I'm trying to build ParaView with OSMesa (and gallium/llvmpipe) as
described here:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

I am working on a virtual box machine with Ubuntu 13.04 installed.  I have
followed the instructions for building osmesa and then ParaView, but I have
run into the following error during the ParaView compile phase:

Linking CXX shared library ../../../lib/libvtkftgl-pv4.1.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -l/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libOSMesa.so

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 Nov 26 10:45 pkgconfig

As demonstrated above, the library is right where make says it can't find
it.  However, I'm not familiar with this form of specifying a library with
the '-l' flag.  Usually, I would say something like '-l OSMesa', if I
wanted to link against 'libOSMesa.so', then I would say where it is located
with the 'L' flag.  Anyway, does anyone have any idea what I could have
done wrong to achieve this error?  I have included my CMakeCache.txt, but I
can provide other information if it would be useful.

Thanks!

Cheers,
Scott

Message-ID: <CA+dOOGib+ufPvEdv9JKiG2rHt_6hq1AG1hD5N8t_JhGeVgW17Q@mail.gmail.com>

Deal all,

I want to use the pvdataserver and pvrenderserver model. I start up them
separately. And I got output like this :

Connection URL: cdsrs://<data-server-hostname>:11111/johnny-M15x:22221

How can I set data-server-hostname for render server? I can't find any
arguments for this.  By the way I found -m argument is used before. Does it
exist any more?

Best wishes,
Junyi Han

You're using VirtualBox, what is the host os? I wonder if this has 
something to do with the fact that it's a symlink? I'd try rm'ing the 
symlink and making a copy of the library named libOSMesa.so. If that 
doesn't help you could always restore the symlink.

Thanks for the pointers.  

Another naive follow up question..

The script of my programmable filter starts with:
input = inputs[0] 

This works fine when the script is defined inline, but when I import it from an external file, inputs is not defined.  How do I get around this?

Thanks,
joe

Subject: [Paraview] Generate Programmable Sources with Timesteps
Message-ID: <C7BA3176-543D-4AB0-85F4-0F512E340BDE@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to generate programmable sources with timesteps.
The URL may describe how to do them:
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.#Producing_Data_with_Timesteps_.28Source.29>

But when I try the code, I got an error as below:
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<string>", line 19, in <module>
>   File "<string>", line 14, in RequestData
>   File "<string>", line 5, in GetUpdateTimesteps
> AttributeError: UPDATE_TIME_STEPS

I have Mac OS 10.9 and ParaView 4.0.1.
The attached pvsm file is what I coded. # just copied the sample code

How can I run it exactly?

Message-ID: <CA+dOOGjcmayF4oCJ4TdfBOwALzRd0LoZecLoh6mYKfEfUJ002w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I want to try the render server - data server mode. It works well when the
representation is surface, but when I change the representation to Volume,
it only shows the outline.

Then I use the pvserver to test the data. The result is that the Volume
shows well when using the pvserver.

Is this a bug or I miss something?

Best wishes,

Hi Dave,

So I'm looking suspiciously at that -l"" right before the
/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libOSMesa.so near the end of the command.  I
think I may have misunderstood the instructions, because I put empty double
quotes in that OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY instead of just nothing.  I'll try another
configure with nothing there instead.

Cheers,

The host os is OS X, version 10.9.  I'll try the thing I just responded to
Dave about first, then I'll try replacing that library symlink with a copy
of the library.  Thanks for the tip.

Cheers,
Scott

That does look suspicious. Type that command in manually without and see if
it succeeds. If so, then something is fishy with your cmake config that you
should correct.

That command succeeds as long as I just remove the -l"" altogether.  So I
re-ran ccmake and deleted those empty double-quotes, and now the build is
running again.  It's past the point where the error happened before, but
I'll respond to the list with the outcome when it has completed
successfully.  Probably just new-guy error in the end, but thanks Dave and
Burlen for coming to the rescue!

Cheers,
Scott

Sorry, the first email needs to be modified.
Even the pvserver can't show the Volume either.
But if I open the vtk file through the paraview client directly without
assigning a server, the Volume can show up.

I don't think so.
If you color by the point aligned density it should be all one color.
Coloring by cell aligned density will show variation due to the averaging used to create values on the points.
Show surfaces with edges mode, zoom in, and try selection labeling to see the variation on a small patch.

So that was my problem, everything built fine after removing the empty
double-quotes from the OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY variable in the ccmake gui.
Patrick O tells me this is a typical newbie mistake.  Thanks for the tips.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewWeb slice representation
Message-ID: <009701ceeb31$d6cf2e70$846d8b50$@infovalley.net.my>

Hi,

 

How can we achieve multiple slice views (i.e. XY, YZ, XZ planes, see
embedded snapshot) under ParaViewWeb? Is it going to be as simple as
exposing the 'Slice' representation to ParaViewWeb's API and link them all
up to three separate viewports or a more complex approach is needed (i.e.
using the 'Slice' filter which is readily available in ParaViewWeb). I'm
guessing, it won't be as efficient as the 'simple' solution because the
filter need to be reapplied many times over when we transverse across  the
object. But then again, still guessing, it would be harder (if it is even
possible) to animate the slices if we opt for the 'simple' solution
(animating the 'complex solution':
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-January/015286.html). The
ultimate goal is to have a multi-planar view with animation function.

 

 



 

 

Best Regards,

 

Den

Message-ID: <E70FE8EA6EBE9241BDB4CA6D8D12E1D801C245213BF9@RZJC1EX.jr1.local>

Hi

I am using PV 3.98.1 in Win32 bit with qt and successfully made my own plugin source.

Now I want to make my custom object panel, but the panel does not get constructed, it get compiled but does not seem to be loaded anyway.
I used the PV_DEBUG_PANELS flag but at the "Creating panel widgets for the..." part the default panels were created. 

So I debugged stuff and found following:
The PUSH_BACK_PV_INTERFACES macro in MySourcePlugin_Plugin.cxx is empty:
#ifdef plugin_type_gui
#define PUSH_BACK_PV_INTERFACES(arg)\



#endif

So the interface code in cmake macros seem to be not generated correctly in cmake, what do I  do wrong:

Here is my cmake, any ideas:

list(APPEND SERVERMANAGER_SRC
  MySource.cxx
  )
  
list(APPEND SERVERMANAGER_XML
  MySource.xml
  )
  
list(APPEND GUI_XML
  SourceGUI.xml
  )
  
set(GUI_SRCS)
set(GUI_INTERFACES)

    QT4_WRAP_CPP( MOC_SRCS pqMySource.h)
    ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL (
        IFACES IFACE_SRCS
        CLASS_NAME pqMySource
        XML_NAME MySource
        XML_GROUP sources
        )
    list(APPEND GUI_INTERFACES
        ${IFACES}
        )
    list(APPEND GUI_SRCS
        ${IFACE_SRCS}
        ${MOC_SRCS}
        pqMySource.cxx
        )
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MySourcePlugin "1.0"
    GUI_INTERFACES ${GUI_INTERFACES}
    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES ${GUI_XML}
    GUI_SOURCES ${GUI_SRCS}
    SERVER_MANAGER_XML ${SERVERMANAGER_XML}
    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ${SERVERMANAGER_SRC}
)


Would be nice if someone can help me, thanks in advance.....

Subject: [Paraview] In-situ file/image output on Titan with 18k cores

This doesn't make a lot of sense. Image compositing performance is not
strongly tied to the number of polygons. It is much more related to the
number of cores and the image size. So 64K cores with small data should not
perform so much better than 18K cores with large data. Since Ice-T takes
bounding boxes into account when compositing, there may be performance
gains when rendering less geometry but not to the extent that you are
describing.

On the other hand, I can see Mesa rendering performance being an issue. The
18K run probably has significantly more polygons per MPI rank, specially if
the polygons are not distributed somewhat evenly. This is definitely
worthwhile investigating. Do you have cycles to run a few more cases? We
can instrument things a bit better to see what is taking this much time.

We are working on ADIOS based readers and writers that will allow for
writing to a single bp file. This should be ready sometime in January. This
should makes things much better.

Volume rendering is not supported in data-server+render-server mode.
With pvserver, volume rendering is only supported when you enable
remote-rendering. Delivering entire datasets, as needed for volume
rendering, is expensive and hence we don't do it.

Joe,

YOu can put your script in a function with arguments in the foo.py
file and then call that function with the inputs argument passed in
from the small script in the Programmable filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview's initial directory when using multicore
Message-ID: <CAJ+axnDX=FbQmtJJfp=K+rmC8k7JXReXnav7kv+Mg0g1=ouKPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.

I'm using Paraview 4.0.1 on a Linux box and I'm used to start it through
the command line. First I cd to my working directory and then I issue the
command to start Paraview. In doing this when I want to open my data, the
open file dialog is already pointing at the directory where I want to load
my files.

The problem I'm facing is that when I set Paraview to use multicore support
the above procedure doesn't work anymore. I mean no matter from where I
issue the command to start Paraview, it'll always point to my HOME
directory.

This happens because after modifying the setup to use multicore,
Paraview execution
command is implicitly modified
to  "/opt/ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/mpiexec" "-np" "4"
"/opt/ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/pvserver"
"--server-port=34506".

Is there any workaround for setting the working directory the same as from
where the initialization command was issued? I could not think about any
solution for this because in Linux Paraview is direct callled by its main
executable, paraview, that is a binary file and not a shell script that I
could be able to modify.

Thank you so much for your help.

Regards,


Daniel.

Hi Den,

You should be able to use the slice representation all together with
several viewport.
You might just need a custom server and client code. But those are pretty
easy to write.

Alas, no. I can't think of any way to overcome that currently. The
pvserver process is launched from home directory without respecting
the CWD.

What are the two outputs you are getting from dataserver and
renderserver? The idea is that you can then combine the two to pass on
to the  ParaView client. ParaView takes care of communicating the
data-server/render-server information between each other e.g.

# On Hera
> ./pvdataserver
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cdsrs://hera:11111/<render-server-hostname>:22221
Accepting connection(s): hera:11111

# On Mera
> ./pvrenderserver
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cdsrs://<data-server-hostname>:11111/mera:22221
Accepting connection(s): hera:22221

Now run paraview as:
> ./paraview -url=cdsrs://hera:11111/mera:22221

Gerald,

I cannot spot anything obviously wrong. Can yo share the code or
something? BTW you may want to move away from custom panels since
future releases will deprecate them. Refer to the following Wiki pages
for details:

I am not sure I follow the question. Are you talking about how to put
a slider on Properties panel based on something on the filter XML?

It works :-)

That's really annoying, lol. I know that paraview shifted the interface in version 4, I normally wait 1-2 subversions after upgrading a mayor version because of bugs.... But I hope that there is a good migration guide....

Gerald,

I cannot spot anything obviously wrong. Can yo share the code or something? BTW you may want to move away from custom panels since future releases will deprecate them. Refer to the following Wiki pages for details:

You and me both :). It's hard to come up with the generic guide since
it a different way of thinking about things, but I'll be more  than
happy to provide some guidance if and when you get to it.

Message-ID: <CEBB7398.12DA9%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I also wonder if you are trying to render anything transparent (volume rendering, opacity < 1, or transparency in the color bars). If you do that, then ParaView will redistribute the data to create a visibility reordering. Although the rendering itself has been scaled past 18K cores, the data redistribution (using the D3 filter) has not. In fact, I would not be super surprised that it could take that long even with very little data.

In short, try rendering only opaque surfaces if you have not yet tried that.

This doesn't make a lot of sense. Image compositing performance is not strongly tied to the number of polygons. It is much more related to the number of cores and the image size. So 64K cores with small data should not perform so much better than 18K cores with large data. Since Ice-T takes bounding boxes into account when compositing, there may be performance gains when rendering less geometry but not to the extent that you are describing.

On the other hand, I can see Mesa rendering performance being an issue. The 18K run probably has significantly more polygons per MPI rank, specially if the polygons are not distributed somewhat evenly. This is definitely worthwhile investigating. Do you have cycles to run a few more cases? We can instrument things a bit better to see what is taking this much time.

We are working on ADIOS based readers and writers that will allow for writing to a single bp file. This should be ready sometime in January. This should makes things much better.

You can re-use the servlets in the Jetty session manager to start new
processes, but should rely on a more robust implementation of the WS
forwarding. If you can use Apache 2.4+ as a front-end that will be best.
Or you can make your own implementation if you want...

Subject: [Paraview]  bad scaling of low values data ranges in 4.1.0rc1
Message-ID: <529631B7.4070204@mail.ru>

Hi!

Found another difference between 4.0.1 and 4.1.0rc1: the last doesn't 
respect data ranges with upper bound value less than 1e-5 when coloring 
the data. I attached an example that demonstrate the problem: it's a 1D 
mesh with 100 hexahedral cells: half region has rho = 1e-11 and another 
half has rho = 5e-6. If you open file in 4.1.0rc1 then color map will be 
from 1e-11 to 1e-5 (not 5e-6), rescaling doesn't help. In 4.0.1 all 
works fine.

Env: both 4.0.1 and 4.1.0rc1 were downloaded from the site and installed 
on Debian testing amd64

What I am asking is how to dynamically change a slider's min and max values
on Properties panel.

ParaView wiki has this code to add a slider on Properties panel:

<DoubleVectorProperty
name="PercentToRemove"
command="SetPercentToRemove"
number_of_elements="1"
default_values="0.1">
<DoubleRangeDomain name="range" min="0.0" max="1.0" />
</DoubleVectorProperty>

This slider has values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 hard-coded. I want to change

but those values are not available until I read the data in.

Thanks, Utkarsh,

Yeah, I figured out the part about passing the needed variables as arguments last night.  The next problem that I ran into was that from within my script I create vtk objects (vtk.vtkCutter() for example).  Of course in the scope of my new script, vtk is not defined.  I tried importing it, but that proved to be less than trivial.  I know that ParaView uses its own vtk, so I tried adding the path to ParaView's site-packages (and various subdirectories) to PYTHONPATH, but it still had trouble finding some needed modules (vtkCommonCorePython, was the last one I encountered).  So, I bailed out on trying to import my code as a separate script, and instead resorted to leaving it all inline, but using the '\' character after every \n in order to split the string across multiple lines.  It is not the most ideal solution, but it at least makes the code readable/manageable.

Thanks again for your help,
joe

Joe,

Note you can use """ .... """ in Python for strings with new lines,
that way you don't have to escape anything.

Someone just pointed out that I read Hong's original e-mail wrong. I read
64 as 64K. Sorry about that. There are still some questions about which
part of rendering not scaling, which we are investigating off-list. We
still need:

- to know if transparency is involved because D3 most likely won't scale
- if we can run some tests with more instrumentation to figure out the
bottleneck

Check out this paper:

http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~pang/visweek/2013/ldav/papers/larendea.pdf

The EDF folks were getting pretty decent scalability up to 3.6K cores even
with D3 redistribution of the entire unstructured grid. However, 18K is
significantly larger so it is very likely that something will break...

Best,

I figured this out by looking at the 'vtkThreshold' section in Paraview's
'filters.xml'.

Use

<ArrayRangeDomain name="range">
     <RequiredProperties>
       <Property function="Input"
                 name="Input" />
       <Property function="ArraySelection"
                 name="SelectInputScalars" />
     </RequiredProperties>
</ArrayRangeDomain>

instead of <DoubleRangeDomain name="range" min="0.0" max="1.0" />.

Subject: [Paraview] OSMesa built into Paraview 4.1 ?
Message-ID: <CAOkZLxqpjrLTHqcSEdrSY3vMr-qdww8XxfdyQRfjrBok8KsWew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When using Paraview/Web 4.1 I found the performance is quite a bit slower
compared to
Paraview/Web <4. So I was wondering whether OSMesa was compiled in the
available Paraview 4.1 binary (Linux 64bit). If not, then building it myself
with OSMesa would hopefully speed it up.

Thank you for any help

Hi

I have wrote a simple program in Fortran that transform the output of a
finite element software in vtk Legacy Format. I don't know how to handle
the Gauss points values. For example in my case my cells have 4 Gauss
points and I have 4 values (for example strain in x-direction) for each
cell. How I have to write the vtk file taking into account that each cell
has many Gauss points?

Thank you

You'll need to use an XML file format. There's some documentation in the 
following link. It's slightly dated but should get you started. 
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/7/78/VTK-Quadrature-Point-Design-Doc.pdf
The ctest, VTK/Filters/General/Testing/Cxx/TestQuadraturePoints.cxx, 
could be used as an example.

Message-ID: <E70FE8EA6EBE9241BDB4CA6D8D12E1D801C245213C7E@RZJC1EX.jr1.local>

Hi

I currently made my own custom object panel in PV 3.98.1 and successfully made buttons and input dialogs which are calling functions of my filter.

Now I want to make a list widget which depends on the input of the filter, so the number of entries in the list and their name should depend on the number of point/cell based arrays in the input, but how do I get access to the filters input data?

I currently invoke function calls over the source proxy:

vtkSMSourceProxy* poSourceProxy = vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(this->proxy());
poSourceProxy->InvokeCommand("MyFunction");

now i need something like
vtkPolyData* poInputPolydata = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast( poSourceProxy->GetInput() );

can anyone help me or give a hint where to look?

thanks

Hi,

I have this object in ParaViewWeb,



I attempted to use the following codes to set the ScalarOpacityFunction,
    myLK = simple._GetLUTReaderInstance()
    srcObj = simple.GetActiveSource()
    myarray = srcObj.PointData.GetArray('scalars')
    mylut = myLK.GetLUT(myarray,'Brewer Diverging Spectral (11)')
    rep.LookupTable = mylut

    sofPoints =[0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
    sof = simple.CreatePiecewiseFunction()
    sof.Points = sofPoints

    rep.LookupTable.EnableOpacityMapping = 1
    rep.LookupTable.ScalarOpacityFunction = sof

    simple.Render()

And the above codes produce this in ParaViewWeb:



This is how it show in ParaView, which is what I try to achieve:


Can I know where have I done wrong ? Thanks for any help.

I launch the paraview server on nef using 32 xeon cores. I am using the

The server is listening on nef066. Paraview 3.14.1 has been install from 
the source and has been used successfully until now.

Next I start paraview 3.14.1 (binary version) on my workstation.
When I connect I get this error message

Ok everybody I think I have a good grasp at where I am trying to get with this figure (reattached), and some additional ones. Sorry, but as a newbie, it takes some time to figure out where I'm trying to go :)

So, everyone sees the slice, right? When I move up and down the z-axis with the slice, I see the field change especially towards the center. I also played with "box" in the slice type option.

I was wondering the best way to show the field change as I slide the slice. Would clip still show it? Also, is there a way to show you my Paraview screen? Let me know so I can show you exactly what's going on.


Thanks!
Jesse

Any ideas?

I'd like to generate moving object with the Programmable Source,
but there are not enough informations on the Web to do it.

You need to change the representation to "Volume" rendering.

Hi Seb,

Thanks for the info. I have change to "Volume" rendering, and now it show
the first 'box' (can't see through'). Is there anything else need to set ?

Also, when 'Volume' rendering, do I need to set rep.LookupTable.
EnableOpacityMapping = 1 ?

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Yu

I don't remember all the details, but the Python trace might be able to
show what you are missing.

Ok,

i found the solution: the reference proxy holds all input info:
pqPipelineFilter* poFilter = qobject_cast<pqPipelineFilter*>(this->referenceProxy());
QList<pqOutputPort*> oPorts = poFilter->getAllInputs();

thanks

Betreff: [Paraview-developers] custom object panel with access to input

Hi

I currently made my own custom object panel in PV 3.98.1 and successfully made buttons and input dialogs which are calling functions of my filter.

Now I want to make a list widget which depends on the input of the filter, so the number of entries in the list and their name should depend on the number of point/cell based arrays in the input, but how do I get access to the filters input data?

I currently invoke function calls over the source proxy:

vtkSMSourceProxy* poSourceProxy = vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(this->proxy());
poSourceProxy->InvokeCommand("MyFunction");

now i need something like
vtkPolyData* poInputPolydata = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast( poSourceProxy->GetInput() );

can anyone help me or give a hint where to look?

thanks

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewWeb rendering performance
Message-ID: <003801ceecde$5b651890$122f49b0$@infovalley.net.my>

Hi,

 

How can I improve the surface rendering performance of ParaViewWeb (besides
tweaking the still/interactive-image quality settings)? I could get a decent
FPS (26+/-) on ParaView (as depicted below) and ~50% decrease is naturally
expected when ported to ParaViewWeb (based on volume rendering of some
voxels). Unfortunately, the performance drop is much more critical than
initially presumed as I could barely scoop out 1 FPS. Do note that both
client and server are executed locally (i.e. if I launched the client
through a VM or remotely, then the low FPS will be further aggravated). The
dataset specifications are included at the bottom.

Hi Den,

out of curiosity, does basic surface rendering with sample VTK dataset work
as slow? In other word, is it just the volume rendering that does not
behave the same?
I'm surprised to see a so huge difference in term of performance.

Subject: [Paraview] Assistance with programmable filter
Message-ID: <5298DDAD.9080709@wmich.edu>

Hi all,

I'm working with an exodus file which has stress (S) as a 6 component 
array (obviously a symmetric rank 2 tensor in reality).  I want to find 
the principal stresses and directions and think a programmable filter is 
the best way to do it.

I have tried many variations on the code below without success. Could 
someone point me to a similar example?

Thanks,
Pete


My code is:
-----
def process_block(input_block, output_block):
  S = input_block.PointData['S']
  #SP = 
eigenvalue(array([[S[:,0],S[:,3],S[:,5],S[:,3],S[:,1],S[:,4],S[:,5],S[:,4],S[:,2]]]))
  #SP = 
eigenvalue(array([S[:,0],S[:,3],S[:,5],S[:,3],S[:,1],S[:,4],S[:,5],S[:,4],S[:,2]]))
  SP = 
eigenvalue(array([[S[:,0],S[:,3],S[:,5]],[S[:,3],S[:,1],S[:,4]],[S[:,5],S[:,4],S[:,2]]]))
  output_block.PointData.append(SP, "SP")

from paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter import MultiCompositeDataIterator
iter = MultiCompositeDataIterator([inputs[0], output])

for input_block, output_block in iter:
     process_block(input_block, output_block)


------
The error message is:

If you are using VM or offscreen rendering, then it is likely that you are
not using hardware acceleration (depending on your setup, VM tool, and
hardware). A simple check using glxgears could give your more info.

Subject: [Paraview] Python Script
Message-ID: <2F1C4770-0E67-4861-9F62-312ED8604900@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi,

It is possible to know if my script (in python) is running under ParaView (using run script from the python console) or pvpython of pvbatch.

I do some post treatment of my data( set up of a pipeline + some calculations), and I want to use the same script for the visualization and the generation of quantities of interest. The main part of the script is the same for both cases (visualization and generation of data), and only the last part is different.

So,  my idea is to detect under witch environment I'm working so I can choose the last part of the script.

Is this possible??

Thanks
Felipe

Have you tried the contour filter? Based on your screenshots I would expect that to give you a variable width cylinder along the z axis showing the behavior everywhere at once.

Ok everybody I think I have a good grasp at where I am trying to get with this figure (reattached), and some additional ones. Sorry, but as a newbie, it takes some time to figure out where I'm trying to go :)

So, everyone sees the slice, right? When I move up and down the z-axis with the slice, I see the field change especially towards the center. I also played with "box" in the slice type option.

I was wondering the best way to show the field change as I slide the slice. Would clip still show it? Also, is there a way to show you my Paraview screen? Let me know so I can show you exactly what's going on.


Thanks!

As with many things in ParaView, there are lots of ways to do what you are
asking, each with a slightly different behavior. I'll list through the
ones I can think of.

* Like Utkarsh said, if your data is structured, you can use the "Extract
Subset" filter. This will be the most efficient option, but the UI will be
pretty crummy.

* Also like Utkarsh said, you can use a pair of clip filters (instead of
slice) to grab a reason. Use the Inside Out option on one of the clip
filters so that the intersection of the half spaces become a slab.

* You can change the Clip Type of the clip to a Box region. This will
allow you clip a slab in one operation. The disadvantage is that the box
clip operation can introduce more artifacts than a Plane clip. Also, you
need to make sure the clip is Inside Out.

* You should also try the Extract Cells By Region filter in place of the
clip filter. Rather than cutting up cells, it will keep full cells that
intersect a region you specify. Like Clip, Extract Cells By Region allows
you to define cells by planes and boxes (although the inside/outside
semantics are reversed). I suspect the Extract Cells By Region filter with
a Box intersection will be the closest to what you want.

Utkarsh,

 Thanks for the response. By volumetric slice - see how the slice is
now?
Isn't there a way to make it thicker and move it up and down to show the
changes?  What about the "clip" option?

 Thanks!

I am not sure what you mean by volumetric slice. Does it mean multiple
slices parallel to the one slice you have in your image? If so, the
"Slice"
filter does allow specifying additional offsets to slice. Switch the
Properties panel to show advanced properties
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491) or search for "offset" in
the
"search box" at the top of the Properties panel. Now you can add offsets
around the default slice.

Greetings,

  And if more information is needed, please let me know. We're
looking to
see if Paraview can create a volumetric slice with transparency of the
following image created in Paraview.

 I saved the state file if needed, and have the data too, but since
I'm a
newbie here, I'm not too sure what to do.

 Thanks!

Hi Mario,

sending again to the list. the weights have 2 dimensions i (node id) and 
j (Gauss point id), so to generate ShapeFunctionWeights for a new 
QuadratureSchemeDefinition  what you do is evaluate each shape function 
at each Gauss point. For the linear quadrilateral you'll end up with 16 
weights. For example see the example

http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/images/vtk-quadrature-points-example/vtk-quadrature-points-example.pdf
