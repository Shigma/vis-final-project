Subject: [Paraview] Maintain triangulation of slive from vtk to numpy
Message-ID: <SN1PR0701MB18065569A95ED04E12DF7F33BB290@SN1PR0701MB1806.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hello All


Does anyone know if the capability exists to extract slice data through the python interface of paraview that contains the triangulation data of the slice? This would allow one to pull flattened VTK data in the form of numpy arrays, but still plot non-convex slice geometries easily with mayplotlib.tricont()


Thanks for your help.

Message-ID: <CA+a=0o5UoVLFxRcLzTB2vZj=86aNOCRv7hUM0-H-gMtvHqQjVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

Sorry to bother, but I can't seem to find a way (in the mailing list or the
documentation) to pass a string as some kind of argument to Programmable
Source (using pvpython interpreter). The python "program" needs to load a
custom binary format using numpy.fromfile.

What I've thought is to write a wrapper function. The function should
receive a string as argument and then instantiate a programmable filter and
execute
myscript.replace(random_var_name, myfilename)
MyProgrammableSource.Script = myscript
return MyProgrammableSource

Where random_var_name is the argument of my numpy.fromfile call. But that
doesn't seem very "pythonic". Is there a way to pass a string to the Script
without the .replace hack?

Sorry if this is documented, I couldn't find it.

Cheers,
Mauro

Hi again community!

Looking for suggestions - what would be a decently fast way to convert a
huge CSV file into PVTU files?

What I want to do - load this huge file in a CAVE like environment, and use
8 parallel processors.

You can use ParaView itself to read in the csv file, convert it to an unstructured grid (Table to Points filter), redistributed on your 8 parallel processors (D3 filter) and then write out a pvtu file.

Offhand I cannot think of an easier way.

Hi Ken,

I have seen Bill Sherman ran it at the CAVE at IUPUI, I am just curious to see 
if VT has a different way of running PV on a CAVE like display. We run PV on

You can use ParaView itself to read in the csv file, convert it to an 
unstructured grid (Table to Points filter), redistributed on your 8 parallel 
processors (D3 filter) and then write out a pvtu file.



Offhand I cannot think of an easier way.

Hi again community!



Looking for suggestions - what would be a decently fast way to convert a huge 
CSV file into PVTU files?



What I want to do - load this huge file in a CAVE like environment, and use 8
parallel processors.

Dear Sir/Madam,
    Good day. I have downloaded Paraview, however it is not opening. Every
time it is giving error message "paraveiw.exe has stopped working". I am
attaching the screenshot for your information. Would you please let me know
what to do.

I tried 37-ge566e81 and with it saving animations (and screenshots of

Can you share details about your system? What's the GPU? Are the drivers
up-to-date?

Utkarsh,
     Thank you for your email and contact. I am trying to download two
versions (version 5.3.0-R2 which is available in the Paraview website as
well as version 5.1.2 from BlueCFD-Core), however none is opening. I am
sending screen shot of my computer configurations below. Please let me know
if you have any more question.

Now that sounds (reads) much better and cleaner.

Thanks for your time and your response David.

Hi Moreland,

Thanks for your reply.

I thought same except maybe not use the GUI since my data is big and takes
forever to load up in Paraview.

Quick question/observation - using the GUI and 8 processes, and applying
the Tables to Points filter + D3 and then trying to save files doesn't
create 8 vtu files and 1 pvtu file as expected. Instead, what happens is
that I get only 1 pvtu file along with 1 vtu file instead. Clearly
something wrong. This was done using v5.2.0.

I tried the same thing using v4.0.1 (yes, old but it works!) and I got 8
vtu files and 1 pvtu file as expected.

Do you think this is a bug with 5.2.0? Or do I need to do something
different with 5.2.0? Any pointers appreciated!

Faiz,

I was able to replicate your problem. It looks like it is not an issue with D3 but a change with how Table to Points creates data (or perhaps how data are written). It looks like Table to Points is creating one ?cell? with a lot of points. This saves a little memory but ends up preventing D3 from dividing the points up.

The best solution is to add a ?2D Glyph? filter after the Table to Points but before the D3 filter. Set the ?Glyph Type? to ?Vertex?. Then apply the D3 filter to the output of the 2D Glyph filter.

Hi again community!

Looking for suggestions - what would be a decently fast way to convert a huge CSV file into PVTU files?

What I want to do - load this huge file in a CAVE like environment, and use 8 parallel processors.

Ohk, that makes more sense. I could get it to work as well but also had to
check "Boundary Mode" as "Duplicate Cells" while applying the D3 filter.

Thanks Moreland!

I?m pretty sure if you select Duplicate Cells it will just copy all the points to all processes, so that is not a good option. The divide cells is also giving poor results on this front. I think you are better off using the 2D Glyph filter to break up the cell first.

I see.

I did that because when I choose "Assign Cells Uniquely" as the "Boundary
Mode" in the D3 filter, I was getting a warning like below:

Warning: In /home/faiz89/git/ParaView/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkKdTree.cxx,
line 1887
vtkKdTree (0x2db5950): vtkKdTree::BuildMapForDuplicatePoints - invalid
tolerance

But in spite of the warning, 8 vtu files get generated along with 1 pvtu
file. So, maybe that warning can be ignored.

Message-ID: <E744507DCB192B45930918B1A2FF10312907C251@petmail.WIN.PET.HW.AC.UK>

Hi guys;

I am using a numerical method (Volume of fluid, just for information) to look at the breaking of a bubble in a micro-channel. Attached picture.

As mostly, the bubbles are of uniform size, I would like to know the volume of any one bubble formed.

The bubble is represented by a scalar data set represented by 1 and bounded by the same data set with values 0.

I think to clip the region enclosing one bubble and draw a contour where the scalar value is 0.5. Now, I tried the integrate variables filter but I did not find a data representing the volume.  Any idea how can I get the volume enclosed by this contour?

Any help appreciated.

Thanks;
SaiD

Your best bet would be to use the Threshold filter to extract the region where the scalar is greater (or less than) 0.5 and then use the IntegrateVariables filter on the Threshold.


It's not entirely clear your exact pipeline, but it sounds like you are using the IntegrateVariables filter on the Contour, which would give you the surface area of the region instead.

I could precisely extract the bubble using the threshold filter as you said (attached picture).

Coming to the 2nd step: I applied the integrate variables filter on the threshold data but I get the general data set values within individual cells like the computed velocity, pressure, etc....

How do I integrate the the region in space to find the enclosed volume?

Sorry, if it's a basic question.

The IntegrateVariables filter creates a spreadsheet of PointData (or CellData, depending on where your data is stored in the filter just before IntegrateVariables) with the integral of your data over the volume/area/length depending on if it is 3D/2D/1D data respectively.


It also adds a field to the CellData array that will be Volume/Area/Length respectively.


My guess is if you aren't seeing it immediately it is because you are looking at the PointData array and not the CellData array. In the SpreadSheetView that opens up, change the Attribute dropdown from Point Data to Cell Data.


Also, as a note -- the values for your variables (pressure, velocity, whatever) are multiplied by the length scale, so if you want the average value in the domain, you need to divide it by the length scale.

Tim,

I did try to vary from pointData to cellData but I see the same fields present. That is, I see no additional field being added.

Attached is a screenshot (all the data from U are the variables being computed from my solver). I tried it over 4.x and 5.x versions of paraview so, I guess I am doing something wrong.

Hmmm, interesting. It must be a function of the type of data from the OpenFOAM reader and I am unfamiliar with that reader.


All of my datasets are structured and behave the way I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure how to get the volume from the dataset you have.


Somebody else will have to chime in on this one. Just out of curiosity, if you IntegrateVariables again, does it condense the data into a single set of values? (That's a totally random guess -- maybe the first IntegrateVariables is coming up with the cell-averaged values from an unstructured dataset, and the second would do the integral of all the cell-averages).


Sorry, I tried!


Tim

How do I integrate the the region in space to find the enclosed volume?



Sorry, if it?s a basic question.

Your best bet would be to use the Threshold filter to extract the region where the scalar is greater (or less than) 0.5 and then use the IntegrateVariables filter on the Threshold.



It's not entirely clear your exact pipeline, but it sounds like you are using the IntegrateVariables filter on the Contour, which would give you the surface area of the region instead.

Hi guys;



I am using a numerical method (Volume of fluid, just for information) to look at the breaking of a bubble in a micro-channel. Attached picture.



As mostly, the bubbles are of uniform size, I would like to know the volume of any one bubble formed.



The bubble is represented by a scalar data set represented by 1 and bounded by the same data set with values 0.



I think to clip the region enclosing one bubble and draw a contour where the scalar value is 0.5. Now, I tried the integrate variables filter but I did not find a data representing the volume.  Any idea how can I get the volume enclosed by this contour?



Any help appreciated.



Thanks;

Hi Tim;

Yes I do think so it is somehow related to the OpenFOAM reader. I just tried a tutorial case from the CFD package and I still have the same data set with no additional data related to the volume/ area/ length.

I am not sure if I understood your idea right, do you mean apply integrateVariables twice on the same threshold data set?



"Sorry, I tried!"
No worries this has been a long standing problem for my work. I am really happy that you shared your ideas with me.

Hmmm, interesting. It must be a function of the type of data from the OpenFOAM reader and I am unfamiliar with that reader.



All of my datasets are structured and behave the way I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure how to get the volume from the dataset you have.



Somebody else will have to chime in on this one. Just out of curiosity, if you IntegrateVariables again, does it condense the data into a single set of values? (That's a totally random guess -- maybe the first IntegrateVariables is coming up with the cell-averaged values from an unstructured dataset, and the second would do the integral of all the cell-averages).



Sorry, I tried!

Tim,



I did try to vary from pointData to cellData but I see the same fields present. That is, I see no additional field being added.



Attached is a screenshot (all the data from U are the variables being computed from my solver). I tried it over 4.x and 5.x versions of paraview so, I guess I am doing something wrong.

Subject: Re: Finding volume enclosed by a contour.



The IntegrateVariables filter creates a spreadsheet of PointData (or CellData, depending on where your data is stored in the filter just before IntegrateVariables) with the integral of your data over the volume/area/length depending on if it is 3D/2D/1D data respectively.



It also adds a field to the CellData array that will be Volume/Area/Length respectively.



My guess is if you aren't seeing it immediately it is because you are looking at the PointData array and not the CellData array. In the SpreadSheetView that opens up, change the Attribute dropdown from Point Data to Cell Data.



Also, as a note -- the values for your variables (pressure, velocity, whatever) are multiplied by the length scale, so if you want the average value in the domain, you need to divide it by the length scale.

I was suggesting trying a pipeline like:


OpenFOAM Reader -> Threshold -> IntegrateVariables -> IntegrateVariables


So your second IV filter is applied to the first IV filter.


Again, no idea if that will help. Hopefully somebody else can come along and give you a solution.

Hello,

ParaView 5.3.0 has been released for some time, I want to know if there is any documentation that introduces new features of it. I noticed that in ParaView 5.3.0, vtkm has replaced PISTON as an accelerator, but is it still just an accelerator for some filters? I am particularly concerned that if my data is generated by the code running on GPUs, can I write something like an adapter to visualize the data in situ in GPU memory ? My data is just point data and doesn't need any filter.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAAxiCSxUz0Mcr13HCqFjmQ95ZiROxiMsOw5SGKCJVqLZmzxyDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to compile Paraview 5.0.1 with EGL support as I want to use
NVIDIA Tesla K20c
for rendering in Ubuntu 14.04. This is without any windowing system as K20c
is designed for
server based rendering (without any VGA port and OpenGL support (I think!))

I went through

https://blog.kitware.com/off-screen-rendering-through-the-native-platform-interface-egl/

and as I understand, for this I need to set the below Paraview flags before
compilation:

VTK_EGL_DEVICE_INDEX=set to graphics driver index
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN_EGL =on
EGL_INCLUDE_DIR
EGL_LIBRARY /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libEGL.so
EGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLdispatch.so.0
EGL_opengl_LIBRARY /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so

My query is on gettting the correct libs i.e. libEGL.so, libGLdispatch.so.0
and libOpenGL.so.

When I installed "NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.26.run" these libs were not
installed.

Which is the right place to get them. I can see several links on internet
search:

https://github.com/NVIDIA/libglvnd/blob/master/README.md

https://www.mesa3d.org/egl.html

Which is the correct one

Thanks in advance for help.

The volume is nothing more that the integral of one (1). So make a
calculator with a new variable named "rho" and with the value 1 then apply
the int?grate variable filter to compute the volume.

Be careful no to have bars in your mesh, they will also contribute to the
volume calculation.

In general you must filter your mesh by dimensionality (only 3D cell or
only 2D...)

Hope it helps

Felipe

With this file
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8yIfGqnlfSoejlSbUlVT1RFX3M>, when I
apply a Cell Centers filter sometimes it works (see attached works.jpg) and
sometimes it produces garbage output (note the Y-range) (see attached

Can anyone explain why this is?

Alan,

There are couple of options that could be work exploring. Let me know which
you see is most appropriate and I can get you in touch with the appropriate
folks.

1.  GeoJS -- a web-based solution.
     Docs: https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs
     Example: http://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/deepzoom/
     Other examples:
http://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/index.html

2. vtkMap -- a VTK-based solution which is currently being developed which
also includes ParaView integration.

I was trying IntegrateVaraiables with OpenFoam data last week and it seemed to give the areas OK, though the data had been converted to EnSight format- might be worth a try?

The volume is nothing more that the integral of one (1). So make a calculator with a new variable named "rho" and with the value 1 then apply the int?grate variable filter to compute the volume.

Be careful no to have bars in your mesh, they will also contribute to the volume calculation.

In general you must filter your mesh by dimensionality (only 3D cell or only 2D...)

Hope it helps

Le 4 mars 2017 7:46 PM, "Gallagher, Timothy P" <tim.gallagher at gatech.edu<mailto:tim.gallagher at gatech.edu>> a ?crit :

I was suggesting trying a pipeline like:


OpenFOAM Reader -> Threshold -> IntegrateVariables -> IntegrateVariables


So your second IV filter is applied to the first IV filter.


Again, no idea if that will help. Hopefully somebody else can come along and give you a solution.

Hi Tim;



Yes I do think so it is somehow related to the OpenFOAM reader. I just tried a tutorial case from the CFD package and I still have the same data set with no additional data related to the volume/ area/ length.



I am not sure if I understood your idea right, do you mean apply integrateVariables twice on the same threshold data set?



?Sorry, I tried!?

No worries this has been a long standing problem for my work. I am really happy that you shared your ideas with me.

Subject: Re: Finding volume enclosed by a contour.



Hmmm, interesting. It must be a function of the type of data from the OpenFOAM reader and I am unfamiliar with that reader.



All of my datasets are structured and behave the way I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure how to get the volume from the dataset you have.



Somebody else will have to chime in on this one. Just out of curiosity, if you IntegrateVariables again, does it condense the data into a single set of values? (That's a totally random guess -- maybe the first IntegrateVariables is coming up with the cell-averaged values from an unstructured dataset, and the second would do the integral of all the cell-averages).



Sorry, I tried!



Tim

Tim,



I did try to vary from pointData to cellData but I see the same fields present. That is, I see no additional field being added.



Attached is a screenshot (all the data from U are the variables being computed from my solver). I tried it over 4.x and 5.x versions of paraview so, I guess I am doing something wrong.

Subject: Re: Finding volume enclosed by a contour.



The IntegrateVariables filter creates a spreadsheet of PointData (or CellData, depending on where your data is stored in the filter just before IntegrateVariables) with the integral of your data over the volume/area/length depending on if it is 3D/2D/1D data respectively.



It also adds a field to the CellData array that will be Volume/Area/Length respectively.



My guess is if you aren't seeing it immediately it is because you are looking at the PointData array and not the CellData array. In the SpreadSheetView that opens up, change the Attribute dropdown from Point Data to Cell Data.



Also, as a note -- the values for your variables (pressure, velocity, whatever) are multiplied by the length scale, so if you want the average value in the domain, you need to divide it by the length scale.



Tim

Thanks Tim;



I could precisely extract the bubble using the threshold filter as you said (attached picture).



Coming to the 2nd step: I applied the integrate variables filter on the threshold data but I get the general data set values within individual cells like the computed velocity, pressure, etc?.



How do I integrate the the region in space to find the enclosed volume?



Sorry, if it?s a basic question.

Your best bet would be to use the Threshold filter to extract the region where the scalar is greater (or less than) 0.5 and then use the IntegrateVariables filter on the Threshold.



It's not entirely clear your exact pipeline, but it sounds like you are using the IntegrateVariables filter on the Contour, which would give you the surface area of the region instead.

Hi guys;



I am using a numerical method (Volume of fluid, just for information) to look at the breaking of a bubble in a micro-channel. Attached picture.



As mostly, the bubbles are of uniform size, I would like to know the volume of any one bubble formed.



The bubble is represented by a scalar data set represented by 1 and bounded by the same data set with values 0.



I think to clip the region enclosing one bubble and draw a contour where the scalar value is 0.5. Now, I tried the integrate variables filter but I did not find a data representing the volume.  Any idea how can I get the volume enclosed by this contour?



Any help appreciated.



Thanks;

Btw, I am a bit confused that why after applying a "2D Glyph" filter and
"Glyph Type" as "Vertex", the number of points decreases. For example, if
after applying "TableToPoints" filter I have 1 cell and 100k points, I get
 502 cells and 502 points after applying a "2D Glyph" filter. I was
expecting the number of cells to increase but total number of points should
have remained 100k, no?

I am not really sure if applying a 2D Glyph is the best solution in my
case. I may go back to using 4.0.1 to convert this csv data into pvtu and
then use the latest version to load it up.

Hi,

Maybe look in:
 /usr/lib/nvidia-<driver version>

for the drivers -- that's where  it is for my r367 NVIDIA drivers on Ubuntu
16.04. Otherwise you may need to check with NVIDIA on where it gets
installed for your set of drivers and system.

Hi David,

This looks like it has to do with blanking (i.e. in PV 5.2 if I don't load
the vtkGhostType array it has the proper bounds). Would you mind putting in
a bug report on Gitlab (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview)?

Thanks,
Andy

Apologies if there has already been a post about this, but after searching the list archive I didn't see it.

I downloaded a Windows 64 bit installer for Paraview 5.3.0 RC2 and tried to look at the release notes via the Help menu but the URL opened in the browser points to a page that does not exist:

  https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-5-3-0-release-notes/

I tried a few variants of the URL but can't see release notes.

I'm keen to see whether this was included:

We typically don't post the release notes until the final binaries are
released as new items may be added during the release candidate phase
as issues are identified.

Yes, this will be in 5.3.0. Thanks again for the patch.

I have to defer to the VTKm and in situ experts on the list to answer
this question.

Here is another presumed bug that seems to also have to do with blanking:

Message-ID: <58BD7F5C.1060705@uibk.ac.at>

Dear all,

i currently experience a 3d contour issue in paraview. If i try to
visualise my scalar data on a cylindrical R,Z,\varphi grid by contours,
the interpolation of the contours prefers the \varphi direction even if
the real data or contour prefers the direction along another vectorfield.

You can find an exemplary picture at
https://github.com/feltor-dev/feltor. Here, the bubbles along \varphi
are not interpolated correctly.

Is there any workaround to do it correctly?

best regards

Zhang,

Since you're most likely changing the aspect ratio quite dramatically,
I'd suggest the following:
1. explicitly setting the current view size to have an aspect ratio
comparable to the target, but keep the resolution smaller than what's
available on your display. You can use "Tools | Lock View Size To
Custom".
2. then, adjust the scene as appropriate to view the data optimally.
3. now try saving the screenshot of the resolution of interest.

Thanks for the bug report!

I think the stackoverflow issue is probably also related to blanking. I
added to your bug report with two other (likely) related issues.

As a side note, I think if blanking was used instead of ghost cells this
may work properly.

Thanks,
Andy

Message-ID: <c9a48219fbe045719b8a4e72c8fc61c7@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Sorry, I might have mislead you a little bit before. What you actually need is the Glyph filter with Glyph Type set to 2D Glyph and then the secondary Glyph Type set to Vertex.

By default the glyph filter subsamples the data (to prevent occlusion when creating glyphs with size). Under Masking change the Glyph Mode to All Points, and you should get what you want.

Also, check the vtu files being generated by ParaView 4.0.1 carefully. I suspect one of them is very large and all the others are very small. I think the old version of ParaView is writing a bunch of vtu files with no points whereas new versions of ParaView are not writing out pointless empty vtu files.

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] CSV to PVTU

Btw, I am a bit confused that why after applying a "2D Glyph" filter and "Glyph Type" as "Vertex", the number of points decreases. For example, if after applying "TableToPoints" filter I have 1 cell and 100k points, I get  502 cells and 502 points after applying a "2D Glyph" filter. I was expecting the number of cells to increase but total number of points should have remained 100k, no?

I am not really sure if applying a 2D Glyph is the best solution in my case. I may go back to using 4.0.1 to convert this csv data into pvtu and then use the latest version to load it up.

On Fri, Mar 3, 2017 at 2:14 PM, Faiz Abidi <fabidi89 at vt.edu<mailto:fabidi89 at vt.edu>> wrote:
I see.

I did that because when I choose "Assign Cells Uniquely" as the "Boundary Mode" in the D3 filter, I was getting a warning like below:

Warning: In /home/faiz89/git/ParaView/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkKdTree.cxx, line 1887
vtkKdTree (0x2db5950): vtkKdTree::BuildMapForDuplicatePoints - invalid tolerance

But in spite of the warning, 8 vtu files get generated along with 1 pvtu file. So, maybe that warning can be ignored.

I?m pretty sure if you select Duplicate Cells it will just copy all the points to all processes, so that is not a good option. The divide cells is also giving poor results on this front. I think you are better off using the 2D Glyph filter to break up the cell first.

Ohk, that makes more sense. I could get it to work as well but also had to check "Boundary Mode" as "Duplicate Cells" while applying the D3 filter.

Thanks Moreland!

Faiz,

I was able to replicate your problem. It looks like it is not an issue with D3 but a change with how Table to Points creates data (or perhaps how data are written). It looks like Table to Points is creating one ?cell? with a lot of points. This saves a little memory but ends up preventing D3 from dividing the points up.

The best solution is to add a ?2D Glyph? filter after the Table to Points but before the D3 filter. Set the ?Glyph Type? to ?Vertex?. Then apply the D3 filter to the output of the 2D Glyph filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] CSV to PVTU

Hi Moreland,

Thanks for your reply.

I thought same except maybe not use the GUI since my data is big and takes forever to load up in Paraview.

Quick question/observation - using the GUI and 8 processes, and applying the Tables to Points filter + D3 and then trying to save files doesn't create 8 vtu files and 1 pvtu file as expected. Instead, what happens is that I get only 1 pvtu file along with 1 vtu file instead. Clearly something wrong. This was done using v5.2.0.

I tried the same thing using v4.0.1 (yes, old but it works!) and I got 8 vtu files and 1 pvtu file as expected.

Do you think this is a bug with 5.2.0? Or do I need to do something different with 5.2.0? Any pointers appreciated!

You can use ParaView itself to read in the csv file, convert it to an unstructured grid (Table to Points filter), redistributed on your 8 parallel processors (D3 filter) and then write out a pvtu file.

Offhand I cannot think of an easier way.

Hi again community!

Looking for suggestions - what would be a decently fast way to convert a huge CSV file into PVTU files?

What I want to do - load this huge file in a CAVE like environment, and use 8 parallel processors.

Yes you can use VTK-m for this exact use case, but it will require you to
write a new VTK-m / ParaView component. VTK-m offers a collection
of OpenGL functions that help marshall data between CUDA and the
OpenGL runtime.

if you are curious on what this would entail I recommend starting with the
VTK-m users guide (still a work in progress) :
http://m.vtk.org/images/c/c8/VTKmUsersGuide.pdf

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython, get data over time
Message-ID: <CABcGDN-peBwGwuFV_jXCuJM=RtRof1aFjPqiB6CBy2+ccY4gCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to collect data over time. Using as a

#### import the simple module from the paraview
from paraview.simple import *

# create a new 'ExodusIIReader'
reader =
ExodusIIReader(FileName=['C:\\Users\\John\\Desktop\\download\\V_171_V_d_2_um_phi_4.50_eV_tOn_0.5_ns.e'])
reader.GenerateObjectIdCellArray = 1
reader.GenerateGlobalElementIdArray = 1
reader.ElementVariables = reader.ElementVariables.Available
reader.PointVariables = reader.PointVariables.Available
reader.ElementBlocks = reader.ElementBlocks.Available
reader.ApplyDisplacements = 1
reader.DisplacementMagnitude = 1.0

# get animation scene
animationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()

# update animation scene based on data timesteps
animationScene1.UpdateAnimationUsingDataTimeSteps()

# create a new 'Integrate Variables'
integrateVariables1 = IntegrateVariables(Input=reader)

Then, in the trace, the next important line output is

plotSelectionOverTime1 = PlotSelectionOverTime(Input=integrateVariables1,
Selection=None)


But whereas in the GUI, it integrates over space for all time steps, this
doesn't create any data. I'm assuming the problem is related to
"Selection=None" but I cannot figure out how to select the data or a
different function I could use.

Any advice?

BTW, do you have Dell Backup and Recovery tools installed? There's a known
issue with Qt 5 and DBaR. You may want to update the DBaR tools to the
latest version, if possible.

Message-ID: <CAHmFOOzmbBa0yDyBgBwX1OmhxMFK7BniOBovr9pQkGLB_QXdiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am compiling ParaView-5.2.0 for offscreen rendering and ParaViewWeb on an
Ubuntu 16.04.2 VM with:

      -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON \
      -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF \
      -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON \
      -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=ON \
      -DVTK_USE_X=OFF \
      -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB=ON \

but the resulting build does not include ParaViewWeb:

$ ls paraview/share/
cmake

and there is no pvw-visualizer.py anywhere. Am I missing something?

Thank you,

What you are seeing is expected.

The Web (JS+HTML) part of ParaView has been externalized inside its own
repo.
But based on what you've done, you've properly build ParaView and the
Python side of it that is required for the Web component to work.

ParaView super build for instance will download visualizer from (
https://github.com/Kitware/visualizer) and bundle it in our distribution.

So what you are missing is the "dist" directory from the repo above (which
correspond to the www directory) and the "server" directory that contains
the python script that should be run inside pvpython.

Let me know if you need more guidance.

Seb

Hi All,

I found an older post that used the SelectPoints/SelectCells methods.
However, even with "OnlyReportSelectionStatistics = 0" I still am getting
min, q1, med, q3, max, avg, std. My script is attached.

You are right about v4.0.1. Though it creates 8 vtu files, only the first
one contains all the points while the other seven are empty.

And yes, changing the Masking to All Points worked.

Thanks again for your help!

P.S. I was reading THIS
<http://www.kennethmoreland.com/documents/EGPGV2006Paper.pdf> paper and
realized you were one of the authors. Nice read.

Kyle,


Once you get a slice, you can extract the underlying vtkUnstructuredGrid and use that to extract the connectivity. For example:


uns_grid = servermanager.Fetch(slice)


npts = uns_grid.GetNumberOfCells()


for n in xrange(npts):

    ptids = vtk.vtkIdList()

    uns_grid.GetCellPoints(0, ptids)

    print [ptids.GetId(i) for i in xrange(ptids.GetNumberOfIds())]


And you can interchange the words Point and Cell to get the inverse information (all of the cells using a given point).


I tried playing around with something along the lines of:


uns_grid.BuildLinks()

links = uns_grid.GetCellLinks()

npts = uns_grid.GetNumberOfPoints()


for i in xrange(npts)

    print links.GetCells(i)


but GetCells returns a vtkIdType pointer, which in Python shows up as a string containing an address in memory. I couldn't figure out how to translate that back into something meaningful.


Tim

Subject: [Paraview] Maintain triangulation of slive from vtk to numpy


Hello All


Does anyone know if the capability exists to extract slice data through the python interface of paraview that contains the triangulation data of the slice? This would allow one to pull flattened VTK data in the form of numpy arrays, but still plot non-convex slice geometries easily with mayplotlib.tricont()


Thanks for your help.

Hi Andy,

The file was created with something like this:

https://gist.github.com/daviddoria/8bf981aa593b7cefcd9114588e4766db

Does calling

structuredGrid->BlankPoint(0);

not count as "using blanking"? Can you point me to the "right way" to do
this if this is not the current best practice?

Thanks!

David

Mahmud, if you have "Dell Backup and Recovery" tools installed, you'll need
to either remove them or update them to the latest version due a known

Hi Mathieu,

for info, here is the backtrace for the PV5.2 bug with seg fault when 
disconnecting (sorry it was stuck in my draft e-mails since a while :-).

I did not find the time to rebuild with the last version. I will try to 
do so soon... I think I have to rebuild it from source as the basic goal 
is to package it on nix system (which uses internal nix package 
dependencies). I currently use 5.3 RC2 for my developments and it works 
completely fine on any system (not including nix :-).

Bye,

Yves

Hello,

When I try to type any non-latin symbols inside Script field I get this
error: QTextCursor::setPosition: Position '1' out of range (:0, )
Previous versions did not have that issue.

Message-ID: <CABcGDN8Eue8SP=isTmSf4eHXOoSBBDV5jCx8v8MJ+vQ7WYR5KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Paraviewers,

I'm trying to save a table to csv (similar to
http://markmail.org/search/?q=ParaView+order%3Adate-backward+plotselectionovertime#query:ParaView%20order%3Adate-backward%20plotselectionovertime+page:3+mid:7k7wbaoz23uxhpgf+state:results
 )

However, even though I have "OnlyReportSelectionStatistics = 0", I am still
getting statistics rather than values.

Is this a bug or am I doing sometime wrong?

I've attached a simple version of my script.

Thank you,

John

Currently, "PlotSelectionOverTime" can only generate summaries (aka
OnlyReportSelectionStatistics=1) when the selection is query-based
selection. The `simple.SelectCells` only creates query-based
selection. Currently here's no clean way to create an id-based
selection. Attached script directly create an ID-based selection
source. Now, OnlyReportSelectionStatistics=0 works as expected.

Mahmud,

Please cc-ing the mailing list so that everyone can benefit from this
discussion.

Like I said in my previous emails, ParaView now uses Qt 5 and there's a
known issues with Dell Backup & Recovery Tools and Qt 5 (
http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3526/t/19634253).
If you cannot upgrade on uninstall Dell Backup & Recovery software, then
you may have to stick with using previous version of ParaView.

If you do not have Dell Backup and Recovery Tools installed, then I am
still at loss at what could be going on, since I can't reproduce this
issue. So any more insight you can provide at that point, may help.

Utkarsh

tried to just change "CELL" to "POINT" and it did not work.

Hi Bishwajit,

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the K20c was a specific model of
Tesla that is restricted to compute functionality only and is not capable
of performing OpenGL functions via EGL.  As such, it won't be usable by
ParaView for rendering.  Almost all other Teslas, including the other K20
models (K20m and K20x), can be switched into either compute-only,
graphics-only, or both modes, but the K20c only has compute mode
available.  So even though you may get it building with the libraries in
the folder Andy is pointing to, I don't believe you'll actually get a
working EGL device.  If you do, then fantastic, but don't get your hopes up
:-/

Alan,

There are couple of options that could be work exploring. Let me know which you see is most appropriate and I can get you in touch with the appropriate folks.

1.  GeoJS -- a web-based solution.
     Docs: https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs
     Example: http://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/deepzoom/
     Other examples: http://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/index.html

2. vtkMap -- a VTK-based solution which is currently being developed which also includes ParaView integration.
    Code: https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/vtkMap

Hi guys,

Thanks,

I am trying to export my animation, but want to keep the size small, and
quality of the simulation good. How can I go about it?

I tried to directly save in the avi format, but the quality is bad and size

Save as a flipbook of .png?s.  Then, post process this into any type of move files (.avi etc).  Use a third party movie creating program, such as ffmpeg.  I think vlc may also do it, but have never done so.

Hi Scott

Thanks for your reply. Will PNG ensure the final movie size is small? Or is
there something else that will determine the final size?

As with most things in life, you have a balance.  Generally speaking, for better quality, you will need larger movies.  For smaller movies, you will have higher compression and poorer quality.  And of course, the smaller the screen size, the smaller the resultant movie.  So, you get to choose.

.png is an intermediate file format or storage that you will use.  I believe that when you make movies, the final file format (and movie size) is what will determine the movie size.

Regarding .png?s, they are lossless compression.  .jpg?s are lossy compression.  Png?s lose no quality, jpg?s lose quality.

Hi Scott

Thanks for your reply. Will PNG ensure the final movie size is small? Or is there something else that will determine the final size?

Dear all

I am trying to export my animation, but want to keep the size small, and quality of the simulation good. How can I go about it?

I tried to directly save in the avi format, but the quality is bad and size is too large.

Hi David,

I'm not sure how it works with structured grids but with vtkUniformGrids
(i.e. vtkImageData with blanking) the VTK readers and writers really just
produce vtkImageData and the blanking is ignored. It may be the same with
the XML structured grid files. My suggestion would be to look at the
vtkImageDataToUniformGrid class in VTK and try doing a similar thing in
ParaView using the Python Programmable filter.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi,

 I always have problems choosing the settings when doing videos (bitrate,
framerate, resolution...). Now I make my videos in full resolution/no
compression. And use my Google(YouTube) account to upload my video to my
private space. YouTube will automatically recompress the video. And because
the video belongs to me, I can download it. Et voil?. A video with a very
good quality/size balance.

Subject: [Paraview] vector plot with multiblock dataset. possible bug or
	dataset issue?
Message-ID: <64626.160.75.142.243.1488979739.squirrel@webmail.be.itu.edu.tr>



Hi All,

I have some weird observation with 5.3RC2 when i try to create
visualisation of vector field that is coming from multiblock dataset (has
4x4 decomposition). The problem is that in the simple visualization
pipeline such as Calculator -> Glyph, i could barely see or pick the
boundaries of the individual blocks which is not good. Then i tried to add
MergeBlocks filter just after Calculator and try to visualize data with
Glyph. In this case, it fixes the boundary problem (at least it seems like
that). But, when i play with the Glyph Mode property and change it such as
Every Nth Point and set as 3 then i could again see the boundaries with
flat vectors. I just wonder that is it a bug or related with the dataset
itself? It was also exist in earlier versions of the PV such as 5.2.
Anyway,a simple dataset and also the state to reproduce the problem can be
retrieved from following link,

https://www.dropbox.com/s/1chvdmehqzuslmj/vector_issue.tar.gz?dl=0

If anyone has any other multiblock dataset (with vector field) that could
test the same pipeline, then it could be easy to find the source of the
problem (PV or dataset itself). Thanks,

Regards,

--ufuk

I created a uniform grid:

https://gist.github.com/daviddoria/99fa99c52aa07ee78b7e7412e74d592f
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8yIfGqnlfSoNTNKWWtua1pEUTA

Using the vtkXMLImageDataWriter seemed to write the same type of
vtkGhostType array (shown in the cell data in Paraview), but Paraview
doesn't seem to respect the blanking - all 8 voxels are drawn.

Any other ideas?

David

Hi Paraviewers,

I want to export tables as CSV for points. However, even with
"OnlyReportSelectionStatistics
= 0", I am still getting statistics rather than values.

Utkarsh's fix for cells worked but, changing the FieldType from "CELL" to
"POINT" throws an error. Is there a different method I can use?

I am not sure what error you're getting `source.FieldType = "POINT"`
worked just fine for me.

Hello,

I am finding that the volume rendering is not working with

OSPRay Renderer not working with ParaView 5.3.0-RC3.

The volume render sample that I am testing looks fine

when rendered with the default renderer, but when I switch to the 

OSPRay volume renderer, then nothing is shown.

Has anyone managed to volume render data, using 

the OSPRay renderer with ParaView 5.3.0-RC3?

Thanks,

Joe

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF Multiblock limit on number of blocks shown in
	Hierarchy
Message-ID: <CA+yV-vCwJECzD2UnQO2_6eLxVyDA7fGRT8iEGW3XyP38DHLXzw@mail.gmail.com>

We use XDMF to output multiple unstructured blocks from our CFD code within
a Spatial Collection.

If 998 or fewer blocks are output in the collection all of the individual
blocks are displayed in the Blocks and Hierarchy tabs in the main
Properties tab when loading the grid.  This allows the user the select only
the blocks of interest.

If 999 or more blocks are output in the collection, only the containing
collection grid is shown in the Blocks and Hierarchy tabs.  In this case
the user cannot select the individual blocks of interest.

I've attached two simple XDMF grids for reference.

The same limitations on block selection occur when using Python to read the
grid.

Is this a limitation for all multiblock readers in ParaView or XDMF
specific?  Is there anyway to extend this limit to a higher value?

A typical use case is to define a spatial region of interest in a Python
script, read the XDMF file directly to determine the datasets that contain
the grids (in HDF5 format) then loop over these datasets and query each
block's bounds using h5py to see if they lie within the region of
interest.  If they do, then we load them in Paraview by setting the
GridStatus to the appropriate list of grids.  As mentioned above, this
fails when the main grid collection has more than 998 blocks in it.
A workaround could be to write out a temporary XDMF file based on the list
of grids required, but hopefully there is a simpler solution.

As a final note, for all of these cases we use the XDMF2 reader.  With the
XDMF3 reader neither of the supplied grids display the block hierarchy that
we require.

Thanks,
Andy

For the Xdmf3 reader, does it simply not display anything or does it not display correctly?

From the files you attached, I see the grid/subgrid structure, but there is no data inside each item. I would guess that the Xdmf3 reader sees the empty grid and simply doesn't load it.

David,

I can not send my data set,
But I am experiencing similar problems
With one of visit's sample data sets.

curv3d.silo (A multi-block containing a structured curvilinear grid)

I clip it and then render it with the default volume renderer

and it works, but then when I turn on OSPRay it fails. (crashes)

Strangely enough it also fails (does not renderer visibly) in the default 
renderer when I do not first clip it.


My data which is failing is instead a large unstructured grid with cell/Point 
arrays

They visualize ok with the default Volume renderer but are invisible with the

OSPRay volume renderer. I have not yet found a sample I can share with you 
that has the same

behavior. I will see if I can get you one though. Do you know of any similar 
publicly available samples?


I have also tried the vtk analyze sample data

S01_epi_r01_001.img
S01_epi_r01_001.hdr

Which are image (uniform rectangular grids)

S01_epi_r01_001 renderers correctly with both the default volume renderer

and the OSPRay one.

Thanks,

Joe

Thanks Joe.

I'll take a look at the silo data tomorrow and see what I can find.

For the large ugrid data, if you can tell me the size and number/type of
arrays, that would help diagnose and/or allow me to make something to
replicate the behavior.

Another thing that will help isolate is if you can try with 5.1 and or 5.2
and tell me if the behavior changed. If so I should be able to pinpoint
what change broke it.

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to open .dat file in paraview
Message-ID: <CABxKrcrexWQpLaHTnHu+EppKLPv0LxyAyScLyHCUPvMMVDusqg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All ,

I was trying to open fluent case and data file in paraview but I am getting
this error "Warning: In
/build/buildd/paraview-4.0.1/VTK/IO/Geometry/vtkFLUENTReader.cxx, line 423

vtkFLUENTReader (0x3627890): Unable to open dat file."




Please help me to resolve this issue.




Regards,

Hi Brennen,

This is not the error message but the warning. If dat file does not
exist in the same directory as the cas, the reader is working
correctly. Otherwise dat file name may be different from the cas file
because vtkFLUENTReader uses the exactly the same name for both cas
and dat files.

Thanks,
yoshimi

Just remembering now that OSPRay (currently) only has volume rendering
implemented for image data.

Please try the resample to image filter and that should look OK in OSPRay.

Also - please file an issue on gitlab to remind me to make the UI warn
whenever ParaView hands OSPRay something incompatible rather than just
rendering nothing.

Message-ID: <TY1PR06MB0766D32784E037170F2799DEAD210@TY1PR06MB0766.apcprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

I am currently use ParaView version 4.1, to analyse vtk data. I want to export a group of data file from vtk into csv. However, there are about 900 data file in that group, and I don't think I could export them one by one. Do you know is there any way I could select them all and export them together at one time?  I cannot find relevant information in guidebook of version 4.1, and I am wondering is this due to the limitation of the old version?

Many Thanks,
Stan

David,

I can not send my data set,
But I am experiencing similar problems
With one of visit's sample data sets.

curv3d.silo (A multi-block containing a structured curvilinear grid)

I clip it and then render it with the default volume renderer

and it works, but then when I turn on OSPRay it fails. (crashes)

Strangely enough it also fails (does not renderer visibly) in the default
renderer when I do not first clip it.


My data which is failing is instead a large unstructured grid with cell/Point
arrays

They visualize ok with the default Volume renderer but are invisible with the

OSPRay volume renderer. I have not yet found a sample I can share with you
that has the same

behavior. I will see if I can get you one though. Do you know of any similar
publicly available samples?


I have also tried the vtk analyze sample data

S01_epi_r01_001.img
S01_epi_r01_001.hdr

Which are image (uniform rectangular grids)

S01_epi_r01_001 renderers correctly with both the default volume renderer

and the OSPRay one.

Thanks,

Joe

        Hello,

        I am finding that the volume rendering is not working with

        OSPRay Renderer not working with ParaView 5.3.0-RC3.

        The volume render sample that I am testing looks fine

        when rendered with the default renderer, but when I switch to the

        OSPRay volume renderer, then nothing is shown.

        Has anyone managed to volume render data, using

        Thanks,

You can try doing the following in the GUI's Python shell (starting out
with the reader as the active source):
ii = ImageDataToUniformGrid()
ii.SelectInputScalars = ['CELLS', 'vtkGhostType']
Show()
Render()

This still shows the ghost cells but if you do operations like slice or cut
it will not include these cells. Note that the ImageDataToUniformGrid
filter has an option to Reverse whether zero/non-zero is to be interpreted
as a blanked cell.

Subject: [Paraview] Help: How to convert a group of vtk data files at
 one time though ParaView
Message-ID: <15C22232-552C-4C2B-9A27-43C35F2C095F@sandia.gov>

Stan,

I don?t know if this functionality goes all the way back to version 4.1 (I only tried back to 4.3), but if you load your vtk data as a time series then you can similarly write them out as a time series of csv files.

Assuming that your vtk files are written as a numeric series (e.g. file001.vtk, file002.vtk, file003.vtk, ?), ParaView will interpret that as a file series. When you click on the file series in the browser to open it, ParaView only actually reads in the first file. If you hit the play button, ParaView will load your files one by one as an animation over time.

If you have data in a time series like that, you can write out a series of csv files as a time series. Simply click on Save Data, specify a csv file name in the file browser, and then in the next dialog box check the box for ?Write All Time Steps?. ParaView will then write out a series of numbered csv file, one per time step, which corresponds to each of your input files.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Help: How to convert a group of vtk data files at one time though ParaView

Dear all,

I am currently use ParaView version 4.1, to analyse vtk data. I want to export a group of data file from vtk into csv. However, there are about 900 data file in that group, and I don't think I could export them one by one. Do you know is there any way I could select them all and export them together at one time?  I cannot find relevant information in guidebook of version 4.1, and I am wondering is this due to the limitation of the old version?

Many Thanks,
Stan

As I said, click on the ?Save Data? toolbar button (or select File -> Save Data). This will give you an option to save the data from the vtk file as a csv file.

Hello Ken,



Really thank you for your reply.



Yes, my data files are written as a numeric series, and I notice that ParaView will load all of them when I press play button.

However, I have a confusion. I am not sure about the meaning of "write out", do you mean export?  I obtained those files from my colleague with another simulation software, this is why I want to convert (or export) those series data file with ParaView. I will try your method, and thank you for your kind reply.

Best regards,
Stan

As the error states, currently you cannot save Python state or export
Catalyst state files when trace is active.

Yes. My first reaction was same and i checked the tracing but it was not
active. So, the error must be related with something else. By the way, is
any particular filter could trigger this error. Is there any restriction
out there when we are trying to use co-processing?

Thanks,

That's odd, that sounds like a bug. What does you pipeline look like?
To you can steps that I can use to reproduce this issue? If so, it
would be great if you report an issue on the issue tracker here:

Python 3 is supported with 5.3 (except for ParaViewWeb components). We
have dashboards testing it too. There still may be some leftovers, so
please report if you catch anything that we missed.

Hi,

Thanks for your help. I opened issue about that

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17270

I think that the tracing error is triggered by another one. Please see
issue for detailed information.

Greetings,

Is there a way with the calculator or something similar in paraview to grab the field value at a particular time step, so that I could then subtract it off of the time varying field?



Thanks,



Alan

This is complex but can be done with the time support in VTK?s pipeline. However, it requires the filter to hold state from one call of RequestData to the next. This is simple enough in C++, but I?m not sure how you do it in the Python interpreter (used by the programmable filter). You could declare a global variable, but are you guaranteed to get the same interpreter instance each call? That?s a question for Utkarsh.

Did you try to set up your own version of twisted in your system python?
When you illustrated how twisted was properly set up, you did it with
"python", but your start script runs pvpython.  I wonder if maybe your
system python twisted is conflicting (or overriding) with the one provided
by pvpython?  That's just a guess based on a quick read.

Hope this helps,
Scott

Hi,

Thanks for the answer.

I completely removed the twisted from my machine and the error continue. In
fact the error occurred before his installation. I installed twitted to try
to solve it

Any other ideas?

Cheers,

What version of ParaView are you using?  One you built yourself (if so, how
old), or a release binary?

Subject: [Paraview] Crash occurs after clicking "File" then "Open"
Message-ID: <CAHqis9ASQ_j4OLNiBCvi9P3HiQ7EmOBaRfzgEN8mHskunMz1kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've compiled Paraview from source, v. 5.3.0 RC3 using Qt5 for the GUI. The
application however crashes on one of my computers when I simply click
"File" then "Open." It seems that the crash happens when it needs to bring
up the dialog for selecting a file. It also happens if I do these menu
clicks:

1. "File", "Load Window Layout"
2. "File", "Load State"
3. "File", "Save State"

As you can see, the crash appears to happen whenever a directory dialog is
expected to appear. Should I send a crash report to diagnose this problem?

I should also mention that on another computer, this problem does NOT
appear for the same build of Paraview. The problem seems unique to a
particular computer I'm using.

Regards,
Roman

Subject: [Paraview] Issues with OpenGL2 support for off-screen Mesa
In-Reply-To: <1610574620.163154086.1487957114108.JavaMail.root@zimbra10-e2>
References: <1610574620.163154086.1487957114108.JavaMail.root@zimbra10-e2>
Message-ID: <1489188960.14532.1.camel@free.fr>

Hello,

I made some progress using OpenGL2 for offs-screen Mesa on a Debian 8-based
system:

I don't need to compile my code or ParaView in static: compiling everything with
dyanmic libraries works, as long as I link everything together instead of
loading a plugin (consisting of some Code_Saturne libraries, ParaView Libraries,
and OSMesa/Gallium).

So it seems some things re not initialized correctly when I load ParaView and
OSMesa as a plugin, so I'm not took sure the problem comes from ParaView,
OSMesa, or LLVM. I tried OSMesa 13.0.3 and 17.0.1, and LLVM 3.5 (packaged with
Debian 8) and 3.9 (local build), with identical results.

I also tried using RTLD_NOW and even RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL instead of the usual
 RTLD_LAZY when using dlopen, with no difference in behavior (I have not tried
RTLD_DEEPBIND).

Has anyone encountered similar issues or does anyone have an idea what could be
missing in the initialization stage using dlopen for a plugin linked with
Catalyst ? I do not encounter this issue on an Arch-Linux-based system, but
encounter it on a Debian 8 ("Jessie") system ?

Using a plugin is not an absolute must, but it would be preferable if I managed
to get it working again with that build option.

Best regards,

	Yvan

Alan,

So in summary, yes it is possible to do this with the programmable filter. What you do is check the time to see if it equals the target time step. If so, save the array from the desired field in a global variable. Then on other time steps do the difference. 

You may have noticed I'm not giving you code. This is because I am too lazy to spend the hour or so getting it to work.

Do you have Dell Backup and Recovery (DBaR) tools installed on your
system? If so, the crash may be related to an issue with DBaR at Qt 5.
You may need to update DBaR to the latest version. See [1] for
details.

Dear all

The camera can perfectly follow data when I add it, but when I scale the
axis by 10 times in x and y directions(by using the transforming options in
display), the camera is unable to follow data. It seems that it still
thinks the data is where it was originally. Am I missing a step after
scaling?

Thanking you

Try using the "Transform" filter instead. The transformation
properties on t he "Display" only affect the rendering, not the data.
The "Follow Data" functionality currently uses the data bounds, rather
than the transformed bounds -- which should be fixed; so please feel
free to report a bug on the issue tracker [1]. The Transform filter
transform the data itself, as a result, the current "Follow Data"
implementation should be able to follow it better.

Subject: [Paraview] Python API to set color palette?
Message-ID: <CAHQkNjQJP64fKN1acuRH19fvAkr=aQ4OFsTjHoiuBu-=37QikA@mail.gmail.com>

I don't find a dedicated Python function to set color palette.
It does not appear to be an option to the simple.SaveScreenshot function
either.

Or, can I directly set each color available in the Edit -> Settings ->
Color Palette?

There isn't one currently. I am actively working on a fix for the
same, however. It should be available in the ParaView release
scheduled for May/June 2017.

Sorry, I should have mentioned that I'm running ParaView on a Mac Pro
computer, with OS X 10.11.6. The computer does not have DBaR.

Another Mac Pro I've used, with OS X 10.11.6, does not reproduce the same
crash I'm seeing on this particular computer. Again, I could send a crash
report if that would help.

Roman,

A crash report would be helpful.

Thank you,

Are you sure, there is no twisted library in your system python?

Hi,

I just want to add additional color map to ParaView but I don't have
access to GUI (it is installed to a cluster with NVIDIA EGL support). So,
I just wonder that which file must be edited to include colormap manually.
Is it lib/site-packages/paraview/ColorMaps.xml? If so I could not see my
new colormap in that file when I look at my laptop installation. It must
be somewhere else but where?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] 3d Contour plot on cylindrical grid - inaccurate
 contours with prefered direction in toroidal angle
Message-ID: <58C677EB.4080306@uibk.ac.at>

Dear all,

i'm for a long time experiencing a contour plot problem in 3d. Our 
scalar data is on a cylindrical (R,Z,\varphi) grid. A 3d contour of the 
data produces correct "2d contours" in the RZ plane, but the contours 
are elongated in the \varphi direction, even if the data prefers another 
direction.

Image here:
ftp://ftp.uibk.ac.at/private/c7441143_20170403_7512b21ed0886d37bdf38b41d4056946

The prefered direction is aligned to a given vector field.

Is there a way to improve the 3d contours with a filter in paraview or 
maybe with the help of the given vector field?

best regards
markus

Alan,

Wouldn't it be possible to use ForceTime filter on the dataset at your desired timepoint, then make it and the original dataset as 2 inputs to a programmable filter.   You should then be able to subtract the variable from the two inputs and get what you want.

Am I missing somehow that this wouldn't work?

That's exactly how the force time filter is expected to be used. It could
be more easy to use a PythonCalculator instead of a Programmable Filter. to
obtain the same resultats.

Yes, I'm sure there is no twisted library in my system python.

I rollback to version 5.2.0 and everything works fine.

Can be a bug?

If your intention is to make the colormaps available to the client
connecting to a pvserver running on your cluster, then alas, there's no way
currently. You'll have to provide your color maps to the users so that can
import them on their desktops.

If your intention is to use the color map is python scripts, then you can
do the following:

from paraview.simple import *

ImportPresets(filename='/tmp/MyCustom.json')


# To use the color map, get color transfer function/color map for an
array e.g. 'RTData'

rTDataLUT = GetColorTransferFunction('RTData')


# Apply a preset using its name. Note this may not work as expected
when presets have duplicate names.

rTDataLUT.ApplyPreset('MyCustomColorMap', True)

Hum, that is weird.

It could be a bug.

Do you mind doing a diff between the 2 python modules between 5.2 and 5.3.

Twisted should be the same. Then on the ParaView side, I'm not expecting
much difference.

Thanks for tracking that down...

Subject: [Paraview] Potential Memory Error in CAVE mode
Message-ID: <CAA7GnU=HTTTajWwKexxDisJQDLLL_1UbR0Syms+4TyMcJdGV_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi again community!

I have been testing Paraview 5.2.0 in a CAVE mode with pretty big data (1+
billion points) while remotely connected to some HPC servers.

PROBLEM: In CAVE mode, I get the below error when I try to change mode from
"Outline" to "Points". Same issue while doing other things as well like
applying a Glyph (Sphere), etc.

ERROR: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
what():  std::bad_alloc

The same issue doesn't occur if I don't use the CAVE mode in that I simple
connect a Paraview client with the HPC servers and don't pass any pvx file.

I read some similar online discussions pointing towards memory issues but
it's hard for me to believe that given  a) I have hundreds of gigs of
memory and most of it remains empty even with my big data loaded, b) the
issue doesn't occur when not in a CAVE mode.

Anyone experienced any such similar issues?

Thanks for all the help!

Dear sam key,



thank you for the fast reply. Actually we transform the R,Z,\varphi coordinates to cartesian x,y,z coordinates via filters in paraview. This is also shown in the picturre. However, we see the same problem in cylindrical coordinates. Here, the isosurface still prefers the /varphi direction.



2d contours in the R,Z plane are accurate.



Best regards

Betreff:Re: [Paraview] 3d Contour plot on cylindrical grid - inaccurate contours with prefered direction in toroidal angle



Markus,

Unless I am mistaken, PV works with rectangular Cartesian coordinates
(x,y,z)  If you supplied PV with cylindrical coordinates (r,z,\varphi) ,
and used a slice plane that contained the r=0.0 axis, then the two
cylindrical coordinates r and z would form a 2-D planar rectangular
Cartesian coordinate system. In this case, one would get an "accurate"
2-D contour of the data contained in the r,z-plane.

To get true 3-D contours (also known as, isosurfaces) from the
(r,z,\varphi) coordinates, as you write out the simulation results from
your software to the datum set for PV, use a transformation to convert
(r,z,\varphi) into (x,y,z).

Hope this helps

Sam Key

Hi All,

I'm working to compile the paraview superbuild(5.2.0) on OpenSuse13.2 with
osMesa enabled(for HPC related CPU in-situ computing). I'm seeing a compile
error:

[ 44%] Performing build step for 'pythonsetuptools'

I thought that I requested the superbuild to not use my system python, but
it appears that it is searching /usr/lib64/python2.7  for something that it
fails to read.


My current compile script(bolded section pertains to python):

Roman,

Thanks for the error report, it provides some useful clues. It looks
like ParaView is crashing when collecting information about the
mounted volumes on your system. Do you have an external drive or
network file system mounted on the Mac Pro that is crashing? If so,
could you try to unmount it and see if ParaView runs as expected?

Barring that, are there any non-Latin characters in the names of the
volumes mounted on the Mac in question?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi!

What would be the best approach in order to achieve this configurations:

1) Remote rendering in a cluster and one client with 6 viewports(Cubemap)

2) Remote rendering in a cluster and X clients with X viewports

Thanks in advance.

Hello.
Anyway, ParaView has not full support for Fluent files (cas + dat). It
doesn't see all the variables (at least in versions up to 5.0.1 RC2 that I
use, although I know that I should update to 5.2 or 5.3). Instead of
reading Fluent format, I convert to EnSight (in Fluent) and then read in
ParaView.

1) ParaView in client server mode with remote rendering enabled, connected
to a pvserver on your cluster. Multiple viewports are not a problem.
2) X ParaView in client server mode with remote rendering enabled,
connected to a pvserver in multi-client mode on your cluster. Multiple
viewports are not a problem.

Python modules are different from 5.2 to 5.3

For example, inside* lib/python2.7/site-packages, *the version 5.2 has the
modules *autobahn, zope and twisted*, and the version 5.3 does not.

I tried to copy the twisted and zope modules from version 5.2 to version
5.3, but a got others errors.

By now, I reverted to release 5.2 in production environment.

 Cheers,

Looking at the superbuild, it appears that when ParaViewWeb got moved
from ParaView into its own repository, the flags that turned on pvweb
got removed and now there's nothing enabling those modules in ParaView's
build anymore. Do those packages need to be shipped with ParaView at all
now? If so, we'll need to add them to the superbuild specifically. If
not, some flag will need to be used to turn them on.

Hi Ben,

Those modules are needed and should be shipped with ParaView.

I believe the issue might be in the ParaView project itself not in its
superbuild.
I'm guessing, I messed up a dependency when I split the python code between
python 2+3 and python 2 only. The python 2 one should depend on those
libraries but not the python 2+3 code.

Let me know how I can help to fix that,

Thanks,

Seb

Colleagues:

After installing 5.3.0-RC2 and now 5.3.0 (both after using 5.2.0), the Plot
gridlines have become almost invisible (see attached screenshot).  There
also appears to be a radial gradient about the center.

I run a 3840x2160 display on OS X 10.11.6.

Is this expected behavior?

Please contact me with any comments, questions, or concerns.

Joel,
Gridlines really are too light.  I will add a bug.  Thanks for reporting.

They can be changed trivially.  Make a 2d plot.  Properties tab.  Advanced.  Click Left Axis Grid Color.  Make it darker.  Repeat for Bottom Axis..

	individual polylines?
Message-ID: <CAHQkNjS+YzfCbxVCqMqtzpQ04B0Peyn1oR2cJe01Ne__gcmd+w@mail.gmail.com>

If the IntegrationDirection is set to BOTH, the two segments of the
streamlines from the seed might terminate for different reasons. For
example, one end might end due to STAGNATION, the other due
to OUT_OF_DOMAIN. When coloring by ReasonForTermination, then the two
segments are colored differently.

My question is: Can a user create more cases of ReasonForTermination so
that we can tell examples like above? Or, how can I select individual
streamlines by its SeedIds (I tried IdsSelection, but that appears to work
for cell/point data only, not for polydata?)

My current solution is to use threshold filter to select lines in the
different regions and apply different solid colors. But it would be nice if
I can handle a few different cases more directly, even if that involves
some coding in C++ or Python.

Thanks.

Alan,

Thanks for the quick response.  Having changed the colors to black
(#000000), I see the attached.  There still appears to be some regional
washout (on this end).  If you see it in the screenshot, I suspect it's
*not* a hardware issue.

Thanks again,
Joel

Hi,

What version of ParaView are you using?

>From my testing it looks like each direction for the stream tracer seeds
has a separate reason for termination in PV 5.3 -- see the attached image.
The domain is a box with length 20 on each side, the velocity is [1, 0, 0],
the seeds are a line source going from min to max of the bounding box
([-10, -10, -10] to [10,10,10]).  The red is for when the maximum
streamline length has exceeded my specified max length of 5 and the blue is
for when the streamline exited the domain.

Is there a case where the same reason for termination value is being used
for multiple termination criteria?

You can use the SeedIds cell data array in the Threshold filter or use the
Edit->Find Data option to select a given streamline from the seed id.

Cheers,
Andy

I believe I was not clear.

The 6 viewports I want to achieve cannot be in the GUI. They have to be
separate like when using a .pvx file in the server.

The problem is when using a .pvx the viewports are open in the remote
machine, I want them to be open in the client machine.

Best regards,
Leonardo Pessanha

Thank you, Andy.


I):

I'm using 5.3 and your example is what I would get. But what I want is a
way to tell if the two streamlines from the same seed point are terminated
for different reasons. It might be more clear from the image I attached. I
would like to tell

1) closed field lines that have both ends terminated on the sphere surface
(the red tubes)
2) semi-open field lines that have on the ends terminated on the sphere
surface, the other goes out-of-domain (the red and blue tubes)
3) open field lines that have both ends out-of-bound (not shown in the
image, would be blue tubes)

(Or, ideal, I would be happier to be able to tell if the open end of the
semi-open field lines goes out of the southern or northern bound)

Indeed, I saw people doing this in Mayavi-based python (see
https://github.com/KristoforMaynard/Viscid/blob/dev/viscid/cython/streamline.pyx
and
http://kristoformaynard.github.io/Viscid/docs/master/examples/mayavi.html).
One obstacle I can see is that ParaView (or vtk?) probably treats the two
streamlines from the same seed point independently, thus it won't be easy
to tag them together.

II):

I realize that I am demanding too much. I tried your way of `Find Data`,
and now I am able to manually choose individual streamlines, which is
already helpful.

A follow-up question: How to perform the `Find Data` by `criteria` in
Python? I tried to record a macro but only got

extractSelection1 = ExtractSelection(Input=tube1,
    Selection=None)

Please add the tag to the superbuild.

BTW: My whole office is grateful for the reload (F5) and autoscaled warping of PV 5.2 (at least compared to PV 5.0)!! :)

Thanks to the folks at kitware for the really cool software!

In Python you can do something like create a Threshold filter to

# create a new 'Threshold'

threshold1 = Threshold(Input=streamTracer1)

threshold1.Scalars = ['CELLS', 'SeedIds']

threshold1.ThresholdRange = [1.0, 2.0]
threshold1.CellData['ReasonForTermination'].GetRange()

This will give you the range of values in the threshold output for the
ReasonForTermination array. You can query the number of seeds for the
high resolution line source with <streamtracer>.SeedType.Resolution

Sorry,

this doesn't work for me:

I start with a clean directory
mkdir pv53
cd pv53
git clone --recursive 
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild.git
cd paraview-superbuild
git fetch --tags origin
git checkout v5.3.0

-> error: pathspec 'v5.3.0' did not match any file(s) known to git.

In this case you will need to have a render server running on your client,
and a data server running on your cluster.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Server_Configuration#Case_Three:_Simple_connection_to_a_data-server.2Frender-server

This should work, but will definitelly not be ideal since whole dataset
will be transferred from the data server to the render server.

I do not follow. Are you expecting to see the border between blocks
highlighted for some reason? There's no reason to expect that, unless
that was a characteristic of your data.

I don't think I see anything particularly different if I use merge
blocks or not. Note, if your "Glyph Mode" is not "All Points" there
may be minor differences between which points get selected for
glyphing, but that's just coincidental, and any patterns you notice in
that case are likely to be aliasing artifacts due to subsampling.

If you're referring to the band in the attached image, then this is
just an aliasing artifact. Otherwise,  here too I am not sure which
flat vectors are you referring to.

You may indeed be running into a limitation of current implementation.
To support fast rendering requirements for CAVE, ParaView duplicates
geometry between all rendering ranks. Seems like you're running out of
memory during that process.

Faiz,

Can you remind us about your setup again so that we can see if something
can be done to reduce per rank memory requirements? Also, I am assuming the
current setup works if the data is small?

Ruben,

(apologies for the delayed reply)

In the VTU XML, you can add component names as follows:

 <DataArray type="Float32" Name="Normals" NumberOfComponents="3"
ComponentName0="XX" ComponentName1="YY" ....>

for each of the components.

I am not sure how you can avoid the aliasing effect, expect maybe
glyphing all points or using the "Uniform Spatial Distribution" mode
and playing the seed and maximum number of points.

Alternatively, you can try different modes. e.g. attached is a
SurfaceLIC result along with SurfaceLIC + sparser Glyph result.

Message-ID: <HE1PR0101MB2473CFCAC575F13FA2ABD804E3270@HE1PR0101MB2473.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Good morning,
I wrote a python script in order to process my data and to render the result at the end.
To do this last step I call

Render(myRenderView)
Interact()

and the rendering window is open at the top left corner of my screen.
How can I change the position of the rendering window?
Thanks a lot for any hint.
Best regards,

It not really well supported, but something like the following may
work on linux/windows:

window = view.GetRenderWindow()
window.SetPosition(450, 0)

Subject: [Paraview] Help on SPHVolumeInterpolator
Message-ID: <D4EEDA63.14C0F%cellinger@lanl.gov>

Hello,

I have astrophysical SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) data that I want to interpolate for visualization in ParaView. I've found the SPHVolumeInterpolator filter to do that, but can this filter handle non-constant smoothing lengths of SPH particles for the interpolation? If so, how is this set? Due to the nature of the object I'm trying to visualize (a star), the smoothing lengths varies over a few orders of magnitude.

Thank you for any help,

Carola

the answer is "soon". ParaView's GUI already enables the setting of the so-called Cuttoff Array. In the GUI (I am assuming you use version 5.3), there should be a setting for the Density and the Mass arrays. And just below it, is the 3rd setting for the "smooting length" array. Unfortunately, we are waiting on a patch to the underlying VTK class vtkSPHInterpolator.cxx which currently has a small error preventing the correct setting.

By the way, I strongly suggest that you use a version of ParaView compiled with OpenMP, or TBB. You will see great speed-ups on a multi-core node, since the Point Interpolators (Line, Plane, Volume) are all parallelized on-the-node.

Until the patch is merged into VTK, and ParaView picks up the change, you will be limited to setting the Density and Mass arrays. (Unless you compile your own ParaView, and I can tell you how to edit the source code to enable the smoothing array.)

Message-ID: <CAHQkNjR0hj94tfNiP0k0pgUA3nwnJcTc=oamR9Oxt-myomBLcQ@mail.gmail.com>

By using the arrow glyph filter on the lines/tubes, the arrows are often
slightly dislocated (and thus slightly misaligned) from the tubes
themselves (see the attached image).

In comparison, I am trying to get images like
http://www.tecplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fstream.jpg or
https://i.stack.imgur.com/z8nkm.png

Logically, the arrows could have been an attribute of the
streamlines/stream tubes?

Hi,

How does it look if you Glyph the streamlines themselves instead of the
tubes?

Hi Andy,

The results are similar if I apply glyph on streamlines directly (see the
attached image).

I guess the difficulty part is that arrow heads are not easily centered on
lines/tubes?

I think it is because you have set the Shaft radius to 0. The start of the
arrow doesn't appear because of this and I'm suspecting that the start of
the arrow is centered along the streamline. Maybe try using using either a
non-zero value for the Shaft radius that is bigger than the Tube radius or
use the Cone glyph type instead.

Just to slightly thread jack for a second, will there be continued
development for both Oculus and Vive? I'm leaning towards a Vive and it
looks like that was the one originally recommended.

Maybe more importantly, and thoughts on whether we're going to see this
working on Linux any time soon. It seems like vrserver is working on linux
but there is no full VRsteam support.

Anyone had success using a Vive on a *nix machine with a windows VM (I mean
usable success, with minimum latency).

Thanks Ken!

To control spacing of the glyphs, on the Glyph's properties panel you
can change the Glyph Mode to "Every Nth Point" and then tweak the
"Stride".

Thanks Utkarsh and Ashish for your replies. CC'ing some more people since
it may be of interest to them too.

Writing pointwise for clarity.

1. Our pipeline involves TurboVNC, VirtualGL, and ParaView 5.2.0. We have a
4 walled CAVE-like system where each wall is driven by two projectors. We
are doing mono and not stereo. The Paraview client connects to the remote
HPC servers which have 512 GB of memory and GPUs. The data we have is in
PVTU format.

2. I have ruled out TurboVNC and VirtualGL as the issue since it all works
along with them in the pipeline when I don't use the CAVE mode. But can't
be 100% certain about that either.

3. This setup works for small data sets (I have tested for a few million
points) but I don't know what's the limit above which this error occurs. I
can do some more testing to find out though.

3. Question: if this is a memory issue, I am assuming memory per CPU issue?
Because system wide I have 512 GB and at no point while the data is trying
to load I see more than 200 GB consumed. I mean, it could be a spike in
memory and ParaView crashes so quickly that I can't see it in /proc/meminfo
but I am not sure.

4. Question: If it is indeed a memory per CPU issue, do you think using
more processes can help divide the workload? And on that note, my second
question is that is it even possible to use more processes than displays
defined in the PVX file? I have read about tiled displays and using tdx and
tdy flags but that won't work in a CAVE mode I assume? Currently, I only
use 8 processes, each driving one projector. But if there is a way to bump
up my processes while providing only 8 displays in the PVX file, please do
let me know.

5. Question: With regards to #4, I was actually trying to do tiled
rendering in the sense that for each display in my PVX file (attached), I
was defining two geometries (basically half of each). I did load up small
data successfully like this and was able to use 16 processes, but ParaView
still crashed with memory issues with the big data.

6. Question: On a related note, when I check the memory inspector while
ParaView is connected in a CAVE mode, I see the attached picture
(pvserver.png). This seems off since though I request 16 processes in this
case, I see every process id twice in the memory inspector and apparently,
only the first 8 processors work and the rest 8 don't do anything?

7. I just tested using my updated pvx file in which I tried tiling the
walls and loaded a 100million points PVTU file, and I got different
warnings and errors as attached (errors.png). I don't get any errors with a
10 million data points file and everything else same. I think these errors
maybe due to  how MPI implements and handles memory? Not sure again.

Sorry if it is too much information in one email but just trying to figure
out if this is indeed a limitation in the current implementation of
ParaView in a CAVE mode. And if so, I would have to significantly cut down
on my data size to get any results.

Appreciate all the help!

Indeed, using Cone glyph gives much better results, and tweaking by
"Stride" is very helpful!

Thank you, Andy and Utkarsh.

Message-ID: <CALiW70fY1cTdN4WhQmx-LSRwZeu+=-Y4YQ7i=adrSqMhm4Qp2g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Please find attached two images that show my OpenFOAM model in ParaView
5.3.0. It was the standard Binary Installers package downloaded from the
website for 64 bit linux (OpenSUSE Leap 42.1).

The correct number of cells is reported in the information tab (when
compared to OpenFOAM's checkMesh result). The patches are
all rendered nicely, but it looks like some cells are missing in the
domain/volume.

Is there some setting that I need to apply?

Please note that the mesh has about 25.8 million cells, for smaller meshes
this was not a problem. A colleague had similar issues.
ParaView version 5.1.2 did not have this problem, ParaView 5.2 was not able
to open the OpenFOAM files at all.

Best regards,
Tom

Hi Tom,

Sorry, no answers - only questions/ideas:

Is decompose polyhedral on or off? How do things look using the other setting?
If the number of cells corresponds to checkMesh - then you either have no polyhedra, or decompose polyhedral is off.
If you use foamToVTK (with and without -poly) and then read the VTK file back in, how does that compare?
Using foamToEnsight could be yet another check, but without the option to decompose polyhedra.

In most paraview versions I've had issues with slicing through polyhedron (eg, from the motorBike tutorial).
The symptoms are either holes in the visual (like you have) or crashing the program. I haven't checked if this is better/worse in 5.3.0.

Cheers,
/mark

Hi Mark,

I have no polyhedral cells (hybrid tetrahedron/prism mesh), so I guess
changing "decompose polyhedral on/off" does not make sense. In fact the
smaller mesh that I tested with before did show the correct visualization
and that mesh had polyhedral/hexagonal cells. It did not matter whether I
used decompose polyhedral on/off. I also have experienced the slicing
issues from time to time with various paraview versions with polyhedral
meshes, but the effect was typically much less severe than in the current
situation.

Using foamToVTK (with and without the -poly option) does indeed work and
provides the correct visualization. So yes this can be a workaround for
now, but I than rather go back to 5.1.2.

Regards,
Tom

Hi Tom,

So if foamToVTK works, it sounds like a reader bug. Maybe somewhere where the prism order is getting swapped - or something else where the reader's cell modeller is getting into trouble.
It may not work, but if you try to export from paraview to VTK format (ie, use the OpenFOAM reader for reading). Then with some effort it might be able to identify which cells are different. Presumably the cell ordering will be preserved in both cases, but still not 100% trivial. Either way, we need to figure out which cell types are causing the issue, or an off-by-one of whatever.

Hi Mark,

I have no polyhedral cells (hybrid tetrahedron/prism mesh), so I guess changing "decompose polyhedral on/off" does not make sense. In fact the smaller mesh that I tested with before did show the correct visualization and that mesh had polyhedral/hexagonal cells. It did not matter whether I used decompose polyhedral on/off. I also have experienced the slicing issues from time to time with various paraview versions with polyhedral meshes, but the effect was typically much less severe than in the current situation.

Using foamToVTK (with and without the -poly option) does indeed work and provides the correct visualization. So yes this can be a workaround for now, but I than rather go back to 5.1.2.

Regards,
Tom

Hi Tom,

Sorry, no answers - only questions/ideas:

Is decompose polyhedral on or off? How do things look using the other setting?
If the number of cells corresponds to checkMesh - then you either have no polyhedra, or decompose polyhedral is off.
If you use foamToVTK (with and without -poly) and then read the VTK file back in, how does that compare?
Using foamToEnsight could be yet another check, but without the option to decompose polyhedra.

In most paraview versions I've had issues with slicing through polyhedron (eg, from the motorBike tutorial).
The symptoms are either holes in the visual (like you have) or crashing the program. I haven't checked if this is better/worse in 5.3.0.

Cheers,
/mark

Subject: [Paraview] Native OpenFOAM reader for ParaView 5.3.0 has some weird visualization issues.

Dear all,

Please find attached two images that show my OpenFOAM model in ParaView 5.3.0. It was the standard Binary Installers package downloaded from the website for 64 bit linux (OpenSUSE Leap 42.1).

The correct number of cells is reported in the information tab (when compared to OpenFOAM's checkMesh result). The patches are
all rendered nicely, but it looks like some cells are missing in the domain/volume.

Is there some setting that I need to apply?

Please note that the mesh has about 25.8 million cells, for smaller meshes this was not a problem. A colleague had similar issues.
ParaView version 5.1.2 did not have this problem, ParaView 5.2 was not able to open the OpenFOAM files at all.

Best regards,
Tom

Tom,

Do you have a dataset to reproduce this issue? There were changes in
the reader in this past release, so it's conceivable that it
introduced a bug.

What Jean said :-) The patch is waiting on me and I am waiting on deadlines
which will be clearing up shortly.

If you haven't seen these yet, it's worth reviewing these articles:

Hello,
I create two wavelets then change their representation to volume and
translating(20,0,0) one of the wavelets. Then after I turn around camera I
get this:[image: ?????????? ??????????? 1][image: ?????????? ??????????? 2]
It seems like the wavelet that was created first is not transparent at all.
Shouldn't it be the same picture when I turn camera around?
I managed to get the correct result when I appended two datasets but I
don't think that it is the right solution.

Best Regards,
Rustem

Multiple volume renderings are currently not supported in ParaView. There's
work ongoing that may make this possible in the future.

Hi Jean, and Will,

Thanks for the help! I think I might just wait until that patch is released. It sounds like that is not too far into the future, so that's the easiest way for me to go. :)

Cheers, Carola

Carola-

What Jean said :-) The patch is waiting on me and I am waiting on deadlines which will be clearing up shortly.

If you haven't seen these yet, it's worth reviewing these articles:
https://blog.kitware.com/point-and-smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics-sph-interpolation-in-vtk/

the answer is "soon". ParaView's GUI already enables the setting of the so-called Cuttoff Array. In the GUI (I am assuming you use version 5.3), there should be a setting for the Density and the Mass arrays. And just below it, is the 3rd setting for the "smooting length" array. Unfortunately, we are waiting on a patch to the underlying VTK class vtkSPHInterpolator.cxx which currently has a small error preventing the correct setting.

By the way, I strongly suggest that you use a version of ParaView compiled with OpenMP, or TBB. You will see great speed-ups on a multi-core node, since the Point Interpolators (Line, Plane, Volume) are all parallelized on-the-node.

Until the patch is merged into VTK, and ParaView picks up the change, you will be limited to setting the Density and Mass arrays. (Unless you compile your own ParaView, and I can tell you how to edit the source code to enable the smoothing array.)

Subject: [Paraview] Help on SPHVolumeInterpolator

Hello,

I have astrophysical SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) data that I want to interpolate for visualization in ParaView. I've found the SPHVolumeInterpolator filter to do that, but can this filter handle non-constant smoothing lengths of SPH particles for the interpolation? If so, how is this set? Due to the nature of the object I'm trying to visualize (a star), the smoothing lengths varies over a few orders of magnitude.

Thank you for any help,

Carola

Subject: [Paraview] Labeling axes for non-spatial data
Message-ID: <CAD6x9sOc4pXWYeGoLoXTs9Nz+CDzwzUgnU2Mj8XdcyF7A-14Bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to write out a data set that doesn't have any spatial variables (in
the physical sense of X,Y,Z. My three axes are independent variables that
we can call Z, S, C. They have no relation to any physical coordinates
whatsoever.

Is there a way to encode the information that  the axes should be labeled
as Z,S,C in the dataset? That way users who load the file would know
immediately what they are looking at instead of trying to work backwards to
figure out which variable maps to X,Y,Z.

The dataset is a simple set of regularly spaced points, and I was
considering the STRUCTURED_GRID format.

Thank you,

Subject: [Paraview] Spatial Collection Boundary Interpolation
Message-ID: <33c1ae9d-b66c-ff40-5681-b5694cd23bfa@ecp.fr>

Hello,

I have a question about loading spatial collections with XDMF. I have a 
collection of scalar fields (each saved as h5 files) and need to display 
them together as a single field. For example, a 2D global structured 
uniform grid is 64x64 cells, split into four 32x32 grids. The scalar 
data is simple cell-centered values, but I can't use the Attribute 
Center="Cell" mode because that seems to require more details like 
face/edge values and possibly the vertices. The Center="Node" method is 
simple and works since it requires only 1 scalar value per cell.

Below is the first portion of the xmf file I used to generate the 
attached image:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">

          <Grid Name="S1" GridType="Uniform">
             <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions="1 32 32"/>

                <DataItem Name="dXdYdZ" Format="XML" Dimensions="3"

                </DataItem>
             </Geometry>
             <Attribute Name="U1" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Node">
                <DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="8" Dimensions="1 
32 32" Format="HDF">
                   DATA_flow_0000_0000_0000.1.h5:/U1
                </DataItem>
             </Attribute>
             <Attribute Name="U2" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Node">
                <DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="8" Dimensions="1 
32 32" Format="HDF">
DATA_flow_0000_0000_0000.1.h5:/U2
                </DataItem>
             </Attribute>
          </Grid>
    ... (repeat for grids S2, S3, and S4)
       </Grid>
    </Domain>
</Xdmf>

See the attached image for the result. The *.h5 supplied data points lie 
at the intersections of the visible grid lines. All the data is present, 
but ParaView 5.3.0 isn't interpolating between the different fields in 
the spatial collection, leaving very apparent gaps of width "?x". How 
can I resolve this? I have also tried the JOIN function, but it's quite 
tricky for merging 2D/3D spatial collections. Any help you could provide 
would be greatly appreciated.

If there is no easy solution, I'll probably try parallel HDF5 to avoid 
the whole issue of xdmf spatial collections entirely.

Best regards,
-Dennis

   "Intel"

(with 5.3.0RC2), i fix the issue by upgrading cmake to 3.7.2 but now it is
not working. I also tried to use cmake-3.8.0-rc2 but still same error. I

Hi Burlen,

Your issue could be related with following,

https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/702934

I opened a bug report in Intel form and they found a bug in that
particular source file (pqPresetToPixmap.cxx). So, if you apply the fix
you might solve the problem but i am not sure.

I hope it helps,
Regards,

This is my fault. Sorry! After upgrading to cmake-3.8.0-rc2, it installs
without any problem.

Burlen,

I've created an issue for your report. It sure looks like a bug.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17305

Ufuk,

That fix turns out to already be in v5.3.0:

Subject: [Paraview] Labels in Custom Filters
Message-ID: <CAOJY6rc0hKNtrmRpNOqqym8-2up1gHvkFyhB+-CN8Wv5f=3j-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

In custom filters we can set some field labels and names. Why when we set
labels they become accessors instead of field names? Is it a bug or there
is some meaning behind this? It may be a problem when non-English users
create filters and set some labels using their native language. Of course
they can use SetPropertyWithName('name',value) but I do not think that it
is what they need.

Best Regards,
Rustem

Thank you guys. I poked around this morning and found the following:

The "BlueObeliskElements" is the only cmap in the default presets that 
triggers the issue. It has more values than can be displayed on a single 
line, and this is what triggers the FPE in the logic.

Enforcing a minimum swatch size(terminology from the code) prevents the 
FPE and seems to produce the desired result of displaying all of the 
cmap values in one line, although they are quite small.

a moment ago I pushed a patch onto gitlab demonstrating. Perhaps it or 
something like it could be back ported to the 5.3.0 branch?

ParaView now requires C++11 support and uses some newer CMake features to
detect this properly.  While this worked for gcc and clang for some time
with CMake, the Intel compiler did not have language feature support with
CMake until at least 3.6.

fyi, https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1476

it complains about clang-format, but it seems that the source file was 
not formatted in that way to begin with.

Burlen,

Thanks for the patch.

With regards to clang-format, we recently enabled automatic style
enforcement checks. This way to fix is to install clang-format, run
`git clang-format` in your ParaView source directory, amend your
commit, then force push it with `git gitlab-push -f`.

Subject: [Paraview] How to configure ParaView 5.2.0 to use off screen
	rendering?
Message-ID: <cd3d5e.28aaf.15ae0662a09.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hello,

I'm building ParaView 5.2.0 on a machine that uses NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. The K80 GPUs have no interface for monitor, so I have to use off screen rendering. It's said that EGL is a pretty good choice for this situation, but as I switch VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN and VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN_EGL to "ON" and then make,  I get these errors:

Built target vtkIOImage
[ 16%] Building C object VTK/ThirdParty/glew/vtkglew/CMakeFiles/vtkglew.dir/src/glew.c.o

......

Maybe it is clear that there is something wrong with the EGL header file, but I don't know how to fix it. The operation system is CentOS 6.6. There is an integrated graphics and 6 K80 GPUs. I connect to the machine using ssh and have set headless X server using one of the K80 GPUs. I can run the glxgears test in the off screen mode, but I don'n know how to make sure that EGL is correctly setted. I want to know how to use EGL for off screen rendering.

Any help would be highly appreciated!

Message-ID: <DB5PR09MB0678D7317E6C350DF11AC644BB3B0@DB5PR09MB0678.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Hi All


I tried to save a video in Paraview with "save animation" in ogv. The tool work perfectly wit the exception when I choose a resolution higher than the screen resolution. In this case the video can be played but the video image is completely corrupted. I tried with the latest Paraview 5.3 binary on Linux and OSX with the same results. Did someone else had the same problem ?


Regards

It seems you are missing KHR/khrplatform.h
You can download it from the EGL website:

When I enabled clang-format checking, I did a sweep of the repo with
clang-format.

I think the problem is that your headers aren't sorted:

    #include <limits>
    #include <algorithm>

Thanks for your reply! But I don't know where the KHR/khrplatform.h is used. When I configure paraview using ccmake, the options about EGL are EGL_INCLUDE_DIR,
EGL_LIBRARY, EGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY, EGL_opengl_LIBRARY, VTK_EGL_DEVICE_INDEX and VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN_EGL. In the path that I assigned to the EGL_INCLUDE_DIR, there is khrplatform.h file. What's more, I have built ParaView 5.2.0 with EGL used on another machine. That machine use NVIDIA GT 730 GPU, and in the EGL_INCLUDE_DIR path, there is not a khrplatform.h file, but the paraview can be built successfully and works. The khrplatform.h is required by the current EGL (1.5), but my EGL version is 1.4. Maybe it doesn't need that file?

Thank you again!

Looking at the errors you are getting looks like
/pan20/yzzhang/EGL/eglplatform.h
needs  KHR/khrplatform.h

Maybe your configuration uses different EGL header files than what you
expect.

Subject: [Paraview] Potential bug (feature request) Export Scene PV/5.3.0
Message-ID: <1490026899387.72285@lanl.gov>

We have a customer inquiring about whether there's a capability to export scene save min as well as max, indicates that the max is only exportable.  Can you please advise whether this is available in 5.3.0 or if it's on the roadmap for future releases?


Thanks!


This is an actual PV bug as reported by Alan Scott:


Export Scene for 2d plots misses columns

I believe we are missing columns of information when Export Scene is run for 2d plots. Here is how to replicate:

  *   5.3.0, Linux, local server.
  *   can.exo, all vars on, apply.
  *   Select Points On. Select maybe 10 points somewhere on the can.
  *   Plot Selection. Apply. Turn on only ACCL Magnitude.
  *   Export Scene.

Now, open the file. You will find columns for time, average, median, min/max (I believe it is max), and q1/q3 (I believe it is the third quartile.

What I want is time, average, median, min, max, q1 and then q3.


Thanks!

Jennifer,
The bug you list was written for and found on PV 5.3.  It is scheduled to be fixed by next fall,  PV 5.5, for Supercomputing.

The user can output the data in question by using Save Data.  This will save all of the data from the plot selections filter, giving many more columns than the user wanted.  But, that is his/her fallback for now.

This is indeed a bug. Alan has marked it as "nice-to-have" for SC 2017.

Hi,
     I've just compiled the Paraview-5.3.0 superbuild with EGL. I created
an EGL dir in /usr/include with egl.h, eglext.h and eglplatform.h (taken
from www.khronos.org/registry/egl/) and I created a KHR dir in /usr/include
with khrplatform.h (taken from the same site).
ccmake already recognized the /usr/include/EGL include path for EGL and
everything was ok.

Hi Cory,

I had to apply to clang-format manually. it's up there now. changes were 
minimal so I squashed them into the patch. System has yet to acknowledge 
and re check. I assume it will eventually.

Try as I may the clang-format script you guys are using doesn't work for 
me.  here are the errors:
Fedora 24:

    smic:~/work/ParaView$Utilities/Scripts/clang-format.bash --amend
    YAML:4:24: error: invalid boolean
    AlignAfterOpenBracket: DontAlign
                            ^~~~~~~~~
    Error reading /home/bloring/work/ParaView/.clang-format: Invalid
    argument

Maybe this is due to clang-format --version == 3.7? not sure but I won't 
have time to re-install clang on this system, so I also tried on a newer 
system.

OSX Sierra:

    pipin:~/ParaView/ParaView$./Utilities/Scripts/clang-format.bash --amend
    sed: 1: "/: format\.clang-format ...": bad flag in substitute
    command: '}'
    xargs: illegal option -- d
    usage: xargs [-0opt] [-E eofstr] [-I replstr [-R replacements]] [-J
    replstr]
                  [-L number] [-n number [-x]] [-P maxprocs] [-s size]
                  [utility [argument ...]]

clang-format --version==4.0. what ended up working on the OSX system was

    clang-format -style="{BasedOnStyle: Mozilla, AlignAfterOpenBracket:
    DontAlign, AlignOperands: false, AlwaysBreakAfterReturnType: None,
    AlwaysBreakAfterDefinitionReturnType: None, BreakBeforeBraces:
    Allman, ColumnLimit: 100, Standard: Cpp03}" -i
    Qt/Components/pqPresetToPixmap.cxx

where style arguments were extracted from .clang-format in top level 
ParaView dir.

The fixes would have had to had been squashed in anyways; the robot

The new robot is silent on successful checks, so if it's silent, you're
(likely) good.

Yeah, I think it requires 3.8. There is a new `Do: reformat` command
coming soon (this week ideally) to do the reformatting of your branch
for you since not everyone has a suitable clang-format just laying
around.

Message-ID: <cf730cdf-a455-64b2-a121-675540abf095@bresnan.net>

Hello All,

I am working with a less than perfect STL surface. I was able to use 
PV's Clip filter spheres to remove a number of spatially isolated 
undesirable triangle clusters.  (With a new application of the Extract 
Surface Filter, I was able to use Save Data to get an updated/revised 
STL file.)

I am now working on removing triangles that have a point or an edge 
attached like a fish fin to the desired STL surface. I have successfully 
selected the undesirable fin-like triangles. Now, I want to delete (or 
Clip) these triangles to remove  them from the datum set. Right-click 
delete does not appear to be an option?

Is there some way to delete these selected STL triangles from the Datum set?

Regards,

Sam Key

I wanted to mention a strange bug a user had  In ParaView 5.3.0, Linux.  All of his text in the ParaView GUI went white.  He reset the appearance/display schemes and all of the text now appears normal.

Keep calm and carry on.

Hello,

Thanks a lot for you two! I've found my mistakes based on your tips. It is true that I missed the khrplatform.h file. I put it in the same directory of other EGL header files with the name of "EGL", so it can not be found by the program. Creating a KHR dir and putting khrplatform.h into it solved my problem. Now my paraview can work with EGL. Thank you very much!

Sincerely
-Zhang

Hi,
     I've just compiled the Paraview-5.3.0 superbuild with EGL. I created an EGL dir in /usr/include with egl.h, eglext.h and eglplatform.h (taken from www.khronos.org/registry/egl/) and I created a KHR dir in /usr/include with khrplatform.h (taken from the same site).
ccmake already recognized the /usr/include/EGL include path for EGL and everything was ok.

Maybe your configuration uses different EGL header files than what you expect.

Thanks for your reply! But I don't know where the KHR/khrplatform.h is used. When I configure paraview using ccmake, the options about EGL are EGL_INCLUDE_DIR,
EGL_LIBRARY, EGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY, EGL_opengl_LIBRARY, VTK_EGL_DEVICE_INDEX and VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN_EGL. In the path that I assigned to the EGL_INCLUDE_DIR, there is khrplatform.h file. What's more, I have built ParaView 5.2.0 with EGL used on another machine. That machine use NVIDIA GT 730 GPU, and in the EGL_INCLUDE_DIR path, there is not a khrplatform.h file, but the paraview can be built successfully and works. The khrplatform.h is required by the current EGL (1.5), but my EGL version is 1.4. Maybe it doesn't need that file?

Thank you again!

It seems you are missing KHR/khrplatform.h
You can download it from the EGL website:

Hello,

I'm building ParaView 5.2.0 on a machine that uses NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. The K80 GPUs have no interface for monitor, so I have to use off screen rendering. It's said that EGL is a pretty good choice for this situation, but as I switch VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN and VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN_EGL to "ON" and then make,  I get these errors:

Maybe it is clear that there is something wrong with the EGL header file, but I don't know how to fix it. The operation system is CentOS 6.6. There is an integrated graphics and 6 K80 GPUs. I connect to the machine using ssh and have set headless X server using one of the K80 GPUs. I can run the glxgears test in the off screen mode, but I don'n know how to make sure that EGL is correctly setted. I want to know how to use EGL for off screen rendering.

Any help would be highly appreciated!

You can use the *Extract Selection* filter. Before you create the filter,
make sure you invert the selection so that you are removing the selected
selected. To do that, once you've made your selection, go to *Edit | Find
Data* and then check the *Invert Selection *check box. Now, from the dialog
itself, you can click the *Extract Selection* button to create a new *Extract
Selection* filter. The output of this filter is *Unstructured Grid * and
STL only supports *Polydata, *hence apply the *Extract Surface* filter
again and then you shall be able to save out the result as a new STL file.

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <C0454EED-AAAC-49BA-ADF4-2ABCFCB18DBD@pointwise.com>

Tuesday, 21 March 2017



All,

I?ve been having issues with ParaView version 5 builds since their release.  I?ve tried each new release as its announced, but run into the same issue.  The application can be opened, but anytime I attempt to open a file the application crashes before even displaying the Open/Save dialog window.  The termination signal is a Segmentation fault of type 11.  I?ve attached the crash report for anyone more knowledgeable about what the issue is.  Has anyone else experienced this issue?  Is there a workaround?

Best Regards,

Hi Zach,

Someone else on this mailing list recently reported a similar crash. Do you
have any unusual file systems mounted on the Mac in question? That will
help debug the problem.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Cory,

I have three SMB volumes and one NFS volume mounted at /Users/zdavis/Shares using Autofs.  As an aside, I have been able to revert to using ParaView 4.4.0, but obviously don?t want to be stuck on this version forever if it can be avoided.

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to build Command Line Executables in Paraview 5.3
	using CMake
Message-ID: <1490118941838.3876@utwente.nl>

Dear Paraview Team,


Currently, I am building paraview 5.3 from its source files alongwith Qt 5.8. I am doing this to add superquadric custom glyphs in paraview.


After a whole day of figuring out and installing the required libraries, the build process now reaches 100% however it fails when trying to build command line executables. Below is the is what i see on my terminal when i use make -d..

=========================================


So as a temporary solution, I commented out the add_subdirectory(CommandLineExecutables) in the CMakeLists.txt.


#if (PARAVIEW_ENABLE_COMMANDLINE_TOOLS)
#  add_subdirectory(CommandLineExecutables)
#endif()


Then the build succeeds. But sadly, I am still unable to start paraview because then I get some "libprotobuf" error which states that I need to update my libprotobuf library.


==============


libprotobuf FATAL /home/scordee/Paraview/Source/ThirdParty/protobuf/vtkprotobuf/src/google/protobuf/stubs/common.cc:62] This program requires version 2.6.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed version is 2.3.0.  Please update your library.  If you compiled the program yourself, make sure that your headers are from the same version of Protocol Buffers as your link-time library.  (Version verification failed in "/build/mir-pkdHET/mir-0.21.0+16.04.20160330/obj-x86_64-linux-gnu/src/protobuf/mir_protobuf.pb.cc".)
Aborted (core dumped)


=============


Could you please help me with the above issue? I am building paraview on Ubuntu Xenial 16 LTS.


Thank you in advance

Zach,

Thanks for the information.

I mounted an SMB volume on my machine and did not get a crash when opening
a file in ParaView 5.3.0. That leaves NFS as causing some unhandled
condition in the code pointed out by your error report.

I'll file a bug report and investigate for 5.4.0.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17310

Thanks,
Cory

Greetings Utkarsh!

Your advice is exceptional; the remaining "unwanted" STL triangles 
attached to the desired STL surface have been removed.

A couple of lessons:

(1) At first the instruction sequence seemed to me a little awkward. 
However, after repeated use it became rhythmic. I did find it better to 
reset/uncheck *Invert Selection* of the*Edit | Find Data* panel before 
going to the next location.

(2) It took a couple of tries for me to discover that the unwanted 
fin-like attachments were actually zero-thickness regions with matching 
back-to-back STL-triangles -- one for each side, and hence, it required 
a second removal go around. (The original 30+ layered tetrahedral mesh 
as our Japanese colleagues would say, "was not so good.")

(3) A triangular hole required a hand-crafted STL-triangle with a 
borrowed normal-vector from a neighbor triangle. After writing out the 
datum set, hand editing the STL-file to add in the missing triangle and 
renaming a copy of the datum-set, a read and write with PV showed that 
PV 'corrected' the normal vector. Whoever wrote that section of code 
deserves a pat on the back.

(4) The PV window with the row of miniature icons in upper-left corner 
took me a couple of  tries to figure out that add & subtract were clues 
to use ctrl & shift keys when making selections. IMHO, well done.

(5) Message to myself: "The more you use ParaView, the smarter it gets."

Thanks for really great tool!

Hello,

Is it possible to change drop down list values from information script?
For example, we can take values from input arrays but instead we create
field self.names and take values from it.

Sivakumar,
I don?t know the answer to your question, but the easy way would be to download ParaView from paraview.org (it?s free!) and find out.  With regards to how to use ParaView, there is a 2 page getting started guide that appears at startup.  There are two good links to training materials found on the Help menu within ParaView.  Last, the ParaView Guide (book) comes with ParaView as a .pdf for free.  This is also available from the Help menu.

Ahh.. didn't really know about that. Will try installing vis superbuild option.

I hope I can also add the superquadric glyphs (which is why I am building the source files) to the plugin directory.

Thank you for your reply. I will update you with the outcome very soon.

Fingers crossed ;)

See the Calculator filter for computing expressions from data arrays.
If you need to do differentiation, see the Gradient filter for first

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to launch paraview
Message-ID: <1490287180348.30524@utwente.nl>

Dear Paraview team and users,


Today i built paraview on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, using the paraview-superbuild option.


On launching paraview via the terminal,


I first had an issue with libprotobuf .. as the version of libprotobuf on my machine was 2.6.1 when compared to the one supplied by ParaView-superbuild source. Their version was 2.3.


After going through the protobuf source files ..  as a solution I removed the libprotobuf package from my Desktop and this solved the libprotobuf version issue.


However, when I rebuilt and relaunched paraview via the terminal I get into another problem which is shown below

QFontDatabase: Cannot find font directory /home/scordee/Paraview/ParaviewSuperbuild/Build/install/lib/fonts.

Segmentation fault (core dumped)


How do I solve this problem now? Any help would be appreciated.


Regards

Deepak

Hello Paraviewers,

I want to get the difference of all the cell data, similar to what was done
here

http://paraview.markmail.org/search/?q=difference#query:difference+page:1+mid:lc6a4ss2j5hi37ps+state:results

However, how do I make a writer that can accept the appended data? I tried
to create the writer

writer = CreateWriter(path+'Difference.e', reader[0])
writer.CellData.append( reader[0].CellData['x'] - reader[1].CellData['x'] ,
'x')


and got the error

    return getattr(self.Proxy.GetDataInformation(self.OutputPort),
"Get%sInformation" % self.FieldData)()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'GetCellDataInformation'


Then, I also tried to just copy the reader

writer = reader[0]
writer.CellData.append( reader[0].CellData['x'] - reader[1].CellData['x'] ,
'x')


and got the error

Traceback (most recent call last):

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Scale time

Is it possible to scale time, and then display this on the screen with the Annotate Time source?  For instance, assuming can.exo's time is in seconds, I would like to present time on screen in milliseconds.  Can.exo's first timestep is at 0.0001 seconds.  I want to display it as 0.1 milliseconds.

I don't think Plot Global Variables Over Time works the way you think it does. This filter assumes that the global arrays contain a static array the same size as the number of time steps and then plots that with the time array on the x axis and the entries in this array in the y axis. If the size of the global variable does not equal the number of time steps, the view will show nothing.

I think you really want to use Plot Selection Over Time. That you can give a value and it will iterate the pipeline over time and compute the value for each time step. Unfortunately, it looks like the filter is broken for selections on field data. It works, however, on table data, so you can write the result as that.

I got what I think you want using the can data set. Here are the steps I used:

1. Load can.ex2. All variables. Apply.
2. Add the Programmable Filter. Set the output type to vtkTable (!) and use the following script:
disp_y = inputs[0].PointData["DISPL"][:,1]
mean_disp = mean(disp_y)
output.RowData.append(mean_disp, "MEAN_DISP")
3. Select the single row shown in the spreadsheet that pops up.
4. Add Plot Selection Over Time filter. Apply.

Subject: [Paraview] Superquadric tensor glyph
Message-ID: <1490306777569.30849@utwente.nl>

Dear Paraview users,


I would like to visualise non-spherical particles in paraview (super ellipsoids to be precise). Thereby, I am currently trying to add customised plugins named tensor glyphs and superquadric tensor glyphs, which are available on the paraview wiki.


However, since the past 4 days I have not been able to build paraview from its source files. I hav even tried the superbuild option but there is always some or the other library missing. The farthest I have reached so far is a black screen with a XError. Morover, different issues pop up on different desktops (with Ubuntu) I have tried to install paraview on. It is really very annoying at the moment.


Is there any other way to add superquadric glyphs option to paraview? It would be great if this is possible.


Regards

Deepak

Hi,

One solution is to call programmable filter from your python program.
I haven't tried Exodus II format, but the below is working:

readers = []
readers.append(OpenDataFile(PATH + 'aaa.vtp'))
readers.append(OpenDataFile(PATH + 'bbb.vtp'))

programmable = ProgrammableFilter(Input=readers)
programmable.Script="\nelev0 = inputs[0].PointData['Elevation']
\nelev1 = inputs[1].PointData['Elevation']\noutput.PointData.append(elev1
- elev0, 'difference')"
programmable.UpdatePipeline()

writer = CreateWriter(PATH + 'ccc.vtp', programmable)
writer.UpdatePipeline()

OK, looking at your reply, I think I have a fundamental misunderstanding, and have been mixing up terms.  What is a "global data" and "field data"?  What's the difference?

I think you are saying that if we have 43 timesteps (can.exo), any global arrays will have 43 entries (such as time or atmospheric pressure).  However, field data will have a single entry (such as Title)?  Below, you are setting - and resetting - the field data over and over again?

The Exodus II file format has the concept of "global data." When this is read into ParaView/VTK, it gets placed into what vtkDataSet calls the "field data." Because of this, I tend to use the two interchangeably (and likewise so does the ParaView GUI). Personally, I prefer the term "global data" as it is more descriptive.

Arrays in global/field data can be whatever you want and whatever size you want. For example, someone might want to record the total volume of the data set. That could reasonably be stored in the global/field data. Another example might be that someone wants to record the time at which a particular event occurs. This could be stored in the global/field data as an array of marked time indices. As you can see, global/field data can mean pretty much whatever you want it to mean, so you can't do much with it unless you understand the semantics. Consequently, global/field data is mostly ignored by ParaView.

One thing that we have encountered with simulations at Sandia is that the simulation might track some global information, such as the mean of a field, and append that value to an array in the global data every time a timestep is written out. Thus, you end up with a global/field data array of length equal to the number of timesteps. The Plot Global Data Over Time filter addresses this use case and only this use case.

If you want to compute a value and then plot how that value changes over time, your best approach is to write that value out to a table and then use Plot Selection Over Time to plot the value.

Hello Paraviewers,

I want to make sure my multivariable cyclic simulation has reached "steady
state" so I am trying to match the corresponding timesteps and get the R^2
error. To take the difference between the two datasets, I was thinking of
following the method laid out here

http://paraview.markmail.org/search/?q=difference#query:difference+page:1+mid:lc6a4ss2j5hi37ps+state:results

and using the ProgrammableFilter to take the difference. That works great
for a single variable. However, is there a way to take the difference of
all the variables in the data set? Or do I just have to have a
ProgrammableFilter for each variable?

Thank you for the advice

Regards,

John

The programmable filter just runs the Python script you give it. Use Python to iterate over all the fields in your dataset. Augmenting the example in the email you reference, use something like this to iterate over all the fields:

for field in inputs[0].PointData.keys():
    data0 = inputs[0].PointData[field]
    data1 = inputs[1].PointData[field]
    output.PointData.append(data0-data1, field + '-diff')

Subject: [Paraview] Switching time steps when running parallel
Message-ID: <11BC40335FCF354D99B30918B180F5296B4B0028@MAIL-1.htw-aalen.de>

I am using the ensight gold file format for transient results.
When running Paraview in parallel mode (Auto MPI), I am unable to load any time step except the first one.
Trying to load a different time step results in the error message:


ERROR: In /home/buildslave/dashboards/buildbot/paraview-pvbinsdash-linux-shared-release_opengl2_qt4_superbuild/source-paraview/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Default/vtkPEnSightReader.cxx, line 343

  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA

  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0


When I try the same without Auto MPI enabled it works perfectly. It is just that I would like to use Auto MPI because it speeds up the filters a lot.
I tried with versions 5.2.0 and 5.3.0.

Alex

Hi,

Any chance you could share the data set? I cannot determine the problem
from the error message and am not sure I can reproduce it otherwise.

Thanks,

Hi,

I was able to reproduce this issue with a data set that Alex shared
privately with me (but is ok to share publicly). I've created a bug report (
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17333).

Cheers,
Andy

ps. Alex: I've cc'ed the list so that others can follow the issue.

Thanks Ken - really good explanation.  I have never understood global data, I think I do now.

Subject: RE: [Paraview] How do you "see" FieldData

The Exodus II file format has the concept of "global data." When this is read into ParaView/VTK, it gets placed into what vtkDataSet calls the "field data." Because of this, I tend to use the two interchangeably (and likewise so does the ParaView GUI). Personally, I prefer the term "global data" as it is more descriptive.

Arrays in global/field data can be whatever you want and whatever size you want. For example, someone might want to record the total volume of the data set. That could reasonably be stored in the global/field data. Another example might be that someone wants to record the time at which a particular event occurs. This could be stored in the global/field data as an array of marked time indices. As you can see, global/field data can mean pretty much whatever you want it to mean, so you can't do much with it unless you understand the semantics. Consequently, global/field data is mostly ignored by ParaView.

One thing that we have encountered with simulations at Sandia is that the simulation might track some global information, such as the mean of a field, and append that value to an array in the global data every time a timestep is written out. Thus, you end up with a global/field data array of length equal to the number of timesteps. The Plot Global Data Over Time filter addresses this use case and only this use case.

If you want to compute a value and then plot how that value changes over time, your best approach is to write that value out to a table and then use Plot Selection Over Time to plot the value.

Subject: RE: [Paraview] How do you "see" FieldData

OK, looking at your reply, I think I have a fundamental misunderstanding, and have been mixing up terms.  What is a "global data" and "field data"?  What's the difference?

I think you are saying that if we have 43 timesteps (can.exo), any global arrays will have 43 entries (such as time or atmospheric pressure).  However, field data will have a single entry (such as Title)?  Below, you are setting - and resetting - the field data over and over again?

Subject: RE: [Paraview] How do you "see" FieldData

I don't think Plot Global Variables Over Time works the way you think it does. This filter assumes that the global arrays contain a static array the same size as the number of time steps and then plots that with the time array on the x axis and the entries in this array in the y axis. If the size of the global variable does not equal the number of time steps, the view will show nothing.

I think you really want to use Plot Selection Over Time. That you can give a value and it will iterate the pipeline over time and compute the value for each time step. Unfortunately, it looks like the filter is broken for selections on field data. It works, however, on table data, so you can write the result as that.

I got what I think you want using the can data set. Here are the steps I used:

1. Load can.ex2. All variables. Apply.
2. Add the Programmable Filter. Set the output type to vtkTable (!) and use the following script:
disp_y = inputs[0].PointData["DISPL"][:,1]
mean_disp = mean(disp_y)
output.RowData.append(mean_disp, "MEAN_DISP")
3. Select the single row shown in the spreadsheet that pops up.
4. Add Plot Selection Over Time filter. Apply.

How do you "see" FieldData variables created in the ProgrammableFilter in the PlotGlobalVariablesOverTime filter?  I'm creating a FieldData variable in the ProgrammableFilter.  Now I'd like to plot it over time.  It isn't available as an option for me to plot, though.  I see other global variables, just not this one.



disp_y = inputs[0].PointData["displ_"][:,1]



mean_disp = mean(disp_y)



output.FieldData.append(mean_disp, "MEAN_DISP")





Am I doing something wrong here?

Hi Cory,

Thanks for your solution! I found that ParaView crashed when I had a volume
mounted that belonged to another user on the Mac workstation, and that
volume denied me access. For example, if I tried:

ls -l /Volumes

the error stream shows "ls: volume_name: Permission denied" for each volume
denying me access. After unmounting those volumes, ParaView was able to
open files normally.

Thanks,
Roman

Roman,

Thanks for reporting back. It looks like I need to handle some errors
conditions in ParaView better.

I have reported this issue at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17310

Subject: [Paraview] changing color of coordinate system arrows
Message-ID: <d7b295f8-b3b6-485b-d997-4b326c5d22cb@fau.de>

Is it possible to change the colors of the coordinate system arrows? 
The yellow one is not that clear visible on a white background.

Thanks,

Fabian

Not currently, I am afraid. They are not exposed to be user settable. Feel
free to report a issue on the issue tracker, however. It should be fairly
straight forward to support.

Message-ID: <CAGV2_3v8NSaRq6Ss962+4UYHbPEAS6k-UUmxMjpq38YtWYuheg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

my name is Christine Beaulieu. I am doing a PhD at ?cole Polytechnique
Montr?al. I am using Paraview to visualize results of my simulations in
granular materials.

I have a problem when I try to use the ?Point Spite? mode with non constant
radius. When I use ?Constant Radius? for my particles, I have no problem.
However, as soon as I change it for ?Radius?, I get the following error :

[image: Images int?gr?es 1]

I tried to install different versions (5.1, 4.1 and 4.4...) but I always
get some errors (but not the same error) when I try to do this operation.
With the version 5.1, Paraview simply freezes when I try to use ?Gaussian
Points?. With the version 4.1, I have this error :

[image: Images int?gr?es 2]

I also tried to look on forums, but I didn't find any satisfactory and
comprehensible answer...

My operating system is Windows 10, 64-bits.

Do you think you can help me? It would be very useful for my research if I
could visualize properly my results...

Thank you very much in advance.
Have a nice day

Hi Christine,

It looks like you are loading the Point Sprite plugin in ParaView and are
trying to use that? As of ParaView 5.1 (and maybe 5.0), you can use the
Point Gaussian representation that comes built in to ParaView. Try that and
see if you get similar errors.

Thanks,
Cory

Hello Paraviewers,

I'm trying to integrate variables over time. I found this thread where it
had been brought up previously.

http://paraview.markmail.org/search/?q=integral+over+time#query:integral%20over%20time+page:1+mid:z75bede26onth4eu+state:results

However, when I try and open the state file, paraview crashes. So what
commands do I use to do the integral over time? I'm trying to integrate a
PlotSelectionOverTime filter (with row data).

I'm doing this programmatically, so attached is the python script. I have
so far.

Regards,

John R. Haase

John,

Can you send me the datafiles too (feel free to do it off the mailing list)
so I can figure out what could be going wrong.

Thanks

They are very large. I believe you should be able to access them through

Your script worked for me for the most part with ParaView 5.3. All I did
was added a plot view to show the results (attached). If that what you were
looking for?

Sorry, that's not what I wanted. I want to integrate the variable
"integrateSqrVarOverSpace", over time as well.

I opened https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17340
I did not see the option for ?minor enhancement?.

Thanks :)

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with writing VTK in MPI
Message-ID: <CABYN2Nqzh2-2cPTcuP2_h9YAVjVUstDaYRGpY341fDPkLDp4gw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi! Paraviewers,

We are having problems with the output VTK files when running a Lattice
Boltzmann simulation in parallel with MPI. I am not sure what could be the
problem. The thing is that when executing the program in the front end
there is no problem, however when sending sbatch with 64 processors the
files most of the time do not write correctly. I am attaching a file and
maybe you can guide me to solve the issue,

warmly,
Jose


The files have square part that should not be there,

Hi there!

Wondering how many people have used Paraview in a CAVE mode? And if so, can
you share how big of a dataset you were able to visualize with good enough
frame rate?

I am curious because I am struggling here to even visualize smaller
datasets (like 100k points file PVTU format) with interactive frame rates
in our 4 walled CAVE. I am getting poor performance.

Faiz,

As per your last email, I think the problem could be related to VirtualGL
and TurboVNC. Can you try running your app outside cave (either setup as
two X displays or use two computer systems) without VirtualGL or TurboVNC
as that would surely give you a clear indication on what is the bottleneck.

I believe you are using nearly current paraview which uses OpenGL2 then my
other guess would be that your LOD is not triggering, but even without that
you should be able to render 100K points without much trouble on a decent
graphics card.

Let us know what you think of the above before we dig into it further.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython script fails on Paraview 5.0.1
Message-ID: <CAAxiCSxa0FvCS7nrmcHisXO2U4H9axL5McgH6pEcJvCSvo9vLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have compiled Paraview 5.0.1 on ubuntu with mesa libs to run it on CPU.
Also I generated a simple pvpython script from Paraview 5.0.1 GUI on my
windows machine (attached) and the script runs fine there.
However this script fails with my mesa compiled pvpython.

=============error logs===============
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cone_clip.py", line 19, in <module>
    cone1Display.SetScaleArray = [None, '']
  File
"/home/bd/gohan_mount/bdutta/PARAVIEW/PV_Vignesh/bd_build_mesa/lib/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py",
line 307, in __setattr__
    "to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute SetScaleArray does not exist.  This class does
not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use
add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.
=============================

?
I have built the Paraview with the following options (CMakeCache.txt
attached):
cmake ../ -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_CATALYST=ON -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON
-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$PYTHON_LIBRARY -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR
-DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON -DMPI_HEADER_PATH=$MPI_HEADER_PATH
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$BD_INSTALL_PATH -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF
-DVTK_USE_X=OFF -DOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR=$BD_INSTALL_PATH/include
-DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=$BD_INSTALL_PATH/lib/libOSMesa.so
-DOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY=$BD_INSTALL_PATH/lib/libGLU.so
-DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON -DOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR=$BD_INSTALL_PATH/include
-DOSMESA_LIBRARY=$BD_INSTALL_PATH/lib/libOSMesa.so

Do I need to pass some extra parameters while building and if so what are
they? All my GUI generated scripts seem to fail with similar errors.

??Thanks in advance for guidance.
?

Isn't that simply a sum of all the rows in the output of
 integrateSqrVarOverSpace filter?

If so, that can be done by using another *ProgrammableFilter* with  the
following *Script*:

from numpy import sum
for inTable, outTable in zip(inputs[0], output):

    for aname in inTable.RowData.keys():

        outTable.RowData.append(sum(inTable.RowData[aname]), aname)

Exploring 'integrateSqrVarOverSpace', it doesn't have a 'RowData' object.

dir(integrateSqrVarOverSpace)

['CellData', 'FieldData', 'FileNameChanged', 'GetCellDataInformation',
'GetDataInformation', 'GetFieldDataInformation', 'GetPointDataInformation',
'GetProperty', 'GetPropertyValue', 'Initialize', 'InitializeFromProxy',
'Input', 'ListProperties', 'Observed', 'ObserverTag',
'OnlyReportSelectionStatistics', 'PointData', 'Port', 'SMProxy',

So, using the script you posted, I get the error "IndexError: tuple index
out of range".

John,

That's the script for a "Programmable Filter", not simply to be added
to your script, similar to what you're doing with  `squareDiff`.

e.g.

myfilter = ProgrammableFilter(Input=integrateSqrVarOverSpace)
myfilter.Script = "...."  # the script I provided.
myfilter.UpdatePipeline()
...

Utkarsh,

Using the script attached, and the same data sets as before. I get the error

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 22, in <module>

File "<string>", line 5, in RequestData

File "C:\Program Files\ParaView
5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit\bin\lib\site-packages\vtk\numpy_interface\dataset_adapter.py",
line 660, in append

arrLength = narray.shape[0]

IndexError: tuple index out of range


on the last line.

Okay, I figured it out. I updated my version of Paraview from 5.2.0 to
5.3.0 and that fixed it.

Is there a way to only have "aname" loop over "reader[0].ElementVariables"?
I tried to replace the line

"for aname in inTable.RowData.keys():"

with

"for aname in " + reader[0].ElementVariables + ":"

but that didn't work

Subject: [Paraview] Pipeline not respecting the arrow of time after changing
 the inputs of a filter
Message-ID: <CY4PR15MB1288F121AAFF950667484971FD370@CY4PR15MB1288.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>


Dear ParaViewers,


I came across some weird behaviour in ParaView: We have a custom BooleanOperation filter that have two outputs (custom ParaView build).
If both outputs are the inputs of an Append Geometry and we update the inputs of the BooleanOperation Filter, the Append Geometry will be moved before the BooleanOperation Filter.


I always though that if there was any dependencies in a pipeline, the representation would respect the "arrow of time" that goes from top to bottom.
Please look at the picture here attached (same behaviour with a ProgrammableFilter instead of a Append Geometry).


Is my comprehension at fault here or is it a bug ?


Thank you,

Jonathan Borduas

Jonathan,

The arrow is not intended to have a "top/down" direction, just a
"back-to-root" direction. It can be interpreted as
"ProgrammableFilter1" can be found somewhere on the main trunk.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thank you for your answer. As a user, especially with a complex tree, I found this unpractical. I have the reflex when searching for a filter to scroll down if the filters is "afterward". 

I do prefer the GitTree representation of ParaViewWeb. My opinion is that a GitTree could be the optimal representation of the pipeline. 

The GitKraken GitTree could be a good inspiration for a redesigned pipeline browser ?. 

Best regards

Jonathan Borduas

Totally agreed. The pipeline browser hasn't been updated since early
ParaView 3.0 days, I'd guess a 2009. It surely can be made better. In the
end, it boils down to the need and time availability. Since it works well
for 80/90% of the cases, we (and our customers and contributors) often end
up prioritizing other features and bug fixes. We do offer various
consulting options <https://www.kitware.com/what-we-offer/#consulting>, if
you're keen on getting it updated ?.
