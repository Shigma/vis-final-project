Works normal.
?         Try opening one of the known good files in ParaView Data.  Try can.exo ? we KNOW that one works.
Opening can.ex2 directly by double click (paraview closed) or with open or with cmd-O; same problem.
But opening can.ex2 (or any other file) directly by double click with paraview open no problem.
?         Try a previous ParaView version, downloaded from Kitware.  4.0.1 should be good...  Also, I assume your binary is from Kitware, not built by you.
Same problem, both binaries from Kitware.

open paraview.app --args -dr did not help

It also appears loading a Macro/State, etc.

Maybe it has sth. to do with the GtkFileChooser? I did already rename the ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini (did not help)

I did somehow connect this server ages ago to my system; it is a server from my former employee.

ParaView 4.1.0 64-bit


Issue:

Opening a file (via cmd-O, via the menu, or via the icon)
Paraview needs very long and ends with a error dialog: "connecting to the

Seeing the Open File menu -> Info: from here its working fine

I already have deinstalled and installed Paraview; but it did not change.
May be the error comes from Qt? Or some preference files, which I do not
find.

Thanks in advance,

Benni

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6EPTUfNA0SHVsi+aP=QvfOxnxrHJrgbJBVECBVrgQJ7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a series of nodes (points) with information as follows:

x,y,z and a variable like Pressure defined for each point.

I am trying to visualize surfaces and color them according to the variable
(Pressure).

I apply the CellCenters filter over my nodes and then I apply the Delunay3D
filter over the nodes. I get the colored surfaces, but the image is ugly.

Is there anyway to create a finer mesh by interpolating points between the
points I have from my data input ? If so, how can I do the interpolation.

I?d appreciate any help,

Hi,
I like volume viewing in Paraview 4.1.0 so far!

But, when I try to use even what I consider a rather small subset of one image file that I work with normally, the large memory on my large memory workstation still gets used up.

I am using Red Hat 6 on a system with 100 GB of Ram, adn a Quadro 6000 graphics card. I have compiled the Paraview code that I downloaded on Friday.

The image I loaded is saved as raw unsinged 8-bit and is 860x872x501 voxels i.e. about 360 MB file. If I load it and then try to apply the 'clip' tool, the system is unresponsive for a few minutes. If I run 'top ' during this process I see the memory in use expand up to 60 GB , this seems excessive!

Then, the resulting display behaves oddly, the clipped view suddenly 'vanishes' after moving the view around ??

Not replying to your specific questions below, but ... you have some pretty large data here!  It is amazing how a fairly small cell count on the edge of your data (for instance X axis) can become huge when you add a Y axis and Z axis.

You have about 375 million cells.  If you were able to volume render that on a local server, one machine, I believe you have the world's record!  Wow.

Generally speaking, I sort of tell people that anything around thousands of cells is a toy, a million is real data (and you should start thinking about using a cluster for a back end), and a billion is hero size and you want some heavy iron to deal with it.  Tens of billions, and especially trillions, pushes state of the art.  If you are volume rendering, divide any of these numbers by 10.

By the way, exascale will be in the trillions of cells.  Some of the greatest minds in the world are still trying to figure out how to visualize data of this size.

Message-ID: <6CCDD8FC6578314C902BBF87D511D9D869A4FE5C@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

As soon as I tried client-server method of using paraview, I found that volume viewing just gave me a blank screen, though 'point' or 'slice' gave me some kind of view as expected.

A little googleing found this thread from 1.5 years ago:


http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2013-January/027283.html

___quote___

I probably know the volume rendered issue.  I forget why but when connected to a
 remote server ParaView won't volume render on the client.
 Further, there is a threshold where toy to small datasets
 get rendered on the client.  Change this threshold to 0,
and volume rendering should occur on the remote server,
and work correctly.
Edit/ Settings/ RenderView / Server/ Remote Render Threshold == 0.

Alan
___ end quote ____



This seems to behave this way still in 4.1.0  (jan 2014)?  Any progress? I note that the dataset I was
rendering is much bigger than the 3mb threshold set by default, yet without setting the threshold to zero, no
volume rendering was presented on my screen.

Thanks
Robert

Aren't you glad I already reduced the data to 8bit grayscale and clipped out only 850x850x500 out of 4008x4008x2672 32-bit floating point values??? They keep building bigger cameras ...

Did I mention it is part of a time-series? 


>Some of the greatest minds in the world are still trying to figure out how to visualize data of this size.

Isn't that you guys? That's why I've tried Paraview! :-)  or is it Ajay?

There is indeed a cluster lurking, once we figure out how to configure it. It has several (50?)  GPU nodes too. That's how we get such images reconstructed :-) 



The work flow 
 downsample whole volume ->view downsample to choose VOI -> select VOI->process VOI->apply processing required on cluster to whole data->go home->render-> go home again 
is what I have in mind.

Hi Robert,

What are you trying to achieve with the clip filter? Clipping a large
volume is never a good idea. That filter converts the image data to an
unstructured grid which explicitly stores each vertex (as 3 floats) and the
connectivity (at least 8 64 bit ints per cell in your case). If you do the
math, 60 GB sounds about right. There are better ways of achieving the same
results with other filters. We need to know what you are after first.

Best,
-berk

I would like to use the point widget together with the ProbeFilter to write a custom made plugin similar to the ProbeLocatoin filter in PV. However, I am not able to "activate" the point widget as well as to retrieve the coordinate from the picking action. The only thing I am currently interested is the 3D coordinates from the picking action.

 

Has someone experiences in customizing the picking action using a plugin in PV?

Mind posting the XML for your filter? That will make it easier.

Thanks! I think you hit the nail on the head ...

Yes indeed I got the impression that it was doing something other than what I wanted.

With 'clip' I wanted to see half the volume cut away, while being able relatively easily to move that cut plane up and down.

I don't quite understand what the intended purpose of 'clip' is if not this? Is it for clipping meshes then rather than clipping volume images?

Hi Robert,

What are you trying to achieve with the clip filter? Clipping a large volume is never a good idea. That filter converts the image data to an unstructured grid which explicitly stores each vertex (as 3 floats) and the connectivity (at least 8 64 bit ints per cell in your case). If you do the math, 60 GB sounds about right. There are better ways of achieving the same results with other filters. We need to know what you are after first.

Best,
-berk

Hi,
I like volume viewing in Paraview 4.1.0 so far!

But, when I try to use even what I consider a rather small subset of one image file that I work with normally, the large memory on my large memory workstation still gets used up.

I am using Red Hat 6 on a system with 100 GB of Ram, adn a Quadro 6000 graphics card. I have compiled the Paraview code that I downloaded on Friday.

The image I loaded is saved as raw unsinged 8-bit and is 860x872x501 voxels i.e. about 360 MB file. If I load it and then try to apply the 'clip' tool, the system is unresponsive for a few minutes. If I run 'top ' during this process I see the memory in use expand up to 60 GB , this seems excessive!

Then, the resulting display behaves oddly, the clipped view suddenly 'vanishes' after moving the view around ??

Hello,

I have a question. I am using ParaView version 4.1. When trying to change
the opacity to less than 1, I get the following error :

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\paraview\VTK\Rendering\OpenGL\vtkOpenGLRenderer.cxx,
line 1068

vtkOpenGLRenderer (000000000601B7E0): failed after RenderPeel 1 OpenGL

0 : (1282) Invalid operation


How can I fix this problem ?

Thanks in Advance,

Hi Simon,

You normally shouldn't have to point to the numpy directory, especially
when you are opting to build numpy, as your options show. I wonder if your
numpy built successfully.

If you navigate to

/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build

and run 'make numpy', does it succeed?

Also, what can you send me the file /u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.
1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/pv-matplotlib-build.cmake? There
should be an option -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH in the command variable.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Cory,

When I do a make numpy, this is what I got the following.
In the pv-matplotlib-build.cmake file attached, -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR is defined 
as

-DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/install;

Thanks for your help

Hi Simon,

You normally shouldn't have to point to the numpy directory, especially when 
you are opting to build numpy, as your options show. I wonder if your numpy 
built successfully.

If you navigate to

/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build



and run 'make numpy', does it succeed?


Also, what can you send me the file 
/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/pv-matplotlib-build.cmake? 
There should be an option -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH in the command variable.


Thanks,
Cory

Simon,

That looks like what I would expect.

Next, could you navigate to

1.0-build/install

and send me the results of running

find . -name *numpy*

Thanks,

Cory,

The find didn't find anything...

ssu:01% pwd
/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/install
ssu:01% find . -name *numpy*
find: No match.

But, the install directory has the following directories

bin  etc  include  lib  lib64  share  var

and I believe numpy is in

ssu:01% pwd
/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/install/lib64/python2.6/site-packages
ssu:01% ll
total 8
drwx------ 18 ssu ssu 4096 May 30 11:41 numpy
-rw-------  1 ssu ssu 1658 May 30 11:41 numpy-1.6.2-py2.6.egg-info

lib64 only has a single python2.6 directory.... and all others are located in 
lib directory....  is this going to be a problem?

Thanks
-simon

	Hi Simon,

	You normally shouldn't have to point to the numpy directory, especially when
	you are opting to build numpy, as your options show. I wonder if your numpy
	built successfully.

	If you navigate to

	/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build



	and run 'make numpy', does it succeed?


	Also, what can you send me the file
	/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/pv-matplotlib-build.cmake?
	There should be an option -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH in the command variable.


	Thanks,
	Cory

Cory,

Yeap.... the build went pass the problem of matplotlib not finding numpy.... 
I will start turning of other features in the superbuild and try to build them

Thanks for your help.

Simon,

Hmm, that's odd that the find command didn't turn up anything. On what kind of 
system are you compiling?

In any case, I think I see the problem. Can you modify the CMake source file

ParaViewSuperbuild/Projects/matplotlib.build.cmake

so that the line

file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib/*.egg-info")


is replaced with

file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib64/*.egg-info")


and build again?

This will hopefully get you past the current build error. I'll investigate why 
python is being installed in install/lib64 instead of install/lib.

Cory

	That looks like what I would expect.

	and send me the results of running

Simon,

Hmm, that's odd that the find command didn't turn up anything. On what kind
of system are you compiling?

In any case, I think I see the problem. Can you modify the CMake source file

ParaViewSuperbuild/Projects/matplotlib.build.cmake

so that the line

file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib/*.egg-info")

is replaced with

file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib64/*.egg-info")

and build again?

This will hopefully get you past the current build error. I'll investigate
why python is being installed in install/lib64 instead of install/lib.

Cory

I believe there is a limitation of your graphic card or OpenGL driver.
To pass that issue, you need to disable "Depth peeling" in the settings.

This sounds like really interesting data! We are working on a Phase I
SBIR project looking at materials TEM tomography data in the range of
1024^3, and looking at strategies to accelerate marching cubes,
clipping, etc. This is in a custom ParaView application, and there may
be some outcomes that help you too. Is it possible to share any
samples of this data, and operations you are most interested in
performing on it?

That should help!

Simon,

I have posted a potential fix to the gerrit review system:
http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4259/

Can you try this out on this system to make sure it works? It basically
replaces the 64 I asked you to add after lib in matplotlib.build.cmake with
a * wildcard.

Thanks,
Cory

Dear all,

I wish to save my paraview animation, in which I would like to rotate
cameras, zoom in, zoom out during the animation.

I saw that it does let me zoom in and zoom out, but rotation of camera
isn't possible. How do I do that?

Thanks!

View/ Animation View.

Then, add a camera track.  You do that by changing to camera, changing ?Python? to camera, set the type of motion, and hit the big magic blue +.  Then, click on the white track itself to change stuff.

There are some out of date instructions here: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Advanced_Animations

Also note that the follow data is broken for large accelerations (bullets hitting walls).  That should be fixed next release.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkStructuredGrid not showing
Message-ID: <CADhXwgtjyHrHtSnb8brsOWBW_=e0hYuaayjPXJuA6E0r0GjesA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having some issues getting a structured grid to be rendered in ParaView
with a plugin I'm writing.

What I have is my own class extending vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm.

My RequestData method: http://pastebin.com/uxSk3n5b

I'm pretty sure that my generation code is working correctly as I can plug
it into the standalone VTK example and everything works as expected (
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/StructuredGrid/StructuredGrid).

Additionally, after I apply my algorithm, the Information tab lists the
correct statistics:
2 cells
6 points
density data array with 6 elements
extents and bounds are both [0,1,0,2,0,0] which appears to be correct

 I'm using ParaView 4.1 in Ubuntu 14.04 (x64)

This seems to be similar to an issue posted back in 2011:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2011-June/021872.html

As a note I have tried writing a simple XDMF file which creates a 2D
structured mesh and that loads just fine. However, strangely enough the
extents are in a different order than what I thought they should be ([0, 0,
0, 1, 0, 2])

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Polygonal Mesh(Surface) instead of Volumetric
 Mesh (Mesh over surface and volume)
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6h=YNjzNtA-szqE=xp=hA8WenLZd8rTBXoXAsr+ENPnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I have two related questions, so I will ask them in the same email.

Question 1 :
I have a .csv file which contains 65535 points. I would like to get a
volumetric mesh of it. I have imported these points as delimited text (;).

Then I apply the following filters so my pipeline looks like this :

1. Original Data(*.csv) (Type = table)
2. TableToPoints (Type = Polygonal Mesh that has 1 cell and 65535 Points)
3. Delaunay3D (Type = Unstructured Grid, cells=388749; Points=65535)

I am hoping to get a Volumetric mesh from my original points. Unfortunately
What I get with Delaunay3D filter is just a Polygonal Mesh that contains
only mesh at surfaces.  Is there anyway to fix this problem?

Question 2: If I import the *.csv file and then I apply the filter
TableToStructuredGrid :

1. Original Data(*.csv) (Type = table)
2. TableToStructuredGrid (Type= Structured Curvilinear Grid)

First I have to be very careful that the whole extent in x,y,z dimention
conforms with the NumberOfRows I have in my *.csv file and then the grid I
get is not what I am looking for.

Is there a neat way to give a group of coordinates (x,y,z) and get the
finest mesh possible out of it ?

I have tried a lot and didn?t get any results.
I have attached the mesh result from TableToStructuredGrid filter. This is
not the mesh I was hoping to get.
I?d appreciate any help.

Thanks in Advance

Simon,

I have posted a potential fix to the gerrit review system: 
http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4259/

Can you try this out on this system to make sure it works? It basically 
replaces the 64 I asked you to add after lib in matplotlib.build.cmake with a 
* wildcard.

Thanks,

	file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib/*.egg-info")


	is replaced with

	file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib64/*.egg-info")


	and build again?

	This will hopefully get you past the current build error. I'll investigate 
why
	python is being installed in install/lib64 instead of install/lib.

	        But, the install directory has the following directories

	        and I believe numpy is in

	        lib64 only has a single python2.6 directory.... and all others are 
located in

	        Simon,

	        That looks like what I would expect.

	        Next, could you navigate to

	        /u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/install



	        and send me the results of running


	        find . -name *numpy*


	        Thanks,
	        Cory

	                Hi Cory,

	                When I do a make numpy, this is what I got the following.
	                In the pv-matplotlib-build.cmake file 
attached, -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR
	is
	        defined
	                as

	                -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=/u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/install;

	                Thanks for your help

	                Hi Simon,

	                You normally shouldn't have to point to the numpy directory,
	especially when
	                you are opting to build numpy, as your options show. I wonder 
if your
	numpy
	                built successfully.

	                If you navigate to

	                /u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build



	                and run 'make numpy', does it succeed?


	                Also, what can you send me the file
	                /u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/pv-matplotlib-build.cmake?
	                There should be an option -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH in the 
command
	variable.


	                Thanks,
	                Cory

Thanks for testing, Simon. We'll get that patch in soon so you shouldn't run 
into this problem anymore.

	Simon,

	I have posted a potential fix to the gerrit review system:
	http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4259/

	Can you try this out on this system to make sure it works? It basically
	replaces the 64 I asked you to add after lib in matplotlib.build.cmake with a
	* wildcard.

	Thanks,
	Cory

	        Simon,

	        Hmm, that's odd that the find command didn't turn up anything. On 
what kind
	of
	        system are you compiling?

	        In any case, I think I see the problem. Can you modify the CMake 
source file

	        ParaViewSuperbuild/Projects/matplotlib.build.cmake

	        so that the line

	        file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib/*.egg-info")


	        is replaced with

	        file(GLOB_RECURSE numpy-egg "${NUMPY_INSTALL_DIR}/lib64/*.egg-info")


	        and build again?

	        This will hopefully get you past the current build error. I'll 
investigate
	why
	        python is being installed in install/lib64 instead of install/lib.

	        Cory

	                        Hi Simon,

	                        You normally shouldn't have to point to the numpy 
directory,
	        especially when
	                        you are opting to build numpy, as your options show. 
I wonder
	if your
	        numpy
	                        built successfully.

	                        If you navigate to

	                        /u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build



	                        and run 'make numpy', does it succeed?


	                        Also, what can you send me the file
	                        /u/ssu/build/paraview/Build_4.1.0_osmesa/ParaViewSuperbuild_4.1.0-build/pv-matplotlib-build.cmake?
	                        There should be an option -DNUMPY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH in 
the
	command
	        variable.


	                        Thanks,
	                        Cory

Hello Mickael;

I am unable to build the plugin on my Workstation from the files on your 
link (problems with CMake version and lunable to find CGNS lib), and as 
I am not the administrator, I cannot install anything that could be missing.

If you can provide a plugin binary compatible with the PV 410 Linux 64 
bits binary that is on the PV download page, I will test it.

Best regards.

Richard

I am new to ParaView. We are trying to build Visualization application using ParaView library and Our own QT GUI. This is not a plugin. It's a custom application. Any pointers to custom sample applications would be great help. The custom application will have the following functionality
1)Reading natran file and display model
2)common view operations like zoom pan rotate
3) selection functionality(ParaView provodes lot of in built selection functionality). I may have to extend this functionality or use out of the box functionality
4) Clipping.

Thanks,
Narasimha

You are familiar with ParaView's branding framework right?
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_Custom_Applications
That is the right place to start - strip away everything you are not
interested in.

After that you will more or less use plugin functionality to add in new
features that standard ParaView lacks.

Hi David,

I have gone through the branding framework and felt that is the way to go. Does paraview has any sample applications showing how the branding framework works. Also paraview comes with lot of functionality how do we locate what is needed. Like I need Nastran file reader(.nas) from ParaView. How do I get to that functionality in the paraview source?

Also Does it need to be c++ custom application? Can I use any .net language?

Thanks and regards,
Narasimha Prasad Baditela

> Does paraview has any sample applications showing how the branding
framework works

hmmm, let me dig around. I seem to have lost track of the four starters I
made back in 2009 for the workshop presentation
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/IEEE_Vis09_Revise_Workshop.
They may be lost to antiquity at this point in which case it will
unfortunately take an hour or two to recreate them.

> How do I get to that functionality in the paraview source?

Unfortunately a lot of that has to come from familiarity with the code
base. For readers you can grep in readers.xml file and the VisItBridge.

> Does it need to be c++ custom application? Can I use any .net language?

Pretty much yes. The core of ParaView will always be c++, but then it can
be wrapped. For the last few years python has been the interpreted language
of choice. In the distant past it was Tcl. We've done a few projects with
Java more recently. .net would be harder.

Subject: [Paraview] Clarification on Paraview pvbatch run
Message-ID: <539022A6.1070304@phitecingegneria.it>

Hi All,

i'm writing here because i would understand better the functionality of 
pvbatch in Paraview.

At moment i'm able to run Paraview in batch launching a python script, 
and it works good.

Here the line command i launch:
_//software/Paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.12/mpirun 
-np 6 /software/Paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64/bin/pvbatch 
python_script.py /_

The problem is that monitoring at processors loads and memory 
consumption, it seems that it's actually working on one single 
processor; in fact if i switch to /-np 2/ or even /-np1/ nothing changes 
in terms of computing time.
This is happening with various Paraview versions (3.10 -3.12-4.1); is 
there something missing in the line command? Some other options? Are 
some Paraview filters just working as serial?




Another question would be about running pvbatch on clusters without 
graphic cards: i know it's possible, compiling Paraview with OSMesa, and 
adding in the command line  the option
--/use-offscreen-rendering/. Could someone clarify also this point?

Thank you all in advance!
Daniele

Hi Dave,


Many thanks for Your reply. I tried this option, neither disabling nor enabling 
"Render text as paths" creates an SVG with editable text for me with paraview 
4.1.0. See e.g. attached SVGs which show simply a cone where I enabled "Show 
Axis". Opening theses with inkscape reveals that in both cases the text consist 
of triangles and not of text objects.
Any idea what I could be doing wrong?

Many thanks for looking into this.
Roman

Subject: [Paraview] Crash of pvserver using pqActiveObjects::instance()
Message-ID: <53906A86.3060406@ipcms.unistra.fr>

Hello,
I'm using an in-house written Plugin to read time dependent simulation 
data. The plugin has an option to reposition the camera
during the RequestData routine in order to keep the focus on the centre 
of a moving structure of interest.
For that purpose we use the pqActiveObjects::instance()  singleton.

As long as the plugin is used to read the data without involving a 
pvserver (using Paraview only),
everything works as expected. But if the data is processed with a 
pvserver, a call of

pqActiveObjects* tempInstance = &( pqActiveObjects::instance() );

results in a crash of the server. We use Paraview 4.0.1 64bit on ubuntu 
12.04 systems. And paraview is configured to render remotely with a
"Remote Render Threshold" of 0MBytes.
Is this kind of repositioning illegal and works just accidentally in the 
case of local execution or is there a way to solve this problem?

Best regards
Christian

Hi Roman,

Aha, the cube axis actors are still using vtkVectorText to render the text.
vtkVectorText is a text source that produces polydata to forms the
characters of the text string, and the actual text information is lost by
the time the SVG exporter processes the actors.

There was an effort in VTK to convert the cube axes to use vtkTextActor3D,
which would allow proper text exporting, but this is disabled in ParaView,
and I believe it is only experimental at this point. So unfortunately, this
is the best it gets for that particular text source at the moment.

Sorry for the misinformation earlier -- I thought you were referring to a
ParaView text source, which should export as editable text.

Dave

Hi all,

I got steady state solution for my problem. After plotting streamlines at
steady state, I would like to make animation showing moving of spheres
(resulted from Glyph filter) on the streamlines, the spheres' velocity
should be defined by the flow velocity. How can I make this?
Any suggestion would be very much appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

Im sure that should be possible somehow, maybe not the specific data I mentioned which is an external user's unpublished work so far, but we can just get some more if there's some useful collaboration to be had. 

I've been 'playing' with Paraview since the CCPi and Harwell Imaging Partnership meeting showed the latest release and also because the latest de-bugging of our central file system is arguing against allowing the 'visualization workstation' being directly connected to the central storage for technical reasons, thus the client/server model becomes very attractive, allowing the machine that actually reads data to be inside the computer cluster rack, while another machine displays the result , I think this require our cluster admins to do something-or-other , so I need to have some good argument that it will indeed do what we want (which also means figuring out what we actually want) to get that task added to their already-lengthy list. 

In the first instance, we want external facility users to at least be able to do SOMETHING with their data while still at their experiment. So it takes about 1/2 hour to collect the raw data, another 40 min to reconstruct the 160 GB 3-d image , then what???

Make an isocontour of the streamlines' integrationTime variable.
Then in animation view, make a track for the isocontour value.

Hi Sebastien,

thanks for the reply!

The script is about creating slice and sweep animation. But it's working 
fine, i think there is no problem in it.
Do you need the script to understand something about the parallelization?

Let me know!
Daniele

Subject: [Paraview] settings and default values
Message-ID: <53908CA0.9050703@ec-nantes.fr>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

hi to all,

I have a custom filter with default values (defined in the xml). but now
I want to populate the default values from the data coming from the
plugin settings.

so a have a <ProxyGroup name="settings"> with the descriptions of my
settings window. but I don't know how to put this information into my
filter.

I'm trying something like this

vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(proxy()->GetProperty("GUIMaxNbModes"))->SetElement(0,settings->value("PxdmfSettings.GUIMaxNbModes",100).toInt());

(in the constructor of a pqPropertyWidget) but I don't know if this is
the right way.

Also when I use the setting menu, my data ("GUIMaxNbModes") is written
in the ParaView4.1.0.ini AND in the UserSettings.json. Why ???

Thank to all
Felipe

Is it using the VTK classes or the paraview Proxy?

Moreover, the reader/source is responsible to distribute the data to
properly handle parallelism.
If it does not, then you right, everything will happen on the root node.

Hense a quick look at the script can help us determine which part need to
change in order to truly use parallel processing.

Ok, so you are correctly using everything.
The question is now on the *OpenFOAMReader and if it properly use MPI to
read and distribute the data.*
*Which unfortunately I don't know.*

*If you want to force a redistribution of your data across your nodes, you
can use the D3 filter just after your reader.*

*Seb*

Subject: [Paraview] Empty line printed from each core in
 coprocessorinitializewithpython() when doing in-situ
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D87519105150071B4B@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

In our in-situ run linking our simulation to ParaView Catalyst, I found an empty line was always printed from each core during Catalyst initialization (in coprocessorinitializewithpython() call). Although this is not a big deal, it becomes annoying when running on large number of cores. I traced the issue down some time ago and it appeared the empty line was printed from the statement "vtkPythonInterpreter::RunSimpleString(loadPythonModules.str().c_str());" in InitializePython() function in vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline.cxx. This empty line printout occurred in all ParaView versions we have tried including versions 3.98, 4.0.1, and 4.1.0. I am wondering whether anybody else has experienced this minor but sometimes annoying issue, and whether I can get some suggestions/ideas to possibly remove the empty line printout during Catalyst initialization.

Thanks,
Hong

Hi Andy,

Done, the issue ID is 0014781. I did not find an input to assign it to you, but I indicated it in the description. I did assign the project to be Catalyst.

Thanks,

Hello!

I am trying to run paraview on a server, but when I do, I get this error:

Xlib:  extension "NV-GLX" missing on display "localhost:10.0".

What is this error? And how am I supposed to solve it?

Try running glxgears.  I wonder if you don?t have OpenGL installed.

Or, do you mean you are actually trying to run pvserver on a cluster?

No I am simply trying to run ParaView on a server computer, and I am
getting this error. I think OpenGL is missing, but could there be something
else?

Which OS and which version of the NVIDIA driver are you using?  Try running the command  'cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version? to see which version you?re running. If on ubuntu 14.04 LTS make sure you have latest 331 (for bare metal) or 337 beta if on EC2.  Nouveau and bumblebee drivers are historically problematic and it?s best to purge and blacklist them and install the drivers from NVIDIA when you see these types of errors.

Hi Dave,


Many thanks for Your quick answer. I checked exporting the labels of selections, 
where the text export works as expected (SVG attached).
For using Paraview SVG export in latex it would still be very nice to have the 
same export functionality for the cube axes. Should I reopen the former 
feature-request/fix or open a new one just to keep track in the system should 
the VTK implementation become stable?

Many thanks for Your help.
Roman

Concerning the clipping of volume data when doing volume rendering is done more 
precise in paraview than often necessary: even individual voxels are clipped. 
With such large data this is likely not visible at all. I therefore tried to use 
the vtkImplicitFunctionToImageStencil to create a paraview plugin. Sadly so far 
that can only be done outside paraview. See this thread:
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2013-August/028988.html
and on mantis:

pqActiveObjects is not available on the server side. It's a construct
used by the client alone to keep track of what's active. Where is this
call being made? In a filter/reader/writer code? That's not
recommended (rather possible).

Subject: [Paraview] Linking Catalyst example samples with Catalyst
Message-ID: <1B75FE20F814944EA42F9A3A76476C253C2455D7A8@HQMAIL03.nvidia.com>

Greetings
I am examining the example code for catalyst from Andy Bauer's git repository  (https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode).
I am trying to learn about the catalyst workflow before using it in my own in situ examples.

To this end, I built catalyst from the nightly samples in the paraview download page (http://www.paraview.org/download/). However, I was unable to run the examples satisfactorily.


1)      The method of extending the paraview source tree failed from the sources given in the above page (paraview 4.1)

python catalyze.py -i Editions/Base -o ../catalyst_src

fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Error: Command '['git', 'rev-parse', '--show-toplevel']' returned non-zero exit status 128



2)  I tried two of the catalyst sources

a.  Base+python: This builds properly and links with the example code (CxxFullExample)

b.  Base+essentials+extras+python: This also builds and links with the example code, but I get the following runtime error:

ERROR: In /home/praveen/projects/catalyst/failed/base+essentials+extras+python/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxyDefinitionManager.cxx, line 565

a)  Logs: base+essentials+extras+python_CxxFullExample.log base+essentials+extras+python_CMakeLists.txt,



3)  The build base+python runs the example code, but does not connect with catalyst. Furthermore, upon running make test to test with the sample python script in 'SampleScripts' (which basically invokes CxxFullExample with the python script as an input argument, I get errors stating that it cannot load some vtk modules, which upon looking turn out not to be built at all

a.  Logs: LastTest.log (python script), and base+python_CMakeLists.txt for the catalyst build.





I would like to know what I am missing in these builds. It appears that some of the vtk modules are not being built:
Error: Could not import vtkCommonComputationalGeometryPython
Error: Could not import vtkRenderingCorePython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerDefaultPython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerRenderingPython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVAnimationPython


What is the correct way to get a working run for the examples supplied. Also, how do we connect to catalyst after this?  My understanding is that we just load up paraview (4.1) and then the simulation would connect to catalyst after we hit 'Connect to Catalyst' and load up the 'Coprocessing' plugin. Does paraview have to be built from source?
More specifically, is there a particular download version that might work, and what flags do we turn on in CMakeLists.txt? Is there any other set of examples (although I think the git examples demonstrate the workflow quite properly) that we could use to try catalyst?

Thanks
Praveen.

Hi Praveen,

My suggestion would be to start with a build of ParaView 4.1. Build it with
MPI, Python and Catalyst enabled (Catalyst should be enabled by default but
MPI and Python need to be explicitly turned on). The Catalyst editions are
meant to be subsets of ParaView that get rid of specific functionality that
may not be needed for certain simulation runs. This helps for decreasing
executable size but can make it slightly more confusing. See
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/606 for an explanation on that. At
one time I tested the Catalyst examples with several of the editions but
haven't tried it recently so it's possible that something broke.

As for the Connect to Catalyst option in the ParaView GUI, I've never
tested that with any of the Catalyst editions so it's possible that they
don't work with the "live in situ" connection. Again, using a full ParaView
4.1 build should work here though. We're in the process of improving the
line in situ connection right now for a project that ends in August. This
should vastly improve the usability of this.

I'm not sure I answered all of your questions but my goal was more to get
you past some issues and then we can help you focus on the other parts that
come up as well as making everything work more efficiently together.

Regards,
Andy

So, first, there is no requirement to use a Catalyst-the-build to use
Catalyst-the-coprocessing-API. Catalyst builds are meant for use where a
smaller ParaView is a better fit (super computing, lower memory
constraints, etc.). The naming is indeed confusing :( .

You can give `-r <dir>` to tell it the top-level of the source tree.
Without it, it will try and find the top-level using git, which won't
work for tarballs. I'll improve the error message.

When do these errors pop up? The Catalyst build trees are slimmed down
ParaView builds and don't have everything under the sun included (e.g.,
animation classes are missing). If you need other classes, another
edition should be made to include the required classes and proxies.

Catalyst builds do not build all ParaView modules, so some missing is
expected.

The way I've done it is that the simulation loads up Catalyst (using
the vtkCPProcessor class). ParaView can create Python scripts for use
with vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline, but if there is a way to use
ParaView-the-application with in-situ runs, I don't know it. Andy?

>From a full build, PARAVIEW_ENABLE_CATALYST=ON should be all that is
necessary. From a Catalyst build, the same should be sufficient, but for
any VTK or ParaView classes which you require, you will need to create
an edition to bring them in.

Thanks Andy. It is a bit of a pain to see the examples fail to run after the long paraview build process.
Can?t you bundle the examples along with the paraview sources?

I will keep posted.
Thanks
Praveen.

I am examining the example code for catalyst from Andy Bauer?s git repository  (https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode).
I am trying to learn about the catalyst workflow before using it in my own in situ examples.

To this end, I built catalyst from the nightly samples in the paraview download page (http://www.paraview.org/download/). However, I was unable to run the examples satisfactorily.


1)      The method of extending the paraview source tree failed from the sources given in the above page (paraview 4.1)

python catalyze.py -i Editions/Base -o ../catalyst_src

fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Error: Command '['git', 'rev-parse', '--show-toplevel']' returned non-zero exit status 128



2)  I tried two of the catalyst sources

a.  Base+python: This builds properly and links with the example code (CxxFullExample)

b.  Base+essentials+extras+python: This also builds and links with the example code, but I get the following runtime error:

(which basically invokes CxxFullExample with the python script as an input argument, I get errors stating that it cannot load some vtk modules, which upon looking turn out not to be built at all

a.  Logs: LastTest.log (python script), and base+python_CMakeLists.txt for the catalyst build.





I would like to know what I am missing in these builds. It appears that some of the vtk modules are not being built:
Error: Could not import vtkCommonComputationalGeometryPython
Error: Could not import vtkRenderingCorePython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerDefaultPython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerRenderingPython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVAnimationPython


What is the correct way to get a working run for the examples supplied. Also, how do we connect to catalyst after this?  My understanding is that we just load up paraview (4.1) and then the simulation would connect to catalyst after we hit ?Connect to Catalyst? and load up the ?Coprocessing? plugin. Does paraview have to be built from source?
More specifically, is there a particular download version that might work, and what flags do we turn on in CMakeLists.txt? Is there any other set of examples (although I think the git examples demonstrate the workflow quite properly) that we could use to try catalyst?

Hi Felipe,

The general approach would be:

- create a VTK singleton class, say vtkPxdmfSettings
- configure your settings proxy group to use this settings class as follows:

<ProxyGroup name="settings">
    <SettingsProxy name="PxdmfSettings" label="Pxdmf"
      processes="client|dataserver|renderserver"
      class="vtkPxdmfSettings">
      <Documentation>
        Custom settings for Pxdmf plugin.
      </Documentation>

      <IntVectorProperty name="GUIMaxNbModes"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="0">
        <Documentation>
        </Documentation>
        <!-- Note that if you include the hint below, this setting will be
saved to the Qt settings -->
        <Hints>
          <SaveInQSettings />
        </Hints>
      </IntVectorProperty>
    </SettingsProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>

- Create your custom VTK filter and set up the XML as usual
- Within your VTK filter, access the singleton class you created in the
first step and read the settings file in the constructor

For a concrete example, take a look at how this is done for the
RenderViewSettings in the following files:

The singleton class for settings:
ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkPVRenderViewSettings.cxx

The XML for the singleton class:
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Default/settings.xml

A VTK filter that accesses the settings singleton and setting values:
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Rendering/vtkSMRepresentationTypeDomain.cxx

The hint SaveInQSettings tells ParaView to save the setting in the Qt .ini
file - you don't need to include it, but I suspect you may have it in your
settings XML. It may also be saved to the JSON file if this hint is present
(which could be considered a bug), so that might be why you are seeing the
setting in two places.

Hope that helps,
Cory

The FOAM reader should read the data in parallel. Try changing the CaseType
property from Reconstructed (meaning OpenFOAM did the gather) to Decomposed
(meaning OpenFOAM left the data as the parallel nodes in the simulation
wrote them) case and see if that helps.

Subject: [Paraview] Make animation from steady state result
In-Reply-To: <CANjZAi-e_UYeBDgMin1AC5GZHwdWdnfOE8Oh8bi+pjecepyUsA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CFB7569A.18843%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Here's a more expanded list of steps outlining the solution David gave in case you are not very familiar with the contour filter and animation controls in ParaView.

1. Create the streamlines as you normally would.

2. Add a Contour filter to the streamline (third toolbar, second button from the left).
2.a. Change the Contour By property to IntegrationTime.
2.b. Press Apply.
This little trick will create a point on each streamline at a particular time in the particle advection simulation that created the streamlines.

3. Open the Animation View (View -> Animation View)
3.a. On the bottom row, select the contour filter in the first chooser box and Isosurfaces in the second chooser box. Then hit the blue plus button at the left.
3.b. Make sure Mode is set to Sequence and change No. Frames to 100.
3.c. Hit the play button in the VCR controls (green triangle in the top toolbar). You will see the dots animate over the streamlines.
3.d. You can adjust the speed of the animation by changing the No. Frames.

4. If you want to see glyphs instead of dots, just add the glyph filter to the output of the contour filter.

BTW, props to Jean Favre for originally posting this solution to the ParaView mailing list (http://markmail.org/message/ms57z7jjubh2pzjg).

Make an isocontour of the streamlines' integrationTime variable.
Then in animation view, make a track for the isocontour value.

Hi all,

I got steady state solution for my problem. After plotting streamlines at steady state, I would like to make animation showing moving of spheres (resulted from Glyph filter) on the streamlines, the spheres' velocity should be defined by the flow velocity. How can I make this?
Any suggestion would be very much appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

For structured data, prefer the "Extract Subset" filter to the "Clip"
filter. Subset works in the topological space and therefore preserves the
implicitly defined geometry and topology.

Once you reduce the size to something manageable with that, (either through
subrange or striding) then the filters that change representation to
unstructured can be useable.

The best practices chapters of the paraview guide and tutorial explain in
more detail.

I got a 'working' build as suggested by turning on the mpi and python flags from within the paraview 4.1 source distribution - these were not turned on in my earlier builds. I was able to play with the examples so that they dumped data files. Turning on the 'Connect to Catalyst' button in the paraview GUI with coprocessing on loads the data. 
The data outputted does not seem very meaningful, but we can see the grid that was generated. 

The live visualization switch in the python script provided seemingly loads the data. But it then crashes with an MPI error which I will report on later.

So, first, there is no requirement to use a Catalyst-the-build to use Catalyst-the-coprocessing-API. Catalyst builds are meant for use where a smaller ParaView is a better fit (super computing, lower memory constraints, etc.). The naming is indeed confusing :( .

You can give `-r <dir>` to tell it the top-level of the source tree.
Without it, it will try and find the top-level using git, which won't work for tarballs. I'll improve the error message.g

When do these errors pop up? The Catalyst build trees are slimmed down ParaView builds and don't have everything under the sun included (e.g., animation classes are missing). If you need other classes, another edition should be made to include the required classes and proxies.

Catalyst builds do not build all ParaView modules, so some missing is expected.

The way I've done it is that the simulation loads up Catalyst (using the vtkCPProcessor class). ParaView can create Python scripts for use with vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline, but if there is a way to use ParaView-the-application with in-situ runs, I don't know it. Andy?

From a full build, PARAVIEW_ENABLE_CATALYST=ON should be all that is necessary. From a Catalyst build, the same should be sufficient, but for any VTK or ParaView classes which you require, you will need to create an edition to bring them in.

Thanks for passing this on. I am using  PV 4.1.0, maybe it was written 
for an earlier version of PV. I did step 2, but step 2a ( Change the 
Contour By property to IntegrationTime), I do not see this option.
I downloaded the PV 4.1.0 binaries, could that be the problem?

No, that should not be any different for 4.1.0 or earlier versions.
You do not see a "Contour By" widget at all on the Properties panel
for the "Contour" filter, is that so? Or is that the "IntegrationTime"
value is not available in the comb-box next to that property?

Hi All,

I am getting following linker errors while building paraview libraries in visual studio 2010 on Windows 7 64 bit machine. From the errors it is clear that I am using 32 bit of QT module instead of 64 bit. Does anybody know where can I get the 64 bit of QT4.8.6?

No. Experimental Qt 5 support is only available in the development
version of ParaView.

You can always build Qt from source. It's fairly straight forward, it
just takes time.

I got the QT 64bit from the following link. Hope it works.

You can always build Qt from source. It's fairly straight forward, it just takes time.

Subject: [Paraview] missing MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES
Message-ID: <5395D83C.6010705@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr>

Hello,

I'm using the MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() key to pass information of the 
maximum number of piececs that my reader can provide. It appears that 
this key no longer exists ? If it has been removed, why ? Is there any 
bad behaviors observed using thi method ? Or maybe it has been moved in 
another class ?

Thanks in advance,

Yves

Hi Yves,

Here is the part that you might be interested.

Someone else may comment and explain the WHY but at least that give you the
new way. ;-)

int vtkSphereSource::RequestInformation(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info object
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  outInfo->Set(CAN_HANDLE_PIECE_REQUEST(), 1);

  return 1;
}

You can also look at {VTK-src}/Filters/Parallel/vtkPSphereSource.cxx
For the request data.

Seb

I'm looking into this. I can indeed reproduce the issue that the
threshold is not "truely" respected when rendering volumes. I'll track
it down. Thanks for reporting.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview & HDF5/XDMF: how to control memory usage?
Message-ID: <539618C4.5050003@mailbox.tu-berlin.de>

Hi, All.

I'm an using paraview for quite some time now, in conjunction with HDF5
and XDMF (the XMF descriptor is generated "manually", i.e. not by the
XDMF library tool)

Everything is working smoothly for small enough datasets; I have several
time steps and several quantities per time step, they all appear as desired.

Now, my question is whether I can influence the way paraview loads this
data from HDD into memory. It seems to me that not only paraview loads
all quantities of a given time step into memory, even if this is
currently unnecessary, because some quantities are not used yet. It also
tries to load data from several time steps. The latter is a big problem
for me, since right now I have to create one XMF file per time step,
load it, and so on, as opposed to just have all time steps in one XMF
file and use paraviews forward/backward buttons, if my data is too big.

Regards
Thomas

That was quick :-) I thought it would take a bit longer for people to
notice this change. Here is documentation:

I am going to send out a note and write some sort of blog on this soon.

Subject: [Paraview] max_by_block
Message-ID: <9047EE0D4D3C8E43B93980DA10A073809C2FB651@EXMB04.srn.sandia.gov>


Hi,
I am coloring blocks by the maximum value of a variable that occurs within that given block.  I am dealing with a large number of blocks, so I don't want to extract each block and color one by one.

I'm currently using the python calculator to do this, since the function "max()" returns block-by-block maximum (scalar), which is what I want.  The issue is that paraview doesn't return the returned value as an array, so using the maximum values per block directly in an expression doesn't work.  I'm using a pretty sad-looking syntax to get the job done.  My expression is something along the lines of:

Expression:   ((von_mises - von_mises)+1)*max(von_mises)

So, I'm creating an array of 1's for each cell and then scaling it by the maximum value in a given block.  There must be a better way of doing this, right?  Something like "max_by_block()" or "create_cell_array_ones()."  If not, perhaps that could become a feature request.

Thanks,
Alan

It has to parse the entire xml file to determine the scope of the entire
data, but it should only read into memory the enabled arrays from the
enabled blocks for the current time step. If it isn't doing that you've
probably found a new bug.

Is this a dataset that you can send me so that I can take a look at it? I'm
working on the next generation xdmf reader/writer with ARL right now and
I'ld like to see if the new reader does better with your data.

Hi, All.

I'm an using paraview for quite some time now, in conjunction with HDF5
and XDMF (the XMF descriptor is generated "manually", i.e. not by the
XDMF library tool)

Everything is working smoothly for small enough datasets; I have several
time steps and several quantities per time step, they all appear as desired.

Now, my question is whether I can influence the way paraview loads this
data from HDD into memory. It seems to me that not only paraview loads
all quantities of a given time step into memory, even if this is
currently unnecessary, because some quantities are not used yet. It also
tries to load data from several time steps. The latter is a big problem
for me, since right now I have to create one XMF file per time step,
load it, and so on, as opposed to just have all time steps in one XMF
file and use paraviews forward/backward buttons, if my data is too big.

Regards
Thomas

Simply max(von_mises) doesn't do it? The calculator is supposed to convert
scalars to arrays automatically but maybe there is an issue there...

PS: This is somewhat ironic. I am working on changes to support things like
min/max over all blocks. Those changes would make min/max over block
impossible :-) So I guess we want both. What would a good function name for
XXX per block be?

Allow me to add my 2 cents to this thread, since Dave talks about a new generation xdmf reader/writer in the making.

I too use a series of files for each timestep ( one XMF file and one HDF5 file per step), since I have discovered that creating temporal collections does not work correctly if the grid resolution changes over the timesteps. I have a multi-resolution simulation. The grid starts at low res., then the resolution steadily increases. Using a temporal collection in XDMF, the grid resolution of the first grid in the temporal collection is used throughout the full time series. I see my data is read correctly, but is truncated by the lowest resolution bounds.

I hope this gets fixed with the new reader.
TIA.

Hi,
I got a basic client-server set-up working -- in this instance where I have direct access to both machines and the server is not 'headless' . the rendering of volume data seems fast as I expect , but oddly some 'not-rendering' tasks seem to be unusually slow; such as opening the 'file open' dialog box , any ideas ?? 
This is Linux Red hat EL 6 with GNOME desktop , I can ask the admins about any more detailed configurations.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C43Jb1aoRKjX6X2TxD__168Yo8dT67tv8KMcJt_i-_xNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I setup a quick start to ParaView Web. I have  a question. In ParaView  I
have no problem opening my (*.h5) file using PFLOTRAN hdf5 reader.

In ParaView Web I have put my datafiles (*.h5) in the Share folder as It
was mentioned in the guide. ParaView Web doen?t open my *.h5  while it
works fine opening other data files.

Is there anything aditional I should do for my *.h5 files to open in
ParaView Web ?

Also one more questions, where can I find all filters that exists in
ParaView ? When I try to apply a filter on my datasets in ParaView Web, I
only see a few basic list of filters. How can I improve my experience with
ParaView Web ?

Thanks a lot.

Is it just the opening of the file dialog box that's slow or are there
any other operations that are slow too? If it's just the dialog, then
it may a because of the file system? Parallel file systems can be
notoriously slow for operations like directory listings. The dialog
does try to list the "current" directory and as well as get
information about the listed files/directories. Could that potentially
be the problem?

You can use the "Extract Subset" filter, however that does not  give
you an widget to play with instead you have to enter the i,j,k values
to subset out.

Alternatively if you are not interested in a volume but just a "slice"
through the data, then you can simply change the "Representation" type
from "Outline" or "Surface" to "Slice". You should then can move the
slice plane using the widgets under "Slicing" group on the Properties
Panel.

> I don't quite understand what the intended purpose of 'clip' is if not this? Is it for clipping meshes then rather than clipping volume images?

That is correct. Clip is intended for non structured datasets or when
you need non-orthogonal clipped volumes but at the cost of more
memory.

Hi,

to add filters in the list if available one you will need to use an extra
argument when you run the pvpython command line.

You should use the "--filter" shown here

with a file that has a content similar to that

Regarding your file opening issue, this is more complicated.
I believe that ParaView has several reader for that file extension and
inside ParaView, you have a popup window asking you which one.
Which we don't have in pvw. You may want to create a custom reader
definition (XML file that you load at startup using --plugin ) with a
unique extension that use the proper reader for your custom file extension.

If open data is slow, how long does it take to do an 'ls' in the directory?  If your directory has too many files in it, Linux itself slows down.  ParaView has to do a "stat" command on every file, trying to figure out if it is just a file or a directory.

The way around this is to put different parts of your simulation in sub directories.  I.e., restarts in a different directory than your output.

Hi,
I got a basic client-server set-up working -- in this instance where I have direct access to both machines and the server is not 'headless' . the rendering of volume data seems fast as I expect , but oddly some 'not-rendering' tasks seem to be unusually slow; such as opening the 'file open' dialog box , any ideas ?? 
This is Linux Red hat EL 6 with GNOME desktop , I can ask the admins about any more detailed configurations.

Thanks
Robert

Hi All,

I have one question regarding this conversation, as I have run into this 
issue before. It intrigues me as to why one can't clip a structured data 
set efficiently.

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-December/026976.html

The question I have is - does clip REALLY require all that memory - in 
my case it was a structured grid of 698x693x665 growing to in excess of 
20 GB (see the question on the list above). That seems pretty excessive 
given the original size of the data set... I haven't done the math on 
the data set size of an unstructured data set, but 320MB to 20GB is a 
pretty big step.

Assuming one does need 20GB of memory for an unstructured data set of 
this size (making it impractical to use clip), is there not an 
implementation of clip that can run on structured data. This seems like 
a common operation that one would want to perform, and therefore seems 
like something that would be worth implementing for structured data.

I find a clip on a volume to be extremely useful, as you can slice 
through a plane in the data and see the internal structure of the data 
set at the clip plane location. This is a very useful exploratory 
capability. Slice just doesn't cut it (pun intended 8-) from this 
perspective...

Thanks for the interesting discussion, this one has intrigued (and 
frustrated) me for some time. I would think implementing clip on 
structured data would be possible (probably simpler than on unstructured 
data) and would be quite a useful tool for exploratory analysis of large 
gridded data sets... Am I missing something - Is there a reason why such 
a thing doesn't exist?

Very likely.

imagedata
origin + extent + spacing ~= 36 bytes #(x,y,z + ni,nj,nk + sx,sy,sz) *
4bytes per word
(700^3 * 4)/(1024^3) = 1.27 GB #to store one scalar value on each point

unstructured grid
points array = (700^3 * 3 * 4)/(1024^3) = 3.8 GB #3=x,y,z, 4=4bytes per word
cellarray = (699^3 * 9 * 4)/*(1024^3) = 11.45GB, #1 numverts + 8 vertex
index
celltype = (699^3 * 4)/(1024^3) = 1.27GB
celllink = (700^3*9*4)/(1024^3) = 11.5GB #1 numcells + 8 using cells per
vert
(700^3 * 4)/(1024^3) = 1.27 GB #to store one scalar value on each point

(Someone check me on all of that please).

But yes, a clip like widget to something like Extract Subset that is easy
to use AND preserves the data type would be a really nice thing to have in
ParaView.

Hello

I would also like to that it is great to hear that a next generation XDMF
reader is in the works for Paraview. I've used XDMF files very successfully
with Paraview; both manually generated XML to go with NetCDF4 as well as
HDF5/XML files generated using the XDMF2 API.

The only rough spot I've had with the existing Paraview XDMF reader is that
it seems to use more and more memory when generating a time series
animation. If the dataset is large enough, the Paraview process will
eventually run out of memory. I have an unchanging unstructured mesh with
nodally centered data and a temporal collection with one XML file and one
heavy data file containing all time steps.

I can provide a link to full size data files if that helps the
development/test process.

Cheers
Jason

Hi sebastien,

Thanks for your answer.  I could add additional filters to ParaView Web by
adding them manually to the file protocol.py in
....ParaView 4.1.0\lib\paraview-4.1\site-packages\paraview\web\protocol.py

but I didnot have any success in using "--filter" or "--filters"   and
addressing it to a *.json somewhere on my machine.

I have attached the filtersFile.json I am addressing to with this email. Is
there anything I am doing wrong?

The server seems to connect :
 Log opened.
 Site starting on 8080
 Starting factory <twisted.web.server.Site instance at 0x000000000C896548>

The index.html seems to be loaded but nothing more is added after.  Is
there anyway I can fix this ?

Also about the --plugin xml reader, is there any tutorial or sample on how
to create this xml for my specific reader ?

Thanks a lot in Advance

Hi,

the issue in the file was related to the format that you were using. To
make it work, just replace the ' (simple quote) with the regular string
quote ".

This could be a good start for the XML info.

Hello,

I know it's a bit off-topic, but since the next generation xdmf 
reader/write was mentioned in here:

Will the new XDMF reader have a "Reload"/"Refresh" functionality?

I'm currently using a workaround suggested by Sebastien [1], which works 
fine.
The topic has also been discussed here [2], with no outcome I believe.

Cheers,
Armin Wehrfritz

Hi David,

I guess I am a bit surprised at the significant jump in memory, although 
I suppose I shouldn't be in thinking about it in more detail. Thanks for 
doing the math 8-)

Given the above, it isn't really practical to use the clip filter on 
volume data set sizes of significant size unless you have a mondo big 
memory computer. At the same time, clipping is a very powerful technique 
for exploration. It is one of my favorite filters to use when looking at 
a new dataset.

Utkarsh suggests using "Extract Subset" or "Slice" but both are somewhat 
limited compared to an arbitrary clip plane. Extract subset results in 
clipping only along the data set axes and slice doesn't show internal 
structure around the slice plane.

Are there any other alternatives to getting an arbitrary clip plane on a 
large volume data set without blowing out the memory? Has anyone come up 
with any clever tricks?

For me this is mostly curiosity driven, as I am no longer working on the 
project that sparked my Dec 2012 email, but clearly there are some 
people that are struggling with this issue still (e.g. Robert).

Brian

Subject: [Paraview] XSEDE Visualization Showcase -- share your
 accomplishments and innovative ideas
Message-ID: <53989627.3090608@lbl.gov>

Hi All,

Forwarding a note from organizers of the annual XSEDE conference, it's a 
great place to showcase your work and make connections.

Burlen

The XSEDE steering committee would like to encourage you to share your 
accomplishments and innovative ideas through the submission of an 
abstract to the Visualization Showcase. The deadline has been extended 
until June 17, 2014.

Each year the quality of the XSEDE Conference continues to improve as a 
result of the excellent submissions from the HPC community. This year we 
decided to broaden our horizons by also including research from 
non-traditional HPC scientific areas including, but not limited to, 
digital humanities, bioinformatics, etc., and research completed on 
systems outside of XSEDE.

For further information and guidelines for submission, please visit 
https://conferences.xsede.org/web/conference/xsede14/call-for-participation#Visualisation.

The XSEDE14 Conference will be held July 13-18, 2014. Looking forward to 
seeing in you Atlanta!

A question from one of my users.  Anyone have any ideas?  I know how to solve the 5 discrete color question, but the out of range one stumps me.  (This bug was written up as bug 6657).

Thanks,

Alan



I remember we had some discussion a while back about creating legends and wanted to follow-up with you. Is there a way for me to reproduce a legend like the one I'm attaching here?
[cid:66ADF209-47A6-439B-BE86-2B71ABB45B7E]

Ideally, I'd like to use the default color scheme (with 5 discrete colors) but then also add magenta and cyan to highlight data that is outside of a certain range. Let's say I have information to color in the default scheme from 1 to 10, but I want everything below 1 to be cyan and above 10 to be magenta. Can I explicitly tell Paraview to do that? If so, how might that be done in the most recent version?

Out-of-range colors are not supported yet. For non-discrete colors, you can
hack it by adding extra control points above and below the region of
interest, but that's only a hack and not available for categorical/discrete
colors.

Thanks.  My best idea was to create three filters ? clip by scalar for data below the acceptable minimum (solid color), another for above the accepted maximum (solid color), and third within range (discrete colors).  Hacky, and the outside range colors won?t show on the color legend, but it should work.

I have not looked at the discreet colour legends myself, but I would work hard to avoid using the clip filters to separate out the good/bad data.
If I had to do it, I?d replace the scalars to colours painter with one that stuffed in the colour I wanted in the out of bounds areas.

Actually, that would mean sub classing the representation and overriding the painter build chain - which is ok, but it wouldn?t make the legend on screen change, so perhaps it?s not so useful after all.

pretend I didn?t post this email, (but consider it anyway, just in case! - I?ve been creating custom representation recently and got a bit carried away with what you can do)

Thanks.  My best idea was to create three filters ? clip by scalar for data below the acceptable minimum (solid color), another for above the accepted maximum (solid color), and third within range (discrete colors).  Hacky, and the outside range colors won?t show on the color legend, but it should work.

Out-of-range colors are not supported yet. For non-discrete colors, you can hack it by adding extra control points above and below the region of interest, but that's only a hack and not available for categorical/discrete colors.

I remember we had some discussion a while back about creating legends and wanted to follow-up with you. Is there a way for me to reproduce a legend like the one I?m attaching here?
[cid:image001.png at 01CF8635.F13EFF20]

Ideally, I?d like to use the default color scheme (with 5 discrete colors) but then also add magenta and cyan to highlight data that is outside of a certain range. Let?s say I have information to color in the default scheme from 1 to 10, but I want everything below 1 to be cyan and above 10 to be magenta. Can I explicitly tell Paraview to do that? If so, how might that be done in the most recent version?

NaN's are added for those points along the line that don't fall within
any cell in the dataset. There should also be "vtkValidPointMask"
array which will corroborate that. It's 1 at valid locations and 0 at
others.

Hi,

I am attempting to write a structured mesh, which I've attached. When I 
open it in paraview, only the first cell is displayed. When I look in 
the information panel, the extent is correct, but the bounds only shows 
the bounds of the first cell, and only the first cell is displayed. This 
happens for ImageData, RectilinearGrids, and StructuredGrid. I am really 
at a loss as to what is going on. I am using Paraview 4.1.0. Any help 
will be greatly appreciated.

Not sure if this is the right thread to ask since my original installation difficulties have now resolved themselves. 

A few days ago, miniFE instrumented with catalyst was put up at Andy Bauer's git repo (https://github.com/acbauer/miniFE-2.0_ref_Catalyst), which I built (successful- first make the adaptor and then make the main code) and tried running (unsuccessful). 

From what I see, we should call the python pipeline creator by appending the name of the file gridwriter.py. However, I cannot get it to show any of the data rendered on screen when it does the coprocessing although Catalyst::coprocessor creates vtk data structures both for the grid and the data associated with the grid, and the python script creates the pipeline in the method doCoprocessing (is that the correct interpretation?)

Currently, it connects to catalyst and executes the pipeline since it dumps data files to the disc and generally responds to the simulation. {\bf But I cannot get it to render anything live}.

Thanks
Praveen.

So, first, there is no requirement to use a Catalyst-the-build to use Catalyst-the-coprocessing-API. Catalyst builds are meant for use where a smaller ParaView is a better fit (super computing, lower memory constraints, etc.). The naming is indeed confusing :( .

You can give `-r <dir>` to tell it the top-level of the source tree.
Without it, it will try and find the top-level using git, which won't work for tarballs. I'll improve the error message.

When do these errors pop up? The Catalyst build trees are slimmed down ParaView builds and don't have everything under the sun included (e.g., animation classes are missing). If you need other classes, another edition should be made to include the required classes and proxies.

Catalyst builds do not build all ParaView modules, so some missing is expected.

The way I've done it is that the simulation loads up Catalyst (using the vtkCPProcessor class). ParaView can create Python scripts for use with vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline, but if there is a way to use ParaView-the-application with in-situ runs, I don't know it. Andy?

From a full build, PARAVIEW_ENABLE_CATALYST=ON should be all that is necessary. From a Catalyst build, the same should be sufficient, but for any VTK or ParaView classes which you require, you will need to create an edition to bring them in.

Daon,

In the vti format, the Whole Extent and Piece Extent are integers, and refer to indices of the cells in each dimension, while Spacing refers to the spacing between each cell.  Looking at your vti file, your extents are 0 to 1, which results in one cell, which goes from 0.0 to 0.125.  If your intent is to have multiple cells, which have a total bounds of 0.0 to 1.0, with a spacing of 0.125 between cells, change your extents to be 0 8, rather than 0 1.

Hope that helps,
joe

Hi Praveen,

You need to check the Live Visualization box when exporting the script (the
first option in the image below). There is an overhead to checking for the
live connection (it's fairly small but possibly not negligible for explicit
simulations with a small enough amount of cells per process) so that's part
of the thinking behind having the user explicitly specify that.

If you haven't done this, instead of just recreating the script you can
just change "coprocessor.EnableLiveVisualization(False)" to pass in True
instead. I'll update gridwriter.py in the repo to have that change as well.

Also, the way things are set up with miniFE, I wouldn't call it a
connection to Catalyst since Catalyst is used as a library instead of an
external process. I just wanted to make it clear that it's not the typical
client-server connection that's used here.

Regards,
Andy
