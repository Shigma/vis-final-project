Subject: [Paraview] [import error] Paraview Python on Windows
Message-ID: <CAEqguQamToxPu2CA+4au52qS0PGvHvLnVxLcm3X9C=JtyH5ceg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am using ParaView-4.2.0-Linux-64bit-gl on  Kubuntu 12.04. . I have some
python scripts that create pictures and it is working fine.

Now i want to use those scripts on Windows 7 64bit. I downloaded
ParaView-4.2.0-Windows-64bit
and changed PythonPath and Path variable as described in this
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting>article:

On Linux i have the following settings (i set them in .bashrc):
PYTHONPATH:
/sfw/paraview/ParaView-4.2.0-Linux-64bit-gl/lib/paraview-4.2:
/sfw/paraview/ParaView-4.2.0-Linux-64bit-gl/lib/paraview-4.2/site-packages/:
/sfw/paraview/ParaView-4.2.0-Linux-64bit-gl/lib/paraview-4.2:
/sfw/paraview/ParaView-4.2.0-Linux-64bit-gl/lib/paraview-4.2/site-packages/vtk/:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
/sfw/paraview/ParaView-4.2.0-Linux-64bit-gl/lib/paraview-4.2/:


Now i set Pythonpath in Windows to:
(python location);
P:\ParaView-4.2.0-Windows-64bit\lib\paraview-4.2;
P:\ParaView-4.2.0-Windows-64bit\lib\paraview-4.2\site-packages\;
P:\ParaView-4.2.0-Windows-64bit\lib\paraview-4.2;
P:\ParaView-4.2.0-Windows-64bit\lib\paraview-4.2\site-packages\vtk\;
And path to
P:\ParaView-4.2.0-Windows-64bit\lib\paraview-4.2\;

But when i try 'from paraview.simple import *'
i get the following error:

Error: Could not import vtkCommonComputationalGeometryPython
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File

    import servermanager
  File
"P:\ParaView-4.2.0-Windows-64bit\lib\paraview-4.2\site-packages\paraview\

    import paraview, re, os, os.path, new, sys, atexit, vtk
  File

vtk\__init__.py", line 7, in <module>
    from vtkCommonCorePython import *
ImportError: DLL load failed: The modul could not be found. (German: Das

I guess i am not using the proper path (i tried a whole bunch of different
paths), can you send me a path that is working for you?

I assume this is working?

I think this is supposed to be 'bin', not 'lib\paraview-4.2' since the
DLL files live there on Windows.

Using 'bin' seems to work here.

I ran with the following from Git bash (so that the environment was more
easily modified). All paths are relative to where ParaView was
extracted:

    PYTHONPATH="lib/paraview-4.2;lib/paraview-4.2/site-packages;lib/paraview-4.2/site-packages/vtk" PATH="$PATH;bin" /c/Python27/python
    >>> import vtk
    >>>

If I didn't modify PATH, I got the same error you saw, so it seems to be
sufficient.

Utkarsh,

I have had a similar problem as reported by S. T. Cohen. Your solution 
of manually removing the EndTime properties from XML State *.pvsm file 
has worked for me as well.

(In my case, I was picking up two simulation results files both with a 
growing number of time steps. I removed the EndTime properties in two 
locations in the XML sate file. The results are now displayed from 
beginning to end when animated.)

Thank you,

Why aren't coords available to filters in ParaView?  I have a user that wants to threshold on one of the components of coord, and every time he has to use the calculator to get at this variable.

Thanks,

Remember that image data and rectilinear grids don't explicitly store point
locations. Can the cut filter be used instead? He can do the crinkle cut if
he wants the entire cell.

Technically it is because VTK treats them differently than other arrays,
and because for some data types (image data and rectilinear grid) you can't
modify them without altering the data type and potentially blowing up
memory consumption in the process.

That said, I've often wanted an easy to use filter that lets you get access
to these, the normals, and the texture coordinates from the GUI. In
practice I've always used the python filter to do that.

Andy,
You are correct regarding image and rectilinear grids.  And yes, in this particular case, a slice would probably work.  But the real question isn?t about clipping, it?s about exposing the coords variable, making it available to users if they need it for something...

Good explanation.

Would it be worthwhile creating a filter that exposes them (i.e., coords, normals, texture coordinates, etc)  if available, and creates them if not?

Now that we have data array subclasses that provide only iterator-based access, it might be a good idea to revisit this decision. It would be easy to create new arrays that present just one component of explicit coordinates or to present implicit coordinates without allocating memory. It certainly would make a lot of things easier.

Good to know. Like I said, it has been fixed in the development
version of ParaView. Feel free to try the nightly binaries, if you'd
like to test it out.

Fabian,

The only way to this currently, is to use some of the XML processing
libraries  (either from ParaView) or modules provided by Python
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html) to process the XML to
change the filename in the state file before loading it.

Hi Andy,

I tested it for parallel case and it gives same error. I am also planing 
to try to test another OS (i.e. Fedora, Ubuntu). By the way, it could be 
the issue related with VirtualBox (along with activated 3D acceleration) 
but i am not sure. Do you have any experience about it?

Thanks for your reply, i have uploaded a sample here
https://mathmaster.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/index.php/s/UoQ506K29Db6b7E

Notice how the axis labels are blurry while the colobar text looks fine.

This is due to the Cube Axes rendering using an older text rendering
method, vtkVectorText. These don't always export cleanly through the vector
graphics backend.

There is a replacement for the Cube Axes under development that uses newer
methods for rendering text, and this should export much better, and be
similar to the labels you see on the color legend.

Also, there is experimental support in the old Cube Axes actor for using
the newer text renderer. If you can access the cube actor in the python
shell, calling SetUseTextActor3D(True) on it should switch it on.

Hope this helps,

Dave

So I am still having a few issues with the reader. I have checked the
output from the information Panel. And it seems as if all the information
is the same. So maybe the data is getting deleted somehow (I'm not
sure...., but here is a snippet of my code);

int vtkPVPROTOImageReader::RequestInformation (
   vtkInformation*,
   vtkInformationVector**,
   vtkInformationVector* outputVector)
{
   vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
   vtkDataObject::SetPointDataActiveScalarInfo(outInfo, VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR,
1);

   return 1;
}

int vtkPVPROTOImageReader::RequestData(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
                                       vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
                                       vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
   ... conversion code from protobuf

  /* Convert from protobuf to vtkImageData */
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> image = "function converting to protobuf";

  vtkDataArray* scalars = image->GetPointData()->GetScalars();
  scalars->SetName("ReconstructionData");

  /* Get the info object */
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
  outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkImageData");

  /* Get the output */
  vtkImageData* output = vtkImageData::GetData(outputVector);

//  output->SetSpacing(image->GetSpacing());
//  output->SetOrigin(image->GetOrigin());
//  output->AllocateScalars(outInfo);
//  output->GetPointData()->SetScalars(image->GetPointData()->GetScalars());
//  output->SetDimensions(image->GetDimensions());

  output->ShallowCopy(image);

  int* dimensions = output->GetDimensions();

  std::cout << "\nNumber of points: " << output->GetNumberOfPoints() <<
std::endl;
  std::cout << "Number of cells: " << output->GetNumberOfCells() << "\n" <<
std::endl;

// print out the pixel values to see if they are actually present
  for (int z = 0; z < dimensions[2]; z++)
  {
    for (int y = 0; y < dimensions[1]; y++)
    {
      for (int x = 0; x < dimensions[0]; x++)
      {
        double* pixel =
static_cast<double*>(output->GetScalarPointer(x,y,z));
        // do something with v
        std::cout << "pixel value: " << pixel[0] << "\n";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }

  // write output to file and compare in visualization window...
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLImageDataWriter> vtk_writer =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLImageDataWriter>::New();
  vtk_writer->SetInputData(output);
  vtk_writer->SetFileName( "/home/kdean/tmp/foo.vti" );
  vtk_writer->Update();
  vtk_writer->Write();

  return 1;
}


Another Problem I ran into:
So I had to hardcode a file for the char *FileName into the RequestData
Function in order to read any protobuf file. I ran a debugger on the code,
and it seems like these functions from the header file (of the reader):

vtkGetStringMacro(FileName);

Thanks,

Kevin

here are my xml too... it looks right, but maybe I am missing something.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting the extreme value of the coordinates in pvpython
Message-ID: <CACsb-Xm6JN5p_JTu-crr5kD=qYSFom-5QZoh5p+U3kShNJgqAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello community,

I'm writing a pvpython script to export the 3rd component of the velocity
vector on the z-axis of my domain. Here's a fragment of the script used.
Not very refined, but does the trick.

======START OF SCRIPT
#!/bin/pvpython

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

Nstep   = 500
zEnd    = 25

def velZaxis(filename):
W = list(0 for i in range(0,Nstep))
z = list(0.0 for i in range(0,Nstep))

NS_quad_vtk = OpenDataFile(filename)
PlotOverLine1 = PlotOverLine( Source="High Resolution Line Source" )
PlotOverLine1.Source.Point1 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
PlotOverLine1.Source.Point2 = [0.0, 0.0, zEnd]
PlotOverLine1.Source.Resolution = Nstep
for i in range (0,Nstep):
z[i] = i*(zEnd/float(Nstep))
W[i]=servermanager.Fetch(PlotOverLine1,0).GetPointData().GetArray("U+V+W").GetTuple3(i)[2]
return z, W
======END OF SCRIPT


Now, I was wondering if someone could give me some tips on how to set the
value of zEnd based on the actual maximum value in the geometry, instead of
using a fixed value. Is there any recommended way to obtain this
information?

Thanks

Rick,
If this is a debug build, it is to be expected.  Two issues ? one is that release builds should never show warnings, debug builds always print out warnings.  Second issue, which still needs to be fixed, but is smaller, is that the spyplot reader is passing incorrect information to the Progress Handler.  Frankly, I thought I had fixed it a few years ago...

Can you share this dataset?  Is this a debug build?

Hi Kevin.

Your RequestInformation looks a little bare. Unless things have changed 
recently, you might need to set WHOLE_EXTENT, ORIGIN, SPACING, 
CAN_PRODUCE_SUB_EXTENT keys there. and if you support parallel IO honor 
the requested extent in RequestData.

	measurement
Message-ID: <D16D1D73.23E34%kmorel@sandia.gov>

(Responding back to the ParaView user's list, which is more appropriate
than the developer's list.)

The documentation for the mathematical operation done by the curvature
operation is given here:

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCurvatures.html#details


You can also get more general descriptions of Gaussian curvature and mean
curvature estimation from various sources. Here is a description on
Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature#Curvature_of_surfaces


If I am reading the documentation correctly, the Gaussian curvature is
giving you the bend of the surface in radians per distance squared, and
the mean curvature is giving you the bend in radians per distance.

Playing with the filter a bit, I notice that it is prone to give you
unreasonably high values (in the positive or negative direction) for
places where the surface is pinched or you have poorly shaped triangles in
the mesh.

I added a few lines to my script to address this issue. I guess that I
can't see the coordinates array directly in the NS_quad_vtk object due to
the structure of the VTK file. I create a Calculator, calling the z
coordinate as function definition, and then get the maximum of this object.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] File in pipeline browser has changed; best way to reload
Message-ID: <5547EDC4.9060604@ncsu.edu>

Hi all,

I am doing something that most other modellers do: I am visualizing a 
file in my pipeline browser, but I ran a new simulation and now the file 
I am viewing should have changed. What is the best way to reload the 
file/get the new data from the file? So far my google searches have 
yielded this 
<http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-paraview/78129-update-data-paraview.html#post446239> 
as the best result, but it seems quite clumsy.

I've seen in other places people recommend clicking on "update gui", but 
I don't see that button available anywhere in my version of paraview.

Refresh times also doesn't seem to work.

As you can tell, I'm a new paraview user!

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,

I'm using a little python macro to refresh the fileNames Property of all 
readers in the Pipeline. It is located here:
https://github.com/richti83/ParaView_Reader_for_LIGGGHTS/blob/master/python_macros/update.py

Feel free to use this as a starting point.

Best,
Christian.

Hi Alex,

there is a thread from around 2 years ago that proposed a couple of solutions. Especially if you are using a custom reader plugin this provides for a clean and user-friendly approach:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2013-June/028588.html
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2013-June/028596.html (this is the solution we use)

Regards,

Michael

This was not a debug build.       It?s a standard CTH-11.0 generated dataset ?.

Rick,
If this is a debug build, it is to be expected.  Two issues ? one is that release builds should never show warnings, debug builds always print out warnings.  Second issue, which still needs to be fixed, but is smaller, is that the spyplot reader is passing incorrect information to the Progress Handler.  Frankly, I thought I had fixed it a few years ago...

Can you share this dataset?  Is this a debug build?

Michael,

A change has just went into ParaView that should prevent this problem in
the future.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/commit/a57c26237a41955465326a0cde8b586aecada416

If one really wants integer precision in the contour coordinates, it is
still possible with this change.

Thanks,
Cory

awesome, thanks, that did it.

One more question. Is there a way to debug the FileName aspect of the
reader. I can't figure out how it's supposed to get set. The only way I can
get the image to show is by hard
coding it within the RequestData() function.

Thanks Again

ParaView should set it after it determines if the reader can read it. 
Did you also implement CanReadFile? Maybe the problem is in that function.

Subject: [Paraview] How to show models simultaneously at independent
	timesteps
Message-ID: <5fa0b7120a7e457cb4a8e9d90e3c3787@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

A question from a user:

Is there a way to load in multiple simulation files and have them show the results at independent times?  For example: show simulation 1 at time = 10, simulation 2 at time = 20, and simulation 3 at time = 15, with all of them visible simultaneously in the same window.  I tried the "ignore time" option, but all the simulations keep updating when I try to change the time of one.

Thanks,

Alan

Yes. Use the comparative view. There you can specify time for each window
separately but keep the same pipeline across all views.

I am the new student of Paraview and easily lost in some basic details of its application, one of them is eps outputting. I have tried it many times but failed all the while. The color maps may transform automatically into grayscale ones when I use

Export Scene > choosing eps format > canceling Rasterize 3D geometry

There are two examples for describing what I just lost in in E-mail attachments. I want to ask either something error in my operation or something I miss in the basic concepts of Paraview?s usage for my purpose. Seeking your help!

 

Best regards

Not exactly, but look at the Probe filter. It uses a "location" widget
to get a 3D position from the user interactively.

Hi Zuoguang,

For the first image -- what happens with Rasterize 3D Geometry left on? The
GL2PS library used to generate the vector graphics formats can't handle
geometry which is shaded using textures, which I suspect is the issue here.
Rasterizing these objects is, unfortunately, the only way to preserve the
colors that I'm aware of.

For the second image, what does the output ps look like?

Subject: [Paraview] Line Chart View changes from v4.2
Message-ID: <F86E4CD3E4F9BF44879B59DAEBB2391A639400F1@winexc20.host.cr.eurocopter.corp>

Hello,

I have notice that the Line Chart View behaves slightly differently than in versions 4.1 or 4.2. The first change is the inability to resize the columns of the "Series Parameters" box. In previous version one could grab the border of the "Variable" cell and stretch it to so that the variable names were not truncated, now this is not possible anymore, instead the whole piepeline browser pane has to be enlarged.  The other change is the lack of point coordinates as a data array for the X axis, in the previous versions it was possible to make a line plot and view a variable against the X coordinate [Points(0)] for example. Is this a bug or am I missing something?

Thanks,
Lukasz

Dear all,
Does anyone managed to compile the superquadric tensor glyph plugin (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/User_Created_Plugins) for win7? It would be great, if someone could send me the compiled plugin, as I expect compiling the whole pipeline (pv, qt, plugin, etc..) might be quite cumbersome. Many thanks in advance, you would help me a lot!!

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple GPUs per node
Message-ID: <CAPxeKp8ib4=U=R2obczWXnUsUscfjjnhG5=cyoMnZv1XVFS7zA@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to take advantage of all four GPUs on a 32 node Amazon ec2
cluster. However, I seem to only be able to utilize the first GPU.

I run pvserver as follows:

1)  Manually start an X display with the command :   sudo X :0 &
2)  run pvserver with the following command (using OpenMPI's mpirun):
     mpirun -np 16 pvserver -display :0.0 : -np 16 pvserver -display :0.1

When I try to connect the client, I get an error saying that the client
could not connect to the remote display. Everything works fine using
display :0.0 only.

Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong here? Thank you for your time!

John

Dear Dave,

Thanks for your suggestion; I should firstly say sorry for giving an ambiguous description of PS, now here, the PS stands for Photoshop.

Secondly, I have tested another many times for outputting eps, you are very right, choosing ?Rasterize 3D Geometry? when writing the eps files perhaps the only way to record the color map while no choosing may lead to an automatic transformation from the color to grey-scale ones.

But I think this is not a real vector graphics formats since the pixel of it is a constant when the dpi is to be changed. So, recording the color map in tiff format with desired pixel and proper size is the best choice.

 

Best regards

zuoguang Fu

Hello,

I have a time-series of a simulation (2D slices) and trying to animate them (Save Animation functionality). There are around 3000 2D slices each of which corresponds to one instant. However, after processing a certain number (~1600), Paraview apparently freezes, though it continues doing something. The avi file at the end reflects this (normal animation until a point and then the picture is frozen until the end).

I am using Paraview 4.3.1

Any bright ideas?

Many thanks,

Sandeep.

If you have a example script+dataset that you can share (off the list,
if needed) to reproduce this issue, that'd make things easier to
debug.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for responding so quickly. I have no problems sharing the dataset and the script...it is quite large though - probably 10-15 G compressed. I will see what I can do to get a reduced data-set.

Alternatively, how can I set up a debug run so that a trace can be sent to you?

Meanwhile, I think that Version 4.0.0-RC2 doesn't have this issue as I managed to do the complete animation - I'll confirm again with a few more tests but it came out ok. I've copied Martin Larcher on this since he mentions the same problem in an earlier post to the mailing list and this may be of use to him.

Cheers,

Sandeep.

Message-ID: <551D1614.50306 at jrc.ec.europa.eu>

Dear all,
I have the same problem since some weeks. When I try to create a longer 
animation the rendering stops after about 100 steps and the same view is 
shown by changing the time (using vtu files). Sandeep's error 
description sounds very similar. I'm using only standard filters, 
perhaps Contour is quite expensive. And perhaps my models are slightly 
bigger (about 1.6 million cells and a similar number of points).
Some further remarks: I get the problem when I do the playback or even 
when I create an animation. I do not get the problem when I'm using no 
filters (except the read filter). If I remove after the occurrence of 
the error the Contour filter, there seems to be a layer over the output. 
During turning the model I can see it, when I release the mouse it 
disappears...
Any idea?
I'm using 4.3.1 but I have the same with 4.2 and 4.1
Martin

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple GPUs per node

I am trying to take advantage of all four GPUs on a 32 node Amazon ec2 cluster. However, I seem to only be able to utilize the first GPU.

I run pvserver as follows:

1)  Manually start an X display with the command :   sudo X :0 &
2)  run pvserver with the following command (using OpenMPI's mpirun):
     mpirun -np 16 pvserver -display :0.0 : -np 16 pvserver -display :0.1

When I try to connect the client, I get an error saying that the client could not connect to the remote display. Everything works fine using display :0.0 only.

Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong here? Thank you for your time!

John

Hi Constantin,

I wrote said plugin originally and added it to the wiki a few years ago.
The last version I compiled for Windows 7 was for ParaView 3.14.1 32bit.
Not sure whether that build would be suitable for you. Especially since
the implementation of the algorithm is now faster and a few small bugs
have been ironed out. It could help you decide, though, whether it is
worth going through the trouble of compiling the entire tool chain yourself.

Hi Zuoguang,

Try unchecking the checkbox "Interpolate Scalars Before Mapping" in the
Properties tab before exporting to EPS. (It is an advanced property,
either search for its name or toggle the wheel next to the search box to
have it show up.)

Internally, the filter relies since 2005 on vtkMergePoints which merges
points with coinciding coordinates. There is no room for a tolerance
parameter in that class. Previously, vtkPointLocator was used which
allowed to specify a tolerance.

A few years back when I faced this challenge myself for the first time,
I wrote a small plugin subclassing vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid that uses
vtkPointLocator internally and allows to specify a tolerance parameter.
Let me know if you are interested.

Message-ID: <5550AB6C.8080507@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi All,

My question could be very basic but how to be sure that Paraview uses 
installed graphics card (in my case Nvidia K2000)? Do i need to install 
Paraview from source (using Nvidia drivers) to use the full capability 
of underlying hardware? I am asking because volume rendering seems 
little bit slow when i try to use binary Paraview installation after 
installing driver of the graphics card. I just want to be sure about it.

I cannot directly answer your question, but there has been some 
discussion about slow volume rendering previously. Search the archive 
for a thread called "Hardware suggestions for volume rendering".

A quick summary:
The performance depends on the type of dataset you have, i.e. structured 
grids (even up to 70M grid points) will render decently fast on a single 
Nvidia Quadro K2100M GPU, but unstructured grids are very slow already 
for much smaller grids.

You can test this by using the wavelet source, which gives you a 
arability sized structured dataset.

Message-ID: <CACCxOYHLBXM7fDLAgskcTBpG=Z9GsPF+LEpE6ot6ghKF9hxL8g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaViewers,

I have recently used the instructions from the ParaView Wiki to download
ParaView (presumably its most recent version, 4.3.1) and build it with
OSMesa. However, my computer also has a non-OSMesa-enabled copy of ParaView
4.0.1 installed. Whenever I run the "ParaView" command, the 4.0.1 version
opens. How do I tell my computer that I want to open the OSMesa-enabled
version? Will I need to uninstall 4.0.1 first?

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 if that makes any difference.

Cheers,
CS

Hi Armin,

Actually, the data size is 541x385x40 (x,y,z; float) ~8.3M grid points 
and i am using regular grid not unstructured. I will give a chance to 
wavelet source as you suggest to get feeling about the performance but i 
am still looking for an answer for my initial question. Is out of box 
ParaView binary could use full capability of hardware or not?

Thanks again,

Are they installed in different folders? If yes, you could set PATH 
environment variable to point the directory that has paraview command. 
If you looking for a system wide solution then you could create small 
shell script under /etc/profile.d (for CentOS but it must be similar in 
Ubuntu) to automatically set PATH environment variable.

ParaVIew binaries don't ship with any OpenGL implementation. It uses
whatever OpenGL drivers setup on the machine it's being run. So long
as your environment is setup properly, ParaView will indeed use the
hardware available. However, not all rendering techniques in ParaView
will use the graphics card  -- as Armin alluded to. Your dataset seems
like small enough that volume rendering should be pretty
instantaneous. What is the "Volume Rendering Mode" on the Properties
panel set to? It should be "Smart" by default -- that will ensure that
the graphics card is used, if possible.

Not sure if I understand perfectly - your input to Paraview is a series of 2d slices (i.e., images)?  Could you just take one slice, and replicate it a few thousand times?  I.e., could you just give Kitware that one slice, and then instruct them to replicate it a few thousand times?

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for responding so quickly. I have no problems sharing the dataset and the script...it is quite large though - probably 10-15 G compressed. I will see what I can do to get a reduced data-set.

Alternatively, how can I set up a debug run so that a trace can be sent to you?

Meanwhile, I think that Version 4.0.0-RC2 doesn't have this issue as I managed to do the complete animation - I'll confirm again with a few more tests but it came out ok. I've copied Martin Larcher on this since he mentions the same problem in an earlier post to the mailing list and this may be of use to him.

Cheers,

Sandeep.

Dear all,
I have the same problem since some weeks. When I try to create a longer animation the rendering stops after about 100 steps and the same view is shown by changing the time (using vtu files). Sandeep's error description sounds very similar. I'm using only standard filters, perhaps Contour is quite expensive. And perhaps my models are slightly bigger (about 1.6 million cells and a similar number of points).
Some further remarks: I get the problem when I do the playback or even when I create an animation. I do not get the problem when I'm using no filters (except the read filter). If I remove after the occurrence of the error the Contour filter, there seems to be a layer over the output. 
During turning the model I can see it, when I release the mouse it disappears...
Any idea?
I'm using 4.3.1 but I have the same with 4.2 and 4.1 Martin

If you have a example script+dataset that you can share (off the list, if needed) to reproduce this issue, that'd make things easier to debug.

Dear ParaViewers,

I am currently attempting to build ParaView from source so that I can use
OSMesa with it. However, after I run the standard process (ccmake -> make
-> make install), a newly created application called *paraview* is nowhere
to be found. *pvserver*, *pvdataserver*, *paraview-config*, *pvpython* are
all created, but no *paraview*. I am running Ubuntu 14.04. Might anyone
have an explanation for this?

Cheers,

Do you have PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI on in the cmake config?
If not the ParaView application itself would not be built.
You will need Qt installed to enable it, but it should be on by default.

Thank you for the advice, Srikanth. I'll try to start four X servers. And
thank you Burlen for the scripts. I think my X11 configuration file will
need to be changed.

Subject: [Paraview] Full screen screenshots
Message-ID: <CAPxeKp-tfbLYW+MQZ_NSzjt1K_jK+cGkGTo2MeGrDfzHjjFZMw@mail.gmail.com>

I've been having an issue with generating full screen screenshots, from
which I would like to generate a movie.

I am running python on my local machine with a full desktop environment and
connecting to a remote server which does the rendering and processing. I
load a state file and generate the view as follows:

pv.LoadState('dgsolution.pvsm');

view = pv.GetRenderView();

view.ViewSize = [1920,1080];

pv.SetActiveView(view)

view.StillRender()

I need to change the size to 1920x1080 since the state file used a
different aspect ratio and size. The issue is that I have side menus on my
desktop, and setting the view size to 1920x1080 pushes the render view
outside of my display range.

Is there a way around this? Rendering in full screen mode should solve the
problem, but I don't know how to activate full screen from pvpython. Is
there a way to do this?

Thank you,
John

John,

This doesn't actually answer your question, but can you set the size to something smaller that fits easily on your desktop and then use the magnification parameter of SaveScreenshot to create the larger screenshot that you actually want? The magnification will actually show the data at full resolution by rendering the image in pieces and stitching the results together.

A user of mine would like to see points or glyphs of the atoms in a cube file.  However,
ParaView does not seem to be able to recognize them as data points that can do that.

I can reproduce this in the VTKData example file: m4_TotalDensity.cube.  This would be for the
"Output" portion of the pipeline.  The data ranges are uninteresting, but they should work.

The atoms do show up as Point Data.  I can even show them in a table, and if I select them, the
selected magenta points do show up in the 3D RenderView.  But, I cannot display them as rendered
(and therefore cannot colormap) points.

I CAN Glyph the atoms in m4_TotalDensity.cube.  For my user's data, the Glyph filter outputs
zero information.  Although the data looks reasonably similar.

Is this a bug, or am I missing a filter for this sort of data?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi folks,

We invite you to participate in the 2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization
Contest. This year's contest targets data from cosmology research that
studies the formation of structure in the Universe. Participants are
challenged to create a comprehensive set of analysis and visualization
capabilities that enable domain experts to gain deeper insight into the
formation of various structures in the Universe and better understanding of
observations from next generation telescopes. Besides a number of
interesting incentives, the contest winners will be presenting their work
at IEEE VIS 2015 and they will get a chance to publish their results as a
full, peer-reviewed IEEE CG&A article. Find out more at

Hi,

I checked "Volume Rendering Mode" but i could not see it in my case. It 
is exist in my local laptop (Mac OS) but it is not in ParaView installed 
under Debian 8.0. I think that after selecting representation type to 
Volume, it must show up in the Properties menu. Right?

If I want to run ParaView in client-server mode with OSMesa, which instance
of ParaView needs to be built from source with OSMesa enabled -- the one on
the client, the one on the server, or both?

Hi CS,

Only the one on the server.

Dear ParaViewers,

If I want to run ParaView in client-server mode with OSMesa, which instance of ParaView needs to be built from source with OSMesa enabled -- the one on the client, the one on the server, or both?

Cheers,

Just the server side.

The client will need to show things on screen in any case.

When the server is doing the rendering, the client doesn't care if the
server made the images with an on- or offscreen GL.

Sean,

You would indeed need to use the "Glyph" filter to glyph the "Output".
Try changing the "Glyph Mode" for the Glyph filter on the Properties
panel to "All Points". Does that help?

Can you post the output of the following commands:
1) paraview --version
2) glxinfo | grep OpenGL

Concerning different dataset types and volume rendering:
Are you sure that your dataset is recognized by ParaView as a structured 
dataset? For instance, some simulation software packages produce always 
unstructured dataset (e.g. OpenFOAM), even if you setup a completely 
uniform grid.
Also some filter in ParaView produce unstructured grids (e.g. threshold 
filter) no matter what the input type is.

The grid type is easy to check from the Information panel in ParaView.

The Glyph filter is the appropriate way to see points that have no cells attached to them (as in the case of the cube data). This might be a problem with the new uniform spatial distribution feature of the glyph filter. What happens if you change the "Glyph Mode" option of the filter from "Uniform Spatial Distribution" to "All Points"?

A user of mine would like to see points or glyphs of the atoms in a cube file.  However,
ParaView does not seem to be able to recognize them as data points that can do that.

I can reproduce this in the VTKData example file: m4_TotalDensity.cube.  This would be for the
"Output" portion of the pipeline.  The data ranges are uninteresting, but they should work.

The atoms do show up as Point Data.  I can even show them in a table, and if I select them, the
selected magenta points do show up in the 3D RenderView.  But, I cannot display them as rendered
(and therefore cannot colormap) points.

I CAN Glyph the atoms in m4_TotalDensity.cube.  For my user's data, the Glyph filter outputs
zero information.  Although the data looks reasonably similar.

Is this a bug, or am I missing a filter for this sort of data?

Thanks,
Sean

Okay. That makes sense because i have a Threshold filter in my
visualisation pipeline. If i use wavelet source then i could see the
"Volume Rendering Mode" and it is set as "Smart". So, using Threshold
filter might also reduce the performance of the volume rendering. Right?
Anyway, thanks for your suggestions and help.

Hello everybody,

I've a problem using the "Find Data" function in Paraview. When I
select a data that has in his name a parenthesis I get the following
error:

Example for the quantity: Absolute_Pressure_[mbar]
______________________________________________________________________________
Error: Failed to evaluate Expression '(Absolute_Pressure_[mbar] >
5000) & (Absolute_Pressure_[mbar] < 5005)'. The following exception
stack should provide additional developer specific information. This
typically implies a malformed expression. Verify that the expression
is valid.


Traceback (most recent call last):

As you can see in the last line of the error message, Paraview searchs
for a quantity name that is different from the correct one, because it
is truncated: "Absolute_Pressure_" without "[mbar]"

Any tips?

Yes, the performance is severely impaired when you apply the threshold 
filer to a structured dataset, since it produces an unstructured dataset.
To my understand you don't get a true volume rendering for unstructured 
dataset, but maybe somebody who knows more about the details can comment 
on this.

However, since you have already a structured dataset to begin with, you 
should be able to get a decent performance. As I said, I can render a 
64M structured dataset (i.e. a 400x400x400 wavelet source) instantly on 
my laptop. So your 8M dataset should be no problem, just don't use the 
threshold filter.

If you want to work only on a subset of your dataset, you can use the 
"Extract Subset" filter, which outputs a structured dataset again.
Otherwise you can achieve similar effects as with the threshold filter 
by adjusting the transfer function/color scale for the volume rendering.

Subject: [Paraview] Troubles with exporting selection labels from current
	ParaView render view
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQtu_Th_8hsxJwQVMjzT=es1jARarhzj8A56qUkG_7bRrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

It has been a long time ParaView sources worked excellent with my
patches and the plugin (3D exporter). However, I'm having troubles
with the latest version (v4.3.1) to export labels which are shown over
selected points (both per point and per cell). This was my approach
which worked with v4.0.1 (100% sure) and v4.2 (I think, but, I'm not
definitely sure):

1. I traverse all visible pipeline sources and for all their
representations in currently active view do next,
2. For every representation, I check if it is DataLabelRepresentation
and if it is I save PointLabelVisibility, PointFieldDataArrayName, etc
properties ..
3. From other representations, I get vtkLODActor for which I bind my
labels properties,
4. In exporting code, I get current view, traverse its actors and
export them, however, there is one problem now. Let me give an
example:

    - If I have Sphere on which I applied Elevation filter and
selected several points with turned on labels (with e.g. Elevation
selected as array),

    - Strange 1: I don't have anymore instance in
DataLabelRepresentation for Elevation pipeline source (btw, during
this traversing I get only one actor),
    - Strange 2: When I traverse vtkRenderer's actors, I get 2 actors
(sphere mesh and actor with selected points), but, I'm unable to
connect selection label properties (which are tied with Elevation
pipeline source actor - sphere mesh) and mesh with selected points /
cells.

Q1: How to identify actor from vtkRenderer which contains selection
points / cells and get selection properties from this actor or

Q2: How to identify actor from pqPipeline source on which are selected
points and how from appropriate representations to get actor which
contains selected points / cells?

Thanks everyone for possible answers!

Nenad.

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph filter instead of legacy glyph filter
Message-ID: <BN3PR0201MB099472BBE853AF558D1B015BB5D90@BN3PR0201MB0994.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

I am currently visualizing MFIX unstructured grid data in Paraview.

I am trying to visualize the vector fields. After applying the "CellDataToPointData" I then apply the "Glyph" filter. This results in vector fields inside the reactor the way I want to visualize, but it also includes constant vectors perpendicular to the y axis and flow along the tube (reactor) wall.

Using the "LegacyGlyph" instead of the "Glyph" filter results in the correct visualization but the vectors change size throughout the visualization.

Is there a way that I can use the newer "Glyph" filter in my visualization and remove the constant vectors perpendicular to the y-axis?

Looking forward to a reply,

Emilio Ramirez

You can use the "Vectors" drop-down box to choose which vectors to use
for orienting the glyph. You can use "Scale Mode" to control how to
scale the glyph.

Checkout Chapter 5, Section 5.7.8 for the ParaView Guide [1] for more details:

Ah, good catch! Mind reporting a bug. For now, you can use the
Calculator filter to rename the array to not include the "[", "]".

the visualization of this image within ParaView. Is there a way, or a file

Hi David

After remove executive.SetExtentTranslator(outInfo, vtk.vtkExtentTranslator()), not the points are rendered.
Why there is no ?volume? option available for Representation?

I want to render as volume

Thanks,
James

I believe in this case the intent was to get the edge'th edge out of the
face'th face out of the cell'th cell.

So in your example we get four edges out.

cell 0's 0'th face's 0'th edge,
cell 0's 1'st face's 1'st edge,
cell 1's 2'nd face's 0'th edge,
and
cell 1's 3'rd face's 2'nd edge.
The ordering in each case is defined by VTK.

However, in the code (specifically vtkXdmfHeavyData.cxx:1507) it looks like
it does exactly as you say.
This appears to be a bug.

In the Xdmf3 version  we do it properly (see vtkXdmf3DataSet.cxx:2205).

Subject: [Paraview] Data formats and XDMF
Message-ID: <CAGCathx_0jhyVYLPbKoTm51ynaqxYKfv2GNVuLFYXm==N6qp2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to write the output of a CFD code, attributes are cell centered
and my mesh looks like the picture attached: orthogonal edges, cells
are rectangular, but unstructured (leafs of a tree, not necessarily
octree).

I know how to work with HDF5, thus I prefer to write it in XDMF +
HDF5, but I could settle with any format that provides compression,
and I am able to write the tree once, and reuse it with different
attribute fields per time step (I know how to do it both from XDMF and
directly from HDF5).

So, is XDMF recommended, or should I use something else?

Also, in the picture, the bigger cell, can it be written as a
hexahedron, ignoring that one face actually interfaces with 4 other
cells, or should I describe it as a 9 face polyhedron, where there are
4 coplanar faces? The former is much easier, is there any difference
from visualization standpoint? Is it more "correct" to use a 9 face
polyhedron?

I have an idea on how to make a XDMF using only hexahedron, but not a
clue with polyhedra of variable number of faces. Could you please
assemble a sample XDMF depicting that mesh for me to use as base?

I guess that leads to the following questions:

1) When will Xdmf3 be used by ParaView?

2) Does 2D work properly?

3) What about Attributes which are not in a "Set". The XDMF pages say 
this:-

"A Grid centered Attribute might be something like "Material Type" where 
the value is constant everywhere in the grid. Edge and Face centered 
values are defined, but do not map well to many visualization systems."

But how do you define Edge and Face centered values for the whole mesh, 
anyway?

4) Finally, is there any real need (in the case below) to go via the 
Faces? Maybe, before the standard gets more widespread, this could be 
eliminated,
    and just go direct from Cell->Edge... OK, this is just a 
suggestion...

I think if you are using cell-centered data, it will be OK to use 
hexahedra.
If you had vertex-centered data, then the approach you describe above
might make sense, as the values could be interpolated from the hanging 
node.

You may notice some artefacts in the rendering, though, due to "internal 
surfaces"
between the non-conforming cells. But only if you turn 'opacity' on, for 
example.

Here is a simple (XML) example to see what I mean (e.g. try in paraview 
with opacity=0.5)

XDMF/HDF5 works really well (especially in parallel).

How can I use programmable data source(vtkImageData) to render a volume? There is no Volume item in Representation drop box.

Thanks,

Can someone report this bug (below) to the development team on my 
behalf? Thanks.

Description of the bug: While linking cameras of two views, and you 
check/uncheck "Camera Parallel Projection", you will see the other view 
doesn't change accordingly. By "linking cameras", it should mean 100% 
identical viewing behavior.

Hello,

  I have an unstructured grid that oddly produces a negative volume - I've looked for degenerate cells, etc.  But cannot find anything obvious.

  The file is attached, it's a very small grid of approx.. 1500 cells, I've removed the data arrays - they integrated negative too - but this did not resolve the issue with the volume being < 0.

   I am look at vtkIntegrateAttributes now and will post if I find anything.

  Happy bug hunting,

Mark

Hi Mark,

It looks like some of your cells are inverted in their canonical ordering.
You can use the Mesh Quality filter to see the tets that have negative
volumes.

Probably the easiest way to fix the cells canonical ordering would be using
Programmable Filter.

Regards,
Andy

Andy,

  Thanks for the quick reply ? that unstructured grid was output from vtkClipDataSet.  I did not think to try the Mesh Quality filter ? I will try that.

  This is the first ugrid that I have seen this happen to, we are using clipdataset to slice a reservoir model ugrid using a geologic horizon.  Many of these jobs have been run with good results.

  If you would like I could send you the input data and VTK flow.

Thanks,

Mark

Hi Mark,

Did you check the input grid to see if any cells in there are inverted?

If you can share the data set and the workflow, I can take a look to see
where the problem occurred.

I am getting the following build error when building ParaView.  This is from master, on Linux, targeting a cluster (redsky).  Clean build, new pull of a git tree.  Any ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] Troubles with exporting selection labels from
 current ParaView render view
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQthqdKRWU3qFJgN55DwHnn6Qs_gz41Vj=9=mBjhAwapaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again,

I have one another problem with the latest PV sources (v4.3.1, I used
VS2008 x64 built with most of extra packages from super-build enabled)
and creating labels. Again everything worked fine on v4.0 (and I think
v4.2), but now, not anymore .. Here is what I tried:

1. I created a source plugin which outputs on output port 0 set of
points and on output port 1 set of lines.
2. I registered handlers to catch signals sourceAdded(),
sourceCreated(), representationAdded(), representationRemoved() etc,
3. In handler for RepresentationAdded, when representation for output
port 0 (set of points) is created, I previously created
DataLabelRepresentation and initialized, but now it just reports data
representation is reported and does nothing..
4. Now, I tried to set some parameters of representation subproxy by:

// set representation's properties
pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(mptrPointsRepresentation->getProxy()->GetProperty("SelectionVisibility"),
true);
pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(mptrPointsRepresentation->getProxy()->GetProperty("SelectionPointLabelVisibility"),
true);
pqSMAdaptor::setMultipleElementProperty(mptrPointsRepresentation->getProxy()->GetProperty("SelectionPointLabelColor"),
rPointLabelColor);
pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(mptPointsRepresentation->getProxy()->GetProperty("SelectionPointLabelFontSize"),
iPointLabelSize);
pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(mptrPointsRepresentation->getProxy()->GetProperty("SelectionPointLabelFormat"),
strPointLabelFormat);
pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(mptrPointsRepresentation->getProxy()->GetProperty("SelectionPointLabelJustification"),
iPointLabelJustification);

// update underlying VTK objects
mptrPointsRepresentation->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();

But, it still doesn't work.

Btw, when I create sphere, apply elevation and select some points
(with started tracing), I don't see any of these parameters turned ON.
I don't see anything about selected points .. Also, I noticed
selections are not preserved in state files.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Nenad.

Subject: [Paraview] Switching Between Readers
Message-ID: <CAFvyM3Td9fn1=ak2if9yMCtartoLVoCyD6hWEJ5LmOB1FdoHCw@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if there was a way to instantiate a superclass that, let's
say, can switch between vtkPolyDataAlgorithm and vtkImageAlgorithm.

I have a reader that (as of now) converts the data within a protobuf file
to image data.

But currently, I have multiple protobuf files with different information.
However, the file extension is still .pbuf, and it seems that the reader
xml parsers the files based off this input.

So would it be easier to change the filename? Or is there a way to switch
between the two algorithm classes?

Thanks for your time!

	even when versions are the same
Message-ID: <CACCxOYGs+05nms9ypwfBitOOa8hY6majGXCBE4FZgTXPMHPfXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaViewers,

I am attempting to set up a client/server connection between a default
installation of ParaView 4.3.1 on the client side and an OSMesa build --
presumably also 4.3.1; built according to the wiki's instructions at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D -- on the server
side. Both computers have graphics hardware; using an ssh tunnel is not
acceptable for our purposes due to the requirement to disable all security
using *xhost+*. The computers also have default installations of 4.0.1.
Both are running VTK 5.8.

Despite the ParaView and VTK versions on both ends being identical, I
receive "Client/server handshake failed" and "Client/server version hash
mismatch" errors every time I attempt to connect. What could be the cause
of this issue?

CS?

Hi,

I want to build ParaViewWeb on windows (64-but), I have install win32api
for python in my machine. I am using cmake-gui, and every time I click
ParaView_Enable_Python" to ON, and ParaView_Enable_Web to ON, cmake will
turn ParaView_Enable_Web to off. Is there a way to make it on ?

I found this in the cmake text:
# ParaViewWeb on Windows needs win32api which is not provided by default
# For now the default behavior would be to disable it on Windows build

Can I know how to enable ParaViewWeb for windows build ?

Thanks for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] Connecting to Catalyst-Enabled Simulation Running on
	Remote Cluster
Message-ID: <5559DF87.6080004@ovgu.de>

Hi all,

in an effort to enable live visualization of our simulation code, I have
written a Catalyst adaptor for it. The live visualization is working
great when the ParaView client runs on the same machine as the
simulation, even when the simulation runs in parallel using mpi.

Now I want to do live visualization of a simulation running on a remote
cluster. I am able to get this to work for the simulation running on the
login node of the cluster:

1. Tunnel an ssh connection of port 11111 to the cluster:
    ssh -L 11111:localhost:11111 server
2. In the shell that opens, start a paraview server (in the background
with '&')
3. Run the simulation with mpirun (simulation runs only on login node)
4. Start my local ParaView client and connect to localhost:11111 to
connect to the remote pvserver through the ssh tunnel
5. In the client, connect to Catalyst (port 22222)
6. A provider for the simulation is created and the live visualization works

Now I want to do the same for simulations started on the remote cluster
via the batch job system. In this scenario, the parallel processes of
the simulation will run on different (randomly chosen) nodes on the
cluster. How do I go about getting a connection from my local client to
the Catalyst instances running on those nodes?

I imagine I will need to set up ssh tunnels from the nodes to the login
node where the pvserver is running. I've tried adding a ssh tunnel line
to the job script that is executed when the batch job starts. I've tried
forwarding and reverse-forwarding port 22222 (ssh -L and ssh -R) to no
avail. The best I get is "ERROR: In
/.../ParaView_git/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx, line 206
vtkServerSocket (0x18e0930): Socket error in call to bind. Address
already in use."

My knowledge in networking and ssh is limited, so any pointers to how I
would go about this are greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Timo

Subject: [Paraview] Rescale to data range on a field's component in python
	in Paraview 4.3.1
Message-ID: <CAKtnqfmN0LNz52bCn+4+0MFTdSytwnaznawjfJbcnt4c=ZZctg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In 4.2.0, the following code was enough to display a field's component
instead of its magnitude and set the right scalar bar:

lookup_table = GetColorTransferFunction('SIGM')

#change array component used for coloring
id_comp = 2
lookup_table.VectorComponent = id_comp
lookup_table.VectorMode = 'Component'


In 4.3.1, we have to explicitly get the min and max of the field and
change the scalar bar name:

# Update the scalar bar range
source_array = stress.PointData.GetArray("SIGM")
comp_name = source_array.GetComponentName(id_comp)
mini, maxi = source_array.GetComponentRange(id_comp)
lookup_table.RGBPoints = [mini, r, g, b, maxi, r2, g2, b2]

# Update the scalar bar name
ScalarBar1 = GetScalarBar(lookup_table)
SetProperties(ScalarBar1, ComponentTitle=comp_name)

Is this a bug, or am I missing something?

In attachment, a script to load in Paraview 4.2.0 and 4.3.1. The
sample file can be downloaded here: http://bourcier.eu/stress.vtu

Thanks.

I don't follow. DataLableRepresentation is indeed created for every
representation shown in the render view.

Remember that label actors are added to the 2D / non-composited
renderer, not the same as the 3D renderer. Which renderer are you
looking at?

Neither of these are really supported. Look at
vtkSelectionRepresentation. If you can think of ways of "tagging" the
actors added by the representations used internally by this class, I
am all ears.

This is in changes that I made recently to atomic ints but I have not seen
this problem. Could you tell me which compiler version you are using? Could
you share the CMakeCache.txt file from the build directory?

Thanks

Replace the following CMake lines

# ParaViewWeb on Windows needs win32api which is not provided by default
# For now the default behavior would be to disable it on Windows build
if (WIN32)
  set(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
else()
  cmake_dependent_option(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB "Enable/Disable web support" ON
    "PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON" OFF)
endif()

with the following =====

# ParaViewWeb on Windows needs win32api which is not provided by default
# For now the default behavior would be to disable it on Windows build
if (WIN32)
  # set(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
else()
  cmake_dependent_option(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB "Enable/Disable web support" ON
    "PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON" OFF)
endif()

Then you should be good to go.

Message-ID: <CAAsQ6MLPgdu5Mo=GcWUzQu35cvuyXx7VPsN1vb+MZHsOJMsZRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm very excited about paraview, and I think it might fit my needs
perfectly. However, I have two questions.

1) What is the simplest way to "rotate about the x axis" ? The data I have
is rather long : length x >> length y and z. So when I zoom in around the
extremes, rotation around the center is really unhelpful for inspection.

2) I would like to use Paraview as a 'front end' for an interactive program
I am planning to write. Is there a way to "capture mouse events" over the
image so that I can turn those into changes in the presentation of the data?

Thanks,
Chris

Can someone report this bug (below) to the development team on my behalf? Thanks.

Description of the bug: While linking cameras of two views, and you check/uncheck "Camera Parallel Projection", you will see the other view doesn't change accordingly. By "linking cameras", it should mean 100% identical viewing behavior.

Best,
Weiguang

Utkarsh,

Thank you very much for your response.

Here is what I'm trying to do:

1. I create source plugin by creating appropriate .xml, CMakeLists.txt
and derived class from vtkPolyDataAlgorithm,
2. This new algorithm has 2 output ports (first port is for points
(over which I would like to see floating labels) and second for
lines),
3. In RequestData() routine I generate poly-data for both ports and
call EventHandlers::SetDataLabelParameters(...) (I made instance of it
in constructor of derived class) with labels' parameters,
4. After creating source by pushing Apply, code from EventHandlers is
executed. Lines and Points are displayed fine, but, there are no
labels. Only 2 representations are created (I think both
GeometryRepresentation) and it stops.
5. When I tried to move code from DataRepresentationCreated() to
execute after mptrLabelsPointsRepresentation is initialized in
RepresentationAdded(), it reported "Missing required attribute.".

1-4 worked fine with earlier versions, but, now, labels are not
created. Even DataRepresentationCreated() is not called.

Thanks for any help!

Nenad.

Thanks for the info. I make the change (comment out that line) and rebuild.
This time i can see WebApplication, vtkWebApps, vtkWebCore... and etc in
the Solution Explorer in VS 2013. And when I build all solutions,
everything compile properly except 2 errors:

Error    7064    error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
"__declspec(dllimport) public: static class vtkAVIWriter * __cdecl

Do I need vtkPVAnimation ? I only interested in ParaViewWeb, how can I turn
that off from cmake (if ParaViewWeb do not require vtkPVAnimation).

Thanks for your help.

Hi Sebastien,

Sorry, please ignore the previous error. I finally found the correct
combination in cmake and successfully build ParaViewWeb without error.

However, when I launch ParaViewWeb with the following command:

pvpython.exe
..\lib\paraview-4.3\site-packages\paraview\web\pv_web_visualizer.py
--content ..\share\www --port 8088 --data-dir \data

The following error occur.

Traceback (most recent call last):

    import win32api

Can I know how to point it to win32api I installed ? The file for
win32api.pyd is in

Thanks for your help.

Try to add that path to the following environment variable:

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\win32
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\win32

If that doesn't work, you will have to search on the net on how to make
Twisted works on Windows.

Good luck,

Seb

Kevin,

Can your reader tell if it can read the file irrespective of its
extension? If so, just implement a "int CanReadFile (const char
*fname)" method on the the reader classes that will test a file. Now
you can have two reader supporting the same extension and ParaView
will create the correct reader automatically. There can be multiple
reader supporting the same extensions even without this CanReaderFile
too. In that case, ParaView will automatically popup a reader
selection dialog.

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf: orders of Origin DXDYDZ arrays in Origin_DXDYDZ
Message-ID: <CAHQkNjS_hAQRL21KuU7autFTgM2wSvyhHjBTw0jOeg5ayCpOJw@mail.gmail.com>

In the first place, I do not understand the difference between 3DRectMesh
and 3DCoRectMesh.

I picked the following coordinate for testing:

Nz,Ny,Nx = [80, 90, 100]
z0,y0,x0 = [-3.,-2.,-1.]
lz,ly,lx = [Nz*3,Ny*2,Nx]
dz,dy,dx = [lz/(Nz-1), ly/(Ny-1), lx/(Nx-1)]

I found I have to use the following lines in the xdmf to get the correct
grid to be shown in Paraview for 3DRectMesh and 3DCoRectMesh, respectively:

<!--For 3DRectMesh -->
      <Topology TopologyType="3DRectMesh" Dimensions=" 80 90 100"/>
      <Geometry GeometryType="Origin_DXDYDZ">
        <DataItem Name="Origin" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3"
Format="XML"> -1 -2 -3</DataItem>
        <DataItem Name="DxDyDz" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3"
Format="XML"> 1 2 3</DataItem>
      </Geometry>

<!--For 3DCoRectMesh -->
      <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions=" 80 90 100"/>
      <Geometry GeometryType="Origin_DXDYDZ">
        <DataItem Name="Origin" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3"
Format="XML"> -3 -2 -1</DataItem>
        <DataItem Name="DxDyDz" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3"
Format="XML"> 3 2 1</DataItem>
      </Geometry>

Note that, the Dimensions for Topology in both cases are in zyx order,
while the Origin/DxDyDz arrays have different orders in the two cases:

3DRectMesh requires Origin=[x0,y0,z0], DX=[dx,dy,dz], i.e., xyz order
3DCoRectMesh requires Origin=[z0,y0,x0], DX=[dz,dy,dx], i.e., zyx order.

Am I writing the correct xdmf codes? How would you specify these data?
Thanks.

Hi Timo,

There's a couple of steps that need to be added when connecting to a
Catalyst-enabled simulation that's been run through a batch job on a
cluster. This "should" be the same as just running pvserver through a batch
job and connecting to that. The basics are that there's an
executable/script that runs on the login node that the batch job connects
to. Your GUI connects to the login node and has the ports forwarded
properly through the executable/script to your pvserver. Now if your
pvserver is running on the login node then it will have to use the above
connection mechanism to connect to your Catalyst-enabled simulation. There
may be some emails or something on the wiki that has information on the
connection executable/script but I haven't tried any of that in several
years so I'm not sure where it would be. Maybe someone else will chime in
that's done this more recently than me.

Good luck and let us know how it goes.

Andy

Wireframes in ParaView are colored the same way as most of the other representations (like surface, points, or volume). In all cases in order to color by something other than a solid color, you need a field defined over the mesh.

It sounds you want to color based on the physical location. You can create a field like that easily with the Calculator filter. Just make the expression of the Calculator "coords" (which is a special vector representing the point coordinates). Here is a screen shot of creating a coloring similar to your example of the disk_out_ref dataset using just the ParaView GUI.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Color wireframe by color gradient

Dear all,

I wondered if it is possible to color a wireframe with a a color gradient (or random colors)
instead of a solid color. I have a 3D mesh exported from GMSH, with a lot of interior points/edges.
I use a shrink filter in Paraview to thow the interior edges, but since the are all colored homogenously
it is impossible to distinguish any features.
Here's a Screenshot:
http://flatpolar.org/paraview_mesh3_maxsize5.png

I would like to have the mesh shown at least a little bit more like in GMSH:
http://flatpolar.org/gmsh_mesh3_maxsize5.png

In best case, the coloring of the edges would be depending on the X-,Y-,and Z-location.
I found this screenshot featuring different edge colors, but the model is created from
Python and visualized in an OpenGL window instead of Paraview.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/thumb/d/d7/ContourFilterPython3.png/600px-ContourFilterPython3.png
The idea seems to be to set the 'ColorAttributeType' to 'POINT_DATA', but this doesn't help me much.

Could anyone hint me to a solution of how to achieve a multi-colored wireframe in Paraview?

Thanks in advance,
Michael

Hi Timo,

Have you ever tried to test Catalyst examples in your case.

https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode

I am also trying to run Catalyst examples but i could not. In my case, i
am able to install Paraview (4.3.1) from source under Mac OS 10.10 and the
Catalys examples but when i try to run the examples i am getting error
like,

ERROR: In
/Users/turuncu/Qsync/progs/paraview-4.3.1/src/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx,
line 812
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x7f86a52658e0): Could not receive tag. 1

or

ERROR: In
/Users/turuncu/Qsync/progs/paraview-4.3.1/src/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx,
line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x7fcefc939fe0): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.

So, if you don't mind could you share the details of your work environment
(OS, Paraview version, etc.) and the steps to run the in-situ example. So,
that could also help me to find the source of the problem.

Regards,

--ufuk

Dear all the Paraview users?

I am the new student of Paraview and easily lost in some basic details of its application, one of them is eps outputting. I have tried it many times but failed all the while. The color maps may transform automatically into grayscale ones when I use

Export Scene > choosing eps format > canceling Rasterize 3D geometry

There are two examples for describing what I just lost in in E-mail attachments. I want to ask either something error in my operation or something I miss in the basic concepts of Paraview?s usage for my purpose. Seeking your help!

Message-ID: <CAAsQ6M+5Kk2qHabG2RhTwTyueYhuQsAFubKBGW_ykDcLZR1skw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two 3D image that I would like to compare to see  if they are "the
same." I thought it would be illustrative to overlay the two volumes in
different colors with some opacity.

This presents some difficulty. In my mind I would be able to have 2 volumes
overlayed, full control of the color map of each volume, and be able to
control rotation and translation of each volume individually.

If that's not possible directly in the GUI, maybe it's possible through the
python console?

Best,
Chris

Subject: [Paraview] Installing ParaView 4.0.1 on Nodes For Rendering Frames
 -Slow Rendering w/ Python
Message-ID: <CAM98qv4hE0sSVRtcZbPChrZnSQy=1WGoYT-NuOuRn4rm25oMjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using ParaView 4.0.1 since I developed a python script for
interpretation on this version. I am able to run ParaView fine on my local
Ubuntu Desktop. I have setup an EC2 AWS instance both a GPU and a CPU
instance both running Ubuntu but they both are giving me the same problem
of very very slow rendering for each time step with the offscreen rendering
option turned on. I also run into this problem on a Unix supercomputer I am
trying to run my code on. On my local machine it takes less than a second
for each time step I am rendering to be outputted with the same settings
and I am not spinning anything  up like pvserver - on the node instances I
have, it is taking well around a minute or probably more for each frame.

I have read through a lot of similar issues and the documentation for X
connections but I am not having any luck. The default DISPLAY is set to the
localhost:10.0 and I have tried changing that to the localhost:0.0 but it
gives me the bad -X connection error. From there, I followed previous
mailing list instructions and tried spinning up the pvserver (I don't know
why since I am not trying to serve anything just render frames) but I get
an error with the shared libraries that they're too short. I am using the
default downloadable version of 4.0.1 since I want to try and keep this as
simple as possible but I don't know if these have the mpi turned on by
default. Has anybody ran into this Bad X Connection issue and found an easy
way around it besides messing with the OSMesa and recompiling? I'd really
appreciate any pointers :)

Thanks,
Noah

Hi Andy,

I have succeeded in getting it to work by starting a pvserver process on
every node alongside with the simulation instead of just one pvserver on
the login node. I then have a ssh tunnel from the worker nodes to the
login node, and from the login node to my local computer. This appears
to be rather resource-intensive though, and I wonder if there is a more
efficient way to do it. Is such a great number of pvservers really
needed? If somebody has any additional information, that would be very
helpful. Searching the internet for this question hasn't brought up much
helpful information yet.

Regards,

Timo

Hi,

I have indeed run into the problem with "Could not receive tag. 1". In
my case I had to make sure that the client and server versions were
exactly the same. When connecting, the vtkSocketCommunicators on client
and server exchange a version hash that must match. This hash is
generated while building ParaView. The file that is generated can be
found in your build directory under
VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h. Check that your client
and server have the same hash value in this file.

I am assuming that you have correctly set up an ssh tunnel between
client and server to enable the connection (ssh -L 11111:localhost:11111
user at server). The steps I take to run a in-situ case on a single remote
workstation are listed in my previous mail.

BTW I am using the "trunk" version of ParaView from the git repository,
which is close to version 4.3.1, and I'm running Linux on both client
and server (different distributions).

Regards,

Timo

I encountered the same issue and you can find from the ParaView and XDMF
mailinglist-archives some explanations concerning this topic (search for
"Odd behavior of XDMF files with 3DCORECTMesh").


Concerning the different structured grid types:
3DCoRectMesh (aka vtkImageData):
Axis are perpendicular and spacing is constant (i.e. you only have to
set the mesh dimensions (nx, ny, nz), mesh origin (x0, y0, z0) and cell
dimensions (dx, dy, dz))

3DRectMesh (aka vtkRectilinearGrid):
Axis are perpendicular (i.e. you have to specify the nodes coordinates
along the three axes)

3DSMesh (aka vtkStructuredGrid):
Curvilinear (i.e. you have to specify the coordinates for all mesh nodes)

Hi Timo,

Thanks for your help. Actually, to keep it simple, i am using my laptop 
for both server and client. So, i think there is no need to open ssh 
tunnel in this case and also hash will not be an issue.

Steps:

1 - installed Paraview 4.3.1 source under Mac OS 10.10 by enabling 
Python + OpenMPI + Development files and ParaView works fine.
2 - i compiled ParaViewCatalystExampleCode without any problem
3 - i run server: mpirun -np 2 ./pvserver (on port 11111)
4 - i run ParaView and connect to server and Catalyst (on port 22222) 
using menus
5 - i go to CxxMultiPieceExample directory and i run the code: mpirun 
-np 2 ./CxxMultiPieceExample SampleScripts/feslicescript.py

in this case, i modified SampleScripts/feslicescript.py as 
coprocessor.EnableLiveVisualization(True) to enable live visualization. 
In this case, the code is running but i am getting

Invalid output port : pqPipelineSource::getOutputPort( 0 ). Available 
number of output ports: 0

error under ParaView and also server crashes with following error,

So, i am unable to run Catalyst tests for now. They produces output 
*.vtm files (using writers in the pipeline) if i disable live 
visualization. Please let me know, if you have any suggestion.

I haven't used the examples, so I'm afraid I can't help a lot there.

Message-ID: <54191183.25108.14d70758d70.Coremail.dingxyan@163.com>

Dear,
        I use the paraview of Version4.1, and the memory of my computer is 4G. When I load about 190 ply files at the same time, there will be errors about out of memory, but it runs normally when the number of the file is less than 190.


The error message as shown below:
ERROR: In C:\DBD\pvs-x32\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\Rendering\OpenGL\vtkOpenGLCoincidentTopologyResolutionPainter.cxx, line 176
vtkOpenGLCoincidentTopologyResolutionPainter (7A9A9938): failed after RenderShiftZBuffer 1 OpenGL errors detected

        Thanks for your help.
Yours truly,

It seems it is not. When I execute my code snipped (passed down) I get
only 2 sources (good), every source with 1 output port (good) and for
every output port only one GeometryRepresentation (bad). No traces of
DataLabelRepresentation. Btw, my test case is:

1. Create Sphere source with default parameters,
2. Apply Elevation filter on it and turn off its 3d widget line,
3. Select several points on Elevation1 sphere and execute code snippet.

Here is my code snippet:

------------------ START OF CODE SNIPPET ------------------

// pass through all pipeline sources and pass all its representations
for all output ports
for(i = 0; i < sources.size(); i++)
{
    // get pipeline source
    pqPipelineSource* source = sources.at(i);

    QMessageBox::about(NULL, "1", source->getSMName());

    // for every output port, traverse all its representations
    for(output_port = 0; output_port <
source->getNumberOfOutputPorts(); output_port++)
    {
         QMessageBox::about(NULL, "2", source->getSMName() +
QString("_port_") + QString::number(output_port));

         // traverse all representations for this
         for(j = 0; j < source->getRepresentations(output_port,
active_view).count(); j++)
         {
             // get representation
             // I got active_view with
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel()->getNumberOfItems<pqView*>
             pqDataRepresentation* current_representation =
source->getRepresentations(output_port, active_view)[j];

             QMessageBox::about(NULL, "3", current_representation->getSMName());
          }
    }
}

------------------ END OF CODE SNIPPET ------------------

Thank you very much for your response!


Nenad.

p.s. sorry for duplicated messages in your inbox:-).

Try turning of display lists. In ParaView4.1 it was setting named
"Immediate mode rendering" under the Settings dialog. You'll need to
enable the checkbox.

Nenad,

Okay I must be missing something very obvious here, but I am totally
lost here. EventHandlers.cpp confused more than it clarified things
for me :).

Just focusing on EventHandlers.cpp for now.

Are you saying EventHandlers::DataRepresentationCreated() isn't called
when a new "DataLabelRepresentation" is created at line #136?

Utkarsh,

I'm sorry for confusing:-(.

I want to say DataRepresentationCreated is never called! When I create
instance of my pipeline source with this source code, I get only 3
messages: "Source Created", and 2 times "Representation Added" after
pushing Apply button.

Nenad.

Are you using x forwarding when you connect to these machines? What is
localhost:10.0 display to? Try running some other X-based application
like gvim, or glxgears etc. and see where that window pops up. If it's
popping up on your laptop, you're using X forwarding. Every render on
the server will then be forwarding X calls to your laptop and that
would explain the slow down.

If there an X server running on the "remote site"? If so, check with
your sysadmin to get access to that X if possible. If not, you'll need
to recoming with OSMesa, I am afraid.

Ah ok. That's because pqObjectBuilder no longer creates the standard
representations for ParaView. A better signal to observe is
pqServerManagerModel::representationAdded(). You're already observer
sourceAdded from the ServerManagerModel. You'll need to qobject_cast<>
to pqDataRepresentation* in your slot, for same effect as before.

ParaView/VTK really doesn't support mixing two overlapping volumes.
Without going into the details, suffice it to say that the rendering
implementation will result in one of the volumes always on "top" of
the other. An alternative is to to render the volumes in 2 separate
views, side-by-side and then link the camera together to interact
simultaneously with the two views -- enabling similar comparison.
Another option is to extract isosurfaces (contours) from the two
volumes and then render those as surface with opacity < 1. Multiple
overlapping surfaces with translucency should work fine.

Thanks for your reply. I tried as you said, it doesn't work. I use a computer of 16G of memory, it can render out. Then I use 538 ply files, they are 11.9MB altogether, but when renderd, it will use 6G memory, either the display lists turned on or off. Why it is this?
Thanks for your help.

Good point. If I remember correctly, the 4.2 code worked only when
doing the same through Python shell in the UI, not from
pvpython/pvbatch, is that correct?

Here's what you can do for 4.3 case:

lookup_table = GetColorTransferFunction('SIGM')

#change array component used for coloring
id_comp = 2
lookup_table.VectorComponent = id_comp
lookup_table.VectorMode = 'Component'

repr = (the display-properties/repr object from which to get the data ranges).
repr.RescaleTransferFunctionToDataRange()
lookup_table.UpdateScalarBarsComponentTitle(repr.GetArrayInformationForColorArray())

Looking at this, it may make sense to add a new API to the repr to
SetScalarColoring with ability to change the component mode.

The reason for that (assuming ParaView 4.3.1) may be that you're
changing the "Output DataSet Type" after the first Apply (or you're
using "Auto Apply" in which case the Apply happens before you get
around to change the data type). See Section 13.2.4 from the ParaView
Guide [1]. I just verified that it correctly loads the attached file
with ability to volume render as demonstrated in the example.

Utkarsh,

Thank you very much for help, but, it still doesn't work. At Ln 118 it
fails and reports in Output Window 'Missing required attribute.' and
returns NULL.

Thanks for any help!

Nenad.

It's not exposed in the UI, but I believe you can use the Python shell
as follows:

> c = GetActiveCamera()
> c.SetEyeSeparation(...)

Step into "createDataRepresentation" in a debugger. You'll see one of
the arguments is NULL. I suspect its the view. The view isn't setup
yet. Try making the slot connection to a queued connection that way
ParaView gets the change to setup the representation object.

You have "Auto Apply" enabled. Hence the APply is happening before you
are able to change the output data type. Disable "Auto Apply" and then
create the Programmable Source. The data type must be set before the
first apply.

The client and server processes both print out a message with the

Utkarsh,

You are right, view is really NULL!! Ok, when I catch signals fired
I'll wait appropriate view is created and then they creating
representation.

You can use the D3 filter to redistribute the data once its opened in
ParaView that's running in parallel.

That's odd. Have you tried changing the "Volume Mapper" on the
Properties panel? Try switching between "Texture Only" and "GPU
based".

Sri,

The volume rendering code is being reimplemented. Let's wait to see
how that fares. If you don't mind experimenting, I can ping you once
ParaView git/master has the code ready for experimentation.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for your reply. I did try using Texture Only and got the same result. with paraview 4.3.1 I have done some debugging to see at which point the volume rendering fails. On a single machine on k40 with 12GB memory any size above 2048x1024x1024 float value it fails. When i distribute this across two nodes with k40, i can see the data is loaded into the graphic memory but there is no display output.

Thanks
Sri

Subject: [Paraview] deforming sphere-like grid to object
Message-ID: <CAAsQ6MLDq2pFytzFqTBySSpWZk_CrcYQLkLzxQDsSBftyEZ__w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,


Here's what I'd like to do using python scripting.
1) Initialize a set of points and edges that "look like a sphere" using
sphere=Sphere()
2) deform that set of points (and edges) to match a volume whose high
intensity region is also blob-like using an active shape model
3) visualize the evolution of the sphere deformation using paraview.

I only tell you so you can stop me if I'm doing this in a suboptimal way.

My immediate question is simply how can I extract/change the coordinates of
a Sphere() object? Are the points of a "sphere" object constrainted to
forever occupy a sphere shape?

Best,
Chris

Edit:

After doubling the amount of lifetime experience with paraview or vtk since
my last email, I think what I ought to do is create a filter that does a
single iteration of shape deformation. Then I'll create a script that
alternates "calling this filter" and rendering 500 times or so.

Let me know if that sounds incongruous with how Paraview works.

Background Idea:The points on the initial sphere should deform in a way
that minimizes the total 'energy' of the blob: edges should coincide with
sharp contrast in the background volume; surface normals should be minimial.

Thanks again,
Chris

Another alternative.

- create a filter that deforms the sphere up to a specific iteration
"N". This filter will have a "property" to set the current iteration
number.
- setup an animation to change the iteration number.

(assuming deforming to an arbitrary iteration is just as expensive as
going to a i+1 iteration).

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 4.3.1 client runs X out of memory
Message-ID: <555E45ED.70702@nasa.gov>

Hi. I created a VTK unstructured grid (.vtu) file for a 500 by 500 by 
500 point data set. In order to visualize it, I fire up 8 pvservers on 
my GPU multicore backend node using:

  mpirun -np 8 pvserver --client-host=XXX --use-offscreen-rendering

and connect to the root server from my ParaView client. I then open my 
vtu file and hit apply, I can see the file gets read in, and then 
nothing much else happens except X on my client grows to fill all of 
memory, and my client system (my desktop) becomes unusable. I'm guessing 
that the client is getting overwhelmed with X requests.

What am I doing wrong, and how to fix?

Thanks.

that make it works is this:

set PYTHONPATH=C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\win32;
C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\win32\lib;

Subject: [Paraview] Troubles with exporting selection labels from
 current ParaView render view

Utkarsh,

Thank you very much for answers about creating and initializing
DataLabelRepresentation. Now my source plugin works perfectly.

But, my exporting plugin (my first message) is still unable to export
labels which I get when try selecting several points. Here is what I
do:

1. Create Sphere and apply Elevation filter on it (I turn OFF 3d widget),
2. I select several points and in Selection Manager I select Elevation
for Point Labels,
3. In following code snippet I get only 2 message boxes (one of Sphere
and one for Elevation - both GeometryRepresentation),, but, there is
no DataLabelRepresentation.
4. I know how to extract labels parameters at this level (Selection*
parameters from representation), but not set of points over which are
generated labels,

// for all sources
for(i = 0; i < sources.size(); i++)
{
    // get source
    pqPipelineSource* source = sources.at(i);

    // for every source's output port, process it
    for(output_port = 0; output_port <
source->getNumberOfOutputPorts(); output_port++)
    {
        // traverse all representations
        for(j = 0; j < source->getRepresentations(output_port,
active_view).count(); j++)
        {
              QMessageBox::about(NULL, "",
GetCurrentSourceRepresentationSMName());
        }
    }
}

Should I try to catch
pqSelectionManager::selectionChanged(pqOutputPort*) to get data
structure over which are points which I can compare with data
structures extracted from vtkRenderWindow to generate labels?

Thanks for help in advance!

Nenad.

Dxy,

ParaView has certain overhead when a new source/filter is created. It
will need some more profiling, but creating 500+ readers would indeed
push things closer to that limit. ParaView/VTK typically uses
composite datasets/multiblock datasets for handling multiple parts of
the same dataset. Here's a "Script" for the Python programmable filter
that can open all the PLY files as a single multblock dataset.

# 0. Create the "Programmable Source" from the Sources menu.
======================================================
# 1. Set the Output DataSet Type to "vtkMultiBlockDataSet".
======================================================
#  2. Set as the "Script"
======================================================
output = self.GetOutput()
cc = 0
for i in range(1, 538):
  filename = "/tmp/data/%03d.ply" % i
  reader = vtkPLYReader()
  reader.SetFileName(filename)
  reader.Update()
  output.SetBlock(cc, reader.GetOutputDataObject(0))
  del reader
  cc = cc + 1
======================================================

Jeff,

Can you make sure the "Remote Render Threshold" is set to 0?

Also, do you have an X server running (and accessible) on the backend
nodes? You're not using "ssh -X" to login to the backend nodes, right?

Hi,

I found on this manual
http://vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/paraview/docs/HTML/paraview.htm#camera_controls.htm
that a previous version of ParaView had FlyIn and FlyOut among the controls
for 3D movements.

Do you if they are available in ParaView 4?

Best regards,

Thomas Oliveira

Thomas,

Alas no. That was something that was lost in 3.0 transition. I haven't
looked into it in detail, but if there's sufficient interest, it
should not be too hard to resurrect the old code.

Are there some examples available showing how to programming the camera

The position would be a function (x,y,z,t).
Hope my question is clear.

Subject: [Paraview] Call for papers: ISAV: In Situ Infrastructures for
	Enabling Extreme-Scale
Message-ID: <CAM8hOwa+EVHBupVRqmdS3A+Pe0gLCXFSa4qZit2NqBqSs5N-cA@mail.gmail.com>

=== Call for papers: ISAV: In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling
Extreme-Scale Analysis and Visualization ===
an SC15 Workshop, Monday afternoon 16 November 2015
Event web page: http://vis.lbl.gov/Events/ISAV-2015/


This workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners
from industry, academia, and government laboratories who use in situ
methods in extreme-scale, high performance computing. The goal is to
present existing in-situ infrastructures, reference examples in a range of
science and engineering applications, to discuss topics like opportunities
presented by new architectures; existing infrastructure needs,
requirements, and gaps; and experiences to foster and enable in situ
analysis and visualization.

The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ analysis
and visualization is due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings,
where data is analyzed/visualized while being generated, without first
storing to a filesystem. Second is the potential for increased accuracy,
where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some
complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability
to use all available resources, CPU?s and accelerators, in the computation
of analysis products.

In Situ processing is still a relatively new idea, and up until recently,
most implementations have been ad hoc, proof-of-concept prototypes.
However, several in situ infrastructure implementations have emerged.
ParaView and VisIt both provide tools for in situ analysis and
visualization. ParaView Catalyst can be  linked to a simulation, allowing
the simulation to share data with Catalyst for visualization. Similar
capabilities are available within VisIt with the libsim library. Both
Catalyst (through Live) and libsim enable the opposite flow of information,
sending data from the client to the simulation, enabling the possibility of
simulation steering. ADIOS and GLEAN allow simulations to adopt in situ
techniques by leveraging their advanced I/O infrastructures that enable
co-analysis pipelines rather than changing the simulator. The non-intrusive
integration provide resilience to third party library bugs and possible
jitter in the simulation.
Participation/Call for Papers
We invite short (4-page) papers that identify opportunities, challenges and
case studies/best practices for in situ analysis and visualization. These
papers could propose actions, or provide position, or experience reports on
in situ analysis and visualization.

Areas of interest for ISAV, include, but are not limited to:
* In situ infrastructures
 - Current Systems: production quality, research prototypes
 - Opportunities
 - Gaps
* System resources, hardware, and emerging architectures
 - Enabling Hardware
 - Hardware and architectures that provide opportunities for In situ
processing, such as burst buffers, staging computations on I/O nodes,
sharing cores within a node for both simulation and in situ processing

* Examples/Case studies
 - Best practices
 - Analysis: feature detection, statistical methods, temporal methods,
geometric methods
 - Visualization: information visualization, scientific visualization,
time-varying methods
 - Data reduction/compression

* Simulation
 - Integration:data modeling, software-engineering
 - Resilience: error detection, fault recovery
 - Workflows for supporting complex in situ processing pipelines

* Requirements
 - Preserve important elements
 - Significantly reduce the data size
 - Flexibility for post-processing exploration

Hi,

I would like to know how can i set Paraview to make the most use of my
nvidia graphic cards

Only by compiling with the properly CUDA libraries will i achieve that?

I've tried to compile but it seems that windows is having some trouble
finding the toolkit root dir, executables and libs

Can someone give me some tips?

Thanks in advance!

I do start an X server on the backend (and I don't use ssh -X). However, 
when I test the configuration using glxgears,
I see the window with the gears but they don't turn even though the app 
tells me how many frames
it rendered every 5 seconds.

My setup goes from my desktop (with GPU) through a front-end node 
(without GPU) to the backend (with GPU). Maybe some additional 
configuration is needed.

It seems like I need to get glxgears working properly before I try 
Paraview. What should I try? Thanks.

By default ParaView doesn't have CUDA support built-in.

Only a couple of plugins support CUDA and only for the features provided in
those plugins. The plugins that can use CUDA are: Piston, SciberQuest, and
Dax.

Hi Jeff,

It really sounds like you are unintentionally using X forwarding. It 
could be baked into your ssh config or a bash alias.
> I see the window with the gears
if you are really doing remote rendering, you won't see the window.

you may be able to confirm accidental X forward using ssh with -vv 
option. there would be a bunch of X connection messages if it was in use.

also output of glxinfo may have some useful info. When I have remote 
rendering setup I see

    name of display: :0.0
    display: :0  screen: 0
    direct rendering: Yes

with ssh -X

    name of display: localhost:10.0
    display: localhost:10  screen: 0
    direct rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting
    LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)

After some digging, it appears X forwarding is configured on in our ssh 
config. I got it to work by explicitly using ssh -x. Thanks for your help.

Steven,

Not sure if your question has been answered. Why not try turning on the
trace (tools>trace) then moving the camera, then turning off the trace? I
think that'll get you want you want and is a generally helpful technique.

Dear Utkarsh,

It would be great to have this functionality back. This way of navigating
through the model is needed by everyone who simulates flow inside object
with (many) channels, e.g., porous media.

Thanks,

Thomas

Utkarsh,
Thank you very much for your help! I tried as you said, but still the error. Did i lack of some settings?



Traceback (most recent call last):

Your grid has 2x2x2 points which means it has 1x1x1 cells.
You'll need 3x3x3 points to get 2x2x2 cells.

Hi,

I have two problems that happen when setting the size of the voxels of a
raw image.
Do you have any idea about it, please?

1) When I import a 3D raw image, if I set the data spacing, i.e., the size
of each voxel, to 1,1,1, I can correctly visualize and rotate the image.
However, if I set the voxel size to the values I need
(5.549E-6,5.549E-6,5.549E-6), the image is rendered as if clipped when
turned to certain angles (please see picture thisShouldBeCuboid.png
attached).

2) Another problem for the same image is that, if the data spacing is set
to 1,1,1, I get a certain contrast between grey and white (size1.png). If
it it set to 0.1,0.1,0.1, the grey color becomes whiter (size01.png).
Finally, when it is set to the correct small size, it is completely white.

Thank you for your help,

Thomas Oliveira

Subject: [Paraview] Extract the dimensions (or extent) of a structured grid
 within a python script
Message-ID: <939C321C-F7F0-4746-A566-11AA37E39523@geo.uib.no>

Hi,

I?ve been using a python script to post-process and visualise large structured grid files. It works great but the grids I am visualising are of different dimensions (let say either 512x128x512, or 1024x256x1024).

In the script pipeline - see snippet below -  I extract a subset (top cell layer in the Y direction) from the whole dataset, using ExtractSubset filter.

At this stage for the 2 input files dimensions above, I need to modify the script and correctly set extractSubset1.VOI values manually.

Is there a method that I could use in the script to get the dimensions (or extent) of the structured grid, so I can make the script extract the top layer I?m interested in for any grid dimension?


<snip>
from paraview.simple import *

    inputPvts = XMLPartitionedStructuredGridReader(FileName=[fname])
    inputPvts.PointArrayStatus = ['velocity']

    # get active view
    renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
    renderView1.ResetCamera()

    #get the 4 uppermost cells
    extractSubset1 = ExtractSubset(Input=inputPvts)
    extractSubset1.VOI = [0, 512, 127, 128, 0, 512]
    extractSubset1.SampleRateI = 1
    extractSubset1.SampleRateJ = 1
    extractSubset1.SampleRateK = 1
    extractSubset1.IncludeBoundary = 0
doCoolStuff...
</snip>

So far, I?ve tried reading the VOI from the extractSubsetFilter, but the indexing of the extent is not showing the grid dimensions:

    dimensions = extractSubset1.GetPropertyValue('VOI')
    print dimensions

But that returns an array [0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1]. And I can?t seem to be able to use relative indexes in the filter like: extractSubset1.VOI = [0, -1, -2, -1, 0, -1].

Any thoughts?

Cheers

Guillaume

Hi folks,

The Call for Participation for the SC '15 Scientific Visualization Showcase
is out. This is a great opportunity for the community to highlight the
wonderful visualization work going on. Please consider submitting an entry
(or more).

http://sc15.supercomputing.org/program/scientific-visualization-showcase

SC15?s Visualization and Data Analytics Showcase Program provides a forum
for the year's most instrumental movies in HPC.  Six finalists will compete
for the Best Visualization Award, and each finalist will present his or her
movie during a dedicated session at SC15 in a 15-minute presentation.
Movies are judged based on how their movie illuminates science, by the
quality of the movie, and for innovations in the process used for creating
the movie.

Best,
-berk

Guillaume,

Use data information [1] as follows:

  UpdatePIpeline(inputPvts)
  extent = inputPvts.GetDataInformation().GetExtent()

See Section 3.3 from the ParView Guide[2] for more details.

Subject: [Paraview] Import h5py in python shell
Message-ID: <000001d097b1$107bf8b0$3173ea10$@lucas@gantha.com>

Dear all,

 

I am currently trying to use the h5py module in the Python Shell in ParaView
4.3.1 (64 bits). On my system, h5py comes from my installation of python-xy
and works fine outside of ParaView.

 

I tried to import the module by providing the path to the package, using
mainly two methods:

- append the path to the package with sys.path.append before doing the
import

- import the module using the imp package and providing the full path to
imp.load_source

However, both methods failed to load h5py, returing the following error :
"ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid win32 application".

 

Thank you for your help.

 

Jean-Michel

Thanks a lot Utkarsh for your assistance!

I've added the following to my python script, and it worked smoothly:

    inputPvts.UpdatePipeline()
    extent = inputPvts.GetDataInformation().GetExtent()
    print extent

returns:

(0, 512, 0, 128, 0, 512)

Oops my bad. You need to add the following to the start of the script:

   from paraview.vtk.vtkIOPLY import vtkPLYReader

Hi,

I am trying to do some parallel programming within paraviews python shell
and have encountered a problem. If I run the following two lines of code in
the python shell, the result is that a whole bunch of new paraview sessions
will be started...

from multiprocessing import Pool
pool = Pool();

It appears that a new paraview session is being created for each thread of
the thread pool. Unfortunately, I am not able to then use the thread pool
to run functions assynchronously.

Regards,
Bruce

Stephen,
Here is another cool feature added recently (thanks Utkarsh for the tip)
that allows one to add a custom Python animation to time-dependent data:
Open the animation view:

View > Animation View
Next to the + sign, choose Python and then click +
Double-click on the timeline to the right of Pyton.

You'll get a skeleton script that you can fill in. Here is a sample script
that just moves the
camera closer and father from the data.

from paraview.simple import *

from math import *


def start_cue(self):

    self.camera = GetActiveView().GetActiveCamera()

    self.start = 0

    pass


def tick(self):

    self.camera.Dolly(1 + sin(self.start * pi / 6) / 2)

    self.start = self.start + 1

    pass


def end_cue(self): pass

Bruce,

Try the attached patch. You'll need to apply it to the VTK subdir
under ParaView.

Thanks for the quick response Utkarsh. However, I am using the windows
binaries and have not built paraview from scratch.

Cheers,

Bruce,

Alas, you'll need to build from source (or wait till the changes land
in ParaView nightly binaries). It's indeed a bug in the code that
needs to be compiled.

Hi folks,

The last official email I can find regarding the state of Qt5 within ParaView is from February 2014: http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2014-February/030629.html

Could anyone enlighten me what the current state is with respect to making Qt5 the default for building ParaView? Or is qt-4.8.2 still the recommended default?

Thanks a lot in advance,

Michael

Utkarsh,

I appreciate your response. I spent this past week first trying to get the
X Server running and it seems it never worked so I gave up on that and have
turned to building ParaView with the Llvm CPU Rendering option enabled.
It's taken me a while but I believe I have all the dependencies installed
including OSMesa 9.2.2 but I don't know what to make of the CMakeLists.txt
file. The wiki isn't too clear on this part and I have no experience with
CMake.

I copied the CMakesList.txt that comes with the source files for
ParaView4.0.1 to a new source directory and have also created a new
directory for my build and followed the advice to point the ccmake to the
source while in my new build directory. I get a EMPTY CACHE message

The following ling under the Configuring ParaView for use with OSMesa,
there is a script but I don't know what to do with that. I assumed I would
need to apply it to the CMakeList.txt but the variables seem different than
what I am seeing in the second link below in the Configure ParaView With
CMake on Unix - the image in that section shows different variables and no
description on how to apply the Llvm stuff or it may and it's going over my
head.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

Could you give me some advice on how to use CMake so I can get a version of
Paraview with OSMesa Llvm as the source for rendering? Appreciate any
advice!

Thanks!
Noah

Subject: [Paraview] Utilizing ParaView Server
Message-ID: <CAFvyM3QHeJjMUG782wLow1xKcwvUqk5Z73ADvck8+vhO9u3O2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey what's up?

I have a couple questions about using ParaView server?

1. I have figured out how to connect to the localhost as an example. I am
trying to understand/figure out how paraview can actually update live
images once data is being published to whatever port is specified? Is there
any documentation that you can lead me to? I'd appreciate it.

2. Also, I have to deal with CoreDX DDS socket communication. Is there any
support with that from ParaView or is there a way to create a plugin that
can manipulate the "middleground" between my  types and paraview's types
over the server?

Thanks again Guys!

Kevin E. Dean

Not sure I understand your question. Data generation or reading and data
processing happens on the server and images (or open gl commands) are sent
back to the client.
For documentation check out:

I am not familiar with CoreDX DDS.
ParaView uses TCP sockets and MPI. You can re-implement a few classes make
ParaView use any communication protocol.

Hi,

Since I want to use axes grid, I have just install the latest version of
paraview from github. Axes grid is working properly but latex text with '$
$'  and python shell is not working. Is there any work-around to enable
these in the git hub version.

Thanks

I am assuming you built your own version of ParaView. You'll need to
install matplotlib in the Python you used to build ParaView.

Message-ID: <201505281512.t4SFCGSt000736@msw2.awe.co.uk>


Good afternoon,

I was wondering whether anyone could give me some guidance on how to run/create regression tests for ParaView.

I build/install each release of ParaView on a number of platforms, so I am looking for a way to validate correct build and installation, and also to check correct performance of our own plugins etc. A subset of the standard regression tests would probably be sufficient for validating correct installation.

Step-by-step instructions would be awesome - if available.

Many thanks,
Jim

Jim,
Very likely not what you are looking for (i.e., not automatic), but there is a list of tests that I run (manually) every time we release.  They are on the wiki, bottom right.  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Release_Testing

Message-ID: <CADhXwgv+GEoq6eJcA3cMGZ9UaPTbM2MznO+DZKJtjTh1WLUg7Q@mail.gmail.com>

I am using Paraview Catalyst (v. 4.2 since 4.3 doesn't seem to work with
Catalyst generated scripts) and I have data which has uneven true times:

0 0.1 0.15 0.18 0.25 ...

When I output data from Catalyst's generated scripts, it outputs a series
of files using the time step (0, 1, 2, 3, ...), but the true time
information appears to be gone.

How can I get this information back so I can properly annotate and view my
data?

I am using vtkImagaData and the outputted files are *.pvti and *.vti files
of the full dataset.

Hi Andrew,

In your Python script the data description (called datadescription usually)
object has the time and time step information in it. You can get that with
datadescription.GetTime().

I think your best bet would be to create a pvd file (
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#PVD_File_Format) that
contains the actual time step information to use that for animations, etc.

What was the specific issue that you had with the Catalyst generated
script? If it's a bug I'd like to try and get it fixed. Note though that
the generated scripts may not always work between versions of ParaView
(i.e. a script generated in PV 4.3 may not work with a simulation code
linked to ParaView Catalyst 4.2).

Regards,
Andy

Hi Dmitry,

What is wrong with the lookup tables that ParaView makes for you with the
xdmf file? Regardless of the file format, once ParaView opens the data it
just sees sets of arrays really and the GUI lets you create and assign
lookup tables.

The .vtk file format's ability to store a lookup table near the data values
is an anachronism in my opinion. I would be surprised if ParaView respects
it actually. Instead ParaView's approach is to treat the data as data and
give you ways to save off an restore lookup tables and other visualization
parameters independently of the data (state files for example).

cheers

I want to deprecate Xdmf2 and make Xdmf3 the default the next release.
Because Xdmf3 adds a dependency on boost Xdmf will have to become optional
in ParaView. The Kitware binaries will have it on because we already
Superbuild in boost for the VisItBridge, but other versions could easily
drop it.

I don't think I tested that particular path in Xdmf3.  If you can make a
small test dataset which disproves its working, I'll likely be able to fix
it and add it to the regression test suite for Xdmf3 in VTK.

Not sure I understand the question, much less the answer, but lets have a
go shall we?
Set's can have their own attributes and those attributes can be grid
centered. So if the set has all the edges, then the set's grid centered
attributes apply to all of the edges in the mesh.

Could do. I can't think of a reason off the top of my head why vtk's
cell->GetEdge is any less well defined than cell->GetFace()->GetEdge() and
it is probably faster. Maybe that is why the "bug" is there in xdmf1/2.

OK, I probably confused things by mixing this in. I'll ask it as a

Yes, and this should also help to fix point (2) above, since Triangles 
don't have Faces, only Edges.

Message-ID: <CA+acnwYq8p04dkaxhM2-4hPyFrbKDwH04d3Rd4kVDU7=pkEdTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to generate a wide variety of probe location points and plot
selection over time, in 4 models.
This demand a significant amount of time to do manualy.
I would like to know if it is possible to automaticaly generate the probe
location points.
And if it is possible to automatically plot selection over time to this
same generated points.

I found this explanation:
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-May/021311.html , but It is
not clear to me how to do it.

I prefer to do it without programming.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Joice,

First question do you want "probe location" or select a cell/point? If you
can describe the workflow you'd use to do this manually for 1 point, I'll
know better what approach might work for you.

Thanks

Jim,

Look at what we do for ParaViewSuperbuild [1, 2]. That may give you
pointers. You can potentially setup a simple cmake project that simply runs
your test suite.

ParaView packages its own Python. You'll either need to build ParaView from
source using the Python installation you have or install h5py in the Python
packaged with ParaView.

Michael & Christian,

Thanks for your emails. I've been doing some other things, but am 
returning to this question. Michael, I am attempting to use the solution 
you proposed: 
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2013-June/028596.html

However, when I try to adapt this to use ExodusII instead of Xdmf, I 
crash Paraview. I copied the code from the above link, and simply 
replaced 'Xdmf' with 'ExodusII'. When I try to load my xml file into 
paraview using the plug-in manager, that's when I cause the crash. I've 
successfully loaded the plugin in its un-modified form (e.g. the Xdmf 
form), so I must not be modifying the code correctly. I'm sure it's 
something exceedingly simple (I've tried replacing 
class=vtkExodusIIReader with class=vtkExodusReader for example), but I 
don't know what I'm doing wrong.

Here is my code:

<ParaViewPlugin>
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
   <ProxyGroup name="sources">
<SourceProxy name="EXODUSRrefresh" base_proxygroup="sources"
base_proxyname="ExodusIIReader" class="vtkExodusIIReader">
       <Property name="Refresh" command="Modified"
panel_widget="command_button"/>
       <Hints>
         <ReaderFactory extensions="e" file_description="ExodusII Reader
(Refresh button)" />
       </Hints>
     </SourceProxy>
   </ProxyGroup>
   </ServerManagerConfiguration>
   <ParaViewReaders>
     <Reader name="ReaderWithButton" />
   </ParaViewReaders>
</ParaViewPlugin>

Any help from anyone would be appreciated!

Alex

Hi Samuel,

The issue with the symmetric tensor magnitude calculation is that ParaView
doesn't know it's a symmetric tensor so it doesn't know that it needs to
sum the off-diagonal values twice. All that is know for these arrays are
how many components there are. A three-component array could be
representing either a 3D vector or a 3D anti-symmetrix, second order tensor
so it's the user's responsibility to compute the magnitude properly where
"shortened" representations of tensors are used.

Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Filters applied immediately?
Message-ID: <C9D6A042-027D-4034-81F2-9F2A79E5B63A@gmail.com>

I'm having a problem with Paraview immediately applying a filter once I select it to be used before I can adjust the parameters I want it to use when applied to the data. Is there some setting that I need to change? I'd like to avoid this unnecessary computation time. And I'm not sure why it started doing it this way. Previously, I had to acknowledge the application of the filer by clicking the 'apply' button before it would do so. Any help would be much appreciated.

You've accidentally enabled "Auto Apply". You can turn it off from the
"Settings" dialog (General Tab).

I am not entirely sure what 1 is. However, for 2, try changing the "Scalar
Opacity Unit Distance" from the "Properties" panel. ParaView will set it to
a value based on the data spacing after the first "Apply". If you change
the spacing after that, you can use the "Reset using current data values"
button next the option on the "Properties" panel to recompute using the
current data values.

Nenad,

DataLabelRepresentation is a subproxy of the GeometryRepresentation and
that has been the case since as long as I remember. That means that when
you iterate over representations in the view, you'll never see a separate
DataLabelRepresentation proxy. Each source proxy has a GetSelectionOutput
method that you can use to get the source proxy which is doing the
"extracting" tasks to extract selected points. To see if the source proxy
has a "selection" set, you can use the
vtkSMSourceProxy::GetSelectionInput() method.

Hope that helps.
