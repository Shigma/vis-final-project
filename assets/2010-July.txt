Hi,
Thanks for the previous help... it has reduced my work to a great extent.

Please could you help me in 2 more situations..

One: I have made some color schemes with fixed colors for different values
ranges and few with different opacity.
So how Do i use these user defined color schemes. (By exporting? and
further steps?)
Other half is that I want to use them on all my images. But the lower n
upper limits of pixel values differ and if i rescale the color scheme, the
ranges will change around center values (say near 0 to 1). Is there a
better option.


Second: Please could you tell me an option for: The user gives me input
file locations and the output will be the image being opened by paraview
with different filters and rescaling applied on it.

Thank You in advance.
Regards
Rhushabh

Subject: [Paraview] Question about ParaView 3.8.0 and Qt libraries
Message-ID: <AANLkTimJjzzOFl0uVmaQtca_NDcx6naL-yuF49KDKkQx@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I should compile and install ParaView 3.8.0 on a Linux Debian cluster and I
have a question about Qt libraries >= 4.5:

should I compile and install Qt on every single node or can I install Qt
only on master node? in this last case, should I install Qt on a directory
shared among every node or can I use the default installing directory (for
example: /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.6.2)?

Thank you very much

Message-ID: <31878155.67313.1277972906635.JavaMail.www@wwinf8401>



Hello,

I have written a vtu file with a concave polygon (see the image" concave.png" enclosed). I am surprised because the rendering in ParaView is inappropriate (the mode is "Surface").I tried the same thing with a vtp file and it was the same result. Moreover, when I try to visualize a vrml file which contains concave polygons (see the image "building.png" enclosed), I have the same problem. In a vrml viewer, the concave polygons are well rendered. Am I wrong or ParaView only treats the convex polygons ? Should I triangulate my files ?? (I don't want to triangulate because people can believe that there was a physic simulation).

Thank you for your answers.?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView parallel - CPU-exhaustion
Message-ID: <SNT123-W19D5A0DBE77FEF527E5956BCCD0@phx.gbl>


Hi!

I have recently noticed, that when starting the pvserver in parallel mode, it uses the full capacity of all CPU's it's started at, regardless if there is actually something visualized or not. Is there any option to prevent this?

Apart from there is the idea to install ParaView at the new supercomputer in Vienna, the VSC (Vienna Scientific Cluster). Since it is open source, I suppose, there are no judicial problems, but please correct me if I am wrong. 

So I wanted to ask about parallel reading of files and so on - ParaView does that for sure, but honestly, I don't really know which fileformat this requires. HDF5 can be read correctly, I think, since there is a compiler option, but other file formats - it would be nice if you could point me somewhere to read about "ParaView on supercomputers". 

Thanks a lot!

Kind regards,
Natalie Happenhofer

It depends. There are some rendering features of ParaView that use Qt such
as Charts. If you aren't going to use charts then Qt is only needed for
building the client Gui. Putting it in a shared location is fine, we do that
on our own small cluster. Using the 'Module' package makes this very easy.

I believe you are trying to "open" the python script as a data-file
from File |Open menu-option. To run a python script from the GUI, you
open the Python shell from "Tools | Python Shell" menu and then click
"Run Script" on the bottom-left corner to load the script to run.

Natalie,

An explanation about the continual use of CPUs can be found on this wiki page:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#Server_processes_always_have_100.25_CPU_usage

The licensing of ParaView is fully open, so there should be no problem installing on the VSC.

File format for large scale parallel file access is a sticky issue right now.  Parallel file formats are still evolving.  The HDF5 library included with the ParaView build is used for the XDMF reader and, yes, it is designed to do coordinated parallel reads.  As such, it is probably a good first choice for files read on a large computer.

-Ken

Thanks Pat - it works :)

Is there any change we could change line 198 in vtkProcessModule.cxx to set
the Z shift value to 2.0e-4 instead of 2.0e-3?  That fixes my cases.  If
this is remove altogether I get dotted lines when drawing contour lines on a
surface.

Subject: [Paraview] adding a custom view
Message-ID: <AANLkTikI7PpUrmqHZoqWPVaABU1VZduQZweiJ_b1kSIq@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I try to follow the wiki "adding a custom view" (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_custom_view), but when I
built , I have this following error :
MyView.h:1:33: error: pqGenericViewModule.h: No such file or directory
I use the version 3.8.0 of Paraview.
Do you have an idea of what happens ?

Best Regards,
Didier Roiss?

Hi all,
I'm a fairly regular paraview user, but I have never been able to figure 
out how to make changes to the orientation axes.  They always appear in 
the lower left, they always have the same colour scheme, and size.  How 
can I change their position, colour, and size?

Thanks,
Michael

The pqGenericViewModule has been replaced by pqView.h. You may want to
look at  Examples/Plugins/GUIView/ in the ParaView source for an
updated version of that plugin example.

Great.  What about changing the size and shape of the arrows themselves, 
giving them thicker stems etc?

Hello Samer,

Well, hopefully someone more knowledgeable will speak up if I'm wrong, but after playing around for a while I don't think you're going to be happy with ParaView's support (and probably VTK underneath) for image data with bit attributes. (For example, I couldn't get volume rendering to work, and I got some errors like: vtkOpenGLScalarsToColorsPainter (0x12a099f70): Cannot color by bit array, even though it _would_ actually color it.)

I don't know of a reader offhand that will support single bit data attributes (I tried the old VTK and newer XML-based VTK formats and it didn't work well, and I'm not sure what other readers would work -- the .raw reader in ParaView also seems to have a limit of char at the small end). I have a feeling you could create a custom reader with the Python Programmable Source. You can look at some examples here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.

You can create a sample of this type of data directly in ParaView to see what is supported and not with single bit attributes: 

1. Create a Wavelet Source
2. Apply a Python Programmable Filter
Use this as the Script:

# ---------------
from paraview.vtk import vtkBitArray
import random

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)

ba = vtkBitArray()
ba.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
ba.SetNumberOfTuples(pdi.GetNumberOfPoints())
ba.SetName('bits')
for ii in range(ba.GetNumberOfTuples()):
	ba.SetTuple1(ii,round(random.random()))

pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(ba)
pdo.GetPointData().SetActiveScalars('bits')
# ---------------

You can see in the Information tab that a bit array is created, and you can try coloring by that array, but only Slice representation seems to work well. Contour filter seems to deal with it okay, though, so maybe this will still be useful to you.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hi,

  Could someone please (publicly if possible) gives an update on the
OverView application as shipped in paraview 3.6.x and 3.8.x ? I am
having issues compiling it, and I am wondering if I am missing
anything (did the development move somewhere else?).

Thanks,

Hi,

Thank you for keeping with this problem. I was able to track down the bug to
be caused by your Source and Build directories not being on the same drive.
Intill the issue is solved I suggest you move your source and build trees to
the same drive.

Subject: [Paraview] multiple windows in pvpython
Message-ID: <4C2CF652.9010808@northwestern.edu>

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to reload a pvsm from Paraview within pvpython, which has
several views. The code is the following

from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.LoadState("NonlocalDamage.pvsm")
views = GetRenderViews()
for view in views:
     view.ViewSize = [100,100]
     view.ViewPosition = [0,0]
     view.StillRender()

Unfortunately, the ViewPosition command does not seem to work so that
all the windows open on top of each other. Any suggestions, how to solve
the problem?

If there is a more detailed documentation available how to manipulate
the output in pvpython, it would be great if you could send me the link.
Is there a possibility to make these windows interactive, so that I can
zoom or modify the camera  interactively?

Thanks in advance
J?rg F.

This is not currently supported in ParaView from python. We plan to
add support for this in 3.10.

Hello Eric,

Thanks again that you're the one answering my questions. Well
unfortunately I haven't ever worked on python before, so it would be a
good idea to avoid it in the beginning till I find it the only solution to
my problem. Could you please tell me how you managed to open the bit
images with Paraview and/or VTK? even if it gives some errors, it's OK,
because I'm not asking for so much in the output, I just want to see some
simple 3D visualisation for my images.

Actually I'm surprised, that in VTK I read in the manual that it's
supposed to accept the bit format, but it did not open on paraview when I
tried converting my binary images to VTK format by adding the appropriate
header. So did I miss something in that conversion? The header I added is
the following:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
blablabla
BINARY
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 1024 1024 512
ORIGIN 0 0 0
SPACING 1 1 1
POINT_DATA 536870912
SCALARS OutArray bit 1
LOOKUP_TABLE default


Actually this discussion tempts me to ask the question, can I use VTK as a
markup language to open my data files? or should I install this header
into my data file so that both the data and the header are in one file?

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Samer

Subject: [Paraview] GetAnimationScene() in pvbatch?
Message-ID: <4C2D2D5C.2070208@slac.stanford.edu>

Hello.

I'm building a batch script run by pvbatch.  So far, all is well; I can 
load multiple meshes, use the calculator, do some clipping, etc.

But when I do the following (copy-pasted from a paraview trace from the 
gui version of ParaView):

      AnimationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()

I get the error:

       NameError: name 'GetAnimationScene' is not defined

Looking at

       http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

suggests I'm doing the right thing.

I am using a recent (within the last few weeks) copy of the paraview 
sources via git.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Greg

It's possible your ParaView is not recent enough. This code was added
on Jun 22 by the following commit.

Does anyone have an example of using vtkGradientFilter to compute the
gradients of a single vector in your data-set? I've tried using
SetInputScalars, but it tells me that there is no input array,. although the
array I pass it does exist.

Thanks a lot.

Actually, I tried now to start the pvserver with mpirun -np 4 -mca mpi_yield_when_idle 1 pvserver , but I did not observe any differences to mpirun -np 4 -mca mpi_yield_when_idle 0 pvserver in the CPU-usage.

Re: [Paraview] ParaView parallel - CPU-exhaustion


Natalie,



An explanation about the continual use of CPUs can be found on this wiki page:



http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#Server_processes_always_have_100.25_CPU_usage



The licensing of ParaView is fully open, so there should be no problem installing on the VSC.



File format for large scale parallel file access is a sticky issue right now.  Parallel file formats are still evolving.  The HDF5 library included with the ParaView build is used for the XDMF reader and, yes, it is designed to do coordinated parallel reads.  As such, it is probably a good first choice for files read on a large computer.

Hi!



I have recently noticed, that when starting the pvserver in parallel mode, it uses the full capacity of all CPU's it's started at, regardless if there is actually something visualized or not. Is there any option to prevent this?



Apart from there is the idea to install ParaView at the new supercomputer in Vienna, the VSC (Vienna Scientific Cluster). Since it is open source, I suppose, there are no judicial problems, but please correct me if I am wrong. 



So I wanted to ask about parallel reading of files and so on - ParaView does that for sure, but honestly, I don't really know which fileformat this requires. HDF5 can be read correctly, I think, since there is a compiler option, but other file formats - it would be nice if you could point me somewhere to read about "ParaView on supercomputers". 



Thanks a lot!



Kind regards,

Natalie Happenhofer

Thanks! My mistake was in this line:
 
g.SetInputScalars(0, var)
 
I was using 1 instead of 0 as I was getting the enum from vtkDataSet rather
than vtkDataObject, which is why it couldn't find my variable (it was
looking for cell data rather than point data). Confusion on my part (partly
due to lack of coffee), but thank you for providing the example.
 
Regards,
 
Adriano

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Compute gradients


Here an example to compute the gradient of var, and store the result as
new_var. 



g = vtk.vtkGradientFilter()
        g.SetInput(Bloc)
        g.SetInputScalars(0, var)
        g.SetResultArrayName(new_var)
        g.Update()
 
Bloc.GetPointData().AddArray(g.GetOutput().GetPointData().GetArray(new_var))



Maybe you forgot the "Update" ? 


2010/7/2 Adriano Gagliardi <agagliardi at ara.co.uk>



Does anyone have an example of using vtkGradientFilter to compute the
gradients of a single vector in your data-set? I've tried using
SetInputScalars, but it tells me that there is no input array,. although the
array I pass it does exist.

Currently, the informatics folks at Sandia and Kitware are focusing on
developing
functionality in VTK and Titan (http://titan.sandia.gov/). Our target
delivery platforms
vary from custom desktop applications (Qt, Titan and VTK) to web
applications. In
fact, we have a tutorial in IEEE VisWeek where one of the session will focus
on
developing such applications. We  are not focusing on a general purpose
end-user
application because of this. We have  longer term goal of bringing more
infovis functionality
into ParaView. I don't expect that  the OverView application will continue
to exist in its
current form.

Please let us know what kind of infovis functionality you would like to see
in ParaView.
We'll do our best to integrate them soon.

Hey Samer,

Part of my point was that I had trouble loading data into ParaView, so I was creating it within PV to see how it handled bit data. 

It looks like you are right that the legacy VTK format supports bit attributes, so that may be your best bet for trying to get your data into PV. There are various warnings around, though, that you _must_ write your binary data in *BigEndian* format. I was able to create a data set in PV and then save it in legacy VTK and load it back in okay. I'll attach both binary and ascii version of this so you can compare the two to see how the binary is constructed. It looks like you just need a newline after the header part, and then your binary data written out as 8 bit characters, and then a newline at the end.

I don't think that the VTK file formats can refer to data in another file, so if I understand you correctly it won't work as a markup language like .xmf files with HDF5. So, if you really need to stick with bit images you'll probably have to write the legacy VTK as a separate, single file.

Good luck,
-Eric

Hey Rhushabh,

Offhand I don't see a way to load exported color maps (lookup tables) through python, but it's not difficult to just create what you want in the script. Either use the python Trace functionality while you create a new lookup table by hand, and then "Show Trace" to see how they're constructed using GetLookupTableForArray, or use "Trace State" with some elements colored to see all of the options for this method.

I think you won't have any choice but to explicitly adjust your lookup tables to compensate for any shifts in your range of image values. Also, I don't think there is a way to specify lookup tables in ParaView that have opacity less than 1.0. In volume rendering it's possible, and if you texture polygons with images that have transparent regions ParaView will display it properly, but the lookup table creation for non-volume-rendering doesn't allow you to specify opacity values.

I am not sure about that in the Paraview but you can use imagemagick, an
open source image manipulation tool for linux. You can find more information
for how to add logo here

Hi,

As Utkarsh said, there is no paraview api to position the windows, but you
can get the vtkRenderWindow and set the position like this:

window = view.GetRenderWindow()
window.SetPosition(450, 0)

It is possible to set a background image in paraview. Create a large
image with a log at one corner and then set that as the background
image. Go to Edit | View Settings to change the background image.

Hi Robert,
Then I guess my ParaView is pretty done building except the missing 
python26_d.lib for _Xdmf. Any idea on that?

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Compute Derivatives Filter
Message-ID: <AANLkTimU2LIWOYBDqtQydEEqwLDdy2bFfF_mGZppVgeL@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to compute the vorticity vector from a 2D dataset.
My dataset file is .vtr format.
This is what I do:

>Calculator: to get u_vector = ux*iHat + uy*jHat
>Compute Derivatives: to get Vorticity

As soos as I press Apply, Paraview crashes without any error.
I have used several versions of Paraview and I get the same problem on linux
machines.

Could this be a bug?

Thanks,
Mohamad

Hi,

Maybe you could try to use a 3D vector u_vector = ux*iHat + uy*jHat +
0*kHat, instead of the 2d vector.... ?

Aur?lien

Thank you so much. I'll start working on a python reader, if I could
create it, I will share it with the community.

There are various warnings around, though, that you _must_ write your binary data in *BigEndian* format. I was able to create a data set in PV and then save it in legacy VTK and load it back in okay. I'll attach both binary and ascii version of this so you can compare the two to see how the binary is constructed. It looks like you just need a newline after the header part, and then your binary data written out as 8 bit characters, and then a newline at the end.

Message-ID: <BAY148-w37A6677D2C19B362CF8337B2B10@phx.gbl>


I try to compile VS on XP with Visual C++ 2008.
I managed to create a static version but now I would like to have a shared version in order to add plugins.
And I get this error:

Linking...

Any idea of what is the problem?

Subject: [Paraview] What are the 3.8.0 ParaView Development Installation
	packages?
Message-ID: <F8780885882C45B3A82AEB8792AAA256@notebook>

Hi,

I am wondering what the 3.8.0 ParaView Development Installation packages are
on the website?
http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

I would have thought the development version should be 3.9.0. When I build
from source I get 3.9.0 and therefore the 3.8.0 "dev" prebuilt binaries are
not compatable.

I tracked down a Windows prebuilt 3.9.0 dev version here:
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.9/ and that works with a "build from
source" back-end. So I am wondering if there are plans for other flavours.

The reason I ask is that I would like users to be able to download the
"bleeding edge" version easily to be able see if issues they have in 3.8.0
are resolved in the next release (and possibly start using that instead).

Cheers,

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Using Threshold
Message-ID: <4C329FD2.3040004@caltech.edu>

Hi all,
I have been using the Threshold filter for some time and now I am 
discovering it doesn't do what I want it to do.
I have a surface made up of a set of points, each point has a location 
in 2-space, and a function value attached to it, -2, -1, 0 or 1.
I would like to filter out all points that don't have a particular 
value, say zero.
I plot the full shape, and place a Threshold filter on top of it, 
excluding everything above (say) 0.2,a nd everything below -0.2.
If I tick the box that says "All scalars", none of my points show up, 
even though I can see by the colour coding that there are some points 
with the zero value.  If I untick the box then those points do appear, 
but so do neighbouring points with other values.  What's going on here?

Thanks,
Michael

Hi Michael,

The threshold filter copies cells, not points, from the input dataset to the output dataset. So, since you have point data it must use a rule to decide whether or not a given input cell should be included in the output based on the points that make up the cells.

When you click on "All scalars," it uses the rule that *all* the points of a given input cell must be inside the threshold range (i.e., between -0.2 and 0.2) in order for the cell to be copied. It sounds like none of your cells have all 0 values at their points, so the output is empty.

When "All scalars" is unchecked, the rule is that *any* point of a given input cell matching the threshold criterion will result in the input cell being copied to the output. In this case, cells with *any single* point value between -0.2 and 0.2 will cause the cell (and *all* of its points, even those which don't meet the threshold) being copied to the output.

So, what is it that you really want to do? You might consider clipping by the scalar field (that will get the shape right but break cells up into pieces) or converting the input dataset from cells that connect points to just a point cloud by using the glyph filter to create a VERTEX cell at each input point. You could then threshold the point cloud. In that case you'll get just the points that match as output, but they won't be connected to other points as they were in the original mesh.

	Hope this helps,
	David

I understand now.  I definitely want to break it up into a point cloud, 
probably using the glyph filter to create a vertex cell at each point. 
How do I go about this?

How can I force the pipeline to reexecute my custom data source? 

 

Currently RequestData is called once, but I would like to be able to
restructure input data whenever a change is applied to the pipeline. Is
this possible?

 

As some background, I want to be able to regenerate my input data at a
higher resolution when the user applies the clipping filter.

Hi Michael,

Load your data. Go to the Filters menu and choose "Glyph". When the filter options appear in the Object Inspector panel, set the "Glyph Type" to "2D Glyph". Then, a "2D Glyph" box will appear. Select "Vertex" in its drop-down menu and click the filter's Apply button.

Note that if you have more than 5000 points, you'll need to turn off the "Mask Points" option or it will randomly choose 5000 points and only output those (this was done so that rendering of large datasets would be possible, but since you plan to subset the output of the Glyph filter with a Threshold filter there is no need to mask points).

Hello,
I have built PV with VS2008 and shared libs.
When I compile my plugins, it creates for each one a .idb and a .lib file, while it seems that only .dll are expected as plugins.
Should I ask CMake to create a .dll instead and how?

Because I tried it but it did not work:
  - the first error is due to this line:   static MYLIB_EXPORT vtkFiniteDifference *New();
    that is I followed the advice at the end of the cmake page:
If you have some static functions then you will need something like 
the following: 



class MyStaticFunctionClass
{
  public:
    static MYLIB_EXPORT void MyExportedFunction(int i);
};
but it seems that it does not work with constructors since contructors do not have any return type.

My CMakeFiles.txt looks like this:

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_LIBRARY(vtkFiniteDifference SHARED vtkFiniteDifference.cxx)

# Add the new plugin in the MOSART submenu
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(FiniteDifference "1.0"
                    SERVER_MANAGER_XML FiniteDifference.xml 
                    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkFiniteDifference.cxx
                    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES ../MOSART_GUI.xml)

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(/Developpement/ParaView-3.8.0/VTK)

Is there any redondancy between the ADD_LIBRARY and the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN lines?

Any help?

Once you changed your data on your custom data source, you will have
to mark your datasource as Modified().
Then, a simple Render() or Update() will recompute the pipeline.

The wiki page you cite is still relevant for cmake/visual studio with  
shared libraries. You do NOT need this line in your CMakeLists.txt file:

> ADD_LIBRARY(vtkFiniteDifference SHARED vtkFiniteDifference.cxx)

The ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN should do that for you.

class MyStaticFunctionClass
{
public:
static VTK_EXPORT void MyExportedFunction(int i);
};

Subject: [Paraview] What are the 3.8.0 ParaView Development Installation
	packages?

A version that tracks the nightly master is an interesting idea. The main
reason we started creating the development packages was more so that folks
could build their own plugins that will work against the released binaries
of ParaView without needing to build ParaView yourself.

If you want the constructor exported, you should export the class (which
exports all of its public API), not a single function within the class.
Also, if you export a class, all of its parent classes should also be
exported.

Subject: [Paraview] Rv:  1 script open different vtk files
Message-ID: <216664.10085.qm@web24913.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

hi again, 

I tried to run the script through the python shell, but it still comes up errors. The error message is the following:

Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 3.8.0-RC2\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\simple.py", line 109, in OpenDataFile
raise RuntimeError, "File not readable: %s " % filename
RuntimeError: File not readable: C:\Documents and Settings\Nit@\Mis documentos\stuttgart\hiwi\outputtk\output\out1-1.vtk 

Does someone knows why is still not working? It seems that it can not read the vtk files. I tried different many details like change " for 'or putting only the filename (not the whole file extension). The Render should be reffered to somewhere or it's ok with an empty ( ) ? or it's a problem of the file type?

#The python script is the following:

from paraview.simple import *

reader1 = OpenDataFile('C:\Documents and Settings\output\out1-1.vtk')
reader2 = OpenDataFile('C:\Documents and Settings\output\out1-2.vtk')
reader3 = OpenDataFile('C:\Documents and Settings\output\out1-3.vtk')
reader4 = OpenDataFile('C:\Documents and Settings\output\out1-4.vtk')

Show(reader1)
Show(reader2)
Show(reader3)
Show(reader4)


Render()

#############

Thanks again

Asunto: Re: [Paraview] 1 script open different vtk files

I believe you are trying to "open" the python script as a data-file
from File |Open menu-option. To run a python script from the GUI, you
open the Python shell from "Tools | Python Shell" menu and then click
"Run Script" on the bottom-left corner to load the script to run.

Try putting the file under "c:\temp" does that help?

Subject: [Paraview] User arguments & the programmable filter
Message-ID: <3B56188414634DEB9C2848C3A5506F00@win.ara>


Dear All,

Is it possible to pass user arguments into the programmable filter without
having to manually edit the code? For example, I have a simple file writer
and the user must define the filename to write to. Rather than having to
copy and paste the code and manually enter a new filename each time, is it
possible to turn this into a custom filter which gives the user the option
of entering a filename to write to?

Regards,

Adriano

Hi Adriano,

It is possible to do this so that the user does not have to write/modify any
code, but it requires that you write a plugin.  Let me know if you're
interested, I have some example of doing that I can send to you.  There is
one outstanding bug, once it is fixed I plan to post the information to the
paraview wiki.

Hi Pat,
 
So it is only possible to do this by wrapping the programmable filter in a
C++ plugin, which will then allow you to create a new GUI interface? The
reason I ask is that I am currently trying to find the limitations of using
the programmable filter to quickly test out new ideas for plugins. So far it
has been very useful, although I've still not found any examples using the
Request Information box. 
 
I'd be interested in seeing an example if you have time.

Hi,

Using the temp folder no changes happen, but changing the slashes the message error also changes. Now the error message is the following:

Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 3.8.0-RC2\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\simple.py", line 115, in OpenDataFile

setattr(px, param, params[param])
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 3.8.0-RC2\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\servermanager.py", line 201, in __setattr__
"to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute FileName does not exist.  This class does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.
Some ideas?

Also, try changing the backslashes to forward slashes.

Hi Pat,
 
Just to clarify by example, I was refering to the plugin you mentioned and
not for Request Information! :-)

Hi Adriano,

It is possible to do this so that the user does not have to write/modify any
code, but it requires that you write a plugin.  Let me know if you're
interested, I have some example of doing that I can send to you.  There is
one outstanding bug, once it is fixed I plan to post the information to the
paraview wiki.

Dear All,

Is it possible to pass user arguments into the programmable filter without
having to manually edit the code? For example, I have a simple file writer
and the user must define the filename to write to. Rather than having to
copy and paste the code and manually enter a new filename each time, is it
possible to turn this into a custom filter which gives the user the option
of entering a filename to write to?

Regards,

Adriano

Hi Pat,

What is the bug you're meaning of ?
The control of time by the programmable filter ? :-)

Asunto: [Paraview] Rv:  Rv: 1 script open different vtk files


Hi,

Using the temp folder no changes happen, but changing the slashes the message error also changes. Now the error message is the following:

Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 3.8.0-RC2\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\simple.py", line 115, in OpenDataFile
reader = globals()[xml_name](FileName=filename, **extraArgs)
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 3.8.0-RC2\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\simple.py", line 542, in CreateObject
setattr(px, param, params[param])
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 3.8.0-RC2\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\servermanager.py", line 201, in __setattr__
"to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute FileName does not exist.  This class does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.
Some ideas?
Thanks again!

Hi,

You can use the calculator to calculate sqrt(coordsY^2+coordsZ^2) and use
the plot data filter.

Hello,

I also test all my 'codes' in the programmable filter first.
To deploy a filter I put the filter body inside a python file. Then in  
the programable filter I put:

input_file='hello'
output_file='bye.log'
execfile('my_custom_filter.py')

And finally I create a custom filter 'Tools->Create Custom Filter'  
with the right name and I expose only the 'script' property.

at the end, the user has a filter in the filter menu, and only has to  
change the filename. (all the other properties are hidden).

And if you work in a centralized environment, you can make upgrades to  
the python file without redeploying your solution.

I hope It will help you.

Felipe

Subject: [Paraview] Question about showing a few nodes/points using vtk xml
Message-ID: <4C332A8B.5050703@GMail.com>

  Hi,

I am trying to show a few points (not a mesh) with their values in 
Paraview using an XML VTK input-file
Here are the contents of my .vpt file:

<VTKFile version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" type="PolyData">
<PolyData>
<Piece NumberOfPoints="6">
<Points>
<DataArray NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii" type="Float32">
0 0 0.0
0 0.5 0.0
5 9.5 0.0
5 10 0.0
14 9.5 0.0
14 10 0.0
</DataArray>
</Points>
<PointData>
<DataArray format="ascii" type="Float32" Name="myValue">
1.0
4.0
9.0
15.0
80.4
100.3
</DataArray>
</PointData>
</Piece>
</PolyData>
</VTKFile>


After opening this file in Paraview, it show the points (when I use 
"select points through").
If I show the legend, the max and min values are correct.
If I show the values as labels, they are correct.
What I would like to know is how I can get the points to show the right 
color.

BTW, Paraview crashes if I change the file to only use 2 components.....

Thanks in advance for your help,

Luis Manuel

It could be a bug, but I cannot replicate it.  Any chance you could send some sample data?

Hi all,

I am trying to compute the vorticity vector from a 2D dataset.
My dataset file is .vtr format.
This is what I do:

As soos as I press Apply, Paraview crashes without any error.
I have used several versions of Paraview and I get the same problem on linux machines.

Could this be a bug?

Thanks,

The bug I was referring to, is the problem of creating a custom filter that
uses a filter loaded via plugin.

Hey guys,

I can verify that I see this same thing using 3.8.0 on OS X and Windows 7, 64-bit, but my git head from about a month ago (OS X) works fine.

Felipe,

That is a useful option that I never thought about.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [Paraview] User arguments & the programmable filter

Hello,

I also test all my 'codes' in the programmable filter first.
To deploy a filter I put the filter body inside a python file. Then in the
programable filter I put:

input_file='hello'
output_file='bye.log'
execfile('my_custom_filter.py')

And finally I create a custom filter 'Tools->Create Custom Filter'  
with the right name and I expose only the 'script' property.

at the end, the user has a filter in the filter menu, and only has to change
the filename. (all the other properties are hidden).

And if you work in a centralized environment, you can make upgrades to the
python file without redeploying your solution.

I hope It will help you.

Felipe

Hey Luis,

You need to specify not only points, but some types of cells (with connectivity information) in your VTP file. If you want just disconnected vertices, here is an example:

<VTKFile type="PolyData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <PolyData>

        </DataArray>
      </PointData>
      <CellData>

      <Points>
        <DataArray type="Float32" Name="Points" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii" RangeMin="0.57506519638" RangeMax="1.9611330035">

        </DataArray>
      </Points>

        <DataArray type="Int32" Name="connectivity" format="ascii" RangeMin="0" RangeMax="5">

        </DataArray>
      </Verts>
    </Piece>
  </PolyData>
</VTKFile>

A good way to test the file formats is to create the type of data you want with ParaView Sources and then Save As the data format you want to use. (Here I created a Point Source, followed by the Tetrahedralize filter to create an Unstructured Grid with each point being its own cell, and then an Extract Surface filter to turn it back into PolyData. I just ran the Elevation filter to create a scalar attribute.)

Talk to you later,
-Eric

By default, ParaView draws cells, not points.  (You've found one exception where selected points are drawn.)  If you want to see points in general, you will need to create "vertex" cells.  One way to do that is to run your data through the glyph filter and select the "2D Glyph" and then "Vected" glyph types.  Or you can add vectex cells directly to your data as follows.

<VTKFile version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" type="PolyData">

<Piece NumberOfPoints="6" NumberOfVerts="6">

After opening this file in Paraview, it show the points (when I use
"select points through").
If I show the legend, the max and min values are correct.
If I show the values as labels, they are correct.
What I would like to know is how I can get the points to show the right
color.

BTW, Paraview crashes if I change the file to only use 2 components.....

Thanks in advance for your help,

I have a surface made up of a set of points, each point has a location in 2-space, and a function value attached to it, -2, -1, 0 or 1. I would like to filter out all points that don't have a particular value, say zero. I plot the full shape, and place a Threshold filter on top of it, excluding everything above (say) 0.2,a nd everything below -0.2. If I tick the box that says "All scalars", none of my points show up, even though I can see by the colour coding that there are some points with the zero value.  If I untick the box then those points do appear, but so do neighbouring points with other values.  What's going on here?

So, since you have point data it must use a rule to decide whether or not a given input cell should be included in the output based on the points that make up the cells. When you click on "All scalars," it uses the rule that *all* the points of a given input cell must be inside the threshold range (i.e., between -0.2 and 0.2) in order for the cell to be copied. It sounds like none of your cells have all 0 values at their points, so the output is empty. When "All scalars" is unchecked, the rule is that *any* point of a given input cell matching the threshold criterion will result in the input cell being copied to the output. In this case, cells with *any single* point value between -0.2 and 0.2 will cause the cell (and *all* of its points, even those which don't meet the threshold) being copied to the output. So, what is it that you really want to do? You might consider clipping b
y the scalar field (that will get the shape right but break cells up into pieces) or converting the input dataset from cells that connect points to just a point cloud by using the glyph filter to create a VERTEX cell at each input point. You could then threshold the point cloud. In that case you'll get just the points that match as output, but they won't be connected to other points as they were in the original mesh.

Great, thanks.

Also, when I do regular 2D glyphs, I find that they are flat and only 
properly visible when the camera is looking down on them from the 
z-direction.  How do I ensure that the glyphs are always properly 
visible to the camera?

Yup.  It looks like a bug.  In fact, compute gradients seems to crash whenever the output tensor is set to nothing (and is otherwise valid).  I submitted a bug for this:

Thanks for narrowing down the problem and reporting it.

Hi Ken,

I narrowed this problem down a bit.
So, this happens when I have the parameters set as
1- "Vorticity" as the Output Vector Type.
2- "Nothing" as the Output Tensor Type.

If I choose "Strain" or "Vector Gradient" for the second part, it seems to work.
Attached, I also have added the vtr file I used. Feel free to test it to find the problem I had mentioned.

As soos as I press Apply, Paraview crashes without any error.
I have used several versions of Paraview and I get the same problem on linux machines.

Could this be a bug?

Michael,

As far as I know, there is no way to do this in ParaView. You can use a vector field to orient the 2-D glyphs at each point, but their orientation is fixed relative to the dataset not the camera.

Subject: [Paraview] Buggy development package?
Message-ID: <938026D1-17FE-42B6-B804-8CBA796AE164@gmail.com>

Hi all

I wanted to give the new development package (ParaView-Development-3.8.0-Darwin-x86_64.tar.gz) a try and use it to compile a plugin on my Mac. However, it seems that lib/paraview-3.8/CMake/ParaViewLibraryDepends.cmake contains XXX_LIB_DEPENDS variables referencing libraries from the custom Qt installation used to build the package (/Users/partyd/Dashboards/Support/qt-4.6.2-MacOSX10.5). Of course, none of those Qt libraries can be found...

As a hack I just unset the offending pqComponents_LIB_DEPENDS and vtkPVServerManager_LIB_DEPENDS variables after including PARAVIEW_USE_FILE. But I suspect this might fail on some operating systems.

Currently I have no idea how this could be fixed in a good way, since these entries are auto-created by CMake. Perhaps one way would be wrapping TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES in a custom function that explicitly sets the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, replacing Qt libraries by "\${QT_LIBRARIES}", suitably escaped such that it ends up as ${QT_LIBRARIES} in the ParaViewLibraryDepends.cmake file, expanding to the users installation of Qt when it is included.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom readers for files with 'similar' extensions
Message-ID: <5861C625258167499D051F0CE1D0FE4B0325A67E@GLKMS2104.GREENLNK.NET>

Hello all,
 
I have a set of output files, one of extension *.ren and another of
extension *.ren.out.  I have two custom readers which open these files
correctly if only one of the reader plugins is loaded at a time.  If
both are loaded then paraview will segmentation fault occasionally.  The
problem I believe is the common .ren between the two files.   Paraview
is incorrectly choosing the .ren reader when a .ren.out file is opened.
I have tried using both .ren.out and .out as the extensions in the
reader.xml and still have the same problem.  I have resorted to renaming
my .ren.out files to .r.out and leaving the reader xml to open .out
files.  If there is a way around this without having to rename files
that would be great.
 
Many thanks,
 
Duncan

Hi Duncan,

Do both of your plugins provide a method CanReadFile()? If not, that'd
probably solve the issue.
There are many reader classes in the ParaView source tree that may
provide you with a suitable template for your CanReadFile method.

I've had a quick look and they both do, but are simply functions that
return '1' with no checking involved.  I'll have a look through the
source plugins as you suggested to see if I can find some examples.

Also, ParaViewConfig.cmake, VTKConfig.cmake and VTKLibraryDepends.cmake have similar problems.

When I said that unsetting the XXX_LIB_DEPENDS variables was solving the problem, I was mistaken. It actually breaks things, but I didn't notice it until tried to load the plugin (I was using -undefined dynamic_lookup ...).

Coming to think of it, shouldn't one also use the same Qt version that was used to compile ParaView? So that one should also be included in the development package, right? And on Mac the frameworks should have their install_name directory set to @executable_path/../Frameworks and the libraries to @executable_path/../Libraries. Of course, ParaViewUse.cmake should make sure that the correct Qt is discovered and used.

I was able to recreate the error. I am going to try and fix it now.

Subject: [Paraview] volumetric glyph
Message-ID: <936832.77902.qm@web113310.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have some particle data (points with other data) to which I can attach 
different glyphs.That works fine except of when I make a clip of it. The glyphs 
are limited to polyData so they display only surface, which is problematic for 
me since I would like the clipped surface to be solid. 

Therefore my question: is there any way of making volumetric glyphs (like solid 
ball) or any other solution to this problem?

Thanks,

Pawel

Are you clipping the original dataset and then applying glyph or are
you clipping the result of the glyph filter?
In other words which of the following two pipelines describes your case:

1> DataSource -> Clip -> Glyph
2> DataSource - >Glpyh -> Clip

Suppose I have a set of points in space, with a integer at each point 
(think Sphere->CellCenters->GenerateIDs) and want to render a text 
numeric at each point).  Is there a way?

Select Cells Through and rubber band select the whole screen.
Open selection inspector panel, scroll to bottom, turn on cell labels,
and pick the array you want to display.

Warning, with big data this is impractical, which is why there isn't a
more direct way to do it. You can probably create a macro (from within
the python shell dialog) that does this if you do not work with big
data.

Ok, is there a way of telling the vector heading of the current camera 
position?

Hey Michael,

If you really need non-vertex 2d glyphs that face the camera, hopefully someone can help you get closer to that, but I wanted to mention another option: Point Sprites. If you have a point cloud and change the Representation to Point Sprite, you can go to the Display tab and change the Point Sprite Mode to Texture, then under Point Sprite Texture you can choose Load... and it will let you open an image file to place at every point and they will always face the camera.

Good luck,
-Eric

Why not allow things like this, but be sure to put a question dialog
box, something like "This dataset appears to be very large. Adding a
label at each point may be very slow." If everything that wouldn't
work well on a large dataset was disallowed, we wouldn't be able to
have much fun at all!

Thanks,

David

We are also having this issue. It happens when you use pipeline 2, i.e. 
make a point source, then apply a glyph (e.g. a box). Then get a clip 
(or a slice, for that matter), which shows that the box is actually 
nothing more than an empty shell. We cannot clip before applying the 
glyph, unfortunately.

I want to clip the glyph, that is to use the pipeline 2. Clipping the data is an 
alternative, but then I want to have an animation rotating the clip normal and 
this will cause cells to disappear/appear from nowhere which looks strange. I 
think having solid glyphs would solve this problem.

Pawel

Are you clipping the original dataset and then applying glyph or are
you clipping the result of the glyph filter?
In other words which of the following two pipelines describes your case:

1> DataSource -> Clip -> Glyph
2> DataSource - >Glpyh -> Clip

Message-ID: <CE2FC9C461BAB942B0ED268009C8497C0124D7F5@exchange17.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

As part of a source plugin I am developing, I would like to provide gui
input parameters. Many of the sources in paraview already provide this,
such as the Sphere source, which allows properties like radius to be
adjusted manually.

 

I have included the IntegerVectorProperty xml fragment (see below),
which I believe should enable such an option and have provided a
corresponding public listener method (also below) on my
vtkRebinningSource, which is derived from vtkPolyDataAlgorithm. When I
select the plugin from the sources menu in paraview, I get the error
message:

 

ERROR: In
..\..\Paraview_source\Paraview-3.8.0-RC2\Servers\Commmon\vtkProcessModul
e.cxx, line 1066

.... 

: Object type: vtkRebinningSource, could not find requested method:
"SetNumberOfXBins" or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

 

while processing

Message 0 = Invoke

...

 

Presumably, I have not registered the event listening method correctly.
While this is simple to do in raw vtk, I haven't found any description
of how to do this in the paraview documentation. Can anyone provide me
with guidance of how I might do this for my source plugin?

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Owen

Hi,
First of all, your public virtual function is called 'SetNuberOfXBin'
whereas the XML try to
find SetNumberOfXBins. If this is a copy/paste from your real code, you would
have to check your syntax.

Second, the XML describes an IntegerVectorProperty with 10 elements, thus
I expected to find a function in your VTK class of the form:
   SetNumberOfBins( int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int );

For clarity purpose (I don't know how mandatory it is), I would then declare
the default values as default_values="1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1".

Really, I don't understand what you are trying to do. Usually, a SetNumberOf...
is described as
                <IntegerVectorProperty name="NumberOfXBins"
                                                   command="SetNumberOfXBins"
                                                   number_of_elements="1"
                                                   default_values="1">
                   <IntRangeDomain name="range" min="0">
                </IntegerVectorProperty>

And your VTK class should implement a public function
    void SetNumberOfXBins( int n );
The better being to use a vtkSetMacro for a basic accessor method. But you may
have some additional processing when setting the value, making vtkSetMacro
unsufficient : in this case, don't forget to call Modified( ) in your
Set method unless
the pipeline won't update accordingly to your expectations.

I'm thinking we should put text labeling in as an auxiliary
representation (like cube axis). It will borrow from the info/geo vis
representations that downsample and place a readable number of labels.
(Side note: Visual clutter is more of a problem than speed. You can
only draw a few hundred words on any given display and have them be
legible. Thus visualization was invented.) The representation will
have a checkbox (with a popup warning) that the user can hit to tell
it not to downsample.

In any case, someone will have to spend a week or four implementing
that, managing the streaming and/or server side rendering such that
the client does not get overwhelmed and crash. If you want to see this
in ParaView soon, please vote for it on user voice to give it some
priority, or better yet implement and submit a patch.

Subject: [Paraview] Client side to server side plugin
Message-ID: <5861C625258167499D051F0CE1D0FE4B0325AC6B@GLKMS2104.GREENLNK.NET>

Hello all,
 
I have some plugins on a linux box that work as client side plugins.  I
would like to be able to connect to the linux box from a windows box
using pvserver and use the existing plugins.   I quickly found out that
I couldn't just load the existing libraries as server side plugins.
What do I have to do to enable them?  Can this be done without compiling
on the windows side?  I have tried the REQUIRED_ON_SERVER flag in the
CMakeLists  but would need some GUI XML (I think) on the client side?
 
Many thanks,
 
Duncan

In non-trivial cases, every box needs it's own compilation of the
plugin. So you will have to compile the plugin for both windows and
linux and then load the appropriate version on each process using the
plugin manager.

If it's just a reader without any custom GUI panels or Qt resource
files then, you can simply load the server side plugin. There's no
need to load the plugin on the client-side, in that case.

Hello,
how to cope with the fact using vtkstd:: causes syntax errors on VS2008 while it works well on g++?

    p = vtkstd::lower_bound(start, end, *it, vtkstd::less<double>());

error C2039: 'lower_bound' : is not a member of 'std'

Subject: [Paraview] Displaying strong discontinuities/XFEM
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1007080758540.4879@stanley.site>

All:

I have done a bunch of searching on google, as well as the list archives. 
The results I have found are 3-4 years old, so I thought I would ask this 
question, to see if the answer is now different . . .

How does one display strong discontinuities?  By "strong", I mean 
discontinuities in the field variables themselves (as opposed to the 
gradients).  The context is that I have an XFEM method (which represents
discontinuities along arbitrary surfaces within elements).  For 4-node
quadrilaterals in 2D, I have 4 nodal DOFs for the continuous part of the 
solution, and 4 nodal DOFs for the discontinuous part of the solution. 
Additionally, I represent the surface of discontinuity using a signed 
distance function, which is characterized by 4 nodal DOFs.

It seems like the old school solution is basically to split the elements 
which contain the discontinuity into multiple elements, the display the 
new "elements", that now have discontinuities along the inter-element 
boundaries.

I was just wondering if there is now anything that is more 
elegant/natively supported.  Thanks.

Cheers,

Neil

If you prefer to use vtkstd instead of vtksys (Don't ask me what is

Thx all of you.
I actually did not include algorithm.h but since everything went fine with g++ I simply did never realize that something was missing.

Is there an easy to get the diff between the released vtk-5.6.0 and
and the branch used in paraview-3.8.0?

Hi,
  Thanks a lot for all the help given before.
 Please could you tell me that can I open run the python code from outside
paraview (without opening any instance of paraview), and get the output
images(snapshots/full 3-D images) after execution of the code.

  Thank You in advance

Gitweb doesn't do diffing between arbitrary commits, so probably the easiest way is to just checkout the v3.8.0 tag from the ParaView repository, initialize the submodules, change into the VTK directory and do a "git diff v5.6.0".

Hi,

it seems that the libQtHelp.so library is missing from the binary package 
ParaView-Development-3.8.0-Linux-x86_64.
I tried to install it on a system which does not have this library 
natively installed, and end up with the error :

Instead of launching the graphical interface of ParaView, you can
launch the pvpython executable which is a python shell from where you
should be able to execute your script. And I think you can directly
provide a script as argument so you should be able to execute your
script in one command line.

Also, you can directly use a regular python interpretor so long as the
the environment is setup correctly. Refer to:

Hi Neil,

I am afraid that the old school solution is the only out-of-box solution. If
you are willing to spend some quality programming time with VTK, there are
folks on this and VTK lists that can help you with implementing your own
cell types. It is a non-trivial task though.

Normally, this is the kind of project that I am happy to take on. 
However, as I am working on the last phase of my research, as well as 
writing my dissertation, it's not something that I really have time for 
right now.

I figured out how to convert my XFEM data (non-standard interpolation 
functions) to DG data ("regular" elements where the discontinuity lies 
along the inter-element boundary), which appears to display my results 
just as I expect.  Thanks for the response!

Cheers,

Neil

Subject: [Paraview] hiding intermediate filters created from python
Message-ID: <OFFBCDD9B1.42851600-ONC125775B.004D3766-C125775B.004EEB62@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hi,

I have made a script that creates a bunch of sources and filters (to use 
as legends), and finishes by an append filter to which everything is 
appended. 
Only this last append filter has a representation.
I would like to have only one entry in the pipeline browser for the last 
append filter, and completely hide the steps used to create the legend, is 
it possible from python?
If I try to encapsulate all this in a custom filter to show only the 
append filter as output, it does not work either.

Thanks,
Stephane

typical script : 

text0 = a3DText()
text0.Text = "0"
trans0 = Transform()
trans0.Transform = "Transform"
trans0.Transform.Scale = [1, 1, 1]
trans0.Transform.Translate = [0, 0, 0]

text1 = a3DText()
text1.Text = "1"
trans1 = Transform()
trans1.Transform = "Transform"
trans1.Transform.Scale = [1, 1, 1]
trans1.Transform.Translate = [1, 0, 0]

append = AppendDatasets( Input=[trans0, trans1] )
pres = Show(append)

If you have a checkout of VTK, the following would give you a diff between
the tag and the hash used in ParaView,

git diff v5.6.0..8b2449

You can also replace diff with log to see the commits, or log -p to see the
commits with diffs for each commit. I hope that help.

Subject: [Paraview] Reset camera center of rotation
Message-ID: <AANLkTinSSOx62mOWoeMFaUmhUMqwQzKez-MqbgAZRY3Y@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to know if there is a (python) way to reset the center of
rotation (like the Reset button in the paraview GUI/Camera toolbar) ?
I notice that the ResetCamera() function doesn't reset the center of
rotation ....

Any idea?

Best Regards,

Laurent

GL doesn't handle concave polygons and subdividing concave polygons into
convex ones would add substantial overhead to the common case when none are
present, so VTK and therefore ParaView do not either.

See this thread where the issue was recently discussed for ideas about how
you might go about fixing the the geometry so that it is rendered well.

Hey Stephane,

It comes close to working for me if I do the Custom Filter thing, but not quite -- what problems are you seeing if you try to do this?

When I'm trying to create a Custom Filter out of the sources & filters you specified (no inputs, append filter output and exposing the text entry line edits in the panel) I get an error when I hit Finish:

Warning: In /Users/emonson/Programming/ParaView_git/ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMProxy.cxx, line 1451
vtkSMCompoundSourceProxy (0x120fe05f0): Proxy AppendDatasets1 already exists. Replacing

And then when I try to load this custom filter (really a source) from an exported .cpd file in Python and use it, the 0 and 1 actually show up in the 3D view, but nothing shows up in the Pipeline Browser and I get this error:

Representation could not locate the pqPipelineSource object  for the input proxy. 

If I try to use this custom source from the Sources menu, I get these errors:

ERROR: In /Users/emonson/Programming/ParaView_git/ParaView/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 727
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x11c4b2270): Input port 0 of algorithm vtkAppendFilter(0x11c4b0fe0) has 0 connections but is not optional.

but the digits show up in the 3D view and after that I can change the text, etc.

I get similar behavior if I try to make a Custom Source out of a Cone plus a Sphere and an Append Datasets filter, but no Transform filters (same "Proxy AppendDatasets1 already exists" and "vtkAppendFilter has 0 connections but is not optional" errors as above), so there may just be some sort of bug with trying to use an Append filter in a Custom Source...?

I also get the same behavior and same "Representation could not locate the..." error even when trying to display a very simple (a customized cone) custom source from Python (even though this one works fine from the Sources menu). Maybe problems with Custom Sources from Python, too...?

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Plot field data over time?
Message-ID: <CC827FBF-35BB-45AC-8ED6-852F344F7573@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to understand the Plot Global Variables Over Time filter. I have an unstructured grid with multiple time steps I'm reading in to ParaView from a temporal collection in an Xdmf file. With each time step I have a "Grid centered" value that's getting read in properly as Field Data.

It sounded from the (?) button help file that Plot Global Variables Over Time should allow me to plot this Field Data over time, but when I run it I only get Time and vtkValidPointMask in the resulting Row Data.

Am I misunderstanding the use/point of this filter?

Thanks,
-Eric

	pointSprite with Sphere
Message-ID: <AANLkTilUitk1vzUC288KtpoWNzVWMsbhhZsXoM_rPyTq@mail.gmail.com>

*Paraview Version:* 3.8.0
*Plugin*: pointSprite plugin
*OS:* Windows 7, 32 bit.

I recently started using paraview, and whenever I try to use PointSprite
plugin with Sphere mode [I use a point source with 500 points, and change
point sprite mode to 'Sphere'] , I get the error "In
..\..\..\src\VTK\Rendering\vtkShaderProgram2.cxx, line 450 vtkShaderProgram2
(0BF67D38): a shader failed to compile".
The error log that got generated can be viewed from
http://cid-bf4825315fd31e46.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=BF4825315FD31E46!151&Bpub=SDX.Docs&Bsrc=GetSharingLink
.

I found a similar issue in the September 2009 mailing list archive [
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013883.html].
However,
it was pointed that the bug has been fixed in version 3.8, the version I am
using.

It would be great help if someone could point out if I am doing anything
wrong, or if its an issue, how I could fix this.

Thanks,

Hi,
I have recently built ParaView from git source on a Windows7 64bit and 
MSVC2010. After launched the application (release version), when I try 
to open a file by either clicking the open_file icon or through 
"File"-->"Open" menu, the program crashed. The top of the call stack reports
 >    QtGui4.dll!000000005d32456f()
Does anyone have similar experience and any suggestions? Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

Dear All,
I just registered to the paraview user forum and I have a hard time finding
a search field to look for previous posts. What is the best approach to find
something on the forum old posts?

Subject: [Paraview] streams from CSV table
Message-ID: <AANLkTinRo2PMkQqGA4P7OktQfDwql-bp8PlYpF4AARPZ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I am convinced that my problem was answered before but I cannot find the
post. As the subject says my data is a coma separated value file that
contains 6 columns (3 for X, Y, Z and the last 3 for a vector component). I
am able to import the data and the I apply Table to Pint filter, followed by
a calculator to build the vector (A=ihat*Ax+...). I do then a Glyph filter
and I can see the vectors.

I would like to visualize the vector field line as tubes. The way I
understood this works is to apply a streamline filter followed by the tubes
filter but it does not work. I am surprised that I have problems with such a
simple data set. Probably this is the problem. I have reading that I need
"structured" data in order to generate streamlines. What is the best
approach to my problem?

Thank you,
Dragos

(Here I created a Point Source, followed by the Tetrahedralize filter to create an Unstructured Grid with each point being its own cell, and then an Extract Surface filter to turn it back into PolyData. I just ran the Elevation filter to create a scalar attribute.)

I usually go to ParaView's main web page (http://paraview.org), then click Help -> Mailing Lists.  That will give you a text box that you can search the mailing list archives.  It actually sends you to the exact same markmail link Michael just sent, but it's a lot easier for me to remember how to get to the ParaView page than the markmail page.

Subject: [Paraview] streams from CSV table
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTinRo2PMkQqGA4P7OktQfDwql-bp8PlYpF4AARPZ@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C8607668.17C1B%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The issue is that ParaView regards your data as a bunch of points in empty space.  When the stream tracer looks at the empty space, it sees no field and terminates the streamline.

To see streamlines, you need a topology that interpolates field values around the points.  The easiest way to do that is to apply the Delaunay 3D filter to your data (or the Delaunay 2D if your points are on a plane).

Dear all,
I am convinced that my problem was answered before but I cannot find the post. As the subject says my data is a coma separated value file that contains 6 columns (3 for X, Y, Z and the last 3 for a vector component). I am able to import the data and the I apply Table to Pint filter, followed by a calculator to build the vector (A=ihat*Ax+...). I do then a Glyph filter and I can see the vectors.

I would like to visualize the vector field line as tubes. The way I understood this works is to apply a streamline filter followed by the tubes filter but it does not work. I am surprised that I have problems with such a simple data set. Probably this is the problem. I have reading that I need "structured" data in order to generate streamlines. What is the best approach to my problem?

Thank you,
Dragos

Hi,

I just fixed this on the master branch of ParaView.

Hi Madhura,

A quick review of the file
ParaView/Plugins/PointSprite/Rendering/Resources/Shaders/Quadrics_vs.glsl
shows it is missing a statement #version 120 at the beginning as
transpose() is defined for GLSL>=1.20.

It does not mean it will fix your issue because your card has to
support GLSL>=1.20. What is your card? what version of GLSL does it
support?

To answer this question, as your are on Windows, download, install and
run glview (latest is 3.22):
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_FAQ#Windows

In the main panel, you will see something like:

OpenGL version 3.2  see details

Click on "see details"

You will see a second panel, the second part is called "Report"
One of the first few lines of this report will be about the GLSL
version, for example:

"Shading Language version: 1.50"

Message-ID: <681782.54201.qm@web24915.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi, 

I'm trying to open a vtk file with a Python script. Do someone know which is the 
appropiated command? Do I need special libraries?

Thanks for advance

The solution has been post previously but here is what you should look for.

# The python script is the following:
from paraview.simple import *
reader = OpenDataFile('...\out1-1.vtk')
Show(reader)
Render()

Subject: [Paraview] histograms on time dependant datasets (pvd) with PV 3.8.0
Message-ID: <4C3C1144.3070507@scconsultants.com>

When I create an animation using Histogram filter on the PVD, the 
histogram is not updated (keep showing the distribution for t=0). I am 
using the same pipeline as in PV 3.6.2. Is there is different protocol 
to use with PV 3.8.0 ?

Thanks for any feedback

Hello,

I would like to know how to perform something like "Zoom to box"
functionality in python?

Thanks,

The ResetCamera function is probably what you're looking for.  To get a
desired zoom level I typically use the parallel projection scale funcion.

view = GetRenderView()
view.ResetCamera()
view.CameraParallelProjection = 1
view.CameraParallelScale = [someValue]

Hello Philippe,

What is your pipeline? Are you running this from the GUI, or from Python? Did you compile this version yourself, or is it downloaded binaries for some platform?

When I open a time-dependent PVD file and put a histogram right after it in the 3.8.0 pipeline and hit "Play" on the VCR controls, the histogram updates with each time step. (OS X 10.6.4, PV binaries downloaded from paraview.org)

Eric,
Actually this is a regular binary downloaded from Paraview.org. (windows 
32 , same problem on linux 64)
the play operates correctly but the "save animation" only saves the 1st 
frame (t=0) of the histogram. On the other hand, the 3D Vtu view is 
correctly updated.
My pipeline is a simple "pvd >> histogram"

Eric,

If I remember correctly, this filter is designed to work with
ExodusIIReader alone. Exodus puts what it calls "Global Variables" in
the FieldData, and this filter is generating a plot for that. It
shouldn't be too hard to create a "Plot FieldData Over Time" filter
modeled on vtkExtractArraysOverTime.

Hey Philippe,

Yes, I can verify that saving animations of time dependent chart views doesn't work  properly on my system, either. (Both 3.8.0 and git head.) I tried with Histogram, and also with Plot Over Line and Plot Data (the latter at least changed once in a while during the animation save, but only every few frames, and some strange arrays popped up and were plotted that weren't part of the data...)

It looks like you'll have to file a bug report:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view_all_bug_page.php

(Or, go to paraview.org under Resources->Bug Tracker menu item. If you have trouble, let me know and I can file it.)

Thanks,
-Eric

Hey Utkarsh,

Thanks for the clarification. Do you know if there are any data sets with this type of global field data in the VTK or ParaView data samples so I could see what that looks like?

Thanks,
-Eric

This is the best thing to ensure it is not missed, once you have filed it I
can assign it to myself. I am working through some ParaView bugs at present
in preparation for ParaView 3.8.1.

Sorry for the noise -- I see that can.ex2 has these variables.

Sorry, apparently my message did not go through the other day. I was
saying exactly what you figured out.

Basically you have a card that does not support GLSL>=1.2. It just
means that the pointsprite plugin will never work on your machine.

Yes, a solution is to get a better card. An nVidia GeForce>=6 should support it.

PS: Please keep the discussion on the list.

Regards.

Subject: [Paraview] Cell-centered data with vtkTecplotReader
Message-ID: <D663C545A1F2452B8A7585BC7C70AE59@win.ara>


Dear All,

I've got a Tecplot file containing cell-centered data, which is working fine
with Tecplot. However, ParaView doesn't recognise the file header:

====tecplot file header begin====
TITLE     = "FLOWFIELD"
VARIABLES = "X" "Y" "Z" "RHO" "U" "V" "W" "CP" "P"
ZONE T="BLOCK 1", I=35, J=39, K=105, ZONETYPE=Ordered, DATAPACKING=BLOCK,
VARLOCATION=([4-9]=CELLCENTERED)
====tecplot file header end====
====data-layout====
====all X values====
====all Y values====
====all Z values====
====etc====

Should this data-set be supported? If not, can someone describe which are
not supported? I'd prefer to avoid using Tecplot for the post-processing,
but I may not have much choice in the matter.

Regards,

Adriano

Subject: [Paraview] How to do volume rendering of image data?
Message-ID: <4C3EC8B5.5090203@xhuntley.net>

According to the Paraview FAQ, Paraview supports volume rendering of 
image data.  But despite searching the Web and buying the Paraview book, 
I have not been able to find any detailed descriptions of this feature, 
let alone directions for or examples of how to do it.

I have several image stacks in png format which represent slices of 
3-dimensional objects.  I can convert an image stack into a vtk file and 
open the file in Paraview, but after that I'm at a loss.  Is it possible 
to do a volume rendering and end up with a photorealistic image of the 
reconstructed 3D object?

After opening the vtk file created from the image stack and choosing 
volume representation, all I see is a black block.  The black is 
evidently the background image area surrounding my 3D object.  I would 
like to make the black transparent and thus reveal the object, but it 
seems to me that creating a custom color scale to control opacity would 
result in color mapping and interpolation which would destroy much of 
the original color in my image.  Is there a way to declare a single 
color transparent without affecting the other colors in the image?  Is 
this a valid way to pursue volume rendering of image data?

Up to now I have been using Osirix to reconstruct 3D objects from stacks 
of slices and do photorealistic renderings of them.  But Osirix has not 
been able to handle my larger image sets without crashing, and I would 
also like to be able to script the process, as well as take advantage of 
Paraview's parallel processing capabilities.

Is it possible to accomplish something like Osirix's 3D reconstructions 
in Paraview?


Thanks,
Steve Huntley

Hi Steve,

I don't know if what you describe can be achieved in Paraview, but actually you can do it easily with VolView [1] (another - bt not open-source - Kitware software).
Volume rendering is a standard technique for visualising X-Ray Computed Tomography data.
If you find out out to do this in Paraview, please share your knowledge!

Cheers

Hi,

I've added a representation to display feature edges but I can't get it to
work for all datasets (it is missing for image and unstructured data).  It
seems that when another representation is added specifically for a type of
data set (e.g. volume for unstructured, or slice and volume for image data)
it loses all the extra representations from plugins - unless I'm doing
something wrong....  The same happens for the example representation plugin
that comes with ParaView.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,
paul

By "added specifically for a type" I was referring to how ParaView adds a
volume representation for unstructured dataset (and volume and slice for an
image dataset).  I would like my representation to be available for all
datasets.

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] python and *.vtk
Message-ID: <236172.58566.qm@web24902.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi once again,

I still haven't achieve to open the *.vtk file with a python script. I tried 
mainly two different ways:

1. Has you said, with the OpenDataFile command. But I get the error below, as it 
could not read *.vtk file.

#Python script
from paraview.simple import *
reader = OpenDataFile("C:/Documents and 
Settings/Nit@/Escritorio/pet/out1-1.vtk")
Show(reader)
Render()
##########

#error on the python shell
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 
3.8.0\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\simple.py", line 115, in OpenDataFile
reader = globals()[xml_name](FileName=filename, **extraArgs)
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView 
3.8.0\lib\paraview-3.8\paraview\simple.py", line 542, in CreateObject
setattr(px, param, params[param])
File "C:\Archivos de programa\ParaView

"to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute FileName does not exist.  This class does not allow 
addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use add_attribute() 
if you really want to add this attribute.##########

Do someone know what should I change or what 's wrong?

2. I searched for a specific vtk reader and I found in internet 
(https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/VTK_in_Python) the following solution and 
getting the following error:

#python script
from vtk import *;
reader = vtkDataSetReader()
reader.SetFileName("out1-1.vtk")
Show(reader4)
Render()
###########

#error on the python shell
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named vtk
###########

I download the vtk source http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html and 
installed the latest verion for Windows. If I had not understood bad I made what 
was necessary (https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/Getting_Started_with_VTK).
But still doesn't recognize the vtk library. Does someone know what's wrong? or 
how paraview could recognize the vtk library?

Thanks you for advance and sorry for the inconviniences. 

Llapis

The difference is due to vtkSMRenderViewProxy::CreateDefaultRepresentation
returning either an UnstructuredGridRepresentation for unstructured data,
UniformGridRepresentation for image data and GeometryRepresentation for
other datasets.  The representations from the plugins only appear with the
GeometryRepresentation.  Do you know how to fix this?

Thanks,
Paul

So you must have an <Extension > element for "GeometryRepresentation"
in your plugin. You need to add <Extension > elements for
"UniformGridRepresentation" and "UnstructuredGridRepresentation" as
well.

There's a bug in 3.8.0 in OpenDataFile() which will be fixed in 3.8.1
(already fixed in release branch). Use the attached script as a
sample. It has a newer fixed version of OpenDataFile().

The second sample you used was incorrect since you are mixing
VTK-python  scripting with ParaView's python scripting.

I've just copied the Extension tag for each and it seems to work - is there
a better way than to Copy & Paste for each?

Thanks,

Not currently. However you can try to keep the copy-pasted code
minimal by using a separate definition for your representation as done
in  the example on wiki.

Hi,

After correcting the problem with my representation for different datatypes
I was reminded of this problem - I never did get a solution.  I tried again
today and by exposing the ambient color property as diffuse color I still
get a warning message but I also noticed that it also stops the diffuse
color working for objects that should use this property.  Can you think of a
way to get this work?  Or could you give me a few pointers on implementing
your second option?:

Thanks,
Paul

Steve,

Your approach is correct.  I don't know why you are seeing what you describe.  How are you coloring your data?

According to the Paraview FAQ, Paraview supports volume rendering of
image data.  But despite searching the Web and buying the Paraview book,
I have not been able to find any detailed descriptions of this feature,
let alone directions for or examples of how to do it.

I have several image stacks in png format which represent slices of
3-dimensional objects.  I can convert an image stack into a vtk file and
open the file in Paraview, but after that I'm at a loss.  Is it possible
to do a volume rendering and end up with a photorealistic image of the
reconstructed 3D object?

After opening the vtk file created from the image stack and choosing
volume representation, all I see is a black block.  The black is
evidently the background image area surrounding my 3D object.  I would
like to make the black transparent and thus reveal the object, but it
seems to me that creating a custom color scale to control opacity would
result in color mapping and interpolation which would destroy much of
the original color in my image.  Is there a way to declare a single
color transparent without affecting the other colors in the image?  Is
this a valid way to pursue volume rendering of image data?

Up to now I have been using Osirix to reconstruct 3D objects from stacks
of slices and do photorealistic renderings of them.  But Osirix has not
been able to handle my larger image sets without crashing, and I would
also like to be able to script the process, as well as take advantage of
Paraview's parallel processing capabilities.

Is it possible to accomplish something like Osirix's 3D reconstructions
in Paraview?


Thanks,
Steve Huntley

Hi Adriano,

I wouldn't be surprised if the Tecplot reader has limitations,
including the ability to read cell-centered data. I'd suggest taking a
look at the source code to find out. If it is the case, it shouldn't
be too hard to add this functionality. Are you interested in giving it
a shot?

Subject: [Paraview]  Reading several Tecplot files at a time
Message-ID: <4C403E9D.6010806@onera.fr>

Hello, all.

I have a multi-block geometry described by many Tecplot files, one 
Tecplot file for each block (myfile001.tp, myfile002.tp...). Of course, 
I can copy the mono-block files into one Tecplot multi-block file before 
running Paraview, but the data may be huge (more than 300 file for 2 Gb) 
and I need enough disk space for the copy. So I would like to load all 
these mono-block files in Paraview with one interaction and get the the 
full geometry into one Multi-Block dataset.

Using the GUI to open the files, if I select in the browser the generic 
name "myfiles...tp" in the line beginning with the + sign, only the 
first file 'myfile001.tp' is loaded, and if I select the + sign to see 
all files, I can select only one file at a time.

I tried also the embedded Python shell. The "TecplotReader" is available 
and expects several files because it must be used with the "FileNames" 
keyword ending with an "s". Loading one file works:

 >>> reader = TecplotReader(FileNames='myfile001.tp')
 >>> Show(reader)
 >>> Render()

Trying with two file names fails:
 >>> reader = TecplotReader(FileNames='myfile001.tp','myfile002.tp')

File "<console>", line 1

SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg (<console>, line 1)


Finally, trying a generic name gives no error:
 >>> reader = TecplotReader(FileNames='myfile*.tp')
 >>> Show(reader)
 >>> Render()

But there is nothing in the 3D window, and the object inspector shows NA 
for number of cells, points...

I browsed the PV 3.8.0 sources but I could not find anything related to 
"TecplotReader" in the available py files. I can find only the c++ file 
for this reader, but this does not help me. Does anyone know what is the 
Python TecplotReader syntax to load multiple files?

Best regards.

This is an interesting challenge. Currently, there is no way of having a reader
load multiple files as multiple blocks. You can do time series but not blocks.
The following would have achieved that:

>>> reader = TecplotReader(FileNames=['myfile001.tp','myfile002.tp'])

There is a (slightly hackish) way of achieving what you want. Try the
following script:

from paraview import servermanager as sm
readers = []
for i in range(300):
    r = sm.sources.TecplotReader()
    r.FileNames = "<full path>/myfile%d.tp" % tp
    readers.append(r)
g = GroupDatasets()
g.Input = readers
Show(g)

Ignore the resulting errors. What I did here is to use the low level
ParaView Python API to create 300 readers but not show them in
the GUI. I then used the group filter to create multi-block from all
of them. This will probably be somewhat slow to execute and also
you won't be able to save a working state out of this.

Make sure to adjust the line that sets the filename. My code
would create filenames like myfile1.tp, myfile10.tp. You'll need
some extra logic to add the leading zeros in indices.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualizing data from the client computer
Message-ID: <AANLkTikrKfcprXJwYXh58hDEg2Ooe476boyn04qyOLlY@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a C++ based application, and I'm using ParaView to do
visualization. A key criterion for choosing ParaView was its ability
to load data that lives on a remote server. Now I have a different
visualization workflow that I need to support: the data all lives
locally in memory on the client. Since I'm already using ParaView for
other visualization purposes, I'd like to use it for this new workflow
as well.

So essentially, I have a vtkDataObject sitting in memory on the
client. Is there a way to push that data into ParaView? Or should I
just use VTK directly on the client?

One other question: is any of the new InfoVis stuff in VTK planned on
being exposed in ParaView? If not, how hard would it be for me to do
this myself?

Thanks,
Ben

I am trying to visualize an MHD flow, but the data I have, say for a cell,
is u, v, and w velocities.  I want to combine these to make a glyph and then
streamlines.  As of now, I can only plot one at a time and they are always
in one direction (the x direction).  I am thinking this is an easy fix!

Is there anyway that one could export the snapshot pictures in vector format
in Paraview?
Do we need to add a plug-in to paraview?
I have a xml (vtr) dataset and need a lot of snapshops preferably in eps

Sure.  Where should I send it?

In the meantime, is there a place on the web that gives examples of how

Up to now I have been working with version 3.2.  I just installed 
version 3.8 to see if there were any differences in behavior.

In version 3.8 I'm not allowed to do volume rendering at all.  When I 
try to set the "Volume" representation option (which resulted in display 
of a black block in 3.2), I now get an error message that says "Cannot 
volume render since no point (or cell) data available."

Has the volume-rendering-of-image-data feature been excised from version 
3.8?

Hi Mohamad,

That's a question that has come up earlier.
Summarizing it is possible to get vector graphics postscript output from 
ParaView, but it is not straight forward, you'll have to compile ParaView 
yourself and there are shortcomings.

You'll find the following thread helpful:
http://markmail.org/message/crk24ma2g7zeuhrl

Please also see the shortcomings of relying on vtkGL2PSExporter (with respect to 
text sources aka labels) in the notes of a feature request that's been made a 
few years ago:

Steve,

Try this:
* Create Wavelet source
* Hit Apply
* Then choose "Volume" from the representation combo.

That's an example of volume rendering of image data.

How let's see what's missing with your data so that it cannot be
volume rendered.
Look at the information tab. Do you see any single component
point-scalars? Mostly not. ParaView only supports volume rendering of
image data with single component point scalars.

Nope.  ParaView is just telling you that the current operation is not supported.

Probably the best course of action is to submit a feature request to ParaView's bug list (http://www.paraview.org/Bug) to which you can attach an example file.  I would also recommend entering the feature in uservoice (http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general).  The ParaView developers use this site to determine the priority of suggested features.

If you have an example data set that is not too big, you can email it to the mailing list or directly to me and I can do these for you.

Subject: [Paraview] calculation in a temporal dataset..
Message-ID: <AANLkTikUhtceURV4kn7YXOb3chyH8P_E1Yzqj1fw6_IZ@mail.gmail.com>

HI,
I am trying to calculate spatial correlation in a dataset of 1000 .vtk files
numbered 1-1000

Here is what the calculation should be..

For each image of that 1000 files, i need to multiply the value of a
selected cell in an image to every cell in that image. the selected cell for
each image is the same, however the value may be different.

then I need to calculate the average of this calculation.

I have saved the images as .vtk file in ascii format. I tried to find some
documents for reading .vtk files in ascii format from matlab, but couldn't
find any.

Could anybody please help as I am very new to paraview.

Regards,
Vishwa

Subject: [Paraview] How to do volume rendering of image data?

Attached is a small sample vtk file that illustrates the problem. It is 
a rough representation of a human molar composed originally of 13 jpeg 
image slices, processed into a raw file with ImageJ, then saved to vtk 
by Paraview.

When I open the file in Paraview 3.2 I see a black block when I choose 
volume representation. The information tab describes it as a uniform 
rectilinear grid and shows number of points and cells, just like the 
info tab of the sample wavelet object described by Utkarsh does.

When I open it in Paraview 3.8, the statistics entries in the 
information tab are blank, and when I try to choose volume 
representation I get the error mentioned below.

Utkarsh, I'm not sure what you mean by "single component point scalars." 
Does this mean that color images with three scalar RGB values per grid 
node can't be volume rendered? If so, does that mean that what I'm 
currently attempting is impossible in Paraview? Or is there a way to 
hack RGB color information into single-value scalars and render a color 
3D image?

Just to mention that I was a bit disappointed
when my copy of The Paraview Guide book arrived.

The book is dated 2007, and, judging by the
screen shots in text, it's version 3.2.0.

Compared to 3.2.8, quite a few menus have
changed, see Object inspector, names of
sources in the Pipeline browser, Color Scale
Editor, etc. It's hard to follow the tutorials.

Are there any plans to publish a more up
to date version?

Is this

	http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial

the most up to date tutorial?

many thanks

Thank you Berk for this useful script.

I had just to modify this line:

r.FileNames = "<full path>/myfile%d.tp" % tp

In fact, it must end with "% i" which is the index of the loop, not with 
"% tp".
And finally a remark: before building the Tecplot files names, it must 
be kept in mind that the index of the loop starts from 0, not from 1.

I first tried this script with only three files (myfile0.tp, myfile1.tp, 
myfile2.tp). I get many Warning messages from the Proxy manager, but it 
works. The geometry is not visible after running the script, although it 
contains the Show command and the "eye" in the pipeline is not greyed, 
but it becomes visible when I select the "Reset" button in the Toolbar.
All I have to do now is simply to rename my 300 files that actually 
don't have following numbers inside their name.

Thanks again.

Richard.

I tried a hackish solution to my problem by hand-crafting a version of 
my vtk file which moved all the rgb data to a lookup table, and 
converted the COLOR_SCALARS data set to a SCALARS set whose values are 
indexes into the lookup table.  I set the opacity of each color to 1.0, 
except black which was set to 0.0.  This in theory (as I currently 
understand it) should have given me what I want.

The file opens in ParaView without error; however, it appears that the 
lookup table is simply ignored, and the default color mapping is used 
instead.

The custom vtk file is attached, in case anyone cares to take a look at 
it and tell me if there's problem which causes ParaView to ignore the 
lookup values, or if the behavior in this case is a bug.

Thanks,
Steve H.

Yes we are starting to work on the new book and online/in tool user's
manual and hope to have them ready between 3.10 and 3.12(or 4.0 as the
case may be).

Also, yes, that tutorial is the most up to date.

I run PV 3.8-rc on linux 2.6.18-164.6.1.el5 x86_64 via ssh -X.

I run X server on FreeBSD 9.0-current amd64.

Closing any PV pop up window, or the main PV window crashes X.

I understand this could be nothing to do with PV,
but could this be related to this GLX bug:
	http://cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=10621 ?

Looking at xdm coredump, I see this line:
	#7  0x0000000802256a4b in DrawableGone ()
	from /usr/local/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so

I asked in FBSD mailing lists, but no advice so far.

Please comment/advise

I don't think this could be related to BUG #10621. You would have seen
the crash on startup, rather than closing a window, if it was due to
the issue in BUG #10621.

Vishwa,

I'm not familiar with that particular calculation.  ParaView does come with a "Temporal Statistics" filter that will compute the average of each point and cell value over time, which looks like about half of the calculation you want to perform.

The simplest way I can think of to complete the operation would be to use the programmable filter to multiple the value in one cell with the rest of the cell values.  (Anyone else on the list know of an easier way?)  If you are already familiar with VTK, this should be little trouble.

HI,
I am trying to calculate spatial correlation in a dataset of 1000 .vtk files numbered 1-1000

Here is what the calculation should be..

For each image of that 1000 files, i need to multiply the value of a selected cell in an image to every cell in that image. the selected cell for each image is the same, however the value may be different.

then I need to calculate the average of this calculation.

I have saved the images as .vtk file in ascii format. I tried to find some documents for reading .vtk files in ascii format from matlab, but couldn't find any.

Could anybody please help as I am very new to paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] How to do volume rendering of image data?
In-Reply-To: <4C42BEAD.1040206@xhuntley.net>
Message-ID: <C869E132.40A5%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The data you sent has RGB values but no alpha values that I can see.  Volume rendering is generally not very useful if you do not have some representation of opacity.  If you were to assume a homogeneous opacity, you would get a mostly black box with a blob of color in the middle if you looked hard enough.  How exactly you expect the volume renderer to behave?

Attached is a small sample vtk file that illustrates the problem. It is
a rough representation of a human molar composed originally of 13 jpeg
image slices, processed into a raw file with ImageJ, then saved to vtk
by Paraview.

When I open the file in Paraview 3.2 I see a black block when I choose
volume representation. The information tab describes it as a uniform
rectilinear grid and shows number of points and cells, just like the
info tab of the sample wavelet object described by Utkarsh does.

When I open it in Paraview 3.8, the statistics entries in the
information tab are blank, and when I try to choose volume
representation I get the error mentioned below.

Utkarsh, I'm not sure what you mean by "single component point scalars."
Does this mean that color images with three scalar RGB values per grid
node can't be volume rendered? If so, does that mean that what I'm
currently attempting is impossible in Paraview? Or is there a way to
hack RGB color information into single-value scalars and render a color
3D image?

I'm not sure I understand the question.  You should be able to create mesh 2 by running mesh 1 through the Tetrahedralize filter.  After that you visualize it like any other mesh.

The alpha values are in the lookup table.  Each line in the lookup table 
has four values: red, green, blue, opacity.  That's my understanding of 
a properly formatted lookup table in a vtk file.  I used: 
http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf as a reference.

All opacity values are set to 1.0, except black which is set to 0.0.  
But when the file is opened in ParaView and volume representation 
chosen, it appears that not only the opacity values but the entire 
lookup table is ignored.

Assuming homogeneous opacity is the furthest thing from what I want.  I 
want to find a way to control opacity without destroying the colors in 
my image data file via mapping to the default color scale.  Getting away 
from homogeneous opacity is what I can't figure out how to do.  I want 
to see through the black background pixels to see the full color pixels 
of my 3D object.

I clicked the Tetrahedrize filter. This creates mesh 2 or at least it 
does something. information shows that mesh1 and mesh 2 have the same 
number of vertices.
I want mesh 2 to be a finer mesh than mesh 1. What am I doing wrong? or 
stated differently, can one refine a mesh using PV?

Unfortunately you can't rotate images in ParaView. However, is this a
png or something like that? In that case, you can create a Plane
(Sources | Plane), transform it to the location/orientation you want,
then from the display tab, load the the image as a texture using
"Apply Texture" combo-box.

Message-ID: <CE2FC9C461BAB942B0ED268009C8497C0124D806@exchange17.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Hi,

 

I am attempting to create a data source based on a
vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm.  Eventually I would like to represent the
grid in a hexahedron format
http://vtk.1045678.n5.nabble.com/Creating-a-structured-grid-of-250x250-c
ells-is-causing-MS-runtime-to-throw-an-exception-td1250336.html. While I
have been able to get this example running in vtk using the python API,
my Paraview plugin source does not work. 

 

I have the same problem attempting to write a plugin source using a
simpler example from the vtk guide:
http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/Examples/DataMa
nipulation/Cxx/SGrid.cxx?root=VTK&content-type=text/plain. According to
the information tab in Paraview, I have zero points and zero cells,
although debugging the datasource shows that for my vtkStructuredGrid
output, the points and cells have been created.

 

Can anyone spot what I might be doing, and suggest how I might fix the
problem (see below).

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Owen

Hi to all

Recently I installed paraview in my debian system (3.2.2).  I have a large
number of .vtu files, (spheres and facets).  When i try to open all all
sheres together using paraview only the first one is coming.   But in the
manual it is mentioned that a group of files can be opened together.   Why
is this?

Also I want to create a video using these frames (Each frame contains sphere
and facet).   Please help me...

thanks

Unfortunately ParaView only has one-dimensional transfer functions
(and it doesn't handle opacity encoded in the alpha channel directly
all that well either). Please add this as a feature request.

More details for the curious:

We do one-dimensional transfer functions like so:

  rgba' = f(value)

Where value is either a scalar (or a component or magnitude of a
vector to reduce it to a scalar)

You want a two dimensional transfer function. Specifically this very basic one:

  rgb' = rgb, and a' = f(rgb)

Where f is a function of the magnitude of the rgb vector. We can't do
that because rgb and a can't be controlled independently within
ParaView.

The closest hack I could get to doing what you want is:

Apply this python filter to calculate a' = f(rgb):
pdi = self.GetInput().GetPointData()
colors = pdi.GetArray(0)
newcolors = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
newcolors.SetName("newcolors")
newcolors.SetNumberOfComponents(4)
for i in xrange(0,colors.GetNumberOfTuples()):
  r,g,b = colors.GetTuple3(i)
  o = sqrt(r*r+g*g+b*b)
  newcolors.InsertNextTuple4(r,g,b,o)
pdo = self.GetOutput().GetPointData()
pdo.AddArray(newcolors)
pdo.SetScalars(newcolors)

(Note: producing o as an independent array lets you threshold to get
rid of the blank space in another way, but you still can't produce
rgb' = rgb in the volume rendering of that.)

Then use the slice representation and turn off map and interpolate
scalars to show the directly encoded alpha channel as opacity.

To fake volume rendering I applied the calculator filter then
repeatedly to produce multiple slices. When you look through (in the
right direction) you get a fake volume rendering effect. If you look
the wrong direction alpha blending doesn't work right.

I think ParaView is assuming that the files you're trying to open are from a
time series.  This usually happens when the files are named like file1.vtu,
file2.vtu,...  There are the vcr controls to animate if that's what you want
to do.  Otherwise if you want all of the files loaded such that you can view
them simultaneously you'll I think you'll need to open each one of them
separately.

Uh, what lookup table?  The data file you posted has no LOOKUP_TABLE entry.  Even if it did, the VTK format specifies that the LOOKUP_TABLE is applied to a SCALARS entry whereas the molar.vtk file has data stored as COLOR_SCALARS.  Even if the RGB values were listed under a SCALARS entry (which is an error in itself), the lookup table cannot be applied to a vector.  VTK specifically defines a lookup table as something that converts scalars to colors.  I'm not sure what the interface would look like for a lookup table that operated on vectors in either the VTK API or in a GUI.

As David DeMarle suggested in a separate email, it makes more sense to derive an alpha field and apply it to the color data.  I'm still not sure ParaView supports directly volume rendering RGBA color values (the majority use case is to analyze general scalar fields), but perhaps it should.

All opacity values are set to 1.0, except black which is set to 0.0.
But when the file is opened in ParaView and volume representation
chosen, it appears that not only the opacity values but the entire
lookup table is ignored.

Assuming homogeneous opacity is the furthest thing from what I want.  I
want to find a way to control opacity without destroying the colors in
my image data file via mapping to the default color scale.  Getting away
from homogeneous opacity is what I can't figure out how to do.  I want
to see through the black background pixels to see the full color pixels
of my 3D object.

The Tetrahedralize filter simply turns all the cells into simplicies (triangles and tetrahedra).  All the simplicies use the same points as the original cells, so the points are passed through and the cells are regenerated.  You should see more cells if some got divided.

It sounds like you want a smoothing or subdivision filter.  There are at least a couple of those available for surface geometry.  I don't see anything for 3D polyhedra.

I clicked the Tetrahedrize filter. This creates mesh 2 or at least it
does something. information shows that mesh1 and mesh 2 have the same
number of vertices.
I want mesh 2 to be a finer mesh than mesh 1. What am I doing wrong? or

Subject: [Paraview] unresponsive Pause?
Message-ID: <20100721.113833.136463433.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

One thing that's been annoying me a bit about recent ParaView (3.8 and
git head) on OS X 10.6.4, Qt-4.6.3 (x86-64) is that when I'm playing
animations with somewhat heavy datasets (around > 1 million cells in
structured / unstructured grids), it overruns 5 - 6 steps until it
stops playing when the Pause button on the VCR toolbar was hit.

I vaguely remember this annoyance started with transition of Qt
version to either 4.5 or 4.6 (I believe it was fine at least until Qt
4.3 / PV 3.6). Also, if I add 5 - 6 processEvents() calls in
pqVCRController::onTick() as attached below (kind of silly though),
the GUI becomes back responsive.

Is it only me who is having this problem? Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Takuya

I guess there was a communication problem. It seems you're still looking 
at the first file I attached in an earlier message: molar.vtk. I created 
a new file with the lookup table called molar.look.vtk and attached it 
to the later message that discusses lookup tables and opacity.

Ya exactly, the files are sphere1.vtu, facet1.vtu etc.  I want to make
sphere1.vtu and facet1.vtu in to one frame,  that at time t=0, then
sphere2.vtu and facet2.vtu in to a second frame, which is at the next time
step etc.  and finally i want to make it as a continuous animation.   Is it
possible?

Even if i want to open each one separately (one sphere and one facet and
save as png file using Tools->Record Test Screenshots),  is it possible to
code this task, may be using python, and execute in paraview?

thanks

thanks, I found it now. It's just in the object inspector - transformation and putting -90 at orientation for the corresponding axis.  

Thanks a lot,
Natalie

Hi Adam,

As of 3.8 ParaView has a Flash reader. You should be able to open a Flash
file (File->Open) and process it like any other dataset. See the ParaView Wiki,
specially the tutorials, for more information. We have not tested the reader
thoroughly so if you run into problems please report it back.

Best,
-berk

I'm not sure the of the best solution but the way that I would do it is to
use the python shell (under Tools menu) and then go to trace (on the
right).  Trace will keep track of your actions between starting and ending
the trace.  With the trace started:
1) open both sphere1.vtu and facet1.vtu and create the image that you want.

2) go to File->Save Screenshot to save the image
3) end the trace
4) save the trace and modify the resulting python script to loop over your
time steps for both file reading and writing (you may also need to get rid
of any previous pipeline information by deleting the appropriate objects)
5) run the modified script with pvpython

Folks,

If you are going to be in the LA area this weekend, for SIGGRAPH 2010
possibly, you may want to check out the Web3D 2010 Conference that's
co-located with SIGGRAPH (July 24-25). I will be presenting a talk at the
Scientific Visualization with Web3D workshop on Saturday. The workshop
aims at highlighting recent technological advances in using Web3D and
other web technologies for end user visualization of simulation
results. My talk will be focusing on the ParaView's Web Visualization
platform that, as some of you may already know, Kitware is actively
developing.

Details about the workshops are at:
http://web3d.org/conferences/web3d2010/workshops

Additional information about the conference can be found at:

Hang on a second.  It looks like the nature of your question changed.  First, you said you had numbered file series (file1.vtu, file2.vtu,...) that did not represent a time series that you wanted all loaded at once.  Now you are saying you have two file series (sphere1.vtu, sphere2.vtu,... and facet1.vtu, facet2.vtu,...) that represent time series.

ParaView should automatically understand each set of files as its own time series.  Simple load up sphere..vtu and then facet..vtu with two separate open commands.  Then hit play to see the time series or save animation to write out an entire image series.

Oh, I see now.  I don't think this approach is going to work either.  First of all, ParaView ignores the LOOKUP_TABLE defined in VTK file.  It is an old feature that is rarely used anymore (the more recent VTK files don't support it), and it conflicts with ParaView's management of lookup tables.  Even if ParaView accepted it, it would probably cause serious problems.  The VTK classes are not prepared for lookup tables with this many values and are liable to fail in rather interesting ways.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikrnkwNHYBnZWsublXDd7aL1L1AQhd0Rq4FuS8h@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to build plugins against the latest version of ParaView (git
master) on windows and it is failing with:

    NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make
"D:\paraview\bin\vtkWrapClientServer"

I built ParaView ok with nmake on the command line but now my plugins aren't
building.  Can anyone think of a reason for this?  (Note: the same
CMakeLists.txt that I use to build on linux and it did work before on
windows - although it's been a while...)

Thanks in advance,
Paul

On FreeBSD 9.0-current ia64, PV 3.8.0 gives
this message on opening can.ex2 (supplied with the tutorial):

3. Numbers are missing from Save animation dialog,
and cannot be input:

When I try to save animation, (hit enter as there is no OK button)
 PV crashes with:

Subject: [Paraview] No interpolation of colors possible (table-to-points
	result)
Message-ID: <4C477C09.6070400@gmx.de>

  Hi,

I'm quite new to Paraview and have an urgent problem. I employed the 
help that was/is available to me - meaning 
http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/ - but couldn't solve the problem 
until now. Actually, I don't consider my problem to be really 
complicated, it might well be that the solution is one mouse-click away.

APPROACH
-->  a dataset (CSV-file) of a three dimensional tomography was imported 
into Paraview
-->  'table to points'-filter was performed, using the x-,y- and 
z-values (latter are negative) of my dataset (first three columns)
-->  'colour by...': the fourth data column with the resistivity values 
was chosen
-|-> finally I wanted the colors to be interpolated between the points.


PROBLEM: I can't perform the color interpolation.

In the wiki there's a small picture showing the color section with the 
option 'color by...'. Above this dropdown-list you can see 'interpolate 
colors"
being activated.

http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/Display.html

In my case, there is no such thing, instead the option ist named 
'interpolate scalars'. In addition to that, in my display there's a 
second (smaller and empty) dropdown-list next to 'color by...' and an 
option called 'apply texture: none' (grey).


Many thanks in advance if you can help me! (unfortunately I can only 
answer tomorrow and then not until next monday, 26th July)

Someone else may come up with a better answer, but here goes.

What you are doing is reading in point data, and displaying this point data in 3d space.  You have not created a solid for ParaView to color - just points.

I believe what you want to do is actually create a solid.  This can be done using the "table to structured grid filter".  Turns out that I had this question from a user earlier today, and wrote up a quick and dirty wiki page on it, located here:  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Data_formats

-->  'table to points'-filter was performed, using the x-,y- and z-values (latter are negative) of my dataset (first three columns)
-->  'colour by...': the fourth data column with the resistivity values was chosen
-|-> finally I wanted the colors to be interpolated between the points.


PROBLEM: I can't perform the color interpolation.

In the wiki there's a small picture showing the color section with the option 'color by...'. Above this dropdown-list you can see 'interpolate colors"
being activated.

http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/Display.html

In my case, there is no such thing, instead the option ist named 'interpolate scalars'. In addition to that, in my display there's a second (smaller and empty) dropdown-list next to 'color by...' and an option called 'apply texture: none' (grey).


Many thanks in advance if you can help me! (unfortunately I can only answer tomorrow and then not until next monday, 26th July)

Message-ID: <ABD1B5752A0D724F9E100C97EA9EB7E15CE57573EB@exvic-mbx04.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi,

I am having trouble compiling the Manta source code itself under windows (XP, VS2008). Has anyone else tried this? The problem is on the line:

Model/AmbientLights/.svn/text-base/AmbientOcclusion.cc.svn-base:68:    pair<float, float> sortedSamples[num_directions];

Has anyone else got Manta and also the Manta Plugin for Paraview to work on this platform?

Cheers,
Ray

Subject: [Paraview] Time-series of raw files
Message-ID: <9C40DE87-88B0-4548-87A3-E436B7E6EF47@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to load a time series of raw files into Paraview (v.3.8.0 on MacOS). It's from the HURRICANE_ISABEL dataset (on Teragrid, and IEEE Vis04 dataset).
The loader seems to understand that's a series (it shows all the files grouped into one).

But once loaded, I don't seem to get any time steps (the inspector doesn't show any). If I create an iso-surface with the dataset and hit play, I get no animation.
I tried to play with the "file prefix" and "file pattern" string without difference (it loads fine, but not time series).

If I load individual time steps, everything is fine.

Do I have to create a XDMF file to describe the time series, or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks,


...Luc...

THAT is a file internal to subversion... You probably mean D:\Manta_src\Manta\Model\AmbientLights\AmbientOcclusion.cc.

And since this is an error in the Manta source code, why don't you ask the Manta mailing list (manta at sci.utah.edu).

In short no, it doesn't build in visual studio.

We spent a day or two trying to get it to build with shared libraries
but could not. We estimate it would take a couple of days more to
finish the modifications to manta that are necessary. Expect a summary
of where we were going with that on the manta mailing list.

Hi Luc,

It is very likely that the raw data reader does not support time
series. Where can
we get this dataset to try? Some of us have TeraGrid access if that makes a
difference.

The table to structured grid filter only works if your csv file actually represents a 2D or 3D array.  If your points have no implied topology, you can impose one by running the Delaunay 3D filter.

Someone else may come up with a better answer, but here goes.

What you are doing is reading in point data, and displaying this point data in 3d space.  You have not created a solid for ParaView to color - just points.

I believe what you want to do is actually create a solid. This can be done using the "table to structured grid filter". Turns out that I had this question from a user earlier today, and wrote up a quick and dirty wiki page on it, located here:  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Data_formats

Hi,

I'm quite new to Paraview and have an urgent problem. I employed the help that was/is available to me - meaning http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/ - but couldn't solve the problem until now. Actually, I don't consider my problem to be really complicated, it might well be that the solution is one mouse-click away.

I work with STL files, and I note that the reference files for STL (available here : http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/stla/stla.html) are not rendered with ParaView Linux 3.8.0 (RC1). They are well rendered with ParaView Windows 3.8.0. Is it a a real problem or did I make a mistake when installing PV on Linux ?

Hi

I actually switched to Visual Studio makefiles which removed the error about
not knowing how to make "D:\scratch\win32\paraview\bin\vtkWrapClientServer"
(and I did have other issues too...).  Now I am trying to go back to using
nmake and the problem is back.  I have tried building the example filter
that comes with ParaView in a separate location? I added the following to
the top of the CMakeLists.txt:

8<------------------------------------------------------------------
CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.6)
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

Hi,

I used a few time-steps from the precipitation series. On Teragrid:
    /home/ux454089.teragrid/tgViz/DATA/HURRICANE_ISABEL

Or online:
   http://www.vets.ucar.edu/vg/isabeldata/PRECIPf01.bin.gz
   http://www.vets.ucar.edu/vg/isabeldata/PRECIPf02.bin.gz
   http://www.vets.ucar.edu/vg/isabeldata/PRECIPf03.bin.gz
   ...

Basically, each time step is 500x500x100 (0,499 0,499 0,99) in float, big-endian. I renamed the .bin files to .raw for Paraview to recognize them, starting with a 0 index (if it matters).

Thanks

Ok, I've found the problem and it seems to be with the way cmake is
generating the build.make file.  If I manually add the .exe onto the end of
vtkWrapClientServer in the build.make file it will run the program and then
I also need to do the same for kwProcessXML too.

Any idea how to fix this?  I'm not sure whether it is a fault with a cmake
file or my setup.... Is anyone else building plugins outside of the ParaView
source using nmake on windows?

Thanks,
Paul

Hi all I fin the solution, thanks for mpi community.

The comand whe need to launch pvserver in tiled display mode using openmpi

have a tiled dislpay of 4x3 screens):

$ mpirun --leave-session-attached --hostfile myHostFile -np 12 pvserver
-tdx=4 -tdy=3

I hope it is helpful to someone else.

  First of, thanks for your quick help!

In fact, the 'table to points' filter was the problem. I was misled by 
the 'interpolate colors' option shown in the help (that I couldn't 
find). I performed the 'table to structured grid' filter with the 
extents filled in correctly (that was the problem when I tried this 
filter on my own) and it delivered the result I expected!

Thanks again,
Sven

That is strange. I am not seeing any changes to that reader between RC1 and

Hi Gustavo,

(forwarding to the mailing list, this might interest others.)

This issue has been solved in paraview 8.1 : see bug # 10277

Now, the python interface to create animations has been slightly modified, 
please follow the instructions available at 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting (last ?)

Best,

Hi Stephane,

I'm  running into the same problem you experienced here:

http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg04236.html

I have a sequence of ply files that I want to animated whether with 
Paraview or to make them Pictures and use another software, did you manage 
how to solve this issue with paraview?

Thanks in advance,

Hi,

There are no error messages in the 'output window'. PV do not crash. I just see nothing in the render view.
Furthermore, with Paraview Linux 3.2.2, STL files are rendered.
We have tried with the final build : STL files are not rendered in ParaView 3.8.0 on Linux.?

Does anyone has encountered that problem on Linux ? (my stl files are available here : http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/stla/stla.html)

Subject: [Paraview] Using ParaView with 3D TV
Message-ID: <7BB5ABA6-A33F-4D91-866D-D424A13017E3@kit.edu>

Hey there,

did anybody ever try to use ParaView with one of these newly available 3D Televisions?

I use ParaView's stereo mode to visualize 3D heart models on 2009 iMac.
I was wondering if it wouldn't be a cheap way for full-color stereo mode to just buy a 3D TV and hook it up to a computer (not necessarily a Mac) which has ParaView running in stereo mode.

So my questions can be broken down to a few shorter questions:
 1. Do you think that is possible? 
 2. Does anyone have an idea how I need to connect the computer and the 3D TV? 
 3. Do I need HDMI connection or can I just pass the VGA signal? 
 4. Which ParaView stereo-mode do I need to use?

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best,
 Martin

We've got a version running on these at UNC.  We plan to put out an 
easy "Howto" on this soon.  There is a 1-line change needed to the 
Paraview source code to make this happen.

We've found that the WIndows 7 drivers work with both Samsung and 
Acer displays, the Windows XP drivers did not work with the Acer.  We 
also found that DVI connections work but Displaylink do not (even 
with the double-speed converter).

If you would like a copy of this before we release the description, 
contact me directly.

Thanks,
Russ

Subject: [Paraview] Data selection with tiled-display
Message-ID: <48F286C8-ED0D-4922-85AB-E128916CA22B@uq.edu.au>

We have paraview 3.8.0. running in a tiled display (20x pvserver  
instances to make a 4x5 display). In general, everything works as  
expected. However while working through the tutorial  
(ParaViewTutorial38.pdf) I found that exercise 2.18 (selection of  
cells or points with the mouse) causes all the pvserver instances to  
crash. There's no informative error message, just something along the  
lines that failure of rank #n caused a shutdown.

This seems to be a problem only in tiled display mode. If I change to  
client/server mode with just a single pvserver (either remote or  
localhost), the data selection works fine. Its a problem only in tiled  
display mode. All other tutorial exercises work fine.


Could anyone confirm that the data selection functionality as per the  
tutorial is (or isn't) working for them with paraview 3.8.0 on a tiled  
display please?


chris


P.S. I'm running SLackware 13.0 with mpich2-1.2.1p1 and  
paraview-3.8.0. The display cluster consists of 5 machines, each  
driving 4x 1920x1200 LCD's i.e. 4x pvserver instances per machine

Hi Ray,
cc'ing pv list so other may find it useful.

Yes I have a ParaView install on Peiades. SGI MPT worked the best of the 
implementation I tried on pleiades. I used the intel compilers for PV 
and my local OS Mesa build. I am attaching my configure script from 
which you may get an idea of what I did.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem loading plugin in Python ...
Message-ID: <4C4ED2E7.9090402@DLR.de>

  Hi,

i try to use the SurfaceLIC in combination with python. Running the 
SurfaceLIC from the GUI it works fine (only when use the 185.18.31 
Nvidia-driver, with newer drivers it crashes).

Now i use this script to run the stuff in batch (means pyton) mode:


from paraview.servermanager import *

Connect()
LoadPlugin("/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.8/libSurfaceLIC.so", 
False)
LoadState("alvlic.pvsm")
view = GetRenderView()
view.WriteImage("test.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 1)


In this case i get the error:


AUSW_AUTOMATIC_NEW/SURFACE_P_LIC> 
/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8_build/ParaView-3.8.0_bin/bin/pvbatch make_pv_pic.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "make_pv_pic.py", line 4, in <module>
     
LoadPlugin("/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.8/libSurfaceLIC.so", 
False)
   File 
"/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8_build/ParaView-3.8.0_bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 2116, in LoadPlugin
     LoadXML(f.read())
   File 
"/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8_build/ParaView-3.8.0_bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 2085, in LoadXML
     if not parser.Parse(xmlstring):
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)


I tried to modify the LoadPlugin line giving two arguments - but does 
not help. What is wrong here?

Best regards and thanks in advance...

That is correct. Selection on tile-displays isn't supported yet.

Utkarsh,

Is it a known bug to crash the server?  I tried a tiled display locally on my desktop, and although the selection did not work in that it selected the wrong elements, the rest of the system still behaved correctly afterwards.  Can you replicate the crash of pvserver?

Hi everyone

this is most probably a very simple question for a lot of you, so I would
appreciate some guideline:
I would like to define a new reader for paraview so I can read a file
extension that I think paraview can't currently read. what are some
guidelines to do this. I have a module that can read the file extension how
can I incorporate it in to paraview and then how can I make the view port to
show it? I am trying to make the paraview read the nii file extension. I am
using C++ as a programming language here. any help is really appreciated.


Kind Regards

I would like to volume render RGBA data derived from digital photographs of serial slices through an object. I found reference on the vtkusers list of this being supported in vtk (vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper or vtkVolumeTextureMapper3D). I created a legacy vtk file with data represented as STRUCTURED_POINTS. Here is the top of the file:

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
TreeVol
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 1023 1023 10
SPACING    1 1 10
ORIGIN     0 0 0
POINT_DATA 10465290
SCALARS DiscRGBA unsigned_char 4
LOOKUP_TABLE default
255 254 236 0
255 254 236 0

255 254 236 0
255 254 236 0
255 254 236 0
255 254 236 0
255 254 236 0
255 254 236 0
255 254 236 0

The file loads without errors, selecting Representation = Slice, Map Scalars = Off shows a single slice in correct RGBA.
But when I select Representation = Volume I get the following error:

Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data available.

What am I doing wrong? Is volume rendering of RGBA not supported in Paraview? Although I see the Volume Mapper box (greyed out) says Fixed point which indicates vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper which I understood would handle RGBA. Or is my file format wrong?

It looks like the nii file is a NifTI file type which there is a plugin for
the reader.  If you go to Tools->Plugin Manager you can select the NifTI
reader and choose Load Selected to the load the plugin.  Then you should be
able to read in the file without any extra work.

If that doesn't work you can check out the paraview wiki information about
plugins at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView#Plugins for information on
creating your own plugin reader.

On a related note: I have a reader that would be useful to contribute to
VTK/paraview. How simple/complex should the test files be for future

Subject: [Paraview] Problem loading plugin in Python ...
Message-ID: <4C4FBF1D.1060307@DLR.de>

  Hi,

just for information: Problem solved - i mixed up the prebuild RC2 and a 
RC2 compiled by myself - so the LoadPlugin simply cannot find the plugin 
in lib-format and then trys to load instead an xml-plugin ...

Best regards,

     Stefan



Hi,

i try to use the SurfaceLIC in combination with python. Running the 
SurfaceLIC from the GUI it works fine (only when use the 185.18.31 
Nvidia-driver, with newer drivers it crashes).

Now i use this script to run the stuff in batch (means pyton) mode:


from paraview.servermanager import *

Connect()
LoadPlugin("/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.8/libSurfaceLIC.so", 
False)
LoadState("alvlic.pvsm")
view = GetRenderView()
view.WriteImage("test.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 1)


In this case i get the error:


AUSW_AUTOMATIC_NEW/SURFACE_P_LIC> 
/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8_build/ParaView-3.8.0_bin/bin/pvbatch make_pv_pic.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "make_pv_pic.py", line 4, in <module>
     
LoadPlugin("/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.8/libSurfaceLIC.so", 
False)
   File 
"/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8_build/ParaView-3.8.0_bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 2116, in LoadPlugin
     LoadXML(f.read())
   File 
"/opt/PARAVIEW_3_8_build/ParaView-3.8.0_bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 2085, in LoadXML
     if not parser.Parse(xmlstring):
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)


I tried to modify the LoadPlugin line giving two arguments - but does 
not help. What is wrong here?

Best regards and thanks in advance...

Hello,
when loading vtu in PV under Client(Win)/Serveur(Linux) mode,
we get unregular messages "The data array in the element may be too short."
We found that this occur when values (Float32) are below 1.0000e-45.
ie PV Loads correctly when all values are bigger than 1.0000e-45 and 
warns with "The data array in the element may be too short." when at 
least one value is below 1.0000e-46.

Is it a bug ?

Hi,

 

I have put together various plugin datasources based on
vtkStructuredGrid and vtkUnstructuredGrids. I now need to provide some
way of visualizing 4D data for my vtkStructuredGrid datasources. Is it
possible to provide the fourth dimension along the time axes? Has anyone
done this, and does it involve generating new vtkStructuredGrids for
each time increment?

 

Thanks,

 

Owen

Unfortunately, currently you have to do it manually. However, with
3.10 we plan to provide a python API to size/resize windows which will
make this easier.

You need to build with shared libraries in order to load plugins dynamically.

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A194D306D435B@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

I'm experimenting with the coProcessing library. It's very nice. Well done you guys.

Question : I have a Fortran code generating a slab of data (volume, actually a rectilinear grid, but for now I'll be happy with a volume).

I can send the data into the adaptor and generate datasets, all is well. On a single process all seems to be normal, but before I start on lots of cores .....

The data is divided among processes such that I need to worry about whole extents, and piece extents.

Can I export individual image data (rectilinear grid) pieces from each process, set the extent locally and let the usual paraview pipeline handle it. Normally (in a reader) I'd be getting piece numbers and all that and I'm not sure if this will be transparent or not.

The Phasta (I think) example, uses a multiblcok structure, which I'd prefer to avoid. a Multipiece dataset is fine...is there a volume example anywhere?

Thanks

JB

Hi John,

I'd like to think it works but as I haven't tested it to do that I'm not
going to promise that it works :)  It uses a TrivialProducer to insert the
data set/composite data set into the pipeline with the idea that
coprocessing should essentially execute almost exactly the same as any
corresponding paraview python script for pvbatch.

Since you're asking about it though I'll try to look at it this week and get
back to you.  If you get to it sooner than I do and find a bug then I'd also
be more than happy to try and fix it.

Andy

Actually, I think there is an issue with structured extents.  The problem with structured extents is that ParaView/VTK will ask for a particular extent on each process, and these extents are not likely to match up with what is actually available on that process.  It situation is stupid because the extents are picked arbitrarily, and everyone would be happy with the extents available from the FORTRAN code, but there is no way for the CoProcessing library to force the pipeline to accept certain extents.

The only way around the problem right now that I know of is to place the data in a multiblock structure like AMR.

Since you're asking about it though I'll try to look at it this week and get back to you.  If you get to it sooner than I do and find a bug then I'd also be more than happy to try and fix it.

Question : I have a Fortran code generating a slab of data (volume, actually a rectilinear grid, but for now I'll be happy with a volume).

I can send the data into the adaptor and generate datasets, all is well. On a single process all seems to be normal, but before I start on lots of cores .....

The data is divided among processes such that I need to worry about whole extents, and piece extents.

Can I export individual image data (rectilinear grid) pieces from each process, set the extent locally and let the usual paraview pipeline handle it. Normally (in a reader) I'd be getting piece numbers and all that and I'm not sure if this will be transparent or not.

The Phasta (I think) example, uses a multiblcok structure, which I'd prefer to avoid. a Multipiece dataset is fine...is there a volume example anywhere?

Thanks

To clarify, by manually Utkarsh means that you need to use the mouse to adjust the 1/2,1/4,1/4 splits to be about 1/3,1/3,1/3.  There is no way to make three equal splits automatically.

I remember discussing grid type splits during developer meetings way back when.  Ultimately, we just left it with single splits because it had a nice clean GUI and seems to satisfy user needs well enough.  If you disagree and think lots of people would like multiple or grid-like splits, then you should add the suggestion to ParaView's UserVoice page (go to http://paraview.org and then click on the blue "Tell us what you think" button in the upper right).  If lots of people agree and vote for it, it will get implemented.

Rick,

Any reason why you are using Qt 4.5? The official Qt version  for
ParaView 3.8 is Qt 4.6.

Actually,  surprisingly there is.  You do it as follows (for example , for vertical splits):

Split Vertical
Split Vertical
Split Vertical for the lower window.

You now have 4 equal sized windows.
Delete the bottom window.

You now have 3 equally sized windows.

Basically, yes, you will write your data out in time slices.  However, you can also advertise time in the reader and VTK/ParaView can request particular time slices.

To do this, add vtkInformationDoubleVectorKey::TIME_STEPS() and vtkInformationDoubleVectorKey::TIME_RANGE() key/value pairs to the output information object during the RequestInformation call.  Then, in RequestData, look for vtkInformationDoubleVectorKey::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() in the output information and use the value to load the requested time slice into the output.

To get ParaView to recognize the time, you also need to add this magical property into the XML for your reader proxy:

   <DoubleVectorProperty name="TimestepValues"
                          repeatable="1"
                          information_only="1">
      <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
    </DoubleVectorProperty>

This will alert ParaView to read the time steps reported from RequestInformation and set up the animation and related GUI elements.

Hi,

I have put together various plugin datasources based on vtkStructuredGrid and vtkUnstructuredGrids. I now need to provide some way of visualizing 4D data for my vtkStructuredGrid datasources. Is it possible to provide the fourth dimension along the time axes? Has anyone done this, and does it involve generating new vtkStructuredGrids for each time increment?

Thanks,

Can you try setting the environment variable PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG=1 before
running pvpython and then post the generated output. Looks like
ParaView wasn't able to load the shared library for some reason.

Subject: [Paraview] mouse interaction when scripting python
Message-ID: <359951.90832.qm@web29109.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Dear all,
I started with a simple python scripting example as described in this paragraph:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Rendering

Unfortunately I don't see any possibility to interact with the render window 
using the mouse (to rotate the camera, zoom, pan, ...) as I did before in C++:

...
// an interactor
vtkRenderWindowInteractor *iren = vtkRenderWindowInteractor::New();
iren->SetRenderWindow(renWin);
// add actors
ren1->AddActor(...);
// render an image
renWin->Render();
// begin mouse interaction
iren->Start();

Is it possible to use mouse interaction in combination with python scripting?

Thanks
Lars

Hi Lars,

Currently it is not possible with paraview-python.  But you can make it work
using vtk-python (which looks very similar to your c++ example.)  See  this
email:

Hold on a minute. Everything you said is quite right and I'm with you 100% - Except. Suppose the pipeline places piece numbers in each update request - which are converted to structured extents (can't remember exactly where in the executive this will happen, but it will somewhere) - then the reader (or in this case coprocessing library) produces pieces of data which in our case, will not be the right pieces. We set the extents accordingly on out imagedata and just past the results out. When the pipeline downstream receives all these pieces, it will probably ignore the updateextent that was requested and use the real extent on the actual dataobjects. No? yes?

It might work. Anyway. I'll try out some pieces and see what gives. Ideally the coprocessing library will need a way of modifying the extents. I'll see if there's a way of managing it. (I'll also see what the TableExtentTranslator thingy does, though it may be the reverse of what we want).

We had a vague plan at some point to allow filters to set some kind of piece manipulator on the executive for load balancing on transient data where the topology features are in one place and skip loading other bits. I'll think about this some more.

Would like to avoid this. Did vtkMultiPieceDataSet ever get worked on?

thanks for thought provoking feedback

Paraview python scripting has the concept of active objects and active
views.  At the python console, type 'help(Show)' and you'll see that it
takes optional object and view arguments.  If the arguments are not
specified it uses the 'active' object and view.  When you create a view
(CreateRenderView()) or create an object (Sphere()) they become the active
objects.  The active object concept is explained on the python scripting
wiki page.

Also, it should be noted that if you issue these commands from the Python Shell in the ParaView GUI, the visualization gets built in the ParaView GUI and you can then use the mouse to interact with its views as usual.

Hi,

I originally tried the following on each piece:

SetOrigin(0,0,0)
SetSpacing(.1,.1,0)
SetExtent(0,xmax,ystart(myproc),ystop(myproc),0,0)

And when I output it to XMLPImageDataWriter, paraview couldn't read it complaining about the extents.  It actually correctly showed the first piece.

I could have sworn I talked to Utkarsh about it, but I can't find the conversation... So it's quite possible there's a serious operator error on my part.

The current solution is in Paraview under CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/NPICAdaptor  That solution creates a MultiBlockDataSet with one block (on each processor) which contains the image.

Nathan.

In parallel structured data reader can only provide fixed structured
extents on each processor (ie each gets a slab file and can't read
other files), it can make up a table saying what processor provides
what extents, assign that to a vtkTableExtentTranslator, and then
replace the default extent translator it gets with the new one.
Afterward the pipeline won't ask it to produce data outside of what it
announced.

Thanks. I think the vtkTableExtentTranslator is the right one for the job. I can instantiate one in the adaptor - or the pythoin script, and use the mpi_rank from the simulation to setup the extents table. What will be the hard part is forcing the pipeline to use it in the glue between the coprocessing and simulation.

I'll play with this approach and also the multi-block, and post back to the list if I discover anything useful.

I have 2 3D unstructured mesh with vectors.
I would like to view only the components in a x-y plane.
If I used the glyph2 , I get 3D vectors. How can I set the Vector-Z = 0?
Thanks in advance,

p.s.
I used the calculator to set
vec2d-x = velocity_x
vec2d-y = velocity_y
but how can I get glyph2 to use the vec2d-x and vec2d-y arrays?
Hope my question is clear.

Use the following expression instead in your calculator to generate a
vector with Z component =0

velocity_X*iHat+velocity_Y*jHat

Subject: [Paraview] Fwd: Re: crashes in loading vtu in pvserver/client mode
Message-ID: <4C51A638.5050605@scconsultants.com>

Hello,

when loading vtu in PV under Client(Win)/Serveur(Linux) mode,
we get unregular messages "The data array in the element may be too short."

*We found that this occur when values (Float32**) **are below 1.0000e-45.*
ie :  PV Loads correctly when all values are bigger than 1.0000e-45 and 
warns with "The data array in the element may be too short." when at 
least one value is below 1.0000e-46.

It works fine in local mode for any value.

Should I post a bug ?

The test file to be read in shouldn't be too large so that the test actually
completes fairly quickly.  My best recommendation is to see how other
readers are being test.  What type of output does your reader produce?

I have a time series dataset and the geometry moves over time.  Is there 
a way to make the geometry so that it remains centered in the display 
window?   I want to keep the view centered on a part centroid, for 
instance.   Otherwise, the object moves off of the screen over time .....

It produces an UnstructuredGrid.
Actually it's here if you're interested in taking a look:
http://github.com/olesenm/VTK/blob/custom/IO/vtkProStarReader.h
http://github.com/olesenm/VTK/blob/custom/IO/vtkProStarReader.cxx

The xml layer is still on the Paraview side of things though:
http://github.com/olesenm/ParaView/blob/custom/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml


I can easily whip up some small test files with various cell shapes
(tet, polyhedral) etc, but I'm not not actually sure how this is
supposed to be used to check that reader is working correctly.

I would like to get it integrated though into paraview/vtk though.
For CFD geometries (not results), it's a fairly simple, robust,
ASCII-based format that covers all (linear) 2/3-D cell types.

There is still no good way to do this in the UI. Please file a feature
request. I don't see any reason why this can't be made automatic in
the GUI.

In the meantime, the path I am thinking that one might do this at the
user level is to select the point/cell you want to follow, plot that
over time. Then via python you would extract the coordinates from that
plot and use them to set up camera keyframes.

Check the mailing list too, this has been discussed fairly recently
and there might have been a better solution. I can't seem to track
down the conversation for some reason though.

Rick/Dave,
This has been reported as feature 6625, and frankly, would be REALLY NICE to have implemented.

Hi,
I'm getting the same error after installing from source 
(also the Linux-x86_64 version). This is odd because I 
indicated not to build the gui, although a previous build 
in which I did build the gui caused the same error.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug: Failure to open FLASH file on a PowerBook
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1007291552440.7781@flash.uchicago.edu>

Hi,

I have just installed ParaView 3.8.0 on a PowerBook G4 (Mac OS X 10.4.11).

On opening a FLASH file, I get the output message:

Generic Warning: In 
/Users/partyd/Dashboards/MyTests/ParaView-3-8-0/ParaView/Servers/Filters/vtkFlashReader.cxx, 
line 764
Inconsistency in the number of blocks.

After that, the Object Inspector shows no useful information about the 
file (other than Filename and Path).

I gave Dave DeMarle a copy of the same file, he was able to successfully 
open it on his laptop.  He thinks the problem is caused by the different 
byte ordering on PowerPC.  This should be easy to fix since the underlying
file format of the FLASH format is HDF5.

Subject: [Paraview] CSV Data using extra fields.
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=bNv14_G+V-vms1MhREb_qCL9UWNHti2CwxKZK@mail.gmail.com>

I have a file that looks like this:
x y z r g b px py

-2.064749 -1.623789 5.264024 254 254 254 5.000000 7.000000

-1.401535 -1.134097 3.676532 201 201 201 5.000000 14.000000

-1.420374 -1.154109 3.741410 179 179 179 5.000000 15.000000

...

In ParaVew, I use the inbuilt CSV reader and get a table of labelled columns.
In order tot get the points, I use a TableToPoints filter.
The output of this filter is a table consisting of r,g,b, px, py,
points, point ID.
This plots OK in 3D.

How can I transform the r, g, b arrays into a vtkUnsignedCharArray in
order to add colour information to the points?
I have been trying to use a programmable filter but don't seem to be
able to access the r, g, b components.
Also will the other components of the array be passed through, namely
(points, and px, py)? Ultimately I want to create a 2d image of the
px, py and colours.



Any help appreciated.

Thanks
   Andrew

Hi,

I'd like to know that Paraview can set color to the vector arrows
defined at cell-center of CVs.
I have a CFD data (lagacy unstructured VTK format) only supplying the
cell-centerd velocity components like below,
but can not choose color of the velocity arrows from "Color by" menu
in the Display panel.
(Only "Solid Color" and "cellNormals" are available in case of the
Glyph type "Arrow")

Hi Rick,

I remember working with someone from Army to write a Python
"observer" to do this. Was that you? I can dig up that code if you
want...

Something like the code below should work for the programmable filter.  Note
that this assumes the input and output are polydata.

  pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()

pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

pdo.SetPoints(pdi.GetPoints())

np = pdo.GetNumberOfPoints()

a = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()

a.SetNumberOfComponents(3)

a.SetNumberOfTuples(np)

a.SetName("color")

r = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("r")

g = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("g")

b = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("b")

for i in range(np):

a.SetValue(i*3, r.GetValue(i))

a.SetValue(i*3+1, g.GetValue(i))

a.SetValue(i*3+2, b.GetValue(i))


pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(a)

Hi Mark,

I can help you get your reader integrated into VTK/ParaView.  I think the
test should at least have a cell of each type that you want to import into
VTK as well as point data and cell data if it has cell data with an array
with both 1 and 3 components.  I would think that a single test should be
sufficient if it covers all of this.  The important thing is that if people
make changes to the reader that we are at least able to verify that it still
is able to read in your test grid.

Mind posting the whole file, and I can take a look?  I wonder if this is a form of bug that I have run into.

Subject: [Paraview] Coloring of cell-centered vectors

Hi,

I'd like to know that Paraview can set color to the vector arrows
defined at cell-center of CVs.
I have a CFD data (lagacy unstructured VTK format) only supplying the
cell-centerd velocity components like below,
but can not choose color of the velocity arrows from "Color by" menu
in the Display panel.
(Only "Solid Color" and "cellNormals" are available in case of the
Glyph type "Arrow")

Try applying the Cell Centers filter before applying Glyph.

Subject: [Paraview] How to replace data in a pipeline source with new data?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikyKRis6XjZnEvnSktxL8b6igA9EkMPBrdiJbCa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am loading a volume using:
       reader = builder->createReader(QString("internal_sources"),
QString("XMLImageDataReaderCore"), files, server);
after creating a view and representation for the volume. I need to access
the volume data and change it.  I am using the following to access the
volume data:

  vtkSMProxyManager *pm = vtkSMObject::GetProxyManager();

  rep =
vtkSMClientDeliveryRepresentationProxy::SafeDownCast(pm->NewProxy("representations","ClientDeliveryRepresentation"));

  rep->AddInput((vtkSMSourceProxy*)proxy, "DONTCARE");
  rep->SetReductionType(1);
  rep->UpdateVTKObjects();
  rep->Update();

  currVolume = (vtkImageData*)(rep->GetOutput());

Once I have the data as a vtkImageData, I use
  currVolume->SetScalarComponentFromFloat(i, j, k, 0, value);

to set the data.  This is a very slow way to access the data.  I also tried:
  float* pixel = static_cast<float*> (currVolume->GetScalarPointer(i,j,k));
  pixel[0] = value;

this is faster, but I would like to create an array, fill it with new data
(without accessing ImageData) and then use it to replace the array stored
within the ImageData without having to iterate.

Is there a better way to do this with paraview objects?

Any input is appreciated
Thanks!!

Subject: [Paraview] HDF5 files with time dimension & ParaView
Message-ID: <000301cb3016$d43fdd00$7cbf9700$@cam.ac.uk>

Greetings ParaView Users,

I am currently running simulations using MEEP (
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Meep ), which generates output files
in HDF5 format. Opening HDF5 3-dimensional files works ok with ParaView (it
is recognized as Pixie 1.0 - I normally convert these files to VTK for
convenience). However, MEEP can also generate 4-D HDF5 files, where the
fourth dimension is time. Is there a way to view such files in ParaView and
navigate along the time axis? 
Thank you in advance :-)

Subject: [Paraview] Trouble loading Ensight/Gold data
Message-ID: <4C533062.10408@us.army.mil>

I have an EnSight/Gold case file that I'm able to read into a couple of 
other vis packages with no problem.  When I load the case file into 
Parview 3.6.2/3.8.0/3.9.x I don't get one of the scalar files loaded.   
(The scalar happens to be pressure).     There are no error messages 
from the client or server, ParaView just ignores this particular scalar 
value. 

When I load the case file,  the variable shows up in the properties 
window.  I select "Pressure",   and all of his friends like Temp, 
Velocity, etc,  select APPLY, and then look in the information tab.  
"Pressure" is not listed.     This Case file happens to have many 
timesteps defined, so I changed it to only load one timestep - same 
behavior.    I selected the first timestep, the last one, and many in 
the middle, same behavior.   And of course, "Pressure" happens to be the 
variable of interest!   8-)

I must be missing something really easy.   Unfortunately, I can't share 
this data for debugging purposes.

Sounds strange.  I'm not that familiar with the EnSight/Gold file format but
wonder if somehow the array doesn't have the same number of tuples as there
are points/cells in the grid for point data/cell data.  Does it show up in
the spreadsheet view?  Maybe in the field data?

Our data is in the EnSight-Gold file format and we haven't encountered any
problems with 3.8.  Have you tried the ensight format checkers
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-March/016356.html?

You could also try replacing one of the files that loads correctly with an
appropriately named pressure file.  I imagine this would tell you if there's
a problem in the pressure file format or in the case file.
