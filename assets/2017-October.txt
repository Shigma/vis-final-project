Hi everyone,
I want to draw a cylinder in ParaView.
its default setting is such that its height is in the y-direction but i
want to change it in z_direction.

I have radius 0.07 m and height 0.3 m in Z direction
plz help me
thanks

Hi,

Unfortunately vtkCylinderSource class doesn't seem to allow you to
change default settings for the axis direction. Hence you should apply
the transform filter after creating a cylinder.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Specific OpenFOAM case crashes the server
Message-ID: <20171002000159.GA23468@avignon>

Dear All,

I have been recently testing remote rendering in paraview and I seem to have
concocted a case which breaks remotely works locally. The case is an OpenFOAM
U-bend simulation and I am happy to share the files. They're about 61MB.

On the remote side I get:

pvserver: /.../viz/ParaView-v5.4.1/VTK/IO/Geometry/vtkOpenFOAMReader.cxx:3798: void vtkFoamEntryValue::ReadList(vtkFoamIOobject&): Assertion `"Label type not set!" && this->GetLabelType() != NO_LABEL_TYPE' failed.

On the local side it looks that I simply get disconnected which makes sense
seeing that the server core dumped.

I tried to remove all weirdness from this case and at the moment it is really
just a tet+quad mesh and some case files. If I open the case directly with the
client everything works.

I am really keen to solve it as when remote viz works, it's absolutely
brilliant. I would appreciate comments. Thanks.


A side note is that looks to me that PV OpenFOAM reader cannot handle
"included" files used by OpenFOAM.

Best wishes,
Robert

Hi Robert,

This sounds intriguing - I wonder if there is something with 32/64-bits involved?

The reader needs a cleanup (https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues/17096), but I'm rather short of personal free time to tackle it (and no funding for it at the moment).

However, even after a cleanup the reader will continue to remain rather fragile with regard to handling various dictionary items, especially things like "#includeEtc" that imply a much deeper knowledge of the OpenFOAM logic than is possible based on the output files alone.  It is for this reason that the "skip zero" switch was added. The intention is to skip over the "0/" fields that contain most of the includes. Subsequent output fields will not normally contain any #include directives.  The only slightly odd output element can be "#{" .. "#}" verbatim strings (associated with user-coding), but the reader should silently skip over these and not cause any problem.

Cheers,
/mark

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewWeb Visualizer black screen
Message-ID: <E9283CEABE3D474B902D8859C0CEA8C35E3535@exchmbx01>

Hello,

I have been trying to set up a ParaViewWeb server on my CentOS 6 machine to run Visualizer. I have gotten to a point where the UI loads correctly but remote rendering only displays a black screen. Not even the axes in the bottom left are displayed. However, if I switch to local rendering mode it works as normal. There are no errors at all in the Apache logs and the session log starts fine but after the twisted server startup and the lines filled with plus signs, I get the lines:

2017-10-02 11:14:48+0100 [_GenericHTTPChannelProtocol,0,127.0.0.1] Client has reconnected, cancelling reaper

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x3e184d0): warning window did not resize in the allotted time

Since it works with local rendering and not remote rendering I feel as though it must be a problem with OpenGL, but running glxinfo shows that the user running the launcher has access to direct rendering.

Any suggestions on what could possibly be going wrong would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Louise

Hi Louise,

I'm wondering how big is the display on the remote server? Even if no
screen is connected, you do need to define a display size which in your
case may be tiny by default?

Otherwise, if you use the nightly binaries or paraview/master, you can
tweak your launcher config to use pvbatch instead of pvpython which
leverage a true offscreen rendering which will be then independent of the
screen resolution. But you will need to set the following environment
variable. PV_ALLOW_BATCH_INTERACTION=1

It might also be something else, but the message "window did not resize"
looked suspicious.

Robert,

A few suggestions:

1. let's see what GL you're getting. If you run the following, what it
the output?
   ....
   pgc104% DISPLAY=:0.0 glxinfo

2. What GPU do you have and which drivers? If it's NVidia with new
enough drivers that support EGL, an EGL-enabled build may be a good
way to circumvent x-server issues.

Hi Eduardo,

That message is indeed the state but only for the proxy object and the VTK
instance underneath. Unfortunately (for you) the state of the
vtkSMSessionProxyManager
is not the whole state of the application. Each state is specific to its
instance.

In order to get the full state of the application you will have to traverse
the tree of objects that compose the application and gather all the states
on the way.

Unfortunately I couldn't find the time to walk through the code to validate
what I'm saying.

Hope this help and sorry I could not get you a better answer or better
pointers on where to look at.

Seb

Hi Louise,

You are right, there is indeed more changes which might not be strait
forward for you to fix. Even if in reality, it is only a bunch of import
path to fix.

Just out of curiosity, did you try to run the command line that the
launcher is running by hand and see if you have the same behavior as well
as maybe other error output?

Otherwise, you right the screen size should be more than enough.

Seb

PS: I've added back the mailing list so others could benefit from our
discussion.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF Version 2 and 3 Differences

Hi Mike.

You mean select the XDMF "Reader", not "Writer" when you open the file
correct?

In theory XDMF3 should read almost anything XDMF2 could. The main practical
differences in my recollection are:

+ xdmf3 doesn't leak memory and is faster and less of a memory hog,
especially with time varying data, in my experience.
+ xdmf3's field data arrays work better and in particular support arbitrary
width arrays
+ Thanks to Michal Habera's Google Summer of Code project xdmf3 master (in
nightly binaries and will appear in PV 5.5) has support for "other"
centered (more than 1 per cell) data in support of FEniCS higher order
cells.
+ xdmf3 has a much better suite of tests and contribution path than xdmf2
ever did

= xdmf3 had a boost dependency up until about a week ago (will appear in PV
5.5).

- xdmf3 tends to complain on files that use default/implied values in the
xml entries.
- xdmf3 doesn't automatically parallelize structured datasets when read in
parallel
- xdmf3 doesn't support strides for structured datasets
- xdfm3 doesn't support "hyperslab, list or range" temporal specifications
- xdmf3 lacks support for function specifications
- xdmf3's notion of subset is slightly different than xdmf2 (2's were
relative to cell, 3's are relative to face/edge or something to that effect)

If you can share one of your files I'll take a look.

thanks

All,

I'm confused about how to write an XML plugin that lets the user select input variables for processing.

Say I want to put up a list of  cell variables and let the user select which ones to process:

I see this:
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Drop_down_list_with_values_from_input_arrays
but it is not clear to me.
My questions include:


  1.  How do I get Cell variables, point variables or field variables - which is the example, or do we always get all 3?
  2.  Within my code, how do I know what variables have been selected by the user from the list?
Thanks for all for any help.

Dennis

Dennis,

Before I answer the question, I need to know what are you adding this
property on? Is this a filter or a reader? The difference is that for a
reader, the information about arrays available is provided by the reader
itself; while for filter, that information is obtained from its input.

All,

To be more exact, I wrote a routine here that does an area-weighted average of some variables.    Now the users are asking if I can give them a list of variables in the model and they can choose which ones to calculate a weighted average.    I can envision a Custom filter where I have a Programmable filter which processes everything, preceded by a Pass Arrays filter  - I could bundle them together and expose the Pass Arrays filter to let them choose which variables they want, but I think the self-contained plug-in which I can add to the site Plugin directory and get automagically loaded at startup is a better way to go if I can just figure out how to do it!

 WARNING - External email; exercise caution.



Dennis,

Before I answer the question, I need to know what are you adding this property on? Is this a filter or a reader? The difference is that for a reader, the information about arrays available is provided by the reader itself; while for filter, that information is obtained from its input.

All,

I?m confused about how to write an XML plugin that lets the user select input variables for processing.

Say I want to put up a list of  cell variables and let the user select which ones to process:

I see this:

but it is not clear to me.
My questions include:


  1.  How do I get Cell variables, point variables or field variables ? which is the example, or do we always get all 3?
  2.  Within my code, how do I know what variables have been selected by the user from the list?
Thanks for all for any help.

Dennis

There are many filters you can base this on. Here are a few examples:

1. https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/filters.xml#L2026-2041

Here the arrays to list is determined by the "InputArrayDomain"
element defined on the InputProperty and fixed to cell data.

2. https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/filters.xml#L13865-13881

Here the user can separately select which attribute he/she is
interested in using a separate "AttributeMode" property.

Hi Joel,

You are right, the Reload feature only applies to the active source
(reader).
As in Python paraview.simple provides a function to reload the files of a
source proxy, you could add the following Python Macro to reload all reader
sources at once:

from paraview.simple import *
for k,v in GetSources().items():

  ReloadFiles(v)

Utkarsh,

So, for the first example we have:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

<InputProperty command="SetInputConnection"                     
name="Input">        
<ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">          
<Group name="sources" />          
<Group name="filters" />        
</ProxyGroupDomain>        
<DataTypeDomain name="input_type">          
<DataType value="vtkDataSet" />        
</DataTypeDomain>        
<InputArrayDomain attribute_type="cell"                          
name="input_array"                          
number_of_components="1" />        
</InputProperty>

I get that the InputTypeDomain links it to cell arrays! - thanks for that.

So, after the user chooses some variables, are the chosen variable names in "input_array"?
Or does "input_array"  contain True or False based on which he chose, in which case where are the corresponding names of the variables?

Thanks

Dennis

Joachim,

Excellent, thank you for that snippet?it worked perfectly.  My thanks also
for correcting my terminology.

Is this something that would merit adding to ParaView's native
functionality (e.g., File -> Reload Files & File -> Reload All Files)?

Best regards,
Joel

When user selects variables, he's doing it on the "VolumeArrays"
property. Thus the selection is provided to the VTK filter via calling
the command specified on the "VolumeArrays" property. In the case of
the ExtractCTHParts files, this is done via `AddVolumeArrayName` and
`RemoveVolumeArrayNames` API.

The message is a warning from the Qt side. Aside from being annoying,
it should be harmless. Sorry, but we haven't figured out why this
appears on some systems and not others.

Does it stop responding or does it crash? It's probably not related to
the warning message above.

FYI it appears if I force the size of the remote rendering window on my
tiling window manager.
Irrelevant in microsoft windows context, but still.

Utkarsh,

I think you have me confused with a real programmer!   ;- )

I am just trying to write a Programmable Filter in python and I'm lost. 
   
I want to write an xml plugin that will put up a list of all the cell variables and let the user select from then and then have the names of those variables available in my python script within the Programmable Filter.    I'm hoping this can be similar to plugins I have written with hardcoded variable names where I've used something like:

Properties = dict(
  Sector_Angle = True)


def RequestData():


   def process_block(block):
      #
      #
      if (Sector_Angle):

Maybe this isn't possible at this low level, but how would I put up the list and then what would I have in my RequestData script that I could branch on.

Thanks for your patience.

Dennis

When user selects variables, he's doing it on the "VolumeArrays"
property. Thus the selection is provided to the VTK filter via calling the command specified on the "VolumeArrays" property. In the case of the ExtractCTHParts files, this is done via `AddVolumeArrayName` and `RemoveVolumeArrayNames` API.

Dennis,

Oops sorry, it slipped my mind you were doing this for programmable
filter. It should be doable, but I'll need to dig -- don't remember of
the top of my head. I'll put it on my plate to put together a small
example for you.

My comment provide a reliable way to obtain the error you see, but I'm
afraid it is not related to your problem, at least not directly.

Subject: [Paraview] 100% CPU usage once again
Message-ID: <5e3911d6-fce7-4c4e-bed0-2730bc482e28@rwthex-w3-b.rwth-ad.de>

Dear ParaView developer,

in [1] you say
> If you have information on disabling the busy wait using a different MPI
> implementation, please contribute back by documenting it here.

Here we go.

a)
It is possible to build 'pvserver' using Intel MPI (and GCC compilers).
By setting I_MPI_WAIT_MODE  environment variable to 'enable' value you can
effectively prevent busy waiting, see [2] p.10 (Tested with Intel MPI
5.1(.3.181)).

Q/FR.1 Could you please provide a version of 'pvserver' build using Intel MPI in
official release of ParaView? [4]



b)
It is (obviously) possible to build 'pvserver' using MPICH (and GCC compilers).
Itself, MPICH can be *configured* with '--with-device=ch3:sock' option. This is
described to be 'slower' as '--with-device=ch3:nemesis'
For our experiments it turned out, that 'pvserver' compiled and linked using
MPICH with 'ch3:sock' configure option did not have the busy waiting aka
100%-CPU behaviour.
Note that this is *configure-time of MPI library* parameter.


(Tested with MPICH  3.2)

Q/FR.2 Could you please provide a version of 'pvserver' build using MPICH
*configured with '--with-device=ch3:sock' option* in official release of
ParaView? [4]
This binary will be very likely be even compatible with 'standard' MPICH
installations; we're able to start it even with IntelMPI's 'mpiexec' with
success and no busy waiting. However YES you will need to have a MPICH release
be build




c)
It is possible to build 'pvserver' using Open MPI (and GCC compilers).
In [1] you document how-to 'turn off' the busy waiting behaviour in Open MPI
(cf. [5],[6]).
Unfortunately this *did not work* in our environment (InfiniBand QDR and Intel
OmniPath clusters, OpenMPI 1.10.4).
Note that likely we're not alone, cf. [7].
Note that the switch likely just move the spinning location from MPI library
itself to the fabrics library (cf. the screenshots, without 'mpi_yield_when_idle
1' (=default) the 'pvserver' processes spin with 'green' aka user 100%, and with
'mpi_yield_when_idle 1' the processes stays spinning but now with a lot of 'red'
aka kernel time portion.

Conclusion: the way to disable busy waiting for Open MPI which is documented in
[1], is not useful for us. We do not know this is a speciality of our site or a
general issue; we think some survey at this point could be useful.

Q/FR.3 In case you should want to provide precompiled versions ov 'pvserver' for
Open MPI, remember that there are ABI changes in major version changes. So you
would likely need to compile+link *three* versions of 'pvserver' with Open MPI
1.10.x (still default in Linux), 2.x (current), 3.x (new).



d) In [10] there is a phrase about how-to disable busy waiting on yet another
two MPI implementaions,
> ... IBM MPI has the MP_WAIT_MODE and
> the SUPER-UX MPI/XS library has MPISUSPEND to choose the waiting mode,
> either polling or sleeping.

Somebody with access to there MPIs could evaluate this, maybe.

Have a nice day,

If it stops responding consistently after a specific event or sequence of
events, please let us know. It shouldn't do that :-)

I suspect that you do not have any cells in your 3-point data.vtk file.
Without cells, there is nothing for ParaView to visualize. This is a common
stumbling block for people trying to visualize point data.I suggest after
loading your data applying a Glyph filter. It should show you three spheres
colored according to your resistivity array. Now you should be able to
apply the Threshold and Slice filters as you would expect.

Cory,

The Glyph works just fine with my data.vtk and is very useful tool! It was
a good advice.

As to not-responding and freezing of ParaView: let me accumulate statistics
and then I will let you know.

I appreciate your help,

Sonya Davydycheva

Subject: [Paraview] Question about modify data in VTK files
Message-ID: <81A18720EB4BBA489B6552676D14533C67C26906@chimbx4.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi,

I have a question about modify the data in vtk files and then visualize them again in Paraview.

First, I have 118 vtk files which record the information of each time step. In order to process some data in my vtk files, I plan to store them as .CSV files. I saved them as points data files. However, I find that I need to save 118 CSV files and then process the data in each of them. And then I need to visualize each of them.

Because in every time step, I use the same method to modify specific data. I wonder is there a way that I can process all the data just one time so these specific data in every time step will be changed in the same way.

I know calculator works for some simple applications, such as add, minus. However, I might use some if else loops to modify the data. So I need to import the .CSV data into the Matlab to process them. And then import the modified .CSV files into Paraview to visualize the information.

Thanks!

Best,
Teng

Dennis,

Here's a example. You need manually modify the XML generated using
[1]. I've attached script.xml with my modifications to add a new
property for "Arrays".
Also attached a state file that demos this filter (load state after
lading the script.xml as plugin).

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <CAHhX17dc1uk+8DmFp5su0G0SbsM1fj-u0s7QSEOe=JHmyHPNTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a 3D volume (xyz) with each point/cell having a corresponding value
(velocity; this is a model of the crust and seismic velocity).

I want to calculate a 1D average velocity profile along the z-axis (so at
every depth average all the x-y velocity values).

Any idea?

Thanks!

p.s. point data or cell data solutions would work

Utkarsh,

Thanks for that information - I have figured it out now.   A few notes for others who are or will in the future follow this subject:

The object of this exercise is to write a Programmable Filter that will put up a list of your Cell or Point variables and allow the user to select which ones to process at runtime.   Say you wrote a Volume-Average filter which calculates volume-averaged values of variables.   Now you can let your user select which variables to average at runtime- this could be helpful in a number of scenarios.

1.  You need to include at least one property in your .py file, otherwise the translator is unhappy - you can delete it from your .xml file, though, if you don't really want it (I did!)

2.  Make a pretty standard xml plugin .py file and run it through the python_filter_generator to turn your python into an xml plugin

3.  The python_filter_generator knows nothing about the variable arrays so it is strictly a manual mod to the .xml file.   In order to illustrate this, I have included both the .xml originally produced by the python_filter_generator (test.xml.orig), and the hand edited version where I implemented the Cell variable list and deleted the property which I included only to make the translator happy (test.xml).  You can tkdiff these to see exactly what changes were made

3.  The original python_filter_generator had a typo of vtkMultiblockDataSet, while this newest revision correctly has vtkMultiBlockDataSet - use the one in your .py file that matches the version of the generator you are using

I have run this test filter on can2.exo,  a good, simple multi-block dataset that is available to everyone.  Screenshots attached

Hopefully this will help the next guy.

Dennis,

Here's a example. You need manually modify the XML generated using [1]. I've attached script.xml with my modifications to add a new property for "Arrays".
Also attached a state file that demos this filter (load state after lading the script.xml as plugin).

Hope that helps.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating clips for multiple data sets
Message-ID: <CAPGyz25WxJ9_1vNJ9B7pxN6Kyi2EYTPsOwXTs1O0xgMVYchJTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to apply 5 clips to a number of different data sets. I tried
selecting them, right-clicking, pressing Copy, then selecting a different
data set and pressing Paste, but nothing happens. Am I doing something
wrong?

I then tried to record a trace and modify it, but I couldn't figure out how
to create a clip for the currently selected dataset. I see that I need to
specify the clip input like this:

> clip = Clip(Input=<input_name>)

but I would like to create a clip for the currently selected dataset,
without hard-coding its name in the script. Is it possible to do so?

Sorry about the beginner questions, I didn't find the answers in the
manual.
Thanks in advance!

Best regards,
Lev Karatun.

Hi ashton,

Perhaps the python programmable filter is needed for a 1D average you
want to achieve. I have attached a state file as a similar example
that firstly generates the cross sections along the z-axis by cutting
a volume and then calculates the averages on them respectively.

I hope this will help.

Message-ID: <CANMVBVxq6ctxoBpkrsay+TstthBQsw=05x-cmKbniZ-kz6uNmg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.
Some time ago I used the Silhouette filter for ParaView to visualize
geometry edges (not mesh but indeed *geometry* edges). But I've missed the
file and cannot find it for download now... Would, somebody, please, share
this filter or give the download link? As some other people do, I use
ParaView 5.2 as a most recent version compatible with RDP (I don't know if
it's important for the filter compatibility).
Thanks.

Howdy,

Two ideas for you to try. 1) group the data into a multiblock and then clip
the merged result with one clip filter. 2) under the tools menu create
property links between the many clip filters so that whenever one changes
the rest do too.

Hi David,

I actually already saw this advice on the mailing list. The first approach
doesn't work in my case because I want to be able to see the results of
each individual data sets clipped, which seems to be impossible which this
approach (unless I'm doing something wrong).

Approach 2 is not much faster or easier than creating the clips manually.

Best regards,
Lev Karatun.

With approach 1, you might use the multiblock inspector panel to turn
on/off the visibility of and of the objects.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView not reading time in netcdf file
Message-ID: <E4B49D53-DE50-4F58-AD2D-9BEC008C08E7@uwaterloo.ca>

Hi,

I have a netcdf file which I?d like to read in ParaView. The reading and rendering works fine, but the time is not displayed. I?ve declared the variable to be time through the axis attribute, and I?ve given it units since a certain day. Strangely enough, VisIt understands the time value (t=5s) while ParaView does not.

Here?s the output from ncdump:

netcdf output_50 {
dimensions:
	x = 1024 ;
	z = 128 ;
	time = 1 ;
variables:
	double x(x) ;
		x:units = "m" ;
	double z(z) ;
		z:units = "m" ;
	double time(time) ;
		time:units = "seconds since 2001-1-1" ;
		time:axis = "T" ;
		time:long_name = "time" ;
	double rho(time, x, z) ;
		rho:units = "kg/L" ;

// global attributes:
		:description = "SPINS Output 50" ;
}

Any help will be appreciated. I also have a 1 MB file which I can pass on if needed.

Thank you,
David

You can do similar things simply using Python and numpy, instead of matlab.
Numpy is included in the Python distributed with ParaView, so you can use
it in pvpython or Python shell in the GUI to open csv [1] and process it
add appropriate before saving out.

Hi,

I have a question about modify the data in vtk files and then visualize them again in Paraview.

First, I have 118 vtk files which record the information of each time step. In order to process some data in my vtk files, I plan to store them as .CSV files. I saved them as points data files. However, I find that I need to save 118 CSV files and then process the data in each of them. And then I need to visualize each of them.

Because in every time step, I use the same method to modify specific data. I wonder is there a way that I can process all the data just one time so these specific data in every time step will be changed in the same way.

I know calculator works for some simple applications, such as add, minus. However, I might use some if else loops to modify the data. So I need to import the .CSV data into the Matlab to process them. And then import the modified .CSV files into Paraview to visualize the information.

Thanks!

Hi,

I think the best way is to use the Gradient of Unstructured DataSet filter
to compute the velocity gradient and then use the Calculator or Python
Calculator filter to compute lambda-2.

Cheers,
Andy

Hello Cory & Paraview team,

I am just giving below a SUMMARY on the errors I encountered while working
with ParaView.

Version 4.0.1 installed on my old (2013) 64-bit Toshiba laptop under
Windows 7: works fine, shows images for model.vtk & glyph for data.vtk;
does not freeze.

Version 5.4.1 just DOES NOT install on my old (2013) Toshiba laptop.

Version 4.0.1 installed on a new (2016) Dell laptop under Windows 7: shows
images for model.vtk & glyph for data.vtk, but freezes while attempting to
do full screen or just to drug the screen edge in order to increase screen
with the following diagnostics:
--------------------
Output messages
QWidget:: repaint: Recursive repaint detected.
---------------------

Version 5.4.1 installed on a 2016 Dell laptop under Windows 7: shows images
for model.vtk, BUT glyph for data.vtk STAYS EMPTY, and the application ALSO
freezes while attempting to do full screen or just to drug the screen edge
in order to increase screen, with no diagnostics.

- - - - - - -
So, for now I have to continue working with version 4.0.1, and it is fine,
so far, for the learning purpose. To prevent freezing, I simply avoid to
increase screen / full screen.

The  version 4.0.1 was my random choice, just the first version I saw
available for 64-bit system.
Would you recommend for me to try any newer version?

Many thanks for your help,

Sonya Davydycheva <http://3demholding.com>

Hi All,

I am looking for some recommendations or running Para View on local hardware, specifically geared to 3d rendering.  Should I be looking at more GPU vs processor vs memory?

Thank you.

That's indeed a bug.  Here's a fix:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1955

For your build of ParaView (assuming you are using 5.4), you can load the
adding XML as a plugin and then create the filter. The XML will override
the builtin definition for the proxy and hence will overcome the issue.

Keith,

There's no easy answer for this, I am afraid. It depends on the type of
data and kind of processing you intend to do. A few things to note:

1. most data processing is done on CPU.
2. rendering, including rendering of image volumes using volume rendering
techniques as well as surface/polygonal rendering uses GPU.

What is the type of data or kinds of processing you plan to do? Maybe that
can help weigh the scale in direction over the other.

Message-ID: <81A18720EB4BBA489B6552676D14533C67C29446@chimbx4.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi all,

I have a question about saving vtk data in a csv file. Please find the following link for the vtk file:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NbGlfTm9odlZpa2M/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NbGlfTm9odlZpa2M/view?usp=sharing

I expected to see 7 components in the csv file I saved: x, y, z, stress_x, stress_y, stress_z, stress_magnitude. However, in the csv file I saved, there are only three columns of data. Please find the csv file I saved:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NeWZnejVqbHEzME0/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NeWZnejVqbHEzME0/view?usp=sharing

I saved the vtk file by first highlighting the vtk file in the pipeline, and then click save data. Then I used the default settings. Is there anything wrong in my saving process?

Thanks!

Best,
Teng

Sonya,

Thanks for the report. Could you try ParaView 5.2 and see if that works or
produces the same problem as 5.4?

Thank you,

Teng,

In your attached VTK file, stress is a cell data i.e. associated with
each of the cells rather than the points. When you export data as CSV
you can only save points along with point data or cells data and not
both. If you want to save out stress associated with each of the
points, you can apply the "Cell Data To Point Data" filter first and
then save the result out.

Teng,

The issue is that your stress field data is associated with the cells and you are writing out the point data in your csv file. Thus, the stress data is not being written. There are two solutions, both with flaws:

Solution 1: When you get the dialog box labeled "Configure Writer (DataSetCSVWriter)" (after you choose a filename), change the option "Field Association" from "Points" to "Cells". If you do this option, you will only get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled "stress:0", "stress:1", and "stress:2"). You will not get the x, y, z information for the placement of the points.

Solution 2: Before writing out the csv file, run the "Cell Data to Point Data" filter. Then write out the csv file with point data as you have been doing. You will get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled "stress:0", "stress:1", and "stress:2") and you will also get the positional x, y, and z (labeled "Points:0", "Points:1", and "Points:2"). The problem with this solution is that it will alter the stress data slightly by averaging values of adjacent cells to points.

Also note that neither of these options will automatically write out the magnitude of the stress. To write out the stress magnitude, first run the "Calculator" filter to compute the magnitude of the stress vectors.

I have a question about saving vtk data in a csv file. Please find the following link for the vtk file:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NbGlfTm9odlZpa2M/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NbGlfTm9odlZpa2M/view?usp=sharing

I expected to see 7 components in the csv file I saved: x, y, z, stress_x, stress_y, stress_z, stress_magnitude. However, in the csv file I saved, there are only three columns of data. Please find the csv file I saved:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NeWZnejVqbHEzME0/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NeWZnejVqbHEzME0/view?usp=sharing

I saved the vtk file by first highlighting the vtk file in the pipeline, and then click save data. Then I used the default settings. Is there anything wrong in my saving process?

Thanks!

Best,
Teng

Sonya,
If nothing else works, use ParaView 4.4.0.  That release is a workhorse, and was the version before we updated OpenGL requirements.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Paraview 5.4.1 error message & freeze

Hello Cory & Paraview team,

I am just giving below a SUMMARY on the errors I encountered while working with ParaView.

Version 4.0.1 installed on my old (2013) 64-bit Toshiba laptop under Windows 7: works fine, shows images for model.vtk & glyph for data.vtk; does not freeze.

Version 5.4.1 just DOES NOT install on my old (2013) Toshiba laptop.

Version 4.0.1 installed on a new (2016) Dell laptop under Windows 7: shows images for model.vtk & glyph for data.vtk, but freezes while attempting to do full screen or just to drug the screen edge in order to increase screen with the following diagnostics:
--------------------
Output messages
QWidget:: repaint: Recursive repaint detected.
---------------------

Version 5.4.1 installed on a 2016 Dell laptop under Windows 7: shows images for model.vtk, BUT glyph for data.vtk STAYS EMPTY, and the application ALSO freezes while attempting to do full screen or just to drug the screen edge in order to increase screen, with no diagnostics.

- - - - - - -
So, for now I have to continue working with version 4.0.1, and it is fine, so far, for the learning purpose. To prevent freezing, I simply avoid to increase screen / full screen.

The  version 4.0.1 was my random choice, just the first version I saw available for 64-bit system.
Would you recommend for me to try any newer version?

Many thanks for your help,

Sonya Davydycheva

Cory,

The Glyph works just fine with my data.vtk and is very useful tool! It was a good advice.

As to not-responding and freezing of ParaView: let me accumulate statistics and then I will let you know.

Thank you Cory,

For your prompt response. Good to know that the message is harmless.

My Paraview 5.4.1 just stops responding sometimes.

If it stops responding consistently after a specific event or sequence of events, please let us know. It shouldn't do that :-)

But, well, I installed on another (older) laptop an older version, 4.0.1 (5.4.1 did not work there), and it does not freeze. So far, I think it is ok for my learning purpose.

Very good.

Both versions (on both computers) allow me to visualize my sample model.vtk file: in RenderView I can do Threshold, Slice and Clip and see some 3D pictures. But something is wrong with my other sample data.vtk file (or, with my approach?). It contains data points (3 coordinates) and the resistivity values assigned to them. When I open it, I can see only the resistivity colorbar, and I can add axes, but the image stays empty.
Threshold does not work at all (and even the colorbar disappears when I apply it).
Slice somewhat works, but it stays gray/empty and does not change as I move it along the box.
And when I am in "Slice" mode, pressing "Apply" removes the colorbar as well, and does not show anything meaningful.

Any idea how can I activate Threshold or Slice for my resistivity data.vtk?

I am beginner and suspect I just miss something simple...
Reading ParaViewGettingStarted-5.4.0.pdf and ParaViewTutorial54.pdf, does not help, so far.

I suspect that you do not have any cells in your 3-point data.vtk file. Without cells, there is nothing for ParaView to visualize. This is a common stumbling block for people trying to visualize point data.I suggest after loading your data applying a Glyph filter. It should show you three spheres colored according to your resistivity array. Now you should be able to apply the Threshold and Slice filters as you would expect.

Thanks,
Cory

Many thanks in advance,

The message is a warning from the Qt side. Aside from being annoying,
it should be harmless. Sorry, but we haven't figured out why this
appears on some systems and not others.

Does it stop responding or does it crash? It's probably not related to
the warning message above.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks!

I have successfully use the "Cell Data To Point Data" filter and save a csv file with all the components I expected to see. 

Actually, I would like to process the three stress component data in the original VTK file. So I choose to save them as the CSV data. However, I have totally 118 time steps, thus 118 VTK files. If I save all of them and process each in the Matlab and finally show back in Paraview, that will be a huge amount of work. So I use python shell to access the data and process them. After some searching, I find some valuable codes:

1. 
>>> a =GetActiveSource()                            # First highlight the stress vtk file in pipeline.
>>> a
<paraview.servermanager.LegacyVTKReader object at 0x0000006D080174E0>
>>> a.UpdatePipeline()
>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)
>>> data_cell = rawData.CELL_DATA_FIELD
>>> data_cell
>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData
>>> data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>
>>> print data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>

As we can see, this code only gives some simple information, not the actual stress data I need to process. I am wondering how I can access the actual data so I can finish all the calculation in Paraview. And since Paraview can read file series, so I can process the data once and change all of them in all the files. 

So my question is how I can get access to the stress data in the vtk file using python shell.

Best,
Teng

Teng,

In your attached VTK file, stress is a cell data i.e. associated with
each of the cells rather than the points. When you export data as CSV
you can only save points along with point data or cells data and not
both. If you want to save out stress associated with each of the
points, you can apply the "Cell Data To Point Data" filter first and
then save the result out.

Teng,

GetCellData is a function. You have to call the function by adding parentheses to the call. Specifically, change

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData

to

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData()

That will return a class from which you can pull the data array for the stress field. (For example, data_cell.GetArray(0).)

Hi Moreland,

Thank you for your detailed explanation and two specific solutions.

In order not to lose the accuracy, I will first try to save the stress data as the point data and then process it.

Also, I am searching ways to process the vtk data directly by using python shell. I have been searching the codes to get access to the real data, here are some codes I have:

>>> a =GetActiveSource()                            # First highlight the stress vtk file in pipeline.
>>> a
<paraview.servermanager.LegacyVTKReader object at 0x0000006D080174E0>
>>> a.UpdatePipeline()
>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)
>>> data_cell = rawData.CELL_DATA_FIELD
>>> data_cell
>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData
>>> data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>
>>> print data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>

However, I just have the data information, not the real stress data I need to process. And there are 118 time steps, thus 118 vtk files of my problem. I hope there is a way to process the data in python shell once and the results in all the files will change accordingly. That means I can process the stress component as the data array and do some calculations. And then save them in the old vtk file and visualize them again. That is the idea in my mind now.

And actually, since the csv file records all the stress data (cell data). If I can just print all the data arrays in the csv file and store them as variables in the python shell, I can process them and save as new csv files.

So actually, my question is how I can print out the data, no matter in the vtk files or the csv files by using python shell.

Best,
Teng

Subject: RE: [Paraview] Saving as csv data
Teng,

The issue is that your stress field data is associated with the cells and you are writing out the point data in your csv file. Thus, the stress data is not being written. There are two solutions, both with flaws:

Solution 1: When you get the dialog box labeled "Configure Writer (DataSetCSVWriter)" (after you choose a filename), change the option "Field Association" from "Points" to "Cells". If you do this option, you will only get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled "stress:0", "stress:1", and "stress:2"). You will not get the x, y, z information for the placement of the points.

Solution 2: Before writing out the csv file, run the "Cell Data to Point Data" filter. Then write out the csv file with point data as you have been doing. You will get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled "stress:0", "stress:1", and "stress:2") and you will also get the positional x, y, and z (labeled "Points:0", "Points:1", and "Points:2"). The problem with this solution is that it will alter the stress data slightly by averaging values of adjacent cells to points.

Also note that neither of these options will automatically write out the magnitude of the stress. To write out the stress magnitude, first run the "Calculator" filter to compute the magnitude of the stress vectors.

Hello list,

I am using real (long - more than 7 digits) geographic coordinates in my project. Unfortunately, with OpenGL 2 they cannot be visualised in ParaView.

Hi dear users,

My question would be about the best practice to animate mode shapes in paraview. I have an initial shape of points (x,y,z coordinates) subjected to different frequencies. There are 493 DoFs and 19 modes. What would be the best way to animate it in paraview and which input file should be used? Thank you!

VTK OpenGL2 uses automatic data normalization (shift/scaling) to handle
large data ranges. So each mapper's data is rescaled/shifted to lie within
the 0.0 to 1.0 range and the camera matrix is modified to account for this.
All that is done in double precision but resulting in floating point data
and matrix.

For most earth centric data sets the normalization works well if your
detailed data (like of a building) is in a different mapper than your large
scale data (model of the earth).

I am not sure if this functionality is in the last PV release, but it
should be in the nightly version. There are still some gotchas in setting
the camera's clipping range (an automatic clipping range that includes the
entire earth will be really bad for a detailed model of a building) but the
basic support is there.

In terms of adding double support it could be done conditionally if the
hardware has it then turn it on. We already do that for a couple OpenGL 3.3
features. But I doubt we will require OpenGL 4 any time soon as moving to
OpenGL 3.2 was a stretch for many people. Having said that, we do typically
get OpenGL 4 contexts on many platforms by default.

Hope some of that helps!
Ken

Subject: [Paraview] Mode shapes
Message-ID: <13596FCB-76CB-453D-B920-F08B3839AA65@sandia.gov>

Doina,

It is possible to make a filter to implement this (a couple readers do it internally), but one with general capabilities currently does not exist. However, it is easy to animate a mode shape using the Warp by Vectors filter and the animation utilities. To do it, do the following:


1.       Add the Warp by Vectors filter to your data. Presumably you have some displacement vectors that you want to do the mode animation on. Select those as the vectors to warp by.

2.       Open the Animation View (View -> Animation View).

3.       Make the animation run longer (the defaults are too fast). Either increase the number of frames (say to 100) or change the mode to Real Time.

4.       Add an animation track for the WarpByVector filter and the parameter Scale Factor.

5.       Double click the animation track you just created to open the Animation Keyframes dialog box.

6.       Double click the box that says Ramp in the Interpolation column. Change the interpolation to Sinusoid. The controls for Sinusoid are a little clunky, but the defaults for Phase, Frequency, and Offset should be fine.

7.       Change the Value for time 0 to be 1. Change the Value for time 1 to be 0. The dialog box should match the image I attached to this email for reference.

8.       Click OK to close the Animation Keyframes dialog box.

9.       Click the Play button to see the animation. Use the Loop button to animate the mode continuously.

-Ken

Hi dear users,

My question would be about the best practice to animate mode shapes in paraview. I have an initial shape of points (x,y,z coordinates) subjected to different frequencies. There are 493 DoFs and 19 modes. What would be the best way to animate it in paraview and which input file should be used? Thank you!

Subject: [Paraview] Saving as csv data
Message-ID: <8338E75E-B4FE-4CEC-BCF2-646FB0CC8F94@sandia.gov>

The first parameter of GetComponent is the tuple you pull and the second parameter is the component of the tuple. Calling GetComponent(5,1) gets the 2nd component (stress_y, index 1) of the 6th stress value (index 5). Although GetComponent(1,5) technically works, you are actually asking for the 6th component (index 5) of the 2nd value (index 1). Since there are only 3 components and VTK does not check array bounds, you actually get the 3rd component of the following tuple.

Alternatively, I suggest you call GetTuple(). It takes one argument, the index to the stress value. It returns a Python triple with the 3 stress values.

Subject: RE: [EXTERNAL] RE: [Paraview] Saving as csv data

Hi Moreland,

Thanks! I am now able to go further. And now I know there is only one array, array 0 in my data. And I have three components in it. I guess they are: stress_x, stress_y, stress_xy. However, after searching some information, I still can not figure out the data structure of .stress.GetComponent(a,b). I do not know the meaning of a and b.

Please find the codes:

>>> a = GetActiveSource()

>>> a.UpdatePipeline()

>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)

>>> rawData

(vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid)00000077A55E0588

>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData()

>>> data_cell

(vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkCellData)00000077A5564FA8

>>> stress = data_cell.GetArray(0)

>>> stress

(vtkCommonCorePython.vtkDoubleArray)00000077A55E0048

>>> stress.GetComponent(1,5)

-4059988.0

>>> stress.GetComponent(5,1)

-5031060.0



As we can see, I use 1 and 5 for both a and b. However, both cases are right. It is strange because there should be only three components. Could you help me to figure out the meanings of a and b in GetComponent(a,b)? And whether I can use the : to extract all the data in a certain dimension, say row or column.



Best,

Teng

Teng,

GetCellData is a function. You have to call the function by adding parentheses to the call. Specifically, change

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData

to

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData()

That will return a class from which you can pull the data array for the stress field. (For example, data_cell.GetArray(0).)

Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: [Paraview] Saving as csv data

Hi Moreland,

Thank you for your detailed explanation and two specific solutions.

In order not to lose the accuracy, I will first try to save the stress data as the point data and then process it.

Also, I am searching ways to process the vtk data directly by using python shell. I have been searching the codes to get access to the real data, here are some codes I have:

>>> a =GetActiveSource()                            # First highlight the stress vtk file in pipeline.
>>> a
<paraview.servermanager.LegacyVTKReader object at 0x0000006D080174E0>
>>> a.UpdatePipeline()
>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)
>>> data_cell = rawData.CELL_DATA_FIELD
>>> data_cell
>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData
>>> data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>
>>> print data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>

However, I just have the data information, not the real stress data I need to process. And there are 118 time steps, thus 118 vtk files of my problem. I hope there is a way to process the data in python shell once and the results in all the files will change accordingly. That means I can process the stress component as the data array and do some calculations. And then save them in the old vtk file and visualize them again. That is the idea in my mind now.

And actually, since the csv file records all the stress data (cell data). If I can just print all the data arrays in the csv file and store them as variables in the python shell, I can process them and save as new csv files.

So actually, my question is how I can print out the data, no matter in the vtk files or the csv files by using python shell.

Best,
Teng

Subject: RE: [Paraview] Saving as csv data
Teng,

The issue is that your stress field data is associated with the cells and you are writing out the point data in your csv file. Thus, the stress data is not being written. There are two solutions, both with flaws:

Solution 1: When you get the dialog box labeled ?Configure Writer (DataSetCSVWriter)? (after you choose a filename), change the option ?Field Association? from ?Points? to ?Cells?. If you do this option, you will only get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled ?stress:0?, ?stress:1?, and ?stress:2?). You will not get the x, y, z information for the placement of the points.

Solution 2: Before writing out the csv file, run the ?Cell Data to Point Data? filter. Then write out the csv file with point data as you have been doing. You will get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled ?stress:0?, ?stress:1?, and ?stress:2?) and you will also get the positional x, y, and z (labeled ?Points:0?, ?Points:1?, and ?Points:2?). The problem with this solution is that it will alter the stress data slightly by averaging values of adjacent cells to points.

Also note that neither of these options will automatically write out the magnitude of the stress. To write out the stress magnitude, first run the ?Calculator? filter to compute the magnitude of the stress vectors.

Hi all,

I have a question about saving vtk data in a csv file. Please find the following link for the vtk file:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NbGlfTm9odlZpa2M/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NbGlfTm9odlZpa2M/view?usp=sharing

I expected to see 7 components in the csv file I saved: x, y, z, stress_x, stress_y, stress_z, stress_magnitude. However, in the csv file I saved, there are only three columns of data. Please find the csv file I saved:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NeWZnejVqbHEzME0/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Dmy2O1v21NeWZnejVqbHEzME0/view?usp=sharing

I saved the vtk file by first highlighting the vtk file in the pipeline, and then click save data. Then I used the default settings. Is there anything wrong in my saving process?

Thanks!

Best,
Teng

Hi Seb,

Thanks for your help. I was indeed having the same behaviour no matter whether I ran Visualizer by the command line. The problem was that my server had a screensaver that when activated made it so that ParaViewWeb could only display a black screen. So for future reference: if anyone else has problems with a pure black screen but no errors ? check to see if you have a screensaver blacking out the screen!

Kind Regards,

Louise

Hi Louise,

You are right, there is indeed more changes which might not be strait forward for you to fix. Even if in reality, it is only a bunch of import path to fix.

Just out of curiosity, did you try to run the command line that the launcher is running by hand and see if you have the same behavior as well as maybe other error output?

Otherwise, you right the screen size should be more than enough.

Hi Louise,

I'm wondering how big is the display on the remote server? Even if no screen is connected, you do need to define a display size which in your case may be tiny by default?

Otherwise, if you use the nightly binaries or paraview/master, you can tweak your launcher config to use pvbatch instead of pvpython which leverage a true offscreen rendering which will be then independent of the screen resolution. But you will need to set the following environment variable. PV_ALLOW_BATCH_INTERACTION=1

It might also be something else, but the message "window did not resize" looked suspicious.

Hello,

I have been trying to set up a ParaViewWeb server on my CentOS 6 machine to run Visualizer. I have gotten to a point where the UI loads correctly but remote rendering only displays a black screen. Not even the axes in the bottom left are displayed. However, if I switch to local rendering mode it works as normal. There are no errors at all in the Apache logs and the session log starts fine but after the twisted server startup and the lines filled with plus signs, I get the lines:

Since it works with local rendering and not remote rendering I feel as though it must be a problem with OpenGL, but running glxinfo shows that the user running the launcher has access to direct rendering.

Any suggestions on what could possibly be going wrong would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] reading MATLAB file
Message-ID: <DFEF142A-B737-42C2-B843-778783B26FFC@iu.edu>

Hello,

I have some matlab files I?d like to get into PV. Initially, the data is quite simple: sphere centers, radii, color attribute (a few 100K spheres). In the past, I?ve manually converted the files into .vtk formats using Python w/ scipy to load/parse the .mat files. But I?d like to avoid creating additional files and just read the .mat files directly.

I *think* I?d like to do this w/ Python still (but without creating files), if that?s an option. Basically, I?d welcome suggestions for the simplest approach, at least initially. I?m not terribly concerned about the ?slowness? of Python reading/converting the .mat files.

Using PV 5.4.1. And the solution needs to be easily adopted by others who will be using PV.

I?m sure there are concerns that I?ve side-stepped, e.g. would I ever want to use it in client/server mode, etc.

I?ve seen https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo <https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo> and I was also curious if a ?Programmable Source? would be an option. 

thanks! (and it?s nice to re-join the community after a long absence)

The first parameter of GetComponent is the tuple you pull and the second parameter is the component of the tuple. Calling GetComponent(5,1) gets the 2nd component (stress_y, index 1) of the 6th stress value (index 5). Although GetComponent(1,5) technically works, you are actually asking for the 6th component (index 5) of the 2nd value (index 1). Since there are only 3 components and VTK does not check array bounds, you actually get the 3rd component of the following tuple.

Alternatively, I suggest you call GetTuple(). It takes one argument, the index to the stress value. It returns a Python triple with the 3 stress values.

Hi Moreland,

Thanks! I am now able to go further. And now I know there is only one array, array 0 in my data. And I have three components in it. I guess they are: stress_x, stress_y, stress_xy. However, after searching some information, I still can not figure out the data structure of .stress.GetComponent(a,b). I do not know the meaning of a and b.

Please find the codes:

>>> a = GetActiveSource()

>>> a.UpdatePipeline()

>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)

>>> rawData

(vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid)00000077A55E0588

>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData()

>>> stress = data_cell.GetArray(0)

>>> stress.GetComponent(1,5)

-4059988.0

>>> stress.GetComponent(5,1)

-5031060.0



As we can see, I use 1 and 5 for both a and b. However, both cases are right. It is strange because there should be only three components. Could you help me to figure out the meanings of a and b in GetComponent(a,b)? And whether I can use the : to extract all the data in a certain dimension, say row or column.

Teng,

GetCellData is a function. You have to call the function by adding parentheses to the call. Specifically, change

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData

to

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData()

That will return a class from which you can pull the data array for the stress field. (For example, data_cell.GetArray(0).)

Hi Moreland,

Thank you for your detailed explanation and two specific solutions.

In order not to lose the accuracy, I will first try to save the stress data as the point data and then process it.

Also, I am searching ways to process the vtk data directly by using python shell. I have been searching the codes to get access to the real data, here are some codes I have:

>>> a =GetActiveSource()                            # First highlight the stress vtk file in pipeline.
>>> a
<paraview.servermanager.LegacyVTKReader object at 0x0000006D080174E0>
>>> a.UpdatePipeline()
>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)
>>> data_cell = rawData.CELL_DATA_FIELD
>>> data_cell
>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData
>>> data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>
>>> print data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>

However, I just have the data information, not the real stress data I need to process. And there are 118 time steps, thus 118 vtk files of my problem. I hope there is a way to process the data in python shell once and the results in all the files will change accordingly. That means I can process the stress component as the data array and do some calculations. And then save them in the old vtk file and visualize them again. That is the idea in my mind now.

And actually, since the csv file records all the stress data (cell data). If I can just print all the data arrays in the csv file and store them as variables in the python shell, I can process them and save as new csv files.

So actually, my question is how I can print out the data, no matter in the vtk files or the csv files by using python shell.

Best,
Teng

Teng,

The issue is that your stress field data is associated with the cells and you are writing out the point data in your csv file. Thus, the stress data is not being written. There are two solutions, both with flaws:

Solution 1: When you get the dialog box labeled ?Configure Writer (DataSetCSVWriter)? (after you choose a filename), change the option ?Field Association? from ?Points? to ?Cells?. If you do this option, you will only get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled ?stress:0?, ?stress:1?, and ?stress:2?). You will not get the x, y, z information for the placement of the points.

Solution 2: Before writing out the csv file, run the ?Cell Data to Point Data? filter. Then write out the csv file with point data as you have been doing. You will get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled ?stress:0?, ?stress:1?, and ?stress:2?) and you will also get the positional x, y, and z (labeled ?Points:0?, ?Points:1?, and ?Points:2?). The problem with this solution is that it will alter the stress data slightly by averaging values of adjacent cells to points.

Also note that neither of these options will automatically write out the magnitude of the stress. To write out the stress magnitude, first run the ?Calculator? filter to compute the magnitude of the stress vectors.

Teng,

Once you have called servermanager.Fetch(), you are given a raw VTK object. There are literally books written about using the VTK library. You could consult the VTK Textbook (https://www.vtk.org/vtk-textbook/), and the VTK User's Guide (https://www.vtk.org/vtk-textbook/), both of which you can get for free as a pdf file. You can also consult the Doxygen documentation generated for all VTK classes (http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html).

Unfortunately, almost all of the documentation for VTK is geared to using it in C++ since that is its native language. However, the Python bindings that you are using are very similar and it is easy to convert from one to the other.

I saved the vtk file by first highlighting the vtk file in the pipeline, and then click save data. Then I used the default settings. Is there anything wrong in my saving process?

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] programmable filter, OK in serial, FAILS in mpi
Message-ID: <CAHhX17cFOwbkDV=awtjFsAA8bLxRzXB0WEQOTyawedQfKXV7NA@mail.gmail.com>

I normally run Paraview on my workstation with mpi support (14 cores). It's
been working fine like this for a year.

For some reason however, the debug/output messages windows dont work when
running in mpi (e.g. print "hello", returns nothing). But they do work when
I turn mpi off.

I recently wrote a few new programmable filters, and while they work
perfectly with mpi off, the hand and dont do anything with mpi on.

Any idea?

-ashton

p.s. heres one of the filters for example;

from paraview.numpy_support import vtk_to_numpy

import vtkCommonDataModelPython

import numpy as np

from scipy.optimize import curve_fit


if type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid and
type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkPolyData:

    g = 0

    p = 1

elif type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid and
type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkPolyData:

    g = 1

    p = 0

else:

    print('ERROR')

    return


# import the grid

Vs = inputs[g].PointData['Vs']

depth = inputs[g].PointData['depth']

z = inputs[0].PointData['z']


# setup output

output.PointData.append(Vs, 'Vs')

output.PointData.append(depth, 'depth')

output.PointData.append(z, 'z')


# import the profile

Vs_profile = inputs[p].PointData['Vs']

depth_profile = inputs[p].PointData['depth']


def func(x, a, b, c, d,e):

    return a + b*x + c*x**2 + d*x**3 + e*x**4


nanx = np.argwhere(np.isnan(depth_profile))

nany = np.argwhere(np.isnan(Vs_profile))

nani = np.unique(np.append(nanx,nany))

xdata = numpy.delete(depth_profile, nani)

ydata = numpy.delete(Vs_profile, nani)


popt, pcov1 = curve_fit(func, xdata, ydata)



Vs_theory = popt[0] + popt[1]*depth + popt[2]*depth**2 +
popt[3]*depth**3 + popt[4]*depth**4


diff = Vs - Vs_theory

per_diff=100*diff/Vs_theory

output.PointData.append(per_diff, 'perturbation')

Hi Kenneth,

Thanks for your information. I will download these files and learn more about VTK files. And I will find resources to learn more about both Python and C++.

Teng,

Once you have called servermanager.Fetch(), you are given a raw VTK object. There are literally books written about using the VTK library. You could consult the VTK Textbook (https://www.vtk.org/vtk-textbook/), and the VTK User?s Guide (https://www.vtk.org/vtk-textbook/), both of which you can get for free as a pdf file. You can also consult the Doxygen documentation generated for all VTK classes (http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html).

Unfortunately, almost all of the documentation for VTK is geared to using it in C++ since that is its native language. However, the Python bindings that you are using are very similar and it is easy to convert from one to the other.

The first parameter of GetComponent is the tuple you pull and the second parameter is the component of the tuple. Calling GetComponent(5,1) gets the 2nd component (stress_y, index 1) of the 6th stress value (index 5). Although GetComponent(1,5) technically works, you are actually asking for the 6th component (index 5) of the 2nd value (index 1). Since there are only 3 components and VTK does not check array bounds, you actually get the 3rd component of the following tuple.

Alternatively, I suggest you call GetTuple(). It takes one argument, the index to the stress value. It returns a Python triple with the 3 stress values.

Subject: RE: [EXTERNAL] RE: [Paraview] Saving as csv data

Hi Moreland,

Thanks! I am now able to go further. And now I know there is only one array, array 0 in my data. And I have three components in it. I guess they are: stress_x, stress_y, stress_xy. However, after searching some information, I still can not figure out the data structure of .stress.GetComponent(a,b). I do not know the meaning of a and b.

Please find the codes:

>>> a = GetActiveSource()

>>> a.UpdatePipeline()

>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)

>>> rawData

(vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid)00000077A55E0588

>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData()

>>> data_cell

(vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkCellData)00000077A5564FA8

>>> stress = data_cell.GetArray(0)

>>> stress

(vtkCommonCorePython.vtkDoubleArray)00000077A55E0048

>>> stress.GetComponent(1,5)

-4059988.0

>>> stress.GetComponent(5,1)

-5031060.0



As we can see, I use 1 and 5 for both a and b. However, both cases are right. It is strange because there should be only three components. Could you help me to figure out the meanings of a and b in GetComponent(a,b)? And whether I can use the : to extract all the data in a certain dimension, say row or column.



Best,

Teng

Teng,

GetCellData is a function. You have to call the function by adding parentheses to the call. Specifically, change

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData

to

data_cell = rawData.GetCellData()

That will return a class from which you can pull the data array for the stress field. (For example, data_cell.GetArray(0).)

Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: [Paraview] Saving as csv data

Hi Moreland,

Thank you for your detailed explanation and two specific solutions.

In order not to lose the accuracy, I will first try to save the stress data as the point data and then process it.

Also, I am searching ways to process the vtk data directly by using python shell. I have been searching the codes to get access to the real data, here are some codes I have:

>>> a =GetActiveSource()                            # First highlight the stress vtk file in pipeline.
>>> a
<paraview.servermanager.LegacyVTKReader object at 0x0000006D080174E0>
>>> a.UpdatePipeline()
>>> rawData = servermanager.Fetch(a)
>>> data_cell = rawData.CELL_DATA_FIELD
>>> data_cell
>>> data_cell = rawData.GetCellData
>>> data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>
>>> print data_cell
<built-in method GetCellData of vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid object at 0x0000006D08060648>

However, I just have the data information, not the real stress data I need to process. And there are 118 time steps, thus 118 vtk files of my problem. I hope there is a way to process the data in python shell once and the results in all the files will change accordingly. That means I can process the stress component as the data array and do some calculations. And then save them in the old vtk file and visualize them again. That is the idea in my mind now.

And actually, since the csv file records all the stress data (cell data). If I can just print all the data arrays in the csv file and store them as variables in the python shell, I can process them and save as new csv files.

So actually, my question is how I can print out the data, no matter in the vtk files or the csv files by using python shell.

Best,
Teng

Subject: RE: [Paraview] Saving as csv data
Teng,

The issue is that your stress field data is associated with the cells and you are writing out the point data in your csv file. Thus, the stress data is not being written. There are two solutions, both with flaws:

Solution 1: When you get the dialog box labeled ?Configure Writer (DataSetCSVWriter)? (after you choose a filename), change the option ?Field Association? from ?Points? to ?Cells?. If you do this option, you will only get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled ?stress:0?, ?stress:1?, and ?stress:2?). You will not get the x, y, z information for the placement of the points.

Solution 2: Before writing out the csv file, run the ?Cell Data to Point Data? filter. Then write out the csv file with point data as you have been doing. You will get the x, y, and z for the stress (labeled ?stress:0?, ?stress:1?, and ?stress:2?) and you will also get the positional x, y, and z (labeled ?Points:0?, ?Points:1?, and ?Points:2?). The problem with this solution is that it will alter the stress data slightly by averaging values of adjacent cells to points.

Also note that neither of these options will automatically write out the magnitude of the stress. To write out the stress magnitude, first run the ?Calculator? filter to compute the magnitude of the stress vectors.

Hi Mathi,

When I looked at the file in ParaView it seems like the connectivity is
wrong with your cells. If you try the Clean to Grid filter that should fix
your problem. I would suggest fixing the connectivity though as the best
way to manage the data since the Clean to Grid filter will merge coincident
points and may inadvertently mess up your point data fields for the
coincident points. Note that the Clean to Grid filter reduced the number of
points in your grid from 2,006,480 to 451,792.

Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] programmable filter, OK in serial, FAILS in mpi

Hi Andre,

Are you running pvserver explicitly? If you run it explicitly and connect
with the GUI to it, the output of print statements should show up on the
terminal you ran mpiexec/mpirun on. Once you do that and we know what the
error is, I should be able to help more.

PS: What is your data source? (file format?)

Best,
-berk

Is there a Python API to read .mat files? What is the underlying structure?
I kind of remember them using HDF5 for some stuff...

I tried the decimation filter on a slice, and it ended up with huge holes.    Is this a fool's errand, or should we be able to decimate a slice and not have holes?  Do we need a new filter - decimate2d?

Not sure, but think it?s irrelevant for my particular use. I'm going to try the Programmable Source (Python script) approach (and use scipy.io.loadmat to read my .mat file). Maybe I missed it - is there a way to read in this script from a file? (copy/pasting into the Pgmable Source widget certainly works; just asking)  Thanks!

I create the following in the Pgmable Source in PV, but cannot figure out how to color the resulting points or 3D glyphs using the scalar values. What am I missing?
-Randy

# Get a vtk.PolyData object for the output
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

# Create points
num_pts = 3
newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()
scalars = vtk.vtkFloatArray()

xval = -1.0
for idx in range(0, num_pts):
  # rf. PhysiCell User Guide for these array indices to a cell's position.
  x = xval
  y = 0.0
  z = 0.0
  newPts.InsertPoint(idx, x,y,z)
  sval = xval*2
  scalars.InsertNextValue(sval)
  xval += 1.0

# Add the points to the vtkPolyData object.
pdo.SetPoints(newPts)
pdo.GetPointData().SetScalars(scalars)

verts = vtk.vtkCellArray()
for idx in range(0, num_pts):
  verts.InsertNextCell(1)
  verts.InsertCellPoint(idx)

pdo.SetVerts(verts)

Randy,

Try setting a name on the array with

scalars.SetName('array_name')

This should let you select this array as the color array in ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Overlapping ParaView windows obscuring each other in
 ParaViewWeb visualizer server
Message-ID: <E9283CEABE3D474B902D8859C0CEA8C35EBE7B@exchmbx01>

Hello all,

I seem to be observing odd behaviour on my ParaViewWeb server, in that the server works and a client can see their visualisation window fine provided a window does not overlap the ParaView window that is spawned when the user connects to the server. If a new user connects, a new ParaView window is spawned in the exact same place as the previous one, and the first user now sees the image displayed on the second user's server - seemingly because the first user's ParaView window is underneath the new user's window.

It's not just overlapping ParaView windows either. If I connect to my server via VNC and place any window on top, it also obscures the user's view, although it just blacks out the screen and doesn't show the actual window itself to the user. Attached are some screenshots of what I'm trying to describe, showing what is happening on the server desktop and what the result is in the Visualizer window.

Any ideas on what could possibly be going wrong would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

Louise Davies

Hi Louise,

I have seen something like this before when using VTK render windows on
Linux with NVidia drivers.  There is a bug/feature in the NVidia driver
where it only renders the part of the window that is shown onscreen.  The
workaround I used at the time was to enable offscreen rendering (which I
think ParaView will do by default in the 5.5 when that is released in a few
months).  In ParaView master/5.5 it will be a command line option too
--force-offscreen-rendering, but I think for 5.4 and earlier you would need
to build ParaView with offscreen rendering enabled and then use that
ParaView for Visualizer.

HTH,
Shawn

Hmm, my browser history says I searched for this back in July? looking
around there finds:

    https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17456

which seems to have dropped off our radar. Is the Vs reader necessary?
If not, feel free to disable it, otherwise the reader will need fixed
(it seems it has never worked though since it did this since its
addition to visit upstream).

This probably isn't related, but this is not the typical way to use MPI
with CMake projects. They discover and use the information from the
wrappers themselves when they find MPI.

Hi Randy

I'm not sure if it is what you are asking, but this might be useful:
https://blog.kitware.com/easy-customization-of-the-paraview-python-programmable-filter-property-panel/
.

That way you can have a GUI field for the path of the .mat file to read,
much more convenient that changing the path in the code each time.

Cheers,

Hi Louise,

Another option with the current binaries that you have is to ask for
offscreen rendering in the code (Python). The window will still pop-up but
will be black and the correct rendering pixels will be send to the web
client.

Just add those 2 lines

simple.GetRenderView().UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 1
simple.GetRenderView().UseOffscreenRendering = 1

After the line
https://github.com/Kitware/visualizer/blob/master/server/pvw-visualizer.py#L200
but in the Python script you use to start Visualizer.

Further investigation shows that the code in the class isn't used at all
anyways. You can just remove the VsStaggeredField.C line from the
Vs/CMakeLists.txt file to fix the build error.

Works for me!  Using Kitware?s 5.4.1 build.  Tested on Redhat Enterprise 6.  I believe we (i.e., the Linux install) are using evince as our default .pdf viewer (but could be wrong?)

Try reading the .pdf?s in share/paraview5.4/doc manually?  The one I just opened was Guide.pdf.

All,

Okay, we are at RedHat 7.3 and I had to change the Application Preference Order in system settings to get Okular to launch.   We will add this to our workstation image so everyone gets it.

Thanks for the clue!

I tried the decimation filter on a slice, and it ended up with huge holes.    Is this a fool?s errand, or should we be able to decimate a slice and not have holes?  Do we need a new filter ? decimate2d?

Can you list the steps you took to reproduce the holes?

Subject: [Paraview] Thanks and of-course a question.
Message-ID: <fffb07b3-e33c-7735-55ae-337b302231d1@yahoo.com>

Hi All,

Firstly, thanks for having me on the forum.

~

I am working on an optical experiment, which is a rudimentary tomography 
scanner, which samples the interference of light.

My data set currently consists of 2880 z-axis slices, each of 1600x1200 
pixels * 8-bit greyscale (Final result).

Presently, I am using pre-processing these images in ImageJ(Fiji) and 
saving out a .tif, which then Paraview can understand.

My dataset is 5,529,600,000 units x 8-bit unsigned numbers, which I 
cannot get a Volumetric visualization on:
 ?Windows 10 64-bit system
 ?nVidia card
 ?24GB of memory
 ?Single i7 Quadcore

Are there any tips that anyone has that might help me, or have I reached 
a limit of Paraview?

Thanks,
BEM

Hi All,

my issue is when I hit:

mpirun -np 32 pvserver # with or without --mpi option

I get :"vtkServerSocket (0x23fb3e0): Socket error in call to bind. Address
already in use."
and: "vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager (0x1879510): Failed to set up server

as if my paraView was compiled with the mpi capability off. But it is on
(D3 filter available, "about" windows also says so).

pvserver in serial works just fine.
Could have been the ufw firewall blocking connections, but it is disabled.

Thanks in advance for your help.

This is a total guess, but I would not be surprised if your slice is on a multi block data set that there are holes at the boundaries between blocks. I don't think there are any guarantees about the shape held after the decimation. Likewise if running MPI and the slice is distributed.

Subject: [Paraview] Properties Scroll Slowly with Cursor over Series
	Parameters
Message-ID: <CAAGOGw9aK2=5iCSOUU7PDaBHf8oDWMuv6DtRJLhOpj9FpraFbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Colleagues:

Has anyone else experienced unusably slow vertical scrolling through the
parameters dialog when the mouse is over the Series Parameters (i.e., the
various data series to plot)?  I'm seeing this on a 2017 MacBook Pro
running macOS 10.12.6.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Load a legacy VTK file with ~2 dozen data series (I'm using line chart
data).  The amount doesn't matter, but must be enough to take up a
nontrivial amount of the properties pane.
2. Click the properties "gear" to enable advanced properties (to give more
real estate to scroll through).
3. Position cursor next to "X Axis Parameters" label (a neutral area).
4. Begin to slowly scroll the dialog to reveal lower parts.  This should be
fluid until the cursor, floating above the scrolling content, comes over
the box of variables/swatches/legend names.  For this scrolling, because
I'm on a laptop, I'm using the "two-finger drag" on the touchpad.

Once the cursor is over the Series Parameters scrolling will become almost
impossible.  The only way to overcome this is to move the cursor over the
macOS vertical scroll bar, and scroll here.  This isn't an ideal solution
because this scrollbar is hidden by default.  Another approach is to
swipe/scroll so quickly as to let the inertia carry the cursor over this
trouble region.

This is very likely macOS specific, but it would be be helpful if someone
could confirm.  If confirmed, I'll file an issue in the tracker.

Please contact me with any comments, questions, or concerns.

Thank you,
Joel

Actually, it turns out that you have to specifically tell pvserver to use
different ports for every process:



mpirun -np 32 pvserver --server-port=%PV_SERVER_PORT%



But I?m now having issues connecting to all of these processes from the
paraView GUI/connect window. Can?t seem to be able to specify more than one
port at once?



Anybody knows the trick?

Thanks again

Not saying I?m right here, but it looks like multiple versions of ParaView
are tying up the socket.  Do a ps -ef on paraview, client side, and kill
them.  Do the same on the server side.  Then, try again.

Hi All,



my issue is when I hit:



mpirun -np 32 pvserver # with or without --mpi option



I get :"vtkServerSocket (0x23fb3e0): Socket error in call to bind. Address
already in use."

and: "vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager (0x1879510): Failed to set up server
socket."



as if my paraView was compiled with the mpi capability off. But it is on
(D3 filter available, "about" windows also says so).



pvserver in serial works just fine.

Could have been the ufw firewall blocking connections, but it is disabled.

Ubuntu 17.04.



Thanks in advance for your help.

Quentin

Are you sure you ParaView is built with MPI support enabled? If so, are you
sure you're using the correct mpirun executable that goes with the MPI
implementation you used to build ParaView?

Quentin,

Each pvserver rank trying to connect the same socket is the classic symptom
of paraview not build with MPI. Mind attaching your CMakeCache.txt?

Subject: [Paraview] Add data to the pipeline browser via CLI
Message-ID: <446756bd-0bbc-43b2-9525-7b26a9187527@inria.fr>

Hello,

I'm wondering if there is an option somewhere or a CLI argument to 
"open" a file (from the file manager or terminal) in the last opened 
paraview window. Right now it launches a new paraview instance for every 
file I open. My workaround is to use drag'n'drop but I'd be happy avoid 
using the mouse as much as possible.

Thanks,

-- Nicolas

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf & polygons
Message-ID: <CAFND2LCXWNu=-=qyhbsWJQkdBOqegEPAVfYF=aWkOmJN1+wYTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a polygonal mesh stored in a cgns file and I am tryng to write the
corresponding xdmf files (to be more flexible than with a cgns reader).
I attached 3 simple examples: test_mixed works fine.xdmf works fine, the
other two do not.
In order to have a xdmf file that corresponds to the hdf/cgns dataset, I
would need to have the connectivity stored as
<Topology NumberOfElements="2" Type="Polygon">
          <DataItem Format="XML" DataType="Int" Dimensions="10">
          5 1 2 3 4 5 3 3 6 4
          </DataItem>
        </Topology>

- is it possible to define a topology with Type="Polygon" ?
- is it possible to use baseOffset with a polygonal mesh?

Thank you very much for your help.
Best regards,

Xavier

Hey all

I have unstructured grid data which has connected elements. Is there a way
I can apply a filter to control the width/color of the edges of these

Hi Utkarsh,

I did not recompile paraView myself, and using version
ParaView-5.0.1-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit
I assumed that because the D3 fitler is available and that the about menus
is stating "MPI enabled", this version was MPI enabled. Am I wrong tho?

Thanks
Quentin

Quentin,

Which `mpiexec` command are you using?
You have to use the one provided with paraview, not the one of your system
which might be incompatible.

Hi Joachim,



I?m running:

mpirun -np 32 pvserver --server-port=%PV_SERVER_PORT%

per paraView?s website. Launching the pvserver is not the issue, connecting
to it in the paraview GUI is.

Thanks.

Hi Utkarsh,

I did not recompile paraView myself, and using version
ParaView-5.0.1-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit

I assumed that because the D3 fitler is available and that the about menus
is stating "MPI enabled", this version was MPI enabled. Am I wrong tho?

Thanks

Are you sure you ParaView is built with MPI support enabled? If so, are you
sure you're using the correct mpirun executable that goes with the MPI

Not saying I?m right here, but it looks like multiple versions of ParaView
are tying up the socket.  Do a ps -ef on paraview, client side, and kill
them.  Do the same on the server side.  Then, try again.

Hi All,



my issue is when I hit:



mpirun -np 32 pvserver # with or without --mpi option



I get :"vtkServerSocket (0x23fb3e0): Socket error in call to bind. Address
already in use."

and: "vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager (0x1879510): Failed to set up server
socket."



as if my paraView was compiled with the mpi capability off. But it is on
(D3 filter available, "about" windows also says so).



pvserver in serial works just fine.

Could have been the ufw firewall blocking connections, but it is disabled.

Ubuntu 17.04.



Thanks in advance for your help.

Again Quentin, which "mpiexec" program are you using?
The parallel PVServer is supposed to open just one socket to accept
client's connection. Otherwise it just means that the MPI context is not
correctly setup.
It occures if PVServer has not been built with MPI support OR you do not
use the mpiexec that correspond to the MPI library used to compile PV.

Hi

There may not be a filter to control them.  But such options are found
by clicking the advanced button (little gear icon) on the Properties
tab:
---
line width: Properties tab > Styling > Line width
Edge Color: Properties tab > Edge Styling > Edge Color
---

That's correct. It currently is not implemented for that configuration.

Here's an issue for the same if you want to follow it:

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter VTK/numpy
Message-ID: <CAJZDnTj_Q-ceSEmOd5D5Az+nzKU8vVdVgcQ6rGse-S1br0MEfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

In my programmable filter I want to use numpy to perform some operations on
the pixels (in this case a simple thresholding). I've come up with this
solution which works. I'm wondering if there are other ways to do the
conversion from numpy array to vtkImageData.

in the following code I get a numpy array out of the input vtkImageData as
B. Then I do something on the content an store the result in a numpy array,
A.

Then I convert the numpy array to a vtkImageData with
vtkImageImportFromArray importer class.
Finally I copy the importer output to the output of the programmable filter.

Thanks for any suggestions

Edo

import numpy

from vtk.util import numpy_support, vtkImageImportFromArray

import vtk.numpy_interface.dataset_adapter as dsa


B = numpy_support.vtk_to_numpy(

                inputs[0].GetPointData().GetScalars())


ifLarger = lambda x,M: x if x<=M else 0

fgt = numpy.frompyfunc(ifLarger,2,1)

#A = fgt(B,int(2**16*0.8))


ifSmaller = lambda x,M: x if x>M else 0

flt = numpy.frompyfunc(ifSmaller,2,1)

#A = flt(B,int(2**16*0.3))


ifBetween = lambda x,m,M: ifSmaller(x,m) if x<=M else 0

fbetw = numpy.frompyfunc(ifBetween,3,1)


A = fbetw(B,int(2**16*0.3), int(2**16*0.95))



A = numpy.asarray(A,dtype=uint16)

dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

A = numpy.reshape(A, (dims[2],dims[1],dims[0]), order='C')

A = numpy.ascontiguousarray(A)

importer = vtkImageImportFromArray.vtkImageImportFromArray()

importer.SetArray(A)

importer.SetDataSpacing(inputs[0].GetSpacing())

importer.SetDataOrigin(inputs[0].GetOrigin())

importer.Update()


output.DeepCopy(importer.GetOutput())

Hey

Thank you for your reply! But I meant to change those dynamically, rather
than being fixed. I was looking for a way to change that width/color, based
on some calculations. How can I do that?

Thanks. Actually, I did a poor job explaining what I want to do. I?d like to have *partial* clip planes (as opposed to ?infinite" planes over the entire domain). More specifically, my current use case is a bunch of spheres (representing biological cells) inside a spheroidal tumor. I?d like to cut out an octant, for example, from that spheroid to be able to peer inside better.

I?ve mocked up an example, using random points, and put the PV state file at https://github.com/rheiland/paraview_play <https://github.com/rheiland/paraview_play>  (along with some sample /images). I just used the Box option of the Clip filter, because the Plane option seems to define an infinite plane (via Point and Normal). But the Box params (Position, Rotate, Scale) is not intuitive for my use case. Ideally I?d like to be able to specify a Corner and 3 Vectors. And, eventually, I?d like ?cutter? results, where the spheres/cells are actually cut and capped.

So perhaps, I need an alternative pipeline for my use case. Suggestions welcome. For that matter, am I mistaken in thinking I can do what I want using OSPRay spheres?

thanks! -Randy

David,
What version of ParaView are you using? I tried your file with the latest
release 5.4.1 and it works fine.

Thanks,
Dan

Hi Jairaj,

Could you try: Filters -> Extract Edges, then Filters -> Tube.
This can vary the radius of the tube based on the point-based scalar
you calculate.

Hope that helps

Subject: [Paraview] Support collated format for openfoam
Message-ID: <07dc92af-8f20-4915-baa5-5efcdc4ddd94@Spark>

Hi

Recently, a collated format was introduced in openfoam 5.x.
So the decomposed doamin is not distributed in n processor directory any more but in one processor directory processors.
I have checked if this can be read in openfoam 5.4.0 and found it is not supported.
Have any plan to support this new feature in the next release of paraview?

I am trying to run Paraview 5.4.1 on a terminal server via remote desktop. I keep getting the error:

Silly me. I see now that it?s just a matter of using multiple Clip filters, using planes with orthogonal normals, resulting in the desired boolean set of points. Still need to figure out how to cap the clipped glyphs though?

Have you tried to use ParaView's Clip Filter with Clip Type selection

I don't think that there is any existing plan to add this capability,
though patches or support contracts to fund features like this are always
welcome :-)

Subject: [Paraview] How to test for empty block in multi-block dataset
Message-ID: <BN3PR0701MB1687F2C700C6854ED3EB12269F4D0@BN3PR0701MB1687.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

All,

I have a number of filters that process all the blocks in a multiblock dataset.

If I perform some preliminary processing, such as thresholding, I might end up with some empty blocks (contain no elements satisfying the Threshold, for instance)

When I try to process an empty block, it kills Paraview.   I tried testing for block.GetNumberOfCells()>0,  but calling GetNumberOfCells() on an empty block seems to kill Paraview all on it's own.

Is there a test I can do to detect an empty block without killing the program?

Thanks
Dennis

Hi Dennis,

I think something like:
if multiblock.GetBlock(i) != None:
  ...

should work. You probably don't even need the "!=None" part.

Cheers,
Andy

Dear Harshad,

You probably want to setup turbovnc with virtual GL. You can find
instructions here:

sure, I am not a regular MS Windows users (and never used Windows server)
but I thought they had a hardware accelerated mode for remote desktop
connection. Perhaps someone else can chime-in. I would also look into your
Graphics Hardware (do you have a GPU?) and driver version.

Nonetheless, I believe virtualgl will work on Windows (
https://virtualgl.org/vgldoc/2_2_1/#hd003005)

Thanks

Andy,

I?m not sure about the multiblock, my routines generally look like:

For block in output:
     If block.GetCellType(0)=12;
           process_block(block)

would this be

If input.GetBlock(i)
And I might not have loaded all the blocks in the set, then I might have eliminated some loaded blocks with earlier operations ? what is the i in GetBlock?  Is it block_number as displayed in Spreadsheet or block index as in:

block_index = block.FieldData.GetArray(?ElementBlockIds?) - 1

Sorry for such a basic question, but I only know the stuff I have used previously.

Dennis

Hi Aashish,

One of the requirements for virtual GL is the presence of a graphics card, which I don?t have on the server. I?ll pass this on to my IT team and see what they make out of it.

Thanks,
Harshad.

Dear Harshad,

You probably want to setup turbovnc with virtual GL. You can find instructions here: https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/virtualgl_turbovnc_howto.html

Thanks,

Hi Dennis,

Maybe the block isn't a vtkDataSet and thus wouldn't have the GetCellType()
method. You could try a print statement after the for loop to see what each
block is by doing something like:
print block

Could you share your full python code for the programmable filter? That may
make it easier to track down.

Best,
Andy

Hi Mathieu,

Thanks for the suggestions. I tried having a Programmable Filter take the PolyData input, do the check, and write new PolyData output, and that kind of worked, except that particles could reappear after being deleted. That a particle was deleted wasn?t being sent back upstream to the Particle Tracer, upstream state changes aren?t supported as I understand it.

I tried making a plugin by deriving from vtkParticleTracerBase and overriding RequestData() and IntegrateParticles(), however, that doesn?t work because they accesses private members of vtkParticleTracerBase.

I also tried copying vtkParticleTracerBase to a new class and hacking on it directly, but I?m getting link errors when I try to load the plugin, like

undefined symbol: _Z34vtkParticleTracerWithSinkBase_Init_P26vtkClientServerInterpreter

(I was able to hack directly on vtkParticleTracerBase.cxx in the ParaView src tree and it worked as expected, but I would rather get a plugin working.)


-          When making a plugin based on an abstract VTK class, does something need to change in the CMakeLists.txt? I?m just guessing that?s where my issue with the link error is?

Thanks,
Mark

Hello
Simplest way to go would be to add a Python Programmable Filter after the particle tracer, that process each point and does not copy it when it is too far from an arbitrary point.
This would work, even with paraview release, but will not be so most efficient implementation.
Harder way to go would be to copy(or inherit) the ParticleTracer as a new vtk filter and associated xml proxy plugin. And add a radius check in the code, probably in vtkParticleTracerBase::RequestData:1188

            // if the particle is sent, remove it from the list
-            if (this->SendParticleToAnotherProcess(info,previous,this->OutputPointData))
+            if (this->SendParticleToAnotherProcess(info,previous,this->OutputPointData) || !yourRadiusTest(point2))
            {
              this->ParticleHistories.erase(it);
              particle_good = false;
             }

much more efficient but you will need to know C++ and how to compile ParaView and a ParaView plugin.

Best,

Hi Mathieu,

The full science context is, this is a simulation of a binary black hole system. The way the solver works, the black hole locations aren?t actually in the mesh, they?re stored as separate coordinates with an associated radius. The black holes orbit each other during the simulation, creating turbulence in the plasma (and magnetic field). I made a few videos of particles being advected by the plasma velocity. This was basically just the mesh, a seed source, and a Particle Tracer filter. This works fine, except that particles which get within the radius of each black hole end up coagulating and behaving non-physically. If I understand the scientist right, in the simulation itself, they are able to handle this somehow correctly, but that behavior doesn?t get translated to what?s saved in the mesh.

That?s part 1. Part 2 of the vis, and this works, is that the plasma advected particles are used as seeds for streamlines through the magnetic field -- though there are streamlines coming out of non-physically correct particles.

What I?d like is to be able to check of each of the actual particle locations vs the black hole locations and radii and if they?re within that radii, delete them (or hide them, make them transparent, whatever.)  I was hoping this was something I could do with a programmable filter, but I?m open to any suggestions, including hacking on VTK source.

Hi ParaView,

Is it possible to get at the individual particles generated by ParticleTracer? I?ve been handed a mesh with a velocity field and an implied particle sink. I?d like to delete any particles that wander within a certain radius of that sink. My thought was if I could get at the array holding the particles I could check each distance and delete as necessary.

Thanks,

Andy,

GetCellType works fine when I have cells in the block, but in this recent case I had zero cells in the block after a Threshold filter,   my code is of the form:

    Def process_block(block):
        Print block.GetNumberOfCells()




    ###################################################################
    # main routine starts here
    output.CopyStructure(inputs[0].VTKObject)
    # if you ShallowCopy, then new variables created in input to filter
    output.DeepCopy(inputs[0].VTKObject)

    #
    # Loop over blocks in composite (Exodus) data set
    for block in output:

       # VTK element types:
       #     12 = VTK_HEXAHEDRON (Gdyr Hex)
       #      9 = VTK_QUAD  (Gdyr Membrane)
       #      3 = VTK_LINE  (Gdyr 3D Truss)
       # since EXODUS requires single element type per block, test 1st element only
       if block.GetCellType(0)==12:
          process_block(block)

I think GetCellType is dying as there is no element(0)
I need a way to test the block before calling anything to see if it is empty

Thanks!
Dennis

would this be

If input.GetBlock(i)
And I might not have loaded all the blocks in the set, then I might have eliminated some loaded blocks with earlier operations ? what is the i in GetBlock?  Is it block_number as displayed in Spreadsheet or block index as in:

block_index = block.FieldData.GetArray(?ElementBlockIds?) - 1

Sorry for such a basic question, but I only know the stuff I have used previously.

Subject: [Paraview] D3 filter crash
Message-ID: <81437a22eebde559af2e24c544633dd5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,



I?m able to start a pvserver over multiple cores, connect to it in paraview
GUI, open a foam file and load the results.

I then apply a D3 filter before doing anything else, at which point
paraview seems to get cranking (window darkens) and pvserver processes show
some activity, but nothing else happens.

I let it ?run? for a day now, and it is still seemingly applying that
filter.

Unfortunately no errors in either terminals (the pvserver and the paraview
ones) nor in the paraview GUI output window.



Anybody ever experienced that?

Thank you

Quentin

Andy,

That works!   Thanks much!

Now I just have to add it to every filter I?ve ever written to protect them all against empty blocks!  I?m amazed it took this long for this to come up!

Andy,

GetCellType works fine when I have cells in the block, but in this recent case I had zero cells in the block after a Threshold filter,   my code is of the form:

I think GetCellType is dying as there is no element(0)
I need a way to test the block before calling anything to see if it is empty

Thanks!

Hi Dennis,
Maybe the block isn't a vtkDataSet and thus wouldn't have the GetCellType() method. You could try a print statement after the for loop to see what each block is by doing something like:
print block

Could you share your full python code for the programmable filter? That may make it easier to track down.

Best,
Andy

would this be

And I might not have loaded all the blocks in the set, then I might have eliminated some loaded blocks with earlier operations ? what is the i in GetBlock?  Is it block_number as displayed in Spreadsheet or block index as in:

Sorry for such a basic question, but I only know the stuff I have used previously.

Hi Dennis,
I think something like:
if multiblock.GetBlock(i) != None:
  ...
should work. You probably don't even need the "!=None" part.

Glad to hear it works! A disclaimer -- I don't profess to write good Python
code, just mildly functional Python code :)

Kill it, that?s ridiculous.

My guess is that you need more nodes?  Before running the D3 filter, try View/ Memory Inspector.  If any nodes are over about 60% or 70%, you either need more resource, or less data.

I?m curious ? why are you running the D3 filter?

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] D3 filter crash

Hello all,

I?m able to start a pvserver over multiple cores, connect to it in paraview GUI, open a foam file and load the results.
I then apply a D3 filter before doing anything else, at which point paraview seems to get cranking (window darkens) and pvserver processes show some activity, but nothing else happens.
I let it ?run? for a day now, and it is still seemingly applying that filter.
Unfortunately no errors in either terminals (the pvserver and the paraview ones) nor in the paraview GUI output window.

Anybody ever experienced that?
Thank you
Quentin

Hi Alan,



The memory inspector turns back about 1% usage per core, so no overload
here.

Running 12 instances on a 16-core machine.

Note: the same case runs fine in serial on the same machine, I?m just
trying to speed up the data processing, as well as prove out some scripts
I?m building for later use on a cloud machine.



It is my understanding that a D3 filter is required to balance the load
across all nodes (working off of recomposed time steps).

Am I getting this wrong?

Don?t forget that each pvserver can?t tell that it is sharing the memory with siblings.  Thus, you care about memory use at the node or computer level.

In theory you are correct regarding D3.  It rebalances work, and also creates ghost cells around processor boundaries.  But, it is an old, somewhat moody filter.  Further, it increases memory footprint significantly (at least copies the data).  If you can work without it, do so.  Generally, if you are slow, you need more nodes or less data.  In practice, the D3 filter won?t speed you up.

Hello

Regarding the Programmable Filter, you are right, there is no way to
specify it upstream,
 you would need to keep a list of previously deleted particle that should
stay deleted, definitelly not a great solution.

Regarding the inheritance, you are right as well, but keep in mind that
ParaView is Open Source and you can contribute to the code of the
vtkParticleStreamer if you want
and add some kind of check in the base class that you could redefine in
your class if you want.

Regarding the plugin loading problem, are you trying to load the plugin in
the paraview release (not good) or in the paraview you build the plugin
with (good).
If this part is ok, then i would suggest first trying the examples plugins
in ParaView source. You will find correctly written CMakeLists and you can
work your way up from there.
"paraview/Examples/Plugins/Filter" seems a good starting point. Just copy
the folder somewhere, build it and check it can be loaded in ParaView.

Let me know if you run into any troubles.

Best,


Mathieu Westphal

Subject: [Paraview] Remote rendering with pvpython + grab remote image data
Message-ID: <CAPN39MWqDb4Rqh2Z8TUobxaou-T3N1OYERVtmGznywvYMXQjHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,
is it possible to let pvpython render images remotely on a pvserver instead
of locally inside the client?

If I start a pvserver on a headless machine and run the following script in
a pvpython client, a window pops up on the client and shows the cone:

from paraview import simple
simple.Connect("<pvserver host>")
simple.Show(simple.Cone())
simple.Render()

Because the server is headless, rendering is obviously done on the client.
What needs to be changed to let the remote pvserver do the rendering? Of
course the pvserver will then run an X server and also include a GPU.

Reason is that I want to be able to grab a batch of screenshots of huge 3D
scenes in the pvpython client, although the client has only weak (or even
none at all) 3D capabilities.
Can I use the paraview.simple module to grab an image output or a pixel
array of the remotely rendered frame?

Thank you
Kolja

Hi Edo,

Documentation for the VTK/Numpy adapter can be found here:

https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.vtk.numpy_interface.html?highlight=numpy_interface#numpy-interface-package

You will likely be interested in the dataset_adapter module that provides a
convenient way to wrap VTK data objects in a Python class that provides
easy read/write access to VTK data arrays as Numpy arrays.

You could simplify your code quite a bit using this adapter as in the
following:

import numpy

from vtk.util import numpy_support, vtkImageImportFromArray

import vtk.numpy_interface.dataset_adapter as dsa


inData = dsa.WrapDataObject(inputs[0])

B = inData.PointData['array_name'] # best practice is to name the array


#B = numpy_support.vtk_to_numpy(

#                inputs[0].GetPointData().GetScalars())


ifLarger = lambda x,M: x if x<=M else 0

fgt = numpy.frompyfunc(ifLarger,2,1)

#A = fgt(B,int(2**16*0.8))


ifSmaller = lambda x,M: x if x>M else 0

flt = numpy.frompyfunc(ifSmaller,2,1)

#A = flt(B,int(2**16*0.3))


ifBetween = lambda x,m,M: ifSmaller(x,m) if x<=M else 0

fbetw = numpy.frompyfunc(ifBetween,3,1)


A = fbetw(B,int(2**16*0.3), int(2**16*0.95))


outData = dsa.WrapDataObject(output)

outData.PointData.append(A,'new_array_name')


#A = numpy.asarray(A,dtype=uint16)

#dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

#A = numpy.reshape(A, (dims[2],dims[1],dims[0]), order='C')

#A = numpy.ascontiguousarray(A)

#importer = vtkImageImportFromArray.vtkImageImportFromArray()

#importer.SetArray(A)

#importer.SetDataSpacing(inputs[0].GetSpacing())

#importer.SetDataOrigin(inputs[0].GetOrigin())

#importer.Update()


#output.DeepCopy(importer.GetOutput())


Hope that helps,

Cory

Be aware if you are using the ParaView VR version with OpenVR support that
a recent driver update from steam has introduced some issues causing events
to be processed with delays. We should have a fixed version up in a week or
so.

Subject: [Paraview] Is it possible to group vtkImageData objects?
Message-ID: <HE1P194MB0121D36E2572F6104646470E97430@HE1P194MB0121.EURP194.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear community,


Is it possible with ParaView to group vtkImageData objects in a single file format? I would like to import a couple of regular grids (i.e. vtkImageData objects) as a single file, rather than as grid_1.pvti, grid_2.pvti, etc... Once imported I would like to simply select which grid to visualize (with volume rendering).


I tried the following structures already:


  1.  vktMultiBlockDataSet containing N vtkImageData objects as child blocks.
  2.  vtkMultiBlockDataSet containing 1 vtkMultiPieceDataSet, which contains N vtkImageData objects as child pieces

The first structure kind of works, but in order to visualize one vtkImageData I need to "Extract Block" and "Resample to Image", which doesn't result in the exact same image when doing volume rendering.
The second structure mixes my vtkImageData into a single data object. I cannot do something like "Extract Piece".

The main reason I want to have a single data structure containing all my grids is so that I can pass it to my Python CoProcess Catalyst pipeline. The number of grids can vary so I cannot simply hardcode the pipeline for a fixed number of grids.

If there is a way to make this work, please let me know!

Best,
Jimmy

Subject: [Paraview] Problem compiling ParaView with NMake
Message-ID: <CANbnWamWLFqF9SQjGo4GjSB=ZF2s4DS0asrOwCoK891Pnt87uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hallo everyone,


I tried to compile ParaView for Windows 10, using the superbuild of version
5.4.1 and NMake Makefiles as generator.


After the execution of nmake, I get the following error:


------

NMAKE : fatal error U1065: invalid option 'j'

Stop.

CMake Error at D:/Dokumente/?/ParaView/build_nmake/superbuild/sb-paraview-build.cmake:43
(message): Failed with exit code 2

------


Is this somehow related to a wrong setting of the
SUPERBUILD_PROJECT_PARALLELISM
build variable or might there be another cause for the error?


My configuration:

Windows 10 64bit

cmake version 3.8.0

VisualStudio 2015 Community


Can anybody recommend how to proceed?


Thanks in advance

Thomas

Hi Thomas,

I strongly recommend using the Ninja generator for building ParaView with
Superbuild on Windows. It will build much faster than if you use other
build generators, and will take care of the particular problem you are
seeing as -j is a Ninja option that controls the level of build parallelism.

Cheers,
Cory

Hi Jimmy,

Try "Append Attributes". This will yield a single vtkImageData that has
several point data arrays, or "attributes". As long as the input
vtkImageData have the same dimensions, this filter will do what you like.
You can then pick which array you want to view with the Volume
representation.

To extract a vtkImageData with one or a subset of the appended arrays, you
can use "Extract Component" or "Pass Arrays", respectively.

HTH,
Cory

For that case, nothing comes to mind that will let you stored several
different vtkImageData objects in a single file. Even if a
vtkMultiBlockDataSet worked for your other needs, it would actually be
saved out as one .vti file for each block plus a top-level .vtm file that
points to the .vti files.

Sorry,
Cory

Yes, the superbuild is currently only known to support Ninja on Windows.
Visual Studio is certainly out for various reasons, but NMake is
probably possible; patches would be welcome if NMake is required for
some reason. Some conditional should probably guard this section and not
do it for NMake:

    https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/common-superbuild/blob/master/cmake/SuperbuildExternalProject.cmake#L94

but that may not be sufficient either.

It's a bit complicated to select them in the user interface, but it is
possible. There was a related discussion on the mailing list recently on
how to do this: http://paraview.markmail.org/thread/j4ynkclxcucpqoa5

In the worst case, you can hard-code the array names if they don't change.
Relying on the active scalar attribute is old-style VTK and may go away
someday in the not-too-near future. Or you could just keep your original
code for defining array B.

To debug, I suggest writing your Programmable Filter script a few lines at
a time to determine which line causes the crash.

Subject: [Paraview] Remote rendering with pvpython + grab remote image
	data

I found that simple.WriteImage(...) solves the second part of my problem,
which is to grab the image data.

But I have still no clue how to make the pvserver render the scene remotely
and only transfer the rendered image to the pvpython client instead of all
3D datasets (which will be huge).

Any help?

Hi Cory,

Sorry for the delayed response. I have been trying to understand and 
learn to use the gdb, but I could not accomplish the task you mentioned. 
I am sorry :(.

When ever it is possible I will give it another try.

Cheers,

Guillermo

Subject: [Paraview] Equally spaced points on a slice (for the streamlines)
Message-ID: <CANMVBVx8tesPfG6Cuwjg0SApZRRtzeWyN-y_-eio1DJCH4hLCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.
I need to distribute points on a slice equally to start streamlines from
these points. The problem is that the Mask Points filter seems to not to
have such option. I tried all combinations of randomizing in this filter
but the problem persist. My mesh is unstructured tetra with inflation
layers on wall so there are lots of cells (points) at the wall and almost
all streamlines start in near-wall region while I need their starting
points to be equally distributed along the slice. Is there a way to do it
in ParaView?
Thanks for attention...

Subject: [Paraview] Setting glyph "Scalars" property in a C++ pipeline
Message-ID: <VI1P194MB01278DDA9AC7C8A6D2AC501E97460@VI1P194MB0127.EURP194.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear community,


I'm having a hard time figuring out how to set the "Scalars" property of a glyph object with the C++ API.

In Python it's as easy as: glyph.Scalars=['POINTS', 'ScaleByThis']


In C++ I would assume something like: vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "Scalars", true).Set("['POINTS', 'Diameters']");


But this unfortunately doesn't work. I cannot seem to find any examples or documentation on this. If someone has an example or the relevant documentation for setting this property, could you please share it with me?


It would be great if you could let me know how I can find out how to set a certain property of a source or filter, so that I don't need to ask such questions in the future ?


Best,

Jimmy

Subject: [Paraview] Rescale & axes grid tricks
Message-ID: <CAMDHuzar-aTTeuJdQcvVn0K_XFC5-Ea9n2YOOghiVYv8jeXRwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Cory, Alan and all ParaView experts,

I keep playing with two versions of Paraview following your kind advice,
thanks (see below, on Paraview 5.4.1 error message & freeze).

The earlier versions freeze sometimes as well, but I found a way to isolate
and avoid the bug (I just avoid making full screen or draw the screen
edges).

The recommended Paraview 4.4.0 I like the most, since it has button
"Rescale", which I find very useful: when you do threshold to remove
extreme values from the view, the picture looses contrast, and you can
rescale the color again.

 BUT in Paraview 5.2.0 I do not see "Rescale" button. So, after "Threshold"
all looks grayish & hard to understand what is what.

I then would stick to Paraview 4.4.0, but it has another drawback or a bug:
when I try to make visible Axas Grid & units, it works with 3D data sets
and 1D data sets (along one line), but does not work with 2D data sets.
Namely, it first appears, when I load the file, but after I click Glyph or
Threshold, the picture emerges, but the Axas Grid & units disapper! With
3D/1D data it does not, and you can enjoy seeing your full geometry. But
not with 2D, and I now mostly work with 2D  data. Paraview 5.2.0 has no
such problem.

SUMMARY:
Paraview 5.2.0 allows seeing Axas Grid & units, but does not allow Rescale
color.
Paraview 4.4.0 does not allow seeing Axas Grid & units with 2D data, but
allows Rescale.

Is there a way to enjoy both?

Thank you,

Sonya Davydycheva <http://3demholding.com>

Sonya,

ParaView 5.2.0 does have a "Rescale" color map feature. It is circled in
red here:

Subject: [Paraview] Script for exporting multiple scenes
In-Reply-To: <AM4PR0302MB2785FDC3E5B27688E8D2F198FA460@AM4PR0302MB2785.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

these are the first times that I'm using Paraview and Python.


I would like to create a script that:


1 - Read the number and name of properties (variables/contour plot) that I have in my .vtu file (for instance TEMPERATURE and TH_FLUX)

2 - Export every contour plot (Export Scenes) in vrml format, looping among them (like a "for" cycle), with the right name (for instance VtuName_TEMPERATURE.vrml and VtuName_TH_FLUX.vrml)


A priori I do not know how many and which are these properties so I think that I need first lo list them in some way.


If I record a trace this is what I obtain


***************************************************************************

#### import the simple module from the paraview
from paraview.simple import *
#### disable automatic camera reset on 'Show'
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

# get active source.
valvola_XXX_termicovtu = GetActiveSource()

# get active view
renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
# uncomment following to set a specific view size
# renderView1.ViewSize = [763, 502]

# get display properties
valvola_XXX_termicovtuDisplay = GetDisplayProperties(valvola_XXX_termicovtu, view=renderView1)

# set scalar coloring
ColorBy(valvola_XXX_termicovtuDisplay, ('POINTS', 'TEMP'))

# rescale color and/or opacity maps used to include current data range
valvola_XXX_termicovtuDisplay.RescaleTransferFunctionToDataRange(True, False)

# show color bar/color legend
valvola_XXX_termicovtuDisplay.SetScalarBarVisibility(renderView1, True)

# get color transfer function/color map for 'TEMP'
tEMPLUT = GetColorTransferFunction('TEMP')

# export view
ExportView('C:/Users/User/Desktop/TEMP.vrml', view=renderView1)

# set scalar coloring
ColorBy(valvola_XXX_termicovtuDisplay, ('POINTS', 'TH_FLUX', 'Magnitude'))

# Hide the scalar bar for this color map if no visible data is colored by it.
HideScalarBarIfNotNeeded(tEMPLUT, renderView1)

# rescale color and/or opacity maps used to include current data range
valvola_XXX_termicovtuDisplay.RescaleTransferFunctionToDataRange(True, False)

# show color bar/color legend
valvola_XXX_termicovtuDisplay.SetScalarBarVisibility(renderView1, True)

# get color transfer function/color map for 'TH_FLUX'
tH_FLUXLUT = GetColorTransferFunction('TH_FLUX')

# export view
ExportView('C:/Users/User/Desktop/TH_FLUX.vrml', view=renderView1)

#### saving camera placements for all active views

# current camera placement for renderView1
renderView1.CameraPosition = [-0.09199999999789327, 0.0665, 0.7345691646101393]
renderView1.CameraFocalPoint = [-0.09199999999789327, 0.0665, -0.05375]
renderView1.CameraParallelScale = 0.2040320134204131

#### uncomment the following to render all views
# RenderAllViews()
# alternatively, if you want to write images, you can use SaveScreenshot(...).

Thank you!!!!

Hi!

I would like to know if there's a way to acess the information/attributes

To acess the attributes in the camera of the active Layout/RenderView  I do:

1 - Open Python Shell
2 - camera = GetActiveCamera()
3 - print(camera)

And the output is:

Subject: [Paraview] How to run a python script in every interaction
Message-ID: <CAE=GJraOOkSrCGudx1Rv9Phioxvt=HJVVMgqSCe1p-_PuP0VXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

How can I run a python script in every interaction?

By interaction I mean camera movements, hitting apply buttons and etc

I don't know if an approach like running the script every N frames is the
ideal, but if that's possible it would be a great start too

Jimmy,

You can use `vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,
"Scalars").SetInputArrayToProcess(vtkDataObject::POINT, "Diameters")`.

Subject: [Paraview] How to run a python script in every interaction
In-Reply-To: <CAE=GJraOOkSrCGudx1Rv9Phioxvt=HJVVMgqSCe1p-_PuP0VXA@mail.gmail.com>
References: <CAE=GJraOOkSrCGudx1Rv9Phioxvt=HJVVMgqSCe1p-_PuP0VXA@mail.gmail.com>

For camera interaction, you can add an observer to
vtkCommand::[InteractionEvent|StartInteractionEvent|EndInteractionEvent]
fired by vtkRenderWindowInteractor.

e.g.
def callback(caller, event):
   print ("ineraction")
from paraview.vtk import vtkCommand
view = GetActiveView()
view.GetInteractor().AddObserver(vtkCommand.InteractionEvent, callback)


There's no event fired on "Apply", however. Another option is to
observe vtkCommand::StartEvent and/or vtkCommand::EndEvent on the view
itself. This is fired at start/end of each render. Since that happens
as a consequence of any interaction including moving camera or hitting
apply or advancing timestrep, that may be a reasonable approach.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Release Roadmap
Message-ID: <CADHSJjA=DwRc+g=Nq0-4ZEf-HU2MFt9hAFMroSE_t=Gz=GKSYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

We have a change in the ParaView release plan, as follows:


*1. ParaView 5.5 October/November 2017 release has been postponed.*
We have already had 3 releases this year, hence we have decided to postpone
the 5.5 release. The next release will be according to the release plan
described below.


*2. Spring and Fall releases each year*
Barring exceptional circumstances, starting with 2018, we plan to do at
least two feature releases of ParaView each year scheduled for March
(Spring) and September (Fall) with release candidates out in Feb and August
respectively.


*3. Patch releases as needed.*
Patch releases to fix critical issues with the Spring and Fall releases
will be cut as needed.


*4. Preview releases as needed.*
Preview releases to advertise new features may be cut at other times. These
are to be treated as alpha releases intended to demonstrate a new feature
or capability.

Any comments, concerns, or suggestions are always welcome.

Thanks,
The ParaView Team

Leo,

You can't access it in Python since the Python script is not run on the
server side. If your goal is to debug what thet camera is set to, you can
put cout's to print the camera in
`vtkCaveSynchronizedRenderers::HandleStartRender`. That's where the local
camera on each rank is "prepped" for rendering a frame.

Is the slice axis aligned? If so, you can use a regular source eg. Wavelet
or Mandlebrot to generate the evenly spaced points by setting the extents
appropriately.

Koija,

By default, ParaView will do remote rendering, if possible when the
geometry size exceeds ~20MBs. You can change it as following to force
remote rendering for all data.

...
simple.Show(simple.Cone())
view  = simple.GetActiveView()
view.RemoteRenderThreshold = 0

Hi  Everyone,


I'm very new to Paraview and python scripting. I have a series of time dependent .vtu files and would like to

  1.  Read the vtu files for each time step
  2.  calculate the magnitude of shear stress
  3.  calculate time-averaged shear stress for all the elements in my geometry
  4.  output/write a vtu file and load it back to paraview.

I think I have been able to successfully implement steps 1 and 2 (please see bellow)  but am completely clueless on how to do 3 and 4. Could anyone help me with this? I also should mention that I have tried the Temporal Statistics Filter and it seems to be working fine, but would like to have a way to do it with pythons scripting as well.


Thanks,
Parastou

I believe you're looking for the TemporalStatistics filter. Specifically 
what you want maybe something along the lines of:

   temporal_statistics = TemporalStatistics(Input=vtk_data)
   temporal_statistics.ComputeAverage = 1
   temporal_statistics.ComputeMinimum = 0
   temporal_statistics.ComputeMaximum = 0
   temporal_statistics.ComputeStandardDeviation = 0

This should make the computation slightly faster as you don't need to 
compute and store the stddev, min, and max.

Hi Shuhao,


Thank you for your response. Yes, I found the TemporalStatistics filter as well. Could you please let me know how I can save it back as a .vtu file?


Best Regards,

Parastou

I believe you're looking for the TemporalStatistics filter. Specifically
what you want maybe something along the lines of:

   temporal_statistics = TemporalStatistics(Input=vtk_data)
   temporal_statistics.ComputeAverage = 1
   temporal_statistics.ComputeMinimum = 0
   temporal_statistics.ComputeMaximum = 0
   temporal_statistics.ComputeStandardDeviation = 0

This should make the computation slightly faster as you don't need to
compute and store the stddev, min, and max.

There's the `SaveData` function you can use. Just save via a .vtu 
extension. I personally also use CompressorType="LZ4"

Try doing this in the paraview gui first and then record it into Python. 
Then you can see how everything is done.

I think there is an issue with volume rendering on Paraview v5.4.1 using 
EGL on ppc64le RHEL 7.2 and client-server rendering. Any model that I try 
to volume render results in a segfault.
Always seem to get these errors, but only when I try volume rendering.

Hi,

It may be a driver issue. Which NVIDIA driver version are you using?
According to
https://blog.kitware.com/off-screen-rendering-through-the-native-platform-interface-egl/
you'll need at lest 355.11.

Cheers,
Andy

using 384.61 driver. Does pvserver use software rendering for surface, 
wireframe, outline, points? Rendering in those modes works, but when I 
switch to volume rendering it crashes. I wonder if I'm just switching to 
H/W rendering when I switch to volume mode and it is crashing.

Hi,

It should do hardware rendering in all cases. If you're connecting the GUI
to the EGL pvserver though the rendering can switch from being done on the
client vs. being done on the server. You can control where the rendering is
being done in your settings under the Render View by setting the Remote
Render Threshold.

Also, what kind of dataset do you have? It's possible that the dataset type
can only be rendered with a single process.

Best,
Andy

Hello to the list,

I have openSUSE tumbleweed with gcc 7.2.1

fontconfig  2.12.1 does not compile with the error at the end of this 
mail.

Building the current fontconfig 2.12.6 works for me, maybe the version
could be upgraded?

Subject: [Paraview] LiveInsituLink proxy in pvpython client
Message-ID: <CAPN39MXXCmjz_oQSJhqaL0ZvK_3vDA3ZjJ1j+g5kck0jF7ni8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Are there any examples how to receive extracts from Catalyst simulations in
a batch pvpython script?

My first attempt looks as attached. I connect to a pvserver running on
localhost. Then I create a LiveInsituLink proxy, set the insitu port to
22222 and initialize the proxy. Finally, I repeat ProcessEvents(), which I
hoped would allow me to interact with the Catalyst simulation.

However, when I first start pvserver, then the "coproc.py" script
(attached), and finally a Catalyst example (e.g.
Examples/Catalyst/CFullExample/FEDriver.c),
nothing useful happens. The callback, which should react to any
LiveInsituLink events, is only called during initialization
(UpdatePropertyEvent and ModifiedEvent), then never again.
lil.GetTimeStep() in the endless loop shows always the same
(uninitialized?) value, there are no Debug messages from the LiveInsituLink
proxy.

How can I receive a notification, when a Catalyst simulation connects?
How can I get a list of available extracts?
Thank you
Kolja

This change would take a build right? Can't do it right now =/

My goal is to know what should I do after a

and before a

but with no sucess...

Do you know why and can explain me the reason of this warning ?
More important, how to get rid of it? hahaha
My goal trying to print the camera attributes was to debug this info!

Thanks in advance!

What does this message mean:

I get a lot of them during configure, but only on Ubuntu ppc64le

I don't have an issue configuring and building on rhel7.2/ppc64le. I 
assume there is something different in my rhel environment vs my ubuntu

Ben,

thank you! So the current master will have the upgrade within a few days?

Cheers,

Hallo Cory and all,

I've spent a few minutes trying to find out where my script crashes:

1) I load a MetaImage and the scalars are named 'MetaImage'

2) Paraview crashes if I use inData = dsa.WrapDataObject(inputs[0])

B = inData.PointData['array_name'] # best practice is to name the array


3) If I use the outData = dsa.WrapDataObject(output)

outData.PointData.append(A,'new_array_name')


the output contains nothing. It says type Uniform Rectilinear Grid but
there is no point inside.


Thanks


Edo

Hopefully. I need to get `gperf` onto the build machine since it is a
new build dependency of fontconfig.

You should change 'array_name' to 'MetaImage'. Sorry I didn't make it clear
that 'array_name' is just a placeholder for whatever name your array has.

It's not so simple :( . There's a build failure with older compilers:

Hi Kolja,

I can't recall if anyone tried the Catalyst Live connection through
pvpython but I don't think anyone has done that yet. The design was meant
to go through the GUI. My suggestion would be to start looking at the
DoLiveVisualization() method in coprocessing.py.

Leo,

To handle 90-degree pitch or elevation, do the following:

camera.Pitch(90)
camera.OrthogonalizeViewUp()
Render()

Subject: [Paraview] multiple scalar fields
Message-ID: <0E1B8ACF-3492-40D0-A7E9-E355E2605AF6@iu.edu>

How does one use 2 (or more) scalar fields in a dataset, e.g. one for a colormap, one to scale glyphs?  E.g., Pgmable Source:

pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

num_pts = 2
newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()
cell_color_ID = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
cell_radius = vtk.vtkFloatArray()

cell_color_ID.SetName('cell_color_ID')
cell_radius.SetName('cell_radius')

newPts.InsertPoint(0, -1,0,0)
cell_color_ID.InsertNextValue(1)
cell_radius.InsertNextValue(0.2)

newPts.InsertPoint(1, 1,0,0)
cell_color_ID.InsertNextValue(2)
cell_radius.InsertNextValue(0.3)

pdo.SetPoints(newPts)
pdo.GetPointData().SetScalars(cell_color_ID)
pdo.GetPointData().SetScalars(cell_radius)   # overrides the 1st

verts = vtk.vtkCellArray()
for idx in range(0, num_pts):
  verts.InsertNextCell(1)
  verts.InsertCellPoint(idx)
pdo.SetVerts(verts)

Give each array a name (vtkDataArray::SetName()) and use AddArray
(vtkFieldData:AddArray()) instead of using the atttibutes based API
(vtkDataSetAttributes::Set{Scalars/Tensors/Vectors....})

ParaView uses named array access almost exclusively anyway.

Thank you, Andy,
unfortunately your answer has shown me how little I understand about
Catalyst. But maybe it leads in the right direction after some work from my
side.

Just to make sure that we are talking about the same thing: My pvpython
client is supposed to automate some of the visualization functionality of
the paraview GUI. The coprocessing.py is in charge of the other side of the
link, namely to provide data to the visualization side, if I understand
correctly? I rather followed what happens in the constructor
pqLiveInsituVisualizationManager::pqLiveInsituVisualizationManager(int
connection_port, pqServer* server), which creates a
vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxy, not a vtkLiveInsituLink as coprocessing.py.

Now I saw that the vtkLiveInsituLink class can have ProcessType LIVE (for
the visualization side? as server side object of the proxy created by
paraview?) or INSITU (for the simulation side?). So apparently the same
class can take both roles? If yes, that'd clarify some of my confusion. But
still I don't see how coprocessing.py helps me to implement a python
visualization client?

Then, following the creation of a vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxy in the
pqLiveInsituVisualizationManager constructor, this proxy's server side
vtkLiveInsituLink calls
"parallelController->TriggerRMIOnAllChildren(INITIALIZE_CONNECTION);"
inside vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituConnect(vtkMultiProcessController*
proc0NodesController). This seems to be the first RMI sent over the link.
Is there any possibility to log the transmission or reception of this RMI?
I don't find it in the cslogs.
I think I could make some progress if I am able to debug where those
messages are sent to, and why the python client doesn't react to them.
Thank you
Kolja

Subject: [Paraview] OSPRay, scaled spheres
Message-ID: <709F61B6-27FB-4AE9-AF5D-6D4A31365965@iu.edu>

Just want to make sure I?m not missing something. In my Pgmable Source PolyData, I render Points and love the OSPRay-rendered spheres. However, is there any mechanism for (independently) scaling these, i.e., other than the fixed Point Size? Or is the only way to get scalar-value scaled spheres via the Glyph filter? If so, is it possible to control the resolution/triangulation of that glyph? Basically, I?m looking for ways of getting high-res spheres, but will also want to use vtkCutter on them later.

To change the size based on values:
check "OSPRay Use Scale Array" on "Display" section or "Properties" Tab
Choose the array name you want to scale by with "OSPRay Scale Array"
pulldown.
Define your value to radius transfer function via the "OSPRay Scale
Function" popup editor.

Note 1: the transfer function is defined to map between 0.0 and 1.0 and
clamp outside of that range. Use a calculator to scale and bias into that
range. If you don't like having to do this, file a feature request to
remind the developers to implement it one of these days such that min is
defined to be array min and max.

Note 2:Cutter will not cut through the implicit spheres.

Note 3: Point Gaussian representation's Use Scalar Array, Guassian Scale
Array and Scale Transfer Function (which I riffed off of) are similar. I'm
not sure about scale and bias and cut with this GL shader based side.

I only see the ?OSPRay Use Scale Array? on the Properties for Glyph, not the Props for the ProgrammableSource. Expected? And so, OSPRay is rendering the chunky polygonalized spherical glyphs (Representation = Surface).

If I could independently scale the implicit spheres and use OSPRay, I?d prefer that until I do the vtkCutter. (thanks for confirming, Note 2)

That control is only available if the representation type is surface, this
could explain why you don't see it on the ProgrammableSource.

In the glyph filter, use 2D glyph, VERTEX.

You lost me - in the Glyph Source block,I select Glyph Type = 2D Glyph.  Then where is VERTEX? In the Display block, I choose Representation = Points which produces a blobby mess. But a very *smooth* blobby mess :)

Recapping, hopefully the relevant bits:

Pipeline: PgmableSource -> Glyph (only show Glyph)

Glyph Properties: 
 Source: 2D Glyph
 Type: Vertex
 Active Attrs: Scalars: cell_radius
 Scaling:  Mode: scalar
               Factor: 1

OSPRay Use Scale Array - yes
               Scale Array: cell_radius
Enable OSPRay - yes

Let?s say my cell_radius has a range [5,10]

I cannot figure out how to scale up my cells to be large enough. I?ve dabbled with the OSPRay Scale Function editor, with no success.

The Scaling Factor above seems to have no effect. Is there a global scaling factor I?m missing?

(irrelevant bit, I think? I?m Masking: Every Nth Point)

I?ll experiment with my simple 2 cell example later?

Looks like:

1) I was wrong, you don't need to scale and bias the input array into 0..1.
The transfer function editor widget's piecewise range controls let you
specify what the input domain extent.

2) You are correct that there isn't currently a way to get the radii to be
> 1.0 when applying the transfer function. Without the transfer function,
the point size control sets the radii for all points. With it the transfer
function's output (which is defined to be 0..1) controls the radii of each
point. Please file a bug report.

Notes: With Point Gaussian representation there is an extra "point gaussian
radius" control that gets factored in. We could do that with ospray, or
factor in the existing point size, or possible extend the transfer function
editor widget to change the range extent to something other than 0..1.

Sounds like you want the Slice filter.

I'm not sure what you mean. Are you trying to clip some polygonal geometry
with a plane and want to fill in the hole created with a polygon?

I sometimes have multiple PVs running and don?t remember the names of the .pvsm State files I've loaded into each. Then I want to Save State and it pops up the file dialog to have me choose/enter the filename, but I don?t remember :) Is the current State filename hiding somewhere in the GUI?

Alas no. There's no notion of current state file in ParaView and hence
no way to know what state file was loaded in the current instance.

There isn't a filter exposed in ParaView to do this. You could expose
vtkContourTriangulator in an XML plugin [1] and apply that to the polyline
created by the planar Slice through your polygonal geometry.

Thanks! Before I start down that path, will this handle multiple, disjoint polylines? E.g., a plane slicing through 2 spheres; I just want to cap the sliced spheres.

I'm about 95% sure it will. It is fairly robust IIRC.

Subject: [Paraview] Specifying filters from plugins in ParaViewWeb
	Visualizer proxy file
Message-ID: <E9283CEABE3D474B902D8859C0CEA8C35EED68@exchmbx01>

Hello all,

I'm specifying some plugins to load with Visualizer, and I want to be able to apply filters from these plugins in Visualizer. I've copied the defaultProxies.json<https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Web/Python/defaultProxies.json> file from the ParaView source code and I don't know how to get ParaView to recognise my plugin filter name.

For example, I specify on the command line I want to load the default AcceleratedAlgorithms plugin. I want to expose the Flying Edges 3D filter in Visualizer. However, all of the names I can find related to the Flying Edges 3D filter in its .xml file<https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Plugins/AcceleratedAlgorithms/AcceleratedAlgorithms.xml> (e.g. FlyingEdges3D, vtkFlyingEdges3D) do not allow me to use the filter. When I click on the item in the filters pane it does nothing.

Am I understanding this incorrectly? Does it work differently for filters loaded from plugins than from default ParaView filters?

Kind Regards,

Louise

Hi Louise,

   Off the top of my head, I would think that what you are doing should
work, but maybe Seb can chime in otherwise.  In your application server
code, do you register the "ParaViewWebStartupPluginLoader" before the
"ParaViewWebProxyManager"?

Hi Scott,

I am using the default pvw-visualizer.py server file, which does register ParaViewWebStartupPluginLoader before ParaViewWebProxyManager.

For clarification, this is what I?m adding to my json file (using the Flying Edges 3D example):

In the ?filters? section:
{ "name": "FlyingEdges3D", "label": "Flying Edges 3D"}

I see, I read your first email a bit too quickly.  So you do see the filter
appear in the web ui, but it just doesn't have any effect you can see.  A
few more questions then: 1) Is there any log output you can share? 2) what
version of paraview are you running?  3) what filter or dataset type are
you giving as input to the flying edges filter?

Yes, coprocessing.py should only be used on the simulation side.

Yes, the same class does work in both roles with the LIVE ProcessType being
the visualization side and the INSITU being the simulation side. Things get
a little murkier when there is a separate pvserver from the client that
connects to the simulation.

I believe the cslogs are only between the client and server. You may be
able to print the cslogs on the simulation side as well but I haven't tried
that to verify that it works.

Subject: [Paraview] Tube around a center line
Message-ID: <AM0PR0602MB34593C65209DACC4AE60C04FA4450@AM0PR0602MB3459.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,


I have got a tube with various diameters along its height. I have the coordinates of the points which form the center line and the scalar value of the diameters. IS there a way to generate the tube shape arounda centre line using diameter, in a vtk input file without having to show the point coordinates around the tube?


Thank you!

The Tube filter is made for that.

Hi Scott,

Yes, the ui item is there but all that happens is that the logo flickers for like a second then nothing.


1.       I have no log output other than the regular output I get via starting the server

2.       Running 5.4.1, compiled from source

3.       It?s an .mha file, looking at the file info gives ?Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid)?. Note that I?m using the flying edges filter as an example since it?s a standard plugin and I can get it to apply to this dataset in ParaView desktop, so I don?t think it is the datatype. It also doesn?t work if I use a Wavelet like specified in this blog post: https://blog.kitware.com/accelerated-filters-in-paraview-5/

I see, I read your first email a bit too quickly.  So you do see the filter appear in the web ui, but it just doesn't have any effect you can see.  A few more questions then: 1) Is there any log output you can share? 2) what version of paraview are you running?  3) what filter or dataset type are you giving as input to the flying edges filter?

Hi Scott,

I am using the default pvw-visualizer.py server file, which does register ParaViewWebStartupPluginLoader before ParaViewWebProxyManager.

For clarification, this is what I?m adding to my json file (using the Flying Edges 3D example):

In the ?filters? section:
{ "name": "FlyingEdges3D", "label": "Flying Edges 3D"}

Hi Louise,

   Off the top of my head, I would think that what you are doing should work, but maybe Seb can chime in otherwise.  In your application server code, do you register the "ParaViewWebStartupPluginLoader" before the "ParaViewWebProxyManager"?

Hello all,

I?m specifying some plugins to load with Visualizer, and I want to be able to apply filters from these plugins in Visualizer. I?ve copied the defaultProxies.json<https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Web/Python/defaultProxies.json> file from the ParaView source code and I don?t know how to get ParaView to recognise my plugin filter name.

For example, I specify on the command line I want to load the default AcceleratedAlgorithms plugin. I want to expose the Flying Edges 3D filter in Visualizer. However, all of the names I can find related to the Flying Edges 3D filter in its .xml file<https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Plugins/AcceleratedAlgorithms/AcceleratedAlgorithms.xml> (e.g. FlyingEdges3D, vtkFlyingEdges3D) do not allow me to use the filter. When I click on the item in the filters pane it does nothing.

Am I understanding this incorrectly? Does it work differently for filters loaded from plugins than from default ParaView filters?

Kind Regards,

Louise

Another easy approach (not great but easy), is to check that plugin in
ParaView Qt ui as auto load and then make sure Visualizer is not started
with the "-dr" argument.
That way, the plugin will load at start time.

Subject: [Paraview] Default colorbar style
Message-ID: <00b001d34e8b$23e35cc0$6baa1640$@red-fluid.com>

Hi All.

 

I'm using Paraview 4.3.1 64bit on Linux (the system can't digest the 5.4
release for now) and I'm struggling to get the same colorbar style for any
variable on any render view and layout, i.e. once for all.

 

As I understand, using "Save current colormap settings as default" in the
"Color Map Editor" Panel and "Save current settings value as default" in the
"Edit Color Legend Parameter" panel should do the trick but changing the
variable resets the font size of both title and text/annotations.

 

Also, rescaling the colorbar changes the font size to make them fit below a
certain length or width of the bar which is also very annoying.

 

I was thus wondering if I'm doing anything/expecting something wrong or if
there is anybody experiencing the same issue.

 

Thanks,

 

R

I remember some weirdnesses with the colormap for PV 4.*.  Kitware has rewritten this code, and it really is working nice.  Would it be possible to install the latest version of PV?  5.4.1 is being a reliable workhorse.

Hey Alan.

 

Yes, I've tried the 5.4.1. on Windows and seems to work fine with scalar
variables, but the font size/color are restored to defauls values for vector
data.

 

Also, saving settings as default does not apply to colormap size and
location which is also very annoying.

Thanks very much, Cory! It did indeed (mostly) work for me. Wow, I continue to be amazed at PV. That was a super simple solution, thanks to the XML plugin option (and vtkContourTriangulator). 

I say ?mostly? because I had some intersecting spheres in my test case and the filter got a bit confused, but overall it was quite robust.

Message-ID: <B8B710E8-7B86-44CA-840A-4E7EEDA5468E@iu.edu>

I have a simple 2-point Pgmable Source (below) and render it 1) as 2D Glyphs/Vertex (with the nice OSPRay, and scaled spheres), and 2) as various 3D/geometric glyphs. Then I Export the scenes as POV files. Only the geometric (non 2D/Vertex) glyphs generate partially-meaningful POV output. However, there?s no color associated with the geometry. Thoughts?

The last related thread I saw was at:

Works for me!

Try deleting your configuration files.  You may have some old trash in there.  https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files

Then, in the Color Editor, change your color table.  Down at the bottom, left, there is a little cute icon that says "save current color map settings...."

Then, open your color legend editor.  Tiny icon, top right.  Change what you want.  Be sure to Apply.  Now, little arrow at the bottom, green arrow saving stuff on disk.

This held the state after killing and reopening ParaView.

The variable I tested on is a vector.  File/ Open/ Examples/ disk_out_ref.exo/ all variables on/ Apply.  Now, color by V.

Hey Alan.

Yes, I've tried the 5.4.1. on Windows and seems to work fine with scalar variables, but the font size/color are restored to defauls values for vector data.

Also, saving settings as default does not apply to colormap size and location which is also very annoying.

I remember some weirdnesses with the colormap for PV 4.*.  Kitware has rewritten this code, and it really is working nice.  Would it be possible to install the latest version of PV?  5.4.1 is being a reliable workhorse.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Default colorbar style

Hi All.

I'm using Paraview 4.3.1 64bit on Linux (the system can't digest the 5.4 release for now) and I'm struggling to get the same colorbar style for any variable on any render view and layout, i.e. once for all.

As I understand, using "Save current colormap settings as default" in the "Color Map Editor" Panel and "Save current settings value as default" in the "Edit Color Legend Parameter" panel should do the trick but changing the variable resets the font size of both title and text/annotations.

Also, rescaling the colorbar changes the font size to make them fit below a certain length or width of the bar which is also very annoying.

I was thus wondering if I'm doing anything/expecting something wrong or if there is anybody experiencing the same issue.

Thanks,

R

Hi Sebastien,

I?ve made it so that the plugin autoloads (and I?ve checked that the plugins are autoloading by selecting a reader plugin as autoload as well, and it does indeed allow me to open the associated filetype without me loading the plugin via the command line) and I still have the same result in Visualizer ? the filter does not apply or appear in the pipeline.

Due to this, it must be how I am specifying the filter in the proxies file rather than the plugins not loading (I would think). What property in the plugin xml should I be using in my proxies json file?

Kind Regards,

Louise

Another easy approach (not great but easy), is to check that plugin in ParaView Qt ui as auto load and then make sure Visualizer is not started with the "-dr" argument.
That way, the plugin will load at start time.

Hi Scott,

Yes, the ui item is there but all that happens is that the logo flickers for like a second then nothing.


1.       I have no log output other than the regular output I get via starting the server

2.       Running 5.4.1, compiled from source

3.       It?s an .mha file, looking at the file info gives ?Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid)?. Note that I?m using the flying edges filter as an example since it?s a standard plugin and I can get it to apply to this dataset in ParaView desktop, so I don?t think it is the datatype. It also doesn?t work if I use a Wavelet like specified in this blog post: https://blog.kitware.com/accelerated-filters-in-paraview-5/

I see, I read your first email a bit too quickly.  So you do see the filter appear in the web ui, but it just doesn't have any effect you can see.  A few more questions then: 1) Is there any log output you can share? 2) what version of paraview are you running?  3) what filter or dataset type are you giving as input to the flying edges filter?

Hi Scott,

I am using the default pvw-visualizer.py server file, which does register ParaViewWebStartupPluginLoader before ParaViewWebProxyManager.

For clarification, this is what I?m adding to my json file (using the Flying Edges 3D example):

In the ?filters? section:
{ "name": "FlyingEdges3D", "label": "Flying Edges 3D"}

Hi Louise,

   Off the top of my head, I would think that what you are doing should work, but maybe Seb can chime in otherwise.  In your application server code, do you register the "ParaViewWebStartupPluginLoader" before the "ParaViewWebProxyManager"?

Hello all,

I?m specifying some plugins to load with Visualizer, and I want to be able to apply filters from these plugins in Visualizer. I?ve copied the defaultProxies.json<https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Web/Python/defaultProxies.json> file from the ParaView source code and I don?t know how to get ParaView to recognise my plugin filter name.

For example, I specify on the command line I want to load the default AcceleratedAlgorithms plugin. I want to expose the Flying Edges 3D filter in Visualizer. However, all of the names I can find related to the Flying Edges 3D filter in its .xml file<https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Plugins/AcceleratedAlgorithms/AcceleratedAlgorithms.xml> (e.g. FlyingEdges3D, vtkFlyingEdges3D) do not allow me to use the filter. When I click on the item in the filters pane it does nothing.

Am I understanding this incorrectly? Does it work differently for filters loaded from plugins than from default ParaView filters?

Kind Regards,

Louise

They glyph filter's default is to sub sample. You can choose the total
number of samples and among different subsample strategies, via the gui.
Click the gear too see all controls if necessary.

Randy,

Is it possible you have not switched Masking Glyph Mode to All Points?    I've forgotten that a few time myself!

So, did you suggest, coprocessing.py could also help to develop the
visualization side? If yes, how? Or was my first email too unclear, so that
my intention was not obvious?

What do you mean by "murkier"? Paraview also uses a proxy (to a
vtkLiveInsituLink instance either on a pvserver or on the builtin server),
not  the class itself. Do you have an easier solution (C++ or python) by
using vtkInsituLink directly?

Are there any design documents from Kitware that show the timings and
message exchange between Catalyst, pvserver and Paraview (or other
clients)? I don't know Kitware's publishing policies. My impression was
always that you are not just developing the Paraview application but also
an open source visualization programming framework. Maybe I'm wrong, but I
am missing some kind of "Paraview Programming Guide" that goes beyond a
User's Guide, to enable others understand the concepts behind Paraview and
contribute at a deeper level than just adding filters and data processing
algorithms.
Anyway, thanks for your explanations, although I couldn't make much
progress.

Hi All,



I would like to disable the auto show setting, but couldn?t find such a
setting in the settings?

When you create and apply a new filter, paraview automatically shows that
new filter in a view.

I would like to disable that.



Thanks

Unfortunately there's no comprehensive "developing paraview" guide. It can
be used as a framework for other applications and has been designed to do
that but we haven't had any funding to work on a comprehensive guide for
that.

I haven't looked at the Live parts in depth in a while so my memory is
probably fuzzy on that and it would take a good bit of time for me to
familiarize myself with that part of the code. By murky I mean that things
get a bit confusing when you're looking at the classes for both the client,

What is meant by support services? Step-by-step guidance to solve the
problem or a complete solution?

How much would it cost if you developed a python client script that
connects to a pvserver, waits for an insitu connection and writes rendered
images of all data available from catalyst to disk for all time steps?
200$, 2000$, 20000$?
Thank you

Message-ID: <CAJ-2Sz0sb4uRoxPr_xwXss6Wh4rvU0qzUf-94=UdemduRPEX0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've used the Find Data dialog to select a region of interest by filtering
point data with the "is one of" criterion.
I would like to extract the corresponding region, but clicking on "extract
selection" does not extract the corresponding cells.

Is there a way to select cells linked to selected points ?

Subject: [Paraview] Does Catalyst add MPI processes or use TCP communication?
Message-ID: <CAPN39MXCXidb3BRe0FuQX+uuYUuQn_vf9==iy=sXpLqHPhTUZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to understand a Catalyst implementation detail.

Because parallel Catalyst may transfer huge data to a parallel pvserver, I
thought the Catalyst processes would have themselves added to the
pvserver's MPI communicator. However, MPI_Comm_spawn() is the only function
that I know of for this task, and I find "MPI_Comm_spawn" nowhere in the
code (searched case insensitive).

I thought that the standard Catalyst TCP port 22222 was only used for
control messages between Catalyst and pvserver, and data exchange would go
via MPI. But apparently there is no MPI connection between Catalyst and
pvserver, and all data are sent via TCP:22222, which could explain observed
network bottlenecks.

Can somebody clarify this implementation detail?
Thanks
Kolja

Dear mailing list members,

I'd like to announce 'geoTriMesh', a Python module I wrote to convert 
GIS data to the 3D visualisation environments. It has full support for 
donut- and multipolygons as well as projected coordinates. It works by 
creating a topological mesh by triangulating coordinate information from 
a source polygon and merging it with elevation and color raster data. 
The result is written to VTU unstructured grid to be imported into 
ParaView. X3D is also supported, as well as Python/mplot3d

It's free (Apache License) and available as Python Module (installable 
via pip) as well as QGIS Plugin:
https://github.com/flatpolar

Also, I used the library to create a global elevation mesh dataset 
(spherical and flat projection), which can be downloaded here and used 
for private or commercial 3D modelling projects (CC-BY license):
http://flatpolar.org/tocomee.html

A detailed description of the dataset is available here: 
http://ijsdir.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php/ijsdir/article/view/455

I'm happy to receive feedback.

Cheers, Michael

Hi,

Catalyst by default uses MPI_COMM_WORLD of the existing MPI library that
the simulation code is linked with. You can use another MPI communicator as
well. An example of that is in the
Examples/Catalyst/MPISubCommunicatorExample source directory.

Best,
Andy

FYI: pvserver will likely be run in a separate MPI job if you're doing a
Live connection.

Yes, so the pvserver MPI job will have one MPI_COMM_WORLD, and the Catalyst
enabled simulation will have a different MPI_COMM_WORLD.

The question is how does Catalyst send its data to the other communicator?
Afaik, their is no connection between the two unless the second
communicator is spawned from the first by MPI_Comm_spawn().

I could not find the build error in the link.

The earliest version that builds for my gcc 7.2.1 is fontconfig-2.12.4, maybe this is a ?compromise??

Hello

You cannot use your own C++ client with the binary, since you will need to
build your client againt a builded ParaView.
However in the binaries you can find paraview executable wich is our main
c++ client and can be used with pvserver.

Ah, sorry, I forgot to report back here. The issue is fixed on master.
It required an update to freetype as well.

Hmm, vtkContourTriangulator may not copy point data to its output. You can
use Resample With Dataset to get the point data back in the output of
vtkContourTriangulator. Select the input to the triangulator as well as the
triangulator itself and add a Resample With Dataset Set filter. Set the
Input of this filter to the input of the triangulator filter, and set the
Source to the triangulator filter itself.

Currently Catalyst sends its data to pvserver through sockets which will
not likely not utilize an HPC's fast interconnect. We hope to address this
in the future using ADIOS but I don't have a timetable on when that will be
done.

Thanks Mathieu. Hmm, too bad. Was hoping Catalyst might provide some magic workflow. Also saw this post from several years back (https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2010-December/019693.html <https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2010-December/019693.html>) and was hoping evolution might have produced a solution :) Obviously, I need to do more homework into options.

Thanks for clarification, Andy. The Catalyst user guide gives the
impression that it is also designed for live visualization of huge parallel
data, which is kind of misleading if all data are sent via a single TCP
connection between simulation and render server. I'd suggest you point this
out in the user guide, could have saved us lots of headaches searching for
the bottleneck.

paraview can't find cell_id of the cells?

Seems like pvbatch is not in the path. Can you confirm that `module load
paraview/5.4.0-osmesa` is indeed  pointing to a valid PATH and that
contains a `pvbatch` executable?

Subject: [Paraview] Generate Ids filter gives Ids greater than number of
	points
Message-ID: <CAEhu9hB9=cEb6AW03qPD0CqWeY-YaF00bCyOnGCbu5Btiw5X8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm not sure if this is a bug, but the Generate Ids filter in Paraview is
acting in an unexpected manner (currently using Paraview 5.4.0 installed
from Windows binaries).  For some reason, it generates point IDs higher
than the number of points on the surface.  The surface was extracted from a
larger surface using the threshold filter.  So the pipeline is:

   - Original Surface (19315 points) => Threshold Filter => Thresholded
   Surface (13383 points)
   - Thresholded Surface => Generate Ids Filter => Ids array has max Id of
   19049

I also tested this in the Programmable Filter using vtkIdFilter.  This gave
me a different result, the one I expected, where the max Id is 13382.
Since the underlying VTK class to Generate Ids seems to be vtkIdFilter,
this seems really strange.

Should this be the case and if yes, why?  Is there a way to force Generate
Ids to act like vtkIdFilter?

Thanks for your time,
Evan Kao

Sorry, nevermind.  It turns out I already had an 'Ids' array on my surface
and Generate Ids by default doesn't overwrite it.  When specifying a
different name, it works as expected.

Jairaj,

If you have dataset that can help reproduce this issue that you can
share, that'll be great.

We have fixed the issue and it has been merged into VTK master. Likewise
the PV executable download for OpenVR has been updated as well.

Thanks!
