Subject: [Paraview] Problem pasting in the GUI shell
Message-ID: <92fd0917-b802-439e-bb0b-2d10f21dbfd0@hmc-hub01.he.businessgateway.co.za>

Hi

 

Should I be able to paste a series of commands into the GUI Python shell and
then get the interpreter to process those?

 

Perhaps its an issue about eol characters?

 

In any case, I can paste 1 line but not a series of lines like the
following:

 

import vtk

pts=vtk.vtkPoints() 

pts.Initialize()

pts.InsertNextPoint(0,0,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(1,0,.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(2,1,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(3,3,0.)

 

 

The shell does not process them automatically - whereas the standard Python
shell outside the GUI does.

 

Thanks in advance,

Louis

I have a 2D vector field, I draw some streamlines in it and...the streamlines are not in the place but rather parallel to it but at some distance.
The file is very small so if someone need to see it, let me know.

Done. Has you can see only the *.pvsm files should show up but the *.png

Subject: [Paraview] streamlines
Message-ID: <op.ulhqb3i0sllp63@laptop-dell.guest.ws.tn.tudelft.nl>

Hello everybody
I have some problems in understanding how to plot streamtraces
My problem is that whatever the seed type I use they seem to "die out"  
just a few distance from the seed
In the picture you can see this matrix of cylinders where flow is flowing  
in x direction with streamtraces released in the midsection along a  
line... it seems to be impossible to have streamlines along the whole  
domain

My pipeline is something that
load file > cell data to point data > surface vectors > streamtraces
any suggestions?
TIA

don't use a line for seeds, but use a random sub-sample of points all
over the domain. Use MaskPoints from your mesh to generate the seeds.
And use "Stream Tracer "Custom Source)" from the Filters menu to
calculates streamlines. Set the Source to the output of MaskPoints

You can translate the output of the slice filter in the Z direction (or any other direction) using the Transform filter.

Message-ID: <C55997AA.55C8%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I?m running out of things to suggest.  The only problem I can think of (and this is a stretch) is that somewhere the range in the data array is being incorrectly set either by some rouge call to the information object or because the data in the array changes without the vtkDataArray object being aware of it.  Does anyone else have any ideas?  Berk?  Utkarsh?

What range of values is reported in the Information panel?  Is it giving the correct range, or the range used in the color scale?

Hi Shi, Ken, and all,

A user of my reader reported exactly the same problem about the auto
scaling on ParaView 3.5.0. He told me that after applying Rescale to
Data Range to scalar attributes the range is always set to [0, 1],
even though the data actually has a range of e.g. [87200, 87250].

He also provided me with one of the datasets that caused the problem
but so far I am not able to reproduce the problem (tested with the CVS
head on Windows and Linux 32bit). I kind of suspected an uninitialized
variable somewhere and tried a valgrind test but it didn't tell me
anything meaningful either.

Hence, I'm interested in under what exact condition this problem would
occur...? Did anyone else encounter the problem, and if so, is it 100%
reproducible?

Subject: [Paraview] vtkTree file problem with Paraview

Dear all,

I'm developing an application using InfoVis package distributed with VTK.
With my application I succesfully generate and visualize some vtkTree files using vtkTreeWriter and setting the extension of the file to vtk (ex. MyTree.vtk).

Now I'd like to use paraview/overview (3.5.0) package in order to open the vtkTree files generated with my application.
I sucessufully compiled all paraview/overview pakage, I included all the plug in...but when I try to open my vtkTree files it give me an error.
It says it cant recognize the data type TREE.

Is it normal?..May it's becouse the vtkTreeReader is not included in the package?...

I also tryed to create a plug in for vtkTreeReader....

Here is the code:
----------------------
CMAKELIST
----------------------
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(vtkTreeReader "1.0"

-------------------------------------
vtkTreeReaderGUI.xml
------------------------------------
<ParaViewReaders>
  <Reader name="TreeReader" extensions="vtk" file_description="VTK Trees">
  </Reader>
</ParaViewReaders>



It sucessfully complile but when i try to open the file it give me the same error. The vtkTree file extension is also not present in the list of file type supported.
Any Idea?
I tryed to open the file also with overview but it  happen the same.

Thank you

Matteo

I just checked in a change to vtkPVScalarBarActor.cxx that I think will fix the problem.  Let me know if it does not.

BTW, in the future it would be helpful if you reported the system you are compiling with.  I'm guessing you are using MSVC 7 or earlier.

Eric,

I had a temporal problem and made a small change to 
vtkCompositeDataPipeline which fixed my trouble. It occurred to me (and 
I confess that due to other deadlines, I have not followed this thread 
carefully, but I will fix the problem after Christmas) - that perhaps 
your problem was related.

Try this

open vtkCompositeDataPipeline

search for two lines with hasRTD = true and comment them out - like so!
// hasRTD = true;

Now tell me if your pipeline does what you expect.

I don't know why REQUIRES_TIME_DOWNSTREAM is actually being forwarded up 
the pipeline, the executive should replace the output of the filter it 
is working with now, and others can do as they please. I was getting all 
sorts of nonsense with multiple temporal filters causing outputs to be 
replaced all over the place, this solved it.

It may not be applicable to your case, but if it works...please let me know.

Subject: [Paraview] Adding Scroll to Custom Object Panel
Message-ID: <821735.2331.qm@web110104.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey all,



have you ever added a QT Scroll to the custom Object Panel of a Filter ? I have tryied adding the following code:



??? QScrollArea* s = new QScrollArea(this);

??? s->setVerticalScrollBarPolicy(Qt::ScrollBarAsNeeded);

??? s->setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(Qt::ScrollBarAsNeeded);

??? s->setWidgetResizable(true);

??? s->setObjectName("scrollArea");

??? s->setVisible(true);



to my Panel constructor, which extends pqLoadedFormObjectPanel, but I've got no success ! 



Any tips ?



Thanks all,

Rafael March.

Subject: [Paraview] Ghost cells for standalone Paraview
Message-ID: <493541BB.6020408@lse.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de>

Hi,

To close my isosurfaces of my unstructured grid I need ghost cells.
I found that D3 is capable of doing this but I use a standalone ParaView.

What can I do? Shall I write a python filter?

Thanks,

Fabian

I appreciate your response. I have just sent a query about the values
repoted in the Information panel to the user. Meanwhile I skimmed
through pqPipelineRepresentation and its relevant classes but haven't
found anything suspicious so far.

Rafael,

Have you created a user interface with designer?  If so, why not just add
the scroll area there?

Hey John,

I really appreciate the suggestion, but it doesn't seem to do anything  
to solve this problem.

If you can take a look at this after Christmas that would be great!

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] coloring by cell normals not preserved in undo stack
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.0.82.0812011603160.16454@memphis.cs.utah.edu>

Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but here's how to duplicate what I'm 
seeing:

1. Create a basic object (Sources -> Sphere, then click Apply)
2. On the Display tab, change "Color by: Solid Color" to "Color by: 
cellNormals". Notice the different colors on the faces of the sphere.
3. Click the Undo button. The sphere returns to the default color.
4. Click the Redo button. The sphere is now colored, but now each face has 
the same color, instead of the mixture as before the Undo.

Is this expected/correct?  (I'm running yesterday's snapshot from CVS, 
but have noticed this behavior in previous builds, too.  My OS is Windows 
XP and my compiler is Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition.)

Thank you for any insight you could offer!
--Geoff

If you are not running in parallel, you do not need ghost cells.  If necessary, just run the Clean to Grid filter to restore connectivity.

Hi,

To close my isosurfaces of my unstructured grid I need ghost cells.
I found that D3 is capable of doing this but I use a standalone ParaView.

What can I do? Shall I write a python filter?

Geoff,

The magnitude of the cell normals (which is what you are coloring by) should be 1 for all of them.  The different  colors you are seeing initially are simply due to numerical error.  As you are doing undo/redo, some (non-significant) precision must be lost.  I don't know why there is a change, but it should not be an issue.  When I try the undo/redo with color mapping with changes in the significant digits, the results are consistent.  Let us know if you come with a counterexample.

-Ken

Message-ID: <b0a936c00812020927x4b5ecd2bw24f7f32b5a13abea@mail.gmail.com>

I have two bounding planes of different number of boundary points and shapes
as shown in figure 1. Is there an alternative way to visualize the solid
object from these two planes? I can apply 'Delaunay 3D' filter, but the
resulting figure is not satisfactory enough due to the redundant elements as
you see in figure 2.

Thanks

Eric

OK I was waiting for some files to copy, so I had a quick edit of 
vtkTemporalSnapToTimeStep and vtkTemporalShiftScale. Both these classes 
derived from vtkTemporalDataSetAlgorithm, but this was wrong, when we 
reimplemented the Temporal stuff, it was possible for these classes to 
derive from vtkDataObject. All they do is change information.
You can now connect them to normal filters willy nilly, without 
vtkTemporalDataSets being created all over the shop.

Tyr updating from CVS the 4 files in Hybrid
vtkTemporalSnap* vtkTemporalShift*

then have another go. Get rid of any TemporalCache filters that you 
don't need too.

I've been meaning to do this for ages. I hope it makes a difference. I 
still haven't actually read all your emails, but I'm sure there was some 
dodgy temporal caching/dataset swapping going on, this ought to make it 
easier to track down when I do look into it properly at least ....

The legacy reader for paraview/overview does not yet support VTK classes.

> I also tryed to create a plug in for vtkTreeReader....

Your reader plugin looks close to correct, and should appear in the
menu. Does your plugin appear in OverView under Tools -> Manage
Plugins ?
You can also try adding

  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/IO/vtkTreeReader.h

to your ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN command. You can look at Plugins/Infovis
to see how other infovis readers are added to the list.

Should read "does not yet support VTK infovis classes (vtkTable,
vtkGraph, vtkTree)."

I am trying to update my plugin creator and I am coming up against  
some issues that I am not sure how to solve because I am basically  
confused as to what is going wrong. Here is the CMakeLists.txt file  
that I generate:

project(MyPlugin)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.4)
if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
       cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

# Configure output directories.
SET (LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Bin"
      CACHE INTERNAL "For libraries.")
SET (EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Bin"
      CACHE INTERNAL "For executables.")


# -- Set the Module Name
SET(MODULE_NAME MyPlugin)
# -- Find ParaView -----
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}"
                         "${MyPlugin_SOURCE_DIR}/src/"
)
#-- List our source files --
#SET (SOURCES ${SOURCES} ${MyPlugin_SOURCE_DIR}/src/.cpp)
SET (SOURCES ${SOURCES} ${MyPlugin_SOURCE_DIR}/src/vtkMyReader.cpp)
#SET (SOURCES ${SOURCES} ${MyPlugin_SOURCE_DIR}/src/.cpp)


# -- Add the Plugin to ParaView -----
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPlugin "1.0"
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ${SOURCES}
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML ${MyPlugin_SOURCE_DIR}/XMLFiles/MyPlugin_pvsm.xml
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES ${MyPlugin_SOURCE_DIR}/XMLFiles/MyPlugin_gui.xml
   )


When I run cmake and then compile the project I get:

-- Build files have been written to: /Users/mjackson/Workspace/ 
MyPlugin/Build

No where in there is anything about the vtkMyReader.cpp being  
compiled. Um.. What am I missing?

Gaaahhhhh....

I'm using a variable (SOURCES) that is actually an optional argument  
to the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN() macro.


If I change SET (SOURCES ${ParaViewExamples_SOURCE_DIR}/ 
vtkMyElevationFilter.cxx) to

SET (_SOURCES ${ParaViewExamples_SOURCE_DIR}/vtkMyElevationFilter.cxx)
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(SMMyElevation "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyElevationFilter.xml
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES "${_SOURCES}"
# SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyElevationFilter.cxx
  )

then everything works.

Hmm. I was thinking that cmake would have done the variable  
substitution FIRST before sending it to the macro.

Is this a bug or feature?

Hey John,

Unfortunately, this didn't do it either.

When you get around to looking at it more closely, load up the simple  
data set I sent at the beginning of the thread (or that Ken posted to  
the bug report), put two temporal shift scales branching off of it,  
one with zero post-shift and one with a post-shift of 1. Group those  
two temporal shift scales and look at the output.

Step forward and backward in time -- the behavior is different each  
direction. Go to the Information tab of the grouped data set -- it  
shows a Multi-block Dataset of two Unstructured Grids, and the Current  
Time Step for each looks right, but the data itself (the scalar  
"Step", and the X range) is clearly not different between the two UGs.  
Also, in one direction, the Current Time only increments every other  
click of the time increment button.

Hope you're able to track it down. Thanks again,
-Eric

Thank you Jeff,

I did the changes you suggested me....
It seems all is ok....I can see my vtkReader.dll  in   OverView under 
Tools -> ManagePlugins
...but still...it doesnt appear in the flie list type.

Anyway...I'll convert my tree in a Traditional Polydata and then manage it 
with paraview....It's Amazing anyway! :)

Thank you!!!!

Matteo

Message-ID: <809AB77D-AB6A-4933-95E7-6577BA81B0EF@videotron.ca>

Good afternoon,

I'm looking for an example on how to use the calculator filter in a  
python script.
With the calculator, I want to :

1) Extract each component of a vector array (x, y, z);
2) Apply a scalar factor on each array (for unit conversion).

Best regards,

PO

Here's something I did recently

calc = servermanager.filters.Calculator(Input=pderiv)
calc.ResultArrayName = 'w'
calc.AddVectorVariable = ['Vorticity', 'Vorticity', '0', '1', '2']
calc.Function = '(Vorticity).(kHat)'
calc.UpdatePipeline() # w is now element 16

This gave the vorticity in the khat direction.  That should get you started.

Good Luck,
Peter.

I could not figure out how the Clean to Grid filter can help me. The
problem is, that my isosurfaces don't close. In my master thesis
I used Amira for visualization of cell data but had ghost cells. There
the surface is closed.

I add screenshots of what I get from ParaView and what I desire. Thanks
a lot for help - this was one of the reasons for me to move from gmv.

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple Screens
Message-ID: <4936A148.E7F9.0038.3@jku.at>

** Reply Requested When Convenient **

Hello !

I was using 2.6 paraview so i tought ist time to change ---> but
displaying rending on another screen does no mor work (or work different)
I used to mpirun -np 1 ./pvclient -display :0.0 : -np 1 .pvclient -display :0.1 : -np 1 ./pvclient -diplay :0.2 

or

mpirun -np 3 ./pvserver config.pvx

in the config.pvx i gave the configuration of the screens 

but neither of this options open a window on the dired screens.

Anyone who does that with 3.x version 

thank you 

christian

Message-ID: <b0a936c00812030749n7faf1955nfa5d9288d1ebdec1@mail.gmail.com>

My python script consists of following segments:

import vtk
sm=servermanager
pm=sm.ProxyManager()
view=sm.GetRenderView() #CreateRenderView()
reader=pm.GetProxy('sources','py_3d_strike0_stack_XY.vti')
rep=sm.CreateRepresentation(reader,view)

...
...
...

# draw the axes.  Add the actor to the renderer.
axes = vtk.vtkCubeAxesActor2D()
axes.SetInput(normals.GetOutput())
axes.SetCamera(ren.GetActiveCamera())
axes.SetLabelFormat("%6.4g")
axes.SetFlyModeToOuterEdges()
axes.SetFontFactor(0.8)
axes.SetAxisTitleTextProperty(tprop)
axes.SetAxisLabelTextProperty(tprop)

Now, how can I add 'axes' to 'view'? Because I cannot use like
'view.AddViewProp(axes)'. I would be grateful for the suggestions.

Thanks

Just use the Cube Axes properties of the representation, no need to create the vtk object.

Many thanks. Unfortunately that option is not that customizable (specially
the size of the font). Sometimes, my axes labels are practically invisible!

Fair enough, I don't know how to change the text properties.

Hi Jerry,

I am lucky to find this thread...
I am about to try exactly the same as Renato did (lot of timesteps of a
big simulation -> parallel mode nessessary)

Therefor I was wondering if wildcards might work already. I found this
website on XPath (http://www.w3schools.com/XPath/xpath_syntax.asp),
which says "XPath wildcards can be used to select unknown XML elements."

Any new ideas how to shrink a huge xdmf-file?

Greetings
Jens

OK.  It sounds like the range is properly being computed, but the range is not getting to the lookup table.  If you are able to replicate the problem and capable of running a debug version of ParaView in a debugger, you might be able to narrow this down a bit more by setting a breakpoint at pqPipelineRepresentation::resetLookupTableScalarRange().

Another possibility that occurred to me is that the rescale operation is performed on the selected variable for the selected object in the pipeline browser.  Furthermore, all variables with the same name are synchronized to the same color range.  Thus, you could see this kind of behavior if you have the wrong item selected in the pipeline browser.

Christian,

Did you mistype the first mpirun command?  Running pvclient in mpirun has never worked in any ParaView version.

With ParaView 3.4, the following similar launch command should work (assuming that your version of mpirun supports the ":" argument):

 mpirun -np 1 ./pvserver -display :0.0 : -np 1 ./pvserver -display :0.1 : -np 1 ./pvserver -display :0.2

If this doesn't work, can you be more specific about what happens?  Do you get X host errors?  Do all the windows show up on display :0.0?

-Ken

Hello !

I was using 2.6 paraview so i tought ist time to change ---> but
displaying rending on another screen does no mor work (or work different)
I used to mpirun -np 1 ./pvclient -display :0.0 : -np 1 .pvclient -display :0.1 : -np 1 ./pvclient -diplay :0.2

or

mpirun -np 3 ./pvserver config.pvx

in the config.pvx i gave the configuration of the screens

but neither of this options open a window on the dired screens.

Anyone who does that with 3.x version

thank you

Message-ID: <C55C3E85.406C%kmorel@sandia.gov>

OK, I understand now.  What you are asking for is not exactly what VTK/ParaView considers ghost cells.  You want add a layer of points around the boundary of an image data (i.e. 3D uniform regular grid) with minimum values to force the contour filter to create closed surfaces.  I don't know of an easy way to do this in ParaView (someone please correct me if I am wrong).

I think you can get the effect you want by using the clip by scalars feature.  Instead of using the contour filter, use the clip filter.  Change the "Clip Type" to "Scalar" and set the value to the isosurface you want to see.  The advantage of this approach is that the data you see will show the surface right at the edge of the volume instead of the arbitrary rounding at the edges you see in the Amira screenshots.  The disadvantage is that the underlying data is a solid unstructured geometry which could take up much more memory than the original image data.  If memory is an issue, let me know and I can describe memory-light version that uses a combination of the contour, extract surface, and clip filters.

I could not figure out how the Clean to Grid filter can help me. The
problem is, that my isosurfaces don't close. In my master thesis
I used Amira for visualization of cell data but had ghost cells. There
the surface is closed.

I add screenshots of what I get from ParaView and what I desire. Thanks
a lot for help - this was one of the reasons for me to move from gmv.

Hi Ken,

thanks a lot - you solved the issue! :)

It works fine with the clip filter - memory consumption seems to be in
the green range!

Best regards from ol' Europe,

Subject: [Paraview] file-transfer in paraview <--> pvserver
Message-ID: <4937E6EE.90908@gmx.de>

Hi,

Can anyone tell me how file-transfer is done if paraview(client/server)
is used?

a) does paraview(client) always sends the whole data (for me a lot of
GBytes) to pvserver,
b) or do I have to have a directory, which is mounted on the client and
server at the same position,
c) or is there even a way to select a file stored on the pvserver-node,
through paraview(client)

"c" would be the best, but I cannot see anything like this in the "Open
File" dialog.
If "b" is the way to go - will this lead to network traffic?

Greetings
Jens

Hi,

I am wondering why when I do the following in pvpython:

from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect()
view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
print servermanager.GetRenderView()

This shows None -

Shouldn't creating a render view set it as well ?
Is there a way of setting it ?

Thank you

Jens,

When operating in client-server mode (connected to a pvserver), ParaView 
can only open data files located on the server side (option c). The 
"Open File" is indeed browsing the server side directory structure when 
connection to a server node.

GetRenderView() locates a registered render view and returns that. If no 
view is registered GetRenderView() will return NULL. To register a view use:

servermanager.Register(view)

You example becomes:
  from paraview import servermanager
  servermanager.Connect()
  view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
  servermanager.Register(view)
  print servermanager.GetRenderView()

Christian,

How is it failing?  Does it crash?  Does it give an error?  Does it open a bunch of windows where it shouldn't be?

What version of ParaView are you using?

You may want to try using the env program to set the display to see if that helps.

 mpirun -np 1 /bin/env DISPLAY=:0.0 ./pvserver : -np 1 ...

Subject: [Paraview] Migrating a plugin from QT 4.3.4 to QT 4.4.2 - Problems
Message-ID: <322017.54378.qm@web110107.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I've programmed a plugin in QT 4.3.4, and I'm interested in migrating it to the 4.4.2 version. The reason is that I just can't add it scroll behaviour, and in the newer version I can add a QScrollArea through QT Designer.

So, I've compiled ParaView 3.4 (Production Version) pointing to QT 4.2 and, despite the "COMPATIBILITY NOT OFFICIALLY ASSURED"-like messages, I was able to complete the building process, and got a working version of ParaView 3.4 with QT 4.4.2.

Now, I want to get my plugin to work with the new QT version. I've "cmaked" it pointing to QT 4.4.2, and when I try to compile it, I'm getting messages like:

Error??? 1??? error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "__declspec(dllimport) public: bool __thiscall QBasicAtomicInt::ref(void)" (__imp_?ref at QBasicAtomicInt@@QAE_NXZ) referenced in function "public: __thiscall QList<class QObject *>::QList<class QObject *>(void)" (??0?$QList at PAVQObject@@@@QAE at XZ)??? EdgeCFDPluginPluginImplementation.obj??? 

Error??? 2??? error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "__declspec(dllimport) public: bool __thiscall QBasicAtomicInt::deref(void)" (__imp_?deref at QBasicAtomicInt@@QAE_NXZ) referenced in function "public: __thiscall QList<class QObject *>::~QList<class QObject *>(void)" (??1?$QList at PAVQObject@@@@QAE at XZ)???

EdgeCFDPluginPluginImplementation.obj??? 

Error??? 4??? error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "__declspec(dllimport) public: bool __thiscall QBasicAtomicInt::operator==(int)const " (__imp_??8QBasicAtomicInt@@QBE_NH at Z) referenced in function "private: void __thiscall QList<class QObject *>::free(struct QListData::Data *)" (?free@?$QList at PAVQObject@@@@AAEXPAUData at QListData@@@Z)??? EdgeCFDPluginPluginImplementation.obj??? 

All messages with the "QBasicAtomicInt" stuff ! 

Does anybody know how can I solve this problem ?

Thanks all,
Rafael March.

Message-ID: <ce5dae9f0812040849k598518a3g38d7fb01989b9e92@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I compiled Paraview for use in parallel.
I have an Ensight data set that has been output from fluent. I also have the
fluent .cas and .dat files (saved from a cluster run)
I would like to load the data using the best of paraview in parallel.
If I launch pvserver on 4 nodes and load the ensight data it seems that it
loads the data 4 times.

What would be the best / efficient way of using the parallel functionality ?
Is there a way of partitioning the ensight file ? Or setting up the reader
so that it partitions the data at the reading stage ? Or maybe is there a
Fluent reader that will load in the partitions from the .cas file ?

Hi,

I attach part of a script I wrote that loads in an ensight dataset, does
some filtering and then outputs the views I want to a file. I am wondering
what I should change in this script or in the way I use pvpython in order to
not get a black window pop up. If I use the
view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshotsOn(), it doesn't seem to make much
of a difference (keeps the black screen but does not flicker through the
images).

Not yet. We will have support for ASCII Tecplot files relatively soon.  
The Tecplot format is very rich so I don't expect that we will have  
full support soon.

The answer depends on the data type. Is it structured or unstructured?

The grid is unstructured. It comes up as a multiblock dataset in ParaView,
but there is only one fluid volume. The other blocks are just surfaces.

Hi Utkarsh,

thanks for this good news :)

Perhaps you can answer me one more question about client-server:
If I ran
  1.) the pvserver(pvdataserver+pvrenderserver) on our cluster and
  2.) the data gets rendered on the opengl-hardware of the nodes
will pvrenderserver only transfer a 2D-picture to my client or will it
transfer any 3D-opengl-commands?

I just ask to know if the linux-clients need any 3D-acceleration or can
I just use the open-source-driver without 3D (only software-3D).

Greetings
Jens

Subject: [Paraview] Questions about Multiblock
Message-ID: <49393160.3070501@lse.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de>

Hi,

I export VTK multiblock files. I have the following questions:
* How can I assign names to the datasets? I googled and found a hint
to use "name" in
  the pvd file but this is ignored.
* Is it possible to write the blocks to a single file?

* Paraview crashes when I load the pvd file:
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1">
  <Collection>
   <DataSet timestep="1" name="this is a name" part="0"
file="piezo_00000.vtm"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

But loading the vtm file works. Is there some logging about the crash?

* Is it possible to writte several timesteps within one XML file?

Thanks a lot,

Fabian

The variable files are in binary format.
Paraview shows the mesh but nothing else (no variables).
All is ok when Ensight is used.
Thx in advance for you help.

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver always shows 100% cpu usage
Message-ID: <49394BD9.7010709@gmx.de>

Hi,

if I run "mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver" on our cluster-node and connect from
my client, this pvserver always shows 100% cpu usage - even if I do
nothing at the client.

Seems to me as if there is a loop waiting for the client to ask for
action - but this loop is calling no wait/sleep function.

Greetings
Jens

Hi Jens,
   Your pvserver is probably waiting on an MPI_Recv and your MPI  
implementation is spinning.
You will note that process 0 probably isn't doing this, as the other  
nodes are waiting on process 0 to send.
I have searched this problem all the way to the MPI developers as  
it's easy to replicate without paraview and the MPI guys assure me  
the alternatives are worse.

Hi John,

thanks for your answer. That makes sense. "Normal" mpi-apps are probably
not written to wait for more things to do - they are simply always busy.

It is just a pity that the cluster has to run 100% producing a lot of
heat for nothing.

So the MPI-lib will probably not change this behavior :( ? (I am using
open-mpi 1.2.8)

Greetings
Jens

Hi John,

thought about this problem again...

A solution could be
a)to use MPI_IRecv/MPI_Wait instead of MPI_Recv.

If that results in the same 100% cpu for the MPI_Wait-command,
b) it could be a solution to add a wait()/sleep() just beweeen MPI_IRecv
and MPI_Wait.
How long this wait/sleep would be could depend
a) on the time the function MPI_Wait takes to return.
b) or on some value send by process 0 (process 0 could send other
processes to sleep for a while)

What do you think?

Greetings
Jens

Hi Guys,

I just checked this with 2 pvserver running on my 8 core workstation and 
I don't see it, I'm using mpich2-1.0.7.  I have heard somewhere it's an 
issue specific with openmpi, not sure how true that rumor is though.

Hi Jens,
   If I recall correctly, your observation lies in the type of  
hardware you are using.   I think some hardware allows a developer to  
leverage an interrupt while some requires polling for a received  
message.   Design requirements for MPI to be fast with low latency  
usually (I presume) outweigh lowering heat production.

I think I first noticed this issue with mvapich when infiniband was  
new.  I don't think we had it with Myrinet 2000 or Gig-E.

I also think ParaView is a normal mpi application, we just don't  
notice machines spinning while waiting during batch processing, we  
just assume they're working hard.

-John.

Hi Jens,
    I would think that each pvserver process would have to be able to  
detect that it was in a lengthy wait state because it sure would suck  
to have an MPI_Wait in the middle of each send/recv pair during  
compositing ...  And it would probably be difficult to handle the  
tiled display communication.
The design of a solution might not be so straight forward ....  I  
think,  you would have to first decide that it really is a problem  
versus cost of doing business.
-John.

Hi all,

It just depends on how it is implemented with MPI.  There will be lower
latency if it spins in a loop waiting for a message.  Here is a link to the
FAQ which shows how you can stop this for OpenMPI:

http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#oversubscribing
http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#force-aggressive-degraded

Paul

Just a quick note - I have noticed the same behavior with LAM-MPI, but not
with MPICH.

I am guessing this is a 2D contour, correct? If yes, this is a feature
I am supposed to work on for the next release. Can you send me an
example file?

I am afraid there is no easy way of doing. You can use the python
programmable filter to remove the arrays you don't want though. There
is some documentation on the wiki.

Chris,

If you put a feature request at http://paraview.org/Bug, maybe I will
get to provide an example python script to accomplish this. Send me an

Hi Louis,

Why not move the data generation inside a programmable source? That
would make things much easier and also work in client-server
environment.

       <snip>

The difference I see is my explicit inclusion of the variable name 
before the file name.  Is it possible that EnSight understands the 
"condensed" form where the variable name is appended to the file name?

If the geometry size is below the remote render threshold, geometry is
transferred and rendered on the client. If the geometry size is above
the threshold, rendering happens on the server and the resulting image
is transferred. No OpenGL commands travel over the network.

There is a trick I use to do this that does not require python.
It works if you save your data in an xml format. I edit the header of  
the xml data file
to mask out the variables I do not want. Then you can read the edited  
data file into ParaView and
do a "Save Data" and the saved data file will only have the unmasked  
out variables, and thus be smaller.
A little round about, but it can be handy to reduce the size of data  
files to something more manageable that only
contains the variables you need.
Below is the header of one of my .vtp data files, with three variables  
commented out.
In xml comments start with: <!--
and end with: -->
In the example below I have commented out the variables
Pressure, Temperature and Total_Viscosity
I have left only velocity

Hope this helps

Hi John,

I compared a)MPI_Send/MPI_Recv with b)MPI_ISend/MPI_IRecv/MPI_Wait and
it depends on the situation which style is the fastest - style b is not
simply worse than style a. If you have high latency because of your
network-hardware you are better of with style b. But it is difficult to
tell, because there is not much difference.

Anyway, is there one single part in the paraview-code, which handles the
MPI-Stuff, or is MPI all over the place? If first is the case, it would
be easy to implement some "wait"-packet+constant polling of process 0 to
get rid of MPI-lib-dependens, but processor and/or memory affinity is
probably a problem then ...
(http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=tuning#using-paffinity)

Jens

Hi Paul,

this is a very good hint. Thanks a lot.
But is sadly does not work :(

I started pvdataserver like this:
	mpirun --mca mpi_yield_when_idle 1 -np 4 ./pvdataserver
and still see three processes with 100% cpu, while no-one is connected.

This happens on a Dell R805 (2xAMD QuadCore-Opteron) with CentOS 5.2,
OpenMPI 1.2.8 and Paraview 3.4.0 - all compiled with Intel 11.0.

Greetings
Jens

Hi Paul,

I read the following on open-mpi-mailinglist:

"One issue is that "yield" might mean "yield if there is someone else
ready to run".  Like a traffic sign:  if someone else is there, you
yield.  If no one else is there, there's no way to tell that someone is
yielding.
Next, even if someone else is trying to run, "yield" doesn't give up the
CPU 100%.  It's still rather pesky."

so, to make is short: this is no solution :(

Greetings
Jens

Is it possible that your csv file has a blank line at the end?

Anyways, currently there's currently no direct way of visualizing the
data read in by CSV except in the spreadsheet view to simply look at
the raw data (or plots in CVS paraview). You'll have to write a python
programmable filter or source. Look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.
The first example illustrates reading a CSV as a set of points.

I tracked this down and you are right. When reading EnSight files (not
sos), all processes read the whole dataset and then each one extracts
a piece. If you submit a request at http://paraview.org/Bug, we can
address this issue in the future.

Subject: [Paraview] Temporal Redesign
Message-ID: <493D7551.3060705@cscs.ch>

I made a few changes to TemporalShiftScale and SnapToTimeStep last week 
which had unfortunate repercussions for the TemporalFractal test.

I've spent some time going over the executives and various classes which 
make use of TemporalData and I would like to make some changes to the 
whole temporal framework...

Problems : The main problem with the temporal design as it stands is 
that it is very difficult to know when a filter has got the right input 
or output when temporal looping is involved. The problem is largely 
caused by the TemporalDataSetAlgorithm Family. These classes export a 
TemporalDataSet directly, and it isn't possible to know what kind of 
datatype they have inside the collection.

Consider the case of the failing TemporalFractal Test.
A TemporalFractal class exports TemporalDataSet. Currently, this can 
only be connected to another class which takes TemporalData as input. 
Even if it only exports a single timestep, which may be uniform grid, or 
rectilinear, or even a hierarchy of either (Multiblock etc)

We would like the Executive to take temporal data and loop it for non 
temporal filters, but we can't connect a non temporal filter to it and 
get it right- because when the filters are connected together and first 
executed, the RequestDataObject pass for the filter accepting the 
TemporalDataSet doesn't know what type of output to create -  we fudged 
around this by simply exporting a temporal dataset too (which is why 
snap and shift scale were TemporalAlgorithms (and they should not be, 
they do not change the type of data passing through them). There are 
several bugs existing 
(http://public.kitware.com/mantis/view.php?id=6662) which all stem from 
the problem that the executive needs to take a single dataset from a 
temporal collection and pass it into a non temporal filter - currently 
it just doesn't do it and we see the output of a filter change to 
temporal within the paraview gui and various other side effects once 
temporal stuff is initiated.

I'd am going to remove the whole TemporalDataSetAlgorithm family and 
instead have filters which declare themselves as (say) 
UniformGrid/Image/PolyData algorithms (or even multiblock), but export a 
new information key which says "I support temporal" if they are capable 
of delivering multiple time steps. Filters which require temporal 
collectios of type X, will add a key requesting time.

The advantages of this are
a) Filters will export a defined 'type', which other filters and the gui 
will be aware of, so temporal filters exporting polydata will be 
distinct from temporal filters exporting imagedata and so on. The user 
can then also write a filter which requires N Polydata and not any other 
type, currently the pipeline connects all temporal classes without checks.
b) The checks in the executive will be simpler. A filter needs temporal 
data, but the upstream pipeline exports simple, so loop. When a filter 
needs simple, but upstream has declared time support, we take the i'th 
dataset on iteration i (or more correctly, the dataset with timestamp=t).
c) Filters which support temporal activity (exporting more than one 
dataset) as in b) above can have their output dataobjects replaced by 
the executive and fill the N steps as before. We replace the code in the 
existing CheckDataObject() method which currently is incorrect (temporal 
IsA(composite) always returns true and causes untold trouble) and solve 
most of the outstanding temporal problems in one place (almost). 
Effectively we have, if filter supports temporal output and more than 
one steps were requested. change it - . If filter requires temporal and 
only one step exists, create temporal - the rest of the time, stop 
messing about. The current dataset swapping logic is a mess.
d) existing filters(readers mainly) can be updated to support temporal 
natively with a pretty simple strategy. Add the temporal support flag, 
and in request data, generate N steps if required, and place them in the 
output. Much easier than the current option of creating a new class 
derived from TemporalDataSetAlgorithm and instantiating a reader inside 
it. (I'm talking here about generating multiple time steps from an 
existing reader - the executive can loop for you, but if you have a 
sophisticated file format, reading N at once can be desirable...)

The changes the users will notice are
vtkTemporalDataSetAlgorithm is removed, instead, filters which can 
/supply /multiple steps place an extra key TEMPORAL_OUTPUT_SUPPORTED in 
FillOutputInformation
Filters which /require /multiple timesteps will place 
TEMPORAL_INPUT_REQUIRED during the FillInputInformation call. (Here' I 
think we might enhance the paraview GUI to allow a temporal input domain 
so that you can only instantiate temporal filters when connected to 
filters which are capable of supplying it). Filters such as temporal 
interpolator, become dataobject algorithms, likewise temporalcache.

I believe this will solve a great many problems, though I have not 
considered the effect on TEMPORAL_FAST_PATH so please get back to me if 
this is going to be a problem.

I will be working on this on the back burner until the new year no 
doubt, when I hope I have everything in order. The changes I have 
outlined above are of course subject to change as I encounter problems 
I've not considered. Please get in touch if you have strong feelings 
about this.

In the meantime, would you revert your change so we can otherwise approach
green on the VTK dashboard?
It seemed to be largely getting closer to green for about two weeks up till
that change and it would be nice to see the progress instead of having
TemporalFractal test failing everywhere it runs for the next several weeks.

Thanks,

Unfortunately not.

You should look at the Xdmf (xdmf.org) format. It supports some of
what you want.

Hi Berk,

Thanks for your answer, I will file a bug. When you say that each one 
extracts a piece do you mean that it partitions the data, or that each 
one reads a different predefined block ? In my case I would need it to 
repartition the data.

This is currently not supported. It shouldn't be too hard to

Subject: [Paraview] hyperstreamline visualization
Message-ID: <fac5e9bb0812090655r2d77b33fp72ebcf9c387eda8f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ParaView user,


Having stress tensor in VTK file, I would like to visualize them.

Different solutions may exist:


1). For instance, evaluate the principal components (vectors) from stress
tensor and use the 'stream tracer' filter to visualize each principal
component individually. However, in the 'Calculator' filter, I see neither
'extract principal component' function, nor the possibility to interact with
tensor at all: only the access to scalars and vectors is allowed.
Could you confirm me this?


2). Another actually much more interesting way would be to use the
Hyperstreamline method available in the VTK library (
http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.2/html/a00565.html). Nonetheless, I don't
see the equivalent filter in ParaView.
Is there a way to 'activate' it simply in ParaView?
Or should an external filter be developped (based on the existing VTK
class)?


I thank youfor your help!
Regards


Pierre

Subject: [Paraview] Parameters for Programmable Filter
Message-ID: <68E6DDCE37821E429FEA595B7FAC4FF6067E0811E6@srvmes03.spe-ch-md9.net>

Hello,

I have a problem with user-defined parameters for the "Programmable Filter".

In my case, I wrote a filter using the "Programmable Filter", then this filter is grouped with some others using the "Create Custom Filter".
My problem is that the programmable filter requires a parameter to be defined by the user. This parameter is nothing but a Python variable.
What I did was to add the entire script to the custom filter so that it can be modified, but this exposes the entire script and makes it more difficult for a user to understand what to do.

Is there a preferred location for such user parameter?

Thanks,
-Marzio

Actually, looking at it further, I found that it does not do any
extraction. If it did, it would repartition each block among
processors. I don't have a lot of time to experiment with this now but
I think I know how to fix it. If you look at
vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx in VTK/IO and add

  vtkInformation* info = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
  info->Set(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), 1);

to the end of the RequestInformation() method, it should start
partitioning datasets. We still have to change the code so that the
same file is not read multiple times, which is a serious performance
issue.

This is a feature we need to implement. I hope to have it in 3.6. Can
you please file a feature request in http://paraview.org/Bug and let
me know.
The programmable filter should have a way of specifying a list of
parameters that can then be exposed through the custom filter object
inspector.

I can't remember if I answered this question. The only way of not
getting the window is to compile ParaView with Mesa offscreen support
on Linux. Otherwise, you have to live with the annoyance of the
window. It is OK to send that window to the background or even
minimize it though.

Two questions:

1. Is this the paraview binary from the website?
2. Do you by any chance have an old ParaView installation in your
PATH? We had a bug in our installation program that added ParaView to

Subject: [Paraview] Parameters for Programmable Filter

Berk,

I submitted a bug report, see http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=8268.

The Programmable Filter is a very nice tool. Beside the bug report, I have a couple of suggestions for possible enhancements:

It may help to have a "Load" and a "Save" button for loading/saving the script. Once the script works, I save it and set the pythonpath variable, but while developing it may be easier to just load from an external file.

Another feature that in my opinion could help is the following. The output of the filter is reported in the "Output Messages" window, which pops up. This window can be visualized using "Tools" > "Output Window". Should this output window be available as another "view", then one could use it to print messages that are not error messages from the Programmable Filter. For example, the user may list the FieldData() or other statistics (integrals, block names, min/max), or simply write a "filter OK" at the end of the computation.

This is a feature we need to implement. I hope to have it in 3.6. Can you please file a feature request in http://paraview.org/Bug and let me know.
The programmable filter should have a way of specifying a list of parameters that can then be exposed through the custom filter object inspector.

Message-ID: <564001.65950.qm@web110106.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey ParaView Comunity,

I have a plugin which implements a custom Object Panel, and I need to get the id's of the nodes of a selection.

What I want to do is exactly what the filter "Plot Selection Over Time" does: retrieve a list of the id's of the points of the current selection. I searched in the ParaView dir for the class corresponding to this filter, but I couldn't find ! 

How can I do this ?

Thanks in advance,
Rafael March.

Look at Qt/Components/pqExtractSelectionsPanel.h|cxx
That's the panel that's created for "Plot Selection Over Time" filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Export polydata and texture map in vtk file for viewing
	in paraview
Message-ID: <20081210193441.CC08583985@ws1-2a.us4.outblaze.com>

Hi, I would like some advice regarding displaying a 2D slice of scalar
data on a structured grid in a 3D scene containing polydata using
Paraview.

I have a 2D slice of data from an FE analysis which with I want to view
in Paraview. I want to view it on a 2D plane within a 3D 'scene'
consisting of 3D polydata. For example I have a vehicle placed in the
center of the scene which is imported from a .vtp file I have created. I
have analysis results on a plane through the centre of the vehicle. This
is scalar data on a 2D structured grid. I want to be able to import the
vehicle model in .vtp format and import the analysis results in a
standard vtk format and view both.

The analysis data I have in an vtkimagedata object. One solution is to
use the geometry filter and create polydata and write this to a .vtp
file. e.g. (assuming the image data is stored in *id);

vtkImageDataGeometryFilter *idf = vtkImageDataGeometryFilter::New();
idf->SetInput(id);

vtkXMLPolyDataWriter *writer = vtkXMLPolyDataWriter::New();
writer->SetInput(idf->GetOutput());
writer->SetFileName(fname.c_str());
writer->Write();

For large data sets the visualisation is slow. What I really want to do
is create a plane and texture map the analysis data onto it. I can create
a plane with texture coords and export this separately as a .vtp file. I
can also export the image data as an image file (png/jpeg etc.). In
paraview I can then open the .vtp file containing the plane with texture
coords and then apply the texture by reading in the image. 

However, can I do this using a single file? Is there a way to have the
texture mapped polydata and texture in one file so that when it is opened
you see the texture mapped polydata? Have I gone  about this all wrong?
Any better ideas as to how I do this?

Many Thanks,

JM

Hi,

We are thinking of purchasing a new viz cluster -up to a maximum of 128 (but
possibly less) number of
processors.  We mainly use Paraview and Visit for our needs.

Can you give some advice on your experience on the type of machine you use,
and anything we should avoid?
Apologies in advance, if this is not directly related to you.

Take a look at: http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_27539.html

Although this cluster is now older, it has served Sandia folks well.
In my mind, the most important things are: reliability, fast network
with a good MPI implementation and fast parallel file system.

In 3.4, if you load a 2D image and show it using the Slice
representation, ParaView will use texture map automatically. So you
shouldn't need to do anything but load the image data directly.

Hi all,

Following a previous email, the CreateRepresenation(view, textsource)
command does not seem to work for me in python.

The following though works :

legend =
servermanager.sources.TextSource(registrationGroup='sources',registationName='legend')
legend.Text = "BLABLA BLA"

legendrep = servermanager.rendering.TextSourceRepresentation()
legendrep.Input = legend

legendrep.UpdateVTKObjects()

view.Representations.append(legendrep)


Any explanations ?

Ah...that seems to be a  bug. CreateRepresentation() should have
handled that case. Can you please add a bug report to the bug tracker
so that we can address this in the next release.

Thanks

Message-ID: <ce5dae9f0812110725q2f62846ewd56352f29adb22fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I notice that generating isosurfaces in my volume data is very slow. I now
generate first a threshold around my isosurface and then generate the
isosurface --  this works much faster. Is this something that should be done
automatically in the contour filter ?

Sad but apparently true. Maybe you want to add a feature request. It
should
really not be that hard as XML is hirarchical.

We solved the issue by implementing a reader plugin for our format
(which is written in a own HDF5 dialect).

This has limitations, therefore I'm still interested in exporting
parview data.

I believe that an extension of the VTK and Paraview (pvd) file format can
only come from kiteware to make it a standard.

I just wrote out the dataset "can.exo", as an Exodus dataset.  I then read it back in, and it remains a multiblock dataset.  The Exodus writer is only available on the trunk, however, and will be released this spring as ParaView 3.6.

Message-ID: <ce5dae9f0812111039x7fe3138aifd413971b73ff7f6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have a 100 million point connected graph (No cell information - only
points and edges and boundaries defined by certain points and edges)  that I
would like to visualize. I would like to be able to load it in parallel and
post-process it in parallel. I would like to do things like streamlines /
surface contours on the boundaries of the graph etc... Also I would like it
to have groups (or blocks) for the different surfaces in the graph. Is there
any way of doing this with ParaView ? Is there a certain class / algorithm
that can accomodate this type of data structure ?
Thank you !
Jacques

Sandia National Labs and Kitware are in the midst of making it
possible to store and process very large graphs in distributed memory
using vtkGraph and the Parallel Boost Graph Library. Some of this is
currently in VTK, but it is not yet incorporated into ParaView. Your
other choice which may work for you is to use vtkPolyData with line
cells, since some of the operations you are talking about exist in
ParaView for polygonal geometry, although I don't know the exact
sequence of filters you would need for your use case. ParaView also
has the notion of multi-block data sets which can group assoicated
data sets into one object.

Your choices are limited, I am afraid:

* Exodus - unstructured, homogeneous (same element type) blocks only
* Plot3D - curvilinear structured blocks with pressure, velocity, energy only

Xdmf is another choice but has two files (xml and hdf5). I think we
need to develop a good reader for CGNS.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin with Qt 4.4, but Paraview binaries with 4.3 ?
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0812112356o3f69a7deg59d3e9345b4db2f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Thanks to the mailing list, I compiled successfully a number of
plugins for paraview 3.4. Today, the version of Qt is 4.4, and
everything goes well on my different computers (Fedora 9 and Win XP
SP3).

Now, I want to distribute my plugins on 'non-development' config, that
is, with the website-available binaries of ParaView 3.4.
When loading the plugin, I got a message '... is not a valid Qt
plugin'. Then I tried different built settings (Release/Debug),
without success.

I think that the downloadable binaries are built with Qt-4.3, not 4.4
-that justifies the cmake warning-, and maybe this is the source of
the problem.
- Can someone tell me if I am wrong ?
- Have I to distribute my own ParaView built or is there a hack for that ?
- If I have to downgrade Qt to 4.3, where can I find the MS Windows package ?

Thanks for your time,

J?r?me

Hi J?r?me,

The plugin has to be built against a paraview build that uses the same
libraries that the paraview release build was built against.

The list of libraries/versions that Berk used to build the releases is here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries

Old (including 4.3.5) versions of Qt can be found here:
ftp://ftp.trolltech.no/qt/source/

cheers,

As per Berk yesterday, the area around Kitware was in a massive ice storm Friday.  The employees had stayed home.  It is probable that either the computers and/or connectivity are down.  I would expect that things will not be back until Monday at the earliest.

Thank you,

I noticed activity a year ago in terms of linking BGL and VTK, but I have
never seen examples of how to use it. Maybe I'll give the polydata thing a
try.

Hi,
Yes Jerome I have the same problem. It seems that you must compile your
plugin with the same version of QT as the version of paraview you are going
to use it with. I also noticed that sometimes if you don't use the same
compiler it doesn't seem to work (but that may be just because I changed
versions of libstdc++.
Concerning downloading the correct version of QT they are all
available here<ftp://ftp.trolltech.no/qt/source/>
.

By curiosity what kind of plugins have you developed ?

Subject: [Paraview] SubProxy/ProxyProperty
Message-ID: <494622B2.6000703@cscs.ch>

I'm making some changes to the particle tracer, which allow a 
TerminationStrategy and an InjectionStrategy to be set. These are small 
classes which act s helpers to the particle tracer to decide when to 
kill off particles etc.

If I define these as classes and setup xml descriptions of them in 
utilities.xml they seem to satisfy the compilation and instantiation 
requirements of paraview.

But

When I attempt to create the GUI for the particle tracer, I tried 
setting a ProxyProperty referring to the strategy class, and nothing 
appears in the GUI, so I tried setting it as a SubProxy within the 
Particle tracer XML. It also did not make anything ppear in the GUI.

1) Can I instantiate the GUI part of the proxy object automatically - 
the only other classes whic do something similar are the cut/clip etc 
using widgets as sub proxies
2) Specifically - what is the difference between declaring a subproxy 
(=TerminationStrategy) or a ProxyProperty (=TerminationStrategy). When 
should one use one, or the other.

The Strategy has a number of simple int/double parameters so ought to be 
easy to instantiate easily. How's it done?

thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview/Kitware site down
Message-ID: <E05ABC9A7FBFB942B70D7533AF5BE68D02A3DF83@augexmsg001.euro.corp.dir>

I've been thinking about this for quite some time, but the website(s)
being down prompted me to finally post it.

I know that Paraview and VTK have been using cvs for a very long time,
but perhaps it might be time to consider migrating to a more modern
source code management (SCM) system - for example, git.
At the moment (with the cvs repository being down), a vital point of git
is that it is a truly distributed SCM. With git it's possible to have
mirrored sites (eg, http://repo.or.cz) at no extra cost. And it is also
possible to continue to work and commit on a personal local branch
without the reference repository being online at all.

There are, of course, a huge number of other advantages, but rather than
rehash everything I'll just give two urls:

  http://versioncontrolblog.com/comparison/CVS/Git/index.html
  http://whygitisbetterthanx.com

The second site (despite the name) does provide objective numbers in the
comparison and also gives a good quick overview of a few types of
workflows possible with git. Since the Linux kernel is managed with git,
presumably Paraview/VTK should not pose a problem.

Even if the developers wish to continue with cvs, a git mirror would be
possible. Here is a posting about how the emacs cvs has been mirrored to
git:
  http://www.mail-archive.com/emacs-pretest-bug at gnu.org/msg12529.html

Having local access to the cvs repository would certainly be a huge
advantage when creating the initial git mirror.  Another alternative
would be to start with a "big bang" and simply freeze the cvs repository
at a particular point and start with git as of a particular snapshot. It
would, of course, be better (and nicer) if either of these were
officially sanctioned by Kitware.

How much willingness would there be for modernizing the SCM used?

Subject: [Paraview] O
Message-ID: <825993.13149.qm@web110104.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey all,

I'm programming a filter with a custom Object Panel,
and I'm feeling a little bit lost about the ParaView architecture and
code design. 

My great problem is the comunication between the
Object Panel and the Model. I know I can't have a pointer to my
vtkUnstructuredGrid displayed, 'cause they are not necessarily at the
same machine or process. I also know that I'm able to send information
to the model through properties, since I can get the vtkSMProxy in my
panel. But what about the way back ? Is there a way to send information
from the display view to the panel ? How can I display in a QTable, for
instance, the nodes of my model which have some property equals to 1 ? 

Another problem is the Visualization Pipeline: is there a way to "walk" on it ?
I mean, if I have a filter name, am I able to get the
 the filter no
matter where it is in the Pipeline ? How to get, for instance, the ids
of the nodes which are displayed after the application of a filter to
the model ?

Sorry for the mess with the questions. I hope I made it clear and someone can help me ! :)

Regards,
Rafael March.

Yes, for that you need to use the <ProxyListDomain /> with proxies as
speicifed for "CutFunction" property of the Cut filter, for example.
However, the proxies set as the values for the proxy property are not
subproxies. They cannot be subproxies since subproxies are not exposed
to the external world at all. So no property that can be changed by
the user or that  gets saved in state files should ever refer to a
subproxy.

The deciding criteria in choosing between a proxy property and a
subproxy is whether the user is going to set/change the that value.
Eg. in Cut, we want want the user to choose the type of CutFunction to
use, hence it's a property. While in case of any of the 3D widget
proxies, the choice of which representation/widget proxy to create is
not for the user to decide and hence they are subproxies. Whenever you
have a proxy that has subproxies, more often than not, you'd need some
C++ code to connect the subproxy into the pipeline (or you can use
Custom Filters (vtkSMCompoundSourceProxy)).
You can "expose" properties from subproxies so that the user can
simply change them as if they were properties of the outer proxy
itself.

Thanks for the quick reply. I am not quite sure what you mean. 

I have written out my image data from a vtkImageData object using 
vtkXMLImageDataWriter to a .vti file. 

I have written my polydata out using vtkXMLPolyDataWriter to a .vtp file.

The image data is orientated and locate such that it is a plane through the 
centre of the polydata model (which is a vehicle). 

If I open the files in Paraview (v3.4) it opens the image data in a separate 
window to the polydata. The image data cannot by rotated, just panned in 2D. I 
see options for 'slices' but not sure what I can do with them to solve this 
problem.

Hopefully I've explained the problem reasonably well.

Thanks Utkarsh , as usual you are a veritable fountain of wisdom for the 
internals.

I have this in utilities

  <ProxyGroup name="particletracerstrategies">
    <Proxy name="SimpleTerminationStrategy"
           class="vtkTemporalStreamTracerTerminationStrategy">
     
      <DoubleVectorProperty

        <DoubleRangeDomain name="range"/>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>

    <blah blah snip snip>

    </Proxy>
  </ProxyGroup>

and this for i the particletracer xml

      <ProxyProperty name="TerminationStrategy"
                     command="SetTerminationStrategy"
                     label="Termination Strategy">
        <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
          <Proxy group="particletracerstrategies"

        <Documentation>
          Set the Strategy for Termination of particles
        </Documentation>
      </ProxyProperty>

It appears to be trying to set the strategy as a string. It tells me 
that setTerminationStrategy is called with the wrong arguments. I was 
hoping it'd create an object of type 
vtkTemporalStreamTracerTerminationStrategy and set that directly.
I have not specified a ProxyGroupDomain - can I force it to be an object 
by doing that? (Also, the GUI doesn't create the individual properties 
for the strategy itself)

Got any more clues?

Thanks

Hmm...ProxyGroupDomain is not essential in this case. Is this a custom
panel or an auto generated panel? Can you post the error message you
are getting about the method not found, maybe that'll help.

John,

I'm still trying to catch up on my email, so I may not have read this completely correctly.  One thing I did not quite catch is how a filter could "declare" it work with data of a particular type but then work with temporal data.  An algorithm "declares" its output type in REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT where it looks at the type of the object created for its input (if applicable) and creates a data object of its own for its output.  If a temporally-enabled filter creates an output of type, say, unstructured grid, and then needs to output a temporal data set, then who makes the temporal data set and who creates the objects to populate it?  I fear the answer includes a byzantine sequence of data object creations and deletions with perhaps odd requests sent to the algorithm.

It might work better if REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT was not used to determine data type but rather the information reported in FillInput/OutputPortInformation.  It could also be handy to say "I don't know the type yet."  That kind of change might have a profound impact on the existing pipeline classes and algorithms, though.  Especially for the imaging pipeline.

On 12/8/08 12:28 PM, "John Biddiscombe" <biddisco at cscs.ch> wrote:

I made a few changes to TemporalShiftScale and SnapToTimeStep last week which had unfortunate repercussions for the TemporalFractal test.

I've spent some time going over the executives and various classes which make use of TemporalData and I would like to make some changes to the whole temporal framework...

Problems : The main problem with the temporal design as it stands is that it is very difficult to know when a filter has got the right input or output when temporal looping is involved. The problem is largely caused by the TemporalDataSetAlgorithm Family. These classes export a TemporalDataSet directly, and it isn't possible to know what kind of datatype they have inside the collection.

Consider the case of the failing TemporalFractal Test.
A TemporalFractal class exports TemporalDataSet. Currently, this can only be connected to another class which takes TemporalData as input. Even if it only exports a single timestep, which may be uniform grid, or rectilinear, or even a hierarchy of either (Multiblock etc)

We would like the Executive to take temporal data and loop it for non temporal filters, but we can't connect a non temporal filter to it and get it right- because when the filters are connected together and first executed, the RequestDataObject pass for the filter accepting the TemporalDataSet doesn't know what type of output to create -  we fudged around this by simply exporting a temporal dataset too (which is why snap and shift scale were TemporalAlgorithms (and they should not be, they do not change the type of data passing through them). There are several bugs existing (http://public.kitware.com/mantis/view.php?id=6662) which all stem from the problem that the executive needs to take a single dataset from a temporal collection and pass it into a non temporal filter - currently it just doesn't do it and we see the output of a filter change to temporal within the paraview gui and various other side effects once temporal stuff is initiated.

I'd am going to remove the whole TemporalDataSetAlgorithm family and instead have filters which declare themselves as (say) UniformGrid/Image/PolyData algorithms (or even multiblock), but export a new information key which says "I support temporal" if they are capable of delivering multiple time steps. Filters which require temporal collectios of type X, will add a key requesting time.

The advantages of this are
a) Filters will export a defined 'type', which other filters and the gui will be aware of, so temporal filters exporting polydata will be distinct from temporal filters exporting imagedata and so on. The user can then also write a filter which requires N Polydata and not any other type, currently the pipeline connects all temporal classes without checks.
b) The checks in the executive will be simpler. A filter needs temporal data, but the upstream pipeline exports simple, so loop. When a filter needs simple, but upstream has declared time support, we take the i'th dataset on iteration i (or more correctly, the dataset with timestamp=t).
c) Filters which support temporal activity (exporting more than one dataset) as in b) above can have their output dataobjects replaced by the executive and fill the N steps as before. We replace the code in the existing CheckDataObject() method which currently is incorrect (temporal IsA(composite) always returns true and causes untold trouble) and solve most of the outstanding temporal problems in one place (almost). Effectively we have, if filter supports temporal output and more than one steps were requested. change it - . If filter requires temporal and only one step exists, create temporal - the rest of the time, stop messing about. The current dataset swapping logic is a mess.
d) existing filters(readers mainly) can be updated to support temporal natively with a pretty simple strategy. Add the temporal support flag, and in request data, generate N steps if required, and place them in the output. Much easier than the current option of creating a new class derived from TemporalDataSetAlgorithm and instantiating a reader inside it. (I'm talking here about generating multiple time steps from an existing reader - the executive can loop for you, but if you have a sophisticated file format, reading N at once can be desirable...)

The changes the users will notice are
vtkTemporalDataSetAlgorithm is removed, instead, filters which can supply multiple steps place an extra key TEMPORAL_OUTPUT_SUPPORTED in FillOutputInformation
Filters which require multiple timesteps will place TEMPORAL_INPUT_REQUIRED during the FillInputInformation call. (Here' I think we might enhance the paraview GUI to allow a temporal input domain so that you can only instantiate temporal filters when connected to filters which are capable of supplying it). Filters such as temporal interpolator, become dataobject algorithms, likewise temporalcache.

I believe this will solve a great many problems, though I have not considered the effect on TEMPORAL_FAST_PATH so please get back to me if this is going to be a problem.

I will be working on this on the back burner until the new year no doubt, when I hope I have everything in order. The changes I have outlined above are of course subject to change as I encounter problems I've not considered. Please get in touch if you have strong feelings about this.

You can view a 2D image in a 3D view by simply selecting the 3D view (clicking on it so that the red boarder is around it) and then clicking the eyeball next to the image data.  You can get rid of the 2D view by clicking the X just above and at the right side of the 2D view.

The image data is orientated and locate such that it is a plane through the

If I open the files in Paraview (v3.4) it opens the image data in a separate

We actually have an internal git that tracks the ParaView cvs. Some us
(including me) has been using it for a while now.  It is not totally
issue free (mostly due to the cvs-git bridge) so we don't plan to make
it public. I suspect that we will move to svn at one point and
possibly provide a git repository that tracks it so that people can do
the initial clone. After that, git-svn works very well. We don't have
any plans to completely move to git as it is not as Windows friendly
as we would like. All Windows ports of git require the installation of
some sort of Unix-like layer and are also very slow.

When in desktop delivery mode, ParaView does not make any effort to show
rendering results, so the windows might not behave as expected.  If you want
to be sure that pvserver can create windows on each display, you can start
it in tiled display mode.  Add the argments -tdx=3 -tdy=1 to pvserver.  If
you do not see a window opened on each display, there is genuinely a
problem.  Otherwise, pvserver is probably working fine.

I feel rather stupid for not realising that, thanks for the advice. Ideally 
I'd like to turn off this default behaviour open it in a 3D window.

I am still interested in the original question though, is it possible to 
package polydata and a texture map in a single file so when it is opened you 
see textured mapped geometry, rather than having to import the polydata with 
texture coords and then apply a texture through the display tab?

  Hi

  Before it worked fine, now it doesn't.

  I've checked out paraview from cvs in two machines, one 32 bit, the other 
64. Both Linux, debian, testing.

  I had done this before and everything worked fine. My options are MPI, 
PYTHON, shared libs on, and RPATH OFF.

  In the 32 bit machine everything works fine.

  In the 64 bit I get this message:

   /usr/local/paraviewcvs/lib/paraview-3.5/paraview-real: error while 
loading shared libraries: libvtkalglib.so: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory

  Any ideas or needed output/logs to track and solve the problem? If I run 
paraview from the build directory everything works fine, if it runs from 
the directory were I installed it it fails with the above message.

  ideas?

Hey all,

I'm programming a filter with a custom Object Panel,
and I'm feeling a little bit lost about the ParaView architecture and
code design. 

My great problem is the comunication between the
Object Panel and the Model. I know I can't have a pointer to my
vtkUnstructuredGrid displayed, 'cause they are not necessarily at the
same machine or process. I also know that I'm able to send information
to the model through properties, since I can get the vtkSMProxy in my
panel. But what about the way back ? Is there a way to send information
from the display view to the panel ? How can I display in a QTable, for
instance, the nodes of my model which have some property equals to 1 ? 

Another problem is the Visualization Pipeline: is there a way to "walk" on it ?
I mean, if I have a filter name, am I able to get the
 the filter no
matter where it is in the Pipeline ? How to get, for instance, the ids
of the nodes which are displayed after the application of a filter to
the model ?

Sorry for the mess with the questions. I hope I made it clear and someone can help me ! :)

Regards,
Rafael March.

Since bin/paraview finds paraview-real, it would seem that the
lib/paraview-X.X directory is actually there.

Did you attempt to install to the same directory as your build
directory?  This is where I've encounter the same problem before.

If you just edit the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH in CMakeCache.txt (in the
build dir) and try 'make install' again.

No, I'm using a diferent dir and when I do "make install" he puts stuff 
there.

I have this in my CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local/paraviewcvs.shared

so this is not the problem, it seems...

Should I atach my CMakeCache.txt ?

Ricardo,

Update your cvs and try again please. This is a new library that was
missing install rules. It should be fixed.

To get back "values" from the server, you can use either "information
properties" or "information objects".

Information properties are properites with information_only="1" set in
the XML (eg. in Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml the
"Camera" proxy has "CameraPositionInfo" as an information property).
Such properties need an "InformationHelper" which knows how to obtain
the values from the server. For simple Get*() methods, you can use the
<SimpleDoubleInformationHelper/> or <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
etc. based on the type of the property. Complex information helpers
can be written as well. Look at TimeStepsInformationHelper
(vtkSMTimeStepsInformationHelper.h|cxx) as an example.

Information objects are used to get data from server which cannot be
simply put in a property for example information about the data object
produced by a filter (vtkPVDataInformation). These are
vtkPVInformation subclasses. You can create you own vtkPVInformation
subclass that knows how to collect information and then
serialize/deserialize it for transfer to the client from the server
(if needed). To gather such information, one uses
vtkProcessModule::GatherInformation(vtkIdType connectionID,
vtkTypeUInt32 serverFlags, vtkPVInformation* info, vtkClientServerID
id) where "id" is vtkSMProxy::GetID() returned for the proxy from
which you want to collect the information.

In your case, information property may be an easier solution -- if I
understand your problem correctly.

There is a pqServerManagerModel instance accessible as
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel() that can be
used to access sources/filters their representations, views etc. Take
a look at Qt/Core/pqServerManagerModel.h for the API. That should help
you access the visualization pipeline.

"How to get, for instance, the ids of the nodes which are displayed
after the application of a filter to the model ?"
Not sure I understand what you mean by that. Can you please elaborate?

Subject: [Paraview] Plugins deployment with external lib: Windows wants
	STATIC ?
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0812160718t352c2cc9te2ea5fe761a5ef42@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am writing plugins under Fedora that need to be run on Windows. I
have to link the plugin to another lib, let's say myGenericLib,
included in the project. With Linux, I have to build a SHARED lib.

#######
CMake generates myGenericLib through:

ADD_LIBRARY( myGenericLib SHARED file cxx file.h )
TARGET_LINK( myGenericLib vtkIO vtkFiltering and_so_one )
If not (that is, if I use a STATIC fashion), I get a link error.

########
CMake generates the plugin project through:

 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(
   Extensions          #<--Name for the plugin
  "1.0"                        #<--Version string
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML Extensions.xml  #<-- server manager xml
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ${PLUGINS_SRCS}
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES ExtensionsGUI.xml
 )

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES( Extensions myGenericLib )

But when I build with ms-visual2008 express with SHARED, the plugin
compiles but ParaView tells "... is not a valid Qt plugin". I have to
build myGenericLib as STATIC if I want my plugin to load and work
well.

Obviously, I can put an IF statement in my CMakeList in order to
handle different plateform. My question is more 'theoritical': why
have I to change the way the external lib is built switch the platform
?

Many thanks !

regards,
Jerome

Hi Berk,

While we're somewhat on the topic of installing, I would like to get some tips about the correct means of building/installing a portable version of paraview.

I currently have "make", "make HTMLDocumentation", "make install" with the build directories and install directories being different (same issue as Ricardo). I would like to be able to move all the sources about later, but also need to retain the build directory (to build plugins at a later stage).

Is it safe to have identical build/install directories?
If I wish to move my files about after the initial compilation (eg from a local disk to an NFS-share), what is the best means of doing this without recompiling everything? I tried editing the *.cmake files to use environment variables. This helps find relocated things (I think), but also provokes an unnecessary remake.

How do you go about bundling things like this?

Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAF0V88snc7NDnLzKjZ+tgCrCgAAAEAAAAMBOuNKiehxDvB/LMlHVG5MBAAAAAA==@ara.co.uk>

Hi all, 

I have two plugins for Paraview that used to work fine with ParaView 3.2
under linux (I used to build them at the same time as ParaView.)
Now I am using Visual Studio and have compiled the plugins outside of
paraview. I am able to generate dll for both the server and client plugins.
(I had to switch the vtkIO_EXPORTS flag on to build the dlls)
When I launch paraview, only the client side is loaded and when I try to
load the server side it fails with the message : " * is not a valid Qt
plugin" ... 
I have found some threads dealing with this but nothing that I can try. 
I have built ParaView and my plugins against the same version of Qt (4.4.3)
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Jacques

Ricardo,

	As Berk mentions, install rules have been added. Can you say exactly
when your had a checkout that was working and when you updated and it
stopped working? I added vtkalglib to VTK 2008-12-04 15:57:36 GMT and
added the install rule 2008-12-15 23:12:04 GMT. Depending on when things
stopped working, I may have more to fix.

	Thanks,
	David

We are working on creating a separate install target that will install
all development dependencies. Once that is done, you should be able to
do something like "make install_development" and then use those files.

Odd that only one of the two plugins get loaded.  Perhaps the server plugin is missing some symbols.  Try running the depends program on it and make sure it can find all of the dependent dlls.  Also make sure that the server manager initialization function is properly exported (I think it's called @PLUGIN_NAME at _Initialize).

You could also try wrapping the client and server code into the same plugin (with checks to dump the client code when the GUI is not built).  I have never liked the idea of having separate client & server plugins; they make loading the plugin more cumbersome and confusing rather than helpful.

That sounds similar to a bug that Pat Marion fixed for the Streaming
ParaView plugin under windows. His change that fixed it was this:

Everything is working fine now :) Last time I checkout (and it didn't 
work) was last night I think.

Ok,

I removed the EXPORTS macro in my header, and it produces the same as
setting the flag vtkIO_EXPORTS. The library is still not loaded though. So
now I'm looking at the dependencies and the Initialize function.

Kenneth, how do I go about "making sure that the server manager
initialization function is properly exported" ? I'm not sure I really
understand what you mean ?

Thanks
Jacques

I am trying to visualize a data set with 500,000 vertices using pv 3.4.0 
without success.

1-step 1: I start the server with this script
--------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#PBS -N "Paraview_32"
#PBS -l "nodes=16:nef:ppn=2"
#PBS -l "walltime=4:00:00"
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
server=`hostname`

ulimit -s unlimited

echo "The server is listening on host $server "
#/usr/local/bin/mpiexec2 /usr/local/paraview/bin/pvserver 
--use-offscreen-rendering

mpiexec --comm=mpich2 /home/install/paraview-340/bin/pvserver 
--use-offscreen-rendering

step 2: I identify which processor is listening on host
---------------------------------------------------------------

step 3: I open pv 3.4.0 on the client, enter the server name and host
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The files are read correctly on the client and the outline of the mesh 
can be seen on the client screen. When I try to visualize a solution 
field (points, wireframe, surface) I get the following error.

ERROR: In /tmp/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx,
line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x5df84f0): Server Connection Closed!

step 4: when I do on the server
------------------------------------------
ls -al /tmp/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx
I get
cannot access 
/tmp/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx: No such file 
or directory

step 5: If I copy all the vtu,...etc files to the client and open pv
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.0, we can visualize the same data with no
problems (the paraview server on the server is not used).

Can anyone help resolved the problem. I can send all the files to anyone 
who will help resolve the problem.
Thanks,
Stephen
p.s.
The above works correctly with a small mesh (43,000 vertices) using 
8-procs. The above was with a mesh (500,000 vertices)using 32-processors.

Are there any error messages outputted on the server side?
Can you try this:
When connected to the server and looking at the outline (which you say
is rendered fine) go to Edit|Settings. In the Options dialog open up
the "Render View" tree on the left pane and select "Server". There in
the "Remote Rendering Paramaters" group ensure that "Remote Render
Threshold" is set to 0 and checked. Now hit Ok. Does the outline still
render fine? If not I am guess there's some issue with rendering on
the server side.

The depends command (provided by MSVC) provides information on one dll both about the other libraries it depends on and the symbols (variables and functions) that it exports.  I believe the information is at the right at a bit below center in the GUI.  For a ParaView plugin, there are typically only one or two functions exported that provide the hooks to allow ParaView to load the plugin.

The thresh hold was by default 3 mb. When I set it to 0, the client 
crashes each time I try to establish a connection.

Thanks a lot Utkarsh,

I'm already testing and learning about the Information Properties, and I realized this is exactly what I need, concerning the Client/Server Communication.

Let me try to explain what I asked about the visualization pipeline: 
Suppose I have an unstructured grid.Then, my filter associate an integer number, from 0 to 6, to each cell, according to an algorithm. My filter also implements a custom object panel. Then I clip my model, through the Clip Filter. Is it possible to get the output of the Clip (that is, the nodes that weren't cutted off )from my custom filter code (which stays before the Clip filter in the pipeline) ?

Regards,
Rafael March.

To get back "values" from the server, you can use either
"information
properties" or "information objects".

Information properties are properites with information_only="1" set
in
the XML (eg. in Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml the
"Camera" proxy has "CameraPositionInfo" as an information
property).
Such properties need an "InformationHelper" which knows how to obtain
the values from the server. For simple Get*() methods, you can use the
<SimpleDoubleInformationHelper/> or <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
etc. based on the type of the property. Complex information helpers
can be written as well. Look at TimeStepsInformationHelper
(vtkSMTimeStepsInformationHelper.h|cxx) as an example.

Information objects are used to get data from server which cannot be
simply put in a property for example information about the data object
produced by a filter (vtkPVDataInformation). These are
vtkPVInformation subclasses. You can create you own vtkPVInformation
subclass that knows how to collect information and then
serialize/deserialize it for transfer to the client from the server
(if needed). To gather such information, one uses
vtkProcessModule::GatherInformation(vtkIdType connectionID,
vtkTypeUInt32 serverFlags, vtkPVInformation* info, vtkClientServerID
id) where "id" is vtkSMProxy::GetID() returned for the proxy from
which you want to collect the information.

In your case, information property may be an easier solution -- if I
understand your problem correctly.

There is a pqServerManagerModel instance accessible as
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel() that can be
used to access sources/filters their representations, views etc. Take
a look at Qt/Core/pqServerManagerModel.h for the API. That should help
you access the visualization pipeline.

"How to get, for instance, the ids of the nodes which are displayed
after the application of a filter to the model ?"
Not sure I understand what you mean by that. Can you please elaborate?

Subject: [Paraview] How to visualize multipart/multiblock models
Message-ID: <adb0f27a0812170812l6ee7c998wa5e8c4d27b3f1235@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to find a way to subdivide a structural analysis model in
several parts in such a way that I can post-process the results in Paraview.
The primary objective for me is to be able to hide and show different parts
of the structure. The model itself is not too large (say 50.000 cells). A
bonus for me would be that I can assign a different color (or different
properties in general) to each of the parts.

I have tried a few things with Paraview:
    1. Create a set of individual .VTU files and combine them in a .PVD
file. This works very nice for building result sequences of the complete
model.
    2. Create a set of individual .VTU files and combine them in a .PVM
file. This works in the sense that I can import a complete model build up
from several pieces, but I cannot assign colors to each of the parts and are
unable to hide and show individual parts (tried by using the "extract
datasets" filter).
    3. Create a XDMF XML file with 2 GRID elements in a single domain. This
again allows me to import the model and show hide individual parts. I can
still assign only 1 color to the complete model.

Is subdivision into multiple showable/hideable parts, including individual
color assignment, possible with either XDMF or VTK XML files?
If so, can someone post a minimal example?

Kind regards,

Marco

Is there any error message shown on the server? Doesn't look like you
are able to render on the server.

Is it possible for you to attach a debugger to the pvserver and
provide the stack trace for where it crashes? My guess is it's failing
when creating the render window.

Can you send us the CMakeCache.txt file from your build?
On the server, can you run
> pvserver --ldd
and send us the output? If pvserver --ldd fails, try

Are you by any chance using the binaries distributed on
www.paraview.org? If so, are you trying to to run the pvserver with
mpiexec/mpirun? The distributed binaries are not built with MPI
support so cannot be run with mpi. I am asking this since in your
error messages there seem to be some mpiexec error messages.

Rafael,

It is possible to get the output of a filter in a custom panel. But it
most certainly is not recommended. Fetching data from the output of
any filter/source should be done only by views such as the render
view/xy line plot view/ spreadsheet view etc. However if you insist on
getting the data to the client side create a client-delivery
representation. Look at the implementation of "Fetch()" function  in
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py for details.
However I'd still recommend to rethink -- do you really need the full
data or just some meta-data that can be obtained from the
vtkPVDataInformation associated with the input?

Subject: [Paraview] Generating data on the client side - a development
	environment
Message-ID: <7BA8761FA699404299447B0E6C0F67FB0156326E7BC6@HMC-MBX01.he.businessgateway.co.za>

Hallo

I have a question regarding a requirement that seems a bit out of line with the client-server architecture of Paraview;

Let me start off by giving the bigger picture of the application that I have in mind;

I want to use Paraview in a development environment. The development environment will operate in a standard Python console. As I develope (build up) my data I want to visualize it periodically. I don't want to regenerate the data from sratch everytime I want to visualize it. I basically want to work with live data that persists on the client side.

A typical example Python script that I envisage using Python wrapped VTK and Paraview objects to display vtkPolydata would look something like this:

=========================================================================================
# Initialize Paraview pipeline
mySource = InitializePV()

# Create poly data and plot it
import vtk
pts=vtk.vtkPoints()
pts.InsertNextPoint(0,0,0)
pts.InsertNextPoint(1,0,.0)
pts.InsertNextPoint(2,1,0)
pts.InsertNextPoint(3,3,0.)

cel=vtk.vtkCellArray()
cel.InsertNextCell(4)
cel.InsertCellPoint(0)
cel.InsertCellPoint(1)
cel.InsertCellPoint(2)
cel.InsertCellPoint(3)

pd = vtk.vtkPolyData()
pd.SetPoints(pts)
pd.SetPolys(cel)
plotPolys(mySource,pd)


##### Change the points and plot
pd.GetPoints().SetPoint(2, 1,2,3)
plotPolys(mySource,pd)

##### Change the points and plot
pd.GetPoints().SetPoint(2, 4,5,4)
plotPolys(mySource,pd)


# etc
====================


The Python functions initializePV() and plotPoints can typically look like the following:

initializePV():
=========
pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
sph=servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
pxm.RegisterProxy("sources", "mysource", sph)
view = pxm.GetProxy("views", "RenderView1")
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(sph, view)
return sph

plotPoints(sourceObject,vtkObject):
===============
# Although this example currently generates vtkPoints I actually want to send vtkPolyData to the Paraview source - but this
# is only to demonstrate the development environment I have in mind...
# The current vtk and proxy source classes needs to be updated to take a vtkPolyData pointer...
sourceObject.SetMyPolyData(vtkObject)
sourceObject.Update()



=========================================================================================

In the example above the vtk data (pd) is a live object on the client side.

In short I want to generate vtk data on the client side and send a data pointer (typically a vtkPolyData pointer) to the visualization pipeline in Paraview. I thought of modifying a source object in Paraview to take my data instead of generating the data on the server side.

I don't want to work with the programmable source using a script for that implies that the data is again generated on the server side.

According to the Paraview documentation it seems that the only way to manipulate the Paraview source objects is through Property objects (VectorProperty, ProxyProperty and InputProperty). Does this imply that according to the current architecture that I will not be able to send a vtkObject (vtkPolyData) pointer to the server? If so what are the options with regards to the Paraview architecture so that I can use Paraview in the above demonstrated manner - i.e. generating data on the client side and let Paraview operate on such data?

Thanks in advancxe,
Louis

Subject: [Paraview] How to visualize multipart/multiblock models
Message-ID: <adb0f27a0812180315j2aba4fe9tdce569d2bc21eeac@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to find a way to subdivide a structural analysis model in
several parts in such a way that I can post-process the results in
Paraview. The primary objective for me is to be able to hide and show
different parts of the structure. The model itself is not too large
(say 50.000 cells). A bonus for me would be that I can assign a
different color (or different properties in general) to each of the
parts.

I have tried a few things with Paraview:
    1. Create a set of individual .VTU files and combine them in a
.PVD file. This works very nice for building result sequences of the
complete model.
    2. Create a set of individual .VTU files and combine them in a
.PVM file. This works in the sense that I can import a complete model
build up from several pieces, but I cannot assign colors to each of
the parts and are unable to hide and show individual parts (tried by
using the "extract datasets" filter).
    3. Create a XDMF XML file with 2 GRID elements in a single domain.
This again allows me to import the model and show hide individual
parts. I can still assign only 1 color to the complete model.

Is subdivision into multiple showable/hideable parts, including
individual color assignment, possible with either XDMF or VTK XML
files?
If so, can someone post a minimal example?


BTW. I hope this is not a double post. I posted this message
yesterday, but did not receive it though my subscription. I actually
found this message in the Paraview mail-archive. Maybe there is a
problem/restriction on the message format. I mailed from my GMAIL
account in the default rich text format. I will try now in plain text.
If it is a double post, please forgive me ;).


Kind regards,

Marco

Hi all!

I had a look on the wiki, and indeed, one can find information at the page
you pointed me:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Enabling_a_filter_in_VTK
but also at that one:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ExtendingParaView#Enable_Existing_VTK_Class

Very interesting information are given, however, I think I am missing
something.

Just to try out, I copy/past the given Server Manager Configuration file in
a xml, naming it "vtkCellDerivatives.xml".

I loaded it as it is indicated (using the *Plugins Manager*), as shown on
the following picture.

(By the way, I'm surprised that there is no confirmation of the correct
loading. It may be intersting to have two buttons:
- "select" having thefunctionality of the current "load" one: selection of
an XML file
- "load" or "apply" confirming the selection of the XL file and may
achieveing some control:

Subject: [Paraview] Help needed in writing binary vtu file
Message-ID: <20081218124216.pscf6rwzk40ss0c0@webmail.unibw-hamburg.de>

Hi all

I am currently writing a c++ program that converts a unstructured  
ascii vtk file into vtu binary xml unstructured file and when I tried  
to open the xml file in paraview it gave me an error message saying  
that "Cannot read cell connectivity from Cells in piece 0 because the  
"offsets" array is not monotonically increasing or starts with a value  
less than 1". I am dealing with noncompressed data and I encode the  
data size in bytes and data in a single go.

I tried to decode the my base 64 encoded data using a online decoder  
"http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp" it works fine.

I kindly request all to have a look at my binary file and help me to  
find out the problem.

Please let me know if you know some documents that explains how to  
write a binary vtu file.

Best regards

Manushanker

I'm really sorry, I miss a key on my keyboard, and there was it, the mail
already left...

So, I wanted first pointing out a possible interesting feature: having two
buttons when dealing with plug-ins:

- "select" having the functionality of the current "load" one: selection of
an XML file
- a "load" or "apply" button to confirm the selection of the XML file and
maybe achieving some controls:
                       - is the file empty?
                       - does it start with the <ServerManagerConfiguration>
tag?
                       - and so on... (well, the standard controls that
allow the use of an XML file I guess...)



Then, here is my main question: I'm not sure at all the loading worked
correctly:
Where am I supposed to find the loaded filter to apply it on an example?

I went in the *Filter* tab and I couldn't see it anywhere...

(see attached picture)

I am of course not interest in the vtkCellDerivatives lcass: I know that it
is availabe with the filter "Compute Derivatives".
It is just a test.

Could you point me out where is the mistake?

I have to say that I didn't use any GUI XML, as it is said being "optional"
in the page:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Enabling_a_filter_in_VTK



In addition, just for information: where does the name displayed in the *
Filter* tab comes from?
Is it the value of the "SourceProxy" tag \"name" attribute?
In this case, are we forced to prepend "vtk" from the vtk class name to
obtain it?
It would indeed mean that we cannot have blank in the name.



Concerning the wiki, I have also few questions.

- First, once I have this working for HyperStreamLine, I guess that it may
interest other users.
Wouldn't it be interesting to have a section in the wiki where users could
drop validated server manager configuration files for VTK classes that could
then be downloaded by others?

- Finally, I found the old page:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ExtendingParaView#Enable_Existing_VTK_Class
more detailed than the new one.
Shouldn't they be merged?

Tell me if I can help on this topic.




Cheers,

Pierre

Subject: [Paraview] Visualising time-dependent field and time-dependent
	scalars at the same time
Message-ID: <6c915be80812180413y51148023ocda16437a2e8e497@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I have a time-dependent field u(x,y,z,t) and two scalars s1(t), s2(t). At
the time being, for each time frame I have a separate .vtk file

u(x,y,z,t0) -> step_0000.vtk
u(x,y,z,t1) -> step_0001.vtk
u(x,y,z,t2) -> step_0002.vtk
etc.

whereas the corresponding scalar quantities are stored synchronously in a
single column-formatted file
s1(t0)   s2(t0)
s1(t1)   s2(t1)
s1(t2)   s2(t2)
etc.

I usually visualise the .vtk file and animate u. Since s1(t) and s2(t) are
influencing the overall dynamics, I wold need to looad and visualise s1 and
s2 at the same time, possibly animate them synchronously.

What is the best way to achieve this? If you have any smart suggestions as
to how store s1(t) and s2(t) within the .vtk file I would be grateful.
Please note that s1 and s2 are *not* probation points of the field u, but
they are totally diferent quantities.

Best.

Daniele

This will be a very welcome addition. The hard-coded paths in the cmake

Currently there is no way to hide-show individual blocks in a
multiblock dataset or assign colors to them. However, you can apply
the "Extract Block" filter to extract each individual blocks and then
apply colors to them or show/hide them.

Hi Marco,

Which version of ParaView are you using? In 3.4, you can create a vtm
file that points to the individual vtu files. You can then color the
blocks separately using the vtkCompositeIndex array (just color by
it). You can control the color of each block by editing the color map.
Alternatively, you can add a cell-centered, 3 component, unsigned char
array (RGB) for each block to the file and then color by that array
(make sure to turn off the Map Scalar option).

As for turning on/off individual block, I am afraid you have to use
the Extract Block filter to achieve that. I hope that we will have
that option in the Display page in the future but it is not currently
supported.

What I described here should also work with Xdmf.

Can you store s1 and s2 as scalars of the vtk data set? This means it  
would have to be included in each vtk file but would solve the problem.

Since the main participants
(http://www.paraview.org/paraview/project/parti.html) decide what or
what does not come into Paraview, it is essentially irrelevant what the
central "blessed repo" uses for its versioning (cvs, svn, git).

There are primarily two issues of interest to the end-users:
1) an independent mirror (read-only is fine), to help reduce the single
point of failure issues.
2) an (additional) git view of the repository (read-only is also fine),
since it permits the end-user much better control over local
modifications, synchronizing between various places (eg, work, home,
laptop) and network independent commits. Git also conveniently permits
an http transport protocol, which is a godsend for people sitting behind
a corporate firewall that also blocks cvs, svn and ssh ports.


Using the git-svn layer sounds like a great solution for Paraview & Co.,
since you can service windows needs, but still let others work with git.

It might be impolite to ask about a timeline, but I will the previous
thread (http://www.mail-archive.com/cmake at cmake.org/msg10880.html) is
close to a year ago.

Utkarsh,

actually I would like to get vtkPointData from Server, the nodes global id's. I'm taking a look at the vtkPVDataSetAttributesInformation class, but I don't think it will provide this information, am I right ? As a meta data, I can't get really the data, just some information about it...

Regards,
Rafael.

Rafael,

It is possible to get the output of a filter in a custom panel. But it
most certainly is not recommended. Fetching data from the output of
any filter/source should be done only by views such as the render
view/xy line plot view/ spreadsheet view etc. However if you insist on
getting the data to the client side create a client-delivery
representation. Look at the implementation of "Fetch()" function  in
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py for details.
However I'd still recommend to rethink -- do you really need the full
data or just some meta-data that can be obtained from the
vtkPVDataInformation associated with the input?

Mike,

I might totally unaware of what you are talking about, but do you mean I
will have to store s1(t0) and s2(t0) together with u(x,y,z,t0)?

Here u(x,y,z,t0) is a scalar field at time t0 (i.e. nx times ny times nz
data points), whereas s1(t0) is *a single value* at time t0. How can I get
ParaView to read *a single value* in a legacy vtk file?

Best.

Easily done as I found out recently:

    sm = servermanager

    f = open('trivialproducer.xml', 'r')
    parser = sm.vtkSMXMLParser()
    parser.Parse(f.read())
    parser.ProcessConfiguration(sm.vtkSMObject.GetProxyManager())
    # Update the modules
    sm.updateModules()

    tp = sm.sources.TrivialProducer()
    obj = tp.GetClientSideObject()
    obj.SetOutput(pd)

    # use tp as any other source proxy


trivialproducer.xml:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">

   <SourceProxy name="TrivialProducer"
                class="vtkPVTrivialProducer">
   </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>

</ServerManagerConfiguration>

You probably need cvs ParaView for the code above to work.

Ricardo,

I was hoping that I could load and maybe animate a comma separated file into
paraview and animate it somehow.

If you want to store values that are not associated with points or
cells, you can store them in the field data. ParaView reads field data
with everything else. The question is, what do you want to do with
those values after you load them?

Nawijn,

ParaView is quite happy to read multiple copies of your *pvd file as in 
1 below. You can then process them independently. You also create 
multiple "edited" *.pvd files that each has only one part. PV can read 
them all and have individual pipelines in which a Transform filter can 
translated and rotate the part (side-by-side view, symmetric halves used 
to create a whole, "exploded" part views, two different orientations of 
the same part with the same or different information displayed on the 
part, et cetera). The more you use PV the smarter it gets. With multiple 
parts, each with its own pipeline, you can use the "eyeball" icon in the 
pipeline display window to turn on/off any combination of parts you like.

I personally find PV amazingly versatile. What is limiting is my 
imagination to realize everything it can do just as it is.

I haven't had the time to get this to work... I went through the dependency
walker and it seems that many dependencies are not resolved... Wht I will do
next is compare this to my linux build. 
I'll keep you posted on the progress  ~ Just one question though, plugins
working in ParaView 3.2 should work in 3.4 right ?

Hi Jacques,

I can't be of much help but I wanted to mention that, once you get this
working, we should create a wiki describing issues with plugins on various

Hi All, 

I have been thinking of a potential improvement for visualization of
multipart models in ParaView.
I would really like to develop the following functionality :

Have support for multiple views where you can :
-> Select one or several blocks and move them to another view (maybe with a
keyboard shortcut like alt+numberofView)
-> flip between the views by just typing a number on the keyboard
-> Have a system where blocks can only be present in one view at a time

Would the structure of ParaView enable me to do this ? If so - where would I
start ? I know that the pipeline and the extract selections offer somewhat a
similar capability, but there are still a few things missing ?

Hi Marco,

Which version of ParaView are you using? In 3.4, you can create a vtm file
that points to the individual vtu files. You can then color the blocks
separately using the vtkCompositeIndex array (just color by it). You can
control the color of each block by editing the color map.
Alternatively, you can add a cell-centered, 3 component, unsigned char array
(RGB) for each block to the file and then color by that array (make sure to
turn off the Map Scalar option).

As for turning on/off individual block, I am afraid you have to use the
Extract Block filter to achieve that. I hope that we will have that option
in the Display page in the future but it is not currently supported.

What I described here should also work with Xdmf.

Message-ID: <279845707BC7A74E8952F46EC2BB422F0A5514@exbe04.intra.dlr.de>


Hi,


i tried to load a filter from 

ParaView-3.4.0/Examples/Plugins/Filter/MyElevationFilter.xml 

to ParaView (3.4, binaries from paraview.org and the same in a self-compiled version) with the dialog "Tools/Manage Plugnis/Extensions" - this works. 

But after applying it to an data-set the gui-crashes and i get the message:


ERROR: In /opt/PARAVIEW_3_4_build/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1079
vtkProcessModule (0x5107740): Cannot create object of type "vtkMyElevationFilter".
while processing
Message 0 = New
  Argument 0 = string_value {vtkMyElevationFilter}
  Argument 1 = id_value {554}

vtkProcessModule (0x5107740): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.


Any ideas what is wrong? The Filter? The usage?

Best regards and thank you,

I currently found the following issues:

class Something; // Not allowed because it does not start with the vtk 
Prefix

class vtkMyFilter: public vtkSomeFilterClass, public MyBaseClass // 
Probably same as above, but I'm not sure
{
    void SomeFunction(Eigen::Vector3f& arg); // I assume I can't take 
arguments that are not primitive types or don't have the vtk prefix but 
I'm not sure
}


Is there anything I can do about these issues?

Thanks
Benjamin

Not sure about the multiple inheritance issue but for methods that  
don't take vtk type primitives surround the method declaration with  
the following:

//btx
void SomeFunction(... );
//etx

I just renamed the baseclass now (It is not inside a library so that's 
no issue) and the parser seems to accept this. Adding //btx //etx works 
but that's not really an ideal solution. IMHO, the grammar of the parser 
should be changed for such things to be possible.

I'm using the svn version of paraview and the parser seems to hang but 
it doesn't report an error. I assume that's a bug which will be fixed 
pretty soon

Thanks

Stefan,

Looks like you only loaded the xml for the filter. Loading of xml is
fine when exposing filters already present in VTK but not available to
ParaView GUI. The MyElevataionFilter.xml refers to a new filter class
vtkMyElevationFilter which needs to be compiled. Hence simply loading
xml is not valid here. Instead you should load the plugin shared
library that would be compiled if you turn on BUILD_EXAMPLES when
configuring paraview using CMake. On compiltation there will be
libSMMyElevation.so (or similar on  other platforms) that you can load
through the plugin manager.
Look at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo for details.

Message-ID: <21f0b0400812190734g68c6b522rd412b8566065ac8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Although the problem is simple outside "Paraview", but I was wondering if
there is
some way to create very high quality triangulation of some of the primitive
surfaces
defined in the "Source" such as cylinder, cubes etc directly in the
Paraview.  I tried
using two filters (1) First triangulate (2) and then Subdivide. but the
output contained
bad quality triangulation.

thanks.

Is it possible to put labels on points or cells using a

Inside my filter code, I want to do something like:
myPoint->setLabel("50 metres");

the label must look like the selection inspector label and 
not the vtkVectorText one.

Is there a way to do that ?

When I have that kind of problem I find it very useful to use a script that
was posted some time ago which dumps a state to python and helps you find
the syntax you need for your scripts. It's called pv-dump.py and is posted
on the mailing list.

Hello,

I have one specific requirement and hope ParaView can do a good job. I am
interested in
Visualizing Graph Partitioned Domain. Since number of Partitions could be
very large,
it is important that neighbouring domain to have high contrasting color. A
smoothly
varying colormap doesn't do good job for large domains.

Is there any way to create random colormap in ParaView ?

Thanks.

Hi

I've got a plugin which compiles cleanly, but the menu entry for the 
plugin is not shown (The plugin is being loaded - I checked strace. So 
PV_PLUGIN_PATH is set correctly)

Since I have no clue where the problem could be - is there some 
debugging switch that enables some kind of error messages? paraview is 
completely silent and doesn't tell a thing when the plugin wasn't able 
to load

Thanks

One possible solution is to add the labels as a point data or cell
data array of type "vtkStringArray" and then use the selection
labeling mechanism to label with this string array.

Thanks Utkarsh for your response.

that's what I already did. I used empty string on points 
where I don't want to display properties. But the user 
must use the selection inspector to see the labels. Is 
there a way to do the selection from the filter code. It 
will be perfect if I can select the points I want from 
inside the filter code, or simply select all points will 
help also.

Thanks

Nehme,

Is this in a custom application/python or ParaView GUI. In
python/custom-app you can yourself create (representations,
DataLabelRepresentation) representation proxy and connect it to the
output of your filter. Then it will label all points/cells.

Rafael,

You are correct. DataSetAttributesInformation cannot provide you with
the actual data. I guess you will have fetch the whole data client.

That code is in the gui xml file that your plugin provides I believe.

Something like:
<ParaViewFilters>
   <Filter name="myGreatFilter" />
</ParaViewFilters>

Could you explain what you mean by "bad triangulation"?  I looked at the results with the cylinder and the box sources, and the triangulation looks perfect to me: Each polygon is broken up evenly into smaller triangles.  Were you expecting some other result?

Hello,

Although the problem is simple outside "Paraview", but I was wondering if there is

using two filters (1) First triangulate (2) and then Subdivide. but the output contained
bad quality triangulation.

There is no easy way to create a random color map in ParaView, but it is not hard to make a random scalar field.  For example, you could use the Random Vectors filter.

Is there any way to create random colormap in ParaView ?

I don't think any of the developers are aware of bug that causes the VTK wrapping parser to hang.  Could you send us a piece of code that demonstrates the problem?

I'm using the svn version of paraview and the parser seems to hang but
it doesn't report an error. I assume that's a bug which will be fixed
pretty soon

Thanks

Just to set your mind at ease, //btx & //etx are the "official" way to 
handle syntax that the parser doesn't understand.  You'll find that 
they're ubiquitous in the VTK & ParaView sources.  Note that this isn't 
just a question of whether the parser is smart enough - the code that 
must be wrapped with //btx & //etx is code that can't be mapped into the 
languages targeted by the wrapper generator.

Cheers,
Tim

How does the ClientDeliveryRepresentation choose what data type to send?
I have two pipelines:
Reader->ImageReslice->ClientDeliveryRepresentation->ImagePlaneWidget
and
Reader->ClientDeliveryRepresentation->hacked ImagePlaneWidget that allows
pipeline inputs

The first works beautifully, while the ImageReslice inside my second
pipeline complains that it is getting polydata instead of imagedata.

Any suggestions, besides producing an image plane widget that uses a server
side reslice?

Random color maps really aren't that hard to create, using a trick.  Basically, you split the color map into ranges, for instance 0-0.1=black, 0.100001-0.2=blue, etc.

Here is a random color map that uses 24 colors.  Notice that this isn't perfect, but it works pretty well.  You can test it using disk_out_ref.exo, and looking at color.  Obviously, you can easily break this into more colors.

Cut and paste the following XML into a file, for instance colorMap24Random.xml.
Open your object.
Edit Color Map/ Choose Preset/ Import/ colorMap24Random.xml.


The other way may be to make a "random number variable" using your partitions number as input.  This is done using the calculator and some random number formula.  For an example, see the ParaView wiki, ParaView 3 Tutorial, Beginning Filters, Calculator.  http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Random Colormap

Hello,

I have one specific requirement and hope ParaView can do a good job. I am interested in
Visualizing Graph Partitioned Domain. Since number of Partitions could be very large,
it is important that neighbouring domain to have high contrasting color. A smoothly
varying colormap doesn't do good job for large domains.

Is there any way to create random colormap in ParaView ?

Thanks.

Look at  vtkSMClientDeliveryStrategyProxy::UpdatePipelineInternal()
that's where the data  type is set on the data-transfer filter. BTW,
ClientDeliverRepresentation cannot deliver 3D image data. It can only
deliver 2D slices.

The random values will, by their nature, be generally discontinuous.  Feeding a continuous color map through the random scalars will create discontinuous colors, which is what you were asking for.  This is a trick that we use with the Process Ids Scalars to make it easier to see a parallel partition of data.

For the greatest variation of colors, use an HSV color map the wraps through most of the hues.

Hello Kenneth,

Perhaps I didn't understand your solution. What I was looking for a high contrash color assignement to visualize
graph partitioning.  If the neighboring domain have almost similar color, then perhaps it might be difficult for ordinary
humans to see the boundary.

Could u explain your solution ?

Hi

I think found the problem. 

When I have: 

//BTX
something
// ETX

(note the space between the comment and the ETX)
This has caused the hang here

Benjamin,

I don't think any of the developers are aware of bug that causes the VTK wrapping parser to hang.  Could you send us a piece of code that demonstrates the problem?

I'm using the svn version of paraview and the parser seems to hang but
it doesn't report an error. I assume that's a bug which will be fixed
pretty soon

Message-ID: <86106.78233.qm@web35307.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear PVers:

I have a steady state flow field.  I am wondering if PV can do particle tracking animation.

what I am looking for is similar to pathlines, but, instead of showing the lines, I would like to do an animation of seed particles "flowing" through the flow field.  Is this possible?

Thanks! and wish everyone here a Happy New Year!

If your "global" data is stored in field data, you can use the "Plot
Global Variables Over Time" filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Plot on a Contour surface
In-Reply-To: <45d654b0812051426t18740961j7cf43eba430b61d5@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <45d654b0812291002u4fb26651u3b60dc2b9cd10aca@mail.gmail.com>

I had some figuring this one out. Here is the pipeline:

reader -> contour -> triangle strips -> (extract selection) -> clean
to grid -> extract surface

The purpose of each filter is:

contour: extract the boundary
triangle strips: combine the points of each line to create polylines.
Otherwise, each line segment is a separate cell.
extract selection: extract one of the polylines if there are more than
one (optional)
clean to grid: convert to unstructured grid and remove duplicate points
extract surface: convert to polydata. This filter has the useful side
effect of ordering points along the polyline so that the polyline has
points 0, 1, 2, 3... instead of 0, 5, 3, 9. This is necessary for
plotting

Once you apply this pipeline, you can create a XY Plot view and plot
any variable along the curve. I can't remember if this worked on 3.4.
It definitely works with the development (cvs) version of ParaView.

In the next version, there will probably be one filter that does
everything I described here.

Can I write a strategy to make it support 3D Image data?
Would a vtkImageDataStreamer solve this problem?

I am afraid not. You can file a feature request at
http://paraview.org/Bug but to be honest, this would be a low priority
for us.

So, the total time of threshold + contour is much less than just
contour? I can't reproduce this. Can you share your data?

Looking more carefully at the server errors, it looks like you are
running a server that is not MPI enabled. In fact, it looks like the
pvserver from our binary distribution. Each server node is reporting
the following error:

ERROR: In /tmp/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx,
line 180
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x15bcfe60): Failed to set up server socket.

Only the first node is supposed to execute that code. Also, the path
of the error is the path we used to build our binaries which is
unlikely to be the same as yours.

Can you verify that /usr/local/paraview/bin/pvserver (the one in
Stephen's PBS script) is the right executable? Nicolas sent the ldd
output of /home/install/paraview-340/bin/pvserver.

If they are recompiled, yes.

Hi Beheshti,

ParaView cannot generate streamlines or contours from a set of points.
It needs a volume consisting of elements such as tetrahedra. You can
create such a volume by applying Delaunay 2D or 3D to your dataset.

Happy new year.

Hi

I have a gui xml file - I have a proper CMakeLists file etc. The thing 
is - I have two filters atm. When I comment one out (from CMakeLists and 
from the xml file), it all works. But when I add the new filter, it 
doesn't work anymore which indicates that there must be some xml error 
of some sort. The thing is, Paraview is completely silent about it. 
That's why I'm asking for some debug output so I actually get a chance 
to diagnose the problem

Cheers
Benjamin

Hi

I appended a plugin which makes the wrapper hang here.
Please note - I ripped tons of code out the filter which leaves it in an 
uncompilable state - but that's not the point. It makes the wrapper hang 
and that's it

Cheers
Benjamin

Reproduced the problem on OS X 10.5.6 with latest Xcode tools and  
ParaView from CVS (probably pulled yesterday).

Removing the space between '//' and 'ETX' resolves the hang.

Tried to work through the code but didn't get very far. At least it is  
reproducible.

Hi Pierre,

The reason the filter does not show up is that it has the same name as
an existing one. Try changing the name from CellDerivatives to
CellDerivatives2.

Try this:

* Create a spreadsheet view
* Turn on the visibility of the dataset you want to save
* File -> Export
* Export to csv

One useful thing I have been doing is to use the calculator before doing a
2D plot and creating a varible "x" = x_coord so that I can plot against a
geometric coordinate instead of an int. It's weird that I have to do this
and can not access the x variable directly ...

I don't see a spreadsheet filter in the stable release of 3.4.0, am I
missing it? wiki says spreadsheet is available in 3.4.0 and shows how to 
create one. Problem is it does not seem to create one (at leastfor me).

when I do

extract surface -> connectivity filter -> threshold filter + slice in 
z+scatter plot + export x3d
I get a file that has coordinates ann color values.

             <Coordinate DEF="VTKcoordinates0001" point="
               0.0134837 0.000662414 0.081,

               0.0134837 -0.000662414 0.081,
               0.013435 0.00132323 0.081,
               ...
               x,y,z I assume

the following, I assume, are related to the pressure. What is the 
formula to convert colors to a pressure values?

             <Color DEF="VTKcolors0001" color="

Message-ID: <495B682A.10804@sophia.inria.fr>

I have four PV tables in the vtu file of which one table contains the 
velocity components.
When I try to do contour lines of the velocity mag I cannot;  this 
choice is not one of the contour options.
Is there an easier way to do contours lines of velocity magnititude?

It sounds like cmake wasn't able to tell where the MPI libraries are.
Open up ccmake, turn on the advanced options, and verify that the MPI
INCLUDE and LIBRARY and EXTRA_LIBRARY paths are correct.

Message-ID: <mailman.36.1237804519.3110.paraview@paraview.org>

method does indeed get sent identical values for
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() for both ports.
The reader according takes the values from port 0 when setting its
internal time step.

The situation gets rather "complicated" (ie, buggy) when any filters are
applied to the reader. As the simplest case, a clip-plane can be added,
which attaches itself automatically to port 0, since port 1 is empty (no
lagrangian data) in my test case. With this constellation, the reader's
RequestData() method now gets sent conflicting values for
UPDATE_TIME_STEPS. Port 0 (invisible since a clip-plane is attached),
always gets sent an UPDATE_TIME_STEPS =3D=3D PREVIOUS_UPDATE_TIME_STEPS,
while port 1 gets sent an UPDATE_TIME_STEPS that corresponds to what has
been selected in AnimationView or the time-selector spinbox.
If I make port 1 invisible, the behaviour changes and port 0 gets the
correct values for UPDATE_TIME_STEPS and port 1 get an out-of-date value
for UPDATE_TIME_STEPS!

It would be possible to add in some sort of kludge to guess which
UPDATE_TIME_STEPS on which port is likely to be correct, but there must
be a better way.  I realize that there are not terribly many multi-port
readers in the VTK sources, but surely this behaviour cannot be
desirable.  Is there a better way to avoid it?

Thanks,

the XDMF data model =A0at this time that will allow paraview to read in<br>

On your other method, we have both the external boundary mesh and a<br>

In fact, it seems to me that ParaView does the best it can. Your<br>

I use two methods to achieve what you want. Ghost-cells, or another<br>
multi-piece object containing the different boundary types (solid,<br>
symmetries, inflow, outflow, etc) stored as vtkPolyData. These are read<br>
in from the models on disk.<br>
