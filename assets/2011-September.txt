Subject: [Paraview] Widgets and RequestData

I have now figured out the problem, the unsigned long GetMTime() function
needs to be overloaded to report a new modified time (this updated time is
in the widget/vtkImplicitFunction). When the filter has a new modified time
then RequestData gets called.

This message written so that if anybody else ever has this problem they
might have an easier time with it.

Subject: [Paraview] Segmentation fault in 3.11.1 when saving screenshot.
Message-ID: <1314865143.2204.11.camel@saunton>

Hi All, 

I'm having some problems saving screen shots with the latest version of
Paraview (3.11.1).  This is compiled on an Ubuntu-64 bit system.
Basically Paraview crashes with a segmentation fault every time I try to
save a screen shot. The graphics card is admittedly low end, but this
worked fine in 3.10. Has anyone else had this issue? Below is some of
the output from gdb.

cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Still getting Numpy error using Paraview 2.10.1 for mac
Message-ID: <C2CE69C97815534DACA71555980421EBC3052C2AA7@EXNSW-MBX03.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi,

I downloaded 3.10.1 (the pre-built version)  for mac osx10.7 tonight, and am trying to use the python calculator.  I get the error:


Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
  File "/Users/partyd/Projects/ParaView-3.10/build/ParaView-build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/vtk/dataset_adapter.py", line 5, in <module>
RuntimeError: This module depends on the numpy module. Please makesure that it is installed properly.


I know paraview has its own python+numpy, but just in case it matters, i have multiple numpy and python installed, including ones from macports.

Can you help, please?

Try turning off "Use Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots" from the Edit |

I will take a look at this tomorrow. I suspect it was hardcoded
initially but I should be able to make that configurable pretty
easily.

Subject: [Paraview] Help getting resetting cameras between batch viz runs
Message-ID: <CAH-123RLE0KMEzBXC5VQdd29X4ufOwCERoe+r4FW_v8p+xQmaA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using the Python scripting facility in Paraview to do some batch
visualization of some semiconductor models I'm simulating. The Start/Stop
Trace feature is great, and I've already put together something quite
usable. However, I can't figure out how to reset the camera between
different simulations.

The code coming out of the Trace feature looked something like:
    rv = pv.GetRenderView()
    rv.CameraFocalPoint = [0.223, -0.0160,-0.334]
    rv.CameraParallelScale = 1.684
    rv.CenterOfRotation = [0.223, -0.0160,-0.334]
    rv.CameraPosition = [0.223, -0.0160, 4.105]
    rv.CameraClippingRange = [5.308, 8.033]
i.e. they already got the center of the object from some query to the
objects already in the database. What would I have to do to get this
information myself? I'm having a hard time finding info. I've tried reading
the doctext for the Outline and OutlineCorners features, and I've seen a
couple refs to a GetBounds command while googling around, but I can't find
anything that really helps.

My pipeline looks something like:
* Use the ExodusIIReader to create a reader object
* Use the aforementioned render view object to control the camera
* Create a slice object in the z-direction at a certain height
* Create a data representation and a colormap
* Render the object.
I can't tell which of the objects I would use for an Outline() or a
GetBounds() call. For example, I get the min/max values for the data in the
slice via
    min,max = slice.PointData[0].GetRange()
but using s or s.PointData with Outline() or GetBounds() doesn't get me
anywhere. Can anyone nudge me in the right direction?

Thanks,
Rick

Subject: [Paraview] starting an animation before the first timestep
Message-ID: <20110901222832.216340@gmx.net>

Hi,

I am trying to make a nice animation with paraview. What I would like to do is add, for instance, an outline, a certain geometry and maybe other sources and then show the timevariant dataset. But adding those sources should be part of the animation. So, basically, I want to start the animation before the first timestep of the dataset. How can I do that?
Thanks for any help!

Subject: [Paraview] visibility of the stream tracer
Message-ID: <20110901222926.216340@gmx.net>

Hi,

I have encountered two strange behaviors of ParaView both concerning the stream tracer. I wanted the streamlines to be seen only at certain time steps of my animation. So I used the Animation View to turn off the visibility at the beginning and then turn it on at a certain time step. Unfortunately the streamlines were visible in the entire animation. 

I had another problem with the stream tracer. I set the maximum length of a stream line to 6 (default was 17). When I turned off the visibility of the stream tracer by clicking on the eye and then turned it on again, ParaView  ignored the maximum length of 6 and used 17 instead.

Has anyone come across either of these problems? I am using ParaView 3.10.1

Leonie

I can think of three ways.
* Instead of save animation, use save screenshot.  Then, manually create your images for the movie.
* Same as above, but if you have any animations that need to be part of this, just write the animations down as individual images.
* You could always use the Animation View, turning visibility of these sources and datasets on as time runs.

I tried it with my own source and didn't have any problems.  Can you give
more details and maybe share your dataset?

Subject: [Paraview] Display crash running paraview with low-end graphics card
Message-ID: <1314957772.2261.29.camel@saunton>

Hi All,

When  using the slice of clip tool on a 3D view  if I try to adjust the
plane my display crashes. I suspect this has something to do with the
relatively low-end graphics card on my system and there is some toggle
or switch I'm missing, but can't for the life of me work out what it is.
Any help would be gratefully appreciated.

For reference I'm running 3.11.1 on Ubuntu-64 bit laptop 
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core
Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)

cheers

Marco,

Thanks very much for your reply. Actually, it isn't the camera I need
information on, it's the rest of the object. I need to know how big the
thing I'm looking at is, so I can know where exactly I should move the
camera. And I can't figure out how to get bounding box on any of the objects
that are available to me. Do you have any idea?

The options I would try are using mesa or go to Edit->Settings->Render View
and check Use Immediate Mode Rendering to on.  Both of these are normally
slower but if it's a memory allocation problem these may get you past that.

It's on the bug tracker now. http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12569

In the meantime I think a #define or adding -DID_64 to the cmake's
CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS ought to do it.

Subject: [Paraview] Load-save camera settings
Message-ID: <8693C83B2BE94906AF5757FA95A1840A@win.ara>


Dear All,

I've encountered an issue with reloading saved camera states using Adjust
Camera in interactive mode. If I try to load a camera pvcc file by clicking
load -> Selecting pvcc file -> press ok, my screen does not update. If I do
the same, but double click on the pvcc file instead, my screen will update. 

Is there something I'm missing here?

ADDENDUM: In the process of writing the e-mail, I restarted ParaView and now
everything works as expected, albeit with a simple dataset. I'll try and
track down exactly what brought me to the issue previously and repost.

Thanks,

Adriano

Update: The pvcc files don't appear to work across ParaView sessions. So, if
you save it in one session, restart ParaView, and try to apply it again, it
won't work.

Apologies if this has already been flagged as an issue. I did do a search
for something similar, but couldn't find anything.

Subject: [Paraview] Load-save camera settings


Dear All,

I've encountered an issue with reloading saved camera states using Adjust
Camera in interactive mode. If I try to load a camera pvcc file by clicking
load -> Selecting pvcc file -> press ok, my screen does not update. If I do
the same, but double click on the pvcc file instead, my screen will update. 

Is there something I'm missing here?

ADDENDUM: In the process of writing the e-mail, I restarted ParaView and now
everything works as expected, albeit with a simple dataset. I'll try and
track down exactly what brought me to the issue previously and repost.

Thanks,

Adriano

Hi Adriano,

I just tried it and it works for me. I'm using 3.10.0.What version are 
you using, and could you provide a specific set of steps to reproduce 
the issue?

Thanks

Hi Burlen,

Yes, I forgot about that information.

This is ParaView 3.10.1 release that I built from source on 64-bit Linux
CentOS 5.2. I've been pulled onto something else at the moment, but I'll try
to present a step-by-step guide as soon as I get a chance. However, if it is
working for others, then I should take a better look at my install and make
sure there is nothing fishy going on.

Cheers,

Adriano

Subject: [Paraview] Fail to get the input of a mapper
Message-ID: <CAEGkFz_eDP+ohTXaaGnVuj7mXxJ25aJq7P1qcr48=i8X0Xy0PA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to get the input of a mapper briefly as follows:

    *vtkMapper* mapper = actor->GetMapper();
    vtkDataSet* input = mapper->GetInput();
    int numPoints = input->GetNumberOfPoints();*

but faild.

I found that the numPoints is A (such as 400) when the representation of a
data is *Outline*, and B (such as 5500) when the representation of the same
data is *Surface*.

It seems that I only got part(s) of the whole data.

Anyone would tell me what is wrong and how to get the whole data?

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks!

Hi,

Is it possible to create new filters (such as Python Programmable
Filter) which control parameter values of other filters? For instance,
how to control a slice origin, normal plane and offset using some
other new filter control parameter and some numerical formula to
constrain slice to remain vertical?

Thanking you.

Thanks! Unfortunately the dataset is too big to save it as single images. But I solved the problem by adding a few files that were the same as the first time step to the beginning of my dataset. And then I can use your third idea to create the movie as I would like to.

I see that this bug is marked as "expired" - am I the only one that
would want to do this? The problem seems to also go the opposite way -
the selection tools are not available when in an image view. It seems
very reasonable to be able to select a group of pixels from a meta
image and inspect their values - is there any way to do this?

Thanks,

David

What variables are shown under the information tab of the object inspector
when the gradient of unstructured grids filter is selected?  If nothing is
listed there, what about the filter before that and what field are you using
in the gradient filter?

Subject: [Paraview] Fail to get the input of a mapper
Message-ID: <CAEGkFz8HaPTn+i7OE4PSc9sneO-MNmcCgsDyyETRCPYXn6qf4g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to get the input of a mapper briefly as follows:

    *vtkMapper* mapper = actor->GetMapper();
    vtkDataSet* input = mapper->GetInput();
    int numPoints = input->GetNumberOfPoints();*

but faild.

I found that the numPoints is A (such as 400) when the representation of a
data is *Outline*, and B (such as 5500) when the representation of the same
data is *Surface*.

It seems that I only got part(s) of the whole data. What is wrong and how to
get the whole data?

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks!

	card

Message-ID: <CAN=BSvLoR6zETjfpz3HaYk7VVF_yt-2sHOxorx31uo-Ks_pRcQ@mail.gmail.com>

I also got the problem, running Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit with proposed kernel
(2.6.38-9.43, currently) and ParaView 3.10.1. I have an Intel Mobile
GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller, what I would consider a low-end
graphics card.

Creating a slice from a rectangular mesh works, but displacing it with the
mouse makes the screen lock up, and eventually go black. It seems to keep
responding on key presses. In kern.log I found traces of compiz segfaulting
on the video driver, among a bunch of other errors regarding dri:

Sep  4 23:42:46 ivo-laptop kernel: [10387.689478] compiz[6970]: segfault at
0 ip 00007f2d7a480afe sp 00007fff8aa48b00 error 4 in
i965_dri.so[7f2d7a412000+ac000]

Stopping compiz makes it possible to move the slice by mouse without locking
things up. Something strange happens, still, as the background turns black
at the moment it would turn semi-transparent on my nvidia machine.

Using immediate mode rendering doesn't help, unfortunately.

Cheers,
Ivo

Subject: [Paraview] Cell and Point Labels for visible cells only
Message-ID: <5861C625258167499D051F0CE1D0FE4B047850BF@GLKMS2104.GREENLNK.NET>

Hello all,
 
Is it possible to label points in some way such that when the model is
rotated, only visible points have their labels shown?  Currently, point
and cell labels are seen through the model which can confuse the
display.  I know it is possible to use the select visible points tool
after each rotation but it would be nice not to have to.
 
Many thanks,
 
Duncan

I've just been looking at my issues in mantis and noticed this one -
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=11697

I realised I didn't add the python test so I have uploaded it.  I have also
uploaded a patch to fix the issue - any chance this can be included?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CABWOrb-YzhQA_w4cPYUZb7NDhB=C7Ezyj9c2HciF7PEDnhA5Eg@mail.gmail.com>

Clicking on a leaf node for a composite dataset will cause paraview to crash
in the master branch.

To reproduce:
    Sphere Source
    Group Datasets
    Click on Information in Object inspector
    Click on the leaf node [ it crashes here ]

if you set a breakpoint at pqProxyInformationWidget.cxx:468 it will show
where the pointer to vtkPVInformationWidget is stored in the QTreeWidgetItem
- the second stop in the steps above is the leaf node for the dataset.  If
you then set a breakpoint in ~vtkPVDataInformation you can see where it is
deleted (but not removed from the QTreeWidgetItem).  It was obvious to me
what should be happening here.

Regards,
Paul

BTW I've submitted to mantis - 12571

Agreed, immediate mode rendering did not help. I also tried recompiling
with VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA  = ON but this did not work either. Do you
have to set something inside Paraview to ensure software rendering?

For reference my graphics processors is:
% lspci | grep VGA
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core
Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)

cheers

Kit

Hi,

You can also try to disable depth peeling in Edit->Settings->Render View

Best,

Re: [Paraview] Display crash running paraview with low-end graphics card







Agreed, immediate mode rendering did not help. I also tried recompiling 
with VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA  = ON but this did not work either. Do you have 
to set something inside Paraview to ensure software rendering?

For reference my graphics processors is:
% lspci | grep VGA
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core 
Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)

cheers

I also got the problem, running Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit with proposed kernel 
(2.6.38-9.43, currently) and ParaView 3.10.1. I have an Intel Mobile 
GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller, what I would consider a 
low-end graphics card. 


Creating a slice from a rectangular mesh works, but displacing it with the 
mouse makes the screen lock up, and eventually go black. It seems to keep 
responding on key presses. In kern.log I found traces of compiz 
segfaulting on the video driver, among a bunch of other errors regarding 
dri:

i965_dri.so[7f2d7a412000+ac000]


Stopping compiz makes it possible to move the slice by mouse without 
locking things up. Something strange happens, still, as the background 
turns black at the moment it would turn semi-transparent on my nvidia 
machine.

Using immediate mode rendering doesn't help, unfortunately.

Cheers,
Ivo

The options I would try are using mesa or go to Edit->Settings->Render 
View and check Use Immediate Mode Rendering to on.  Both of these are 
normally slower but if it's a memory allocation problem these may get you 
past that.

Hi All,

When  using the slice of clip tool on a 3D view  if I try to adjust the 
plane my display crashes. I suspect this has something to do with the 
relatively low-end graphics card on my system and there is some toggle or 
switch I'm missing, but can't for the life of me work out what it is. Any 
help would be gratefully appreciated.

For reference I'm running 3.11.1 on Ubuntu-64 bit laptop

Hey, that works just fine, even with the compiz desktop manager enabled!
Thanks a lot!

Subject: [Paraview] [newbie] show grid in paraview - wireframe shows
 triangles instead of quads...
Message-ID: <4E6601B4.4030206@gmail.com>

Hi all,

[newbie question]: I want to show my mesh/grid in paraview and turn on 
"wireframe" mode. But this shows triangles instead of quads... I 
colleague of mine says that on his windows pc the correct quad mesh is 
shown but on my linux pc, I only see triangles...

Please help me understand how to see the true grid instead of the 
triangles...

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Machine hangs when using Paraview
Message-ID: <4E660E5C.6030500@knmi.nl>

Dear Paraview Users,

I experience probelm with Paraview after the Fedora operation system is 
installed. Whenever opacity is reduce from 1.0 the machine hangs. The 
only way to step over is to reboot the machine. Reboot doesn't always 
OK. Sometimes it took a while before the monitor can show something. 
Paraview versions 3.8 and 3.10 make no difference. Also Fedora13 and 14 
makes no difference.

Does anybody else have the same problem? I'm keen on hearing your 
experience.

Thanks!

Xueli

Please keep responses on the mailing list so everyone can contribute
and benefit.

Edit->Settings->RenderView->Depth Peeling, make sure "Enable Depth
Peeling" is not checked.

Depth peeling is the algorithm ParaView uses to enforce a correct
front to back order of translucent rendered geometry. It is fairly
graphics hardware intensive.

Not sure where you're adding this code, but you cannot get the "whole"
data merely from the mapper. The input to the mapper will always only
be the geometry being rendered which will change with representation
type (for outline, the geometry being rendered is only the outline).

Yes, we'll check it out and have it included in the 3.12 if all's well.

Could you post an example dataset, or show us how to replicate this with a sources/... source?  Also, what version of ParaView?  Local server?

Thanks,

Alan

Hi all,

[newbie question]: I want to show my mesh/grid in paraview and turn on 
"wireframe" mode. But this shows triangles instead of quads... I 
colleague of mine says that on his windows pc the correct quad mesh is 
shown but on my linux pc, I only see triangles...

Please help me understand how to see the true grid instead of the

Duncan,
No - I believe that what you ask for is not possible - but it sounds like a great idea.  Mind writing up a feature request on the Kitware site?

Hello all,

Is it possible to label points in some way such that when the model is rotated, only visible points have their labels shown?  Currently, point and cell labels are seen through the model which can confuse the display.  I know it is possible to use the select visible points tool after each rotation but it would be nice not to have to.

Many thanks,

Duncan

Paul,

I've committed a fix and it will be included in 3.12. Thanks for reporting.

FYI,

commit 6ffd41964cd9681af26769e8e6cf7778de7515ae
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 6 17:25:00 2011 -0400

    Fixed BUG #12571.  Update event wasn't fired when needed.

    vtkSMSourceProxy was not firing UpdateEvent when UpdatePipeline(time) was
    called. The data info was updated correctly however. So the Information tab
    ended up holding references to obsolete information instances. Fixed that.

Okay, thanks. It is a huge dataset so I can't share it. If you don't seem to have any problems with it, I will first look at what I did a little closer.

There isn't an in built mechanism for that.

The python programmable filter runs on the server, so it can not
control other filters along the pipeline (although it can set up
internal filters if you are familiar with programming at the vtk
level).

You best bet may be to use a python macro, which is the same thing
really as python trace or the python shell, ie client side python
scripting. From there you can control properties of filters up and
down the pipeline.

Another tool that might be useful are custom filters. Custome filters
are really canned pipeline segments. Ie construct pipeline a->b->c and
then condense all of that into custom filter Z so that you can reuse
the set whenever you like. You can choose any, all or none of the
properties on filters a,b,c to expose in your new filter Z.

Dear paraviewers,

I am building a new computer for CFD analysis.  I have an old Quadro FX4600.  In terms of paraview performance, will it be better to choose an AMD HD6870 or nVidia GTX 460 over my old Qudrao FX 4600?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Tecplot 10 ASCII reading
Message-ID: <CAOka_Ggzo2GPZ_jKcwg1BHXj4hMstv8su6MNY6b=jHPEiqXjSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

There have been some discussions in various threads about both ASCII
and binary reading of Tecplot files.

There are several ways that paraview tries to read them depending on
the chosen extension.
For example .tec asks for "Visit's reader, or only Tecplot reader" and
when .dat is chosen it tries to use the Paradis reader

I'm not familiar with those readers, however from the discussion it
seems that the Visit reader is most up to date.

Unfortunately I never succeed in reading the ASCII files in Tecplot 10
format (the only tecplot version I have) with the Visit reader
(nor any other). I get the "vtkVisItTecplotReader ... Unable to find
any meshes" etc.

I've tried reading the new dataformat file for the 360-version that
supposedly work with paraview, however I can't see any noticable
differences between the Tecplot 10 and 360 versions.
In short what is the status of the Visit reader and how, if possible,
can I read Tecplot 10 ASCII data into ParaView (3.10.1 linux).
Binary is not an option I'm afraid (although that doesn't work
neither), as I also want to use other software that only writes
Tecplot 10 ASCII.


Cheers,
Ingvar

Duncan,

Like Alan said, there's no easy way of doing this. The main inhibitor
for such a thing is the fact that it gets a bit tricky in parallel.
I've been mulling over this since your email and maybe we can try to
provide an improved labelling support for 4.0. Feel free to add this
to the bug tracker and I'll get a discussion started among the
developer team on how can this or something similar  be supported.

Please keep the discussion to the mailing list so others can

There isn't any easy way, that I can think of, of getting the whole
data in an interactor style. If you can elaborate what you're trying
to do, maybe there's another way that using an interactor style of
doing what you're trying to do.

Hi all,

  I am trying to build a paraview module. I have VTK 5.8.0 and
ParaView 3.10.1 installed on a linux/debian machine. When importing
both VTK & ParaView cmake module, I am getting the following errors
(truncated):

...
CMake Error at /tmp/pv/usr/lib/paraview/CMake/ParaViewTargets.cmake:16
(ADD_EXECUTABLE):
  add_executable cannot create imported target "vtkWrapPython" because
  another target with the same name already exists.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /tmp/pv/usr/lib/paraview/ParaViewConfig.cmake:58 (INCLUDE)
  CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package)


CMake Error at /tmp/pv/usr/lib/paraview/CMake/ParaViewTargets.cmake:19
(ADD_EXECUTABLE):
  add_executable cannot create imported target "vtkWrapPythonInit" because
  another target with the same name already exists.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /tmp/pv/usr/lib/paraview/ParaViewConfig.cmake:58 (INCLUDE)
  CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package)
...


It can easily be reproduced with:

$ cat /tmp/bla/CMakeLists.txt
project(bla)
find_package(VTK REQUIRED)
find_package(ParaView REQUIRED)

Could someone please confirm this is an actual issue ? If so I'll
report that to paraview bug tracker. Meanwhile could someone please
suggest a fix, other than -tediously- adding blockers for each
imported target, eg:

$ cat /usr/lib/paraview/CMake/ParaViewTargets.cmake
...
# Create imported target vtkWrapPython
IF(NOT TARGET vtkWrapPython)
ADD_EXECUTABLE(vtkWrapPython IMPORTED)
ENDIF(NOT TARGET vtkWrapPython)
...

This issue can also be seen when building VTKEdge (svn checkout from 20110819).

Thanks much !

Mathieu,

I'm not surprised that it doesnt' work. You cannot bring in VTK and
ParaView in the same project. If you project depends on both, you
should just include ParaView and you'll get access to most of VTK as
well (I can't think of anything we disable explicitly when importing
VTK, but I may be wrong).

Right, ParaView's Use file (ParaViewUse.cmake) already calls find VTK
seeding it with PARAVIEW_VTK_DIR. Hence the duplicate targets.

Hi Dave,

  You can reproduce the issue with find_package() calls only, without
calling include().

  After talking with Utkarsh, it seems the trick is to use the
VTKConfig.cmake from the paraview install tree.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting the coordinates of the point with max temperature
Message-ID: <000901cc6d66$0d644a70$282cdf50$@transim.com>

Hi,

 

I'm extremely new to Paraview scripting and Python programming, so the
question that I'm asking might have a totally obvious answer, but I can't
figure it out. I need to write a script to analyze the results of a
transient analysis simulation. For that, the script needs to read the last
.vtu file, figure out the coordinates (or index) of the point with the
largest temperature, and then pick the temperatures at that point from all
the other simulation steps and then do some computations based on those
values.

 

I got stuck at figuring out the coordinates of the point with the max
temperature. This is what I got so far:

 

reader = sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName =
'C:\\mypath\\output0020.vtu')

reader.UpdatePipeline()

info_base = reader.GetDataInformation().DataInformation

pointArray = info_base.GetPointArrayInformation()

 

I don't know how to get from pointArray to a list of points (I assume that
the info in pointArray is the list of coordinates). Then, I can go through
the temperature array obtained with
info_base.GetPointDataInformation().GetArrayInformation(..) and get the max
temperature and match it with the coordinates.  But, I'm lost at this step
on how to get from the reader to the actual array of coordinates and
temperature values.

 

I've seen posts with some calls to GetPoints, but GetPoints is not a member
of pointArray (or any other of the classes used above, for that matter).

 

Thanks,

Tibi

The arrays themselves may be extremely large, thus they live on the
server, not the client and you can't get them directly as you are
trying to do.
You can however use servermanager.Fetch to bring them over, but you
should only do so once you have filtered them down in size a bit.
Try using the threshold filter, picking out only those cells/points
near the maximum, then fetching that.

Hi,

If you do volume rendering I would avoid the AMD card. The gtx460 is a
slightly better card but not leaps and bounds better than the quadro. I
would think you would need to look at the newer GTX 560Ti and up for a
sizeable increase in performance.

I am trying to get the values of variables at the position of mouse in real
time.
That is to say, when moving the mouse, we get the values in real time.
And I need to get there values automatically, not by using probe filters
manually.

I try to auto probe the data from a source or filter. As a result, I think
it is needed
to get the input of the vtkrenderer which is set as the input of one probe
filter. Here
I failed to get the whole input of the vtkrenderer.

Is there any other way to solve this problem?

Thanks for any advice!

Hi,

I am using ParaView to read Tecplot data too. And I found that the
VisIt reader cannot read there binary data fully. Such as it cannot read
poly data.

For Tecplot ASCII data, ParaView has its own reader to read. But it also has
some problems. Maybe you can get into the codes to find which part of your
data is not identified correctly.

Good Luck!

Hi Alan

Thanks a lot for your interest/suggestion. I'm using the newest version 
of paraview, version 3.10.1, 64-bit on Ubuntu / linux - local 
installation (not on any server). I'm looking on at dataset which I'm 
not sure whether or not I'm allowed to distribute, but I'll ask the guy 
I got the data-file from tomorrow - or else I'll try to provide a simple 
(and small) example... I thought this was a known issue, but let me get 
back to it tomorrow I hope and post an example vtk-file (I need to talk 
to my colleague)...

If anyone know why "wireframe mode" shows triangles instead of the true 
quad grid, please let me know... On friday I know I have a meeting whole 
day, so if I haven't posted anything before friday I'll have to wait 
until monday with posting a minimal quad-example unfortunately...

I'll be back!

Hi David,

Thank you very much for the hint. I'm still not entirely sure I'm getting it
right, though. Here's what I've done:

reader = sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName =
'C:\\mypath\\output0020.vtu')
reader.UpdatePipeline()

info_base = reader.GetDataInformation().DataInformation
pointDataInfo = info_base.GetPointDataInformation()

temp_max = 0
# here I get the max temperature across all points
for i in range(pointDataInfo.GetNumberOfArrays()):
	ai = pointDataInfo.GetArrayInformation(i)
	if ai.GetName().lower() == 'temperature':
		temp_max = ai.GetComponentRange(0)[1]

# temp_max is computed correctly at this point, declare the threshold to be
95% to 105% of the max temperature
th = filters.Threshold(Input = reader)
th.SelectInputScalars = ['0', '0', '0', '1', 'temperature']
th.ThresholdBetween = [temp_max*0.95,temp_max*1.05]
th.UpdatePipeline()
Fetch(th)

pdi = th.GetDataInformation().DataInformation
print pdi

At this point, 'print pdi' produces this:

vtkPVDataInformation (0000000004089090)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 116455
  Reference Count: 2
  Registered Events: (none)
  RootOnly: 0
  DataSetType: 4
  CompositeDataSetType: -1
  NumberOfPoints: 0
  NumberOfRows: 0
  NumberOfCells: 0
  NumberOfDataSets: 1
  MemorySize: 0
  PolygonCount: 0
  Bounds: 1e+299, -1e+299, 1e+299, -1e+299, 1e+299, -1e+299

-2147483647
.......


It seems that there are no points selected. I'm wondering whether the
th.SelectInputScalars does what's it's supposed to do (I've copied that from
some examples in the mailing list). I'm using Paraview 3.4.0 (the latest
Paraview 3.10.1 works only in GUI, but fails to execute any script in
pvbatch).

Thanks,
Tibi

The arrays themselves may be extremely large, thus they live on the server,
not the client and you can't get them directly as you are trying to do.
You can however use servermanager.Fetch to bring them over, but you should
only do so once you have filtered them down in size a bit.
Try using the threshold filter, picking out only those cells/points near the
maximum, then fetching that.

Subject: [Paraview] camera position changes although not supposed to
Message-ID: <20110907175545.144130@gmx.net>

Hello all,

I am trying to save an animation that includes zooming in and out. I used the tool "interpolate camera locations" and chose a position for time 0 until time 0.75. Between 0.75 and 1 the camera moves because I want to zoom in. So I chose different values for the position at time 1. 
But when I save the animation my object seems to move to the back between time steps 0 and 0.75. Does anyone have an explanation for that? I would appreciate any help!

My object is a simple plane and an outline.

Unfortunately the animation is too big to be attached to this mailing list.

Thanks!
Leonie

vtkPVDataInformation is _only_ lightweight meta information. It
describes some dataset that lives on the server but doesn't give you
access to the actual data.

Fetch should return to you a vtkDataSet. You should be able to get the
points/cells and arrays directly out of that.

Thanks again. I've added this line to the end:

act_data  = Fetch(pdi)

But now pvbatch crashes with this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "GetMin.py", line 40, in <module>
    act_data = Fetch(pdi)
  File "C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView
3.4.0\lib\paraview-3.4\paraview\servermanager.py", line 1351, in Fetch
    gvd.AddInput(0, input, idx, "DONTCARE")
  File "C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView

__ConvertArgumentsAndCall
    retVal = func(*newArgs)
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (4 given)


It looks like a problem inside the code for Fetch, but not entirely sure.

Thanks,
Tibi

Subject: [Paraview] Screen flicker
Message-ID: <CA8D170E.8995%ndfabia@sandia.gov>

Hi,

I've had a problem recently with paraview causing my whole screen to flicker when it's rendering.  I've tried recompiling with different versions of Qt and with carbon vs cocoa with no luck either way.  It seems to be an opengl problem because it only happens when I'm rendering surfaces or something that uses the card.

Has anyone else experienced this or know how to fix it?  It's paraview 3.12 rc1 (latest git) Mac Pro GeForce 8600M GT, OSX 10.5.8

Thanks,
Nathan.

3.10\build-x32\OpenMPI-install\share\openmpi\help-mpi-runtime: No such file
or directory.  Sorry!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** The MPI_Init() function was called before MPI_INIT was invoked.

*** This is disallowed by the MPI standard.

*** Your MPI job will now abort.

[TRANSIM-533:9700] Abort before MPI_INIT completed successfully; not able to
guarantee that all other processes were killed!

 

 

Paraview works fine. On my system I also have Paraview 3.4.0 installed, and
pvbatch for 3.4.0 works fine, without problems. Has anyone seen this type of
error?

 

Thanks,

Tibi

Nathan,

I've seen this issue with my macbook pro too. The solution included a
visit to the MacStore and getting the motherboard replaced :). Hope
your laptop is still under warranty.

Also, try switching to the "high performance" graphics card. I had the
issue when my settings were set to use the "better battery life"
graphics card.

Thanks a lot Robert!

I will look into GTX 560Ti.? If I cannot afford it, then, I will keep the Quadro FX4600 for the time being.

Best Regards,

Pei-Ying

Hi,?

If you do volume rendering I would avoid the AMD card. The gtx460 is a slightly better card but not leaps and bounds better than the quadro. I would think you would need to look at the newer GTX 560Ti and up for a sizeable increase in performance.

That looks like an MPI setup error. Are you sure you can launch MPI
jobs correctly on this machine?

No, I don't think I can launch MPI jobs here (I remember that at some point
I was looking to run MPI jobs for some other software, but it did not run --
and did not spend much time with it anyway), but I'm not entirely sure why I
should even need MPI to run pvbatch (given that it ran fine with 3.4). Is
there a way to disable MPI use?

One point of information I forgot to mention.  It does not appear to
happen at all with a DMG downloaded from ParaView.org.  This is what led
me to think it's my fault somehow.

Subject: [Paraview] White highlight boxes around legends when using a black
	background
Message-ID: <ABD1B5752A0D724F9E100C97EA9EB7E15D1BFE3F93@exvic-mbx04.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi,

When I load a pvsm file with a black background, white highlight boxes appear around the legends. These can be removed by hovering the mouse over the legend.

However when I use a pvpython script to load the pvsm file and to output the images to a file, these undesired boxes are also visible (see below for an example) -- with no way of turning them off.

Please can this be avoided?

Cheers,
Ray

This is easy to replicate with a black background (I bet it happens normal background), Sources/wavelet, color by rtdata, add a color legend, save state, restart ParaView, load state.  It is a real bug.

Could you please log a bug on the Kitware bug tracker?

Thanks,

Alan

Dear all,

Ok - my problem was/is related to a 20-node element - please see this 
simple vtk-file and then change to "wireframe" and *pplease* tell me why 
I cannot see the true grid/mesh, but these annoying triangles that make 
up the element...

Please advice (somebody more clever than me) and perhaps suggest a 
solution so I can see the true mesh/grid for a 20-node element like I 
uploaded! :-)

Install the libgl1-mesa-dev package, it contains /usr/lib/libGL.so. 
Finding out things like this is very easy with apt-file:

sudo apt-get install apt-file
sudo apt-file update
apt-file search /usr/lib/libGL.so

No luck reproducing the problem here (see attached image). Try running
with "-dr" command line option. Wondering is some setting got changed
inadvertently that's causing this problem.

I figured out the issue with fetching, I wasn't applying it to the correct
object. However, I still can't get the Threshold filter to filter by
temperatures, and not other scalars (i.e. "pressure"). 

Here's what I have
th = filters.Threshold(Input = reader)
# this I don't understand, I've tried all sorts of combinations of the first
4 parameters
th.SelectInputScalars = ['0','0','0','1','temperature']       
th.ThresholdBetween = [0,1e+22]         # set it to a very large interval,
normally it should be [temp_max*0.55,temp_max*1.05]
th.UpdatePipeline()

thdata = Fetch(th)
pts = thdata.GetPoints()
print pts
pts_data = thdata.GetPointData()
print pts_data

And here's the relevant output:
.....
  Number Of Arrays: 5
  Array 0 name = pressure
  Array 1 name = temperature
  Array 2 name = kinetic energy
  Array 3 name = kinetic dissipation
  Array 4 name = velocity
  Number Of Components: 7
  Number Of Tuples: 39197
  Copy Tuple Flags: ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 )
  Interpolate Flags: ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 )
  Pass Through Flags: ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 )
  Scalars:
    Debug: Off
    Modified Time: 115283
    Reference Count: 4
    Registered Events: (none)
    Name: pressure
    Data type: double
    Size: 39197
    MaxId: 39196
    NumberOfComponents: 1
    Information: 00000000049EF180
    MetaData: 0000000000000000
      Debug: Off
      Modified Time: 115285
      Reference Count: 1
      Registered Events: (none)
      PER_COMPONENT: vtkInformationVector(00000000049EF1C0)
    Name: pressure
    Number Of Components: 1
    Number Of Tuples: 39197
    Size: 39197
    MaxId: 39196
    LookupTable: (none)
    Array: 0000000004DDF710
  Vectors:
....

It seems that the filter is returning the 'pressure' scalars, which I don't
need. If I set the threshold range to temp_max +/- 5%, nothing is returned.
What is the meaning of the parameters to SelectInputScalars? I've tried all
sorts of combinations, and nothing happened.

Thanks,
Tibi

vtkPVDataInformation is _only_ lightweight meta information. It describes
some dataset that lives on the server but doesn't give you access to the
actual data.

Fetch should return to you a vtkDataSet. You should be able to get the
points/cells and arrays directly out of that.

Uh, now I just tried with another pc and downloaded the file from the 
internet... I actually tried running a FEM-simulation using both 20-node 
elements and 8-node elements today and I really fear that the file I 
uploaded was a result file using 8-node elements... Please let me get 
back to work tomorrow and confirm this suspicion - if I'm right, 
paraview doesn't work using 20-node elements and then I probably 
uploaded the wrong vtk-file... If this is correct, I'll upload a new 
file tomorrow...

I'm very sorry for this confusion - since I don't have the data file(s) 
at home (where I am now), I'll have to wait until tomorrow before I can 
access my data... Please wait - I'm very sorry if I uploaded the wrong 
file :-)

And thanks, Utkarsh for testing it (my mistake, if the uploaded file is 
actually the wrong one)...

Was this issue every resolved. I am having exactly the same problem using the
most recent binary for Paraview 2.10.1 compiled for Mac OSX v 10.7.1.
The numpy module appears to be present but Paraview & the Python Calculator
filter appear to be unable to find it.
Thanks, Mark

Thanks for the help people gave me for the question below. I now have a
workable solution for much of the batch imaging I need to do.

I'd now like to add some surface rendering, that is, setting
>>> DataRepresentation.Representation = 'Surface'
>>> DataRepresentation.ColorArrayName = 'solution'

Previously, I had used the slice object to get the range of values and the
bounds:

>>> s = Slice(SliceType="Plane")
>>> m,M = s.CellData[0].GetRange()
>>> xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax =
s.GetDataInformation().DataInformation.GetBounds()

However, I no longer have the slice object. I have the DataRepresentation
object, and the RenderView, and the output of the ExodusIIReader() call.
I've also defined a number of elementblocks that I can set via:

>>> reader.ElementBlocks = ['a','b']

Can I use any of the available objects to get the data and the boundary
ranges?

Thanks in advance...

Thank you Michael, apt-file is a really useful package...
still, the library "libGL.so" and the package "libgl1-mesa-dev" was
already installed in my system (cmake automatically recognize it and
associate it to the variable OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY).
I had a look into the file "CMakeError.log" but without succes... any
other suggestion?
Bests,

Alessandro

Message-ID: <B3836EDC1F30A449B288A66560228D8814E26A7835@MSGNAMCMS02.ent.bhicorp.com>

I have created a ply file, but I am having problems viewing it in ParaView.  My faces are polygons with up to 42 segments. I have 12 faces in total, each a solid color. If I load the complete file the polygons are messed up, but all the vertices look correct. In wireframe view I see extra connections that should not be there.

If I retain just one face (and all the vertices), I can get a very nice wireframe view, but the surface view is not a solid color and strays outside the polygon segments. I can create 12 separate files, each containing one of the faces, and each one looks good in the wireframe view.

Am I missing some setting in ParaView? Have I found a bug? I am new to the program. I have attached some examples, the full file is formation.ply and face 12 is in the other file. Face 12 is especially bad about showing features outside the segments.

Hi all

Interesting news: Yesterday I tried at home (using ubuntu 11.04 and 
newest paraview, with the vtk-file I previously uploaded) and I got the 
same result as Utkarsh and probably most other people in here... 
However, at my work pc (also using ubuntu 11.04) I have previously had 
some older version of paraview installed but I used the package manager 
(synaptic) to clean *everything* before I installed newest paraview version.

So, you and me are both using the same vtk-file, but please see my 
result here as it looks on my work pc:

http://www.filedropper.com/screenshot_4

So, I'm definately not happy about paraview on my work pc - please tell 
me what could be wrong or what could be the solution... To me it 
indicates that some old paraview-stuff and/or old VTK-stuff is 
installed. Since I believe I've uninstalled all old paraview-stuff, 
please explain me which VTK-stuff (VTK-libraries) I should have 
installed on my ubuntu 11.04 pc...

I you can provide me with some hints about VTK-libraries, I think this 
could solve my problem (at least I hope)...

Thanks!

That's the old "openGL doesn't handle concave polygons so neither do
we because doing so would slow down the common case for the sake of
the rare one" feature.

Apply the tetrahedralize filter to break those up into convex polygons
and it will look right.

Ok - I think I know what the problem is...

Anyone with ATI graphics card here who can reproduce my problem? I'm 
pretty sure that if you have an ATI graphics card, you'll have the same 
problem as me...

I guess whoever the vtk-file works for, is using NVIDIA graphics cards 
(or something other than ATI) - am I right, Utkarsh?

So I'm completely sure the problem is related to the graphics card 
drivers. Can somebody here confirm my theory?

No, I'm pretty sure the problem has nothing to do with your graphics card.
 It has to do with you running in multi-core mode (Settings -> General ->
Use Multi-Core) and using quadratic elements (the 20-element hexahedra).
You have not stated, but I'm betting that it works when the Use Multi-Core
feature is off but does not work when the feature is on.

It is only fairly recently that the wireframe displays correctly for
quadratic elements, and there is a corner case where it still does not
work.  This happens to be the case when using the multi-core feature.

So in short, correct wireframes for quadratic elements in multi-core mode
is not supported.  I raised a suggestion to fix it on ParaView UserVoice.
If you want the feature fixed, go vote for it.

Try changing that to:
th.SelectInputScalars = ['0','0','0','0','temperature']

I think you are asking the filter to threshold the cell associated
array name temperature, and that yours is on the points instead.

See:
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkAlgorithm.html#a42a55ca2c277aecc909ad592d12978aa
And of course the code where that enum is declared.

Also, I think you should try to get 3.10 working on your system in
batch mode. Since 3.4, the paraview.simple layer and the Trace feature
have made paraview scripting far easier to learn.


good luck!

What is your datatype? There's an "Outline Threshold" (highlighted in
attached screenshot) accessible from Edit |Settings, that you can set
to 0 to use outline by default, but it only affects unstructured grids
or multiblocks comprising of unstructured grids, if I remember
correctly.

Paul,

How do try out your sample? When I load the plugin in ParaView
(v3.12.0-RC1-75-gf242b92), it crashes as soon as I try to show a
mandlebrot or wavelet source in the view.

Ok, I think you're completely right. I've added 3 votes and hope the 
feature will be fixed very soon!

Thanks - case closed from me and for now I'll just run without multicore

The tetrahedralize filter worked, thank you.

It is unfortunate that concave polygons are not handled well, as I expect that to be a common need trying to visualize 2D slices through irregular formation layers. I also note that a polygon can't be selected if it is in the concave region of another polygon. So far I have found no free PLY viewer that can handle my input 100%. I am looking for a way to exchange 2D model information between modeling codes. I have just completed the coding to generate the polygons, and I chose ASCII ply as an easy format to write to. Maybe I need to rethink my format and viewer.

That's the old "openGL doesn't handle concave polygons so neither do
we because doing so would slow down the common case for the sake of
the rare one" feature.

Apply the tetrahedralize filter to break those up into convex polygons
and it will look right.

Subject: [Paraview] Python Scripting for Selection of Nodes
Message-ID: <4E6BD99D.9020803@gmail.com>

Hi-

I've been using the "Extract Selection Filter" to extract nodes from a 
mesh for pre-processing of boundary conditions. Is there a way to do the 
opposite and give Paraview a bunch of nodes in the mesh and then have 
Paraview display it?

I have tried using vtkSelection and have created an appropriate 
selection node, but how do I display it?

Thanks

Hello,

I have solved the problem installing:
1) the proprietary drivers proposed by ubuntu (System ->
Administration -> Hardware Drivers)
2) replaced then by a driver downloaded directly from the nvidia site.

I am not sure, but probably if you install directly (and only) the
nvidia drivers proposed by the vendor and you ignore the suggestions
of "ubuntu" (because actually you have already installed the drivers
directly from the vendor), then there is some lacking library or some
incompatibility which is difficult to detect..

Bests,

Alessandro

I have a png file (and the same data in an mha file) that is not

You will find the png and mha here:

You will also find a screenshot (bad.jpg) of what I see when I open

Any thoughts?

Subject: [Paraview] multiple inputs for python calculator filter
Message-ID: <CA92FEAB.44D6F%mark.brandon@yale.edu>

I have been experimenting with the python calculator in Paraview 3.10.1, using the examples at the wiki page http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Calculator.
In particular, I was trying to figure out how to calculate the difference between two 3D point arrays. The sections on Accessing Data and Comparing Multiple Datasets seem to provide all that is needed to do this task.
However, I found the instructions there to be incomplete. It took me several hours to figure out that one has to highlight in the pipeline those multiple inputs you want to use before selecting the PythonCalculator filter.
In other words, the variables inputs[0], inputs[1], etc refer to the first of the highlighted pipeline entries, the second entry, etc.
It would be really helpful if the wiki included a full worked example, with this information as well.
Best,
Mark

Subject: [Paraview] PythonCalculator in Paraview 3.10.1 does not work on Mac
	OSX
Message-ID: <CA92FC3B.44D60%mark.brandon@yale.edu>

I am using the distributed binary for Paraview v. 3.10.1 and running on Mac OSX v. 10.7.1 (Lion). The PythonCalculator generates the error shown below, even when using simple cases, such as setting an array to a constant value (which is the first example shown in the wiki for the PythonCalculator). A similar error (included below) occurs when the command "import numpy" in the python shell in Paraview. My guess is that the Paraview fails to distinguish between the python version installed with Paraview, and the python version that is native to Mac OSX system.
Best, Mark

Error thrown by PythonCalculator:

Subject: [Paraview] Join two derived variables
Message-ID: <CA+-Yocp12ZVv5hVRL4vwV0SddUm9z_ovvXwvXtp5z8AxMtugAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I?m new to Paraview and I am  trying to perform a rather simple task I used
to do with Tecplot. I have the flow field of a flat plate and I want to
compare the boundary layer of my simulation with the theoretical velocity
profile of Blasius. For that, both the velocity tangetial to the plate and
the distance normal to the plate have to be turn dimensionless. This is how
I?ve tried to do it in Paraview:
I open the solution file with the Tecplot reader, I add two Calculator
filters to derive the dimensionless variables, then I join the two results
with the Group Datasets filter. At that point I can find the two
dimensionless variables in the Object inspector when the GroupDatasets1
object is activated in the pipeline. The problem is that only one of the two
new variables is displayed appropriately with "Display, Color by" or by
applying the Plot Over Line filter.

Am I making some fundamental mistake?   How would you people do this?

Another funny thing is that for the Group Datasets object, I see in the
Information tab that I now have twice as many points and cells. That?s not
what I wanted and sounds pretty inefficient. I only want to create new
variables for already existing cells.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Pablo Mosquera

Pablo,

Group Datasets filter is combines two or more datasets to form a
multiblock dataset comprising of the original datasets. I don't think
that's what you mean to do here. When you apply the two calculators,
are you applying both to the reader? You may want to apply them one
after the other i.e. input of Calc2 is Calc2. Then when you do a plot
over line, you'll see both the variables.

I think the filter you want is append attributes.  The append attributes filter takes two datasets with the same topology and combines their fields into one dataset.  The group datasets builds an assembly of parts.  Thus, your group datasets filter (if I understand correctly) has two parts that are coincident with each other.

Thank you very much for your promt answer. Yes, I was applying both
calculators direct to the reader. I?ve tried what you told me and it?s
exactly what I wanted.

Many thanks!!

Thank you for the information. I ended up simply loading all the points from
the reader (without any filter) and computing myself the maximum. The
advantage was that I could also get the global index of the point with the
maximum, which means that when processing all the subsequent files from the
transient simulation, I could simply load all the points and access directly
the point with the respective global index to get the temperature.

I was wondering, is there a filter that provides the temperature at a point
with user-provided coordinates? If the coordinates happen to match one of
the points in the mesh, that's good, but what if the coordinates don't match
any of the points.

Thanks,
Tibi

Try changing that to:
th.SelectInputScalars = ['0','0','0','0','temperature']

I think you are asking the filter to threshold the cell associated array
name temperature, and that yours is on the points instead.

See:
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkAlgorithm.html#a42a55ca2c277aecc
909ad592d12978aa
And of course the code where that enum is declared.

Also, I think you should try to get 3.10 working on your system in batch
mode. Since 3.4, the paraview.simple layer and the Trace feature have made
paraview scripting far easier to learn.


good luck!

Sorry for the double reply. I've tried to use 3.10, and posted on the
paraview list an output of the errors that I receive, but, so far, no one
seem to have any idea on how to fix the issue. There seems to be something
related to MPI setup, but can't figure out what it is.

Thanks,
Tibi

Hi Utkarsh,

Did you load the SurfaceLIC plugin first? - I probably should have put it in
as a dependency but this is only an example to show how the display options
aren't there for the representation from a plugin.  (Also, try the sphere
source.)

I did find a solution to my problem in the end although it is not ideal as
it involved patching ParaView source specifically for my plugin.
In pqStandardServerManagerModelInterface::createPQProxy it is hard coded to
create a pqPipelineRepresentation when xml_type ==
"ImageSliceRepresentation" (pqStandardServerManagerModelInterface:139) and
so I added my representation name too. Can you think of a better way to do
this?

Thanks,
Paul

I think this is a good idea and would be a useful example.  I'm not sure how
difficult it is to create an account to modify that page but if you want to
put together an example I'll make sure it gets added to the wiki.

Subject: [Paraview] memory allocation problem when saving animation
Message-ID: <20110912165911.146220@gmx.net>

Hi,

I am trying to save an animation with a large amount of data. It is vtk binary data in 2D and 3D and I add some common filters to it such as Calculators, Extract Cells by Region, warp by scalar and a contour. Every time I try to save the animation it crashes after about a third or maybe half of the time steps because of a memory allocation problem. I am using ParaView 3.10.1 on a Linux CentOS 64bit system.
I found a bug report (ID 0011982) concerning a memory leak in 3.10.0 but it is supposed to be fixed in 3.10.1
Has anyone else experienced this problem? Or is there an easy solution to the problem? This doesn't seem to be a problem in 3.8.1. But because of another bug in that earlier version I can't use 3.8.1.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Leonie

Subject: [Paraview] compute min/max of data array and annotate max and min
	values for each time step
Message-ID: <BB6BFB83-4722-46F0-A4DD-DAB8C8314CA2@mimectl>

Hello,
I am a ParaView newbie and I am trying to compute the maximum and minimum values of one array (e.g. pressure or density) in a multi-block dataset (*.exo) file in ParaView, and then display those maximum and minimum values on screen with text. To make this more fun, the dataset includes time data, and so what I really want to be able to do is to compute the maximum and minimum values of the array and display them on-screen for each time step so that when I animate the data, the max/min values update as the animation runs. 
Could someone point me in the right direction for how to do this?
I looked at the Calculator filter, but I don't see any maximum and minimum functions there (not that I expected to see them). And I just started looking at the Python Programmable Filter, but I am not familiar with the vtk class and so this route will involve a bit of a learning curve to figure out the syntax for what I need to accomplish.
Thanks,
Emily

I have been away from this for a little while and now I'm coming back to it.


The Summary Panels do look like what I am trying to end up with. So
essentually, would I have to move all the representation controls that I
have on the Properties tab over to the Display tab and then add each of them
to the Summary Tab through the XML?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] how to get all the arrays associated with Point and Cell
 data in a filter
Message-ID: <c720351daab59bbfd5582c25e424f1ed.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

I am writing a custom filter that takes polydata as input and outputs
polydata
that contains a subset of the cells in the input polydata.
I would like the output polydata to include all the vector/scalar etc arrays
associated with the input, appropriately subsetted.
I think I have working code, but I think it only grabs e.g. 1 scalar array
associated with point data (via input->GetPointData()->GetScalars();)
 How would I access multiple associated scalar arrays ?

The only way I found to implement getting even just the single scalar array
is a sort of brute force loop that saves point/cell ids I want to keep
(code snippet below).
Is this the best way to implement this ?

thanks
kate


=========================================================
// code snippet for filter to take polydata as input and output polydata
// with a subset of input polydata cells

int vtkMyFilter::RequestData(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
                                         vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
                                         vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{

// allocate vectors to store vtk ids of cells and points I want to keep
vtkIdList *outcellids = vtkIdList::New ();
outcellids->Allocate(num_cells_in,0);

vtkIdList *outptids = vtkIdList::New ();
outptids->Allocate(num_points_in,0);


// loop over input lines, decide what to keep
for(lines->InitTraversal(); lines->GetNextCell(npts,pts); num_poly++) {

	if (I want this cell) {

		out_line_cnt++;
		out_tot_pt_ctr = out_tot_pt_ctr + npts;

		// collect pt ids for output vectors
		for (k=0; k < npts; k++) {
			outptids->InsertNextId ((const vtkIdType) in_tot_pt_ctr++);
		}

		// collect cell ids for output
		outcellids->InsertNextId ((const vtkIdType) num_poly);

	}
	// not adding this line, just update points counter for input points array
	else {
		in_tot_pt_ctr =  in_tot_pt_ctr + npts;
	}
}


// copy line/point data to output
outcellids->Squeeze();
outptids->Squeeze();
output->Allocate(input,num_cells_in,0);
output->CopyCells(input, outcellids, NULL);
output->Squeeze();

/////// copy point data active??? vectors
invec = input->GetPointData()->GetVectors();
if (invec != NULL) {
	num_comp = invec->GetNumberOfComponents();

	outvec =  invec->NewInstance();
	outvec->SetNumberOfComponents(num_comp);
	outvec->SetNumberOfTuples(out_tot_pt_ctr);
	outvec->SetName(invec->GetName());
	for (i=0; i<out_tot_pt_ctr; i++) {
		outvec->InsertTuple(i,invec->GetTuple(outptids->GetId(i)));
	}
	output->GetPointData()->SetVectors(outvec);
}

// repeat for
//	input->GetPointData()->GetScalars();
//	input->GetCellData()->GetVectors();
//	input->GetCellData()->GetScalars();
//	etc

}

This sounds quite similar to what is going on in the vtkThreshold filter.
You'll probably want to look at that implementation.

Subject: [Paraview] compute min/max of data array and annotate max and

Emily,

Attached is a custom filter that you can use to label using maximum
for point array named ACCL. You change the "ARRAYNAME" and
"ARRAYASSOCIATION" variable to pick the array of choice. Also, though
I've only implemented getting the max value for the magnitude of the
array, you can change the python script to do a min or a particular
component, for example.

To test,
1) Import the attached file using Tools | Manage Custom Filters dialog
(click Import).
2) The open can.ex2 from ParaViewData. Enable all arrays in the array
selection widget on the properties panel. Hit apply.
3) Create "MaxLabelFilter". Hit apply. You'll see a label in the 3D
view that updates as you animate.

Are you running with a parallel pvserver? If so, I'll have to update
the filter. It should work in serial though.

Utkarsh,

Thanks! This works pretty well in serial. However, I took your MaxLabelFilter and tried to modify it to calculate and display minimum (instead of maximum) array values for each time step and for some reason it isn't working -- just assigns a zero value as the minimum. Could you take a quick look? I saved the XML file as a *.txt file in case my email tries to strip the attachment.

And yes, I will be working in parallel, but not right now.

Thanks again,
Emily

Hi All,

The solution was to not write Nodes and Elements but N and E (in
Tecplot both are ok), remove the DT entry (I only have single type
variables anyway). I think the problem was that one has to specify
every variable or none while tecplot just fills in with single by
default. However that wasn't obvious from the error messages. Oh and
one has to name the x,y and z coordinates to exactly that (or
capitals), which I found in one of the header files. Hope this helps
someone to use the visitreader for tecplot ascii files.

Cheers,
Ingvar

Subject: [Paraview] How does one rescale CSVReader data via pvpython?
Message-ID: <4E710EB0.3000400@slac.stanford.edu>

Hi.

I've got a simple script to read a csv file and open a new plot window.  
One of the columns in the data file needs to be rescaled.  I've had poor 
luck googling around and looking at examples.  Does anyone have any 
suggestions?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Greg

Here is the working (except for scaling) macro so far:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

XYChartView1 = CreateXYPlotView()
XYChartView1.ViewTime=0.0

animscene = GetAnimationScene()
animscene.ViewModules = [ XYChartView1 ]

filename = '/raid/schussma/work2/ace3p/paraview/macros/wakeplot/wake.out'
wake_out = CSVReader(FileName=filename,
                      FieldDelimiterCharacters = ' ',
                      HaveHeaders = 0)

################################################################################
# What is the right approach for this section?

data = servermanager.Fetch(wake_out)      # can't use wake_out directly
print "rows:", data.GetNumberOfRows()     # works
print "cols:", data.GetNumberOfColumns()  # works

# get largest magnitude value from column 2

# how?


# rescale column 1

# how?


# have PlotData use this new data instead of the original wake_out

# how?

################################################################################

pd = PlotData(wake_out)

dr = Show(pd,
           XArrayName = 'Field 0',
           AttributeType = 'Row Data',
           SeriesVisibility = ['vtkOriginalIndices', '0'])

Render()

Attached is the python script to use in the filer. I've added a new
MODE that can be used to set to use min or max.

Greg,

I would not use Fetch to do what you need. Here is something that should work:

# reuse your wake_out proxy

di = wake_out.GetDataInformation()
rowInfo = di.GetRowDataInformation()

# get largest magnitude value from column 2

rowInfo.GetArrayInformation(1).GetComponentRange(0)[1]

#You then use a programmable filter with the following copy op.
#one deepcopy to get your initial array, and then you scale it the way you want
# you may discard the old array later


import vtk

input = self.GetInput()

newcol0 = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()

newcol0.DeepCopy(input.GetColumn(0))

for i in range(newcol0.GetNumberOfTuples()):

newcol0.SetValue(i, 2.0 * newcol0.GetValue(i)) # rescale by a factor of 2


output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

output.AddColumn(newcol0)

print output.GetNumberOfColumns()

Message-ID: <10cff029854e063b30aac317c726c87c.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

I made a custom filter that takes polydata as input.  When I select it
from the menu
it always goes to the end of the pipeline, regardless of what pipeline
step is selected/highlighted.
If I have a polydata dataset selected midway thru the pipeline I'd like my
filter to jump in as a
sub-step of the selected step, the way the threshold filter does.
Is there some XML or C++ magic I need to add for this to happen ?

thanks
Kate

	unstructured grid
Message-ID: <CAAuKGDMBNaJY9fbVXNVB9m2UBJ6cHezyj_MwxeKZ4Bab3iaZZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I have a .vtk dataset containing an unstructured grid with scalars.
Paraview seems to be able to volume render the dataset (and it
mentions vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper in the progress bar while
doing the rendering). The dataset contains not only tetrahedra, but
other cell types as well.

I would like to do the same volume rendering using VTK only, however
am experiencing some difficulties. The volume rendering mapper gives
an error message stating that only tetrahedral elements are supported
for the rendering. As long as Paraview really relies on
vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper, there has to be a way to modify
the original untructured grid so that the non terahedral cells are
removed / transformed.

My question is if anyone should have some suggestion about how to do
this conversion, or by what means it should be possible to get the
volume rendering working for this kind of dataset.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

ParaView internally runs the vtkDataSetTriangleFilter filter to subdivide
all cells into tetrahedra.

Hi, Jean.

Thank you for helping.   On your suggestion, I tried removing the Fetch, 
but then I was getting empty objects.  From googling around a bit, I 
realized that I needed to call wake_out.UpdatePipeline() before moving on.

Because this is pretty ad-hoc, I'd prefer to avoid creating a filter, 
and just keep the macro self-contained.  I'm having difficulty finding 
how to connect inputs and outputs.  I've spent a lot of time with 
google, and with the dir() command, but still don't see how to get at 
the data.

Thanks for your contiuned help.   Below is what I currently have.

Greg

##########################
# this part seems good

filename = '/raid/schussma/work2/ace3p/paraview/macros/wakeplot/wake.out'
wake_out = CSVReader(FileName=filename,
                      FieldDelimiterCharacters = ' ',
                      HaveHeaders = 0)
wake_out.UpdatePipeline()  # this is necessary!  blank objects otherwise...

##########################
# here is the mystery

di = wake_out.GetDataInformation()
ri = di.GetRowDataInformation()

scale = 1.0/ri.GetArrayInformation(2).GetComponentRange(0)[1]

input = ???  # what goes here?

import vtk
newcol0 = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
newcol0.DeepCopy(input.GetColumn(1))

for i in range(newcol0.GetNumberOfTuples()):
   newcol0.SetValue(i, scale * newcol0.GetValue(i))  # rescale

   output = ???.GetOutputDataObject(0)
   output.AddColumn(newcol0)

##########################
# this was good without the scaling

pd = PlotData(???)   # is no longer wake_out, correct?
dr = Show(pd,
           XArrayName = 'Field 0',
           AttributeType = 'Row Data',
           SeriesVisibility = ['vtkOriginalIndices', '0'])

Greg,

sorry if I did not explain fully. After reading your data, it is the active source. if you instantiate a ProgrammableFilter (PF), it takes wake_out as its input. But you can also set it explicitly as the source.
inside the PF, you have VTK objects, so you can use VTK methods. Here is a script that works for me. The last point is to manually create a spreadsheet, because I just don't find a python command for it.

I load this as "paraview --script=script.py" and it scales the data just fine.

I see that Summary Panels will be release in ParaView 4. Do you have any
idea when the expected release date will be?

Subject: [Paraview] Adding Multiple Panels
Message-ID: <379365967AE5C74EB65A323F6DE2BF0A1005DACB@ucolhp4g.easf.csd.disa.mil>

I am having trouble adding a custom panel and a display panel decorator to the same plugin within my CMakeLists.txt. Are there any examples of this? Or a place where things like QT4_WRAP_CPP, QT4_WRAP_UI etc are explained? 

I tried doing two instances of the QT4_* calls writing to separate vars (IFACES_PANEL1 and IFACES_PANEL2, MOCS_PANEL1 and MOCS_PANEL2, etc).  I then combined the vars into a single var (IFACES, MOCS_SRCS, etc) and provided them to ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN as you would with only one panel. I was hoping this would add them both but It seems to not find the second panels source cxx in the IFACES. 

Any idea how to accomplish this?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

Hi, Jean.

That worked perfectly.

Thank you very much.

I also encountered this behaviour, the memory just fills up until
there is nothing available anymore, then it crashes. On the
mailinglist I could find a message about the same issue for 3.10.0. It
was then suggested that in settings>animation the geometry caching
should be turned off, but I didn't try that yet.

It is vtk binary data in 2D and 3D and I add some common filters to it such as Calculators, Extract Cells by Region, warp by scalar and a contour. Every time I try to save the animation it crashes after about a third or maybe half of the time steps because of a memory allocation problem. I am using ParaView 3.10.1 on a Linux CentOS 64bit system.

Message-ID: <CAOka_GjHb4B8Qw669j_FTUczfF0-G-7_4N_bUJFHm+6_UTpEzA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone

I'm trying to reproduce the Custom Filter example at
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Custom_Filters
as a step in creating a yet more customized filter. In the end I want
to be able to just click on the surface
and get additional surface stream lines based on each clicked point.
Similar to in tecplot for those who are familiar with
streamtracing there...

Could someone please give me the details of the choices made in this example?
I'm assuming the disk_out_ref.ex2 file is the one from the Paraview
tutorial, but where
is the slice made, what points are the the mask filter working on, etc.?
At the moment I don't even get stream lines in the plane as it should.

Cheers,
Ingvar

This seems to be related to OpenGL. Did you compile your own Mesa,
like describe in the wiki or did you do something else ?

Thanks,

Seb

PS: I've attached the ParaView mailing list so other could benefit

Do you have a server X running ? If not, OSMesa is used but by default
it will find you system library that are very bad and very
inefficient.
Check this wiki page:

It seems that if you compile the latest source (I used
3.12.0-RC1-92-g35250ec 64-bit) and turn off geometry caching, it works
without problems.

I verified that the problem also occurs in 3.10.1 with geometry
caching turned off. It's not only with time series data, because if I
load a single file and make the camera orbit it, saving the animation
will still make it crash. I can see that the memory is leaking; if I
quit during the animation rendering (say somewhere halfway) and delete
the entire pipeline, the memory consumed by ParaView is still about
3GB, hence it doesn't really free it.

It is vtk binary data in 2D and 3D and I add some common filters to it such as Calculators, Extract Cells by Region, warp by scalar and a contour.

Bonjour,

Has anyone tried the 3DVision Pro de Nvidia with ParaView in stereo mode (Crystal Eyes) ? 

According to  Nvidia website my graphic card is compatible. Here is the configuration of my workstation.
	* Station HP Bi-opteron xw9400
   	 * 2 x processeur Dual-Core AMD Opteron 2222 ?  3,0 Ghz
   	 * M?moire 64 Go de m?moire vive DDR-667 ECC, 8Go Swap
   	 * Carte graphique NVIDIA Quadro FX3700 ?  512 Mo
   	 * RHEL release 5.5

I'll use a 27" LCD display with a frequency of 120Hz.

Thank you for your help, I want to be sure prior to the purchase of this equipment.

Jo?lle

Subject: [Paraview] attach filebrowser to box in properties panel and does
 RequestData() block dialogs
Message-ID: <8a40f45b6304b640954e8a4da35cd092.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

Is there a way to attach a filebrowser to a textbox or dropdown list in
the properties panel in a custom filter via the XML spec ?

Since I didn't see the way to do that I added a pqFileDialog dialog() call
in my filter RequestData() method.  It came up ok but did not respond to
any mouse/keyboard input.  I tried moving the dialog() call to my filter
constructor, just to see if it worked there, and it worked fine.
Is mouse/keyboard interaction blocked during execute of RequestData() ?
For the server/parent parameters to dialog() I used
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel()->getItemAtIndex<pqServer*>(0);
pqCoreUtilities::mainWidget()


(I know its gross to try to put a dialog() in RequestData(), but we at least
temporarily need a little junk file from the user, not worth writing a reader
for, would prefer to add filebrowser to properties panel if I can do that
easily).

thanks
kate

Hi,
I'm tring to build Paraview 3.10 (and python 3.1) on a Windows7 64bit OS with MSVC2008.
In Cmake I set:
//Path to a program.
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=C:/Python31/python.exe

//Path to a file.
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=C:/Python31/include

//Path to a library.
PYTHON_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=C:/Python31/libs/libpython31.a

but in Degub mode or Release mode i got this error:

LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'python31.lib'.

What's wrong? Hope somebody could help me..
Thanks a lot
Concetta

As far as I am aware python 3.x will not work with ParaView or VTK. Python
2.7.2 is fine though.

Looks like you are mixing compilers. I mean .a files are from gcc and
.lib files are from Visual Studio. These are not compatible.

As far as I am aware python 3.x will not work with ParaView or VTK. Python 2.7.2 is fine though.

I'll try with

and I'll let you know. Thanks!

As John was saying, are you trying to build with visual studio or
mingw/msys? If Visual studio then you need to point it to python27.lib not
.a. If mingw then you need to launch cmake-gui from the msys console and
select MSYS Makefiles as your generator (blow away your build tree and
configure from scratch).

I followed your advices about python 2.7 and solved the problem. I downloaded and used the wrong Windows binary (Python 2.7.2 Windows X86-64 Installer - Windows AMD64 / Intel 64 / X86-64
binary). The right binary is  Python 2.7.2 Windows Installer - Windows binary.
So finally I receive no more errors in debug mode but I have a question: where is the paraview.exe file?
Thanks to everyone for your support!

If you change the installation directory (to somehting other than C:\Program

David - I don't get that far.  When I open up the installer, the first thing that happens is that I'm prompted for the admin password.    It doesn't get to the point of asking me where I want to install.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem loading textures in python
Message-ID: <4E79F963.7030202@ichec.ie>

Hi,

I'm using paraview 3.10.1  (on a mac), and having problems adding a 
texture.
I can do it in the GUI - I create a TextureMapToPlane filter, and select 
the texture (a PNG file)
in the combo box. My problem is that I need to do this within a python 
script, and
when I use the trace facility I get something like

   t1 = TextureMaptoPlane()
   rep = Show()
   rep.Texture = []

no mention of how to load the PNG file and apply it.
I can load a png file with
   pngf = PNGSeriesReader(FileNames = ['/home/a/texture.png']

but how do I apply it?

Regards,
Alastair

Can anyone point me to an example of a representarion which interacts with IceT in any n on standard way. Geometry and UGVolume Representations use a vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor and then IceT takes over.

I'd like toe skip the vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor (which is ok), but I'm not sure how to interact with IceT and see how it doe the image summation etc.

Are there any odd representations out there I can use as examples?

Thanks

John,

If you look more closely, you should see that the data is only distributed when transparency is on.  If everything is opaque, then everything stays where it is.  If I remember correctly, there is a flag in vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor that turns it to a pass-through filter.  It's implemented like this because it's more convenient than changing around the internal pipeline.  If you never have to do ordered compositing, you could just remove this filter.  Likewise, you can set the parallel render manager to do non-ordered compositing and just forget about the parallel k-d tree.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb: True color volume rendering
Message-ID: <1316649941.49544.YahooMailClassic@web161614.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi Sebastien
??? Thanks to all the help from you guys we made good progress regarding rendering multi-channel volumes. The users have come back with another request that I've been unsuccessful in resolving.

The original volumes are a stack of RGB images and the users are familiar with seeing them as images. During volume rendering since the lookuptable changes the colors, they are confused by the features and want to render the true color of the voxels. I've been toying with generating a LUT that could map the 16-bit 3-channel RGB color to a linear table and basically the table was so big that my standalone Paraview failed to load it up successfully.

I was wondering if there was any easy way to use access the texture based volume mappers provided by VTK ? I can write code using a vtkVolumeTextureMapper3D class to render the volume with correct colors. If I could access the mapper through ParaviewWeb, I could render true colors.

Any thoughts ?

Thanks
Raj?

Subject: [Paraview] reader plugin in pvbatch
Message-ID: <98E5DDD1-43F6-48A5-B6CF-CD59004CE071@mcs.anl.gov>

Hi,

I have a custom ParaView reader plugin that I've written, which works as expected when loaded and used through the GUI, but I'm having trouble getting it to work with pvbatch.  I have tried a couple of different approaches, with varying degrees of success.  The one that gets furthest is this..

Using the GUI I load the plugin.  I'm running in client/server mode, so load the plugin for both sides.  I then load a custom data file using this plugin.  An unstructured grid is generated and rendered, this works as expected.  I then save the state.
If I relaunch ParaView and the pvserver, again load the plugin on both sides, and load the state file that I just saved, the data is loaded and rendered.  So far, so good.

For pvbatch I try running with the following script:

------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

servermanager.LoadPlugin('/home/insley/libMyCustomReader.so')
servermanager.LoadState("/home/insley/my_state_flle.pvsm")

curView = GetRenderView()
SetActiveView(curView)
curView.ViewSize = [1920, 1080]
curView.StillRender()
WriteImage("/home/insley/test_image.png")
-----------------

I call DebugOn() in the constructor of my class, and see lots of output from pvbatch so it seems that the plugin is getting loaded correctly.  I see output from the RequestInformation() in my reader class, but I do not see anything from the RequestData() method.  So it appears that RequestData() is never called, and the actual data is not being read from disk.  Is there something additional that I need to do to cause that to be invoked?

After the RequestInformation() output I see a number of printouts about my class being Registered and UnRegistered by other classes (vtkClientServerInterpreter, vtkCompositeDataPipeline, etc) and the output from my class' destructor.

A black image (of resolution 1920x1080) is saved to /home/insley/test_image.png

Any insight that folks could provide would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
joe.

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting 3d point data in paraview
Message-ID: <576EC77D-ED21-40FD-B17C-CB1E636B1780@glasgow.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

I am a fairly new user of Paraview but I am having difficulty in plotting a very large set of 3D point data. I output data from Fortran to a .vtk file using the polydata dataset followed by the point_data for each particle. (I output the data in ASCII format at the moment, still not sure how to do the binary output with Fortran..) Loading the resultant vtk file into Paraview and using the Glyph filter I can assign a sphere to each point and get a good plot of the 3D position using the default Glyph filter options (max number of 5000 points).

The problem arises when I try to plot all my particles in paraview by increasing the maximum number of points in the Glyph filter. I am trying to plot around 190000 particles and if I set the filter to plot this Paraview just chokes! I have done such plots in the past using Tecplot so I know this isn't impossible.

Can anyone offer any help with this problem?

I should say that I am running this on an 8-core workstation with 24Gb of RAM, so I doubt I am hitting RAM limits ;-)

Try using a 2d point instead of a 3D sphere to cut down on the
rendering load. Also try using the point sprite plugin. The display
will let you scale and otherwise adjust the appearance of the points
according to the data values.

Hi,

I'm generating screenshots from 3-D visualizations using paraview scripting

This works but almost half my screen image is "background". Within paraview,
I can zoom in, but when writing screenshots via python, what variable do 
I set?

Message-ID: <9ADB51F6D24A47D5B2230253D9FDF0F1@win.ara>


Dear All,

I'm having intermittent issues with getting filters I create to appear under
the same menu item. I use the same, standard client.xml file for each, but
some appear under the menu item I tell it to, whilst others will just appear
under the standard alphabetical list. This is my standard xml file:

<ParaViewFilters>
  <Category name="ARA" menu_label="&amp;ARA">
    <Filter name="NicePictureGenerator"/>
  </Category>
</ParaViewFilters>

I assume having this file is a base requirement. Is there anything else I
may need or have missed to force the filters to appear under the menu in
question?

Thanks,

Adriano

The best way to learn what variables/functions to use is to turn on the Python Trace feature in the GUI, change what you want to change, then see what the trace says. 

In this instance, pull up something to look at, turn on the trace, zoom in, then turn off the trace and it will show you how to do the same thing in python.

Thanks, thats been my modus operandi until now, and it appears that the 
"view" variables for the camera viewpoint
are whats needed; they are the only ones listed as changed in the 
trace.  But no matter how I change them in the script, it still seems to 
take up the middle half of the image only (i am appending screenshots to 
make an animation, and its very annoying).

The RenderView.CameraParallelScale does it I believe. At least, that's what popped out of my trace awhile back and it seems to zoom in.

Subject: [Paraview] animating a vrml mesh
Message-ID: <4E7B6D0F.5090507@googlemail.com>

Hi there, I am currently visualizing Particle data as an unstructured 
grid in paraview, using a .pvd file that collects all the .vtu files 
together.
I now have the problem that I want to visualize a mesh e.g. a .vrml 
file, and animate it, meaning I would like to update its position and 
orientation with every time step from the corresponding .vtu file.
I did not find a paraview forum so I am hoping someone here is willing 
to give me some hint on how to do this. Or I would have to program my 
own source or use the programmable sources or filters.
when I simply open the .wrl file I get in the info tab:
Multi-block Dataset
0: Polygonal Mesh
Only in the "Display" tab I can change the position of the Mesh or add a 
transformation filter, but either way I would have to enter the position 
for each timestep. Now I think there must be a better way to do that and 
someone here knows the answer already?

Cheers, Skidzo

Subject: [Paraview] Texture Coordinates in python calculator
Message-ID: <4E7B7F4F.106@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

I'm trying to generater a Texture coordinates array using the position 
of my points.
For this I used the python calculator with this formula, (With the 
Result Array Name: Texture Coordinates)

coordsX/256*iHat+coordsY/1024*jHat

the problem is that the python calculator keep putting an extra column 
in my data (like 0*kHat). In the information tab, I can see 3 components 
in my new field. So the Apply Texture is grey and I cant use it.

Any idea how to force the python calculator not to put the extra 
component to my new array, or any other way to create the Texture 
coordinates in an ease way. ;)

using paraview 3.10.1 (64bit) in a linux.

Thanks

Thanks. I tried using the latest version but unfortunately it didn't work. Just opening Paraview already consumed more and more memory although we didn't load any data. But we might have done something wrong compiling the code.
It seems like 3.4.0 doesn't have this memory leakage. But the camera motion is still very basic in that version.

Hi kate,

Perhaps you can try adding <FileListDomain name="files"/> to the
string vector property that holds file name. Several examples are in

Subject: [Paraview] Dodgy windows built
Message-ID: <FC17C27D1141BF4C945453BACB1CB1D104778D13@GLKMS2100.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi,
 
I have several plug-ins that work fine in Linux, and have been using
them for some time within Linux.  They are compiled in under Linux using
cmake etc.  However, when I built the same plugins on windows using
cmake etc and visual studio, while it builds and links no problems, it
displays nothing when I use it.  That is to say in windows all the menus
are there, all others functions work fine, but when I use my plug-in, a
reader, it renders nothing in the window.  Looking in the statistics
object inspector everything is suspiciously set to +- Inf, instead of
the domain extents which are correct under Linux  Not sure if this adds
any information.  
 
So to recap, may own built of paraview built with my own plug-ins runs
fine in windows for standard paraview options, but when using the
plugins, while I get the same feedback, it displays nothing??
 
Any help appreciated,
Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Using field data as text source?
Message-ID: <4E7CB79B.9050104@lunartech.org>

Hi all,

I've been using ParaView to view discrete element model data, imported 
as a time series of legacy VTK files. I've just added field data to the 
output data so that I have per-timestep global data (e.g. thermal energy 
of the system, number of particles etc.). This loads into ParaView fine 
alongside by particle data.

Now I would like to write this out to the screen as text during 
animations, but can't figure out a way to do it - can the text source 
not use a Field Data variable as its source? Is there something I'm 
missing, or should I hit python?

Regards,

Mark

Joe,

I believe you're hitting the "GetRenderView()" bug that was recently
fixed in git-master. Try obtaining the render view by using
GetRenderViews()[0] instead. Does that help?

Ken

After looking through the sources a little more, I see that the example plugin RenderPassViews does something similar to what I'm after. It add a render pass at the end which applies an edge detection algorithm, This happens after compositing - which is what I need.

However, this renderpass applies to all mappers/actors in the renderer/view, so if I used this strategy, then my post processing RGB correction from the mapper+compositing would happen to all actors, and this is no good.

So it looks like what I want to do won't be possible, because there'd be no way to composite one actor individually and then blend with the others later.

Since you don't know what it is I'm trying to do, it is probably unclear, but in short, the mapper renders the data on each process, and after all RGB images are summed in the compositing phase a correction must be applied to the RGB values (but its not commutative, so can't be applied on each process individually). (unless I modify the algorithm which might be possible, I'll check on this)

One approach might be to add a separate pass which renders only the special geometry, but I suspect this will be too hard because the blending phases would all need to be tweaked so that the compositing happened twice (?) - once for the special stuff, once for everything else.

Can you tell if I've I understood things properly from my suppositions above, and if so, any other tips I might look into before I consider algorithmic changes.

Thanks

JB

John,

If you look more closely, you should see that the data is only distributed when transparency is on.  If everything is opaque, then everything stays where it is.  If I remember correctly, there is a flag in vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor that turns it to a pass-through filter.  It's implemented like this because it's more convenient than changing around the internal pipeline.  If you never have to do ordered compositing, you could just remove this filter.  Likewise, you can set the parallel render manager to do non-ordered compositing and just forget about the parallel k-d tree.

Can anyone point me to an example of a representarion which interacts with IceT in any n on standard way. Geometry and UGVolume Representations use a vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor and then IceT takes over.

I'd like toe skip the vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor (which is ok), but I'm not sure how to interact with IceT and see how it doe the image summation etc.

Are there any odd representations out there I can use as examples?

Thanks

Hello

I have a limited experience in python programming and Im encountering an issue trying to generate a stl file out of a xyz file in Paraview.
My plan is to use "TableToPoints" Command then "Delaunay2D" to create a stl file in the python shell. The main issue is that after changing the initial xyz file by putting X,Y,Z for the first line then separating numerical values with commas, I cannot change the X, Y,Z columns in Paraview TableToPoints frame. In other words, I have initially a window with X Column, Y column and Z column all set to X.


What I have written so far is :

reader = OpenDataFile("/home/projects/stud_temp/Guillaume/AllScripts/ScriptsParaview/testXyz2.csv")
paraview.simple._create_view("SpreadSheetView")
a=TableToPoints(reader)

After these few script lines I would then write something like : paraview.servermanager.filters.TableToPoints.YColumn = "Y"
but I couldnt find anything related to this topic on paraview forums.

Any help would be really appreciated

Thank you for your time

Guillaume

Hi John,

I see two solutions to your pb : 
1/ you can setup special keys to tell the renderpass if a given actor 
should be rendered or not by this pass. You can then branch your 
renderpasses on two paths, one that does your special compositing and 
post-processing on the actors that you flagged with the special key, one 
that does traditionnal rendering for all other actors, and you then need 
to compose the 2 resulting images.

2/ You could setup an internal renderpass on your mapper that uses the 
IceT compositing mechanism, apply your post-processing internally, then 
render the result of this compositing on the current framebuffer.

Option 2 should be better since your render effect seems to be 
actor-centric.
Best,
Stephane

That all sounds correct.  Option 2 might get a little dodgy because the IceT parallel render manager does all sorts of funny things with the renderer and render window buffers to handle tile displays.  There will also be some oddness with an actor compositing an image that gets pasted to a framebuffer that gets composited again.

I think Option 1 (or some variant of it) would be easier to implement even if it does break encapsulation.

Hi John,

I see two solutions to your pb :
1/ you can setup special keys to tell the renderpass if a given actor should be rendered or not by this pass. You can then branch your renderpasses on two paths, one that does your special compositing and post-processing on the actors that you flagged with the special key, one that does traditionnal rendering for all other actors, and you then need to compose the 2 resulting images.

2/ You could setup an internal renderpass on your mapper that uses the IceT compositing mechanism, apply your post-processing internally, then render the result of this compositing on the current framebuffer.

Option 2 should be better since your render effect seems to be actor-centric.
Best,
Stephane

Can you tell if I?ve I understood things properly from my suppositions above, and if so, any other tips I might look into before I consider algorithmic changes.

John,

If you look more closely, you should see that the data is only distributed when transparency is on.  If everything is opaque, then everything stays where it is.  If I remember correctly, there is a flag in vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor that turns it to a pass-through filter.  It's implemented like this because it's more convenient than changing around the internal pipeline.  If you never have to do ordered compositing, you could just remove this filter.  Likewise, you can set the parallel render manager to do non-ordered compositing and just forget about the parallel k-d tree.

Can anyone point me to an example of a representarion which interacts with IceT in any n on standard way. Geometryand UGVolume Representations use a vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor and then IceT takes over.

I?d like toe skip the vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor (which is ok), but I?m not sure how to interact with IceT and see howit doe the image summation etc.

Are there any odd representations out there I can use as examples?

I like your 2.

As a starting point to see how it all fits together, I decided to create a renderview cloned from the renderviews plugin which did the RGB correction in a special render pass. The examples use shaders to apply the ImageProcessingPass, but I would like a standard imagefilter to accomplish it.

I am not forced to use a shader am I? (I didn?t look too deeply yet, but it seems like the image processing pass receives an FBO and from that I can access the pixels using the imageimport and do what?s needed, but it looks a bit messy ? is there a simpler way?).

thanks

John,

That all sounds correct.  Option 2 might get a little dodgy because the 
IceT parallel render manager does all sorts of funny things with the 
renderer and render window buffers to handle tile displays.  There will 
also be some oddness with an actor compositing an image that gets pasted 
to a framebuffer that gets composited again.

I think Option 1 (or some variant of it) would be easier to implement even 
if it does break encapsulation.


Ken knows much more than me about the Icet compositor and tiled display 
things, so there might be issues that I am not aware of here. 
Pasting the image to a framebuffer that gets composited again should not 
be an issue (the LIC mapper does it, even though it does nothing about 
parallel composition)

If you do not want to use a shader, then you need either to use the opengl 
fixed pipeline (I do not know the correction that you need to do, but that 
might be possible), or copy the pixels back on your RAM, do the work on 
the CPU and go back to the VRAM... I fear you will get horrible 
performance that way! The shaders should be quite easy to write, the 
imageProcessingPass does most of the dirty work for you (setup the 
framebuffer, render a quad...)

Best,
Stephane

John, 
  
If you look more closely, you should see that the data is only distributed 
when transparency is on.  If everything is opaque, then everything stays 
where it is.  If I remember correctly, there is a flag in 
vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor that turns it to a pass-through filter. 
It's implemented like this because it's more convenient than changing 
around the internal pipeline.  If you never have to do ordered 
compositing, you could just remove this filter.  Likewise, you can set the 
parallel render manager to do non-ordered compositing and just forget 
about the parallel k-d tree.

Stephane,

For option 1 :
Instead of using special keys, I suspect I can just hijack the render transparent geometry pass and do my custom render in there (s my stuff is ransparent and I only want to mix with opaque stuff) ? with a pass for compositing  -- and then doing the RGB correction on process 0. Then just make sure that the non zero process Id?s don?t composite any transparent stuff back to the master image and allow process 0 to contribute the correct composited and corrected image.

I?ll explore this. thanks for the pointers to both you and Ken. These passes and delegates and wotnot are all a bit confusing when you haven?t used them much.

John,

That all sounds correct.  Option 2 might get a little dodgy because the IceT parallel render manager does all sorts of funny things with the renderer and render window buffers to handle tile displays.  There will also be some oddness with an actor compositing an image that gets pasted to a framebuffer that gets composited again.

I think Option 1 (or some variant of it) would be easier to implement even if it does break encapsulation.


Ken knows much more than me about the Icet compositor and tiled display things, so there might be issues that I am not aware of here.
Pasting the image to a framebuffer that gets composited again should not be an issue (the LIC mapper does it, even though it does nothing about parallel composition)

If you do not want to use a shader, then you need either to use the opengl fixed pipeline (I do not know the correction that you need to do, but that might be possible), or copy the pixels back on your RAM, do the work on the CPU and go back to the VRAM... I fear you will get horrible performance that way! The shaders should be quite easy to write, the imageProcessingPass does most of the dirty work for you (setup the framebuffer, render a quad...)

Best,
Stephane

RE: [Paraview] non ordered composite distributor and IceT







Stephane

I like your 2.

As a starting point to see how it all fits together, I decided to create a renderview cloned from the renderviews plugin which did the RGB correction in a special render pass. The examples use shaders to apply the ImageProcessingPass, but I would like a standard imagefilter to accomplish it.

I am not forced to use a shader am I? (I didn?t look too deeply yet, but it seems like the image processing pass receives an FBO and from that I can access the pixels using the imageimport and do what?s needed, but it looks a bit messy ? is there a simpler way?).

thanks

JB

Hi John,

I see two solutions to your pb :
1/ you can setup special keys to tell the renderpass if a given actor should be rendered or not by this pass. You can then branch your renderpasses on two paths, one that does your special compositing and post-processing on the actors that you flagged with the special key, one that does traditionnal rendering for all other actors, and you then need to compose the 2 resulting images.

2/ You could setup an internal renderpass on your mapper that uses the IceT compositing mechanism, apply your post-processing internally, then render the result of this compositing on the current framebuffer.

Option 2 should be better since your render effect seems to be actor-centric.
Best,
Stephane

Re: [Paraview] non ordered composite distributor and IceT











Ken

After looking through the sources a little more, I see that the example plugin RenderPassViews does something similar to what I?m after. It add a render pass at the end which applies an edge detection algorithm, This happens after compositing ? which is what I need.

However, this renderpass applies to all mappers/actors in the renderer/view, so if I used this strategy, then my post processing RGB correction from the mapper+compositing would happen to all actors, and this is no good.

So it looks like what I want to do won?t be possible, because there?d be no way to composite one actor individually and then blend with the others later.

Since you don?t know what it is I?m trying to do, it is probably unclear, but in short, the mapper renders the data on each process, and after all RGB images are summed in the compositing phase a correction must be applied to the RGB values (but its not commutative, so can?t be applied on each process individually). (unless I modify the algorithm which might be possible, I?ll check on this)

One approach might be to add a separate pass which renders only the special geometry, but I suspect this will be too hard because the blending phases would all need to be tweaked so that the compositing happened twice (?) ? once for the special stuff, once for everything else.

Can you tell if I?ve I understood things properly from my suppositions above, and if so, any other tips I might look into before I consider algorithmic changes.

Thanks

JB

Hi Fred, The basic way to use the superbuild is when you initially run CMake, set paraview-source/SuperBuild as your source tree instead of the root of the source tree. Note that I wrote it simply for generating release binaries so it's not as robust or as flexible as I'd like it at the moment. It builds nearly everything that ParaView needs, not allowing one to turn some of the components off.






If you need any help let me know.

Hi,

One way zooming is the following:

>> cam = GetActiveCamera()
>> cam.GetPosition().  # Returns the current camera position
>> cam.SetPosition(xpos, ypos,zpos) 
>> Render()

There are many other usefull properties for cameras. You can easily experiment in the python shell by generating the "cam" object and than use tab completion. 

An alternative way is bringing the object closer to the camera. You can do something like:
>> src = GetActiveSource()
>> props = GetDisplayProperties(src)
>> props.Position = (xpos, ypos, zpos)

Regards,

Marco

I have a Planar SA 2311W Monitor with NVidia 3D Vision Kit (shutter glasses) and NVidia Quadro 4000 GPU.
Had initial hassles getting it to work. I had to download some OLDER NVidia drivers for my NT 64bit workstation to make it all go.

Paraview is launched with:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 3.10.1\bin\paraview.exe" --stereo --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes"

I get a bad flicker from the fluorescent lighting in my office so turn that off.
As John says the menus etc appear a bit blurry, I tend to work without the glasses to set up a visualisation, then use them to view and interact.

The setup was relatively cheap, and works very well.

I have one and it works ok. My monitor is a Zalman 3D trimon something and when I use interlaced L/R mode in paraview all is well. The gui parts are a bit unreadable, but the 3D display is fine.

Sriram,

I'm guessing you are using ParaView 3.10.1 64-bit on Windows Vista or 7?
Then you are affected by the bug documented at
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12359

It may help to install the CVID codec as David suggested in a posting
earlier this year (http://markmail.org/message/ykkavu47coc6unjm). If
that does not help, short from downgrading to ParaView 3.8, you may
always fall back to saving an image file sequence and transcode that to
a movie using some encoding software as ffmpeg, mencoder, QuickTime Pro
etc. (see http://markmail.org/message/ldn5cax6b6sipv7t for an example)

Subject: [Paraview] Reading nii RGB images
Message-ID: <599C5E63-5427-4023-9A86-397F8F96CB25@mail.med.upenn.edu>

Hi all,

I have images with the datatype NIFTI_TYPE_RGB24 (128):

    bitpix = 24
    datatype = 128
    dim[0] = 3
    dim[1] = 192
    dim[2] = 256
    dim[3] = 160

However when I load an image into Paraview, the slices don't show up as RGB. I think the data is being written correctly. To verify this, I took the same binary data (the contents of the nii file minus the 352 byte header), and added a Meta header:

ObjectType = Image
NDims = 3
BinaryData = True
BinaryDataByteOrderMSB = False
CompressedData = False
TransformMatrix = 1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 1
Offset = -93 143 -72
CenterOfRotation = 0 0 0
AnatomicalOrientation = RPI
ElementSpacing = 0.976562 0.976562 1
DimSize = 192 256 160
ElementNumberOfChannels = 3
ElementType = MET_UCHAR
ElementDataFile = LOCAL

The resulting image displays correctly as RGB. Unfortunately, the geometry of the image is often confused by the conversion between nii and mha files, so it would be really helpful if I could load RGB .nii images directly. Is there a way to read RGB images in NIfTI-1 format? 

Thanks,


Phil

What, if any, third party libraries does your reader link to?

Have you tried directly comparing the data sets produced by your
reader on both platforms? I would go about that by attaching some
ascii writer inside the reader and comparing the outputs.

good luck,

Dear Paraview users

I have a question over movies. The window system (window 7) can not play 
movies that are made now with Paraview. The movies that made halve year 
ago is fine. By the way they are made by the same version of Paraview.

Does anyone else have the same problem?

Thanks!

Is that a _python_ calculator expression or a normal calculator filter
expression?

It looks like the normal calculator to me and it may well be that you
can not create two component arrays with it. Additionally, it doesn't
have a way to mark the array as the active scalars. Just assigning the
name won't do it.

I recommend using the python filter instead and then calling
point_data.SetTCoords("nameofyourarray") instead.

good luck!

For reference, the normal calculator currently doesn't allow creating 2
component arrays.  If iHat, jHat, and/or kHat are specified in the
expression it makes the resulting array a 3 component array.

Subject: [Paraview] Using field data as text source?
In-Reply-To: <4E7CB79B.9050104@lunartech.org>

Looks like you could do it by writing a plugin that contains a filter
that reads the value and populates a 1x1 vtkTable with the result. The
xml for the filter would have a hint that tells ParaView to display
the output as text.

See http://markmail.org/search/?q=paraview+text+source+utkarsh#query:paraview%20text%20source%20utkarsh+page:2+mid:7o7izbsdglwfhy4s+state:results

Please submit a feature request for this, and if enough people vote
for it I'm sure we can make it a standard feature in 4.0.

Subject: [Paraview] Update Display Decorator from server
Message-ID: <CAF2rzHLu47fuHHmpGMyzTR2nbsrUOrpc-r9876WxZOsdSLnmhg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a display decorator that deals with a custom representation in order
to modify some parts of the view. (ie: toggle on/off scalar bars). I was
wondering how to update some of these display decorator properties from the
representation? An example would be that I have a double spinbox on the
display decorator that I want to populate when the representation is
selected. Right now, I can change the values of the spinbox on the GUI and
see the result of that change, but I can't seem to update the GUI from the
representation side.

Thanks,
Brian

Subject: [Paraview] Wrong camera position in animation view panel
Message-ID: <4E821293.5060004@epfl.ch>

Hello,

I am using ParaView 3.10.1 64bit compiled on a Debian OS and I have a 
problem using the camera in the "animation view" panel. To move the 
camera I am using the "Interpolate camera locations" option, which 
should be quite simple to tune: just select a first view at the initial 
time, and another view for the final time. In particular, I am using the 
current view as the first one, while I set manually the parameters for 
the second view, using the values from the "Adjust camera" panel.

Doing so, the camera at the initial time is set correctly, but then 
moves to a wrong location. If I click on the "adjust camera" button, it 
shows me a different location with respect to the one I imposed. In 
particular, the X and Y positions seems multiplied by a factor 10, while 
the Z position is totally wrong. Similar issue with the X, Y, and Z 
focal angles.

I tried to run the same easy test both using a python script and the 
graphical interface, with the same bad result. Could you please check if 
there is any bug there, or tell me if I am doing something wrong? Thank you.

Best regards,

    Cristiano Malossi

Brian,

In general you can't. Representations don't have access to GUI
components. You'll have to put that logic in the decorator itself.

Hi,

Thanks, no third party libs, although I am using 4.7.3 of qt which I built myself... Data output is the same on both platforms.  To me it feels like a bug that in Linux get's resolved due to some weird non-standard compiler approach, and in windows does not.  For instance, the limits being correct under Linux and wrong in windows is odd, even if that's nothing to do with visualisation.  I fail to see why a min/max of the  node co-ordinates vector could be different regardless of platform, and hence I'd say something is screwed in the compilations....  In fact the process performs identically inside the reader on both platforms, it's almost as if it goes wrong once it returns back to paraview. That implies the content is somehow ok in Linux and while identical wrong for windows - hence my compiler or hidden bug type thoughts...

No ideas basically.

Cheers,
Andy

What, if any, third party libraries does your reader link to?

Have you tried directly comparing the data sets produced by your reader on both platforms? I would go about that by attaching some ascii writer inside the reader and comparing the outputs.

good luck,

I was using the last version, ie 3.1.3, so I tried with the 2.5.5 but got a compilation error:
/usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1/Utilities/VisItBridge/databases/CGNS/avtCGNSFileFormat.C:331: error: ?cgsize_t? was not declared in this scope
I do not understand because cgsize_t is defined in the version 3.1.3 but not in the version 2.5.5 of cgns!

The CGNS reader with the official 3.10.1 release can load the 5blocks test file.

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.








The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Subject: [Paraview] Fail to add mapper to paraview3.10
Message-ID: <CAEGkFz-aw-c+T9hOKQ7m9yizimyR2RiQKr3fxEgTQ6niOPZ1GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I tried to add Representation in Example\Plugins to ParaView 3.10, but
failed.

But it works in ParaView 3.8.

I found that there is no PolyDataMapper in the
Servers\ServerManager\Resources\views_and_representations.xml or
rendering.xml in ParaView 3.10, that is different with ParaView 3.8.

Is there any new introduction for how to add representation to ParaView
3.10?

How to add?

Thanks.

That looks like you are including 3.1.X as that line is a call to CGNS. A
quick grep returns no usage of cgsize in the CGNS reader.

The example included in 3.10 is broken. The example has been fixed in
git-master and will get included in 3.12. You can try out the example
by checkout out the latest paraview source

I use cgns 3.0.8 with hdf5, without any compiling errors.
Works fine

Have fun

That looks like you are including 3.1.X as that line is a call to CGNS. A quick grep returns no usage of cgsize in the CGNS reader.

I was using the last version, ie 3.1.3, so I tried with the 2.5.5 but got a compilation error:

I do not understand because cgsize_t is defined in the version 3.1.3 but not in the version 2.5.5 of cgns!

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.










The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

I just compiled it but am unable to load a CGNS file - and CGNS is not included in the list of supported file formats - so I suppose I missed something in the configuration but did not see anything related to CGNS, please tell me which option has to be toggled.

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Hello,what is the current status of CGNS file support by PV?Thanks in advance for your answer.

Hi Paul,

I'm pretty sure that this is a bug that also causes problems with
coprocessing.  I talked to Pat Marion and he said he was going to try and
fix it which should also fix your problem.

Pat, what's the status of http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12607

Thanks,
Andy

Message-ID: <4E837874.5080506@slac.stanford.edu>

Hi, Everyone.

When I print from a python macro within ParaView, sometimes the output 
of that print goes to ParaView's  Output Window, and sometimes it goes 
to ParaView's Python Shell.

Is there a way I can control which of those two windows will receive the 
output of a print?

Thanks.

Hello, list!

I just subscribed to this list, so, according to an old tradition, I 
will briefly introduce myself: I'm a geologist, 44 year-old, living in 
south-western France.  I work as a consultant, mostly for mining 
exploration, but also in all fields of geology. I worked quite a few 
years as an expatriate in a few companies; now I do missions, mostly in 
Africa.

I am a Free Software enthusiast, I discovered GNU/Linux in 1999, on a 
mining exploration camp in the middle of the Sahara, in Mauritania.  
Now, in my company, I only use GNU/Linux debian (stable and unstable) 
machines, and a FreeBSD on the file server side.  There is only one 
application, GDM (a software package from BRGM, for geology), for which 
I must still have a windows 2000 running in a box somewhere.

I used to code and develop applications, a long time ago.  I am now 
quite rusty, but I hope to be able to go back into some serious coding.  
At the moment, I mostly code python or bash scripts.

I recently discovered paraviewgeo, I managed to compile and run it on my 
debian.  I've been invited to join the present list, so here I am!


Now, I will try to do the paraview tutorial, I just downloaded
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/2/2d/ParaViewTutorial310.pdf
and
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/5/5d/ParaViewTutorialData.tar.gz

I'm sure I will soon have many questions to ask...


Best regards,
Pierre

Hi,

im building Paraview source on Mac OS OX (10.6.8 Snow Leopard *not* Lion |
gcc version 4.2.1 | CMake 2.8-2).
Leaving aside a warning triggered by my Qt 4.7 version (Officially supported
version is Qt 4.6) i have this issue:

I am working on a plugin so PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI should be enabled.
I have to manually include QT_QTUITOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR and if i
leave PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI out it builds fine.

*GUI parameters ignored for AnalyzeReader plugin because
PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI is off.*
*GUI parameters ignored for AnalyzeWriter plugin because

*GUI parameters ignored for NIfTIReader plugin because PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI
is off.*
*GUI parameters ignored for NIfTIWriter plugin because PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI
is off.*

If i enable PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI -> On) it complains
about

Subject: [Paraview] Plot over line CSV export python script not working
Message-ID: <CAAg8wy_8M7yuTZnyEHncV39R66EOE+Q3O=0V5dYC4HVkdYNAeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

I've been using Paraview for quite a long time but I didn't need the python
scripting up to now.
I want to execute a series of plot over line in numerous points and
different time steps so it is nothing
I can afford to do manually.
Looking on the net I was able to find out how to record a macro and how to
create a writer so I
ended up with this script:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

fotobioreattore_foam = GetActiveSource()
PlotOverLine2 = PlotOverLine( Source="High Resolution Line Source" )

PlotOverLine2.Source.Point1 = [-0.035100001841783524, -0.03509980067610741,
0.0]
PlotOverLine2.Source.Point2 = [0.035100001841783524, 0.035100001841783524,
0.4300000071525574]

DataRepresentation7 = Show()

PlotOverLine2.Source.Point1 = [-0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
PlotOverLine2.Source.Point2 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.4300000071525574]

XYChartView4 = GetRenderView()
DataRepresentation7.XArrayName = 'arc_length'
DataRepresentation7.SeriesVisibility = ['U (0)', '0', 'U (1)', '0', 'U (2)',
'0', 'vtkValidPointMask', '0', 'arc_length', '0', 'Points (0)', '0', 'Points
(1)', '0', 'Points (2)', '0', 'Points (Magnitude)', '0']
DataRepresentation7.UseIndexForXAxis = 0

Render()

#= create writer
source = PlotOverLine2 #PlotOverLine2.Source
writer = CreateWriter("/home/piota/csv.csv", source)
#writer = CreateWriter("/home/piota/csv.csv")
writer.FieldAssociation = "Points" # or "Cells"
writer.UpdatePipeline()
del writer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I'm not mistaken, this should write a csv.csv file in my home folder but
it doesn't write anything. No error is reported when I run the script but
still I get no output.
I'm still a bit confused on which source I should specify, so I'm pretty
sure that the writer part is incorrect.

Can somebody help me filling it out properly?

Thx in advance.

Luca

If you're running the python script in the paraview gui sometimes the
messages are printed out to the python shell.  What version of paraview are
you using?

I'm running paraview from the head of the repo.  The output I get from the
OutputMessages window is:

I'm currently doing some rendering on a large collection of exodus files
using pvpython. I would like for this rendering to be done in the
background. However, when I call WriteImage(filename), paraview pops up an
X-window, and renders to the screen while saving the image. Is there any way
to keep the window from showing up?

As far as I know, using mesa and offscreen rendering is the only way to do
that.  Information on that is available at

Another option, you can use your window manager to automatically move the
windows to a different workspace and they won't get in your way.  If you
have compiz enabled, then you can use the Place Windows plugin.  Below is a
script that I use to get those vtk windows out of my way.  The script
automates settings that you can access in compiz config settings manager
gui.

Pat


#!/bin/bash

workspace=4
match_rule="class=Paraview|class=vtk"

key="/apps/compiz/plugins/place/screen0/options"

if [ "$1" == "on" ]
then
  echo "enabling place windows"
  gconftool-2 --set "$key/viewport_matches" --type list --list-type string
"[$match_rule]"
  gconftool-2 --set "$key/viewport_x_values" --type list --list-type int
"[$workspace]"
  gconftool-2 --set "$key/viewport_y_values" --type list --list-type int

elif [ "$1" == "off" ]
then

I have no problem to compile with cgns-3.1.3 but if I load a cgns file, I got the following error:

so what is this line 409 and what is wrong here:

That looks like you are including 3.1.X as that line is a call to CGNS. A quick grep returns no usage of cgsize in the CGNS reader.

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.










The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Did you try a cgns file from cgns web site ? Can you open your cgns file with the Windows browser, from cgns web site ?
My suggestion, had a look to your file first.

I have no problem to compile with cgns-3.1.3 but if I load a cgns file, I got the following error:

ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1/Utilities/VisItBridge/AvtAlgorithms/vtkAvtSTMDFileFormatAlgorithm.cxx, line 409

vtkVisItCGNSReader (0x121793510): VisIt Exception caught.

so what is this line 409 and what is wrong here:
      this->AvtFile->GetMesh(timestep, i, name.c_str()) );

Works fine

That looks like you are including 3.1.X as that line is a call to CGNS. A quick grep returns no usage of cgsize in the CGNS reader.

I was using the last version, ie 3.1.3, so I tried with the 2.5.5 but got a compilation error:

I do not understand because cgsize_t is defined in the version 3.1.3 but not in the version 2.5.5 of cgns!

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.










The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Hi Naveen,

I would recommend you try the native linux binaries we build rather than the
Windows version through Wine. You can download them here.

Yes, I agree. The native linux version of paraview will run smoothly, 
and much faster. I played a bit with paraviewgeo, running it under wine, 
but now that I've been able to compile it natively, it works much, much, 
much faster. The "standard" paraview has always run very smoothly.


>>> recently i installed the paraview  (paraview 3.10.1 and 3.8.1 32bit) in
>>> scietific linux 5.2 using wine.
>>>        

On your distro, a command similar to:
     yum install paraview
should install set everything up for you.


I run on Debian, and I only had to do the equivalent:
     apt-get install paraview
to get it up and running.

Of course, this has to be run as root.


It is a good practice to always go through the package management system 
of your GNU/Linux system, since it takes care about all dependencies, 
libraries, etc.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 3.12.0 RC-2 available for download
Message-ID: <CAPxbyhzyonWfXxFLQmsb7+JrnZujy5pxX-sfmLWCsr2_14gJhg@mail.gmail.com>

The ParaView team is pleased to announce the availability of the ParaView
3.12.0 Release Candidate 2 binaries for download on the ParaView (
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html). ParaView 3.12 can be
considered as a bug-fix release with over 180 issues resolved. The detailed
list can be found at http://www.paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php.

With Python being one of the preferred means of interacting with ParaView,
we've added support to create animation tracks that use Python scripts to
build highly customized animations.

Plugins support is one of the strong points of ParaView and with this
release, we've made it easier to load deployed plugins on the server
processes as well. All distributed plugins are now listed on the client as
well as the server side.

The release includes updates to LANL's streaming framework.
The multiresolution streaming view now automatically adjusts resolution
to match the projected image size. Also, VTK filters are now able to modify
meta-information which means they can modify the data while still allowing
the streaming framework to cull and prioritize pieces. An example is a new
spherical warp filter that projects flat data onto the globe while correctly
tracking piece bounding boxes.

Also, there are updates to support users of the cosmology and windblade
formats. For example the MaskPoints filter (used to place glyphs and in
other places) was updated with new options that improve random sampling in
parallel. Likewise VTK's Gaussian Splatter filter is now exposed in ParaView
which makes it easy to visualize point set data with imaging filters. The
cosmo and windblade readers have also been revised.

This version includes some major changes under the covers. ParaView 3.12
includes improvements to the underpinnings of ParaView ServerManager. The
communication layer under the ParaView ServerManager was upgraded to
minimize communication as well as making it easier to debug and trace
messages being exchanged between client and server. We now use
Google Protocol Buffers, for example, to exchange messages between client
and server.

In addition, there are several small but notable improvements included in
this release for example, the views now use caching to avoid re-renders from
repaints due to menus and dialogs popup up on the screen; volume rendering
of uniform grids now supports shading; ability to enable specular highlights

Hi Andy,

The bug you reported may become related to Paul's as work progresses, but
for now it is more of an issue of the python trace being incorrect, and not
the display widgets initializing correctly from deserialized proxies.

Subject: [Paraview] SetActiveVectors with paraview.simple
Message-ID: <4E84D8BC.6060606@web.de>

Hello,

according to (the closed) bug 7387 the vtkTransformFilter is only able
(by design) to transform one "active" vector. From my point of view,
this seems to be a limitation of the virtual function
TransformPointsNormalsVectors(), as this function can only handle one
result vector and one Normal vector. In order to avoid to change the
paraview API, I'll need to SetActiveVectors() from within
paraview.simple in python, as I need to control which of my vectors need
to transform properly.

In the GUI this can be done within the Programmable Filter, for example
like this (Check copy arrays on):

activeVectorName = "fubar"

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

if output.IsA("vtkMultiBlockDataSet"):
    iter = output.NewIterator()
    iter.UnRegister(None)
    iter.InitTraversal()
    while not iter.IsDoneWithTraversal():
       
iter.GetCurrentDataObject().GetPointData().SetActiveVectors(activeVectorName)
        iter.GoToNextItem()
else:
    output.GetPointData().SetActiveVectors(activeVectorName)


Is it possible to do this directly within paraview.simple in python?

Thanks,
Oliver

I have no problem to compile with cgns-3.1.3 but if I load a cgns file, I got the following error:

ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1/Utilities/VisItBridge/AvtAlgorithms/vtkAvtSTMDFileFormatAlgorithm.cxx, line 409

so what is this line 409 and what is wrong here:

Works fine

That looks like you are including 3.1.X as that line is a call to CGNS. A quick grep returns no usage of cgsize in the CGNS reader.

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.










The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Did you try a cgns file from cgns web site ? Can you open your cgns file with the Windows browser, from cgns web site ?
My suggestion, had a look to your file first.

I have no problem to compile with cgns-3.1.3 but if I load a cgns file, I got the following error:

ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1/Utilities/VisItBridge/AvtAlgorithms/vtkAvtSTMDFileFormatAlgorithm.cxx, line 409

so what is this line 409 and what is wrong here:
      this->AvtFile->GetMesh(timestep, i, name.c_str()) );

That looks like you are including 3.1.X as that line is a call to CGNS. A quick grep returns no usage of cgsize in the CGNS reader.

Andy,

thank you for your quick reply.

I am using Paraview 3.8.0 which is the latest binary in the Ubuntu repos. I
chose to install that without compiling from source as I was rushing (I
know, it sounds weird... but). Do you believe that the problem is
build-related?

However, reading the errors that you get I don't see anything that I can
visualize in my output which is as follows (Python shell)

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "/usr/lib/paraview/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", line 2922,
in _proxyDefinitionsUpdated

if vtkSMObject.GetProxyManager().GetProxyDefinitionsUpdated():

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 17, in <module>

File "/usr/lib/paraview/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", line 201,
in __setattr__

"to add this attribute.")

AttributeError: Attribute XArrayName does not exist. This class does not
allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use
add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.


It looks like a complain about the server, not about my script though.... in
fact, if comment out the writer part, leaving only the "trace" recorded set
of operations, it spits out the very same error. Moreover, the Paraview
output doesn't show any output at all (except for the usual a complain about
the qt4 that is not related).

Do you see any evident problem in the script syntax in the writer section?
For example references to the wrong source, etc?

Or do you believe that it is a problem related to the Paraview/Python
installation (or whatever..).


Another point.... does the "PlotOverLine2" influence the results? I recorded
the trace making a second POL that automatically got labeled as #2... if I
run it at startup it executes perfectly fine so I don't think that the
problem is here too.


I'm sorry for my pretty low level in Python as I am an absolute beginner


Thanks again


Luca

Ok,

I moved on a little..... Reading the output of the error reported in the
previous mail, it says that it cannot find "XArrayName". Looking the
original script you can see that it is needed for the definition of the plot
area properties in the GUI.... I don't need it as I only want a csv file, so
I commented out everything in that section. Running the script again it now
complains about being unable to find "CreateWriter". I need this to write
the csv file so this error becomes fatal.
As this function should be included in the paraview.simple that I load at
the beginning of the script (like explained in the manual), what I did was
to go through all the functions in the simple.py file to locate it. Without
any succes..... Then I went on with the brute-force approach and lauched:

grep -H -r "CreateWriter" /usr

Binary file /usr/lib/paraview/libvtkPVFilters.so matches

Binary file /usr/lib/paraview/libvtkPVServerManager.so matches

Binary file /usr/lib/paraview/libvtkIO.so.pv3.8 matches

Binary file /usr/lib/paraview/libvtkPVServerManagerPythonD.so matches

Binary file /usr/lib/paraview/libpqApplicationComponents.so matches

Binary file /usr/lib/paraview/libvtkIO.so matches


Unfortunately they are all bin files and not py...

I'm starting to believe that I'm really missing something here.....

Any idea?


Thx!!!

Hello, Naveen,

yum, just like apt-get, gets the packages from internet, and installs 
them on your system.

> i never used yum. could you plz help me.

To get the documentation of yum, do:
     man yum

I am not too familiar with yum, so believe what the documentation says, 
rather than my advice...

Ok: this probably means that paraview is not packaged for your GNU/Linux 
distribution.

So, what you should do:
1/ get the paraview tarball from the paraview website:

     wget 
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.12/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2-Linux-i686.tar.gz

Untargz it:

     tar zxvf ParaView-3.12.0-RC2-Linux-i686.tar.gz

There should be a README file, and/or an INSTALL file: read them, obey 
to the instructions. And it should be fine.


2/ ask your distro maintainers and/or paraview developers to package 
paraview for your distro; this should not be too difficult, I guess, 
since it is already packaged for a number of distro, including debian.
In the long term, this will allow paraview to be installed and updated 
automagically on your distro.

?+
Pierre


PS: please, reply on the list, and not to the mail sender: so that 
everyone can enjoy the discussion, add points, correct misteaks, etc.

That's what Robert already answered (see below) but it seems that type cgsize_t is not defined in cgnslib-2.5 (I downloaded it from this link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns/files/cgnslib_2.5/Release%205/cgnslib_2.5-5.tar.gz/download):
Macintosh-4:cgnslib_2.5 $ find . -name "*" -exec grep cgsize_t {} \;
but is expected in PV source:
Macintosh-4:ParaView-3.10.1 $ find . -name "*.C" -exec grep cgsize_t {} \;                        if(cg_array_info(i+1, namenode, &dt, &ndims, (cgsize_t*)dims) == CG_OK)            if(cg_zone_read(GetFileHandle(), base, zone, zonename, (cgsize_t*)zsize) != CG_OK)                if(cg_array_info(i+1, namenode, &dt, &ndims, (cgsize_t*)dims) == CG_OK)    if(cg_zone_read(GetFileHandle(), base, zone, zonename, (cgsize_t*)zsize) != CG_OK)				 RealSingle, (const cgsize_t*)rmin, (const cgsize_t*)rmax, (void*)coords[c-1]) != CG_OK)				   (cgsize_t*)(&start), (cgsize_t*)(&end), &bound, &parent_flag) != CG_OK)                if(cg_ElementDataSize(GetFileHandle(), base, zone, sec, (cgsize_t*)(&eDataSize)) != CG_OK)                if(cg_elements_read(GetFileHandle(), base, zone, sec, (cgsize_t*)elements, NULL)    if(cg_zone_read(GetFileHandle(), base, zone, zonename, (cgsize_t*)zsize) != CG_OK)                               fieldname, dt, (cgsize_t*)rmin, (cgsize_t*)rmax,
so which cgns-2.5 source code did you use?or did I miss something in the cmake configuration file?

Did you try a cgns file from cgns web site ? Can you open your cgns file with the Windows browser, from cgns web site ?
My suggestion, had a look to your file first.

I have no problem to compile with cgns-3.1.3 but if I load a cgns file, I got the following error:

ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.10.1/Utilities/VisItBridge/AvtAlgorithms/vtkAvtSTMDFileFormatAlgorithm.cxx, line 409

so what is this line 409 and what is wrong here:

That looks like you are including 3.1.X as that line is a call to CGNS. A quick grep returns no usage of cgsize in the CGNS reader.

I was using the last version, ie 3.1.3, so I tried with the 2.5.5 but got a compilation error:

I do not understand because cgsize_t is defined in the version 3.1.3 but not in the version 2.5.5 of cgns!

Hi Fred,
You have two options to enable CGNS in ParaView. The easiest is to use the SuperBuild process in ParaView which will automatically enable the VisIt bridge and the CGNS reader and build CGNS itself.












The other option is to manually enable CGNS support if you already have CGNS built. You will need to enable PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE and set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Once that is done you will need to enable VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS and set the CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR and CGNS_LIBRARY

I just compiled it but am unable to load a CGNS file - and CGNS is not included in the list of supported file formats - so I suppose I missed something in the configuration but did not see anything related to CGNS, please tell me which option has to be toggled.

ParaView 3.10.1 has CGNS support. It will support structured and unstructured meshes and will only read cell and point centered properties.

Not sure what you did to your ParaView 3.10.1 source tree, but a vanilla
tree does not contain such matches:

 $ wget http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.10/ParaView-3.10.1.tar.gz
 $ md5sum ParaView-3.10.1.tar.gz
 d8a9d4a997a720589ffd57568bcdd449  ParaView-3.10.1.tar.gz
 $ tar -xzf ParaView-3.10.1.tar.gz
 $ cd ParaView-3.10.1
 $ find . -name "*.C" -exec grep cgsize_t {} \;
 [no hits]

> so which cgns-2.5 source code did you use?

ParaView-3.10.1.tar.gz:SuperBuild/PackageVersions.cmake
and
ParaView-3.10.1.tar.gz:SuperBuild/External_CGNS.cmake

will tell you it's been
http://paraview.org/files/misc/cgnslib_2.5-5.tar.gz and from its MD5
checksum ae2a2e79b99d41c63e5ed5f661f70fd9 you can see it's the same
tarball as the one distributed via
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns/files/cgnslib_2.5/Release%205/

Subject: [Paraview] Chart View Question
Message-ID: <CAF2rzHLv-ZNuOvz8JX=Hn85tD3+gh3xDS_e3xcy=WBNFa-hg=w@mail.gmail.com>

I currently have a plugin which consists of a reader that outputs a
multiblockdataset which then goes into a custom representation and is
displayed in the 3d view. I now have more data (xy stats held in a vtkTable)
being read in which would end up being viewed in a chart or xyplot. At the
moment I can see two ways of doing this:

1) Have multiple outputs for the reader (0 -> multiblockdataset, 1 ->
vtktable). My problem with this is that I would have to open the vtktable
with the spreadsheet before I can plot/graph it. I would prefer that it just
opened the plot.

2) Have 1 output with a vtktable as part of the multiblockdataset. Add
another representation to view just the vtktable. This way I can plot/graph
the vtktable and add in other data if necessary. The issue I am having with
this option is setting up the Extension and RepresentationType in the xml.
Would I need to create a custom view?

Thanks,
Brian

Hi All,

I used the codes following to get the mapper of a volume actor, but I get
NULL while *volume *is not NULL.

*  vtkAbstractMapper3D *mapper = NULL;
  if ( (volume = vtkVolume::SafeDownCast(propCandidate)) != NULL )
    mapper = volume->GetMapper();
*
Why? Thanks for any advice!

Best wishes!

I think the first problem is that there isn't an active source.  The
GetActiveSource() is returning None and when you create subsequent filters
that automatically connect to the active source it causes problems when you
try to execute the pipeline.  Something along the lines of below should get
you closer:
=========
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

Wavelet()
p = PlotOverLine()
p.Source.Point1 = [-.5, -5., -5.]
p.Source.Point2 = [.5, 5., 5.]
w = CSVWriter()
w.FileName = "/home/piota/csv.csv"
w.UpdatePipeline()
=========

The problem here is that the output of PlotOverLine is a polydata and the
writer is expecting a vtkTable.  I'm not sure how to convert between the
two.  Maybe someone else can help you with that.

The 2 things I'd try at this point are either creating my own writer using
the python programmable filter or writing out a polydata file and parsing
that for the information that you need.  The first one is probably the
better choice of the two.

Subject: [Paraview] PYTHONPATH for prebuilt MAC OSX Paraview
Message-ID: <20110930115101.5z0aavcqe8oc0sgs@cubmail.cc.columbia.edu>

Hello all,

As I understand it, to take advantage of python scripting the  
PYTHONPATH variable must be set manually. I have added:

PYTHONPATH="/Applications/ParaView  
3.10.1.app/Contents/Python/paraview:${PYTHONPATH}"
export PYTHONPATH

Which is the location of .py modules. I am not able to locate the  
module paraview however. Where would this module be located?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] memory allocation problem when saving animation
Message-ID: <CAKg37X32_WWBem+dyAaoAQrM8xP=uJ1+hwpDQc47BhnoNkCV4A@mail.gmail.com>

There was a discussion earlier this month about ParaView having memory
issues while saving animations (
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2011-September/022675.html).

The last poster indicated that the problem was solved when they used
PV 3.12.0-RC1-92-g35250ec 64-bit with geometry caching turned off.  I could
not find a link for 3.12 RC1 on the PV website, and when I downloaded and
compiled the source from the gitweb I still suffer from this issue, even
with geometry caching turned off.

How do you access the release candidate binaries?

My system is:
Ubuntu 10.10 64bit
Linux 2.6.35-30-generic #60-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 19 20:42:44 UTC 2011 x86_64
GNU/Linux
cmake 2.8.3
libvtk 5.4
libinsighttoolkit 3.20.0-novo1 (from www.paulnovo.org)

Cheers,
Seth

Never mind! Today I see 3.12 RC2 is at the top of the list.  Maybe I was
viewing a cached version of the page.

Oops. I guess someone should react, somewhere, and add such files...

In this case, I *guess* you should copy the contents of bin/ to your 
/usr/bin/, then lib/ into /usr/lib/ , and then share/ into /usr/share/

(This is not a very clean way to do things, I'd rather do yum's, 
apt-get's or aptitude's, or even make install... But faute de grives, on 
mange des merles: if someones knows how to translate this into some 
proper English...)

Then, from any console, typing para<TAB> should autocomplete to 
paraview, and this should launch paraview.

Pierre

PS: I try to do the same on my side, to check, but my bandwidth is not 
too good, so it'll take some time to download the tarball.


PPS: I replied by mistake directly to Naveen.
I have a question: would it be possible to adjust the list so that when 
one replies to a message, it replies by default to the list, instead of 
replying "privately" to the sender?
This is the default behaviour in most discussion lists, and I think it 
is much convenient: everyone can enjoy, or argue, or hate, etc. the 
discussion. If someone really wants to reply privately, it is still 
possible, but not by default.
Thanks!

This issue is not fixed for me in 3.12 RC2.  The memory increases when
exporting to still images regardless of the Geo Cache setting.
 Additionally, the memory used is not released, even after the export is
cancelled, until I close PV.

I could not find a bug related to this on Mantis.  Has anyone reported it?

Cheers
Seth

I do not recommend doing as Pierre suggests and take no responsibility if
you do. The binary is self contained. Simply run ./bin/paraview in whatever
location you extracted the tarball and it should work.

Would you be able to provide a list of the filters you are using in the
pipeline?

Actually, you're very right, I should have warned: *this can break your 
system*!
On the other hand, if you have root rights (which seems to be the case), 
then you know what you are doing.
So I do precise: this is a quick and dirty way to do things.  Something 
similar to what a proper installer would do, but without any checking or 
so, so it may damage things.

Yes, this is safer, of course, but then, you always have to recall your 
executable path; for instance, you work in some obscure directory, you 
cannot just type paraview in your shell to run it.  Which is much more 
convenient, isn't it?

Alternatively, you can put it in some /opt, which is a bit safer.

I have the tarball, at last: it is HUGE!

ls -lh ParaView-3.12.0-RC2-Linux-i686.tar.gz

116M, my telephone line got warm...

du -sh ParaView-3.12.0-RC2-Linux-i686
360M    ParaView-3.12.0-RC2-Linux-i686


I browse through the files.  Okay, I understand better, now...  Yes, 
definitely, my advice was quite bad!
I thought the tarball would just contain the executables, and a couple 
of libraries... Oops, not.

I stick to my "normal" debian installation, definitely!

By the way: in which GNU/Linux distributions is paraview packaged? 
Obviously, debian, and not scientific linux.

Hi Robert,
Thanks for getting back to me:

The pipeline is:
Load vtkUnstructuredGrid -> Clip
Load .mha(type = short, dims = 3) -> Extract Subset -> Threshold (Threshold
opacity = 0.30)

The animation changes the clip offset.

Cheers,
Seth

I had a problem recently too with memory growing when generating an animation. I turned on immediate mode rendering and it seemed better after that.

Not sure if I also did a git update around the same time, so it might not have been that.

There was a discussion earlier this month about ParaView having memory issues while saving animations (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2011-September/022675.html).

The last poster indicated that the problem was solved when they used PV 3.12.0-RC1-92-g35250ec 64-bit with geometry caching turned off.  I could not find a link for 3.12 RC1 on the PV website, and when I downloaded and compiled the source from the gitweb I still suffer from this issue, even with geometry caching turned off.

How do you access the release candidate binaries?

My system is:
Ubuntu 10.10 64bit
Linux 2.6.35-30-generic #60-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 19 20:42:44 UTC 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Greeting,

Newbie question here.

I've got a simply script that creates a Contour and prints out the Ranges of
my Arrays  and i'm trying to extract the Bounds:  X range, Y range and Z
range of the contour data listed in the Object Inspector just below the Data
Array names and Ranges.

See screenshot.


_________
Gradient1 = Contour2.PointData[0]
Heffective = Contour2.PointData[1]
Hvec = Contour2.PointData[2]

# Gradients and Hvec will 3 components... we can list the range of the
components using

print Gradient1.GetRange(0)
print Gradient1.GetRange(1)
print Gradient1.GetRange(2)

print Heffective.GetRange(0)

print Hvec.GetRange(0)
print Hvec.GetRange(1)
print Hvec.GetRange(2)

	paraview
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1Wgw+Ozb7NOh0_gePHsA+L88g_Ejr=jc_rJt_skfQg3nMw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Is it possible to read denormal-subnormal (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number ) into Paraview? For now, I am
specifying Float64 as the number type, but Paraview is complaining with the
"too small number" error when trying to read a number like 1.0e-318 (a
subnormal double number). Is there a way to tell paraview to truncate to
zero those numbers? is there any solution appart from printing the data
"normalized", i.e., rounding to zero those numbers?

Thanks in advance.

Best regards / Cordialmente,

Hi John,
I don't think a Git update would have fixed this.  I DLed and built from git
yesterday and I still had the same problem.

Although ParaView does support defining default view type in XML,
currently it's only support for filters with 1 output port. Feel free
to add a feature request to the bug tracker and we can try to address
it soon.

I don't think I understand what you're trying to do here. Can you elaborate?

Between 0.5 and 0.75 the camera position is supposed to change because I want to zoom in. So I chose different values for the position at time 0.75. After 0.75 the camera shouldn't move anymore so I set all the values for time 1 the same as time 0.75.
But when I save the animation my object seems to move to the back between time steps 0 and 0.5 and after 0.75. Does anyone have an explanation for that? I would appreciate any help!

I have attached my animation.

Thanks!
Leonie
