Odd, I cannot get to that version. Can you go to your paraview source
directory and try the following command:

> git describe

Also, you may want to update to the latest git-master and see if that
solves the problem. We don't see the same issue on any of the
dashboards with git-master.

Never mind the git-describe part, not sure why you're getting the
error though. Try running with "paraview -dr", just in case there's
something wrong with something that's being loaded automatically.

Subject: [Paraview] Read in fits-file in paraview?
Message-ID: <5069ACB5.7030702@astro.su.se>

     Hi,
Does any one know how to read-in fits-file into paraview?? I used python 
scripting for MayaVi2 to visualized my 3D data cube, but the result is 
not as good as one wants to. It looks like "paraview" can do much 
better. The problem is how read the fits-file, which is ASCII-head 
(header) and binary 3D data cube.
     Thank you for the help!

Never mind the version thing (my repo wasn't up to date). I am not
sure why you're gettin g the error though. Try running paraview with
"-dr"
> paraview -dr

Maybe some plugin is being autoloaded and that's causing the issues.

Hi, Utkarsh,

Just in case any changes in the development branch, I re-grabbed the source code and recompile/re-install the development version.

Then executed using "paraview -dr".? Got the same error.

Are you okay with using the debugger and tracking this down? I cannot
reproduce this so not sure why this is happening. If you are
comfortable using a debugger, try rebuilding with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set
to "Debug" and the attach the debugger and let's get the call stack
for the error and the segfault.

We have large clusters and some of them have graphics cards on them.  Most don't.  So normally I expect to be using -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON   -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON with cmake.  
I got to thinking.  First, if I compile with -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON then why do I have to use --use-offscreen-rendering to launch the pvservers.  Secondly, can pvservers render to graphics cards for distributed rendering under MPI?  If so, does it make sense to do -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=OFF   -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON ??

I have a source which has two output ports, one of those is a Text annotation for the data.
I can get this to be overlaid onto the view with
<Hints>
<OutputPort name="Classification" index="1" type="text" />
</Hints>
Which works fine, but how can I control the default position, size, colour, etc?

I finally got around to doing the VTK part of the WindBladeReader work.
It's on gerrit at http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/7734/. It still
needs some cleanup but at least both the serial test and the parallel test
with a single process pass. For the serial test,
vtkIOGeometryCxx-TestWindBladeReader, I'm still getting the following
warning which needs to be fixed as well:
Warning: In /home/acbauer/CODE/VTK/VTK/IO/Geometry/vtkWindBladeReader.cxx,
line 568
vtkWindBladeReader (0x1373840): WindBladeReader error reading file:
/home/acbauer/DATA/VTKLargeData/Data/WindBladeReader/test1_topo.wind
Premature EOF while reading block of data. Expected 896000 but got 0

Sohail, can you check this out and fix it?

Thanks,
Andy

Message-ID: <CAE_bc5biKfMrB_QJbxOSgviCubRethODy6RwziNyu0mwh3AfEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I was wondering if there is an example where it shows how to run paraview
in batch mode with camera motion?
I have a series of VTR files and would like to do some simple camera
motion, e.g. revolving, zooming in/out but preferably using python scripts.

Thanks,
Mohamad

It's available with "git clone git://vtk.org/VTKLargeData.git VTKLargeData".
It's in the Data/WindBladeReader subdirectory there.

Hi all 
I'm trying to compile paraview 3.14.1 (with mpi enabled) using cmake 2.8.9 and gcc 4.7.1 on arch linux x86_64. 


I first encountered this problem: 
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-June/025344.html 
And I solved it by using this fix: 
http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/vtk.git;a=commitdiff;h=428e763c995bb303805e07da70c1a34fc103d208

Hi,

I am reading the ascii vtk files (consisting of different time steps
*_nnn.vtk) and the *_000.vtk loads fine. But when I try to see next step in
Paraview 3.14 it crashes.
I have downloaded version 3.6 and it works fine there. What can that be?

Best regards,
Sergey

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview GUI suddenly won't open time series
Message-ID: <SNT138-W49CF42AE62DF3C2845D8C2D1840@phx.gbl>





Hello,
 
When I last used PV a couple of days ago, everything was fine. But today, something happened, and PV won't open time series anymore from the GUI. It works if I load a state file. But if I go to the folder that has the file series through the open dialog, the files don't show up as a series, they just show up as individual files.
 
I tried restarting, uninstalling PV & reinstalling. I also tried deleting .ini in AppData. I'm using Paraview 3.14.1 binary on Windows 7 x64. What else can I do?
 
What I was doing when this happened:
 
1. I used an external program to make some files and put them in a folder. Then I went into PV, got the open dialog, and I wanted to see if the files would group together into time series how I wanted them. It turned out they didn't because I had 2 number series in filenames, and PV ignores the first one. (My filename was something like Abc##.def.f#.vtk, and I wanted PV to pay attention just to the first ##.) Instead, PV grouped them by f#. So I needed new filenames.
 
2. I tried renaming a few files to e.g. Abc##.def.f#vtk to see if PV groups them by Abc##. They weren't grouped. I thought perhaps grouping and time series business is reserved only for known extensions.
 
3. So I renamed the files to f#.Abc##.def.vtk. Again, they didn't show up grouped. Weird.
 
4. That was when I noticed that the other (csv) files in that folder, ones that showed up as grouped previously, weren't grouped. However, I could open a pvsm file that I saved a couple days ago where those files were opened as a time series.
 
I would appreciate any ideas!

Update! It looks like PV won't group time series if the file name is Abcd##e.moretext.vtk but it will if it is Abcd##.moretext.vtk . Which is something I can work around. But it used to group Abcd##e.moretext.vtk into a series until today.

Message-ID: <CAE_bc5ba1y2XgE5tx-1kj-tRxUtdDqz73FVUJ6SwKuKekQ9TSw@mail.gmail.com>

It seems like PV has some bug dealing with .vtr reader files.
I load a .vtr series, apply any temporal filter, e.g. Temporal Cache or
Temporal Interpolator.
As soon as I move to the next time step, it crashes.
I remember I asked this before and it seemed be a bug. I was wondering if
that was fixed?

Thanks,
Mohamad

Looks like your python paths aren't set up correctly.  I would do:

- Run pvpython and do "import sys; print sys.path". You should see a bunch
of paths related to ParaView python.
- In ipython, append these paths to your sys.path.  I think ipython also
has a start up script, something like ipy_user_conf.py. If you do the
importing there, you can save your self from having to retype this every
time

You need to set the environment variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to the directory
that contains libvtkCommonPythonD.dylib.  Try entering this into your
Terminal before launching ipython:


$  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/Paraview/Contents/Libraries
$ ipython

Hi guys,

I am just doing some simple calculations on some VTR files using the
Calculator filter.
When I try to "Save Data", it appears that the input data to the calculator
is also being saved.
Is there anyway to specify which variable to be saved when Saving data?

Thanks,

Hi Rich,

You're always going to want to build with MPI when running on a cluster. 
Leveraging your cluster's graphics cards comes down to building with or 
without os mesa. you probably want to provide both builds, and select 
the build to run depending on whether the user has requested nodes that 
contain graphics cards or not. Hardware accelerated rendering can be 
faster than software based rendering depending on the amount of 
contention there is for the graphics card. eg 16 mpi ranks hitting the 
same card will likely be slower than 16 cpu cores running os mesa. When 
submitting a job you could always control this by limiting the number of 
mpi ranks per graphics card. Also, some rendering algorithms, such as 
surface LIC, are disabled when using os mesa. it's nice to have the 
hardware accelerated build in order to access the other algorithms when 
you need them.

Message-ID: <587500754.4337864.1349602552787.JavaMail.root@inria.fr>

I create an avi using mpi-PV with offscreen rendering. I note the following: 
1-If the screensaver on my Linux Fedora 17 workstation is activated during the rendering process (For example, I go away from my workstation), and I use for playback 
mplayer -sstep 1 file.avi 
shows the progress bar in the middle of the screen during the playback (very annoying). 

2-If the screensaver is NOT activated during the rendering process, 
mplayer -sstep 1 file.avi 
does NOT the progress bar in the middle of the screem during the playback. 

3- mplayer file.avi 
does not show the progress bar but is unacceptably slow! Unfortunately, the wall time to create the avi file is quite long and using offscreen rendering is desired. 

Question: Are there other faster playbacks tools other than mplayer -sstep 1 that would NOT show the progress bar? 
Hope my question is clear. 
Thanks in advance, 
Stephen

Hi Mohamad,


If you do not mind doing more steps:
1. Save your source as XML-VTK formats.
2. Re-open the XML-VTK Data.
   You may choose which variables will be activated on Properties tab,
   and you should check which you want to save.
3. Save it again.

Thanks Magician.
That trick does the job.
Now I run into another issue. Seems like the output of Calculator is always
double precision (64).
I would like to write the output as float (32). Is there anyway to do that?
I did not see any functions in CreateWriter() which does that.

Thanks,
Mohamad

You need to do both things.

1) Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
2) Set the sys.path as Leo said in the earlier email.  You can also set the
PYTHONPATH environment variable instead of appending sys.path in python.

Are you assuming we are always running in parallel on the cluster?  I find that Paraview for some reason complains when run in serial if you compile it with MPI.  So currently I'm doing four builds, opengl, osmesa, opengl-mpi, osmesa-mpi.  It's a PITA but now it's all automated.  Still I think it's confusing for our users.  

I'm also personally unsure about where there is a switch for "--use-offscreen-rendering."  If I compile with OSMesa, I'm always going to want that, right?  And if OpenGL, I'm always going to disable that, right?  Why is there a command line switch for that?  

It does sound like yes, pvservers will render to graphics cards in parallel so that's good to know.  

Thanks!

Leveraging your cluster's graphics cards comes down to building with or without os mesa. you probably want to provide both builds, and select the build to run depending on whether the user has requested nodes that contain graphics cards or not. Hardware accelerated rendering can be faster than software based rendering depending on the amount of contention there is for the graphics card. eg 16 mpi ranks hitting the same card will likely be slower than 16 cpu cores running os mesa. When submitting a job you could always control this by limiting the number of mpi ranks per graphics card. Also, some rendering algorithms, such as surface LIC, are disabled when using os mesa. it's nice to have the hardware accelerated build in order to access the other algorithms when you need them.

I think that depending on how you built OSMesa it's all you _can_ do.

You can render "off screen" with X and graphics hardware but without the
render window actually showing up on screen.

Hi Rich,

if you are installing on cluster, I would say that it's easier to use an 
MPI build. Of course when you build with MPI support you need to launch 
pvserver with mpirun (or the system equivalent). When you need a serial 
run just specify -n 1. You may be aware that, providing a server config 
will let your users select the number of mpi ranks and the "layout" of 
mpi ranks across cluster nodes from ParaView's GUI. ParaView should run 
on any number of mpi ranks. When you say you're running in serial, are 
you using the mpirun command? what errors/complaints are you experiencing?

My recollection, is that the --use-offscreen-rendering is used to select 
between osmesa open gl and the system open gl when both are used in the 
same build. I haven't built ParaView this way in many years, hence my 
recollection is fuzzy. On the other hand, if you have two builds, one 
built with osmesa and the other using a system provided hardware 
accelerated open gl, this command line flag is not necessary.

Subject: [Paraview] Save state doesn't save widget layout
Message-ID: <CABDpjTma10u5KZ46EJPf9sB3AqetnPfXhbXJssRb5izjuva0vQ@mail.gmail.com>

I often adjust the data panel to be a reasonably square aspect ratio
before producing screenshots of my data. Consider a data set with 2
different arrays that can be used to color the data. If I setup the
window and set the zoom of the data to how I want it and take a
screenshot with the data colored by Array1, is there a way to really
save the state of everything so that I can open it later, change to
color the data by Array2, and produce another screenshot with the
points in exactly the same positions? Currently the "save state" seems
to just re-open the files I had open, but not put the panels back to
how I had adjusted them.

The result of this is that if I have multiple screenshots of different
things and at a later date I want to change one of them, I have to
reproduce all of them so that they are from the same viewpoint/zoom as
the new one.

This doesn't seem like it would be that uncommon of a thing to want to
do - can anyone share how they handle this? Or is there a "File->Save
layout" or similar somewhere that I am missing?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <CAE_bc5YDKVVV2pk78beZMUGZD5kQkzrO4C_1cFGMv5D8AjVBEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering if there is a filter which converts a nonuniform
Rectilinear Data (3D) to a Uniform Rectilinear format (or Image Data).
The reason I need this is that it seems that Volume rendering can only be
done for either Unstructured grid data or Image data. So, I need to
transform my dataset before doing that.

I know you can use "Resample With Dataset" filter to map my data to a plane
with uniform spacing. But I cannot do the same for a Box (in 3D) with my
given resolution.
Alternatively, it seems that the "Data Object Generator" filter should be
able to create an Image Data-based grid, but I am not sure how to set the
resolution and/or the grid information when calling this filter.
Any help is appreciated.

Best,
Mohamad

I just figured it out. Just created a simple *.vti file and resampled my
original data using that.
But it would be nice if we could pass parameters to Data Object Generator.

XDMF seems to have proper tags that I'd like to use but I can't at the

Subject: [Paraview] Gaussian splatter filter
Message-ID: <SNT138-W181EAB02233BE870BE610DD18F0@phx.gbl>



Hello,

I have point coordinates of a bunch of atoms and I'm trying to visualize the pore space - i.e., the volume that's a certain distance away from the point coordinates. As suggested here, I've been using Gaussian splatter, then isovolume, and choosing thresholds for isovolume by eye to find those that match the sizes of point sprites. (When I set point sprites as spheres, the radius is in the same units as xyz coordinates, so I know what a point sprite sphere of a given size means physically.) But now, I need to stop eyeballing it and to find the splatter values that correspond to the radii that I'm interested in.

The unscaled output of Gaussian splatter is from 0 (empty space) to 1 (point coordinate). I thought I could figure out the upper threshold by plugging e.g. .5, my desired radius, into the Gaussian distribution function:

f(x) = ScaleFactor * exp( ExponentFactor*((.5/Radius)^2) ) 

But, with default exp factor (-5) and radius (.1) that I'm using, that gives 5E-55, when the value that looks right in PV is around .9. I don't know how splat accumulation mode is factored into the calculation, but I turned off elliptical splats to make it simpler. I'd appreciate any help.

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver with mpirun does not start waiting for clients
Message-ID: <002201cda5e8$18ed6820$4ac83860$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hi, I have a problem to start the pvserver in mpi-mode with the current git
master version of PV. The mpi-processes were spawn but in the console window
is nothing happens. No output which indicates, that pvserver is waiting for
clients. Can anybody confirm this behavior? I've tested this on two
different systems (Windows 7 and 8 either in 64 Bit).

Cheers,
Stephan

Hello Seb,

   Found it and it works almost perfectly. I can export to webGL, see the
geometry, the colorbar, even the surface with edges if I want to.
Unfortunately I've still not figure out how to export scalars on the
geometry properly; it shows properly in Paraview, I export it, then in
webgl it is shown in a single colour.
Any ideas of what I'm doing wrong?

Regards,
Nico.

Hi Nico,

could you send me the generated HTML/WebGL file as well as a screen
capture of ParaView to see what you expect and what you end up in your
browser. For the screencapture, I need to see the ParaView GUI, so I
can see what are your settings...

Thanks,

Seb

Hello everyone,

I just built and installed Paraview on our cluster ( from git with mpi
enabled without mesa- don't worry we have hardware for graphics ) but
upon running it I get the following error

/home/ghajar_jazi/ParaView-ex/lib/paraview-3.14/paraview: symbol
lookup error: /home/ghajar_jazi/ParaView-ex/lib/paraview-3.14/libvtkGUISupportQt-pv3.14.so.1:
undefined symbol:

Does anyone have any input on this ?

Here's one guess, it could be some mismatched library versions of Qt.  Run
ldd /home/ghajar_jazi/ParaView-ex/lib/paraview-3.14/paraview  to see the
list of dynamic library dependencies for paraview.  Take a look at the Qt
libraries listed.  Are they the ones you expect?  It's possible that you
need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the location of the Qt
libraries that you used for building paraview.  If that doesn't work, you
could post the output of the ldd command and we can guess again.

Ya that is exactly what I did, does the python version has to be the same to the one with paraview ?

Subject: [Paraview] Is there any point to compiling with MPI but without

Hi Rich,

I totally agreee with you, I find it very confusing that there is a compile
time flag VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN, and a runtime flag --use-offscreen-rendering,
and an OSMesa compile flag VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA.  I think that the options
could be presented in a way that makes it more clear what is happening.

I want to clarify some things here.  There are actually several very
different concepts that are all kinda mixed up by the way that VTK presents
the options:

1) hardware accelerated rendering vs. software rendering
2) regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering vs. OSMesa rendering

Just saying "offscreen rendering" is totally not specific enough to have
any idea what is really happening under the hood, a lot of people assume
different things when they hear "offscreen rendering", and I think that's
where the problem is.

First, hardware vs. software rendering.  If you use the Mesa OpenGL driver
(not to be confused with the OSMesa library!), you are using software
rendering.  But, the mesa driver renders into a buffer that is owned by the
operating system and window manager (X11).  So you are using a software
implementation of OpenGL, but rendering "on screen", and you depend on X11
APIs and an X server.  If you have a GPU, then you can use a hardware
driver, and similarly you depend on X11.  You can switch between a hardware
driver and a Mesa driver without recompiling any software.

Second, regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering.  Here is an old, but
very informative, article on the many different implementations of
offscreen rendering:   http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/sig97/offscrn.htm
Note that Mesa offscreen rendering, OSMesa, is just one of many different
offscreen rendering APIs described in the article.  You can do hardware
accelerated offscreen rendering, and that is totally different from
OSMesa.  For example, using X11, you can render into a GLX pixmap.  A GLX
pixmap is a render buffer that is not associated with a window, it is
"offscreen", but the rendering uses your GL driver, which could be a
hardware accelerated driver or a Mesa software driver, but not OSMesa.

Finally, there is OSMesa.  It uses Mesa software rendering, and renders
into a special OSMesa buffer.  Using OSMesa, you have zero dependency on
X11.  You don't need X11 at build time or at run time.  Here's more
information about OSMesa: http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html

So, in summary,

-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do on screen rendering into an
X11 window.
-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do offscreen rendering into an
X11 managed offscreen buffer.
-you can use OSMesa for software rendering without any dependency on X11.

For MPI cluster runs of paraview, the two most common configurations are
GPU with X11, or OSMesa without X11.  If you didn't have a GPU on your
nodes, you might also use Mesa with X11, but render on screen.

If you grep VTK source code for "OSMESA", you will find multiple confusing
flags, VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA and VTK_USE_OSMESA, and lots of confusing code
to decide whether or not we want to use on screen or offscreen rendering
with gpu, or OSMesa rendering.  If VTK is truly compiled for OSMesa, it
means that ldd pvserver lists only OSMesa and no X11 or OpenGL
dependencies.  When you have compiled with OSMesa, the
--use-offscreen-rendering flag can be completely ignored, VTK will always
use OSMesa.

I think the --use-offscreen-rendering flag is mostly for switching between
on screen and offscreen while still using a regular GL driver, and I'm
really not sure if anybody actually uses that feature, I certainly have
not.  To make things even more confusing, in ParaView there is a
preferences setting for "Use offscreen rendering for screenshots".  Ouch.


Hope this helps!

Pat

p.s. If anybody has corrections, please let me know!

Great summary.

Did writing that give you any ideas on the best way to simplify the options and #ifdefs.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Is there any point to compiling with MPI but without offscreen rendering?

Hi Rich,

I totally agreee with you, I find it very confusing that there is a compile time flag VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN, and a runtime flag --use-offscreen-rendering, and an OSMesa compile flag VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA.  I think that the options could be presented in a way that makes it more clear what is happening.

I want to clarify some things here.  There are actually several very different concepts that are all kinda mixed up by the way that VTK presents the options:

1) hardware accelerated rendering vs. software rendering
2) regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering vs. OSMesa rendering

Just saying "offscreen rendering" is totally not specific enough to have any idea what is really happening under the hood, a lot of people assume different things when they hear "offscreen rendering", and I think that's where the problem is.

First, hardware vs. software rendering.  If you use the Mesa OpenGL driver (not to be confused with the OSMesa library!), you are using software rendering.  But, the mesa driver renders into a buffer that is owned by the operating system and window manager (X11).  So you are using a software implementation of OpenGL, but rendering "on screen", and you depend on X11 APIs and an X server.  If you have a GPU, then you can use a hardware driver, and similarly you depend on X11.  You can switch between a hardware driver and a Mesa driver without recompiling any software.

Second, regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering.  Here is an old, but very informative, article on the many different implementations of offscreen rendering:   http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/sig97/offscrn.htm
Note that Mesa offscreen rendering, OSMesa, is just one of many different offscreen rendering APIs described in the article.  You can do hardware accelerated offscreen rendering, and that is totally different from OSMesa.  For example, using X11, you can render into a GLX pixmap.  A GLX pixmap is a render buffer that is not associated with a window, it is "offscreen", but the rendering uses your GL driver, which could be a hardware accelerated driver or a Mesa software driver, but not OSMesa.

Finally, there is OSMesa.  It uses Mesa software rendering, and renders into a special OSMesa buffer.  Using OSMesa, you have zero dependency on X11.  You don't need X11 at build time or at run time.  Here's more information about OSMesa: http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html

So, in summary,

-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do on screen rendering into an X11 window.
-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do offscreen rendering into an X11 managed offscreen buffer.
-you can use OSMesa for software rendering without any dependency on X11.

For MPI cluster runs of paraview, the two most common configurations are GPU with X11, or OSMesa without X11.  If you didn't have a GPU on your nodes, you might also use Mesa with X11, but render on screen.

If you grep VTK source code for "OSMESA", you will find multiple confusing flags, VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA and VTK_USE_OSMESA, and lots of confusing code to decide whether or not we want to use on screen or offscreen rendering with gpu, or OSMesa rendering.  If VTK is truly compiled for OSMesa, it means that ldd pvserver lists only OSMesa and no X11 or OpenGL dependencies.  When you have compiled with OSMesa, the --use-offscreen-rendering flag can be completely ignored, VTK will always use OSMesa.

I think the --use-offscreen-rendering flag is mostly for switching between on screen and offscreen while still using a regular GL driver, and I'm really not sure if anybody actually uses that feature, I certainly have not.  To make things even more confusing, in ParaView there is a preferences setting for "Use offscreen rendering for screenshots".  Ouch.


Hope this helps!

Pat

Hi Rich,

if you are installing on cluster, I would say that it's easier to use an MPI build. Of course when you build with MPI support you need to launch pvserver with mpirun (or the system equivalent). When you need a serial run just specify -n 1. You may be aware that, providing a server config will let your users select the number of mpi ranks and the "layout" of mpi ranks across cluster nodes from ParaView's GUI. ParaView should run on any number of mpi ranks. When you say you're running in serial, are you using the mpirun command? what errors/complaints are you experiencing?

My recollection, is that the --use-offscreen-rendering is used to select between osmesa open gl and the system open gl when both are used in the same build. I haven't built ParaView this way in many years, hence my recollection is fuzzy. On the other hand, if you have two builds, one built with osmesa and the other using a system provided hardware accelerated open gl, this command line flag is not necessary.

I'm also personally unsure about where there is a switch for "--use-offscreen-rendering."  If I compile with OSMesa, I'm always going to want that, right?  And if OpenGL, I'm always going to disable that, right?  Why is there a command line switch for that?

It does sound like yes, pvservers will render to graphics cards in parallel so that's good to know.

Thanks!

Leveraging your cluster's graphics cards comes down to building with or without os mesa. you probably want to provide both builds, and select the build to run depending on whether the user has requested nodes that contain graphics cards or not. Hardware accelerated rendering can be faster than software based rendering depending on the amount of contention there is for the graphics card. eg 16 mpi ranks hitting the same card will likely be slower than 16 cpu cores running os mesa. When submitting a job you could always control this by limiting the number of mpi ranks per graphics card. Also, some rendering algorithms, such as surface LIC, are disabled when using os mesa. it's nice to have the hardware accelerated build in order to access the other algorithms when you need them.

Very interesting.  Brian Paul is everywhere!  :-)
I have a question, however.  You say that one can use Mesa X11 rendering (as opposed to OSMesa rendering).  How would that be done?  The only mesa rendering I'm aware of is OSMesa.  What is this "Mesa OpenGL driver" which renders in software but is not OSMesa?
Thanks

As a user, I would prefer a single compile which links against OSMesa AND OpenGL AND MPI if they are available, but uses whatever the user chooses at runtime.  This requires code logic to handle, with #ifdefs to handle the case where some feature is not available at compile time, and additional if/then statements in C to handle the user choice, but seems doable and would vastly simplify compilation, installation and usage.
Thanks

Great summary.

Did writing that give you any ideas on the best way to simplify the options and #ifdefs.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Is there any point to compiling with MPI but without offscreen rendering?

Hi Rich,

I totally agreee with you, I find it very confusing that there is a compile time flag VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN, and a runtime flag --use-offscreen-rendering, and an OSMesa compile flag VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA.  I think that the options could be presented in a way that makes it more clear what is happening.

I want to clarify some things here.  There are actually several very different concepts that are all kinda mixed up by the way that VTK presents the options:

1) hardware accelerated rendering vs. software rendering
2) regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering vs. OSMesa rendering

Just saying "offscreen rendering" is totally not specific enough to have any idea what is really happening under the hood, a lot of people assume different things when they hear "offscreen rendering", and I think that's where the problem is.

First, hardware vs. software rendering.  If you use the Mesa OpenGL driver (not to be confused with the OSMesa library!), you are using software rendering.  But, the mesa driver renders into a buffer that is owned by the operating system and window manager (X11).  So you are using a software implementation of OpenGL, but rendering "on screen", and you depend on X11 APIs and an X server.  If you have a GPU, then you can use a hardware driver, and similarly you depend on X11.  You can switch between a hardware driver and a Mesa driver without recompiling any software.

Second, regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering.  Here is an old, but very informative, article on the many different implementations of offscreen rendering:  http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/sig97/offscrn.htm
Note that Mesa offscreen rendering, OSMesa, is just one of many different offscreen rendering APIs described in the article.  You can do hardware accelerated offscreen rendering, and that is totally different from OSMesa.  For example, using X11, you can render into a GLX pixmap.  A GLX pixmap is a render buffer that is not associated with a window, it is "offscreen", but the rendering uses your GL driver, which could be a hardware accelerated driver or a Mesa software driver, but not OSMesa.

Finally, there is OSMesa.  It uses Mesa software rendering, and renders into a special OSMesa buffer.  Using OSMesa, you have zero dependency on X11.  You don't need X11 at build time or at run time.  Here's more information about OSMesa: http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html

So, in summary,

-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do on screen rendering into an X11 window.
-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do offscreen rendering into an X11 managed offscreen buffer.
-you can use OSMesa for software rendering without any dependency on X11.

For MPI cluster runs of paraview, the two most common configurations are GPU with X11, or OSMesa without X11.  If you didn't have a GPU on your nodes, you might also use Mesa with X11, but render on screen.

If you grep VTK source code for "OSMESA", you will find multiple confusing flags, VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA and VTK_USE_OSMESA, and lots of confusing code to decide whether or not we want to use on screen or offscreen rendering with gpu, or OSMesa rendering.  If VTK is truly compiled for OSMesa, it means that ldd pvserver lists only OSMesa and no X11 or OpenGL dependencies.  When you have compiled with OSMesa, the --use-offscreen-rendering flag can be completely ignored, VTK will always use OSMesa.

I think the --use-offscreen-rendering flag is mostly for switching between on screen and offscreen while still using a regular GL driver, and I'm really not sure if anybody actually uses that feature, I certainly have not.  To make things even more confusing, in ParaView there is a preferences setting for "Use offscreen rendering for screenshots".  Ouch.


Hope this helps!

Pat

Hi Rich,

if you are installing on cluster, I would say that it's easier to use an MPI build. Of course when you build with MPI support you need to launch pvserver with mpirun (or the system equivalent). When you need a serial run just specify -n 1. You may be aware that, providing a server config will let your users select the number of mpi ranks and the "layout" of mpi ranks across cluster nodes from ParaView's GUI. ParaView should run on any number of mpi ranks. When you say you're running in serial, are you using the mpirun command? what errors/complaints are you experiencing?

My recollection, is that the --use-offscreen-rendering is used to select between osmesa open gl and the system open gl when both are used in the same build. I haven't built ParaView this way in many years, hence my recollection is fuzzy. On the other hand, if you have two builds, one built with osmesa and the other using a system provided hardware accelerated open gl, this command line flag is not necessary.

Are you assuming we are always running in parallel on the cluster?  I find that Paraview for some reason complains when run in serial if you compile it with MPI.  So currently I'm doing four builds, opengl, osmesa, opengl-mpi, osmesa-mpi.  It's a PITA but now it's all automated.  Still I think it's confusing for our users.

I'm also personally unsure about where there is a switch for "--use-offscreen-rendering."  If I compile with OSMesa, I'm always going to want that, right?  And if OpenGL, I'm always going to disable that, right?  Why is there a command line switch for that?

It does sound like yes, pvservers will render to graphics cards in parallel so that's good to know.

Thanks!

Hi Rich,

You're always going to want to build with MPI when running on a cluster. Leveraging your cluster's graphics cards comes down to building with or without os mesa. you probably want to provide both builds, and select the build to run depending on whether the user has requested nodes that contain graphics cards or not. Hardware accelerated rendering can be faster than software based rendering depending on the amount of contention there is for the graphics card. eg 16 mpi ranks hitting the same card will likely be slower than 16 cpu cores running os mesa. When submitting a job you could always control this by limiting the number of mpi ranks per graphics card. Also, some rendering algorithms, such as surface LIC, are disabled when using os mesa. it's nice to have the hardware accelerated build in order to access the other algorithms when you need them.

We have large clusters and some of them have graphics cards on them.  Most don't.  So normally I expect to be using -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON   -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON with cmake.
I got to thinking.  First, if I compile with -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON then why do I have to use --use-offscreen-rendering to launch the pvservers.  Secondly, can pvservers render to graphics cards for distributed rendering under MPI?  If so, does it make sense to do -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=OFF   -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON ??

Hi,

when displaying the glyphs of a vector field that is defined in the
points mesh, everything looks fine.
However, if the vector field is *cell*-based, what's the correct way
to produce the glyphs here?
I put a minimalistic example with the field (1,1,1) defined in both
points and cells at http://win.ua.ac.be/~nschloe/other/glyphs.vtu.

What kind of grid do you have? For some grids (maybe vtkImageData or maybe
all structured VTK grid types, I can't remember) there is the Compute
Scalars option which you'll want to enable the passing of the isosurfaced
variable values. For the next release of ParaView as well as the current
main repo version you can turn on the Compute Scalars option for all grid
types. Is this what you were looking for?

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver dies after client closes. How to prevent that?
Message-ID: <CAO73BAA-BVqNgwi=iyzgY4D_-McbMb50h_ngsSrkh81Jr_ysbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using paraview 3.14 in the client/server mode (server running in
serial mode on linux, client on a windows 7).

After I close the client on my desktop, the server process dies, and I
have to log it to the server machine to restart the server.

- Is that the expected behavior?
- How can I set up the server, so that it is always available for listening.

Actually, as our simulations are relatively small, and I work with a
few colleagues, I would like to set-up a few servers, so that every
person can have one instance.

Thanks,

Mirko

I think you have chosen the Manual mode. You have to connect to the server with the command mode. So you can enter the command on how to connect to the server and start a new session. In this way each time a client wants to start a new session a new process will be spawned on the server. The following link may help you come over with it:  
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Establishing_Connections

If you are running a cluster and you want to make a comfortable environment for your clients, you might create a .pvsc file format to automate this process.

Hi all,

I want to use pvpython from the Windows command line. It works well
but in the version I use the parameter -script is not available.
Should I try the 64 bit version?

I use the binary installer ParaView-3.14.1-Win32-x86.exe.

can't you just provide the script path as unique argument ?

Hi Sebastien,

ok so simple ;) Thank you. Now I only need to find out how to handle
relative paths in state files. But from the forum I read that this
feature is still not available for 3.14.

Yes that is the expected behavior. We use a pure client server
approach in which the server only ever does what the client tells it
to. The only exception to that is when you save an animation there is
an option on the save animation dialog that tells the server to keep
going until it writes the last frame of the movie.

Since 3.14 pvserver's --multi-clients mode _could_ allow this, but
even that shuts down when it finds that there are no clients
connected. You might then add a flag that changes that behavior but
you would also have to provide a mechanism where you tell the server
to shutdown manually.

Subject: [Paraview]  Inconsistent results with the stream trace filter
Message-ID: <CAFFYk1XNe7nVk_FbVDgqwLFT3TTDL17snZhTxXZ-ted87MdiNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I've got an odd issue with the stream trace and stream trace custom source
filters in Paraview (3.14.1 64bit).  No matter what settings I use, the
traces die off very soon and some even carry on straight (even when there's
no fluid).

See the two screenshots I've got from Paraview.

http://jdborg.com/images/paraview/pv_inlet.png
http://jdborg.com/images/paraview/pv_outlet.png


Not sure if this is a setting that's easy to miss or if it's more terminal.

Thanks,


Regards,
Joseph David Bor?

Not sure.  I think there is some wiggle room on the python versions, but
your environment might be more strict.

Hi Rich,

I think the Mesa driver is installed by default on most linux distos today
(maybe not?), but the proprietary hardware drivers take priority when
installed and enabled.  You can configure X11 (or uninstall your nvidia
driver or whatever you may have), so that the mesa driver will kick in.  If
you run "glxinfo | grep vendor" then you'll either see the name of your
enabled proprietary driver vendor, or you'll see Mesa.  This is a system
configuration thing, which driver is being used does not affect ParaView,
it's invisible to ParaView (except ParaView might query for  and use vendor
specific extensions that are only available in the proprietary driver).

On ubuntu there are two packages: libgl1-mesa-swx11 and libgl1-mesa-glx.  I
think that the mesa-swx11 is used more infrequently, it is a pure software
implementation while the mesa-glx packages actually uses hardware
acceleration for it's drawing-
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure

OSMesa is different because it has a specific API that you have to code to
and link your program to the OSMesa library.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView build options for OSMesa, offscreen rendering
Message-ID: <CAMetC=Tc+CLa1Rn5xmOs-5NMbF=UfDoz64-FOBz9Axhj1JR1Mw@mail.gmail.com>

I decided to start a new thread.  The original subject was "[Paraview] Is
there any point to compiling with MPI but without offscreen rendering?" and
John Biddiscombe asked if I had thoughts on improvements to the cmake
options for compiling VTK and ParaView with OSMesa.

For me, I pretty much just have two use cases, 1) vanilla ParaView, or 2)
ParaView configured with OSMesa and without X11.  I'm not sure that I've
ever worried about the VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN option or the pvserver flag
--use-offscreen-rendering.  But maybe these options are required to satisfy
other use cases?  I'm not sure.

My avi files have many time steps.

mplayer -sstep 1 file.avi

speeds up the playback but has a progress bar in the middle of the

Can anyone recommend a rapid linux playback method that has no progress bar?

Thanks in advance,

That makes perfect sense, thanks for that explanation.
So in fact, software mesa rendering is not something you do with Paraview either at compile or runtime.  Paraview just uses OpenGL and the implementation is hardware or software.
I had thought OSMesa was simply an OpenGL implementation.  Thanks for clarifying that it is somewhat different, which tells me why there would be a special flag for it.  OSMesa does seem to implement OpenGL, though, because I have successfully switched between hardware and software rendering with other applications that need OpenGL simply by pointing at OSMesa with LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This has fixed situations where GLX breaks things.

Hi Rich,

I think the Mesa driver is installed by default on most linux distos today (maybe not?), but the proprietary hardware drivers take priority when installed and enabled.  You can configure X11 (or uninstall your nvidia driver or whatever you may have), so that the mesa driver will kick in.  If you run "glxinfo | grep vendor" then you'll either see the name of your enabled proprietary driver vendor, or you'll see Mesa.  This is a system configuration thing, which driver is being used does not affect ParaView, it's invisible to ParaView (except ParaView might query for  and use vendor specific extensions that are only available in the proprietary driver).

On ubuntu there are two packages: libgl1-mesa-swx11 and libgl1-mesa-glx.  I think that the mesa-swx11 is used more infrequently, it is a pure software implementation while the mesa-glx packages actually uses hardware acceleration for it's drawing- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure

OSMesa is different because it has a specific API that you have to code to and link your program to the OSMesa library.

I have a question, however.  You say that one can use Mesa X11 rendering (as opposed to OSMesa rendering).  How would that be done?  The only mesa rendering I'm aware of is OSMesa.  What is this "Mesa OpenGL driver" which renders in software but is not OSMesa?
Thanks

Hi Rich,

I totally agreee with you, I find it very confusing that there is a compile time flag VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN, and a runtime flag --use-offscreen-rendering, and an OSMesa compile flag VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA.  I think that the options could be presented in a way that makes it more clear what is happening.

I want to clarify some things here.  There are actually several very different concepts that are all kinda mixed up by the way that VTK presents the options:

1) hardware accelerated rendering vs. software rendering
2) regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering vs. OSMesa rendering

Just saying "offscreen rendering" is totally not specific enough to have any idea what is really happening under the hood, a lot of people assume different things when they hear "offscreen rendering", and I think that's where the problem is.

First, hardware vs. software rendering.  If you use the Mesa OpenGL driver (not to be confused with the OSMesa library!), you are using software rendering.  But, the mesa driver renders into a buffer that is owned by the operating system and window manager (X11).  So you are using a software implementation of OpenGL, but rendering "on screen", and you depend on X11 APIs and an X server.  If you have a GPU, then you can use a hardware driver, and similarly you depend on X11.  You can switch between a hardware driver and a Mesa driver without recompiling any software.

Second, regular rendering vs. offscreen rendering.  Here is an old, but very informative, article on the many different implementations of offscreen rendering:   http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/sig97/offscrn.htm
Note that Mesa offscreen rendering, OSMesa, is just one of many different offscreen rendering APIs described in the article.  You can do hardware accelerated offscreen rendering, and that is totally different from OSMesa.  For example, using X11, you can render into a GLX pixmap.  A GLX pixmap is a render buffer that is not associated with a window, it is "offscreen", but the rendering uses your GL driver, which could be a hardware accelerated driver or a Mesa software driver, but not OSMesa.

Finally, there is OSMesa.  It uses Mesa software rendering, and renders into a special OSMesa buffer.  Using OSMesa, you have zero dependency on X11.  You don't need X11 at build time or at run time.  Here's more information about OSMesa: http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html

So, in summary,

-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do on screen rendering into an X11 window.
-you can use a GPU or Mesa (not OSMesa) and do offscreen rendering into an X11 managed offscreen buffer.
-you can use OSMesa for software rendering without any dependency on X11.

For MPI cluster runs of paraview, the two most common configurations are GPU with X11, or OSMesa without X11.  If you didn't have a GPU on your nodes, you might also use Mesa with X11, but render on screen.

If you grep VTK source code for "OSMESA", you will find multiple confusing flags, VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA and VTK_USE_OSMESA, and lots of confusing code to decide whether or not we want to use on screen or offscreen rendering with gpu, or OSMesa rendering.  If VTK is truly compiled for OSMesa, it means that ldd pvserver lists only OSMesa and no X11 or OpenGL dependencies.  When you have compiled with OSMesa, the --use-offscreen-rendering flag can be completely ignored, VTK will always use OSMesa.

I think the --use-offscreen-rendering flag is mostly for switching between on screen and offscreen while still using a regular GL driver, and I'm really not sure if anybody actually uses that feature, I certainly have not.  To make things even more confusing, in ParaView there is a preferences setting for "Use offscreen rendering for screenshots".  Ouch.


Hope this helps!

Pat

p.s. If anybody has corrections, please let me know!

Hi Rich,

if you are installing on cluster, I would say that it's easier to use an MPI build. Of course when you build with MPI support you need to launch pvserver with mpirun (or the system equivalent). When you need a serial run just specify -n 1. You may be aware that, providing a server config will let your users select the number of mpi ranks and the "layout" of mpi ranks across cluster nodes from ParaView's GUI. ParaView should run on any number of mpi ranks. When you say you're running in serial, are you using the mpirun command? what errors/complaints are you experiencing?

My recollection, is that the --use-offscreen-rendering is used to select between osmesa open gl and the system open gl when both are used in the same build. I haven't built ParaView this way in many years, hence my recollection is fuzzy. On the other hand, if you have two builds, one built with osmesa and the other using a system provided hardware accelerated open gl, this command line flag is not necessary.

It does sound like yes, pvservers will render to graphics cards in parallel so that's good to know.

Leveraging your cluster's graphics cards comes down to building with or without os mesa. you probably want to provide both builds, and select the build to run depending on whether the user has requested nodes that contain graphics cards or not. Hardware accelerated rendering can be faster than software based rendering depending on the amount of contention there is for the graphics card. eg 16 mpi ranks hitting the same card will likely be slower than 16 cpu cores running os mesa. When submitting a job you could always control this by limiting the number of mpi ranks per graphics card. Also, some rendering algorithms, such as surface LIC, are disabled when using os mesa. it's nice to have the hardware accelerated build in order to access the other algorithms when you need them.

Hi,

I am trying to build ParaView on my MacBook and I am getting a list of 
undefined symbols.  Below is the first of about 35+ similar errors.  For 
info all of the required supporting packages were installed by Macports. 
   I downloaded ParaView-3.14.1-Source from the website and created a 
separate build directory. I received a that I was running Qt 4.8.3 
whereas the officially supported version is Qt 4.6.

In case it is related, I had an earlier problem where during compiling 
the generated makefile was expecting some Qt file under files in 
/opt/local/lib/Resources/... whereas they were in 
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/Resources/... I 
resolved this by creating a symbolic link in /opt/local/lib

Not sure where to start to solve the problem. Any help appreciated.

Regards,

It looks the compiler included system HDF5 headers even though
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 is disabled.  Then, at link time it doesn't link the
system HDF5 libraries because VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 if off.  You could try
running cmake in the build dir and setting VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 to OFF.

I think this might be caused by a tricky a bug in VTK's cmake scripts.  I
guess CMake would need to add -IVTK/Utilities/vtkhdf5 before
-I/opt/local/include when system hdf5 is off.

Do you have HDF5 built for x86_64? The error is indicating that maybe your HDF5 is built for 32 bit intel or another arch (ppc). Are you trying to build a universal (32 bit/ 64 bit) ParaView? HDF5 will pretty much stop this from happening. Just my thoughts

Oops, I meant to say you should set VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 to ON.

HDF5 was installed via Macports.  I will try to find out what variant 
was installed.    I did try the following -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=386  
and got the following error:

Thanks to both for your quick response.

 From a clean/new build directory I tried your suggestion of 
-DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5=ON   I received a different error (fragment 
below), which looks like it not finding some HDF5 headers.

I will keep investigating.  Obviously something strange about my setup 
or use of Macports.

Thanks again.

Michael.

do a "make VERBOSE=1" and you can see exactly what the compiler is being sent as far as -I include directories. I would say that something is missing either in your HDF5 installation, or an HDF5 include path is not being found.

Doesn't VTK come with HDF5 at this point? Why not just let VTK build its own.

I think this is exactly the same problem that I've seen on all mac
platforms where HDF5 is installed from macports.  You can either uninstall
hdf5 from macports, or you need to feed even more detailed information to
paraview.  You can edit the CMakeCache.txt file in the paraview build
directory and put this:

VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=ON
HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/include
HDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS=/opt/local/include
HDF5_LIBRARIES=/opt/local/lib/libhdf5.dylib;/opt/local/lib/libhdf5_cpp.dylib


Mike, I think that the problem is that with VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5=OFF, vtk
will build its own hdf5, but some conflicting hdf5 headers from the system

That speaks to an issue with the environment being used to compile paraview. Uninstall HDF5 from MacPorts and use the one from VTK. This seems like the best course of action and is what I do here when I build my OS X versions of ParaView.
  I also build HDF5 for a few other projects so I got pretty good at building HDF5 myself with the CMake support that HDF5 has had for the last few years.

You can either uninstall hdf5 from macports, or you need to feed even more detailed information to paraview.  You can edit the CMakeCache.txt file in the paraview build directory and put this:

Hi,
   Is it possible for you to upload the data?  By the way, if the cell type
is polyhedron, then this is quite likely the same bug as this:

I uninstalled HDF5 and it builds.

Thanks for the help.

I don't think We are talking about the same thing. I see how to highlight a point on my mesh (which is what I think you mean by saying "Use the select point(s) inside a polygon filter." Maybe I don't know what you mean by "polygon filter."

Can you show me a picture of what you mean?  I will follow up with a mock-up of what I am asking for. 

> After you use the select point(s) inside a polygon filter, you have to select under the top-line View drop-down menu, the Selection Inspector window. At the bottom of this window you can select the color and size of the selected point. It is a little tricky to keep the selected point high-lighted when doing the side-by-side animation of the mesh and the x-vs-y plot. If I recall correctly, the Selection filter needs to be the active element in the Pipeline Browser window.

Fred,

The official name of the tool to which I was mistakenly referring to as 
a "filter" is called "Select Points On." It is the third tool to the 
right of the "?" icon on the top row of icons.

I have attached an example of the display that I thought you were 
looking to obtain. The frame on the left is a deformed mesh plot (actual 
location of the grid at the current time), with a large black dot on the 
grid point for which Velocity(0=x) and Velocity(1=y) versus time are 
shown in the right panel. This is a snap-shot at 94.6 milliseconds in an 
animation that runs out to 135.0 milliseconds. The green vertical line 
in the right panel is a fiduciary showing the location in time of what 
is being displayed in the left panel. (Note the mesh in the left panel 
is 1X100x125 unstructured grid of 8-node hexahedrons.)

This animation was obtained with ParaView 3.14.1 (64-bit) using results 
from an EnSight Gold binary-formatted results file.

Hope this answers your question.

Thank you for clarifying this.

I reconfigured the connect command to manual with the command "ssh
username at machinename \\"/usr/local/bin/pvserver -sp=60600\\"

I had to re-configure ssh to accept password-less logins.  I also had
to create a passwordless public key using ssh-keygen.

Works like charm :-)

Hi Mark,

I just wanted to check in with you to see how far you got. I'm interested
in seeing if you got it to build with all of the options you were looking
for.

Hi Andy,

Thanks for asking. Had to put this aside for a while, but where I am now is I decided I wanted to alter the C++ wiki example to work with a partitioned vtkImageData set, similar to the Python example. Then translate that to Fortran, so I would have a better idea of what I needed to do for the actual application.

C++ works fine, but in the Fortran version, with mpirun -np 2 I'm getting the following error:
ERROR: In /home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView/repo/ParaView/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkExecutive.cxx, line 753
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x3cf5130): Algorithm vtkXMLImageDataWriter(0x3cf4d20) returned failure for request: vtkInformation (0x3cf70c0)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 114245
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA
  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: -1
  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1

I don't get that error for any other np, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16, etc. Wrong values in the output .vtis though (except for np 1). My guess is I'm not sending the Fortran array to the coprocessor correctly. I'm trying to use a 3D fortran array and I think I might need to switch to a 1D.

Hi Mark,

I just wanted to check in with you to see how far you got. I'm interested in seeing if you got it to build with all of the options you were looking for.

Yeah, for structured grids you'll need to set the extent on each process as well as use vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent() to specify the global grid extent. The partitioned arrays in addfields() for single component tuples needs to be the same length as the number of points/cells on the local, partitioned grid.

The extent support for coprocessing is a git dodgy as we're trying to do things in a way that the pipeline doesn't like. One solution to that is to use a vtkMultiPieceDataSet but I haven't tried that enough yet to see how well it works.

Ah, apparently I'm not setting the extents with SetExtent(), vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent() as mentioned on slide 79 of the SC12 slides.

I've been working off of the Phasta example. So if I understand the general idea right, I need to be sending the extent information from the application to the coprocessor call, then
I need to make sure that those also get passed to the image data set creator, and I need to also send the partitioned arrays to the addfields_() call?

Right, single process. I'm working with one code that's all CPU and another that's mixed CPU/GPU. Coprocessing works well for both. There's also MPI versions of the codes that I'm trying to instrument.

The computational mesh is completely regular so I've been using vtkImageData. The MPI versions split the mesh over the ranks. When I run an MPI version with  -np > 1, then I get the following for each process:
ERROR: In /home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 168
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x5ac6430): RegionIDs cannot be 0.

It doesn't crash, but it gives an incorrect image. I'll look through your updated tutorials, I'd been looking through the SC10 slides.

Great, then it was me after all that fixed it!


I'm now at the point where it runs great on a single node with GPUs, I'm trying to extend it to multiple nodes, which I think involves setting up vtkMultiBlockDataSets? I was going to look through the NPICAdaptor for hints on that.

By single node I'm assuming that you mean a single process, correct? What's the type of grid that you're planning on using? The PhastaAdaptor is an example of dealing with an unstructured grid. I also just updated the coprocessing tutorials page (now at http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials) to include the tutorial I'll be doing at SC12. It should have some useful information for doing this. You could just do a polydata input, just set the center of the sphere source in your example based on the process rank (e.g. Sphere->SetCenter(10*rank, 0, 0); ) so that it's easy to tell the difference between each processes input part/domain partition.

Did you get my changes from ParaView's stage branch? My changes didn't make it into ParaView master yet so I'm not sure what changed that caused things to work now. Well, if it's working I'm glad -- I'm not sure I can personally take credit for it though :)

Let me know how it goes with the GPU stuff.

Hi Andy, that sounds like some deep debugging, thanks for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now.

Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki example, which uses the DataGenerator class as the C++ does, if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Tarball attached, it's not exactly the wiki example because I didn't want to bother with passing a DataGenerator object back and forth from C++ to Fortran, so I just make a sphere. The pipeline script is a shrink filter generated by pvclient.

I checked CMake and it looks like it's finding the same version of python.

How do you texture map an image to a sphere?  Could someone give me an example - the one I tried did not work.  I tried the following:
Local server, Windows, 3.14.0
Sources/ Mandelbrot
Filters/ Texture map to a sphere.

Nothing happens.  Is this a bug?

Thanks,

The texture map to sphere function only adds texture coordinates to the data. To actually apply the texture, you have to go to the display panel and select one (or load one from a file).

Subject: [Paraview] problem with data file when moving to version 3.14
Message-ID: <507c9498.ab96320a.3ace.252f@mx.google.com>

I've been using version 3.10 and have just started working with version 3.14

 

During that transition I've encountered a problem with a data set.  The data
is in the VTK legacy format and is ~34mb in size.  I'll be happy to provide
a copy of this data set if that would help.

 

The simple process I use with this dataset is to read it and then use the
glyph filter with arrows.  No problem with version 3.10. I encounter a
problem with version 3.14 with that process.  I compiled ParaView 3.14 to
get some debug information.  I'm working with Visual Studio 2008 on MS
Windows 7 - 64 bit, but doing 32-bit compiles for both 3.10 and 3.14

 

Attached are two screen shots of the results I get with my compiled version
of 3.14 running in the Visual Studio debugger.

 

I would appreciate any thoughts.

 

Phil

Hi Phil,

you're running out of memory, try reducing the number of glyphs. you 
might also check the information tab to verify the contents of the file 
are as expected.

Hi all,


I'm now trying to visualize temporal flow patterns with streamlines.
ParaView's "Stream Tracer with Custom Source" filter may be able to
generate streamlines of the fixed flow of each timestep.

Can I generate temporal streamlines with general PV filters?

By temporal streamlines, do you mean particle paths? Streaklines? ParaView
can do both. I'd recommend the development version though. We made significant
improvements in the usability of those filters. Leo can tell you more.

Hi Berk,


I meant particle paths.
My sources are temporal EnSight Gold data or VTKs merged by PVD.

Phil,

The same thing happens to me on my 32 bit windows system. It looks like 
the glyph 3d class is being very liberal with memory allocation when 
initializing arrays. It's using the number of points in the input 
dataset rather than the number of points that will actually be glyphed 
then after glyphing takes place the sizes are corrected. I'm going to 
hazard a guess that it could be a whole lot smarter in this regard and 
simply size the arrays based on the number of points that it will 
actually glyph. The best thing to do is file a bug report so that it's 
fixed in the coming release. I'll cc the list in case to see if anyone 
can give you a better answer.

Burlen,

 

I appreciate the analysis.  Thank you for your time and the quick response.

 

I'll figure out how to post a bug report.

 

Phil

Phil,

The same thing happens to me on my 32 bit windows system. It looks like the
glyph 3d class is being very liberal with memory allocation when
initializing arrays. It's using the number of points in the input dataset
rather than the number of points that will actually be glyphed then after
glyphing takes place the sizes are corrected. I'm going to hazard a guess
that it could be a whole lot smarter in this regard and simply size the
arrays based on the number of points that it will actually glyph. The best
thing to do is file a bug report so that it's fixed in the coming release.
I'll cc the list in case to see if anyone can give you a better answer.

Yes, would be happy to share the dataset.  It is ~34MB.  Do you have an ftp
site where I can upload the dataset?

 

I can use over 5000 vectors with the 3.10 version.  I get the memory problem
with 200 vectors with the 3.14 version.

Hi Burlen,

 

Yes, I think you are right, that I am running out of memory.  I've attached
a screen shot of the information tab, which has the same values for both the
3.10 version and the 3.14 version.

 

I was surprised that the 3.10 version handles this data set with no reported
problems and 3.14 aborts with the memory problem.  

 

I reduced the number of glyphs from the default 5000 to 1000 when running
the 3.14 version, but the problem persists.

 

Thanks,

Phil

Hi Phil,

you're running out of memory, try reducing the number of glyphs. you might
also check the information tab to verify the contents of the file are as
expected.

I've been using version 3.10 and have just started working with version 3.14

 

During that transition I've encountered a problem with a data set.  The data
is in the VTK legacy format and is ~34mb in size.  I'll be happy to provide
a copy of this data set if that would help.

 

The simple process I use with this dataset is to read it and then use the
glyph filter with arrows.  No problem with version 3.10. I encounter a
problem with version 3.14 with that process.  I compiled ParaView 3.14 to
get some debug information.  I'm working with Visual Studio 2008 on MS
Windows 7 - 64 bit, but doing 32-bit compiles for both 3.10 and 3.14

 

Attached are two screen shots of the results I get with my compiled version
of 3.14 running in the Visual Studio debugger.

 

I would appreciate any thoughts.

 

Phil

We've built ParaView on BlueGene before. I am not sure which specific
OS revs and I think ParaView 3.8 was the last version we've exercised on that
platform.

Pat Marion's script that sets up the cross compilation build can be found at:
https://github.com/patmarion/ParaViewAutoBuild/commits/crayxt-pv310
What the script does is load the appropriate modules, download and
configure our dependencies, then set the appropriate
cmake options to do the two pass (login node and then cross
compilation for compute node)
compilation process that you need on these machines.

Edit the top level script in there to choose BlueGene instead of Cray
and set the paths appropriately for your system. Then run it to do the build.

Hi Joseph,


I tried your data and got a result as yours.
Your data only includes Hex, Wedge, Tet and Pyramid,
but streamlines are stopped earlier.

Same as my polyhedral pipe sample, I applied Tetrahedralize filter
to your pipe source, and I could get valid streamlines.

Subject: [Paraview] Delete Contour sources from Python shell
Message-ID: <159025E4-65B6-4C87-8748-722A7FA92280@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to visualize my data with Python.
When I apply Contour filter and "Delete()" it from Python,
I got an error as below:
> ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Kitware/superbuild/paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/vtkSMProxyListDomain.cxx, line 189
> vtkSMProxyListDomain (0x107d23b0): Index 2 greater than max 1
And last processes after "Delete()" was terminated.

The Contour sources are not reffered from other sources,
and other sources (Stream Tracer, Extract Block, ...etc) could
"Delete()" with no errors.

Any ideas?

Thanks Magician,

Thanks for testing.  What are you using to convert to tet?  Is it a
ParaView feature?

Leo, can the priority of the bug be raised please?

Hi Joe,


"Tetrahedralize" filter is applicable.
All cells are splitted into Tetrahedral ones.
Try it.

As a packager, I believe this is important to achieve as well.

Subject: [Paraview] PythonAnnotation
Message-ID: <CAAODtX2hphU6gSUk-TNX8D+azfWaDBc3FCERjxVg=8indo+wJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
at this link in the online documentation there is an information about
Paraview PythonAnnotation filter. But I can't find it anywhere in my 3.14.1
linux 64bit Paraview. Do anyone have idea where this could be found? Or is
this not yet included in released version? Or is it available in some
source?
I would really like to find it since it would be convenient for displaying
"Crank angle [deg]" value instead of time in seconds for my transient
engine simulation.

.

Thank you,

Martin

Hi Leo,

You don't seem to have used the Tetrahedralise filter?  How have you got
this to work without that?

Mine works fine after setting the fluid as input and source as the inlet,
but I must first use the Tetrahedralise filter.

This feature is not available in 3.14.1, it was implemented more
recently. You can try building from source using git master branch, or
use the nightly binaries. This wiki has instructions on obtaining the
nightly  binaries
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Superbuild#Obtaining_the_source).

Yes that filter is coming in ParaView 4.0. You can try it in the
development head either by compiling from source or using the nightly
packages from the dashboard.

Note, the wiki always reflects the current development version. To get
the documentation for a particular paraview version, download it from
the ParaView download page.

Sorry for joining this conversation late (let's just say, never
experiment with lousy email organizers). Let me explain the background
behind the various flags and options (sticking with Linux systems).

vtkOpenGLRenderWindow has 3 modes: (a) X-based render window with
renderings done in the onscreen frame buffers (b) X-based render
window with rendering done in an offscreen buffer (either FBO, or
pbuffers, and such), (c) non-xbased render window using OSMesa.  In
both, (a), and (b), we need X and hence we see an X window. However
depending on OpenGL drivers and Windowing system, (a) may end up
rendering where overlapping windows corrupt the rendered images, hence
(b) can be used to avoid such anomalies with overlapping windows.

VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN is pretty much a bogus flag as far as ParaView is
concerned. It is used in VTK to set the default value of
vtkRenderWindow::OffScreenRendering flag. I don't know why VTK decided
that this should be a CMake flag since users can change the setting at
run-time anyways, but that has been the case for ages.

--use-offscreen-rendering is ParaView's runtime argument that tells
ParaView to create offscreen render windows (either (b) or (c)) when
render windows are created. Whether (b) or (c) is chosen depends on
whether ParaView was built with OSMesa support (this is where the
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA flag comes into play. VTK_USE_OSMESA, is an
internal variable and cannot be set using CMake, so we can just ignore
it for now).

So one basically switches between onscreen and offscreen rendering
(either using fbo/buffers or OSmesa) using the runtime flag. As I
mentioned, onscreen rendering has had issues with overlapping windows
with certain drivers, windowing systems. Hence we decided to use
offscreen rendering for screenshots to avoid corrupting the captured
image. That itself would cause problems on some other implementations
where FBOs/Pbuffers didn't work correctly, or when using fancy
representations with shaders etc, and hence we added the option to not
use offscreen rendering for screenshots in the Settings dialog.

So we have onscreen and offscreen rendering and what type of offscreen
rendering is used depends on whether we built with OSMesa. That was
the case for the longest time. Now, with Mesa 7.9, Mesa folks decided
that applications could no longer link against libOSMesa and libGL at
the same time. That means that we can no longer support onscreen and
offscreen with OSMesa in the same build of ParaView
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D). Of course, if someone
has ideas on overcoming this issue, I'm all ears.

Hi everyone,
I generate a python script by using Trace for opening a legacy vtk file and
changing the display to "volume".
When I run the script (attached) generated by Trace, the volume has no
transparency. Is this a bug?
Am I doing something wrong?

PS: I am using a Paraview on a Win7x64 machine.

No, I did not use Tetrahedralize.

Are you using the lastest development version?  Are you running paraview as
a single process?

Do you mind saving a state file of your session and post it?

thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Question on Python Annotation Filter
Message-ID: <CCA5BAD8.1C15%Joshua.Murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,

I am playing with the Git Master build, and trying to figure out how the Python Annotation filter works.

I have String Field Data for a UT Time String (MM-DD-YYTHH-MM-SS) that I want to display, and update with each time step.  I have not been able to figure out how to make this work.

Whenever I try to use the filter, I get the message:
"Write a python expression like: 'Time index: %I' % t_index"

Even when I use the expression given , I still get that text on the screen.

Now I am building the git-master from scratch, and NOT using the super build, as the super-build fails to build NUMPY, and then crashes on VRPN, so I may be missing some prerequisites for this filter?

If someone can tell me how to get it working, that would be great!  This filter will solve many problems I have been experiencing, I think (as long as it handles string field data).

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] can't use saved states with Gaussian Resampling filter
Message-ID: <SNT138-W32452C9B2F3842CA6C5CBBD1760@phx.gbl>


Hello,

I have a problem with the Gaussian resampling filter that happens only when I load a state. My pipeline is data (polydata, points on an unstructured grid) -> Gaussian resampling filter -> IsoVolume. If I'm starting from scratch, get the data in via "open", and then apply the filters, I have no problems. If I then save the state and reopen it later, 2 things happen:

1) When I click on the eye next to the Gaussian resampling filter to make the result visible, I get an error message like

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\vtkSMEnumerationDomain.cxx, line 75
vtkSMFieldDataDomain (000000000FBC65E0): Invalid idx: 0 

The number in parenthesis changes but the rest is the same every time. After the error pops up, the results of the filter become viewable, though. I don't get this error if the Gaussian splatter filter is visible when I save the state, but the second (more important) problem happens regardless.

2) If I set the resampling grid to 300x300x300 or above, when the green bar gets to 95%, my computer freezes. I can move the mouse but everything else becomes unresponsive. I can't even bring up task manager and I have to hold the power button to restart.

The error message is no big deal, but the other thing means I can't save my work, I have to re-do it from scratch every time. I would appreciate any help.

Hi,

I am using 3.14.1 64-bit on a single core (if I enable multi-core, it
becomes very unstable).

Adding tets to this small case works, but I've got a bigger duct with a
more refined mesh and adding tets don't fix the problem (make it better
though).

See attached PVSM.

There has been some chatter on the Mesa developers list that sounds like
this may be fixed.

1. The mesa build system underwent a _major_ overhaul.
2. building glapi as a shared object sounds like it _might_ overcome the
mess that involved hidden/duplicate symbols, needed by both GL and OSMesa.
3. Then there's this resolved bug:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6980 that seems to say go
ahead "-lGL -lOSMesa"

I'll give it a try again.

Interesting. Although I am not sure if the mesa developers simply mean
that you can build libGL and libOSMesa at the same time (which is
indeed possible). But worth a try. I will test it out with the latest
mesa and get back to the list. I am positive this didn't work with the
7.* series.

Is it useful to have a pvserver binary that supports both GLX and OSMesa?
Usually an environment that requires pvserver osmesa doesn't have X11
installed, so you wouldn't want a binary with dependencies on X11.

I have to go do a physiological experiment in a few minutes but I just
built mesa with:

env PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/kevin/drm_nightly/lib/pkgconfig/" ./configure
--prefix=/home/kevin/mesa_dual/ --enable-osmesa
--with-gallium-drivers="r300,r600,nouveau,swrast"
--with-dri-drivers="swrast"

and the resulting GL and OSMesa libraries both link glapi which was the
source of the trouble with conflicting/hidden symbols :


[kevin at bubbles lib]$ ldd libOSMesa.so | grep glapi
        libglapi.so.0 => /home/kevin/mesa_dual/lib/libglapi.so.0
(0x00007f6aea460000)

[kevin at bubbles lib]$ ldd libGL.so | grep glapi
        libglapi.so.0 => /home/kevin/mesa_dual/lib/libglapi.so.0
(0x00007f352f8c2000)

Hi, Joe,
  It looks like this was indeed a bug in 3.14.1 but the bug has been fixed
in the current development branch. I am not entirely sure which commit
explicitly did it.

It is quite useful, especially since people want to run command line
tools without render window popping up (OSMesa), but want to use the
Paraview Qt application. Right now, they need to have separate builds
for that, which is kinda inconvenient.

Andy, ah, the problem was programmer error ;) So I now have my fortran image program that's similar to the python wiki example working and I think I'm ready to go back to the actual application and get working on it.

While I was figuring this out, though, I came up with a question that's maybe better for the VTK list. When the vtkImageData extents get set, they overlap. E.g., in the python wiki example there's this line:

imageData.SetExtent(mpi.rank*2, (mpi.rank+1)*2, 0, 5, 0, 5)

if np == 2, then there'll be partitions with extents (0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 5) and (2, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5). This isn't thread safe, right? Because the plane X == 2 will be written to by both ranks? Do the extents actually need to touch? I'm thinking of this as a discrete space so (0, 2, 0, 5, 0,5) and (3, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5) would cover all the nodal points.

Hi Andy,

Thanks for asking. Had to put this aside for a while, but where I am now is I decided I wanted to alter the C++ wiki example to work with a partitioned vtkImageData set, similar to the Python example. Then translate that to Fortran, so I would have a better idea of what I needed to do for the actual application.

C++ works fine, but in the Fortran version, with mpirun -np 2 I'm getting the following error:
ERROR: In /home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView/repo/ParaView/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkExecutive.cxx, line 753
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x3cf5130): Algorithm vtkXMLImageDataWriter(0x3cf4d20) returned failure for request: vtkInformation (0x3cf70c0)

  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA
  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: -1

I don't get that error for any other np, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16, etc. Wrong values in the output .vtis though (except for np 1). My guess is I'm not sending the Fortran array to the coprocessor correctly. I'm trying to use a 3D fortran array and I think I might need to switch to a 1D.

Yeah, for structured grids you'll need to set the extent on each process as well as use vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent() to specify the global grid extent. The partitioned arrays in addfields() for single component tuples needs to be the same length as the number of points/cells on the local, partitioned grid.

The extent support for coprocessing is a git dodgy as we're trying to do things in a way that the pipeline doesn't like. One solution to that is to use a vtkMultiPieceDataSet but I haven't tried that enough yet to see how well it works.

I've been working off of the Phasta example. So if I understand the general idea right, I need to be sending the extent information from the application to the coprocessor call, then
I need to make sure that those also get passed to the image data set creator, and I need to also send the partitioned arrays to the addfields_() call?

Right, single process. I'm working with one code that's all CPU and another that's mixed CPU/GPU. Coprocessing works well for both. There's also MPI versions of the codes that I'm trying to instrument.

The computational mesh is completely regular so I've been using vtkImageData. The MPI versions split the mesh over the ranks. When I run an MPI version with  -np > 1, then I get the following for each process:
ERROR: In /home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 168
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x5ac6430): RegionIDs cannot be 0.

It doesn't crash, but it gives an incorrect image. I'll look through your updated tutorials, I'd been looking through the SC10 slides.

Great, then it was me after all that fixed it!


I'm now at the point where it runs great on a single node with GPUs, I'm trying to extend it to multiple nodes, which I think involves setting up vtkMultiBlockDataSets? I was going to look through the NPICAdaptor for hints on that.

By single node I'm assuming that you mean a single process, correct? What's the type of grid that you're planning on using? The PhastaAdaptor is an example of dealing with an unstructured grid. I also just updated the coprocessing tutorials page (now at http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials) to include the tutorial I'll be doing at SC12. It should have some useful information for doing this. You could just do a polydata input, just set the center of the sphere source in your example based on the process rank (e.g. Sphere->SetCenter(10*rank, 0, 0); ) so that it's easy to tell the difference between each processes input part/domain partition.

Hi Andy, that sounds like some deep debugging, thanks for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now.

Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki example, which uses the DataGenerator class as the C++ does, if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Hi Mark,

The extents refer to point extents and so they need to overlap like this to
make sure that all cells are include (VTK always does cell partitioning in
parallel). So an extent of (0, 2, 0, 5, 0,5) would have 50 cells and 108
points. There is the potential issue that a slice going through a partition
boundary would have duplicated information and it would be up to any
subsequent filter to worry about that which unfortunately, not many do. So
doing something like an integrate data filter after that would result in
twice the outputted value as expected.

Andy

That's unfortunate. Guess we are still stuck with keep the two builds

Hi, Joe,
  Berk reminded me that Andy Bauer has put in some fixes for gradient
interpolation for pyramids (5a7dc931c54d868).  Since your data contain
pyramids, this is quite likely the fix for this bug.

Subject: [Paraview] auto generated line edits in the display panel
Message-ID: <5081FC98.80809@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm finding it at times problematic when making changes to line edits in 
the auto generated display properties panel, that the individual parts 
of the change triggers a render. For example, if I were to change a 
parameter from "1" to "0.005" there are 5 renders triggered (0, 0., 0.0, 
0.00, 0.005). Of course it's no big deal when working locally with small 
data but it can be problematic when rendering takes along time. In other 
cases the intermediate values sent (eg the 4 values 0  to 0.00) are 
invalid and the render produces either nothing or the incorrect results 
until the final value is ready.

At the same time it seems that in other cases it's a desirable thing for 
the auto-generated panels to respond immediately to changes for example 
to make apply button green. So I'm wondering, would it be possible to 
control this behavior with an xml attribute? for example by connecting 
to one or the other of the editingFinished or texteEdited signals? Or 
perhaps for the generation code to select which signal to connect to 
depending on the context?

Since the properties panel is under development I thought it might be a 
good time to suggest such a change (-:

I agree this is an issue. I think in the past for display properties
we relived on editingFinished(), I believe that could be a reasonable
choice still for properties under the display "Section". For the
non-display section, we could still use the current signal, or even if
we change that to editingFinished(), I wonder if that'd be a major
issue. Kyle?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Visualization Ambiguity an a 2nd order
	Tetrahedra
Message-ID: <50841C9A.8080103@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a mesh which is composed of 2nd order tetrahedral elements, 
however if this mesh is visualized in paraview then see that inside one 
2nd order elements other elements are created. So the displayed number 
of elements are not correct. I am a rather new user of Paraview. The vtk 
input file seems to be correct and I am comparing that to Gmsh input 
files and they match. However, Paraview divides the tetra elements in 
extra 1st order like elements. I guess I am mistaken at some point. 
Visualization of data is not a problem since the node data is fine and I 
am visualizing a vector displacement field on the mesh. The input file 
is also attached.

Any comments are appreciated.

Best regards,
Umut

Subject: [Paraview] Scripting Common UI Tasks for Opening Files
Message-ID: <CAKMAvEzWLpSo8L+rtjWGBmk=5JSmXFRrOqi3+QVym_Dr8u-z0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

We have simulation results that we frequently visualize in the same way.
We construct a specific pipeline, visualize some parts as wireframe, set a
color scheme, and so on.  Unfortunately, this is done manually at the
moment, which means that just opening simulation results can take a few
minutes of clicking around.  I'm looking to script this.

Is there a way to script the UI so that it opens a number of given files,
and adjusts features automatically?  My investigations into Python
scripting with Paraview suggest that it cannot directly control the UI,
instead it does analysis using Paraview.

Any suggestions on how to accomplish some automation?

If you're using the python trace (under Tools->Start Trace/Stop Trace) you
can create a python script that should mimic what you're doing in the GUI.
After you stop the trace you have the option of saving it as a macro which
will then allow you to click on a widget in the GUI to replay those
actions.

You could also create a state file (File->Save State) which may also
accomplish what you're looking for.

If either of those don't work as expected and/or desired, I would recommend
emailing back the list with specific problems.

Great! hope it's not too bad to fix. I noticed a couple more relating to 
the auto generation in the display properties.

The word wrapping is funky. it wraps even when there is enough space to 
fit the text on one line. When it wraps the labels overlap each other 
obscuring the text.


The "glyph type" drop down is sized differently from the others.


The algorithm that translates xml names into label text doesn't handle 
acronyms. for example: "NumberOfVTKBlah" in the xml shows up as "Number 
Of VTKBlah", it would be nicer if it were "Number Of VTK Blah".

ParaView will tetrahedralize higher order elements for certain
algorithms. For the most part, this should be hidden. What particular
algorithm are you seeing this with?

Hi,

This is a mesh that I export from the commercial finite element code 
ANSYS. I am not sure how to answer this question.

But I also could not understand the point of your question since the 
cell representation should be easy to understand by the software. It 
should only draw elements around the main nodes that represent the 
element, so for this case, the 10-nodes that belong to the element 
should form the element. Why do you relate this to a meshing algorithm? 
I am not expert on mesh generation of course ;-)

There are two 10 node tetrahedral elements interfaced in my code for 
ANSYS elements. Namely,

SOLID92 and SOLID187

which are both 2nd order 10 node tetra elements.

If I follow this thread

http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.science.paraview.user/10670

which seems to solve the problem. And I can see the normal 2nd order 
elements without divided into extra cells.

BR,
Umut

I'm sorry, I was sloppy in my use of the word "link".

I believe it may now be possible to build ParaView once with accelerated
mesa and offscreen rendering in software.

The GL and OSMesa libraries built as I described now link to the shared
library glapi which was the source of missing symbols in the OSMesa
library when the glapi object was compiled into the GL library and its
symbols were hidden, and the source of conflicting symbols when the
glapi object was compiled into both the GL and OSMesa libraries.

Now that glapi is a stand alone shared library it should be no different
than two shared libraries both linking the math library.

The algorithm that translates xml names into label text doesn't handle
acronyms. for example: "NumberOfVTKBlah" in the xml shows up as "Number Of
VTKBlah", it would be nicer if it were "Number Of VTK Blah".

You could also use the "label" attribute to specify the human-readable
label in the xml itself.

Celia,

What version of ParaView is this? I just tried doing something similar
with the development version of ParaView and the state seems to load
correctly without the error or the freeze. Can you try with the
development version? You can download the nightly binaries using the
instructions here
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Superbuild#Obtaining_the_source).

The problem is still present, can you share your data/state files?

What version of ParaView are you using? Your trace file is missing the
setup of the ScalarOpcityFunction. When I do the similar from the
development version of ParaView, I get the trace file as attached.
You'll see the new line:

a1_RTData_PiecewiseFunction = CreatePiecewiseFunction(
Points=[37.35310363769531, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 276.8288269042969, 1.0, 0.5,
0.0] )

That's what's missing in your state file. That could be a bug in the
version you're using.

Hi,

So this doesn't quite work.  The problem is that the generated script seems
to hard-code particular filenames, rather than say just looking at the
order of the pipeline.  Given that we have to open several files at the
same time, and then arrange a visualization of simulation results, this
isn't quite what we want.

I was unaware of the macro feature, so I might be able to investigate a bit
further to write a python macro that does what we want.

I considered writing a script to generate a state file automatically for a
given set of filenames.  I'm not sure if this is the best option or not.
It depends upon the portability of these files from version to version, and
the dependency upon particular files.

In particular, we have several file types which particular features of
results.  So, for instance, we might have for simulation run X, and
features f_j:

X_f1_*.vtp
X_f2_*.vtu
X_f3_*.vtu

We need to open these files and make some basic adjustments so that we have
a good idea of what is happening in the simulation.

Hi

for time-series data I'm using the attached script. First it looks in 
the 'post'-folder and sort the files by number naturally. After that it 
gives the sorted array to the readerclass (change this for your reader 
as in the traced macro you got from the macro tool)

Then the Representation-Style is set.

If you hit the Button again the last timestep is loaded (I use this

Thanks for the info Leo,

I am, however, having trouble building the source that I've downloaded.

Could you point me to any instructions on how to build?

seem to tie up with the files I get.

Hi,

I have the same problem, but don't know how to start ActiveMQ?
Using Ubuntu and being an beginner at this.
(Installed using the SuperBuild, than configured for system-tomcat like  
the wiki said)

The wiki does not recommend the system tomcat as it is the most
complex setup, it just provide some background information to help an
experienced user to setup a head-less server if mandatory.

Here is the set of command line needed to download, unpack and run activemq.

$ curl http://download.nextag.com/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.7.0/apache-activemq-5.7.0-bin.tar.gz
-O
$ tar xvfz apache-activemq-5.7.0-bin.tar.gz
$ ./apache-activemq-5.7.0/bin/activemq start

If you don't want to use the system tomcat, which I recommend as it is
your first install, you can do the following to download and start
tomcat

$ curl http://www.bizdirusa.com/mirrors/apache/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.32/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.32.tar.gz
-O
$ tar xvfz apache-tomcat-7.0.32.tar.gz
$ ./apache-tomcat-7.0.32/bin/startup.sh

What is missing here is the ParaViewWeb part... So you will need to
configure tomcat by adding the pw-config.properties file inside
TOMCAT_HOME/lib and making sure that all the path provided in the file
are correct.
Then add all the generated war files into TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/.

And you are done.

Ah, now I understand. This should be fixed. Try using a nightly
binary. To download one, look at this page:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Superbuild

and look for instruction on how to download generated binaries.

Hi There!

right now i'm playing around with paraview and manta ray tracer. I got
Manta compile on my linux machine and got paraview compile with the manta
plug-in.

Now I'm trying to use the manta view in paraview with vtk data derived from
an OpenFoam case. The result is a crash that I don't understand:

Message-ID: <CAOKFjRMSennCJDAsPOyUmOcrUKYThmrfg_KnrFPn_c5jmnsJxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everybody, (sorry my english)

I am new in paraview and have some experience with VTK with python (some
codes that parse a DICOM Medical images and rendering as
volume/isosurface).

My basic question is: how can i use the output generated by my VTK code and
input in a paraview to be render? (Is this possible?)

Below an piece of my python code:

   reader = vtk.vtkDICOMImageReader()
   reader.SetDirectoryName(dirDicom)
   reader.Update()

   contour = vtk.vtk.vtkMarchingCubes()
   contour.SetInput( reader.GetOutput() )
   contour.ComputeNormalsOn()
   contour.SetValue( 0, 1250 )

   mapper = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
   mapper.SetInput( contour.GetOutput() )
   mapper.ScalarVisibilityOff()

   actorBone = vtk.vtkLODActor()
   actorBone.SetNumberOfCloudPoints( 1000000 )
   actorBone.SetMapper( mapper )
   actorBone.GetProperty().SetColor( 1, 1, 1 )
   actorBone.GetProperty().SetOpacity( 0.7 )
   ##
   ##>>>> HERE,  Instead of use a vtkRenderWindow I want show in paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] problem using 'stream tracer with custom source' filter
Message-ID: <CAGcvOTV2mG8cWgsYv9Hnw0PjAY5DQZx2NFC-EMceXBCcFeAF7A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I was trying to plot streamlines in paraview (3.10.1 64bit) for my openfoam
cases. What I did is to import the inlet and internalmesh separately, apply
'mask point' on the inlet, and use filter 'stream tracer with custom
source', with mask point as source and internalmesh as the input. At some
point, I got a satisfactory streamline plot, everything looks nice.
However, I could not duplicate the plot. I went back and did everything the
same, the resultant streamlines became extremely short, only 1/10 of length
of the flow pathway. And tuning the parameters didn't give me better
results either.

Anyone has any idea on why this happens or how to make a streamline in
paraview correctly?

I truly appreciate your help.

Best,

Hang

Hi Everyone,

I am a newbie (and this is a cliche ) in paraview and trying to run ParaViewWeb using javascript rendering.
I installed the Paraview Web and i can access various webapps Ex :

http://localhost:8180/PWApp/index.jsp
http://localhost:8180/PWService/

[ i installed ParaviewWeb on port 8180]

As a next step i am tried to use its javascript rendering but could not see any thing on the page.  
JavaScript console shows "Error: Connection failed" in line 116 ParaviewWeb.js

Here is my complete HTML
<html>
	 <head>
	     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost:8180/PWService/js/ParaViewWeb.js"></script>
	 </head>
	 <body>
	   <table width='100%'>
		<tr>
		   <td>Viewport title</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td id='renderer-container-id'>
		       <!-- The renderer will be inserted here -->

	<script type="text/javascript">
		 // Set the web service base URL
		 var serverUrl = "http://localhost:8180/PWService";
	       
		 //
		 // Create a paraview proxy
		 //
		 var paraview = new Paraview(serverUrl);
		 paraview.createSession("Session name", "Session comment", "default");

		 var activeView = paraview.CreateIfNeededRenderView();
	 
		 // Create and bind renderer
		 var renderer = new JavaScriptRenderer("rendererName", serverUrl);
		 renderer.init(paraview.sessionId, activeView.__selfid__);
		 renderer.setSize('200','200');
		 renderer.bindToElementId("renderer-container-id");
		 renderer.start();
      </script>

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview slice planes screenshot as images
Message-ID: <CABhMZ0B+7kOO3m2Um1Jv-u9Nez=ncG7OB51sRWrSN9SEOJopSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to save applied slicing planes into jpeg (or any other kinds)
images. Is this possible? can anyone tell me how? If it can only be done
via python script, can you send me some parts of the script?
Also, is it possible to vary the slicing planes not by axis' range but by
some kind of elevation angle with a point as its orientation anchor?
really appreciate it..


thank you..
Shiddiq

Try to move the script section between </table> and </body> . Moreover does the other applications let you properly see 3d content?

Subject: [Paraview] Using VR-Style input devices
Message-ID: <201210241540.55122.johannes.zarl@jku.at>

Hi,

I'm currently trying to configure ParaView for a CAVE-like environment. So far 
I was able to set up the pvservers correctly and even make headtracking over 
VRPN work.

Myself, I'm more of a newbie concerning ParaView, so I'm having some trouble 
understanding the state-file and how to define a wand-device so that ParaView 
can use it.

As far as I understand it, the VRPlugin reads the VRConnectionManager and 
VRInteractorStyles tags from the state-file and makes the connection to the 
server.

The Styles in VRInteractorStyles are supposed to reference a proxy name, that 
they are then attached to. So in this example:

<VRInteractorStyles>
   ...snip...
  <Style class="vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin" 
origin="CutFunction.Origin">
   <Button name="travel.2"/>
   <Tracker name="travel.wand"/>
  </Style>
  <Style class="vtkVRStyleGrabNRotateSliceNormal" normal="CutFunction.Normal">
    <Button name="travel.3"/>
    <Tracker name="travel.wand"/>
  </Style>
</VRInteractorStyles>

The state-file should have a node <ProxyCollection name="CutFunction"> defined 
somewhere?

How do I define such a CutFunction? What other Proxies are there that can be 
defined/connected to a tracker/button/analog device?

Cheers,
  Johannes

Berk,

Thanks for this information, I would like to compile Paraview with 
vector graphics export facilites, especially svg if possible.

Where shall I look for these instructions?

Best,

Both these issues have been addressed in the development version and
the fixes will be included in the next release. You can try the
nightly binaries available on the website (instructions:

Hi,

1) is a known bug in the release of 3.14.X : 
http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/5242/
you can compile PV from source using the latest git or replace 
vtk/IO/vtkSTLReader.cxx with that one from the bugreport.
or only use binary-stl files.

2) I've the same issue when I copy PV from one client to another (both 
on Ubuntu 12.04), if i compile it from source this problem is gone away.

best wishes,
Christian

The cut function comes in when you either put in a clip or a slice filter.

You can link up the interactor styles to any proxy actually. It mainly
depends on the output type of the interactor style and the input type of
the proxy.

Hi guys, sorry to keep finding problems, but I'm stuck here:

  X11_Xt_LIB could not be found.  Required for VTK X lib.

Can you give me an example of a lib that should be in there so I can search
for that to get the dir please?

Subject: [Paraview] Using VR-Style input devices
In-Reply-To: <201210241540.55122.johannes.zarl@jku.at>
References: <201210241540.55122.johannes.zarl@jku.at>

Hi Johannes,

Very recently, we have improved the VR API and related tools and now
the VR plugin comes with a GUI to configure connection managers and
interactor styles.

The way it works now is that you create a connection manager (lines
475 - 483), which will be generated by the GUI if used, and then for
the styles,
you would link it with the ID of the proxy and its specific property
that you want to control. Now said that the GUI shows you the name of
the proxy and not the ID
for obvious reasons. Then depending upon the type of the proxy and
property you specify a particular input from a HCI device. Currently
we support analog, button, and tracker.

The wiki here is bit old:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display
We wrote a source article as well: http://www.kitware.com/source/home/post/66

This recent work is not in master yet (hopefully this Friday) but you
can checkout this branch: vtk_vr_improvements_new_gui
if you want to from paraview stage repository. The branch contains
bunch of bug fixes, and API improvements.

475   <VRConnectionManager>
476     <VRUIConnection name="vrui" address="localhost" port = "8555">
477       <Button id="0" name="1"/>
478       <Button id="1" name="2"/>
479       <Button id="2" name="3"/>
480       <Tracker id="0" name="head"/>
481       <Tracker id="1" name="wand"/>
482     </VRUIConnection>
483   </VRConnectionManager>
484   <VRInteractorStyles>
485     <Style class="vtkVRTrackStyle" proxy="267"
property="EyeTransformMatrix">
486       <Tracker name="vrui.head"/>
487     </Style>
488     <Style class="vtkVRGrabWorldStyle" proxy="267"
property="ModelTransformMatrix">
489       <Tracker name="vrui.wand"/>
490       <Button name="vrui.1"/>
491     </Style>
492    </VRInteractorStyles>

This include libXt.so and include files such as
/usr/include/X11/Core.h. On debian-based systems, it's available as
the package "libxt-dev". Also you can try the nightly binaries
directly, if you don't want to build from source. The instructions to
download the binaries are:

Hi Sohail,

Did you get a chance to look at the warnings for the
vtkIOGeometryCxx-TestWindBladeReader test for the
http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/1396/ gerrit topic? It's going to need
to be fixed pretty soon if it's going to make it into the ParaView 4.0
release.

Thanks,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Vorticity computation from separated velocity array
Message-ID: <CAMWaLo3cbgccQdzetKtOi6nxT5WTt22Jh6BxGN4C3sNQnXv4cA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to compute vorticity from separated velocity vectors, but
pre-installed filter of paraview seems to require 3-components vector as an
input. Then, I have tried to use the "Python Calculator" filter to
construct it.  I put "hstack([VelocityX, VelocityY, VelocityZ])" into the
"Expression" field following the wiki.  However, it created just a copy of
VelocityX instead of 3-components vector.  How can I construct 3-components
array form separated velocity vectors?

I have also tried to use the "Programmable Filter".  But, it has been
really difficult for me and I could not just extract the vector from the
input.  The vectors live in vtkUnstructuredGrid in a vtkMultiBlockDataSet
and there are no function to extract Point Data form it.

Regards,

Makoto

What version of ParaView are you using?  I was able to use
"hstack([VelocityX, VelocityY, VelocityZ])" with the Python Calculator
filter in v3.14.1. Alternatively you could try the Calculator filter with
"iHat*VelocityX+jHat*VelocityY+kHat*VelocityZ".

Ok, looking at the superbuild.  I'm behind a firewall, so all git commands
need to be over http:// rather than git://

Which makefile can I mod this path in?

I was suggesting directly downloading the binaries, not even trying to
build the superbuild. Building using superbuild may be trickier,
especially since you're getting other build issues with building
ParaView itself. If you want to build from source, you'll have to edit
the versions.cmake file to use http:// instead of git:// for all git
repos.

The way you have set those properties at the end (the color/opacity), they
cannot be exported and viewed in Paraview. Since your 'contour' filter
produces a vtkPolyData, you can use vtkXMLPolyDataWriter to write it to a
vtp file which can then be opened with Paraview. I'd suggest you do that,
then setup the properties (color/opacity) in Paraview.

Yes, I noticed. Together with the information in a thread on this list
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-July/025507.html), it was 
quite valuable, though...

Thanks, I didn't see that before.

That's great news -- I wasn't aware that the GUI work is this close to 
entering master. The screenshot looks promising. I will definitely try it out 
next week.

Utkarsh,

could you, please, say, where is it possible to get a patch, fixing this issue?
I will try to prepare fix-upload for Ubuntu 12.04. Strange, but
Paraview in Debian, built from the same source, has no such messages.

Thanks,

Anton

Today, I have tried again on 3.12.0.  I don't know why but today both of
the methods you mentioned work.

Thank you.

Message-ID: <CA+8Z1WisPfzxwHrTNM-4j-RgtH1ZjePHqDkh-BO7H7cG-sF97A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I was using Paraview stable 3.14.1 on Mountain Lion until I had problems
with the Python Calculator, related with numpy. I then searched and found
this bug info http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13244    where  it is
adviced to download the nightly superbuild. I followed the instructions,
downloaded and installed, but unfortunately paraview just crashes when it
is starting. I tried a previous superbuild (since the current shows some
build errors), but the problem persists. It seems that everything is tested
on SnowLeopard. I would like to know if there is a version for Mountain
Lion which I can use and solves the numpy problem, or if there is a
workaround with the current stable version.
Thanks in advance.

Best regards / Cordialmente,

William-Fernando Oquendo

William,

There's a  known issue with Mac OSX nightly binaries. They currently
don't work on Mountain Lion. We'll be tracking that down soon. The
binaries should then work on Mountain Lion as well, once the issue is
addressed in the very near future.

Subject: [Paraview] How to generate/access Points array from vtkImageData
	Inbox
Message-ID: <CAP9tZ2V4m5Ogvhdd7rpoPmzCebaGXuA5t1sVm9rz4zsHB9cPAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am writing a Python programmable filter in Paraview. The input
source is a type of vtkImageData. I want to get the coordinates of all
the points and use them to generate an output of type
vtkStructuredGrid. Currently I am using a for loop:

pdi = self.GetInput()
pdo = self.GetOutput()

numPts = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
points = vtk.vtkPoints()
points.Allocate(numPts, numPts)

for i in xrange(numPts):
        point = pdi.GetPoint(i)
        # ...
        # other manipulations on point
        # ...
        points.InsertNextPoint(point)

# ...
pdo.SetDimensions(pdi.GetDimensions())
pdo.SetPoints(points)


My problem is that for loop became very slow for large image volumes.
So I am replacing it with numpy. But I couldn't find a way to get
points array directly from vtkImageData, something like:

points = pdi.Points
points = points * 0.5
newPoints.SetData(numpyTovtkDataArray(points))


It seems that there is no internal points array stored in
vtkImageData. Is there a easy way to do this?


Thanks

Gang

You should come up with numpy expression that derives each point's location.

vtkImageData's point locations are implicitly determined by the image data's
origin, extent, and spacing.

Thanks for explanation. I will write the numpy expression for this.
One related question is how to convert the vtkPoints to a numpy array.

Try this modern version of that:

from paraview.numeric import fromvtkarray
array = fromvtkarray(
  self.GetInput().GetPoints().GetData()
)
print array

Hi David,

fromvtkarray works like a charm. Terrific! Thank you.

Is there any extra online documentation / examples for these paraview
python libraries? I could only find limited examples on Paraview wiki
pages. I hope I can learn from more examples.


Thanks

Gang

I don't think anyone has been systematic about documenting it.

So the scattered collection of what is on the VTK examples project,
the ParaView wiki, and of course pydoc and the source itself, are your
best bets.

Thanks Seb,

I realized that i was running my html page  under Apache but it was not properly configured to talk to paraviweWeb which is under. tomcat. I Fixed that and i worked fine. Thanks

My goal is to add  this code under a Mediawiki Page and run it on a button click BUT when i do that i get "uncaught exception: get_module() takes no arguments (2 given). Paraview.js line 231"

I see one deference in the way internal paraviewWeb POST calls are made.

1. When running outside Mediawiki (This Works) : 
  {id:3,method:"VisualizationsManager.invoke",params:["87095ed9081c5fc32c76f43105d74c32-28", "{\"id\":1,\"method\":\"get_module\",\"params\":[]}"]}

2. Within MW ( This gives above exception)
{id:3,method:"VisualizationsManager.invoke",params:["87095ed9081c5fc32c76f43105d74c32-27", "{\"id\":1,\"method\":\"get_module\",\"params\":\"[]\"}"]}

the difference is  how empty param are specified in both the POST requests.   [] Vs. \"[]\"

Both are made internally by ParaViewWeb, so do you think i can control this in my javascript ( actually jQuery) code ?? OR on ParaviewWeb code/config side ??


Thanks
Sumit Purohit

Try to move the script section between </table> and </body> . Moreover does the other applications let you properly see 3d content?

Subject: [Paraview] adding glyphs in reader plugin
Message-ID: <082105CE28AA69458381C3ED8E0896731068325E@ICTS-S-MBX3.luna.kuleuven.be>

I have written a paraview reader plugin using vtk to read simulation results from an in house code. The reader produces several time varying vtkPolyData objects. Right now I have to manually add glyphs to these vtkPolyData objects in order to visualize them. Since the reader can be made to know which glyph to add to each vtkPolyData object I would like to automate this. How can I add glyphs inside a reader?

Hum...

I guess it is exactly the same JavaScript code that you execute in both context.
To me it seems to be a bug in the way the ParaViewWeb javascript is behaving.

But in the mean time, do you try to embed the 3D renderer in an iFrame
or do you properly embed it into the current HTML document ? Because,
if you were planing to use some iFrame, the ParaViewWeb javascript
part could be done in that iFrame page and that might work as is...
(At least as a first step)

A third solution, could also be to patch ParaViewWeb javascript so it
could properly work in your context or depending on how complex your
web application is going to be, create an ad-hoc JavaScript library
that will make only the call you need and the way you want.

Hope my comments helped you,

Thanks,

Seb

Thank Seb for the reply,

1. Yes, i am using exactly the same javascript in both the contexts.
2.  I tried your suggestion of using iframe and I AM ABLE TO EMBEDDED  the functional html page into my  non-functional page and visualize it.

Can you suggest me where/what to make a patch in ParaViewWeb javascript as using iframe is not a "solution" for me. I want to dynamically create this visualization. 


Thanks
Sumit

This change is only in VTK in gerrit so you need to follow the directions
there to check out the code and run the test. The directions are at
http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/1396/

I'm not sure why paraview is crashing though. I'll check on that.

Hi Sumit,

the bug seems to be related to the content of that method

/*
 * Helper method used to simplify the construction of JsonRPC objects
 */
function JsonRpcObjectBuilder( methodName, methodArguments ) {
    var args = [];
    if(typeof(methodArguments) != "undefined") {
        if(typeof(methodArguments) != "object") {
            args = [ methodArguments ];
        } else {
            args = methodArguments;
        }
    }
    return {
        id      : 1,
        method  : methodName,
        params  : args
    };
}

inside the file WebServer/PWService/web/js/dev/paraview.js which you
can point to in your testing process instead of its parent compressed
one ParaViewWeb.js. Although, don't forget to add /dev/json2.js and
/dev/jsonrpc.js too when you are using the development version of the
js.

Once you figured out, what need to be done to prevent those extra "
around [] then you can either send me the full paraview.js or just the
diff so I can patch and update the ParaViewWeb repository.

Thanks for your help,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Building Paraview
Message-ID: <508EB766.3000205@informatik.tu-freiberg.de>

Hello,

i am trying to build paraview from source.
i checked out
     Paraview and PVVTK
from git.
i linked PVVTK to Paraview/VTK and then i made a new build directory
     Paraview-20121029,
from which i run "ccmake ../Paraview". i disabled all modules and plugins
and getting an error due to
     protobuf and protoc

At first cmake was not able to find "Findprotobuf.cmake". Then i adjusted
the filename in "/usr/share/cmake-2.8/FindProtobuf.cmake" to have the
filename "/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Findprotobuf.cmake". then protobuf
cmake file could be found but the following errors appeared.
i do not know how to fix that.

i attached CMakeCache.txt and CMakeLog.txt which was created by
running
     cmake . > CMakeLog.txt

thank you,
henry

Seems like are missing the rest of the git submodules,
Thirdparty/protobuf, Qt/Testing, and  Utilities/VisItBridge.

The best thing to is to ask git to fetch all of them (including VTK)
for you like so:
git clone --recursive git://paraview.org/ParaView.git

Subject: [Paraview] pvtu files and Cell Type polyhedron
Message-ID: <CCB59B99.2B37%knoth@tropos.de>

I have a pvtu file and two vtu files.

If I load Test2.pvtu in to paraview nothing happens.

If I load the vtu files separately, I get the desired result.

If I change the CellType from 42 to 12 in the vtu files I get the correct output by loading Test2.pvtu.

It seems to me that the special cell type 42 is not correctly handled by the vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridReader

Merhaba Umut,

I would give it a bit more time before compiling ParaView for vector
graphics. We are still working on resolving issues and making improvements.
We also don't have any documentation yet. I CC'ed David. He is the main
developer and can provide some more details.

Best,
-berk

The superbuild packages already have the vector graphics export built
in (I verified with last night's build). If you'd like to build your
own version, the current 'master' branch on git will have support for
this feature (see
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install and follow the
directions for the development version from git).

To export a scene, use File -> Export Scene, and select a vector
graphics format. Currently, we have basic support for exporting 3D
scenes and 2D charts as .ps, .eps, .svg, and .pdf files.

Subject: [Paraview] KEYS_TO_COPY method
Message-ID: <508FF21B.6080905@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr>

Hi,

I'm trying to implement a self-made plugin in Paraview, using a working 
VTK filter.
This filter sets a key into the information of my output data set

    /outInfo = output->GetInformation()/


I have to retrieve this key into the RequestData() pass of the connected 
filter. It works well in a pure VTK pipeline, but in Paraview, it seems 
that an intermediate filter vtkPVPostFilter drops this information key.
So I found in this mailing list that keys could be copied, by appending 
the key to KEYS_TO_COPY() key of the information.
What I do by

    /outInfo->AppendUnique(vtkExecutive::KEYS_TO_COPY(),
    cnsVTK_ResultReader_HDF5::DATA_POINTER());/

The output information PrintSelf() :

    /Debug: Off/
    /Modified Time: 235702/
    /Reference Count: 1/
    /Registered Events: (none)/
    /DATA_POINTER: 1757632496/
    /DATA_NUMBER_OF_PIECES: 0/
    /KEYS_TO_COPY: DATA_POINTER/
    /DATA_EXTENT_TYPE: 0/
    /DATA_PIECE_NUMBER: -1/
    /DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS: 0/
    /End of result reader Request Data/

But the key is not copied, or at least, I can't read it into the 
consumer RequestData() pass :

    /inInfo = inputDataSet->GetInformation()/

The /inInfo/ PrintSelf() :

    /Debug: Off/
    /Modified Time: 234317/
    /Reference Count: 1/
    /Registered Events: (none)/
    /DATA_NUMBER_OF_PIECES: 1/
    /DATA_EXTENT_TYPE: 0/
    /DATA_PIECE_NUMBER: 0/
    /DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS: 0/

So, all specific information keys have been deleted...

Thank you in advance for your help,

Yves

Subject: [Paraview] Using VR-Style input devices

Hello again,

Today I tried out the new VR improvements in the master branch. I can tell 
it's a big improvement over the state-file-hacking. Connecting some tracker 
input to an object is so much easier (and less error-prone) now!

However, some issues remain for me:

1) GUI-Improvements:
 - It would be nice if one could specify the TrackerTransform via the GUI
 - The ability to load tracker-configurations from a file would be handy
 - When connecting tracker-input to objects, it would be nice if only 
compatible properties were displayed.
 - It would be nice if the grab tool would work globally, more like the mouse, 
and not have to be connected to a specific object.

2) Display issues:
 - In a curved screen setup powered by 3 overlapping projectors, the 
perspective seems to be incorrect:
This can be most easily observed when you move your head past the coordinate 
system origin. What I would expect to see is that the z-axis (pointing out of 
the screen) points somewhat to the right when my x-position is negative, and 
to the left when my x-position is positive. What I actually see is that the 
perspective of the axis-cross does not change.
What could I have messed up in the configuration that would cause this?

 - When moving a Slice-plane using the tracker (SliceOrigin,SliceOrientation), 
the displayed slice plane is not updated. I can see that the plane was moved 
on the client window, but the actual slice is not affected. I have to move the 
plane a little with the mouse to trigger an update of the slice.

 - Grabbing an object only affects the object in the client window, not the 
server view. 
When the Grab tool is connected to an object, I can move that object around, 
but I only see this in the client window. On the server side, things are 
totally unaffected by the changes. (I didn't test this one again with the new 
git master, so excuse me if it has been fixed since 3.14.1)

3) Loose ends
I didn't find anything I can do with an analog input. Do I have to enable some 
special build option to enable those?

Cheers,
  Johannes

Subject: [Paraview] dynamic information for the animation view
Message-ID: <5090019B.8040902@ec-nantes.fr>

I have a custom reader (c++, custom panel ). The reader generate (on the 
fly)  several sliders (the information to create the sliders is in the 
opened file).
Now a want to animate my reader with the animation View, but (because 
the slider are absent of the xml description) the information is absent 
in the Animation View.

How a can add a property (something like vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty) to 
my reader dynamically??
Any examples in the ParaView sources???

Thanks
Felipe

ps: working with ParaView git on (linux ubuntu 12.04).

Hi Yves,

You need to make sure that you are setting the right keys on the right
information objects. We use quite a few different information objects so
this is confusing at times.

You need to set KEYS_TO_COPY() on the request (first argument to
RequestData).
You need to set the key/value you want copied on the output information
(outInfo) and read it from input information.

The data object's information object is not used for pipeline purposes so
you can't do:

*inInfo = inputDataSet->GetInformation()*
*
*
You should do:

inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] Use of glyph inside a C++ filter
Message-ID: <CAHSaYkqd9QNufkXo=ZMnJHg=o+O-EeUVQcC0MbxhhHv37N0u4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to use the glyph filter internally inside another C++ filter.

To set a normal property, I just use the associated command as show below:

vtkPVGlyphFilter* glyph = vtkPVGlyphFilter::New();

glyph->SetInput(tmpOutput);

glyph->SetSource(disk->GetOutput());

glyph->SetScaleMode(1);

glyph->SetOrient(1);

However, I am not sure how to set the properties that use a
command="SetInputArrayToProcess".

For example how do I tell the glyph filter which property contains the
vectors to use ("SelectInputVectors").

In other words, what should I use instead of SetSelectInputVectors(...)
which doesn't exists because "SetInputArrayToProcess" is used instead.



Thanks,

Nehme

Well you probably know already, but I won't be able to make the changes
right now.  I have a submission due this Friday.  The reader still works
for newer data sets but fails for the outdated one that you guys use for
testing.  So the fixes will have to come later.

Subject: [Paraview] crashing on megapoint data
Message-ID: <A6DC7945B8B27848A60E229D7E2951E91CD51042@ECS-EXG-P-MB03.win.lanl.gov>

I'm running the vanilla website release of version 3.14.1 on the OS

RedHat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.5 (Tikanga) Kernel 2.6.18-108chaos on an x86_64

This code will display my ~120,000,000 points using cosmo format input, but only with a constant color (gray).  If I try to add color, paraview sucks up all of the available memory (~22GB) and crashes.  This happens with either PointSprites or with EyeDomeLighting View.  (Not sure if it happens with plain points or not...)

If you have any suggestions on how to mitigate the crash, I will gladly give them a try.

Thanks very much.  Bucky Kashiwa

Try disabling display lists i.e. check "Use Immediate Mode Rendering"
checkbox in the Settings dialog (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Settings#Render_View_General).
