Subject: [Paraview] Alter VTK Object on True Client-Server
Message-ID: <CAA6iNM2Nr-zb5uy1vHjArRr2JCphLt+TpUy+3+j_Vi0PLP0p_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is there a proper way to update a VTK object on ParaView's true
client-server architecture? I am writing a plugin which currently uses
vtkSMProxy::GetClientSideObject(), however, this does not work on a true
client-server. Are there any mechanisms that ParaView already has which will
allow this to work properly?

What are you trying to do with the VTK object? And what version of
ParaView is this?

I am currently using ParaView 3.10.1 (latest stable, I believe) and I have a
custom VTK object which inherits vtkAlgorithm. I require such functionality
to update properties on my GUI (my GUI is a friend class on my object to
access certain private members which are essential to properly update the
GUI). Is there a more proper/effective way to accomplish this in ParaView?

Try looking at "information_only" properties. That's one of the
recommended ways to get values from the server-side. However
friendships won't work in that case and you'd need public API to
access those values.

Subject: [Paraview] Exporter Plugin Example
Message-ID: <326DD8A9-3BBD-44A0-9527-AFEC70103C06@ufz.de>

Dear ParaView users / developers,

I would like to create a ParaView exporter for the OpenSG scene graph as a plugin. But I haven?t found an example on how to do this. I saw that the VRMLExporter is registered in ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/utilities.xml but as far as I understand this xml file is needed at compile time.

So is this possible at all and has someone already written an exporter as a plugin and can share his/her experience and give me some starting points.

Thanks!

Simple create a server-manager plugin that regsiters a new proxy under
the exporter's group. The "Export" code looks at all proxies defined
in this group each time (if I remember correctly).

That should work. Ideally we can get packaging XDMF's python module working
properly for the next major release. I just created a bug for that task

Message-ID: <BFC6F607797EE4439A63CAC7BC43A1D110FFCC@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Hi,

We've recently been generating a series of plugins to get our data into ParaView. We generate our vtkUnstructuredGrids from our raw data by specifying a recursion depth into a rather large, hierarchical dataset. It occurs to us that we could set a minimal recursion depth and quickly generate a small vtkUnstructuredGrid, which would be suitable for drawing during mouse interaction. ParaView seems to use a fixed underlying quadratic clustering algorithm to do this. Is there any way to override this algorithm without modifying framework code?

Thanks in advance,

Owen.

No, there's no easy way to modify the underlying LOD algorithm without
changing the framework code.

Obviously I prefer David's approach of fixing it so it's always on :) 

But, if for some reason it can't be fixed by next release, making the option advanced again is good enough. 

Thanks again,

Dear David,

Were you ever able to upload a new binary? Paraview is the last software holding me back from upgrading to Lion. I need the python interface (pvpython), so the 3.8.1 binary is not an option for me.

Instead of modifying the underlying LOD algorithm, what about turning
off the LOD, and create a new type of representation for your data
with the small vtkUnstructuredGrid? and of course, you have to change
the representation to this new type during mouse interaction.

Hi,

What you want to do is derive a new class from vtkGeometryRepresentation and
than override the member variable Decimator with your own LOD algorithm. You
will than need to change all objects to use your new representation, or
create a new view where this representation is used.

Subject: [Paraview] how does ScalarOpacityUnitDistance affect volume
	rendering?
Message-ID: <4E38321D.70701@sandia.gov>

I am working with volume rendering on a particular data set.  I am doing 
projected tetra volume mapping.  When I bring up the Color Scale Editor 
dialog (which I have used extensively), there is an entry called "Scale" 
that I haven't been able to find documentation to.  In playing with the 
python tracing, I see that it alters a value called 
ScalarOpacityUnitDistance.  The effect appears to be that setting this 
parameter to zero causes the rendering to be completely invisible (alpha 
zero everywhere, presumably) and setting it to 1 causes the rendering to 
be completely opaque.  I'm guessing it's some kind of multiplier to the 
opacity value in color transfer function, and possibly some kind of 
multiplier applying to how much each volume ray segment contributes to 
the overall opacity of a pixel.  What exactly is this scale value doing 
(so I can understand what I'm looking at)?

The correct expression for radiative transform defines light attenuation
per unit length.  The Scale value allows you to set what that unit length
is.  The larger the unit length, the further light has to travel to
attenuate the same amount.

Your description of the behavior seems backward.  If you set the unit
distance to 0, you should see full opacity.  It means that when light
travels 0 distance it's attenuated a finite amount.  Thus, any finite
distance should attenuate all light.  The larger you make the unit
distance, the more transparent the rendering should become.  This is the
behavior I get with disk_out_ref.  Are you sure you didn't get it
backwards?

Ken is right. 0 is full opacity and 1 is full transparency.

Note that 1 is not always full transparency.  You probably have an object with small spatial bounds so that 1 unit in space passes through the entire model and then much more.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter in parallel
Message-ID: <828867511.445022.1312377865905.JavaMail.root@mail2.gatech.edu>

Hi,

I know many of the built-in readers/filters already work in parallel, but how does one write a parallel programmable filter?

Our data files are XDMF and split into blocks of data. We have a single XDMF file that we can read that reads all the blocks and generates a vtkMultiBlockDataset (this works with the built in XDMF reader). 

However, each block has some ghost cells around it that are needed to do the CellDataToPointData interpolation. For large numbers of blocks, this creates far too many grid points for our machines to load. So, I've written a programmable filter that does:

start with empty vtkMultiBlockDataset
for each block in restart file
   read block file with XDMFReader
   CellDataToPointData
   strip off the extra layers of cells
   append to output vtkMultiBlockDataset

If I run this in parallel, what exactly is parallel? Is the reading and CD2PD done in parallel on each block? Is none of it parallel? Ideally, I would have the loop over blocks done in parallel, but I don't know how to indicate that in the programmable filter (if it's possible).

Any advice would be great,

Tim

Message-ID: <1706156810.450269.1312384155150.JavaMail.root@mail2.gatech.edu>

I guess I sort of answered my own question -- the entire script runs on each processor, so I ended up with 8 copies of my data in memory (or I would have, had I not filled the 12 GB of RAM and 20 GB of swap space and my system crashed). 

So is there some way to query the processor information? Probably something in the RequestInformation script -- find out how many processors there are and then the prog. filter determines based on processor ID and number of processors what section of the data to load. 

In that case, how does the aggregation of the data work? The exact pipeline is:

DataObjectGenerator("MB{}")
ProgrammableFilter

in serial, the PF appends blocks into the input and passes that through to the output. In parallel, that same pipeline would create a MB{} on each CPU that gets filled with that CPU's data, but at the end of this step I would want a single MB{} object, not NCPU MB{}'s. 

Hopefully that makes sense... I've never used PV in parallel, so I'm not sure how it all works.

I think I have solved the issue I was having just now. I could not pursue it for a while because of other job priorities and we were at the time still having a functioning system with ParaView v3.8.1. This is the reason of the late reply.

I have managed to have a working solution for the following constellation on my SLES10 64bits box:
+ gcc v4.5.1
+ OpenMPI v1.5.3
+ Qt v4.6.3
+ Python v2.7
+ Mesa v7.10.3
+ cmake v2.8.4

Mesa was compiled with following options:
./configure --with-x --build=x86_64-suse-linux --prefix=/data/CFD/develop/opt/MESA/Mesa-7.10.3 --disable-egl --enable-pic --disable-gallium --enable-static EXTRA_LIB_PATH="-L/usr/X11R6/lib64" --with-driver=xlib

The reason why I am not building the Mesa libs using the --with-driver=osmesa option, is that I want to be able to use X and not rely on the OGL HW implementation, but rather on OSMESA. This way, I can also require to use off-screen rendering for batch jobs through pvbatch or pvserver from the same compiled binaries with Mesa and have a graphical front-end for test purposes.

Until  now I have tried without success so far to make use of the shared Mesa libraries, ie. I still got a segmentation fault, no matter how I compiled the Mesa libraries on my system. Since the culprit was the libGL.so mismatch between system, Mesa own libGL.so and libOSMesa.so, I switched to static libraries which ultimately worked.

Here are my configuration variables:

OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR               /data/CFD/develop/opt/MESA/Mesa-7.10.3/include
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY                /data/CFD/develop/opt/MESA/Mesa-7.10.3/lib/libGL.a
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY               /data/CFD/develop/opt/MESA/Mesa-7.10.3/lib/libGLU.a
OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR         /data/CFD/develop/opt/MESA/Mesa-7.10.3/include
OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR               /data/CFD/develop/opt/MESA/Mesa-7.10.3/include
OSMESA_LIBRARY                   /data/CFD/develop/opt/MESA/Mesa-7.10.3/lib/libOSMesa.a
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN                OFF
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA            ON
VTK_USE_X                        ON

I am not sure that this procedure works 100%. I will keep you in touch in case I can manage another successful build on a different computer.

HTH.

Cheers,

Frank.

Nope, this is not possible through plugins yet. You can add a
brand-new dock widget through plugins but not add a new tab to the
Object Inspector widget.

Subject: [Paraview] Volume rendering crashbug:
	vtkVolumeRayCastSpaceLeapingImageFilterMinMaxExecute
Message-ID: <4E3AC4F8.1080703@illinois.edu>

Hi,
We've found that a very simple 10x10x10 volumetric dataset  causes 
paraview stable (3.10.1) to crash when the representation is changed to 
Volume.
We've reproduced this on Windows and Mac builds.

The crash is is in vtkVolumeRayCastSpaceLeapingImageFilterMinMaxExecute
      tmpPtrI = tmpPtrJ + sx1 * outInc0;
         for ( c = 0; c < nComponents; c++, tmpPtrI += 3 )
           {
           if ( independent )
             {
             val = static_cast<unsigned short>((*dptr + shift[c]) * 
scale[c]); <<<<< HERE

Regards,
Lawrence.
Here's the .vtk file. It's just a 10x10x10 image with a single point

Hi

I am new to ParaView. I want to visualize scalar data but I do not have
values of the scalar function at all the nodes. Can ParaView interpolate the
values at these nodes as well?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Stereo Rendering guts (non-cave) in ParaView...
Message-ID: <4E3B2A86.7090701@sandia.gov>

I am looking at some of the stereo rendering currently in ParaView 
(initially just by invoking the --stereo option at the command line).

I have quite a bit of experience with stereo rendering both as a user 
and as a developer, and I can immediately see some problems with the 
stereo rendering I'm getting using the --stereo option.  For example, 
objects at a far distance are not sufficiently far apart (objects at 
infinity would be projected on to the screen as far apart as the eyes, 
or almost so) and the left-eye/right-eye projections appear to be 
scaling linearly with the size of the rendering window (e.g. I make the 
rendering window twice as big and the left eye/right eye images become 
twice as far apart).

I'm wanting to do some significant digging here but the handling of the 
projection (both for a single eye and for stereo) is sufficiently 
complex that I don't have a good starting point.  I see that glFrustum 
is only used once in a test; gluPerspective is only used once in a demo; 
glOrtho is used several places but doesn't appear to be the general 
projection handling method.  I see glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION) used in 
the SetPixelData calls in vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, but it's not 
immediately clear what's going on there.  vtkCameraPass::Render() in 
vtkCameraPass.cxx is definitely doing projection stuff but I'm not 
immediately understanding it.

My question is this:  is there a good source for understanding the 
architecture of the camera handling and projection handling in 
ParaView?  If not, would it be possible to get a high level rundown that 
would let me understand the details of what is going on?  My experience 
has generally led me to believe that to get the best stereo you need to 
have a separate projection (GL_PROJECTION matrix) for each eye as well 
as a separate eye position (GL_MODELVIEW matrix) for each eye, and the 
projection for each eye needs to be off-axis.  And the projection needs 
to be parameterized by both an interpupilary distance and the physical 
size of the projection screen (i.e. rendering window).  Of course, it's 
possible to do all the matrix calculations (model view and projection) 
on the cpu side and stuff the resulting matrix into the OpenGL state 
however you like--I'm wondering if ParaView is doing this but I can't 
yet tell.  I think if I get a high-level understanding of the cameras 
and projection code as it is, I'll better understand how the projections 
are being handled.

Thanks for any help!

Dear Jeff,

I cannot really help you with your questions since i am not familiar 
with the Paraview source. However, your email sounds as if you are 
planning to - after understanding how stereo rendering is implemented in 
Paraview - include some improvements there. If you do so, i would like 
to propose some improvements that i was missing the last time i used 
stereo rendering (correct me if some of these things have already been 
implemented):

* none of the parameters of stereo projection (for example the eye 
distance) seem to be user adjustable
* for stereo-mode with two-color glasses, their color cannot be 
adjusted. Hence, you need glasses that fit to the paraview standard 
colors as well as the monitor's color space. This is very inconvenient - 
the possibility to give a color value for each eye would be very helpful.

Best Regards,

Mathias

Hi,

My first implementation is on Github:

https://github.com/bilke/pv_opensg_plugin

at Utkarsh: I am sorry my last mail: I used the development install of ParaView and the crashes came from a binary difference I think. Now I compiled ParaView from source and got rid of crashes.

The problem is that it never executes the WriteData()-method from my exporter. I also noticed that this method is not executed because the vtkSMRenderViewExporterProxy::Write()-method is also not executed. I assume that my exporter class itself is fine but the server manager configuration is missing something.

I turned on the debug output of my exporter (you see that the RenderWindow is never set and also the Write()-method is never executed). This is the output when trying to export as OpenSG:

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.10.1 - compile error w.r.t. MapReduceMPI
Message-ID: <4E3BDEED.30903@sara.nl>

Hi,

I'm building PV 3.8.1 and PV 3.10.1 on exactly the same Debian 6.0
system (64-bit) system using the exact same CMAKE configuration lines:

#!/bin/sh
cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DMANTA_BUILD=$HOME/c/manta-2439-build \
    -DMANTA_SOURCE=$HOME/c/manta-2439 \
    -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_Manta=ON \
    -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON \
    -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON \
    <source-dir>

The 3.8.1 build succeeds, but the 3.10.1 buid fails because mpi.h is not
being found:

The relevant CMAKE MPI variables seem to be set correctly:

The MPI related cache variables seem to be almost the same between 3.8
and 3.10, and in the differences I see nothing related to missing
include paths or something like that:

Any clues?

Hi Paul,

Have you turned MPI On then Off and then back On again? I've seen it get
confused when this happens. Can you try a fresh (delete your build tree)
build of 3.10.1 and turn everything on at once?

What's your CMakeLists. txt file? Was vtkMyRepresentation specified as
SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES in the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN call?

Try to locate vtkMyRepresentationClientServer.cxx file in the binary
directory. Was that generated? Open and see if it include a condition
for "SetSomeBoolVar" in it.

Hi David,

Tried that, doesn't help, unfortunately

A fresh build in a clean build directory (together with the cmake line
below) doesn't solve the problem. Note that I'm not setting the openmpi
header/library locations directly, but let CMake detect them. I assume
that's not a problem?

Hi,

I just noticed my cmake is 2.8.2, would trying the latest version help here?

Hi,

I have seen this problem before you need to fix the MPI_INCLUDE_PATH to only
point to the directory that has mpi.h not both of those directories. If this
fixes the problem you should open a bug on
http://paraview.org/Bug<http://paraview.org/Bug/my_view_page.php>

The fact that "SetSomeBoolVar" is not in the *CLientServer.cxx file is
the problem. It has nothing to do with the XML, but for some reason
the parser that generates the CLientServer.cxx file decided that the
method is not "wrappable". If you can attach the header file, I may be
able to tell what the issue may be.

With cmake 2.8.5 I get the following warning more than once during cmake
configure:

CMake Warning (dev) at

  This may cause errors later on .

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

Furthermore, the mpi.h not found error is still there ... :-/

Subject: [Paraview] Diffusivity and Specular Properties
Message-ID: <4E3C4F28.5080702@gmail.com>

I'm interested in using paraview as a replacement for tecplot. I can 
reproduce almost everything except that tecplot seems to be using 
different diffusivity/specular properties as their material is slightly 
shinier and more reflective than the default paraview material. Is there 
any way to access these properties via python or through the Object 
Inspector>Display>Style>Material settings?

I'm using Paraview 3.10.0 on linux 64-bit for reference.

Thanks

If you scroll down the Display panel further, you will see a "Lighting"

Message-ID: <CAJjzU-SLmCTp7SXAKKyAjXjR=3ASFm15uKgSg4T=M+mUYLVuoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to display the ID numbers of my bodies.  They are saved
as a Point Data as follows from vtkUnstructuredGridWriter.  Is there a
way to display the IDs as texts using Paraview?  I've been trying out
different Filters for hours but am unsuccessful.

vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray> spheresId =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray>::New();
	spheresId->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
	spheresId->SetName("id");
vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid> spheresUg =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid>::New();

FOR EVERY BODY:
spheresUg->SetPoints(spheresPos);
spheresUg->SetCells(VTK_VERTEX, spheresCells);
spheresId->InsertNextValue(b->getId());
spheresUg->GetPointData()->AddArray(spheresId);
END FOR

vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter> writer =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter>::New();
string fn=fileName+"spheres."+lexical_cast<string>(scene->iter)+".vtu";
writer->SetFileName(fn.c_str());
writer->SetInput(spheresUg);
writer->Write();


Yours faithfully,

Indeed, adjusting MPI_INCLUDE_PATH fixes the build.

Message-ID: <CAN_ffbiJ_9BWL7tuJVwtRXiuzjR8F6OWW+VKzFxNa=b=70bP5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello paraviewers,

According to the information I found here
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Batch_Processing (bottom page)
it should be able to Load a state file and then to change the file name to
apply the same state on  multi files (for making an animation for instance)

sm=servermanager
sm.Connect()

sm.LoadState(opt.statefile)
view=GetRenderViews()[0]
cnt=0
for time in timesteps:
   ts=[]
   ts.append(filelist[cnt])
   reader.FileNames = ts
   reader.FileNameChanged()
   reader.UpdatePipeline()

  format="%%s/%%s/%%s/%%s_t%s%%s" % (opt.timeformat)
  jpgfile=format %
(path,opt.casedir,opt.outputdir,opt.imbase,float(time),jpgext)
  view.ResetCamera()
  view.StillRender()
  view.WriteImage(jpgfile,"vtkPNGWriter",1)
  cnt=cnt+1

However, the scrips keeps showing only the data associate with the first
file in the state file. If I print the properties of the reader with
 for i in dir(reader):
      print "reader.%s = %s" % (i,getattr(reader,i))
I can see that in the reader object the filename indeed has change, but the
change are not reflected to the newly rendered image. I seems that
UpdatePipe() does not work.
Does anybody sees what goes wrong and how I can fix this ?

Many thanks

Regards

Eelco

Dear Paraviewers,


When I try to open two XDMF files (all data stored as heavy data in HDF5 file) having 2 different domains (I also tried giving them the same name) paraview crashes when opening the second file.
Is is not possible to open two different XDMF files at the same time ?

Thank you.

Message-ID: <4DD151198E92734A971393BDC103C8FC0BEE3BDF@trip.uni.lux>

Just wanted to add some explanation to my previous post.
I'm working with XDMF in Paraview and would like to load two different XDMF files so I can have a different   glyph filter per data/file ("Change Input ..." in pipeline browser)
Unfortunately paraview crashes when I try to open a second xmf file (both files are correctly read when loaded one at a time). Is this a bug or are there any reasons one cannot load multiple xmf files ? Are there any restrictions concerning temporal or spatial collections ?
Could anyone point me towards a potential solution for my problem:
I would like to apply different glyph filters for different groups of particle data, thus showing different shapes (for example one group being of shape sphere whilst the other one having cylindrical shape )  ?

Thank you very much for your help.

Best regards,

Sounds like a bug to me. Please file a bug report on the bug tracker
and if possible point us to a small dataset and procedure that we can
replicate the bug with.

Also, you might try working around the bug in the meantime by making a
copy of the data files on the filesystem. For the hdf5 file, a
symbolic link should suffice. For the xdmf file you will need to copy
and then adjust the name of the hdf5 file it points to.

That's odd. What type of reader is this? It's possible that the reader
has issues with changing the filename once it's set or something like
that.

Note that current versions (3.10.* and earlier) of ParaView disable
specular highlights once scalar coloring is employed. However in
upcoming versions a setting has been added to the "Settings" dialog
that overrides this behavior allowing specular highlights when using
scalar coloring.

Hi,

I thought it would be useful to post /archive the following runtime QT 
strangeness in case others run into a similar issue.

We initially built MacOSX (10.5.8) Paraview 3.10.1 with QT 4.6.3. 
Strangely this Paraview did not correctly support a simple paraview 
plugin that added two items to a new menu - the second menu item, 
"About" never showed up:

MenuActions::MenuActions(QObject* p) : QActionGroup(p)
{
   QIcon icon = qApp->style()->standardIcon(QStyle::SP_MessageBoxCritical);

   QAction * Import = new QAction(icon, "Import", this);
   QAction * About = new QAction(icon, "About", this);

   this->addAction(Import);
   this->addAction(About);
}

(We first noticed the problem in a much larger plugin we'd built and the 
second menu item would not show up if it's character string was 
different from the first menu item! - We presumed we were trashing the 
memory until we built a simple plugin demo. Test files MenuActions.h,cxx 
and makefile available upon request.)

Downloading, compiling and installing a later version of QT (4.7.3), 
rebuilding the Paraview, then rebuilding the plugin to use the new 
Paraview build fixed the problem. Sorry I do not have time to 
debug/explore this further.

Regards,
Lawrence.

2 xmf files:

Hi Utkarsh,

I am using the LegacyVTKReader. Looking at the reader properties I see that
indeed the new filename is in the reader object, but still the first file as
defined in the state file is used for plotting.

Subject: [Paraview]  Visualizing rotating sphere
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1Wg0MMaON=p-KmRzm0Lp=X7DP8WyugJrSdyEWo7Ce+DLjg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I apologize in advance if this is an extremely simple question for you but I
have not been able to find solution to the following: I am simulating a
system of spheres interacting with each other. I am printing their
information into a vtk-xml file as points with both scalar (mass, radius,
number of contacts, etc) and vectorial (Position, Velocity, etc) attributes.
I am using the sphere glyph to visualize the actual sphere, scaling
them appropriately by radius. At the end of each simulation I have a time
series described into a .pvd file which names and associate time to the
individual vtk-xml file. The previous allows me to make animations of my
system (one of the several ways to go, o course). I am representing the
glyph as a Surface with Edges, in order to track rotations.

What I want to know is how can I represent my spheres correctly into
paraview in order to show clearly their rotation. Let's assume the following
simple example. The vertical axis is z. The particle is rotating with
angular velocity along that axis. If I orient the glyph using the angular
velocity, the glyph will orient along the z axis but then it wont rotate. I
am very likely forgetting something useful in Paraview for this problem, so
I really would like to know your suggestions.

Thanks in advance.

Awesome. There have been some fairly recent changes in stereo-rendering in
the recent past and any any feedback or suggestions for improvement will
be greatly appreciated. The person who will best be able to help you is on
vacation till next week but I'll try to help to the best of my knowledge.

Following some of these methods that may make the logic clear

vtkRenderWindow::DoStereoRender(); (sets LeftEye 1 or 0)
vtkOpenGLCamera::Render(); (calls  vtkCamera::ComputeProjectionTransform();
which calls  + vtkCamera::ComputeViewTransform())
vtkCamera::ComputeOffAxisProjectionFrustum(); (called from
vtkCamer::ComputeProjectionTransform() uses the LeftEye value for computing
projection matrix)

Unfortunately there is no such document which gives the high level rundown.
However I think the current implementation does all of what you need and you
will find methods to do that in vtkCamera (see
VTK/Rendering/Testing/Cxx/TestOffAxisStereo.cxx). Unfortunately Paraview
does not use this stereo by default and this is currently used for the CAVE
support in PV.

On the contrary, that question does not sound simple at all.

So, I am assuming that you are representing the rotation of the particles by the angular velocity vector, which is pointing along the axis of rotation and whose magnitude is proportional to the speed of the rotation.  To my knowledge, there is no mechanism to convert that to rotational transformations on glyphs that change over time, and implementing it sounds painful.

If you're open to suggestion, you might consider a more static representation with a less symmetrical glyph that better represents the angular moment of the particles.  You could use either an arrow in the direction of the angular velocity or a disk in the plane of rotation (perpendicular to the angular velocity vector) or, better yet, both.  Both can be done with the glyph filter using the arrow and cylinder glyphs, respectively.  I've attached a screenshot demonstrating the idea.

Subject: [Paraview] Good/Possible/Bad idea? Use Camera matrix to Exaggerate
	Z Scale
Message-ID: <4E402652.2050604@illinois.edu>

Hi,

We're using Paraview to display data which is very thin in the Z 
direction compare to X,Y size. We'd like to artificially exaggerate the 
display in the Z direction.

One tedious way to do this is to set the scale matrix for every object.
e.g. Scale the Z coordinates by 30.

An alternative approach would be to set a camera transform to include a 
scaling in the world coordinate system, e.g. (1,1,30). Is this 
configurable in the Paraview GUI / settable via python/ or even possible 
without artefacts and unwanted side-effects?

Thanks in advance,

Lawrence.

Brian,

There are a few things to remember about ParaView:
* the source/filter and it's representation proxy are created
separately. The representation is generally not created until after
the first accept.
* a source can have multiple representation proxies (one for each
view). As view are split/closed/visibility changed, these
representation can get created/deleted dynamically. pqPipelineSource
fires signals (representationAdded / representationRemoved) when that
happens.
* there is at most one active view at one time. Sicne there's one
representation proxy per source per view, you'll see that the display
tab is refreshed as one changes the active view.

Now based on this, you need to decide how your panel is going to behave:
* Does it affect all representations in all views, or does it behave
like the display-tab and affect only the active view.
* When the source if first created, it's not going to have any
representations, how do you want the panel to behave in that case. One
possibility is that the checkbox-value is saved and then when
represenation is added, you change the property based on the value of
the checkbox.

If you don't mind elaborating on the use-case that you're trying to
solve, I can hack the plugin you sent me to behave accordingly.

My plugin would act like the display tab and affect the active view. For the
case when the source is created I guess it could just be saved. In general,
the representation options just affect how the data actually looks (size,
color, and things like toggles for labels and bar scales).

However in this case would I not just be storing it in the vtkMultiBlockSet
and reading it out when I load the Representation? In that case I can just
have all the widgets on the panel be part of the reader. The reason I was
trying to avoid this is that I am making a time based plugin which will be
calling the readers Request Data very often, thus I was hoping to avoid
copying the data as often.

An example would be great if there is another way.

Thanks,
Brian

Subject: [Paraview] Extract Subset filter, strange behavior
Message-ID: <4E40F7BD.3050700@sara.nl>

Hi all,

I have an image dataset A (1137x716x834) that was created using the
Extract Subset filter from a larger dataset. It is stored in a .pvti +
8*.vti files. The extents of A are

  X: 514-1650 (dim 1137), Y: 455-1170 (dim 716), Z: 0:833 (dim 834)

I want to create a subsampled version of A by once again using the
Extract Subset filter, with as VOI the full extents above and setting
its sample rates to 2. But to my surprise the subsampled dataset (using
PV 3.10.1 in standalone mode, btw) ends up having extents

  X: 514-825 (312), Y: 455-584 (130), Z: 0-416 (417)

and covers only the upper portion of A, not the whole set. I also don't
understand where the weird reduction in X and Y dimensions comes from
(factors 3.6 and 5.5, resp). See the attached screenshots.

Could this be related to the input dataset being stored in parallel format?

Best regards,
Paul

Dear all,

is there a way to import ansys results in paraview? Apparently the
.rst file format in paraview does not correspond to the one in ansys.
If it is not compatible, do you know where to find an available
converter?

Thanks a lot

Hi,

Does anyone have any example view plugins?  I am struggling to know where to
start with a new 3D view with a different representation.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Hi,

The prism plugin has a custom view and representation. You can also look at
the GUIView example too.

Yes, your suggestions seems very useful, since the arrows (and discs) can be
scaled by the magnitude of the angular velocity. Thanks!

Message-ID: <1312904398.90814.YahooMailNeo@web36505.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have recently become interested in comparing different time steps using the windblade reader. ?One approach involves a 3D comparative view. ?After loading my .wind data set, I created a 2X1 Comparative View. In the Comparative View Inspector, I clicked the "+" symbol when "Time" was selected. ?I can view the Field portion without problems in either view (with different timesteps for each view), but when I select Blade, the first view renders it correctly while the second view renders a surface around the data set. When I select Ground, the first view renders the item correctly while the second renders the data set's outline. ?I wonder if Comparative view has issues with multiple ports. Any ideas?

Thank you,
Sohail

Ah, it's possible that the view has issues with multiple output ports,
I don't think I ever verified that. I forget, is there any small
dataset I can test this with already in ParaView (or where can I get
it) ?

The problem is indeed in the reader. I've attached  a patch for the
issue. It will be committed into git-master soon.

dataset I can test this with already in ParaView (or where can I get
it) ?

Yes, it's in <VTKLargeData>/Data/WindBladeReader. Select the test1_topo.wind
file.

I forgot to mention that that one only has 2 time steps.  I have a sample
one with 4 time steps too if you need it.

Hi Utkarsh,

This is excellent! I have been putting quite some time in a work around, but
is was making things complicated, so I hope this patch helps.

If I find a bug, does it mean that I can put it to this
paraview.org/Bugside? Because I have two more bugs (at least, that's
what I suspect)
:
1) pythonCalculator does not work in parallel (with mpirun) (I gave a larger
post on this proplem two weeks ago)

2) When running with pvbatch --offscreen-rendering option, it seems that
when looping over a large set of time steps, the memory is not released when
reading time step using the same LegacyVTKReader, even when the Delete is
called on the data object. And even with a del <variable name> (I found on
one of the paraview sites that this actually should free the memory.)
Especially for a large set of time steps this becomes  a problem because my
computer runs out of memory. If I run the same script without
--offscreen-rendering option the problem does not occur, but in that way you
can not submit the script to a cluster.

Would it help if I send the bugs with an example to the Mantis side?

Again many thanks for your patch!

Regards

Eelco

Florian,

I could not reproduce the issue with 3.10.1 or the latest ParaView
build from git-master on linux. Has anyone else been able to reproduce
this on Windows?

Hi Utkarsh,

Sorry for the inconvenience. I had the 3.10.0 version still around  but with version 3.10.1 everything is fine. Already added a note to the bug report.

Hello everyone,
I need to visualize Toughreact (an extension of Tough2) results with paraview. Anyone had a shot at it?
I think that I need to convert these files to tecplot format for it to be readable by paraview. Anyone had to do this? Any information will be appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview]  Displaying a CSV file from python
Message-ID: <CAP5QFJm92vg3ZLA2DwAvZm5VEv3153+dF8+A6JnATTKGFMMNNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've very recently started using Paraview for displaying some rather
simple data from a CSV file.

It is working well from inside Paraview itself but when I try to do it
from a python script (with pvpython), I get a blank window.

My reproducer is: (copied by hand, so there might be small typos)

  from paraview.simple import *
  import time

  view = CreateXYPlotView()

  reader = CSVReader(FileName="foo.csv", DetectNumericColumns=1,
MergeConsecutiveDelimiters=0, FieldDelimiterCharacters=',',
UseStringDelimiter=0, HaveHeaders=0)

  PlotData()
  Show()
  Render()
  time.sleep(3) # I actually use interactors from vtk and move/zoom
with the mouse


foo.csv is:
  900, 1024
  671, 0123
  567, 0410


It might be something very simple (and probably is) because I'm only
starting with VTK and Paraview (meaning I might have missed or
misunderstood something in the documentation for instance).


Thanks,

Adrien Nader

Eelco,

Yes, it would be great if you can report these issues with examples on
how to reproduce them on mantis. That way it's easier to track the
issues and also ensures that things don't get lost.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualize step attributes for H5PART (HDF5)
Message-ID: <op.vzz2nfhxm78f4o@euler>

Hi all,

I am using the H5PART library to write my SPH data. Now besides particle  
values like pressure I also have one step attribute (which is the physical  
time). My question is quite simple, how can I extract this data in  
ParaView? Ideally I would use it in a similar fashion as the annotate time  
filter. Unfortunately I couldn't find any instruction by searching the web.

Thanks in advance,
Arno

Hello all

I am trying to build the ParaViewWeb framework using the wiki: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Building

Using the instruction under the section 'Configuration and building' in the above wiki, I am unable to compile PWServer. 

My ccmake parameters are given below, but I'm given an error when I try to make.

What am I doing wrong here? Apache are not hosting version 3.1.x, so I could not download this version of the source as the wiki suggests.

If I need activemq-cpp-3.1.x could someone suggest where I can download the source?

Thanks
Max

Hi Max,

there is two things happening here.

The first one is related to an API change in ActiveMQ-cpp which induce
this compilation issue. Although it happen that I was working on that
part lately and managed to use activemq-cpp 3.4 on a linux machine. To
do so, you will need to edit the ParaViewWeb source code. I've paste
the small diff at the end of that mail.

The second issue is related to the ParaView version that you are
using. Before getting further, you should either use 3.10.1 or
git/master. But depending on the version, you have to checkout a given
tag on the ParaViewWeb git repository.

Hope this help,

Seb

Hi Seb

Thanks for the swift reply. I now have PWServer compiled using activemq-cpp 3.4.0, all tests were passed and it is now installed :)

Hi Max,

Great ! Did you managed to deploy and test the sample applications yourself ?
Just to my knowledge how did you install activemq-cpp ? Did you used
your system package system or you build it from the source ?

Thanks for your feedback,

Seb

This a pretty easy question. Can paraview plot data in polar coordinates or
do they have to be translated into cartesian?

Hi Max,

the wiki might be confusing, but each time the CMake step are similar
in the sense that the wiki highlight each property setting needed for
each individual component of ParaViewWeb, but as you might want to
build the "full" ParaViewWeb, you should setup everything at once. No
need to stop/start CMake as many time as ParaViewWeb has components.

You have to translate them.

If the data is unstructured you can use the calculator filter to do
this by typing in the appropriate function of the coordinates. Of
course the python programmable filter comes in handy too.

Does anyone know the answer to Tony's question?  In summary, how do you write a time series of csv files?

Hi Kenneth,

I took the Paraview training with you a couple of weeks ago in Denver. I have gotten many of the things working but I am still having trouble with one minor detail. I am writing a batch script to do post-processing without having to open paraview GUI but I found a bug on the trace tool. It will not show the commands for saving data as .csv from the ?Plot Over Line? filter. I found on the wiki how to do this by:

writer=CreateWriter("myFile.csv",PlotOverLine1)
writer.FieldAssociation = "Points"
writer.UpdatePipeline()
del writer

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Exporting_CSV_Data

Now this will only save my data for the first time step. I am interested in saving the data from the latest time step, or all time steps. If I try

Writer.WriteAllTimeSteps = 1

I will get the following error:

In /home/kgruchal/scratch/ParaView-3.10.1/Servers/Filters/vtkCSVWriter.cxx, line 80
vtkCSVWriter (0x2aab60975680): Unable to open file: /myFile.0.csv

How can I specify a time step to save the data?

I don?t know if you would know the answer for this or could point me in the right direction.

Thanks,

Luis (Tony) Martinez

ParaView tries to do no aggregation other than rendering onto the same
screen. Each processor is told what portion it is responsible for via
the UPDATE_EXTENT or UPDATE_PIECE/UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES keys and are
supposed to only produce what it is asked for. (See
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_ParaView_Readers for more of the
story.)

Filters that need cross communication to work properly (beyond what
they can get from ghost cells) do so by accessing the
vtkMultiProcessController that connects all of the nodes in the server
(or sometimes via MPI directly but that isn't recommended).

Try the following for two means of getting a hold of the interprocess links.
import paraview.vtk.parallel
#print(dir(paraview.vtk.parallel))
#print(dir(paraview.vtk.parallel.vtkMultiProcessController))
controller = paraview.vtk.parallel.vtkMultiProcessController.GetGlobalController()
print controller.GetLocalProcessId()
print controller.GetNumberOfProcesses()

from mpi4py import MPI
#print(dir(MPI))
#print(help(MPI))
print MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
print MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size()

Note also that there is a "feature" in the python programmable filter
that comes into play with structured data. That feature says that
structured data is not split at all by default. If you want structured
data to actually be parallel you need to put this code in your python
programmable filter.

Can you try specifying the full path for the file? The following works
for me without any issues with development ParaView, but I think it
shouldn't have any issues with 3.10.1 as well.

writer=CreateWriter("/tmp/myFile.csv",PlotOverLine1)
writer.FieldAssociation = "Points"
writer.WriteAllTimeSteps = 1
writer.UpdatePipeline()

Utkarsh,

I have tested your patch and it seems to fix the problem, so updating the
time steps is now possible.

I have reported the pythoncalculator bug on Mantis.

The other bug, about the memory of object not being released if they are
removed, even if Delete of del is used is more anoying, as it prevents to
process long time series without a crash due to a memory overflow. I see
however that the bug has already been reported on Mantis:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/bug_relationship_graph.php?bug_id=12424&graph=relation

Hopefully the bugs are easy to fix as well.

Well, thanks again for the patch!

Regards

Eelco

David,

Thanks for your response. It's much clearer how it all works, but I'm still unsure how it fits together.

I don't actually need to know the interprocess links -- I have a list of blocks to read and that list needs to be split over the processors. So each processor needs to identify itself and the total number of procs, but that's all. So I can definitely do that with the mpi4py, I was unaware that would work inside the filter and I didn't know the paraview.vtk.parallel existed.

I'm not actually splitting the structured data; I'm splitting the vtkMultiBlockDataSet. So each processor is responsible for populating a portion of the dataset. For instance, in serial when the file (say, with 8 blocks) is read, we end up with one vtkMultiBlockDataset with 8 vtkStructuredData's inside it. If I have a parallel reader (with 8 processes), I have a hunch I'll end up with 8 vtkMultiBlockDataSet's with one vtkStructuredData under each. Is this correct? Will this cause problems for other filters downstream? If for fun, I wanted to merge it such that each processor still only retains it's block, but they share a common parent vtkMultiBlockDataset, is that possible?

I appreciate your help with this. Maybe these are stupid questions answered somewhere else, but I can't seem to find them!

Tim

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 3.11.1 segfaults in animation because out of

  Hi

  I'm trying to do an animation using paraview of several timesteps using 
the ensight format.

  Paraview seems to be increasing memory use with each timestep until it 
reachs the machine limit and blows up.

  I think memory use should be kept the same and arrays re-used no?

  feedback, opinions?

You should end up with one multiblock dataset on each processor, all
of those should have eight children. On any given processor 7 of those
children will be NULL and the remaining one will be unique to that
processor. Use UPDATE_PIECE and possibly localprocessid to figure out
which of the eight children the processor should fill in. The rest of
the vtkCompositeDataPipeline that ParaView uses expects and knows how
to handle that structure and filters downstream should have no problem
handling it.

And no these aren't stupid questions. They are described fairly well
in the most recent kitware books and courses but otherwise the
information is widely scattered around the paraview wiki, kitware
source magazine and the mailing list archives.

For instance, in serial when the file (say, with 8 blocks) is read, we end up with one vtkMultiBlockDataset with 8 vtkStructuredData's inside it. If I have a parallel reader (with 8 processes), I have a hunch I'll end up with 8 vtkMultiBlockDataSet's with one vtkStructuredData under each. Is this correct? Will this cause problems for other filters downstream? If for fun, I wanted to merge it such that each processor still only retains it's block, but they share a common parent vtkMultiBlockDataset, is that possible?

Hi,

Do you have animation caching enabled?  you can check under
edit->settings->Animation.

Also what version of ParaView are you using? A memory leak in animation
playback was fixed in the 3.10.1 release.

Specifically, what filename did you give to the CreateWriter function?
Did you give "myFile.csv" as in your example?  If so, try a full path as
Utkarsh accepted.  Did you give "/myFile.csv", and if so, do you have
write access to your root directory?  Did you give something like
"/tmp/myFile.csv" and it still tried to write to "/myFile.0.csv"?

Subject: [Paraview] Good/Possible/Bad idea? Use Camera matrix to
 Exaggerate Z Scale
In-Reply-To: <4E402652.2050604@illinois.edu>
References: <4E402652.2050604@illinois.edu>
Message-ID: <7TOb-GBFZXR6kmdDAy4oihV8KyPkFBlNJkhMql-a-ZxKha1kJIwBRg@cipher.nrlssc.navy.mil>

We see a similar thing in ocean/atmospheric data.  X & Y is in a 
different coordinate system than Z (e.g., lon/lat degrees vs. meters 
respectively), and thus must be scaled to be viewed properly.

My solution is to use the Transform Filter when possible to scale the Z 
axis.  The advantage is that you don't have to set the scale matrix for 
every actor; the transformed coordinates are passed to every downstream 
filter.  The disadvantage is that the true coordinates are no longer 
available if needed, for example, if you turn on axis labeling, or do 
computations that require the true coordinates.

Also, in some cases, the Transform filter is not available, for 
rectilinear data, for example.  I use a Programmable filter for those 
cases, but the above issues still apply.

IMO, for ocean/atmospheric data, it would be handy to support separate 
display and computation coordinates.  It sounds like your data would 
have the same requirement.  One way would be some process/filter that 
modifies all downstream actors.  In any case, I can't think of a way to 
do it that isn't time consuming, and I've given it a good bit of 
thought.  If someone else has a better idea, I'd be all ears.

Thanks,
Sean

Did you properly set the working directory in the CMake configuration.
If so, just try to delete the database by removing the database
directory in the  working directory that you set in CMake.

Hi,

I've been wondering: would it be possible to take an unstructured grid using existing filters and make it into structured? ?Here's why: I compute an iso-surface for a data set (resulting surface is unstructured subset of original structured data set), which needs to be compared against the cells of the original structured grid. ?Specifically, I need to find out which cells of the original data set border the iso-surface, and which are inside. ?All filters that do appending/combination of the contour and original (structured) data set create unstructured grids.

In general, no.  It is not possible to convert an unstructured grid to a structured grid because there are structures representable with unstructured grids that are non-representable with structured grids.

For your question, it would be much easier to get the information you want by just looking at the scalar value on the original structured grid.  You don't need to look at the isosurface.  For example, all cells "inside" the isosurface will have all scalar values either above or below the isovalue (depending on the orientation of the surface).  Bordering cells have scalar values both above and below the isovalue.

In addition, is it possible to have the panel determine which representation is up? The options I am adding really only affect the representation that is part of the plugin. Thus, I could disable them when a different representation is up.

My plugin would act like the display tab and affect the active view. For the case when the source is created I guess it could just be saved. In general, the representation options just affect how the data actually looks (size, color, and things like toggles for labels and bar scales).

However in this case would I not just be storing it in the vtkMultiBlockSet and reading it out when I load the Representation? In that case I can just have all the widgets on the panel be part of the reader. The reason I was trying to avoid this is that I am making a time based plugin which will be calling the readers Request Data very often, thus I was hoping to avoid copying the data as often.

An example would be great if there is another way.

Thanks,
Brian

Brian,

There are a few things to remember about ParaView:
* the source/filter and it's representation proxy are created
separately. The representation is generally not created until after
the first accept.
* a source can have multiple representation proxies (one for each
view). As view are split/closed/visibility changed, these
representation can get created/deleted dynamically. pqPipelineSource
fires signals (representationAdded / representationRemoved) when that
happens.
* there is at most one active view at one time. Sicne there's one
representation proxy per source per view, you'll see that the display
tab is refreshed as one changes the active view.

Now based on this, you need to decide how your panel is going to behave:
* Does it affect all representations in all views, or does it behave
like the display-tab and affect only the active view.
* When the source if first created, it's not going to have any
representations, how do you want the panel to behave in that case. One
possibility is that the checkbox-value is saved and then when
represenation is added, you change the property based on the value of
the checkbox.

If you don't mind elaborating on the use-case that you're trying to
solve, I can hack the plugin you sent me to behave accordingly.

Hi,

I'm still struggling with this.  I've tried to create a copy of the ParaView
2D view as a plugin (appending a 2 to all names).  It all compiles but
segfaults in pqTwoDRenderView2::initializeWidgets() as the
vtkSMTwoDRenderViewProxy2 is a null pointer.  I've attached the code for the
plugin in case anyone can take a look at it.  I'd appreciate any help here.

Thanks in advance,
Paul
BTW I'm using the git master branch

One more point: I've tried putting a breakpoint in vtkSMTwoDRenderViewProxy2
constructor but it doesn't get called.  Where should this be created?

Thanks,

Thanks. ?I had a hunch ?that this was the answer. ?In my case, the surface would represent values that smaller than the requested iso-value, so inner cells would be below, while bordering cells would have points that are equal to and above.

I needed to do the conversion because the paper specifically makes use of the iso-surface boundary in 3D space. ?I suppose I could have a multi-block data set with two data sets (using Group data sets): one unstructured (contour) and another structured (original). ?I could find out where the points of the iso-surface exist in the structured grid, although that part will take some thought.

In general, no. ?It is not possible to convert an unstructured grid to a structured grid because there are structures representable with unstructured grids that are non-representable with structured grids.

For your question, it would be much easier to get the information you want by just looking at the scalar value on the original structured grid. ?You don't need to look at the isosurface. ?For example, all cells "inside" the isosurface will have all scalar values either above or below the isovalue (depending on the orientation of the surface). ?Bordering cells have scalar values both above and below the isovalue.

I appear to be running into the same problem with my programmable 
filter.  Since the Transform filter cannot scale rectilinear data, I 
wrote the following programmable filter to do it:

zscale = 0.001
pdi = self.GetInput()
pdo = self.GetOutput()
pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)
zsi = pdi.GetZCoordinates()
zso = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
zso.DeepCopy(zsi)
zss = zso.GetSize()
for i in xrange(zss):
   zso.SetValue(i, zsi.GetValue(i)*zscale)
pdo.SetZCoordinates(zso)

Obviously, I need to update it to use the newer input/output names and 
numpy arrays for speed, but it does work in serial.  However, it appears 
to duplicate every point on every processor in parallel.  I've been 
poring over the docs and experimenting, but I've yet to find a way to 
use UPDATE_EXTENT properly in parallel with rectilinear data.  Any ideas?

Thanks,
Sean

For instance, in serial when the file (say, with 8 blocks) is read, we end up with one vtkMultiBlockDataset with 8 vtkStructuredData's inside it. If I have a parallel reader (with 8 processes), I have a hunch I'll end up with 8 vtkMultiBlockDataSet's with one vtkStructuredData under each. Is this correct? Will this cause problems for other filters downstream? If for fun, I wanted to merge it such that each processor still only retains it's block, but they share a common parent vtkMultiBlockDataset, is that possible?

Ah, I see what I was doing wrong. It was using the xml tag name when looking
for the vtkSM proxy. I've put in the correct name and it's working now.

Sorry about all the posts!

Howdy Sean,

When you set the extent translator does each processor not get a
different update extent?

Hi:

I need to edit the axes location and orientation on a.vtp file. I have tried with Filter > Transform and it looks just fine; the problem is how to save it as a new vtp file. I have tried Save Data but when I open the new file none of the modifications are shown (the fie is identical to the original). Can anyone help me on this?

Thanks?

ram available.

Is this a 64 bit version of paraview? Is there another process taking up all
the ram on the machine?  The error clearly states that paraview can not
allocate the required amount of memory.

Hi, Mike,

Thanks a lot for the fast response!

My computer has 8 gb of ram and I am using Opensuse 11.4 64 bit OS.  I
suspect that ram is not the issue.  Actually, on the same computer, when I
dual-boot to MS Windows, and used the paraview-3.10, there was no problem.

Is it possible that I am not using the correct qt version?  Which qt version
should I use?

Best regards,

pei

Are you sure you saved the output of the transform filter instead of
the output of the reader? Click in the pipeline browser and save on
one and then the other then compare the two files to be sure.

Subject: [Paraview] Xdmf data duplication
Message-ID: <4E492A7E.1060301@sara.nl>

Hi,

With a dataset stored in Xdmf I get an interesing data duplication
result. The set consists of 55296 points, each with associated scalar
and vector values. See below for the XML file and HDF5 layout.

It loads fine when running PV standalone. But when loading this set on a
parallel PV server (running on N nodes), the number of cells in the
loaded datasets ends up being N, and the number of points becomes N *
55296. Looking at the Scalar Process Id values it seems the set is
indeed duplicated on all render nodes.

Is the use of Xdmf not supported for parallel PV?
This happens with both PV 3.8.1 and 3.10.1, btw.

Best regards,
Paul

Hmmm, I seem to have the Topology tag not completely correct,
"NodesPerElement" should be "NumberOfElements". With that correction I
get at least the same number of cells as number of points. This makes me
wonder about the other attributes I used in the .xmf file.
The data duplication issue remains, though.

David,
Well, if I don't set the extent translator, it obviously duplicates all 
the points by p (where p=# of processes).  However, the Z extents get 
updated to the new scaled z points.

If I do set the extent translator, it fixes the duplication, but the Z 
extents do not get updated.

I've tried other variations on the script, including (1) removing the 
ShallowCopy(), (2) removing the DeepCopy() & replacing SetValue() with 
InsertValue(), and (3) enabling Copy Arrays.

I also tried replacing the SetValue() with numpy operations instead but 
numpy doesn't appear to completely work in 3.10.1 (I saw a post about 
that from a while ago).

Thanks,
Sean

That sounds like a bug. Can you share the dataset? I can send you an
url you can use to upload the dataset directly to us.

I have not updated ParaView in a while. I followed the instructions here:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Git/Download

and did a 'git pull origin master' followed by a 'git submodule
update'. However, when I then configure, I get:

 CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewCommon.cmake:520 (ADD_SUBDIRECTORY):
   The source directory

     /home/doriad/src/ParaView/Utilities/protobuf

   does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.

I'm assuming this is because when I first cloned ParaView the protobuf
submodule did not exist? Should an extra command be added to that wiki
page so that new submodules are found?

Thanks,

David

git submodule init

That needs to happen to tell update that there is a new module to
grab. Once called it doesn't have to be called again unless another
submodule is added.

Or, you can do it in one step (and alias it back to git submodule update, if you would really like to):

git submodule update --init

This will update all modules and init any that are new.

git submodule init

That needs to happen to tell update that there is a new module to
grab. Once called it doesn't have to be called again unless another
submodule is added.

Sure, I have a simplified dataset for you showing the problem. It also
shows a crasher bug (load dataset, add process id scalars filter, add
histogram -> crash)

Message-ID: <1313487301.28215.19.camel@saunton>

Dear ParaViewers,

Does anyone know a good way to retrieve the pipeline name for a filter
within the filter code? For example if I have a plugin filter that comes
up as "myfilter" in the pipeline and is applied several times, how can I
retrieve the appropriate name in the RequestData method (e.g.
"myfilter3")?

cheers

Subject: [Paraview] differences between MS Windows version and Linux version
Message-ID: <1313498920.26645.YahooMailNeo@web160115.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview developers/experts,
?
I am wondering what the differences are between MS Windows version and Linux version.
?
Using the Linux version (64 bit OS with 8 gb ram), paraview closed itself in the middle of rendering/saving images, while, the MS Windows version was able to complete the tasks - the same case file.? This is a transient case with 1000 time steps.
?
On a differnet case: steady state, but, has 5 million cells.? When I tried to generate velocity vector plot, paraview crashed and closed itself without completing generating the vector plot, while the MS Windows version was able to handle it.
?
I am using OpenSUSE 11.3 (and 11.4), 64 bit OS.? I have tried the Linux binary version and source code compiled from scratch on OpenSUSE.
?
For smaller cases, I have no issue with the Linux version.? I would think that the linux version will be more robust.
?
Any suggestion?
?
Thanks!
?

Short answer is that you cannot. The 'name' is a ParaView client-specific
thing that is not available within the data-processing pipeline. The real
question is why would you need the name in RequestData()?

git-master at the next gatekeeper review and will be included in 3.12.

Attached is the patch for same.

Ouch, so for unstructured grids Xdmf isn't such an attractive option. If
I were to store the same dataset in .pvtu + .vtu's would I get better
automatic data distribution? I must say, I haven't worked with
unstructured grids that much yet.

Paul,

If you're writing out data that is already partitioned, you should
write it out as a collection of grids. Then each grid in that
collection is read on a separate partition.

Message-ID: <CANmPiKB9cNwVpcVSQYXV2Wp6rTpX6UsFyi6n-7AKY0Xv4u+oUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to get the calculator in ParaView to output a float
array instead of a double array? The vtkArrayCalculator class seems to
support this, but it isn't exposed in the properties panel of the
calculator filter.

What I really want to do is generate a "Normals" array that will be
used for lighting calculations. My hunch is that what I have isn't
working because "Normals" are expected to be a float array instead of
a double array.

Thanks,
Cory

I don't have an answer to your question, but I'm pretty sure your hunch is
wrong and there is no need to write out floats.  There should be no
problems with having normals that are doubles.

What is probably wrong is that nothing has set the normal attributes.  The
VTK mappers do not just take any field named "Normals" and assumes they
are the normals.  Rather, you have to assign special attributes to fields
in the vtkDataSetAttributes object.

There is no direct way (that I know of) to assign a particular array as
the normals.  However, you can force it by using the programmable filter
with the following script:

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
output.ShallowCopy(input)
output.GetPointData().SetActiveNormals('Normals')

Hi there,

Has anyone successfully gotten the zlib module in the paraview
superbuild to build and install?  On my machine, it is failing on
finding zlib.h; I am not sure how to interface with the Python
setup.py patch to suggest additional directories (like ZLIB_INSTALL)
to search for the necessary components.

Thanks for any ideas,

Matt

Manual partitioning was something I was hoping to avoid. I figured with
HDF5 Paraview might be able to pick out a chunk of unstructured data per
node, using HDF5's ability to load a subset of a dataset. But I guess
manual splitting it is...

Subject: [Paraview] Get name of object in Pipeline Browser
Message-ID: <3553FAEB2A99486E8E9EE582096DE423@ufz.de>

 Dear ParaView users, 

is it possible to programmatically get the name of an object in the Pipeline Browser? To be more specific I need to get this name from a vtkActor. I am writing a exporter plugin (see http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg12939.html) and want to name my objects in the exported file. 

Thanks for your help,
Lars.

Message-ID: <CABWOrb-rqJYWF_a6jUjFZXYk=HMoxoV4c19NLjgbj91DQZpE9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have created a plugin for a new view to use one of representations
(another plugin) that I have created but the display tab in the object
inspector does not get populated.  If I switch back to using a
representation with ParaView then it all works.  I have reproduced this with
a copy of the 2D view as a plugin and set it to display
SurfaceLICRepresentation (I've editing the pqTwoDRenderView2::canDisplay to
allow all types) - if the representation is changed back to
ImageSliceRepresentation it all works.  Is this a bug or am I doing
something wrong?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

It's not possible, not from a simple exporter plugin.The exporter
lives entirely in the VTK world without any knowledge of proxies. A
unconventional approach would be explicitly make the exporter plugin
link agains the pqCore library, then you can access the
pqApplicationCore and other singletons (like ProxyManager) and get
information about what sources are present and what their names are
(this is acceptable since exporter work entirely on the client-side).
It is still, however, non trivial to determine which actor corresponds
to what source proxy.

It'd probably be easier to add a method to the vtk-exporter class which accepts a string, and from the gui, pass the string in just before export - because you can get it the proxy name from the gui end. Make sure the SetProxyName(char*...) method doesn't call Modified. (ie don't use SetStringMacro)

Hi Utkarsh,

I followed your advice, but seem to have hit on another bug, this time
with nodes not reading/showing their collection. See the attached Xdmf
file, it contains a temporal collection of spatial collections, where
there is actually only 1 timestep as it shows the incorrect behaviour.
Each spatial grid consists of 16 unstructured grids, read from 16 HDF5
files.

The behaviour I'm seeing when loading this dataset on an 8-process PV
session is that only 1/8th of the data actually shows up. Looking at the
process Id scalars it only has a range of [0,0] and only 1 out of 8 of
the "hypercolumn-?" sets in the multi-block set show any cells and
points. This is with PV patched with the code you sent earlier, btw.
Loading the same set on a local PV session works fine.

I can upload the corresponding HDF5 files, if needed, but these are not
public I'm afraid.

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Python - load state just like when using the GUI
Message-ID: <4E4C207C.1030901@student.dtu.dk>

Hi,


I'm fairly new to Paraview but am trying to get a hang on it.

My problem is that I need to make some animations by loading different 
datasets rendered the same way. After having looked at the state file 
(pvsm) one can save in the GUI I thought it would be piece of cake to 
open these ones via a Python script and then save a screenshot from 
there (thus being able to replace the path to the dataset and then being 
able to create the animation), but when I do that, all the view settings 
are not loaded in contrast to when I do it through the GUI. Is there a 
way to "execute" the settings from the state?


Best regards
Villads Egede, Denmark

We actually just tried to do the same thing for the first time yesterday and had the same issues... so if anybody has an answer, we'd like it too!

Is it just a matter of accessing some kind of data pulled in from the state file and doing a Show() or something? I got the data to appear that way (SelectActiveSource(); Show()), but the views aren't right.

Hello all,

I'm using paraview version 3.10.1
I wasn't able to change outline solid color.
I tried it on several different files.
Attached is just one example.

I chose purple, but the outline is still white.

Thank you,

Thank you, it works!

... just in previous versions I didn't have to apply a filter,
it worked by just choosing a color.

 Thanks for your answers! 

John,
where on the gui-side do I need to pass that string? Do I need to modify the ParaView sources? Because I only want to write a plugin which should be redistributable to colleagues which have only the ParaView binaries installed.
And your suggestion assumes that I only want to export one actor right? What I want is to export all actors in one step.

Message-ID: <80B5510B111EDC44BD4267D25F6C97860B4430FEC7@MSGABZCMS01.ent.bhicorp.com>

I have the same problem as described below - paraview kills itself while saving animation. I have 3.10.1 version and disabled Geometry Cache but Paraview still eats all my memory (6 gb) while saving animation and is killed after a while. It works OK in 3.8.1 with eating not more than 3% of RAM.


Nikita Tropin | Scientist

Bart,

A few memory leaks were detected in 3.10.0. We have fixes for those
waiting to go into 3.10.1. You may want to wait for 3.10.1 (which

to disable "Geomtry Cache" on the Animation Page in the Settings
dialog (You'll have to restart paraview for that setting to take
effect).

I'm not completely sure what you want, but here's what I was thinking

class vtkMyExporter ..... {

the usual vtkSetGetStuff and all the write, update, etc

  void SetMyNameString(const char *) // for a single dataset/actor
  void SetMyNameStringList(const char **) // for a list of items
};

this gets wrapped by client server etc etc

In the GUI, you could query the name from the pqXXX stuff, I have  a similar snippet that does this
      pqPipelineSource *source = *it;
      std::string xmlName = source->getProxy()->GetXMLName();
now you want the name, not the XML name, so use that
but now you can
        vtkSMPropertyHelper modified(source->getProxy(), "MyNameString");
        modified.Set(xmlName.c_str()); // or something like that
then you need to push your string into the VTK class using something like
source->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects()
or UpdatePipeline (I forget the correct calls)
and because your custom SetMyNameString doesn't trigger a modified in the pipeline, you can carry on with doing the write, but the exporter has the string passed in from he GUI just before it writes. You can pass a string list if you want and make sure the order matches the order of writes so the names match.
Since I'm not certain what you're doing, this is a bit hand wavy, but you get the idea

Not sure if this helps your exact use case ...

John,
where on the gui-side do I need to pass that string? Do I need to modify the ParaView sources? Because I only want to write a plugin which should be redistributable to colleagues which have only the ParaView binaries installed.
And your suggestion assumes that I only want to export one actor right? What I want is to export all actors in one step.

It's not possible, not from a simple exporter plugin.The exporter
lives entirely in the VTK world without any knowledge of proxies. A
unconventional approach would be explicitly make the exporter plugin
link agains the pqCore library, then you can access the
pqApplicationCore and other singletons (like ProxyManager) and get
information about what sources are present and what their names are
(this is acceptable since exporter work entirely on the client-side).
It is still, however, non trivial to determine which actor corresponds
to what source proxy.

Dear John,

thanks for your explanations. I roughly got an idea but I have a few questions:

I assume I can get *it like this:

QList<pqPipelineSource*> sources_and_filters =
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel()->findItems<pqPipelineSource*>();  

But where and when do I have to call that code? Because at the moment my plugin is executed by clicking on "File / Export" in ParaView, so I don't have any GUI related code. Everything is on the VTK side.

This sets the name on the proxy.

I dont understand how the name actually gets to my exporter. And because a list of names is more general I would only pass this list to my exporter and not a single name.


See vtkOpenSGExporter.h / .cxx on Github:

Hi Lars,

> But where and when do I have to call that code? Because at the moment my plugin is executed by clicking on "File / Export" in ParaView, so I don't have any GUI related code. Everything is on the VTK side.

Just a faint idea that happened to come to me is to create an
autostart plugin and hook any one of ***Created() signals of
pqOjbectBuilder
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/html/classpqObjectBuilder.html
that is considered suitable to detect creation of your exporter and
if detected send the strings to the server-side exporter object.

I have never tried myself so am totally unsure if it at all works, may
be totally wrong.

I assumed you had some kind of custom panel for your exporter. If you are just doing file->export, then my approach won?t be suitable.

I'm afraid I have too much of my own work to do to look at your code, but perhaps you're getting closer. you can create a filter with a custom panel, but make your writer the filter if you follow me. then when the user clicks accept, the writer will write, rather than using the drop down menu for export. it may not be ideal, but it was my first idea.

Oops, my bad! I missed the original patch I sent skipped reading data
on other processes even in the multi-grid case. I've pushed a fix.
Attached is the corrected patch (start with a clean version of Xdmf
w/o the previous patch).

Now I understand your approach.
I will first try out Takuya's suggestion. Maybe that will work. If not I will keep your thoughts in my mind and maybe reimplement the exporter as a filter/source object.

Thanks for all your help!

Subject: [Paraview] Returning a point cloud
Message-ID: <CAL28Ng+Ntk8JrBMcq=yVde6ZY4BcWuW+97KY595MrinZmVp5xQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi. I want to show a colored point cloud (vtkPointSet) returning from a
custom filter. In my custom filter, I prepare the pointCloud in this way:

vtkSmartPointer<vtkPointSet> pointCloud =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyData>::New();
   pointCloud->SetPoints(points);
   pointCloud->GetPointData()->SetScalars(distances);
   pointCloud->Update();

output->DeepCopy(pointCloud);

points is a vtkPoints and distances is a vtkDoubleArray.

The problem is that nothing is showing. If instead of using a vtkPointSet I
use a vtkPolyData and filter it with a vtkDelaunay2D, it shows some points,
but other points are left out (Do you know why is this happening?). If I use
a vtkDelaunay3D, again, I see nothing.

Do you know why is this happening? What do you recommend to build point
clouds?

I would really appreciate any suggestion.

Thanks in advance,

Federico

Hi. Is there any way to log messages into the Paraview window that opens
when an error occurs and then inspect this log if something went wrong in
the filter execution? I'm printing to the command line, but I would like a

Hi Federico,

You have to create some vertex cells. So use a polydata or unstructured 
grid instead of pointset. Polydata is the easier you'd make a cell array 
like this: 1 0 1 1 1 2 ... 1 n where n is the number of points, and add 
this with SetVerts method. You won't have to use the Delaunay filter to 
see this.

Hi all

I'm having a problem with runtime configuration of ParaViewWeb.

When I go to http://localhost:8080/PWApp and try to start a visualization, the loading screen hangs without error.

In the log file for tomcat I'm given:

SEVERE: Error initializing endpoint
java.net.BindException: Address already in use <null>:8080

This tells me that port 8080 is already in use.

In the terminal if I do:

$ netstat -lnp | grep 8080
tcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      2449/java

$ ps -lf 2449
F S UID        PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  STIME TTY        TIME CMD
0 S root      2449     1  2  80   0 - 199655 futex_ 20:38 pts/0     0:04 /usr/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/usr/local/tomcat/conf/logging.properti

This tells me that tomcat is running on port 8080. Isn't this the port it should be running on? So what's the problem?

If I shutdown tomcat
$./shutdown.sh

Then check port 8080 again, the process has been stopped:
$ netstat -lnp | grep 8080
$

What exactly is wrong here? I've set up tomcat to use port 8080, but when I try to run ParaViewWeb through tomcat it complains that port 8080 is already in use?

Thanks

Also, for the archive, please find attached to the remainder of this post some answers to previous problems I've had while setting up ParaViewWeb. Hopefully these will be of use to other users. A big thank you to Sebastian for his help.

are you sure you don't have any system tomcat already running...
Otherwise, when you stop tomcat and restart it, you did not fully stop
tomcat.

To make sure that tomcat is not running anymore after you requested it
to stop type the following command line.

> ps aux | grep java | grep tomcat

If you still have a process just kill it before trying to starting it again.

Message-ID: <CADHSJjDVFK1ASK1VV+92_g26XYKTgCKPGL-GEJzS-FdYVBLEpA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

A feature we are thinking of implementing for ParaView 4.0 is to make
it easier to distribute pvsc files to connect to various HPC
resources. I've sketched out a rough proposal for the same at
http://paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Distributing_Server_Configuration_Scripts

Any comments/suggestions are always welcome.

Utkarsh

Hi Max,

thanks for sharing that with others.

Based on the latest informations that you are providing, it seems that
you use the tomcat from the system.
In order to ease the testing/deployment process of ParaViewWeb, you
should first try to run your own tomcat as your own user that should
not be root.
But as tomcat seems to work as a daemon (root/tomcat6), you have to
make sure you did stop it before starting your own tomcat.
Moreover, if you don't want to fall on previous error, just remove all
log files, so when you start tomcat, you are sure that the new log
files contains only the information of the current session. (You can
do the same with the database directory of ParaViewWeb)

Moreover, don't try to hot deploy ParaViewWeb while tomcat is running.

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Tecplot TimeSolution
Message-ID: <4E4F3C60.3030203@gmail.com>

Hi

I'm currently using an adaptive time stepping scheme in my finite 
elements. I have some tecplot files with the timesolution parameter. I 
think in the reader itself it doesn't support "TIMESOLUTION". Is it 
possible to just insert the proper times for each timestep for the data 
using python? I'd like to use the stock released version of paraview if 
possible.

Thanks
-Jon

Hi

I think I have solved the 8080 already in use issue. I did have tomcat running on startup, so I was running two instances, both trying to use port 8080. I did check this a number of times, but I've only just realized exactly what the problem was.

When running PWApp I now receive the following logged error messages from the ParaViewWeb working directory:

ERROR: In /home/max/Downloads/ParaViewWeb/ParaViewAdapter/vtkPWJMSMessagingService.cxx, line 154
vtkPWJMSMessagingService (0x14870f0): CMS Exception

----

Also from pw-out-1.log: (I'm not sure if this is in fact an error)

JMS Initialized in 0.115973 seconds
sessionID : org.paraview.paraweb
logLevel : ERROR
Processing Engine Initialized in 2.20879 seconds

Processing engine is started !
Error message: DataInputStream::readLong - Reached EOF

	FILE: activemq/wireformat/openwire/OpenWireFormat.cpp, LINE: 265
	FILE: activemq/transport/IOTransport.cpp, LINE: 243

----

I've searched for the above errors, but I couldn't find a solution.

Could someone suggest what the problem may be?

Thanks
Max

Hi Max,

thanks for sharing that with others.

Based on the latest informations that you are providing, it seems that
you use the tomcat from the system.
In order to ease the testing/deployment process of ParaViewWeb, you
should first try to run your own tomcat as your own user that should
not be root.
But as tomcat seems to work as a daemon (root/tomcat6), you have to
make sure you did stop it before starting your own tomcat.
Moreover, if you don't want to fall on previous error, just remove all
log files, so when you start tomcat, you are sure that the new log
files contains only the information of the current session. (You can
do the same with the database directory of ParaViewWeb)

Moreover, don't try to hot deploy ParaViewWeb while tomcat is running.

Seb

Hi Max,

I never get that error. It seems that the tomcat application (Java) is
sending an incomplete stream to the server PWServer (c++).
What is the content of the tomcat log ? (catalina.out)

What did you try to load with PWApp ? Did you check the PWService and
were you able to see the running process or the history of them ?

Thanks,

Seb

We have spent a lot of time and effort working with you guys to improve the functionality of PVSC files and now have them implemented extensively.    As you've pointed out, the next issue is to address is the distribution of PVSC files - in our environment, we want the distribution to be controlled.     For no good reason other than being totally paranoid, I don't want my connection definitions to be globally accessible.     I suppose that as long as the Server Sources dialog supports a connection to an authenticated web server, this would be a perfectly acceptable solution.   

I'd be happy to work with you to test this implementation as it becomes available.

Folks,

A feature we are thinking of implementing for ParaView 4.0 is to make
it easier to distribute pvsc files to connect to various HPC
resources. I've sketched out a rough proposal for the same at
http://paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Distributing_Server_Configuration_Scripts

Any comments/suggestions are always welcome.

Rick,

That's a good suggestion. I'll add a note to the wiki so that we keep
authenticated/secure connections in mind when implementing this
feature.

Hi Utkarsh,

this looks great.

One thing I have encountered and that you may want to think about is 
that a single static pvsc is not going to work for all users as pvsc's 
depend on external components such as xterm, ssh, and plink. These are 
in different places on different user's systems, maybe not present on 
the user's system leading to the pvsc not working.

I could see a couple of different avenues to solve this: Probably the 
best would be to integrate ssh tunneling into PV via libssh so that 
these dependencies are not needed. An aleternative would be to include a 
configure step in your new pvsc import process (like cmake) where 
dependencies are located and a system specific pvcs is generated. 
Something far easier and less intrusive might be to add a file dialog 
element to the pvsc syntax so that the user could easily  browse for 
these files. That's not as nice as the other approaches because it 
clutters the UI and the user still has to hunt down the files, but it at 
least gives them a method to do so.

Message-ID: <CAASrb3rXHWZF0X1M896zfBf6fAW2pZ9sCmbRsBvkuq2eHnwTYg@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to save a generated dataset as a .pvti file using PV 3.10.1.
First I generate a dataset by using the Sources->Wavelet function and
setting the whole extents to 0,255,0,255,0,255. The generated dataset will
contain 1 scalar value and turns out to be ~68M in resident memory. If I'm
running a client->server connection, and my server is running N number of
nodes, I should be able to save as a .pvti file outputting N number of
files. I go through the Save Data process, choose a .pvti file, leave the
settings as default (Nothing checked, set to Appended) and save my data. The
data is then saved into N number of files with all the files being the same
size (~68M) and contain the entire dataset per file. Is this behavior
expected? I would presume that the data would be split accross N number of
files instead of having N number of files with each file containing all of
the data. Thanks!

Hi Everyone,

I have a question about paraview python calculator "strain".

My questions are:

1. If want to calculate strain form a displacement field (3 component
vecotor),
is it correct to use directly

strain(deformationfield_vector)

2. If the above is correct, then what kind of strain is it?
Is it infinitesimal strain, Green-Lagrangian, or Euler-Almansi strain?

I tried to search from the internet, but couldn't find any related answers.

Thanks for attention.
BR,
Zoe

That sounds odd. I tried the same with git-master Paraview and it
seems to save out N independent blocks just fine. Can you copy+paste
the header from one of the vti files?

Burlen,

Good points. At the risk of stating the obvious let's note that we'll
be able to distribute different pvsc versions for the server for
different OSs and ParaView versions without any issue. Now locating
ssh/xterm/plink etc are indeed real issues.

I don't like the cmake approach, it requires that we need a separate
step and would require users to install cmake (unless we include cmake
in the binaries). libssh approach sounds interesting. The only concern
is will users to reluctant to use a ssh client we provide rather than
their chosen (and trusted one).

Like John said, the file inputs are already supported in pvsc.

Pat Marion has been pushing for the ability to have Python scripts
instead-of/in-addition-to pvsc-xmls. I think that's another viable
approach since it allows us to write code to discover information
about the client/server and take appropriate action(s).

Message-ID: <CADHSJjB8u2L5f59XASsOwsF7_pKjeeKxXn1ExZrPk4fXOfSO6A@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

For the longest time ParaView has been using an odd/even version
number scheme: N.{odd}.* was treated as a development version while
N.{even}.* was treated as a release version. There were a couple of
problems:
* One could never tell two development checkouts apart. Since
development version almost was never changed until the next release,
for users reporting bugs on development version it was hard to
determine if the bug was already fixed since the report.
* Manual updates to version number was error prone.

In a previous post (http://markmail.org/message/vbtbjgyt5k5iaanp) on
Apr 15, 2011, I alluded to a possibility of changing ParaView version
scheme.  Accordingly, I've committed a change to git (awaiting
gatekeeper review) to change the version scheme.

Now the version is determined using a call to "git describe"
(http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-describe.html).
Due to the way the official releases are tagged, this returns a string
in the following form:

v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>-<commit count>-<commit sha>

If the source state is same as a tagged official version, then the
string returned will not have anything after the patch version. If
there are any commits since the latest tag, it will result in the
unique suffix.
The advantages are:
* One knows exactly the revision of ParaView source that was used for the build.
* Source does not need to be changed, one simply tags the repository
and the version number is updated.

After 3.12, we no longer need to have even minor numbers for releases,
so if we want, we can release a 3.13, 3.14 and so on.

I know for our HPC access, they require a custom version of SSH that has been security enhanced. So if PV used a built-in libssh, we would be unable to use PV to connect through to them.

I don't have a better solution, just wanted to point out that packaging libssh without an option to use a system one would not work in some cases.

Tim,

That's was exactly what I was concerned about when it comes to using
libssh. Good to know that there are indeed such use-cases and not
merely hypothetical ones.

Sure. Here is the header for the .pvti file

<VTKFile type="PImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">

Jesus,

I verified that it's indeed a bug with 3.10.1. However it has been
fixed since and the fix will be included in the upcoming 3.12.

Hi Utkarsh,

It sounds like you need a very flexible solution, or even multiple 
solutions, given the variety of use cases you have to support.

You hit on a great point re python approach

Which brings up another pvsc related issue could PV reliably find an 
open port when constructing the ssh tunnel from PV over to the HPC site. 
I don't think it's currently possible to script this.

We just pick a random port between 2000 and 65000 ... the chances are pretty slim (but not absolutely zero) for stepping on another process, right?   8-)

Yes, and this has worked OK, at least no one complained, but I think 
that it's success has more to do with a small number of users involved 
rather than the strength of this approach.

Hi Blaise,

The Lion compatible ParaView 3.10.1 binary is now available.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Direct Link:

http://paraview.org/files/v3.10/ParaView-3.10.1-OSX-10.7-x86_64.dmg

Note that this binary does not include MPI. In the next minor release we
will most likely have this addressed by packaging MPI as we do on Windows
and Linux.

Subject: [Paraview] How to prevent rendering after adding a filter
Message-ID: <E19BE6953F23EE46B3D6DBC11DE7817F2B14ABFA2A@HSV-EX01.wfinet.com>


Problem: When building a long pipeline on a large dataset, the rendering 
of the result from each added filter takes a long time, for an intermediate 
result that is of no interest.

Question: Is there a way to force ParaView (3.10.1) to use "Outline" 
representation for each added filter?  Or perhaps to default to "Off" 
visibility?

Sure would be handy!  Thanks!

Hmm,

I haven't been able to reproduce it yet. I suspected a simple numpy
dependency problem, but the code in  vtkPythonProgrammableFilter.cxx
where numpy is imported does so in a try block. That code should
suffice and doesn't look like the code you've posted.

Which version of ParaView, which OS and what python version do you
have? A good bug report with details on how to reproduce the problem
would help greatly. Please submit one and I can look at it more
deeply.

Hi Sudhir,

I'm glad you managed to deploy successfully ParaViewWeb specially with
the latest version of activemq-cpp.
Regarding your issue I have an idea, but I might need also some more
feedback from you.

First of all, what kind of data did you tried to render ? Did you
used, one of our sample application ? (PWApp ?)
During the configuration with CMake, what value did you set for the
path to the webgl javascript file ? (Sometime the automatic detection
doesn't seems to work properly.)

If you used you own application, you need to tell the server that it
should also generate a WebGL data structure.

Just let me know more about what you are doing so I could figure out
what is happening here.

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] RequestData gets called twice when in parallel
Message-ID: <CABWOrb8U2f7Xm5pRQs=xu5mZ=Hs_A8LSVcCy6dFb2sxCPDG56A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Filters have their RequestData called twice when using a parallel server.
 This happens when the filter is first added - subsequent "Apply"s only
called it once.

To reproduce:
First run a parallel server, attach a debugger and set a breakpoint in
"vtkArrayCalculator::RequestData"
Create a Box source
Use calculator to add an array, e.g. "coordsX"
Click Apply [ RequestData gets called twice ]
Update arrat , e.g. "coordsX + 0"
Click Apply [ RequestData only gets called once ]

I've added a bug report - http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12546

Regards,
Paul

Dear All!
Is there a way to get the paraview version from within a python script?  I could get  the underlying VTK version with paraview.vtk.vtkVersion.GetVTKVersion(), but I could not manage to achieve the same with the paraview version, although it pops up to the output when performing: from paraview.simple import *.
Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] KiwiViewer in App Store. New open-source library coming
	soon.
Message-ID: <CAMetC=Te=Uwdfacqgci4WBR+Q5aShC0z4O7Ko9S+ODA4AFTsaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm excited to announce Kitware's first entry in the Apple app store.
KiwiViewer is a free, interactive application for exploration of geometric
datasets on multi-touch mobile devices.  You can learn more about the app at
the website here:

  http://kiwiviewer.org

And here is a press release:

  http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2011/8/prweb8741699.htm

In progress are Android and WebGL versions of KiwiViewer.  The KiwiViewer
app uses VTK and a new library we're calling VES: VTK OpenGL ES rendering
toolkit.  We look forward to releasing VES open source under the Apache 2.0
license.   With VES we hope to pave the way for development of VTK
applications on mobile and web platforms.

There's just a few things that we want to get in order before we open up the
repository, so thanks for being patient!  In the meantime, we'd like to hear
your ideas.  What sorts of things would you like to do on the mobile and web
platforms?

VES is a standalone repository right now, but in the future we see it
becoming a module in the VTK repository, supplementing VTK's current OpenGL
pipeline.  Here's what you can expect in the short term:

-We're aiming for an end of October public release
-VES will include the KiwiViewer app for Android, iOS, and WebGL,
demonstrating how to use VTK in the mobile and web domains
-VES will include CMake scripts for cross compiling VTK on Android and iOS
platforms (using the vtkmodular repository)
-VES will be an open, fully inclusive effort.  We hope the community is
interested in helping us design APIs, and as always patches are welcome and
we can give commit access to community members interested in collaboration.

Stay tuned for future announcements, and don't hesitate to contact us with
your project ideas!  If you're a potential customer who'd like help moving
your current application to a web or mobile platform, you can contact us at
kitware at kitware.com.

I'm going to throw my support in for the Python scripting suggestion. 
It would probably help with the open port issue (e.g., watching ssh 
output for an error), in discovering the location of plink/ssh/etc., and 
probably a number of other use cases.  Also, the issue of modified 
versions of ssh is going to be a common problem, so libssh would 
definitely not work for many use cases.

Thanks,
Sean

Message-ID: <CAASrb3pFWKLFzUPHy+j3eisMWBj4x0iu3siH0h3L=aXoQDT9Hw@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to volume render an unstructured grid of points using pvbatch
but I am getting an error:

ERROR: In

and

When trying to use Projected tetra.

I am using the "latest" git version as of today. I also tried with PV3.10.1
64bit linux binary and I am having the same error with pvbatch.


Here is the script that I am using in pvbatch. I generated this script with
the help from using python trace within paraview (where the rendering
works). I think it tries to reference the data under

Threshold1.Scalars = ['POINTS', 'volume_scalars']

but even if I comment this line out of my script I obtain the same error as
above so somehow it's not able to reference the scalar points.

Subject: [Paraview] Python - load state just like when using the GUI

Message-ID: <1361159782.1039639.1314244580253.JavaMail.root@mail2.gatech.edu>

Hi all,

So I did some more digging. It turns out the instructions on the wiki at:

http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Loading_State_and_Manipulating_It

is wrong. If you follow those steps, you just get a black image with nothing in it. However, I found a presentation at:

http://www.vgtc.org/PDF/slides/2008/visweek/tutorial6_ayachit_python.pdf

with the correct steps. To load the state file correctly, one must do:

from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.LoadState(filename)
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
view.StillRender()

I've requested an account on the wiki so I can make the change to the page (assuming as a new user I can... if not, can somebody update the information?)

We actually just tried to do the same thing for the first time yesterday and had the same issues... so if anybody has an answer, we'd like it too!

Is it just a matter of accessing some kind of data pulled in from the state file and doing a Show() or something? I got the data to appear that way (SelectActiveSource(); Show()), but the views aren't right.

Subject: [Paraview] Python - load state just like when using the GUI

Hi,


I'm fairly new to Paraview but am trying to get a hang on it.

My problem is that I need to make some animations by loading different 
datasets rendered the same way. After having looked at the state file 
(pvsm) one can save in the GUI I thought it would be piece of cake to 
open these ones via a Python script and then save a screenshot from 
there (thus being able to replace the path to the dataset and then being 
able to create the animation), but when I do that, all the view settings 
are not loaded in contrast to when I do it through the GUI. Is there a 
way to "execute" the settings from the state?


Best regards
Villads Egede, Denmark

Hi Sudhir,

For the WEBGL_JAVASCRIPT_PATH, you must use a full path like that one
"/home/seb/.../ParaViewWeb/WebServer/PWService/web/js/dev/"

Otherwise, despite the fact you start tomcat as root, everything seems
to be fine.

That's good news.
 
Do you have any plans to port this to Android devices?

comingsoon.


Hi,

I'm excited to announce Kitware's first entry in the Apple app store.
KiwiViewer is a free, interactive application for exploration of geometric
datasets on multi-touch mobile devices.  You can learn more about the app at
the website here:

  http://kiwiviewer.org <http://kiwiviewer.org/> 

And here is a press release:

  http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2011/8/prweb8741699.htm

In progress are Android and WebGL versions of KiwiViewer.  The KiwiViewer
app uses VTK and a new library we're calling VES: VTK OpenGL ES rendering
toolkit.  We look forward to releasing VES open source under the Apache 2.0
license.   With VES we hope to pave the way for development of VTK
applications on mobile and web platforms.

There's just a few things that we want to get in order before we open up the
repository, so thanks for being patient!  In the meantime, we'd like to hear
your ideas.  What sorts of things would you like to do on the mobile and web
platforms?

VES is a standalone repository right now, but in the future we see it
becoming a module in the VTK repository, supplementing VTK's current OpenGL
pipeline.  Here's what you can expect in the short term:

-We're aiming for an end of October public release
-VES will include the KiwiViewer app for Android, iOS, and WebGL,
demonstrating how to use VTK in the mobile and web domains
-VES will include CMake scripts for cross compiling VTK on Android and iOS
platforms (using the vtkmodular repository)
-VES will be an open, fully inclusive effort.  We hope the community is
interested in helping us design APIs, and as always patches are welcome and
we can give commit access to community members interested in collaboration.

Stay tuned for future announcements, and don't hesitate to contact us with
your project ideas!  If you're a potential customer who'd like help moving
your current application to a web or mobile platform, you can contact us at
kitware at kitware.com.

Pat

Good catch. That's actually a bug in the simply.py module. I'm
committing a fix, it will be included in the upcoming 3.12 release.

Good to know. Looks like we have enough interest to add Python
support. That is indeed on our TODO list for pvsc improvements. It may
happen after 4.0, however.

Subject: [Paraview] Widgets and RequestData
Message-ID: <CAHwVLSg74knwwm0d9G3vDc_u1WV4fMPpxUv5Ejao0odVVjpPDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I have created a vtk filter that has an implicit widget attached, the widget
shows up in the 3d view but
it never updates the filter (the RequestData method is never executed in the
filter after interacting with the widget). If the current
frame is changed the RequestData method does execute with the updated values
from the widget though. Is there
something special that needs to be done with the widget so that this
happens?

Here is the xml:

   <SourceProxy name="FourFlowVolumeTraceNormal"
class="vtkFourFlowVolumeTrace" label="VolumeTrace">

    <InputProperty name="Input" command="SetInputConnection">
          <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
            <Group name="sources"/>
            <Group name="filters"/>
          </ProxyGroupDomain>
          <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
            <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
          </DataTypeDomain>
     </InputProperty>

     <ProxyProperty name="ClipFunction" command="SetClipFunction"
label="Clip Type">
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
               <Group name="implicit_functions"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
              <Proxy group="implicit_functions" name="Plane" />
              <Proxy group="implicit_functions" name="Box" />
              <Proxy group="implicit_functions" name="Sphere" />
           </ProxyListDomain>
     </ProxyProperty>

      <DoubleVectorProperty
         name="ISOValue"
         command="SetISOValue"
         number_of_elements="1"
         animateable="0"
         default_values="0.02"
         information_property="ISOValueInfo">>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>

      <DoubleVectorProperty
         name="ISOValueInfo"
         command="GetISOValue"
         information_only="1">
         <SimpleDoubleInformationHelper/>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>

   </SourceProxy>

Thanks

Hello,

I'm trying to get the values of the array 'Area' (obtained thanks to the
Integratevariables filter)  for different time steps and through a python
script. Does anybody knows how can i access to this array with a python

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkBoxWidget2 RotationEnabledOff doesn't work
Message-ID: <CAMrOPmwGfrGGBoHXsrpCdfek62zyE4fPT_zin-o2S6xmPoMuXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm getting stuck with the following piece of code:

vtkSMProxy *boxProxy =
builder->createProxy("implicit_functions","Box",pqApplicationCore::instance()->getActiveServer(),"widgets");

QList<pq3DWidget *> widgets =  pq3DWidget::createWidgets(refProxy, boxProxy);

vtkBoxWidget2 *boxwidget =
dynamic_cast<vtkBoxWidget2*>(widgets[0]->getWidgetProxy()->GetWidget());
assert(boxwidget);

boxwidgets->RotationEnabledOff();

bool rotEnabled = boxwidget->GetRotationEnabled();
if (rotEnabled == false)
    std::cout << "ROT DISABLED" << std::endl;

// Not sure if needed, but just in case...
widgets[0]->getWidgetProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();


Well, even if I get the print message, when I run my paraview based
application, it let me rotate the box widget representation.
I  also tried disabling events using "boxwidget->ProcessEventsOff();"
and it also worked, so I think I'm using the right reference...

Am I missing something?

Subject: [Paraview] Python - load state just like when using the GUI
In-Reply-To: <CADHSJjAYxKB-f-UU68cXt8mAPaHOUidD7453m97O9iaEi10Muw@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <857015588.1061963.1314297068074.JavaMail.root@mail2.gatech.edu>

Thanks!

Would it be also possible to get it setup so we can override the files in the state file upon loading, just as is done with the GUI? I was going to try and implement this myself, but after spending 6 hours trying to track through the code to figure out how it works, I'm stumped. My first adventure into VTK and Paraview guts didn't go so well...

For that to work, I guess there would need to be an extra step in the process. First would be to load the state file but not execute anything. Then modify the XML tree as desired, then update the pipeline. 

The most flexible way to do it (because it would allow changes to things other than filenames) is to have a dictionary you can specify the id and the value. For instance:

{'278.FileName': 'MyFile', '278.CellArrayStatus.array_list':['Pressure','Temperature']}

etc.. That would have to be passed through a function since I assume we can't expose the actual information directly to the user since it resides on the server and not the client. 

Has anybody thought about this recently? I saw it had been discussed and given up on a year ago... I will keep trying to figure out how the code works in my spare time, but it will probably be a long time before I figure it out.

Tim

Subject: [Paraview] Another ParaViewWeb install question
Message-ID: <4E56A6CC.8070900@ucd.ie>

Hi,

I've built, installed, and deployed PW - all from git master branch.

The demos PVApp and PVState work well when rendering with javascript, 
java or flash but there's a crash when switching to WebGL.

Were running

tomcat6 (system)
jdk 1.6.0_26
activemq-5.3.2
x86_64 GNU/Linux


WEB_JAVASCRIPT_PATH

points to the source directory ~/PW/WebServer/PWService/web/js/dev

______________________

Chrome on the client side tells me (when switching to WebGL in PWStates):

Uncaught org.paraview.util.ServerDownException
     Paraview.sendEvent
     switchRenderer
     (anonymous function)
     onchange

stepping through the javascript, the  crash
seems to happen at jsonRpcClient.VisualizationsManager.

______________________

Tomcat says (not much)

Start Garbage collecting the ParaView processes:
  - Look at 163841
    -> already quit with error

You can simply fix that by replacing the content of that method by

return false;

I've just created a bug for that. Thanks for reporting the issue.

I have a user with 120+ GB structured dataset in a single file.   His xdmf file contains a single domain.  Anyone know whether PV will do the import in parallel, or will it load it all onto one node and distribute it?  

Thanks!

ParaView 3.10 has a bug and it will load the data on on nodes. 3.12
has that bug fixed, and the single domain will be loaded on root node
alone (I can send you a patch for that, if that's easier). You can
explicitly distribute the data afterword using D3 filter.

Hello,

I am working on blood flow visualization of cartoid artery. We have a
display wall which has 6 screens (2rows*3columns) and our system has 3
rendering servers (each of them has 1 gpu). As far as i know using tiled
screen mode let Paraview render on gpus and we can see the animation on
the screens and on cpu rendering mode, the only animation happens on
remote computer which is connected to servers.Is there any chance to see
animation on the screens while rendering on cpus because at the
performance comparison step, i see that cpu rendering has 25% rating than
gpu rendering (performance test has been done for 3gpus vs 3cpus/cores).
If you think that my problem is irrevelant to compare cpu and gpu
performances, what do you suggest?

Sorry, but I'm confused by the question.

You say you have a display comprising 6 screens.  Your rendering cluster
has 3 nodes each with 1 GPU.  How do you get a signal to all 6 screens
with only 3 GPU's?  Does each GPU have a dual output that can drive two
screens?  If so, are the two screens treated as one so that one window
from one MPI process covers both, or do you have to run two MPI processes
per GPU node to drive both screens?

You also say that you have nodes with only CPU's in them.  How many do you
have?  And how are they connected to the GPU nodes?  Are they two totally
separate clusters or all they all part of the same cluster and the GPU
nodes are just three special nodes in a larger cluster?

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Python Programmable Filters and Data
	Segmentation
Message-ID: <CAASrb3oMeo2DZ7dX264ns6f6ODnLqe5ufh5QnnzgjqbqZ5Zf8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working on various python programmable filters and have gotten them
working in parallel but I've ran into some problems and have questions on
some of the functionality. I am working with (structured) vtkImageData
loaded in from a .pvti file (4 pieces) and will want to ideally output
vtkUnstructuredData for some of my filters, and vtkImageData for others. I
am not sure if Paraview is supposed to segment the input/output data for you
but what I've found out is that it will depending on the set output data
type.

If you choose vtkPolyData, vtkStructuredGrid, vtkRectilinearGrid,
vtkImageData, and vtkUniformGrid, and print the input extents for each
processor that's running the filter, the input will be that of the entire
dataset. (and therefore each pvserver will read in the entire dataset into
memory!)

If you choose vtkUnstructuredGrid or vtkMultiBlockData, then the input will
be segmented into pieces and printing the extents of the data for each
processor running the filter will show the input segmented.

Now, my question is if this behavior is normal/expected? If it is, is there
a filter that I may call within my filter to segment my data to only include
piece X our of N processors available?

Regarding the output data, I'm assuming each processor is expecting a
certain extent of the data and Paraview will combine the output of all
processors into one object, but when I output the "output" extents (out =
self.GetOutput()), the extents are set to the entire dataset size by
default.

I've also found a bug within the datatypes in which inputs are segmented.
When a filter is initially added and applied to a dataset, outputting the
extents of the inputs shows that each processor is loading the entire extent
of the data. If you have a dataset with multiple timesteps or are able to
force Paraview to re-read the dataset with the filter already set, you will
see that the "correct" segmented extents are now passed through to the
filter for each core.

Another, perhaps bug, is that if daisy-chain two python programmable
filters, the first one being one of the two datatypes that segment the data,
and then the second being one that doesnt segment the data, the inputs for
the first filter will no longer be segmented anymore.

Ooops oops! I should really start reading emails fully! I misread your
email, I assumed you were talking of unstructured grid. For structrued
datasets, Xdmf is going to work just fine, even with 3.10.  It will
read sub-extents on each processes correctly.

(Thankfully Berk caught my error).

Actually, to answer my own question, Structured data can be segmented by
adding

from paraview import util
self.GetExecutive().SetExtentTranslator(self.GetExecutive().GetOutputInformation(0),
vtk.vtkExtentTranslator())

To the RequestInformation box in the programmable filter and therefore I no
longer have a problem daisy-chaining different types of filters.

Although all datatypes can be segmented now, the bug where when the filter
is initially applied is still present. The data is not segmented until the
dataset is reread with the filter already applied.

Another thing that I ran into is that if I use vtkThreshold on the segmented
data, the threshold filter will somehow grab the entire extent of the data
and output the threshold of the entire data (per processor) even you you
give it the segmented input. As of result you have a thresholded dataset
that is (thresholded data size) * (number of processors)  large. Here is
some sample code with the output set to vtkUnstructuredGrid

script
---------

import time

import paraview.vtk.parallel

myProcId = 0

numProcs = 1

controller =
paraview.vtk.parallel.vtkMultiProcessController.GetGlobalController()

if controller:

myProcId = controller.GetLocalProcessId()

numProcs = controller.GetNumberOfProcesses()

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0) # Safer method

output = self.GetOutput()

indim = input.GetDimensions()

print(str(myProcId) + ">> input dimensions: " + str(indim[0]) + " " +
str(indim[1]) + " " + str(indim[2]) + "\n")


 #Threshold the data

t1 = time.clock()

thresh = vtk.vtkThreshold()

thresh.SetInput(input)

thresh.SetInputArrayToProcess(0, 0, 0,
vtk.vtkDataObject.FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS, "volume_scalars");

thresh.ThresholdBetween(2, 3)

thresh.Update()

output.ShallowCopy(thresh.GetOutput())

print("Time spent thresholding: " + str(time.clock()-t1) + "\n")

print(str(myProcId) + " is done!\n")


------------

Requestinformation script (Although for vtkUnstructuredData the input is
already segmented)

---------------

 from paraview import util

self.GetExecutive().SetExtentTranslator(self.GetExecutive().GetOutputInformation(0),

vtk.vtkExtentTranslator())



Would this be considered correct?

Sorry, I should be more clear. The system has 3 servers which are HP xw8600
workstations (
http://h20331.www2.hp.com/Hpsub/downloads/xw8600_xw6600_FAQ_hi_res.pdf).
Each of them has 1 gpu (nvidia quadro fx 5600 with 2 dvi connectors). There
is only one cluster. Sorry about the confusion.

I run 2 process for each gpu to achieve tiled display.

In that case, I recommend that you those three GPU nodes plus any number of CPU nodes that make sense (with one MPI process per core).  ParaView will distribute the rendering over all the nodes, GPU and CPU, even though you will only see output on those 6 processes.  If your CPU nodes are set up similarly to your GPU nodes, that is with X hosts and OpenGL drivers, you just run all the processes the same.  If your CPUs don't have X host, you can still perform rendering with Mesa 3D.  In that case you'll need to use different pvserver executables for each.  ParaView won't actually understand the heterogeneity of your system, which will lead to some load imbalance, but not so much that I would bother to worry about it.

Does that answer your question?

Sorry, but I'm confused by the question.

You say you have a display comprising 6 screens.  Your rendering cluster
has 3 nodes each with 1 GPU.  How do you get a signal to all 6 screens
with only 3 GPU's?  Does each GPU have a dual output that can drive two
screens?  If so, are the two screens treated as one so that one window
from one MPI process covers both, or do you have to run two MPI processes
per GPU node to drive both screens?

You also say that you have nodes with only CPU's in them.  How many do you
have?  And how are they connected to the GPU nodes?  Are they two totally
separate clusters or all they all part of the same cluster and the GPU
nodes are just three special nodes in a larger cluster?

Subject: [Paraview] NULL value support is unclear.
Message-ID: <CAG_4-QP0gecPSAoLZFg_DLvS22vp06DbdpDCq8S0LL_MYnVfYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview Users,

Is there some guidance on the treatment  of  data  sets  which  contain some
missing, NULL or mask data areas? For instance, if some vtkImage or
vtkStructuredGrid, the data may contain some internal holes, or irregular
boundary, denoted by  special  values,  such  as  -9999. How can this
special value be denoted,  so it is avoided by filters? Is there support for
the NULL data  concept  within  the  VTK  data  structures?  If so, are
these exposed  within  ParaView  filters?  I can see that a filter such
as threshold  could  be applied to create an unstructured mesh ignoring NULL
 cells,  or  the  data  loader  itself could perform this task, however
 this  destroys  structured  data  coherence. There is a NAN color  menu  in
 the color editor. How does this work? Is there some example? Is NAN
detection implemented within all ParaView filters?

Any hints or suggestions are welcome!

Thanking you.

Sincerely,
ajjp.vw

Hello Tim,

I warn you upfront, I am no expert in Paraview/VTK ;).

Would it be an option to do it in reverse. First read the state file
as an XML file (so through the Paraview Python interface). Update the
XML tree (I use lxml and XPATH for this) and than send it to Paraview?
To be honest, I don't know if there is an efficient way of passing the
XML tree to Paraview. I will take a look at it and let you know if I
find anything usefull.

Regards,

Marco

Subject: [Paraview] Grouped Transformations.
Message-ID: <CAG_4-QNn5WgjGUxyDp1nnX84=xk8iFgzWrbQr1HnLpn+KgEFpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

How to group Objects into geometric transformation hierarchies? Each  Object
 inspector  panel  has  Display tab, with local display transformations  for
 offset  scale, etc. I would like to group most visible objects in the 3D
view, and apply some global scaling in one place,  creating a parent
transformation. For instance, I would like to  apply Z * 10 to all objects,
contours, lines, glyphs, etc with a single   parameter.   Is  there  a  way
 to  create  such  a  parent transformation?  If  not,  is there a
recommended way to connect all the Z scale controls together into a single
master parameter?

Regards,

Hello Jorge,

It's been quite a while since I dealt with widgets in ParaView, but I just thought I'd let you know that it wasn't until very recently (sometime late in July 2011) that features like disabling Rotation was actually implemented in the BoxWidget2 in VTK. The API has indicated it was possible for quite some time, but it was never really coded up for some reason.

So, the first step might be to figure out whether the version of ParaView you're building against has a recent-enough version of VTK to even have this functionality.

Good luck,
-Eric

I omitted that line before because I was getting the following error.
Readding it gives this error:

Subject: [Paraview] Z Buffer Shift.
Message-ID: <CAG_4-QO3K_oooJuYQtohM7aq5gnrA7c9stV4Nr2=+hCwnrdd6w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaViewers,

The ParaView view system has Z Buffer shift controls, in?Render View
Camera menus, as "Use Z-Buffer Shift :?adjusts OpenGL's Z direction
scaling to draw one object slightly in?front of the other. The Z Shift
property controls the amount of?offset." Is there some example of how
this may be used? It does?not appear to work on my system. For
instance, two instances of?plane source, with slightly modified
extents, different display?colors will conflict and fight with each
other. Does the Z Buffer?shift work with multiple surfaces, or
surfaces & outlines??What is the scope of support for this feature,
and a working?example of its application?

Thank you.

Best regards,

Hello Eric,

I figured out after reading the source code. I couldn't find any use of these 
variables, but still I wasn't sure if there was some paraview/cmake magic xD.

I'm using 3.8.1 and yesterday morning I finally decided to subclass 
vtkBoxRepresentation to vtkNonrotatingBoxRepresentation and provide a new 
widget with the ADD_3DWIDGET macro (although I needed to duplicate and modify 
some xml definitions to get it working). Anyway, thanks for answering my 
question. I will take into account if I decide to update Paraview in a future.

Cheers.

Ajjp,

The z-buffer shift indeed applies to the lines/points alone. You
cannot use to offset two surface representations of plane source, for
example.

You're getting that error because more likely than not, your threshold
range is such that no data is getting passed through. Ensure that the
the Threshold1.ThresholdRange is set to a valid range so that  at
least some cells are passed through.

Hi David,

The error message reported by the Python build itself reports that it
didn't find the necessary bits to build zlib:

Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules
were not found:
_bsddb             _sqlite3           bsddb185
bz2                dbm                dl
gdbm               imageop            readline
sunaudiodev        zlib
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for
the module's name.

After digging through detect_modules and the CMake files I think the
issue is that detect_modules looks at CPPFLAGS.  I've tried modifying
External_Python.cmake with

set(ENV(CPPFLAGS) -I at ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR@)

but this did not seem to be propagated to the environment configure
read from, as config.log indicated that CPPFLAGS was set to the empty
string.

Any suggestions how to correctly thread this through?

Thanks,

Matt

Ah yes, The configure step of python has to be run from a script. See
External_NUMPY.cmake for example where each of the steps
(configure,make,install) are run as separate scripts that are configured
with configure_file. The files for the most part just set environment
variables for the build.

Hi David,

Sorry, I should have mentioned, setting the environment variables in
python_configure_step.cmake.in also had no effect -- but the pointer
helped me figure out why!  The External_Python.cmake file that I
started from has the set(python_CONFIGURE_COMMAND ...) call commented
out and specifies a configure command in ExternalProject_Add.

I was able to get it to compile by making the following changes:

 * Uncomment out the various python_*_COMMAND settings
 * Set the ExternalProject_Add call to use those commands
 * Move the include(External_zlib) to just above if(NOT APPLE) in
CMakeLists.txt in the SuperBuild
 * add these lines to python_configure_step.cmake.in

  set(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} "@CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR@/python-build/lib")
  set(ENV{CXX} "@CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER@")
  set(ENV{CPPFLAGS} "-I at ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR@")
  set(ENV{LDFLAGS} "-L at ZLIB_LIBRARY_DIR@")

Now I have a nice zlib module.  :)

I've committed these changes to my gitorious repo, if you're
interested -- it's a fork of the jpocom-paraview repo under Jorge's
account (jpocom).  It probably has a few mistakes or CMake idioms I
have done incorrectly, but I've also added several other modules
(including yt) to it.  I'm testing a full build at the moment, but it
will take a little while to see the results.

Thanks for all your help!

-Matt

You're right, I have multiple timestep data and for the first couple of
timesteps there is nothing within that threshold range but as I proceed with
consequent timesteps data starts falling within that range. I am trying to
visualize data that starts from nothing and starts expanding into a certain
threshold range. How would I handle the case where there is no data within a
certain range and not have it crash? I would think that it would just simply
render nothing and continue with the following timesteps instead of just
crashing out. I could simply start at the frame where data starts appearing
by statically coding the frame number but this script will be ran on
different datasets.

Sohail,

Regarding what I previously sent, I can now just check

Threshold1.PointData.GetNumberOfArrays()

for each timestep to see if a valid output is produced, if it is then I can
apply the settings and everything works fine. Thanks for your help!

The  view  light  menu  dialog  allows typing in detailed lighting

light direction vectors with mouse rotation control?

Thanks.

When I click the "Split Horizontal" button and then click "Spreadsheet

"Application asked to unregister timer 0x7800000e which is not
registered in this thread. Fix application."

in the "Output Messages". Everything seems to continue working
properly once I "Close" the Output Messages.

Any idea why this would happen? It does not happen with all views,
only the spreadsheet.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] How to associate a vtkTextActor to a point in the
	pipeline
Message-ID: <CA+pnd0nQm5ck=vrwcD0=B0KSq4JD9T5biDv7m-tDvGdS9H8_fA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have a short question. Is it possible to create (in Python) a
vtkTextActor and associate this to a grid point in the Paraview
pipeline? If so, can someone outline the steps that I need to take? I
know how to obtain the points in the pipeline and how to work with the
vtkTextActor class. I just don't understand how I can associate the
text instance to a specified point and render it.

Kind regards,

Marco

Subject: [Paraview] Cosmo Reader - 64bit IDs
Message-ID: <D2D497A4-6BF1-4A7A-9B24-246387C92E9C@mcs.anl.gov>

Hi, 

I have some large data sets in the Cosmo format that I'd like to visualize with ParaView, but the format is slightly different from that expected by the built-in CosmoReader.  Because the data sets I have use a very large number of particles, they use a 64bit int for the ID tag, rather than the 32bit expected by the reader.   Looking at the source code for the reader (and HaloFinder) I see that there is an #ifdef ID_64, which if I understand correctly will compile the code using 64 bits for the particle IDs, just as I need.  So my first question is, is this understanding correct? If so, how do I configure ParaView to build with the ID_64 defined?  Is there some place that I need to add -DID_64 when running ccmake?  Also, I assume this means that it will then only read datasets with the 64bit IDs.  I do also have some data sets that use the standard 32bit ID format.  I was hoping there would be a way (via the GUI perhaps) to specify the precision of the IDs, and use the same executable, rather than maintain two builds of ParaView to accommodate the two cosmo formats.

Any insight on any of this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
joe.

Subject: [Paraview] how to add custom filter to custom menu
Message-ID: <84d19d9d4cc9104994eec24d63413b75.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

I made a custom filter and added a new dropdown menu to the main
Paraview menubar, as per wiki tutorials.
My filter works in the filters menu, and I can call the OK dialog from my
new menu.
I would like to add my filter to my new menu and have Paraview understand
it as,
and treat it just like, filters in the filter menu.
I saw this posting very relevant to my question:
http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-March/016211.html
but I'd like a little more help.

What program do I put that code snippet in ?  Do I make a special
client side plugin just to get my filter in my toolbar ?
Is there a way to do this just via XML specification ?
Note I am not developing a standalone application, I am just adding plugins
to ParaView.
If I put my filter in my custom menu, not the ParaView filters menu,
will ParaView know my plugin is a filter, eg should be added to pipeline when
invoked, only be added if datatypes match, etc etc ?

Is it a bad design to create an additional menu of filters rather than
making a sub-section in the existing filters menu ?  I just think the
current set of filters is so large it would be easier for our users to make
a separate menu.

thanks
kate

Hi,

Did you know that you could create a category in the filters menu by way 
of xml? That puts your filters in their own submenu making them easy to 
find. In your client xml you have something like:

<ParaViewFilters>
<Category name="SciberQuestSciVis" menu_label="Sciber&amp;Quest">
<Proxy group="filters" name="vtkSQDistributedStreamTracer"/>
</Category>
</ParaViewFilters>

Just checking.

Hi Kate,

There's also an easy way to create a toolbar via xml (example below, add 
"show_in_toolbar" and "icon"attributes).

<ParaViewFilters>
<Category name="Common" menu_label="&amp;Common" preserve_order="1"
     show_in_toolbar="1">
<Proxy group="filters" name="Calculator" 
icon=":/pqWidgets/Icons/pqCalculator24.png"/>
</Category>
</ParaViewFilters>

But you are asking about menus...

On the wiki there is some info about adding menus 
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Menu it's almost the same 
as adding a toolbar.There is an example of a toolbar that creates 
sources, Examples/Plugins/SourceToolbar to work from. That shows how to 
create a source but you need a filter.

The difference between creating sources and filters is that for filters 
you have to specify the filters input (see pqObjectBuilder::createFilter).

here is a snippet that would locate the selected sources. I think you 
could use this to get the source for your filter. Then it will be an 
easy change to the SourceToolbar example.

     pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
     pqServerManagerSelection sels = 
*core->getSelectionModel()->selectedItems();
     pqPipelineSource* source = 0;
     pqServerManagerModelItem* item = 0;
     if(sels.empty())
     {
         return NULL;
     }
     pqServerManagerSelection::ConstIterator iter = sels.begin();

     item = *iter;
     source = dynamic_cast<pqPipelineSource*>(item);

Sorry to be so imprecise, and note I have't tried this. Hope it helps

Hi,

Since it was so straight forward I tested it. Here is an example adding 
the menu with a filter.

Hi Burlen,

Thanks so much !!!!  I tried your code and I do get my filter in
my menu.  Your code had changes from the Examples/SourceToolbar
code that I would not have figured out.
Unfortunately my filter does have 2 mandatory inputs, so I got
a runtime error
ERROR: In
/dist/pkg/ParaView-3.10.1-src/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 727
vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (0x1843eca0): Input port 1 of algorithm
vtkIntersectRoi(0x1843db30) has 0 connections but is not optional.

as per your comment below, I think my call to builder->createFilter()
needs to be more complex
and list inputs.  Will try your snippet below.

thanks a lot for example code !
kate
