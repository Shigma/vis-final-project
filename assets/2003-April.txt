Howdy,

I was wondering if someone (Berk? Charles?) would care to comment on plans for
evolving ParaView into a client-server app.  I think I've seen this mentioned
in past posts, but maybe I was wishfully dreaming :)  If there are indeed plans
(or if it's already underway), could you share at least the rough design?

thanks,

Hi Randy,

ParaView has a client-server mode.  However, as it is, this is
mainly to allow separation between the visualization server/cluster
and a display workstation/cluster (so that the display 
workstation/cluster does not have to belong to the same MPI group
as the visualization server). The client connects to the server
using sockets. This doesn't mean that it is easy to
write your own client. The main issue is that the server is pretty
dumb. It is essentially a parallel tcl interpreter which receives
commands from the client and executes them in parallel. There is
some additional logic in there to collect things like array bounds
but it is quite limited. The client stores all the higher level
objects and generates the necessary tcl commands to be passed to
the server. Unfortunately, a lot of the higher level objects are
very closely tied with the GUI objects (sometimes, a GUI object
contains code which manages the server commands AND the user
interface). Because of this, it is not that easy to create a smarter
server or even a middle tier that does not have any GUI code.
Currently, we have no plans to work on such a separation. I think
that it would be a nice feature but our resources are limited
and we are focused on other features.

	Hi,

	I want to know why in the "Advanced Reader" MMI there is obligatorily the
field "FileName". Indeed, if we change the source file name the MMI becomes
wrong. For example I put in "standardReader.XML" an "ArraySelection" tag, so
the reader builds a menu with the name of all the arrays in the file. But if
I change the path to select a new file, the arrays menu is not update.

So my question is: how can I remove the field "FileName" ?

Thanks,
Guénolé Harel

Subject: [Paraview] VRML reader in Paraview
Message-ID: <OF12A9B637.78B05918-ONC1256D0A.00333195@grundfos.com>

Hi

For the purpose of visualizing CFD- or experimentally generated velocity
vector data on top of a CAD-generated VRML-file (of a corresponding 3D
machine geometry), I need to figure out how to import VRML-files into
Paraview.

The 'features list' of Paraview says that any VTK filter can be added by
providing a simple XML description.

But, being new to both VTK, Paraview and XML, a simple example of such an
XML code would come very handy for me at this stage. If somebody has
experience in importing VRML-files into Paraview I would be happy to get
some hints.

I know that MayaVi is capable of importing/showing VRML-files, but it is my
impression that Paraview is generally more flexible.

Any hints are welcome,

Regards,

Nicholas Pedersen

Hello Nicholas,

We do not currently have a method for using VTK Importers in ParaView.  I 
added a vtkSource to ParaView that reads VRML geometry.  This works, but 
you lose parts colors, texture maps, lights ...

I just checked in the new reader into ParaView CVS.

Charles.

Hi,

In the future, please send a copy of your questions to the ParaView
mailing list so that other users may benefit from the answers. Also,
you might want to take a look at the archives, the answer to your
question might be there.

> Currently, i'm trying to add a new forma of reader to Paraview but i find a lot of difficulties.
> Can you, please, describe me the main steps of adding  a new modules or indique me a complete tutorial.

Here is part of a message I posted to the ParaView mailing list
some time ago:

The reason we have not provided any documentation nor a DTD for 
the XML used in ParaView is that it is still changing rapidly
and that we did not want to tie ourselves to anything before
we have something we believe is final. Having said that, I can
give you some pointers:

1. When ParaView starts, it looks in a directory pointed by
the PV_INTERFACE_PATH env. variable and tries to load all
.xml files there.

2. If you compiled your own sources and filters into a separate
library, you have to tell ParaView to load it in the XML. NOTE:
You need to generate the TCL wrapped library as well. Here is
how to do it:

<ModuleInterfaces>
  <Library name="vtkMyLibraryTCL"/>
  <!-- interface description for the modules goes here-->
</ModuleInterfaces>

You also have to setup your TCLLIBPATH and PATH to include
where the library is.

3. Look at ParaView/vtkPVDefaultModules.h to see how the
modules in ParaView are done. It is a little hard to read
but should contain all the information you need. 
(Note: In the current cvs version of ParaView, vtkPVDefaultModules.h
is no more. The default configuration are stored in
ParaView/Resource/*.xml instead)

4. Keep in mind that the XML can change and you might end up
having to update your XML files in future.

Hi every body,
I'm student, needing some help.
I hae some questions about adding new modules to Paraview. 
I think there is two ways to do it.
If i consider the new module as default module, what are the makefiles do 
i have to update. The second case is to compile the new module in a 
separate library; that's what i did.the problem i found is how to built 
dynamic library to be charged in the execution.

Thanks.

Amine.

hi every body,
i'm trying to add a new source to paraview. To do so, i need to consult 
the prototypes of the existing sources.
i couldn't find the xml configuration file to be parsed for instantiate 
clones.

Can you tell me where can i find this file .

Thank you.

Bye.
