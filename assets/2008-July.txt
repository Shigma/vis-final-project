Message-ID: <21f0b0400806302346y9532d5dr5171526a54be033c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I urgently need polygonal mesh with hidden line removed functionality. Can
someone help
or tell what part of the code must be modified in order to use OpenGL
different ways of
removing hidden lines ?

I am also curious to know why such important functionality was left out in
ParaView 3.x ?

Thanks.

Hi C.!

Those are really goods news but for some of the machines, were I wan't to 
use it with MPI (openMPI) I will still need to compile it. But for all 
others I should just get the .debs :) Can I help anyway for this (meaning, 
paraview in debian).

Hi,

I just want to report the following behaviour in ParaView 3.3.0

I have to set
       <Topology Type="3DCORECTMESH" Dimensions="10 20 30"> </Topology>
to define a mesh with x*y*z = 30*20*10 nodes

I suppose that Dimensions="10 20 30" should be read as x*y*z instead of 
z*y*x.

Greetings
Jens

I don't think there's an easy way to add support for hidden line removal 
besides the work around Clint suggested.

There's a "Edge Color" widget on the display tab that can be used to 
change the edge colors.

This is not possible. You can create two different representations to 
show the surface and the wireframe and then change their parameters 
individually.

I'm currently working on a plugin that will allow you to cull backfaces in wireframe mode, which sort-of does what you want.  Do to some technical and legal reasons, I cannot release it yet, but I should be able to within a year.

It doesn't have to. ParaView uses glPolygonOffset() to offset wireframes.

I meant that it is not needed for the cvs version. I will apply a
patch to fix this to the 3.2 branch soon.

No you won't have to, mpi support is built in the debian paraview
package  and I use it all the time :)
it works great

Yup :)
you can subscribe to pkg-scicomp-{devel, commits} and join the

Hello, I have a very tiny 2d structure which is 1.0e-5 by 1.0e-5.
When I read in its unstructured mesh, I cannot see anything.

Is there a minimum size restriction, because when I blow it up 1e5
orders of magnitude it displays properly?

Message-ID: <92f19da0807011346i6f4d6b20x22a6ea8967bd2aa8@mail.gmail.com>

I have devices composed of pieces using an unstructured mesh in the
xml file format.  Some of the pieces don't have data in them.  It
appears that paraview makes up numbers for these regions.  Sometimes
the numbers are unphysical, e.g. 1e+307.  Sometimes the numbers seem
to be based on data from adjacent pieces.  Is there any way to tell
paraview to use a reasonable values in regions for which data is not
presented.

This becomes important as each region (piece) of my device can have
completely different physics.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <34375.132.236.6.70.1214946185.squirrel@webmail.cornell.edu>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to write a routine that will take all the subdomains of a set
of data and display each one with different solid colors. I wrote a
bashscript that creates a pvd file for each of these subdomains. Now I
want to try and write a python script that can take in my pvd files one by
one and display them all (on the same screen) in different colors.
However, I can not find the correct paraview function for python that
accomplishes this. Based on what I read on the python scripting wiki, I
need to use pvpython to implement this code but I cant find any routines
that allow me to insert my pvd data files. Let me know if you have any
solutions to my problem.

Cheers,

Patrick

Which mpi implementation?

here I've hand compiled the latest openmpi... with -O3 -mtune=native ... 
which are the flags I use for paraview realease althought I'm not 
absolutly convinced that the performance improves greatly just because of 
it (using the gcc suite)

Eric,

I had a need to do 2D data this week. I used a 2DCORECTMesh.
It worked in ParaView as long as the Attribute was the
same "shape" as the mesh. i.e. if the mesh was 150x100
the dimensions of the Attribute had to be "150 100" not
"15000". If I put 1D attributes on a 2D mesh I got
weirdy-boo results. I think it just matters what is in
the XML so the dimensions in HDF5 could be 15000 as long
as the XML says "150 100".

Hey All,

Has anyone ever read any XDMF data into ParaView which has the 2d XY
GeometryType?

I have a sudden need for it, and it's not working (PV sometimes loads
okay, but shows strange values for coordinates & crashes on animation).
I can track down more specifically what it's doing some other time, but
I was just curious whether anyone has ever tried it and/or gotten it to
work?

Thanks,
-Eric

Jens,

Topolgy dimensions should be listed with the slowest 
changing dimensions first. So if there are 30 X values
and we're stepping in X then Y then Z. The Dimensions="10 20 30"
is correct. Is this not what you are experiencing ?

Hi,

I just want to report the following behaviour in ParaView 3.3.0

I have to set
       <Topology Type="3DCORECTMESH" Dimensions="10 20 30"> </Topology>
to define a mesh with x*y*z = 30*20*10 nodes

I suppose that Dimensions="10 20 30" should be read as x*y*z instead of
z*y*x.

Its just a bit confusing, because everywhere (eg. DataItem) else the 
keyword "Dimensions" expects first x,y,z and not z,y,x

I think "Dimensions" should behave always the same.

if it's too advanced for a book, i'll assume it's too advance for an email

anyone know how to do what is mentioned in the footnote?

 er, well that's a negative.

the document you point to is the same thing that's in the book.
also has the same footnote.

while Fetch will do this, the footnote implies that there is 
a more advanced (sly) way of doing this when in built-in mode,
else why have the footnote at all?

color me curious.

It is required that all pieces in an XML unstructured file have the
exact same set of arrays. It is by coincidence that you are
experiencing crashes. You need to use multi-block dataset to group
together pieces with different fields. You may want to look at using
the XML-based multi-block file format (vtm extension) or EnSight
format for this. The former is not well documented yet, I am afraid.

Yes, loaded a raw dataset (1024x943x50) of unsigned char. Visualized 
using volume (not sure which volume class I was using - whatever the 
default is). I did by mistake initially set the bounds 0-1024,0-943,0-50 
which appeared to have the issue you mentioned (although it could have 
been that it appeared to have the minimum) until I realized that the 
bounds were incorrect.

Thanks, that is very helpful!

I tried both the raw data and the VTK reader. I am sure I got the bounds correct since, after passing the data through the Calculator, the display was correct. Calculator merely changed the values from char to double.

I'm using ParaView from CVS on 6/25; which version are you using?

When I was running this data, I was using paraview-3.2.1 and 3.2.2. I 
haven't had much success with ParaView from CVS checked out 2008-06-27 
09:15. Seems to be unstable (crashes a lot) and only reason I checked it 
out was to access some time data which is accessible with the python 
interface for a study we are running.

paraview-3.2.2 should give you good results for the volume if that is 
all you are doing. I tried adding a single slice to the volume mentioned 
earlier and I waited more than an hour, watching top to see that it used 
up all available physical ram (~4GB) and 7.5GB of swap before the system 
crashed without a single update to the window. I also tried adding a 
threshold filter which had the same issue. This was on a 64 bit centos5 
machine, with python binding and openmpi though it was only running 
locally, built from scratch as a release build. Hopefully you won't have 
a similar issue if you try it out.

I bring up paraview, create several cut, save screen shots, ...etc.

question:
 in 3.0.2 how do I save what I did in a script and run it in the batch mode?
It was quite easy in version 2.4

Hi all,

I'm would like to plot a 3D surface from x y z ascii data with x and y being 
the coordinates in 2D and z the value of scalar wich I want to be plotted 
like a surface in the third dimension.

I have already look in the mailing list but I'm not able to make this kind of 
plot. 

Any ideas ?
Thanks

I am not sure ParaView 3.0.2 came with pvbatch. However, 3.2.* and the 
CVS does include a python based pvbatch.

Take a look at:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf

This document has a section on loading states in python.

Hi All,


Is there a way to set a field data array to be the active 
scalars/vectors in ParaView?


For instance in the tube filter, I would like to tell pv which data 
array to use to vary the radius by scalar.

Maybe there are also other filters, which use the field data and by 
default take the active one.
By default the active one seems to be the first one, I think.

Any hints would be appreciated,

Bryn

Message-ID: <43283.132.236.6.70.1215090609.squirrel@webmail.cornell.edu>

Hello all,

I asked a similar question before this, however, no one responded.

Is it possible to load python files into Paraview from the terminal?
Something along the lines of 'paraview -cl code.py' (pretending that the
cl option would load this python script directly into paraview.)

Also, I have been looking over some of the functions that paraview has
built into python, but I could not find one that can loads pvd files. Is
it possible to do this? Let me know.

Cheers,

Patrick

Generally the filter's properties panel should show the user a combo-box 
where the user can choose the array. There's seems to be a oversight 
with the tube filter. Let me take a look.

There is no such option currently available. Please feel free to add a 
feature request to the bug tracker for the same at 
http://www.paraview.org/Bug

http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf describes how to 
create readers. You'll need to use the "PVDReader" 
(sources.PVDReader()). Here's a simple example:

import paraview.servermanager
sm = paraview.servermanager
sm.Connect()
reader = sm.sources.PVDReader(FileName="/tmp/foo.pvd")
view = sm.CreateRenderView()
repr = sm.CreateRepresentation(reader, view)
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()

Here's the way to do it (note: this will work only in CVS version. For 
older versions there's another more complex way of doing it):


import paraview.servermanager as sm
sm.Connect()
sphereSource = sm.sources.SphereSource()
sphereSource.UpdatePipeline()

vtksphereSource = sphereSource.GetClientSideObject()
        # <--- returns vtkSphereSource instance

vtksphereSource.GetOutput()

There is no way to set the active scalars or vectors.  Rather, you are supposed to be able to select them directly in the object inspector.  The issue with the tube filter is already a registered bug that was reported several months ago:

  http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=6208

This is at least one more instance of a similar problem with the gradients filters.  Those are the only ones that I am aware of.

Hi All,


Is there a way to set a field data array to be the active
scalars/vectors in ParaView?


For instance in the tube filter, I would like to tell pv which data
array to use to vary the radius by scalar.

Maybe there are also other filters, which use the field data and by
default take the active one.
By default the active one seems to be the first one, I think.

Any hints would be appreciated,

Bryn

Hey Jerry,

Thanks for the reply on this, and thanks for the tips.

I forgot to mention it at the time, but both examples I tried had  
"unstructured" topologies -- Polyvertex and Polygon. Since the  
structured and unstructured cases are handled separately, this at  
least narrows things down a bit more.

My current need for this has subsided for a bit, so I probably won't  
get around to playing with it more for a while, but I'm sure it will  
come up again one of these days, and then I'll spend more time  
narrowing down the problems I was having.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

No, I am afraid it did not make into the documentation yet. It is easy
to create an example using ParaView. Load 2 unstructured grids, group
them together using the Group filter and then write the output as a
vtm file.

I have EnSight data consisting of sphere center locations (coords.geo)  
with time dependent temperature data (temps.temperature).  Attached is  
a HCP lattice of 113 spheres in 2 time steps (colored by  
temperature).  Adding sphere glyphs with a scale factor of 1 shows the  
correct data.  The files import correctly, paraview recognizes the  
temperature array and the time step information.

However when I try to run the animation, paraview crashes.  Am I doing  
something incorrectly?  I know my coordinates aren't in scientific  
notation, but should that matter?

Thanks!  It is racking my brain!
Mike

While I am learning about this new format.  Would it be reasonable for
me to file a request that data arrays be initialized to zero in
regions they are not specified?  If not possible, would it be more
reasonable to file a request that the software warns people that
paraview will not initialize data arrays?

Thanks,

Juan

This might be related to bug: http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=7253 , 
which is fixed on the current cvs version of ParaView.

I tried this and it created a vtm file, a directory, and a file in the
directory.  I could see places where there are a log of "nans" and
1e307's.  Can paraview read nan's and what does it do with them.

  Is there anyway to create a flat file format for a vtm file?

Is the ensight format any easier, or just superior?  Any
recommendations for a format appreciated.

Requirements:
1. Different regions (or pieces) have different data arrays with
completely unrelated names.

Optional (But would be really, really nice):
1. Documented
2. Single file format
3. Different elements in the same region (lines, triangles), and
having completely different data arrays per element type.

Thanks,

Juan

This is definitely a bug. It looks like the XML parser is screwing up
something. After loading the example data you sent me, if you look at
the number of cells and points, they don't even match what is in the
file.

Message-ID: <c9adba420807040750l4d4541aet3044c84ae82565b7@mail.gmail.com>

I've read on the list that it is possible to create 3D widgets as plugins:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-March/007315.html

I have attempted this using the LineWidgetSource in the ParaView
source code.  I just search for all files relating the the line widget
and renamed all files and classes.  Then I tried to make plugins for
it.  The plugins it creates does not seem to use the pq* classes.
Have I missed something in the XML?  I have attached my source code.

[Note: My aim is to create a widget for moving points in a structured
mesh - hence MoveableMesh!]

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

Are you running the animation from python? The error you are getting
seems to indicate so.

I am not an expert in EnSight file format but these files look wrong.
The geo file has only 1 time step but the case file says it has two
(file set 1). I can get it to work with something like:

FORMAT
type:  ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model: 1 2 coords.geo

VARIABLE
scalar per node:      1   1     temperature temps.temperature

TIME
time set:	1	temps
number of steps:	2
time values:	0 1

FILE
file set:	1
number of steps:	2
file set: 2
number of steps: 1

If I were you, I would use not use file sets but stick to 1 file per
time step and use wild cards (the geometry can still be static). This
is more efficient because the reader does not have to search in the
file for consecutive time steps. See the EnSight documentation for

The recognized 3d widget sub-panels that get embeded in an object panel are 
hardcoded in ParaView.  I had to make my own object panel to get my 3d widget 
sub-panels to show up, and you could do the same.  The hardcoding probably 
needs to be removed and replaced with something that allows customizing.

Clinton,

Did you actually manage to get your own 3d widget as a plugin or were
you reusing an existing one?  I'm still unsure how to get this
working.  Do you have any example code for it?

Thanks,
Paul

I used the vtkContourWidget with my own subclass of 
vtkOrientedGlyphContourRepresentation, so I wasn't doing it from scratch.
However, ParaView didn't have any support for that so integrating it into 
ParaView would be the same as any other made from scratch.

And I had to make my own pqObjectPanel anyways, so that's how I got it in 
ParaView.

Hi,
I upgraded from ParaView-2.6.1 to ParaView-3.2.2 on our stereo wall 
(CentOS linux built with openmpi). After updating our command line 
script and adding a default_servers.pvsc file I am finally able to 
connect to the pvserver running on localhost. Unfortunately, it is not 
creating a window on the :0.1 screen. Any idea what I might be doing 
wrong? Or is there an easier way to render on the second screen? We want 
a client on screen 0 and a full screen window on screen 1 which used to 
work in PV-2.6.1. Stereo 3 is enabled in X for the screen 1 not on the 
screen 0. Pertinent files shown below (note - the lines commented with # 
showing the filename are not part of the actual files):

Subject: [Paraview] Library not loading due to reason "image not found".
Message-ID: <752890.44828.qm@web59502.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello,

As a practice exercise in making readers for Paraview 3.2.2, I wrote a reader that loads the specifications of a cube with different colors for the vertexes.

When I try to load the libSMCubeReader.dylib into the server side plugin manager, I get the message "Library not loaded:  libvtkPVFiltersCS.dylib referenced from <path omitted>/Paraview_build/bin/libSMCubeReader.dylib Reason: image not found."

When loading the client side plugin I get the message from QLibrary::load_sys cannot load <path omitted>/Paraview_build/bin/libGUICubeReader.dylib: "Library not loaded:  libpqComponents.dylib Referenced from <path omitted>/Paraview_build/bin/libGUICubeReader.dylib Reason: image not found"

I'm on a PowerBook G4 Macintosh with 2 Gb RAM, building ParaView from Unix-style makefiles on XCode 2.4.1 under MacOSX 10.4.11 using dynamic library linkage in DEBUG mode.

Message-ID: <01fb01c8e0db$79a957e0$6cfc07a0$@de>

Hi
Unfortunately this an feature that we like to see for a few years now:

Reloading a file

Even having a multi step pvd files doesn't fix that problem (when existing
files get overridden...).
Seems to be one of the hardest problems at all and I'm wondering why this
isn't a problem to other groups...

In Paraview 2.6.x this could be done by a little trick (just renaming the
file twice). But this one doesn't work since 3.x.

Our cluster has 3.0.2 running as the server
my workstation has 3.0.2 as client

The client fails with the message "cannot connect to server."
However the client sees the files on the server.

Question: Has anyone used 3.0.2 mpi and does it run correctly?

can  you set everything up in paraview (workflow and all) then save a  
"Paraview session" file. Then "delete" your entire workflow, and load  
the saved session file when the sim is complete.

Are you sure the client can connect to port 11111 (which is the default) 
on the server machine? Can you try telnet-ing to that port or something?

Will try. I forgot to mention that the file creation was made using 
32-procs but only 4-proc are used for the paraview. I don't believe this 
could cause a problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmatically setting 2D chart properties
Message-ID: <31EC00E6-DF7C-40BE-B439-76B3EE63BF78@imts.us>

Are there any API's yet in ParaView CVS where I can set some  
properties of the 2D charts that are the result of loading a  
vtkRectilinearGrid data set? Some of the properties I am interested  
in are setting the legend to OFF and adding a title instead and more  
control over the default set of data that gets plotted.

For example I have a data set that has the value "Cycle Values" as  
its x-axis and then I have 13 sets of Y-Axis data. Lets call the  
first of those Y-Values "Total Dislocation Density". For the 2D chart  
I would like to just see the "Cycle Values Vs Total Dislocation  
Density" plot. I am not interested in the other 12 sets of Y Data  
initially. How would I go about setting that up?

Thanks for any help.

Message-ID: <F325BA04-FD92-40B6-98AA-7387A22C1F90@imts.us>

Is there a facility in ParaView CVS that would allow me to set a  
named meta-data value in the vtkPolyData object? I have some values  
that I would like to filter on (I am writing a custom reader) and I  
really only need to store a single 3 value vector of data into the  
vtkPolyData object. It isn't necessary to store the value on each  
cell or each point as it is the same value everywhere.

Thanks for any help.

Message-ID: <C498C8E4.3F87%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Is pvserver creating a window on the first screen?  It could be that the
DISPLAY environment is not being set right.  That would probably be a bug in
the pvx file processing, but you should be able to get around it by passing
a -display flag to the pvserver program.

HI,
    I also used the "trick" of renaming the file in the old version to  
do this all the time.
It was a nice little feature when watching a simulation evolve.
It would be great to have a reload button to do this.

Thanks for all the great work...

It sounds like the system cannot find some dependent dynamic libraries for
some reason.  You could try setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable to point to the libraries.  What does otool -L report your plugin
libraries need to reference?

Try building ParaView with "RPATH ON" for OS X. OR do as Ken writes  
and you will need to set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to the <path omitted>/ 
Paraview_build/bin/ directory.

<history/informatio>
   OS X has the notion of the "install_name" for dylibs. OS X will  
encode the path to the library inside the actual library itself so  
when another library or application links to the library the  
application/library will know where to find it thus obviating the  
need for the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. This is good and bad. Good because  
you shouldn't have to set environment variables. BAD because if you  
move those libraries somewhere else then everything breaks.

There are "special" install_name prefixes that can be used to get  
around all this but I think in your case you need to rerun ccmake and  
set the VTK_USE_RPATH to ON.

OR you can run paraview FROM the <path omitted>/Paraview_build/bin/  
directory. OS X will always look in the current directory for dylibs.

so from a terminal your session might look like the following:

$ make
$ cd bin
$ paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview

{ParaView should now launch}.

Try all that and let's see what happens.

A coworker helped my solve the problem by setting the ld path to ./ and selecting the plugin directly from the bundle.

Let me try to answer your questions.

> 3. Different elements in the same region (lines, triangles), and
> having completely different data arrays per element type.

There is no file format that supports this because VTK/ParaView does
not support it. The best way of achieving it is to write a different
block per cell type that has different arrays.

> I tried this and it created a vtm file, a directory, and a file in the

No. ParaView cannot read or handle nans. Nor does it support a concept
of invalid value. All values of an arrays have to be defined. The only
exception to this is the concept of "blanking" for structured grids
(which blanks a whole point/cell not mark a value invalid).

>  Is there anyway to create a flat file format for a vtm file?

No.

> recommendations for a format appreciated.

Writing Ensight is definitely easier. Whether it is superior or not
depends on your use case.

You should look into the following formats:

Ensight. See http://www.ensight.com/downloads/cat_view-82.html for
documentation.
* It is well documented
* Supports multiple blocks/parts
* Easy to read/write
* It is not a single file format

Exodus. See http://endo.sandia.gov/SEACAS/Documentation/exodusII.pdf
* It is well documented
* Supports multiple blocks/parts
* Requires a library to read/write
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii). It uses netcdf under the
covers so you can directly the netcdf library too
* It is a single file format

Xdmf: See xdmf.org
* It is somewhat well documented
* Supports multiple blocks/parts
* Requiers library (HDF5) to read/write
* Each dataset is usually 2 files (one xml, one hdf5)

Yes. Create a new data array (with the appropriate name) and add it to
the FieldData. Something like:

vtkFloatArray* newarray = vtkFloatArray::New();
newarray->SetName("foo");

vtkFieldData* fd = vtkFieldData::New();
fd->AddArray(newarray);

output->SetFieldData(fd);

newarray->Delete();
fd->Delete();

The field data is automatically propagated by the pipeline and will be
accessible to all filters downstream.

Suggestions? Not a one ;-) I was hoping there might already be  
something already in ParaView.

So at this point I guess I could add to my custom reader a client  
side plugin that allows the user to select which arrays are read,  
which effectively sets which values are plotted. I think that might  
work.

The solution to the other problem will probably involve some hacking  
in the charting code to disable the automatic legend generation and  
add a title instead.


I guess there could be some named keys in the vtkInformation object  
to set the properties on the chart? Not sure as I am not that  
familiar with the server <--> client communications.

I like the Qt GUI for the 2D plots and would hate to re-implement  
that in a client plugin but I might have to. My co-worker and I will  
keep digging to try and figure out what will work for our customer.

Thanks for the quick reply.

can  you set everything up in paraview (workflow and all) then save a

I did insert a similar report yesterday 0007298
(I had some problems with mailcleaner treating the confirmation email as
junk...).
I also think a reload button would help.

I tried this and for me it is not working. The saved session also stores
the timesteps, therefore the new timesteps are ignored and/or an error
occours.

Message-ID: <4873A060.7080700@iws.uni-stuttgart.de>

Dear Paraview developers,

if I have symmetric point data on a quadrilateral grid, it gets 
displayed like it was unsymmetric. Due to the fact that it is internally 
interpolated onto triangles in a non-symmetric way. Is there a way to 
display the data in surface style as it should be (without converting it 
to cell data)?

I have attached a file where this happens.

Thank you very much for your answer (and for providing such a great 
software)
Bernd

Subject: [Paraview] stereo wall configuration

Only the client is displaying on :0.0 and nothing on :0.1. I didn't see 
a -display option when I ran pvserver with --help but I tried it anyway. 
Both -display=:0.1 and --display=:0.1 resulted in the usage information 
being printed out rather than starting the pvserver.

Thinking back on it, I did see a dialog box the first time I got the 
client to connect to the server which said something about a bad X 
connection. Unfortunately, subsequent attempts to read the message fail 
because the dialog box appears and disappears almost immediately (no 
okay button) - nothing is shown in the output window to specify what 
error may have occurred and nothing shows on the command line where the 
pvserver or paraview client were run except "Client connected.".

If there is a bad X connection, there should not be as I can simply run 
`DISPLAY=:0.1 xterm` from a terminal in :0.0 and an xterm will appear in 
:0.1. I do have the Composite extension disabled which is necessary to 
run active stereo (PV built with this->StereoType = 
VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES;) and the xorg.conf does have Option "Stereo" 
"3" for screen 1 and is not present for screen 0. Also, I can run active 
stereo in other applications such as VMD with the visual being displayed 
on the :0.1 display.

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Pat

Hello,

Thanks for answering my question.  I tried implementing a multi-group
file setup with the vtu files in the same directory as the vtm file.
Here is my vtm file:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="vtkMultiGroupDataSet" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" com
pressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <vtkMultiGroupDataSet>
    <DataSet group="0" dataset="0" file="mos_2d_0.vtu"/>
    <DataSet group="1" dataset="0" file="mos_2d_1.vtu"/>
    <DataSet group="2" dataset="0" file="mos_2d_2.vtu"/>
    <DataSet group="3" dataset="0" file="mos_2d_3.vtu"/>
  </vtkMultiGroupDataSet>
</VTKFile>

Where I assume that incrementing the group number is more important
than incrementing the dataset number.

However mos_2d_1.vtu and mos_2d_2.vtu have fields which I can not
access (do not appear) in paraview when I load the vtm file.  If I
load the files individually, I can see the fields I need just fine.  I
know the files are being loaded properly since the grid is complete.

How can I assure that all the fields for all the groups are accessible?

Regards,

Juan

Message-ID: <92f19da0807081108x58319d0w5ef6f43cf02f395f@mail.gmail.com>

When I try to view a color map logarithmically, I get the following error:
ERROR: In /home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkLookupTable.cxx,
line 120
vtkLookupTable (0x8ff2ae0): Bad table range for log scale: [-1e+15,
9.999e+18], adjusting to [1, 10]

Would it be reasonable to request that the log option for the colormap
takes the absolute value of the quantity for which the log is taken?

Thanks,

Juan

In semiconductor devices, the net doping is a signed quantity which
can very exponentially.  It is typical in most device simulation
packages as it refers to the signed number of donors (positive) and
acceptors (negative).

Other candidates for a colormap options would be a "Use log of the
absolute value", or even "Use asinh scale".

Juan

I didn't mean "do your data values make sense"; I'm sure they do.

What I questioned is whether changing the lower bound of the log color scale as you suggest makes sense.

Remember, changing the color scale does not change the data -- the original values, both positive and negative, will be passed through the color lookup table to find their color.

I think with the change you suggest all values from -1e+15 to +1e+15 would get the same color, the one for +1e+15. The colors would only vary between +1+e15 an 9.999e+18. Does that make sense?

If you want to work with the absolute value of your data first pass it through the Calculator and take the absolute value. If needed also set a floor so values don't get too close to 0 where the log blows up.

Actually the data would vary between 0 and 1e19.  In my example, the
donor doping varies between 0 and 1e19.

Using an asinh filter, as opposed to log(abs()) filter, would ensure
that the data would never blow up.  A log(abs(x) + 1e-308) filter
would also never blow up.

I think this would be a nice feature for the program as a checkbox, as
opposed to requiring the use of the calculator each time.  I'll file
an enhancement request.

Regards,

Juan

Ok,

Compiling the cvs version and replacing vtkMultiGroupDataSet with
MultiBlockDataSet seems to fix the problem.

Thanks, Samuel, for the quick reply.  I suppose I do not.  I didn't see
it as a requirement on the ParaView download page.

Sorry for these fundamental questions, but I'm not the person that's
going to be using this application, nor do I have much of a clue what it
does.  I'm just the measly IT guy who's been tasked with getting it to
work. :-)  What is mesa and where do I get it?  Which version should I
get?  Also, if you could give me the name of one of mesa's main files, I
can search for a Debian package of it.  Many thanks!

Hello !

i tryed about all the same steps as you did (Cave render modul), 
at the end a got the answere that it is simply not supported in Paraview 3.X .There are so many descriptios on the web about paraview and it's switches,
just dont trust any of them, only the one from paraview itselfe is  true.
Also the help from pvclient or pvserver or paraview itselfe is not complety true, there are many many 
switches which are simply not documentet or not true.
I myselfe stick to old 2.6 Version also ist old ist working.

I believe this is a different message from the one I had seen when I 
first connected to the pvserver on our stereo wall though very similar 
but I am fairly certain it closed of its own accord. The attached file 
is the warning from our 4 wall cave where the client and each server (1 
per wall) is running on a separate machine. The xhost program is used to 
allow X server connections between the console/client machine and the 
display/server machines. Each of the 4 machines where the pvserver is 
running is running xinit in run level 3 with an xclock without kdm or 
gdm. From the console machine I am able to run xterm or any other X 
based program to the displays of the other 4 machines without an issue 
which will show on the CAVE wall. I can also ssh into any of those 
machines and set the DISPLAY to :0.0 and run an X app which will show on 
the CAVE wall. So, the display should be accessible to any local process 
whether created by mpirun (which is using ssh to get to those machines) 
or otherwise.

Subject: [Paraview] multi block crash
Message-ID: <92f19da0807090858v10239aa9nceb78c11612d2a41@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Could someone verify the proper multiblock format for a vtm file:

This one crashes:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="vtkMultiBlockDataSet" version="0.1"
byte_order="LittleEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
    <DataSet group="0" dataset="0" file="mos_2d_0.vtu"/>
    <DataSet group="1" dataset="1" file="mos_2d_1.vtu"/>
    <DataSet group="2" dataset="2" file="mos_2d_2.vtu"/>
    <DataSet group="3" dataset="3" file="mos_2d_3.vtu"/>
  </vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
</VTKFile>

with:

paraview: /home/jsanchez/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx:347:
virtual void vtkXMLDataReader::SetupOutputData(): Assertion
`this->NumberOfPointArrays ==
this->PointDataArraySelection->GetNumberOfArraysEnabled()' failed.
Abort

This one shows no data:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="vtkMultiBlockDataSet" version="0.1"
byte_order="LittleEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
    <DataSet index="0" file="mos_2d_0.vtu"/>
    <DataSet index="1" file="mos_2d_1.vtu"/>
    <DataSet index="2" file="mos_2d_2.vtu"/>
    <DataSet index="3" file="mos_2d_3.vtu"/>
  </vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
</VTKFile>

Loading the individual files works fine.  I could have sworn the one
that crashes worked fine yesterday.

I am using the latest CVS.

Thanks,

Juan

Juan,

The error concerns the point data arrays. Those are in your vtu files not the vtm file; therefore, I would take another look at the vtu files. Did you update from CVS since when you thought these files could be read?

I was compiling on two different computers with cvs updates at two
different times.  This is the first time trying to use paraview on
this machine, but it worked on the other.  It looks like there is a
lot of stuff going on in cvs this morning, so I am recompiling again.

Just recompiled and it's still crashing.  Since the vtu files are
loading properly on an individual basis, I think it must be the vtm
file.

Since it is undocumented, and apparently still changing, could someone
please tell me what the proper format is from the examples I have
below.

Regards,

Juan

If you have an nvidia card, I'd suggest using the nvidia gl libraries.
 If you don't I guess the mesa one would do.

Sorry.  I see that the -display parameter option was added after the 3.2 release.  You could try the env program to directly set the DISPLAY parameter.

  env DISPLAY=:0.1 pvserver ...

It sounds like you have the VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA option turned on. If
this is intentional, you should set OSMESA_LIBRARY to the right
library. I don't know what the library is called in debian. If this is
not intentional, make sure to turn that option off.

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling changes into Paraview
Message-ID: <841140.98892.qm@web59507.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I've written a practice reader called "CubeReader" and compiled it into Paraview by adding its directory to the appropriate command in the .cmake file in the parent directory of ~/Documents/Paraview3.2.2/Examples/Plugins/CubeReader/ .  It doesn't work right so I made changes to the source of the CubeReader.  Now how do I get the makefiles generated by CMake to recognize the changes to the source and link in the new version of the object codes?

My system is a Macintosh PowerBook G4 with 2 Gb of RAM running MacOSX 10.4.11.

If you want to compile your reader directly into ParaView then you  
probably want to use the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE setting while  
running ccmake in paraview.

Take a look at <http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend> and then  
under the title "Include new reader, writer, source, or algorithm  
during compile time"

If my firewall will let you, take a look at http://titanium.imts.us/ 
viewvc/Task_4/PVRoboMet/ for a project that I worked on earlier this  
year.

I think I know the problem.  At home I used:
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release

But my laptop did not.

Using Release sets NDEBUG which removes assertions from the compiled
software.  Apparently for MultiBlock datasets, the assertion:
ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx:347:
>>> virtual void vtkXMLDataReader::SetupOutputData(): Assertion
>>> `this->NumberOfPointArrays ==
>>> this->PointDataArraySelection->GetNumberOfArraysEnabled()' failed.
>>> Abort

May not be valid.  Would it be possible to remove this assertion from the code?

Thanks,

Juan

I was building the latest source today from scratch and got this error.
I fixed it by including stdlib.h. Has anyone else had to do this?

In C++ you need to forward declare all functions being called.  This
file looks like it was originally written in C, and that language
allows you to call functions you haven't declared.

cstdlib is more appropriate for modern C++ compilers, but stdlib.h
would work just as well.

Regards,

Juan

Actually, the code was originally written in C++.  A reorganization in
the gcc/g++ headers caused this failure. In the past, stdlib.h was
included indirectly by other system headers. This is no longer the
case.

Unfortunately that also did not work. I'll go back to 2.6.1 for now and 
test out the next release whenever it comes out.

Thanks,
Pat

Hi

We have patched the Paraview3.2.1 source with the patch Berk uploaded. It
did solve the problem.
We are facing another problem when compiling to 36%.

Subject: [Paraview] Fluent files breaking ParaView?
Message-ID: <D8E88DC4572A42A383F1459320E7EB96@grimoire>

Hi,

I've just built the CVS wavefront (this morning, in fact) of ParaView on our
cluster (8 of dual-core dual-socket opteron, each with 8Gb memory and NVidia
fx4500 GPUs, running RHEL 4, update 6). I launched the latest Windows
client, and fed it a FLUENT datafile. I've built the MPI version (using
voltaire's stack), and run it across 8 nodes. Each node is launched as a
"pvserver". Started up fine, started reading the file...

After a long delay, ParaView blew with an "out of memory" error. Oh my
goodness, it had tried using ~8Gb of memory on each node. Detail as follows:

----8<--------8<--------8<----
Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In
/sge/share/common/ParaView-cvs/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx
, line 1281
vtkProcessModule (0x38c6d80): Exception: Insufficient memory exception.
----8<--------8<--------8<----

The original FLUENT file was (allegedly) ~400k points. Cas file was 38Mb,
dat file was ~300Mb. Also tried another large FLUENT file (47Mb CAS, 35Mb
DAT), similar result:

----8<--------8<--------8<----
Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In
/sge/share/common/ParaView-cvs/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx
, line 1281
vtkProcessModule (0x38c6d80): Exception: Insufficient memory exception.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc
[mpirund] rank 5 has got signal 6
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc
----8<--------8<--------8<----

Has anyone else tried large FLUENT datasets? Any advice gratefully
appreciated, we're trying to view these files as a favour, so I have pretty
much 0 idea of what's in them until I can actually visualize them...

Should I try running several render servers and separate data servers?

Thanks!

Ian

I can't comment much on the fluent reader in paraview/vtk cvs, but I 
found it to be completely useless on anything we use.

We had a number of simulations that were run on 16-64 processes using 
fluent, so I created a fluent reader of our own from some code one of my 
colleagues used with AVS. The main thing is that it parses the Partition 
table before loading any cells/faces and does not load anything that is 
not intended for a given processor. (Assuming the original fluent run 
was done on a multiprocessor system). It also, uses a much simpler 
memory allocation strategy, and only makes space for the cells/faces 
that are actually read. If the number of pvserver nodes is less than the 
number of original partitions in the fluent data then it'll double up on 
some nodes.

The downside is that I have stripped out all information from the file, 
except volumes. Boundaries, surfaces, etc etc are all dropped. We load 
3D cells and nothing else.

You can build it as a plugin from svn here 
https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/vtkFluent/

When loading in parallel, I am able to load models up to 20 million 
cells (tets+hex+prism) (I do not have anything larger yet),
NB. when testing on low memory machines, I set #define LIMIT_PARTITIONS 
in the cxx file to some positive number, this forces us to only load a 
fraction of the data. make sure this is commented out if you only see 
part of the data.

If it helps you, then wonderful. If not, I haven't got time to help! 
(I've had far too many emails for other modules I've made available and 
I'm fed up with it!).

Subject: [Paraview] Fluent files breaking ParaView?
In-Reply-To: <48760861.4070208@cscs.ch>

Following up on my own post. I'd like to also add that
1) The fluent file format is terrible. Everything is stored in a string 
like object which you have to parse to find out if it is useful, and 
since the length of it is not usually known, if it isn't useful, you 
can't easily skip it, you have to parse for the end of stream sequences.

2) Every node has to read the whole cas/dat file pair in order to find 
the stuff it needs. There are no hints anywhere, and the partition 
tables are stored in the file after the cell/face definitions, meaning 
you have to read the bloody thing twice - or waste memory on the first run.
Anyway, this means running our fluent reader on 16 nodes, each reading a 
1GB file, results in horrendous IO bottleneck. I recently ran an 
animation on our data using many nodes and looping over time, so files 
were read and then later re-read. It took days and days. The reader is 
dreadfully inefficient, its still an order of magnitude better than CVS, 
but the format itself is the main problem.

Interesting that these commercial CFD codes (CFX/Fluent) produce such 
awful files with badly documented APIs/formats and inefficient storage.

I'd choose HDF any day, given the choice.

Subject: [Paraview] Error "installing" on Windows XP with CVS Version
Message-ID: <5A72A9CA1369C742936CDB256CE8CFE9126B6C@exchange1.fairmont.imts.us>

I used cmake 2.6 to generate VS2005 project files for ParaView CVS from this morning. The compile proceeds until I try to build the "install" target. At that point I get the following error.
40>-- Installing: C:/Developer/Toolkits/ParaView3-VS2005/bin/QTASSISTANTCLIENT4.dll

It looks like the path to QtAssistant is NOT built up correctly. Just my guess.
 
Any one else having this problem?

> Which mpi implementation?

With very few changes I have been able to compile a debian paraview
package for etch-amd64
At http://iacs.epfl.ch/~deparis/debian/paraview/ you find the package,
which depends, among others, on mpich-bin, and several packages (ffmpeg)
that I had to compile and install too.

In changes.txt there is a short description of whart I had to do to
build the package starting from the tasting source package. The file
control is the only file that I changed in the source tree.

Please note that these packages are tested only on my machine ;-)

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf and hdf5
Message-ID: <48776502.5010005@epfl.ch>

Hi,

I am struggling with hdf5 and xdmf. I would like to use hdf5 as
postprocessing files for our parallel simulations. I did find some help
on the net, but I am still far from my goal.

I have time independent mesh, say two tetrahedra, and time dependent
data, say velocity fields defined on the vertices.

To start with, I take the steady case. The xmf file is prova.xmf (sure,
I speek italian ;-) ) and the hdf5 file is prova.h5.
I can load it with paraview 3.2.2 (compiled locally with mpi and 64 bit
support, cf
http://iacs.epfl.ch/~deparis/debian/paraview/ and previous email)

paraview --data=$PWD/prova.xmf &

The first issue is that I can not load it with paraview 3.2.1 nor 3.3.0
precompiled and distributed on paraview.org (both on a amd64 linux box
nor on a mac). Does someone have a hint, please?

The second issue, is that I can not have time dependent data. I do not
know if I am just writing wrong my xmf file (provaTime.xmf), or if
something else is missing. Note that I define the same goemtry, without
any attributes. The file loads but paraview does not recognise the time
dependence :-( (the time variable is not set in the "information")

Thank you for yor help
best
Simone

Hi Simone,

for the time dependent data, you just need to create a temporal 
collection. I'm forwarding a message that Jerry Clarke sent to me 
explaining how it's done.

I hope it helps you

Hi Renato,

Thank you for your answer, but I feel that that's what I tried to
implement in provaTime.xmf:

  <Grid Name="Cube Grid" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">

     <Time TimeType="List">
     <DataItem Format="XML" NumberType="Float" Dimensions="2">
            0.0123 0.0246
     </DataItem>
    </Time>

    <Grid Name="Cube Grid 1">

Taking a very fast look, it seems that you have a typo in your file

DataFile;:/PointsX/Values --> it should not have a ";:", it should be 
just ":"

I'm sending an example file that I made when was learning about XDMF

[]'s

Hello,

I am using latest ParaView 3.2.1 and I was trying to create one triangulated
cylinder.  I created one cylinder using its "Sources" Menu and then
"Triangulate", "SubDivision" "Tesselate" tools from filters menu. But none
of these tools produced triangulated surface which I was expecting.

Can someone give some hints ?

              Hi everyone, Some days ago, I successfully built Paraview on
Linux clusters.

              Recently I have tried to build Paraview on Windows XP, yet it
successed. But there  was some problem.

              I use the XP chinese version, and the built paraview.exe could
run ,  but the MainMenu bar had gone.

              And right click the mouse, the pop menu show very small word
that could hardly seen.

              Before the paraview launched, there was a dialog gave the
error message like :

              QFontEngineWin:GetTextMetrics() failed:

              At the same time, I add the <QTextCodec> head file and add
some init code , the Chinese word could be shown. But tha above

              problem still there.

              Ask for help....

             Thanks

             Best wishes!

  All the best !

   Gang.

Subject: [Paraview] Mesa tests failing
Message-ID: <200807130913.21612.hobbsk@ohiou.edu>

I have builds of VTK and ParaView using mesa from the git repository.

These are the builds Linux-gcc-4.3.0-x86_64-mesa from murron on the VTK and 
ParaView dashboards.

Almost all of the mesa tests fail, but what is displayed on the screen  as the 
tests are running looks fine.

The test images look like every other line is pushed farther and farther to 
the right, or like they have vertical rainbow streaks, or speckled...

See:
http://www.cdash.org/CDash/testDetails.php?test=6192138&build=122269

When I render in ParaView everthing looks good but when I saved a screenshot I 
got the rainbow effect.

Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

This computer runs Fedora 9.

The Mesa that VTK and ParaView are built against is built with:

# Update Mesa
cd /home/kevin/mesa
make realclean
git pull origin
make linux-x86-64

Hello,

I have been using ParaView 3.2.1 for more than a month. 2-3 days, I was
doing some
experiements with various tools, and I don't remember what I did, but now I
am unable
to display any object. When I load new file, it always show in hidden mode.
Reinstalling
paraview also didn't help. May be somewhere the global properties are set in
paraview
and and were not deleted while uninstalling ParaView and therefore new
installation
is getting the previous settings.

Thanks.

On linux, I periodically delete the .config/Paraview directory as I
frequently find Paraview in an unusable state.

paraview   --disable-registry

also seems to work.  But paraview will start rereading persistent data
the next time that option is not used.

Hi, thanks for the help, we have managed to compile paraview on 64 bit, we
are now facing another problem.

Does combining both 32bit machine and 64bit machine as pvserver work ?
tried several times combining both frodo(64bit) and quadcore(32bit) as
pvserver.
they were listening.. but when we use another pc as the client to connect to
them, the client hangs..

&DataFile; replaces the entity
<ENTITY DataFile "prova.h5">

hence &DataFile; is identical to prova.h5.


Which verison of paraview are you using? My cmf file is very similar to
yours, I have tried putting the <Time> inside the <Grid .. Uniform> but
it doesn't work either...

Subject: [Paraview] Dynamic libraries on Mac not recognized as plugins
Message-ID: <664157.54263.qm@web59507.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello again,

I'm building my vtkCubeReader files for Paraview as an external shared library using a custom CMake file.  It builds perfectly but otool -D reports that the default path of each directory is the directory it is built in rather than /usr/local/plugins/ which is where the plug-ins go.  Is there something my CMake configuration is missing?  Changing LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH to /usr/local/plugins/ didn't seem to help.

Last time I tried building the libraries with a default path of ./ so that they would not depend on their location but that just placed a plugins directory in the root directory.  Is there something I should know that I'm missing?

I'm running ParaView 3.2.2 on a Macintosh Pro with Dual Quad-core Xeon processors and 4 GiB of RAM.  It is running MacOSX 10.5.2 .

While this may not be the preferred way to do what you want, you  
could try something like the following:

IF (APPLE)
   SET(USE_RPATH ON)
   SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(CubeReader
      PROPERTIES
      INSTALL_NAME_DIR "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/plugins"
      BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH TRUE
   )
ENDIF (APPLE)

I had this problem, but moreso.  I was trying to get a plugin to deploy in
the paraview bundle I built.  The general answer is to make sure you are
referencing the same libraries in the same places as paraview is, and that
the library's internal location (otool -D ) is correct.  I fixed them by
hand using install_name_tool( -change and -id) .

I could try.  BTW, how do clean configuration information for windows?

I was thinking about filling an enhancement request for Paraview to
not store persistent state information, unless asked to do so.

Message-ID: <20a72bf00807141650s13cae7f4g8c6e91bf171aa680@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'd like to use the DICOM-RT dose data of radiotherapy treatment
planning on ParaView, which has the same header information as regular
DICOM image files as well as radiation dose information of each voxel.
 The problem is that these dose are 32-bit data, and I wonder whether
there are any methods to handle such data using ParaView.

I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to handle 32-bit data on ParaView.

Thanks,

--    Hi everyone , I  emailed a question three day ago, but nobody replied.

      These days I was trying to solve it and waiting for the answers in the
maillist.

       It was about the Building Paraview on Windows.  After the so called
successed building, the Paraview's Main Menu had gone,

       both the Release and  Debug version could not see the mainmenu, on
linux system no such things.

       Can anybody gave some solutions ?

       Maybe some options in CMake for Paraview was bad or errorly set ??

       ==============================

       When launch the Paraview, output dialog said:
QFongEngine:GetMetrics() failed.

       ==============================

        Here we are in summer holiday, but I have to work on Paraview for
two months.

        Help.....

        Thanks

All the best !

Gang.

Hi Gang,

I remember I had exactly the same problem on my boxes with Japanese
version of Windows XP, when I compiled ParaView 3.2.1 + Qt 4.2.3 with
VS2005/2008. If I remember correctly the solution I found was to use
VS 2003.net.

But I don't remember if the current CVS + Qt 4.3 also have the same
problem. I'm also interested if anyone else encountered the problem
and if there's a right solution.

Hi everybody,
I want to read in a structured grid file which looks like this:

and everytime I get the error "Generic Warning: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkDataReader.cxx, line 933

I looked up the vtkDataReader and it seems that there is a problem with the function vtkReadBinaryData, that the eof is reached too soon, but does anyone know how to fix this?
any help appreciated,kind regards,Natalie

Message-ID: <b227a7f80807150514te458d42ga015009d541e7e63@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!
I'm trying to display some labels for scalar values over selected cells.
In older versions (e.g. the latest 'Development Snapshot' from paraview.org)
it was possible to display this values/labels by using the 'Selection
Inspector'.

In the current cvs version (QT 4.3, compiled with VS 2008), the
pull-down for the
'Label Mode' contains only the 'Cell Ids', all other other
values-names are missing.

Is this a bug, or did i miss something in the latest paraview development?

Thanks in Advance.

Mirko

Subject: [Paraview] Multi-block distribution in parallel
Message-ID: <487C968A.2060706@cscs.ch>

When loading a multiblock dataset with 38 datasets from a series of xml 
vtu files, paraview splits each dataset among all processors. Since each 
block already represents a 'piece' of the data - is there a way I can 
tell paraview to load one or more blocks per process, rather than 
splitting all of them. The splitting is not such a big problem, but the 
files are huge and the IO overhead of having all blocks read by all 
processes is making the process much too slow to use.

If not, is there an easy way of converting a vtmb file that looks like 
this (below), into a parallel form, where the pieces are the blocks.

Hey John,

Are you getting this with the regular ParaView or with PV Meshless? I  
get these messages when I try to use Python with Meshless, and I've  
used the python debugger to track down which modules are causing  
problems when loading the xml.

The first one for me is SPHProbePointOverTime. If I delete this one  
from CSCS_SPH_Server.xml loading servermanager in python gets through  
the "filters" and gets to the "representations", crapping out with  
"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute  
'GetDocumentation'" when trying to process PointSpriteRepresentation  
(from rendering.xml).

I'm not sure what is wrong with either of the xml files, though, or if  
there is something else that needs to be done for proper wrapping.  
This is as far as I was able to get...

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hmmm. That is weird. Hythloth on the VTK dashboard also uses git Mesa
and that doesn't have any failures. Does the latest Mesa release work?

Hi,

I have downloaded the latest version of paraview from cvs and with great
disappointment I can not compile it anymore. Last week I used to compile
it with qt 4.2.1 and everithing was working fine.
:-(

Is there a specific reason for the needed upgrade?
Also disappointing the fact that Qt 4.4 is also unsupported :-(

Any hints?

Thank you
Simone

Hi Mirko,

This is a bug. It is already captured in our bug tracker. We will fix
it before the 3.4 release.

In the root CMakeLists, comment out the Qt version check, then you can 
use 4.4

#      MESSAGE(SEND_ERROR "Qt ${QTVERSION} not supported.  Please use Qt 
4.3 (you may need to clean your dirtied cache).")

Subject: [Paraview] What could cause a reader's code not to be accessed?
Message-ID: <886287.42241.qm@web59505.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello again,

My practice reader creates a file in its constructor and closes it in its destructor.  There is no file created when I put my "libCubeReaderGUIPlugin.dylib" and "libCubeReaderSMPlugin.dylib" into /usr/local/plugins/ , enter them into the plugin manager requester in the appropriate list gadgets, and try to open a *.cube file that I created.  The attempt at reading the file just produces 2 outputs with the first being a polygonal mesh with one point and no polygons in it, and the second being an unused uniform rectalinear grid.

The *.cube filetype is correctly registered by the client side so I know that the GUI plugin is working.  I'm using vtkPolyDataAlgorithm as my parent class in vtkCubeReader.h and am trying to follow the instructions in the VTK User's Guide and the ParaView Guide for making a reader.  The contents of my vtkCubeReader.cxx file is based on the VTK/Examples/Graphics/vtkCubeSource.cxx source code.  There is nothing proprietary in this reader yet so, if you need me to post code, I can post it to the list.

I'm running Paraview 3.2.2 on a Macintosh Pro with 4 GiB of RAM and 2 quad-core Xeon processors.

Thanks,

--Sam Crow

It should work, although I admit that I have not personally tried that and
it could be that no one else has either.

Is it possible to test connect 64-bit client to 64-bit server (as well as
32-bit client to 32-bit server) to make sure that it really is a pointer
width issue?

I am not able to replicate this problem.  Could you send more details on the
bounds, spacing, and slice of the image data?  It would be even more helpful
if you could send the data or describe how to replicate it with one of
ParaView's sources (like Mandelbrot or Wavelet).

Actually, I can reproduce it. It seems to be a precision issue with
the cut filter. Make sure that the radius of the sphere is small
otherwise you won't notice it. Alternatively, look at the output of
the slice filter. x ends up being 0.261 not 0.2605.

Thank you.

Murron should start producing tests of VTK and ParaView tonight.

Subject: [Paraview] Compilation problem. Lack of chart Qt dir
Message-ID: <487CDB27.9000507@nacad.ufrj.br>


Folks,

I'm trying to compile PV3 CVS's head in Windows and I'm getting the 
following error message:

CMake Error at VTK/GUISupport/Qt/CMakeLists.txt:259 (SUBDIRS):
subdirs Incorrect SUBDIRS command. Directory: Chart does not exists.

At CMakeLists.txt: line 259 we have:

# recurse into Chart directory if we have Qt4
IF(DESIRED_QT_VERSION MATCHES 4)
  SUBDIRS(Chart)
ENDIF(DESIRED_QT_VERSION MATCHES 4)

and my Qt is the GPL'ed version available at Kitware's site (4.3.4). So, 
I don't know what to do about the lack of this "Chart" directory. Should 
it be there on the Qt's distribution?

regards

Renato.

Here goes!

There's a bunch of stuff commented out.  Right now I'm just trying to display a white cube.  The file contents are ignored.

The path you set "~/cubelog.txt" is an incorrect path, since the ~ is a 
terminal shortcut. Use a fully qualified path

Hi Gang,

As far as I can recall I didn't get any errors so have no idea, but
not so sure since I did it about four months ago. Anyone can you give
suggestions?

p.s. please keep discussion on the list so that others can share.

It appears that, at some point, you upgraded your libc6.

 paraview depends on libc6 (>= 2.6-1); however:
  Version of libc6 on system is 2.3.6.ds1-13etch5.

I can only go so far with unDebianizing a system, especially one that's
in production. :-(

Message-ID: <62f123080807152334g31afae51ofb7a1b61c48c47e@mail.gmail.com>

              Hi everyone..

              Days ago, I questioned about the
QFontEngineWin:GetTextMetrics() failed() , I still got no good solutions.

              VS.Net 2008 + Qt4.2.2(the right version paraview specified) +
Paraview3.2.2

              The Qt built "successfully", but the QtDesigner got no
MainMenu like file edit view.......

              The paraview built "successfully", but the Paraview.exe got no
got no MainMenu like file edit view.......

              And the Paraview gave output message
QFontEngineWin:GetTextMetrics() failed()


==================================================================

              The Linux cluster really successed.

              ==================================================================

              Now I want to connect the Linux with XP.

              I tested that, when Paraview launched on XP, the pvserver
launched with MPI on linux cluster, then use the paraview to connect the
cluster pvserver, it worked well.

              But when I tried the command type to launch the pvserver, the
output message said :

              cannot connect to the server, seemed that the passwordless
connection between xp and linux needed.

              both the xp and linux were in the same net ip-area.

              some met such problem?

             Help....

All the best !

Gang.

If you still could not reproduce that behavior here is how I got:

Open 'test.vti'
Create sphere from source with Radius=0.001, Origin=0.2605 0.3300 -0.3801
Create slice (X-normal) of 'test.vti' with above coordinates as origin

I also noticed that in fact sphere with such small size can be zoomed in or
out only if we already have a screen size relatively in that range. I will
separately post that behaviour in detail.

Many thanks,
Hom Nath

Message-ID: <b0a936c00807160110h3dd858ma6aa39c68cd8065a@mail.gmail.com>

Reproducing behavior:
Create sphere from source with Radius: 0.001, Center: 0.1 0 0
In Display change Scale to 2.0 2.0 2.0, sphere position changes

But for Center: 0 0 0 or large radius, seems to be working fine, sometime
even I cannot zoom in or out but unfortunately such behavior I cannot always
reproduce.

Am I doing/understanding something wrong or is it an issue similar to
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6233, which seems to have been
resolved.

Paraview: Latest CVS QT: 4.4

No, the latest Mesa release does not work. It produces the exact same types of 
bad images. 

Just as a check I turned off the use of off screen rendering for screenshots 
in ParaView built against mesa from the git repository and it made no 
difference.

Hi everybody,
recently I tried to install paraview on linux, I untared and unzipped the file an then changed to the bin-directory and tried to run paraview:
First everything seemed ok, the window saying "Paraview Kitware.. blabla" turned up and then the GUI of Paraview, but a few seconds later it vanishes and in my terminal I get error messages:

ERROR: In /home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 370
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x861e2e0): Could not find a decent visual

Aborting.

and that's it. What's the problem?
Thx in advance,

You may want to try turning "Use Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots" off.
You should also check if you have the OSMesa library installed.

I don't think so... there's GL2PS in VTK but it I don't think it's an option 
in paraview.  Most journals I'v seen (not that many) accept at least one 
raster format.

As you can see, we use openmpi in Debian sid. We compile paraview with -O2.

Generally, if you could help us get the standard package in debian to
do what you want, so that people don't have to compile their own
package, it'd be awesome. For example, here is one bug that is not
working:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=488671

You can look at the official debian package in unstable and look into
debian/rules and debian/patches to see how to make it compile and work
in sid.

Are you using Debian sid? If so, you can use the paraview package in Debian.

We'd appreciate any help with it. I.e. if it's not doing what you
want, please report a bug and then try to fix it.

Our goal is that anyone can just do

apt-get install paraview

and it does the right thing and works. It does for me in Debian sid,
except the help, but that's minor:

Hi,

Yes I tried VS2008 Pro, VS2005 Express in turn but had the same
problem (compiled just fine but appeared with the unreadable small
menu bar, showing "QFontEngineWin: GetTextMetrics failed"). In my case
the only version that worked was 2003.net. But your mileage may vary.

p.s. Let's keep the discussion on the list, whether we get an
immediate response or not.

Yes, you may tell pvbatch to reload a state file, and to produce a jpg. 
You can then loop over all your files in your python script.

all answers to your questions can be found in the document:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf

I don't think version 3.2.1 does this very reliably though. I woud 
recommend the cvs version where the pvbatch support is much more reliable.

Hello Natalie,

GLX is a reference to OpenGL.  On Linux you need the Mesa libraries installed to implement them.  If you don't have a hardware-accelerated graphics driver then that might cause problems also.

My journal experience is similar (both in observation and lack of scope) as
Kevin's.  Generally, I have found that journals accept raster images, but
only at fairly high dots per inch (dpi).  Fortunately, ParaView lets you
create images of any size, even those larger than the available display.
Also, I highly recommend saving in png format.  The jpeg format that most
people go for tends to create artifacts in the types of images ParaView
generates.

If you require the image to be converted to EPS format, for example to
include in a LaTeX document, there are tools freely available for that.  I
use the convert program from ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org).  Admittedly,
this creates large eps files, which leads to large ps and pdf documents.  I
often get around this by leaving the images in png format and then using
pdflatex, which will read in the png files directly and maintain the
compression.

Hmmm ... I don't agree.

First, Mesa is not needed for GLX. Most distributions of OpenGL, from graphics card vendors like Nvidia, include GLX.

Second, the error message doesn't say that GLX is missing. Instead it says that a suitable visual cannot be found. That sounds like the X window system is not configured property. Look at the output from "xdpyinfo". The list of extensions should include one or two with "GLX" in the name. The list of visuals should include at least one with a depth of 24 planes and a class of TrueColor or DirectColor.

Subject: [Paraview] Success on Building Paraview3.2.2 on Windows
Message-ID: <200807162349045002107@gmail.com>



           Hi,everyone, after trying times of using series of .Net platforms VS.Net2003, 2005, 2008.

           
           Now, I would like to share my experiences.

           Firstly, down the Paraview3.2.2 source code from the Paraview offical site.

           Importantly, the along with Qt4.2.3 should be down from the Wiki page like paraview-qt-win-opensource-src-4.2.3.zip 

           unzip the Paraview source code and the Qt source code. like c:\Paraview3.2.2 and c:\Qt

           Edit the system PATH value, add the c:\Qt ;

           Launch VS.net 2005 (the only right version for it as to me). add the lib,include,bin directory from the Tools-->Options.

 
          Luanch the VS.net2005 command line interface, echo &PATH to check the Qt settings

          In the Qt directory , the installpatch42.bat ,firtstly run it.

          then qconfigue.bat msvc2005 (or just type in qconfigure,see the tips)

          then next just input y , and the latter, nmake it.

          ==================================================


          after that, in the c:\Qt\bin, the designer.exe could be launched, (should contain the MainMenu like file,edit,view);

         ==================================================


         CMake2.6 to generate the .sln files for VS.Net2005

          Make directory for the building Paraview ,like c:\ParaviewBuild

          Set the soure code directory and building directory. ---Configure it 

         If Need, the Shared library,USE_MPI should set ON

         sometimes you have to mannual add %MPI%/lib/mpi.lib %MPI%/include to the MPI options.

         Take care, there was some error for developers, so do not care about the output messages.

         Genereated it.

         =================================================

         Using VS.Net2005 to open the Paraview.sln , F7, wait for it.....
   
         After finished it ,in the c:\ParaviewBuild\bin\debug 

         click the paraview.exe.  Best wishes, you would see the right one.

 
        =================================================

        As to me, VS.net 2008 could successed, but the MainMenu of the designer for Qt and the paraview gone... 

        VS.Net 2003 even could not build at all.

       ================================================

      Best wishes.

Hmmm. I wonder if Mesa is doing something different on your machine
than Hythloth. Is it possible that it is going through some hardware
accelerated path instead of full software? I know very little about
Mesa but I know that it can utilize certain graphics hardware for
accelerated rendering.

I think the vtm format does what you want. It worked well with 4,096 vti files.

Is there a description of the vtm format anywhere?  I am relying on
one generated by paraview as my template.  It would be really, really,
nice to know what the fields mean.

It's possible. The nvidia driver is loaded and used by X.  

The various builds find their correct libraries:

$ for all in /home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3_*Build/bin/paraview ; do  echo $all ; ldd $all | grep libGL.so ;done
/home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3_Build/bin/paraview
	libGL.so.1 => /home/kevin/mesa/lib64/libGL.so.1 (0x00007f7d69cd0000)
/home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3_mesa_7.0.3_Build/bin/paraview
	libGL.so.1 => /home/kevin/Mesa-7.0.3/lib64/libGL.so.1 (0x00007f1a39c59000)
/home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3_nvidia_Build/bin/paraview
	libGL.so.1 => /usr/lib64/nvidia/libGL.so.1 (0x0000003d2b800000)

Mesa was not built with DRI. I thought that DRI was the 
only way to get _any_ sort of acceleration with mesa.

Acording to lspci the graphics hardware is a :
nVidia Corporation Quadro NVS 290 (rev a1)

I'm using gcc (GCC) 4.3.0 20080428 (Red Hat 4.3.0-8) which Hythloth is not.
I suppose I could try a different compiler just for yucks.

It's looking for it in the ffmpeg directory as opposed to libavformat
(which is where yours is). You either have to change vtkFFMPEGWriter
to include it from the right place or install your own ffmpeg version.

I am using vtm files referencing vtu files, but it does not work (split 
well) with vtu. I'm not keen on delving into the xml reader internals to 
find how the block splitting is done, but maybe the vti are handled 
better as they are structured. It shouldn't work with vti either since 
at the block/dataset level the partitioning is the same. perhaps you did 
this before a lot of recent collection/xml reader changes went in...I'm 
still looking for a solution.

mpi.h is not part of ParaView.  It is found by installing some version of mpi (mpich or openMPI, for instance), and then pointing ParaView to it.

The path to mpi includes is set as follows using cmake:
  MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/yourPathToTheBaseOfYourMPIHere/include

You probably want to set the MPI library also, as follows (example for mpich):
  DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/yourPathToTheBaseOfYourMPIHere/lib/libmpich.a

you are seeing interference between your own Reader and a reader already 
supported by ParaView for the Gaussian Cube file format. The Gaussian 
Cube file takes precedence, and creates the two outputs you describe. 
Your own reader is not being executed.

here is a short excerpt from Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml

   <SourceProxy name="gaussiancubereader" class="vtkGaussianCubeReader"
                label="Gaussian Cube reader">
     <Documentation

       long_help="Produce polygonal data by reading a Gaussian Cube file.">
       The Gaussian Cube reader produces polygonal data by reading data 
files produced by the Gaussian software package. The expected file 
extension is .cube.

Subject: [Paraview] GUI custumized Object Panel with filter
Message-ID: <487F31DE.2040801@cam.ac.uk>

Hello all,

_*Description*_
I am wrote a customized object panel for my Free-Form Deformation (FFD) 
filter plugin. This panel object is deriving from 
pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel. However the panel does not show up when I 
select the FFD filter in Paraview  3.3.0...


_*More details*_
I wrote a Free-Form Deformation filter:
name of the class : vtkFFDTransformFilter
sources : vtkFFDTransformFilter.cxx and vtkFFDTransformFilter.h
proxy name : vtkFFDTransformFilter.xml

I wrote the corresponding customized object panel deriving from 
pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel (example p281 in the PV book)
name of class: pqFFDTransformPanel
source : pqFFDTransformPanel.h

And I modified the CMakeList.txt (see attached)
_*
Result:*_
- Everything compile properly
- Both plugin (panel+filter) are initially loaded in PV
/*- But, when I run the FFD filter, the GUI panel does not show up... ????*/
- I  wrote a printf in the panel object constructor, but it seems that 
the constructor is not called...
There is a post which looks like that ([Paraview] Custom Filter Panel 
Not loading in PV3 CVS), but in his case, the constructor seem to been 
called. So it is not exactly the same problem.

Anyone can help please? (See attached CMakeList.txt, 
vtkFFDTransformFilter.xml and pqFFDTransformPanel.h)

Regards
Boris Clemencon

VTK recently has a POV exporter class, thanks to Li-Ta Lo and Jim
Ahrens at LANL. It has not yet been integrated into ParaView. You
might want to contact Ollie or Jim directly about it.

It sounds like the data file is corrupt, specifically paraview is
expecting there to be more point centered data values that it can read
from the file. Are there 41525 floating point values in the file after
the word "default"?

But we need more information to help.
*Which version of paraview are you using?
*What OS, and what machine type 32 or 64 bit?
*How was the file generated?
*Can you post the data file to the list?
*Can a simple vtk app read the data file?

We're using paraview cvs version of today. Loading data with time-aware 
readers.
Saving state, reloading state, playing with the time buttons works fine, 
unless AnnotateTime is included.

With Annotate Time, we get consistent crashes reloading states with 
paraview and pvbatch.

Are others using it with sucess? we are on Linux boxes (gcc 3.4.6)

I just tried a compile from scratch, and it worked for me...

Maybe try building from scratch?

What I tried to communicate with the final sentence is that FindMPI *is* working.  -I/usr/include/openmpi/1.2.4-gcc/ is being added to many targets, just not *this* one.

Subject: [Paraview] only one window on tiled display
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0807171407490.14390@rilke.csail.mit.edu>

Hi all,

I am trying to run paraview on a tiled flatpanel display under Rocks 4.3.
With paraview 3.2.1 and 3.3.0 I did not get anything to show on the tile 
displays (see below), with paraview 2.6.1 I got one of the tiles to show 
its part of the render window.  Can anybody help?  I tried everything I 
could find on the mailing list -- with limited success.
Here is what I tried:

ParaView-2.6.1-x86-linux.tar.gz:

I have 1 head node (headnode) and 2 tile nodes (tile-0-0 and tile-1-0).
The tile nodes have open X servers on display :0.0.  On the head node, I do

$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
$ mpirun -np 2 -x DISPLAY -machinefile machines `pwd`/pvserver -tdx=2 -tdy=1 `pwd`/nodes.pvx
$ ./pvclient -tdx=2 -tdy=1 -sh=tile-0-0 `pwd`/nodes.pvx

$ cat machines
tile-0-0
tile-1-0

$ cat nodes.pvx
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
   <Process Type="client" />
   <Process Type="server">
   <Machine Name="tile-0-0" />
   <Machine Name="tile-1-0" />
   </Process>
</pvx>

This will bring up a client window on the head node and a tile window on 
tile-0-0, nothing on tile-1-0.  pvserver produces the following output:
-----
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Client connected.
ERROR: In 
/home/amy/ParaViewReleaseRoot/ParaView-2.6.1/Servers/Filters/vtkTiledDisplaySchedule.cxx, line 143
vtkTiledDisplaySchedule (0x8183db0): Bad process id.

ERROR: In 
/home/amy/ParaViewReleaseRoot/ParaView-2.6.1/Servers/Filters/vtkTiledDisplaySchedule.cxx, line 143
vtkTiledDisplaySchedule (0x8183db0): Bad process id.
-----
and more of the same error if I interact with the client.  After closing 
the client, pvserver-real on tile-1-0 keeps running.


I also tried reverse connection:

$ ./pvclient -tdx=2 -tdy=1 -rc `pwd`/nodes.pvx
$ mpirun -np 2 -x DISPLAY -machinefile machines `pwd`/pvserver -tdx=2 -tdy=1 -rc --client-host=headnode

This will create a client window and a tile window on one of the tiles 
(randomly).  The client waits and then connects.  The output from pvserver is
-----
Connected to client
ERROR: In 
/home/amy/ParaViewReleaseRoot/ParaView-2.6.1/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx, line 671
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x8109ee8): Handshake failed.

ERROR: In 
/home/amy/ParaViewReleaseRoot/ParaView-2.6.1/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 646
vtkProcessModule (0x805f118): Server Error: Could not connect to client.
-----
This time, both server exit when the client exits.


paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86.tar.gz:

This time I ran
$ mpirun -np 2 -x DISPLAY -machinefile machines `pwd`/pvserver -tdx=2 -tdy=1
$ ./paraview -s=tile-0-0

Only the client window appears, nothing on the tiles.
The server acknowledges the connection from the client.  The client 
produces the following (irrelevant?) error:

/home/jahn/src/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview-real:
/usr/lib/libpng12.so.0: no version information available
(required by /home/jahn/src/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/libQtGui.so.4)

I also tried connecting using the clients GUI, and also giving the pvx 
file as a command-line argument.  No difference.
The same happens with paraview-3.3.0.

Any ideas?

The problem is due to me running Etch and, since it's a production box,
it needs to remain that way.  Etch has older libraries which forced me
to download and install newer ones to compile ParaView.  I'd love to be
able to apt-get it.  Throw one in backports and I will. :-)

Hi all,

 

I'm quite a new user to Paraview. Last time I've tried EnSight to do my
post-processing. I just wonder whether Paraview has the same Stereo
function as found in EnSight EnLiten. This will create a stereoscopic
imaging and LCD shutter glasses is used to view the 3D object. 

Thank you.

 

Best Regards.

Ah I see. I am too busy now, but if you compile the package on etch, I
can ask some Debian Developer to upload it to backports.

That is weird. That target is exactly the same as others. Actually, it
does not need the mpi header. What happens if you remove the include?

Subject: [Paraview] Reading 8GB Volume
Message-ID: <4880AC93.6030802@psc.edu>

It seems that the most efficient way to store and read a 2048^3 volume of unsigned bytes is as a single 8GB array. After using D3 to spread the array over a parallel 64-bit system volume rendering should also be optimum.

However, it seems the good old VTK XML formats using appended raw data are, well, "old" in that they require a 32-bit byte count which is of course inadequate for 8GB.

Is there a way around this or do I need to abandon the VTK XML format for this case? Are there other file formats that someone could suggest? Can ParaView's raw data reader handle this array?

TIA!

I'm always building from scratch.  Updated cvs but still no go.

Let's compare Utilities/IceT/CMakeLists.txt:

FIND_PACKAGE(MPI)
MARK_AS_ADVANCED(CLEAR MPI_INCLUDE_PATH)
MARK_AS_ADVANCED(CLEAR MPI_LIBRARY)
MARK_AS_ADVANCED(CLEAR MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY)
IF (MPI_INCLUDE_PATH)
   INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${MPI_INCLUDE_PATH})
ELSE (MPI_INCLUDE_PATH)
   MESSAGE(SEND_ERROR "Could not find MPI includes, which is required to 
compile ICE-T.")
ENDIF (MPI_INCLUDE_PATH)
IF (MPI_LIBRARY)
   LINK_LIBRARIES(${MPI_LIBRARY})
ELSE (MPI_LIBRARY)
   MESSAGE(SEND_ERROR "Could not find MPI library, which is required to 
compile ICE-T.")
ENDIF (MPI_LIBRARY)
IF (MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY)
   LINK_LIBRARIES(${MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY})
ENDIF (MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY)

note how it adds MPI_INCLUDE_PATH.

Now ./VTK/Parallel/CMakeLists.txt:

IF (VTK_USE_MPI)
   INCLUDE (FindMPI)
   SET ( Kit_SRCS
     ${Kit_SRCS}
     vtkMPICommunicator.cxx
     vtkMPIController.cxx
     )
   # Needed for mpich 2
   ADD_DEFINITIONS("-DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK")
ENDIF (VTK_USE_MPI)

....

IF (VTK_USE_MPI)
   IF (MPI_LIBRARIES)
     SET(KIT_LIBS ${KIT_LIBS} "${MPI_LIBRARIES}")
   ELSE (MPI_LIBRARIES)
     IF (MPI_LIBRARY)
       SET(KIT_LIBS ${KIT_LIBS} "${MPI_LIBRARY}")
     ELSE (MPI_LIBRARY)
       MESSAGE("Could not find the required MPI libraries")
     ENDIF (MPI_LIBRARY)
     IF (MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY)
       SET(KIT_LIBS ${KIT_LIBS} "${MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY}")
     ENDIF (MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY)
   ENDIF (MPI_LIBRARIES)
ENDIF (VTK_USE_MPI)


no mention of MPI_INCLUDE_PATH.


Now what I don't understand is why my Fedora 9 ParaView 3.2.2 build is 
working but this build isn't.

Aha! It works if there is an mpi.h in the default include path. This
is indeed a bug. I'll commit a fix.

Oops. I was wrong. MPI_INCLUDE_PATH is indeed included in the top
CMakeLists.txt file. VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS_SYSTEM include MPI_INCLUDE_PATH.
What happens if you run cmake a second time before compiling? Maybe it
is an order thing...

Ah, that's the difference between my builds.  I was running cmake twice 
before, so that should fix it, but I suppose there is a proper fix that 
could be made.

This is very annoying (by the way), because if you change the path of 
mpi.h to use a different implementation, the whole of paraview gets 
rebuilt. I've done it about 4 times today, and I'm fed up with it :(

I have also abandoned the VTK XML formats because of the 32 bit byte
count; For plain, monolithic, large storage, HDF5 works very well for
me; It is of course trivial to write an Xdmf wrapper, but I have found
the performance not good at all for large parallel reads, I write my own
reader with raw HDF5 commands and I reach about 1.2 GB per sec reads; I
am happy with that; I do not use D3;
?
A further advantage is that if you write python scripts, and if you need
only hyperslabs, the pipeline is smart enough to only ask the reader to
get only the subset needed (at the difference of paraview, which always
reads the whole volume, before you have? a chance to create an Extract
Subset)
?

Hi,

I have problems when compiling own vtk classes as Paraview Plugins if
they use stl containers e.g. vector in the header file.

The compilation fails during

Generating vtkMyClassClientServer.cxx

returning syntax error
------------------------

*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file vtkMyClass.h before
line xx

Is it possible to resolve this without changing the class design?

Thank you,
Enkelejda

Try excluding the offending declaration as follows:

//BTX
   void OffendingMethod();
//ETX

};

Hi,

 

When I use the threshold filter I get the following error:

 

"QFormBuilder was unable to create a widget of the class
'pqDoubleRangeWidget'." 

"QFormBuilder was unable to create a widget of the class
'pqDoubleRangeWidget'." 

QObject::connect: Cannot connect (null)::valueEdited(double) to
pqThresholdPanel::lowerChanged(double)

QObject::connect: Cannot connect (null)::valueEdited(double) to
pqThresholdPanel::upperChanged(double)

 

This is using a CVS version which is about 2 weeks old.

Paul

Hello,

Are there plans to fix Bug 7323? (http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=7323)

It is fairly serious for us at Mirarco as it is holding back development of
new filters that use the cell property of an input.

Is this a build with static or shared libraries?  What version of CMake?
Does it change anything if you rebuild the pqWidgets project?

Subject: [Paraview] Removing Include Directories from Custom Plugin Build
Message-ID: <803D1FED-6346-448C-AAE1-276EA61D14C8@imts.us>

I have a custom plugin that I am building against the latest CVS  
paraview and I have run across a situation that I am not if there is  
a bug or feature or oversight?

With my plugin cmake code I add a few Include directories from my  
plugin's source directory.


INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}"
                         "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}"
                         "${PVRoboMet_SOURCE_DIR}"
                         "${PVRoboMet_SOURCE_DIR}/../"
                         "${PVRoboMet_SOURCE_DIR}/src/"
                         "${PVRoboMet_SOURCE_DIR}/src/Readers"
)

I am using the "ParaView_Extra_External_Modules" to directly include  
my sources into the ParaView build. The problem I am running into is  
that if I _disable_ the building of my plugin then those extra  
include directories are _still_ sent to gcc. Is there a way to remove  
those extra include directories if the plugin is NOT being built?

I am getting some conflicting header files from another plugin that I  
am trying to build. Yes, it was a _bad_ idea to have some headers  
names EXACTLY the same. Of course I could take the really easy way  
out and change the name of the conflicting headers. But lets pretend  
there are some other reasons why I wouldn't want to do that.

Hi there,

 

I'm a newbie and investigation the feasibility of using paraview in the
office. One of our current tasks is to show streamlines origination from
domain inlets and I was wondering whether there's an easy way of doing
so? Creating a line or a point is a bit tedious.

Hi all,

filter to transform the data set. I works fine with the point coordinates.
But the vectors in point data do not transform at all. I am wondering if
this filter uses

Hi,

Problem solved by following suggestion given in openfoam message board
http://openfoam.cfd-online.com/forum/messages/1/4438.html

This link was given in the post -- "Save screenshot and Intel graphics: a workaround"? in paraview mailing? list

I followed the procedure given in the post :- 
?to add the following line in? /etc/X11/xorg.conf? file in ServerLayout section

Section "ServerLayout" 
        Option         "AIGLX" "false" 
EndSection

It worked.

I have tried this in paraview 3.3 in Intel as well as AMD onboard grahics,
using ubuntu 8.04 and ubuntu 7.10. I think this is a problem with software? and not hardware specific.

Thanks very much for help

Regards,
Sundeep

Subject: [Paraview] Selection of points
Message-ID: <48859050.4080507@cscs.ch>

I have a dataset which consists of animating particles. I can select a 
region of space and get the Id's of certain particles. I now wish to 
pass this list back into my Pathline filter so that only the particles 
selected are drawn with pathlines. However, when I hit the back button 
for the animation to return to time zero, the selected particles now 
change. I can change the selection type to Id - which is great because I 
can use this information directly in the pathline filter to pick out the 
lines, but again - when I change time step, the particles are re-ordered 
and my information is lost.

I'd like to copy the active selection - and then fix it - so it is now 
disconnected from the pipeline and becomes a static piece of data which 
does noit change with time.  If I save the selction to disk, I can load 
it and use it as I'd like to. Is there a way of copying the active 
selection - and disconnecting it from the pipeline so that I can skip 
the disk save/load stage and pass the selection directly to my pathline 
filter?

thanks

JB

The transform filter will only transform the "active" normals and "active" vectors. The active normals are still used by ParaView and they appear to be transformed correctly. (To verify, create a sphere source, apply a rotate and/or asymmetric scale, and then add glyphs on the normals to see that they still point perpendicular to the surface.) The concept of active vectors is largely abandoned by ParaView. Instead, filters are expected to accept the names of variables to process.

Automatically transforming every field variable that happens to be a 3-tuple as a vector is a bad idea. There is no guarantee that each such variable is in fact a vector with meaning in the same space as the point coordinates. Thus, to properly implement this request, the transform filter should accept zero or more field variables to transform instead of just grabbing the active vectors.

As a workaround, one could use the calculator filter to apply the transform. Translates and scales are quite simple to implement, and rotations that are a factor of 90 degrees around any axis are pretty easy, too.

The underlying stream tracer has the ability to take a second data set to use as the initial seed points for the tracing of the stream lines.  I think it is possible (and perhaps one of the Kitware gurus can back me up on this) that it should be straightforward to create some XML filter specification that you can plug in to expose the stream tracer as a two-input filter.

This, of course, is all assuming that you can specify your domain inlets as its own data set.  However, I can think of no easier way to specify them.

I have not used the ParaView_Extra_External_Modules feature in years, so I don't have a direct answer to your question.  However, you could work around your problem by building your plugin against ParaView instead of the other way around.  Instead of using ParaView_Extra_External_Modules to have ParaView find your plugin, add a FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView) command to your plugin to make it link against an existing ParaView build.  I do that frequently and it greatly simplifies building plugins.

There is already a stream tracer that takes an arbitrary input. I  
can't remember the name. Look in the filters menu.

Hi Ken,

   Thanks a lot for your explanation. The workaround works well for me.

Here is a link to the wiki :

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

What operating system are you using?

Paraview is built and tested every night on 64 bit machines. I build and test 
it on the 64 bit machines gargon and murron running Fedora 8 and 9.

You may find the options listed for the machines on the dashboard usefull :

Please keep the discussion on the list. That is, at least include a CC to the 
list.

Please re-read this section of the wiki :

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Configure_ParaView_With_CMake

Paraview must be "built out of source." That is you should untar the source, 
make a build directory, enter the build directory, then run cmake (or better 
yet ccmake)  with the path of the source directory.

One more brief note on that: If you have already run cmake (or ccmake) from the source directory, make sure you delete the CMakeCache.txt from the source directory before attempting to run cmake or ccmake from the binary directory.  CMake has a funny habit of refusing to let you do an out-of-source build once you have created an in-source-build.  If you have trouble, just delete everything and untar the source again to start fresh.

Any reasons why Qt4.4.0 is not supported ?

I suppose it is possible, but I recommend using a different product specifically designed video production such as EnVe (http://www.ensight.com/enve.html), which is free.  It will be a lot easier than doing it with a ParaView script.

How about using ffmpeg or mencoder directly ?

Use the glyph filter to add arrows or cones pointing in the direction of the normals.

Subject: [Paraview] Immediate mode rendering problem
Message-ID: <17823991-4990-41C1-80A7-C61A40B142BE@videotron.ca>

Hi,

After I downloaded and compiled a fresh version of ParaView3 today, it  
seems that the
"Immediate mode rendering" option does not work properly. Even if  
disabled in the preferences,
paraview continues to render using this option.

Anybody else had this problem today ?

Best regards,

Pierre-Olivier

VTK's FFMPEG adapter is not compatible with recent FFMPEG versions
because parts of FFMPEG's API have changed.

There is an existing bug (http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=4719) on
the VTK bugtracker to update VTK to be compatible with recent FFMPEG,
but we have not gotten to it yet.

In the meantime, you can either svn back date to 2006-01-30, or
download the FFMPEG source code from that date via
http://www.vtk.org/get-software.php#addons.

Hello,

Today I had built ParaView 3.2.3 on an AMD64 linux machine. Whenever we
click on any menu, the screen
become white and the object disappears, but after
clicking the mouse in the window, the background color and the objects come
back to the original state.
This  behaviour is painful when we have to interact
very often with parameters.

Can someone give suggestions ?

Subject: [Paraview] "had to make up a value for selection": what am I doing
	wrong?
Message-ID: <20080725.134828.112545990.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

My reader for the latest CVS head has a selection list within its UI
panel associated with its corresponding vtkDataArraySelection object,
as shown below in its XML representation. The selection list is
initialized when RequestInformation() is called for the first time,
and works perfectly as long as the contents of the list remain
unchanged.

However if the reader try to add items to the selection list later
within RequestData(), the newly added items always appear unchecked in
the UI panel regardless of the status in its corresponding
vtkDataArraySelection, and messages saying "had to make up a value for
selection" are shown in the output window a number of times equal to
the number of items added.

If I remember correctly this piece of code worked fine until rather
recent CVS (within a month or so, but not so sure).

What am I doing wrong?

        <StringVectorProperty 
            name="CellArrayInfo"
            information_only="1">
            <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="Cell"/>

Hello,

Does ParaView now have the "animating live data" features discussed at

Also, is there an existing reader for scalar point data (Point3D), as

or something similar?

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Reader for data file containing multiple kinds of data?
Message-ID: <4889E3A4.9090703@txcorp.com>

I have just ordered the ParaView Guide, and the VTK
Textbook and User's Guide, so answering by reference to
those will be most welcome.

My data files are hdf5 with a schema described by data
attributes, so that I can pick out groups in the file
and classify them as meshes (rectilinear, structured,
unstructured, ...) or data, with the latter knowing what
mesh they live on.  So the reader cannot derive from,
e.g., vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm (like the example at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend), as the
data is not all on an unstructured grid.

Furthermore, in the end, I suppose once I get this into
ParaView, the result of opening a file will be the presence
of several sources in the pipeline browser of ParaView.

While I am waiting for the arrival of the above noted
books, can someone point me to any starting point, such
as class that does something similar to this?

Thanks.....John Cary

PS - we currently parse these files with pytables
and then make 2D plots with matplotlib.

You probably want to produce a multiblock data set
(http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkMultiBlockDataSet.html).
That is a data object which contains other data sets.

To get started, take a look at the vtkDataObjectGenerator as an
example of how to produce composite data sets.

Then take a look at the XDMF reader which produces multiblock data
sets by reading hdf files, using an xml layer to interpret the hdf
files' contents.

There are a few readers in VTK/IO that are derived from a
vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm that might be useful for reference:

  vtkFLUENTReader.h
  vtkGenericEnSightReader.h
  vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader.h
  vtkOpenFOAMReader.h

The multi-block-dataset can hold various data types.

If you wish to have multiple output ports (say a different port for each
data type), the only example I saw in VTK/IO is this one: 
  vtkGaussianCubeReader


I unfortunately don't know how multi-port output gets connected with the
rest of the pipeline.

No, as far as I know. The new support for transient data would be a good foundation for this feature.

ParaView can read the VTK file formats and some of those support point data.

I can get some example code of a reader we are finishing up. We also  
store our data in HDF5 files. Some of the data is in a custom format,  
some is in a "vtkPolyData" ready state, and other is "2D Plot" type  
data.

Our Reader is a based on the vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm BUT we have  
5 output ports.
   Ports 0 and 1 are vtkUnstructuredGrid
   Port 2 is a vtkMultiBlockDataSet
   Ports 3,4,5 are vtkRectilinearGrid

We then created a new reader class for each of the types of data that  
is stored in the HDF5 files. In the top level reader, sub pipelines  
are setup to read each of the other types of data. At the end of all  
the reading the data is shallow copied back into the output objects  
for each port.

In ParaView, what we end up getting is a 3D plot of the  
UnstructuredGrids and 3 x 2D Plots of all the other data. It actually  
worked out pretty good.

Good Luck.

Thanks to both Kent and Berk for your replies.  I'll look into the
transient data support, although the code is probably a bit beyond my
understanding at this point.  Is it in a particular directory/function
sub-tree?

The primary use for me now is high-frequency "monitoring" of
"generalized sensors," e.g., processing and visualizing live data
streaming from experiments, network connections, and perhaps financial
markets.  I think a general description is multiple scalar data defined
on a dynamic 3D mesh.  In the simplest case, a fixed 2D sub-grid is
known in advance, and only "z" values of individual points get updated
(i.e., no dis/appearing acts).  Other scenarios may entail less
structure: connecting certain "dots" on the fly, moving surfaces, or
just scattering points.  I'm not sure that vector, tensor, or volume
plots will be relevant for me, although I imagine the latter will be
especially so for forthcoming applications of real-time medical imaging(?).

Since the information usually arrives from disparate sources at
irregular intervals over an indefinite period, the time steps are
neither well-defined nor countable in advance.  If necessary, I can
multiplex the signals into mesh-wide updates delivered periodically to
the visualization application, but low latency is important.  That is,
frame dropping is OK for the sake of soft real-time-ness.  I'm just
getting started with VTK, so I'm not sure about how it (and its
descendants) handles direct partial updates to a data set.  Although the
overall data rate in my case is not very high, it might rise
significantly in the future.

At this stage, I'm not sure about a proper format for visualizing
multi-dimensional time series with ParaView, VisIt, Mayavi, a custom VTK
wrapper, 3D graphics engine such as OGRE, etc.  I'm hoping to "serve"
the aggregated signal to the visualization pipeline either via a network
connection or from a single growing file.  Is HDF5 a possible way to go?
 Of course, I can start with a simple "streamable" human-readable or VTK
format.

By the way, is there an option in ParaView to automatically "Apply" all
changes to the pipeline?

Also, having found Octaviz (http://octaviz.sourceforge.net/), I'm
curious about the possibility of integrating popular scientific,
numerical, and statistical computing suites (e.g., Octave, R, SciPy,
NumPy) and high-level visualization environments (e.g., ParaView,
VisIT).  (Or at least greatly facilitating it, if licensing issues
arise.)  As I understand it, one issue is two-way communication of data
between the computing (in the sense of SciPy, etc.) and visualization
engines.  Perhaps the existing parallelization of the latter can even
help to parallelize the former.  Of course, another issue is writing
simple commands like plot3(), but already, Octaviz appears to go quite
far.  How about making the Python shell dockable, perhaps as a view?  If
this is old hat, I apologize.

One more: Is grid-enabled visualization on the horizon?

Thanks again.

Message-ID: <F3FA59D7-FC50-4286-9753-DD23431B118E@elemtech.com>

I have several hundred polydata files (currently in .vtp format).  I  
am primarily interested in seeing how the grid structure changes over  
time in each of the files.  The  files are named with a sequential  
number.    How would I go about reading the files and animating this  
kind of morphing grid in Paraview?   I opened the filename..vtp and it  
displays the first file and the Pipeline Browser shows the object as  
filename* but I don't know how to get to the next file in this  
structure.

  I am currently writing the files using a vtkXMLPolyDataWriter so if  
there is an easier way to write the files for animation, I can change  
that also.

   Thanks,
         Karl

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf data order?
Message-ID: <488B7D6F.1010707@txcorp.com>

I have spent the day playing with the xdmf data
reader in both VisIT and ParaView.  I asked this
question of the visit list, but seeing more xdmf answers on
the paraview list, I thought I would look here.
My apologies to those on both lists who get this
question twice.


I have been looking at the xdmf reader as another way
of getting at our data.  For the life of me, I cannot
figure out how to get our 2D data read in so that ParaView
knows that the first dimension should be x and the second
y.  I attach both the xmf and h5 files.

When this is opened, the contour plot looks right
(with the blue square visible),
except that x and y are interchanged.  The format
appears a bit strange, as the order in Topology->Dimensions

  <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions="1 25 20"/>

has to be different from that in the Origin and DxDyDz data
items.  It is not in KJI ordering, but rather in KIJ ordering.
If I swap the last two items, the strides are wrong and I get
garbage.  I can also get a correct picture (up to axis labeling)
by using

  <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions="25 20 1"/>

but now x is plotted as z (and I have to reorder Origin and
DxDyDz).

(The order of the DataItem->Dimensions variable seems to have no effect.)

ParaView and VisIt show the same behavior.  I see similar
behavior in 3D.  I can have either the data strides correct
or the axis labeling correct, but not both.

It seems that the plugin was written for Fortran ordered
data, as if the data is written not using the _f methods
of HDF5, yet in fortran?  In any case,
I need to tell the plugin that my data is in C order, not
Fortran order.  Is there a way to do this?

You should be able to use the VCR toolbar to step forward / behind in the
animation, or just play it all. There is a a good tutorial on animation at

Hi,

I am trying to build paraview 3.2.3 on IRIX 6.5.22m with mipspro 7.4.4 and the build enters into a continuous loop trying to build vtkCharArray.o.

When I whck the vtkCharArray.o file is created but the build just loops again until it eventually crashes

Anyone else have problems here

The feature of reading .vtp files directly as a time series is a feature
that should be implemented for ParaView 3.4 (which will be released RSN).
In the mean time, you can get around the problem by creating a .pvd file
that points to all of the .vtp files you have as separate time steps.  The
following link shows an email in the archive demonstrating this:

What does the output look like when you compile with
make VERBOSE=1

Is it the compiler that enters the loop or make? If it is the
compiler, I would guess it is some sort of template instantiation bug
in the compiler...

Message-ID: <d0767b160807281448i7f731926v6cb244a26b8d80fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there.
I know how to build a server and connect to it. But I need multiple clients
to connect to the same server and display different views of the same data.
I can't find any information about multiple clients of Paraview from
internet.
Is it possible to have multiple clients connect to one server? How can I do
it?
Any help and suggestions are highly appreciated!

Subject: [Paraview] paraview cannot read xdmf file
Message-ID: <BAY122-W12B680CB91807B9361E9DCBC820@phx.gbl>


Hi everybody,
I have written an Xdmf-File to be read by Paraview, but Paraview doesn?t, does not even recognise the file type as it asks me which reader it should use. 

This is my .xmf-file: 

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" [
<!ENTITY HeavyData1 "c2d-coordinates.h5">
<!ENTITY HeavyData2 "c2d-dg-values.h5">
]>



<Xdmf >
  <Domain Name="c2d">
    <Grid Name="Curvilinear" GridType="Uniform">
    <Topology Type="3DSMesh" Dimensions="275 151 1">
    </Topology>
    <Geometry Type="XYZ">
        <DataStructure DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="41525 3" Format="HDF">
        c2d-coordinates.h5:/Curvilinear/XYZ  
        </DataStructure>
    </Geometry>
    <Attribute Name="Density" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Node">
        <DataStructure DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="275 151 1"  Format="HDF">
         c2d-dg-values.h5:/Curvilinear/Density
        </DataStructure>
    </Attribute>
    </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

and I just don?t undestand, what?s the problem with it? the .h5 files are located in the same directory as the .xmf -file. 

Paraview says: ERROR: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\Utilities\Xdmf2\vtk\vtkXdmfReader.cxx, line 2978
vtkXdmfReader (05B2A1F8): Cannot find any domain...

Hi,

for some time noe I have been trying to build paraview on irix using irix 6.5.22m and a mips compiler 7.4.4.

Does anyone have a last working copy of paraview. It seems that current compiles are almost irredeemably prone to errors.

any help would be appreciated before I just give up

Cheers

ParaView does not support connecting multiple clients to the same 
server. You can however run two pvserver processes on the same server 
machine and connect a client to each of them.

Subject: [Paraview] "had to make up a value for selection": what am I

Hi ParaView developers,

As I got no answer so far from the list, I did some digging with a
debugger. As a result it's looking more like a bug in ParaView, but
I'm not confident yet. So far what I found are threefold:

1. If I revert the following modification to
pqSignalAdaptorSelectionTreeWidget.cxx on 2008-07-02

Index: pqSignalAdaptorSelectionTreeWidget.cxx
===================================================================
RCS file: /cvsroot/ParaView3/ParaView3/Qt/Components/pqSignalAdaptorSelectionTreeWidget.cxx,v
retrieving revision 1.6
retrieving revision 1.7
diff -r1.6 -r1.7
187,188c187,190
<   
<   this->Internal->Property->ResetToDefault();
---
>  
>   // Domain changes should not change the property values. This is overriding
>   // the value loaded from state files etc.
>   // this->Internal->Property->ResetToDefault();

, the "had to make up a value" message disappeared and reader worked
as expected. This coincides with my thought that the problem started
at around a month ago.

2. After doing AddArray() to the selection object in the reader,
ParaView does seem to recognize the newly added item, since in

void vtkSMArraySelectionInformationHelper::UpdateProperty(
  vtkIdType connectionId,  int serverIds, vtkClientServerID objectId, 
  vtkSMProperty* prop)

numArrays turned out to have the expected number of arrays, and the
results of GetArgument() were precisely expected values. I could
confirm the new item is added to prop (the last argument in the
function prototype above) through SetElement(). The address prop
pointed to was 0x078c5b38 in the tracked case.

3. However, when

void pqSignalAdaptorSelectionTreeWidget::domainChanged()

was executed later, the address this->Internal->Property pointed to
was 0x078cd688, which was different from what prop pointed
to. Naturally, the object this->Internal->Property pointed to did not
contain the new item. Thus the missing item triggered the "had to make up
a value" message in

QList<QVariant> pqSMAdaptor::getSelectionProperty(vtkSMProperty*
  Property, unsigned int Index).

So my question after all is, where and why has prop (the object at
0x078c5b38) gone?  Even with a debugger, tracking what had been going
on behind 100+ call tree stack was simply out of my skill range. Can
you comment if this behavior is expected, or a bug?

Thanks,
Takuya

Natalie,

I'm guessing that the fist line of your .xmf file
is a blank line and the <?xml ....
line is the second. The <?xml .... has to be the
first line in the file of the XML parser won't accept it.

I copied your xml into "try.xmf" and the reader was able to parse
it.

Also a few minor things :
  - since you are specifically listing the .h5 files, using the
	HeavyData1 and HeavyData2 entities is unnecessary, just
	remove them.
  - <DataStructure .. should be <DataItem ...
  - <Topology Type=... should be <Topology TopologyType= ...
  - <Geometry Type=... should be <Geometry GeometryType=...

the new reader is backwards compatible to a point but that may change
at some point.

Can you post the vtkToolkits.h file found in your build directory?
It seems like some build options got set to exclude parts of VTK that 
are needed by the GUI.

Dear Mike,

Sorry for warming up the old meal but it is only now that I could fully 
appreciate your solution. After long weeks of frustration with my hdf5 
reader derived from vtkDataReader - and subsequent segfaults reported 
before - I tried your way of deriving from UnstructuredGridAlgorithm : 
and my problem is magically gone, with no other changes than that. I 
have not yet tried time series, so it is not unlikely I will have some 
questions later. For the moment, thanks a lot.

Subject: [Paraview] Timestep mixups with custom reader. [CVS Head]
Message-ID: <4CFECB63-8BEE-4FC4-B114-7508643A383C@imts.us>

I have run into an issue with my custom reader with timestep support.  
Somehow the pipeline is not retrieving the proper value from the  
pipeline and my reader is erroring out.

Here is the relevent code sections:

vtkH5VizFileReader::RequestInformation(...)
{
   numTimesteps = 1; // This was read from a file
   this->TimeStepRange[0] = 0;
   this->TimeStepRange[1] = numTimesteps -1;
   outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),  
&TimeStepValues.front(), (vtkTypeUInt32)numTimesteps);

   double timeRange[2];
   timeRange[0] = this->TimeStepValues.front();
   timeRange[1] = this->TimeStepValues.back();
// timeRange = {1000, 1000} at this point
   outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(),  
timeRange, 2);
}


int vtkH5VizFileReader::RequestData(...)
{
   // Check if a particular time was requested.
   if (outInfo0->Has 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS()))
   {
     // Get the requested time step. We only supprt requests of a  
single time
     // step in this reader right now
     double *requestedTimeSteps =
       outInfo0->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS());
     this->TimeValue = requestedTimeSteps[0];
     // At this point, 'this->TimeValue = 100' NOT 1000 like I would  
have thought.
   }

  // Later on there is a check to make sure the pipeline is asking  
for a time value
// within our range:

   if (this->TimeValue >= this->TimeStepValues.front()
         && this->TimeValue <= this->TimeStepValues.back() )
   {
   }
   else
   {
	return 0;
   }

return 1;
}

Stepping through with a debugger for another file with lots of  
timesteps works just fine. The proper time values are sent by the  
pipeline.
I am not sure if setting the this->TimeStepRange in the  
requestInformation is messing things up by having a range of 0 to 0?

Anybody have any thoughts?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] TimeStep Value remains between file open [CVS]
Message-ID: <065DB3E0-9D4E-4FF9-95CC-EED5BF15F436@imts.us>

I think part of the problem in my last post is that it seems ParaView  
(or my own code) is somehow caching the last timestep used in a  
previous file. So, for example.

If I have a file with 2 timesteps, say 53 and and 106 and I open that  
file just fine. I then "delete" the file from the pipeline and open  
another file with a few other timesteps, say 1000 and 2000. During  
the requestData method the pipeline is requesting timestep 53 instead  
of the first timestep from the new file.

Is there a way to initialize the timestep support on each new file?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Contribution : Silhouette edges filter
Message-ID: <5D20F4AE6EF4C44B8932FE91E08AF0E9BAD1B8@U-SANTORIN.dif.dam.intra.cea.fr>

Dear colleagues,

 

Here attached is a vtk filter that extracts silhouette edges from a poly data.

Silhouette of a surface is made of lines lying on the surface where the surface normal is orthogonal to a direction.

 

Such edges are useful to produce CAD or sketch like drawings. It can be combined with a constant colored surface rendering to hide non-visible edges.

 

Attached example images are made from an iso-surface, but much nicer results are achieved when working with lagrangian numerical simulations.

 

 

Usage:

 

Pipeline: vtkPolyData --> vtkPolyDataSilhouette --> vtkPolyDataMapper --> vtkActor

 

Parameters: SpecifiedVector and CameraVector modes use a uniform direction (resp. explicit or from a camera), while SpecifiedOrigin and CameraOrigin modes use the origin-to-center-of-the-edge direction. CameraOrigin mode is the one to use to produce sketch like drawings.

 

tips: try to combine black silhouettes edges (with line width between 1 and 3) with different kinds of surface base renderings (with or without lighting, constant colored or one color per material). It emphasizes very well the shape of some phenomena, especially for numerical simulations.

 

Note: Silhouette edges can also serve to generate shadow volumes, but this would need an additional contribution.

Thanks veryy much for this information. I spent a bit of time on it last 
week, desperately trying to find out why the point sprite representation 
causes this dodgyness. I failed. I ended up by having a single 2 line 
xml entry with nothing in it at all, and this caused the error. I tried 
cloning other ones and everything - but it seems like as soon as I add a 
new anything to the representations this error comes back.

Can anyone tell me what the error really means?

I tried adding methods for GetDocumentation, tried adding xml entries 
for doc, removing them, everything, but since I don't really know what 
the rror message is trying to tell me, I am clueless - what is the 
NoneType object referred to, and why is the doc not found?

Hi

I am trying to use vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridWriter but I cannot find any
documentation on how ghost levels are used. I've already asked on the
VTK mailing list but I've not had any response - I'm guessing because
not many people use parallel.

scalar array called "vtkGhostLevels" to indicate which elements/nodes (I
think I need both might be needed depending on the algorithm) are owned
and which are halo/ghost. But all this guessing has so far got me either
double counting elements on the halo or a gap.

Can someone please shed some light on this?

Hi,

You don't need to initialize the prop, just the camera. I use it in my own VTK application so I'm not so familiar with Paraview architecture. Basically you have to initialize the camera with the one that is used by you're rendering window's renderer.
Here is a c++ pseudo-code :
	renderer = renderWindow->GetRenderers()->GetFirstRenderer(); // correct if you have only one render

	mySilhouetteFilter = vtkPolyDataSilhouette::New();
	mySilhouetteFilter->SetInput( somePolyData );
	mySilhouetteFilter->SetCamera( renderer->GetActiveCamera() );
	mySilhouetteFilter->SetDirectionToCameraOrigin(); // this is the 	default

The filter looks good.  I've tried to create an XML file to use in
ParaView.  I've attached my attempt although I don't know how to
initialise the camera or prop.  Can anyone help here?

The XML file is the only extra part that is needed in order to create
a plugin for ParaView but I'm still not sure how to go about
initialising the camera.

I've included the CMakeLists.txt required to build the plugin at the
end of the mail.

Paul

 and XDMF)

Oops, my mistake Berk. It's not the first time I mismatch versions... 
(it's easy to get confused when you have 6 different PV versions installed).

Ok, now I can load SOS but it seems that time support is not available 
yet (besides some important parallel filters such as "clean to grid"). 
Is it correct?!

For the XDMF file I've had no success. I've tried to load the following 
file:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">
   <Domain>
      <Grid GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Spatial">
         <xi:include href="cav_4_000.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
         <xi:include href="cav_4_001.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
         <xi:include href="cav_4_002.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
         <xi:include href="cav_4_003.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
      </Grid>
   </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Started PV client and launched PV server with the command (mpiexec -n 4 
pvserver -rc -ch=localhost) and got the following error:

I also tried substituting the "xi:include..." statements by the 
corresponding XML extended portions. The model was not loaded, but the 
error message disappeared ;o)

Renato,

I think I've seen this before. The XML parser is trying to validate
the XML.

As a test, try removing "<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>" from the
xml file or creating an empty Xdmf.dtd (I'll dig up the actual DTD).

Jerry

Ok, I commented all <!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []> clauses and now 
PV does not complain about DTD anymore but nothing is loaded :o(

Am I doing something wrong? I can load the domain pieces individually 
which make me believe that the XDMF files are correct.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with structured grid source plugin
Message-ID: <c9adba420807300721t13788d8yff75fd2d7c962760@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to create a structured grid with a plugin.  The number of
points is correct at the end of request data but nothing appears in
ParaView.  Can anyone see what I am doing wrong?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

We have been meaning to add a parallel section to the VTK book for a
while. I hope that this will happen in the near future. The ParaView
book talks about parallelism and ghost levels. Also, there are a few
documents here and there that talk about ghost levels. A good one is
the handouts from the Supercomputing '07 tutorial found here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/SC07_ParaView_Tutorial

There are going to be ParaView tutorials at both SC '08 and IEEE
Visualization conferences this year. I would recommend attending these
to those that can. Also, we cover parallelism in VTK in the courses we
offer. I recommend those as well.

The basic idea is the following:

- Algorithms that need it request ghost levels from upstream. These
are unstructured or general purpose (i.e. work on vtkDataSet or
vtkPointSet) algorithms that need extra cells to produce piece
independent results. Ghost level request accumulate. If there are
three algorithms that each request 1 ghost level, the reader will
receive a request for 3 ghost levels.
- The reader satisfied this request as best as it can. It marks ghost
cells as such by populating a vtkGhostLevel array (cell-centered).
This array contains an integer that corresponds to the ghost level of
that cell. 0 for internal cells, 1 and higher for ghost cells.
- The filter that asked for ghost levels is responsible of stripping
away the level it request from its output.
- In ParaView, the geometry filter strips away all ghost levels
because they are no supposed to be rendered.

Note that algorithms that only work with structured data (i.e.
vtkImageData, vtkStructuredGrid or vtkRectilinearGrid) do not work
with pieces/ghost levels. Instead, they work with structured extents
that are index based.

I hope this helps.

Can't comment about the underlying problem, but "None" is the Python
equivalent of a NULL pointer - the "None" object is an instance of
"NoneType".  The error is telling you that you're trying to call
GetDocumentation() on "None" - you'll want to check your preceding code to
see why you aren't getting the object that you expect.

Oh ... I totally misread your first e-mail ... I thought it worked now.

This should be working. Let me create a small example.

Renato,

I think it is a bug .... If the Collection Grid does not have
a "Name" nothing is read. Just give your Collection Grid a Name
and it should work.

Here's an example that works :

Spatial.xmf :::
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">
     <Domain>
     <Grid Name="MyCollection" GridType="Collection" 
CollectionType="Spatial" >
         <xi:include href="cube1.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
         <xi:include href="cube2.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
     </Grid>
     </Domain>
</Xdmf>
---------------------------------------------------
cube1.xmf :::
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<Xdmf>
    <Domain>
       <Grid Name="one">
          <Topology  Type="3DCORECTMESH" Dimensions="2 2 2"/>
          <Geometry Type="ORIGIN_DXDYDZ">
             <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">
                0.0 0.0 0.0
             </DataItem>
             <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">
                1.0 1.0 1.0
             </DataItem>
          </Geometry>
       </Grid>
    </Domain>
</Xdmf>
--------------------------------------------------------
cube2.xmf :::
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<Xdmf>
    <Domain>
       <Grid Name="two">
          <Topology  Type="3DCORECTMESH" Dimensions="2 2 2"/>
          <Geometry Type="ORIGIN_DXDYDZ">
             <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">
                5.0 0.0 0.0
             </DataItem>
             <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">
                1.0 1.0 1.0
             </DataItem>
          </Geometry>
       </Grid>
    </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Subject: [Paraview] newbie help
Message-ID: <C9C5F90AF4778B449CF1FC5A9BD9148905EED0@sbsserver.DigitalFlowSolutions.local>

Hi,

  I'm new to developing in a linux environment. I am using Paraview CVS
version with a Kdevelop project I generated using ccmake -GKDevelop3
command. This is fine although the debugger doesn't seem to work.

My question is this: what is the easiest way to add new source files
(and directories) to the project?

KDevelop won't recognise new files even if they are added to the
project. 

Should I edit the cmake lists?

 

Any help appreciated.

Thanks,

That's really helpful - yhanks for your reply Berk. Can I just confirm
one thing with you that's not explicitly stated - is vtkGhostLevels a
cell vtkUnsignedCharArray of name "vtkGhostLevels"? I'm asking this for
the purpose of writing parallel vtk files. I'm trying to debug why I'm
seeing internal faces in my parallel files.

Cheers
Gerard

Some progress here...

Ok, I named all grids with different names and tested with and without 
the XInclude clause.

*Without XInclude* I've got a catastrophic error and PV closed MPI 
connection. The output message was:
ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\Servers\Common\vtkServerConnection.cxx, 
line 67

vtkServerConnection (07981BF0): Server Connection Closed!

ERROR: In 
..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\Servers\ServerManager\vtkSMArraySelectionInformationHelper.cxx, 
line 79

vtkSMArraySelectionInformationHelper (07804578): Error getting array 
settings from server.

ERROR: In 
..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\Servers\ServerManager\vtkSMXDMFInformationHelper.cxx, 
line 135

vtkSMXDMFInformationHelper (07C7BBD8): Error getting domains from server.

(and much more...)


*Using XInclude* I've got:
XDMF Error in 
..\..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\Utilities\Xdmf2\vtk\vtkXdmfReader.cxx line 
2129 (Unknown Topology Type = 0)
XDMF Error in 
..\..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\Utilities\Xdmf2\vtk\vtkXdmfReader.cxx line 
2129 (Unknown Topology Type = 0)
XDMF Error in 
..\..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\Utilities\Xdmf2\vtk\vtkXdmfReader.cxx line 
2129 (Unknown Topology Type = 0)
XDMF Error in 
..\..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\Utilities\Xdmf2\vtk\vtkXdmfReader.cxx line 
2129 (Unknown Topology Type = 0)

Easy to understand if we look the source code. vtkXdmfReader.cxx was 
expecting XDMF_TET and my file had Tetrahedron. Quite weird since it 
works fine when running in serial mode, or loading the model pieces one 
by one. In fact, it seems like a bug. Nevertheless, I've made the 
substitutions I tried again. Now, I have the same error message that 
I've got in the first case (without the XInclude).

Jerry, I've made my files available in 
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/transfer/xdfm-test.zip (13.4 MB). Just 
to make the debug process easier. It seems that the Xdmf support in 
ParaView is still a bit fragile.

Renato.

p.s.: I wildcard would help us a lot when writing transient files ;o)

Yes the best way of doing this is to edit the cmake files. I recommend
taking a look at cmake.org for more info on how to use cmake.

Hi

I use Kdev with paraview as well. I use it as an editor mainly and I 
don't build or debug PV via kdev. As far as I know Kdev uses automake 
under the covers to build stuff, and that is inconsistent with PV so I 
don't bother with those features. You can add files to the project by 
file->new. But, you also have to add them to CMakeLists.txt file in the 
appropriate directory by hand. (You may be able to skip file->new if you 
are willing to run cmake to regenerate your project files).

Subject: [Paraview] Converting (2-D) scalar field data to height
Message-ID: <57336.132.236.6.70.1217439789.squirrel@webmail.cornell.edu>

Hello,

I have been analyzing a set of volume data where I have taken a thin slice
through the center. This volume data contains a scalar field. Now, since I
only have a plane through this volume, I have a scalar field simply on a
2-D plane.

My question is whether or not there is a preexisting filter (or any way
what so ever) that converts this scalar data into in a height that
corresponds to the axis which is perpendicular to both the other two axes
that define the plane where the scalar data is contained.

Thanks,

Patrick

Warp scalar. You may have to convert the data to polydata (using
Extract Surface) or unstructured grid (clean to grid) first though.
Warp filters do not work on image data since its points cannot be
individually modified.

Renato,

OK, first mystery is solved. cav_4_full.xmf had wrong dimensions in 
grids cav_00[1,2,3]. I copied the first grid from each individual file
and it worked. Also XDMF_TET should have been "Tetrahedron" like it was 
in the individual files.

Now on to the XInclude file .....

Here is new car_4_full.xmf that works in Paraview 3.3

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with structured grid source plugin
In-Reply-To: <c9adba420807300721t13788d8yff75fd2d7c962760@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C4B5EA82.4B98%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The problem is that vtkStructuredGridGenerator needs to declare the whole
extents in RequestInformation.  ParaView will first take the whole extents
reported in RequestInformation to determine the size of the data that is
going to be created, and then pass an update extent during the RequestData
phase to tell your generator what part of the data to actually load.

Attached is a modified version of vtkStructuredGridGenerator.cxx that adds a
RequestInformation method that reports the WHOLE_EXTENT.  I also modified
the RequestData to query the UPDATE_EXTENT to create a structured grid that
is the subregion ParaView requests.  I also took the liberty to fix a bug in
the order of the for loops that create the point data.  I've tried this in
ParaView in serial and it works fine.  I have not tried it in parallel, but
these changes should make it work in parallel too.

Renato,

I have a temporary work around while I'm investigating.
It seems that "spatial" collection of "temporal" grids is
problematic. But a "temporal" collection of "spatial" grids
works fine. I re-wrote your collection file with a little more
xpointer magic and this will animate correctly in paraview.

I left your individual files intact but I had to move the
time element into the spatial collection grid for paraview
to read it correctly.

Here's the xml (xpointer indexes are 1 based)
-----------------------
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">
    <Domain>
       <Grid Name="cav_000_collection" GridType="Collection" 
CollectionType="Temporal">
       <Grid Name="cav1" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Spatial">
         <Time Type="Single" Value="     0.0"/>
          <xi:include href="cav_4_000.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[1])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_001.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[1])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_002.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[1])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_003.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[1])" />
       </Grid>
       <Grid Name="cav2" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Spatial">
         <Time Type="Single" Value="     0.1"/>
          <xi:include href="cav_4_000.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[2])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_001.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[2])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_002.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[2])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_003.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[2])" />
       </Grid>
       <Grid Name="cav3" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Spatial">
         <Time Type="Single" Value="     1.1"/>
          <xi:include href="cav_4_000.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[3])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_001.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[3])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_002.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[3])" />
          <xi:include href="cav_4_003.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid/Grid[3])" />
       </Grid>
       </Grid>
    </Domain>
</Xdmf>

I'm still investigating what's going wrong with "spatial" collections of
"temporal" grids.

*It seems that "spatial" collection of "temporal" grids is problematic*

It's really a very important note at this stage of Xdmf implementation 
in ParaView. I naively found that both options would be equivalent (and 
should be as you pointed out) and had bad luck in choosing the wrong one 
(Murphy's law, probably).

Now, I'm afraid that without using the XInclude clauses and without 
wildcards the master Xdmf file will be really huge. 1000 timesteps 
running on 1000 CPU's will give rise to a XML file with at least 1E6 
lines. Parse 1E6 ASCII lines does not seem to be a good choice.

Thanks so much for your help Jerry.

Renato.

Well, luckily we know the authors ;)

"spatial" collections of "temporal" grids should not be a
problem. It's just that we've only used "temporal" collections
of "spatial" grids to date; so the vtkXdmfReader might be making
some erroneous assumptions.

Even doing it as "temporal" collections of "spatial" grids you can still 
use xinclude, it's just that the xml files that are pointed to by the
master file define spatial instead of temporal collections. Is the
reason you don't want to do this because the XML is being produced
by each node ?


Now that I see your XML I understand what you're trying to do and why.
This is a good example case to add some parallel improvements.
You're correct in that parsing a 1E6 XML file might be a bit
"performance challenged". I think the master file should have
one xinclude clause per timestep.

Before we implement some type of wildcard scheme, let me look
at the Xinclude a bit closer to see if it already supports what
we need to do. I'm no xinclude expert.

I'm not going to assume that the number of tets on each node
stays constant thru the entire simulation (eventhough in your
case it might.)

Hi again,

Unfortunately, this was a pure coincidence and the problem is somewhere
else (at the end, a segfault occured as well). I am still very grateful 
for suggesting this path (deriving from Algorithm and not Reader) as I 
would not discover the problem without it. I still believe the problem 
is not on my side. Will eventually report my findings in a new thread.

bye
Dominik

Hi,
I re-configured pv3 only to use system hdf5 library and see the whole 
project rebuilding from scratch. I had thought cmake would do smarter 
than that (it normally does for my own small projects). Did I miss anything?

Can you run ParaView in a debugger or attach to a running instance of  
paraview with a debugger, then trigger the bug? Most debuggers will  
break on a segfault and then you can track down the issue from there.

Attached below. The line in my code (HDF5Reader.cxx:493) is:

status = H5Dread(dataset, H5T_NATIVE_INT, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, 
(int*)data);

I am able to reproduce that this happens if and only if the underlying 
hdf5 dataset is chunked.

YES if I recompile PV3 with system hdf5 (1.6.7) the problem does not 
occur anymore. It is compatible with my much former notion of the 
problem NOT happening outside the PV plugin framework, because my own 
code used 1.6.7. So the problem is the outdated hdf5 version used by PV 
(1.6.5) and/or its conflict with PV.

If I am able to maintain this conclusion for a few days I will file a 
bug report.

Thanks Mike,
Dominik

The build log you sent me is full of these lines:

--- C++ prelinker: CMakeFiles/vtkCommon.dir/vtkCharArray.o ---

This is *not* the make tool or the compilation of vtkCharArray.  The
whole block appears during the invocation of the link command.  This is
the SGI prelinker.  It's choosing vtkCharArray.o as a place to add some
template instantiations of vtkVariant::ToNumeric.

Adding a pragma into any one file will not help in general.  It's just
chance that the prelinker choosese vtkCharArray and not another object file.

In the current development version of ParaView/VTK we have explicit
instantiations for the vtkVariant::ToNumeric method template.  Can you
try checking out from cvs?

Hi, glad I could help. Kdev is really a good tool and it would be great 
to see more support for kitware apps natively. I suspect we will see 
this sometime in the (near?) future as KDE is now using cmake. I suppose 
it's up to us to make it happen though. ;) As far as debugging PV it 
depends on if you are running client server or just the client. If you 
are running just the client, from the top  of your build directory

gdb bin/paraview

If you want to debug the servers you can attach to their running 
processes. Here is a bash script that I have used:

# start of script
# attach gdb to paraview servers
PIDS=`pidof pvserver`

for PID in $PIDS
do
#   CMD="ddd --pid=$PID"
  CMD="xterm -geometry 200x40 -bg black -fg white -T $PID -e gdb --pid=$PID"
  $CMD &
  echo "$CMD attched to $PID"
done;
#end of script

Also if you use mpich2 there is a debugging interface that pipes what 
you type into the debugger to all processes. In my experience this has 
not worked as well as it could.
Of course you should use your favorite debugger/interface. Emacs seems 
to be very popular, and looks really nice, but I haven't mustered the 
motivation to tackle yet another set of strange key bindings.

Message-ID: <21f0b0400807311303w2d64641ew53a71578d8f65cf8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have installed ParaView 3.2.3 on Intel AMD64 with Ubuntu 64 bit.
Currently I am dependent on Intel
motherboard graphics card only and the glxinfo | grep render program reports
that direct rendering
is absent on my machine.


Can someone inform me how to enable Direct Rendering on Linux machine ? With
indirect rendering,
I cann't hope to get interact with big dataset.

Thanks.

The thing to really ask is if you have a file giving a position in the data=
 volume (XYZ) and one or more scalar values at the given position=2C in an =
ascii file (e.g. CSV) is there a simple way of getting the data into Paravi=

Hello Dominik<BR>
&nbsp=3B<BR>
Thanks for the suggestion. I have seen various variants on the netCDF impor=
ter but all require the paraview source code to be compiled=2C not somethin=
g I do personally. The problem with netCDF is that you end up dealing with =
two variants=2C one which only accepts a single variable like XYZ where z w=
ould be say elevation=2C and in effect you have a 2D layer. The other varia=
nt is based on the COARDS convention and allows multiple layers and variabl=
es to be built in to netCDF - this is not so easy to construct.<BR>
&nbsp=3B<BR>
It does seem that Paraview is great if you can get your data into a suitabl=
e format=2C otherwise it seems to be a lot of effort. In that respect=2C I =
do feel that having more generic import options=2C and a built in netCDF op=
tion=2C would be a big benefit to users=2C particularly working in geophysi=
cs.<BR>
