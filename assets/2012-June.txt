Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Streamtracer
Message-ID: <000f01cd3fba$ff5b8fb0$fe12af10$@tu-cottbus.de>

Leo,

As I mentioned in my initial post of this thread: I used the up-to-date
master branch of ParaView. Which means I have already used your
implementation.

I can imagine, to parallelize this algorithm can be very tough. And I can
see that distribute the calculation over 8 processes does not lead to a nice
scaling.
 
But I don't understand this huge amount of latency when using the
StreamTracer in a Cave-Mode with two view ports and two pvserver processes
on the same machine (extra machine for the client). I guess the tracer
filter is applied for each viewport separately? This would be ok as long as
both filter executions run parallel. And I doubt that this is the case.

Can you help to clarify my problem?

Regards,
Stephan

Hi, Andy and Leo,

thanks for your replies.

Is it possible to get this new implementation? I would to give it a try.

got slower.

? My new implementation is able to let the processes working on different
streamlines simultaneously and should scale much better.

Hi Stephan,

The parallel stream tracer uses the partitioning of the grid to determine
which process does the integration. When the streamline exits the subdomain
of a process there is a search to see if it enters a subdomain assigned to
any other processes before figuring it whether it has left the entire
domain. 

Leo, copied here, has been improving the streamline implementation inside of
VTK so you may want to get his newer version. It is a pretty tough algorithm
to parallelize efficiently without making any assumptions on the flow or
partitioning.

Hello,

I have a question related to the parallelism of the stream tracer: As I
understand the code right, each line integration (trace) is processed in an
own MPI process. Right?

To test the scalability of the Stream tracer I've load a structured
(curvilinear) grid and applied the filter with a Seed resolution of 1500 and
check the timings in a single and multi-thread (Multi Core enabled in PV
GUI) situation.

I was really surprised that multi core slows done the execution time to 4
seconds. The single core takes only 1.2 seconds. Data migration cannot be
the explanation for that behavior (0.5 seconds). What is the problem here?

Please see attached some statistics...

Hi Sebastien,

I did come across another regression which I traced back to the collaboration
merge 14 months ago. Maybe you can assign someone to
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13215, as I can not in Mantis having
merely a reporter status?

Thanks,
Sven

Hi, Stephan,
  I did measure the performance at some point and was able to get fairly
decent speed up with more processors. So I am surprised you are seeing huge
latency.

  Of course, the performance is sensitive to the input.  It is also
sensitive to how readers distribute data. So, one thing you might want to
try is to attach the "D3" filter to the reader.

  If that doesn't help,  I will be happy to get your data and take a look.

Leo

Stefan,

Can you try doing a ldd on the paraview executable. Is in statically
linking OpenGl? I wonder if brings in different implementations if
that happens.

Message-ID: <CAHoiV3a3FrX1qcg99GiR-yQqL6G5jNvR3xbuQL=E3qoSkU0bXA@mail.gmail.com>

I need an application that shows the 3D
input using volume rendering on one side
and the segmented image on the other side.
I got the later part working, given a segmented
image paraview and webgl renders the surface
without a problem. I am having problems with
the first part though, doing the volume rendering
on the input image.

When I try volume rendering on the input image,
I see the orientation axes at the webgl
section. I can rotate the scene but the object
does not appear on the scene. JS and Java on
the other hand does the rendering as expected.
When I changethe representation to surface, webgl
starts working as well without problem.

The following code illustrates the problem.

      var serverUrl =

"<%=request.getScheme()%>://<%=request.getServerName()%>:<%=request.getServerPort()%>/PWService";

      // ---------------- Session 1 -------------------

      // Create a paraview proxy
      var pv = new Paraview(serverUrl);
      pv.createSession("3D Cell Vis", "Colored rendering", "default");
      var view = pv.CreateIfNeededRenderView();


     var reader = pv.OpenDataFile({filename:"data.mhd"});
      var lut  = pv.GetLookupTableForArray({
      arrayname:'MetaImage',
      num_components : 1,
      NanColor:[0.25, 0.0, 0.0],
      RGBPoints:[97.9033203125, 0.23, 0.299, 0.754, 28376.271484375, 0.706,
0.016, 0.15],
      VectorMode:'Magnitude',
      ColorSpace:'Diverging',
      ScalarRangeInitialized:1.0
      });

      var sof = pv.CreatePiecewiseFunction( {Points:[97.9033203125, 0.0,
0.5, 0.0, 28376.271484375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0] });

      pv.Show();
      pv.SetDisplayProperties({proxy:reader,
      view:view,
      EdgeColor : [0.0, 0.0, 0.5],
      SelectionPointFieldDataArrayName:'MetaImage',
      ColorArrayName:'MetaImage',
      ScalarOpacityUnitDistance:0.7,
      LookupTable:lut,
      Representation:'Volume',
      ScaleFactor:10,
      ScalarOpacityFunction:sof});


      var render = pv.Render();
      pv.ResetCamera();
      view.setCenterOfRotation(view.getCameraFocalPoint());

      // Create and bind renderer
      // ---- For Java ----
      var rendererJava = new HttpAppletRenderer("javaRenderer", serverUrl);
      rendererJava.init(pv.sessionId, view.__selfid__);
      rendererJava.setSize('500','500');
      rendererJava.bindToElementId("java-http-container");
      rendererJava.start();

      // ---- For JavaScript ----
      var rendererJs = new JavaScriptRenderer("jsRenderer", serverUrl);
      rendererJs.init(pv.sessionId, view.__selfid__);
      rendererJs.setSize('500','500');
      rendererJs.bindToElementId("javascript-container");
      rendererJs.start();

      // ---- For WebGL ----
      var rendererWebGL = new WebGLRenderer("webglRenderer", serverUrl);
      pv.updateConfiguration(true, "JPEG", "WebGL");
      rendererWebGL.init(pv.sessionId, view.__selfid__);
      rendererWebGL.setSize(500,500);
      rendererWebGL.bindToElementId("webgl-container");
      rendererWebGL.start();

Any ideas what might be going wrong ?

Thank you,

Hi Cagatay,

the webgl renderer of paraview does not support volume rendering. If
you want to do volume rendering, you will have to use any other image
based renderer available in ParaViewWeb. (JavaScript, Java, Flash)

The icon to the right of the Precision entry box limits the
spreadsheet view to only show the selected cells/points.

View->Selection Inspector, scroll down, choose cell Label tab and turn

That would be useful, the Plot Selection Over Time filter follows that
model  for starters. Please submit a feature request on the
bugtracker.

In the meantime, I should point out that since 3.14, you can finally
cut and paste Qt rendered text.

A camera angle of 0 is erroneous. In fact, I'm a bit surprised you can see the geometry at all.

I think what you mean to do is to put on parallel projection. That option is in the view settings.

Subject: [Paraview] Connect GUI to pvserver on Jaguar
Message-ID: <9DC308DB-C8CA-4282-84FF-8102238316E3@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to connect my GUI to a pvserver running on compute nodes on the Cray Jaguar.
I connect to a login node with a remote port forwrding: ssh -R 11111:localhost:11111 jaguarpf-ext3, where jaguarpf-ext3 is the name of a particular login node.
Then, I launch the pvserver with the option -rc --client-host= jaguarpf_ext3 but that does not work:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: In /tmp/proj/ard013/pv_compil/ParaView-icarus-3.14.1/VTK/Common/vtkSocket.cxx, line 430
vtkClientSocket (0xe0aa50): Unknown host: jaguarpf-ext3

ERROR: In /tmp/proj/ard013/pv_compil/ParaView-icarus-3.14.1/VTK/Common/vtkClientSocket.cxx, line 53
vtkClientSocket (0xe0aa50): Failed to connect to server jaguarpf-ext3:11111
---------------------------------------------------------------------


There are two interfaces on jaguarpf-ext3: I identified which is for the outside and I suppose that the other one is for the internal cray network (both ethernet if)
Thus, I changed the options to -rc --client-host=172.30.215.69, but still not work, even if the message is slightly different.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: In /tmp/proj/ard013/pv_compil/ParaView-icarus-3.14.1/VTK/Common/vtkSocket.cxx, line 481
vtkClientSocket (0xe0aa50): Socket error in call to connect. Network is unreachable.

vtkClientSocket (0xe0aa50): Failed to connect to server 172.30.215.69:11111
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried with the other interface. No more success...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: In /tmp/proj/ard013/pv_compil/ParaView-icarus-3.14.1/VTK/Common/vtkSocket.cxx, line 481

vtkClientSocket (0xe0aa50): Failed to connect to server 160.91.205.200:11111
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Does anyone know what kind of port forwarding I must used to go through the login node on Jaguar?
Should I create a "tunnel" between" the two interfaces? How?

Best regards,

Stephane

Thanks Ken. It works now.

" In fact, I'm a bit surprised you can see the geometry at all. "
I think that's because Paraview resets the minimum value back to 1e-8.

Thanks again.

Subject: [Paraview] points. opacity
Message-ID: <CAKVa3HEf+zWCar_+Ug7UhuDN6q=qX87bq5YMVcQXjFM40SQN8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I have a set of unstructured points.
Each point has "mass" field.
I want to render the points using single color,
but map opacity of a point to its "mass" value.

Is there a way to do this in paraview?

Thank you,

Hi everybody,
    I have a problem in opening a .vtp file.
    When I opened from ParaView GUI, I managed to open it by choosing "Legacy VTK Files" (but this file is not marked as "vtkImageData" to be used with my filter)
    But when I used Python Shell and JavaScript Terminal then my .vtp file is marked "File not readable. No reader found for '..../myfile.vtp'.
    I wondered if anybody have any idea what happened?

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Streamtracer
Message-ID: <002f01cd4233$5b520680$11f61380$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello Leo,

ok, I took the "disk_out_ref.ex2" example data set and did some time
measurements. Remember, my machine has 4 Cores + HyperThreading. 

My first observation is that PV seems to have a problem with distributing
the data when the Multi-Core option (GUI) is enabled. When PV is started
with builtin Multi-Core I was not able to apply a stream tracer with more
than 1000 seed points (PV is freezing and never comes back). Otherwise, when
pvserver processes has been started manually I was able to set up to 100.000
seed points. Is it a bug? 

Now let's have a look on the scaling performance. As you suggested, I've
used the D3 filter for distributing the data along the processes. The stream
tracer execution time for 10.000 seed points: 

##   Bulitin: 10.063 seconds
##   1 MPI-Process (no D3): 10.162 seconds
##   4 MPI-Processes: 15.615 seconds
##   8 MPI-Processes: 14.103 seconds

and 100.000 seed points:

##   Bulitin: 100.603 seconds
##   1 MPI-Process (no D3): 100.967 seconds
##   4 MPI-Processes: 168.1 seconds
##   8 MPI-Processes: 171.325 seconds

I cannot see any positive scaling behavior here. Maybe is this example not
appropriate for scaling measurements?

One more thing: I've visualized the vtkProcessId and saw that the whole
vector field is partitioned. I thought, that each streamline is integrated
in its own process. But it seems that this is not the case. This could
explain my scaling issues: In cases of small vector fields the overhead of
synchronization becomes too large and decreases the overall performance.

My suggestion is to have a parallel StreamTracer which is built for a single
machine with several threads. Could be worth to randomly distribute the
seeds over all available (local) processes? Of course, each process have
access on the whole vector field.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hi, Stephan, 
? I did measure the performance at some point and was able to get fairly
decent speed up with more processors. So I am surprised you are seeing huge
latency.

? Of course, the performance is sensitive to the input.? It is also
sensitive to how readers distribute data. So, one thing you might want to
try is to attach the "D3" filter to the reader.

? If that doesn't help,? I will be happy to get your data and take a look.

Leo,

As I mentioned in my initial post of this thread: I used the up-to-date
master branch of ParaView. Which means I have already used your
implementation.

I can imagine, to parallelize this algorithm can be very tough. And I can
see that distribute the calculation over 8 processes does not lead to a nice
scaling.

But I don't understand this huge amount of latency when using the
StreamTracer in a Cave-Mode with two view ports and two pvserver processes
on the same machine (extra machine for the client). I guess the tracer
filter is applied for each viewport separately? This would be ok as long as
both filter executions run parallel. And I doubt that this is the case.

Can you help to clarify my problem?

Stephan

Hi Stephan,

The parallel stream tracer uses the partitioning of the grid to determine
which process does the integration. When the streamline exits the subdomain
of a process there is a search to see if it enters a subdomain assigned to
any other processes before figuring it whether it has left the entire
domain.

Leo, copied here, has been improving the streamline implementation inside of
VTK so you may want to get his newer version. It is a pretty tough algorithm
to parallelize efficiently without making any assumptions on the flow or
partitioning.

Hello,

I have a question related to the parallelism of the stream tracer: As I
understand the code right, each line integration (trace) is processed in an
own MPI process. Right?

To test the scalability of the Stream tracer I've load a structured
(curvilinear) grid and applied the filter with a Seed resolution of 1500 and
check the timings in a single and multi-thread (Multi Core enabled in PV
GUI) situation.

I was really surprised that multi core slows done the execution time to 4
seconds. The single core takes only 1.2 seconds. Data migration cannot be
the explanation for that behavior (0.5 seconds). What is the problem here?

Sounds like the contents of the file are not actually in vtp format (i.e.
written with vtkXMLPolyDataWriter). Maybe you used vtkPolyDataWriter to
write a .vtp instead of .vtk? Or if you are storing vtkImageData, you
should have probably used vtkXMLImageDataWriter to write a .vti.

Maybe this is not the cause, but

Thank you all for your reply.
I don't quite understand where the problem is from. The .vtp file is readable, but I have to choose the vtkReader for it (there is a window of readers' list appears and I chose "Legacy VTK files"), so, for me, this is perhaps the problem of paraView or something like that. Because with .vtp file, it can't find the right reader to use. So why there is that error "No reader found for /home/thtran/myfile.vtp" with python shell and JavaScript Terminal (I'm sorry, I didn't mention that I used the full path to the file)

I believe if the file data does not match the file extension, Paraview
gives you the option to tell it what the file actually contains. Like I
said, if you choose Legacy VTK and it works, then the file should have
actually been named .vtk instead of .vtp.

Message-ID: <4FCCAFBF.8080503@icams.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>

Hey,
I use the .xyz format to have my atoms from Molecular Dynamics plotted. 
The Point Spirit extension works fast and responsive but loading takes 
for ever. Trying different file sizes, I figured out that the loading 
time (i.e. after hitting the "Apply" button until I get a first 
representation) scales beautifully with
t[sec]=37e-9*numAtoms^2 on my CPU for numAtoms=20000..200000.

I wonder, why is there *quadratic* scaling in *loading*? (which really 
is a bummer in MD simulations which typically use more than 1e6. My 
small test run with 2e5 atoms, I had to wait 1/2 hour.)

Thanks a lot for your insight.

P.S. Coincidentally, printing an Excel chart took also 1/2 hour on a 286 
twenty years ago. Perhaps 1/2hour is a global constant for waiting 
duration. ;-)

Yeah, that is exactly what you said. I changed the .vtp into .vtk and that works
Thank you.

I don't quite understand where the problem is from. The .vtp file is readable, but I have to choose the vtkReader for it (there is a window of readers' list appears and I chose "Legacy VTK files"), so, for me, this is perhaps the problem of paraView or something like that. Because with .vtp file, it can't find the right reader to use. So why there is that error "No reader found for /home/thtran/myfile.vtp" with python shell and JavaScript Terminal (I'm sorry, I didn't mention that I used the full path to the file)

I believe if the file data does not match the file extension, Paraview gives you the option to tell it what the file actually contains. Like I said, if you choose Legacy VTK and it works, then the file should have actually been named .vtk instead of .vtp.

Hi all,


I've been trying to solve the problem.
I found an important setting about it.

Our ParaView is running on shared Linux cluster,
so we operate ParaView with VNC Client.
My VNC setting is very simple as below:
> vncviewer -geometry [width]x[height]
But other users' settings are little different:
> vncviewer -geometry [width]x[height] -depth 32

The -depth option is critical.
Maybe this option influences OpenGL setting of VNC,
and ParaView gets into GLX errors.
I suggested removing -depth option and restarting VNC server,
then our ParaView executed perfectly.

Hi all,


I'm trying to save transient sources with Python scripts.
I'd like to save with these formats:

- ASCII-XML Formats
- Save all timesteps

I tried "Trace" tool, but it couldn't catch "Save Data" processes.
How can I save data with Python scripts?

Subject: [Paraview] ProgrammableSource script executed multiple times on

Message-ID: <4FCCDA01.4070908@cs.unc.edu>

Hello,

I have the following macro which creates a ProgrammableSource in 
ParaView.  I'm wondering why the script seems to be called three 
separate times:

	script = """
	import time
	print 'Script was called.',
	print time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')+'.%03d'%(time.time()%1.0*1000)
	self.GetImageDataOutput().SetDimensions(100,100,1)
	# ... do something expensive here ...
	"""
	script_request_information = """
	from paraview import util
	util.SetOutputWholeExtent(self, [0, 100, 0, 100, 0, 0])
	"""
	ps = ProgrammableSource(
		OutputDataSetType='vtkImageData',
		Script=script,
		ScriptRequestInformation=script_request_information)
	GetDisplayProperties(ps).Visibility = 1
	Render()

It prints out once when I turn on visibility and two more times when I 
Render().  How can I keep the script from running more than once?

Thanks!

jaguar's recent configuration added an extra layer of separation
between the login nodes and the compute nodes. So you have to set up
three tunnels to establish the connection. OLCF helpdesk staff tell me
that if you log in to interlagos.ccs.ornl.gov instead of jaguarpf, you
can skip the middle hop as that is just like the old config, but I
haven't tried it myself yet.

ie:
you ->
  jaguarpf=external login node ->
    internal service node ->
      back end nodes aprun gives you

For the first hop, ssh -R works. It doesn't for the next two hops
because ssh tunnels won't accept connections that don't originate from
localhost. So use this:
git://github.com/patmarion/SocketRelay.git
instead.

Once you get that compiled on jaguar, try this:
ssh -R login_node_port:localhost:paraview_port you at jaguarpf
//to login to jaguar AND open up the ssh tunnel

once there run:
uname -a
//to get name of login_node you are sitting on

socket_relay localhost login_node_port svc_node_port &
//to direct all traffic to login_node:svc_node_port into the tunnel

qsub -I -V -q debug -A yourallocation -l size=number_of_nodes -l
walltime=00:20:00 -l gres=widow1%widow2%widow3
//to get an interactive reservation on the service nodes

Once that comes through
/sbin/ifconfig ipogif0
//to get IP address of service_node you are now sitting on

socket_relay login_node svc_node_port compute_node_port
//to direct all traffic to service_node:compute_node_port back to the login_node

aprun -n number_of_nodes /lustre/path/to/pvserver --reverse-connection
--client-host=service_nodeIPaddres --server-port=compute_node_port
//to start pvserver on the compute nodes and tell it to connect
through the tunnel

Finally in the paraview client start establish a manual client/server
reverse_connection on localhost paraview_port through the GUI.

Hi, Stephan,
  I will look into the multi-core issue as well as the performance issue.

  Some quick answers:

  - Yes, the whole vector fields are partitioned and the streamlines are
passed from one process to another. This is why the performance can be
highly sensitive to how data are distributed and how the streamlines travel
between data partitions.

  - Your suggestion makes sense if the data is small enough to be run on a
single machine. This is definitely something we would like to do in the
future. Right now, the implementation is more targeted towards handling
large data that have to be distributed across multiple machines.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug? VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE
Message-ID: <D1CA05BCA2F52A4CB5CACEFAB254CC4F68A3E16A80@EXCH-MBX-C.ulaval.ca>

Hi,

I have an issue with the non-linear cell type VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE.
In an unstructured grid, I made two disjoints VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE with a SCALARS POINT_DATA (scalar field)
of value 1.0 on one and 0.0 on the other.
My problem comes when the two VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE overlay on one vertex. 
In this case, Paraview seems to transform the discountinuous field in a continuous one.

To test this issue, I suggest you run my two little tests below. (In Legacy style)
I'm wondering if this is a Bug or a normal behavior?

REMARK:
This issue doesn't appear with the linear cell type VTK_LINE!


Thank you for your answers.

Hi Magician,

Good catch!
I forgot to suggest another possible fix for your problem - define the 
environment variable in a command line in VNC window from which you 
launch ParaView:

    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=y


Best regards,
Bruno

That's sounds great. I'm looking forward to have a parallel Stream Tracer
for small vector fields.

Hi, Stephan,
? I will look into the multi-core issue as well as the performance issue.
?
? Some quick answers:

? - Yes, the whole vector fields are partitioned and the streamlines are
passed from one process to another. This is why the performance can be
highly sensitive to how data are distributed and how the streamlines travel
between data partitions. 

? - Your suggestion makes sense if the data is small enough to be run on a
single machine. This is definitely something we would like to do in the
future. Right now, the implementation is more targeted towards handling
large data that have to be distributed across multiple machines.??

Hello Leo,

ok, I took the "disk_out_ref.ex2" example data set and did some time
measurements. Remember, my machine has 4 Cores + HyperThreading.

My first observation is that PV seems to have a problem with distributing
the data when the Multi-Core option (GUI) is enabled. When PV is started
with builtin Multi-Core I was not able to apply a stream tracer with more
than 1000 seed points (PV is freezing and never comes back). Otherwise, when
pvserver processes has been started manually I was able to set up to 100.000
seed points. Is it a bug?

Now let's have a look on the scaling performance. As you suggested, I've
used the D3 filter for distributing the data along the processes. The stream
tracer execution time for 10.000 seed points:

## ? Bulitin: 10.063 seconds
## ? 1 MPI-Process (no D3): 10.162 seconds
## ? 4 MPI-Processes: 15.615 seconds
## ? 8 MPI-Processes: 14.103 seconds

and 100.000 seed points:

## ? Bulitin: 100.603 seconds
## ? 1 MPI-Process (no D3): 100.967 seconds
## ? 4 MPI-Processes: 168.1 seconds
## ? 8 MPI-Processes: 171.325 seconds

I cannot see any positive scaling behavior here. Maybe is this example not
appropriate for scaling measurements?

One more thing: I've visualized the vtkProcessId and saw that the whole
vector field is partitioned. I thought, that each streamline is integrated
in its own process. But it seems that this is not the case. This could
explain my scaling issues: In cases of small vector fields the overhead of
synchronization becomes too large and decreases the overall performance.

My suggestion is to have a parallel StreamTracer which is built for a single
machine with several threads. Could be worth to randomly distribute the
seeds over all available (local) processes? Of course, each process have
access on the whole vector field.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hi, Stephan,
? I did measure the performance at some point and was able to get fairly
decent speed up with more processors. So I am surprised you are seeing huge
latency.

? Of course, the performance is sensitive to the input.? It is also
sensitive to how readers distribute data. So, one thing you might want to
try is to attach the "D3" filter to the reader.

? If that doesn't help,? I will be happy to get your data and take a look.

Leo,

As I mentioned in my initial post of this thread: I used the up-to-date
master branch of ParaView. Which means I have already used your
implementation.

I can imagine, to parallelize this algorithm can be very tough. And I can
see that distribute the calculation over 8 processes does not lead to a nice
scaling.

But I don't understand this huge amount of latency when using the
StreamTracer in a Cave-Mode with two view ports and two pvserver processes
on the same machine (extra machine for the client). I guess the tracer
filter is applied for each viewport separately? This would be ok as long as
both filter executions run parallel. And I doubt that this is the case.

Can you help to clarify my problem?

Stephan

Hi Stephan,

The parallel stream tracer uses the partitioning of the grid to determine
which process does the integration. When the streamline exits the subdomain
of a process there is a search to see if it enters a subdomain assigned to
any other processes before figuring it whether it has left the entire
domain.

Leo, copied here, has been improving the streamline implementation inside of
VTK so you may want to get his newer version. It is a pretty tough algorithm
to parallelize efficiently without making any assumptions on the flow or
partitioning.

Hello,

I have a question related to the parallelism of the stream tracer: As I
understand the code right, each line integration (trace) is processed in an
own MPI process. Right?

To test the scalability of the Stream tracer I've load a structured
(curvilinear) grid and applied the filter with a Seed resolution of 1500 and
check the timings in a single and multi-thread (Multi Core enabled in PV
GUI) situation.

I was really surprised that multi core slows done the execution time to 4
seconds. The single core takes only 1.2 seconds. Data migration cannot be
the explanation for that behavior (0.5 seconds). What is the problem here?

Subject: [Paraview] Rename filtered sources with Python

Hi all,


I've been trying to automate ParaView with Python for weeks.
Now I want to rename filter results such as "ExtractBlock1"
to any other names.
I searched documents on the web and properties of ActiveSource
and others, but I couldn't find how to rename them.

I found a tip of renaming Sphere sources, but I couldn't apply it to my cases:

Does anyone have good ideas?

Here are the two way of doing that:

First set the name at the creation by doing that:

> c = Cone(guiName = "MySuperName")

Or renaming it afterward

> RenameSource( proxy = p, newName = "MySuperNewName")

Message-ID: <2146008933.113296.1338918499570.JavaMail.root@mail-01.cse.ucsc.edu>

Hi,

Is there a way to select a single row in the spread sheet view so that one can perform a histogram filter on it? 

Specifically, I have a structured grid. I have multiple data arrays associated with each point in the grid. I want to find the distribution / histogram of a single point in the grid across all data arrays of the same type. Each point is a row of data in the spread sheet view and each column corresponds to each data array.

My filter sequence:

structured 3d grid -> slice -> histogram

Where the desired point is selected in the 3D view from the slice and shown as a highlighted row in the spread sheet view.

However, the histogram that I get in the bar chart view bins all samples from the slice and not just the values from the data arrays associated with the point.

   As input, we can use the xml file to link them, using <IntVectorProperty>, <StringVectorProperty>, etc.
   So, for the outputs, how can we write the xml file?
   For exemple, I have a function with "double" as return value. And I want to show this value in ParaView, as well as extract it in Python Shell and JavaScript Terminal (ParaViewWeb).
   Thank you very much in advance.

Thank you very much for your reply, Seb.
I have been reading lots of exemple in the .xml files before I ask you this question :
For input, we have  command="SetInputArrayToProcess" to know that there is a function (if i'm right) which is linked with the input.
But for the output, there isn't any information like that. So, I wonder if the output as information_only="1" is the return value of an vtkGetMacro?
And if the return value of my function is not an attribute of my class, is there any way to see this return value?

vtkMesh100.vtk). I would like to make a simple animation video to show
the deformation of this model related to the images slices. I wonder if
there is way to automatically do add them as keyframes?  if not, need I
edit all of the 100 files in the animation editor as key frames?  It looks
a little bit boring if doing like this to edit the step or ramp function
for each time slots.
I have seen in some old question, after I load a vtk file series I can play
the vtk file series. However, when I click the play in the VCR menu,
there is no animation, all meshes are just fixed, not moving.  I do not
know if there is something I missed.
Thank you very much.

Alex

Subject: [Paraview] Cmake complaint with git clone of ParaView
Message-ID: <4FCEBC1A.3000807@indiana.edu>

Hello,

Earlier this evening I did a "git clone" copy of ParaView from
git://paraview.org/ParaView.git, and CMake is giving my the
following errors:

                  CMake Error at CMake/VTKModules.cmake:3 (include):
                    include could not find load file:
                      vtkDependentOption
                  Call Stack (most recent call first):
                    CMakeLists.txt:148 (include)


                  CMake Error at CMake/VTKModules.cmake:361 
(VTK_DEPENDENT_OPTION):
                    Unknown CMake command "VTK_DEPENDENT_OPTION".
                  Call Stack (most recent call first):
                    CMakeLists.txt:148 (include)

I did a Google search, but no obvious answer appeared.

Note: I also got this warning:

                 CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:120 (MESSAGE):
                    Warning: You are using Qt 4.7.4.  Officially 
supported version is Qt 4.8

Of course, that was after it complained about a lack of Qt, and
mentioned version 4.7, so I spent an hour compiling Qt version 4.7.4
(if only CMake had told me it wanted an even more recent version!)

	Thanks for the help,
	Bill

So, I tried this and wonder if it is right:

For the return value, I declared an attribute double OpThreshold and the family of Set Get : SetMacro(OpThreshold,double) GetMarco(OpThreshold,double)
then in the function, I used this->OpThreshold = optimalThreshold with optimalThreshold is the value we calculate.

In the .xml file
<DoubleVectorProperty name = "OpThreshold" command="GetOpThreshold" infomation_only = "1">
</DoubleVectorProperty>

I followed the tutorial in the IEEE vis09 conference, in stead of command Set, we have command Get  


	
		
		
	
	<DoubleVectorProperty name="Translate" command="SetTranslate"

	
 number_of_elements="3" default_values="0 0 0"

	
>

So, please tell me if I'm right or wrong, if wrong, then what do I have to change.
Thank you very much.

You just have to use the attribute

information_only="1"

For more details, you can look at the one that are defined inside
ParaView itself in
SRC/ParaViewCode/ServerImplementation/Resources/*.xml

After git clone, you need a 'git submodule update --init', or you can
'git clone --recursive':

Hi Tuan,

an information_only property is used to retrieve value from the object
by calling some Get Macro.
But information property does not behave the same way a regular property does.
In fact, you need to explicitly call on your proxy
UpdatePropertyInformation() in order to update the local values of
those information properties.
In ParaViewWeb, the method UpdatePropertyInformation() is not exposed
therefore, you will need to write a helper plugin in python.

Here is a sample code that illustrate what you want to achieve:

=== file: helper.py ====

def getProperty( proxy, propertyName ):
    proxy.UpdatePropertyInformation()
    return eval("proxy." + propertyName)  ## You might need to fix
that line, but you get the idea...

==== JavaScript part =====

helper = paraview.getPlugin('helper');
var value = helper.getProperty( myProxy, 'NumberOfSomething' );

Thanks David, I'm sure that's the problem.

Unfortunately, my git reports that it doesn't have the "submodule" option.
Which surprises me, since I litterally compiled a brand new version
of git last night:
	% git --version
	git version 1.7.11-rc1

And unfortunately, the "--recursive" option makes use of the "submodule"
option, so it too complains:
	git: 'submodule' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.


I'd guess that I did something wrong in building git, but the build
process was pretty basic.  But I'll go back and see what I did wrong
there (or go to a machine that already has git installed, download
ParaView there, and then copy it back to the machine I want it on -- which
has RedHat Enterprise Linux on it, and no git in the respository!).

	Thanks for the tip,

Subject: [Paraview] Write xml for ParaView Plugin
Message-ID: <87234629-00e4-4acb-98ef-86e84996fb0c@zstore2>

Hi everybody,
I'm writing some .xml ServerManager file for a ParaView Plugin.
Our class have a function likes this :
double calculate(vtkImagedata* voi) that return a double value calculated from the vtkImageData.

I loaded the plugin into Paraview. I use the Python Shell and when I call myReturnedValue = MyFilter.calculate(proxy) (proxy is a vtkImageData type), I always have the following error : AttributeError : 'function' object has no attribute 'calculate'

I searched in the filters.xml and found something mention about function. I wonder if we can use these descriptions to access to the function (this function is nothing similar to any vtk function, don't override any of them). I think that I have to add something like 'function = calculate' so that the function is recognized in ParaView as well as Python but I can't find any exemple.

Do you have any idea? Thank you in advance.

Hi all,

I am new for paraview, and thank in advance for all kinds of help.
My question : I am doing the visualization of a wheel rotating on the road,
and want to do some marks (e.g line..) on the wheel. The marks can move
with the wheel together, so that we can see the wheel is rotating but not
just slithering on the road. Also the color of the wheel is changing for
each time step, because the displacement is also changing in X,Y and Z
directions, but the marks should have a fixed color, which can make it
obvious to be observed. I do not know how to do it. Please help me.

Regards.

I am guessing that Vorticity in your dataset is a 3D vector (which is
typical) and that Q Criterion is a scalar.

When you take the gradient of a vector, you get a 3x3 tensor (an estimate
of the Jacobian matrix, I believe).  These 9-tuples are not as widely
recognized in ParaView/VTK filters as scalars and vectors so they will not
be listed in selection combo boxes for inputs.  You should still see the
entry listed in the Information panel, though.

In contrast, when you take the gradient of a scalar, you get a vector,
which is understood by and leveraged by many filters.

This filter, besides calculating the gradient, gives me the option to also 
calculate

  Compute Vorticity
  Compute QCriterion

I'm starting from a velocity vector field. I would expect to obtain, 
after the filter and selecting all options:

  - a gradient (here it gives only 3 main directions)
  - a vorticity vector field
  - a scalar field with QCriterion

  Of these, the vorticity field is absent, even in the information panel.

  best,

Hi,

This filter is a bit confusing to use (along with being poorly named since
it works with image data, rectilinear grids, etc.). When you choose the
Vorticity it returns the vorticity instead of the gradient field. When you
select Q criterion it returns q criterion in addition to the other gradient
quantity. It's on my radar to clean this up but I haven't gotten around to
it yet.

Subject: [Paraview] PV3.14.1 Extract Selection- PreserveTopology bug
Message-ID: <CANZf-43QO4u_xshQLtjtqOwUceR3RKuRCtrX4iKerQJWDVCmKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I seem to be running into a bug with Extract Selection / findData
functionality and need some help in resolving this. I believe this is a vtk
bug (unless someone can tell me otherwise).

*Q1. Please help me in getting this resolved. e.g. Should I/can I submit
this to the PV mantis bug collection?
*
Typical simulation data has Image and Rectilinear structures and point and
cell data but I can reproduce these problems with just the Wavelet source:

i)"Preserve Topology=1" causes all output to disappear -

Steps to reproduce:
 Create wavelet source. Click apply.
 Select Edit Menu>find data
   Change dropdown from Cell to Point
      Enter "RTData>200" and click "Run Selection Query"
       - A set of points appears. Click Extract Selection
 In the new ExtractSelection filter select "Preserve Topology" and click
apply

And here's the problem: In the Statistics Inspector you'll now see the
output has no cells, points and uses no memory...

ii) So I thought that maybe things would be better if I started with an
unstructuredgrid as a source-
I added a default threshold filter after the wavelet source that accepted
all vaules.
Now when I repeat the above steps I can get an output of points but the
PreserveTopology does not function as specified -
"If this property is set to 1 the output preserves the topology of its
input and adds an insidedness array to mark which cells are inside or out.
If 0 then the output is an unstructured grid which contains only the subset
of cells that are inside."

((Possible cause or maybe a red-herring... but... if the output is a image
data or other grid, is this filter correctly supporting RequestInformation
requirements? ie.  outInfo->Set(... TIME_STEPS() WHOLE_EXTENT(),...)
- I did not see RequestInformation implemented in
vtkExtractSelection/vtkExtractSelectionBase; Does it need to be, or perhaps
the pipeline assumes key-value pairs from the upstream filter?
-I don't yet know enough about the pipeline architecture to fix this bug
and would appreciate some help
))


----
Some context and related thoughts-
Paraview 3.14.1 (64 bit windows 7 built with standard VS2008 SP1). Python
2.7

We'd like a way to calculate typical connected mass properties (e.g total
amount of oil that is connected (according to minimum geological and
chemical properties) to a specific well volume. This is not a 'one-time'
problem; I'm looking for a clean solution rather than a quick workaround.
Once we understand how to select a subset of voxels we'll want to connect
it to the GridConnectivity filter-
*

Mass properties of connected fragments for unstructured grids.
*
*This filter works on multiblock unstructured grid inputs and also works in
parallel. It Ignores any cells with a cell data Status value of 0. It
performs connectivity to distict fragments separately. It then integrates
attributes of the fragments.*

Too bad the ExtractSelection/GridConnectivity filters do not support a GUI
way to specify the 'insideness or 'status' array names.
Q2. Would you be interested in a patch for that?

Thanks!
Lawrence.

Hi Chris,

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that others may benefit.

I guess I don't understand what exactly you are trying to accomplish.
Are you trying to specify colors at each vertex on your model? Or are
you trying to view some scalar field by pseudocoloring it?

Message-ID: <CA+=N00hbSySyRyxjQgSyiqvYq5gY_1X7R22BjJQF0WEEGw+4fA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

it is possible to edit/modify data, for example the values of some
CELL_DATA of a POLYDATA, directly from the spreadsheet view?
I know that Paraview is a "data analysis and visualization
application", but this "editing" possibility could be very useful.

Otherwise, I suppose that the other option is to make use of the
Python scripting capabilities offered...

Thank you in advance,

Regards,

Alessandro

Unfortunately, no.  Directly editing values adds problems with the
pipeline semantics.  (For example, what happens if upstream data changes?)

I found this previous discussion on the mailing list for a similar
question: http://markmail.org/message/yjhfdglqqrdh7twu.  I hope that makes
your manipulations easier.

You should do that in two step.

On property on your proxy where you set the ROI.
And one information property where you calculate...

An interesting problem :-) Does the topology of the mesh change over time
or just the positions of the points? Essentially, we need a landmark that
moves with the wheel to which we can attach something. If the topology does
not change, you can start by selecting one of more cells, extracting the
selection and then coloring those cells a solid color (you might need to
translate them slightly to avoid rendering artifacts). If that works, you
could use the Python Programmable filter to create a line that starts at
the centroid of the extracted cell. If you want to do that, let us know and
someone on this list can help you with the appropriate VTK API.

By the way, did you make sure to apply D3? disk_out_ref.ex2 is not
partitioned so by default it would be loaded entirely onto MPI rank 0.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Streamtracer
Message-ID: <000301cd4471$710d6970$53283c50$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello Berk,

absolutely. After applying both filter, D3 and StreamTracer, I've visualized
the partitions with vtkProcessId to check whether D3 was applied or not and
was able to see that the stream lines had different (homogenous) colors
depending on their region. The D3 filter is only applied by more than one
MPI process.

To make things clearer:

##   Bulitin (no D3): 10.063 seconds
##   1 MPI-Process (no D3): 10.162 seconds
##   4 MPI-Processes (D3): 15.615 seconds
##   8 MPI-Processes(D3):  14.103 seconds

and 100.000 seed points:

##   Bulitin (no D3): 100.603 seconds
##   1 MPI-Process (no D3): 100.967 seconds
##   4 MPI-Processes(D3):  168.1 seconds
##   8 MPI-Processes(D3):  171.325 seconds

Sorry, for the confusion.

Regrads,
Stephan

By the way, did you make sure to apply D3? disk_out_ref.ex2 is not
partitioned so by default it would be loaded entirely onto MPI rank 0.

Hello Leo,

ok, I took the "disk_out_ref.ex2" example data set and did some time
measurements. Remember, my machine has 4 Cores + HyperThreading.

My first observation is that PV seems to have a problem with distributing
the data when the Multi-Core option (GUI) is enabled. When PV is started
with builtin Multi-Core I was not able to apply a stream tracer with more
than 1000 seed points (PV is freezing and never comes back). Otherwise, when
pvserver processes has been started manually I was able to set up to 100.000
seed points. Is it a bug?

Now let's have a look on the scaling performance. As you suggested, I've
used the D3 filter for distributing the data along the processes. The stream
tracer execution time for 10.000 seed points:

## ? Bulitin: 10.063 seconds
## ? 1 MPI-Process (no D3): 10.162 seconds
## ? 4 MPI-Processes: 15.615 seconds
## ? 8 MPI-Processes: 14.103 seconds

and 100.000 seed points:

## ? Bulitin: 100.603 seconds
## ? 1 MPI-Process (no D3): 100.967 seconds
## ? 4 MPI-Processes: 168.1 seconds
## ? 8 MPI-Processes: 171.325 seconds

I cannot see any positive scaling behavior here. Maybe is this example not
appropriate for scaling measurements?

One more thing: I've visualized the vtkProcessId and saw that the whole
vector field is partitioned. I thought, that each streamline is integrated
in its own process. But it seems that this is not the case. This could
explain my scaling issues: In cases of small vector fields the overhead of
synchronization becomes too large and decreases the overall performance.

My suggestion is to have a parallel StreamTracer which is built for a single
machine with several threads. Could be worth to randomly distribute the
seeds over all available (local) processes? Of course, each process have
access on the whole vector field.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hi, Stephan,
? I did measure the performance at some point and was able to get fairly
decent speed up with more processors. So I am surprised you are seeing huge
latency.

? Of course, the performance is sensitive to the input.? It is also
sensitive to how readers distribute data. So, one thing you might want to
try is to attach the "D3" filter to the reader.

? If that doesn't help,? I will be happy to get your data and take a look.

Leo,

As I mentioned in my initial post of this thread: I used the up-to-date
master branch of ParaView. Which means I have already used your
implementation.

I can imagine, to parallelize this algorithm can be very tough. And I can
see that distribute the calculation over 8 processes does not lead to a nice
scaling.

But I don't understand this huge amount of latency when using the
StreamTracer in a Cave-Mode with two view ports and two pvserver processes
on the same machine (extra machine for the client). I guess the tracer
filter is applied for each viewport separately? This would be ok as long as
both filter executions run parallel. And I doubt that this is the case.

Can you help to clarify my problem?

Stephan

Hi Stephan,

The parallel stream tracer uses the partitioning of the grid to determine
which process does the integration. When the streamline exits the subdomain
of a process there is a search to see if it enters a subdomain assigned to
any other processes before figuring it whether it has left the entire
domain.

Leo, copied here, has been improving the streamline implementation inside of
VTK so you may want to get his newer version. It is a pretty tough algorithm
to parallelize efficiently without making any assumptions on the flow or
partitioning.

Hello,

I have a question related to the parallelism of the stream tracer: As I
understand the code right, each line integration (trace) is processed in an
own MPI process. Right?

To test the scalability of the Stream tracer I've load a structured
(curvilinear) grid and applied the filter with a Seed resolution of 1500 and
check the timings in a single and multi-thread (Multi Core enabled in PV
GUI) situation.

I was really surprised that multi core slows done the execution time to 4
seconds. The single core takes only 1.2 seconds. Data migration cannot be
the explanation for that behavior (0.5 seconds). What is the problem here?

Hi Seb, 
   Thank you for your reply.
   I'm sorry that I don't quite understand your instructions. I'm really new to ParaView.
   With my little knowledge in ParaView, I'll try to understand as follow : 
   - First, I have to write my .xml file with a tab that have "function" declaration? So how to declare these values cause I don't understand the exemples in the *.xml file (filters, writers; etc.)
   - And then by the declaration as your instructions about information_only yesterday?
 
   Can you be a little more explicit? What is ROI?
   
   Thank you very much for your kindness.

You should do that in two step.

And one information property where you calculate...

As far as I can see, if I generate LIC with, say, shear then you have to
use shear as the variable on the surface below the LIC itself.  Would it be
possible, for example, to create the LIC using shear but display pressure
on the surface?

Subject: [Paraview] Function PrintfSelf - Utilisation in ParaView

Hi Utkarsh,

Thank you for your reply
.
I tried to add a small code into Prinself function to know it's good.
So I add : 
os << extent << " Here is my attribute  : " << this->myAttribute << "\n";

Recompiled, load the plugin into Paraview.
I tried print reader2.GetClientSideObject() (reader 2 is a output type vtkImageData);

There is something, but I din't find any information about "myAttribute"

I wonder if we have to modify the .xml file, for exemple command="PrintSelf" to acces to this function?

Thank you very much again for your help.

Tuan Ha

If you're not running in client-server mode, you can simply do the
following in the Python shell to call the PrintSelf method:

Hi folks,

I am planning to create new material (ebook articles, webinars/videos,
on-site courses) covering VTK and ParaView topics this summer. Some of
this will be free, some will be available for purchase only. In
general I am thinking of advanced and domain specific content.

What topics would you find particularly interesting and useful?

Thank you for your suggestions,

try this:

Is that the class you were expecting?

Are you saying LIC with one variable and coloring with another? (Not
sure what you  mean by "display pressure on the surface"). You can
indeed color using another variable.

    I have another question, I hope that you can help me.
    So, my class vtkOtsuSphereSource has an attribute name "OpThreshold" of type double.
    I want to Set it value using ParaView.
    I followed an tutorial from which I can get my job done by adding some tab in my .xml file. the tutorial I told is in the IEEE Vis 09 conference.

    So, to set OpThreshold, I added the followed tab : 
   <DoubleVectorProperty name="OpThreshold"  command="SetOpThreshold" number_of_elements ="1" default_values="0">
   </DoubleVectorProperty>    
    And normaly, I can entre a value in a box in ParaView GUI. but I have a Core Dump, here is what I have as error :

That is what I mean (so the surface of the object I've put LIC on to paint
as a scalar that's different to the vector I've made LIC with).

How is this done?

Just change the Color by entry from Solid Color to one of the fields.

If this is not working for you, what paraview version and what
platform are you on?

Subject: [Paraview] Howto read files with a numerical extension that are not
	a timeseries?
Message-ID: <CANZf-40HnrF+FTPryQEkB2SjH-bJ2jPYbPGfOOZJbpbbOsUJww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have data files generated by UTChem that are numerically ordered
that we read with our own custom Paraview reader-
mymodel.HIST01
mymodel.HIST02

However these "HIST" files correspond to different objects (vtkTable
data) NOT timeseries data.
When we rename one of them to just "HIST" our custom reader can import
the file. We now need a more robust solution.

How do we override Paraview's TimeSeries proxy so that we can select
one or more of these files and read them in as separate vtk objects?

Note, we are building our own Paraview so we could patch Paraview code
if we have to but we'd rather not!
Some advice on where to start would be appreciated (e.g. similar file
readers or Paraview classes that we need to extend/modify).

Thanks,

Nemo.

Hi David,
I'm on 3.14.1 (64-bit) on both Linux and Mac.  Surface LIC is selected in
the same menu as Surface, Points etc.  The option you are mentioning (2
places left) is where you need to select the variable to make the LIC with
so if you change that, the LIC changes tool:

[image: Inline images 1]

So you can't change the do independently.

Go to the bottom of the Display tab. Change the Vectors field to something
other than what is set in the Color By field.

Your c++ class has:
double calculateOptimalThreshold(vtkImageData *voi)

But your xml property specification says paraview should call this:
void calculateOptimalThreshold(double *argument)

To pass in an image data you will need to use a ProxyProperty, not a
double vector property.

Subject: [Paraview] How to read individual files with a numerical extension
 that are not a timeseries?
Message-ID: <CANZf-43732mHkjHW6b=wkzoMGS7TAJiX3ZVpORe3ZwPcQhqVNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

We have data files generated by UTChem that are numerically ordered that we
wish to read with our own custom Paraview application "RVA"-

mymodel.HIST01
mymodel.HIST02

However these "HIST" files will correspond to different objects (vtkTable
data) NOT timeseries data.
When we rename one of them to just "HIST" our custom reader can import the
file. We now need a more robust solution to be able to read their original
names.

How do we override Paraview's TimeSeries proxy so that we can select one or
more of these files and read them in as separate vtk objects?

Note, we are building our own Paraview so we could patch Paraview code if
we have to but we'd rather not!
Some advice on where to start would be appreciated (e.g. similar file
readers or Paraview classes that we need to extend/modify).

Thanks,

Nemo.

Ah thank, I now see they are on different tabs (I thought they were
linked).  Is it possible to change the opacity level of the LIC?

That really helpful your reply.
But, I always have errors with 
===========================================================
   <DoubleVectorProperty name="OpThreshold"  command="SetOpThreshold" number_of_elements ="1" default_values="0">
   </DoubleVectorProperty>    
    And normaly, I can entre a value in a box in ParaView GUI. but I have a Core Dump, here is what I have as error : 
 
paraview: /home/thtran/PV/ParaView/src/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/vtkSIProxy.cxx:453: virtual bool vtkSIProxy::ReadXMLProperty(vtkPVXMLElement*): Assertion `!name.empty() && this->GetSIProperty(name.c_str()) == __null' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
 ============================================================= 

It's just a simple tab for Adding GUI parameters, so I don't know where is the error comes from. There is nothing "empty" as we analyse the error.

Your c++ class has:
double calculateOptimalThreshold(vtkImageData *voi)

But your xml property specification says paraview should call this:
void calculateOptimalThreshold(double *argument)

To pass in an image data you will need to use a ProxyProperty, not a
double vector property.

On the display tab, I believe there's a setting that allows you to change
the "intensity" of the LIC.

Look at the comments above vtkSIProxy.cxx:453

  // Since the XML is "cleaned" out, we are assured that there are no duplicate
  // properties.

You have duplicated property name, "OpThreshold". Try to use
"OpThresholdInfo" for "GetOpThreshold"

Hi Stephan,

I've experienced the scaling behavior that you report when I was working 
on a project that required generating millions of streamlines for a 
topological mapping algorithm interactively in ParaView. To get the 
required scaling I wrote a stream tracer that uses a load on demand 
approach with tunable block cache so that all ranks could integrate any 
streamline and stay busy throughout the entire computation. It was very 
effective on our data and I've used it to integrate 30 Million 
streamlines in about 10min on 256 cores. If you really need better 
scalability than the distributed data tracing approach implemented in 
PV, you might take a look at our work. The down side of our approach is 
that in order to provide the demand loading the reader has to implement 
a vtk object that provides an api giving the integrator direct access to 
I/O functionality. In case you're interested the stream tracer is class 
is vtkSQFieldTracer and our reader is vtkSQBOVReader. The latest release 
could be found here

Lawrence,

Very good point. I'd definitely vote posting this on the mailing list,
as I'd like to get feed back from the users/developers before we
decide what would be the best approach for dealing with names. A patch
is always appreciated :).

For other bugs you mention, yes, mantis is indeed the best approach.
For non trivial issues, after reporting the bug, if might be
worthwhile to post on the mailing list to raise awareness. A bug
requiring some major work is more likely to be fixed if there more
people are affected by it -- but that's totally optional. We do parse
over the mantis bugs periodically.

Hi Utkarsh,

I'd be happy to post this/discuss this on the Paraview mailing list or
Paraview developer public  mailing lists
- if so, let me know which one is a better fit.

Feature suggestion:
 Define, document and implement a convention on how array names are
consistently mapped to script variables even when the original array name is
not a valid variable name.
This would affect the "Calculator" "FindData" and "Python Calculator"
features (possibly more).


As a concrete example, suppose you had a point array with the name "1.1
Phase: Total (s)#2" . You would be able to reference it in a script
calculation as
"_1_1_Phase__Total_s__2"


This could be implemented as an instance method eg "GetSanitizedName()" on
vtkArray
(that returns a variable name compliant name),
 or we leave vtk alone and implement it as a few static helper methods to
be used just before variables
are referenced in client languages / or calculators.

Anyway, What do you think?

 I'd be happy to help implement an initial first pass of this.
(It would be useful for RVA - our custom version of ParaView where we have
many geologic and oil based variables we read from other packages)

Best,
Lawrence.

Hi Tuan,

a ParaView proxy is a wrapper class that allow ParaView to abstract
the real location of the vtkObject that are managed by those proxies.
Even though you are using ParaView as a single process, its design is
to also work on cluster or super computer.

Saying that, a proxy is either a regular proxy which just wrap a
vtkObject using properties, or it can be a sourceProxy. A source proxy
only handle vtkAlgorithm sub-classes which is basically any pipeline
filter from VTK that use OutputPort and Connection. Those sourceProxy
are use to compose the pipeline.

In order to control its vtkObject a proxy use an XML descriptor that
name the concrete vtk class to use and list all the methods that we
want to be exposed into ParaView in order to control that concrete
object.
Those properties are usually use to set some values to the vtkObject
itself. Or eventually query the vtkObject and retrieve those values.
But there is no way to set and get at the same time. This is precisely
why you need to provide the voi (and not you ROI like I wrote) as a
property (unless you are using a SourceProxy and you get it from your
vtkAlgorithm) and get the computation result from another information
property.

If that helps, you can look at that definition and the
vtkPVRayCastPickingHelper.h file.
We set a bunch of property and then we use an information property to
get the result of a computation. Look were we create that
PickingHelper and how we use it...

+    <Proxy name="PickingHelper"
+      class="vtkPVRayCastPickingHelper" processes="dataserver">
+      <Documentation>
+        Proxy used to pick a point of a surface mesh.
+      </Documentation>
+      <DoubleVectorProperty name="PointA"

+      </DoubleVectorProperty>
+      <DoubleVectorProperty name="PointB"
+        command="SetPointB"
+        number_of_elements="3"
+        default_values="0.0 0.0 1.0">
+      </DoubleVectorProperty>
+      <DoubleVectorProperty name="Intersection"
+        command="GetIntersection" information_only="1" number_of_elements="3"
+        default_values="0.0 0.0 0.0">
+      </DoubleVectorProperty>
+      <Property name="Update" command="ComputeIntersection"></Property>
+      <ProxyProperty name="Input"
+        command="SetInput">
+        <Documentation>
+          The input from which the selection is extracted.
+        </Documentation>
+      </ProxyProperty>
+      <ProxyProperty name="Selection"
+        command="SetSelection">
+        <Documentation>
+          The selection that is used to reduced the input.
+        </Documentation>
+      </ProxyProperty>
+    </Proxy>

Hope this help,

Seb

Hi,

I'm using file.%d.xmf for my xdmf files and was hoping paraview could
detect them as a time series but seems it cannot -- I had used this before
with my .vtk and it used to work. Is paraview supposed to work with xdmf
files in this way or am I supposed to do something else?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Question about Integrate Variables Filter
Message-ID: <692410C8-7DE1-4183-B048-C8115416EA59@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm now comparing integration results of each postprocessors.
I made a simple Quadratic VTK model as below:
> # vtk DataFile Version 2.0

> QuadCell
> ASCII
> DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID
> POINTS 4 FLOAT
> 0 0 0
> 1 0 0
> 0 1 0
> 1 1 0
> CELLS 1 5
> 4 0 1 3 2
> CELL_TYPES 1
> 9
> POINT_DATA 4
> SCALARS scalar FLOAT 1
> LOOKUP_TABLE DEFAULT
> 0.0
> 1.0
> 2.0
> 4.0

When I apply Point Data to Cell Data filter,
scalar values are interpolated as 1.75.
It may be calculated as (0.0+1.0+2.0+4.0)/4.0.

But when I apply Integrate Variables filter,
scalar value is integrated as 1.833....
The area value of quadratic cell is 1.0, so I thought
integrated values should be equal to cell data.

How the integrated value is calculated?

Hello Burlen,

thank you very much for your post. I really would like to test your plugin
and so I've start to build it. Unfortunately I've got a lot of compiler
errors (e.g. vtkstd isn't used in PV master anymore). Which PV version is
the base for your plugin?

Stephan

Hi Stephan,

I've experienced the scaling behavior that you report when I was working on
a project that required generating millions of streamlines for a topological
mapping algorithm interactively in ParaView. To get the required scaling I
wrote a stream tracer that uses a load on demand approach with tunable block
cache so that all ranks could integrate any streamline and stay busy
throughout the entire computation. It was very effective on our data and
I've used it to integrate 30 Million streamlines in about 10min on 256
cores. If you really need better scalability than the distributed data
tracing approach implemented in PV, you might take a look at our work. The
down side of our approach is that in order to provide the demand loading the
reader has to implement a vtk object that provides an api giving the
integrator direct access to I/O functionality. In case you're interested the
stream tracer is class is vtkSQFieldTracer and our reader is vtkSQBOVReader.
The latest release could be found here

Hi Seb,
  I wonder if you can precise some details for me.
  With information_only="1", we can tell ParaView at this property is not more than a value. I do agree with you.
  But where can we find this property? Does it appear somewhere so we can have a look at it? I think that it will appear in the "Properties" tab, but there is nothing.
  So, I guess that the property may appear in the "Information tab" (below the Pipeline Brower where we can find "Properties, Display and Information")?
  Thank you very much indeed.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Write xml for ParaView Plugin

Hi Tuan,

a ParaView proxy is a wrapper class that allow ParaView to abstract
the real location of the vtkObject that are managed by those proxies.
Even though you are using ParaView as a single process, its design is
to also work on cluster or super computer.

Saying that, a proxy is either a regular proxy which just wrap a
vtkObject using properties, or it can be a sourceProxy. A source proxy
only handle vtkAlgorithm sub-classes which is basically any pipeline
filter from VTK that use OutputPort and Connection. Those sourceProxy
are use to compose the pipeline.

In order to control its vtkObject a proxy use an XML descriptor that
name the concrete vtk class to use and list all the methods that we
want to be exposed into ParaView in order to control that concrete
object.
Those properties are usually use to set some values to the vtkObject
itself. Or eventually query the vtkObject and retrieve those values.
But there is no way to set and get at the same time. This is precisely
why you need to provide the voi (and not you ROI like I wrote) as a
property (unless you are using a SourceProxy and you get it from your
vtkAlgorithm) and get the computation result from another information
property.

If that helps, you can look at that definition and the
vtkPVRayCastPickingHelper.h file.
We set a bunch of property and then we use an information property to
get the result of a computation. Look were we create that
PickingHelper and how we use it...

+ +  class="vtkPVRayCastPickingHelper" processes="dataserver">
+  
+  Proxy used to pick a point of a surface mesh.
+  
+  +  command="SetPointA"
+  number_of_elements="3"
+  default_values="0.0 0.0 0.0">
+  
+  +  command="SetPointB"
+  number_of_elements="3"
+  default_values="0.0 0.0 1.0">
+  
+  +  command="GetIntersection" information_only="1" number_of_elements="3"
+  default_values="0.0 0.0 0.0">
+  
+  
+  +  command="SetInput">
+  
+   The input from which the selection is extracted.
+  
+  
+  +  command="SetSelection">
+  
+   The selection that is used to reduced the input.
+  
+  
+ 

Hope this help,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Compute Derivatives component order??
Message-ID: <4FD1F426.2080301@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi,

I think I did found an inconsistency in the component order in the 
compute derivative filter.

The web page 
http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/4.0/html/classvtkHexahedron.html#a16 said

Compute derivatives given cell...
  On the other hand, if computing derivatives of velocity (vx,vy,vz) 
dim=3, 24 values are supplied ((vx,vy,vz)1, (vx,vy,vz)2, ....()8), and 9 
deriv values are returned*((d(vx)/dx),(d(vx)/dy),(d(vx)/dz), 
(d(vy)/dx),(d(vy)/dy), (d(vy)/dz), (d(vz)/dx),(d(vz)/dy),(d(vz)/dz)).*

I created a simple test to verified the order (file attached), with 9 
vectorial fields that after the Compute Derivative will generate a 
tensor full of zeros but with one component equal to one.

for example
If we follow the documentation the field dxdy must generate a tensor 
with the terms
0 1 0  0 0 0 0 0 0

but paraview gives
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

can any one confirm this???

working with paraview 3.14.1 64bit Linux

Thanks

Hi Tuan,

the ParaView UI and those things are two different things. There is no
matching at all.
What you can look at is inside the Python shell.

You create the proxy, and basically every property will be expose like
proxy.PropertyName.
In fact, you have the completion inside ParaView python shell to help you out.
Or if you prefer, you can do dir(proxy).
Moreover, if you use ParaViewWeb and a JavaScript console like in
firebug, you do have the completion as well.

proxy.set${PropertyName}( ... )
proxy.get${PropertyName}()

But as I said before, you need to trigger a manual update for
information property otherwise you will get the latest cached value or
the default value that you set in the XML.

Thank you very much Seb,
   Indeed, I found in
   /ParaView/install/lib/Paraview-3.14/site-packages/paraview/
  lots of .py file which define the usage of ServerManager, specially servermanager.py.
  ......... And it's 100% like your advice.

  Have a nice day Seb :)

Hi Tuan,

the ParaView UI and those things are two different things. There is no
matching at all.
What you can look at is inside the Python shell.

You create the proxy, and basically every property will be expose like
proxy.PropertyName.
In fact, you have the completion inside ParaView python shell to help you out.
Or if you prefer, you can do dir(proxy).
Moreover, if you use ParaViewWeb and a JavaScript console like in
firebug, you do have the completion as well.

proxy.set${PropertyName}( ... )
proxy.get${PropertyName}()

But as I said before, you need to trigger a manual update for
information property otherwise you will get the latest cached value or
the default value that you set in the XML.

Someone told me that you have to clear your build directory completely and
start a fresh PV build.

Hi Stephan,

Oh, thanks for the update, I wasn't aware of these changes. I have been
working with 3.14.1.

Hi Yumin,
  Thank you for your reply. 
  Yeah, I didn't pay attention, my Property name is duplicated. I have OpThreshold with command="SetOpThreshod" and command="GetOpThreshold" as well. I modified this and there is no more error.

Look at the comments above vtkSIProxy.cxx:453

 // Since the XML is "cleaned" out, we are assured that there are no duplicate

You have duplicated property name, "OpThreshold". Try to use
"OpThresholdInfo" for "GetOpThreshold"

@Utkarsh: I agree, it seems to be the same bug

@Berk: Thank you very much, that pushed me to solve the problem.

Currently it does not work work with our own filter (CellData is not 
known) but
when I export to vtk and read it works.

Currently I still work on the details of the python algorithm but in 
principal it works.

Anyway, any hint on what is missing for our own plugin reader?

Hi,
  I have recently gotten Burlen's code and updated it to work with the
latest ParaView.  Aside from vtkstd, there are also a few backward
incompatible VTK changes ( see the VTK6.0 section on the VTK wiki).   But
it is not too much work. I will be happy send either of you my code changes
if you need a reference.

Leo

OK, you had me a little worried there, ;)

I will send you some instructions and example data to test with, our 
network is down due to an unexpected power outage so it won't be today.

Subject: [Paraview] Trouble with "information_only" GUI property in paraview
	filter
Message-ID: <4FD2471E.20104@gatech.edu>

Hello,

I have been developing a feature tracking filter plug-in for paraview 
for a couple weeks. I am currently trying to improve the plug-in GUI, 
but ran into an issue.

I want the plug-in to return some basic information to the user in the 
GUI, so I added a property to the server xml file like:

<IntVectorProperty
    name="NumberOfFeatures"
    label="Number Of Features"
    command="GetNumFeatures"
    number_of_elements="1"
    default_values="0"
    information_only="1">
<Documentation>
       Number of features in the field.
</Documentation>
</IntVectorProperty>

with corresponding code in the class definition:
vtkGetMacro(NumFeatures, int);

However, the property does not appear on the plug-in gui. Similar 
"input" GUI properties work fine,  but I've been messing around for a 
couple hours and I cannot get this "output" GUI property to appear. Is 
this specific to the "filters" ProxyGroup - because I have found other 
plug-ins that use essentially the same xml code to output information? 
Do you have any suggestions on how to make such output properties 
display and work?

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,

You can add the following to your xml to see if it helps.

show="1"

If this property does show up after adding that, it should be
displayed as disabled since it is read-only. If it does not help, this
could be a bug.

Hi Yumin,

Thank you for the response. I tried this and still no luck, the property 
still won't appear. For reference, my new xml was

<IntVectorProperty
    name="NumberOfFeatures"
    label="Num Features"
    command="GetNumFeatures"
    number_of_elements="1"
    default_values="0"
    information_only="1"
    show="1">
<Documentation>
       Number of features in the field.
</Documentation>
</IntVectorProperty>

I'm pretty sure that the property is actually being made and called, 
because I debugged paraview and found that the GetNumFeatures method was 
being called. It just seems that the property isn't being displayed. 
Could this really be a bug in paraview?

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Leo,

Thanks, yes please send your fixes, or you could also push them to 
github. Which ever you prefer.

Hi Alex,

If you can debug into pqNamedWidgets::createWidgets(), and see where
and why this property is being skipped, it will help to narrow down
the problem, especially around this piece of logic (starting with line
892).


    // skip information properties
    if((!propertiesToShow.contains(propertyName) && informationOnly) ||
        SMProperty->GetIsInternal())
      {
      continue;
      }

    vtkPVXMLElement *hints = SMProperty->GetHints();

    // skip non-summary properties if summaryOnly is true
    if(summaryOnly && (!hints ||
hints->FindNestedElementByName("ShowInSummaryPanel") == 0))
      {
      continue;
      }


HTH,
Yumin

Hi Yumin,

Thank you for the suggestion. I debugged into pqNamedWidgets, and found 
that my property was being excluded from the propertiesToShow list, even 
with the show="1" setting. When I manually switched it in the debugger, 
the property showed up and worked correctly.

The issue seems to go a step deeper. The pqNamedWidgets::createWidgets 
function calls pqNamedWidgets::processHints. Now process hints scans 
through the list of hints in the following loop.

   for (unsigned int i = 0; i < numHints; i++)
     {
     vtkPVXMLElement *element = hints->GetNestedElement(i);
     if (QString("Property") == element->GetName())
       {
       QString propertyName = element->GetAttribute("name");
       int showProperty;
       if (element->GetScalarAttribute("show", &showProperty))
         {
         if (showProperty)
           {
           propertiesToShow.push_back(propertyName);
           }
         else
           {
           propertiesToHide.push_back(propertyName);
           }
         }
       }
     }

First it checks if the hint is named "Property" (with the attribute 
"show"), but this one is actually named "ShowInMenu". So it seems that 
the hints data structure is not being set up correctly.

Do you happen to have any other thoughts of ways to get this property to 
display?

Thanks again,
Alex

Hi all,

I was eventually able to work out this display issue. The show command  
has to be set as a separate hint in the source proxy, like so:

<IntVectorProperty
    name="NumberOfFeatures"
    label="Num Features"
    command="GetNumFeatures"
    number_of_elements="1"
    default_values="0"
    information_only="1">
<Documentation>
       Number of features in the field.
</Documentation>
</IntVectorProperty>

<Hints>
<Property name="NumberOfFeatures" show="1"/>
</Hints>

I hope this saves someone else the trouble. Thanks again Yumin for 
pointing me in the right direction.

-Alex

I'm getting what you expected for gradient of dxdy -- 0 1 0  0 0 0 0 0 0.
I'm on 3.14.1 64 bit windows but the results should be the same.

I just found out that this "hints" behavior is actually documented here:

existence of a Chinese version but don't know their current
statuses. Technically, modifying ParaView to handle menus and message
texts in foreign languages should not be difficult thanks to the
internationalization framework of Qt. However I don't think
translating all menus and message texts and (more importantly) keeping
the translated resources up-to-date will be an easy task for an active
project like ParaView (it depends on what amount of available human
resources you have though).

Meanwhile, our group have translated Kenneth Moreland's The ParaView
Tutorial to Japanese (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial).
The translation was last updated for PV 3.8 thus looks a bit outdated
regarding the version number but most of the contents are still
applicable to the current version, becuase the tutorial is more or
less focused on the background philosophy and knowledge of ParaView
while dealing with practical exercises on its operation in rather
version independent way.

It would be great if someone creates a Japanese version of ParaView,
but we find it more realistic to translate such textbook materials
than to create and maintain a translated version of PV if available
resources are limited.

Hi all,


Now I found a bug of the filter.

My ParaView's version is 3.14.1.
I define node names as below:
> c--d
> |  |
> a--b

Case 1: a=1.0, b=0.0, c=0.0, d=0.0
Integration Value = 0.33333

Case 2: a=0.0, b=1.0, c=0.0, d=0.0
Integration Value = 0.16666

Case 3: a=0.0, b=0.0, c=1.0, d=0.0
Integration Value = 0.16666

Case 4: a=0.0, b=0.0, c=0.0, d=1.0
Integration Value = 0.33333

So Integration Values are calculated as (2*a+b+c+2*d)/6.
I think it's not a good result.

Hello people,

I would like to know if it is possible to fuse two 3d models, one with a solid and one with a transparent color. This dataset should be afterwards saved within a vrml file for a rapid prototype printer.

Is this possible?
How?

Thx,
Chris

Hi,
   This is not really a bug, but just what the linear precision integration
does.  As you can see in vtkIntegrateAttributes.cxx:215, the quad cell is
basically cut into two triangles along a diagonal, integration is done for
each triangle and the results are added up.   So, depending where your "1"
falls on a diagonal vertex, you will get different results.

No. That's not supported. Although, it should be easy to add support for.

Hi, Sam,
  I am still having trouble with the file. I tried to open it with several
programs on windows   and linux platforms and could not open it.  If you
have a .tex file, maybe you can try to post that instead.
thanks,
Leo

Hi Chris,

If the point is to have the VRML to contains both, by loading the 2
objects in the scene, exporting the scene will do the trick.

If not that will be trickier but still doable. You will need to
generate a given scalar across the 2 datasets and merge the geometry.
Then use your custom scalar to apply the right color and opacity
across the whole geometry.

I am not sure why you "Play" would not work. Paraview automatically
detects file series and reads them in as time for *.vtk files.
Attached are two files. When I open them and hit play, I do see the
sphere changing.

Hello Sebastien,

thx for your answer. I tried to do so and tried to save it in a vrml. 
However I have troubles if I import the geometric structure from vtk with two colors or if I want to create a geometric structure with two colors.

The colors stay always the same and if I want to do a appended geometry I only get an error message:

ERROR: In /Users/partyd/Kitware/ParaView-3.8/src/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 827
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x30cacf10): Input for connection index 1 on input port index 0 for algorithm vtkAppendPolyData(0x3022e260) is of type vtkMultiBlockDataSet, but a vtkPolyData is required.


Please can you explain me why that happens?

Thx,
Chris

Hi Leo & Sam,


Thanks for your replies.
The bilinear integration method which Sam wrote was just I intended.
I could open the PDF document on Mac OS X and iOS (iPhone/iPad).

Additionally, I found a similar problems on Temporal Statistics filter.
I prepared two transiend data sets.

> Case 1:
> t=1.0, scalar=1
> t=2.0, scalar=2
> t=4.0, scalar=4
> 
> Case 2:
> t=1.0, scalar=1
> t=1.1, scalar=2
> t=4.0, scalar=4

Both Temporal Average Values are 2.3333.
And if I apply Temporal Interpolation filter and Temporal Statistics filter again,
there are different results.
The reason is the Temporal Static filter is just calculating sum average,
and transient time values are not considered.

I'd like to get time-weighted average values by Temporal Statistics filter.

As you can see in vtkIntegrateAttributes.cxx:215, the quad cell is basically cut into two triangles along a diagonal, integration is done for each triangle and the results are added up.   So, depending where your "1" falls on a diagonal vertex, you will get different results.

Hi, Sam & Magician,
   These are good ideas and we will definitely improve these functions as
you suggested.

   I have opened bug reports to keep track:
   - http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=13235 for the quad integration
   - http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=13234  for the temporal statistics

   If you manage to implement fixes before we get to it,  please feel free
also to post your solution and we will try to incorporate them into the
repository.

thanks,

Leo

Subject: [Paraview] Bug? VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE

Hi, Beno?t,

 This is a bug.  We will fix it soon. I have opened a bug based on your
report: http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=13236

 The basic problem is that vertices of high order elements with the same
coordinates are always merged before rending ( by
vtkUnstructuredGridGeometryFilter).  This is not the right behaviour.

thanks for catching it!

Leo

It seems that on of your dataset is a multi block. So before appending
it you should merge those block in order to make a single dataset.
Then you should be able to append it.

You should be able to add a scalar using the calculator filter and
then when you render your data, you use that scalar.
Then you edit the lookup table + the transfer function so the opacity
could be linear to the scalar that you set across your geometry.

But If the point is only to export a VRML, there is a much much easier
way, by changing the opacity of the object (Display tab) and exporting
that with the rest of the loaded data.

Hello Sebastien,

Thx for the answer, but how could I add a color to each model if I merge it? Furthermore how could I make one model transparent and one a solid color? 

Thx, Chris

That's the tricker part, because your scalar + the lookup table will
determine the color.
That's also the reason why I asked you why you just export your scene
in VRML with the correct settings color+opacity of all you objects ?

Do you need them to be defined as a single mesh inside the VRML ?

Thx, I want to fuse two structures of radiologic datasets. Both are from brain vessels. The embeded model is the fluidic pattern (solid color) and the other outer model is the morphology (transparent with less opacity) one. 

Thx,
Chris
Ps: I am currently texting from my phone but if u want I can give u afterwards a link with the datasets?

What I try to say, is if you load all the files in ParaView and export
the scene as VRML you will have a single VRML file the way you want.
So I'm not sure why this solution doesn't fit your needs.

Thx, I think it would be great in the way you described it. But I am still a beginner in Paraview and therefore it sounds a bit complicated for me. 

I added the color filter, selected color by scalars and pressed the button edit color map. There I tried to adjust range, scalars, lookup tables (color space) and the opacity. 
Anyway the scalar does not change and still stays the same. I tried it now 50 times.

I would be really happy, if you could tell me what I did wrong?

Chris

Message-ID: <B49DB0FBD1CE214C8C21786EAEE843A4360A8653@V-ABEL.lincoln.ac.nz>

Hi

I'm using the ParaViewWeb Superbuild script to build paraviewweb (only change is to compile with OSMESA) but am getting the following error:

vtkPWProcessingEngine.cxx: In member function ?double vtkPWProcessingEngine::ProcessAndSendImage(const char*, vtkImageData*)?:
vtkPWProcessingEngine.cxx:439: error: ?class vtkJPEGWriter? has no member named ?SetInputData?
vtkPWProcessingEngine.cxx:448: error: ?class vtkPNGWriter? has no member named ?SetInputData?

I had previously successfully built ParaViewWeb but have since rebuilt the machine that it was on and can't get it to work any longer.  Any thoughts?

Thanks
Stuart

I want to add a scalar with the calculator and do the coloring afterwards by scalar data.
Can someone help me out and explain me how it works please?

What you try to do is the most complex solution, in the case you
really need a single mesh node inside your VRML file.
If you don't need that, then the actions are load the files, set
colors, export and done.

Seb

Action 1: In the menu: File > Open + In the "Properties" tab click on "Apply
Action 2: To change the color, go in the "Display" tab and click on
"Color by" = "Solid Color", the "Set Solid Color..." => The color
apply to the object that is selected in the pipeline browser.
Action 3: In the menu: File > Export + choose the VRML format and you
should be done...

Okay I found it. Just if someone needs it. 
Here are the points.

Properties: Result Array Name change to scalars and add a value by the calculator.
Furthermore: display-> color by scalar and add a color list.

Hi Stuart,

the issue is related to the fact that ParaView master is using the latest
VTK that break some backward compatibility. To solve the issue, you have
two choices.

1) Either update ParaViewWeb from its repository so it could work with
ParaView/master.

2) Downgrade the ParaView that is used to use the latest release 3.14.1.

I would recommend to do the following: (start again from scratch)

mkdir code-pvweb
cd code-pvweb
git clone http://paraview.org/ParaViewWeb.git src
cd src
git checkout -b use-release pv-3.14.1
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ../src/SuperBuild

[configure cmake...]

make -j9
make install

Normally you should be able to go through now. The only known bug is
related to some invalid path in the install directory were we end up having
a directory /bin/bin/ and /lib/lib/... You just need to fix those
duplicated names manually. (When I'll find the time, I'll fixed that)

Subject: [Paraview] Relative paths in state file
Message-ID: <4FD73747.1040207@gfz-potsdam.de>

Hello,

In state files there are absolute paths stored. If I try to change it to 
relative (the files just in the same folder):

<Property name="FileNames" id="2794.FileNames" number_of_elements="30">
<Element index="0" value="data_1.vtk"/>
...

It doesn't work anymore:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\Parallel\vtkPDataSetReader.cxx, line 881
vtkPDataSetReader (000000001CB15720): Initialize: Could not open file 
data_1.vtk

Is this possible to make it working with relative paths?
Thanks.

Alexander

Try applying the "Temporal Interpolator" filter.

Is there any plans to implement this?

This feature seems to be easy to implement and particularly useful, 
taking into account that ParaView is cross-platform.

Hello Sebastien,

thx for your help. You are right it works great with a solid color. I only would like to have a bigger selection for them. Cann?t I take a color table? Or can I import colors?
I tried to add a scalar but the scalar disappears  after the export.
Is there a opportunity to save the opacity as well in the vrml file?

Have a good day,
Chris

Hello Chris,

I don't understand how you can't choose any color that you want.
Basically on my Mac, I have access to the 16 Billions choices... Do
you need more ?
For the opacity, scroll down in the display tab and change the opacity slider.

For the opacity in VRML, I don't know, but I think that should be the
case ? If not, you can simply fix the generated VRML.

Subject: [Paraview] Simple script severe slowdown in loop
Message-ID: <CAC91av=NkuNugMjmFau=AgWAh+c4XGcvOK=01tu1JUvOtB8UGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.  I'm a newbie to both ParaView and Python scripting.  I have a
large number of *.raw files that I wish to load, visualize and save via a
screenshot.  To do this, I used the start/stop trace feature to produce a
python script for one instance, edited the python script by adding a for
loop, then ran it with pvbatch.  The script produces the correct output,
but it takes progressively longer on each iteration.  To give you an idea,
I started a batch of 200 files yesterday afternoon -- the first one took 10
seconds, but right now it's only on 180!  I know that in Matlab, allocating
and re-allocating progressively larger memory chunks in a loop can cause
this behavior, but I don't see this happening here.  Below is my script --

Hi Andrew,

You're loading new data each loop, and never removing it.  For starters,
you could try adding a Delete call inside the loop after WriteImage:

  Delete(rho_180x180x180_frame0010_subs01_total_raw)

Hello Sebastien,

thank you very much, I just realized that I can change the color if I click on the solid button.  For the style options like opacity I tried it to but it does not work to save these parameters neither with vtk nor with vrml files.
Is there a trick how I can save them?
What further possibility exists to modify simple the vrml file for opacity?
 
Thx,
Chris

VTK format is not storing rendering information, but only data. In
VRML it is different. I believe it's a bug of the VRML exporter of VTK
(or it was not a feature of that exporter).

Therefore, the only solution that I see is to either fix the bug or
change the opacity attribute in the VRML file manually.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Simple script severe slowdown in loop

Hi all.  I'm a newbie to both ParaView and Python scripting.  I have a large number of *.raw files that I wish to load, visualize and save via a screenshot.  To do this, I used the start/stop trace feature to produce a python script for one instance, edited the python script by adding a for loop, then ran it with pvbatch.  The script produces the correct output, but it takes progressively longer on each iteration.  To give you an idea, I started a batch of 200 files yesterday afternoon -- the first one took 10 seconds, but right now it's only on 180!  I know that in Matlab, allocating and re-allocating progressively larger memory chunks in a loop can cause this behavior, but I don't see this happening here.  Below is my script -- I appreciate any help anyone can give.

for count in range(1,204):
  try: paraview.simple
  except: from paraview.simple import *

In ParaView GUI, each object in the Pipeline Browser is called a source
proxy.  The call to ImageReader() constructs a new source proxy, just like
using File --> Open in the gui.  There is something called the Proxy
Manager which keeps track of the source proxies, whether they are assigned
to python variable names or not.  Each time you load data, through the
ImageReader() call, you are creating a new source proxy that must be
explicitly removed from the Proxy Manager with a call to Delete().
Reassigning the variable will not delete the previous instance.

Oh, I see. How about if I change the ImageReader line:

If you open the VRML file that you generated you will see inside
something like that:

material Material {
   ambientIntensity 0
   diffuseColor 1 1 1
   specularColor 0 0 0
   shininess 0.0078125
   transparency 0
}

just replace "transparency 0" by "transparency 0.5"

Does that make sense to you now ?

Subject: [Paraview]  Problem with 1D plotting on pyramidal mesh
Message-ID: <201206131801.54645.archaerolog@mail.ru>

Hi!

I've noticed a bug in the last version of Paraview (3.14.1) on Debian testing amd64. Plot 
over line in pyramidal mesh doesn't show me the lines (I've checked versions 3.8 and 3.12 -- 
they're both worked as expected).

I created a bug #13238 with an example file. It's a simple pyramidal mesh in a flat 
quadratic region. Try to create a 1D plot over X-axis ({0.0,3.0}, 1.5, 0.0) and you will see 
the problem.

I don't think so, but you can use PyQt4:

import PyQt4.QtGui

filename = PyQt4.QtGui.QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(None, "Select a file...")
print filename

I want to add that, this won't replicate the ParaView file dialog
behavior in client - server mode (to open files from the server).

Subject: [Paraview] Getting camera/view data in c++ filter
Message-ID: <4FD8F117.40506@gatech.edu>

Hello,

I have been working on a c++ paraview filter and would like to modify 
output data based on the camera view direction/location. For example, I 
may want to highlight data closer to the viewer and remove far away 
data. Is it possible to access some of this information (like camera 
location, view direction, etc.) from a filter? I've seen some 
information on accessing this data in python, but I want to get it in a 
compiled c++ filter.

Thank you,
Alex

Message-ID: <1339659133.31507.YahooMailNeo@web110503.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi everybody,
??? I'm really new in ParaView. I have a question about utilisation of ParaView's plugin in ParaViewWeb:
- My plugin has been imported to ParaView and work with ParaView. I did a simple image threshold filter (1 input and 1 output,derived de SimpleToSimpleImageFilter) and it works as I imagined in ParaView, I succeeded in calling it in Python Shell as well (all the steps are respected, including .xml, CMakeLists, etc.)
- Now I want to use it in ParaView. I found in "simple.py" a command LoadPlugin, and I use this without any problem (no error in Chrome's error console, nothing abnormal in log at PWService/admin). But I don't have the right syntax to call this plugin.

=> So all I want to know is how to call my filter. name MyImageThreshod. Do you have any idea?
Thank you very much indeed.


PS: I tried 

paraview.LoadPlugin('path/to/myPlugin.so',false);
paraview.MyImageThreshold() => ParaView has no methode named MyImageThreshold
paraview.plugins.MyImageThreshold => always the same error.

Hi Alex,

there is two ways to achieve your goal.

Solution 1:
Inside the pw-config.properties file, instead of calling the PWServer
executable right away, you can call a shell script which will call
PWServer underneath with some extra arguments such as an
initialization python script (--batch-file=/.../loadPlugins.py).
Basically that script will load your plugin.
Once that's achieved, normally when the JavaScript ask for the
ParaView available methods, you should see your plugin. And have
access to everything on the JavaScript side. (You can read that part
in the wiki here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Manta_setting)

Solution 2:
Create a ParaViewWeb plugin, that will load the plugin and provide a
method to create an instance of your plugin filter. (like in
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Plugins). Maybe the
definition of your plugin won't properly be updated in the simple
context. Therefore, you might need to use the full filter path to
create it by calling
"severmanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.MyFilter()" instead of
just "simple.MyFilter()".

Alex,

What you are trying to do is beyond what a filter can be expected to
do in ParaView. What you'll need is a "representation" that uses the
filter internally to process the data right before it is rendered.
Look at vtkAMRVolumeRepresentation in git-master to see how this can
be done.

Message-ID: <35EA1452EB953F4DA0AC700A69BDB0425BBFE77559@NOANDC-MXU53.NOA.Alcoa.com>

Dear all,

        I am trying to manually create a VTK XML UnstructuredGrid that contains time varying data for each point. What would help me the most is an example file that contains this sort of information; it does not need to be in the UnstructuredGrid format. If someone could point me to such a file, that would be great!

The overall goal is to load this file into ParaView, and have each time step automatically recognized. It is not a problem to have multiple files (one for each time step), but I would very much prefer that the geometry is only saved once, due to its size.

Thanks for your help,
-Colan

Hi,
Unfortunately what I do in your case is what you prefer not to do: I write
a different file for each time step and then use a .pvd paraview file to
set the time step for the corresponding filename. This is easy. Then I load
the pvd into paraview and it associates the time step with each data on
each filename. I am not an expert in vtk file formats, so I do not know if
you can embed all those time dependent files into one. In case you want to
check the format for the pvd file, let me know and I can show you a simple
example.

Best regards / Cordialmente,

William-Fernando Oquendo

Today I tried Generate Ids filter.
When I applied it, Points' and Cells' IDs are generated,

Is it a bug?
Can I generate IDs not to overwrite original values?

I attempted to use my plugin with the master branch today and ran into

I found it confusing that none of the properties were displayed until I 
hit the advanced button. Is there a way to make all the properties show

also, properties that were hidden via the show="0" hint were displayed. 
Is there a change in XML to hide props?

Hi Jean-Noel,

Thank you very much for the assistance. I was able to retrieve the 
camera data and use it in my filter.

For everyone else here is the working block of code to get camera data 
directly.
pqView *view = 0;
pqActiveObjects* tempInstance = &( pqActiveObjects::instance() );
view = tempInstance->activeView();
vtkCamera* camera = vtkSMRenderViewProxy::SafeDownCast( 
view->getViewProxy() )->GetActiveCamera();

Message-ID: <CANZf-40eaqD70r5RPgEv38uUhwg5vSYs4kYzeq7wfC0m5YaK-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is there any way to animate streamlines natively in ParaView? I have been
"playing" with the software for a little while and see no apparent way of
doing this (i.e. trying particle tracer, etc.). Furthermore, I have
successfully done this by creating a filter which generates artificial
timesteps, but this solution does not seem to be a very good one. If there
is no way to do this natively in ParaView, are there options that ParaView
supports which could allow me to do this without artificial timestep
generation?

It may also be important to note that I am already working with temporal
data sets to begin with so I would need to isolate the current timestep for
any native solution (I already know how to do this in a custom filter if
needed) .

Regards,
Dennis McWherter

Burlen,

Incidentally just yesterday we were discussing that it won't be long
before we see an email on the mailing list asking "where are my filter
properties" :)? And to avoid that, we had decided to change the
default behavior to remain consistent with the past versions
(http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13241). It should be addressed
soon. A new attribute named "panel_visibility" controls whether the
property is shown in default or advanced panel (documentation to
follow as the implementation settles down).

Subject: [Paraview] VTK reader does not populate properties dialog?
Message-ID: <CAPDtsY2wXbUavcPDQSc9Zfzka46t4kp7tfH9+ym4yu-Zz6v4Sw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am having trouble reading a binary VTK file in Paraview. Here is a simple
VTK file (zipped paraview_test.vtk:
http://www.princeton.edu/~atchekho/paraview_test.zip , 29Kb) generated by
visit_writer plugin for VisIt. The file uses a curvilinear structured grid.
 The file opens and renders OK in VisIt.  However, when I open it in
ParaView, the grid shows fine but the properties box stays empty (see
screenshot at http://www.princeton.edu/~atchekho/properties_tab.jpg ,
83Kb), and I cannot visualize any variables.  I know the variables are
there because the Information tab does show the variable ("B") that is in
the file (see screenshot at
http://www.princeton.edu/~atchekho/information_tab.jpg , 115 Kb).  I tried
searching on the web and found that this can happen if a reader plugin does
not populate the properties (
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-April/021081.html). In this
case reader plugin is a standard VTK reader.  Is this a known bug?

Thank you,
Alexander

In the toolbar, you have to select "Surface" instead of "Outline", and
slightly on the left change "Solid Color" by your field name.

Hi Seb, thank you for the blazing fast response!  This allows me to see
slices through the variables on the grid, so the data is read-in correctly.


However, I am at a loss how to do a 3D volume rendering or a streamline
tracing of data on my structured grid.  In order to do that, as I
understand, I need to apply a filter "Table To Structured Grid", as
explained at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#Displaying_data_as_structured_grid.
However, this filter is grayed out (screenshot:
http://www.princeton.edu/~atchekho/grayed_out_filter.jpg ).

What should I do in order to do 3D volume rendering or tracing streamlines?

Thank you very much,
Alexander

The output type of this reader is a "curvilinear structured grid"
(vtkRectilinearGrid). ParaView will only volume render vtkImageData
(completely structured) and vtkUnstructuredGrid (completely
unstructured). So, convert what you have to an unstructured grid. A
simple way to do that is apply the threshold filter and make the
threshold include the entire range. Then volume rendering will be
available to use.

For streamlines, the help for StreamTracer under Input Restrictions
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_filters#Stream_Tracer),
says the input must be a vtkDataSet (which all of the above subclass)
so you are fine there. But it also says that the data set must
contains a point centered array with three components. You may need to
apply the cell to point filter to do that, or possibly use the
calculator filter to combine three independent point arrays into a
single vector array.

Since your data is a surface, you should use "Surface LIC" to show you
B filed on the surface itself. For that you will need to load the
Surface LIC plugin that is provided by default in the release
binaries.

Hi Seb -- thank you for the explanation.  I had 3D magnetic streamline 
tracing in mind, which I was able to achieve by applying a cell to point 
filter, as Dave suggested.  However, surface LIC looks very attractive, 
and I'll give it a try.  Thank you all so much!  Alexander

You can use a xdmf file to describe you data, and put all the files in  
a time series. It worked for me.

Message-ID: <CAKtPhBJ77XA6j=AbQApO56tPyF2JiJSpnGsSN5Z0ij0zpGrXrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am trying to clean an unstructured mesh with a python script and I
want to use the vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid() filter.
What I have now is something that looks like this,

ugrid = vtk.vtkUnstructuredGrid()
gridreader = vtk.vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader()
gridreader.SetFileName(filename)
gridreader.Update()
ugrid = self.gridreader.GetOutput()

but now I am stuck. How do I apply the filter? and also, where do I
find vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid()?? It doesn't seem to be in any of the
pv classes...
Thank you!

Using Paraview 3.14.1 64bit, I've been having issues with a shaky, 
jittery 3D view with tiny 45 point datasets. Any assistance?

What are the spatial dimensions of your data?

I'm pulling in 45 Lidar points from a CSV file,

Data Ranges:
X - 370381 - 370384
Y - 5.02889e+06 - 5.0289e+06
Z - 83.51-84.96

Using the Table to Points tool, I converted these and then upon that I 
did a 3D Delaunay Triangulation.

Let me know if there's anything else I can provide. All of this is on 
12.04 Ubuntu Linux.

I think Utkarsh is suggesting that you might be suffering from  
roundoff error. Maybe try recentering your points about (0,0,0) to see  
if the issue goes away.

Apologies, this is my first time using Paraview and I'm simply using it

Additionally, for viewing point clouds in ParaView, you will want to go to
the ParaView Settings -> Render View and uncheck "LOD Threshold" and set
the "Coincident Topology Resolution" combobox to "Do Nothing" and then
restart ParaView.

Hi, thank you very much for your reply. I'm sorry to reply so late, I was in my Holiday last week.
In deed, I use your advice and I succeeded in writing those .py file. However, there is a problem:

My SimleImageThreshold.py
from paraview.simple import *
import os
import threading

def loadSimpleThreshold():
? ?# Load Simple Image Threshold plugins
? ?LoadPlugin('.../vtkSimpleImageThreshold/bin/libSimpleImageThresholdSMPlugin.so',False)# client
? ?LoadPlugin('.../vtkSimpleImageThreshold/bin/libSimpleImageThresholdSMPlugin.so',True) # server

def SimpleImageThreshold():
? ?servermanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.SimpleImageThreshold()?

and, I used the JavaSript in PWConsole:

paraview.loadPlugins();
ST = paraview.plugins.SimpleImageThreshold;
ST.loadSimpleThreshold();
ST.SimpleImageThreshold();

When I saw the log file in PWService/admin, I had:
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<jsonrpc>", line 146, in handle_request File ".../workdir/plugins/SimpleImageThreshold.py", line 11, in SimpleImageThreshold servermanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.SimpleImageThreshold()
AttributeError: 'PVModule' object has no attribute 'SimpleImageThreshold'
So may be there is a problem with my XML Server Manager file? I doubt because I use SimpleImageThreshold() without any problem in Python Shell.

And, one more question. How can we define SimpleImageThreshold() in .py file so that they can act like a real filter? Take in an image, do his work, and we have an image thresholded as ouput?
Reason : when I called reader2 = ST.SimpleImageThreshold({proxy}); log file :?
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<jsonrpc>", line 144, in handle_request
TypeError: SimpleImageThreshold() takes no arguments (1 given)
You are my?savers !!! Thanks a lot.

Alex

Hi Alex,

there is two ways to achieve your goal.

Solution 1:
Inside the pw-config.properties file, instead of calling the PWServer
executable right away, you can call a shell script which will call
PWServer underneath with some extra arguments such as an
initialization python script (--batch-file=/.../loadPlugins.py).
Basically that script will load your plugin.
Once that's achieved, normally when the JavaScript ask for the
ParaView available methods, you should see your plugin. And have
access to everything on the JavaScript side. (You can read that part
in the wiki here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Manta_setting)

Solution 2:
Create a ParaViewWeb plugin, that will load the plugin and provide a
method to create an instance of your plugin filter. (like in
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Plugins). Maybe the
definition of your plugin won't properly be updated in the simple
context. Therefore, you might need to use the full filter path to
create it by calling
"severmanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.MyFilter()" instead of
just "simple.MyFilter()".

Hi Alex,

First of all, you should be able to remove those lines, they are not
needed in your case.

Then my question will be: Did you managed inside the Python shell of
ParaView to call manually the load plugin and to instantiate your
filter the way you are doing it in ParaViewWeb ?

to solve that issue you need to change your python plugin so the
method will look like that:

def SimpleImageThreshold(proxy):
    ....SimpleImageThreshold(proxy)

and in JavaScript that will be

ST.SimpleImageThreshold(proxy);

note that I've removed the {}.

Thank you Seb,
For your first question : Yes, I succeeded in using my SimpleImageThreshold in Python Shell.
Here is my script in Python Shell:

reader = OpenDataFile('/path/to/my/file.mhd');
GetDisplayProperties();
ColorAttributeType ='POINT_DATA';
SetDisplayProperties(Representation='Volume',ColorArrayName='MetaImage');
Render();

reader2=SimpleImageThreshold(reader);
SetDisplayProperties(Representation='Volume',ColorArrayName='ImageScalars');
Render();

For the second part :
I have the following errors when I tried in different ways:
var reader = paraview.OpenDataFile('path/to/my/file.mhd');
ST = paraview.plugins.SimpleImageThreshold;

ST.SimpleImageThreshold(proxy) :?
error : proxy not defined

ST.SimpleImageThreshold(reader)
error:Traceback (most recent call last): File "<jsonrpc>", line 146, in handle_request
TypeError: SimpleImageThreshold() takes exactly 1 argument (3 given)
ST.SimpleImageThreshold({proxy:reader});
Error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "<jsonrpc>", line 144, in handle_request File "/home/thtran/PV/workdir/plugins/SimpleImageThreshold.py", line 11, in SimpleImageThreshold servermanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.SimpleImageThreshold(proxy)
AttributeError: 'PVModule' object has no attribute 'SimpleImageThreshold'when I use : 
var reader2 = ST.SimpleImageThreshold(proxy);
var reader2 = ST.SimpleImageThreshold(reader);
var reader2 = ST.SimpleImageThreshold({proxy:reader});

Same errors as above.
I think that I have to be more precise in SimpleImageThreshold.py but I don't have any clue.
Thank you very much Seb


I followed your advice. Here is my SimpleImageThreshold.py to be sure :

from paraview.simple import *
import os
import threading

def SimpleImageThreshold(proxy):
? ?servermanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.SimpleImageThreshold(proxy)
? ?
def createSimpleThresholdView():
? ?global dp
? ?dp = GetDisplayProperties()
? ?dp.LookupTable = MakeBlueToRedLT(37.35,276)
? ?dp.ColorAttributeType = 'POINT_DATA'

Hi Alex,

sorry to say that but you did not properly read what I wrote...

I've ask you if the following line worked in ParaView python:

severmanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.SimpleImageThreshold()

Anyway, to solve the issue related to the number of arguments, you
should be able to do that:

var reader2 = ST.SimpleImageThreshold( [reader] );

And all that is assuming your initial issue where your proxy defined
inside your plugin is finally properly found. Which I still don't know
if it is the case or not.

Seb,
? ?I'm sorry, I don't really good in English so .....
? ?Well, about your question:?
severmanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.SimpleImageThreshold() is recognized in Python Shell.

? ?
? ? So, what do we have to write in SimpleImageThreshod.py?

? ?def SimpleImageThreshold(proxy)
? ? ?????.SimpleImageThreshold(proxy)

? ?What is your advice in replace these ????
? ?
? ?Thank you very much, Seb.

I bet you are running in an xterm after ssh'ing to another machine on Linux.  Try the following:  xclock.  If it doesn't work, that is the problem.  Solution?  Try ssh -X into the second computer, then try xclock.

Subject: [Paraview] injecting objects from python
Message-ID: <CAMGQJJWdTfbPFd44M9BUt5mKPcnnynU9xoJEMLQvyJP+mEwPRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am new to this list, and I fear that my question is of the kind that
comes back every once in a while - though I have not managed to find it. I
am hoping that somebody can give me a quick "yes, this is possible" or "no,
this is not possible" here.

I am currently using paraview for my visualizations by writing vtu files
from python and then loading them, which is a bit of a hassle - especially
when I just want to do some quick parameter fiddling. And it bothers me
(conceptually) that data has to make the slow travel from memory to disk
and back.

Ideally I would link to paraview and inject objects and widgets
directly. Additionally it would be great to update the model during
computations. However I cannot seem to figure out if (and then how) this is
possible. I have read the python
scripting<http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting> guide
and tried some examples there such as the cone, but it gives me a plain
window  without even mouse interaction (which I imagine can be added), not
the full featured paraview instance I had hoped for.

So my question is simply if it is possible to inject objects from python
into an already running or separately spawned paraview instance? If so, any
pointers in that direction (an example script?) would of course be
enormously helpful.

Thanks!

Gertjan van Zwieten

I use a programmable source.  Here's a macro to create an image:

#####################
script="""
image = self.GetImageDataOutput()
image.SetSpacing(0.01,0.01,0.01)
image.SetOrigin(0,0,0)
image.SetDimensions(101,101,101)
array = numpy.zeros((101,101,101,), dtype=numpy.float32)
space = numpy.linspace(0,1,101)
for i,x in enumerate(space):
	for j,y in enumerate(space):
		for k,z in enumerate(space):
			array[i,j,k] = (math.sin(4*x)
				+ math.sin(4*y) + math.sin(4*z))
image.GetPointData().AddArray(
	paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter.numpyTovtkDataArray(
		array.reshape(101*101*101), name="myarray"))
"""
script_request_information = """
from paraview import util

Subject: [Paraview] Not sure if I'm misunderstanding tetrahedralization
Message-ID: <4FE05E73.7080308@xplornet.com>

Hey again,

Using a bunch of points from a csv, I'm trying to generate an image 
that's like a Delaunay Triangulation but also includes the interior 
links, much like what I picture a tetrahedralization would look like.

Problem is, the tetrahedralization doesn't seem to work on plain points. 
Am I misunderstanding the use and application of this tool?

Hi Hal, thanks for your quick reply and the example code. That's very
helpful. I do have these remaining questions that perhaps you could help me
with:

   - In your experience, is a programmable source a suitable place to call
   a potentially long running finite element code?
   - Is it possible to update the data structure while it is already being
   displayed, that is, before the script finishes?
   - And is it possible to have a programmable source output multiple data
   sets if necessary?

Thanks again!
Gertjan

If it fails, you may be unable to cancel the operation.  I've had to 
kill ParaView when a script went into an infinite loop.

No that I know of.  If you have three "stages" to your algorithm you 
could create one programmable source and two programmable filters.  Then 
you could inspect intermediary data before moving on.

Not that I know of.  Would a multi-block dataset work?

Tetrahedralize reduces input cells to simplices. Voxels to tets, quads
to tris, points are already simplices so it won't change your point
cloud at all.

I think what you want instead is: Delauney 3D -> Extract Edges.

ParaView is single threaded so the GUI will be non-responsive while
the simulation runs unless you get very creative.

> Is it possible to update the data structure while it is already being
> displayed, that is, before the script finishes?

There is no support in ParaView for this. The primary reasons being
its single threaded nature and pull pipeline architecture. It can and
has been done before (with open source all things are possible given
time) but it took significant effort and was never done robustly
enough to make it into the official code repository. Search the
mailing list for livedata and coprocessing for discussions on this
topic.

Hal is right, the right thing to do is produce vtkMultiblockData.

You should also investigate ParaView's coprocessing library as an option.

The filter is in:
ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid.cxx

You might
1) access it from paraview's vtkpython making sure VTKExtensions is wrapped
2) copy the code into your copy of VTK and recompile to use it there.
3) get creative with your paths and access it somehow in a side by side install

I recommend approach #2.

Message-ID: <4FE07625.7070604@gmail.com>

Hi,

     I noticed that there is a *.particles format for VTK.

     However, looking through the VTK documentation, I have not found 
example code of how that format can be written out.

     I have pretty standard particle data with the following

     x y z vx vy vz temperature mass

     Could someone point me to the correct VTK class to use to create 
the appropriate files so that Paraview is able to load them.

Ok, it seems that the programmable source is not my ideal solution but it
may serve, I will try playing around with it. The coprocessing library
looks closer to what I had in mind, thanks for the suggestion! I will check
it out. If I make progress I will report back here on my experiences.

Hi,

I am trying to include VMTK lib into the ParaView but I have not success.
Anyone know what should I do? Or where should I begin?  I have included and
compiled the ITK 3.20 that is dependency for VMTK but still I have not
success with VMTK.

HI Alan, and Paraview developers,

It didn't help. 
I still have these two errors, And how can i fix them?

ERROR: In /build/buildd/paraview-3.10.1/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 404 vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x1bbd180): Could not find a decent visual

ERROR: In /build/buildd/paraview-3.10.1/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 631 vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x1bbd180): Cannot create GLX context.  Aborting.

Thanks,
Senay

I bet you are running in an xterm after ssh'ing to another machine on Linux.  Try the following:  xclock.  If it doesn't work, that is the problem.  Solution?  Try ssh -X into the second computer, then try xclock.

I don't think there is a vtk writer class for that format. Looking at
the code for vtkParticlesReader makes me think you can just fopen,
fwrite and fclose from a c program for example to create a binary
.particles file.

For ascii I'ld recommend using the standard csv reader instead of this one.

HI Alan and Paraview developers,

To clarify my issues clearly, I am not running Paraview from a remote computer, I am trying to run it from my laptop. And my issue is it crashes every time I try to open it. The Error messages are enclosed below. 

ERROR: In /build/buildd/paraview-3.10.1/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 404 vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x1bbd180): Could not find a decent visual

ERROR: In /build/buildd/paraview-3.10.1/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 631 vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x1bbd180): Cannot create GLX context.  Aborting.

PLEASE HELP
Thanks,
Senay

I bet you are running in an xterm after ssh'ing to another machine on Linux.  Try the following:  xclock.  If it doesn't work, that is the problem.  Solution?  Try ssh -X into the second computer, then try xclock.

The error tells me that ParaView thinks you are missing one of the gl
related runtime packages on your system.

What linux distribution are you using? What does glxinfo return on the
command line?

My wild guess is that you need libgl1-mesa-glx, but that is just a
guess t this point.

Subject: [Paraview] tweaking images from coprocessing views
Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A1A1344B3@CHIMBX1.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi,

I'm using ParaView 3.14.1 Coprocessing with OSMesa. I'm outputing views. Is there a way to set the image size? I always get 400x400 images. I tried setting Lock View Size Custom before exporting the coprocessor python script, but that doesn't seem to do anything.

Also, the color legend always has a white rectangle around it, as when you hover over it in the client gui. Is there a way to turn this off?

Thanks,
Mark

Hi All,

This error sounds familiar to me. It happened to me with the
combination of NVIDIA propietary drivers and the Fedora package
manager (yum in my case).
What happened is that after a package update the symlinks for the
opengl libraries were linked to the wrong files. So although I thought
I had the NVIDIA
proprietary drivers installed, I could not get a proper glx context.
Simply relinking solved my issue. I created a small script to relink
to the proper libraries
and ran it every time I did a "yum update".

Maybe this helps.

Kind regards,

Marco

Hi Mark,

What version of ParaView are you using? In 3.14.1 you can set the
magnification factor when outputting views but this is still an integer
number though so it may not be exactly what you're looking for. Working
with the repo head I'm not getting the white rectangle around the color
legend. With some more info I'll see if I can track down this issue.

Thank you DeMarle and Alan. I appreciate your help.

DeMarle. My linux distribution is Ubuntu 11.10. 

And glxinfo returned:

X Error of failed request:  BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  155 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  19 (X_GLXQueryServerString)
  Serial number of failed request:  12
  Current serial number in output stream:  12

Thanks,
Senay

The error tells me that ParaView thinks you are missing one of the gl
related runtime packages on your system.

What linux distribution are you using? What does glxinfo return on the
command line?

My wild guess is that you need libgl1-mesa-glx, but that is just a
guess t this point.

Hi Andy,

I'm using 3.14.1 server and 3.14.0 gui client. I've attached a saved screenshot from the client and the same timestep from the coprocessor. I've also attached the coprocessor python script. Should the viewport size be an attribute of the RenderView?

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

What version of ParaView are you using? In 3.14.1 you can set the magnification factor when outputting views but this is still an integer number though so it may not be exactly what you're looking for. Working with the repo head I'm not getting the white rectangle around the color legend. With some more info I'll see if I can track down this issue.

Hi,

Also, the color legend always has a white rectangle around it, as when you hover over it in the client gui. Is there a way to turn this off?

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I missed it before but with some help I found out that you can set the view
size in your script as "a2DRenderView1.ViewSize = [ x, y]" where x and y
are the number of pixels in those directions. Setting ViewSize is a bit
funky in that it works from pvpython and pvbatch but not for the GUI (where
it probably shouldn't anyways).

I was able to replicate the box around the color legend. If you change
Enabled=0 in the ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation1 constructor the box should
go away.

I'll check out fixing both of these issues -- thanks for pointing them out.
Unfortunately for now you'll either have to live with them or edit the
script files yourself though.

Andy

Subject: [Paraview] TimestepValues
Message-ID: <CAC6rsXrF=RCz6VEBjsWeBx7EnQLctDoipuH6mOKKzUyNyGs5vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I am trying to get the TimestepValues from the SLACDataReader to eventually
get the time range/temporal bounds of the data.  My code is below but
everything I have tried has given an empty array for TimestepValues.  Is
there something I need to do first before TimestepValues is updated?  Does
anyone have any suggestions for me on the best method to do this?

Thank you for your help in advance,
Justin

Message-ID: <BFD50C71074DC14BBC55425051B23E6220C9BB@sara-exch-2.ka.sara.nl>

Hi,

I'm doing remote rendering with PV 3.14.0, with quite a large set (isosurface of 98M tris) on 16 render nodes, each with a GTX460 and 12 GB RAM (Linux 64-bit cluster btw).

This model renders like a dog when interacting. I've checked the subsampling settings, compression settings and LOD settings to see make sure I'm actually using lower resolution rendering and model decimation during interaction. I have enabled LOD Threshold and set the value to 0 (to force LOD usage during interaction, per tooltip).

But I don't see any difference in the actual decimated model used during interactive rendering for different LOD Resolution values (checked using surface-with-edges repr and rendering without subsampling). I also don't see how the value for LOD resolution relates to the actual model used. I would expect something like quadric clustering to be used, but when e.g. setting LOD resolution to 10x10x10 the model during interaction uses many more triangles than "10 per direction" (or per data piece assigned per process, when showing Process Id Scalars).

I just don't see any difference between different LOD resolution settings. Am I missing a setting somewhere?

Regards,
Paul

Try to call

meshFine.UpdatePropertyInformation()

before asking the time informations.

meshFine.TimestepValues[0]

Same result, I see no difference in meshes used during interaction
between 10x10x10 and 160x160x160 for LOD Resolution. Just to make sure:

- LOD Threshold is checked, set to 0.00 MBytes
- Remote Render Threshold is checked, set to 0 MBytes

I actually get the same result when using the builtin server.

Hmm, maybe not a good test, as depending on the sphere resolution a the
quadric clustering will produce the same results for a range of
dimension settings (i.e. 10^3 and up)

Something's amiss. Attached are images of what I see when I interact
with a default sphere.

Hmmm, amiss at my end or in ParaView? The LOD and non-LOD views of your
sphere are the same it seems.

Does the LOD render use quadric clustering by the way?
And if so, should the LOD resolution setting produce the same mesh
during interactive rendering as when applying a Quadric Clustering
filter to the same input with the same resolution settings?

Look closely. They are not the same. Look the wireframing around the
centre of the sphere closely.

Ah, missed that. But my issue is not that the LOD-rendering mesh is the
same as the fullres one (it's not, as expected), but that the LOD
resolution setting does not seem to influence the LOD mesh in my case.
Especially for a very large mesh I would expect 10^3 versus 160^3 to
make a whopping difference.

In the file open dialog, simply select the files individually (by
opening by the "tree") and ParaView will open the files separately.
Since  you are creating your own custom applicaiton, look at
pqLoadDataReaction. You can create your own implementation for the
same that creates a separate reader for every file in the list no
matter how the user selected the files (as a group, or individually,
as I suggested).

Please submit this as a bug report to mantis. Off the top of my head,
I think this is so since the Query Selection extractor currently
doesn't support preserving topology. It shouldn;t be too had to add
support for the same (since the filter already relies on generating
mask arrays for extracting selections).

That doesn't sound like an intrusive change so I don't think anyone
would rest getting this patch merged in. Feel free to report a bug
with the necessary patch(es).

Hi Sebastien,

meshFine.UpdatePropertyInformation() does not seem to have any effect on
the TimestepValues.  Is there anything else I may need with it?

Thank you,

Are you sure you have some time dependent data ?

If it is really the case, you may need to enable something on your
reader so if does properly read the time informations. You can give a
try by using the "trace" mechanism in ParaView to see if any other
setting to the reader is happening when you load the data.

Hi Mark,

I missed it before but with some help I found out that you can set the view size in your script as "a2DRenderView1.ViewSize = [ x, y]" where x and y are the number of pixels in those directions. Setting ViewSize is a bit funky in that it works from pvpython and pvbatch but not for the GUI (where it probably shouldn't anyways).

I was able to replicate the box around the color legend. If you change Enabled=0 in the ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation1 constructor the box should go away.

I'll check out fixing both of these issues -- thanks for pointing them out. Unfortunately for now you'll either have to live with them or edit the script files yourself though.

I'm using 3.14.1 server and 3.14.0 gui client. I've attached a saved screenshot from the client and the same timestep from the coprocessor. I've also attached the coprocessor python script. Should the viewport size be an attribute of the RenderView?

Hi Mark,

What version of ParaView are you using? In 3.14.1 you can set the magnification factor when outputting views but this is still an integer number though so it may not be exactly what you're looking for. Working with the repo head I'm not getting the white rectangle around the color legend. With some more info I'll see if I can track down this issue.

Hi,

I'm using ParaView 3.14.1 Coprocessing with OSMesa. I'm outputing views. Is there a way to set the image size? I always get 400x400 images. I tried setting Lock View Size Custom before exporting the coprocessor python script, but that doesn't seem to do anything.

Also, the color legend always has a white rectangle around it, as when you hover over it in the client gui. Is there a way to turn this off?

Thanks,
Mark

Message-ID: <4FE2EAFC.6040401@sara.nl>

Hi Utkarsh,

I looked a bit into the code and the values used in
pqGlobalRenderViewOptions::applyChanges() seem to be okay, e.g.

void pqGlobalRenderViewOptions::applyChanges()
{
  ...

  if (this->Internal->enableLOD->isChecked())
    {
    printf("pqGlobalRenderViewOptions::applyChanges():
this->Internal->lodResolution->value() = %d\n",
this->Internal->lodResolution->value());
    settings->setValue("LODThreshold",
this->Internal->lodThreshold->value() / 10.0);
    printf("pqGlobalRenderViewOptions::applyChanges(): setting
LODResolution to %d\n", 160-this->Internal->lodResolution->value() + 10);
    settings->setValue("LODResolution",
160-this->Internal->lodResolution->value() + 10);

gives me output like

pqGlobalRenderViewOptions::applyChanges():
this->Internal->lodResolution->value() = 106
pqGlobalRenderViewOptions::applyChanges(): setting LODResolution to 64

But when I look at the applied settings in
vtkGeometryRepresentation::ProcessViewRequest(), after adding a printf()
like this:

void vtkPVRenderView::SetRequestLODRendering(bool enable)
{
  if (enable)
    {
    this->RequestInformation->Set(USE_LOD(), 1);
        printf("vtkPVRenderView::SetRequestLODRendering():
this->LODResolution = %g\n", this->LODResolution);
    this->RequestInformation->Set(LOD_RESOLUTION(), this->LODResolution);
    }
  else

this always outputs

vtkPVRenderView::SetRequestLODRendering(): this->LODResolution = 1

no matter what the slider is set to, leading to
vtkGeometryRepresentation::ProcessViewRequest() always setting the
decimator to 160^3:

...
// this is where we will look to see on what nodes are we going to
render and
    // render set that up.
    bool lod = this->SuppressLOD? false :
      (inInfo->Has(vtkPVRenderView::USE_LOD()) == 1);
    if (lod)
      {
      if (inInfo->Has(vtkPVRenderView::LOD_RESOLUTION()))
        {
        int division = static_cast<int>(150 *
          inInfo->Get(vtkPVRenderView::LOD_RESOLUTION())) + 10;
            printf("SETTING DECIMATOR TO %d^3 DIVISIONS\n", division);
        this->Decimator->SetNumberOfDivisions(division, division, division);
        }
...

Does this make any sense to you?

Regards,
Paul

PS: The other project we had contact on is on my todo-stack, hope to
pick it up again in the near future :-/

Paul,

Thanks for tracking this down. I think I know the problem. I remember
changing vtkPVRenderView to accept LOD resolution as a normalized
value between [0,1], clearly I forgot to update the GUI. I'll push a
fix a post a patch.

Ok, great. Actually just tried a few older PV versions, still seemed to
work in 3.8.1, but 3.10.1 is where the bug shows up. Does that sound
like the right timeline?

Paul,

Attached is the patch. It is possible to have been introduced around
3.10. I cannot remember when the  views were refactored 3.10 or 3.12,
but that would be the time when it would have stopped working.

Thanks for the patch. I applied it but get really strange results I
can't quite explain. I can see the correct values now appearing in
vtkGeometryRepresentation::ProcessViewRequest() and the correct division
value is set on the decimator (e.g. getting the X division value after
being set returns the correct number).

But I still don't see any change in the mesh used during interaction for
different resolution values. It's as though only the first value set is
used. Is there some kind of caching of the mesh going on?

Regards,
Paul

With git-master, I verified that changing the slider indeed changes
the LOD refinement for a Sphere (phi/theta resolutions = 800). Also
try running ParaView with "-dr" option just to avoid any anomolies due
to the settings (for me, however, it works fine even when -dr isn't
specified.)

I applied it to the 3.14.1 sources. Perhaps I should indeed switch to
the git version.

Is the 3.14 client compatible with the server code in git?

Argh, I see that git needs Qt 4.7.x :-/

Forcing delivery (whatever that means ;-)) in
vtkGeometryRepresentation::ProcessViewRequest() seems to solve it with
3.14.1:

    bool lod = this->SuppressLOD? false :
      (inInfo->Has(vtkPVRenderView::USE_LOD()) == 1);
    if (lod)
      {
      if (inInfo->Has(vtkPVRenderView::LOD_RESOLUTION()))
        {
        int division = static_cast<int>(150 *
          inInfo->Get(vtkPVRenderView::LOD_RESOLUTION())) + 10;
        this->Decimator->SetNumberOfDivisions(division, division, division);
          // ADDED PM
          outInfo->Set(vtkPVRenderView::NEEDS_DELIVERY(), 1);
        }
      this->LODDeliveryFilter->ProcessViewRequest(inInfo);

Ah ok.its a very bad thing to do, but it's no longer needed in
git-master so I'll not think too much about it :).

This can happen when the extents requested by the pipeline are not
satisfied by the filter. Compare with what the request information
method script says you can provide, with what is requested of and
actually provides by the request data script.

Looks to me like you need to make sure glx is installed and working on
your machine. How to do that depends on you graphics card and drivers.
Head to the linux forums for more detailed help. For example:

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with unstructured mixed finite element mesh?
Message-ID: <4FE4CCD5.9020103@bresnan.net>

The List,

I have come upon an eight-finite-element mixed element-type unstructured 
mesh that upon loading immediately crashes PV. (The error message is 
from Microsoft and the MS process gladly collects some form of datum 
dump and forwards it to Microsoft after which PV disappears from sight.) 
With or without the cell and point data the crash occurs.

PV: Version 3.14.1-64 (I have duplicated this behavior with 3.10.1-64 & 
3.14.0-64)

O/S: Windows XP Professional x64 SP2

Datum Format: EnSight Gold binary

Experience: Using PV almost daily since PV 3.4 on medium (700,000 FE's) 
to small (7 FE's) datum sets. I started VTK XML-formatted results files 
and graduated to EnSight Gold binary formatted results files.

The printed output from the simulation code shows that the execution 
completed and the numerical results are exactly what this test case was 
intended to produce.

This datum set contains four 8-node hexahedrons, two 6-node pentahedrons 
(aka triangular prisms or wedges), and two 7-polygon/8-vertex 
polyhedrons. The hexah-penta, hexah-polyh combinations routinely load 
and display.

The attached file set is a time=0.0 mesh used to check the mesh, BC 
node-sets, BC side-sets, et cetera. The ens_checker.32/64 executable 
programs I have are not compiles MS's Windows O/S. Can someone either 
point me to a place where I get a Windows versions of ens_checker.exe or 
let me know if these files pass?

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch view size
Message-ID: <4FE4D51B.2060805@gmail.com>

Hi all,

When I'm using pvbatch the rendering gets "clipped" (see attached 
images) when I set the view size to values greater than ~1024 in either 
direction. The display supports 2560x1600, and in interactive use I can 
produce the desired resolution.

What is different when using pvbatch? Any idea what I can do to get the 
same result in pvbatch that I get interactively? and I need to render on 
a single tile so setting the magnification when I call WriteImage 
doesn't work.

Thanks
Burlen

Subject: [Paraview] calculate distance between pair of meshes
Message-ID: <CAMKUQXiA8tLtHKSdLRqBhx6mc+RXvOQ-A7URE5P-UO2QJ3r9WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List Users,


I'm a fairly new addition to the paraview user community. I've experimented
with a few tools in paraview and I'm impressed. I have two meshes or rather
one mesh and a transformed version of the same. Is there any tool/utility
in paraview that would help me find the transformation between the two? By
transformation I mean translation along the X, Y and Z axis, rotation along
the 3 axis and the scaling factor? Or at least is there any method to
calculate the distances between pairs of corresponding points on the 2
meshes?


Thanks a lot

Lisa :)

Subject: [Paraview] MongoDB Reader
Message-ID: <491DCB85-DF55-42ED-BC09-1C4CAD4D9563@scottschenck.com>

Hi,
I'm very new to the list and paraview.  I'm curious if anyone has done any work to read data from a MongoDB database.  I'm not sure of the best way to get large amounts of simulation results out of MongoDB to visualize in Paraview.

Obviously, I could write it out to a cvs file and use a cvs reader.  Is there a more elegant way to accomplish this task without taking an intermediate step?  MongoDB is a nosql database that stores data in BSON/JSON data structures.  

I guess I could write a reader or plugin tailored expressly towards MongodB.  I was hoping to not have to develop something from the ground up.

Any ideas?
Thanks,
Scott

Lisa,

Take a look at this:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Calculator#Comparing_Multiple_Datasets

It shows how to compare scalar values between two datasets. You can
use this as a starting point to compare point locations too ( use
inputs[...].Points instead of inputs[..].PointData in the example).

Hi Lisa,

If you are OK to compile your own plugin in ParaView, you can try to 
include the ICP registration to the Filters menu. I did it and 
open-sourced it :
https://github.com/jeromevelut/vtkKinship.

Regarding the distance between points, a VTKJournal publication presents 
an implementaion of the Hausdorff distance between meshes and its 
ParaView plugin. Note that it is not a point-pair distance, as the input 
meshes are not expected to have the same topology.

If you prefer to use ParaView out of the box, then just follow Utkarsh's 
input!

HTH,
Jerome

Message-ID: <1340655939.61538.YahooMailNeo@web110508.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi everybody, 

?? Well, I found that using vtk Filter (Threshold, Clip, etc.) is simple within ParaViewWeb, we have a list of filters so that we can use the filters @ http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_filters
?? We can use "threshold = paraview.Threshold({Input:proxy,ThresholdRange:[300,600]})" to applicate a threshold between 300 and 600 for an image.
?? So, my question is : where can I find the python script .py which describes the way of using vtk Filters in ParaViewWeb?
?? 

?? If there isn't any file python script like that, how can we define a function that take in value as described above? How can we tell the ParaViewWeb to take in different type of variable?

?? I mean : def ImageThreshold(proxy,ThresholdRange......) or something like that?
? 

?? Thank you very much for your reply.
?? Good day everybody :)

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "Where is the python file
which describes the way of using vtk Filters in ParaViewWeb?"

The one that is imported by default is the pwsimple.py which is an
extension of the simple.py of regular ParaView.

But having said that, you can't easily mix VTK filter and ParaView
proxy together, unless you just want to do some data processing
without rendering.
But as I remember, you did a ParaView plugin for that, so normally,
once loaded you should be able to use it.

Did you try to load that plugin at startup with the extra argument of PWServer ?

Hi seb, thank you for your quick reply. 

I found that I can use vtk Filter like Threshold, Clip, etc. in ParaViewWeb by enter the arguments like I cited in my email. Likethreshold = paraview.Threshold({Input:proxy,ThresholdRange:[300,600]}).
So I think there are perhaps some files like pwsimple.py that describe how can ParaViewWeb can use a Plugin. I search for all the .py file in ParaView and I can't find something like that.
I did succeed in doing a ParaViewWeb plugin.
I used your advice to define something as following :
def SimpleImageThreshold(proxy)
???? servermanager.Activeconnection.Modules.filter.SimpleImageThreshold(proxy)

Now if I want my plugin to take ThresholdRange=[300,600] as input like the original Threshold of ParaView, is that possible?
If yes, how can we define this?
Thank you very much indeed

If you managed to load your plugin (the C++ ParaView one) at startup,
then you will be able to use your filter as any other filter in
ParaViewWeb without using any ParaViewWeb plugin. Otherwise, the
python file that you are missing is in fact an XML file that list the
properties for each filters and sources inside ParaView.

PARAVIEW_src/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/resources/filter.xml

The labels without space are used as filter name and properties for
creating and controlling those filters...

Otherwise inside your ParaViewWeb plugin, you can provide a dictionary
as argument and just loop through its entry and set them in python.

?? when I use threshold = paravie.Threshold(....) (origin threshold of ParaView) then it works. That why I think that we have to use some kind of descriptor?

I don't believe the plugin is properly loaded for PWServer... Did you
write the proper initialization script ?

I think that is the problem too (plugin is properly loaded for PWServer). But .... which initialization script are you talking about? XML or .py?

Is it at all possible to view the batch render windows on the
processes?  I am not sure, but maybe looking at the actual size/pos of
the windows can provide some clues. Theoretically, I don't see why
there should be any difference between pvbatch and pvserver (which I
assume is what you mean by "interactive use").

I've been trying to figure out if this is possible:

Take a mesh that Paraview displays nicely and display scalar values (color-coded) on this mesh. The scalar values are from a different file. This other file is voxel data (a set of statistics calculated on each part of the volume). The mesh was created from a version of this voxel data itself (actually, a binary version of the stat data file). Is there a way to get the mesh to take on scalar values from the nearest voxel?  If so, any ideas how?  I tried CellDataToPointData, but, even though the online help says: "Cell Data to Point Data filter operates on any type of data set", this is not true: the filter is grayed out, so I can't apply it to my data.  Any thoughts?

The problem here is that the data are calculated on voxel data, which are inherently unsmooth (unless the size of the voxels is tiny enough).  When I put the data on the smooth mesh with ResampleWithDataset, the unsmooth data gets placed on the smooth mesh, such that the image isn't accomplishing what I'd hoped.  Here is the result of data + smooth mesh:

Hi,


Thanks a lot for all your inputs. Thanks Utkarsh for the pointer. I tried
to use it but some how when I select both my meshes and then try to open
python calculator, it does not happen. The tab itself is inactive when I've
selected 2 inputs.

However the ICP registration gave me the desired answers. Thanks Jerome.

Warm Regards :)
Lisa

Subject: [Paraview] Base64 encoding in VTI files
Message-ID: <1340712961.16734.YahooMailClassic@web110405.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Dear List,

I am attempting to have a program I use write its own VTI files, in order to import image data into paraview more easily (we are usually using raw binary files!).

However, during the base64 encoding, some data sizes are rejected by the paraview reader.

As a small test case, the following file does not work.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
    <ImageData WholeExtent="0 0 0 0 0 0" Origin="0.5 0.5 0.5" Spacing="1 1 1">
        <Piece Extent="0 0 0 0 0 0">
            <PointData>
                <DataArray type="Float32" Name="scalars" format="binary" NumberOfComponents="1">AAAAAA==</DataArray>
            </PointData>
            <CellData>
            </CellData>
        </Piece>
    </ImageData>
</VTKFile>


Paraview complain that the data array is too short. However, there needs to be exactly one zero valued floating point entry there, which should be 4 bytes. The base64 encoded data is 6 A characters, followed by 2 significant byte markers - this totals to the first 4 'A's making 3 bytes, and the last 2 'A's making over 1 byte, but the markers indicating to only use 1 byte from the 2 'A's.

The completed dataset should thus be of the right size, unless I am missing something.

Trying to get paraview to do the same job (by saving a raw file) causes a different encoding to be emitted, where a sequence 1B and 10 'A's are emitted, with only one '=' significant byte marker 'BAAAAAAAAAA=' - this loads succesfully,

However, that sequence should decode to 8 bytes, which is too big - the file shouldn't load at all. Does anyone know what is going on? Why do I seem to need an extra byte? Why is there a nonzero value in the paraview version (sign bit negative?)?

To make matters more complicated, when I use large datasets of nonzero data, I only encounter this problem sometimes - so I was suspecting some form of alignment problem..

I'm unsure what paraview is doing here, and why - any advice or comments would be appreciated.


Thanks in advance!

Please read that:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Manta_setting

Then forget Manta and do your own "manta-init.py" file that will only
load your plugin... And that's it... (You can rename the file, just
make sure you keep the consistency.)

I suspect your data is already on the cells. The CellDataToPointData
will handle any 'type' of dataset, but is only applicable to datasets
that have Cell aligned arrays.

Take another look at the Information tab and see the attached images
from Sources[Wavelet]->Filters[PointDatatoCellData]->Filters[CellDatatoPointData]
for clarification.

Subject: [Paraview] Uniform rectilinear grid LOD
Message-ID: <CAC7tNYRUY=24dzK+rKx9FyEY0=N=8ABvV4L2qT9wkQCEf_mOYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm importing seismic files into paraview as .vti (Image file)  to display
them as a volume but I can't get a "nice" display (impossible to
distinguish a layer from one to another). It seems that every cell is
interpolated with all its neighbors and therefore it creates some sort of
"stains" much bigger than the original cell size. However, when I'm turning
the representation mode into surface, the display looks exactly as it
should: cells are not interpolated whit each other and therefore I can
distinguish my layers.

I'm not sure if I made myself clear enough so I enclosed two pictures.

This one represent the volume display where you can clearly see the problem

http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/266/volumedisplay.jpg/

this one is the surface display over the same area and you can see the
actual cell size

http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/189/surfacedisplay.jpg/


So I would like to know if someone have a hint about how to deactivate the
interpolation. As I started recently with paraview, it might be that my
problem comes from somewhere else but I'm pretty sure that my script to
convert seismic file to vtk is correct.

Thanks for reading
Cheers
Antoine

Thank Seb,
? ?I'm sorry if I forget one step. But I have always?Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Paraview> has no method 'ImageThresholdPFE'
I did as follow:

File ImageThreshold.py?
import paraview

paraview.simple.LoadPlugin('/home/.../vtkImageThreshold/bin/libImageThresholdSMPlugin.so',False)
paraview.simple.LoadPlugin('/home/.../vtkImageThreshold/bin/libImageThresholdSMPlugin.so',True)?

My JavaScript
$ p = paraview; var reader = p.OpenDataFile('/home/.../myfile.mhd');
$ p.loadPlugins();
$ threshold = p.ImageThresholdPFE({Input:reader, ThresholdRange:[1000,1150]});
$ threshold = p.ImageThreshold();
$ var threshold = p.ImageThresholdPFE({Input:reader, ThresholdRange:[1000,1150]});


All the 3 ways have the same error??Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Paraview> has no method 'ImageThreshold'


In fact, I used your advice with?

def ImageThreshold(proxy,a,b):
servermanager.ActiveConnection.Modules.filters.ImageThreshold(proxy,ThresholdRange=[a,b])

but each time I called
$ var threshold = p.ImageThreshold([reader],1000,1150);

?ParaViewWeb planted and I have to use kill - 9 to escape. Do you have any clue?

?Thank you very much Seb

Please read that:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Manta_setting

Then forget Manta and do your own "manta-init.py" file that will only
load your plugin... And that's it... (You can rename the file, just
make sure you keep the consistency.)

What I'm talking about is a "--batch-file" not a ParaViewWeb plugin.
But never mind, if you really want to use a ParaViewWeb plugin you are
stuck by the fact that your ParaView object in JavaScript will NEVER
have your custom filter definition available. Which is NORMAL, and
that's why you get those errors.

The only way you can overcome that issue is to work directly on the
sever side using ParaViewWeb plugins. Which is what you basically do
now...

But your JavaScript should look like that (based on what you did.)

p = paraview;
var reader = p.OpenDataFile('/home/.../myfile.mhd');
p.loadPlugins();
p.plugins.ImageThreshold.ImageThreshold(reader, 1000,1150);

/// Here is the explanation of how the call is made:
// => p.plugins.${python file name}.${method name in your python
file}( the arguments of your methods )

But once AGAIN, if you start PWServer with the --batch-file argument
and a script that LOAD the ParaView plugin, then you will be able to
do that:

p = paraview;
var reader = p.OpenDataFile('/home/.../myfile.mhd');
p.ImageThreshold({proxy: reader,ThresholdRange:[a,b]})

Here is an example on what that batch-file should look like:

## init.py
import paraview
paraview.simple.LoadPlugin('/home/.../vtkImageThreshold/bin/libImageThresholdSMPlugin.so',False)
paraview.simple.LoadPlugin('/home/.../vtkImageThreshold/bin/libImageThresholdSMPlugin.so',True)

unfortunately I'm running this on a vis cluster, I don't see the

and see if the issue remains...

Sorry I don't have any insight. The 1024 limit sounds very fishy. In
the end, it has to be something with X/OpenGL context or something
like that, but what is confusing is that it works with pvserver
(remote-rendering, right?).

O another thing, try turning off
"UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots" property on the view.

> view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0

That's one difference between the client-server and pvbatch workflows.

Subject: [Paraview] normals in programmable filter
Message-ID: <CAH3WR=K=5Aa6WsnQz=-PuBH0Nj022RPLfZwp3QiNFhwBe5cycg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to transform a surface using a programmable filter, and I am
unable to get the output to use the normals.  Even the most basic filter:

 output.PointData.append(inputs[0].PointData['Normals'], 'Normals')

results in the mesh being copied but the normals not being used.  The
normals appear as a Data Array, but are not used in rendering.  However,
using the copy arrays option in the properties of the programmable filter
lead to the normals being used correctly.

What I would like to do is to apply an affine transformation on the point
positions and normals (and visualize contours of a scalar field on a
uniform, nonorthogonal parallelepiped grid), so I can't just use the copy
arrays option.

Thanks in advance!
-Katie

Hi Katie,

I'm guessing you're looking at the arrays that are available to
pseudo-color with in the GUI. Those normals usually aren't in the filter
output data set. To see what arrays are available, look under the
information tab. To create those arrays for polydata (possibly using the
extract surface filter) and then use the generate surface normals filter.

Thanks Andy.  However, in the information tab, I see the data array called
"normals" after I apply the programmable filter.  The array is there (and
from the spreadsheet view I know that it is identical to the case where I
copy the array) but the resulting surface does not use the array!  Instead
of a smooth surface, I get a bumpy surface computed without normals.
Best,
-Katie

Use vtkDataSetAttributes::Get/SetNormals() to access the normals.
Likewise use Get/SetTCoords() to access the texture coordinates.

od = self.GetOutput()
id = self.GetInput()
od.GetPointData().ShallowCopy(id.GetPointData())
innorm = od.GetPointData().GetNormals()
onorm = innorm.NewInstance()
onorm.DeepCopy(innorm)
onorm.SetName("NewNormals")
for x in range(0, onorm.GetNumberOfTuples()):
  a,b,c = onorm.GetTuple(x)
  print a,b,c
  a = -1*a
  b = -1*b
  c = -1*c
  onorm.SetTuple3(x, a,b,c)
od.GetPointData().SetNormals(onorm)

	python)
Message-ID: <1340739554.2631.YahooMailNeo@web160506.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am currently compiling paraview 3.14.1 and using a locally installed version of python2.7. My version of cmake is 2.8.8. The OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux Client release 5.8. I get the following error during compilation:
[? 0%] Built target vtkWrapPythonInit
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/home/***/local/lib/libpython2.7.a', needed by `bin/vtkWrapPython'.? Stop.
make[1]: *** [VTK/Wrapping/CMakeFiles/vtkWrapPython.dir/all] Error 2
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
[? 0%] Built target vtkWrapHierarchy
[? 0%] Built target vtksys
[? 1%] Built target vtkzlib
make: *** [all] Error 2

With verbose one, it fails after this line:
make -f VTK/Wrapping/CMakeFiles/vtkWrapPython.dir/build.make VTK/Wrapping/CMakeFiles/vtkWrapPython.dir/build

In the build.make file, it has the following under vtkWrapPython_EXTERNAL_OBJECTS =
....
bin/vtkWrapPython: VTK/Wrapping/CMakeFiles/vtkWrapPython.dir/build.make

Any ideas?

No luck there. I have had it set to 0 all along, but setting to 1 
doesn't help. I initially suspected the xorg config, but xrandr command 
confirms that the display supports the higher resolutions. Yes, it works 
with pvserver remote rendering.

Message-ID: <CAFYzz27Kmwt7ku3FUtsNv7rqR5b7tbP8mUO0oeO9PWV-g_K77g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to record time information of a simulation into a .vts
file?  I would like the time of the simulation to be displayed on the
screen as I loop through my simulation.

I have done this by writing a .pvd file, but just wondered if this can be
recorded into a .vts file instead?  I will be grateful if some one could
give me a small example or point me towards some documentation.

Message-ID: <B6336023-9581-418F-9ABF-A99DA8A4ED23@mac.com>

Hi all,


I want to visualize velocity fields with Glyph filter.

We can apply scaling factor to Glyph filter.
I'd like to fix shaft radius and tip size, and scale only
shaft length with velocity magnitude.
But if I apply scaling factor, both length and radius are scaled.

Is there a way to do it?

There probably isn't a convenient way to do it.
I suspect though that you could do it with two glyph filters: one a
cylinder, the other a cone. You will have to get creative to make sure
the cones start where the cylinders end regardless of the cone's
scaling factor.

I am trying to write VTK XML (specifically UnstructuredGrid) files by hand. I've seen many different attributes for each XML tag, but I am unable to find a listing of available choices and what they mean. Is there some documentation out there that I am missing? I would prefer documentation for all of the VTK XML file types, but just UnstructuredGrid would still be immensely helpful.

Thanks!

I don't know of any documentation though it might exist for the XML schema.
You may want to look at PyEVTK (https://bitbucket.org/pauloh/pyevtk) though
as I've used that for structured grids (vtkImageData if I remember
correctly) and it worked. It is supposed to support unstructured grids as
well but I haven't tried that.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin StringVectorProperty Array - string length
	display issue
Message-ID: <4FEB3051.8060803@gatech.edu>

Hi all,

In a paraview plugin I am developing, I have a StringVectorProperty 
ArraySelection item in the GUI. The xml for this item is below. When the 
Get ArrayName function (GetFeatureFXArrayName) returns a char array of 
26 characters or fewer, the display is fine. However, when the name is 
27 chars or longer, it shows up blank in the selection window. Is there 
a way to increase the maximum name length (hopefully just an xml property).

Thank you,
Alex

Hi all,

I'm trying to display statistical values in color on a surface.  The stat values are in voxels, originally, but are translated from a NIFTI format file to a .vtk format.  I've got a binary version of the object (1's where the object is, 0's everywhere else). Through comments on this list, I've figured out that if I use the calculator to create a copy of the binary scalar values (and rename them as something else, e.g., "surface"), and then use Append Attributes to combine the stat data scalars with the surface scalars (from the binary image), I can then use Contour to make the surface (using the "surface" scalars) and then color this surface with the stat data scalars.  So far so good. 

Here is my problem: When I do Append Attributes, the stat data scalars all get changed to a range of 0 to 1, even though the stat data file that was used in Append Attributes claims to have values of: [0, 128.619].  So, what is going on?  Why is Append Attributes not appending attributes without changing their values??

Any ideas?

-Tom

Sorry - scratch that. The Append Attributes item DOES claim to have the right values.  According to the Information tab, there are 2 data arrays: One with scalars representing the stat data, and the other called "surface" which ranges from 0 to 1 and was created by the calculator step (see my last note).  However, when I make a Contour out of this item, telling it to use "surface" to do this, it does indeed make a surface, but it inexplicably changes the stat data scalars to a completely new range of [127.863, 128.063].  Note that the Append Attributes item claims to have this same array with [0, 128.619].  

Any ideas? As far as I can tell, Contour inexplicably changes the stat data scalar values to a new range.  ???  Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?

I've narrowed it down a bit further. It appears that Contour inexplicably rescales ALL the data arrays, even though only one is used to create the surface.  When I change the Isosurfaces data range (before applying the Contour) to different values (adding different values, adding ranges, etc.), this changes the range of the other data array after I "apply".  I don't want this other array touched.  I'm not sure why this would be the default so I'm suspecting a bug?? Perhaps I'm missing something?  

In any case, is there actually a way to have Contour create a surface from one data array, but not fuss with the other data array (so that when I have the surface colored with this other array, the data don't get completely changed from real data to something else)?

I think this is the proper behavior. The contour filter isn't scaling
values but only keeps the values for the geometry that gets
isosurfaced/contoured. For example, if the contour result was a point then
the array range would be the field values at that point. If this isn't
clear, I suggest using the calculator filter to create a point data array
based on coordinates. After you contour that you'll see that the range of
the calculator filter result is the same as the domain bounds. You could
also check the value of the array at each point to make sure it still
matches the local coordinate.

Thanks for trying to help, but I'm not sure I understand. Here is what I'm trying to do: color-code a surface based on statistical data that has been calculated for that surface. The problem is that the statistical analysis was done on a voxel-based dataset, not a surface dataset. Contour makes a surface from this data (though it isn't smooth, and clearly retains the boxy step-function appearance). However, I can't get the stat data - which is in exactly the same voxels as the data used for the surface creation by Contour - to display on that surface with the full range of values.  

The first and most important question: is there a way to do this in Paraview? I'm beginning to suspect not. 

Perhaps the issue has to do with the conversion from voxel data to vtk format.  The conversion is done with a utility called c3d from the ITKSNAP group.  The same conversion was done for both the binary data (voxels with 1's representing the surface, and voxels with 0's everywhere else) and the matching stat data file (voxel values represent stats calculated at the same voxels as have 1's in the binary data file, and has 0's everywhere else). Both of the corresponding vtk files appear to be "point data" (not exactly sure what this means) when read into Paraview. I'm assuming (?) that the both the binary data and the stat data occupy exactly the same "points" (not sure what else the conversion would do). 

Perhaps the issue is that Contour is creating a surface based on some exact value, which is an interpolation between 0 and 1 (in my case).  If the surface isn't exactly going through the same point that the stat data corresponds to, maybe Contour  interpolates the stat values to something between the value at that point and the surrounding 0's? If so, I don't understand why, if I tell Contour to use a value of 1 for the isosurface (which I'm assuming means that the surface will go exactly through the points that have the stat data), the stat data values get their range truncated. 

I seem to be misunderstanding what Contour is doing, but the central issue is: How do I get a surface made from the binary data file, and color it with a matching stat data file, given that we are starting with voxel data (that becomes point data when it gets into Paraview)?

For example, if the contour result was a point then the array range would be the field values at that point. If this isn't clear, I suggest using the calculator filter to create a point data array based on coordinates. After you contour that you'll see that the range of the calculator filter result is the same as the domain bounds. You could also check the value of the array at each point to make sure it still matches the local coordinate.

When I change the Isosurfaces data range (before applying the Contour) to different values (adding different values, adding ranges, etc.), this changes the range of the other data array after I "apply".  I don't want this other array touched.  I'm not sure why this would be the default so I'm suspecting a bug?? Perhaps I'm missing something?

According to the Information tab, there are 2 data arrays: One with scalars representing the stat data, and the other called "surface" which ranges from 0 to 1 and was created by the calculator step (see my last note).  However, when I make a Contour out of this item, telling it to use "surface" to do this, it does indeed make a surface, but it inexplicably changes the stat data scalars to a completely new range of [127.863, 128.063].  Note that the Append Attributes item claims to have this same array with [0, 128.619].

I've got a binary version of the object (1's where the object is, 0's everywhere else). Through comments on this list, I've figured out that if I use the calculator to create a copy of the binary scalar values (and rename them as something else, e.g., "surface"), and then use Append Attributes to combine the stat data scalars with the surface scalars (from the binary image), I can then use Contour to make the surface (using the "surface" scalars) and then color this surface with the stat data scalars.  So far so good.

Message-ID: <4AA494DB-9D06-495A-895F-67F60B6BBFD3@indiana.edu>

In the "Edit Color Map" section of the display, one of the options is to "Rescale Range". Hovering over it with the mouse it says: "Click this button to rescale the color map to a new range"  

Does this mean that, e.g., if my scalar values go from 2 to 10, and I use this "Rescale Range" option to have a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 9, does Paraview literally rescale the values, so that 2 now becomes 3, 10 now becomes 9, and all the intermediate values are similarly shifted?  Or does this mean that every value between 2 and 3 now gets colored the same as 3, and everything between 9 and 10 gets colored the same as 9?

In other words, are the scalar values being compressed, or just truncated, with respect to the colors?

Thanks for any clarification,

-Tom

It doesn't affect the scalars themselves, just the colors that are
assigned to them.

Say you use a red to green to blue color map, with red corresponding
to -10 and green corresonding to 0 and blue corresponding to 10.

Say you apply some filter or step to another timestep and your new
data values change from having a range of -10 to 10 to a new range of
9 to 10. All the data now looks blue.

If you click rescale to color range, the data that has a value of 9
will now look red instead and you will see all the colors along the
map.

Good, OK. So if I use "Rescale Range" and set every file to, say, -10 to 10 (regardless of the underlying scalar values they might have), then color differences between these various files would truly indicate differences between them for the underlying scalar values?

The rescale automatically behaviour is good for emphasizing relative
differences within a single image.

However it is bad for showing absolute values. In the example I gave
before, if you see the two images side by side, you naturally assume
that red areas in both pictures are similar when they are not. So if
you stick with the default, or better yet specify your own range, you
always know what each color means.

Message-ID: <929B90ACAA084941859EF3A45503EAD02851D0B8@EXMB01.srn.sandia.gov>

I am trying to use the "find data" utility on a linux machine, but no the query field is not populated with anything from my dataset.  I have opened my same data set using a windows distribution and the utility works as I would expect.  Does anyone know what might be causing this to happen?  Thank you.
