Hi Manav,

Currently there is no way to do this in parallel as VTK doesn't have the
concept of a hanging node. Thus when a cell looks to see if there is a
neighbor on its side it sees if any other cell's sides matches those same
points. If no other cell's sides has those same set of points then it
assumes that it's a boundary. Also, we can't do it by an "external"
technique as then we wouldn't pick up interior boundaries such as holes in
the domain.

To do what you want you'd need to break the cells that have a hanging node
in the middle of the cell's side into triangles or tets and get rid of the
hanging nodes.

I was more concerned with the fact that we don't have any dashboards
building the VisIt bridge. We talked about it and think it was due to
renaming the CMake variable for enabling the VisIt bridge. It should be
enabled shortly on some dashboard machine.

not currently, someone would have to add a filter for this. Adding a 
filter is too not a difficult a task.... ;-)

I suspect that you are trying to use the example dictionary generator 
that's built into PV. However, this generator doesn't provide a 
definition for hexahedral cells. Its primary purpose is to serve as an 
example of how one write a dictionary generator. it was never intended 
to be a comprehensive source of quadrature scheme definitions. The idea 
with the dictionary generators is that practitioners would provide them 
for their specific use cases. If my suspicion is incorrect, please give 
some more detail about the crash? and any output in the terminal?

I also want to warn about using ascii format for large models, because 
it's slow. The appended format is far better, although it may be 
slightly more challenging to write your data that way if you're not 
using vtk writers.

Glad you've had some success! The patches were merged over the weekend, 
so you could use the nightly binaries now.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.98.1: Problems with Space Navigator
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQsYZQDcGpq8xaw16tr8RPeP-1Aw+V2+W9002QfV2Uojew@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

I'm trying to make my Space Navigator working in ParaView v3.98.1 on my
Windows 8 machine. I built sources without problems (using VS2012, with qt
4.8.4, python 2.7.3, boost 1.53.0, OpenMPI 1.6.2, VRPN 07_30 - all rebuilt
in x64 mode) with turned on PARAVIEW_USE_VRPN and
PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_VRPlugin (+ flags for enabling shared libraries,
python, mpi, visit bridge, etc). But, I'm unable to make it working from Qt
client. Here are my running steps:

1. I start vrpn_server in background (with enabled line with my device).
When I test it with vrpn_print_devices, everything works OK - whenever I
touch my device, vrpn client prints some values,
2. I start ParaView's Qt client, load VR plugin, create Cone sourse, define
VR connection and Interactions and push Start button,
3. I click on Cone source or "built in:" node in Pipeline Browser and touch
my Space Navigator but nothing changes (except vrpn_server reports
connection is established). Actually, for some actions like pushing button
(on 3d mouse) I get several instances of following warning in Output Window:

"Generic Warning: In
..\..\..\..\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line
439

Call not supported for the current property type."

I get same behavior when I save options from my VR Panel to state file and
load it. Here is VR content from state file:

<VRConnectionManager>
    <VRPNConnection name="vrconnection" address="device0 at localhost">
      <Button id="0" name="MyRightButton"/>
      <Tracker id="0" name="MyTracker"/>
    </VRPNConnection>
  </VRConnectionManager>
  <VRInteractorStyles>
    <Style class="vtkVRGrabWorldStyle" proxy="2125" property="Visibility">
      <Button role="Reset world" name="vrconnection.MyRightButton"/>
      <Button role="Rotate world" name="vrconnection.MyRightButton"/>
      <Button role="Translate world" name="vrconnection.MyRightButton"/>
      <Tracker role="Tracker" name="vrconnection.MyTracker"/>
    </Style>
  </VRInteractorStyles>

I hope I made some small mistake:-). Can anyone suggest where could be the
problem?

Thanks,
Nenad.

Thanks.

The thing is I have a composite dataset, the commands above i guess work
only for "simple dataset"

So I found that these commands for for a composite dataset and they make a
copy of input.

*from paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter import numpyTovtkDataArray *

*
*
* *

*def flatten(input, output):*
* *

* # Copy the cells etc.*
* *

* output.ShallowCopy(input)*
* *

* newPoints = vtk.vtkPoints()*
* *

* numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()*
* *

* for i in range(0, numPoints):*
* *

* coord = input.GetPoint(i)*
* *

* x, y, z = coord[:3]*



Now after I have made these copy of the input from my composite dataset, I
can not print it to the output using the following:

*print mean(coord)*


and I get the following error :

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 26, in <module>

File "<string>", line 13, in RequestData

NameError: global name 'coord' is not defined




Does anybody know why I get this error and how I can fix it and so how I
can get the geometric center of a composite dataset ?



Thanks in advance for your help

It's a bit odd to map all of the actions to the same button. Does your
input device only have a single button? The GrabWorldStyle requires a
button press to rotate or translate the view, but that same button is
also resetting any modifications it makes (since "Reset world" is
mapped to MyRightButton along with translate/rotate). These should
each be set to unique buttons.

Try using other buttons for reset/translate/rotate world. You can add
"dummy" buttons to the VR config if needed, just set the button's "id"
number higher than your device supports.

Hope this helps,

Dave

Also,

This does not look right:

 <Style class="vtkVRGrabWorldStyle" proxy="2125" property="Visibility">

Can you try current master of ParaView and re-create the interactions
config? It should not allow you to select visibility with grab world style.

Subject: [Paraview] Slice with discrete colours does not work for 10 colors
Message-ID: <515ADD8B.6060307@deltares.nl>

Hi,

I'm trying to make a slice with 10 discrete colours to combine with 
contour lines (from contour filter). I figured out that I always need 
one extra value in the contour range to get the right number of lines - 
so far so good. But somehow the slice filter does not give me the right 
colour patches: using 10 or 12 discrete colours only changes the colour 
map, but the patches stay exactly the same. It seems that it is giving 
the patches corresponding to 16 discrete colours and hence, the 10 
contour lines (range with 11 values) will not match; I need 17 values.
It seems to me that this is a bug; does anyone know about this or am I 
missing something here? How can I get my contour-plot with (about) 10 
colour (16 is just a little too much). thanks in advance,

Sijbrand

Dear Dave, Aashish,

Thank you very much for your responses.

I'm sorry, I tried dummy buttons with both v3.98.1 and current master
ParaView sources, but they didn't help me. Also, I'm still able to select
visibility with grab world style from ParaView's UI (in master sources).
Btw, my 3d mouse has 2 buttons (
http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacenavigator.html). Here is one of
snippets from state file I tried:

<VRConnectionManager>
   <VRPNConnection name="vrconnection" address="device0 at localhost">
      <Button id="0" name="MyRightButton"/>
      <Button id="1" name="MyLeftButton"/>
      <Button id="2" name="MyDummyButton"/>

Do you have some other idea?

What happens when you press the right button and move the tracker?
Does the scene move at all, or are you still just seeing the error
messages in the log?

Dear Dave,

It doesn't happen anything, like I didn't touch my 3d mouse. Btw, here is
what is outputted on standard output when I execute 'vrpn_print_devices
device0 at localhost':

on left button pressed:

Button device0 at localhost, number 1 was just pressed
Button device0 at localhost, number 1 was just released

on right button pressed:

Button device0 at localhost, number 0 was just pressed
Button device0 at localhost, number 0 was just released

on touching tracker:

Analog device0 at localhost:

    0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 (6 chans)
    (several above lines with different values)

Thanks,
Nenad.

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C46X=mObziiYM+DPkzfgmWd+ZfpFruZMD4=c9C3fJsG5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a composite dataset. I want to access the arrays on one of the
blocks, then do some simple calculations and then write the output to in a
result array using a Python Programmable Filter.

I saw some samples on how to do this using Simple dataset, but does anybody
have any idea how to access arrays in a composite dataset?

Thanks

Hi Olaf,

I am having some difficulty reproducing this issue. It seems to scale fine
for me. I have some suggestions for improving workflow andperformance:

1. You can simply use pvbatch for this if you remove the Connect() command
from the script. I was running it as:

mpiexec -n 2 ~/Work/ParaView/git-3.14/build-osmesa/bin/pvbatch visualize.py
conc_4996800.vtr

This removes the need to setup a pvserver and a pvpython. It might also
improve performance in situations where ParaView delivers geometry to the
client (pvpython). This is unnecessary for batch use and pvbatch should
avoid it.

2. If you add the following to the end of your script (when running with
pvbatch), you can see a more detailed breakdown of timing information. This
will tell you how long each filter is taking on each process.

from paraview import servermanager as sm

session = sm.ActiveConnection.Session
timerInfo = sm.vtkPVTimerInformation()
timerInfo.SetLogThreshold(0)
session.GatherInformation(0x04, timerInfo, 0)

for i in range(timerInfo.GetNumberOfLogs()):
  print timerInfo.GetLog(i)

3. The way you are using the transform filter is significantly increasing
your compute time and memory usage by converting your rectilinear grid to a
structured grid (because rectilinear grids are always axis aligned). If you
really must transform your data, I suggest  transforming the output of the
contour filter. This was a huge time server when I was running this script.

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] Assign scalars/vectors to mesh points in
	vtkRectilinearGrid, C++
Message-ID: <CAP6xULGohdS4yKSWmeK-rjFMZqtva06ehfEvW_7bjQU+kv6o_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Using the C++ VTK library for writing an .vtr file, I'm able to create the
mesh, but not assign any skalars/vectors to the grid points. This is more
or less given in the example file RGrid.cxx.

But how do I assign values at the mesh-points?

Write the mesh:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <vtkRectilinearGrid.h>
#include <vtkXMLRectilinearGridWriter.h>
#include <vtkDoubleArray.h>
#include <vtkIntArray.h>
#include <vtkSmartPointer.h>

int main(){
  int nx = 3, ny = 3, nz = 3;

  // coordinates
  vtkDoubleArray *xCoords = vtkDoubleArray::New();
  for (int i=0; i<nx; i++) xCoords->InsertNextValue(i);
  vtkDoubleArray *yCoords = vtkDoubleArray::New();
  for (int i=0; i<ny; i++) yCoords->InsertNextValue(i);
  vtkDoubleArray *zCoords = vtkDoubleArray::New();
  for (int i=0; i<nz; i++) zCoords->InsertNextValue(i);

  // The coordinates are assigned to the rectilinear grid.
  vtkRectilinearGrid *rgrid = vtkRectilinearGrid::New();
  rgrid->SetDimensions(nx,ny,nz);
  rgrid->SetXCoordinates(xCoords);
  rgrid->SetYCoordinates(yCoords);
  rgrid->SetZCoordinates(zCoords);

  /* Write to file */
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLRectilinearGridWriter>
    writer = vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLRectilinearGridWriter>::New();
  writer->SetFileName("test.vtr");

#if VTK_MAJOR_VERSION <= 5
  writer->SetInput(rgrid);
#else
  writer->SetInputData(rgrid);
#endif
  writer->Write();

  /* clean up */
  xCoords->Delete();
  yCoords->Delete();
  zCoords->Delete();
  rgrid->Delete();

  printf("DONE printing\n");
}

For setting values at the mesh-points, I assumed something like:
    vtkIntArray* temperature = vtkIntArray::New();
    temperature->SetName("Temperature");
    temperature->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
    temperature->SetNumberOfTuples(nx*ny*nz);
    for(int i=0;i<mesh.nn;i++){
       temperature->SetValue(i,10); // set everything to 10
    }

   rgrid->GetPointData()->SetScalars(temperature);

But that doesn't work. As expected, when looking at
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRectilinearGrid.html

So how do I set values/vectors for all the points in the mesh.

Regards,
Paw

Thanks for the answer Joe,

but I still get a compilation error for

rgrid->GetPointData()->AddArray(temperature);

The error:
invalid use of incomplete type ?class vtkPointData?
In file included from /usr/include/vtk-5.8/vtkPointSet.h:29:0,
                 from /usr/include/vtk-5.8/vtkStructuredGrid.h:42,
                 from vtk.cpp:13:

Any ideas?

Paw

Hi, Paw,

I believe the problem is that you are mixing calls for scalars and vectors?

For scalars you want to use SetNumberOfValues()/SetValue():

    vtkIntArray* temperature = vtkIntArray::New();
    temperature->SetName("Temperature");
    temperature->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
    temperature->SetNumberOfValues(nx*ny*nz);
    for(int i=0;i<mesh.nn;i++){
       temperature->SetValue(i,10); // set everything to 10
    }
   rgrid->GetPointData()->AddArray(temperature);


For vectors you want to use SetNumberOfTuples()/SetTuple3() (assuming SetNumberOfComponents(3)):

    vtkFloatArray* velocity = vtkFloatArray::New();
    velocity->SetName("Velocity");
    velocity->SetNumberOfComponents(3);
    velocity->SetNumberOfTuples(nx*ny*nz);
    for(int i=0;i<mesh.nn;i++){
       velocity->SetTuple3(i,10, 10, 10); // set everything to 10
    }
   rgrid->GetPointData()->AddArray(velocity);


I also tend to use GetPointData()->AddArray() rather than SetScalars()/SetVectors(), which has caused me trouble if I have more than one scalar/vector.
I don't know if that is necessarily the best practice, but it has worked well for me.

Hope that helps,
joe.

You're missing the vtkPointData header file so you just need to add:
#include "vtkPointData.h"

Superb,
That was it. Thanks, both of you.

But I have another question.
The automatic scaling of the vector field works as expected.
The scaling of the temperature however does not(array of floats). It set
the range to [0 1], regardless of the actual values.

Paraview(under information) gives the data range = [3.5 1333.5], which is
correct. And if I manually set the color range to this, everything is good.
Pressing the automatic color scale(rescale to data), the used interval is
set back to [0 1].
Why is that?

I use to code suggested by Joe,
    vtkFloatArray* temperature = vtkFloatArray::New();
    temperature->SetName("Temperature");
    temperature->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
    temperature->SetNumberOfValues(mesh.nn);
    for(int i=0;i<mesh.nn;i++){
       temperature->SetValue(i,3.5);
    }
    rgrid->GetPointData()->AddArray(temperature);

And is it possible to update the plot if I overwrite the .vtr file, without
closing and reopening the file?

Paw

Ok, so the vrpn server is definitely working, and it sounds like the
"Call not supported for the current property type" error was from
trying to control the Visibility property, rather than the
ModelTransformMatrix. Double check that the VR plugin is listening
(i.e. the "Start" button is disabled and "Stop" is enabled). Also try
restarting paraview. The configuration looks fine to me, I'm not sure
why it isn't working for you.

Are any errors/warnings emitted during startup or while running ParaView?

Dave

Could you share your generated file? I'm not sure why the rescale to data
range is scaling it to the range [0,1]. Also, what version of ParaView are
you using?

Modifying the file won't cause ParaView to reread it as the reader will not
notice that the time stamp on the file has changed.

I am currently trying the Function itemtype approach. In all of the
examples for the function itemtype it assumes that arrays are all of the
same size. In my case I have three 1D arrays of different sizes: x(nx),
y(ny), and z(nz). The operation I need to do to convert to cylindrical
coordinates is:

do k=1,nz

I am currently trying the Function itemtype approach. In all of the
examples for the function itemtype it is assumed that arrays are all of the
same size. In my case I have three 1D arrays of different sizes: x(nx),
y(ny), and z(nz). The operation I need to do to convert to cylindrical
coordinates is:

do k=1,nz
do j=1,ny
do i=1,nx
  x(i)*sin(y(j)), x(i)*cos(y(j)), z(k)
enddo
enddo
enddo

I know that function has the operations SIN and COS but can the nested
looping be achieved with a function operation?

Thank you,

Nikos

Message-ID: <CALdMxnw7K2SqmPjdKUpP1fYmjz-U6bW-0L-5YtDf5C-FaE10Rw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am reading the following xmf file (attached as var3d.xmf) into Paraview:

<Xdmf Version="2.2">

</DataItem>
</Attribute>
</Grid>
</Domain>
</Xdmf>

The grid is a 3D orthogonal grid read in cartesian coordinates (see
attached image showing grid and contours of variable). I then want to
transform the grid from cartesian to cylindrical coordinates. I tried using
the following Python script:

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()

pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

newPoints = vtk.vtkPoints()

numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()

for i in range(0, numPoints):

coord = pdi.GetPoint(i)

x, y, z = coord[:3]

r = x * sin(y)

t = x * cos(y)

newPoints.InsertPoint(i, r, t, z)

pdo.SetPoints(newPoints)


with Output Data Set Type chosen to be the Same as Input, but I get this
error:


Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 26, in <module>
File "<string>", line 12, in RequestData
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'SetPoints'

I have no experience with Python scripting. What am I doing wrong?

Thank you,

Nikos

Dear Dave,

Thank you for your ideas. Unfortunately, there are no errors / warnings
emitted during startup or while running ParaView. Also, I tried several
times with restarting ParaView and always checked if listening is started
(i.e. Start button is disabled and Stop is enabled). I even turned off my
firewall, but nothing helped.

Btw, when I put some logging calls to pqVRStarter.cxx Ln 56 (beginning of
pqVREventPlayer::playEvent() routine), I didn't get any message (during my
trying to work with 3d mouse). Of course, pqVREventPlayer class definition
is enabled (because PARAVIEW_USE_VRPN is turned ON). Did I maybe need to
enable some special flag during compilation of Qt to get this event playing
working or this is used only during automated testing?

Thanks,
Nenad.

That was only for automated testing. If you want to debug this, try
putting some debugging messages in

vtkVRGrabWorldStyle.cxx: HandleTracker() and HandleButton()
pqVRPNConnection.cxx: newButtonValue() and new TrackerValue()

The first one is the style where the events from the vrpn are
translated into camera events, and the second file will check that the
events are coming in from VRPN correctly.

Did ParaView/VRPN work on this machine in the past? AFAIK no one else
has tried this on Windows 8 yet.

Subject: [Paraview] Breakthrough Curve over a slice
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6SNPrM=1+BxDSyeshAxY-P_nwPjhhtCCy+BWsTUP2hQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a dataset with one block containing cells. My pipeline looks like
this with the following filters

1.My Dataset
2. Extract Cells by Region
3. Extract Surface

(so by now I come up with my cross-section which is one cell width)

4. Integrate Variables
( Now I integrated the concentration value of each cell for a specific
material)

So by the end of filter number 4,  I just have a value which is the
integral of the concentration of that material in all the cells in the
cross-section. I want to plot this over time, but when i use the " Plot
Selection Over Time" It doesn?t show anything.

Question :I know that I don?t have a selection as I just have a value at
the end of number 4, but does anybody have any idea how I could show this
plot over time.


What I am trying to achieve is a "breakthrough curve" .

Please find below the definition of Breakthrough Curve:

*A plot of relative concentration of a given substance versus time where
relative concentration is defined as the ratio of the actual concentration
to the source concentration. *

Question: Also Could you please give me some idea on how to make a
cross-section with one- cell width?


I?m pretty newbie to this. I?d appreciate any help.

Thanks in Advance

One another possibility could be is that SN does not really offer tracker
and we are expecting tracker data so the code
somewhere is broke.

Can you create a new interactor style and just listen for buttons and
analogs?

Subject: [Paraview] Looping over cells of a composite dataset
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C4R2m=V-pO3VTgrtNBo6f0w5Nv1s9-wPx71Ek5ACvEunA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need to loop over cells in a composite dataset and then sum up values of
one of the arrays for the whole dataset.

I tried to write this in Python Programmable Filter

for block in inputs[0]:

print block

temp = block.PointData['Total_Cl- [m]']

result=sum(temp)

print(result)


but when I execute the script, I don?t get any results. Does anybody know
what?s going wrong?


Thanks

apply a CleanToGrid filter before  the python programmable filter and 
this is a corrected version of your script:

pdi = self.GetInput()

pdo = self.GetOutput()

newPoints = vtk.vtkPoints()

numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()

for i in range(0, numPoints):

coord = pdi.GetPoint(i)

x, y, z = coord[:3]

r = x * sin(y)

t = x * cos(y)

newPoints.InsertPoint(i, r, t, z)

pdo.SetPoints(newPoints)

Hi Felipe,

I applied the CleanToGrid Filter first and then applied the following
script:


pdi = self.GetInput()

pdo = self.GetOutput()

newPoints = vtk.vtkPoints()

numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()

for i in range(0, numPoints):

  coord = pdi.GetPoint(i)

  x, y, z = coord[:3]

  r = x * cos(y)

  t = x * sin(y)

  newPoints.InsertPoint(i, r, t, z)

pdo.SetPoints(newPoints)

Notice the indentation and also the change of the cos(y) and sin(y)
assignments.

but I got this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 26, in <module>

File "<string>", line 12, in RequestData

AttributeError: SetPoints


What am I doing wrong?

You must apply the programmablefilter to the cleantoGrid not to the 
var3d.xmf.

look at the screenshot.

I'm not able to reproduce this issue. It might be that your registry is
causing problems. Can you try running with the -dr option which disables
the registry (i.e. "forgets" any previous settings you may have saved in
ParaView)?

you need to copy the point data: add this line to the end of your script:

pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(0))


this will work only for one field, you can put this line inside a loop 
to add all the pointdata.

That did the trick. Thank you.

Deleted the registry file from ~/.config/Paraview, but I was not able to
find any entry saying something like 'Temperature=foo'.

So how do I edit the file from within Paraview?. Searching the wiki didn't
reveal anything.

It's not meant to be edited. I just delete it when I figure out that's the
problem but that is very rare.

Dear Dave, Aashish,

Thank you very much for your help!

I put logging calls to routines of above 2 classes (vtkVRGrabWorldStyle and
pqVRPNConnection) and I started catching messages on both places. Now,
looks like the problem is that current interaction styles don't like my
device (most likely because of reason Aashish mentioned). I'll dig into
these classes and try to fix them or create new interaction style. Then,
someone from the team will submit the patch.

Thanks again for your help!

Best regards,
Nenad.

Dear all,

In earlier versions there was "Apply Texture" in Display tab. I cannot see
this in 3.98.1. Where can I find it? Or is it changed to something else?

Thanks,
Hom Nath

Hi Seb,

I looked at this a bit closer and I see that when loading the state file the RequestInformation function is being executed for our plugins, but RequestData is not. Is this the expected behavior or is something wrong with our plugins?

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [Paraview] State files and plugins

When a state file is read, ParaView will create the proxy the same way as they used to be with the same set of values for their properties.
That's about it, nothing special regarding the RequestInformation and RequestData.

The only thing that could happen is if your plugin classes expect a certain ordering in property setting and so on, this may cause some issue, as we basically set the state in a 'random' order.

Hi,

I recently struggled with that too, and finally after some 
experimentation found out one way. Seems that the feature is now enabled 
by some filters. Best to illustrate by example:

Create a Sphere Source
Apply Texture Map To Sphere Filter
In the Properties Panel there is a Texture Field, select "load..." from 
its drop down.

That should get you a textured sphere, and hopefully you can bootstrap 
to your desired use case.

Unfortunately in my case data is large and I need to run in parallel and 
the texture was not applied correctly. Hopefully you have small data and 
run PV in serial if you need that feature.

<Xdmf Version="2.2">

</DataItem>
</Attribute>
</Grid>
</Domain>
</Xdmf>

The grid is declared as GridType Collection. When I read it in Paraview the
grid is read correctly as shown in the attached picture, however I don't
get the values for the attribute. I think the attribute is not read at all.
Is there sth wrong with this file? How should the attribute be specified
for GridType Collection?

Thank you,

Nikos

you must put the attributes inside each grid:

Hello,

 

we've just ordered an Oculus Rift device and can't wait to get our hands on
it. Until we can dive into this immersive experience we wonder whether OR is
supported by ParaView / VTK? Before we start to think about adopting
VTK-code pieces we would like to know if anybody else is preparing PV for
the HMD.

 

Cheers,

Stephan

Hi Stephan,

There is a CAVE module in PV but I'm not sure how good it should be for an
HMD. Long ago I had written PVJuggler module which enables PV for Immersive
environments using VRJuggler. VRJuggler can be configured for HMD. So it
should work but I havnt tested it on the RIft (still waiting for it to show
up at my door :) )

Hi Stephan,

The currently we assume that screens are fixed in space and therefore
supports, systems like caves, walls etc. I think it will be easy to
implement
(or update the code for HMD). If there is an interest we could support it
technically by providing you info on current implementation over emails.

Thanks,

It appears to me that the biggest issue in supporting the Oculus Rift 
would be that they use an optical distortion for the left and right eye 
(to achieve a bit of a fish eye type effect). Thus I don't think just 
displaying a left/right eye view (like one does now with Paraview on 
flat screen stereo displays) would be sufficient. It seems like you need 
to go through their API for the distortion...

Integrating their head tracking into Paraview might be a bit tricky as 
well...

Hi Felipe,

When I try this script to transform from cartesian to cylindrical
coordinates after I have applied the CleantoGrid Filter:

pdi = self.GetInput()
pdo = self.GetOutput()
newPoints = vtk.vtkPoints()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
for i in range(0, numPoints):
coord = pdi.GetPoint(i)
x, y, z = coord[:3]
r = x * cos(y)
t = x * sin(y)
newPoints.InsertPoint(i, r, t, z)
pdo.SetPoints(newPoints)
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(0))
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(1))
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(2))

it creates two more pipelines, one for CleantoGrid and one for Programmable
Filter. Both pipelines are linked to the original pipeline and both
pipelines require the same memory as the original pipeline. Is there a way
to to delete the previous two pipelines (original with cartesian
coordinates and cleantoGrid) so that I only use one memory amount and not
three?

Subject: [Paraview] Attribute for grid collection
In-Reply-To: <515D3264.6050701@ec-nantes.fr>

When I try to transform the "Collection" grid from cartesian coordinates to
cylindrical coordinates using the following script:

pdi = self.GetInput()
pdo = self.GetOutput()
newPoints = vtk.vtkPoints()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
for i in range(0, numPoints):
  coord = pdi.GetPoint(i)
  x, y, z = coord[:3]
  r = x * cos(y)
  t = x * sin(y)
  newPoints.InsertPoint(i, r, t, z)
pdo.SetPoints(newPoints)
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(0))
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(1))
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(2))

I get the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 26, in <module>
File "<string>", line 7, in RequestData
AttributeError: GetPoint

The script works well if the grid is not of GridType Collection.

Thank you,

Nikos

I just remembered this patch where Cory had rewritten the GrabWorld
style for the space navigator:

http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/8374/

Nenad: If you get a chance to try it, please let us know (better yet,
make an account on the review board and leave feedback there, if you
have time. Otherwise an email to the list will do).

Cory: I +1'd these patch, but they seem to have been forgotten. Are
you still interested in contributing them? Can you rebase them against
current master and see if they still work?

Dave

Subject: [Paraview] Oculus Rift
Message-ID: <000f01ce31c1$e4d84170$ae88c450$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

To consider the Oculus Tracker the head orientation should be applied to
vtkCameras view matrix. This should be straight forward. The lens distortion
is more challenging. The Oculus Rift SDK documentation says that lens
distortion is applied as a post-process. So we need a render target where
the scene is rendered to (with a bigger resolution) and then execute this
distortion correction which will pull out some pixels. 

Some questions come to my mind:
* Do we need a new PV renderer which applied this post-process here?
* Should the OR output delegate to pvrenderserver window? 
* Should it be integrated into ParaView or leave it as OculusRiftView
Plug-In?

Cheers,
Stephan

By "pipelines", I think you want to say "filters". I do not know how to 
delete intermediary results.
One way is to apply a filter and then save the result ("File"-> "Save 
Data"). So you can open it later without the deed to recreate the hole 
pipeline.

Subject: [Paraview] How to automate cell selection and stitching?
Message-ID: <515E8EEE.80901@torbjoern-klatt.de>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello ParaView Enthusiasts,

is there a way of automating (in the sense of creating a custom
filter, macro or Python script) the selection, extraction of that
selection and stitching of several selections into a single view?

In my scenario I'm carrying out a parameter study of a mathematical
model simulated on a relatively simple 2D geometry with (currently)
two functions on four areas. The geometry/grid is absolutely the same
for all simulation runs.
I.e. the first (view on YX-axis) 16x16 cells are area one; the next
8x16 cells are area 2; then follows 16x16 cells of area three and
finally 8x16 cells of area four.

However, I want to display the values of the first function (read
'data array') in the first and third area together with the values of
the second function in the second and fourth area in one single view.

My current workflow is as follows:
  1. mark and select the cells of the first area using "Select Cells On"
  2. apply Filter/Data Analysis/Extract Selection
  3. repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining three areas
  4. hide the whole (initial) grid and display only the four extracted
data sets
  5. for the first and third extracted area select function 1 for
colouring
  6. for the second and fourth extracted area select function 2 for
colouring

Now I want to do that for each result of my parameter study with
hundreds of independent runs and save the view after applying
aforementioned six steps to an image onto disk.

Is there a way of automating that? Either by creating a macro or
custom filter or via Python scripting. If so, how would that look like?
I haven't created any custom filters yet nor did I any Python
scripting for ParaView.

Cheers and thanks for any help in advance,
Torbj?rn

Message-ID: <515EA35B.3090205@lnm.mw.tum.de>

Hello,

I have compiled paraview from the git repo with MPI support on my Linux 
64-bit machine (openmpi 1.5.4). I can start Paraview with multiple 
processors, but when I try to open one of my result files I get the 
following error and Paraview is closed automatically:

ERROR: In 
/home/hammerl/programs_local/paraview_git/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, 
line 812
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x2090510): Could not receive tag. 188969

Attached is a file that can be used to reproduce the error.

I appreciate any help to solve the problem.

Cheers,

Georg

Subject: [Paraview] Integrate Variables Filter
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C4i9A1z7rjz94kyzG7xW6WS_caf1Xk-Yn6vxB0ZxkuwdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a question. I chose a sub-selection of my database by "Extract Cells
by Region" filter and I am using the integrate filter on it to integrate
the values of one of the arrays which is an attribute of each cell.

My problem is the integration of this value in my selection is giving a
much bigger number than I expect. If i just add the value of  each cells to
know the sum of values , i will get a much smaller number which is actually
the correct number i am expecting.

Does anybody know what the "integrate Variables" filter actually does and
why I am getting different numbers?

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAPWWRKOedd6HFqz=hHiJCS2u2sAc1SbDuj8F8Nw3m=-Pg23i_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     I am working with Paraviewweb; I did a new install yesterday using the
superbuild procedure. While most of the webapp examples work fine, I am
having trouble with PWApp. It keeps giving me the error " An error occured
during the loading: getcomponentrange". I have tried with multiple java
compilers etc, but I still keep getting this error. Any ideas on what might
be causing this ?
Another question I have is ideally I would like a webapp that takes a
filename as an argument from the web URL (For example ?filename=my.vtk),
and displays that file's view. Is there any example like that ? Thanks.



Regards
vipin

 Hello

where did the vtkProbeFilter go in 3.98? I cannot reproduce the example of the User Guide

http://paraview.org/Wiki/index.php?title=ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Programmable_Filter

I need to use a Programmable Filter with a vtkProbeFilter to do an azimuthal average, giving it a circle of points as Source.

TIA

Hi Andy,

I am wondering whether the Catalyst Users Guide is very close to be out and ready to download, perhaps in the next couple of days hopefully? Although the user guide would most likely answer my question below, I'd like to ask it now since I expect it will have quick answer which would clear up my doubts quickly. Specifically, I am not sure the relationship between Catalyst and the coprocessing libraries included with Paraview build/install. From what I read, the coprocessing library is called Catalyst in the new ParaView v3.98. I have downloaded catalyst source tree from http://catalyst.paraview.org/catalyst/resources/software.html and built it into a separate directory from Paraview as instructed.  However, when I built Paraview itself, I can enable coprocessing and all needed adaptors which will generate CoProcessing directory that includes adaptors and CoProcessors and seems it already includes coprocessing library without a separate Catalyst install. I am thinking if I only do in-situ visualization without live data source feed into paraview client for live monitoring, I might not need a separate catalyst install, is this right? As you instructed in this email thread on live data source, I can use Tools->Connect to Catalyst GUI menu to connect to live data source which definitely requires a sepate Catalyst install. I know I will have to input a port number to accept connections from catalyst, so I think I will have to run catalyst also separately from the catalyst installed directory such as pvserver in the bin directory under catalyst install which would feed live data source into the paraview client, right? If so, in this case, I am thinking I probably do not need to run another pvserver instance as Paraview server from the Paraview install directory that the client connects to, but rather to connect to the pvserver instance from Catalyst as live data source? I am hoping to frame my question with not too much confusion, and hoping to clear up the confusion in my head by some quick answer from you.

Again, looking forward to the Catalyst Users Guide to be out soon!

Thanks,

Hong

I'm working on a Catalyst Users Guide that should cover everything you need. It will probably be ready in a couple of weeks. I'll post to the paraview list when it's ready and where to download at.

Hi Andy,

Many thanks for the useful information. This confirms my suspicion on the live data source after I see information on catalyst, so I'll just go ahead to upgrade my development environment to the latest Paraview version 3.98.1 to be able to leverage catalyst co-processing library for my in-situ work. I have read up a lot of information on coprocessing in ParaView so far, so I think I'll just need to get a specific example running next for a good understanding of specifics, then I can get to specifics such as developing adaptors to interface with the simulation code. At that point, I might have more specific questions.

Thanks again,

Hong

Hi Hong,

The live data source that was done with ParaView 3.14 really was just a demo. It's evolved and has been improved for ParaView 3.98. Not it's in the Tools->Connect to Catalyst GUI menu.

Catalyst is indeed the evolution of what we called the co-processing tools in older versions of ParaView.

If you can give an example of what you're trying to do for in-situ work, I can probably point you in the proper direction.

Hello,

I built Paraview server version 3.14.1 on a HPC cluster with all co-processing-related flags turned on including enabling co-processing, all adaptors, and plugins, etc., and built Paraview client/server with no MPI on a local linux machine with co-processing enabled as well. Then I connect the Paraview client running on my local linux machine to the Paraview server running on the HPC cluster to visualize a phasta-generated mesh data on the HPC cluster. All works except that I don't find "Live data source" from paraview "Source" menu. I have not really tried coprocessing library yet, but it is in my next to-do list. In the meanwhile, I'd like to get some advice from this list regarding this missing "Live data source" from Paraview client GUI in case I missed something or did not do something correctly.

On a related question, from http://catalyst.paraview.org/ I don't see specific information on whether the coprocessing library in earlier version such as 3.14.1 is an earlier version of this catalyst. It appears to me this catalyst library only works for version 3.98 and can be built into paraview 3.98 by generating catalyst source tree and building it into paraview. For earlier paraview version 3.14.1, I cannot leverage this latest catalyst source since it only works with version 3.98, is this correct?

Thanks for any information and explanation. I am trying to get myself up to speed on in-situ visualization for large scale simulation, so any related information on in-situ visualization is very much appreciated!

Hong

I am NOT the expert here, but I believe that the Integrate Variables filter takes into account the volume of cells, area of triangles and lengths of lines...

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Integrate Variables Filter

Hi all,
I have a question. I chose a sub-selection of my database by "Extract Cells by Region" filter and I am using the integrate filter on it to integrate the values of one of the arrays which is an attribute of each cell.
My problem is the integration of this value in my selection is giving a much bigger number than I expect. If i just add the value of  each cells to know the sum of values , i will get a much smaller number which is actually the correct number i am expecting.
Does anybody know what the "integrate Variables" filter actually does and why I am getting different numbers?
Thanks

Georg,
You have copied the client side message.  All this is saying is that the server communication has failed.  It is the server side error messages that are of interest.

You may want to find and reply with the output of the server process.  I often do this by having the sbatch command include a -e and -o argument, thus writing errors to a file.

So I have done the following test. I have created a xmf file of a grid in
cylindrical coordinates "grid3d_cyl.xmf" specified as Topology Type 3DSMesh
and Geometry Type XYZ. That is a full 3D array is written:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf Version="2.2">
<Domain>
<Grid GridType="Uniform">
<Topology TopologyType="3DSMesh" Dimensions="    30    70    40"/>
<Geometry GeometryType="XYZ">
<DataItem Dimensions="84000 3" NumberType="Float" Precision="4"
Format="XML">
....
....
....
</DataItem>
</Geometry>
</Grid>
</Domain>
</Xdmf>

The grid is 30x70x40 and the file "grid3d_cyl.xmf" is 15.8 MB large. When I
read this into Paraview the information windows shows it uses 0.98MB of
memory.

I then create a grid in cartesian coordinates "grid3d_car" specified as
Topology Type 3DRectMesh and Geometry Type VXVYVZ. Here instead of the full
3D array I write thee 1D arrays, one for each coordinates. The file looks
like:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>

The gris is still 30x70x40 but the file "grid3d_car.xmf" is more compact,
it is only 2.2 KB in size. When I read it into Paraview the information
windows shows it uses only 0.003MB. So far so good, I end up saving space
both on the hard drive and in memory.

I then convert the cartesian grid to cylindrical coordinates using the
CleantoGrid Filter and also a programmable Filter:

pdi = self.GetInput()

pdo = self.GetOutput()

newPoints = vtk.vtkPoints()

numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()

for i in range(0, numPoints):

coord = pdi.GetPoint(i)

x, y, z = coord[:3]

r = x * cos(y)

t = x * sin(y)

newPoints.InsertPoint(i, r, t, z)

pdo.SetPoints(newPoints)


The information window in Paraview shows that The CleanToGrid Filter uses
7.2 MB and the ProgrammableFilter another 7.1MB so in total the cartesian
to cylindrical conversion uses 14.3 MB. That's a huge memory penalty.
Here's a summary:


File                     Size       Memory

grid3d_cyl.xmf   15.8MB    0.98MB
grid3d_car.xmf    2.2KB     0.003MB
CleanToGrid          -           7.2MB
Programmable       -           7.1MB

Since both grids contain the exact same coordinate information I would
expect the approach of converting the grid from cartesian to cylindrical to
not take more than 0.98MB of memory, instead it takes 14.3MB. Does it make
any sense? Am I doing sth wrong? Can I avoid the memory penalty?

Thank you,

Nikos

Hi Hong,

That Catalyst Users Guide is still a couple of weeks away.

To clear up your confusion in the meantime, Catalyst is really a stripped
down version of ParaView built with co-processing. The idea behind Catalyst
is that there's a lot of stuff in ParaView that isn't needed for in situ
analysis, especially depending on what the desired outputs are. So
Catalyst's role is to reduce the size of the libraries that a simulation
code needs to link to. For example, if you're not interested in generating
screenshots you would have a lot of overhead for all of the rendering parts
of ParaView and some GL implementation. Catalyst would allow you to not
include rendering components then. The live feed, Connect to Catalyst, will
work with either Catalyst or a full blown ParaView with co-processing
build. In order to connect your simulation to the ParaView GUI through the
live feed you should only need to run your simulation code linked with
ParaView/Catalyst and a generated Python script which sets things up for
live-viz.

Regards,
Andy

Goerg,

Alan is right that you need to look for server's output. Like Alan said 
it may be redirected to a file. But be aware that since this looks like 
a server crash you may or may not have any! If your build has debug 
symbols you could get a stack trace at the point of failure by enabling 
it on the server group in the memory inspector. You may also attach a 
debugger their and take a look at the state of the pvserver at the point 
of failure. Some more info about that is here 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Memory_Inspector

Hi Andy,

Many thanks for all the information that certainly clears up my confusion although I have a follow-up question to confirm with you on the last part regarding live feed. Let me split the question up into the following two scenarios:

(1)    No live feed, but only in-situ viz to write data and rendered image for each time step from the simulation code. In this scenario, I only need to set up the pipeline, add adaptor calls in the simulation code to do co-processing for each time step and output data for desired time steps, and build and run the simulation code that are linked with Paraview coprocessing or Catalyst. In this case, there is no need to run pvserver and paraview client, everything related to in-situ/coprocessing viz is integrated into the simulation code, is it right?

(2)    Need live feed and live viz while doing in-situ viz to monitor simulation in progress and possibly can influence simulation by changing some parameters through paraview client. In this case, I need to run paraview client and connect to the live visualization through Tools->Connect to Catalyst GUI menu, where I need to input a port number to connect to the Catalyst. I am not clear on this part. Do I need to run the simulation code linked with Paraview coprocessing/Catalyst, then run pvserver on some port somehow linked to the simulation code, which in turns can be connected back to the client? I cannot find any specific information on the process of doing live feed in an in-situ live viz scenario, so it'd be great help if you can point me to some resources or just briefly provide high-level info on how this works.

Looking forward to the Catalyst Users Guide coming out soon and thanks again for all the expert information!!!

Best regards,

Hong

Hi Andy,

I am wondering whether the Catalyst Users Guide is very close to be out and ready to download, perhaps in the next couple of days hopefully? Although the user guide would most likely answer my question below, I'd like to ask it now since I expect it will have quick answer which would clear up my doubts quickly. Specifically, I am not sure the relationship between Catalyst and the coprocessing libraries included with Paraview build/install. From what I read, the coprocessing library is called Catalyst in the new ParaView v3.98. I have downloaded catalyst source tree from http://catalyst.paraview.org/catalyst/resources/software.html and built it into a separate directory from Paraview as instructed.  However, when I built Paraview itself, I can enable coprocessing and all needed adaptors which will generate CoProcessing directory that includes adaptors and CoProcessors and seems it already includes coprocessing library without a separate Catalyst install. I am thinking if I only do in-situ visualization without live data source feed into paraview client for live monitoring, I might not need a separate catalyst install, is this right? As you instructed in this email thread on live data source, I can use Tools->Connect to Catalyst GUI menu to connect to live data source which definitely requires a sepate Catalyst install. I know I will have to input a port number to accept connections from catalyst, so I think I will have to run catalyst also separately from the catalyst installed directory such as pvserver in the bin directory under catalyst install which would feed live data source into the paraview client, right? If so, in this case, I am thinking I probably do not need to run another pvserver instance as Paraview server from the Paraview install directory that the client connects to, but rather to connect to the pvserver instance from Catalyst as live data source? I am hoping to frame my question with not too much confusion, and hoping to clear up the confusion in my head by some quick answer from you.

Again, looking forward to the Catalyst Users Guide to be out soon!

Hong

Hi Hong,

The live data source that was done with ParaView 3.14 really was just a demo. It's evolved and has been improved for ParaView 3.98. Not it's in the Tools->Connect to Catalyst GUI menu.

Catalyst is indeed the evolution of what we called the co-processing tools in older versions of ParaView.

If you can give an example of what you're trying to do for in-situ work, I can probably point you in the proper direction.

Then I connect the Paraview client running on my local linux machine to the Paraview server running on the HPC cluster to visualize a phasta-generated mesh data on the HPC cluster. All works except that I don't find "Live data source" from paraview "Source" menu. I have not really tried coprocessing library yet, but it is in my next to-do list. In the meanwhile, I'd like to get some advice from this list regarding this missing "Live data source" from Paraview client GUI in case I missed something or did not do something correctly.

On a related question, from http://catalyst.paraview.org/ I don't see specific information on whether the coprocessing library in earlier version such as 3.14.1 is an earlier version of this catalyst. It appears to me this catalyst library only works for version 3.98 and can be built into paraview 3.98 by generating catalyst source tree and building it into paraview. For earlier paraview version 3.14.1, I cannot leverage this latest catalyst source since it only works with version 3.98, is this correct?

Thanks for any information and explanation. I am trying to get myself up to speed on in-situ visualization for large scale simulation, so any related information on in-situ visualization is very much appreciated!

By the way, this datasets kills my build also.  I don't currently have a debug build, so don't know where it died.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Parallel paraview crashes when opening files

Hello,

I have compiled paraview from the git repo with MPI support on my Linux 64-bit machine (openmpi 1.5.4). I can start Paraview with multiple processors, but when I try to open one of my result files I get the following error and Paraview is closed automatically:

ERROR: In
/home/hammerl/programs_local/paraview_git/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx,
line 812
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x2090510): Could not receive tag. 188969

Attached is a file that can be used to reproduce the error.

I appreciate any help to solve the problem.

Cheers,

Georg

Hi Vipin,

the issue is related to paraview master itself. The week you fetch
ParaView/master was the week when ParaView was broken. Please update
ParaView and you should be good to go.

In fact, if you are using the latest ParaView, you should use the new
version of ParaViewWeb that is currently under development (reason why it
is not announced yet) but directly available within ParaView.

Just turn ON the ParaView documentation + WebDocumentation in CMake (you
will need jsduck),
and in the build tree, you will find a directory www that will contains the
javascript, css and documentation for ParaViewWeb as well as a set of
sample applications like the PWApp.

Then keep updating ParaView every gatekeeper review to get the latest
add-on for ParaViewWeb.

Seb

Exactly correct. At this point Catalyst just acts like any other library
linked in to your simulation code.

You are correct on the client for connecting to the simulation run. You
don't need to run pvserver for this. If when exporting the script you
specify that you want to connect live, it enables the simulation to connect
directly to the ParaView client.

Look in Google some presentations about vtk to understand how vtk handle 
the different types of datasets (Uniform Rectilinear Grids, Unstructured 
Grid...).
  Some filters in Paraview change the type of the dataset, this implies 
sometimes some memory penalty.

One way to see this phenomena is to create a Wavelet (Sources menu), 
look the information panel (type: Uniform Rectilinear Grid), type and 
memory.
And then apply a CleanToGrid to generate a Unstructured Grid (so we can 
move the points).

Subject: [Paraview] Python script timing question
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD2145099084710F8@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

I'd like to run some benchmarks with P different parameters in paraview and Python scripting (which I almost never use) seems like a good option.

Is it possible, to run an animation over N time steps and record the render time for each of the N frames and save that time to a CSV like file?
I usually use the timer log to get the last N still renders after running an animation and save that, but from Python, perhaps there is a nice way of scripting this?

Thanks for any help, examples very welcome if anyone has any.

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Plot selection over time
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C4-rMSSdHGgMCK1=NNgsA5k4fR8xagHDgwed47BV8hkCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a question. Is there anyway to draw the result of a filter over time.
I have a programmable filter which is giving back one number for each time
step and I like to draw this over time, but the plot selection over time
will not do this for me.

I know I can use Excel of course, but is there anyway to pass an array
which is the result of the  filter just before the "Plot Selection Over
Time" on data set to it and then draw this using paraview?

I mean having filters in order of following:

1.Dataset
3. Python Calculator
4.Plot Selection Over Time


Thanks

Subject: [Paraview]  Separating geometry and attributes info
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1WgtD4Z92V58bxLYWOS5KMNhbSbu-tz-YVdA_hrSqTi2Gw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
A friend of mine has a simulation which is represented as a set of points
on a grid with each point having several attributes. In  order to visualize
the system, at each time step she prints both the grid info and the
attributes at each point, in tecplot format (see attached files, if you
wish). The question is:
Is it possible to print the grid info only once (which is a constant info),
while printing the attributes at each time step, and then use paraview to
visualize that? Is like printing only the changing info. And each attribute
datafile at time t should refer to the datafile with the grid info.
We think this could be related more with the data format than with
paraview, but we are unsure, and we would like to know if you have any
suggestion with this. Maybe tecplot is/is not the best suited data format
for the task.
Thanks for your kind help!

See the paraview.benchmark python module.
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Batch_Processing serves as an
example.
The module is pretty old at this point and probably needs to be updated to
work with modern ParaView. If there is significant interest I could do so .

Dear Dave,

Thank you very much for the patch's link.

I've just tried it with v3.98.1 release sources and after I made very small
change in it, SpaceNavigator started working perfectly! Patch referenced
NeedsAnalog (vtkVRSpaceNavigatorGrabWorldStyle.cxx Ln 55) and AnalogName
properties (vtkVRSpaceNavigatorGrabWorldStyle.cxx Ln 71-78) which are not
available anymore directly. After I masked off these lines, everything
started working great.

I posted review to http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/8374/ too. I
haven't tested with current master repository sources, but I believe they
should work fine too (after above changes are applied), because there were
no larger changes as I saw.

Thanks,
Nenad.

Subject: [Paraview] ANNOUNCE: Call for Papers: LDAV
Message-ID: <CAE32kpVQz8VDYhCD32iLvQH9X=MZmDMNE0G_uUaDLHFDAuKwOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Check out the following call for papers. This is a great conference for
those working on large data and big data problems to publish.

Best,
-berk

IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization 2013 (LDAV
2013)
October 13-14, 2013
Atlanta, Georgia

http://www.ldav.org/

Contact: papers at ldav.org

Modern large-scale scientific simulations, sensor networks, and
experiments are generating enormous datasets, with some projects
approaching the multiple exabyte range in the near term. Managing and
analyzing large datasets in order to transform them into insight is
critical for a variety of disciplines including climate science,
nuclear physics, security, materials design, transportation, and urban
planning. This is currently referred to as the Big Data Challenge. The
tools and approaches needed to mine, analyze, and visualize data at
extreme scales can be fully realized only if we have end-to-end
solutions, which demands collective, interdisciplinary efforts.

The Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) symposium, to
be held in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2013, is specifically targeting
possible end-to-end solutions. The LDAV symposium will bring together
domain scientists, data analysts, visualization researchers, users,
designers and artists, to foster common ground for solving both near-
and long-term problems.

Scope:
We are looking for original research contributions on a broad-range of
topics related to the collection, analysis, manipulation or
visualization of large-scale data. We also welcome position papers on
these topics.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Innovative approaches combining information visualization, visual
 analytics, and scientific visualization
- Streaming methods for analysis, collection and visualization
- Novel, extreme or innovative methods for understanding and
 interacting with data
- Data mining and machine learning techniques for large data analysis
- Advanced hardware and system architectures for data handling,
 analysis or visualization
- Hierarchical data storage, retrieval or rendering
- Distributed, parallel or multi-threaded approaches
- MapReduce-based and Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches
- Data collection, management and curation
- Collaboration or co-design of data analysis with domain scientists
- Application case studies
- Topics in cognitive issues specific to manipulating and
 understanding large data
- Industry solutions for Big Data analytics and infrastructure

Submission Instructions:
Submitted manuscripts may not exceed maximum of eight (8) pages in
length, with an optional ninth page that can only contain
references. The length of the paper should be proportional to the
contributions it makes. We welcome short papers of 4 or 6 pages in
length. The manuscripts should be formatted according to guidelines
available on the IEEE VIS 2013 site.

Submission Site:
Go to the submission site (https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc) log
in, and select 'Submit to LDAV 2013 Papers'.

Important Dates :
Paper Registration including Abstract: May 8, 2013 (required), 11:59 PM PST
Paper Submission: May 15, 2013 (firm), 11:59 PM PST
Author Notification: July 31, 2013

Thanks,

The page you sent me to was quite helpful, I also came across this page, which was very useful for generating scripts for multiple parameters a job submissions
http://www.umbc.edu/hpcf/resources-tara-2010/generating-batch-scripts.html

I used info from both those pages and got my stuff working. Thanks.

What I ended up doing was essentially this
for num in range(0, 30):
  start =  time()
  Render()
  finish = time()
  timestring = "Render %08f\n" % (finish-start)
  print timestring

but what I really wanted to do was call
AnimationScene1.Play()

And get the render time from the timerlog for each frame. The difference being that using the animation scene object I can setup more complex motions and changes and I'd like to time what happens in there.

For now my simple timer is fine, but at some point I'll revisit the animation version.

JB

See the paraview.benchmark python module.
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Batch_Processing serves as an example.
The module is pretty old at this point and probably needs to be updated to work with modern ParaView. If there is significant interest I could do so .

I'd like to run some benchmarks with P different parameters in paraview and Python scripting (which I almost never use) seems like a good option.

Is it possible, to run an animation over N time steps and record the render time for each of the N frames and save that time to a CSV like file?
I usually use the timer log to get the last N still renders after running an animation and save that, but from Python, perhaps there is a nice way of scripting this?

Thanks for any help, examples very welcome if anyone has any.

The paraview.benchmarks module should help in either case. What it does is
grab all processes' vtktimerlogs, which contain in text form the time taken
by every filter and rendering element in the pipeline, and saves/restores
them to analyze at your leisure. That part at least should still be working
fine.

Additionally it has code to parse those text logs and give you reports
about how long each filter and rendering element took for each frame and
also how long each filter took across all frames. That part is what I
suspect doesn't work now because the rendering code changed in 3.10 such
that the heuristics I used to parse the text logs are probably not valid
anymore.

So, regardless of how you set up the benchmarks (animation or not),
paraview.benchmarks may give you fine details that show you what is really
going on.

Subject: [Paraview] Material Interface Filter
Message-ID: <CD89935E.F96A%bak@lanl.gov>

So I'm trying to use the Material Interface Filter:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_filters#Material_Interface_Filter

and have carefully created XML datafiles using vtkNonOverlappingAMR (*.vth) format.  Unfortunately the v3.98.1 gui does not furnish the Properties option 'Down Convert Volume Fractions' when reading in the datafiles in *.vth format.   (In fact the Properties menu has only the 'Default Number of Levels' slider, and no cell data selector, and no 'Down Convert..' selector.)  Consequently the Material Interface Filter has an empty choice for 'Select Material Fraction Arrays', and so the filter does not know what to do.  Alas, the only format that seems to generate the 'Down Convert..' option is *.spct, which, of course, we do not have in this case.

Is there another filter that I need to run prior to doing 'Material Interface Filter', or am I just plain out of luck here?

Thanks for your very capable help.

Subject: [Paraview] Connect to Catalyst live feed
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514B1FD01B@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

Hi Andy,

Many thanks for your very helpful responses. Now I think I have a good understanding on the ParaView in-situ viz process. I have also cleared up the email thread history a bit and changed the subject to reflect my new question below.

I have got an in-situ example running without live feed which is linked to Paraview CoProcessing library. Now I am trying to get the live feed with this in-situ viz example working. I think I am very close now, but got stuck on getting ParaView client connect successfully to the in-situ simulation run. Specifically, from Tools->Connect to Catalyst dialog, I am only allowed to enter the port number to accept connections from Catalyst. Since I am running the in-situ viz on a remote server which I ssh to via ssh port forwarding/tunneling, I thought it would work to connect to this specified port (22222) with localhost as set up in the python pipeline for the in-situ viz. However, on the Paraview client, I see the message "Accepting connection(s): myLocalMachineHostName:22222" rather than "Accepting connection(s): localhost:22222." and no connection is being made from the coprocessing code running on the server to the local Paraview client. If I run pvserver on the same remote server, and then have Paraview client connect to localhost on the port 11111 which is used for ssh tunneling for the remote server, the connection can be established successfully. Could you give me some suggestion/advice on what I did wrong for connecting to Catalyst? Also, I am thinking there should be a way to allow me to specify host name when connecting to Catalyst, but I cannot find it - it currently only allows me to specify a port number from the Connect to Catalyst GUI. Any information and suggestions regarding this is very much appreciated!

Thanks again,

Hong

Hi Andy,

Many thanks for all the information that certainly clears up my confusion although I have a follow-up question to confirm with you on the last part regarding live feed. Let me split the question up into the following two scenarios:

(1)    No live feed, but only in-situ viz to write data and rendered image for each time step from the simulation code. In this scenario, I only need to set up the pipeline, add adaptor calls in the simulation code to do co-processing for each time step and output data for desired time steps, and build and run the simulation code that are linked with Paraview coprocessing or Catalyst. In this case, there is no need to run pvserver and paraview client, everything related to in-situ/coprocessing viz is integrated into the simulation code, is it right?

Exactly correct. At this point Catalyst just acts like any other library linked in to your simulation code.


(2)    Need live feed and live viz while doing in-situ viz to monitor simulation in progress and possibly can influence simulation by changing some parameters through paraview client. In this case, I need to run paraview client and connect to the live visualization through Tools->Connect to Catalyst GUI menu, where I need to input a port number to connect to the Catalyst. I am not clear on this part. Do I need to run the simulation code linked with Paraview coprocessing/Catalyst, then run pvserver on some port somehow linked to the simulation code, which in turns can be connected back to the client? I cannot find any specific information on the process of doing live feed in an in-situ live viz scenario, so it'd be great help if you can point me to some resources or just briefly provide high-level info on how this works.

You are correct on the client for connecting to the simulation run. You don't need to run pvserver for this. If when exporting the script you  specify that you want to connect live, it enables the simulation to connect directly to the ParaView client.

Looking forward to the Catalyst Users Guide coming out soon and thanks again for all the expert information!!!

Best regards,

Hong

Bucky,
I believe that the problem is that - as you suggest below - the material interface filter only accepts down converted unsigned chars.  In my mind, this is a bug/feature hole.  Either, 1) the Material Interface Filter should accept down converted unsigned chars or default variables, 2) a filter should be created to convert to unsigned chars (with appropriate scaling), or 3) any appropriate reader should allow down convert .  Further, the Material Interface Filter has been hard coded to look for certain variable names (that it knows are down converted).  These are named "Material volume fraction - #" where #  is 1, 2, 3, 4, etc or "Volume Fraction - #" where # is 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.


Berk - does this sound right to you?  I can think of one simple, short term option - I wonder if it is possible to write some simple python that would do the magic in a programmable filter?  Also, if you like, I can write up a bug/feature request.

Alan

Hello, dear friends.

I have a problem.

I have the channel Python-PVSERVER-ParaView.

When i create the ProgrammableSource or one of another sources (From python) and
try to Show(), i receive message:

Selected proxy value not in the list: Arrow

How to solve this problem?

part of my programm:

prsource =
servermanager.sources.ProgrammableSource(OutputDataSetType='vtkStructuredGrid',registrationGroup="sources",registrationName="ProgrammableSource")
proxymanager=servermanager.ProxyManager()
proxymanager.RegisterProxy("Arrow", "ProgrammableSource1", prsource)
prsource.Script='...some text'
repPRsource=servermanager.CreateRepresentation(prsource,view,registrationGroup='representations')

Subject: [Paraview] Cache Geometry and the Information tab
Message-ID: <28C79CB4-E4D7-4D36-8E47-9A4300349096@anl.gov>

Hi,

I have noticed some inconsistent behavior on the Information tab (using ParaView 3.98) when Cache Geometry is turned on.  The values in the Data Arrays section does not always get updated.  In the attached image the Time and index shown in the animation bar at the top correctly reflect the time step of the data being shown.  While the Current data time and Data Ranges in the Data Arrays section on the Information tab do not match.  If I play the animation the information tab is usually updated correctly, although I have seen it not update periodically.  After each time step has been loaded/displayed, and hence cached, jumping to the beginning or end, or stepping forward or backward usually results in the Information tab not getting updated.

If Cache Geometry is turned off the information tab always gets updated correctly, as far as I can tell.

Thanks,
joe.

In that case, you're better of using the simplified Python API. Refer
to http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Your script can be written simply as:

from paraview import simple
prsource = simple.ProgrammableSource(OutputDataSetType='vtkStructuredGrid')
prsource.Script = "..."
repPRsource = simple.Show()
simple.Render()

In your script, I am not sure what you're trying to do with the
following lines. I believe you should be able to take them out.

proxymanager=servermanager.ProxyManager()
proxymanager.RegisterProxy("Arrow", "ProgrammableSource1", prsource)

Dear ParaView Friends:

I'm trying to build the ParaView GUI with no success (unix OS).  The make fails in pqComponents with a message (copied below with system info, and ccmake command):

'No rule to make target `Qt/Components/../../../../../usr/projects/pv_dev/ParaView-3.98.1-git/Qt/Components/Resources/XML/Placeholder.xml'

which has me miffed because the file Placeholder.xml is present at that location.  I have tried both 3.98.0 and 3.98.1 sources downloaded from your website, as well as 3.98.1 obtained via git (users space).

Any thoughts or repairs to my procedure would make my day.  Thanks very much.

Bucky,

You probably didn't run

$ git submodule update

after you checked out 3.98.1

$ git checkout -b v3.98.1

Just a guess.

Patrick

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython WriteImage output corrupted
Message-ID: <CD8C4A3D.10260%Erin.Taylor@jhuapl.edu>

Hi all,

I have a pvpython script that I've been developing and running
successfully on Mac OSX 10.6.8.  It renders a csv data set as points, then
saves an image to file.    It basically boils down to this:

cr = CSVReader()
cr.FileName = filename
cr.UpdatePipeline()
tp = TableToPoints(cr)
tp.XColumn = 'x'
tp.YColumn = 'y'
tp.ZColumn = 'z'
tp.UpdatePipeline()

Render()
view = GetRenderView()
WriteImage(image_path, view, Magnification = 2)


This works on the mac using pvpython.  However when I try to run the same
script on a 64 bit linux machine (same version of paraview, 3.98.1), the
image that is output from WriteImage is corrupted.  By that I mean the
image is a mess of black and white noise.  Sometimes the images have a
portion of the script output rendered correctly in a tile of the image.  I
should note that the image is rendered properly in the view window on this
linux machine, it is just the saved output that is corrupted.  I have
tried .png and .jpg image output with the same result.

I appreciate any ideas anyone might have on the cause of this!

Many thanks,

Erin

I should also add that I can output images from the ParaView GUI in the
linux machine with no problems.  It's just pvpython WriteImage output that
is corrupted.

After your strings i having same results:
ProgrammableSource was created....
It is showing...
But occurs nothing. Not ?????????? the massifs described in a script. Even the elementary scripts like "print 'something'" do not display the message.
Only when switching between sources, the message is displayed: "Selected proxy value not in the list: Arrow"

Subject: [Paraview] Selected proxy value not in the list: Arrow
Message-ID: <1365693187.453511.22511.18754@saddam2.rambler.ru>

After your strings i having same results:
ProgrammableSource was created....
It is showing...
But occurs nothing. Not ?????????? the massifs described in a script. Even the
elementary scripts like "print 'something'" do not display the message.
Only when switching between sources, the message is displayed: "Selected proxy
value not in the list: Arrow"

Subject: [Paraview] graphics performance problems
Message-ID: <56E0158A30405746A7DE54A0A6465A31324D49EC@exmb2.albint.com>

Has anyone had any issues running paraview on the latest iMacs (os version 10.8.3)?  We recently bought a new iMac and the graphics performance is poor when dealing with large models.  Interaction is choppy and barely tolerable, but the same input file runs smoothly on an older macbookpro laptop.  The graphics card on the imac is newer and should be more powerful, so I'm not sure why graphics performance on the laptop would be better.

Thanks.

Hi Jean,

Did you figure it out?

This is a bug. For now, use this:

from paraview.vtk import vtkFiltersCore as filters

filters.vtkProbeFilter()


I'll push a fix soon that makes sure vtkProbeFilter is part of the
paraview.vtk module.

I added a fix for this. It should show up in git master after Friday's
review.

I have experienced similar issues to a lesser level. Say if I'm looping over 20 files to generate snapshots for a movie, sometimes, 1 or 2 of these will be corrupted in a fashion similar to what is reported here. Also using 3.98.1 on Linux 64-bit, writing png files.

Hope this helps,

Matthieu

I should also add that I can output images from the ParaView GUI in the linux machine with no problems.  It's just pvpython WriteImage output that is corrupted.

Subject: [Paraview] Python API problem
Message-ID: <CAPzddEH-Ty8G5WYeLHyZ6VGLbiThH5ZhC-n+WfzKDBkx4VE7OA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm writing a ParaViewWeb application in python and I'm running into
trouble.  I load the data source, which is a volume image (.mha) as follows:

srcObj = simple.OpenDataFile(fullpath)
simple.SetActiveSource(srcObj)
rep = simple.Show()

I have managed to get the bounds and color array name information, but for
some reason I can't get to the Range information.  The way I'm trying is:

imageData = srcObj.GetPointDataInformation().GetArray(0)
scalarRange = imageData.GetRange()


I get an error saying GetComponentRange() function does not exist, and
indeed when I get the instance of the underlying vtkPVArrayInformation,
that function is not there in python, so I'm not sure how to get the range.
 I looked at the C++ header for vtkPVArrayInformation, and the
GetComponentRange is there, but it isn't available on that python object
exposed to me, even though SetComponentRange is present.

This is on current master branch of ParaView built with python wrapping.
 When I run the same code in v3.98 in the GUI with python shell, it works
fine and I get back the range for the image.  If there is some better way
to get the range, please let me know.  In older versions of the script I
just used simple.GetDataInformation(), but it looks like that function has
gone away.

Thanks,

You need to update your ParaView to ParaView/master. The version that you
have has some python wrapping issue.

I am on the current master branch, git pull shows everything up to date...
Is there something else I need to do?

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C4zdf6DnphmgY=pzjor9OZY-MPbVVtue48hEqfsu1BZHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am running Paraview in parallel to get some animations. My dataset is a
big cube and when when running in parallel it is divided in to some
subgroups and the big box now is divided in to the several boxes which are
the number of cores i am running paraview parallely on.

After viewing the animation, these boxes are shown in the animation and I
don?t want them to be present in the animation.

Is there anyway to do this?

Thanks

I noticed this odd behavior before but never noticed that it went away when
turning off Cache Geometry. The bug I reported is at
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13735. I added your information as well.

Thanks,

I wonder if has something to do with the offscreen rendering. Try the
following before Writeimage():

view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0

Does that help?

That does not seem to help. On the other hand, I've personally had success by adding a pause (time.sleep(0.5)) in my loop after each Delete(view). Does that help you pinpoint the issue? Note that I use on-screen rendering regardless as I cannot build paraview with OpenMesa on my system at this point.

Thanks in advance,

Matthieu

I have tried setting the view.UseOffscreenRendringForScreenshots to 0 with
no luck.  Still the same corrupted image output.

And I am making a series of images in a loop also.  I am updating the same
view, however, not deleting and recreating a new one.  I wonder if that
would work.

Also, in the last few days I've built paraview from source with OSMesa
support and tried using offscreen rendering, but that results in a seg
fault at Render().  I must not have it set up properly.  I followed the
instructions for build with OSMesa support, and it compiled and built
successfully, but haven't had luck getting the script to run with
offscreen rendering yet.

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6ATusSpC8rOqLaTGz06Ls7caS334_a9Dojk49QaySj0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a Dataset with .xyz extension. I couldn?t open it in Paraview, so I
converted the file to .csv

now I have a dataset with 3 arrays corresponding to x, y and z co-ordinates.

I used the "Table to Points" filter and I converted the my coordinates to
points.


Could anybody please tell me how I can open .xyz or .xyz.dat or .dat in
Paraview to represent Digital Elevation Model?

Second, If I am importing csv. files in to paraview, what can i do to get
some kind of grid out of these points to better represent the geometry that
I was planning to show using the DEM ?

Thanks for any help

For what it's worth, I've isolated the seg fault for off screen rendering
using pdb.

I call pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering simpleTest.py  (I have paraview
built using OSMesa support)

And pdb shows the seg fault during Render() is coming from
servermanager.py(346)__ConvertArgumentsAndCall()
retVal = func(*newArgs)

The simpleTest.py script contains the following:

from paraview.simple import *
import pdb
s = sphere()
Show(s)
pdb.set_trace()
Render()
WriteImage("testimage.png")

If you actually have data in DEM format (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USGS_DEM), you can open it in ParaView by
simply adding a .dem extension to the file. I am not sure if this is the
case though. .xyz is a pretty common extension so it is hard for us to help
without knowing specifics.

If you load in a set of points with csv reader, you can use one of the
Delaunay filters to mesh them.

Best,

Is it ASCII gridded XYZ format?  If yes hopefully by the end of this week I
will have a GDAL based raster reader to read this format but it won;'t make
it to VTK 6 release because of time constraint.

Thanks,

I am attempting to create a custom reader in pure Python by attaching a 
ProgrammableFilter to a Text source that provides file names and other 
input parameters in JSON syntax. When the output type of the 
programmable filter is set to a vtkRectilinearGrid (apparently anything 
other than the original vtkTable input), Paraview throws the following 
error multiple times

The data is successfully loaded and, for the rest of the session, there 
are no further errors. However, the application exits with a 
segmentation fault and core dump when I attempt to load any saved 
Paraview state files based on this pipeline. Any insights into this 
problem will be appreciated.

Hi Michael,

which version of ParaView are you using ?

Thanks,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython WriteImage output corrupted
In-Reply-To: <CD91836E.10309%Erin.Taylor@jhuapl.edu>
Message-ID: <CD91B446.10323%Erin.Taylor@jhuapl.edu>

Today I reinstalled a local version of OSMesa (7.8.2) and rebuilt ParaView
pointing to this new installation of OSMesa, and the rendering output
using on-screen rendering (X) from WriteImage now works!  There must have
been a conflict with versions of GL files (?) that was causing corrupted
output.  

On the other hand, when I try to use off-screen rendering, the script
still bombs, but has the error:

pvbatch: main/renderbuffer.c:1924: _mesa_add_renderbuffer: Assertion
'bufferName == BUFFER_DEPTH || bufferName == BUFFER_STENCIL ||
fb->Attachment[bufferName].Renderbuffer == ((void *)0)' failed.

This is an improvement that I can get some WriteImage() output to save
properly now, but I would in the end like to be able to get off-screen
rendering to work in order to run the script in a non X environment.

Thanks,
Erin

volume to stl (not just the surface) like a set of separated triangles?
Paraview display my data as a surface. Here is some screenshots of my model
and clipped model. My goal is just to handle this topology and then print
it by 3D printer.

Regards,
Dmitry

Message-ID: <1366052946.908066.12907.43118@saddam3.rambler.ru>

I solve same problem with edit collaboration.py file. Like this:

...

from vtkPVClientServerCoreCorePython import *
from vtkPVClientServerCoreDefaultPython import *
from vtkPVServerImplementationCorePython import *
from vtkPVServerImplementationDefaultPython import *
from vtkPVServerManagerCorePython import *
from vtkPVServerManagerDefaultPython import *
from vtkPVCommonPython import *

...

Hello folks

what is the status of the multi-clients support in 3.98?

I have tried different hosts, different setups and it always results in crashes,
seg faults. I wanted to know if this is related to my setup, or some known
issues.?

The wiki page http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Collaboration relates to version
3.12, so I don't know how up-to-date that is.

most of my tries are with one server, and two paraview clients (one on the same
host as server, one remote).

Also with the pvpython client, the import command fails.

from paraview.collaboration import * Traceback (most recent call last): File
"<stdin>", line 1, in <module> File
"/local1/apps/ParaView-3.98.0Build/lib/site-packages/paraview/collaboration.py",
line 29, in <module> from vtkPVClientServerCorePython import * ImportError: No

Hi,

I'm trying to package ParaView with our build options, but it looks like the CPackParaViewConfig.cmake file is no longer available in 3.98.1, unless I missed a CMake variable. I've been looking at two ways to handle this: superbuild and rebranding. I really don't need to rebrand ParaView, as we aren't wrapping in any new functionality. So, I was thinking of going with the superbuild. Can the superbuild be made to only package ParaView provided libraries and plugins? Our analysis package which uses ParaView functionality already provides many of the same dependencies (Qt, HDF) and we build ParaView against these. Therefore, we don't need to duplicate them in the installation package.

Thanks,
M

Subject: [Paraview] How to display the cellNormals as vectors?
Message-ID: <20130416012739.0d594dd0@redpanda.nl>

Hi all,

I have just imported a 3D parametric surface in Paraview (from a .VTU file generated by a Python script), and I'm wondering how to display the cellNormals as actual vectors. Since a cellNormal has an X, Y and Z component, it should be possible to use these three scalar values to create a vector, pointing from the corresponding cell. 

I know I can create a vector field with the Glyph function, but I'm not sure how to continue from there. I cannot select any Scalars or Vectors from the two dropdown menus/lists (they are enabled but there is nothing to select).

Any ideas on how to proceed would be very welcome! 

Best,
Pieter

PS: I'm using Paraview 3.98.1 on a Linux machine.

Does the file actually contain normals? I am guessing not. In that case, do:

Extract Surface
Generate Surface Normals
Glyph

If you had a vtp file (polydata) instead of vtu (unstructured grid), you
wouldn't need to Extract Surface.

ParaView does a weird thing, in the "Color By" drop down menu, it show an
array named "cellNormals" but this array doesn't actually exist on the data
object, and it doesn't appear in the information tab.  So, as Berk said,
you should apply the Generate Surface Normals filter, and make sure you
check the "Compute Cell Normals" check box.  Then you can use the "Cell
Centers" to generate point data at the cell centers.  Then you can use the
Glyph filter to draw the arrows for the cell normals.

Hi Dmitry,

Here is some screenshots of my model and clipped model. My goal is just to handle this topology and then print it by 3D printer.

The STL format only accepts triangles, not tetrahedra or other volumetric elements. Your 3D printer software will infer what regions are inside and outside the surface as long as the surface is manifold (i.e., a closed, orientable surface that is watertight). If you have a model that is not watertight, you can try using ParaView's "Clean" filter to fix it.

Hi Pat, Berk,

Thanks for your replies. Displaying the cellNormals works fine now, but I
still can't select the normals computed in my Python script from the
dropdown menus in the Glyph filter.

I uploaded the relevant .VTU file to my web space, you can find it at
http://redpanda.nl/Out.vtu (look for the data named "Normal", it has X, Y
and Z components).

Could you take a look at it?

Best,
Pieter

Michael,

Superbuild can indeed be customized to suit your needs. However,
you'll have to start with a new fork of the repo. As the wiki
explains, http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Superbuild, the Superbuild
simply builds all needed projects and then builds paraview (Look at
paraview.cmake). It also include rules for each of OS to create a
bundle/package (paraview.bundle.cmake). Create a new fork with just
paraview.cmake, paraview.build.cmake, paraview.bundle.common.cmake
(and the fixup scripts for OSX) and then customize these files as per
your needs i.e. tell ParaView to use Qt/HDF from your build, adjust
paraview.bundle.cmake to package extra dependencies, among others.

You can edit the top-level CMakeLists.txt to remove the include(..)
calls to dependencies you are no longer building as part of the
superbuild (or add new ones).

Hope that helps. Feel free to holler if you run into issues or need
further explanations.

Utkarsh

Subject: [Paraview] ParticlesPathes too short?
Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F6817230FFC@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

Hello there,

I have a time-dependent dataset with 1467 timesteps, going from t=0.0 to t=7.3 with fixed increments of 0.005 seconds

I am only partly successful in using ParticlePath. The pathes drawn are too short. I have seen the previous postings but did not find much help.

Even though I set the Termination Time to a time larger than the effective maximum time, my particle pathes are smaller than expected (about half as long as the same pathes calculated with another application).

Strangely, when I plot the ParticleAge, it has a maximum of 0.74499, no matter what value of Termination Time -greater than 0.75 - I use; this value is much smaller than the available timesteps ranging from 0.0 to 7.33

I use 'Force reinjection every 0 steps"

Are there more guidelines on the wiki on how to operate the filter?

TIA

Hi all,

I found paraview can save view by save the samera, but I can't save the
zoom level, am I missing something or what? Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Auto save images
Message-ID: <CAOtam70sWa_2E+T+vhDkVjivipAOXMDdpZV+1kp+=zqeGi-LCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Is there a way to run paraview in batch mode. I want to save images
automatically.

What I am doing is pretty simple, use paraview to view an flow field and
then pan it and zoom into a certain region and then save the screenshot.
That's it. I dont want to repeat this operation all the time. I want to do
it for all my cases in the back-end and in batch mode without opening
paraview window.

Is it possible? How? What kind of scripts should I write?

Many thanks in advance!

Daniel,

Yes, there is.  Create a Python script of what you want to do.  Easiest way is to open ParaView, Tools/ Start Trace, do your work, Tools/ Stop Trace.  Save the file somewhere.  To test it, start ParaView from scratch (or just delete everything in the pipeline browser), Tools/ Python Shell/ Run Script/ select the python script you choose earlier.

Then, close ParaView, and run your script with pvbatch your-script.py

Is that what you are asking?

Wait, I can't find what you said "start/stop trace", nor can I find any
python under tools menu? Am I using a wrong paraview? My is ParaView 3.14.1
64 bit. Ubuntu

Thanks, and Yes, that is basically what I need. Ultimately, I would hope I
can save images for my velocity field or pressure field without opening
paraview window, I hope I can just modify the script to do it.

Daniel,

I'm doing the same thing you are in my research. I load a dataset in 
Ensight format, add calculation filters, slice and export images.

You can integrate ParaView into regular python scripts by changing the 
interpreter to pvpython. For me, this means replacing:
#!/usr/local/bin/python
with
#!/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/bin/pvpython

Then you can use 'from paraview.simple import *' to access ParaView.

I used the Trace method that Alan suggested, and changed it into a 
function (eg. 'def paraview_process():'). This way, I can pass the name 
of the Ensight file to the python script and it automatically loads the 
data for manipulation.

For saving a screenshot, you should check out this sample script on the 
wiki:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Take_a_Screenshot_of_a_VTP_File

Maybe try upgrading to the latest/greatest ParaView on the web site?  It is 3.98.1.  What is your platform?  If you don't see  Python Shell under the Tools tab, your issue has changed from "how to create and run this script" to "Why don't I have Python".

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Auto save images

Hi all

Is there a way to run paraview in batch mode. I want to save images automatically.

What I am doing is pretty simple, use paraview to view an flow field and then pan it and zoom into a certain region and then save the screenshot. That's it. I dont want to repeat this operation all the time. I want to do it for all my cases in the back-end and in batch mode without opening paraview window.

Is it possible? How? What kind of scripts should I write?

Many thanks in advance!

Hi Sebastien,

The nightly binary gives the same error. However, I have recently 
observed that the error does not occur if the 3D-view is closed before 
the programmable filter is added.

At the moment, Paraview only appears to crash when there is some actual 
output from the programmable filter - in earlier attempts to restore 
state, it would crash even without any output. I am starting to doubt if 
these two problem are connected.

Thanks,

Michael

Try the Cell Centers filter.  Out.vtu --> Cell Centers --> Glyph.

What is the content of your programmable filter ?

Hi,
I have a CSV data in which I have time, x, y, z and other attributes as columns.
I am able to load the data and followed the help to display the points. But I am trying to find a way to use time column to animate the particles?
Any ideas?

Thanks

Message-ID: <516EAA88.4010202@tu-braunschweig.de>

Hi,

I have got a question concerning the effect of UpdatePipeline. Does it 
make a difference from which pipeline object I call this function, or 
does it always update the entire pipeline?

Best regards
Ian

Subject: [Paraview] Render Windows show in animation when Saving animation
 in Running Paraview in parallel
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6XuZdpgf2Ki9PFCi3A_N7pmgf2Qma6_WvqgAYQXDUAGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am running paraview in parallel and so as a result of running in paraview
, my dataset which is a big cube divides in to several render outlines
(smaller boxes, I am not sure what is the technical term to call it ).
When I try to save an animation in parallel mode though, all these division
outlines are also recorded.

I run in parallel just to have faster results on big datasets and I don?t
want to see the outline of the divisions from parallel run to be recorded
in the animation.

Is there anyway to get rid of these ?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Qt-4.7.4 vs Qt-4.8.4
Message-ID: <CD9417EF.FB52%bak@lanl.gov>

FYI it appears that building the v3.98.1 client fails with Qt-4.7.4 in the routine at

./Qt/Components/Resources/UI/pqApplicationOptions.ui

which uses 'alignment' in two locations:

       <item row="8" column="3" alignment="Qt::AlignVCenter">

       <item row="8" column="1" alignment="Qt::AlignLeft">

Qt-4.8.4 does not complain, so it might be better for ccmake to mention this Qt-version sensitivity.  (Not sure if it matters, but this is with OSMESA turned on?)

Hmmm. I wonder if there is a bug in the way time is treated in the code.
Something that scales time. How do you know that path lines are too short?
Another tool is producing different results maybe?

Hi Venkat,

you can use the threshold filter to select a given time and create an
animation cue that will change the threshold value (the time for you) so
you will be able to use the time management of ParaView with your data in a
somewhat transparent manner.

It should update the upstream part of the pipeline based on which proxy you
call it on.

I've been playing around with SuperBuild and it seems to working correct.  But, it also seems to be pulling the most recent source updates from the git repository.   Is there a way use SuperBuild to only build the most recent production release (3.98.1)?

Thanks

Find the ParaView git line in the versions.cmake file and change the GIT_TAG to v3.98.1. That worked for me.

I struggled with the Threshold filter on Table To Points for a while before realizing that the Table to Points is a 1-cell grid with all points in that one cell. The Threshold filter on time will not work in that case because the threshold will either turn all the points on or off.

You can work around this by using the Delaunay3D filter on the Table to Points object to turn your data into an unstructured grid.  Then you can use Threshold on those grid cells and isolate (or animate) times.

Hope this helps.

I agree that would be useful.

Another workaround is to write each timestep to a separate csv file and label it in a time series, I.e. data_0.csv, data_1.csv, ?, data_N.csv where N are the timesteps.  When you open the file series, paraview will read it in as a time series and animate it.

Hi all,
Many thanks for the tips.
I am still having trouble in executing the task.
It would be nice if there is a way to just select a column from the table and hook it up with animation tool.
In the table to points approach, we get option to select x, y, z columns. Why not have an option to select for time and any attribute for coloring (which I think it is already there).

Thanks

Hi all,
Many thanks for the tips.
I am still having trouble in executing the task.
It would be nice if there is a way to just select a column from the table and hook it up with animation tool.
In the table to points approach, we get option to select x, y, z columns. Why not have an option to select for time and any attribute for coloring (which I think it is already there).

Thanks
Venkat

I struggled with the Threshold filter on Table To Points for a while before realizing that the Table to Points is a 1-cell grid with all points in that one cell. The Threshold filter on time will not work in that case because the threshold will either turn all the points on or off.

You can work around this by using the Delaunay3D filter on the Table to Points object to turn your data into an unstructured grid.  Then you can use Threshold on those grid cells and isolate (or animate) times.

Hope this helps.

Hi Venkat,

you can use the threshold filter to select a given time and create an animation cue that will change the threshold value (the time for you) so you will be able to use the time management of ParaView with your data in a somewhat transparent manner.

Hedieh,
Not sure if you have a reply.  I think I am missing your point, but try changing the representation from Outline to Solid. This can be done a few rows below the "Help" menu label.  It could be that ParaView is initially bringing your data in in Outline mode (which is somewhat confusing) in order to not take the time to do the rendering if you normally wouldn't render anyway (such as if you then slice or contour).

If that isn't what you mean, mind posting a screenshot of what you see?

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Render Windows show in animation when Saving animation in Running Paraview in parallel

Hello all,
I am running paraview in parallel and so as a result of running in paraview , my dataset which is a big cube divides in to several render outlines (smaller boxes, I am not sure what is the technical term to call it ).  When I try to save an animation in parallel mode though, all these division outlines are also recorded.
I run in parallel just to have faster results on big datasets and I don?t want to see the outline of the divisions from parallel run to be recorded in the animation.
Is there anyway to get rid of these ?
Thanks

Hi,

I am trying to get the "metadata" from ParaView by connecting to the socket. I'm having an issue where I am correctly sending the command to send the data but I'm not receiving the length value or string correctly. Below is my method how I am currently trying to get the length value:

// In the main program //
                command = 2;
                if(-1 == send(socket, &command, sizeof(command), 0))
                                exit(1);

                int size;
                unsigned long long length;
                if((size = Receive(socket, &length, sizeof(unsigned long long)) <= 0)
                                exit(1);
                cout << size << endl;
                cout << length << endl;

// Receive function //
int Receive( cons int sk, void* data, int len)
{
                                char* buffer = reinterpret_cast<char*>(data);
                                int total = 0;
                                do
                                {
                                                int nRecvd = recv(socket, buffered+total, len-total, 0);
                                                if(nRecvd == 0)
                                                {
                                                                cout << "No Data Received" << endl;
                                                                exit(1);
                                                }
                                                if(nRecvd == -1)
                                                {
                                                                cout << "Error" << endl;
                                                                exit(1);
                                                }
                                                total += nRecvd;
                                }while(total < len);
                                return total;
                }

Now in the source code of the MobileSocketPlugin, I added a printf to show the value of "length" before it is sent over the socket.  When I run my code, it succeeds without an error but the value of my "length" is not equal.  For example, if I connect and run my code immediately after starting up ParaView, it always sends a value of "1733"  but I receive a value of "7443178323969" every time.  I'm really not sure what I need to change to get this correct.  If someone could point me in the right direction on what I need to be doing to receive the metadata through MobileSocketPlugin, I would greatly appreciate it!

Thanks,

Travis J. Bueter

Hi Travis,

I think you mean the MobileRemoteControl plugin, right?  Can you paste more
of your code?  From what you have shared, it's hard to know where things
are going wrong.  My guess is that you are forgetting to receive the
"ready" command: after connecting to the socket, you should first receive 4
bytes and convert them to an int.  The int should have the value 1.  That's
the "ready" command.  Next comes the code you showed in your email: send
the "send metadata command" which is an int with value 2 and should be 4
bytes.  In the code you pasted, you are using sizeof(command) but don't
show where you declare command, so that might also be a problem, if your
data type is not 4 bytes.

Here is a python example that connects to paraview and receives the
metadata:


import socket
from struct import pack
from struct import unpack


def connect(host, port):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((host, port))
    return s


def receiveReadyCommand(s):
    data = s.recv(4)
    assert unpack('i', data)[0] == 1


def sendCommand(s, command):
    data = pack('i', command)
    s.send(data)


def receiveMetaData(s):
    sendCommand(s, 2)
    data = s.recv(8)
    length = unpack('Q', data)[0]
    return s.recv(length)


def main():

    s = connect('localhost', 40000)
    receiveReadyCommand(s)

    print receiveMetaData(s)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

I tried the superbuild route and started simple by making only two
modifications: Changing the ParaView git tag to v3.98.1 and setting the
PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI to ON but not enabling Qt. OSX worked like charm and
the resulting package works. When I went to Windows, the package wouldn't
go through the install step. I chased my tail for a bit and finally found
the problem. We have to build PV without Python due an incompatibility
between PV and our software (haven't had time to debug yet). However, the
Windows install step was choking on pvbatch and pvpython not being
present. I found that the Projects/win32/paraview.bundle.cmake file wasn't
properly trapped for that. Once I fixed that, everything went smoothly and
the package works. I'm attaching the patch.

Cheers,
M

Subject: [Paraview] "WriteAllImages" fails when doing phasta in-situ viz
 linked with ParaView v3.98.1 coprocessing lib
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514B1FFAD4@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

Hello,

I am working to build an in-situ viz for a phasta simulation. I am able to build phasta linked to ParaView v3.98.1 coprocessing library and run phasta simulation linked to coprocessing library to process a python pipeline in-situ for each time step iteration.  In the pipeline, there are two rendered views with each view containing a slice and an isocontour showing a bubble in the slice, which are set to be exported to png images when exporting the pipeline. This phasta simulation with in-situ viz can run through if I comment out "WriteAllImages" in the pipeline python code and the output data (parallel unstructured grid writer output) can be written out as expected during the simulation iteration. However, when I uncomment out "WriteAllImages" statement, I got a "Generic Warning: In /../ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Parallel/MPI/vtkMPICommunicator.cxx, line 72
MPI had an error" and phasta simulation code then exits and no images are written out. So I know "WriteAllImages" causes this run time problem. I suspect I may not link all shared libs that are needed for off-screen rendering and then export to png images. Here are the libraries I have linked to currently in the Makefile:

-lPhastaAdaptor -lvtkFortranAdaptor-pv3.98 -lvtkCoProcessor-pv3.98 -lvtkCoProcessorPython -lvtkCoProcessorPython27D-pv3.98 -lvtkPVPythonSupport-pv3.98 -lvtkPVServerManagerRenderingPython -lvtkPVServerManagerCorePython -lvtkPVServerManagerDefaultPython -lvtkPVServerManagerApplicationPython -lvtkFiltersCore-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersCorePython27D-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersGeneral-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersGeneralPython27D-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersImaging-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersImagingPython27D-pv3.98 -lOSMesa.so

I am hoping someone could spot some libraries that I have missed here to get "WriteAllImages" work for in-situ viz, or perhaps there are something else I did not do correctly.

Many thanks for any suggestions or advice you can offer regarding this problem.

Hong

Hello,

On the laptop, I can save animation to ogv format, but not avi. On the desktop, I cannot save animations at all.
Can someone assist me? I have read about compiling from source using certain options...I'm not that savy with the build process. It would be great If I could just modify something existing to fix the scenario.

Hi Hong,

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Phasta built with CMake? If it is, in
CMakeLists.txt you can do something like:
find_package(ParaView REQUIRED)
include("${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE}")
...

If not, I would suggest creating a simple executable and build it with
CMake and see what libraries are linked in there. It's a bit tough to
figure out which libraries are missing as that depends on how you build
ParaView and what system libraries you're running on.

Andy

Hi Andy,

I did not build Phasta with CMake since the current Phasta I am using already has all Makefiles and build scripts available and working well, so to test it with Paraview in-situ, I just modified a phasta source code file and modified corresponding Makefile to link all needed ParaView libs. Looks like the only way to figure out which libraries are missing is through CMake. So I will give it a try.

Thanks,

Hong

Subject: [Paraview] Difficulties with camera & time controls in ParaView
	animation
Message-ID: <5175E3DC.2060008@indiana.edu>

Hello,

I'm having trouble with two separate aspects of creating a ParaView
animation: camera & time.

I am using a git version of ParaView from February 21, 2013.
"commit e81e45898f1fa6d59d95e7b0fe6da324044f38dd".

First the camera issue -- when I use the keyframe method of camera
control, I just to different keyframes, with the camera placed where
I want, and then set "Use Current", and when reviewing the numbers
they all seem correct, but then when I go to play the animation,
the distance from the point of interest/focus jumps to the distance
I want at the end of the animation rather than where I actually placed
it.

I then tried the spline method, but it has the same problem -- no matter
how far away I move the spline point, the camera is extremely zoomed in
on the data.


Second the time issue.  In the timekeeper bar, I setup a sawtooth pattern
for data-time (aka "value").  However, frequently ParaView seems to be
sorting my time keyframes, and it puts time into a triangle wave pattern.
Any way to disable the sorting of the keyframes?  I'm happy to go
and modify the code for my version of ParaView.

	Thanks,
	Bill

Subject: [Paraview] Manta on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <517788E4.1090400@gmx.de>

Hi everyone!

First of all: Great software! Just getting started with it, but this is
so helpful!

And then: We have paraview installed on our institute Linux computers,
and everything (including the Manta renderer) runs smoothly. But
sometimes, I would like to work on some graph on my laptop, which is Mac
OS X (10.8.3). I can find very little help on the Web about the Manta
plugin on Mac OS, except that officially it seems to be shipped with
version 3.98 of paraview. But it's not there. Not available in the
software, and the .dylib library is also nowhere present in the package.

So, just a silly question: I am guessing it does not ship automatically
with the Mac version? I can see it not working properly, since it
connects to X11, but I thought it was worth asking...

Thanks a lot,

Florian

Subject: [Paraview] Update time range and steps
Message-ID: <51779045.6020100@ipcms.unistra.fr>

Hello,
our group uses paraview to visualize dynamic data obtained by a 
simulation program mainly used after the simulation is finished. Our 
program generates for every time step a new file and updates a log file, 
which are processed by the reader.
To monitor the results during a simulation run we would like to use 
paraview too. For that purpose a change of TIME_STEPS() and TIME_RANGE() 
would be necessary, which is - to my knowledge - only possible within 
the RequestInformation function.

I wonder what is the best possibility to achieve an update of the 
time_steps and time_range automatically. At the moment I have a boolean 
reader-property  "refresh_time", so that after a change the apply button 
can be pressed again,  but this is far away from an elegant solution. I 
guess there is a better one. I would be grateful for a hint.

Regards
Christian

Subject: [Paraview] Accessing GetAnimationScene() from the ProgrammableSource
Message-ID: <5177E5D9.2040801@indiana.edu>

Hello,

I have a question about how to access internal ParaView data from the
Programmable Source source.

Specifically, I want to have a source that changes based on the animation
time, and so I would like to know how to get the current data-time
from within the python code of a Programmable Source.

So, using the Python_Scripting wiki entry on paraview.org, I have
found that from the Python Shell I can get information about the
current time of the animation using the GetAnimationScene() method,
so I'm hoping that there is a quick trick to accessing this data
from the ProgrammableSource python code.

Eg.
	>>> scene=GetAnimationScene()
	>>> print scene.AnimationTime
	30.0466

I think from there I can do some interesting stuff.

	Thanks in advance,
	Bill

Bill,

You cannot access animation scene from ProgrammableSource. Anything
from simple.py/servermanager.py cannot be accessed in
ProgrammableSource/Filter. You can add Python scripts as an animation
track, however. In the animation view, choose "Python" in the first
combo-box next to the "+" button.

Hello,

I am trying to use the StreamTracer with custom source on my dataset, but
my Dataset has 100,000,000 cells.

First StreamTracer with custom source is not active on cell data so I had
to convert using "Cell Data to Point Data" filter.

Then, as my dataset is so big, I can not apply  the "StreamTracer with
custom source " directly on top of "CellDataToPointData" filter, so I tried
to use "MaskPoints" to reduce the number of points to 5000 and then apply
the filter.

I am trying to draw the velocity field in a cube. The velocity vector array
seems to have passed to the Mask Point as I check in the Information tab of
the Mask Point filter, but then I don?t see any thing. I have also checked
the following in the Mask Point filter:

1. Proportionally Distribute maximum number of Points
2.Random Sampling
3. Generate Vertices
4. Single Vertex per Cell

In the MaskPoints I can see the 5000 Points created if I switch to the
Point View.

Also in the StreamTracer I am using all the defaults. I tried changing the
Maximum Steps, but it didn?t have any effect.

Could anybody please tell me what is my error in this procedure?

Thanks a lot

Hi,

The mask points filter gets rid of all of the cells so there is no way for
the stream tracer filter to find velocity values at arbitrary points in the
domain. The best way is to find a machine with more memory to run on.
Barring this, you'll have to reduce the size of your data set in some way
that keeps some type of cells. The best way I can think of is to use the
clip filter, then cell data to point data and then finally the stream
tracer filter.

Hello,

 

What plugin do i need to read/write other format files like GXF, Gemcom,
Vulcan, Datamine, ESRI Shape and Gocad?

 

In Supported Readers section at
<http://paraviewgeo.objectivity.ca/documentation/user-manual/supported-forma
ts>
http://paraviewgeo.objectivity.ca/documentation/user-manual/supported-format
s

there is a list of file formats supported by Paraview, but the latest
version of Paraview (3.98.1) does not have a plugin to read those file
formats.

 

Do you know how cad read those files in Paraview?

 

Thanks in advance

Hi,

ParaViewGeo is a direct off shoot of ParaView and you should use the
plugins provided by ParaViewGeo. You can find those plugins at:

Hi Hong,

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that everyone can benefit.

Were you able to run the fake version and output images from there? You
probably already know this but you can do "make VERBOSE=1" to see the full
build output so you don't have to go through CMake generated Makefiles to
see what libraries are linked in.

I still think going through CMake with Phasta is the best solution since it
will work on other machines as well.

Andy

Thanks again for this, this is a great tool to know about -- I was
doing animations stuff all day yesterday and didn't notice it.

I have a couple of updates:

First, with the Animation Python script, I'm not sure how the
geometry I generate can be placed into the scene.

Second, I managed to figure out a way to use a Programmable Filter
fed by an "AnnotateTime" source to make a geometry that is based on
time!  So that's the good news -- example Python script below.

The bad news is that I didn't quite think this through.  What I want
is basically a time/progress bar at the top, and I can do that now,
but what I forgot is that the camera moves in the animation, and I
don't want my progress bar to move!  I should have thought of that
from the outset!

I've been doing some research and experimenting with vanilla VTK, and
it doesn't seem to be the case that I can have a 2D geometric object
that is immune to the camera's movements.  (And if anyone knows anything
different than that, I'd love to hear about it.)

So, I decided to just try something simple for now, but of course nothing
is simple.  I was thinking that I'd just create a text representation of
time -- ie a bunch of ohs in a string ("oooooo..."), but now I don't
know if I can produce a Text object other than from a source -- ie. can
I programatically create a text object that will be immune to camera
moves (ie. using a vtkActor2D underneath the hood).

Thoughts? ...  Hang on, I just discovered that links can do more than
link cameras!  So any thoughts on how I might take advantage of a link
to create a text string in a programmable filter and pipe that into a
Text object?


As always when working with ParaView, even after I feel like I've learned
a lot, the amount of knowledge of what I don't know about it seems
to have expanded even more!

For example: the programmable filter has three places for scripts:
	- Script
	- RequestInformation Script
	- RequestUpdateExtent Script
Each have popups, but the message is self referential -- I have to
know what the RequestInformation pass or the RequestUpdateExtent pipeline
pass means to know how these work.


Okay, as promised, thanks to some code from Utkarsh, and a lot of
trial an error, I present a programmable filter script that modifies
the shape of this triangle based on animation time:

-----------------------------------------------------------
time = self.GetInput().GetValue(0,0).ToFloat();
#print time;

# Create a poly-data instance
#pd = vtk.vtkPolyData()

# Instead link to the poly-data created for the output
pd = self.GetPolyDataOutput();

# Set up the containter to save the
# point locations (geometry)
points = vtk.vtkPoints()
pd.SetPoints(points)

# Add the point coordinates
points.SetNumberOfPoints(3)
points.SetPoint(0, 0, 0, 0)
points.SetPoint(1, 2, time, 0)
points.SetPoint(2, 3, 0, 0)

# We are adding a single triangle with
# 3 points. Create a id-list to refer to
# the point ids that form the triangle.
ids = vtk.vtkIdList()
ids.SetNumberOfIds(3)
ids.SetId(0, 0)
ids.SetId(1, 1)
ids.SetId(2, 2)

# Since this polydata has only 1 cell,
# allocate it.
pd.Allocate(1, 1)

# Insert the cell giving its type and
# the point ids that form the cell.
pd.InsertNextCell(vtk.VTK_POLYGON, ids)
-----------------------------------------------------------

So, in order to get time, the Programmable Filter must have as its
input an "AnnotateTime" module that just outputs a numeric value for
time.  And then the output type for the filter must be set to "vtkPolyData".

Hi,

You may want to look at Catalyst (catalyst.paraview.org). There is some
ability to interact live with simulation data and that's something I'm
hoping to improve upon in the near future. It may not be exactly what
you're looking for but it's the closest thing that I can think of.

I'm am little confused, what is that you exactly want to see? I can
figure out how to show that.

Nothing visually complicated.  In my animation sequence I have data
time repeat over and over again as I represent it using different
methods.  I currently show that time value using the "AnnotateTime"
source, but I feel that that number gets lost in the shuffle, so I
want to have something that looks like a progress bar that is tied
to data-time and grows as we progress in the simulation.  And when
the simulation time resets to 0, the bar goes back to the beginning.

Like I said, very simple, yet very difficult.

I did more exploration with creating a string that I might use
instead of a polygonal object, but then I was foiled when I
realized that even though I can put a string into a Table output,
the "Manage Links" tool doesn't have an option to link data output
to a source/filter parameter.  Only parameter to parameter!

So I'm back to the polygonal object.

Following may help:

- Create a mapper for your polydata.
- Set that mapper to a vtkFollower.
- Pass camera to vtkFollower (view.GetActiveCamera())
- Add vtkFolllower to view (view.GetRenderer2D().AddActor(follower)

You'll have to figure out what Python modules to import to get the
vtkFollower/vtkPolyDataMapper, if needed. If all goes well, that may
work.

Right, first thing I'm having difficulty figuring how is how to get
the view from within the Programmable Filter.  I'm sure it's because
it's a serverside object, right, but I found what I thought would
help -- I can get the Proxy for the view and the camera -- but I can't
figure out how to actually get the view object, or remotely access
the view via the Proxy.

E.g.:
	view = servermanager.vtkSMViewProxy()
	print dir(view)

	camera = servermanager.vtkSMCameraProxy()
	print dir(camera)

I can't find any methods from those method listings that tie me to
actually using the camera or the view.

It seems like if I can get over this hump I could be in good shape.

	Thanks,
	Bill

Don't do this in ProgrammableFIlter, do it in the "Python" animation script.

Okay, but I don't know how to get geometry generated in a Python animation
script to be placed into the pipeline.  I've only figured out how
to do that in the ProgrammableFilter.

The stub of code you had posted earlier should still work.

Hi Andy,

Many thanks for the tip! Once I linked all the ParaView libraries to Phasta by referring to the CMake-generated fake version, everything works and I can see all images generated for each time step while phasta is running in-situ :)

Thanks again for all your help!

Hong

Hi Hong,

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that everyone can benefit.
Were you able to run the fake version and output images from there? You probably already know this but you can do "make VERBOSE=1" to see the full build output so you don't have to go through CMake generated Makefiles to see what libraries are linked in.
I still think going through CMake with Phasta is the best solution since it will work on other machines as well.

Hi Andy,

I know this is a na?ve question, but I hope you don't mind and can drop me a quick response. Since I did use CMake to build a simple fake fortran simulation code linked to Paraview coprocessing library version 3.98.1, so I am hoping I can use that CMake-generated Makefile (or other CMake-generated files) to determine which Paraview modules need to be linked to for in-situ viz, especially those modules related off-screen rendering and image writers. This way, I don't have to use CMake to build Phasta but instead can leverage the existing Phasta Makefiles with sufficient number of Paraview module libraries related to in-situ viz linked. In fact, I have already got phasta with in-situ run mostly working - it is just that "WriteAllImages" part does not work, which makes me suspect some offscreen rendering-related libraries may not be linked. I did link to Mesa library for off-screen rendering. I guess I just want to check with you to get expert's advice to see if there is any simpler way to fix this problem without rebuilding phasta with CMake. Otherwise, I'll just go ahead to try to build Phasta with CMake if you think that is the best way to proceed at this point.

Many thanks as always,

Best,

Hong

Hi Andy,

I did not build Phasta with CMake since the current Phasta I am using already has all Makefiles and build scripts available and working well, so to test it with Paraview in-situ, I just modified a phasta source code file and modified corresponding Makefile to link all needed ParaView libs. Looks like the only way to figure out which libraries are missing is through CMake. So I will give it a try.

Thanks,

Hong

Hi Hong,
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Phasta built with CMake? If it is, in CMakeLists.txt you can do something like:
find_package(ParaView REQUIRED)
include("${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE}")
...
If not, I would suggest creating a simple executable and build it with CMake and see what libraries are linked in there. It's a bit tough to figure out which libraries are missing as that depends on how you build ParaView and what system libraries you're running on.

Hello,

I am working to build an in-situ viz for a phasta simulation. I am able to build phasta linked to ParaView v3.98.1 coprocessing library and run phasta simulation linked to coprocessing library to process a python pipeline in-situ for each time step iteration.  In the pipeline, there are two rendered views with each view containing a slice and an isocontour showing a bubble in the slice, which are set to be exported to png images when exporting the pipeline. This phasta simulation with in-situ viz can run through if I comment out "WriteAllImages" in the pipeline python code and the output data (parallel unstructured grid writer output) can be written out as expected during the simulation iteration. However, when I uncomment out "WriteAllImages" statement, I got a "Generic Warning: In /../ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Parallel/MPI/vtkMPICommunicator.cxx, line 72
MPI had an error" and phasta simulation code then exits and no images are written out. So I know "WriteAllImages" causes this run time problem. I suspect I may not link all shared libs that are needed for off-screen rendering and then export to png images. Here are the libraries I have linked to currently in the Makefile:

-lPhastaAdaptor -lvtkFortranAdaptor-pv3.98 -lvtkCoProcessor-pv3.98 -lvtkCoProcessorPython -lvtkCoProcessorPython27D-pv3.98 -lvtkPVPythonSupport-pv3.98 -lvtkPVServerManagerRenderingPython -lvtkPVServerManagerCorePython -lvtkPVServerManagerDefaultPython -lvtkPVServerManagerApplicationPython -lvtkFiltersCore-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersCorePython27D-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersGeneral-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersGeneralPython27D-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersImaging-pv3.98 -lvtkFiltersImagingPython27D-pv3.98 -lOSMesa.so

I am hoping someone could spot some libraries that I have missed here to get "WriteAllImages" work for in-situ viz, or perhaps there are something else I did not do correctly.

Many thanks for any suggestions or advice you can offer regarding this problem.

Hong

Subject: [Paraview] Output of ParallelUnstructuredGridWriter running on
	multiple nodes
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514B20C3A3@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

I am running a simulation in-situ linked with ParaView CoProcessing library with a pipeline that includes "slice->Integrate Variables Filter->ParallelUnstructuredGridWriter" so that integrated velocity value for a slice at each time point can be written out while running the simulation in-situ. The output from this ParallelUnstructureGridWriter for each time step includes one pvtu file plus one vtu file from each running node, so that is a lot of output files for each time point especially when running on a large number of nodes in parallel. However, it looks like only the output vtu file from processing node 0 includes valid velocity range value while other output vtu files from other nodes include only blank/empty values. So I am wondering whether there is a good way to set up only outputting vtu file from processing node 0 to prevent output of those large number of files that don't include valid/useful values. Any suggestions are very much appreciated.

Thanks,

Hong

Message-ID: <9047EE0D4D3C8E43B93980DA10A073807C422E30@EXMB04.srn.sandia.gov>

I have a csv file of points.  After running it through the table to point filter, I am running the delauney 3d filter on it.  The dataset looks like a watermelon rind.  Unfortunately, the red part of the watermelon is solid.  Fortunately, changing the alpha variable fixes this - deleting the red "meat" part of the watermelon.

My issue is that we are ending up with lots of white lines all over the outside of the solid object.  Think of my water melon rind as the outside green layer with the white rind, covered with white spider webs.

Has anyone seen this, and is there a fix or workaround?

Thanks,

Alan

Hi,

The parallel XML data set writers all write independently of each other (no
MPI communication is needed in the writers). Because of this they can't
tell process 0 when writing it's meta-data file that it doesn't need to
write out meta data for them.

Hi,
I try to add a time averaged field to the XDMF reader of a temporal

I done something like in the example below.
That work not to bad there is just a problem: for example looking at the

But the iso-surface will work and  be colored properly.
Please is somebody known where can come from this problem and how to fix it?

Hello.

Paraview 3.98.1 is able to read Tecplot ASCII or Binary files.

For Tecplot (.plt) files, menu "File->Open" and choose "Tecplot Binary 
Files (Vislt) (*.plt)" in the "Files of type" list before selecting your 
(.plt) file.

Hello.

Glad to see that you have solved your problem. It is true that you need 
the Vislt software for reading Tecplot files, but this software is 
included in the last Paraview release 3.98.1. I am using the last 
binaries found on the Paraview download pages, and I can read Tecplot 
binary or ASCII files without adding software.

On older Paraview releases, the Vislt software was delivered as a plugin 
that was not activated by default. In that case, you had to go through 
the menu "Tools->Manage plugins", then select the "Vislt" plugin, click 
the "Load selected" button, close Paraview, and finally reopen Paraview 
to get the plugin activated. So, check your Paraview version, and you 
may want to update it for the last 3.98.1 release.

But take care: there are two Tecplot readers. If you open a (.tp) ASCII 
Tecplot file, you will have the choice between "Tecplot Files" or 
"Tecplot Files (Vislt)". I don't know exactly what are the differences, 
but if a reader fails, try the other.

But the Tecplot readers are not perfect, and that may explain your ERROR 
message. Sometimes, with Tecplot ASCII files, I have to remove from the 
header some options that the readers do not recognize. Try to have the 
simplest headers without "exotic" options when using ASCII files, and 
the readers will be OK.

If you have again problems with (.plt) files, feel free to provide a 
(short) sample file.

Richard

Hi Zhang.

Just a last info: since my last mail, I have made some tests with old 
binary Tecplot (.plt) files, and I discovered that some files are 
readable, but some files are not readable and give the same error 
message. In fact, it depends on the Tecplot version that has built these 
files. So, if you have problems with old (.plt) files, you may try to 
convert them into a recent version of the (.plt) format using a recent 
Tecplot release before reading them with Paraview.

Have a good week-end.

Richard.

This is a repost from the developer list? I am still looking for information on how I might go about creating a data array selection box like this:

Hello,

I am working on a spacecraft data source, and I need to create a data array selection window similar to that in the image attached:

[cid:6453E4AC-ACC7-4773-9D30-1D87EDA4D228]

How do I do this with filter's XML?  I need to have heading for the type of space-craft, and then an arbitrary number of selectable spacecraft below the heading.

Thanks,
Josh

I don't think the xml is that sophisticated, you're probably going to 
need a custom panel for that.

Message-ID: <CANmPiKANVz89K123Ft9iToi4ZB7mBD9UavaFtxgv8AyGnRv5vQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on a ParaView plugin that has a file as a parameter. What
would be the best property type to use for this? A string property
would work, but it would be great if there were a property that
brought up a file browser to locate the file. Does one exist?

Thanks,
Cory

The FileListDomain will do the trick...

                            command="SetFileName"

Thanks, Andy. In our case, users only want to observe one integrated velocity value (one output value from Integrate Variable Filter) for the slice at each time step so that they can determine from which time point on this velocity value stops changing which indicates to them the simulation has converged. So this large amount of output files from the ParallelUnstructuredGridWriter is hard to serve this purpose. I am wondering whether there is a way for me to export the SpreadSheetRepresentation view (to view Integrate Variable Filter output) as a screen capture when I export pipeline in python for coprocessing? It looks like the "Export State" GUI for coprocessing only allows to export rendered views, not other types of views. If not, I am thinking perhaps I can write a customized writer plugin to only export the needed output value for our purpose and to make this writer only exports one file for each time step regardless of the number of processors it runs on.

Thanks for any more information you can provide!

Hi,
The parallel XML data set writers all write independently of each other (no MPI communication is needed in the writers). Because of this they can't tell process 0 when writing it's meta-data file that it doesn't need to write out meta data for them.

I am running a simulation in-situ linked with ParaView CoProcessing library with a pipeline that includes "slice->Integrate Variables Filter->ParallelUnstructuredGridWriter" so that integrated velocity value for a slice at each time point can be written out while running the simulation in-situ. The output from this ParallelUnstructureGridWriter for each time step includes one pvtu file plus one vtu file from each running node, so that is a lot of output files for each time point especially when running on a large number of nodes in parallel. However, it looks like only the output vtu file from processing node 0 includes valid velocity range value while other output vtu files from other nodes include only blank/empty values. So I am wondering whether there is a good way to set up only outputting vtu file from processing node 0 to prevent output of those large number of files that don't include valid/useful values. Any suggestions are very much appreciated.

Thanks,

Hong

I responded to Alan directly, but I'll repeat the response for the list as well.

The reason why you see white lines is that the alpha parameter causes the Delaunay 3D filter to create lines (or triangles) if they fit within the circumsphere smaller than alpha and the tetrahedron does not.  These lines are rendered without shading, so they show up as stark white streaks in the rendering.

The most straightforward solution to get what you want is to filter out any cells that are not tetrahedra.  I don't know of a filter designed for that, but you can do it with a Programmable Filter with the following script.  (Watch out for any newlines that an email program might insert.)

from paraview.vtk import vtkFiltersCore

input = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput()
output = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput()

typesArray = input.GetCellTypesArray()
typesArray.SetName('__types__')

inputWithTypes = vtk.vtkUnstructuredGrid()
inputWithTypes.ShallowCopy(input)
inputWithTypes.GetCellData().AddArray(typesArray)

threshold = vtk.vtkFiltersCore.vtkThreshold()
threshold.SetInputData(inputWithTypes)
threshold.SetInputArrayToProcess(0,0,0,'vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_CELLS','__types__')
threshold.ThresholdBetween(9.5, 10.5)
threshold.Update()
thresholdOutput = threshold.GetOutput()

output.ShallowCopy(thresholdOutput)
output.GetCellData().RemoveArray('__types__')

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Delauney 3d

I have a csv file of points.  After running it through the table to point filter, I am running the delauney 3d filter on it.  The dataset looks like a watermelon rind.  Unfortunately, the red part of the watermelon is solid.  Fortunately, changing the alpha variable fixes this ? deleting the red ?meat? part of the watermelon.

My issue is that we are ending up with lots of white lines all over the outside of the solid object.  Think of my water melon rind as the outside green layer with the white rind, covered with white spider webs.

Has anyone seen this, and is there a fix or workaround?

Thanks,

Alan

Josh,

hmm, I was looking on the wiki for an example of a custom panel and I 
learned custom panels are now/soon deprecated! There are some examples 
around, I think the exodus reader has one, the pqSQPlaneSource is 
another, but you probably should focus on the new approach if you want 
it to work in later release of PV. http://paraview.org/Wiki/Properties_Panel

Hi All

I'm trying to make paraview run over vnc (and xrdp)

I'm using default build from debian wheezy with libgl1-mesa-swx11

I have GLX (glxgears) and VTK (simple Python VTK example) working but
paraview shows just the splash screen and the error;

X Error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 9
  Major opcode: 62 (X_CopyArea)
  Resource id:  0x0

and nothing else happens.

If I run it as
$ ssh -X localhost paraview
still inside the VNC session it seems to work fine

What do I need to make it work directly?

Thanks
Regards
Torben

Hi Jane,

if you checkout the current ParaView/master that should soon be released as
4.0, you can get an embedded version of ParaViewWeb if you enable Python.
You should find inside your build tree a directory named 'www' that
contains few sample applications and if you enable the WEB_DOCUMENTATION,
that web site will also contain the 'full documentation' on ParaViewWeb.
For that you will need to install jsduck, but that's totally optional.

Please let us know if you are getting some issue with the current master,

Thanks,

Seb

PS: We are currently working on the release of ParaView but once that's
done, documentation and announcement around ParaViewWeb will be made.

I can think of two options for this, the first is modifying the
co-processing script to get the data you want directly from the output
without writing it to disk. Look at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting for some information on
that. Otherwise, you can try using the Python programmable filter to
extract the data as well and write it to disk.

If it was me I'd go with the first option.

Thanks, Andy. Please correct me if I am wrong since I may not get what you really mean here. I agree the first option sounds like a good one, and I am thinking I can modify the co-processing script to add "CreateWriter()" to write the output from the Integrate Variables filter. Since it is not a parallel writer, I am thinking this "CreateWriter()" might work by only writing to disk from the first processor. Otherwise, there might be a way to pass this output value to the simulation code Phasta for it to output the value only from the first processor? Since users need to observe the output from simulation when running it in-situ (without live feed at this point), the only way I can think of is through the disk output for the users to observe, or is there another way?

Thanks again,

Hong

I can think of two options for this, the first is modifying the co-processing script to get the data you want directly from the output without writing it to disk. Look at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting for some information on that. Otherwise, you can try using the Python programmable filter to extract the data as well and write it to disk.

If it was me I'd go with the first option.

Hi,
The parallel XML data set writers all write independently of each other (no MPI communication is needed in the writers). Because of this they can't tell process 0 when writing it's meta-data file that it doesn't need to write out meta data for them.

Hi,

I also tried to use Paraview in order to read Tecplot data (see the 
question I asked on Feb, 4 : 
http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg17756.html). 
Richard is right about the readers in version 3.98. There are indeed 3 
of them : "Tecplot Files" (ASCII) is the original one I guess, and there 
are also the "VisIt" plugins, "Tecplot Files (VisIt)" (ASCII) and 
"Tecplot Binary Files (VisIt)" (binary). No need to install any other 
software, it should work out-of-the-box.

Please note that if your data is time-dependent, currently the only way 
to process it is to use the "Tecplot Files" ASCII reader, because 
neither VisIt plugins can handle time series. Hopefully, this issue will 
be fixed in the next release (Sebastien Jourdain seems to be working on it).

If your data does not depend upon time, Paraview should do the job (I 
successfully used all of the 3 readers). If you get an error, as Richard 
suggested, you may try to clean up the headers or use a more recent 
version of Tecplot (2011 and 2012 work for me).

Regards,

Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] Initialize coprocessor fails
Message-ID: <C7ACF6F2C9304A4C81EAC2E2C96B5E165F1EF69C@EXMB01.drc.com>

Hello!

I have a Fortran serial test case working that uses the Catalyst coprocessor to generate images.

I tried moving to a parallel test case, but the program crashes with the error:

ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Attempt to redefine an existing data type in file runtime/orte_globals.c at line 218

at the call to initialize the coprocessor:

call coprocessorinitializewithpython("coproc.py",9)

Does this call change in parallel, or should only one processor be calling it?

If I comment out the line of code that calls the coprocessor initialization, then the code runs fine, I just get the error that the co-processor needs to initialize every time there is a VTK coprocessor call.

Thanks for any help,
Lucas

Message-ID: <CAFtK+etGTrQFA1Wp+54-KkeEV6M-eW+Z-ZOxgeNxJnCDHZopKw@mail.gmail.com>

hi!

  I'm interested in integrating over a part of an area on a surface. Like
here

www.personal.psu.edu/guv106/paraviewIntegrateVariables.png

  Now, I use thresholding on a variable that I compute using the Coords on
the surface to extract the specific area over which I want the integral.
The problem is the the area integral is extremely dependent on the details
of thresholding. If I change the thresholding just enough to include
another layer of cells in the original data, then the integral value
changes... else for any changes in the thresholding limits, the integral
does not change. And this is despite using Point data on the integral. Is
there anyway, I can get a smooth variation of the area integrals with the
change of thresholding limits? In other words, an actual area integral!

All,

I'm very confused about animate camera using Interpolate Camera Position.

Here's a simple test case - open bake.exo.

Zoom in to one corner of the geometry

Set up animation add Camera, Interpolate

Set keyframe at 1st frame as Copy Current Camera
Set keyframe at last frame as Copy Current Camera

Step thru animation - keyframes are ignored.

I am stumped - any ideas?  I have a part which has significant 
deformation - I want to zoom into a critical region and follow it as the 
structure deforms.

Thanks

Dennis

Hi Lucas,

Every process should call coprocessorinitializewithpython(). I'm not sure
how to solve this but first off maybe trying the Fortran 90 example at
https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode may help simplify the
problem. What machine are you trying this on and what version of ParaView
are you using?

Andy

Hi Hong,

I just want to verify what you're really trying to do. It looks like you
want to use Catalyst to figure out if your transient simulation has reached
a steady state by determining if an integrate value stays constant over
several time steps I guess this could be done in Catalyst but convergence
criteria is probably better handled in the simulation code itself. As far
as getting information from Catalyst back into the simulation code, that's
doable but may take a bit of work for those not familiar with ParaView's
Python API. You may be able to figure it out with the previous information
I sent you. Once that's computed in the Python script, you can pass that
information back to your adaptor code with vtkCPDataDescription's UserData
object.

The curve is x ->u(x).

Now I would like to draw u using a logarithmic scale for the abscisse.=20

I tried to do things with "Filters / Calculator"=2C "Filters / Python Calcu=
lator"
and "Sources / Axes" but nothing is working now.=20

How should I proceed ?

Thanks in advance!
