I just had the same thing happen to me. The ensight checker warned me of the 
fact that my paths were absolute. Setting a relative path in Fluent for the 
ensight file (i.e. only specify a filename, don't start with C:\ or /) fixed this 
warning and the error in ParaView.

P.S. Any chance that the .encas extension Fluent uses for EnSight Gold files 
could be added to ParaView?

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Can a plugin add its documentation to PV Online Help
	window?
Message-ID: <955493980@web.de>

Hi,

in short:
Is there any means to have a plugin extend the Online Help (at least for PV CVS)? There is no mention of this in neither tutorials, wiki nor released plugins nor plugin examples in the PV source tree.

a bit more elaborate:
When using a plugin that provides a panel (like a custom filter or reader), there is always a help button. Clicking it the Output Messages window will raise the error
like "QTextBrowser: No document for qthelp://paraview.org/paraview/Documentation/FooSeriesReader.html". So, we learn there is already a generic reference to a help file and there is no need to update somehow the PV help index itself for the time being. The error leads me to believe that I only have to somehow squeeze in my own HTML file.

Obviously, there is no cmake variable BUILD_DOCUMENTATION when one compiles its own plugin. So, I tried manually, but unsuccessfully. My guess was to 

* have CMakeLists.txt include a *.qrc file instead of a *.xml file
      GUI_RESOURCES FooReaderGUI.qrc
#   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES FooReaderGUI.xml

* extend this *.qrc file to not only include the GUI xml, but also a reference to a HTML or a Qt compiled help file (in the same way as it is done in Qt/Components/pqExtraResources.qrc and Applications/StreamingParaView/pqExtraResources.qrc):

<RCC>
     <qresource prefix="/ParaViewResources" >
         <file>FooReaderGUI.xml</file>
         <file alias="Documentation/FooSeriesReader.html">pqFooReader.qch</file>
     </qresource>
</RCC>

* and finally by compiling this pqFooReader.qch from pqFooReader.qhp, a file designed according to
./Documentation/pqClient.qch using Qt 4.5.2's qhelpgenerator

Everything compiles fine (against PV CVS as of today), but clicking on the help button when the custom reader's panel appears, still the same error is raised. I guess the alias in the *.qrc is incorrect? Anyone got this working already?

Many thanks for hints
Karl

What type of algorithm are use by ParaView for volume render? What type of
data is supportet? I like to know if ParaView can volume render this data or
should I seek other? How does ParaView compared to the other app? I mean
performance and algorithm.
Thx! Bamping

Guys, thanks for all the responses, the tracker entry and applying the
patch.

I'm afraid I'm not sure if I can provide a good test dataset since the
bug does not affect small cases (the point insertion should take
O(n^2) of time where n is the number of points, when the hasing is not
working) and relies on indeterminate values (there's always a
possibility that the problem doesn't reproduce), which is why I did
all the tracking down by myself. But I'll see if I can do something.

Not currently. But there's plan to support this use case for ParaView 3.8.

It can volume render unstructured grids (tets etc) and imagedata.

For imagedata, it uses fixed point ray casting.
For unstructured, you can choose between projected tetrahedra, HAVS, ZSweep,
or Bunyk ray casting.

These are a subset of the volume rendering options within the VTK library.
Others may be added in the future.

As for performance comparisons, I do not know.

Hi,

Thanks for your responses.  My dataset a multi-block structure consisting of
zones, each containing a single volume and multiple surfaces, e.g.

   - zone1 (vtkMultiBlockDataSet)
   - volume (vtkUnstructuredGrid)
      - surfaces (vtkMultiBlockDataSet)
      - surface1 (vtkPolyData)
         - surface2 (vtkPolyData)
         - ...
      - ...
   - zoneN
   - volume
   - surfaces
   - surface1
      - surface2
         - ...

I'm not sure how to keep this structure when writing a parallel reader?  Do
I just return exactly the same structure for each MPI process with different
data?

Thanks,
Paul

Yes.  You should return the same structure for each MPI process.  In fact, you should have the same non-null leaves on each process (that is, the same vtkUnstructuredGrids and vtkPolyDatas) so that parallel iterations over the structure return corresponding data sets.  However, it is perfectly valid to have blocks that contain zero points and cells.

I'm not sure how to keep this structure when writing a parallel reader?  Do I just return exactly the same structure for each MPI process with different data?

Thanks,
Paul


2009/9/23 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov>
You said your data is multiblock, but you did not say how many blocks it has.  D3 is going to run its partitioning algorithm on each block independently.  This is bad if you have lots of blocks; you will end up with lots of tiny pieces on all the processes.

To make your reader "parallel", you basically just have to set vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() in the output information in the RequestInformation call (usually you set it to -1 to allow the downstream pipeline to set any number of pieces) and then read vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() and vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), which will correspond to the number of processes and local rank in ParaView, in the RequestData call.

If your data typically has lots of blocks, I would design the reader to simply assign blocks to pieces so that each piece has about the same amount of data and then read in the blocks associated with the requested piece.  This should yield the simplest code and the fastest reading times, and the approach (generally) does not require you to worry about ghost cells.

The simplest example of a reader that responds to piece requests is the vtkParticleReader.  That reader breaks up a list of points into the requested pieces, but it is not a stretch to do the same thing with the blocks.

Hi,

I've been experimenting with ParaView in parallel without much.  Below I have listed my setup, experiences and questions!

Setup
My setup is a 6 node gigabit cluster (without gfx cards), compiled with OSMesa.  The filesystem is only a RAID on the frontend exported with NFS.  Each node has 8 cores and I experimented running with both 1 core per node and also 8 cores per node

Data
The data I am reading is multiple blocks, where each contains an unstructured grid and a multiblock structure of polydata surfaces.  The data is about 10 million points in total.

Reader
My reader is not written for parallel so I loaded in the mesh and partitioned it with D3.  The partitioning took a long time - approx 2 mins - is this normal?  When the data was partitioned I didn't really notice much difference in speed and the rendering performance was considerably worse than a single node for the same data.  Is this just the result of using OSMesa?  If so, does anyone have any suggestions for the number of nodes to be running on?  I also tried saving my data once it was partitioned but then loading it actually took longer (is this due to a lack of parallel filesystem?)

Filters
I tried to run some of my custom filters but one that calculates scalar variables for pointdata didn't display the variables in the GUI after running the filter.  Do I to do something different for parallel filters?

Finally, is there any documentation for implementing parallel readers (or simple examples) in ParaView?  And, does anyone have any suggestions for how to split up the data?

Thanks,
Paul

This is not really a bug. When a state file is loaded ParaView removes
all representations (with all their current settings) for existing
objects. Hence all color information etc. for the existing objects is
lost. In fact, there has been talk to remove all existing objects in
totality before state is loaded.

This is a feature :). We associate separate colors with surface and
(points, wireframe, outline). Just to see the usefulness of this, try
this: with default paraview settings (use paraview -dr if you have
changed your settings) create a 2 spheres, one with surface
representation and another with wireframe. Now save a screenshot,
however choose the "Print" color palette before hitting Ok. Now look
at the image, you'll see that without any extra hardwork, your
wireframes are visible (in black) while your solid sphere is nice and
white with shading (image attached).

> Part II:
> ?- Still in wireframe mode, set the ambient color to red
> ?- Switch to surface with edges' representation
> ?- Result: wireframe and surface appear blue!!

This is again due to the fact that wire frame and surface and
edge-color are different colors. If you want to change egde color,
there's a "Set Edge Color" button on the display tab.

That's very strange. What does the link line look like if you compile

Well, i'm running a tutorial, so I don't think that the error is in
the datafile, since it came pre-made from the software files.

It's a subtle bug in CMake that I introduced in version 2.7.20090710
(three days before your version) with another change.

I've committed a work-around to ParaView because it actually cleans
up the source anyway.

Meanwhile, I'm fixing CMake for the 2.8.0 release.

I hope I am on the right mailing list. Apologies if not.

I want to add two vtk files with different topologies. Actually the 
unstructured mesh in the two files is almost the same except that one 
has a number of zero volume (cohesive) elements and the other one does not.

Is this possible in Paraview? Any other tips would be appreciated.

What do you mean by adding? Adding some data values or merging the two meshes?

Tabrez,

If by "add," you mean disply both datum-sets at the same time--

ParaView is quite happy to open and read multiple data files, for 
example, meshA.vtu and meshB.vtu. You can then construct individual 
filter pipelines and/or set individual display features for the two 
meshes/datum-sets. If there is symmetry plane, you can select the 
right-half of one datum-set and the left-half of the other datum-set and 
display them side-by-side.  Your options are pretty much unlimited.  The 
more you use PV the smarter if gets.

If you make the cohesive zone mesh an independently displayable object 
with its own data ( e.g., meshCZ.vtu), you can open and read that as a 
3rd object as well.

David/Berk/Samuel

Thanks for your reply.

I want to add/combine stress results in two .vtk files. They look  
exactly the same but have different mesh topologies. If the topology  
was same I could just pre process the data before viewing it and add  
the cell results (stress in this case) together.

For example here are the stress viz of the two datasets (the mesh  
being different in both cases).

http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~stali/tmp/ds1.png
http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~stali/tmp/ds2.png

I just want to add the two (meaning the result would show the combined  
stresses).

I tried using append by first highlighting the two datasets in the  
pipeline browser and then clicking the 'Append Dataset' but it doesnt  
seem to work unless I am missing something.

Yeah, thanks a lot, Brad! Current CMake and ParaView built all the way.

I guess it really does pay off to list all of those version numbers  
when you write to the list with an obscure problem! :)

Talk to you later,

Dear all,

I am currently looking for a way to visualise the distance between two unstructured 2D-grids. This means I would need a scalar field with the distance between the two grids which I want to visualise as a contour of one of the two grids.
Is there a way in Paraview to create this "distance" scalar field? Thanks.

BastiL

Ok it is lets say the "normal distance" between the elements. These two meshes represents two geometries which are very simular and I simply want to visualise where and how much the geometries differ....

Assuming the topology is the same and a 1:1 correspondance between the two, it would be very easy to do with the python programmable filter.

Script would:
get hold of both input data sets
copy either to the output data set
make a new point associated double array and add it to the output
make the array 3 components wide

Ok it is lets say the "normal distance" between the elements. These two meshes represents two geometries which are very simular and I simply want to visualise where and how much the geometries differ....

Regards.




How do you define distance?

FYI, this fix has also been ported to 3.6 branch (so 3.6.2 and other
patch releases should have it).

True. However, I have no 1:1 correspondance since geometries have
certain areas where they differ. I guess I need some kind of octree
tocalculate distance....

Hi Bastil,

I did something similar where I was calculating the wall distance for a
volume.  You can create a filter that takes two inputs.  First build a
vtkCellLocator with one input.  Then iterator over the points in the other
input and use the FindClosestPoint method.

Note: this is quite slow.

Regards,
Paul

Hi Zhanping,

If you are fortunate your input data sets will have ID's that you can use to
establish the correspondance between the two. Using the ID's to find and
compare like cells/points would result in a much faster algorithm than would
recovering the correspondance manually as Paul suggests.

Message-ID: <d7f4480f0910051230ief9ea8aqb8f6cbff807eeb91@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to begin adding some non-trivial 2d plotting capabilities to my
ParaView plugin; in that interest I've implemented a filter which is
derived from vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm. For now, I am trying only a
simple example, where my X coordinates are the particle ids, my Y and
Z coordinates are dummy arrays with one element, and my data is the id
to the power 2. When I act my filter, the XY plot view and a new 3D
view appear. However the XY plot is empty, as is the 3D view. I can
get something to appear in the 3D view by adding a glyph to the
pipeline (and the result makes sense), but nothing I do seems to get
it the XY plot view to actually plot.

I have included the RequestData portion of my filter at the end of the
message as well as the information tab of the object inspector of the
filter. Everything looks normal to me (except I am not sure why the
number of cells is less than the number of points?). Can anyone see
the problem? Is there something more I need to do? I've already done a
lot of searching of the archives, playing around with the parameters,
and reading the vtk documentation but haven't found the bug or the
missing call.

The information tab of the object inspector displays:
Type: Rectilinear Grid
Number of Cells: 1000
Number of Points: 1001
Data Arrays:
Name  | Data Type | Data Ranges
data values | int | [0,1e+06]
Extents
X Extent: 0 to 1000 (dimension: 1001)
Y Extent: 0 to 0 (dimension: 1)
Z Extent: 0 to 0 (dimension: 1)
Bounds
X range: 0 to 1e+03
Y range: 0 to 0
Z range 0 to 0

And my request data method is:
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
int vtkMassFunctionFilter::RequestData(vtkInformation*,
                                vtkInformationVector** inputVector,
                                vtkInformationVector* outputVector)
 {
 // Get input and output data.
 vtkPointSet* input = vtkPointSet::GetData(inputVector[0]);
 vtkRectilinearGrid* output = vtkRectilinearGrid::GetData(outputVector);
 // Setting the dimensions of this to be equal to our number of points,
 // in X, and equal to 1 in the Y and Z directions,
 // as these are dummy arrays.
 output->SetDimensions(input->GetPoints()->GetNumberOfPoints(),1,1);
   output->SetWholeExtent(0,input->GetPoints()->GetNumberOfPoints(),\
                                           0,0,\
                                           0,0);
 // Allocate the arrays for the X,Y, and Z coordinates, and inserts a
 // single value for the dummy arrays, as well as allocate the array
 // for the scalar data
 vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray> XArray=vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>::New();
   XArray->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
   XArray->SetNumberOfTuples(input->GetPoints()->GetNumberOfPoints());
 vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>
DummyYArray=vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>::New();
   DummyYArray->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
   DummyYArray->SetNumberOfTuples(1);
   DummyYArray->InsertValue(0,0);
 vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>
DummyZArray=vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>::New();
   DummyZArray->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
   DummyZArray->SetNumberOfTuples(1);
   DummyZArray->InsertValue(0,0);
 vtkSmartPointer<vtkIntArray> dataValues=vtkSmartPointer<vtkIntArray>::New();
   dataValues->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
   dataValues->SetNumberOfTuples(input->GetPoints()->GetNumberOfPoints());
   dataValues->SetName("data values");
 for(int nextPointId = 0;\
      nextPointId < input->GetPoints()->GetNumberOfPoints();\
       ++nextPointId)
   {
   XArray->InsertValue(nextPointId,nextPointId);
   dataValues->InsertValue(nextPointId,pow(nextPointId,2));
   }
 // Updating the output
 output->SetXCoordinates(XArray);
 output->SetYCoordinates(DummyYArray);
 output->SetZCoordinates(DummyZArray);
 output->GetPointData()->SetScalars(dataValues);
 return 1;
 }

Since you simply want to plot the data_values from your rectilinear
grid, try applying the "Plot Data" filter instead. Does that work?

Hi Utkarsh,

Yes that works but I actually want to do more complicated things than
just plot the data values, so first am doing something simple to make
sure I have the plotting setup for the filter correct.

Cheers,
Christine

I am not sure what you mean by "plotting setup for the filter". Is
this filter supposed to produce data that can plotted directly? In
that case you might want to simply create a vtkTableAlgorithm
subclassand produce vtkTable (instead of vtkRectilinearGrid) that has
data rows/columns which can easily be plotted by ParaView. vtkTable is
also easier to deal with since you don't have to worry about
structured extents.

By "plotting setup" I mean that I first want to make a filter which
plots X vs. Y for a very simple case, so that when I try to make the
filter do something more complicated I don't have to worry about basic
bugs/conceptual issues (e.g. if I have a wrong understanding about
structured extents or which algorithm to derive from to automatically
create a plot in the XY view of my desired variables after execution
of a filter).

Thanks for the vtkTable idea, it does seem I may have the wrong idea
about which type of data to produce, I had read a number of posts on
the mailing list that said that the way to get ParaView to
automatically plot the results from a filter in the XY view was to
produce vtkRectilinearGrid. I will try vtkTable and see if it is
suitable. In the meantime if anyone can help with the
vtkRectilinearGrid simple XY plot example, it may come in handy if
vtkTable is not suitable, for others, or for the next time I work with
vtkRectilinearGrid.

Cheers,
Christine

Ah, I didn't know that the automatic plotting of vtkRectilinear data
output from a filter was done with the "Plot over line" filter. So do
you know of a way to fix the problem? I had also tried a sample filter
with both x and y coordinate values, one with higher dimensions of the
dummy coordinate arrays, and neither of these things worked.

There are a number of other messages of people trying to do this, and
some claiming to have succeeded with similar approaches
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-March/007491.html
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-April/007870.html
etc.

Lester,

Sorry for the late reply.

I was able to load your attached dataset without any issues with the
following property values for the TableToStructuredGrid filter:

Whole Extent (0, 140), (0, 151), (0, 2)
X Column: X
Y Column: Y
Z Column: Z

Opps, I made a typo :).

Here are the filter parameters again:

Whole Extent (0, 149), (0, 151), (0, 2)
X Column: X

The "Plot Over Line" filter isn't working for your dataset since you
are producing a data with 0 width and 0 height. So when it tries to
probe with the line, it's failing since the points on the line never
falls within any cells.

Christine,

You are referring to obsolete emails and hence the confusion :).

In the current ParaView (3.6 onwards), the dataset that's used for
plotting is vtkTable (not vtkRectilinearGrid). ParaView provides "Plot
Data" filter which allows the user to plot any other dataset type i.e.
plot the cell/point data arrays for any data type.

"Plot Over Line" filter is a special filter that probes the cell/point
values at the point locations along a sampling line and then plots the
values obtained. Sorry, I misread your original email. I thought you
were using the plot over line filter for the XY-Plot. Now I realize
that you were just trying to show your vtkRecilinearGrid directly in
the XY-Plot view. You didn't see anything since rectilinear grid is
not plot-able by default, so you wouldn't have been able to turn on
the visibility of the grid in the view as well (you have apply the
"Plot Data" filter). There's no automatic plotting for
vtkRectilinearGrid anymore.

Hope that clears up some of the confusion.

Subject: [Paraview] Hanging nodes, celltypes and BC?
Message-ID: <SNT108-W84C419C237B9B7035803CF7CE0@phx.gbl>



Hello!
 
I?m new at Paraview and have just done the exercises in ?VTK File Format?. (http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf). Are those figures which are shown the only cell types defined in Paraview or does it exist others? Maybe I can define and write one myself?
 
I also wonder if I can use hanging nodes in Paraview? For example: I just define two more points on the cube in the first example between two already existing points and them connect them to each other but I will still keep it as a volume but with 7 surfaces instead of 6. Is that possible? Because for me it becomes a surface?
 
Then one last question. Can you write your boundary conditions into a xml-file?
 
Kind regards,
Carina

If I convert a Fluent mesh with hanging nodes it represents cells with hanging 
nodes as a vtkConvexPointSet. This is using the EnSight Gold format however, I 
have no idea how this case is handled in native VTK files.

Hi,

Thanks for your suggestion to use vtkTable/vtkTableAlgorithm instead,
it worked great. As a bonus, my new example filter is just a few lines
and it's much clearer.

The only problem I have now is that the XY plot only appears with a
bit more effort on the user's part. When I execute my vtkTable
producing filter, a 3D view appears (empty unless I add a glyph) and
an XY plot only appears after I add the "plot data" filter to the end
of the pipeline.

I would like a plot to appear in XY view to appear automatically after
the execution of my filter with my desired variables plotted, with my
desired axis labels (or, even better display multiple plots in the
comparative XY plot view automatically). Do I need to output something
other than vtkTable from my filter? Create a custom view? Or something
simpler?

Thanks,
Christine

Subject: [Paraview] Populating GUI elements in custom reader
Message-ID: <4ACB04B8.90908@tp1.rub.de>

Hello,

I have a custom reader, which displays some information in the GUI, like
the domain it is going to extract.
The question is, how can I populate these elements with sensible 
information,
which is not known before RequestInformation (like the domain sizes)?

Thorsten

Hi Thorsten,

Take a look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_an_object_panel

For another example that comes along with the necessary changes in
CMakeLists.txt take a look at a recent thread, in particular at the
attachment in
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013874.html

Just make sure you change line 85 of the CMakeLists.txt in the tarball
like this

-     XML_NAME FooReader # name of SourceProxy in FooReaderSM.xml
+     XML_NAME FooSeriesReader # name of SourceProxy in FooReaderSM.xml

You can create any Qt widget you like and manipulate widgets
automatically created by PV based on your reader'S XML file, but you
have to code it manually in C++, which can be tedious for starters. As
far as I know there is no way of designing your panel using Qt designer,
save a *.ui file and let Qt's moc convert it into source code.

Karl

Look at the Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml and in there
look at filters like "ExtractSelectionOverTime".

All you need is a hint as follows:
<Hints>
        <!-- View can be used to specify the preferred view for the proxy -->
        <View type="XYPlotView" />

        <!-- Temporary hint to allow the output of this filter to be
plotted -->
        <Plotable />
 </Hints>

Hi all,

am trying to utilize some desktops in our lab (say "lab A") to visualize
some virtual heart.
on top of that, there are also some unused desktop from other lab ("lab B")
which i plan to add in as the server.
below are my "hostfile" used during mpirun.

192.168.0.10 slots=4 max-slots=4
192.168.0.220 slots=2 max-slots=2
192.168.0.205 slots=2 max-slots=2
192.168.0.249 slots=2 max-slots=2
202.185.77.219 slots=2 max-slots=2
202.185.77.220 slots=2 max-slots=2
202.185.77.221 slots=2 max-slots=2

as we can see, the 192.168... series are from lab A and the 202.185.. series
are from lab B.
the experiment started off fine as i'm also using a desktop from lab A
(192.168.. series) to connect to the server.
when we reach np 11, the paraview (pvclient) fails to response when we try
to establish a connection with the server.

are we missing out anything here?

appreciate all your response and answer in advance

Thanks

Use "Save Data".  It is the icon right next to "Open" on the toolbar.  It is also under the File menu.

I count 10 cores in the 192.168 domain.  My suspicion is that MPI is having a problem when running with more than 10 processes and therefore having to run on nodes in both 192.168 and 202.185.

My advice is to first make sure that you can run any MPI job across all the nodes in your makeshift cluster.  Do this using a test MPI program that is simpler than pvserver.  Most MPI implementations come with a set of tests.  If you can't find any on your system, there are many available for download; here is a good site: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/mpi-test/tsuite.html

By the way, are you really running a program called pvclient?  There has been no such executable since ParaView 2.6, which was released 2 years ago.  If that is the case, I recommend updated to the latest version of ParaView.

Hi all, 

 

thanks for the reply below.

 

my friend and i each run parallel rendering using our own notebook as client, but we use the same data, same servers and same version of ParaView, CMake, QT, MPI. We use same settings and did the same thing, however our timer log results are a little bit different.

My question are:

 

my local process has Execute vtkMPIMoveData, but my friend's doesn't, why?

my process 0 has Dataserver gathering to 0, Dataserver sending to client, but my friend's doesn't, why?

my process 1,2,3 has Dataserver gathering to 0, but my friend's doesn't, why?

 

Appreciate your reply, thanks!

I counted more than one question (six in fact) in that last email. :)



does these mean that, at the client's end, it took 3.029 seconds to renders the geometry send back from process 0?


I believe the 3.029 seconds includes the transfer time, but I may be incorrect on that. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.
 


what does still render means? 

While you drag the mouse and move the camera paraview does interactive renders. Iteractive renders will (depending on data and the preference settings) use subsampled geometry and subsampled images. Once you release the mouse, ParaView does a still render at full resolution.

 

how about the third line? after still render, why does the MPI need to move data? 

See answer to question 1, the MPI time (and processing) is being counted as part of the rendering. Since it is "part of" the rendering, it shows up after in the log (even if it happened first).

Subject: [Paraview] Current state of LiveData
Message-ID: <4ACC8AAA.50604@am.uni-erlangen.de>

Hi,

we have own reader implemented which I want to extend for live data.

I found the comment from 2008 that support for live data ist was planned.

What is the current state, what do I have to do to implement live data
by myself?

I plan to read my data by myself via a thread (a good idea) and then
signal
the new data to paraview.

The key question is, how to signal this to paraview?

Thanks a lot,

Fabian

P.S.: It's kind of urgent :(

The only reason why the two systems should give different results is if they are loading different data or the settings do not match up, which you claim is not the case.  If you want to ensure that the settings are the same, you can launch ParaView with the -dr flag, which will ignore your settings file and use all the default settings.

The decision for using parallel rendering or to transfer data to the client is made in vtkSMMultiProcessRenderView::GetCompositingDecision(), which is called on the client.  If you really want to find out what is going on, you can set a breakpoint there and see what the decision is and how ParaView came about it.

I counted more than one question (six in fact) in that last email. :)
does these mean that, at the client's end, it took 3.029 seconds to renders the geometry send back from process 0?

I believe the 3.029 seconds includes the transfer time, but I may be incorrect on that. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.

what does still render means?

While you drag the mouse and move the camera paraview does interactive renders. Iteractive renders will (depending on data and the preference settings) use subsampled geometry and subsampled images. Once you release the mouse, ParaView does a still render at full resolution.

VTK is demand driven and lazily evaluated. This means three things
have to happen for in-situ vis to work.

1) You have to recognize when data is available and complete, and you
need some sort of atomicity guarantee. Ie, you don't want a reader
trying to read a half written file, and you don't want the some
process modifying the file while the reader is halfway through reading
it.

2) The reader has to be marked Modified() when there is something new
to read. Otherwise the downstream pipeline won't know that what it
last produced isn't up-to-date, and won't call RequestData() on it.

3) The downstream end (mapper/renderwindow/view/writer or whatever)
has to be told to Update()/Render() so that the reader's new results
show up.

Subject: [Paraview] Issue with PV 3.7 python bindings: bug or feature?
Message-ID: <966089577@web.de>

Hi,

in short:
When using the 'label' keyword in server manager XML and its value contains parentheses, the according object is missing in python. Is this a bug or a feature?

longer version including recipe:
Consider ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/Writer, replace its CMakeLists.txt with the version attached such that cmake does not complain any more if the plugin is built standalone against a PV build using CVS version as of last night and give one of the *VectorProperty tags a label, extend e.g.:

      <IntVectorProperty name="Compression"
                         command="SetCompression"
                         number_of_elements="1"
                         default_values="1">

to

      <IntVectorProperty name="Compression"
                         command="SetCompression"
                         number_of_elements="1"
                         default_values="1"
                         label="Compression (foo is advised)">

compile, invoke pvpython and run the following:
>>> from paraview.simple import *; paraview.servermanager.LoadPlugin("./libMyTiffWriter.so"); connection = servermanager.Connect(); dir(servermanager.writers.MyTIFFWriter)

If the label contains parentheses, the list generated by 'dir(servermanager.writers.MyTIFFWriter)' will be one item short: there is no "Compression" any more.
Is this a known restriction to the use of 'label' in server manager XML?

Thanks
Karl

Hi Ken,

Thanks for the swift reply, and for the reminder.
forgot to try out the mpirun before trying it out in pvserver.
tried a very simple "hello world" mpi job today. (to no avail)

at first, i thought it was because of the difference of 192 and 202 domain
which causes the pause, then i applied hamachi (vpn tool) to all the nodes,
giving them a uniform LAN domain IPs, but still the pauses happens when
reaching np > 10.

that all boils down to my openmpi build? but i am able to run >10 nps
pvserver with the same openmpi build when having the nodes when in a LAN
environment (not using hamachi)..

no worries, i'm using the cvs version of the paraview build. (it states
"paraview 3.7 development" at the title window)


thanks again for all your advice in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Issue with PV 3.7 python bindings: bug or feature?
In-Reply-To: <966089577@web.de>
References: <966089577@web.de>
Message-ID: <2c86953b0910071117x24a173f7o80df8b5849b7dcaa@mail.gmail.com>

In recent versions, paraview uses the xml label attribute as the
property name in python.  It converts the label string to a valid
python identifier by calling paraview.make_new_valid(str).  The
problem is that make_name_valid returns None for names with
parentheses.  When None is detected the property is not added to the
module's dictionary.  The property is still there, you can access it
by calling writer_instance.GetProperty("Compression").

I could correct make_name_valid so that it handles strings with
parentheses instead of returning None.  Then the property would show
up in dir() as Compressionfooisadvised.  Another option is to fallback
to using the xml name attribute when it appears that the label
attribute is not a good candidate (decided if the label contains
parentheses or not).  The latter option might be better for your
situation, but maybe there is a good reason for always using the label
attribute.  Either of the fixes are easy to make.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems using Paraview 3.6.1 on a linux cluster
Message-ID: <KR6S87$E316F8438956D7D70E45A942E3FA10EE@libero.it>

Good morning,
I have two big problems using paraview 3.6.1 on a cluster with Debian operative system.
I hope you'll help me!

1)
- I start the pvserver on the master node of the cluster with the command:

mpirun -np 64 -machinefile /home/utente/ParaView/ListaNodi /home/utente/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

- I start the paraview on the client

- I establish the connection between client ad server

then, when I try to open a file, I always obtain this error:

vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x265b060): Server Connection Closed!

[nodo1:07134] *** Process received signal ***
[nodo1:07134] Signal: Segmentation fault (11)
[nodo1:07134] Signal code:  (128)
[nodo1:07134] Failing at address: (nil)
[nodo1:07134] [ 0] /lib/libpthread.so.0 [0x7f84c6f9ea80]
[nodo1:07134] [ 1] /usr/lib/libGL.so.1(glBlendFuncSeparateEXT+0x16) [0x7f84c86732e6]
[nodo1:07134] *** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


2) When I try to execute some tests with the command:

ctest -I ,,10

I obtain too many errors in the log file (you can see in attach), for example:

/home/utente/ParaView-bin/bin/QVTKCxxTests: error while loading shared libraries: libQVTK.so.pv3.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

but the file libQVTK.so.pv3.6 (and the others lib*) is in the directory

/home/utente/ParaView-bin/bin

Could you please help me?
Thank you in advance!

Paolo

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0910080606h612e455cn8c2c2fe3d0211b3f@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to "screen capture" a video sequence of the user interaction?
Sometimes rather than specifying a camera path, etc for creating an
animation it would be nice to simply click "record" and then move the scene
around and save exactly that interaction as a video (with an option of
whether or not to include the cursor in the video).

Is something like this possible/feasible?

Thanks,

David

There are some others but they are variations of the quadratic cells
described in the document. I am not sure if that will satisfy your
need. You can define new ones by writing C++ code - the way all cells
are defined in VTK. If you want to go down this path, I would suggest
getting the VTK user's guide and read up on VTK development.

As someone else mentioned, you can use a convex point set (a poor
man's polyhedra) to do this. Some things will not work well though. We
have plans to add polyhedra support but not a definite timeline for
it.

No. You should look into the Exodus II file format. It allows for
boundary sets and such.

This sort of thing happens when a 3rd party library (I guess the
Fortran library in this case) is linked against a different C library
than ParaView is linking against. In this case, one of the is using
libcmt.lib and the other one is msvcrt.lib. There are linker flags
that control which one you use but this is where my knowledge of
Windows linking ends :-)

Which OpenGL and MPI are you using? Does this happen when running
locally and/or when running 1 server node?

Are you running from the build tree or did you do a make install? If
you did a make install, did you compile with VTK_USE_RPATH ON or OFF?
This probably has something to do with not having rpath and not
setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

This is something best done with an external tool. There are many
tools to capture video of the screen out there.

Subject: [Paraview] issues with Slice filter and interpolation...
Message-ID: <4ACE0EEF.8040103@gmail.com>

Hi all,

The following snapshots:

http://ktools.free.fr/slice_xOy.png
http://ktools.free.fr/slice_xOz.png
http://ktools.free.fr/slice_yOz.png

show the issue I get when I choose Style -> Interpolation -> Flat on
the "well known" exemple file heart.vtk.

Grid is 32x32x12 with mesh 1x1x4.

Only yOz slice plane is right, both xOy slice and xOz slice are wrong
ie for the latter, cells are somewhat "sheared".

Why?

Please note that all origin planes are (15,15,22) so _at a node of the
grid_.

Any clue?


TIA.


Cheers,

PS : I use PV 3.6.1 on 64 bits debian box.

The slice (cut) filter uses an algorithm that produces triangles (same
as the contour filter). That is the effect you are seeing. It is an
effect that is strong when cutting small meshes.

Ok, but why I can see triangles on xOz and on xOy and not on yOz slice ??

I whould get the same result on xOy & xOz I get on yOz.

Try setting the representation of the cut to Surface with Edges.
You'll see what I mean.

Subject: [Paraview] Segfault on exit()/quit()/raise SystemExit in python
	script
Message-ID: <4ACE678F.8080309@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi,

When loading test data set can.ex2 into ParaView 3.7 (CVS as of today)
or ParaView 3.6.1 compiled myself from the official source tarball, not
altering any setting, saving a state file, loading this state file in a
python script and finally exiting this python script with either
a) quit()
b) raise SystemExit
c) exit()
a pvpython built with OpenGL segfaults. Script is attached.

Use "exit" instead and it does not segfault.
Don't load a state file, but directly load can.ex2 and it does not crash
(see N.B.)
Use official binary release of ParaView 3.6.1 and it does not segfault.

A pvpython built with Mesa 7.5.1 does not segfault, for either case.

Can anyone confirm this? Or am I simply triggering somehow a bug in my
GL driver?

I'll add the state file for completeness, but any state file should do.
gdb backtrace attached, too.

Sven


N.B.:
At first, I thought it might be related to
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=6645, but adding one of the exit
commands a)-c) to the script t6.py attached there, does not cause a
segfault.

I've already had this problem when linking Fortran programs against HDF5
library...

In Visual Studio, there's an "Ignore Specific Library" option (Linker/Input
in project settings tab) where I've set MSVCRT to solve it.

Regards

Renato.

- We are trying to use ParaView on a cluster without GPUs, so that we had to install OSMesa library (version 7.0.3-7) as explained here:

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#X_Connections

- Open MPI 1.2.7rc2



>Does this happen when running locally

No, it doesn't.
I tried to run the client and the server on my computer and it works.

> when running 1 server node?

Yes, it does. I tried to run the client and the server on the master node of the cluster: the error occurs when we push the button "apply"
(after establishing the connection between client and server and after loading a file)

We run the test in the /home/utente/ParaView-bin directory.
We did make install.

VTK_USE_RPATH = OFF (default, I believe)

How LD_LIBRARY_PATH has to be set? On each node?
Have we to install rpath on each node of the cluster?

If you need more information, please let me know.
Than you very much

Try to extend LD_LIBRARY_PATH on each node (prior to invoking one of the
paraview binaries) with

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/utente/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
(Bourne and Korn shell syntax, see man pages for C shell syntax)

Now the percentage of passed test has increased from 8% to about 31%, but we still have other errors such as:

Qt: Session management error: Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed

and many segmentation fault, for instance:

81 - TestClipHyperOctree (SEGFAULT)

the log is:

Also, we still have the problem when we use the pvserver on our cluster and connect from a client (we wrote you yesterday, on 8th October 2009)

We hope you'll help us.

Message-ID: <82719CF4D95FBE4FA20C49581A8525AE0295EA43@hrfmail01.barf1.com>

Hi,

 

I've been trying to compile the VTKEdge Paraview plugin on windows using
VC++ 2005 Express. However, I don't seem to be getting the VTKEdge.dll
appearing in my bin dir after install.

It does appear in a release dir which appears in the bin due to the
visual studio compilation, but if I try to link to this in Paraview, I
get an error stating that it is not a valid Qt plugin. 

I have successfully installed the same source on linux, with no issues,
but I have very little experience of windows compilations. I've attached
my CMakeCache.txt in case there's something I might be missing.

 

Can anyone help?

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Lucy

Hi,

In the meantime I found out that the segfault only happens when pvpython is
being run inside a NX session (see http://www.nomachine.com/). So, most likely
there is nothing wrong with ParaView, I simply need an additional installation
compiled with Mesa instead of OpenGL, to be used in NX sessions.

It sounds like X is not running? Or DISPLAY is not set?

Hi Lucy,

Note: Utkarsh, who wrote all of the ParaView plugins in VTKEdge, is on
vacation for 3 weeks. It is unlikely that you will get a response from him
until he is back.

I don't have a lot of experience with Windows either. Are you sure the Qt
version and the compiler you are using are matching the one ParaView was
compiled with? This has been one of the major source of compatibility issues
in the past.

Hi Berk,

 

Thanks for your reply, 

 

This is a fresh install with neither Qt nor PV having been previously
installed on the system, so I'm fairly sure there are no conflicts. I
compiled 3.6.1 using VC++ just prior to starting the VTKEdge
compilation, with the same CMake version and Qt libraries.

 

Thanks,

 

Lucy

Hi,

 

I've been trying to compile the VTKEdge Paraview plugin on windows using
VC++ 2005 Express. However, I don't seem to be getting the VTKEdge.dll
appearing in my bin dir after install.

It does appear in a release dir which appears in the bin due to the
visual studio compilation, but if I try to link to this in Paraview, I
get an error stating that it is not a valid Qt plugin. 

I have successfully installed the same source on linux, with no issues,
but I have very little experience of windows compilations. I've attached
my CMakeCache.txt in case there's something I might be missing.

 

Can anyone help?

 

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] Plot multiple points over time
Message-ID: <DF7F8794-772A-45ED-8C4D-952D98AA7E5A@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I saw in the old 3.4 release notes that "* Added support for plotting  
multiple point/cell values over time.", but I think I might be  
confused about what that means...

With CVS PV if I select multiple points (say, by Global ID) in my set  
of unstructured points, and then do Plot Selection Over Time, I can  
choose multiple "Line Series", or variables, to show simultaneously on  
the same XY Plot, but each of the points from my data set shows up as  
a separate checkable entry under the Root level within the Select  
Block list, and I can't seem to select more than one "point" to plot  
over time.

Am I misunderstanding the "plotting multiple point values over time"  
statement, or is there a way to plot the attributes of multiple points  
from my data set over time (so I could compare them on the same plot,  
rather than having to switch back and forth between individual points)  
that I'm not seeing?

Thanks for the help,
-Eric

Your X is going over ssh back to the machine you connected from. If X
is running on the server, try setting DISPLAY to :0 (making sure that
xauth stuff is setup properly) and run again.

Subject: [Paraview] Descriptive statistics over time?
Message-ID: <AACE7D63-6291-4D31-9B30-41707BE18EA1@cs.duke.edu>

Hello again,

I love all the new statistics additions to PV, but I was wondering if  
there is a way to plot the computed values over time? Say I calculate  
the mean value of some data attribute using Descriptive Statistics, is  
there a way of plotting this value over time? It looks like Plot Data  
is the only choice for Table types.

I was able to do this in a roundabout way, by applying the Table to  
Points filter, and then plotting a selection from this over time, but  
since "variables of interest" get translated into points, it's too  
difficult to keep track of which points are which variables...

Thanks,
-Eric

I just opened up a case file that has about 500 steps in it.  I went to step 101, and it worked fine.

I assume that CTH AMR isn't what you are looking for.

Hi ParaViewers:

    Does anybody has a shareable rectilinear CTH dataset for test purposes?

    Thanks.

I recently ran into this using CVS of a couple weeks to a month or so 
ago. It had to do with state files. When loading from state file a time 
series with more than 100 steps the spin box in the ui would only go up 
to 99. The animation inspector could be used to select any step though. 
Maybe it's fixed since then?

Subject: [Paraview] New feature- python save state
Message-ID: <2c86953b0910091341r2b40abeflc4b8cff8fb8cb700@mail.gmail.com>

A new feature is available- save state as a python script.  It is
still under development but it can be found in cvs.

The feature is available in the Trace tab of the python shell.  Click
the button 'Trace State' to grab the state, then click 'Save Trace' to
save it.  Then you can go to the Directory View tab, select the
script, and click 'Run Selected'.  If you find a way to build a
pipeline that isn't captured correctly by save state, let me know!
Usually it's an error in the way servermanager wraps a property.


It even kind of works for chart views but there are a few bugs that
must be hand corrected, for example:

chart_rep.AttributeType = 'Point Data'
   must be changed to
chart_rep.AttributeType = 0

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch: Manipulate file list of loaded state file
Message-ID: <4AD2381A.4000706@web.de>

Hi,

I've been trying to no avail for many hours now to do something that
sounds quite simple to do, but seems to be not yet documented in the PV
wiki, the tutorials, PV presentation slides nor the mailing list.
I hope someone can give me a hint what I'm doing wrong.

The thing I'm trying to do is a variant of what Kent posted 1,5 year ago
about and Utkarsh gave advice on
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-February/007134.html):

1) Load a single file from a file series, not a file series, create a
pipeline and save a state file.

2) Let pvbatch load the state file, swap the file for a file list
(determined via glob, see e.g. page 7 of
http://www.cscs.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/users_entry_point/HORUS_Doc/PvPython.pdf)
and iterate over all files

I've successfully loaded the state file and manipulated the source
proxy's FileName property, extracted the scene object by means of
servermanager.ProxyManager, updated the animation scene's TimeKeeper
object and then repeatedly called scene.GoToNext(). But the new file
list got not respected, still only the file mentioned in the state file
gets loaded.

I've also tried to create a new reader instance with the file list as
argument, looped over all source proxies within the state file and
changed their Input property in case that were a reader. Then, created a
new animation scene in the same way as AnimateReader does it in
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py and tried again to
loop over all files. Still not working.
Saving the state file from pvbatch and loading it into ParaView
confirmed that I'm missing something as ParaView spits out quite some
error messages for those objects I swapped the input for:
"Input port 0 of algorithm vtkExtractBlock has 0 connections but is not
optional."

Is there someone who accomplished loading a state file and manipulating
the reader's file list and is willing to share his knowledge?

Thanks a lot
Karl


N.B.:
If there is a solution to this problem, it could also pose an
approximate alternative solution for those looking for support for live
data in PV, an issue discussed just recently here: By means of a timer,
file size or file inspection it would be easy enough to have Python
ensure the validity of an input fill, then re-execute the pipeline for
the new file, create a snapshot automatically and wait for the next file
to appear.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems using Paraview 3.6.1 on a linux cluster
Message-ID: <KRE5KR$68E390B37827BA5BCE5048EE09AD35A3@libero.it>


> Your X is going over ssh back to the machine you connected from. If X

If we set DISPLAY to :0, we can't run paraview (the error is: "No protocol specified. paraview-real: cannot connect to X server :0"); can you explain how set xauth stuff?

Moreover we noticed two things on our cluster:

1) the usual error "/ParaView/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x100ffb0): Server Connection Closed!" happens when we push the button "apply" or when try to change the surface ("points", "wireframe",etc...) after loading a file in ensight format; if instead we load a file in STL format, Paraview works...
Instead on my local machine Paraview always works; but on my local machine the percentage of passed test is about 66% and on our cluster is about 33%...

2) when we start pvserver on the cluster with the command:

mpirun -np 64 -machinefile /home/utente/ParaView/ListaNodi /home/utente/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

each "pvserver-real" process keeps 100% - 101% of cpu on each node (even if the client isn't connect to the server): isn't it strange?

 
> Also, this page may be useful:

We already red this page and we followed the instructions in case of cluster without GPU.

Thank you again.

Thanks for the information!
I'm working along this guideline, there are several problems I'm fighting
with but this seems exactly to be the information I needed.

Subject: [Paraview] Dual-headed output from a single GPU?
Message-ID: <4AD32888.1050103@sara.nl>

Hi,

I'm trying to get paraview to handle rendering on a single GPU with
dual-monitor outputs. These outputs are run using different X screens on
the same X server. Using xinerama is not an option as this is a
preliminary test setup for driving a TPD using nodes that each drive 2
displays and the mullions can't be handled correctly with xinerama. The
goal is to run Paraview as described in
https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/Paraview_Tiled-Display_Mode.

The problem I have is to get multiple pvservers to run on the same host.
I'm basically following the procedure outlined in "Multiple GPUs Per
Node" on http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server. The
-bynode mpirun line (supported by OpenMPI) works, but it leads to the
different pvserver processes trying to listen on port 11111:

paulm at sara0143:/scratch/paulm/paraview-3.6.1-Linux-i686/bin$ mpirun
-bynode -np 1 ./pvserver -display :0.0 : -np 1 ./pvserver -display :0.1
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Listen on port: 11111
ERROR: In
/home/kitware/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx,
line 193
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x8216f60): Failed to set up server
socket.

As far as I understand it this port (11111) is the "combined server"
port that the client connects to, but the connections among different
pvservers will use different (arbitrary) ports. So it seems two
pvservers want to play the role of combined server entry point in my
case. The mpirun line above is very similar to the one shown in the
Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server wiki page:

mpirun -bynode -np 8 ./pvserver -display :0.0 : -np 8 ./pvserver
-display :0.1

Is there some information missing on that page that is needed to get
this specific setup to work? I.e. something in an MPI hosts file?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

You shouldn't have to do anything special. I am not an OpenMPI expert
so I can't speak to the MPI configurations. When you run pvserver with
MPI, only the first node will listen to the server port. The others
should wait for the first node in an MPI receive call. The fact that
both servers are trying to listen to that port tells me that either
ParaView is not compile with MPI or there is something wrong with the
way you are using mpirun. To verify which one is the case, try mpirun
-np 2 ./pvserver. If they are both trying to grab port 11111, ParaView
is not compiled with MPI. Otherwise, something is wrong with the MPI
line you are using.

Best,
-berk

Ah, interesting detail :) 
I grabbed the precompiled version from paraview.org but now see that it
doesn't include MPI support. I'll build my own version and report back
here...

Thanks!

Yeah, unfortunately it is hard for us to provide binaries with MPI
support because MPI is implemented with different (internal) APIs by
different vendors. We would have to create a different binary for each
MPI distribution.

The code can be found here:

Please take a look and let me know what you think/if it can be added to vtk
and paraview.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <001e01ca4b51$56823b10$0386b130$@Kaufmann@Haw-Hamburg.de>

Hello list,

I am from the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg and new to the list. We
have a three wall stereo projection environment and we want to display CFD
contend with ParaView 3.6.1.

I read that ParaView 3 didn't supported CAVE environments in early phases of
Version 3. Is this problem already solved?

If not can anyone point me out a solution? If yes can anyone give me step by
step instructions?

Thank you!

Steffen

Thanks to David's help I come to a certain extend to an extension of my
reader to do live updates.

Background:

I want to to in-situ optimization, on request the optimization shall be
restarted with new parameters and I want to see the most current result.

The optimization results are interpreted as a FEM time series where an
interation is expressed by a time step.

* I start reading a time series (0...100)
  and give this back by RequestInformation.

* Assume the users sees time step 2

* No I start new optimization and my reader thread.
 - The thread within my reader reads the current iteration data.
 - I want to force Paraview to display the most current data.
 - The actual time step number/ value displayed within paraview is
   irrelevant for me as long as the image is ok.

* My thread calls Modified() and after that Update()
  - This leads to a call of RequestInformation() and RequestData().
  - Here I'm lost: I tried several things but nothing is repainted.
  - When I increase the timestep in the visualization with the mouse,
    the data returned by the last RequestData() is displayed.

But how can i force Paraview to display the new data after RequestData
without my mouse interaction?

Shall I return a different time range within RequestInformation() ?

I'm working on this for two days now - having no progress but I'm sure
it is easy ... * please help ! * :))

Subject: [Paraview] remove libvtkhdf5.so for compilation
Message-ID: <5f395e810910120939o275aa3ccub0f230f1f48a3b59@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am developing a Paraview reader plugin for a hdf file format. I want to
use the hdf5 1.8 c library. I configure my CMakeList.txt to build the plugin
in static for hdf.
But when I build Paraview, my plugin is linked with libvtkhdf5.so. And this
lib is developed on hdf5 1.6
So, when I execute Paraview I have this warning message :

" Warning! The HDF5 header files included by this application do not match
the
version used by the HDF5 library to which this application is linked. Data
corruption or segmentation faults may occur if the application is
allowed to continue.  You can, at your own risk, disable this check by
setting
the environment variable 'HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK' to a value of '1'.
Setting it to 2 will suppress the warning totally.
Headers are 1.8.3, library is 1.6.5 "

What should I do in my CMakeList.txt to remove the link to libvtkhdf5.so
when compiling my plugin ?

Thanks,

Didier

* Set the HDF5 library and include path so that they point to your build of hdf5

Good luck,

Subject: [Paraview] How to access XMLPUnstructuredGridReader from python?
Message-ID: <4AD36243.90504@gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de>

Dear all,

I'm trying to use the following script to convert some files:

-----

from paraview.simple import *

for index in range(0,159):
     r = XMLPUnstructuredGridReader()   <<---
     w = DataSetWriter()
     w.Input = r
     w.FileType = 'Ascii'
     r.FileName = "elder.%04d.pvtu" % index
     w.FileName = "elder.%04d.vtk" % index
     w.UpdatePipeline()

-----

The same script works fine with 'XMLUnstructuredGridReader' (without the
'P'), but with 'XMLPUnstructuredGridReader' (including the 'P') I get:

NameError: name 'XMLPUnstructuredGridReader' is not defined

Using 'r = servermanager.sources.XMLPUnstructuredGridReader()'

AttributeError: 'PVModule' object has no attribute
'XMLPUnstructuredGridReader'

but 'dir(servermanager.sources)' lists 'XMLPUnstructuredGridReader'.

This is with paraview 3.6.1.

Any hint what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks,
   Michael

Thanks Berk
I have tried with the version 3.6.1 of paraview. And I have a compilation
problem for Xdmf.
So I try with the cvs source as you propose. I'll tell you the result

Is this a flat wall or curved wall? There is still no Cave support in
ParaView but there is definitely tiled-display support.

Hi,

I try to Install OpenFOAM 1.5 under RHEL5
Before installing openfoam 1.5, i installed qt 4.3.4 successfully.
And, I installed OpenFoam 1.5 successfully.

When i tried to compile paraview3.3 using "buildParaView3.3-cvs"
 i got an error that libmpfr.so.1 not found.
Then i installed mpfr libraries from source, so that i avoided that error.
But i got some more error while compiling again, those are:

Message-ID: <974783391@web.de>

Hi,

I'm not sure you're on the right mailing list. Anyway, in order to be able to compile you need at least to install devel packages for libXt. On SuSE systems the package would be xorg-x11-libXt-devel, on Ubuntu systems libxt-dev. Both provide X11/StringDefs.h and X11/Intrinsic.h. Not sure about a Redhat system, though.

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch: Manipulate file list of loaded state file
In-Reply-To: <4AD2381A.4000706@web.de>
Message-ID: <C6F8A618.12202%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Hopefully someone will have answered your question by the time I get off this airplane and sync my email so that this message gets sent, but allow me to suggest an alternative method.  I recommend you try the new Python tracing as an alternative.  To do this, turn on Python tracing (currently attached to the Python shell, but should move soon), load the file, set up the pipeline and any other desired state, and then save the state.  Load the resulting Python shell in your favorite editor and change it to load the files you really want.

This use case of loading state files is really just a workaround to the fact that you could not directly output a Python script from ParaView.  Now that you can automatically create scripts from within ParaView, loading state files from scripts is (mostly) obsolete.

Hi,

I've been trying to no avail for many hours now to do something that
sounds quite simple to do, but seems to be not yet documented in the PV
wiki, the tutorials, PV presentation slides nor the mailing list.
I hope someone can give me a hint what I'm doing wrong.

The thing I'm trying to do is a variant of what Kent posted 1,5 year ago
about and Utkarsh gave advice on
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-February/007134.html):

1) Load a single file from a file series, not a file series, create a
pipeline and save a state file.

2) Let pvbatch load the state file, swap the file for a file list
(determined via glob, see e.g. page 7 of
http://www.cscs.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/users_entry_point/HORUS_Doc/PvPython.pdf)
and iterate over all files

I've successfully loaded the state file and manipulated the source
proxy's FileName property, extracted the scene object by means of
servermanager.ProxyManager, updated the animation scene's TimeKeeper
object and then repeatedly called scene.GoToNext(). But the new file
list got not respected, still only the file mentioned in the state file
gets loaded.

I've also tried to create a new reader instance with the file list as
argument, looped over all source proxies within the state file and
changed their Input property in case that were a reader. Then, created a
new animation scene in the same way as AnimateReader does it in
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py and tried again to
loop over all files. Still not working.
Saving the state file from pvbatch and loading it into ParaView
confirmed that I'm missing something as ParaView spits out quite some
error messages for those objects I swapped the input for:
"Input port 0 of algorithm vtkExtractBlock has 0 connections but is not
optional."

Is there someone who accomplished loading a state file and manipulating
the reader's file list and is willing to share his knowledge?

Thanks a lot
Karl


N.B.:
If there is a solution to this problem, it could also pose an
approximate alternative solution for those looking for support for live
data in PV, an issue discussed just recently here: By means of a timer,
file size or file inspection it would be easy enough to have Python
ensure the validity of an input fill, then re-execute the pipeline for
the new file, create a snapshot automatically and wait for the next file
to appear.

Hi, I ma getting stitching artifacts in screenshots larger than my

Does anyone else have similar problems?

Hello,
I try to compil paraview with the CVS sources.
I made  changes to successfully compile. These changes are :
 - comment the line paraview_build_optional_plugin(H5PartReader "Reader for
*.h5part files" H5PartReader ON) in Plugins/CMakeList.txt because there is
no directory Plugins/H5PartReader;
 - add " include <string.h>" in files :
Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfDataDesc.h and
Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx.

I compile with gcc version 4.3.3 on Ubuntu.


Regards,
Didier

No problem, building paraview isn't really difficult and so I now have
an mpi-enabled version that seems to do the trick.

W.r.t. to scaling my configuration up to a 3x3 TPD, is there a way to
specify the necessary -display and TPD parameters in an mpi host file?
It seems (with OpenMPI) you can only specify the number of slots per
host, but not much more. So that would only leave a long mpirun -bynode
... line to get all the nodes correctly configured.

Subject: [Paraview] Stream Tracer, Save Layout
Message-ID: <SNT108-W6C42C300A6C5588444CBDF7C70@phx.gbl>


Hi!
 
I have opened a figure in Paraview, just defined by surfaces connected together. Let?s say a cube with six surfaces. In the xml file the velocity is defined as PointDataScalars and now I want to create stream traces in the figure. But when I did that with Filters ? Alfabetical ? Stream Tracer, nothing happened. I have tried both with a point source and a line. When I generate vectors with glyphs it?s working, but obvious not with stream tracer. Someone has a clue what I?ve done wrong?
 
Can you save a specific layout in Paraview and then reload another data into it? For example every time I load a update on my figure, the color legend changes and I have to change all the settings again. I also have to insert all the textboxes again, and I find it quite annoying. 
 
Thanks,
Carina

Subject: [Paraview] Please help!! How to force Render() from a reader
Message-ID: <4AD44BA4.7070006@am.uni-erlangen.de>

Dear Kitware experts and users, :)

I'm still fighting with my live data reader and my deadline is
approaching :(

In my vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm derived reader
I implement

RequestInformation()
RequestData()
and
RequestUpdateExtent()

and call Modfied() and Update() from a thread.
Sofar all works, I trigger RequestUpdateExtent() for a valid
time-value not
read up to now. This time value is request by RequestData() and I return
the new data - there is just no rendering.

I have no idea about how to force it.

Thank you very much!

Fabian Wein

Message-ID: <FC17C27D1141BF4C945453BACB1CB1D10237B2AE@GLKMS2100.GREENLNK.NET>

Dear All,
 
Quite simply, I'm using gmsh to generate surface meshes for a CFD
simulation. Gmsh has the wonderful feature of being able to add a
boundary ID flag to a surface or collection of surfaces, this is
essential of setting up a computational problem as I'm sure you all
know.  The idea being that one may collect all the walls together and
give them the flag "WALL" or "1", and then like wise for all other
physical geometry types.  However, gmsh writes out a vtk file for the
mesh only.  Having been in contact with the author of the program, he's
agreed to modify the source and add the boundary condition data to the
vtk mesh file and write all of this out, an amazing contribution, since
this does feature in the open source as a tool chain, i.e read in CAD
file -> mesh -> define boundaries -> write out in standard format (for
all platforms), that I know of at least.  I said I would ask/find out
what new data structure he needs to use/implement, and he would
implement it.
 
Two questions then: 
 
1)  What data structure is available in vtk that can hold a string
(preferably by a long shot) or integer per surface of a polygon?  
2)  Currently I am reading the mesh written by gmsh in vtk format into
paraview, will I be able to (if the above is an option), be able to read
into paraview whatever data structure type you're going to recommend and
crucially see the physical boundary condition flags that I added in gmsh
within paraview?

Many thanks, please ask if you require clarity.
 
Andy

If you really have a simple cube, ie just 8 points conected together, it is possible that stream tracing be impossible because data are too sparse and the streamline are not long enough to be considered as valid. I would suggest trying with a little bit more complex dataset.

Check out the vtkAbstractDataArray class and it's derived types for storing
the information you want.  You can associate any of those arrays with your
data set through vtkFieldData, vtkPointData, or vtkCellData (probably the
one you want).

ParaView will allow you to color your surface mesh using either vtkPointData
arrays or vtkCellData arrays.  You can also look at those values in the
spreadsheet along with vtkFieldData arrays.

Looks OK to me.  I tested at 1920x1024, on screen and off screen, and 7680x4096, off screen.  I was writing png's, using 3.6.1.  No stitching, no error message, no disabled off screen rendering.

Hi Fabian,

I am not sure what you mean by a thread (a client side code?),
but perhaps you can simply write

  pqApplicationCore::instance()->render();

Is this a surface or a volume that you are creating streamlines for?
If it is a surface you probably want to use "streamtracer with a
custom source" and use the surface as the source (either use subdivide
or quadric clustering to increase/reduce the number of streamlines).

I have written some plugins for my own filters where I expose the
filename.  This way I can save a state and then just change the
filename and click apply.  You could create a plugin for an existing
reader in ParaView with just an XML file (although it will need to be
compiled).

Regards,
Paul

I also tested on another PC, with an NVIDIA gfx card and it is OK there.
So the culprit might be my integrated intel gfx chip in my thinkpad x60. 
Still, I expected off-screen rendering to be independent from hardware, 
not so?

Subject: [Paraview] Python Render() has no effect
Message-ID: <4AD4A3C8.8070900@am.uni-erlangen.de>

I'm still struggling with my live data reader.

A thread calls Update() on my algorithm. This leada to a RequestData()
and I give back the current data - independend of the requested time step.

It's just not displayed. I tried with python

Render()
GetRenderView().StillRender()
Show()

all has no effect. How can I do this?

Please help, I invested a week in extending my reader but this single
piece
is missing.

Thanks,

Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] How to invalidate data
Message-ID: <4AD4A89E.6010909@am.uni-erlangen.de>

Dear last resource :)

My last idea to make my live data reader work is to use animation.

Independed on what time value is requested I give back the current data.

I'll need a repeated loop for that - but once the time values are read,
they are cached and not requested again from my reader.

How can this be solved? Do I something wrong?

Thanks a lot,

Fabian

I believe that ParaView uses the graphics card, and the graphics memory for it's off screen rendering.  I also assume this is done in the back buffer of the graphics card's double buffer system, but I am not sure.

Is there a way to accept a (reverse) connection from a remote data server using the paraview modules in a python shell?

The stream tracer filter follows vector fields in 3D space.  Tracing flow on surfaces is problematic because if a position is off the surface, then the stream tracer will not follow it.

The default stream tracer seed points is a cloud of random points centered around some location.  Because the points are picked in 3D space, it is probably picking points off of the surface.  Instead, change the seed points to be on the surface.  Try using the line instead of the point cloud.

You also have to be careful about vectors pointing off of the surface.  Once the stream leaves the surface (which can be immediately), then the stream tracer will stop following the stream.  Make sure the vectors are constrained to be within the surface.  You might be able to constrain the vectors using the Surface Vectors filter.

In the xml file the velocity is defined as PointDataScalars and now I want to create stream traces in the figure. But when I did that with Filters - Alfabetical - Stream Tracer, nothing happened. I have tried both with a point source and a line. When I generate vectors with glyphs it's working, but obvious not with stream tracer. Someone has a clue what I've done wrong?

You could try using lookmarks, which are design to save a portion of the state and then apply that to different input data.  Lookmarks are created by clicking on the lookmark icon in that little bar above the view.

That said, although lookmarks are nice when they work, they tend to be quite inflexible.  Coming soon we are planning to replace the lookmark functionality with a more configurable macro capability that is driven by Python scripting.

Yes, that is exactly the same problem I am experiencing on one computer 
(integrated intel gfx card) but not the other (NVIDIA).

I do not understand why the gfx card would influence offscreen rendering...

It looks like we forgot to add support for reverse connection to the
simple module. The following should work:

from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.ReverseConnect() # this takes an optional port argument

You will also need to do the following if you want animation to work:

servermanager.ProxyManager().RegisterProxy("timekeeper", "tk",
servermanager.misc.TimeKeeper())

That would be the easiest explanation, but then it is not at all 
off-screen rendering or its my wrong understanding about it...

We try to use several offscreen rendering methods on X11. If we still
see an empty screen as a result, we disable offscreen rendering. This
is a common problem with the intel cards. To make sure I understand,
you are not seeing the stitching problem only with the intel cards?
Exact same geometry and everything?

Does this happen only with Mesa? That looks like volume rendering,
does it happen with geometry rendering?

Subject: [Paraview] modifying vtkInformation object to point to new
	vtkDataObject
Message-ID: <d7f4480f0910131238t1d4e27d5v8af278737fd85d29@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to modify a vtkInformation object (specifically one within a
vtkInformation vector) to point to a new data set.

The use case is I have a derived class for which, in its RequestData
method, I want to do some preprocessing on the input, then send the
preprocessed input to the superclass via the superclass' RequestData
method, then post process the output within the derived class. I don't
want to modify the original input so I work with an (in my use case
much smaller) subset of it, but the problem is then passing it on to
the superclass for processing.

Right now I do:
inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0)->Set(
  vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT(),newDataSet).
Before my call to the super's RequestData method, but the superclass
seems not to operate on the newDataSet, nor on the original data set,
so I think I'm inadvertently pummeling something, probably using the
wrong vtkInformationDataObjectKey. However I'm not sure how to divine
the correct one. Any help would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Christine

I only tried mesa because no graphics hardware are present on that 
system. The system is off line today from maintenance, I can see if it 
happens with geometry too when it's back on line.

The opposite, I only have the problem with the intel card on my notebook 
(TP x60, Ubuntu 9.04 32bit), not nVidia GeForce 9600 GT (8x xeon, Ubuntu 
64 bit). In both cases cvs versions, same state file.

In my case no volume rendering is involved, just a blend of surface 
meshes and some wireframes with varying opacities.

Subject: [Paraview] compile completed install fails
Message-ID: <4AD4E7FA.9050906@mail.as.wvu.edu>

I followed all the instructions for compiling, installing ParaView. It 
seemed to compile without error (64-bit Linux), but when I typed "make 
install," I got this error near the end:

[ 88%] Built target QtTesting
[ 89%] Built target pqWidgets
[ 89%] Built target pqWidgetsTest
[ 89%] Built target pqChartTest
[ 92%] Built target pqCore
make[2]: *** No rule to make target 
`Qt/Components/../../../../a/src/ParaView3/Qt/Components/Resources/XML/ParaViewWriters.xml', 
needed by `Qt/Components/qrc_pqExtraResources.cxx'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [Qt/Components/CMakeFiles/pqComponents.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
[root at tron ParaView3-build]#


What did I do wrong? I don't understand this error message. There is a 
ParaViewWriters.xml file on my system, but there is no 
qrc_pqExtraResources.cxx file. Why does the install fail?

Can someone please help?

Steve

Yes, for me the artifacts are gone when using pure surfaces only. Still, 
I need wireframes and surface+edges representations...

You may also have to call servermanager.Disconnect() before calling
servermanager.ReverseConnect().  This is because paraview.simple
creates a builtin connection by default.

I am not sure why it doesn't work but what you are doing is not safe
and is bad practice. The inputVector belongs to the input of this
filter and you should not modify it (other than passing a request
during RequestUpdateExtent). Isn't there another way you can do this?
Maybe having a data member defined in the superclass that you set in
the subclass? Or defining a helper function that you can call from the
subclass with the alternative input and with the regular input from
the superclass' RequestData?

Hi,

Yes, I realize that I shouldn't modify the original input vector.
There are copy methods for both vtkInformationVector and
vtkInformation, so I'm planning to work with a duplicate of the
original, modified only in the data object it holds, to send to the
superclass. Would that scenario also be bad practice?

I'm not sure there is another good way, unless I copy and paste the
superclass' RequestData code into my subclass or modify the
superclass, which I'd also rather not do as the superclass is within
ParaView's main tree.

In any case, I'd like to know more about figuring out which key to use
to access data from the information vector. The get/set methods in
vtkInformation take a key as input. But if I were to create a key,
e.g. using the constructor of vtkInformationDataObjectKey I need both
a name and a location, neither of which I know.

This has no effect. Meanwhile I think this is because of the client/server
structure.

Update within the reader forces RequestUpdateExtent and RequestData
for the new time value - but it is not dispayed in the time GUI next
to the
VCR area.

A reader is a server part, isn't it? I guess I need also a gui part.

Is there a complete code example anywhere?

Hi Berk,

thanks for your reply!

This made me research what a source proxy is (I tried to do it without
python, just with C++) but now it seems that python is the choice.

So far thanks for the direction, details later.

Perhaps you are right in that you need a gui (client) part.
(PV experts: correct me if I am wrong)

>

Here is what I have in the gui (client) part for the "pesudo" live
updating of my time-aware reader (I am using a QTimer for periodically
polling a running case in a simple way). It's sort of brutal
implementation though.

If you are intersted in the full version, have a look at
http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_Parallelized_Native_OpenFOAM_Reader_for_ParaView

  // only update pipeline information (RequestInformation())
  this->Sp->GetProperty("Refresh")->Modified();
  this->Sp->UpdatePipelineInformation();
  this->Sp->UpdatePropertyInformation(); // explicitly pull the property informa
tion

  // get the last timestep
  vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty *tsv
      = vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(this->Sp->GetProperty("TimestepV
alues"));
  if(tsv->GetNumberOfElements() > 0)
    {
    const double lastStep = tsv->GetElement(tsv->GetNumberOfElements() - 1);
    pqApplicationCore *app = pqApplicationCore::instance();

    // set animation time to the last timestep
    QList<pqAnimationScene*> scenes
        = app->getServerManagerModel()->findItems<pqAnimationScene *>();
    foreach (pqAnimationScene *scene, scenes)
      {
      scene->setAnimationTime(lastStep);
      }

    if(this->Rescale->isChecked())
      {
      // rescale
      QList<pqPipelineRepresentation*> pipes
          = app->getServerManagerModel()->findItems<pqPipelineRepresentation *>(
);
      foreach (pqPipelineRepresentation *pipe, pipes)
        {
        pipe->resetLookupTableScalarRange();
        }
      app->render();
      }
    }

Hi Ken and All,

i've solved the problem with my openmpi build.
below are an example of it.

yewyong at vrc1:~/installer/mpi_test> mpirun -np 14 -machinefile quad
./hello_parallel
hello_parallel.cc: Number of tasks=14 My rank=5 My name=vrcwr220.

hello_parallel.cc: Number of tasks=14 My rank=8 My name=pc205.
hello_parallel.cc: Number of tasks=14 My rank=6 My name=pc249.
hello_parallel.cc: Number of tasks=14 My rank=12 My name=vrcwr228.
hello_parallel.cc: Number of tasks=14 My rank=11 My name=pc226.

however, my problem still exist. my paraview doesn't seems to give any
response when i'm trying to connect
to the pvserver.
*
Starts the pvserver*
yewyong at vrc1:~/installer/mpi_test> mpirun -np 14 -machinefile quad pvserver
--use-offscreen-rendering
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Client connected.

*And the client shows....*
yewyong at pc226:~> paraview
Waiting for server...

and the paraview "hangs" with a "choose server" window. (no buttons are
functioning)
i had to go to the konsole to "ctrl+c" to actually exit the paraview.

I tried having different sequence in machinefile to check whether it's the
problem with different IP domain

*my machine file (quad):*
202.185.77.110 slots=4 max-slots=4 (master node with 2 ethernet port;
another is 192.168 seires)
192.168.0.220 slots=2 max-slots=2
192.168.0.205 slots=2 max-slots=2
192.168.0.249 slots=2 max-slots=2
202.185.77.219 slots=2 max-slots=2
202.185.77.220 slots=2 max-slots=2

as per my findings, paraview will have problem connecting to pvserver
whenever pvserver is build from nodes
from different IP domain.

ps, even with hamachi (vpn), when each nodes are having 5.xx.xx.xx series as
IP, the problem persists.

sorry for the lengthy "story telling" mail.

appreciate all the help i can get.

Thanks in advance.

yewyong

Totally kosher and good practice. This is the way the composite
executive iterates over the blocks of a multi-block or AMR dataset.
Just to be sure, I would check the source code of the superclass just
to make sure that it works only with the information vector and that
it does not do something like GetInputDataObject(). Filters are not
supposed to do that but some do anyway.

I didn't realize the superclass was in ParaView.

As you have already discovered, you use vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()
to get/set the data object. For some of the other keys, look at the
header for: vtkDataObject, vtkExecutive, vtkDemandDrivenPipeline,
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline and vtkCompositeDataPipeline. The
keys related to the pipeline and filters are documented in the VTK
user's guide and one or two Kitware Source articles (I think). Beyond
that, it is a matter of finding an example filter to see what  it
does. Copy and paste is our best friend :-)

Hello,

pvserver --help reports:

"--use-offscreen-rendering  Render offscreen on the satellite processes.
This option only works with software rendering or mangled mesa on Unix."

Is this true? Is there no way to get offscreen hardware-accelerated
rendering in Paraview other than compiling with Mangled Mesa? Or is the
help text bogus?

You should be able to do it from C++. If you have a
pqProxy/pqPipelineSource, you can call getProxy() to get the proxy
object.

Dear All,

I'd like to be able to highlight a point on screen via the python
programmable filter, essentially giving the same effect as using the 'Select
Points On' feature but without having to manually select the point by hand.
Any ideas as to how this could be achieved?

Regards,

Or so I thought...

Just to summarize my configuration:
* I'm using (for now) a single render node with a single GPU, but
dual-headed output
* X is configured to run one server, with two screens (:0.0 en :0.1)
* I'm running pvserver with
mpirun -bynode -np 1 ./pvserver -tdx=2 -tdy=1 -display :0.0 : -np 1
./pvserver -tdx=2 -tdy=1 -display :0.1
* I'm running the GUI from a different system through an SSH tunnel to
port 11111 on the render node
* I'm using paraview 3.6.1 on 32-bit Ubuntu Linux boxes

The first thing that's off is that although I get undecorated Paraview
render areas on each panel display they don't fill the whole screen
(only roughly 75% in both width and height).

Secondly, when loading a dataset and e.g. extracting an isosurface the
rendering seems to work fine (minus the not completely full-screen
render area). I can also see the two display match up nicely (I haven't
specified any mullion setting so I'm assuming they get set to zero
pixels). So far so good. But when I switch to volume rendering I get the
strange artifact that each display renders only half of the total volume
set; the left display only does the upper half, the right only the lower
half. Even when the complete volume is moved so it is fully shown on
only one display only half of the set is rendered.  This seems to
suggest that there is some kind of sort-last rendering going on, instead
of sort-first.

Any clues?
Paul

Message-ID: <KRIARK$6BEB6C84421478FA9D55F5E7FEF37878@libero.it>

Hi,
since our cluster hasn't gpu, we compiled paraview with osmesa support (as explained in http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server) and we always run paraview server with flags:

--use-offscreen-rendering --disable-composite

If in paraview (client) we disable the option edit -> settings -> server -> remote rendering threshold (or if we increase threshold to max - 100 MB), the client only crashes when we try to execute certain operations (such as "select block"), but performances are very very bad.

If instead we don't disable the above option, paraview crashes when we try to load a file or to execute any operation.

The errors is always:

vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x1c911b0): Server Connection Closed!

Could be really a problem regarding X server and DISPLAY variable?

Thanks a lot.

Sorry, I don't understand.

I actually have a reader derived from vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm

>>> What happens if you call MarkModified(None) on your source proxy?
>> This made me research what a source proxy is (I tried to do it without
>> python, just with C++) but now it seems that python is the choice.

With python I can do the following within the python shell:

# this is atually my reader
reader = servermanager.sources.CFSreader
view = GetActiveView()
view.ViewTime = 2
view.StillRender()

voila! it works.

But even when it runs in a thread, paraview is blocked.

I finally found a solution. I use the Animation tool. Paraview
is also blocked but so far it is ok.

BTW,
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView:AnimationTutorial
seems to be heavily outdated - It was luck that we found the Duration
property.

Anyway - I hope my workaround is sufficient.

Thanks!

Thanks for the support. It helped! But due to time constraints I'll go
with the animator.

Hi,

The animation idea for in-situ does not work as smooth as required.

How can I mark data modified from my read in C++ such that it is requested
by the animation and time stepping again?

The animation cache cannot be set below 10K.

It would be a great help to know that this is not possible from my
data reader.
Do I need python?

Thanks, Fabian

No and yes.  You can use this option to enable offscreen rendering on the server that is hardware accelerated.  I often use it on our cluster to run multiple processes on the same node without worrying about rendering buffers overriding each other.  However, the server processes will still pop open a window on the server nodes, they will just remain blank.  So, if you want to use this option to circumvent having an X host or preventing an annoying window pop up, this option will not help.

Hello,

pvserver --help reports:

This option only works with software rendering or mangled mesa on Unix."

Is this true? Is there no way to get offscreen hardware-accelerated
rendering in Paraview other than compiling with Mangled Mesa? Or is the
help text bogus?

Hi,

 

I hear about paraview from the HDF5 website software list that paraview can
handle HDF5 data.  I installed a windows version of paraview but it doesn't

supposed to handle HDF5 data?  Or is there an HDF5 reader that paraview can
use to read HDF5 data?

 

Thanks.

PV does not support HDF5 data directly. The format is too ambiguous for 
this purpose.
The way to smuggle your HDF5 files into PV is XDMF, a 'light' XML 
description of your 'heavy' data file.

To read HDF5 data you need to create an xdmf file that describes the data.
You can learn more about xdmf here: http://xdmf.org/index.php/Main_Page.

Good luck,
Peter.

you can read HDF5 data, by first writing a light-weight description of
it in the XDMF format, in order to describe the contents of the HDF5
data. Examples of xdmf files ready for input to ParaView can be found on
the following site:

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple calls to pqView::setAnnotationLink have no
	effect
Message-ID: <01388EFD6F94FE4787C7CB970014DF671CBDF20600@ES01SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I'm trying to implement a solution to a customer request to freeze a graph view such that selections through that view propagate out to other views through the global annotation link but do not affect the contents of the graph in which the selection occurred. 

However, I seem to be running into either a bug in the setAnnotationLink method in pqView, or an error in my understanding of how it should work.  One of my solution approaches involves setting the annotation link for a view to an empty annotation link initially (so that selections don't propagate), then setting it to the global annotation link when the user wishes to select through that view and have selections propagate to other views, then setting it back again when the user no longer wants to propagate selections.  Unfortunately, the behavior I am seeing is that any call to pqView::setAnnotationLink after the first call seems to have no effect.  In other words, the first annotation link set on a view seems to be the annotation link that is always in effect, no matter how many other calls are made to set the annotation link to another link.

This puzzled me, so I both looked at the code and traced its execution in the debugger.  The internal annotation link seemed to be reset properly in pqView::setAnnotationLink, but that did not seem to have any effect on any of the views that  were using the original annotation link.  In other words, if I intialized my view with an empty annotation link (by making the first setAnnotationLink call contain the empty annotation link), selections were *never* propagated to views that used the global annotation link, no matter how many times I tried to set the annotation link on the view to the global annotation link.  Conversely, if I intialized my view with the global annotation link, selections were *always* propagated to views that used the global annotation link, no matter how many times I tried to set the annotation link on the view to an empty annotation link.

My questions are these.  Is there a trick to getting multiple calls to pqView::setAnnotationLink to work?  Is there a second step that needs to be done, perhaps by notifying all the other linked views that the annotation link has changed?  

Thanks!  Enjoy!

I did some more testing using a different setup (3 displays, vertically
stacked). I noticed the following things:

* After connecting with the paraview GUI to the server all displays
render fullscreen. The axes are shown on the blue background in the
right position and I can move them around over the different displays
* When I add some element to the scene it depends on the type of element
what happens. For example, if I add a cone source all 3 displays change
size. I haven't measured exactly but the size they end up using seems to
be the same as *the size of the render area in the GUI*. Trying
different window sizes for the GUI (after restarting everything) shows a
pretty strong correlation between GUI render area size and display
render area size. If, after restarting everything, I add a mandelbrot
source to the scene the panel render areas size stays the same, i.e.
fullscreen.

Hi guys,

an update of my problem..

if i wait long enough, the error message pops up and the server konsole.

[pc226][[25673,1],4][btl_tcp_endpoint.c:631:mca_btl_tcp_endpoint_complete_connect]
connect() failed: Connection timed out (110)
[pc226][[25673,1],5][btl_tcp_endpoint.c:631:mca_btl_tcp_endpoint_complete_connect]
connect() failed: Connection timed out (110)

since the server receives the initial call from the paraview, why wouldn't
it get a response from the paraview later as mentioned above??

Thanks again

Thank you for the quick response.

 

I have now succeeded with generating "Stream Tracer" in my surface. 

I used the filter "Stream Tracer with Custom Source" 

But first I had to create "Surface Vectors" as input, then a form of source. 

I used "Extract Selection" and selected points with the tool from the edit menu. 

 

But is possible to use a probe location as a source? Because that definitely don't work for me. 

 

I mean, every time I add new points into the Extract Selection, my old ones disappears. I can?t select two points far away from each other at the same time. 

Of course I can add all the points in the ?Selection Inspector? to the Extract Selection, but then I have to remember the index from each point that I want to extract. Is it not possible to just add more points to the ExtractSelection list without erasing the old ones? 

 

I have also tried to make a custom Filter so I don't have to create "Surface Vectors", "Extract Selection" and "Stream Tracer with Custom Source" every time I want a streamline. But then I couldn't change the properties for the points in Extract Selection. The only alternatives is ?Preserve Topology? and ?Show bounds?. 

How can I easily save all my settings without open a new layout every time?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Save Layout

You could try using lookmarks, which are design to save a portion of the state and then apply that to different input data.  Lookmarks are created by clicking on the lookmark icon in that little bar above the view.

That said, although lookmarks are nice when they work, they tend to be quite inflexible.  Coming soon we are planning to replace the lookmark functionality with a more configurable macro capability that is driven by Python scripting.

Message-ID: <4AD72159.50105@am.uni-erlangen.de>

Hi,

it's me again - I have the impression that nothing that I try really
works :(
But I'm getting closer :)

I get access to my reader from python via
r = GetSources().items()[0][1]

I want to get an integer value from my reader.

The only way I know to do this, is:

*.h
  vtkSetMacro(CurrentPolledStep, int);
  vtkGetMacro(CurrentPolledStep, int);
  int CurrentPolledStep;

and *.xml
     <!-- Allow AnimationReader.py to check if there is a new in-situ
result -->
     <IntVectorProperty  name="CurrentPolledStep"
       command="SetCurrentPolledStep"
       number_of_elements="1"
       default_values="1">
       <BooleanDomain name="int"/>
       <Documentation>
         Current step determined by the reader step.
       </Documentation>
     </IntVectorProperty>

I actually don't want to have it in the GUI but that's the only way I
found.

It is also displayed as a checkbox in the GUI but according to
classvtkSMBooleanDomain.html
it shall take any int value.

I also have a TimeStep value from a range.

In python I always get the value set in the GUI but not the current
value in my
C++ object.

I call Modified() within C++ after setting and
r.UpdatePipelineInformation()
in python but
r.TimeStep
and
r.CurrentPolledStep
don't change in python.

Any hint?

Thanks,

Fabian

save data works it is difficult to extract the values from the csv file.

It possible to write the data is a simple text format like x, pressure, 
... ?
To use with say gnuplot.
Hope my question is clear.

Hi Fabian,

It should be possible to hide CurrentPolledStep from the GUI by adding this to
your XML file (didn't test it, though):

    <Hints>
      <!-- This property is here simply to get it. -->
      <Property name="CurrentPolledStep" show="0" />
    </Hints>

Look at ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml for examples where
to put it exactly.

Your problem with
  r.CurrentPolledStep
not changing might be caused by your XML. I guess it should read:

     <IntVectorProperty  name="CurrentPolledStep"
       command="GetCurrentPolledStep" ....>

Please note the "Get" instead of the "Set".

Sven

Message-ID: <c9adba420910150833u2cc5262fy32067683b68cd4f8@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a parallel reader where an a equal number of cells are
loaded onto each process.  Only the necessary points are loaded for
each process but a global id is set for the point data.  Is there a
way I can get D3 to create ghost cells for me?  When I apply D3 then
it still shows many bounding boxes (for a single block) and extract
surface has all the partition walls showing too.  Am I missing
something here?

Csv = Comma separated values, for example "x,pressure,..."  Could you perhaps be more specific on the problem since what you describe, to me, sounds exactly what the csv file should contain?

Dear Mr. Moreland,

I am just starting with paraview and would like to use the particle tracer filter. But I have no clue how to get it to work.
Would you be kind enough to help me through it?

Bottom line comes down to that I have a 3 dimensional liquid vector flowfield. I made a slice. And I use the slice as source and flowfield as input. But it keeps giving error messages like:

ERROR: In /home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx, line 557
vtkFileSeriesReader (0xa2de020): vtkTemporalDataSet not fully supported.

And I have my data files in vtk legacy format.

Is that the problem?

Sincerely,
leo lau

Subject: [Paraview] Animating legacy VTK file series
Message-ID: <1bc88cd40910151524q7d3fbb8drc249b6d8a87bd027@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I have been struggling in creating an animation for the whole day long. My
way to do that is first I made the file series directly from my own c code,
formatted in Legacy .VTK and named like 000.vtk, 001.vtk, 002.vtk ......,
then I tried to load all these files into Paraview so that I could possibly
make an animation, but it did not work out since Paraview only let me select
one file per time. I referred the online guide abt "animating legacy VTK
file series" (http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series). It
seems to me that I need certain "header" file like "blow..vtk" as shown in
this website. I have no idea how to get that kind of file from my own c
code. In a word, my problem is that each individual file could be visualized
in Paraview but I could not combine all of them into an animation. Could
anyone help me out? I am so frustrated now!!!

Thanks in advance!!
P.S. I am using Mac os 10.4.11, Paraview 3.6.1
cheers,
Song

Hi Song,

Don't name your files simply 00X.vtk. Add a prefix, e.g. foo00X.vtk.
Then the globbing works and your files will show up in the file dialog
as foo..vtk.

Leo,

Apply a TemporalCache filter first to your data before applying the
ParticleTracer filter. The warning
  "vtkTemporalDataSet not fully supported."
will still be issued for every file of your file series, but at least
the ParticleTracer will generate particles. Without the TemporalCache in
between it will output nothing.

There is an auto-accept setting in the preferences.

It is also possible to make a custom panel for your filter, intercept
the qt signal that the accept button watches (sorry I can't find the
specifics right now) and automatically accept.

When I use plot on sorted lines running with partitioned data I get
multiple blocks showing for a single partitioned block.  The same data
is shown as one block with the plot data filter.

Hi

Should the outline representation look the same if I have my data
loaded in parallel to when it is in serial?  I am getting multiple
outlines (1 for each process) for each block in my multiblock dataset.
 I don't know if this is the desired behaviour or whether I am doing
something wrong.

Thanks,
Paul

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0910160540k358beb27u82c6e858be18ba6a@mail.gmail.com>

I tried to load what is apparently a bad ply file in paraview. Paraview
crashed and I was left in my terminal with the error:

ERROR: In /home/doriad/src/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkPLYReader.cxx, line 132
vtkPLYReader (0xa412288): Cannot read geometry

Is there a way that paraview could stay alive and throw errors like this
itself in a message box or something? I've had similar problems when trying
to decimate an invalid mesh - it would be nice to see "error decimating
mesh" instead of paraview just closing/crashing.

Maybe there is already something like this in place and it is just not being
used by all the vtk classes?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Pipeline suggestion
Message-ID: <ef747b890910160610m2b045ca1pc5172c6dcc15ea88@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I'm trying to integrate hydrodynamic forces on an immersed body. Point
velocity and pressure fields come from a FEM solver. Ok, for this purpose,
I'll need:

a). The body's surface
b). Stress tensor (computed as cell data)
c). Body cell normals

Here goes the pipeline I'm trying to use:

1. Load the volume data
2. Clean to grid (to remove parallel interfaces among mesh partitions)
3. Compute Derivatives (output tensor type = strain)
4. Extract Surface
5. Generate Surface Normals
6. Point Data to Cell data (to convert point pressure in cell pressure)
7. Clip (to get only the body where I'd like to compute the forces)
8. from 7: Calculator (sigxx = -pressure+2*mu*Strain_0)

repeate step 8 for other components

Questions are:

-- Does it make sense? I'm asking it because I have some doubts about the
output of some of the filters I'm using (mainly steps 3 and 5)

-- Is there a more straightforward way to do the same thing?

Thanks for any help

Some nitpicking:

1. I'm guessing you mean strain rate instead of strain since you're using
velocity.
2. For step 8 it looks like you're missing the cell surface area and the
normal (I think you should only have to calculate the scalar values to get
the force you want).

As far as the compute derivatives part, make sure you're using a recent
version as I made modifications to the vtkGradientFilter to do gradients of
non-scalar (i.e. number of components > 1) and end up with a tensor of order
1 more than the input tensor.  Let me know if you get unexpected results
with that and I'll take a look.

Overall, it looks good. Are you getting unexpected results? Also, if
you want more accuracy, you can skip point to cell and write a Python
filter that iterates over cells and performs its own integration. This
would also allow you to do all components at once.

Subject: [Paraview] Graceful error handling?

I am guessing that this is a problem with the reader. It probably
creates an invalid output when this error occurs. The reader should
clean its output (i.e. make it empty) when it encounters an error.
That way, you would see the error on the error console (which does pop
up) and ParaView would not crash.

Hmm. Something is fishy. Can you provide an example dataset or tell us
how to reproduce this otherwise?

showing this with an image or something?

Hi David,

> Sorry Fabian, I've been quite busy at Vis and haven't been able to help.
I can understand! For my tight deadline we skipped paraview and
implemented a
simple standalone live-data-visualization tody in Qt for a
presentation next week
- hence I'm not under pressure any more.

But I will need to solve the issue in Paraview later, more relaxed :)

I finally came to such a scenario as you described - I just don't know
(yet)
how to implement it.

In python it seems to be a bad idea as paraview is not responding
while the python
shell is running (even when it waits most of the time on sleep()).

At least from python I also did not find, how to call
RequestInformation() and
RequestUpdateExtent() from my vtkAlgorithm based reader. Do you know?

You ment this methods by "standard information property", right?

Writing a reader is not that complicated and most probably all a user
needs
to implement in general.
But a "live-data aware animation" needs some kind of GUI (start,
pause, stop),
propably it might even allow concurrent user interactions like zooming.
I guess this is rather difficult to implement as plugin?!

Indeed I think it would be best to have an enhanced Animation feature
that does
not only request as fast as possible but polls RequestInformation(),
RequestUpdateExtent().

I believe such an extension would make performing live-data/
realtime-vis/ in-situ
as requested by some users much easier to implement (by just making
the readers sensitive)
but without handling the full VTK pipeline.

I just submitted a feature request: 9724

Thanks for any help/ comments,

Fabian

I would like simply the values x,y,z, x-velocity. It looks like the x 
values are point values and not physical values with they,z values being 
zero.
Hope this helps,

Subject: [Paraview] Running Paraview's VTK Experimental Dashboard Build?
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0910170722v7e424769n2d26c6d574239f02@mail.gmail.com>

I typically use/work on the VTK that is checked out with paraview.
There seems to be no way to submit an experimental build of VTK from
inside paraview. Does that seem like a reasonable thing to want to do?
e.g.

cd .../bin/ParaView3/VTK
make Experimental

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] CVS issues?
Message-ID: <336F4BAA-F6CE-490E-AC9D-CB0DAB1E7828@gmail.com>

Hi all

I just compared my git-cvsimport mirror to a fresh CVS checkout and  
noticed something strange going on with the file VTK/Rendering/ 
vtkOpenGLProjectedPolyDataRayBounder.h. It is there in the git mirror,  
but doesn't show up in the CVS checkout. So I checked the ViewVC (http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLProjectedPolyDataRayBounder.h?hideattic=0&root=ParaView3&view=log 
) and if I'm reading things correctly, the file actually SHOULD show  
up in a checkout (as it has the HEAD tag and is on the MAIN branch).

Even stranger, both the .cxx and .h file were removed back in 2001,  
but the .h file the just shows up again one day later with a few  
changes and was modified a few more times until 2004, although I  
suspect that these changes were "automatic" (i.e. formatting,  
copyright notice, etc. through scripts or editor macros).

Grepping through the CVS checkout doesn't turn up any references to  
the file, so it seems to be orphaned.

I don't think this is a big issue, I'm just wondering why the file  
doesn't get checked out by CVS if it clearly isn't marked as dead...

Hello everybody,

I am simulating the falling of a sphere immersed in a fluid and I have to make
multiple movies of the same flow for different viscosities (Reynolds numbers).
I have been doing this by cutting slices, plotting iso-surfaces and moving
manually the sphere (it is descending a constant velocity, so I know the
location). 

Since I have to create or move the sphere manually (importing the files and
creating a movie is not the problem but plotting the sphere within the fluid
is), is it possible to record what I am doing so that I do not have to re-do
it several times?

thanks!
rafael

If you are using the paraview 3.6.2 branch or cvshead you can record
macros using python trace.  Python trace can record data loading,
applying filters, and changing filter properties, but doesn't record
things like creating animations or saving data.  Once you have a
python macro it's fairly easy to add extra code to the generated
script to automate your work further.

Hello Berk,

 

we use flat walls. How can I used the tiled-display support?

 

Is there a possibility to run more than one render server with one data
source? If yes how can this be archived?

 

Thanks

 

Steffen

Is this a flat wall or curved wall? There is still no Cave support in 
ParaView but there is definitely tiled-display support.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkSMProxy: GetSubProxy is protected,
	but I need it outside the class
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0910182350t222077fdidc5137c34e172b6e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wrote a plugin that enable a toggle between different BlendMode of the
FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper that is used by ParaView for volume rendering.
It catches a key event on a render window ('B' pressed) and toggle
BlendMode: Composite -> MaximumIntensity -> MinimumIntensity ->
Composite->...

Here is my way:
- When button 'B' pressed:
   - get view manager from core instance
   - get active view from view manager
   - for each representation 'rep' of active view:
      - check if 'rep' has a VolumeRepresentation SubProxy
      - if yes:
         - check if VolumeRepresentation has a VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper
SubProxy
         - if yes:
            - get the vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper ('mapper') from this
latter SubProxy
            - mapper->SetBlendMode( (++mapper->GetBlendMode(  ))%3 );
            - Update and render.


For this to work, I need to call vtkSMProxy::GetSubProxy( char* ) from my
plugin class. But unfortunately, these functions are protected member. I
modified the ParaView sources to make it public, and it work just... fine.
My questions are:
- Is there a reason (software design, maybe?) to protect the functions that
give access to subproxies, whereas the access to properties are
-fortunately- public?
- Is there another way to access SubProxy without modifying ParaView's
sources?

Thanks!

Jerome

As newer version of PV are released, is there a file that shows what the

I use PV 3.4.0 and doing animations requires that I cannot change my 
screen while the animation frames are being made. There are 800 sets of 
data so it takes time during which I cannot work.
The offscreen option made help but I believe that it has been reported 
that a bug exists in 3.4.0 when using it. Has the offscreen bug been 
fixed in later releases?

Hi Steffen,

First and foremost, you need to run pvserver using MPI. Take a look here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

I am not sure how your tiled display is setup. If you have one machine
driving each display, you have to make sure that MPI distributed
ParaView with one process per machine. If you have one machine with 3
graphics output driving the whole thing, you have to run all processes
on that machine but each process will have a different DISPLAY set.

Once this is working, you should be able to run ParaView in
client/server mode and see the windows on the tiled-display.

After that, you will have to use the tiled-display arguments when
running pvserver. I believe it will be -tdx=3 -tdy=1 in your case.

Out of curiosity, did you try to merge the blocks coming out of "plot
on sorted lines"? Also, I am not sure I understand what you mean by
"he current scatter plot filter joins up points". I didn't use the
scatter plot view yet.

We send out a release announcement but it would be good to have the
release notes on the download page. I'll see if we can do that.

It depends on what you mean :-) The bug has always been on the
graphics card drivers. If you have a somewhat recent graphics card
that is not one of the piece-of-crap Intel cards, it should work. I'd
suggest trying it out.

Yes, there is a reason for not exposing the sub-proxies. We wanted the
access to the sub-proxies to be only through exposed properties
because we want all proxies (whether they have sub-proxies or not) to
behave exactly the same way. Allowing access to the sub-proxies makes
it almost impossible to make sure that developers don't shoot
themselves in the foot by changing properties of the sub-proxies that
are supposed to be controlled by the super-proxy. For example, a
property in the super-proxy may end up setting multiple properties in
the sub-proxy.

Isn't there another way of doing this? Maybe expose the property you
are setting? Something like VolumeMapperBlendMode?

I just tried merging the blocks coming from "plot on sorted lines" and
it is the same as the slice that was given as input (although it is an
unstructured grid rather than polydata).  If I then plot the data it
will still connect up the two circles (see attached image).

I also tried the "Scatter Plot" filter but it is actually the same as
the "Plot Data" filter (is this work in progress?).  However, I have
noticed that I can set the line style to "None" and marker style to
"Cross" (as shown in scatterplot.png) which solves my current problem
for plotting axial position against pressure (although it would still
be nice to have lines connected up in the same was as the polydata).

Paul

Try the scatter plot view. You have to set the view type to it.
Warning: It is a work in progress.

Thanks for your precisions.

Well you are right! ParaView's proxy mechanism is robust and giving too much
freedom to developers could be really dangerous!
And effectively, my first try to have access to VolumeMapper BlendMode
property was to change the rendering.xml resource in order to expose it.

What I did was:

- adding a IntVectorProperty in FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper SourceProxy
      <IntVectorProperty
        name="BlendMode"
        command="SetBlendMode"
        default_values="0"
        number_of_elements="1"
        animateable="0">
        <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
          <Entry value="0" text="Composite"/>
          <Entry value="1" text="MaximumIntensity"/>
          <Entry value="2" text="MinimumIntensity"/>
        </EnumerationDomain>
      </IntVectorProperty>

- adding BlendMode as exposed property to
UniformGridVolumeRepresentationProxy in FixedPoint(...) SubProxy
          <Property name="BlendMode"/>

- adding BlendMode as exposed property to UniformGridRepresentation
PVRepresentationProxy in UniformGrid(...) SubProxy.

I changed blend mode by using GetProperty("BlendMode") on the representation
proxy, and it works as well. But in both case (bad unprotected way and
exposing propoerty way), I have to change something in ParaView's tree and
recompile it. It makes my plugin working on my computer only...

Is this BlendMode exposure interesting you and do you want me to send a diff
file of my local 'rendering.xml'?

Thanks again!

Best regards,
Jerome

Dear all

I am porting some code python code from 3.4 to 3.6 and cvs

The following code, which works fine in 3.4 raises an error in the more
recent versions.

writer = sm.writers.XMLPUnstructuredGridWriter()
writer.NumberOfPieces = 4

Attribute NumberOfPieces does not exist...

Any fix possible?

So... you are asking not write out the fields you are not interested in.  I am afraid that ParaView does not support that; it will write out all of the data to the file.  You will have to remove these columns after ParaView has written the file.

I slected only to plot only the velocity in x anong a line that was

I would like simply the values x,y,z, x-velocity. It looks like the x
values are point values and not physical values with they,z values being
zero.
Hope this helps,

Hi Berk,

I read through the wiki, but I do not understand how it works. How is the
workflow / buildup? Let me try to illustrate our hardware buildup and my
understanding.

We have 3 render server, with 2 graphic outputs on one graphic card (for the
passive stereo projection). The machines have ubuntu/debian linux installed.
The projection walls are plain, we have two walls and a bottom (two
projectors per projection target - 6 overall).

On the controlling PC is Windows XP installed.

What I want is to control with the Windows XP - PC the contend which is
displayed in our 3 wall cave. How do I have to start paraview?

I know I have to setup a machine file and server configuration file? But I
don't know how...

How is the command for the pvserver start? I read about:
mpirun -np [NUMBER OF CORES] ./pvserver -m [MACHINE FILE]
--use-offscreen-rendering -tdx=3 -tdy=1

As I understand it starts a pvserver on one Machine, but I need 3 render
servers? How can I start the other servers? How is the paraview application
started? And how can I connect to the servers?

Sorry for the many questions.

Thanks!

Steffen

Hi Steffen,

First and foremost, you need to run pvserver using MPI. Take a look here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

I am not sure how your tiled display is setup. If you have one machine
driving each display, you have to make sure that MPI distributed
ParaView with one process per machine. If you have one machine with 3
graphics output driving the whole thing, you have to run all processes
on that machine but each process will have a different DISPLAY set.

Once this is working, you should be able to run ParaView in
client/server mode and see the windows on the tiled-display.

After that, you will have to use the tiled-display arguments when
running pvserver. I believe it will be -tdx=3 -tdy=1 in your case.

Subject: [Paraview] Array Calculator missing blocks in a hierarchical
	multi-block dataset
In-Reply-To: <4ADC8444.50106@cscs>
References: <4ADC8444.50106@cscs>
Message-ID: <4ADC918B.5040301@cscs>


I have a MB dataset of 4 objects, each block being itself a multi-block
dataset. The first MB is a composite object of vtkStructuredGrids, while
the last 3 are again multi-blocks, each one a composite of
vtkStructuredGrids. This is not AMR, just a complex geometry, cleanly
separated into functional objects.

Well, ArrayCalculator does not handle that well. It produces the same
hierarchy, but most objects have empty data fields, except for the first
 MB (at the lowest level), of the last MB at the first level.

Is it possible that the traversal of a multi-composite object does not
quite fully visit all leaf objects? Yet, if I slice the multi-composite
object, I get the correct multi-composite slices. So, is there something
particular to the ArrayCalculator?

How does one change the number of decimal places using plot over line?
Seems to set at two decimal places. 0.01 when I need 0.001.
Thanks,

There is a Wiki page that captures the release notes for each release of ParaView.  I've asked Utkarsh to add a link from the download page to this Wiki page.  He agreed this was a good idea, but it has not happened yet.  If someone whose name starts with "B" and ends with "erk" wants to do it while Utkarsh is away, that would be OK.

Hi,

I think it can be done by applying a Calculatur filter first to store the
coordinates as an additional point dataset (named e.g. 'xyz'), then applying the
original Plot over Line filter and finally a Programmable Filter with the
following code:

inp = self.GetInput()
filename = "foo.csv"

FILE = open(filename,"w")
FILE.write("x,y,z, x-velocity")
numPoints = inp.GetNumberOfPoints()
coords = inp.GetPointData().GetArray("xyz")
vel = inp.GetPointData().GetArray("Velocity")
for i in xrange(0, 3*numPoints, 3):
  FILE.write(str(coords.GetValue(i)) + "," + str(coords.GetValue(i+1)) + "," +
str(coords.GetValue(i+2)) + "," + str(vel.GetValue(i)))
FILE.close()

(write statement is one big line, despite it being wrapped in this message)

Can you update to ParaView 3.6?  Several issues with spin box precision were fixed.

That said, I don't know if the problem you are experience will change.  I loaded a copy of 3.4.0 and used the plot over line filter.  I did not have any problem typing 0.001 in any of the properties widgets that accepted real numbers.

How does one change the number of decimal places using plot over line?
Seems to set at two decimal places. 0.01 when I need 0.001.
Thanks,
Stephen

This isn't just my reader.  I can reproduce with the tube.exo file
from the ParaViewData directory.  Here are the steps:

  * Load tube.exo (needs the server to be running in parallel)
  * D3
  * Extract Surface
  * Clip

The first image shows what this looks like with the interfaces
showing.  But if you use Feature Edges and then move the plane in the
Clip filter it will look as it should (second image).

Paul

Does no one else do this? Should I leave Paraview's VTK alone and use
a separate VTK build? The problem with that is then things can't be
tested using Paraview...

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Paraview 3.6.1 on cluster (client - server
	mode)
Message-ID: <766e07b20910200056k1ca89310s1e6d6a14e9bec15d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using
Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the
instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes
bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view ->
Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing
some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

Executing with: 0
*** Process received signal ***
Signal: Segmentation fault (11)
Signal code:  (128)
Failing at address: (nil)

[ 1] /usr/lib/libGL.so.1(glBlendFuncSeparateEXT+0x16) [0x7f4fc7bc12e6]
*** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly
(without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running
and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful
information.

111/475 Testing TestGradientBackground        ***Exception: SegFault
121/475 Testing TestOSConeCxx                 ***Exception: SegFault

151/475 Testing TestParallelopipedWidget      ***Exception: SegFault

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem
to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help
us please?

If you need more information let us now

Thank you very much

Luis

Subject: [Paraview] Exposing BlendMode through UniformGridRepresentation
	(was: vtkSMProxy: GetSubProxy is protected,
	but I need it outside the class)
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0910200134q48b88187n50849cef12be5e2a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
thanks for your interest. Attached is a diff file between my rendering.xml
and CVS's one.
An idea to complete this would be to add a combo-box in the display panel
(such as the slider for slice representation,...). However, this is less
important, since when the BlendMode property is exposed through the
UniformGridRepresentation, the Comp. / MIP / MinIP rendering mode is
'toggleable'. Here is a code snippet that can be use in C++ from inside a
plugin to toggle BlendMode (Note, this could be more elegant by using
properly QList... ):

///////// Code-snippet: Toggle BlendMode
   pqViewManager * viewManager = qobject_cast<pqViewManager*>
         (pqApplicationCore::instance()->manager("MULTIVIEW_MANAGER"));

   // Get the representations present in the active view
   for( int repId = 0; repId < viewManager->getActiveView(
)->getNumberOfRepresentations( ); repId++)
   {

      pqRepresentation* rep = viewManager->getActiveView(
)->getRepresentation( repId );
      vtkSMUniformGridVolumeRepresentationProxy* proxy = 0;
      proxy =
static_cast<vtkSMUniformGridVolumeRepresentationProxy*>(rep->getProxy());

      // Check if the representation proxy is a
UniformGridVolumeRepresentationProxy
      if( proxy && rep->isVisible( ))
      {

         // Get the BlendMode property
         vtkSMIntVectorProperty* blendModeProp = 0;
         blendModeProp  = vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(
proxy->GetProperty("BlendMode"));

         // If the Property is not exposed, it cannot be used!!
         if( blendModeProp )
         {
            // Increment the current BlendMode (Comp -> MIP ->MinIP ->Comp
->...
            int blendMode = blendModeProp->GetElement( 0 );
            blendMode++;
            blendModeProp->SetElement( 0, blendMode%3 );

            // Render
            proxy->UpdateSelfAndAllInputs( );
            rep->renderView( true );
         }
      }
   }

/////////////////// End Code-snippet: Toggle BlendMode

Thanks again,
Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] "Change input" action crashes my ParaView
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0910200624p2758407bxae33bdea31e8cd9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have Paraview3 from CVS. When I want to change the inputs of a filter that
has multiple inputs, I get this message:

   QAbstractItemModel::endRemoveRows:  Invalid index ( 1 , 0 ) in model
pqPipelineModel(0x8fa51c8)

And then ParaView seg-faults. Could someone confirm that this is a bug by
following these basic steps?

- Add a "Sphere" source -> Apply
- Add an "Axes" source -> Apply
- Connect a "Glyph with custom source" to sphere
   -> this will open an "Input editor" dialog with "Sphere" as input and
nothing as source.
   -> Choose "Axes" as source
   -> Ok, Apply
- Normally, you should have axes object at each sphere point (note: default
scale is 0!! have to change in order to see them...)
- Now, entering the bug: right click on "Glyph" in pipeline -> Change input
- "Input editor" dialog is opening: Click on "source" radio button
- Choose "Sphere" in the pipeline -> At this stage I get the QAbstractItem
error message
- Click OK: ParaView ends, seg fault.

I noted this behaviour on WinXP 32, Fedora9-x86_32, Fedora11-x86_32 and
Fedora11-x86_64.
Please note that it could complete the bug #9312 on mantis, since this
append not only when deleting the multiple input filter but also by changing
the inputs...

Thanks,
Jerome

Yup, this is indeed a bug that surfaced since we upgraded to Qt 4.5.
We will be looking at it for 3.8.

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch vs python shell (3.6.1): pvbatch crashes
Message-ID: <4ADDB3A6.90500@scinet.utoronto.ca>

Hi:

I'm just starting to try to learn the python scripting interface to 
ParaView 3.6.1, taking bits and pieces from various tutorial slides 
scattered over the web.   I've managed to put together something that 
works fine in the python shell on the client side, but when I try using 
the same script with pvbatch it crashes.  What am I doing wrong?

I cut down the script; the following is what I've been trying to run 
with pvbatch.

from paraview.simple import *

sm = servermanager

connection = sm.Connect()
view = sm.CreateRenderView()

reader = 
XMLPartitionedRectilinearGridReader(FileName="draping.0030.bin.pvtr")
pointData = CellDatatoPointData(Input=reader)
contour = Contour(pointData)
contour.ContourBy='density'
contour.Isosurfaces=[100]
rep = sm.CreateRepresentation(contour,view)

view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
view.WriteImage("./foo.png", "vtkPNGWriter")

When I run this (modulo the sm.Connect()) in the python shell on the 
client (server launched with mpirun -np 80 pvserver 
--use-offscreen-rendering) it produces what I'd expect.

But run with pvbatch, it dies pretty convincingly:

$  mpirun -np 80 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering ../foo.py

Nvidia Quadro FX 3500 card

Is this a good graphics card?

Are you running linux?  And, if so, have you installed the nvidia
graphics drivers?

Try running "nvidia-settings".  This is the configuration program the
comes with the nvidia drivers.  If you have superuser access to your
system you can download the latest version of the nvidia drivers from
here:

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Paraview 3.6.1 on cluster (client -
 server mode)

Message-ID: <C703356D.E0CD%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

Executing with: 0
*** Process received signal ***

*** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

111/475 Testing TestGradientBackground        ***Exception: SegFault

151/475 Testing TestParallelopipedWidget      ***Exception: SegFault

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

If you need more information let us now

Thank you very much

Message-ID: <C70335B2.AE6D%vgweirs@sandia.gov>


Hi Jonathan,
As you have probably gathered, there are two interfaces to the python scripting - servermanager, which was in 3.4, and simple, which is in 3.6. I haven't had any success with backwards compatibility, despite the "compatibility mode", and you are mixing and matching servermanager and simple. I don't know exactly why you get different results in pvbatch and the GUI, but I would try to replace the servermanager commands by the simple commands. (Note that servermanager is still in 3.6 and later, and sometimes you need it, but mostly you get to it through simple.) In particular:
1.) I don't think you need the connection line
2.) Remove the CreatRenderView line, an equivalent will be added in 4
3.) rep = Show(contour)  # replace the CreateRepresentation line
4.) view = Render() # replace the ResetCamera and StillRender lines
5.) WriteImage("./foo.png")  # replace the view.WriteImage line

Under the hood, some key changes are that paraview is using the active filter, representation, or view when you don't specify it; and is creating a representation or view if you don't have one but you need it. This is why you don't have to create a view or representation directly, Show() and Render() are creating them.

I am not sure if these changes will actually fix the errors you list, but that is where I would start.
Later, eh.

Hi:

I'm just starting to try to learn the python scripting interface to
ParaView 3.6.1, taking bits and pieces from various tutorial slides
scattered over the web.   I've managed to put together something that
works fine in the python shell on the client side, but when I try using
the same script with pvbatch it crashes.  What am I doing wrong?

I cut down the script; the following is what I've been trying to run
with pvbatch.

from paraview.simple import *

sm = servermanager

connection = sm.Connect()
view = sm.CreateRenderView()

reader =
XMLPartitionedRectilinearGridReader(FileName="draping.0030.bin.pvtr")
pointData = CellDatatoPointData(Input=reader)
contour = Contour(pointData)
contour.ContourBy='density'
contour.Isosurfaces=[100]
rep = sm.CreateRepresentation(contour,view)

view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
view.WriteImage("./foo.png", "vtkPNGWriter")

When I run this (modulo the sm.Connect()) in the python shell on the
client (server launched with mpirun -np 80 pvserver
--use-offscreen-rendering) it produces what I'd expect.

But run with pvbatch, it dies pretty convincingly:

$  mpirun -np 80 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering ../foo.py

Message-ID: <32B920B7-9B90-4D62-A365-1431269DA89A@indiana.edu>

Having just updated to Snow Leopard recently, am now trying to re- 
build PV3 (from CVS).

Install Qt 4.5.3 (from qt-sdk-mac-opensource-2009.04.dmg)

running cmake (2.8.0-rc3) on PV3, I have the following problems:
...
-- Looking for Q_WS_MAC - not found.
-- Found Qt-Version 4.5.3 (using /usr/bin/qmake)
...
  Qt QTUITOOLS library not found.
  CMake Error at Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt:498 (FILE):
   file GLOB requires a glob expression after the directory


Would welcome any insight.  Also, am curious if Snow Leopard users try  
to build using the default 64-bit or try to force 32-bit?
And what's the story with Cocoa support in ParaView - should I be able  
to install/use the Qt cocoa-4.6.0-beta1 OK?

thanks, Randy

I am going to guess that something is screwed up with the Qt
installation. I recommend building your own (I know it is not fun). I
built pretty much every combination possible (32bit vs 64bit and Cocoa
vs Carbon). I am currently using 64bit build with Cocoa. There are
some glitches that we will have to fix but nothing that stops me from
working.

I want to add that if you have 3.6.2 or cvs head, you can use the
super useful tracing functionality to create scripts. It is a great
way of coming up to speed with the new API. Take a look at:

If you do have the nvidia drivers, you should be good to go. Let us
know if it doesn't work.

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch vs python shell (3.6.1): pvbatch crashes

Hi, Greg:

Thanks for the quick reply.  Making things more consistent has certainly 
cleaned up the script, which now reads

from paraview.simple import *

reader = 
XMLPartitionedRectilinearGridReader(FileName="draping.0030.bin.pvtr")
pointData = CellDatatoPointData(reader)
contour = Contour(pointData)
contour.ContourBy='density'
contour.Isosurfaces=[100]
rep = Show(contour)
view = Render()
WriteImage("./foo.png")

but the problem remains; it works fine with pvserver when feeding this 
script into the client's python shell, but it still crashes horribly 
with pvbatch:

$ mpirun -np 80 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering ../foo.py

This sounds like a bug. Do you have a small dataset with which we can
reproduce it?

Thanks Berk, I'm going down that LONG path (building from source)  
now... if you're aware of certain Qt libs that *don't* need to be  
built for PV3, I'd welcome hearing about that too, just to possibly  
speed up this process.

I am too scared of Qt to change its build settings :-) Some probably
think the same about ParaView.

:)
A "configure -nomake examples -nomake demos" will cut off some time.
The examples can be compiled on demand if you wanted.

Hi Ken,
thank you for your reply.
No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on
each node downloading the .deb packages with:

apt-get install libosmesa6
apt-get install libosmesa6-dev

Have you got any other idea?
Thank you again.
Luis

Hi again Ken,
I forgot to say that our Debian version is Lenny 64 bit (I hope this
information can help to understand the problem).

Thank you very much

Thanks.  Just to add to the thread, fwiw, I ended up doing (after re- 
installing mysql, sigh):

(path-to)/qt-all-opensource-src-4.5.3$ ./configure -opensource -cocoa - 
framework -arch   x86_64 -nomake examples -nomake demos -sdk / 
Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/

and it seemed to build fine (famous last words).

Subject: [Paraview] Attaching D3 to my own reader
Message-ID: <c9adba420910210403o43a62900n6b2317f1a95d0993@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to use D3 in my parallel reader to distribute the data.
Previously I have been doing this in the ParaView pipeline but now I
would like to incorporate it into my readers RequestData.  I am
experiencing a problem when I use the reader, extract the surface and
then use the feature edges filter.  Everything works as expected until
clicking apply for Feature Edges where request data is called again
for my filter and then the partition boundaries included in the
output.  This does not happen if I remove the D3 from my RequestData
and use in the ParaView pipeline.

I am adding the D3 filter as outlined below in my RequestData:

    vtkMultiBlockDataSet* output = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(
            outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
    VTK_CREATE(vtkMultiBlockDataSet, multiblock);

    // ...
    // READ IN MULTIBLOCK DATA HERE
    // ...

    VTK_CREATE(vtkDistributedDataFilter, d3);
    d3->AddInput(multiblock);
    d3->Update();
    output->ShallowCopy(d3->GetOutput());

Can anyone see anything wrong with this?  Could it be because I need
to set something else in the RequestInformation?  Currently I do this:

    vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
-1);
    return 1;

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Paul

I am guessing that this has something to do with ghost levels. When
you first update your reader, no one requests ghost levels so the
reader produces none. Later, when you apply extract surface with Piece
Invariant turned on, it asks for ghost levels which causes your reader
to re-execute. However, it still does not produce ghost levels because
you are not passing this request to D3. Here is what should work:

* To execute the D3 filter, do something like this:
d3->UpdateInformation();
exec = static_cast<vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline*>(d3->GetExecutive());
exec->SetUpdateExtent(exec->GetOutputInformation(), piece, numPieces,
1); // 1 -> ghostlevel
d3->Update();
// shallow copy and such

Then, something like:

output->GetInformation()->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(), 1);

What I did above is to always produce 1 ghost level. Filters that did
not ask for ghost levels will ignore this extra ghost level. Filters
that do ask for ghost levels should function fine.

Let me know if you need more help. Also, let me know if this works or
not because I am writing this without trying it :-)

If I create the source and set the number of points and radius,
nothing seems to happen.  If I then make the source invisible and then
visible again, the points get displayed. Also, is this supposed to be
a random distribution of points centered on the point that is selected
by pressing 'p'? If not, I don't understand how to specify the
locations of each point in the cloud.

Can someone please clarify?

Hi David,

- I cannot reproduce your "visibility" problem. Once I click Apply after
setting the paramter, my point cloud is displayed in the render window...
- As PointSource proxy is linked to vtkPointSource, the VTK doc tells that
the points are randomly distributed inside the specified sphere.
   -> http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPointSource.html#_details

Best regards,
Jerome

I turned off "auto accept" and it works as you explained. However,
with auto accept enabled, the points never get displayed until the
source is disabled->enabled. I thought the idea of "auto accept" was
that it was the equivalent of clicking "apply" after making every
change?

Thanks,

David

Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

Hi Ken,
thank you for your reply.
No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on each node downloading the .deb packages with:

apt-get install libosmesa6
apt-get install libosmesa6-dev

Have you got any other idea?
Thank you again.

2009/10/20 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov>
Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67

This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

If you need more information let us now

I usually make a separate builds of ParaView and VTK, where both come
from the same source tree.

In other words:
cd ~/pvsource
cvs checkout paraview
cd ~/pvbuild
ccmake ~/pvsource
cd ~/vtkbuild

Can Paraview be changed to Paraview(Legacy) or something so people
don't use it? I just say this because it looks like it has been
getting some use and it would be sad to see good suggestions sitting
in a place that no one checks. Maybe I am misinterpreting the dates
and these bug reports actually belong here? If I am not, maybe they
should be moved to the correct project (Paraview3)?

Thanks,

Responses inline.

Note first, that to the best of my knowledge ParaView3 is _still_
missing the ability to have independent cameras. That is why berk
asked about flat/tiled display. On a tile display the cameras are all
more or less pointed in the same direction. In a cave you want the
cameras to point in different directions.

You may also want to look at the slides from the paraview tutorial at
IEEE Cluster Computing 2009. They are on the paraview wiki too.

First make sure you have mpi running on the linux machines. Once you
do that you should be able to run distributed parallel programs like
so:

mpirun -np N -machinefile filewithmachinenames.txt program

/bin/uname -a is a good program to try first.
if that doesn't work, google for an mpi helloworld program that spits
out each processors rank.

Next build paraview (at least it's server component - the Qt GUI is
not needed) on the linux machines. Ideally, build it on a shared file
system where all three machines can see and run the same executable
file. You need to build the server yourself because the binaries
(other than mac) do not have MPI enabled. Once you build it run the
server via:

mpirun -np 3 -machinefile filewithmachinenames.txt pvserver
You should get one "waiting for client...." message back which
indicates that all three processes are operating as one program.

A windows client controlling a linux server is perfectly fine. You can
even use a binary as long as the revision (3.6.1) matches that of the
server you've built.

Start paraview, click connect, enter in the ip address of the first
server machine. Use manual connection mode because you have already
started the server.

machine file is just the list of machine names. It is how mpirun knows
where to spawn processes.
On our cluster, it is simply:
amber1
amber2
amber3
amber4
...
amber7

Server config file is most often set up automatically via the paraview
client when you hit connect. As long as you can ping from the XP
machine to the client, you probably don't have to worry about it.

pvserver is an MPI program. Think of it as one program that spans
across several machines (one process per machine ussually). Once you
build paraview with MPI enabled, the task of starting up the parallel
program is up to mpirun. After you start the server, you connect the
client program to it simply by clicking connect and defining the host
name and port to connect to.

Yes. We stopped supporting tiles that are not parallel when we moved
from 2 to 3. We can add it back but it would take a few weeks of
effort.

You are not misinterpreting. I was under the assumption that marking a
project "obsolete" in Mantis would disable it but it doesn't seem to.
What we should do is to move all of the ParaView3 bugs to ParaView and
then delete ParaView3. I'll see if I can do that at one point.

Here is a mpi helloworld that also prints out the DISPLAY environment
variable for each process:

/* C Example */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int rank, size;

  MPI_Init (&argc, &argv);	/* starts MPI */
  MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);	/* get current process id */
  MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);	/* get number of processes */
  printf( "Hello world from process %d of %d.  DISPLAY is: %s\n",
rank, size, getenv("DISPLAY") );
  MPI_Finalize();
  return 0;
}


Result:

mpirun -np 2 ./helloworld
Hello world from process 1 of 2.  DISPLAY is: (null)
Hello world from process 0 of 2.  DISPLAY is: (null)

mpirun -np 2 -x DISPLAY ./helloworld
Hello world from process 0 of 2.  DISPLAY is: :0.0
Hello world from process 1 of 2.  DISPLAY is: :0.0

Well, I just try the Auto-accept and I don't have any problem... But maybe I
understand what is disturbing you: When you create the point source, default
is 1 point at the center of sphere. This has a ponctual bounding box, so the
camera is set very close to this point. When changing the parameters, the
camera is not reset. It is likely that your source doesn't produce points in
the field of view.

Try this (that's what I did): just zoom out after having changing the
parameters!

In my mind, Auto-accept is not fired every time changes occur on property,
but in a synchronous way. This has to be confirmed by reading the sources...

HTH!

Ah, yes, zooming out shows the points - I guess I was expecting the
camera to be changed so that you could see all the points as soon as
they are added - but I guess that doesn't make sense - or at least
nothing else does that (e.g. if you create a cylinder and then change
it's height so it goes out of frame, the camera doesn't/shouldn't
adjust).

Thanks for the clarification.

First, just curious - why is there not a separate -devel list for
Paraview as there is for vtk/itk?

I have some time this week and I was hoping to try to implement these:
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=8999

For the ICP interface, all that needs to be selected is two items in
the pipeline and have a few text boxes to specify some parameters.
For the Landmark Transform interface, two sets of N points need to be
selected, one from each of the two selected items in the pipeline.

This seems like it should be relatively easy to do, but the
plugin/servermanager/module/proxy terminology is quite confusing to
me.

Is this the guide I should be following?
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time

That example shows how to add a source, but I imagine it is very
similar to add a filter? I looked at the paraview user guide and the
rest of the links on the wiki, but I didn't see anything like the
following analysis/descriptions - did I miss something major here?

I looked at the TransformFilter in filters.xml as a starting point -
here are some line by line comments/questions about it:

   <SourceProxy name="TransformFilter" class="vtkTransformFilter"
    label="Transform">

1) What is a source proxy? This filter will use the vtkTransformFilter
filter, and it will be called "Transform" in the paraview menu.

    <Documentation
       long_help="This filter applies transformation to the polygons."
       short_help="Transform polygonal data.">
      The Transform filter allows you to specify the position, size,
and orientation of polygonal, unstructured grid, and curvilinear data
sets.
    </Documentation>

2) Where does this help text get displayed?

    <InputProperty
       name="Input"
       command="SetInputConnection">

3) We want to call SetInputConnection() on the input, which is called
Input. Is Input taken to be the selected item in the pipeline you are
attempting to apply the filter to?

          <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
            <Group name="sources"/>
            <Group name="filters"/>
          </ProxyGroupDomain>

4) I'm assuming "Group name" means to add this to the "Filters" menu
in paraview? Why is "sources" also a "group name"?

          <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
            <DataType value="vtkPointSet"/>
          </DataTypeDomain>

5) What is "DataTypeDomain"? I understand that vtkPointSet is the
input type to vtkTransformFilter.

          <Documentation>
            This property specifies the input to the Transform filter.
          </Documentation>
     </InputProperty>

6) Where does this documentation get displayed/placed?

     <ProxyProperty name="Transform" command="SetTransform">

7) What is a ProxyProperty vs an InputProperty?

           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
              <Group name="transforms"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>

8) Where does this "group" called "transforms" appear?

           <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
              <Proxy group="extended_sources" name="Transform3" />
           </ProxyListDomain>

9) What is "extended_sources" and "Transform3"?

           <Documentation>
             The values in this property allow you to specify the
transform (translation, rotation, and scaling) to apply to the input
dataset.
           </Documentation>

10) I see that this string gets displayed if you hover over any of the
items in the transform GUI.


Even though they are similar, the two things I am trying to implement
could be quite different because with the Transform filter, you simply
choose an object in the pipeline and apply that filter to the object -
with my things you have to select TWO things in the pipeline (the
source and destination objects, in the case of ICP). Is there an easy
way to do this? Can you simply ctrl+click items in the pipeline to
select them and then sort out the inputs in the filter?

Where is the code that creates the GUI (to take user input of the
transformation) for this filter?

Can someone please help get me started? I think this will be a useful
exercise - I intend to document the process of adding a filter and
constructing the interface GUI and add it to the wiki so that future
users can hopefully contribute to the project with less of a learning
curve.

Thanks!

Hi David,

The paraview devel list is paraview-developers at paraview.org.  It used
to be private but now it is public.  I was subscribed internally by
Kitware, I'm not sure where the public sign up is located.

There is a method vtkSMProxy* vtkSMProxyManager::NewProxy (const char
* groupName, const char* proxyName).  Calling this with group=sources
and name=TransformFilter will create a new vtkSMSourceProxy.  So
basically "vtkSM" is prepended to the xml element name to create a
class name.  vtkSMSourceProxy is the base class for all sources such
as readers and filters.  For most cases vtkSMSourceProxy is
sufficient, you can control the vtk filter completely through
Properties defined on the source proxy.  But if you look in
rendering.xml you'll see a lot of xml elements that are just plain old
<Proxy/> (corresponding to vtkSMProxy) or more fancy ones like
<RenderViewProxy/> (corresponding to vtkSMRenderViewProxy).  In cases
of things like vtkSMRenderViewProxy, the class is created to handle
extra logic that is not handled simply through Properties.

When you create the transform filter in the paraview gui, only the
vtkSMSourceProxy is created on your machine, the vtkTransformFilter
might be living on a server somewhere else (unless you are in builtin
mode of course).  Setting a property on the source proxy causes a
method to be called on the vtkTransformFilter on the server.

Sorry I can't answer all your questions right now, but it's a start.

Hi all

I managed to build ParaView CVS with the binary distribution of Qt  
4.5.3 (Carbon version) on Mac OS X 10.6.1. Was rather tricky, however.  
Especially, I had to manually fix up the cache (specifying the  
location of the QtUiTools library etc.). Also I had to explicitly set  
CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to '-arch i386', because of a bug in  
CMake where a single architecture in CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES doesn't  
get passed to the command line if it is the "default" architecture  
(which i386 was up to 10.5).

Further I had to make sure that add /System/Library/Frameworks/ 
Carbon.framework to the add_library call of VTK/GUISupport/Qt/ 
CMakeLists.txt and revert parts of the commit "Utkarsh: Mon Sep 14  
18:23:28 2009" with the message "COMP: Fixed build issues." by re- 
introducing the Q_WS_MAC specific code in Qt/Widgets/ 
pqProgressBarHelper.cxx.

I also had to completely revert the commit "COMP:  Support building  
with Qt install from dmg on Mac." (remove the Mac-specific include for  
QtUiTools/QUiLoader in Qt/Core/pqFormBuilder.h)

Did you set "-arch i386" after the initial cmake run?
Does it work a little better if you do the following in a terminal?
export CFLAGS="-arch i386"
export CXXFLAGS="-arch i386"
cmake /path/to/ParaView3

Oh, and that last email I sent had a patch on it removing some obsolete 
workarounds for older CMake versions.  Not that it would help any, but they 
were workarounds in files you had issues with.

Thanks berk - it works now :)

BTW I also needed to set:
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
1);

Will this change the results for any filters if I keep ghost cells on
all the time?  And, is this the recommended thing to do?  Also, is
there any documentation on writing filters to handle ghost levels?

Thanks,
Paul

There are some possibly issues with having ghost levels all the time.
Quantitative filters (histogram for example) don't know to ignore
ghost levels yet. Those are things we need to fix. Beyond that, you
should be OK. I plan on cleaning up and improving ghost level support
in the near future.

Btw, we may drop the support for Carbon once we fix all issues related
to the Cocoa build. I don't see why we would support both.

Agreed, I just figured until then it would be safer to use the Carbon  
version. But I might give Cocoa a try again pretty soon.

Just compiled with your patch, and it works. There is still the issue  
with CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS of course, but that is only a problem for  
Carbon builds. However, does the patch for Qt/CMakeLists.txt also work  
for older Qt versions?

Thanks Pat,

This actually helps quite a bit - looking through those classes I now
have a bit of an idea of the proxies. Only 934 questions left (haha)!
I really think this is worth annotating so we can post a little
developers guide like this somewhere.

Thanks,

David

Hi, y'all -

According to some web pages I found (e.g. https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/Paraview_Tiled-Display_Mode) PV uses sort-last rendering for tiled displays.  If thats true, does it support displays of >8K width?

Thanks,

You mean each tile has >8K or the whole display is >8K? Ken Moreland
is the Ice-T expert here but I don't think there is any hard-coded
limitation on either sizes. Are you running into a problem?

Yes. But somethings may not work 100% since ParaView uses certain
groups to do certain things.

No, I mean the whole display.  I was just wondering since (I think) cards don't generally support >8K windows, and naively, a simple sort-last algorithm uses full-size targets for rendering.  We have a 15x5 tiled display, and I'm thinking about running to the whole thing.

It all should work.  At one time we were driving 12x4 display (~62 million pixels) with graphics cards that only supported 1280x1024.  IceT is careful to only allocate buffers that can be displayed on the local graphics card.  It is also careful not to collect really big images on any one node.  None of the algorithms hold more than two or three tile images at a time (for example, one for sending, one for receiving, and one for aggregation).

You can take my word for it, or you can browse some of the technical publications on IceT.  I have collected them at this web site.

What are you trying to do? These classes will be brought into ParaView
under a plugin? If yes, what sort of plugin (simple vs. custom GUI)?

If you do, can you keep us informed if you run into
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=8464 ?
If not, I'd be very interested to know how your setup differs from mine,
as it seems that that bug basically makes Paraview's current TPD support
unusable.

On a related tangent to the rendering issue:
What method is needed to get the 3d view window to refresh.
I have a customized reader panel with a few Qt checkboxes.
When I select, for example, "Add Labels", the slot sends it to the server manager and it is correctly updated.
However, the text labels themselves don't appear in the window until I do something else like resizing the window, clicking something, etc.

What method should be I using?

Message-ID: <97f327820910222044t2e677704ye7192573cc350db9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been working with a Maya animator with no success to visualize adcp
data from the Congo River. It's the most amazing dataset, and I want to
share it with others through visualization

I'd like to represent my x,y,z and velocity fields (delta-x, delta-y,
delta-z) in paraview.

The data were collected irregularly so can not be represented as structured
points.

I thought I'd use an unstructured grid, but my data are not "cells" but are
rather points with velocity associated with each point.

My questions: what data type should I use? Could someone provide an example
data set or script to point out how to write the recommended data type?

Thanks,
Ned Gardiner

Hi all,

i have been trying to combine 2 network's computer to start up pvserver.
to make it simple, let's say i have 3 desktops,

*A* has 2 ehternet cards which are connecting to both 192.168.0 domain and
202.185.77 domain.
*B* from 202.185.77 domain
and *C* from 192.168.0 domain.

while starting pvserver, would B try to connect to C??
( # mpirun -np 8 -machinefile quad_public pvserver
--use-offscreen-rendering)

quad_public:
===========
202.185.77.110 slots=4 max-slots=4
202.185.77.220 slots=2 max-slots=2
192.168.0.226 slots=2 max-slots=2

And if the answer is yes, how could we ask B to connect to C via A??


Thanks

Paraview,

I am trying to create a network with some cubic pores connected by square
links. For the pores, I applied the box glyphs and for getting square links,
I applied the tube filter with 4 sides. And the final picture
is attached.  Now if we look, the square cross section of the link lying
diagonal to the cubic cross section. What i would like to have the cubic
pores and square cross section aligned parallel. How can I do that? Any
tips?

thank you

Just noticed that the binary install of Qt-Cocoa-4.5.3 is buggy. It  
only contains a stub for QtDBus.framework. Reported the issue to Nokia  
and am building now Qt myself (what a pain!)

Hi,

if your links are independent polydatas, you can simply apply a transform
filter with a 90deg-rotation to the ouput of your tube filters.

Simple.
I just would like to see in the filter menu a new category, below "Alphabetical" named "MyFilters" for instance.

Subject: [Paraview] Auto-load plugin failed
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0910230134k40b61887uc0c3b74043c0367f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

ParaView-CVS brought a good surprise for me a few days ago. The plugin
loader has been rewrote and is now offering an auto-load option that is very
useful.
However, I have an XML description of a lot of VTK native filters that
cannot be opened automatically. I have to "Load new" each time. Then, no
problem, the filters are exposed in the menu. But the plugin loader gives a
warning message (see screenshot attached) and no "Version" (effectively, the
XML doesn't have a "version=" element)...

Second, I have an AutoStartPlugin that shows exactly the same problem
(PVCustomizer). The reason, I think, is that this plugin depends on VTK
filters (SplineFilter) that is described in the previous XML...

Can someone tell me how to make the XML plugin 'autoloadeable' ? I wonder if
it will solve the second problem...

Thanks a lot!

Jerome

Is there a reason why the render windows are not dockable, such as the

?

The underlying toolkit is Qt and the main window interface has a
distinction between the main view and dockable windows.  Although it
would be nice to have an eclipse style fully dockable interface....

Any idea where I can find a good way to browse the Paraview mailing  
list archives, something like Nabble?

VTK is on Nabble, but Paraview isn't so its a bit of a pain,

I've found this thread http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg04434.html

I'm working with a fresh install of OS X 10.6.1. So, I'm going to  
default qt-4.5.4 to -arch x86_64 and -cocoa.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0910230714k2a7c050em99029b5aabfb7c4b@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to follow the "Enabling a filter in VTK"
(http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Enabling_a_filter_in_VTK) guide
on the wiki. This example is how to make a paraview plugin for an
existing VTK filter. It looks like the CMake file is provided, but the
real details are left to the book (I'm assuming it's the book - the
link is broken). Does anyone have the server manager xml and gui xml
that go along with this example? That seems like something that
definitely needs to accompany this example on the wiki.

Thanks,

David

There is another thread on that actually. Look for the subject  
"[Paraview] OSX 10.6, Qt 4.5". Last post was just a few hours ago.

Basically I think it can be done but you have to watch the compile  
flags as CMake 2.6 has a bug where the -arch i386 is NOT explicitly  
set on the compile command so on OS X 10.6 the default is a 64 bit  
binary which might have issues with previously compiled libraries.

   Also, Qt is stating that "Official" snow leopard support is in Qt  
4.6 which should be out later this year.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.6.x connection definition files
Message-ID: <4AE1DFEE.6090608@arl.army.mil>

I have questions regarding the use of connection definition files.   

I have created numerous connection definition files for various clusters 
and compute systems that we have here.     Up until now, I've been 
distributing those pvsc files through a common directory that all of my 
users have access to.   They manually load the pvsc files into their 
session, and those server definitions get automatically saved into 
$HOME/.config/ParaView/servers.pvsc.         The connection definition 
files work great and are a huge time saver for Paraview users - 
particularly in an environment where we need to establish SSH tunnels, 
modify ports and connection IDs, etc.

The problem lies in what happens when I want to change one or more of 
those pvsc files (presumably to incorporate a change that will improve 
functionality, performance, etc 8-)     I update the pvsc file in the 
common directory, and then I need to notify all of my Paraview users 
that there's an update to the PVSC files and that they need to 
delete/replace their existing definition with a new one.   This scenario 
is awkward and requires some effort on the users' part - it would be 
nice if there were a more automatic solution.

So, I've been looking at using a default_servers.pvsc file which in 
theory is a great idea.   All users would have access to a common pvsc 
file that I can control and update as necessary, with no updates 
required by the user.   Well, unfortunately, it doesn't seem to really 
work that way.    The default_servers.pvsc file is read in the first 
time ParaView is loaded, and then those server definitions are saved 
back to the $HOME/.config/ParaView directory.  The servers are 
presumably saved off to preserve some of the information as defined in 
the PVSC file - I have numerous fields (UserID, ProjectID, SSH 
executable labeled with "save=true" so that that information is carried 
over between sessions.

This is where we start to run into problems.     According to the WIKI, 
the last server definition loaded take precedence, so if I make changes 
to the "default_servers.pvsc" file,  it gets loaded prior to 
"$HOME/.config/ParaView/servers.pvsc".     Unless I'm missing something, 
once the server definitions are initialized the first time they are 
recognized and saved off to the user's .config directory, the default 
servers will never have precedence, even if I change/update the 
contents.  Unless the ServerName is changed for each subsequent update 
of a particular server, any updated server in the default servers file 
won't be loaded.    Am I on the right track here - have I missed or 
assumed something that I shouldn't have?    It looks like all of the 
hooks are *almost* there to manage the server definitions .....

Also, using 3.6.1, I went through the process of created a 
default_servers.pvsc, having those servers automatically loaded in my 
ParaView session, and then have them saved off into a local servers.pvsc 
file.  However, during the next Paraview session, the definitions don't 
work properly - it seems as those the only the last item in an  
enumerated list are available through the GUI, and in general it just 
doesn't work correctly.   If those same server definitions are loaded 
manually by the user and saved locally,  they work fine.  So, there's 
apparently an issue related to the use of the default_servers.pvsc and 
how those definitions are saved out to the user's server.pvsc file.

Hi David,

may be this will help, check page 8.

A bit old but can give an idea.

The machines in paraview's server do need to talk to each other.

However, setting up MPI to allow this on a split domain cluster is
more of an MPI question than a ParaView question. I suspect you will
have more luck asking the question in an MPI forum using a hello world
mpi program to demonstrate it. It will also help if you provide
details about the version of MPI that you are using.

The only technical suggestion I have is to use ssh tunneling to set up
the bridge you are looking for. However that will be a severe
bottleneck as communications on the server will have to take an extra
hop.

Hi Mike,
		 So I read the other thread, and build qt-4.5.4 (current version  
form git, branch 4.5) and paraview-3.7.0 (current version from cvs).  
Both qt and paraview compiled and built file, with no errors.

However, when I launch Paraview-3.7.0, it crashes immediately. I've  
attached a trace of the report below. Have you encountered this before?

Best regards,

Elvis

Hi,
	Going through another thread "[Paraview] Snow Leopard", I've learnt  
that the make install version does not work, but you can launch  
paraview from the build directory.

Any idea why?

Best regards,

Elvis

Hi Sean,

I'm building OpenFOAM-1.6, an open source CFD code on a case sensitive  
partition. All the required tools, like qt-4.5.4, paraview-3.7.0,  
cmake-2.9, etc were all build on a case-sensitive partition. After  
building, they were all installed onto the default mac os x / 
Applications folder, which is located in a case-insensitive partition.  
Wonder if that has anything to do with it.

Here are the steps I've followed to built paraview:

Procedure

Step 01.00: Download MacPorts-1.8.0

Download MacPorts from the MacPorts download directory: http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/

Run the package installer, to install the MacPorts infrastructure  
software to /opt/local/bin

Update the MacPorts installation by running the following command

$ sudo port selfupdate


Step 01.01: Install MacPorts gcc43

$ sudo port install gcc43


Step 02.00: Clone the official qt git source code repository

git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qt.git

Step 02.01: Checkout the qt-4.5 branch

cd qt
git checkout 4.5

Step 02.02: Clone the git branch

git clone . ../qt-4.5

Step 02.03: Configure qt-4.5

./configure -platform macx-g++ -cocoa -arch x86_64 -nomake examples - 
nomake demos -framework -sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/ -prefix / 
Developer/Applications/Qt-4.5

Step 02.04: Build qt-4.5

make -j 4

Qt is now configured for building. Just run 'make'.
Once everything is built, you must run 'make install'.
Qt will be installed into /Developer/Applications/Qt-4.5

To reconfigure, run 'make confclean' and 'configure'.

Step 02.05: Build qt-4.5 documentation

make docs

Step 02.06: Install qt-4.5

sudo make install

Step 02.07: Update the PATH environment variable to the qt  
installation?s binary folder

vi ~/.profile

# Qt-4.5
export PATH=/Developer/Applications/Qt-4.5/bin:$PATH


Step 03.00: Install CMake from the cvs repository

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous at www.cmake.org:/cvsroot/CMake login
(respond with password cmake)

Follow this command by checking out the source code:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous at www.cmake.org:/cvsroot/CMake co CMake


Bootstrap, build and install CMake

$ ./bootstrap
$ make
$ sudo make install


Step 04.00: Install Paraview from the cvs repository.

mkdir $HOME/Tool/ParaView
cd $HOME/Tool/ParaView

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView3 login
(respond with empty password)

Follow this command by checking out the source code:
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView3 co ParaView3

For checking out the data, use the following:
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView3 co  
ParaViewData

Configure ParaView using CMake

mkdir $HOME/Tool/ParaView/ParaView3-bin
cd $HOME/Tool/ParaView/ParaView3-bin
ccmake $HOME/Tool/ParaView/ParaView3

Press c to configure and select the following options

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS = ON
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI = ON
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON = ON

Build ParaView

make -j 4

sudo make install

Best regards,

Elvis

Just built Qt 4.5.3 and ParaView CVS successfully, and the stuff works.

First I had to build a universal dbus (1.2.16) with the following  
options (mostly taken from fink):

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dbus-1.2.16 --disable-static --enable- 
console-owner-file --with-dbus-user=messagebus --disable-asserts -- 
disable-tests --enable-checks --enable-kqueue --enable-launchd -- 
disable-userdb-cache --disable-ansi --with-xml=expat --disable-xml- 
docs --disable-doxygen-docs --without-x ac_cv_func_poll=no  
{CFLAGS,CXXFLAGS,LDFLAGS}='-arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -mmacosx- 
version-min=10.5 -sysroot=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk' --disable- 
dependency-tracking
make -j3
sudo make install

The dependency tracking is disabled because of the multiple -arch  
options which mess with the -M options used by autohell to generate  
the dependencies.

Then I built Qt-Cocoa-4.5.3 with the following set of options (this  
takes hours!):

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/dbus-1.2.16/lib/pkgconfig: 
$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
echo yes | ./configure -qt-sql-sqlite -cocoa -universal -arch x86_64 - 
opensource -sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk -dbus-linked -release
make -j3
sudo make install

And finally, my slightly customized and patched-up ParaView (http://github.com/themiwi/ParaView3-enhancements

Subject: [Paraview] OverView 0.7.0 alpha: empty "Data" menu with Xcode build
	target
Message-ID: <4314f7000910231516i4bece3f5j26513d44fde75cdd@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to build OverView from the ParaView CVS source tree using
Xcode 3.1.3 on Mac OS X 10.5.8 using the instructions here:

    https://www.kitware.com/InfovisWiki/index.php/Building_OverView

The build appears to be successful, when I run
./bin/debug/OverView.app, the "Data" menu is empty. When I configure
CMake to use Makefile targets instead of Xcode, the "Data" menu
contains four items: GeoRandomGraphSource, RandomGraphSource,
SQLDatabaseGraphSource and SQLDatabaseTableSource. By selecting
SQLDatabaseTableSource, I can connect to a DB, run a query and select
data to create a plot.

I know the most common Mac build target is Makefiles, but I would like
to extend OverView and would like to take advantage of Xcode, rather
than being stuck with gdb, for debugging.

Has anybody encountered this empty-menu issue before? How did you resolve it?

Thanks,

Zak

Message-ID: <4314f7000910231524o71c72645u9472ce9a747c54da@mail.gmail.com>

Following up on my previous message about building the OverView client
in the ParaView3 CVS tree, it occurred to me that I don't know if my
Makefile-based build might also be broken, albeit in a less obvious
way than an empty Data menu.

There are all kinds of test applications generated along with the OverClient:

but I didn't find any documentation about how to run them in a
systematic way, or what the tests do.

Does anybody have instructions or advice?

Hi Mark,

Here are what I have tried within my custom reader panel (a subclass
of pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel) so far and working fine for me. But I
may be wrong as Fabian reported the third one didn't for him.
( http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-October/014074.html )

  // 1. If one is happy with only updating the active view
  if(this->view()) // may be null if no active view is present
    {
    this->view()->render();
    }

  // 2. All relevant views may be rendered this way, where Ps is a
  // pqPipelineSource (a subclass of pqProxy) passed to the constructor
  // of the reader panel class
  this->Ps->renderAllViews();

  // 3. All views including irrelevant ones may be rendered by
  pqApplicationCore::instance()->render();

  // 4. Or there may be another way something like
  vtkSMProxyIterator *pIt = vtkSMProxyIterator::New();
  pIt->SetModeToOneGroup();
  for(pIt->Begin("views"); !pIt->IsAtEnd(); pIt->Next())
    {
    vtkSMViewProxy::SafeDownCast(pIt->GetProxy())->StillRender();
    }
  pIt->Delete();

Fabulous! I had only looked at the OverView build instructions, not
the ParaView build page, which does mention ctest under the headline,
"Test VTK with the Parallel BGL"

    https://www.kitware.com/InfovisWiki/index.php/Dev:Building_Software

Curiously, the SQL test passed with my Xcode build:

      2/356 Testing QVTK-TestQtSQLDatabase           Passed

even though the Data menu is missing the SQLDatabaseGraphSource and
SQLDatabaseTableSource items. Hmmmmmm. Ah well; knowing how to test is
a great start.

Thanks!

Zak

Interestingly, building OverView for Windows XP using the MinGW/Msys
target in CMake suffers the same problem.

My first MinGW attempt failed (see
http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-August/013379.html) but I
was able to get everything to compile by building HDF5 outside the
ParaView source tree, and configuring PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 to ON.
But, just like the Xcode build, everything compiles but since the Data
menu is empty, I don't have a way to connect my database.

Stumped,

Zak

someone take a look at these? All I've tried to do so far is set the

If we can get this basic framework working I'm sure I can figure out

Hi David,
I have to expose a lot of native VTK filters that are not in ParaView. I
never had to use a CMakeLists and a _GUI XML. In my mind, your input
properties should be totally described in your ICP. xml file. For example on
how to write proxy property elements, you should take a look at
Paraview3/Servers/ServerManagers/Resources/filtering.xml. It was sufficient
for me for many VTK filters, before I bought for the Paraview book.

steps:
   - write your xml description of the wanted VTK filter
   - run ParaView
   - Tools -> Manage Plugin/Extension
   - "Load New"
   - choose "Files of type" -> *.xml
   - pick your file -> OK

Then your filter should appear in the filters list.

Hope that helps
Jerome

Jerome,

Thanks for the example. It is really nice not having to write the GUI
manually, in most cases this automatic window that pops up should be
sufficient. Is there any advantage of compiling into a library before
loading into paraview?

I tried to modify your file into my ICP filter. However, when I try to
load my modified version, Paraview simply crashes as soon as I select
the ICP filter from the filters menu. The only changes I made were to
change the input types from vtkImageData to vtkDataSet and remove the
rest of the properties, leaving only Source and Target. I tried
port_index of the second input as 0 and 1 (what does this actually
do?) with no change. Would you mind taking a look at the attached
file?

Thanks,

David

Hi,

I took a look at your xml, and I didn't find any problems... So I verify in
the VTK doc if you didn't misused the vtkIterativeClosestPointTransform,
that I never had to work with. Especially, I checked the input data types
(that was one of my major crashes' cause!) and I found that this filter is
not a vtkAlgorithm (in the OO sense). And I think, but ParaView developers
have to confirm this, that the ParaView proxy -that's what you described in
your XML- concept is linked to vtkAlgorithm.

If I am right, you cannot use the "Enabling VTK filters in ParaView"
wiki-way. In your case, you certainly will have to write a subclass of
vtkAlgorithm that outputs a matrix of transformation.

Sorry for not being of more helps...

Jerome

Ah, that makes a lot of sense. I need to use a
vtkTransformPolyDataFilter and set the input of this filter to the
output of the vtkIterativeClosestPointTransform. Is this something
that can be chained together in paraview? Or do I need to make a VTK
filter that does all of this in one step and interface to the new
filter with Paraview?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Disabling polygon offset (z-fighting prevention) in
	Paraview
Message-ID: <4AE54772.3060502@web.de>

Hi -

I use Paraview not for visualizing datasets, but for inspecting 
polygonal meshes and the operations I perform on them. My work involves 
computing various points and line segments on meshes, and I use 
VTK/Paraview to see if the points and line segments are where they ought 
to be (if not, I conclude that there's a bug in my code and then proceed 
to hunt it down).

<Digression>
Why I use VTK for this task: VTK is the the only publicly available 3d 
graphics file format I'm aware of that explicitly supports and points, 
lines, and meshes, and has a viewer for viewing these entities. Most 
other 3d graphics file formats either support surfaces alone or have no 
ready-made viewers.
</Digression>

Lately however, upon closer inspection, I've noticed that many of the 
points and line segments that I compute appear to hover above the mesh 
they are computed from and never quite touch it, and points never seem 
to lie on the line segments they are supposed to. For example, see:
http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b52/videohead/SurfaceError.png
(note that the yellow line segment hover above the blue surface in the 
horizon)

After much experimentation, debugging and consultation, I now suspect 
that this is caused by polygon offset in Paraview, designed to prevent 
z-fighting. I would therefore like to know:

(i.) if my suspicion is correct i.e. Paraview implement polygon offset 
for preventing z-fighting in this case

(ii.) if the above is true, how polygon offset can be disabled without 
recompiling the source

Thanks,

- Olumide

If someone confirms that paraview proxy have to represent a vtkAlgorithm or
one of its subclass, that will mean that you cannot use
vtkIterativeClosestPointTransform directly as in the paraview pipeline. And
yes, you got it, a custom VTK class would be needed to embed the pipeline
connection and the transformation computation.

Subject: [Paraview] Communicating with a Paraview (GUI) server
Message-ID: <4AE56EFE.2080706@web.de>

Hi -

I'm aware that Paraview operates/implements a client-server paradigm. 
This suggests that it may be possible for an external (e.g. C++ 
application) to communicate with a running instance of Paraview, by 
sending it commands (e.g. open legacy VTK file) via the port attached to 
the server.

I'd appreciate pointers on how to do this.

Thanks,

I believe all the entries in the data menu are part of the Infovis plugin.
Verify that PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_Infovis is on. If it already is, my next
assumption is that the plugin does not load correctly ... you can try
manually loading it from the Manage Plugins dialog and see what happens.

(Replying back to the ParaView mailing list.)

It sounds like you are still linking to the system OpenGL libraries somehow.  Those symbols should be defined in the libGL.so that is built with Mesa (whereas the /usr/lib/libGL.so on your system probably does not have them).  Did you do a clean build of ParaView (that is, delete the binary directory and start over from scratch)?  If you just tried to change some CMake variables in an existing build, you may have some stale libraries built.

You should also check to make sure that the executables being built are linking to your compiled Mesa libraries instead of the system libraries.  You can check this with the ldd command.  You may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6.

Hi Ken,

Do you think there is something went wrong installing Mesa?
Can you help us?

Thank you again.

2009/10/21 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov>
Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on each node downloading the .deb packages with:

apt-get install libosmesa6

Have you got any other idea?
Thank you again.

Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.

Hi Jerome,

I assume once you load your xml plugin from the plugin_loader, and
check the "Auto Load" checkbox, the next time you start paraview, your
xml plugin is loaded automatically, no? Also, you can set up an
environment variable "PV_PLUGIN_PATH", which paraview will search by
default to load plugins automatically.

Now regarding the warning message, I believe it is due to the new
addition to ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro in ParaViewPlugins.cmake (see
below), and the version shown in the plugin_loader_GUI refers to
plugin "Version" you set when calling ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN in
CMakeLists.txt

 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(Name Version
    [REQUIRED_ON_SERVER]
    [REQUIRED_ON_CLIENT]
    [REQUIRED_PLUGINS pluginname1 pluginname2]
   ...)

New optional arguments for ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN:

 REQUIRED_ON_SERVER is to specify whether this plugin should be loaded on server
 REQUIRED_ON_CLIENT is to specify whether this plugin should be loaded on client
 REQUIRED_PLUGINS is to specify the plugin names that this plugin
depends on; Currently this ARG only allow plugin names, and we should
later also allow plugin versions to be specified.

For a client side only plugin, REQUIRED_ON_CLIENT should be specified;
For a server side only plugin, REQUIRED_ON_SERVER should be specified;
if a plugin has both server and client components in it,
REQUIRED_ON_SERVER and REQUIRED_ON_CLIENT should both be specified,
which is also the default. If only one is specified, the other one
will be set to false. For example, if REQUIRED_ON_SERVER is specified

 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(Name Version
    [REQUIRED_ON_SERVER]
    ...)

This plugin will have REQUIRED_ON_SERVER be true, REQUIRED_ON_CLIENT be false.

HTH,

Yumin

Theoretically yes. But in practice having multiple clients connected
to the same server is an open problem because the server was written
with the assumption that it has only one client controlling it. There
is slightly more support in the code for having the client connected
to multiple other processes (pvservers or possibly something else) but
it is not a well traveled path either.

Utkarsh has done the most work in these direction. He has gotten as
far as having a proof of concept prototype working for a Phase I SBIR.
But finishing the work is the subject of a Phase II SBIR that he is
about to start in on.

In summary, ParaView can't do it now without modifications. The
modifications are non trivial. And we are working on it.

Hi Yumin,

Thanks a lot for your interest !! However...

That's my problem: it is not loaded even in this case... Attached is a
minimal xml that exposes vtkImageMathematics to paraview filter list. I
cannot auto-load it.

Yes, my CMakeLists contains the version specification for the cxx plugins.
But thank you for the update about REQUIRED_PLUGINS, I was hoping that it
will solve my problem. So I set the PVCustomizer (cxx plugin, version "1.0"
in the CMakeLists) requiring the XML "ParaviewVTK". But I cannot load
"ParaviewVTK", so making the former depending on the latter is quite
awkward... Finally, you made me progressing and I have a more precise
question :
   - How to set the version of a plugin that is only an XML description of
VTK filters? -ie I don't have a CMakeLists for this...-

Thanks again Yumin!

Hi Jerome,

You can try to compile your xml into a plugin, which will also solve
your the Version problem

Check "Enabling a filter in VTK" section on the wiki:

Subject: [Paraview] network created with box glyphs and tubes
In-Reply-To: <e7f43c4f0910230101r1639f217pe9173d5ca00759c9@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C70B282C.E496%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I don't think that is going to work.  If you transform the tubes, the entire lattice will rotate whereas I think Sreejith wants each tube to rotate around its center.

I know of no straightforward way to do this in ParaView.  The problem is that the tube filter is designed to create round tubes, and any visible facets are just an artifact of that.  Even if you were able to rotate the tubes, the shading would still be wrong; the normals are oriented to make the polygons look rounded instead of flat.

Attached is a Python script that, in a roundabout way, creates square links oriented the way you want with a sequence of filters (including one from the Moments plugin, which you will have to load to get it to work).  The basic sequence is to create a cell vector field array that captures the length and orientation of the lines, then run cell centers, then glyph the centers using the vectors for orientation and scaling.  This of course is actually quite ugly to set up (which is why I captured it in a script), and there is the additional problem that if your lines are different lengths, the links' widths will be scaled along with their lengths.  If you need to do this frequently, you may need to resort to creating your own version of the tube filter.

if your links are independent polydatas, you can simply apply a transform filter with a 90deg-rotation to the ouput of your tube filters.

Paraview,

I am trying to create a network with some cubic pores connected by square links. For the pores, I applied the box glyphs and for getting square links, I applied the tube filter with 4 sides. And the final picture
is attached.  Now if we look, the square cross section of the link lying diagonal to the cubic cross section. What i would like to have the cubic pores and square cross section aligned parallel. How can I do that? Any tips?

thank you

Subject: [Paraview] Hide Cells/Points
Message-ID: <55218.72559.qm@web110105.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm programming a plugin for ParaView, whose purpose is to be a pre-processor for a finite element simulator. It is all based in selecting nodes or elements, and defining some regions - based on these - so that one can attribute boundary conditions to them. The main challenge seems to assure that the user will be able to select EVERY node or element he wants. So I'm treating all kind of selections, but I'm stucked in some problems and I have some questions:

1-Why the "New Range" button in the Selection Inspector is always deactivated ? Is this option already implemented in ParaView ? 

2-It would be pretty useful if the user could select all the nodes/cells in an coordinates interval. Is there anyway to do this ? Selection based on location only allows me to select one coordinate at a time, but I can't specify an interval. 

3-Is there anyway to "hide" selected cells/nodes ? I don't want to extract them with a filter (I would do this by just applying the Extract Selection filter) but just restrict the mesh in the screen to some subset. If I could do this, it would be easier (or even possible) to select some cells by picking. 

4-Finally, Is there anyway to control Frustum's shape or dimensions ? 

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,
Rafael March.

 Paraview
In-Reply-To: <4AE54772.3060502@web.de>
Message-ID: <C70B35FF.E4A1%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Utkarsh,

After reading this question from Olumide, I noticed that ParaView now turns on ZShift for lines and points (vtkProcessModule.cxx, 198-199).  I don't know why this is.  This effect is turned off when drawing surface+edges (vtkOpenGLCoincidentTopologyResolutionPainter.cxx, 56-58) because it automatically switches to offsetting the polygons the polygons back (vtkOpenGLRepresentationPainter.cxx, 79-85).  Should we remove those two lines from vtkProcessModule.cxx?

Hi -

I use Paraview not for visualizing datasets, but for inspecting
polygonal meshes and the operations I perform on them. My work involves
computing various points and line segments on meshes, and I use
VTK/Paraview to see if the points and line segments are where they ought
to be (if not, I conclude that there's a bug in my code and then proceed
to hunt it down).

<Digression>
Why I use VTK for this task: VTK is the the only publicly available 3d
graphics file format I'm aware of that explicitly supports and points,
lines, and meshes, and has a viewer for viewing these entities. Most
other 3d graphics file formats either support surfaces alone or have no
ready-made viewers.
</Digression>

Lately however, upon closer inspection, I've noticed that many of the
points and line segments that I compute appear to hover above the mesh
they are computed from and never quite touch it, and points never seem
to lie on the line segments they are supposed to. For example, see:
http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b52/videohead/SurfaceError.png
(note that the yellow line segment hover above the blue surface in the
horizon)

After much experimentation, debugging and consultation, I now suspect
that this is caused by polygon offset in Paraview, designed to prevent
z-fighting. I would therefore like to know:

(i.) if my suspicion is correct i.e. Paraview implement polygon offset
for preventing z-fighting in this case

(ii.) if the above is true, how polygon offset can be disabled without
recompiling the source

Thanks,

- Olumide

The best representation for your data is a poly data set with vertex cells, which can be a single point.  An unstructured grid, which also supports vertex cells, is fine, too.

The native VTK file formats provide reasonable ASCII representations of this data.  You can download documentation from the Wiki: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Image:VTK-File-Formats.pdf

If you already have your data in a text file with the data for each point on a line, you can use the csv reader to read this information as a table (you can change the comma delimiter to something else).  You can then use the table to points filter to convert this to geometric data.

The data were collected irregularly so can not be represented as structured points.

I thought I'd use an unstructured grid, but my data are not "cells" but are rather points with velocity associated with each point.

My questions: what data type should I use? Could someone provide an example data set or script to point out how to write the recommended data type?

Thanks! The plugin was failing to load, and the error message in the
Manage Plugins dialog pointed me to the problem, as did
/var/log/syslog, where I should have looked in the first place.

When building with Xcode, TWO version of OverView.app are generated:
one in ./bin that fails to launch ("You can't open the application
'OverView' because it is not supported on this architecture.") and
another at ./bin/Debug that launches but has no plugins directory
(i.e. ./bin/Debug/OverView.app/Contents/MacOS/OverView-startup is
missing). Happily, the broken application DOES have a plugins
directory containing all those missing plugins, and copying it into
the application bundle of the working application solves the problem.

I'm glad to have this working, but now I have a few more questions:

1. Why are two OverView.app bundles generated by Xcode?

2. When a plugin fails to load, should that generate an error message
such as, "Plugin XYZ failed to load"? When the plugins are missing, I
get an "Output Messages" dialog box that says, "Failed to create a
proxy for the requested view type." but that doesn't really hint at
the underlying problem.

Thanks for helping me get this resolved.

Cheers,

Zak

The issue with targeting MinGW on Windows XP was very similar: the
directory ./bin/OverView-startup contains a list of "timlink" files
which contain mis-named references to the plugins' DLLs. For example,
the file ./bin/OverView-startup/SQLDatabaseTableSourcePanelPlugin.dll.timlink
contains the text
"C:/projects/titan/pvmingw/bin/./SQLDatabaseTableSourcePanelPlugin.dll"
when it should contain,
"C:/projects/titan/pvmingw/bin/libSQLDatabaseTableSourcePanelPlugin.dll".

Editing the timlink files solved the problem.

Thanks Jerome and Ken. In my case, the Jerome's tip didn't work as the cube
itself was rotating while transforming.
I will try the work around suggested by Ken and see how it goes.
Many thanks for the tips.

Hi Yumin,

Compiling my XML to expose VTK native filters produces a so/dll library that
can be autoloaded in ParaView. However, I would take advantage on the fact
that this XML may be shared to somebodyelse without the need to own
"ParaView from source". The wiki says: "Alternatively, we can simply load
the XML from the *Plugins Manager* (just select the file type to be *.xml in
the file open dialog)". I want this because of deployment issues see thread
"About on-line available binaries for next release" )

- What have I to add in the XML to give him the same behaviour than its
corresponding compiled library?

Furthermore, I thought that my Autostart plugin (called "PVCustomizer") was
unable to autoload because it depends on my ParaviewVTK XML plugin. But that
is not the case: Even if I load the native VTK filters description with the
compiled version, my PVCustomizer is loadable through the GUI, but it shows
the message "Loaded, but .....\PVCustomizer.dll, is not a server manager
plugin!" and no version is displayed although my CMakeLists contains the
following lines:

##################################################
# AUTOSTART PLUGIN --------------------------------------------------
 QT4_WRAP_CPP(MOC_SRCS PVCustomizer.h)

# Macro for auto-start plugins. We specify the class name
# and the methods to call on startup and shutdown on an instance of that
class.
# It fills IFACES and IFACE_SRCS with proper values as needed by
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro.
 ADD_PARAVIEW_AUTO_START(IFACES IFACE_SRCS
   CLASS_NAME PVCustomizer # the class name for our class
   STARTUP onStartup   # specify the method to call on startup
   SHUTDOWN onShutdown # specify the method to call on shutdown
 )

# Create a plugin for this starter
 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(PVCustomizer "1.0"
   REQUIRED_ON_CLIENT

   SOURCES PVCustomizer.cxx ${MOC_SRCS} ${IFACE_SRCS}
   REQUIRED_PLUGINS ParaviewVTK)

 TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES( PVCustomizer VesselExtractionVTK )
######################################################################

I checked "Autoload", having no effect when I restart ParaView...

I looked at the sources, but I cannot understand now why this message is
displayed. I will give a try with a step-by-step procedure.

Thanks a lot for your time, Yumin, and sorry for disturbing...

Best regards,
Jerome

I think this is probably a bug if you check "Auto Load" for the xml,
but it still doesn't auto-load next time.
I suggest to log it in the bug tracker.

I assume you "Rebuilt" the plugin after the new changes, and it still

Thanks Yumin,

- For the XML auto-load failure, I will post it in the bug tracker. Do I
have access to mantis with an universal authentification? Or do I have to
request for a login/pass?

- For the autostart plugin that shows the warning, I will try with a minimal
build environment and post it as bug (if it is confirmed).

Best regards,
Jerome

Dataserver gathering to 0, 0.191303 seconds


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

I notice a relatively 'slow' rendering performance, so i wonder how the results are gathered back and rendered.

 

Case 1,

each process extracts the polygonal data, then send it back to process 0. 

process 0 gather all results, combine with its own, create the final images, then send it to the client

so process 0 is like the one gathering the jig saw puzzle and fixing them, then give the whole thing for the client to render

 

Case 2,

each process extracts the polygonal data, then send it back to process 0. 

process 0 gather all results, then send it to the client, 

the client creates a final image out of pieces of result collected from process 0

so client is the one getting the jig saw puzzle from process 0, fix them and render it

 

 

i'm not sure which case is right or both are wrong, but i do suspect that it will somehow effect the performance because my client has a lower specification compare to the server.

 

 

Any help / reply is highly appreciated!

 

Regards,

chewping

Subject: [Paraview] intersect with radial
Message-ID: <200910282138300005756@qq.com>

You can use vtkCellloctor or vtkOBBTree to intersect with a line. Now I have a radial not a line(just have the original point and direction ). What 

should I do to intersect with a polydata?

Hello,
I have a 3D view and I want to display the cube axes.  The title and labels
of the color legend can be modify with the color scale Editor.
Is it possible to do the same with the title and labels of the cube axes ?

Message-ID: <d7f4480f0910280741s26a23ecbt3872408f4a5dd3d5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm giving a talk this Friday in Second Life about ParaView and the
visualization plugin I am developing for it at The Meta Institute for
Computational Astrophysics (MICA), a professional scientific
organization based in Second Life.

Friday, October 30 at 10:00 AM PDT
Seminar- Christine Corbett Moran (University of Zurich)
ParaViz: A parallel visualization tool for astrophysical applications.
MICA small amphitheater: http://slurl.com/secondlife/StellaNova/75/210/31

The first half will be a basic introduction to VTK and ParaView, the
specifics of ParaView's parallel features, and a short introduction to
the ParaView plugin development process. The second half will be about
the features of my plugin, largely specific to astrophysics
applications. I hope to "see" some of you there. You first need to
setup a Second Life account, then you should be able to click on the
above slurl to "teleport" into the auditorium within the Second Life
application.

Cheers,
Christine

Hi,

I've noticed that the filters menu is greyed out after loading a valid  
data set on the version of paraview I built yesterday from cvs (also  
updated yesterday).  I have the same version of paraview built on an  
i386 mac using the Qt SDK instead of the Cocoa 32/64  framework, and  
it does not have this problem. Also, the filters appear to work (e.g.  
if I hit the isosurface button the filter runs correctly).  Any idea  
what is happening here? I believe somebody mentioned that the QtDBus  
framework is messed up in the Qt Cocoa package, maybe I just need to  
build Qt from source.

Thanks,
Chris

Subject: [Paraview] Stream Tracer crashes pvservers when the number of
 pvserver processes is larger than the number of dataset pieces
Message-ID: <20091029.010342.26502603.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I got a crash of 3.7-cvs as of 28/Oct/09 in client/server mode when I
tried to apply Stream Tracer to a dataset that had smaller number of
pieces than the number of pvserver processes.

To replicate:
Start ParaView in client/server mode with 9 pvserver processes,
* Open Iron_Protein.ImageData.xmf that comes with ParaViewData3.6
  (which has 8 dataset pieces)
* Select Filters->Stream Tracer
* Apply
Then pvservers crash (on OS X 10.6.1, Qt 4.5.3 Cocoa 64bit). If they
don't, further try to
* Delete to delete Stream Tracer
* Delete again to delete Iron_Protein.ImageData.xmf
Then pvservers crash (on Ubuntu 8.04 64bit, Qt 4.5.3, gcc 4.2.4).

There seems to be a bit of uncertainty in replication procedure across
platforms thus I have to hope the crash to replicate on the
developer's part. The tracker entry with some more details is
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9787

I believe that you can only modify the color of the axes, labels and
titles together. It is an option that is in the Edit dialog of the
cube axes.

I've run into this problem as well. I don't have a fix, but do have a
workaround... pressing the Alt+Space key will let you type in the name
of a filter to create it.

     Hope this helps,

Try this (assuming you have paraview cvshead or 3.6.2):

build your pipeline
open python dialog
click on trace tab
click start trace
move the camera how you want it
click stop trace
click save trace
click on the directory view tab, you should see a new python script,
you can select it and click Run Selected

Thanks. However, since I have Paraview 3.6.1 this is not possible for
me. Maybe I will have to switch since this python state files seem to be
very helpful. What is the difference betwwen the curren cvs and 3.6.2?
Thanks.

Hmm, I built it as a x86_64 binary with Qt-Cocoa 4.5.3 on OS X 10.6  
and I don't see this issue. Also, my i386/ppc universal binary built  
against the 10.5 SDK doesn't show this.

I built it myself, the binary from Nokia/Trolltech is buggy (the

Subject: [Paraview] Interpolation Problems with nfaced cells from ensight
	reader
Message-ID: <4AE8BD1B.5020404@yahoo.de>

Dear all,

I recently realises that there are interpolation problems on meshes
containing nfaced cells at the transition layer between finer and
coarser hexa mesh-regions. Is I color streamlines by velocity magnitude
I get extemely high velocities in these regions. Streamlines itself
looks reasonable. Is this a known issue?

Why no option to save/restore a camera state by click a button? I want use
this many time!! My feeling--It a little silly to make us use a python
feature for idea so basics.

Message-ID: <E5BD931F-B4B7-4188-8242-BBFB48C9556B@desktopaero.com>

Apologies if this is a dumb question - I'm investigating Paraview as a  
replacement for Tecplot, and one of the things I'd really like to do  
is take Cp slices on CFD geometries. I figured out how to make an XY  
plot of the slice data, but can't for the life of me figure out how to  
reverse the Y axis so that Cp displays the way aero people like to see  
it. (smaller numbers at the top, larger at the bottom).

Any help would be appreciated.

Hello everyone,

We are working on a project that targets to visualize large scale data. The
rendered image should be displayed in high resolution. So we have to use a
display wall , with one display showing only a part of the whole image. I
wonder if ParaView can directly support display wall, or I have to some
other software such as Chromium and DMX. If anyone have similar experience,
please let me know that. Your commet will be highly appreciated.

I wonder if the following is possible: Given a comma-separated value
file (.csv) with six fields. The first three fields are the
coordinates of the points and the last three fields are the associated
point normal vectors. For example:

134.3 232.2 123.3 1.0 0.0 0.0

with space as field separator.

Is it possible to visualize the point set and attach normal vectors to
points (as arrows for example)?

I tried to use TableToPoints filter for visualizing the normals but failed.

Any help appreciated.

Best regards,
Christoph

Hi Christoph,

Load the CSV data, use a TableToPoints filter, then a Calculator filter to
combine the last three fields to a vector (operation: "(iHat*Field
3)+(jHat*Field 4)+(kHat*Field 5)") and finally apply a Glyph filter with Glyph
type Arrow.

Hi all,

I am fighting again against these extent problems.
see threads:
   http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-January/010903.html
   http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-April/011674.html (for
the last mail, indeed)
   http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011334.html

I have an input volume with extent (0,511,0,511,0,109). I wrote a filter
that reslices this volume orthogonally along a spline curve
(Straightened-CPR). Thus the output extent does not depend on input extent
at all. If I want to see the structures around the spline, I can use, say,
about 15 voxels in the output x and y dimensions. The output's z dimension
will depend on the number of points of the spline.

My first problem was related to the outline that shows a different bounding
box than the information panel. In my case, having more than 110 points in
the curve made my output volume extent clip at 110 on z extent! I managed to
solve it by implementing the RequestUpdateExtent function. Now, the output
extent can be different than the input with -almost- no problem.

Now that I have a reliable output extent, I wish to slice the volume with a
"Slice" representation. Problem is: each time I change slice, the filter
updates!

In debug mode, the pipeline execution shows these function calls when change
current slice:

(I edited the debug output  for a more friendly reading)

  //! \bug RequestUpdateExtent set the filter to Modified each time it is
  //! called. One effect is to call RequestData when slicing through the
  //! output.

  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);

  int outExtent[6], inExtent[6], uExtent[6]; // uExtent is no more used...

  outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), outExtent);
  outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(), uExtent);
  inInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), inExtent);

  // clip the inExtent to the outExtent. Is it normal to do that???
  for( int i=0; i < 6; i+=2 )
  {
     if( inExtent[i] > outExtent[i] )
        inExtent[i] = outExtent[i];
     if( inExtent[i+1] < outExtent[i+1] )
        inExtent[i+1] = outExtent[i+1];
  }

  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(), inExtent,
6);

   return( 1 );
}

####################################################################

I have very big difficulties to understand the 'extent' concept in VTK. Is
there a detailed chapter on that in VTK books?
Or do I have to parse the code, step-by-step?

Thanks for your help.

Christoph + all,

Every time someone does something like this successfully that seems
like it is reasonably "common/reasonable" to want to do, I think we
should record it in a list of "how to do common things in paraview" on
the wiki. It seems unreasonable to expect users to figure out how to
turn this reasonable format of raw data into a simple visualization
using the suggested (only/best?) method, so we should at least provide
them somewhere to find what they are trying to do by keyword.

Just my $.02.

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <522fad9c0910290458w400b1465we1be407f1aeedd78@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been trying to get netCDF support to work with paraview 3.6.1

There is a previous thread on the subject, which I find a bit confusing.

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011585.html

Initially I tried to build as plugins, but cmake gave the warning that
plugins have been disabled, and shared libraries should be used when I
tryed that.

I downloaded the svn source given in the thread above
(https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/) then tried to build a
shared library adding
CSCSCommon;CSCSNetCDF to PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE.

This then fails to build with the error :

vtkMultiBlockUnstructuredSurface.cpp:41:32: error:
vtkModifiedBSPTree.h: No such file or directory

Any suggestions welcome

ParaView 3.6.1 comes with a netCDF reader.  You should be able to just select a netCDF file and it will load (with caveats about netCDF being more of an IO level than a format and the ParaView reader will make assumptions).  ParaView will expect the extension to be .ncdf or .nc, but any extension should work so long as it does not conflict with the extensions of other readers (that are not smart enough to determine their own file format).

Hi,

I'm using Paraview 3.4.0 on Linux. When I want to rescale scalar fields
automatically to the data range, it rescales to the range [0,1] even
though the real range is sth. totally different. This problem occured
spontanously (yesterday it worked fine for the same data sets).
Does anyone know this problem and is there a solution?

Thanks

Hi Alessandro,

please, reply to the list so that anyone having the answer could... well,
answers.
As you said, this is a warning, not an error. Do you get the expected
output? I get this warning when I don't give good settings to the Delaunay
filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Serial remote views of distributed data
Message-ID: <BEC6A4E7-8C19-4A86-A646-4545907D7F17@sandia.gov>

Hi all,

I'm looking to convert a (currently serial) VTK application into a  
ParaView-style client (one that talks to a distributed set of pvserver  
processes) and have a few questions about pqView, distributed data,  
and remote display. My situation is that I have
1. large-distributed datasets as sources
2. pipelines which extract very small subsets of the data from #1
3. several vtkView subclasses which do 3-d rendering/interaction of  
the subsets from #2 in a non-parallel way, and
4. clients which will be run on machines without decent 3-D rendering  
hardware.

I would like to create new pqView classes that collect data from the  
distributed pvservers to the rank 0 process, do the rendering on the  
rank 0 pvserver process (using the serial vtkViews), and use  
ParaView's remote image delivery mechanism to present the images to  
the client.

Are there existing views that do this? Is the view the place where all  
of this should be performed or are there other places where the data  
aggregation should take place? I see that some of the OverView plugins  
are client-side views but really what I'm looking for is rendering on  
the rank 0 pvserver process, not the client.

	Thanks,
	David

You can then view the selected  data points using the 'Spreatsheet view'
or the 'Selection inspector' panel. These two give you the option to
de-select part of you selection. 
 
Is there a plugin which sets up a toolbar with which you can activate a
similar rubber band mechanism as with the 'Selection Control' toolbar
only this one will give you the option to partly de-select?

(Responding back to the ParaView list.)

These symbols should be defined in the GL library that is part of Mesa.  You should have a library like /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so.  That is where the symbols should be defined.  libOSMesa.so simply references those libraries.  It is because the symbols cannot be found in the GL library that you are getting the error.  You can use the 'nm' command to query what symbols are defined are what are required.

It sounds like you are still linking to the system OpenGL libraries somehow.  Those symbols should be defined in the libGL.so that is built with Mesa (whereas the /usr/lib/libGL.so on your system probably does not have them).


Hi Ken,
thanks again.

Looking the errors such as:

"home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_free_context_data'"

I believe those symbols must be defined in libOSMesa.so library and not in /usr/lib/libGL.so library.

In fact, if we install OSMessa using Debian packages we can compile ParaView, but we can't connect client and server; the error always is similar to:

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

Executing with: 0
*** Process received signal ***

*** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


If instead we compile OSMesa ourselves we can't compile ParaView: I believe that something went wrong compiling OSMesa (some simbols aren't present in libOSMesa.so created), but I don't know if compiling OSMesa ourselves can help us to resolve our problem.

We also tried to install on our cluster ParaView 3.6.1already compiled (downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html) and it works: we can establish client-server connection.

But if we try to run more 2 or more pvserver instances on the same node (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), we have this error:

"vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x23d6da0): Failed to set up server socket"


 Did you do a clean build of ParaView (that is, delete the binary directory and start over from scratch)?  If you just tried to change some CMake variables in an existing build, you may have some stale libraries built.

We did "make clean".

You should also check to make sure that the executables being built are linking to your compiled Mesa libraries instead of the system libraries.  You can check this with the ldd command.  You may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6.

We also tried to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Can you help us?

Hi Ken,
thank you.
We compiled Mesa with:

./configure --enable-gl-osmesa --disable-gallium
make
make install

and we configured Paraview with:

OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-.6/include
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGLU.so
OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/include
OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/include
OSMESA_LIBRARY=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so

but we have many error compiling Paraview; for example:

/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_free_context_data'
/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_get_current_context'
/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_enable_2_1_extensions'

Do you think there is something went wrong installing Mesa?
Can you help us?

Thank you again.

Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

Hi Ken,

No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on each node downloading the .deb packages with:

apt-get install libosmesa6
apt-get install libosmesa6-dev

Have you got any other idea?
Thank you again.

2009/10/20 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov <http://kmorel at sandia.gov>  <http://kmorel at sandia.gov> >
Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

Segmentation fault


This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

111/475 Testing TestGradientBackground        ***Exception: SegFault

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

If you need more information let us now

Thank you very much

Changing the number of output ports during execution is not
recommended (if it's possible at all). An alternative is writing an
algorithm that produces a vtkMultiBlockDataSet with number of blocks
changing with user specification.

Message-ID: <246B0C48-B365-43A1-A185-79A51B1EDCDE@me.com>

Hi,
        I've built paraview-3.7.0 from the cvs sources, and when I run  
sudo make install, it installs it into the Developer/Applications  
folder as ParaView-3.7.0. However, when I launch it, it crashes  
immediately.

It however, works when I try to run it from the ParaView3-bin/bin  
folder which contains the compiled binaries. Is there a fix for this?  
What could the reason be? I am using qt-4.5.4.



Best regards,

Elvis

Hi Michael & all,

With OS X 10.6.1 + Qt 4.5.3/Cocoa/x86_64 + PV 3.7 builds I've run into
either the occasional greyed out filters when launched in-place
without make install or crashes at startup after make install. So I
tried your ParaView3-enhancements
( http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-October/014246.html )
and indeed it works perfectly at least in builtin server mode after
running make install (really great). I wonder what is the secret about
your "enhancements"?

Ken,

Offsetting the points/lines handles the cases when people try to
render two overlapping datasets: one as surface and other as
wireframe, and they don't necessarily want to show surface with edges
(say they want scalar coloring for both surface and the wireframe). I
believe Jean Favre has several such use cases.

Oluminde,

It makes sense to provide an option in the "Settings" dialog to
tweak/disable offsetting for resolving z-fighting. I've added a
feature request to the bug tracker:
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9801

To fix this without recompiling, here's a crazy hack to overcome this
issue in builtin mode (i.e. when not connected to server):
Before loading any datasets
* open python shell
* Run the following commands:
  > import os
  > if os.name == "posix":
  >      from libvtkRendering.so import vtkMapper
  > else:
  >      from vtkRenderingPython import vtkMapper
  > vtkMapper.SetResolveCoincidentTopologyToOff()

If connected to a server, you can run the same python commands as part
of the python script for a programmable source or filter.

Any vtk object that needs to be treated as a filter or source has to
be a vtkAlgorithm subclass. Also whenever you use <SourceProxy /> tag,
it assumes that the vtk-class referred to by the  "class" attribute is
a vtkAlgorithm subclass.

That's interesting. Let me take a look at this. The goal of
default_servers.pvsc was indeed to support the use-case as you
describe, where the site-administrator can change the configuration
file and all the "users" get the updated configuration. Since this
code passed through many hands, there may have been some confusion
with this. I'll keep you posted.

Is it safe to assume that the github Kitware/ParaView repository will be around for a while?

Message-ID: <5a74a9fd0910300728s1f6b142fn7fa113266fd0499e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using Paraview 3.7.0 under Fedora 11. But it constantly freezes the
laptop when try to open files such as .vtp or .vti and I have to manually
reboot. This is annoying.
The video card on the laptop is "Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset
Integrated Graphics Controller".

Any suggestions?

Thanks
Siqi

Hi,

I am running Fedora 11 as well, but with ATI card. Are you experiencing this
problem with *every* vti/vtp files? or only with a few? In the latter case,
the best you can do is to post the concerned files if they are not too
heavy, or to give an url where we can find it.

Best regards,
Jerome

First, try generating some simple data via the sources menu. Ie, a
sphere. Does it crash showing that?

Next try changing the Render View->General Settings. For example
Immediate Mode Rendering to turns on/off GL display lists, similarly
toggle Triangle Strips, and Depth peeling. Which of those settings (if
any) break or fix it?

It has been there for a few months. I am not sure what "official" is
:-) We push our git repo which directly tracks cvs there. It is a
read-only repo of course.

That's great! If it's maintained by you guys, that's "official enough"  
for me ;-) Now I can finally get rid of my own mirror.

Just out of curiosity: Do you use the -k flag with git-cvsimport? The  
man-page says that it's highly recommended, but broke things for me.  
When I used it, some commits got lost which was quite a PITA.

Michael

Hi Berk,

Is it be possible to have an http acces to this mirror (it would be very 
handy to access it over a proxy)?

Okay.
Strangely enough just after sending off my query, I am now getting an
error 404 on most of the repositories (including
http://github.com/Kitware).  Oh well, I'll wait and see...

Hi, Jerome,

This is the weird part. It doesn't crash at specific files. It seems like a
random event.

Thanks

Hi, Dave

None of these procedures make it crash. The thing I experienced is that
sometimes (not every time), when you open some random files and click
"apply", it will crash.

Thanks

Hi all,

Just to add a data point, I compiled dbus and Qt 4.5.3 from source on  
OS X 10.5.8(x86_64) and still have greyed out filters in PV 3.7. I'm  
interested in what the enhancements do as well.

This sounds like a job for a debugger. gdb paraview and you should get
a stack trace. Better yet build in a debug mode and you can get to a
line number.

Woooo... If it is possible for you to trace a debug built, it could give
useful information. However, I precise my question: are you experiencing
-sometimes- this crash with your files, or it happens also on common files,
such as the one you can find in ParaViewData?

Waiting for your debug trace ;)

Even if the clone only mentions the git: protocol, you can also use a
http transport.

git://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git
or
http://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git


Depending on your site, you might also be able to use an ssh tunnel.
Eg,
    ssh -N -L 2203:github.com:9418 SOMEHOST
and then
    git://localhost:2203/Kitware/ParaView.git

/none

Hi,

I forgot to mention that  the whole computer freezes when this happens.
I tried to write the debug information to a file by using
gdb paraview &> error.txt
, but there is no error report in the file after I reboot. So it must be
that the computer crashes before any error is written to the file.

What should I do now?

Thanks
Siqi

I just wrote this one up as bug number 9805.  We really should have this functionality in ParaView.

Thanks for catching this one.

Lucy,

So you are trying to build VTKEdge with Paraview 3.6.1, is that correct? Are
you sure the build is succeeding? If I am not mistaken, the ParaView plugin
in VTKEdge uses features that were added to CVS ParaView (that aren't
present in 3.6.* releases) and hence it cannot work with 3.6 releases. Try
using CVS ParaView.

Hi,
If this is a complete freeze, I think that this is not linked to ParaView. I
had this problem on my laptop when running Firefox with more than one tab.
However, this freeze was reported for ATI card. But, as far as I know, Intel
cards show a series of problem under Linux.

Sorry for not being of more help.

Regarding your debug info: if nothing is written in the output file, I
*really* expect ParaView for not being the cause of the freeze...

Where can I get the ./configure program. I just checked out dbus from  
the git repository and I switched to the dbus-1.2 branch. I can't find  
a ./configure program to configure dbus for Mac OS X.

Any help would be appreciated.

Christoph + all,

Every time someone does something like this successfully that seems
like it is reasonably "common/reasonable" to want to do, I think we
should record it in a list of "how to do common things in paraview" on
the wiki. It seems unreasonable to expect users to figure out how to
turn this reasonable format of raw data into a simple visualization
using the suggested (only/best?) method, so we should at least provide
them somewhere to find what they are trying to do by keyword.

Just my $.02.

Thanks,

David

Can't use just use the existing 3D view by internally shutting off distributed rendering for that view, which will cause the geometry to be delivered to the client?

Hi all,

I'm looking to convert a (currently serial) VTK application into a
ParaView-style client (one that talks to a distributed set of pvserver
processes) and have a few questions about pqView, distributed data,
and remote display. My situation is that I have
1. large-distributed datasets as sources
2. pipelines which extract very small subsets of the data from #1
3. several vtkView subclasses which do 3-d rendering/interaction of
the subsets from #2 in a non-parallel way, and
4. clients which will be run on machines without decent 3-D rendering
hardware.

I would like to create new pqView classes that collect data from the
distributed pvservers to the rank 0 process, do the rendering on the
rank 0 pvserver process (using the serial vtkViews), and use
ParaView's remote image delivery mechanism to present the images to
the client.

Are there existing views that do this? Is the view the place where all
of this should be performed or are there other places where the data
aggregation should take place? I see that some of the OverView plugins
are client-side views but really what I'm looking for is rendering on
the rank 0 pvserver process, not the client.

        Thanks,
        David

I'm pretty sure there is an open bug in the tracker for this feature request.  I cannot check it as I type this as I am on a plane, but someone may want to keep me honest.

Of course, if you are unhappy with the progress of any bug, remember that ParaView is an open source project and anyone is welcome to volunteer code.

(Responding back to ParaView list.)

No clue.  This still looks like a problem with library linking mismatch to me (although I could be wrong).  Even though the error does not specify the OpenGL library, I would still check that.  That is the library that I find is most likely to cause trouble.

Hi Kein
I apologize again.

We recompiled ParaView this time using BUILD_SHARED_LIBS = OFF (not ON), and the error on the library /usr/lib/libGL.so is gone.
Now it remains the error on the library /lib/libpthread.so.0:

Client connected.

Have you any idea?

Thank you very much.

It sounds like you are still linking to the system OpenGL libraries somehow.  Those symbols should be defined in the libGL.so that is built with Mesa (whereas the /usr/lib/libGL.so on your system probably does not have them).


Hi Ken,
thanks again.

Looking the errors such as:


"home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_free_context_data'"

I believe those symbols must be defined in libOSMesa.so library and not in /usr/lib/libGL.so library.

In fact, if we install OSMessa using Debian packages we can compile ParaView, but we can't connect client and server; the error always is similar to:


ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

If instead we compile OSMesa ourselves we can't compile ParaView: I believe that something went wrong compiling OSMesa (some simbols aren't present in libOSMesa.so created), but I don't know if compiling OSMesa ourselves can help us to resolve our problem.

We also tried to install on our cluster ParaView 3.6.1already compiled (downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html) and it works: we can establish client-server connection.

But if we try to run more 2 or more pvserver instances on the same node (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), we have this error:

"vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x23d6da0): Failed to set up server socket"


 Did you do a clean build of ParaView (that is, delete the binary directory and start over from scratch)?  If you just tried to change some CMake variables in an existing build, you may have some stale libraries built.

We did "make clean".

You should also check to make sure that the executables being built are linking to your compiled Mesa libraries instead of the system libraries.  You can check this with the ldd command.  You may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6.

We also tried to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Can you help us?

Hi Ken,

We compiled Mesa with:

./configure --enable-gl-osmesa --disable-gallium
make
make install

and we configured Paraview with:

OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=/home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so

but we have many error compiling Paraview; for example:

Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on each node downloading the .deb packages with:

apt-get install libosmesa6

Have you got any other idea?
Thank you again.

Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67

This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

If you need more information let us now

I saw the message, what I am doing should be able to accommodate this type of 
layout, I will test this out later just to confirm. So something akin to 
setting the minimum Y value to 5.0 and the maximum Y value to 0.0?

Any example plots you may be able to point out would help me.

I want neither distributed rendering nor geometry rendered at the  
client... I'd like geometry rendered on the rank 0 pvserver and image  
delivery to the client. Is that possible? (Well, OK, I know it's  
possible but how hard will it be?)

Thanks for your replies. This example (from ensight) is somewhat ugly,

Yes ParaView supports tiled display walls.

The server must be compiled from source to enable MPI because except
for Mac, none of the binaries on the paraview download page have MPI
turned on.

After that, simply start pvserver with the -tdx and -tdy arguments to
specify the width and height (in terms of number of monitors). The
first tdx x tdy server nodes drive the wall. They and the rest of the
server nodes take part in parallel rendering and then compositing to
fill them. The preferences page has parameters that you can use to
help maintain interactivity (LOD and downsampling during camera motion
etc).

Hi Eric,

I just tried reversing the axis direction, and using my new, experimental line 
chart code. Simply setting the y axis minimum to 1.0 and the maximum to -1.0 
did the right thing. That was very encouraging, these charts will be making 
their way into VTK and ParaView once they are ready.

Zhanping,

I do not think this is an ensight import problem since everything
imports quite fine. However veloity interpolation on calculated
streamlines goes wrong in the area of these nfaced elements. IS this known?

Hi Marcus,

That's great news. Is it possible to estimate a timeframe to see these  
changes? Being new to ParaView, is this type of change something that  
will be rolled out in some sort of incremental/maintenance release, or  
is it more like a feature for a major release?

Rick,
To be honest, I didn't even realize that there was a servers.pvsc in the home directory.  The first place that ParaView looks for GUI connection information is in your Paraview install area.  On our LANS, this is  .../3.6.2/Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.6 (which is really wherever_paraviews_root_is/lib/paraview-3.6)  I have a default_servers.pvsc in there.

For standalone Linux installs, I put this default_servers.pvsc in the same place .../local_paraview_base/lib/paraview-3.6.

In XP it goes in the ParaView install directory - c:/Program Files/ParaView 3.6.2/bin.

Give me a call if you want to discuss.

Alan

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.6.x connection definition files

I have questions regarding the use of connection definition files.

I have created numerous connection definition files for various clusters
and compute systems that we have here.     Up until now, I've been
distributing those pvsc files through a common directory that all of my
users have access to.   They manually load the pvsc files into their
session, and those server definitions get automatically saved into
$HOME/.config/ParaView/servers.pvsc.         The connection definition
files work great and are a huge time saver for Paraview users -
particularly in an environment where we need to establish SSH tunnels,
modify ports and connection IDs, etc.

The problem lies in what happens when I want to change one or more of
those pvsc files (presumably to incorporate a change that will improve
functionality, performance, etc 8-)     I update the pvsc file in the
common directory, and then I need to notify all of my Paraview users
that there's an update to the PVSC files and that they need to
delete/replace their existing definition with a new one.   This scenario
is awkward and requires some effort on the users' part - it would be
nice if there were a more automatic solution.

So, I've been looking at using a default_servers.pvsc file which in
theory is a great idea.   All users would have access to a common pvsc
file that I can control and update as necessary, with no updates
required by the user.   Well, unfortunately, it doesn't seem to really
work that way.    The default_servers.pvsc file is read in the first
time ParaView is loaded, and then those server definitions are saved
back to the $HOME/.config/ParaView directory.  The servers are
presumably saved off to preserve some of the information as defined in
the PVSC file - I have numerous fields (UserID, ProjectID, SSH
executable labeled with "save=true" so that that information is carried
over between sessions.

This is where we start to run into problems.     According to the WIKI,
the last server definition loaded take precedence, so if I make changes
to the "default_servers.pvsc" file,  it gets loaded prior to
"$HOME/.config/ParaView/servers.pvsc".     Unless I'm missing something,
once the server definitions are initialized the first time they are
recognized and saved off to the user's .config directory, the default
servers will never have precedence, even if I change/update the
contents.  Unless the ServerName is changed for each subsequent update
of a particular server, any updated server in the default servers file
won't be loaded.    Am I on the right track here - have I missed or
assumed something that I shouldn't have?    It looks like all of the
hooks are *almost* there to manage the server definitions .....

Also, using 3.6.1, I went through the process of created a
default_servers.pvsc, having those servers automatically loaded in my
ParaView session, and then have them saved off into a local servers.pvsc
file.  However, during the next Paraview session, the definitions don't
work properly - it seems as those the only the last item in an
enumerated list are available through the GUI, and in general it just
doesn't work correctly.   If those same server definitions are loaded
manually by the user and saved locally,  they work fine.  So, there's
apparently an issue related to the use of the default_servers.pvsc and
how those definitions are saved out to the user's server.pvsc file.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0910310552i3d51c06crd89c0a54bba6c466@mail.gmail.com>

If I add colors to a polydata using
polydata->GetPointData()->SetScalars ( Colors );

then open the polydata in Paraview, the colors are applied automatically.

However, if I use
polydata->GetPointData()->AddArray ( Colors );

which is apparently (from the vtk-users list) the "new/correct" way to
do this in VTK, I have to go to "display" and change "Color by:" to
"Colors" and then uncheck "Map scalars". Is there a reason that colors
added in this way are not applied automatically?

I think the idea is that the arrow always has length 1, the tip length
is a parameter that decides the proportional size of the arrow tip to
the whole.  Commonly the arrow is used as a glyph source, so the final
length of the arrow is determined by a scaling factor.

If you just want a different sized arrow, try using the scaling in the
display tab, or apply a transform filter.

Hi David,

(That's a classic one and something else for the wiki.)
Just wrap all variable declarations involving vtkSmartPointer up into a
  //BTX
      ... code ...
  //ETX
comment. To hide that particular setting from the parser in
vtkWrapClientServer which does not handle well those declarations
involving VTK classes.

Thanks Sven, that fixed the syntax error. However, I am getting a new error now:

vtkICPFilterClientServer.cxx:97: error: invalid conversion from
?vtkPolyDataAlgorithm*? to ?vtkICPFilter*

Anyone know what would cause this?

Thanks,

Add
     vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkICPFilter, vtkPolyDataAlgorithm);
to your vtkICPFilter.h.

That did the trick. However, now that it compiles correctly, when I load the
plugin in Paraview it has a yellow warning symbol (! in a triangle) and it
says:

Load Error, Plugin verification data mismatch in libICP.so
undefined symbol: _ZTV12vtkICPFilter

This looks like a linker error, but my CMakeLists.txt contains

SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkICPFilter.cxx

which should be the only implementation file needed, right?

Here is the latest (compiling) version.

configure is usually only distributed in the tar-balls and not checked  
into the VCS repository, because it (and many other files) is auto- 
generated. If you really want to use the git version, try this before  
you go on with above instructions:

aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoconf

% nm -C libICP.so
reveals that the undefined symbol _ZTV12vtkICPFilter stems from the
following reference:
         U vtable for vtkICPFilter
http://markmail.org/message/ghz72hqqygv32lsm dealt with a similar
problem. Add

vtkCxxRevisionMacro(vtkICPFilter, "$Revision$");

to your vtkICPFilter.cxx and the code will compile and load into
ParaView. When trying to apply the filter, though, ParaView will
segfault because your XML does not correctly set the two input
connections. Nor does your constructor set the number of input ports to 2.

Out of curiosity I fixed the remaining issues. The filter plugin now
works. But I fail to see where it differs from the more general
(regarding supported data sets) "Resample with DataSet" filter. Do you
have a test case where it actually *does* make a difference?

I managed to install dbus-1.2.16 from mac ports, using the command

sudo port install dbus

and then configured qt-4.5.4 using the following configure command

./configure -opensource -release -platform macx-g++ -cocoa -arch  
x86_64 -nomake examples -nomake demos -qt-sql-sqlite -dbus-linked - 
framework -xmlpatterns -phonon -phonon-backend -svg -no-qt3support - 
sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk/ -prefix /Developer/Applications/ 
Qt-4.5

and ran the dbus/remotecontrolledcar  example, and launched  
qtdbusviewer, and eveything seems to be working fine, as far as dbus  
is concerned.

So, I have dbus-1.2.16, and qt-4.5.4 built, for x86_64 using cocoa.

The problem is if I try to read an OpenFOAM-1.6 file built using  
Bernhard's Mac OS X 10.6 patches, it uses mac ports gcc compiler  gcc- 
mp-4.3 and g++-mp-4.3. He was saying that if you build paraview using  
a different compiler other than that was used to build OpenFOAM, then  
paraview would crash.

So, at the moment, I am not having much success building  
paraview-3.7.0 using gcc-mp-4.3.

Have you managed to build paraview-3.7.0 using mac ports gcc-mp-4.3?

Best regards,

Elvis Dowson

Zhanping,
 
Will the options to modify the density, thickness, and colour of the
streaklines be available to the user? It is definitely a good tool, but
sometimes we find it better to visualise using the standard streamtracer as
we can modify their appearance for clarity.
 
-Bastil: If you use extract surface, you'll need to make sure you have a
shear stress vector available on the surface (or create one before-hand),
assuming you are doing aero flows. However, if you use extract block on the
surfaces within the ensight volume data, you should be able to use the
velocity vector as input for LIC too (I think it takes the data just off the
surface for visualising, although I'm not sure). It isn't as nice as using
shear stress, but works well enough.

In fact we are now integrating LIC to VTK. One of the features is that flow

Dear group,

I have compiled VTK_Edge against paraview 3.6.2. Everything worked fine
except that make install did not install "libVTKEdge.so" to the install
directory - I had to copy this manually. Is this a bug or a feature?

Afterwards I can load libVTKEdge.so to paraview without problems.
However, where are the new features? I am especially interested in LIC
and I only found lic on 2D structured grids and LIC on image data in the
filters menu. Both are greyed off with my Ensight-Reader multiblock
unstructured grids. Does it only run on structured grid? Am I missing
something?

lding Mesa,, both Xlib and DRI make use of the X11 libraries, but it is my =
understanding that if you build mesa with the
--with-driver=3Dosmesa

Then the offending glx* linkage will not be necessary. You will get a libOS=
Mesa instead of libGL - but you simply tell VTK to use that one instead of =
libGL. (Pat's tweaks may also be required to stop vtkXRenderwindow stuff be=
ing pulled in).

I haven't actually tried this, but I'd like to be proved right or wrong so =
that I know for future reference.

JB

 *   Xlib - This is the default mode for building Mesa. It uses Xlib as a s=
oftware renderer to do all rendering. It corresponds to the option --with-d=
river=3Dxlib. The libX11 and libXext libraries, as well as the X11 developm=
ent headers, will be need to support the Xlib driver.
 *   DRI - This mode uses the DRI hardware drivers for accelerated OpenGL r=
endering. Enable the DRI drivers with the option --with-driver=3Ddri. See t=
he basic installation instructions<http://www.mesa3d.org/install.html> for =
details on prerequisites for the DRI drivers.
 *   OSMesa - No libGL is built in this mode. Instead, the driver code is b=
uilt into the Off-Screen Mesa (OSMesa) library. See the Off-Screen Renderin=
g<http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html> page for more details.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Compiling without X11 libraries

Sorry I misread your email, you don't want to create X11 windows at all.  Y=
ou want to do pure osmesa.  So then you'll be all set if you follow the hac=
ks I describe.  By the way, when I compile osmesa, for pure offscreen, I ju=
st run 'make linux-osmesa' and the result is libOSMesa.so and libGLU.so.

Hi Ken,

Below is copy and paste from a previous email where I answered a similar qu=
estion off-list (your question is a little different because you want to us=
e Mesa3D to create windows).  Unfortunately you can't do this without some =
small hacks to the cmakelists.  I think the important part for you is in th=
e last paragraph.

----------

Using true offscreen means using vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow and not vtkXOpenGL=
RenderWindow.  Which one is used depends on whether or not VTK_USE_OSMESA i=
s defined in $build_dir/VTK/vtkToolkits.h.

VTK_USE_OSMESA is defined when:

  * OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY is set to the empty string
  * VTK_USE_X is OFF
  * VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA is true

If the platform is Linux, and cmake is able to locate X11 libraries & heade=
rs, then cmake will force VTK_USE_X to ON.  You must hack VTK/CMake/vtkUseX=
.cmake to set it to OFF.

Look at the bottom of $build_dir/VTK/vtkToolkits.h to make sure that you ha=
ve successfully defined VTK_USE_OSMESA.

If you are doing a shared build, and OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY is the empty string,=
 then you will get link errors because of some changes that were introduced=
 after the transitive linking patch last June.  To avoid that, you need to =
change all instances of ${OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY} to ${OSMESA_LIBRARY} in all CM=
akeLists.txt except for VTK/Rendering/CMakeLists.txt or VTK/CMakeLists.txt.

lding Mesa,, both Xlib and DRI make use of the X11 libraries, but it is my =
understanding that if you build mesa with the
--with-driver=3Dosmesa

Then the offending glx* linkage will not be necessary. You will get a libOS=
Mesa instead of libGL - but you simply tell VTK to use that one instead of =
libGL. (Pat's tweaks may also be required to stop vtkXRenderwindow stuff be=
ing pulled in).

I haven't actually tried this, but I'd like to be proved right or wrong so =
that I know for future reference.

JB

 *   Xlib - This is the default mode for building Mesa. It uses Xlib as a s=
oftware renderer to do all rendering. It corresponds to the option --with-d=
river=3Dxlib. The libX11 and libXext libraries, as well as the X11 developm=
ent headers, will be need to support the Xlib driver.
 *   DRI - This mode uses the DRI hardware drivers for accelerated OpenGL r=
endering. Enable the DRI drivers with the option --with-driver=3Ddri. See t=
he basic installation instructions <http://www.mesa3d.org/install.html>  fo=
r details on prerequisites for the DRI drivers.
 *   OSMesa - No libGL is built in this mode. Instead, the driver code is b=
uilt into the Off-Screen Mesa (OSMesa) library. See the Off-Screen Renderin=
g <http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html>  page for more details.

=A0 The steps should just be:<BR>
<BR>
Edit VTK/CMake/vtkUseX.cmake and set VTK_USE_X_OPTIONAL to 1 instead of 0 (=
then VTK_USE_X will automatically default to OFF).=A0 Create a new build fo=
lder and configure with -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=3D&quot;&quot;.=A0 Set OSMESA_L=
IBRARY and OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR.=A0 Now you should be able to build a pvserve=
r that has no dependencies on X11 or libGL.<BR>

Hi Ken,<BR>
<BR>
Below is copy and paste from a previous email where I answered a similar qu=

e small hacks to the cmakelists.=A0 I think the important part for you is i=
n the last paragraph.<BR>
<BR>
----------<BR>
<BR>
Using true offscreen means using vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow and not vtkXOpenGL=
RenderWindow.=A0 Which one is used depends on whether or not VTK_USE_OSMESA=
 is defined in $build_dir/VTK/vtkToolkits.h.<BR>
<BR>
VTK_USE_OSMESA is defined when:<BR>
<BR>
=A0 * OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY is set to the empty string<BR>
=A0 * VTK_USE_X is OFF<BR>
=A0 * VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA is true<BR>
<BR>
If the platform is Linux, and cmake is able to locate X11 libraries &amp; h=
eaders, then cmake will force VTK_USE_X to ON.=A0 You must hack VTK/CMake/v=
tkUseX.cmake to set it to OFF.<BR>
<BR>
Look at the bottom of $build_dir/VTK/vtkToolkits.h to make sure that you ha=
ve successfully defined VTK_USE_OSMESA.<BR>
<BR>
If you are doing a shared build, and OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY is the empty string,=
 then you will get link errors because of some changes that were introduced=
 after the transitive linking patch last June.=A0 To avoid that, you need t=
o change all instances of ${OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY} to ${OSMESA_LIBRARY} in all =
CMakeLists.txt except for VTK/Rendering/CMakeLists.txt or VTK/CMakeLists.tx=
t.<BR>

Is there any way to compile ParaView without any X11 libraries at all? =A0I=
 compiled OSMesa support for Mesa 3D and tried to link that, but when I lin=
k I am missing a bunch of glX* symbols. =A0I think that in order to build t=
hese functions for Mesa, I need an X11 library, which gets me back to the d=
ilemma of what if you have no libraries?<br>

pointed to a proper libGLU.so. On cmake advanced settings page you can
page down to see (or just grep in cmakecache.txt) what
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY is. That should point to whereever the GLU library
is located on your machine. If it says NOTFOUND, you need to install
it or ask the sysadmins where it is installed, point the variable to
it, and recompile.
