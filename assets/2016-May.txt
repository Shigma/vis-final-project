This bug has already been corrected in the master branch of paraview. You
can clone it and compile it, or wait for ParaView 5.0.1 to come out in a
few weeks.

I attached a smallest example I came up with that could help. If you load the state-file you'll see the next pipeline:
test.vtp
AngularPeriodicFilter (with angle = 90 and axiz = Z)
CellDatatoPointData
MergeBlocks

That works. However if you remove CellDatatoPointData from this pipeline and try to merge the result of AngularPeriodicFilter you'll see the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Help with adjusting contour levels in python script
Message-ID: <CALdMxnzp7d61K8=+sMCiQ6KijyFYRya+kGEmojj_=Ezw4BJ-BA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am running a small python code with pvbatch that read a XDMF file and
plots contours:

    cf_VP_anim_xmf = XDMFReader( FileName=wdir+'VPfield_files/XDMF/cf_VP'
+index[i]+'.xmf' )


    cf_VP_anim_xmf.CellArrays = []

    cf_VP_anim_xmf.Sets = []

    cf_VP_anim_xmf.PointArrays = ['Cf']


    RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

    a1_Cf_PVLookupTable = GetLookupTableForArray( "Cf", 1 )


    Cfcontours = Show()

    Cfcontours.EdgeColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.50000762951094835]

    Cfcontours.SelectionPointFieldDataArrayName = 'Cf'

    Cfcontours.ScalarOpacityFunction = []

    Cfcontours.ColorArrayName = 'Cf'

    Cfcontours.ScalarOpacityUnitDistance = 2.4071425938556859

    Cfcontours.LookupTable = a1_Cf_PVLookupTable

    Cfcontours.ScaleFactor = 15.0


    cf_VP_anim_xmf.Grids = ['STL Grid']


    RenderView1.CacheKey = 2.0

    RenderView1.CameraClippingRange = [288.47079837284241,
299.16435388730815]

    RenderView1.UseCache = 0


    a1_Cf_PVLookupTable = GetLookupTableForArray( "Cf", 1, RGBPoints=[-
0.0001, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0001, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], LockScalarRange=1,
ColorSpace='HSV' )


    separationline = Contour( PointMergeMethod="Uniform Binning" )


    separationline.ContourBy = ['POINTS', 'Cf']

    separationline.Isosurfaces = [0.0]


    DataSeparationLine = Show()

    DataSeparationLine.ScaleFactor = 12.321390008926393

    DataSeparationLine.SelectionPointFieldDataArrayName = 'Cf'

    DataSeparationLine.EdgeColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.50000762951094835]

    DataSeparationLine.LineWidth = 2.0

    DataSeparationLine.DiffuseColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]


    DataSeparationLine.ColorArrayName = ''


    Cfcontours.Visibility = 1


    #--- Setup view

    RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

    RenderView1.Background = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

    RenderView1.CenterAxesVisibility = 0

    RenderView1.OrientationAxesVisibility = 0

    RenderView1.ViewSize = [1450, 300]


    RenderView1.InteractionMode = '3D'

    RenderView1.CameraClippingRange = [120.40716073726786,
126.85668499830999]

    RenderView1.CameraPosition = [25.95, 41.63, 1.43]

    RenderView1.CameraFocalPoint = [4.31, 5.36, 4.77]

    RenderView1.CameraViewUp = [0.93, -0.36, -0.053]


    #--- Uncomment for 2D Interaction Mode

    #RenderView1.CameraParallelScale = 5.5


    a1_Cf_PVLookupTable = GetLookupTableForArray( "Cf", 1, RGBPoints=[-
0.0001, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0001, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], LockScalarRange=1 )


    #--- Export image

    Render()

    WriteImage(wdir+'POSTPRO/IMAGES/cf_view1_'+index[i]+'.jpg')

I set the range of the contours from -0.0001 to 0.0001 but the contours
levels revert back to automatic scaling instead of the range that I
specify. I am using version 3.98 of Paraview but I also tried with version
4.1.0. Why is this happening? Do I miss something in my script?

Alas, no. Sometimes, using sub-proxies instead may work, but depends
on your usecase.

Message-ID: <CAJFKOL3XFza9hGtGnnH9J2d_SSrmt5jWjNfxO_AKOOhoi8YuMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

 Since i need to generate a human organ using my data first of all i
registered my images. Second of all, segmented the organ first . Third of
all, segmented the rest of the sub objects inside the organ.

Basically, segmentation was done and saved in following formats.
1st mask(for the organ) ; saved as .mat file
2nd mask(for sub objects with in the organ) : saved as .mat file
3rd mask(for sub objects within the organ)  : saved as .mat file

(note: segmentation is done for the whole image)

Since i have these masks saved in Mat format i combined all the masks and
converted to VTK format.

When i run in the Paraview, i can only view the slice, surface, etc but NOT
the VOLUME (which is what i want).

What is the reason to this?

How to overcome this issue now?

Thank you in advance.

Warm regards,
Chathuri Gunasekera.

Nikos,

When you say you're "set the range of the contours from -0.0001 to
0.0001 but the contours levels revert back to automatic scaling", what
do you mean? Do you mean you're setting separationline.Isosurfaces to
be values in the given range, but the rendered countour is still the
same old value?

If so, there was a with how the contour filter was modified when the
contour values where changed that was fixed recently. You may want to
give 5.0.1 a try to see if you can reproduce the issue with 5.0.1.

OK, taking small steps here,  what is OSMesa, and want is Mesa?  Utkarsh and I had this discussion, but I never understood the difference.

Having just googled the difference, If I understand correctly, OSMesa actually means Off Screen Mesa, and is compiled into Mesa.  Otherwise, you get Mesa ? software rendering, but into a GLX window?

You are correct ? I am not building OSMesa.  Thus, my problem?

That is basically the difference. To use any implementation of OpenGL (which is what Mesa3D is), you first need an OpenGL context. On *nix you typically get this by opening a window with the Xhost. Even when doing offscreen rendering you need to get a context with the Xhost (because classically this was the interface to the graphics hardware).

Osmesa is a small library that sits on top of Mesa3D. It creates an OpenGL context without having to go to an Xhost. It has a different interface than GLX, so your software needs to specifically open an osmesa ?window? in addition to linking to the correct library.

As I recall, in order to use osmesa, you need to set VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA to ON and then set OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR and OSMESA_LIBRARY. Typically the osmesa headers and libraries are in the same location as the Mesa 3D install.

See this Wiki page for more info: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

Hi,


I'm using Paraview 4.4. Can Paraview preserve the style of a color map & the associated color map layout? I've spent time creating a nice layout that involves the position of the color bar, the size of the text on the color bar, the precision of the numbers displayed on the color bar, and the color map(red to blue rainbow). It's exactly what I want. The problem is that if I go from plotting pressure to temperature, the entire layout reverts back to the default Paraview hot/cold colormap and the colorbar resets to the default.

Can I tell Paraview to maintain my style for all variables in the dataset?


Thank you,

Also, be wary of environment variables in the cron job which are not the
same (think empty) as when you log into an interactive session.

If the machine happens to be setup to have X and you are OK with onscreen
rendering for the job (many nighty dashboards work this way for instance)
it is entirely possible that the process has no DISPLAY environment
variable and that you have to manually set it to :0 or something like that.

Subject: [Paraview] Axis labels and ticks vanish at high zoom
Message-ID: <201605040908.u4498aWJ005450@msw1.awe.co.uk>

Good morning,

When I zoom into a dataset, the axes grid labels, ticks and grid disappear.

I turn on the axes grid (optionally turn on 'show grid' in the settings) and then zoom in on the axis. At a certain point, the axis labels, ticks and grid fail to show. Sometimes they show only part way up the axis.

Has anyone else seen this? Is there a way to get around it?

For info, I'm using ParaView 5.0.1 on Linux (built from source).

Cheers,
Jim

Hi Daniel,

We are going to work on the Windows support in June for the next release of
ParaView 5.1+.
At the moment, building ParaViewWeb for windows won't be easy. But once we
iron out the process, it will be back by default in our binaries.

Hi Daniel,

here is an updated version of the documentation.
We are in the process of migrating the documentation and code base. Once it
will be done the later will be the official one.

http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/os_mesa.html

Moreover, if you are on linux and you are using the latest ParaView, you
can use our binaries as they embed the llvm libraries.
When running ParaViewWeb, you just need to add an extra argument
--mesa-llvm.

Message-ID: <CADHSJjCqyUm8UEYFqkn2cYP8BL_06yQTmymn1J7h_qaHde56wg@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

As we continue to make progress on the new OpenGL2 rendering backend,
I wanted to get a feel from the community if there's any objection to
dropping support entirely for the legacy OpenGL1 rendering backend in
ParaView for 5.2?

Note this will only affect ParaView and ParaView-based applications.

Following discussions with folks here, we're tabling this for another
year as the OpenGL2 backend continues to stabilize.

Hi,

Are you generating the Catalyst script with PV built with the OpenGL2
backend and then linking with a version of Catalyst built with the OpenGL1
backend? I'd guess that this is the problem.

To isolate the issue further, you can do a Python trace in the GUI to see
if you get the same issue when you run pvpython with that script.

Best,
Andy

Hi,

Actually, i am using same ParaView installation (under Mac OS) to create 
the Catalyst script and compiling the model code. So, OpenGL backend 
must be consistent.  In any case, i'll try your suggestion and let you 
know about it.

Regards,

Hi,

I tested the pipeline as follows,

1 - using original Catalyst script, i created new python script (also 
includes that read part). In this case, i removed all co-processing 
calls.  See the attached script (dvr_pv.py). You could also compare it 
with original Co-processing generated script (dvr.py).

2 - Then, i opened PV and after Tools-> Python Shell -> Run Script, i 
run the dvr_pv.py

The strange thing is that it produces exactly same problematic DVR in 
this case. So, it seems that problem is not related with Catalyst but it 
seems related with Python interface. So, i think that this information 
could narrow down the places that might cause the problem. Please let me 
know, if you need more information and test.

Thanks again for your kindly help,
Regards,

--ufuk

Subject: [Paraview] Building a 3D volume but an error message pop up,
	kind assistance needed
Message-ID: <CAJFKOL2DSw3Ebtq9VjRx4WuFxjayNL-bqpZ33qvyGdFnTrktcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,


I performed the boundary detection(eg:Canny edge detection) on the
segmented images(they are binary images) and then converted to .mat file.
Next, stacked the matrices(3D) and converted to vtk format.

I am getting the following error when i try to build a 3Dvolume in
Paraview. Hence,i  cannot build the volume, what would be the cause for
that?

 Can anyone please help me to resolve this matter?
[image: Inline image 2]

Thank you so much in advance.

Warm regards,
Chathuri Gunasekera.

Subject: [Paraview] Setting up Paraview Web on a headless Fedora server with
	GPU
Message-ID: <507a18c0-3bac-fae8-da55-c5ea33e8e1d0@fjfi.cvut.cz>

Hello,


I'm trying to set up a Paraview Web server on a Fedora 23 machine. The serves is not connected to a 
monitor or a keyboard (I only have access through ssh), but it has a nvidia GPU which I want to use 
for paraview.


I have installed xdm to run the X server, and verified that it is in fact running with the correct 
nvidia drivers (by checking the Xorg.0.log file). The problem is I don't know how to run the 
paraview webserver on the X display when there's no one physically logged in - I can only get to the 
server via ssh. When I log in, and switch to the paraview user, the DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY variables 
are empty.


The webserver itself is running (apache + the python launcher), but when I try to open any of the 
example applications, I get an error like this:


$ ./launch-paraview.sh
2016-05-05 14:54:17,528:INFO:twisted:Site starting on 9000

Specifying DISPLAY=:0 when running the launcher gives this error:

You were on the right track with DISPLAY=:0 but I'm wondering if you setup
a "virtual" monitor or if your "paraview" user is auto logged in a X
session or if it stuck at the "login" panel?

You can find some information about the virtual screen here: (Search for
"Screen")

http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/graphics_on_ec2_g2.html

And for the autologin if it is needed. (Note on EC2 the user start X hence
no need to login...)

Hello,

  I'm having trouble importing vtk inside pvpython while it imports just
fine inside python. I installed paraview-python with paraview-5.0.1 using
debian stretch. Any ideas on why this might be the case?

pvpython is a paraview client, and it is not suposed to execute vtk code,
wich is executed on the server.
in pvpython you can do:
from paraview import *

What are you trying to achieve ?

I think you have VTK installed on your system which conflict with your
ParaView one. Hence the segfault inside ParaView.

Otherwise nothing should prevent you from doing pure VTK code in ParaView
as long as you are aware of the possible issue when running remotely and/or
in parallel.

oh. This looks like it's getting out of scope this mailing list. Feel free
to ignore. I should probably file a bug report there. I'll just leave this
here for others to comment/see if they run into a similar problem.

https://packages.debian.org/testing/python/paraview-python

I just checked. paraview-python depends on python-vtk6 which in turn
depends on libvtk6.2. I have all of them installed. Something else must be
up. Strangely there's a vtk module inside paraview itself which also fails
to import dataset_adapter. I don't know if this is a conflict or not.

My old python scripts used the dataset_adapter under a different tree
within the paraview module. Now it's broken. Crap!

Hi,

I try to use a Paraview Plugin (Medreader) which works in PV3.14 in PV 
4.1.3. Does this work in general? When loading the dll file I get the error:

ERROR: In 
C:\DBD\pvs-x32\paraview\src\paraview\ParaViewCore\ClientServerCore\Core\vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx,

Hello

As far as I know, there is no officially supported MEDReader plugin for
paraview.
There is a working one, part of the Salome project.
Other versions can be found on the internet.

Which plugin are you referring to ? Can you provide a upstream link ?

Regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Thanks Sebastien. It seems I'm getting somewhere - I installed "slim" instead of xdm, and had the 
paraview user login automatically. Now when I login via ssh, I can see the X server is running, and 
the paraview user has the ~/.Xauthority file created in its homedir (so I guess it did login 
successfuly). The DISPLAY variable is still unset, but I get a new error if I set it manually:

[paraview at vbl-sim ~] $ DISPLAY=:0 glxinfo
Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 keyError: unable to open display :0

and the same error for any X program (so I can't run i.e. "xhost +" recommended somewhere). This 
situation persists through restarts. I trie ro remove the ~/.Xauthority file as recommended 
elsewhere, but that didn't help either.

(I also tried a second method - starting the launcher through .xinitrc, but it seems slim ignores 
this file altogether. That's a different problem anyways, as for testing it would be more 
comfortable if I could launch the server form command line)

Hello,

I have installed Paraview 5.0 on my machine(Windows 8.1). When i try to
visualize a 3D model in vtk format, i am getting an error.

I have no idea why i get the following error? What does it depicts?
*error:In C:\bbd\df0abce0\build\src\paraview\VTK\Rendering|Volume\vtkGPUVolumeRayCastMap*


Can anyone help me to resolve this issue ?

Thank you.

Hello

This is actually a truncated error message, could you check the "Console

One more step closer to the goal it seems - if run:


export XAUTHORITY=/var/run/slim/slim.auth
DISPLAY=:0 xhost +


as root, I can get the launcher to start, and not die with an X-related error (cumbersome 
workaround, but I guess I can find a better way later).

They bundled the MedReader Plugin from Salome with PV 3.14:
http://www.alneos.com/en/downloads/paraview-with-med

I want to use it with a newer version of PV. Salome 7.7.1 has PV 4.3.1 
but I don't know how I can bundle the Plugins with PV.

Hello

Sadly this plugin is out dated, and is made to work with paraview 3.14
There is no reason for it to work with any newer version of paraview, bth
VTK and ParaView have changed a lot since.
Also, as far as i see, the plugin distributed on alneos website is binary
only, so it can only be used with the correct binary version of paraview,
since you can't recompile it.

No solution for you, unless you want to try and extract the MEDReader
plugin from the current salome (
http://salome-platform.org/downloads/current-version),
And compile everything.
You can use this tutorial to help you, using the version of salome that
fits your need, but i can't give you assurance that it will work, I tried
it myself but quickly run into issues.
Good luck, and in case you want support, don't hesitate to ask kitware
commercial team.

Regards,

Mathieu Westphal

You are getting really close...

Basically you have the ParaView process that properly started at the
request of the client and waits to it to connect, which never happen.

Usually that mean, you have a mistake either in your Apache config and/or
in your launcher.

Could you share your Apache virtual host with your launcher config along
with the URL the web client connects to?

Ha! I got it - I had apache configured as SSL-only. That is: http at port 80 was hard redirected to 
https at port 443. I changed the config to only use http, and now it works. For now that's not 
critical -  this is an experimental server accessible only from our internal network, I can try to 
fix this later.

Now I'll start playing with the visualizer app. So far it seems to work pretty well - I just need to 
make it use all available resources (it just runs sigle-core).


Thank you for your help, Sebastien!

Hello,
Thank you so much for your response, Mathieu.

 Here is what i am getting when i check the 'console view' option.

ERROR: In
C:\bbd\df0abce0\build\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\Rendering\Volume\vtkGPUVolumeRayCastMapper.cxx,
line 340

vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper (000000D7783182B0): scalar of type VTK_CHAR
is not supported because this type is platform dependent. Use
VTK_SIGNED_CHAR or VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR instead.



 Do you see why i am getting this error exactly?


Actually the files were orginally created as .Mat file then they are
converted to VTK format. But how can i convert to VTK_SIGNED_CHAR or
VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR ? I am sorry i simply don't know how to do it. Any
guidance is really appreciated.

Warm regards,
Chathuri Gunasekera.

Looks like your try to visualize your data which is of VTK_CHAR format,
which is unsupported.
I can't tell much more without the actual data.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb with remote, distributed data
Message-ID: <CAJZHu4RMK_PaMmUN3Mv-u1Kor8ZY_6Qvq8LbtGDibhK73rtqzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I am currently running a VTK application, which is visualizing large grids
distributed on a MPI cluster.
My task is to migrate this application to the Web. But I cannot manage more
than what is described at
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/quick_start,
that is I can serve a local data directory through the provided webapps.

I have two essential questions that stop me from getting started:
1) How do I connect the pvpython server to remote data/render servers just
like I can do in Paraview?
2) All ParaviewWeb examples seem to react on webclient requests. Our
application is processing data as they come in, and also the visualization
pipeline is frequently updated depending on an automatic analysis of the
arriving data. Can the newly rendered datasets be pushed to the webclient,
or does the webclient have to poll for available datasets?

Thank you
Sven

Glad to hear you figure it out.

You can setup Apache to use https/wss and just redirect to ws:// internally.

Usually one core is enough especially if you have ParaView build with some
SMP/tbb. MPI will introduce some overhead. Unless you need many machine for
your model to fit in memory.

If you need to interface a cluster, you also can to that with some
mpi-pvserver connecting back to your pvpython client.
But that will be probably another thread. ;-)

Enjoy,

Seb

Hi Sven,

1) Yes, assuming you are using pv_web_visualizer.py you can look here:

https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Web/Applications/Visualizer/server/pv_web_visualizer.py#L18-L28

2) The server can push notification to the client. Need to slightly edit
the client and server to match your needs.

Seb

Thank you, Seb, I'll try those settings beginning of next week.

Probably you can also help me with a few points of my huge lack of
understanding ParaviewWeb. Here, http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Design
a tomcat web server is mentioned to provide the PWService. Where does
pv_web_visualizer.py fit into those design diagrams? Does it replace tomcat
by providing PWService independently?

There are so many outdated ParaviewWeb articles in the Wiki that I find it
extremely difficult to understand the current design. Can't somebody remove
the old articles or clearly mark them as "Applicable only to Paraview
<x.y.z"?
Is http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html the
most recent documentation? Or is it also not valid for Paraview 4.x and 5.x
as ".../Paraview3/..." in the link address suggests?

Thank you
Sven

The ParaViewWeb_Design you found is 5 years old but some users are still
using it.
=> The future matching doc would be:
http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/architecture.html

The second link should still be somewhat ok until ParaView 5.1 (Valid till
June 2016).

As starting June (~July), the old documentation should disappear and only
the http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb will be the official one. But as
we are transitioning both documentations are available.

Subject: [Paraview] Table of points to colored tube.
Message-ID: <572E6C7B.9020500@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been stuck with the following for a while.

Given is a table (using the TableToPoints filter) of X,Y,Z,N (4 columns, 
3 coordinates and the density at those coordinates) over time. I would 
like to connect those points and color the tube according to the 
density, N, at that point.

Using the Programmable Filter I managed to connect the points as follows:

pdi =self.GetPolyDataInput()

pdo =self.GetPolyDataOutput()

numPoints =pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()

pdo.Allocate()

fori inrange(0, numPoints-1):

points =[i, i+1]

pdo.InsertNextCell(3, 2, points)

Unfortunately I do not manage to include the density component.

It would be awesome if somebody could help me out.

Thank you!

Jan

References: <572E6C7B.9020500@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <572E85A9.8030605@gmail.com>

So, I'm almost there with this script:

"
pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
pdo.Allocate()
for i in range(0, numPoints-1):
  points = [i, i+1]
  pdo.InsertNextCell(3, 2, points)

ivals = pdi.GetPointData().GetScalars("u")
ca = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
ca.SetName(ivals.GetName())
ca.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
ca.SetNumberOfTuples(numPoints-1)
pdo.GetCellData().AddArray(ca)
for i in range(0, numPoints-1):
   ca.SetValue(i, ivals.GetValue(i))
"

The only issue now is that the Tube filter is unhappy as it is unable to 
compute the normals making its output segmented looking like a 
collection of separate disks. I've attached a test-file and screenshot 
of the output.

"

Generic Warning: In 
/Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release-Python27/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkPolyLine.cxx,

Skipping to next.

"

Anybody any suggestions?

Thank you!

Subject: [Paraview] tikz/tex export for paraview contour plots
Message-ID: <572FDED6.9030405@gmail.com>

Hi,

We are currently trying to export paraview contour plots and include
them into a latex document. The straight forward way of exporting an eps
or similar image has some issues. In particular the axis are not scaling
with the camera view, hence, if you zoom in, you don't get them on the
plot since they are only at the exterior of the data. We created a small
python tool, that essentially embeds the figure created in paraview into
a tikz picture and adds axes. However, we still need to manually specify
the the extent of the plot in that script which is tedious.

a) Did anyone encounter the same issue and is willing to share a script
or so?
b) If not, is there a way to extract the Viewport extent in a python
script so that we can directly set them in the script?
c) In addition it would be great if also the text in the legend would be
rendered in latex. Therefore it would be great if we could place it in
the Paraview window and then only plot the colorbar and add the text to
the tikz file.

Thanks,
Richard

PS: the core of the python script that prepares the tikz file:

ifile=open(outfilename,'w')
formstring=' {:>10.8f}'
line='% this picture was created with the axisNlable_generator.py script
\n'\
+    '% \n \n'
ifile.write(line)
line='\\begin{tikzpicture} \n' \
+    '\\begin{axis}[ \n' \
+    'axis on top,enlargelimits=false,\n'\
+    'width=\\figurewidth, \n' \
+    'axis equal image,\n'\
+    'xlabel='+xlabel+',\n'\
+    'ylabel='+ylabel+']\n'\
+    '\\addplot[]
graphics[xmin='+str(xmin)+',ymin='+str(ymin)+',xmax='+str(xmax)+',ymax='+str(ymax)+']\n'
\
+    '{'+enbed_fname+'};\n'\
+    '\\end{axis} \n' \
+    '\\end{tikzpicture} \n' \

ifile.write(line)
ifile.close()

Subject: [Paraview] Camera focus being tangent to camera path
Message-ID: <VI1PR03MB14391536B1FBE17AD34AFE08A4700@VI1PR03MB1439.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

Would it be possible to specify a new camera focus point for each camera position in a path so that you make the illusion that the camera moves with e.g. a pipe flow?

It seems only to be possible to specify *one* focus point for a camera path.

Regards,
Per Adamsen

When you say you can't see the volume, do you mean a volume rendering
of the surface? Or do you want to see the volume of the segmented
organ? If that is the case, use either the Contour filter or Threshold
filter to show the boundary surface of your segmentation. Either one
should work, but the Contour filter may produce a bit smoother
surface.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi Juha,

This is a bit beyond my current numpy-foo. Hopefully I'll get a chance
to look at it in more depth in the next couple months.

If you figure anything else out, I and others on the list would surely
appreciate knowing what you find.

Thanks,
Cory

Message-ID: <CADHSJjBycd1r_LwF=2hjcwvjpjQK-_K_w_dPfjLpQUh2gJF+bg@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I wanted to check if there's any objection to dropping support for OsX 10.7
(Lion) in future ParaView releases. 10.7 has been unsupported by Apple
since October 2014 [1]. This will change minimum OsX version for ParaView
to 10.8 (Mountain Lion).

Jan,

I think you want to copy the field data as point data, not cell data. Since the points of your input are the same as your output, you can just call ?PassData? to copy them over. Try this version of the script for the programmable filter:

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
pdo.Allocate()
for i in range(0, numPoints-1):
 points = [i, i+1]
 pdo.InsertNextCell(3, 2, points)

pdo.GetPointData().PassData(pdi.GetPointData())

So, I'm almost there with this script:

"
pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
pdo.Allocate()
for i in range(0, numPoints-1):
 points = [i, i+1]
 pdo.InsertNextCell(3, 2, points)

ivals = pdi.GetPointData().GetScalars("u")
ca = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
ca.SetName(ivals.GetName())
ca.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
ca.SetNumberOfTuples(numPoints-1)
pdo.GetCellData().AddArray(ca)
for i in range(0, numPoints-1):
  ca.SetValue(i, ivals.GetValue(i))
"

The only issue now is that the Tube filter is unhappy as it is unable to compute the normals making its output segmented looking like a collection of separate disks. I've attached a test-file and screenshot of the output.

"


Generic Warning: In /Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release-Python27/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkPolyLine.cxx, line 106

Anybody any suggestions?

Thank you!

Hello Seb,
I got a working connection from pv_web_visualizer.py to a couple of
pvservers (started with mpirun on <hostname>) by just giving "--ds-host
<hostname> --ds-port 11111" from the link you mentioned. Is this correct,
without --rs-host? It is working in principle, but the renderview update
rate is not more than 2 updates/second for a tiny datasource even when
everything is running on the same machine.

Thank you
Sven

Message-ID: <BN3PR07MB26275B660A48EDA6B6833ED09D700@BN3PR07MB2627.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hello again,


I'm (finally) trying to get Catalyst to successfully link to our application code on Excalibur (Cray, ARL HPC). I was able to build paraview and all of the dependencies thanks to help I've gotten on the list here in the past. However, when I try to link my code to it (and this is a code that works fine with Catalyst on other platforms), I get:


 CMake Error at /p/home/tgallagh/pv-test/4.4.0_osmesa/lib/cmake/paraview-4.4/vtkModuleAPI.cmake:120 (message):
   Requested modules not available:

     vtkPVPythonCatalyst
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   /p/home/tgallagh/pv-test/4.4.0_osmesa/lib/cmake/paraview-4.4/VTKConfig.cmake:80 (vtk_module_config)
   /p/home/tgallagh/pv-test/4.4.0_osmesa/lib/cmake/paraview-4.4/ParaViewConfig.cmake:49 (include)
   CMakeLists.txt:218 (find_package)

The section in my CMakeLists that looks for paraview is:

option(LESLIE_USE_COPROCESSING "Turn on CoProcessing with Paraview" OFF)
if(LESLIE_USE_COPROCESSING)
  find_package(ParaView REQUIRED vtkPVPythonCatalyst
               HINTS $ENV{PARAVIEW_CP_ROOT})
  include(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
  include_directories(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/utils)
  add_definitions(-DPARAVIEW_COPROCESSING)
endif()
mark_as_advanced(LESLIE_USE_COPROCESSING)

and it doesn't seem to work. On other machines, I never needed to set the PARAVIEW_CP_ROOT variable, it always just found it. When I build my code, I point the paraview directory (where it finds the paraviewConfig.cmake file) to:


/p/home/tgallagh/pv-test/4.4.0_osmesa/lib/cmake/paraview-4.4


and it seems to find it okay.


Lastly, the vtkPVPythonCatalyst.so library is in the lib/paraview-4.4/site-packages/vtk directory and there is libvtkPVPythonCatalyst-pv4.4.so* and libvtkPVPythonCatalystPython27D-pv4.4.so* in lib/paraview-4.4/


I'm at a loss to understand why it is reporting the module is missing -- did I miss something somewhere?


Thanks as always,


Tim

Hi Tim,

Is the PV directory you're pointing to a build directory or an install
directory? If it's an install directory you'll need to enable
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES. Other than that, my suggestion would be
to try linking one of the Catalyst examples from
https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode and see how that
works for you. Another thing you could try is using a newer version of
CMake from https://cmake.org/download/. For the Linux x86_64 tarball, you
can just untar the executables from that and use directly.

Let us know if none of those ideas don't work for you.

Best,
Andy

Hmm, that could be a bug in the superbuild. The superbuild arguments aren't
all passed to the ParaView build itself and it could be that this option
was missing for the PV specific build part. Instead of doing the whole
build from scratch, I'd suggest you just search for the
ParaViewConfig.cmake file to find where PV was actually built and just
point to that.

Yeah -- okay, pointing it to the build directory instead of the install made sure everything was found.


One step closer to getting this working on Cray.

Hmm, that could be a bug in the superbuild. The superbuild arguments aren't all passed to the ParaView build itself and it could be that this option was missing for the PV specific build part. Instead of doing the whole build from scratch, I'd suggest you just search for the ParaViewConfig.cmake file to find where PV was actually built and just point to that.

Hi Tim,

Is the PV directory you're pointing to a build directory or an install directory? If it's an install directory you'll need to enable PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES. Other than that, my suggestion would be to try linking one of the Catalyst examples from https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode and see how that works for you. Another thing you could try is using a newer version of CMake from https://cmake.org/download/. For the Linux x86_64 tarball, you can just untar the executables from that and use directly.

Hi Scen,

that's a correct way, but I'm not sure to know why it is that much slower.
Wondering if all the pvserver are fighting for the same GPU and hence
waiting more than anything... ?
You may be able to change the remote rendering threshold to make sure only
pvpython is doing the rendering.

Okay, really close to finally crossing this off my list -- it's been on it for years.


I can get the code to generate images but it won't save data files. I don't get any errors and I get my images, just no VTK files. I have tried the default that the catalyst generator creates:


parallelMultiBlockDataSetWriter1 = servermanager.writers.XMLMultiBlockDataWriter(Input=slice1)

coprocessor.RegisterWriter(parallelMultiBlockDataSetWriter1, filename='slices_%t.vtm', freq=freq_file)


and I tried another form that the grid writer you've send me in the past used:


writer = coprocessor.CreateWriter(XMLMultiBlockDataWriter, filename='slices_%t.vtm', freq=freq_file)


in all cases, freq_file = 1000.


Neither one will output any vtk files.


Any thoughts?


Also, minor note but it is kind of annoying -- both the catalyst generator and the trace generator seem to do this, but they add commands that set attributes that are not part of the classes when run through the python script. For example, I had to comment out:


#      slice1Display.SelectInputVectors = ['CELLS', 'Velocity [m/s]']
#      slice1Display.WriteLog = ''


Any ideas why it does that? Or is there a way (and downfall) to just let it add attributes without manually calling add_attribute() each time?


Tim

Hi Tim,

I assume that writing out a data set works on other machines, correct? Can
you try the gridwriter.py script at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/Examples/Catalyst/SampleScripts/gridwriter.py
to output the full data set? It should work with PV 4.4. Note that outputs
a full data set every time step. I'm not sure about Python warnings or
errors but the C++ warnings and errors will be sent to std::cerr instead of
std::cout.

Did you make the script with PV 4.4? The PV Python API has some changes
(especially for rendering) between revisions. I think the best option is to
just comment out the parts that are causing trouble.

If you're still having issues, maybe send your full script along with
std::cout and std::cerr outputs so I can get a little deeper into the
issues.

Good luck,
Andy

Ah hah, the errors were being sent somewhere else and not caught properly by my submission script.


I found the error and now it works, I get my images and my VTK files. The only warnings now are:


24vtkCPTensorArrayTemplateIdE (0x23b4320): GetVoidPointer called. This is very expensive for vtkMappedDataArray subclasses, since the scalar array must be generated for each call. Consider using a vtkTypedDataArrayIterator instead.


which is something I can deal with later. I have to figure out what the vtkCPTensorArrayTemplate does exactly -- I believe that was something you had added when you took a look at our code awhile back. But it doesn't seem to matter for what we're doing now.


It feels good to close the ticket in our tracker about getting coprocessing on Crays -- it's been open since 2012.


Thanks again for all your help.


Tim

I can get the code to generate images but it won't save data files. I don't get any errors and I get my images, just no VTK files. I have tried the default that the catalyst generator creates:


parallelMultiBlockDataSetWriter1 = servermanager.writers.XMLMultiBlockDataWriter(Input=slice1)

coprocessor.RegisterWriter(parallelMultiBlockDataSetWriter1, filename='slices_%t.vtm', freq=freq_file)


and I tried another form that the grid writer you've send me in the past used:


writer = coprocessor.CreateWriter(XMLMultiBlockDataWriter, filename='slices_%t.vtm', freq=freq_file)


in all cases, freq_file = 1000.


Neither one will output any vtk files.


Any thoughts?


Also, minor note but it is kind of annoying -- both the catalyst generator and the trace generator seem to do this, but they add commands that set attributes that are not part of the classes when run through the python script. For example, I had to comment out:


#      slice1Display.SelectInputVectors = ['CELLS', 'Velocity [m/s]']
#      slice1Display.WriteLog = ''


Any ideas why it does that? Or is there a way (and downfall) to just let it add attributes without manually calling add_attribute() each time?

Hmm, that could be a bug in the superbuild. The superbuild arguments aren't all passed to the ParaView build itself and it could be that this option was missing for the PV specific build part. Instead of doing the whole build from scratch, I'd suggest you just search for the ParaViewConfig.cmake file to find where PV was actually built and just point to that.

Hi Tim,

Is the PV directory you're pointing to a build directory or an install directory? If it's an install directory you'll need to enable PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES. Other than that, my suggestion would be to try linking one of the Catalyst examples from https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode and see how that works for you. Another thing you could try is using a newer version of CMake from https://cmake.org/download/. For the Linux x86_64 tarball, you can just untar the executables from that and use directly.

Hello again,


I'm (finally) trying to get Catalyst to successfully link to our application code on Excalibur (Cray, ARL HPC). I was able to build paraview and all of the dependencies thanks to help I've gotten on the list here in the past. However, when I try to link my code to it (and this is a code that works fine with Catalyst on other platforms), I get:

The section in my CMakeLists that looks for paraview is:

and it doesn't seem to work. On other machines, I never needed to set the PARAVIEW_CP_ROOT variable, it always just found it. When I build my code, I point the paraview directory (where it finds the paraviewConfig.cmake file) to:

and it seems to find it okay.


Lastly, the vtkPVPythonCatalyst.so library is in the lib/paraview-4.4/site-packages/vtk directory and there is libvtkPVPythonCatalyst-pv4.4.so<http://libvtkPVPythonCatalyst-pv4.4.so>* and libvtkPVPythonCatalystPython27D-pv4.4.so<http://libvtkPVPythonCatalystPython27D-pv4.4.so>* in lib/paraview-4.4/


I'm at a loss to understand why it is reporting the module is missing -- did I miss something somewhere?


Thanks as always,

Message-ID: <1462863894054.37762@rwth-aachen.de>

Dear community,

I am currently trying to find a way to visualize load paths with results from static finite element analysis within solid structures. For this FE-analysis I use Altairs software suite (Hypermesh/Optistruct/Hyperview).

>From reading several different publications I know that there is an easy way to visualize the load path with the attached file with the use of TecPlot (Couldn't attach file because it exceeds 500 KB).
I received the attached file from Herbert Moldenhauer who relys on D.W. Kellys methods for visulaizing the load path within structures.

It would really help a lot to get more information about the background of the stream tracer filters, because I am currently struggeling to format the input properly. As far as I know I need a field of vectors ("The dataset must contain a field array with 3 Components. An Array of vectors (point-centered) is required"), but with the attached file for example I am not able to use the stream tracer filter.
I have exported my Stress tensor, my Nodal IDs and Nodaml Coordinates.

Your help would be greatly appreciated!!!
Thank you very much in advance!

Asaad

We are experiencing timeout with midas currently.
Please recompile, it should work.

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView] How to add thickness to each slice when

Message-ID: <CAJFKOL3n3RCU=O0461Ro6c7aiA+Pog_z8mG9dMkneBuSe7nhCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

My goal is to generate a 3D model of  human organ.

Suppose i have segmented images in each set(each slice is saved using
MatLab software).

So i want to know what are the options which paraview have in order to add
the thickness to each slice.

Your feedback is appreciated.

Hello Miss, Mister,
I have some troubleregarding my paraview file: i must create an paraview type xml programm which calls other xml files each of them specialized in different datas (geometry, topology, et c...)What type of strucuture should i use for that?Thank you very much for your help.
Here is an exemple of what i did (it didn't work):
<?xml version="1.0"?><VTKFile type="PUnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="BigEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">  <PUnstructuredGrid GhostLevel="0">     <PPointData Scalars="my_scalars">       <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="my_scalars"/>     </PPointData>                   <Piece Source="polyEx0.vtp"/><PCellData Scalars="cell_scalars" Normals="cell_normals">       <PDataArray type="Int32" Name="cell_scalars"/>       <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="cell_normals" NumberOfComponents="3"/>     </PCellData>    <PPoints>       <PDataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii"/>    </PPoints>     <Piece Source="polyEx1.vtp"/>  </PUnstructuredGrid></VTKFile>
this is supposed to take some pieces of information from my 2 other programs (polyex0 et polyex1) which are cubes, so in final i should have a cube with some properties of each of the 2 cubes.
Thank you very much for your help,Have a good week!

Also,i need to mention that segmented images are saved as Masks.

Kindly tell me, when using Paraview software should i have to use the
boundary or the mask of the segmented image for the purpose of building a
3D model. (kindly correct me, if i am wrong as i am new to Paraview)

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you.

Which version of CMake are you running?  We have had problems in the past
when using a CMake not built with SSL support pulling new data from midas.
The error messages from that generally look like this:


CMake Error at /apps/pkg/paraview-5.0/src/paraview-5.0/CMake/ExternalData.
cmake:749 (message):
  Object MD5=6c0dd882aa361431b95d7e2feb87fece not found at:


http://midas3.kitware.com/midas/api/rest?method=midas.bitstream.download&checksum=6c0dd882aa361431b95d7e2feb87fece&algorithm=MD5
("Unsupported protocol")

http://www.paraview.org/files/ExternalData/MD5/6c0dd882aa361431b95d7e2feb87fece
("HTTP response code said error")
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /apps/pkg/paraview-5.0/src/paraview-5.0/CMake/ExternalData.cmake:771
(_ExternalData_download_object)

If this is the problem you will need to download a new CMake that is built
with SSL support or build one yourself.

HTH,
Shawn

Update: So I just tried to do a clean build of ParaView master.... I get
this error consistently and I know my CMake is built with SSL.  I'll look
into it.

Hi Tim,

If I remember correctly, that was VTK's suggested way at that time with
dealing with arrays that had different memory layouts than VTK used (and
yes, I think I may have put that in the code). In PV master now there's a
much better way of doing it (it's not in PV 5.0.1 but will be in PV 5.1).
If you use the vtkSOADataArrayTemplate class it will save on memory and be
more efficient. An example looks like:
    vtkSOADataArrayTemplate<double>* coords =
vtkSOADataArrayTemplate<double>::New();
    coords->SetNumberOfComponents(3);
    coords->SetNumberOfTuples(this->NumPoints);
    coords->SetArray(0, this->CoordsArray, this->NumPoints, false, true);
    coords->SetArray(1, this->CoordsArray+this->NumPoints, this->NumPoints,
false, true);
    coords->SetArray(2, this->CoordsArray+this->NumPoints*2,
this->NumPoints, false, true);

Here, CoordsArray is a double* that stores the coordinates in SOA form (x0,
x1, x2, ..., y0, y1, y2, ..., z0, z1, z2, ...) and NumPoints is the number
of points in the array (i.e. the length of the array divided by 3). Some
very fine details are at http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Tutorials/DataArrays
if you want to read more about it but that's really for people writing VTK
filters and stuff like that.

As for the warning, you can comment that out in the code if it's generating
too much noise.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView] How to add thickness to each slice when
 generating a 3D model
Message-ID: <9FD2921C-2243-4BE3-A1A3-599AE313360D@sandia.gov>

I think we need more information before we can answer your questions.

Your first question was how to ?add thickness? to image slices. If you have image slices, you usually want to load them in as a 3D stack and treat them like a volume. The spacing between the slices is typically specified by the data file itself or by an option in the reader (of which there are almost 100 different types in ParaView). So how you do that depends on your data format.

You simply said that your data comes from MATLAB. That?s not very specific, since it is possible to output lots of different types of files from MATLAB. If you are not doing it yet, you might consider this MATLAB module that writes out VTK files (which ParaView handles very well): http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47814-export-3d-data-to-paraview-in-vtk-legacy-file-format . I haven?t used it myself (I use MATLAB very infrequently), but it looks pretty full featured. You might want to check that out.

You also mentioned that the image segmentation is represented by masks. The easiest way to deal with that is probably to use the Threshold filter to remove all cells that are masked out.

Also,i need to mention that segmented images are saved as Masks.

Kindly tell me, when using Paraview software should i have to use the boundary or the mask of the segmented image for the purpose of building a 3D model. (kindly correct me, if i am wrong as i am new to Paraview)

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you.

Hello everyone,

My goal is to generate a 3D model of  human organ.

Suppose i have segmented images in each set(each slice is saved using MatLab software).

So i want to know what are the options which paraview have in order to add the thickness to each slice.

Your feedback is appreciated.

Hello Miss, Mister,

I have some troubleregarding my paraview file: i must create an paraview type xml programm which calls other xml files each of them specialized in different datas (geometry, topology, et c...)
What type of strucuture should i use for that?
Thank you very much for your help.

Here is an exemple of what i did (it didn't work):

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="PUnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="BigEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <PUnstructuredGrid GhostLevel="0">
     <PPointData Scalars="my_scalars">

     </PPointData>
    <Piece Source="polyEx0.vtp"/>
<PCellData Scalars="cell_scalars" Normals="cell_normals">
       <PDataArray type="Int32" Name="cell_scalars"/>
       <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="cell_normals" NumberOfComponents="3"/>
     </PCellData>
    <PPoints>
       <PDataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii"/>
    </PPoints>
    <Piece Source="polyEx1.vtp"/>
  </PUnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

this is supposed to take some pieces of information from my 2 other programs (polyex0 et polyex1) which are cubes, so in final i should have a cube with some properties of each of the 2 cubes.

Thank you very much for your help,
Have a good week!

Chathuri Gunasekera,

(Responding back to ParaView list to allow others to see and comment.)

1. I?m not sure why you are not see the 3 holes you expect in your mask. It looks like most of your process is building the data in MATLAB. Perhaps something is going wrong there. ParaView must be recognizing the mask since the region outside of the external boundary is removed. Are you sure your three holds are represented in the mask?

2. It sounds like you are finding the mask boundary in a slice. A slice is by definition contained in a 2D plane. You can restore the 2mm thickness manually by running the Extract Surface filter and then the Linear Extrusion filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] [ParaView] How to add thickness to each slice when generating a 3D model

Hi Ken,

Your  detailed description is very much appreciated. Thank you so much.

Kindly note that following is what i have done in MatLab :
a. Segmented images as Masks (just x,y cordinates)
b. Saved as a .mat file
c. Then append z coordinate( z coordinate is the slice thickness which, each slice has a thickness of 2mm) to the above said mask. Hence, now the image is 3D (saved as .mat file)
d. Convert the 3D image into real world coordinates . So x,y,z all are in mm now.  (saved as .mat file)
e. Since i have about 8 sets and about 50 images per set. Then find the smallest dimension for a particular set.
f. Crop the image (saved as .mat file)
g. Stack the image (saved as .mat file)
h. Finally convert the .mat file to .vtk file
i. Then open the .vtk files in Paraview
Let me send you 2 outputs which i have obtained so far

1. segmented masked images. I prefer this method because this image looks close to my expectation(i expect a 3D model). Also i have 3 more masks which represent 3 more features inside the big mask (meaning i expect 3 holes inside the big image). But i simply cannot see the 3 holes inside this big mask. What mistake i am doing here? Why can't i see the 3 holes inside the big mask.

2. segmented masked --> converted RGB image to binary and then find the boundary of the mask. So the reason for why i asked the thickness is that for this output i can't see the 2mm thickness .

Kindly note that in order to obtain above output i have used couple of masks(slices) and  stacked them together.

Your assistance is really appreciated here as i was struggling to get a proper 3D model for sometime now and all my efforts are not succeeded yet.

Thank you.

I think we need more information before we can answer your questions.

Your first question was how to ?add thickness? to image slices. If you have image slices, you usually want to load them in as a 3D stack and treat them like a volume. The spacing between the slices is typically specified by the data file itself or by an option in the reader (of which there are almost 100 different types in ParaView). So how you do that depends on your data format.

You simply said that your data comes from MATLAB. That?s not very specific, since it is possible to output lots of different types of files from MATLAB. If you are not doing it yet, you might consider this MATLAB module that writes out VTK files (which ParaView handles very well): http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47814-export-3d-data-to-paraview-in-vtk-legacy-file-format . I haven?t used it myself (I use MATLAB very infrequently), but it looks pretty full featured. You might want to check that out.

You also mentioned that the image segmentation is represented by masks. The easiest way to deal with that is probably to use the Threshold filter to remove all cells that are masked out.

Also,i need to mention that segmented images are saved as Masks.

Kindly tell me, when using Paraview software should i have to use the boundary or the mask of the segmented image for the purpose of building a 3D model. (kindly correct me, if i am wrong as i am new to Paraview)

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you.

Hello everyone,

My goal is to generate a 3D model of  human organ.

Suppose i have segmented images in each set(each slice is saved using MatLab software).

So i want to know what are the options which paraview have in order to add the thickness to each slice.

Your feedback is appreciated.

Hi to all,

@ Ken, thank you so much for your response. Really admire it.

1. Yes, i am 100% certain that all the masks are called in.
But let me be more into detail.
Basically, i have: 1 big mask and 3 patches (which are also saved as
masks). Sorry Ken, i think i should have use patch instead of hole [ this
patch eventually represent some special features{but these features
eventually build up as tubes when it comes to a 3D model.} in a human organ
as i am trying to model a human organ itself ]. ANyhow, i am sorry if i
make you confuse.

You're right Ken, most of the stuff is done in MatLab but all the work
looks error-free(because it works fine atleast in MatLab). But i am skeptic
of one thing. Should i have to have a transparent big mask in order to see
the 3 patches inside the big mask?  Is that why , i don't see the patches ?
Kindly guide me.

2. I will try that out too.

Anyhow, thank you so much for your detailed response Ken. That is a great
help.

Message-ID: <CAA7GnUmU02yvMQfVwX8VOG9t6SdvXEHUzTpx=KSGUc7ipu+07w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys,

Wondering how should I go about remote rendering and visualization in a
CAVE. I can visualize in a CAVE using an on-premise server physically
connected to the projectors driving the CAVE, and using my laptop as the
client. But how would I pass a PVX file if this server is somewhere on
Amazon etc?

I could improve the lag by either distributing the MPI processes to another
node or using just a single process. I think the framerate is fine for
larger datasets. Only for my tiny (~20 triangles) dataset I was slightly
disappointed, because I expected more fluent user interaction.

Back to my initial, second question on live rendering of incoming data: I
found that this is probably best handled by Catalyst, isn't it? Then I will
try study how to include the Catalyst Adaptors and Pipelines into my code,
and I will probably come back with a new post asking about some Catalyst
details.

Thank you
Sven

As we are having trouble running the latest versions of Paraview due to our antiquated graphics libraries, is there anything special that has to be done to be run the legacy rendering backend?

Dear community,

I am currently trying to find a way to visualize load paths with results from static finite element analysis within solid structures. For this FE-analysis I use Altairs software suite (Hypermesh/Optistruct/Hyperview).
It would really help a lot to get more information about the background of the stream tracer filters, because I am currently struggeling to format the input properly. As far as I know I need a field of vectors ("The dataset must contain a field array with 3 Components. An Array of vectors (point-centered) is required"), but I am not able to format my FE Output into a proper order so that paraview is able to apply stream tracers.
I have exported my Stress tensor, my Nodal IDs and Nodal Coordinates.

Your help would be greatly appreciated!!!
Thank you very much in advance!

Asaad

You have to build ParaView from source with VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND
cmake variable set to OpenGL. Currently, we don't distribute binaries
legacy OpenGL backend.

Such errors happen when downloading test data and baselines due to
either server or network issues. If you are not running tests, simply
turn OFF BUILD_TESTING CMake flag. Alternatively try again after some
time. If is was due to server issues, it typically recovers.

Subject: [Paraview]  Only 1 mask is shown up in the model,
	what happened to the rest?
Message-ID: <CAJFKOL2BA-UE4Oed4+YgG-BykV5hLh8W5HGKJZe8U-O2JOiM4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Suppose i have saved, segmented masks in separate folders.
say,
mask 1 (the large mask) --> folder_1
mask 2 (small mask which needs to be located inside mask 1)  --> folder_2
mask 3 (small mask which needs to be located inside mask 1)  --> folder_3

Then all three masks are called in and eventually stacked the images and
called in from ParaView.

The question is i only see the mask 1.
Is it because mask 1,2 &3 are in same color?

 Can't i give different colors to different masks?

Or else what would be the remedy to see mask 2 & 3 inside mask 1?

Your support is highly appreciated.
Thank you.

Chathuri Gunasekera,

Are your patches available as fields in the data? If so, you should be able to use the Threshold filter with the patches to remove the holes.

Hi to all,

@ Ken, thank you so much for your response. Really admire it.

1. Yes, i am 100% certain that all the masks are called in.
But let me be more into detail.
Basically, i have: 1 big mask and 3 patches (which are also saved as masks). Sorry Ken, i think i should have use patch instead of hole [ this patch eventually represent some special features{but these features eventually build up as tubes when it comes to a 3D model.} in a human organ as i am trying to model a human organ itself ]. ANyhow, i am sorry if i make you confuse.

You're right Ken, most of the stuff is done in MatLab but all the work looks error-free(because it works fine atleast in MatLab). But i am skeptic of one thing. Should i have to have a transparent big mask in order to see the 3 patches inside the big mask?  Is that why , i don't see the patches ? Kindly guide me.

2. I will try that out too.

Anyhow, thank you so much for your detailed response Ken. That is a great help.

Chathuri Gunasekera,

(Responding back to ParaView list to allow others to see and comment.)

1. I?m not sure why you are not see the 3 holes you expect in your mask. It looks like most of your process is building the data in MATLAB. Perhaps something is going wrong there. ParaView must be recognizing the mask since the region outside of the external boundary is removed. Are you sure your three holds are represented in the mask?

2. It sounds like you are finding the mask boundary in a slice. A slice is by definition contained in a 2D plane. You can restore the 2mm thickness manually by running the Extract Surface filter and then the Linear Extrusion filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] [ParaView] How to add thickness to each slice when generating a 3D model

Hi Ken,

Your  detailed description is very much appreciated. Thank you so much.

Kindly note that following is what i have done in MatLab :
a. Segmented images as Masks (just x,y cordinates)
b. Saved as a .mat file
c. Then append z coordinate( z coordinate is the slice thickness which, each slice has a thickness of 2mm) to the above said mask. Hence, now the image is 3D (saved as .mat file)
d. Convert the 3D image into real world coordinates . So x,y,z all are in mm now.  (saved as .mat file)
e. Since i have about 8 sets and about 50 images per set. Then find the smallest dimension for a particular set.
f. Crop the image (saved as .mat file)
g. Stack the image (saved as .mat file)
h. Finally convert the .mat file to .vtk file
i. Then open the .vtk files in Paraview
Let me send you 2 outputs which i have obtained so far

1. segmented masked images. I prefer this method because this image looks close to my expectation(i expect a 3D model). Also i have 3 more masks which represent 3 more features inside the big mask (meaning i expect 3 holes inside the big image). But i simply cannot see the 3 holes inside this big mask. What mistake i am doing here? Why can't i see the 3 holes inside the big mask.

2. segmented masked --> converted RGB image to binary and then find the boundary of the mask. So the reason for why i asked the thickness is that for this output i can't see the 2mm thickness .

Kindly note that in order to obtain above output i have used couple of masks(slices) and  stacked them together.

Your assistance is really appreciated here as i was struggling to get a proper 3D model for sometime now and all my efforts are not succeeded yet.

Thank you.

I think we need more information before we can answer your questions.

Your first question was how to ?add thickness? to image slices. If you have image slices, you usually want to load them in as a 3D stack and treat them like a volume. The spacing between the slices is typically specified by the data file itself or by an option in the reader (of which there are almost 100 different types in ParaView). So how you do that depends on your data format.

You simply said that your data comes from MATLAB. That?s not very specific, since it is possible to output lots of different types of files from MATLAB. If you are not doing it yet, you might consider this MATLAB module that writes out VTK files (which ParaView handles very well): http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47814-export-3d-data-to-paraview-in-vtk-legacy-file-format . I haven?t used it myself (I use MATLAB very infrequently), but it looks pretty full featured. You might want to check that out.

You also mentioned that the image segmentation is represented by masks. The easiest way to deal with that is probably to use the Threshold filter to remove all cells that are masked out.

Kindly tell me, when using Paraview software should i have to use the boundary or the mask of the segmented image for the purpose of building a 3D model. (kindly correct me, if i am wrong as i am new to Paraview)

Hope to hear from you soon.

it works (runs) in Paraview as programmable filter or programmable source,
but it doesn't run in tools > python shell, or as a macro... why is this?

I can think of two ways:
1) vnc or better display forwarding between the N cloud nodes and the N
CAVE tile nodes
2) run paraview in split dataserver/renderserver mode where the cloud runs
data server and does data processing and then the first N nodes send the
surface geometry to the N renderserver nodes which drive the tiles

I haven't personally tried either option with a CAVE so I don't know what
monsters are hiding in either the path.

Hi,

Thanks alot  for your response, Ken.
Herewith,pls see the attachment: how the 3 small masks are looked like. So
the large mask(it's not seen here) encompass all three masks. All 4 masks
are saved in different folders and all of them have been called in, stacked
together and converted to vtk to call into Paraview.
So how should i move forward in order to make visible the small 3 masks in
the model?
Let me know anyone of your thoughts about it.

Without seeing the actual vtk file you are using, it is hard to give you the exact steps. I am assuming that when you say the masks are ?stacked together? that they are available as field variables (for example, you can color the surface by them). Furthermore, I assume by ?make visible? the masks, you mean removed the masked out cells so that you can see through the holes in the data.

To do that, after you load your vtk file, add the Threshold filter. Set the ?Scalars? property to the mask variable and then set the range to the mask value you want to pass.

Hi,

Thanks alot  for your response, Ken.
Herewith,pls see the attachment: how the 3 small masks are looked like. So the large mask(it's not seen here) encompass all three masks. All 4 masks are saved in different folders and all of them have been called in, stacked together and converted to vtk to call into Paraview.
So how should i move forward in order to make visible the small 3 masks in the model?
Let me know anyone of your thoughts about it.

Are your patches available as fields in the data? If so, you should be able to use the Threshold filter with the patches to remove the holes.

Hi to all,

@ Ken, thank you so much for your response. Really admire it.

1. Yes, i am 100% certain that all the masks are called in.
But let me be more into detail.
Basically, i have: 1 big mask and 3 patches (which are also saved as masks). Sorry Ken, i think i should have use patch instead of hole [ this patch eventually represent some special features{but these features eventually build up as tubes when it comes to a 3D model.} in a human organ as i am trying to model a human organ itself ]. ANyhow, i am sorry if i make you confuse.

You're right Ken, most of the stuff is done in MatLab but all the work looks error-free(because it works fine atleast in MatLab). But i am skeptic of one thing. Should i have to have a transparent big mask in order to see the 3 patches inside the big mask?  Is that why , i don't see the patches ? Kindly guide me.

2. I will try that out too.

Anyhow, thank you so much for your detailed response Ken. That is a great help.

Chathuri Gunasekera,

(Responding back to ParaView list to allow others to see and comment.)

1. I?m not sure why you are not see the 3 holes you expect in your mask. It looks like most of your process is building the data in MATLAB. Perhaps something is going wrong there. ParaView must be recognizing the mask since the region outside of the external boundary is removed. Are you sure your three holds are represented in the mask?

2. It sounds like you are finding the mask boundary in a slice. A slice is by definition contained in a 2D plane. You can restore the 2mm thickness manually by running the Extract Surface filter and then the Linear Extrusion filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] [ParaView] How to add thickness to each slice when generating a 3D model

Hi Ken,

Your  detailed description is very much appreciated. Thank you so much.

Kindly note that following is what i have done in MatLab :
a. Segmented images as Masks (just x,y cordinates)
b. Saved as a .mat file
c. Then append z coordinate( z coordinate is the slice thickness which, each slice has a thickness of 2mm) to the above said mask. Hence, now the image is 3D (saved as .mat file)
d. Convert the 3D image into real world coordinates . So x,y,z all are in mm now.  (saved as .mat file)
e. Since i have about 8 sets and about 50 images per set. Then find the smallest dimension for a particular set.
f. Crop the image (saved as .mat file)
g. Stack the image (saved as .mat file)
h. Finally convert the .mat file to .vtk file
i. Then open the .vtk files in Paraview
Let me send you 2 outputs which i have obtained so far

1. segmented masked images. I prefer this method because this image looks close to my expectation(i expect a 3D model). Also i have 3 more masks which represent 3 more features inside the big mask (meaning i expect 3 holes inside the big image). But i simply cannot see the 3 holes inside this big mask. What mistake i am doing here? Why can't i see the 3 holes inside the big mask.

2. segmented masked --> converted RGB image to binary and then find the boundary of the mask. So the reason for why i asked the thickness is that for this output i can't see the 2mm thickness .

Kindly note that in order to obtain above output i have used couple of masks(slices) and  stacked them together.

Your assistance is really appreciated here as i was struggling to get a proper 3D model for sometime now and all my efforts are not succeeded yet.

Thank you.

I think we need more information before we can answer your questions.

Your first question was how to ?add thickness? to image slices. If you have image slices, you usually want to load them in as a 3D stack and treat them like a volume. The spacing between the slices is typically specified by the data file itself or by an option in the reader (of which there are almost 100 different types in ParaView). So how you do that depends on your data format.

You simply said that your data comes from MATLAB. That?s not very specific, since it is possible to output lots of different types of files from MATLAB. If you are not doing it yet, you might consider this MATLAB module that writes out VTK files (which ParaView handles very well): http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47814-export-3d-data-to-paraview-in-vtk-legacy-file-format . I haven?t used it myself (I use MATLAB very infrequently), but it looks pretty full featured. You might want to check that out.

You also mentioned that the image segmentation is represented by masks. The easiest way to deal with that is probably to use the Threshold filter to remove all cells that are masked out.

Also,i need to mention that segmented images are saved as Masks.

Kindly tell me, when using Paraview software should i have to use the boundary or the mask of the segmented image for the purpose of building a 3D model. (kindly correct me, if i am wrong as i am new to Paraview)

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you.

Message-ID: <CAFvyM3SbkYMWWvmHhmZaXYQCCBYAqgRF=bv=4aRwQiGm=ZD0uQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

so I have a plugin that acquires data across a DDS socket in real-time.
However, I am having trouble calling request data continuously. I can see
the data being piped into ParaView no problem. However, I would like to do
something similar to the PCL Plugin as to when there is a new packet of
data, I would like ParaView to Render the polydata. Is there an example of
something similar to this?

I guess what I am asking, is there an example that shows how to easily
control the Proxy for constant rendering?? Any help is much appreciated.
Thanks guys.

Message-ID: <CA+hDRwLzpYRJ26HpNd6r3_eHSz=D6dJ+Z2R6sZi_BHPGuxsdGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I found that picking is not working with OpenGL2 VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND when
using most recent nvidia drivers from Ubuntu 14.04 software center ie
nvidia-current 304.131-0ubuntu0.14.04.1:

-> NVidia binary X.Org driver ('current' driver)
-> Optimized hardware acceleration of OpenGL with nvidia graphic cards
-> 190,9 MB when installed
-> Canonical provides critical updates supplied by the developers of NVidia
binary X.Org driver ('current' driver) until maggio 2019.

I'm using a GeforceGTX 560M

This was replicated with both paraview 5.0.1 OpenGL2 binary downloaded from
paraview site and local debug build.

There seems to be some issues with:
int vtkOpenGLRenderWindow::GetColorBufferSizes(int *rgba) and
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Rendering/vtkSMRenderViewProxy.cxx since line
179 will return:

"Selection not supported due to insufficient color depth."


Selection is OK with latest nvidia drivers from nvidia.com: version 361.42

Dear community,

my last two questions haven't been answered, so I guess my way of asking wasn't appropriate. So I'll try again:
I need to put the following Information from a FE-Calculation into a file format that can be read by paraview. And that can be used with Stream Tracers:

(Node ID)
Nodal Coordinates
Nodal Stresses XX YY ZZ XY XZ YZ

I know how to make paraview interpret the Coordinates as Points but I don't know how to make paraview interpret the Nodal Stresses as Components of Vectors.

Any hint or Idea would be greatly appreciated!!!
Thank you very much in advance!

Asaad

Hello

ParaView StreamTracer works only on 3-components arrays, not 6-components
array.
You will need to convert your tensors into a vectors before being able to
use it with the StreamTracer.

Subject: [Paraview] C++ Plugin Filter
Message-ID: <1463073317462.75301@kit.edu>

Hi,


could somebody help me on how to implement a filter with C++ in Paraview, which is capable of reacting on external events by invalidating itself, so that next time when a frame is rendered, the filter (and the dependent pipeline parts if any) get(s) reexecuted. I mainly need it for view-dependent filtering, but you can also consider an input reader that reexecutes when the file is changed as an example.


Thank you for the answers in advance. Kind regards:


Tam?s Sz?p

Thanks for your reply.

Yeah, I think biggest one would be network latency. I'll try it soon, and
report how it goes.

Agreed. And comparing options 1 and 2, with 1 you pay the latency on every
camera motion. With 2 you pay it only when the data changes. This is the
same as client side rendering for standard ParaView. This is less of an
advantage as is used to be because video streaming technologies have
recently improved substantially.

good luck

Hi everyone,

With respect to visualization a 3D model, is there a possibility in
ParaView to overlap three pieces(three masks) together (which are saved
separately) and then combine to form a 3D model ?

Hi I am accessing netcdf file from Python interface in Paraview, My
main goal is to access different parameters change in air and
temperature with respect to time.


Can anyone point me towards and example Python code which can show
demonstration of Paraview and netcdf files from using Python code?

Hello,

I have 2 grids (sharing the same nodes). On ParaView-5.0.0, when 
attribute names differ in grids, data can not be visualized : is this 
intended ? If yes why ? If no, how to file a bug ?

Thanks,

Arshpreet Singh,

I highly recommend you take a look at the Python trace feature in the ParaView GUI. It will automatically create Python code that replicates things you do in the GUI, which I find much easier than trying to write the Python code from scratch. The Python trace feature is documented in both the ParaView tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) and the ParaView User?s guide (http://www.paraview.org/paraview-guide/), both of which are available for free.

As an example, I have attached a Python script that loads a netCDF file, shows a variable, and animates over time. I generated this in the ParaView GUI in less time than it took me to write the rest of this email.

Hi,

You might want to check following link,

https://www.dkrz.de/Nutzerportal-en/doku/vis/sw/paraview

There are sample datasets (mostly netcdf files) and a tutorial document 
that are dedicated to climate data analysis. I hope it helps.

Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Vtp file calling other files
Message-ID: <BAY182-W563FEAEE93A16B5781B805D1480@phx.gbl>

Hello Miss, Mister,
I want to combine lots of files for my animation so that i can save space in my computer, however i get messages of error about the fact that the file cannot be read, could you help me please?
Here is an example with the cube:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="PolyData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude">
 <PolyData>
   <Piece NumberOfPoints="8" NumberOfVerts="0" NumberOfLines="0"
          NumberOfStrips="0" NumberOfPolys="6">
    <Points>
     <DataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="XML">
         <xi:include href="nodes.xml" parse="text"/>
     </DataArray>
    </Points>
    <PointData Scalars="my_scalars">
     <DataArray type="Float32" Name="my_scalars" format="ascii">
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0
     </DataArray>
    </PointData>
    <Polys>
     <DataArray type="Int32" Name="connectivity" format="ascii">
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 5 4 2 3 7 6 0 4 7 3 1 2 6 5
     </DataArray>
     <DataArray type="Int32" Name="offsets" format="ascii">
       4 8 12 16 20 24
     </DataArray>
    </Polys>
   </Piece>
  </PolyData>
</VTKFile>

The use of Xinclude works with xdmf but i have some trouble with the animation, so i want to use through vtp files.

Thank you very much for your help!

Houssen,

Could you specify which reader you are using? xdmf2 or xdmf3?
You mention PV5.0.0 - do you mean it used to work with previous releases?

Just to clarify, the scenario that makes problem is : select all cells, 
go to selection inspector, visualize (in 3D viewer) values on cells and 
/ or points (this triggers errors).
My understanding is that both xdmf (OK and KO) are valid and should 
work. OK.xdmf works (whatever PV version), but, KO.xdmf do not (whatever 
PV version).
The problem appears when attribute names differ on different grids : 
this looks (not sure) like a bug to me.

With PV5.0.0 + default XDMF reader (which should be XDMF2 if I 
understand correctly), I get :
Warning: In 
/scratch/ParaView-v5.0.0-source/VTK/Rendering/Label/vtkLabeledDataMapper.cxx,

in input.

Note : I tested with all point and cell values, only node values 
triggers error, cell values "do nothing".

With PV5.0.0 + XDMF3 reader, I get:

exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

With PV4.0.1 + default XDMF reader (which should be XDMF2 if I 
understand correctly), I get :

Subject: [Paraview] capability of ParaView,
 Catalyst in distributed computing environment ...
Message-ID: <e9768429-788d-e781-80cb-db20cfb863ec@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi All,

I just wonder about the capability of ParaView, Catalyst in distributed 
computing environment. I have little bit experience in in-situ 
visualization but it is hard for me to see the big picture at this 
point. So, i decided to ask to the user list to get some suggestion from 
the experts. Hypothetically, lets assume that we have two simulation 
code that are coupled together (i.e. fluid-structure interaction) and 
both of them have their own MPI_COMM_WORLD and run on different 
processors (model1 runs on MPI rank 0,1,2,3 and model2 runs on 4,5,6,7). 
What is the correct design to create integrated in-situ visualization 
analysis (both model contributes to same visualization pipeline) in this 
case? Do you know any implementation that is similar to this design? At 
least, is it possible?

In this case, the adaptor code will need to access to two different 
MPI_COMM_WORLD and it could run on all processor (from 0 to 7) or its 
own MPI_COMM_WORLD (i.e. MPI ranks 8,9,10,11). Also, the both simulation 
code have its own grid and field definitions (might be handled via 
defining different input ports). Does it create a problem in Paraview, 
Catalyst side, if the multiblock dataset is used to define the grids of 
the components in adaptor. I am asking because some MPI processes 
(belongs to adaptor code) will not have data for specific model 
component due to the domain decomposition implementation of the 
individual models. For example, MPI rank 4,5,6,7 will not have data for 
model1 (that runs on MPI rank 0,1,2,3) and 0,1,2,3 will not have data 
for model2 (that runs on MPI rank 4,5,6,7). To that end, do i need to 
collect all the data from the components? If this is the case, how can i 
handle 2d decomposition problem? Because, the adaptor code has no any 
common grid structure that fits for all the model components.

Regards,

Ufuk Turuncoglu

You may need to rebuild mesa with drivers that support OpenGL 3.2 and newer.

See this post:
https://blog.kitware.com/messing-with-mesa-for-paraview-5-0vtk-7-0/

Alternatively, as the post mentions, try running the binary are
> paraview --mesa-llvm

That will use the packaged mesa libGL and hopefully circumvent the issue.

Hi,

I'm a bit confused. MPI_COMM_WORLD is the global communicator and as far as
I'm aware, can't be modified which means there can't be two different
communicators.

Catalyst can be set to use a specific MPI communicator and that's been done
by at least one code (Code_Saturne). I think they have a multiphysics
simulation as well.

Cheers,
Andy

Yes, you are right. In this case, there will be two separate
MPI_COMM_WORLD. Plus, one that covers all the resources (let's say that
global MPI_COMM_WORLD). Actually, this kind of setup is very common for
multi-physics applications such as fluid-structure interaction. So, is it
possible to tight this kind of environment with Catalyst? I am not expert
about Catalyst but it seems that there might be a problem in the rendering
stage even underlying grids and fields are defined without any problem.

I'm not sure if this is exactly what the original user is referring to, but it is possible to have two separate codes communicate using MPI through the dynamic processes in MPI-2. Essentially, one program starts up on N processors and begins running and gets an MPI_COMM_WORLD. It then spawns another executable on M different processors and that new executable will call MPI_INIT and also get its own MPI_COMM_WORLD. So you have two, disjoint MPI_COMM_WORLD's that get linked together through a newly created intercommunicator.


I've used this to couple a structural mechanics code to our fluid dynamics solver for example. It sounds like that is similar to what is being done here.


How that would interact with coprocessing is beyond my knowledge though. It does sound like an interesting problem and one I would be very curious to find out the details.

Message-ID: <BN3PR07MB262760FBB90D3D0FDF41BCDC9D490@BN3PR07MB2627.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

I'm fairly sure this has been discussed somewhere before, but my search engine skills are failing me right now.


I would like to take the spanwise average of a 3D dataset to create a 2D plane of the averaged data. In my case, things are (relatively) friendly -- it's a channel with a uniform, structured mesh in the Z direction and I would like to average the data in Z to create an X-Y plane of the averaged data. What complicates it for me is that it is a multiblock dataset with multiple blocks in that spanwise direction.


Is there a filter or set of filters that would compute the spanwise average and return a slice as a result?


Thanks,


Tim

Message-ID: <b6c717e56b7e45b986e96ff82f40e2d6@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Is it necessary to include the list of blocks in the script similar to the line below or is it possible to say "all" to include all of the blocks all of the time or something similar?



o   activesourcefile.ElementBlocks = ['block_1', 'block_2', 'block_3']


Thanks,

Alan

Subject: [Paraview] paraview superbuild on Win7 with ninja/vs2013/qt4/mpi
Message-ID: <CADLMsL4YfC63L-sTCFmfYd64y+jTq5Wkgnjhv-wH=qnY+JnskQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I've been trying to "superbuild" paraview 5.0 on Win7 without success.
I keep getting two errors:
1) the first one is related to szip at the beginning of the build
2) the second and last one is  ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed

nothing else.
I really need some help please...

the following article discusses averaging techniques, such as a 3D longitudinal averaging, which is what you are looking for.

looping over your multi-blocks should be a rather simple extension.

Subject: [Paraview] How to get the object contour?
Message-ID: <CAJFKOL37vLsGmfoYdD-b013Uhh8trDRpZa40N+j97=uEUr8tGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,

With the generated 3D model, i have 2 questions, as follows:

(1). i can only see separate slices instead of the contour of the object,
How to get the object contour?

Following is what i followed:
 [selected Filter--> alphabetical-->calculate-->scalars-->volume
scalars-->Apply--> coloring(Result)--> representation (volume) ]

(2) Is there a specific way to add Slice Thickness in Paraview?

Thank you in advance.

Warm regards,
Chathuri Gunasekera.

Hello,

Did you compiled ninja using your VS2013?
Do you start ninja from a Visual Studio 2013 command line (so that cmake
can find VS compiler in the environment)?

Hi everyone,I have been trying for the past couple of day to replicate the show Widget (eg : show Plane, show Box display ) in ParaView web. In the desktop version, when you add a filter slice with Plane type, you get a red rectangle representing your widget with axes to easily move it. How do you enable this feature in ParaView web? In some old version of ParaView ( http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_PWApp) it was possible. ThanksMichal

Hi Michal,

That feature is not currently available as a protocol on the Python side.

It is possible to add it back, but will take some time especially since we
have other focus regarding the Visualizer improvements...
Moreover, we dynamically generate the UI, which will make the 3D widget
toggle a little be more trickier compare to a adhoc UI like the one that
was done for PWApp.

Are you trying to enable it for a custom application, or are you looking
for having that feature in the ParaViewWeb Visualizer?

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Connect ParaViewWeb to Catalyst
Message-ID: <CAJZHu4SGdhWKB4bALZL47ykt3LhHEhZuv20eyGs81aG2=35ctw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am looking for the recommended steps how to display an in-situ (live)
Catalyst simulation through ParaViewWeb.

After some efforts I am able to run ParaViewWeb successfully and I can view
a Catalyst-enabled simulation in paraview.

I hope, it is also possible to show the live Catalyst output via
ParaViewWeb, but I cannot imagine how to achieve this. I tried starting a
pvserver as mentioned at the end of
https://blog.kitware.com/introduction-to-paraview-catalyst-live/ and giving
"--ds-host localhost --ds-port 11111" options to pv_web_visualizer.py, but
it doesn't help. I can't share anything to be displayed on the web.

Below you find the (not too detailed) steps I took to have a working
solution for either Catalyst-enabled simulations or a working web
visualizer:

Test connection from Catalyst simulation to paraview:
1) Build and execute paraview from ParaView-v5.0.1-source.tar.gz (from
http://www.paraview.org/download/)
2) Choose Catalyst->Connect in paraview
3) Run CFullExample from
https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode
4) Pipeline from CFullExample is shown in paraview.
Success!

Test ParaViewWeb:
1) Download ParaViewData-5.0.0.tar.gz from http://www.paraview.org/download/,
extract in /data
2) Run $ParaView_DIR/bin/pvpython
$ParaView_DIR/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --content
$ParaView_DIR/www  --data-dir /data --port 8080
3) Open the Visualizer App http://localhost:8080/apps/Visualizer/
Success!

But how do I get Catalyst into the web visualizer? Is there any example how
to combine them? Anybody who can suggest the required steps?

Regards,
Sven

Hi Samuel,

Thank you so much for your response.

Unfortunately, i have not used PV clip filters at all to generate slice
thickness. I am sorry to confuse you, but i need to add the slice thickness
to my 2D image instead

Warm regards,
Chathuri

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 5.0.1: Export Scene to pdf -- appears in white
Message-ID: <CALsG1Z_TQqXofOy-ke=N2SEo5CmdGm65J_9Tr7nLJtrnUBY2cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

I'm using paraview 4.0.1 on my ubuntu 14.04 64bits, the paraview version
coming from ubuntu 14.04 repositories.

The problem is: when I try to 'Export Scene' to pdf, it generates a white
pdf.

So, I compiled ParaView v5.0.1 from its source (without warnings or
errors), but I get the same problem.

I also have downloaded ParaView Binary Installers v5.0, but doesn't come
with 'Export Scene to pdf' option. That's why I'm trying to compile from
source code.

With ParaView Binary Installers v4.3 I have NO problem, but I want to use
the newer version.


So, how can I compile ParaView v5.0.1 to have the option for 'Export Scene'
to pdf?

Thanks in advance.

5.0.1 doesn't support export to PDF, I am afraid. However, "master"
does and so will "5.1"

(cc-ing Dave, just in case I am mistaken)

Thanks Utkarsh. In my ubuntu 16.04 laptop I have installed ParaView 5.0.1
(from ubuntu repositories) and it has the option Export Scene to pdf, and
works perfect.
On the other hand, older paraview versions had the option, and worked.

I think that, maybe, I can get it using some spetial compilling option when
I use ccmake.

Ramiro,

A few things to note:

+ Not sure what's the deal with 4.0.1, but it's too old at this point
so let's ignore that.
+ When you downloaded ParaView 5.0.1 from paraview.org, starting with
5.0.1, we are using a new implementation of the rendering backend for
our binaries [1]. This rendering backend, let's call OpenGL2, doesn't
support exporting to PDF, at least, not in 5.0.1. It's been fixed in
git "master".
+ I suspect ParaView 5.0.1 from Ubuntu is using the old rendering
backend by default. The title bar should say something like "ParaView
5.0.1 (Legacy Rendering Backend)". This backend still support the old
export to PDF code and hence should have that option.
+ When you compiled 5.0.1 from source, I suspect you are getting the
old rendering backend too (unless you changed the CMake variable
VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND to OpenGL2). Not entirely sure why export would
fail in that case. There isn't any special flag to enable PDF export.

However, the best option to try out Export to PDF would be build the
latest "master" from source with VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND set to OpenGL2.

(Dave, do correct me if I am misspoke).

Hello All,

Is the Image Resampling filter applicable to all datasets or only VTK Images? Each time I try to use this filter on any other dataset than a uniform image file, Paraview crashes. In Paraview Help it is written: "Accepts input of following types: vtkDataSet vtkCompositeDataSet". I am using Paraview 5.0.0.

Lukasz,

I'd suggest not to use 'ImageResampling' filter, it was a temporary fix and
clearly is buggy. A new filter has been added to ParaView "master", name
"Resample To Image". That would do what you want to do more reliably. What
platform are you running on? I can send you links to the nightly binaries
for the same.

Hi Sven,

Live catalyst connection require a specific socket connection to the
in-situ process with some special handling.
We did not (yet) wrote the Python code to perform that specific action for
ParaViewWeb so it could be triggered by the web client or configured via an
argument at launch time.
I don't see any reason why this couldn't work, but as for now, I also don't
know an easy step to do it without spending time doing it myself.

Stephane,

I am not sure about the superbuild process. But if your goal is to just build a ParaView for windows platform and not make a ParaView windows build using Superbuild, I can get you with all the dependencies library compiled with VS2013 express (which should be compatible with other VS 2013) that I used to build ParaView from source.

Let me know.

I'm agree. I was just testing to understand what is happening.

In my laptop I have 3 options (pressing enter buttom) for
VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND:  OpenGL, OpenGL2 and None,
but in my desktop I have only one: OpenGL.

I compile paraview in my laptop (ubuntu 16.04) and my desktop (ubuntu
14.04) with exactly the same options in ccmake, in particular: OpenGL.
In my laptop 'Export to pdf' works perfect.
Is this related this the nvidia driver? In my desktop I have installed
nvidia driver, but in my destop I have not installed nvidia driver.

You are right: in the paraview version from ubuntu repository says
"ParaView 5.0.1 (Legacy Rendering Backend)" in the tittle bar.
Also, in my both compiled paraview 5.0.1 appears "ParaView 5.0.1 (Legacy
Rendering Backend)" in the tittle bar too.

Now, in my desktop I'm trying compiling with OpenGL2 option (the option
doesn't comes hiting the enter button, instead of my laptop, but I chosed
writting it), and crossing my fingers.

I appreciate any ideas or suggestions (I don't have more), to find a way for
fix this 'little' problem: to have the export to pdf option.

Thanks again.

This sounds about right. The gl2ps library we use to generate the pdfs was
not compatible with the new OpenGL2 backend, and I had to tweak it a bit to
get it working again. Looking at the git log, the modifications didn't make
it into the 5.0.1 release, so export would only work using the old backend
with that release.

The current development branch supports pdf export on both backends.

I'm curious about the white exported image, though. IIRC, the
vector-graphics export options shouldn't be shown on the versions of
paraview that don't support gl2ps, so if you're able to export, it should
be working. It sounds like you may have also brushed up against one of the
limitations of the gl2ps library -- for instance, it can't handle textured
objects (they'll just appear a solid color, rather than patterned). This
can be problematic as some of the color mapping techniques use textures.

If you're seeing incorrect output, try playing with the "rasterize 3D
geometry" and sort options to see if you can get a better representation of
the scene.

HTH,
Dave

Hi Utkarsh,

I am always building Paraview from source on Linux with all the features I need, but there is no rush, I can wait for the next release or if I badly need this functionality I will pull it from the ?master?.

A little background:
I was actually playing around when I came across the issue, what I want to achieve is to do fast volume rendering on unstructured meshes. The volume rendering algorithms in Paraview are ultrafast with VTK image files but painfully slow with unstructured grids. I constantly have an idea in mind to map unstructured meshes to image files and then do the volume rendering. Simple as it sounds I could not find an automatic way to achieve this, in the end I had to manually generate image files in a text editor. I also tried with the Gaussian Resampling, but this filter fails in parallel, each process generates its own image file but there is no communication between them, it is not possible to resample data onto these images nor is it possible to save them (Paraview saves data from just one process). I am still hoping to find some smart way of generating image files, ideally automatically refined based on some flow variables of interest and then map the unstructured grid data on the generated VTK images for fast volume rendering.

Regards,
Lukasz

Lukasz,

I'd suggest not to use 'ImageResampling' filter, it was a temporary fix and clearly is buggy. A new filter has been added to ParaView "master", name "Resample To Image". That would do what you want to do more reliably. What platform are you running on? I can send you links to the nightly binaries for the same.

Hello All,

Is the Image Resampling filter applicable to all datasets or only VTK Images? Each time I try to use this filter on any other dataset than a uniform image file, Paraview crashes. In Paraview Help it is written: ?Accepts input of following types: vtkDataSet vtkCompositeDataSet?. I am using Paraview 5.0.0.

Lukasz

Hmm, the opengl driver shouldn't matter on the OpenGL1 backend, unless
there was a bug in their feedback rendering mode. Are you trying to export
the same scene on both systems?

I'd suggest just playing with the export options and see if there's a
solution there. If you keep having trouble, send me a small state file that
reproduces the issue and I'll take a look. There are certain cases where
the gl2ps exporter will fail to capture all of the details in a scene,
though it should produce more than an empty white image.

Lukasz,

> The volume rendering algorithms in Paraview are ultrafast with VTK image files but painfully slow with unstructured grids. I constantly have an idea in mind to map unstructured meshes to image files and then do the volume rendering.

That's indeed the reason by the "Resample to Image" filter was created
:). And it's expected to work in parallel for composite datasets too.
Of course, if you spot a bug, do let us know.

It may be possible to do this with Catalyst. I would guess that nearly all
of the complex work would need to be done in the adaptor to integrate this
properly though.

Hello Seb,
glad to read your answer. So the problem is not only that I was unable to
find the relevant information.

You say, you have not (yet) written the required code. Does "not (yet)"
mean that it is on the agenda maybe within the next half year? Then I could
find a workaround and look forward to the next Paraview updates.

Otherwise I would try to work on the implementation for connecting
Paraviewweb to Catalyst output. Is there any developer documentation of
Catalysts "specific socket connection"? Or some general Catalyst developer
information? Those would be great to get started.
My first attempt would be to "wrap" the functionality of
Qt/ApplicationComponents/pqCatalystConnectReaction.cxx into pvserver and
make it available to the web client. Or are the necessary steps much more
involved?

Thank you
Sven

Hi Sven,

I am not aware on any specific developer documentation for Catalyst on the
ParaView side (but I haven't worked on that subject for years), although
Utkarsh or Andy might know.

Usually looking at the code and redoing it in the Python world is what is
required, but as I said, I'm not sure of what it means since I don't know
that code anymore. ;-)

For the timeframe, I can't tell (meaning I don't know), but we can still
try to help you or implement the missing piece via support contract if that
make sense on your end.

Thanks,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Memory leak with Catalyst
Message-ID: <BN3PR07MB262760F2E2ADAA4B8A3A132A9D4B0@BN3PR07MB2627.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,


One of our users is running a very big simulation and writing out images of two slices (two different views) every 1000 iterations and writing out the data for the two slices (two different data writers) as VTK files every 5000 iterations. It is using Paraview 4.4.


After 21000 iterations, the simulation is killed because the memory on the compute nodes fills up. I usually know how to track down memory problems in our code using valgrind and related tools, but is that the right way to go to try and find this problem?


Are there any tips on how to isolate where the problem may be? I don't know if it is in the adapter, or in paraview itself. Has anybody encountered problems with runaway memory using Catalyst in 4.4 when writing images or VTK files?


I know when we use pvpython to generate images and loop over many files, sometimes the memory also blows up and so we usually move the loop over the files outside the pvpython script and into a driver script that executes a new pvpython for each file. Is there a way to shut down/start up Catalyst each time it needs to write something? Is that advisable?


Thanks,


Tim

Subject: [Paraview] Slow with just 1M cells
Message-ID: <4A0C9ECE-56B5-4521-80FE-63B17C1C2ED4@unipg.it>

Paraview is awesome for lots of functionalities, however I find it extremely slow in processing data with any filter type, or in changing timestep as soon as the model size is around one million cells or above. I have experience with a commercial tool which on the same model and pc is 100x faster. Let's say a second vs. a min!

Is there any specific settings for ram of parallelization among cores?

Thanks 
Michele

Hi Tim,

If you build Catalyst with VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS enabled it is pretty good at
finding VTK objects that aren't deleted properly. You should be able to run
this with a small amount of calls to Catalyst as well. If you try this and
want help understanding the output (if an object like a vtkUnstructuredGrid
is leaked it will often give a whole bunch of false leaks that the
unstructured grid is just holding the references to), just share your
output file and I can take a look at it to try and narrow down the culprit.
That may be slightly easier to use than Valgrind.

Beyond this, you could maybe try the same run but without doing any
Catalyst work to see what happens then. That may be a lot of compute cycles
but I'm not sure how else to try and bisect where the memory leak is
occurring.

Initializing and finalizing Catalyst every time you want output would
probably work but I'd think there may be significant overhead doing it like
this. Plus, it's not really solving the problem -- just avoiding it.

Best,
Andy

Hi Andy,


Thanks for the tips. I will get working on the VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS now and see what it turns up.


The initialize/finalize every time is definitely a hack and not for long-term use. But, sponsors want a report on Monday and we need to be able to visualize things for that -- the simulation is too big to write data files and post-process later. So I modified the code to do that for now until I can find a proper fix.


I'll let you know if I get stuck with the log file.


Thanks again,


Tim

VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS, although will catch some serious errors, will not catch 
all kinds of leaks. For example you can have leaks where data 
erroneously accumulates with each time step, but is deleted at program 
termination. VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS will not catch that kind of error. It's 
probably better to use massif to profile your code on a small one node 
run. There's an excellent tool called massif visualizer to aid in 
exploring the data generated.

Thanks for the advice Burlen -- I haven't used Massif before, so this is a good opportunity to give it a try.


The initialize/finalize each time approach doesn't work either. I am calling the Finalize() routine on the vtkCPProcessor class but then when it tries to initialize again, it throws:


Warning: In /data4/ParaView/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketController.cxx, line 50
vtkSocketController (0xa4342f0): Already initialized.


and then crashes. So, hopefully I can sort out the memory leak rather than trying to debug why a hacked fix doesn't work!


Tim

Well... not going so well.


If I run a small simulation with massif and the Release build of paraview, I don't see any growing memory in time. I also get my VTK files and images.


If I run the same simulation linked against a Debug build with VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS on, there is a segfault inside one of the libvtkRendering libraries (it says libvtkRenderingOp but the rest of the name is cut off). If I take the image rendering out of my pipeline (comment out the RegisterView call) and leave the VTK file writing, it runs fine and doesn't report any leaks. I tried to get the segfault to drop a core file, but it won't do it.


I'm thinking that there is an issue in the rendering part causing the leak. I have no idea what it could be though -- this is the 4.4.0 version, is anybody aware of any bug fixes between 4.4.0 and current versions that might be relevant?


Thanks for the help,


Tim

Thanks for the advice Burlen -- I haven't used Massif before, so this is a good opportunity to give it a try.


The initialize/finalize each time approach doesn't work either. I am calling the Finalize() routine on the vtkCPProcessor class but then when it tries to initialize again, it throws:


Warning: In /data4/ParaView/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketController.cxx, line 50
vtkSocketController (0xa4342f0): Already initialized.


and then crashes. So, hopefully I can sort out the memory leak rather than trying to debug why a hacked fix doesn't work!


Tim

VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS, although will catch some serious errors, will not catch all kinds of leaks. For example you can have leaks where data erroneously accumulates with each time step, but is deleted at program termination. VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS will not catch that kind of error. It's probably better to use massif to profile your code on a small one node run. There's an excellent tool called massif visualizer to aid in exploring the data generated.

Hi Andy,


Thanks for the tips. I will get working on the VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS now and see what it turns up.


The initialize/finalize every time is definitely a hack and not for long-term use. But, sponsors want a report on Monday and we need to be able to visualize things for that -- the simulation is too big to write data files and post-process later. So I modified the code to do that for now until I can find a proper fix.


I'll let you know if I get stuck with the log file.


Thanks again,


Tim

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Memory leak with Catalyst

Hi Tim,

If you build Catalyst with VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS enabled it is pretty good at finding VTK objects that aren't deleted properly. You should be able to run this with a small amount of calls to Catalyst as well. If you try this and want help understanding the output (if an object like a vtkUnstructuredGrid is leaked it will often give a whole bunch of false leaks that the unstructured grid is just holding the references to), just share your output file and I can take a look at it to try and narrow down the culprit. That may be slightly easier to use than Valgrind.

Beyond this, you could maybe try the same run but without doing any Catalyst work to see what happens then. That may be a lot of compute cycles but I'm not sure how else to try and bisect where the memory leak is occurring.

Initializing and finalizing Catalyst every time you want output would probably work but I'd think there may be significant overhead doing it like this. Plus, it's not really solving the problem -- just avoiding it.

Best,
Andy

Hi,


One of our users is running a very big simulation and writing out images of two slices (two different views) every 1000 iterations and writing out the data for the two slices (two different data writers) as VTK files every 5000 iterations. It is using Paraview 4.4.


After 21000 iterations, the simulation is killed because the memory on the compute nodes fills up. I usually know how to track down memory problems in our code using valgrind and related tools, but is that the right way to go to try and find this problem?


Are there any tips on how to isolate where the problem may be? I don't know if it is in the adapter, or in paraview itself. Has anybody encountered problems with runaway memory using Catalyst in 4.4 when writing images or VTK files?


I know when we use pvpython to generate images and loop over many files, sometimes the memory also blows up and so we usually move the loop over the files outside the pvpython script and into a driver script that executes a new pvpython for each file. Is there a way to shut down/start up Catalyst each time it needs to write something? Is that advisable?


Thanks,


Tim

Michele,

Taking over a minute to process a data set with 1 million cells does seem like an unreasonably long time, even for a moderately powered PC. Perhaps something odd is happening here. Can you describe in more detail what your data look like and what you are doing with them?

I've just tried to visualize KO.xdmf with visit-2.10.2 : it works fine

Thank you, Seb,
it seems like I am getting it to work. There are still some difficulties
because of my limited javascript experience, but with some quick&dirty
workarounds I do have the Catalyst output displayed from ParaViewWeb. As
you said, nothing else was required than wrapping the C functions in python.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAGbDe5F+QasWTXGNk=t1hyfqFo=OTSn=x9z-ys9h0FxQmVeDuA@mail.gmail.com>

ParaView newbie here ,and sorry to interrupt you for some problems i met.

I have been using two vtk input files which named t1 and t2 for example,
both input files contained only one dataset for CellData may called flux1
and flux2.

Exactly the structure and the data t1 and t2 got were same and only make a
reflect from the surface of the center of x axis.

And I want to make the CellData flux1 to subtrack the flux2.
However I have tried Using the Group Datasets and the Calculator, or Using
the Python Calculator or Programmable filter, and all the result I got is
empty.

The results I tried seems the ParaView only subtracked the data basic on
the Cell ID.

So is there any way to solve it or some wrong operate I made I wondered, or
I must make the datasets reflect before I input ParaView ?

Thanks for any guidance,

Feng

Thanks for the information. Currently, i am working on two component case
and the initial results show that grid and data information belong to each
model component must be accessible by all the MPI processes (defined in
global MPI_COMM_WORLD) in adaptor side. This makes the implementation very
complex when the 2d decomposition configuration of both model components
(which run in a specific subset of processors) are considered. In this
case, it seems that the easiest way is to interpolate/ redistribute the
data of both components into common grid or creating new 2d decomposition
in adaptor. Another possibility might be to implement MPI sections
specific for each model component (basically having two distinct
MPI_COMM_WORLD inside of global one) to access grid and fields in the
adaptor side but in this case i am not sure ParaView could handle these
kind of information or not. Anyway, it seems that it is a challanging
problem and probably it would be good to have this feature. I'll keep to
continue to try different implementations to test different ideas and keep
you posted about it. In the mean time, if you have any other idea, let me
know.

Hello

Python calculator is the way to go here

inputs[0].PointData['flux1'] - inputs[1].PointData['flux2']

Beware of the order of the input, they will be ordered randomly by
paraview, but you can reorder them wia the python shell, or modify your
python-calculator script.

If you can control which communicator Paraview uses, you might want to look at using MPI_INTERCOMM_MERGE, which will take the union of the two disjoint sets described by an intercommunicator. So with that, you would create a new communicator that has all of your processors as members.

Paraview should be able to use that merged communicator seamlessly because it is a single communicator with all of the processor members attached. Meanwhile, your individual codes still use their own MPI_COMM_WORLD and the intercommunicator when they need to share information. 

That way, the codes do not need to change. Your adapter does the work of dealing with the merge process and the managing the merged communicator. 

I haven't tested anything like this of course. Just putting the idea out there.

Tim

Subject: Re: [Paraview] capability of ParaView,      Catalyst in distributed computing environment ...

Thanks for the information. Currently, i am working on two component case
and the initial results show that grid and data information belong to each
model component must be accessible by all the MPI processes (defined in
global MPI_COMM_WORLD) in adaptor side. This makes the implementation very
complex when the 2d decomposition configuration of both model components
(which run in a specific subset of processors) are considered. In this
case, it seems that the easiest way is to interpolate/ redistribute the
data of both components into common grid or creating new 2d decomposition
in adaptor. Another possibility might be to implement MPI sections
specific for each model component (basically having two distinct
MPI_COMM_WORLD inside of global one) to access grid and fields in the
adaptor side but in this case i am not sure ParaView could handle these
kind of information or not. Anyway, it seems that it is a challanging
problem and probably it would be good to have this feature. I'll keep to
continue to try different implementations to test different ideas and keep
you posted about it. In the mean time, if you have any other idea, let me
know.

Regards,

--ufuk

btw, we just had similar problem that was entirely explained by vtk 
writer attempting to gather a bunch of arrays to the root node. Utkarsh 
found a way to disable that behavior. I wonder if you are hitting the same.

Glad to ear that you managed to get something going. If you feel like
sharing your code, we might be able to provide some integration into
ParaView and/or ParaViewWeb proper.

Hello

Actually no, it is actually ordered by proxy global id order, wich is
basically random from a user point of view.
This is not a wanted behavior but ordering using the order of selection
would need some refactoring.

Hello,

Is it possible to create a custom widget for a filter which would allow me to retrieve the results of its computation? I would like to reproduce the functionality of the pqDoubleVectorPropertyWidget and populate it with values computed by the filter. I know how to create and register the widget but I do not know how do I send values to it from the filter. In paraview code base  I found vtkEventQtSlotConnect but I do not know if it is of any use to my problem.

Dear mailing list members,


When I export scenes to X3D then load the mesh into blender or a browser the 
mesh is colour wrong. The colours are there but apparently assigned to random 
cells/vertices. This happens with either PV5 or PV4, especially for category 
colouring. When using e.g. WebGL exporter all is fine.
Is there anything to do special for exporting to X3D? When I use plain VTK, the 
exported colours seemed OK so far.

Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

There are several ways of skinning this cat. Can you elaborate of what
exactly is your use-case? Do you want the default values for this
double-vector-property (DVP) set using some values provided by the VTK
filter, but allow user to override using UI?

Interesting -- I'd be willing to try it out if you have more details (commit hashtag, ticket, etc.), even if I have to figure out how to backport it from a newer version.


Thanks,

btw, we just had similar problem that was entirely explained by vtk writer attempting to gather a bunch of arrays to the root node. Utkarsh found a way to disable that behavior. I wonder if you are hitting the same.

Well... not going so well.


If I run a small simulation with massif and the Release build of paraview, I don't see any growing memory in time. I also get my VTK files and images.


If I run the same simulation linked against a Debug build with VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS on, there is a segfault inside one of the libvtkRendering libraries (it says libvtkRenderingOp but the rest of the name is cut off). If I take the image rendering out of my pipeline (comment out the RegisterView call) and leave the VTK file writing, it runs fine and doesn't report any leaks. I tried to get the segfault to drop a core file, but it won't do it.


I'm thinking that there is an issue in the rendering part causing the leak. I have no idea what it could be though -- this is the 4.4.0 version, is anybody aware of any bug fixes between 4.4.0 and current versions that might be relevant?


Thanks for the help,


Tim

Thanks for the advice Burlen -- I haven't used Massif before, so this is a good opportunity to give it a try.


The initialize/finalize each time approach doesn't work either. I am calling the Finalize() routine on the vtkCPProcessor class but then when it tries to initialize again, it throws:


Warning: In /data4/ParaView/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketController.cxx, line 50
vtkSocketController (0xa4342f0): Already initialized.


and then crashes. So, hopefully I can sort out the memory leak rather than trying to debug why a hacked fix doesn't work!

VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS, although will catch some serious errors, will not catch all kinds of leaks. For example you can have leaks where data erroneously accumulates with each time step, but is deleted at program termination. VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS will not catch that kind of error. It's probably better to use massif to profile your code on a small one node run. There's an excellent tool called massif visualizer to aid in exploring the data generated.

Hi Andy,


Thanks for the tips. I will get working on the VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS now and see what it turns up.


The initialize/finalize every time is definitely a hack and not for long-term use. But, sponsors want a report on Monday and we need to be able to visualize things for that -- the simulation is too big to write data files and post-process later. So I modified the code to do that for now until I can find a proper fix.


I'll let you know if I get stuck with the log file.


Thanks again,


Tim

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Memory leak with Catalyst

Hi Tim,

If you build Catalyst with VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS enabled it is pretty good at finding VTK objects that aren't deleted properly. You should be able to run this with a small amount of calls to Catalyst as well. If you try this and want help understanding the output (if an object like a vtkUnstructuredGrid is leaked it will often give a whole bunch of false leaks that the unstructured grid is just holding the references to), just share your output file and I can take a look at it to try and narrow down the culprit. That may be slightly easier to use than Valgrind.

Beyond this, you could maybe try the same run but without doing any Catalyst work to see what happens then. That may be a lot of compute cycles but I'm not sure how else to try and bisect where the memory leak is occurring.

Initializing and finalizing Catalyst every time you want output would probably work but I'd think there may be significant overhead doing it like this. Plus, it's not really solving the problem -- just avoiding it.

Best,
Andy

Hi,


One of our users is running a very big simulation and writing out images of two slices (two different views) every 1000 iterations and writing out the data for the two slices (two different data writers) as VTK files every 5000 iterations. It is using Paraview 4.4.


After 21000 iterations, the simulation is killed because the memory on the compute nodes fills up. I usually know how to track down memory problems in our code using valgrind and related tools, but is that the right way to go to try and find this problem?


Are there any tips on how to isolate where the problem may be? I don't know if it is in the adapter, or in paraview itself. Has anybody encountered problems with runaway memory using Catalyst in 4.4 when writing images or VTK files?


I know when we use pvpython to generate images and loop over many files, sometimes the memory also blows up and so we usually move the loop over the files outside the pvpython script and into a driver script that executes a new pvpython for each file. Is there a way to shut down/start up Catalyst each time it needs to write something? Is that advisable?


Thanks,


Tim

Can you post an example? When I tried the same with a simple sphere
color by "Normals X", it seems to work as expected. I used
"view3dscene" to view the X3d file.

And same with categorical colors. I did notice, however, it fails when
coloring with "Field Data" arrays. Is that what you're seeing? That
I'd expected would fail in VTK too. That's indeed a missing feature in
the exporter.

Ah okay. Looks like there's another bug with cell-data coloring and
x3d. I've spotted the bug (I think) and am working on a fix. Not sure
how this could have worked in VTK example, however. I'll send you a
patch shortly.

Sure, I would share the code. But as I said, I haven't done anything more
than wrapping pqCatalystConnectReaction::connect() and hacking several
lines in the python rpc server, which are probably not done right.
If it helps, I can try to reconstruct all the lines I have modified and
clean up the stuff. However, you'll probably find a cleaner solution to
invoke pqCatalystConnectReaction::connect() from the web client.

Hi Sven,

What you did is what I was planning to do. Maybe cleaner, but that's it. So
the end integration could be slightly different, but the core will be the
same.

On a side note, we will never call a "Qt" code from Python. As we are note
expecting the GUI to be build for ParaViewWeb.

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] How to Annotate time steps when using VTK files ?
Message-ID: <32D0A6E400786141A9A2CB170C1CF1EC01DD4723F2@NL0230MBX07N1.DIR.slb.com>

Hello ParaView !

I would like to annotate the actual Time using a series of .vtk files,
However it appears that with .vtk files ParaView is creating the time from the time step number, not from the T####.vtk part of the filename.
I also included  a "TIME" array with one entry as shown in the snapshot below, because Visit uses this data to track the time, but this is not recognized by Paraview.

What can I do to annotate the time based on the filename string suffix T####.vtk, in this case time would be for me in milliseconds,
or to use the data TIME in each time step as shown below  (time in seconds)

Thanks in advance.
Carlos

Try using the "Annotate Global Data" filter instead. You can then choose to
use the value from the field data array TIME.

I think there is an api in the multi-block writer to disable writing 
metadata. Utkarsh knows, he's the one that figured it out. not sure how 
it applies to your use case. you may not even be using multi-block format...

I am using the multiblock format, so I am definitely interested in the solution. Hopefully Utkarsh sees this and can chime in.


Thanks!

I think there is an api in the multi-block writer to disable writing metadata. Utkarsh knows, he's the one that figured it out. not sure how it applies to your use case. you may not even be using multi-block format...

btw, we just had similar problem that was entirely explained by vtk writer attempting to gather a bunch of arrays to the root node. Utkarsh found a way to disable that behavior. I wonder if you are hitting the same.

Well... not going so well.


If I run a small simulation with massif and the Release build of paraview, I don't see any growing memory in time. I also get my VTK files and images.


If I run the same simulation linked against a Debug build with VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS on, there is a segfault inside one of the libvtkRendering libraries (it says libvtkRenderingOp but the rest of the name is cut off). If I take the image rendering out of my pipeline (comment out the RegisterView call) and leave the VTK file writing, it runs fine and doesn't report any leaks. I tried to get the segfault to drop a core file, but it won't do it.


I'm thinking that there is an issue in the rendering part causing the leak. I have no idea what it could be though -- this is the 4.4.0 version, is anybody aware of any bug fixes between 4.4.0 and current versions that might be relevant?


Thanks for the help,


Tim

Thanks for the advice Burlen -- I haven't used Massif before, so this is a good opportunity to give it a try.


The initialize/finalize each time approach doesn't work either. I am calling the Finalize() routine on the vtkCPProcessor class but then when it tries to initialize again, it throws:


Warning: In /data4/ParaView/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketController.cxx, line 50
vtkSocketController (0xa4342f0): Already initialized.


and then crashes. So, hopefully I can sort out the memory leak rather than trying to debug why a hacked fix doesn't work!

VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS, although will catch some serious errors, will not catch all kinds of leaks. For example you can have leaks where data erroneously accumulates with each time step, but is deleted at program termination. VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS will not catch that kind of error. It's probably better to use massif to profile your code on a small one node run. There's an excellent tool called massif visualizer to aid in exploring the data generated.

Hi Andy,


Thanks for the tips. I will get working on the VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS now and see what it turns up.


The initialize/finalize every time is definitely a hack and not for long-term use. But, sponsors want a report on Monday and we need to be able to visualize things for that -- the simulation is too big to write data files and post-process later. So I modified the code to do that for now until I can find a proper fix.


I'll let you know if I get stuck with the log file.


Thanks again,


Tim

Hi Tim,

If you build Catalyst with VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS enabled it is pretty good at finding VTK objects that aren't deleted properly. You should be able to run this with a small amount of calls to Catalyst as well. If you try this and want help understanding the output (if an object like a vtkUnstructuredGrid is leaked it will often give a whole bunch of false leaks that the unstructured grid is just holding the references to), just share your output file and I can take a look at it to try and narrow down the culprit. That may be slightly easier to use than Valgrind.

Beyond this, you could maybe try the same run but without doing any Catalyst work to see what happens then. That may be a lot of compute cycles but I'm not sure how else to try and bisect where the memory leak is occurring.

Initializing and finalizing Catalyst every time you want output would probably work but I'd think there may be significant overhead doing it like this. Plus, it's not really solving the problem -- just avoiding it.

Best,
Andy

Are there any tips on how to isolate where the problem may be? I don't know if it is in the adapter, or in paraview itself. Has anybody encountered problems with runaway memory using Catalyst in 4.4 when writing images or VTK files?


I know when we use pvpython to generate images and loop over many files, sometimes the memory also blows up and so we usually move the loop over the files outside the pvpython script and into a driver script that executes a new pvpython for each file. Is there a way to shut down/start up Catalyst each time it needs to write something? Is that advisable?

Try using the "Annotate Global Data" filter instead. You can then choose to use the value from the field data array TIME.

Hello ParaView !

I would like to annotate the actual Time using a series of .vtk files,
However it appears that with .vtk files ParaView is creating the time from the time step number, not from the T####.vtk part of the filename.
I also included  a ?TIME? array with one entry as shown in the snapshot below, because Visit uses this data to track the time, but this is not recognized by Paraview.

What can I do to annotate the time based on the filename string suffix T####.vtk, in this case time would be for me in milliseconds,
or to use the data TIME in each time step as shown below  (time in seconds)

Thanks in advance.

Hi all,


I'm using a xdmf input file to visualize my data output from a
simulation. Before, the output format was vtk. I could easily do contour
plots using
CellDataToPointData and than apply the Contour button.
However with the xdmf format this is no longer possible.
There is no error but it just does not display anything.

I came across this
https://cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2015-December/035852.html
where another user run into this problem, but it seems that there was no
answer on this.

I was wondering if there is already a solution or if someone can help me
with this?
Thank you already in advance!

Stephanie

Many, many thanks Utkarsh for that quick fix!
Yes, You are right, my VTK test was using point data, so the problem didn't appear.
Thanks again for the great support.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter - script for mean of two input
	PointSources
In-Reply-To: <CY1PR03MB213801685E6D927BF70DB1349D4F0@CY1PR03MB2138.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Message-ID: <CADHSJjBwu1igu6gU+RJ2jiuPSuNOgEC1OMnC004ek7ZxKRXUxA@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a simple trick:

1. Select both point sources in pipeline browser and then create the
"Python Calculator".
2. Use the expression "(inputs[0].Points + inputs[1].Points)/2.0", and
hit "Apply"
3. Next, create the "Calculator" filter connect to the "Python
Calculator" with expression "result" and also check the "Coordinate
Results" checkbox. Hit "Apply".

That should do it.

Example state file attached.

Stephanie,

Is it possible to share the full dataset to reproduce this issue? That
will make things easier.

Thanks,

Stephanie,

This is indeed weird, looks like I can apply the Contour filter but it
doesn't produce any output. Did you say you were writing out VTK files
before and it used to work then? Can you also share the VTK file that
was working?

Thanks
Utkarsh

Guys,

The multiblock writer issue is unrelated -- as far as I can tell. Esp
since "If I take the image rendering out of my pipeline (comment out
the RegisterView call) and leave the VTK file writing, it runs fine
and doesn't report any leaks.".


Here's the MR if you're interested in checking it out in any case:

Stephanie,

The issue seems to be the fact that in the XDMF file you have a whole
lot of duplicated points. Here's my pipeline:

   fault.xmdf -> Clean To Grid -> Cell Data To Point Data

Now I can contour as expected. Clean To Grid will merge duplicate points.

Hi, 

What is the best way to proceed if someone wants to use the new coordinate (mean of the two dots) in another filter using a Link. For instance, I would like to use the coordinate as the Origin of a Clip filter. 

Thank you,

Objet?: Re: [Paraview] Programmable filter - script for mean of two input PointSources

Here's a simple trick:

1. Select both point sources in pipeline browser and then create the "Python Calculator".
2. Use the expression "(inputs[0].Points + inputs[1].Points)/2.0", and hit "Apply"
3. Next, create the "Calculator" filter connect to the "Python Calculator" with expression "result" and also check the "Coordinate Results" checkbox. Hit "Apply".

That should do it.

Example state file attached.

Michele,

I took a look at the data you sent me. I experienced many of the issues you brought up.

After taking a closer look at the data, I realized that many of the cells in your data are of the general polyhedral type. Unlike the standard cell shapes like tetrahedron and hexahedron, polyhedral shapes are general polyhedra formed by specifying the face polygons. They allow you to specify any flat faceted shape, but computing basic operations on them such as interpolations, derivatives, and location finding is very expensive. This is why operations like streamlines are going so slowly.

If the cells are represented as standard shapes, things go much faster. For example, if you tetrahedralize the data, streamlines takes well under 10 seconds. That gets the operations to about the range where your nameless commercial product is running. I suspect, but cannot verify, that this other visualization package is probably downgrading the cells to something like hexahedra, which makes it run faster.

I don?t recommend running the tetrahedralization filter all the time on your data. It is also slow and really bloats the data. If you could write out an alternate form of the data that wrote hexahedra instead of polyhedra, I suspect things would run much faster. You would probably have a problem with faces not being aligned, though.

One final note, although the clip filter is taking a long time, I found the slice filter to be much faster. Generally, when dealing with large data, you should favor slice over clip. It?s much faster, uses much less memory, and usually gives you the same information.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 5.0.1 client-server crashing for some datasets
Message-ID: <CAHM0Tbxr0JxDETtDGa56-L-N=qKw=gmVjFxCxOA_rE6t9duwdw@mail.gmail.com>

I have recently built and installed ParaView 5.0.1 on one of our clusters
and am having issues when loading most datasets that I have tried.

1. remote rendering seems to work with no issues:  I can make spheres and
cylinders and move them around and color their sections according the core
doing the processing
2. the ParaView tutorial dataset (from
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) named headsq.vti can
load and render remotely with no problems
3. loading either of the other two tutorial datasets (can.ex2 or
disk_out_ref.ex2) causes the application to crash
4. The remote client machine (running ParaView5.0.1) can open all of these
datasets with no problem

Crash details:
a. data set variables show up correctly in the Properties pane, but
Information seems unavailable: all the fields under statistics and data
arrays have values "NA", but time indices look correct
b. clicking "Apply" causes the client application on the remote machine and
pvserver on the cluster to die
c. client-side standard output:
####################-begin-####################

Matt,

Can you confirm that both the client and server are using the same
rendering backend? Unfortunately, there's no clean way to do that
except to look at the CMakeCache.txt used to build to two. Confirm
that the VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND CMake flag is set to the same value on
both. I suspect one is "OpenGL" and other is "OpenGL2".

Thank you for the quick reply.

On the client, I used a superbuild for MacOS X which I take it is built
with OpenGL2.  On the cluster, I accepted the default flag which (upon
rerunning ccmake) appears to be OpenGL on this system.

So, the client and server are almost certainly built to use different
rendering backends.  I take it that they must be the same for full
functionality, is that correct?  What functionality would you expect to
fail if rendering backends are mismatched between the client and server?

Hi Sven - I'm very interested in how you got catalyst to work with
paraviewweb.  Can you post your code somewhere (or send me a tar file or
something)? I would very much appreciate that. Thanks very much! -- Adam

I rebuilt the cluster's installation of Paraview 5.0.1 making sure to set
VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL2 since this will be most compatible with the
superbuild binaries.  The datasets I originally could not load now seem to
load and render correctly.  I will have more users test the installation
and report back here if I hear of any problems.

Thanks again,

Matt

Hi Utkarsh

Our use-case scenario is that we have our own filter based on vtkCpCutter (both vtkPolyData on the input and output port) . We use this filter to generate a set of slices on surface geometry. We then process the obtained contours with vtkPlotEdges. For each contour (slice) we would like to compute a scalar value, say max distance between two points in the contour and output the values to the scalar list widget. Of course we also would like to modify the distances and send it back to the filters. These values will be used to update the output of the filter.

Andrzej

There are several ways of skinning this cat. Can you elaborate of what exactly is your use-case? Do you want the default values for this double-vector-property (DVP) set using some values provided by the VTK filter, but allow user to override using UI?

Subject: [Paraview] texture dropdown disabled,
	can't set texture on polygonal mesh
Message-ID: <CAJAZx5BNN8=xDGCo38OVDWATQzyUDtmoKcQ8mbeEXPpFkxFZBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to put a texture (png file) onto the surface of a polygonal
mesh.

I go to the properties tab, enabled Advanced, go to Miscellaneous...

Right after "pickable" is the texture dropdown. But it is disabled. I can't
figure out how to load my texture. See attached screenshot.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Check the Information tab for a "Texture Coordinates" point aligned array.
If not present it would explain why you can't apply a Texture.
In that case, try the "Texture to Sphere" filter to generate some.

Andrzej,

Just to make sure I understand:

vtkCpCutter calculates slices aka contours on surface and also outputs
an array of  "max-distance"s. You want the user to be able to see
these values on the panel for this filter and then change them which
in turn affects some execution logic in vtkCpCutter. Is that correct?

Yes, this is what I want Utkarsh. 

The filter does not necessary has to output the distances on the output port (which I presumably would do by assigning a field array to the output geometry)  but I definitely would like them to display and modify in the panel widget to affect the execution logic of the filter.

It works fine but I would like to have the ability to select the required variable from a drop list.
If I do it the modified xml causes Paraview to crash or the variable(Pressure) is not send to the python script. Do you know what I am getting wrong.
Please find attached the xml filter I am using

Thank you
Kind regards

Subject: [Paraview] 5.0.1/Exodus Reader
Message-ID: <D36E056D.2B768%Richard.C.Angelini.CIV@mail.mil>

We?re seeing an issue with the Exodus reader in version 5.0.1.      We can read any particular Exodus dataset when running ParaView 5.0.1 locally ? read the data on the same machine where the client is running.   However, when we try to load any of the Exodus datasets in client-server mode,   ParaView 5.0.1 immediately crashes.    Crash happens when the client is run on either a Mac or Linux workstation.

This same dataset works in client-server mode using ParaView 4.3.1.
We seem to be able to load up other data types using ParaView 5.0.1 ? so far, it *appears* that only Exodus files are failing.

Rick,

I must admit this was a major "oops" in 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 releases. We
should have handled this better and I will make sure we do for 5.1.
Basically, what you have is a mismatch in rendering configurations for
client and server. One of them is build with VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND set
to OpenGL and other to OpenGL2. You need them to match.

The binaries distributed by paraview.org are indeed OpenGL2. The title
bar for ParaView 5.0.1 says "(Legacy Rendering Backend)" when using
"OpenGL". Given the error, I think your server is not built with
OpenGL2, despite your intention. Can you check your CMakeCache.txt on
the server build to confirm?

Yep - we built the HPC-side with ?OpenGL2? ? so does that mean that the
pre-built Mac/Linux binaries were both built with OpenGL?    Is there some
way to check to see which OpenGL the client was built with?

didn?t go as intended.

Dear catalyst users,
I am sorry I cannot document the detailed steps how to set up the catalyst
to paraviewweb connection, bescause I am only experimenting how to get it
right at the moment. I have received several emails asking for guidance,
but I would like to ask you to pose your questions on this mailing list so
that others may contribute who have more experience.
Again, the essential step is happening in
pqCatalystConnectReaction::connect(). You don't need any Qt calls, but if
you follow that method, you find that a vtkSMLiveInsituManager is created,
which can be used for the further client-server communication. I could
receive a rendered image from catalyst in the web client, but a real "live"
connection is not yet working. I cannot answer questions like "How did you
do it", because my setup is a big mess, and I would have to go through all
steps again if I wanted to document this mess. If you describe instead what
you did and what doesn't work, we may be able to find a solution together.

If you study the contents of pv_web_catalyst.py and
Web/Javascript/Widgets/CatalystBrower it seems like all this has already
been solved one year ago.

Regards
Sven

vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, but with this declaration, you are saying
the member function takes 5 arguments. The crash occurs with an error
message saying

ERROR: In /Users/cory.quammen/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkPVSessionCore.cxx,
line 390
vtkPVSessionCore (0x7fd583c415d0): Object type:
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, could not find requested method:
"SetParameter"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
while processing

Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = vtk_object_pointer {vtkPythonProgrammableFilter (0x7fd58b623310)}
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetParameter}
  Argument 2 = string_value {Pressure}
  Argument 3 = int32_value {0}
  Argument 4 = int32_value {0}
  Argument 5 = int32_value {0}
  Argument 6 = int32_value {0}
  Argument 7 = string_value {}

Try this XML to replace the problematic XML

The problem is in this section:

<StringVectorProperty
    name="Pressure"
    command="SetParameter"
    initial_string="Pressure"
    number_of_elements="1"
    animateable="1"

            <Property name="Input"
                      function="Input" />
          </RequiredProperties>
                  </ArrayListDomain>

This works in local tests for me.

Subject: [Paraview] basics of paraview client server programming
Message-ID: <CAAUk9C4i5x3UF0bYC0FUVpJtR6LUrrS00qnN_dJi2CXFOJo_mg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview programmers,
I am looking for some information about the basic principles of Paraviews
client-server model, the setup of client proxies and the communication
design.

I think that I have seen a chapter with a short introduction on these
topics some years ago. It was in one of the VTK books or in the Paraview
User's Guide. Now I cannot find this chapter again. Has it been removed in
the latest edition of these books? Or is it described in a different book
which I don't remember?

Peter

Subject: [Paraview] Save State/adding custom property
Message-ID: <BLU180-W628B6367E1B9193BE06014AD440@phx.gbl>

Hi everyone,
I am trying to add a custom property to the state xml. 
For eg: 
I loaded object.stl and did a slice on it. Then, I saved the state and went to look at the XML. 
<ProxyCollection name="sources">      <Item id="4031" name="Slice1"/>      <Item id="3783" name="object.stl"/> </ProxyCollection>
I want to add an extra property called "user" 
<ProxyCollection name="sources">      <Item id="4031" name="Slice1" user="dev"/>      <Item id="3783" name="object.stl" user="basic"/> </ProxyCollection>
the extra property will be added during the saving of the state. I will be changing user property using a widget. I just want to know how to send the value of my variable user to be printed in the xml. 
I have been looking at a couple of classes  vtkSMStateVersionController, vtkSMStateLoader, vtkSMProperty. I got confused after looking at so many classes related to this.  Do i need to register my variable or send it using a specific function?Is there some documentation/tutorial for this?
thanks 
Michal Wozniak

Hi Sven,

Thanks for your feedback. I'm even surprised to see my name on that Python
file. I definitely forget about it and I'm not even sure to know what it is
doing, but it is probably a good start.

Regrading your comment on ./VTK/Web/Javascript/Widgets/CatalystBrower/*, it
is not meant to be used for that purpose.
It was written to build some visualization tools of data generated via
Catalyst. (https://datascience.lanl.gov/data/papers/SC14.pdf)

If you want to see some progress on that web code you can look at
http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/ and
http://kitware.github.io/arctic-viewer/ for concrete application.

There's a preexisting feature called "annotation" that vtkSMProxy
supports via the following API. Seems to me that'd map well to what
you're trying to do with the "user" property.

void SetAnnotation (const char *key, const char *value)
const char * GetAnnotation (const char *key)
void RemoveAnnotation (const char *key)
void RemoveAllAnnotations ()
bool HasAnnotation (const char *key)
int GetNumberOfAnnotations ()
const char * GetAnnotationKeyAt (int index)

Just a quick note that Your fix went into VTK after the newest VTK was synched 
into PV, so I had to do a pull in the VTK subdirectory of PV to get it.
Works like a charm now and together with X3dToX3dom.xslt yields a zoom-able HTML:

Utkarsh - thanks for info.    Recompiling the server-side with OpenGL2
resolved the problem!

The binaries distributed by paraview.org are indeed OpenGL2. The title
bar for ParaView 5.0.1 says "(Legacy Rendering Backend)" when using
"OpenGL". Given the error, I think your server is not built with
OpenGL2, despite your intention. Can you check your CMakeCache.txt on
the server build to confirm?

Andrzej,

Here's a possible approach:

Add a "information_only" property to the proxy to retrieve the values
for  max_distance computed by the filter. You can create a custom
SIProperty [1] subclass to support arbitrary API to get the values
from your filter and communicate that to the SMProperty. Your widget
that can explicitly monitor this property to update view of "current
values" as appropriate.

What I am not sure if whether the information_property will get
updates every time the filter re-executes, e.g. when time changes. If
it doesn't, we may have to explicitly monitor the
vtkCommand::UpdateDataEvent fired by the proxy and call
vtkSMProxy::UpdatePropertyInformation() explicitly.

For each contour (slice) we would like to compute a scalar value, say max distance between two points in the contour and output the values to the scalar list widget. Of course we also would like to modify the distances and send it back to the filters. These values will be used to update the output of the filter.

Alan,

I am not sure I follow, but attached is a script that fetches "global
arrays" to the client side so you can do whatever you want with it. Is
that what you're looking for?

Call for Participation: ISAV 2016
=========================

ISAV2016: In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis
and Visualization

In cooperation with SIGHPC and held in conjunction with SC16: The
International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking,
Storage and Analysis, Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.

Full-day Sunday November 13th, 2016

ISAV 2016 Web Site: http://vis.lbl.gov/Events/ISAV-2016/

Workshop Theme
------------------------

The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ
analysis and visualization is  due to several factors. First is an I/O
cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while  being
generated, without first storing to a file system. Second is the
potential for increased  accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of
transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse
temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available
resources, CPU?s and accelerators, in the computation of analysis
products.

The workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners
from industry, academia, and government laboratories developing,
applying, and deploying in situ methods in extreme-scale, high
performance computing. The goal is to present research findings,
lessons learned, and insights related to developing and applying in
situ methods and infrastructure across a range of science and
engineering applications in HPC environments; to discuss topics like
opportunities presented by new architectures, existing infrastructure
needs, requirements, and gaps, and experiences to foster and enable in
situ analysis and visualization; to serve as a ?center of gravity? for
researchers, practitioners, and users/consumers of in situ methods and
infrastructure in the HPC space.

Participation/Call for Papers and Oral Presentations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We invite two types of submissions to ISAV 2016: (1) short, 4-page
papers that present research results, that identify opportunities or
challenges, and that present case studies/best practices for in situ
methods/infrastructure in the areas of data management, analysis and
visualization; (2) lightning presentation submission, consisting of a
1- or 2-page submission, for a brief oral presentation at the
workshop. Short papers will appear in the workshop proceedings and
will be invited to give an oral presentation of 15 to 20 minutes;
lightning round submissions that are invited to present at the
workshop will have author names and titles included as part of the
proceedings. Submissions of both types are welcome that fall within
one or more areas of interest, as follows:

Areas of interest for ISAV, include, but are not limited to:

In situ infrastructures
        * Current Systems: production quality, research prototypes
        * Opportunities
        * Gaps

System resources, hardware, and emerging architectures
        * Enabling Hardware
        * Hardware and architectures that provide opportunities for In situ
          processing, such as burst buffers, staging computations on I/O nodes,
          sharing cores within a node for both simulation and in situ processing

Methods/algorithms/applications/Case studies
        * Best practices
        * Analysis: feature detection, statistical methods, temporal methods,
          geometric methods
        * Visualization: information visualization, scientific
visualization, time-
          varying methods
        * Data reduction/compression
        * Examples/case studies of solving a specific science
challenge with in situ
          methods/infrastructure.

Simulation
        * Integration:data modeling, software-engineering
        * Resilience: error detection, fault recovery
        * Workflows for supporting complex in situ processing pipelines

Requirements
        * Preserve important elements
        * Significantly reduce the data size
        * Flexibility for post-processing exploration

Review Process
----------------------

All submissions will undergo a peer-review process consisting of three
reviews by experts in the field, and evaluated according to relevance
to the workshop theme, technical soundness, creativity, originality,
and impactfulness of method/results. Lightning round submissions will
be evaluated primarily for relevance to the workshop.

Submission Process
----------------------------

Authors are invited to submit papers of at most 4 pages in PDF format,
excluding references, and lightning presentations of at most 2 pages
in PDF format, excluding references. Papers should be formatted in the
ACM Proceedings Style (templates available at
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) and submitted
via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isav2016). No
changes to the margins, spacing, or font sizes as specified by the
style file are allowed.

Papers must be self-contained and provide the technical substance
required for the program committee to evaluate their contributions.
Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is
not under consideration for another conference or a journal. See the
ACM Prior Publication Policy for more details. Papers can be submitted
at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isav2016.

Publication in proceedings, presentation at the workshop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All paper submissions that receive favorable reviews will be included
as part of the workshop proceedings, which will be published through
SIGHPC along with other SC16 workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital
Library and IEEE Xplore. Lightning round submissions will not be
included as part of the proceedings.

Subject to the constraints of workshop length, some subset of the
accepted publications will be invited to give a brief oral
presentation at the workshop. The exact number of such presentations
and their length will be determined after the review process has been
completed.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 5.0.1 on an older Mac
Message-ID: <D373674D.2B87C%Richard.C.Angelini.CIV@mail.mil>

I have the following message from one of my local ParaView users:

Following is the message I am getting with the Paraview 5 client on the Mac. It appears to work in spite of this warning.

Warning: In /Users/kitware/buildbot-slave/paraview-bigmac-osx-shared-release_opengl2_osx10_7_qt4_superbuild/build/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper.cxx, line 2856
vtkCompositeMapperHelper (0x7fbc4b0e7800): VTK is working around a bug in Apple-AMD hardware related to gl_PrimitiveID.  This may cause significant memory and performance impacts. Your hardware has been identified as vendor ATI Technologies Inc. with renderer of ATI Radeon HD 5770 OpenGL Engine and version 4.1 ATI-1.24.39

About this Mac has the following information about my system:
Graphics  ATI Radeon HD 5770 1024 MB


The user does not see this error running ParaView 4.x.x ? so ? presumably this warning message is related to OpenGL2 running on an older graphics card???    Is this something we should be worried about in the short-term?  I?m not sure how much longer this older Mac will be in service ? but will we run in to issues with OpenGL2 which will preclude it from working on these older systems?

Richard,
    You will get this warning/error message on any OS X machine using 
ATI/AMD graphics hardware running OS X 10.10 or earlier. OS X 10.11 
corrected an OpenGL driver issue that this error is reporting. It is 
down in the VTK stack. I do not know if we should be worried or not 
about the warning/error.

Rick,

There is a test in VTK - vtkRenderingOpenGL2Cxx-TestAppleBug - that
will fail if the ATI bug workaround is used but not needed. If you
have VTK built with testing on on the old Mac system and this test
fails, we would know the bug workaround is not needed for this system
and we could suppress this warning in the VTK version that goes into
ParaView 5.1.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Visualizing load paths
Message-ID: <1462274379341.43274@rwth-aachen.de>

Dear people,

I am currently trying to find a way to visualize load paths with results from static finite element analysis within solid structures. For this FE-analysis I use Altairs software suite (Hypermesh/Optistruct/Hyperview).

>From reading several different publications I know that there is an easy way to visualize the load path with the attached file with the use of TecPlot.
I received the attached file from Herbert Moldenhauer who relys on D.W. Kellys methods for visulaizing the load path within structures.

It would really help a lot to get more information about the background of the stream tracer filters, because I am currently struggeling to format the input properly. As far as I know I need a field of vectors ("The dataset must contain a field array with 3 Components. An Array of vectors (point-centered) is required"), but with the attached file for example I am not able to use the stream tracer filter.

Your help would be greatly appreciated!!!
Thank you very much in advance!

Asaad

Subject: [Paraview] Error opening specific STL-files on specific computer
 ("unable to read point")
Message-ID: <DUB126-W836C7C7500CBA3C22FFF1CDD4F0@phx.gbl>

Hi everyone,

I've been using Paraview for a couple of years now and it's been great. However, I've now encountered a weird problem that I cannot solve. A couple of years ago, I used VTK (and Python) to automatically segment the skin layer surface out of MRI scans. I've always been able to view the resulting surface meshes in Paraview and other 3D visualization programs such as Meshlab. 

I would now like to work with this dataset again, but I cannot get the surfaces -which are stored as STL-files- to open on my computer. When I try to open them in Paraview (I've tried both 4.1.0 and 5.0.1), I get the following error:


ERROR: In /home/kitware/dashboards/buildbot/paraview-debian6dash-linux-shared-release_opengl2_qt4_superbuild/build/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/Geometry/vtkSTLReader.cxx, line 461

ERROR: In /home/kitware/dashboards/buildbot/paraview-debian6dash-linux-shared-release_opengl2_qt4_superbuild/build/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkExecutive.cxx, line 784

  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA
  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0
  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1
  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0


When I try to open them in Meshlab, I get an error message about "Premature End of file". Other STL-files, however, do open. I'm working on Ubuntu 15.10 64-bit. At first I assumed that the STL-files had somehow all gotten corrupted, but they open perfectly on a colleague's computer (Paraview 5.0.0 running on OpenSuse) and on my Windows 8.1 laptop (both in Paraview 5.0.0 and in Meshlab 1.3.3).

I'm not sure what's wrong. Could anybody please offer some insight? 

I've attached an example file to this e-mail.

Kind regards,

Daniel

Thanks for the tip David!

I used the "Texture Map To Sphere" filter, which kind of worked. However,
the texture mapping is not happening correctly, as you can see from the
attached screenshot. The image is mangled.

Here is the image I am using:
http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/57000/57730/land_ocean_ice_2048.png

I also tried one with the coordinates shifted, as in this tutorial (
http://www.earthmodels.org/data-and-tools/topography/paraview-topography-by-texture-mapping),
but it didn't make a difference, still mangled.
http://www.earthmodels.org/data-and-tools/topography/texture_land_ocean_ice_8192.png

Do you have any suggestions on how to overcome this?

Thanks,
Ryan

To clarify, the problem is that the image is being "doubled", i.e. wrapped
twice around the sphere in a mirrored fashion.

This happens even if I resize the image to be 1x1 aspect ratio.

Hello,
As stated in my previous e-mail, building ninja from vs2013did not solve
the problem. I also noticed that re-sending the ninja command after the
"subcommand failed" kind of resume the process to some point. I've attached
the corresponding log files.

Is it possible to build it with Visual Studio IDE instead of Ninja?
