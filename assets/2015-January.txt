Cory,

disk_out_ref.exo  and disk_out_ref.ex2 are one and the same, I think. I am
not aware of a different disk_out_ref.exo

Hello Utkarsh,

thank you for the information! I have been searching online for tutorials on how I can load and display .vtk-files in Paraview and realized that I can save a state as a Python script. This script provides me with all the information necessary to load the .vtk-files, change their mesh color and the view angle (I can run the script using pvbatch test.py). However, I could not figure out how I can take a screenshot from that stage and save the .png-file. The python script test.py looks like this:


# state file generated using paraview version 4.2.0

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# setup views used in the visualization
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

#### import the simple module from the paraview
from paraview.simple import *
#### disable automatic camera reset on 'Show'
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

# Create a new 'Render View'
renderView1 = CreateView('RenderView')
renderView1.ViewSize = [1613, 837]
renderView1.CenterOfRotation = [91.7317943572998, 165.96746826171875, 209.01107025146484]
renderView1.CameraPosition = [91.7317943572998, -19.57611529481801, 209.01107025146484]
renderView1.CameraFocalPoint = [91.7317943572998, 165.96746826171875, 209.01107025146484]
renderView1.CameraViewUp = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
renderView1.CameraParallelScale = 48.022213121002615
renderView1.Background = [0.32, 0.34, 0.43]

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# setup the data processing pipelines
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# create a new 'Legacy VTK Reader'
outputEndoSurfRegistrationvtk = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=['/home/.../outputEndoSurfRegistrationvtk.vtk'])

# create a new 'Legacy VTK Reader'
atlasEndoSurfRegistrationvtk = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=['/home/.../atlasEndoSurfRegistration.vtk'])

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# setup the visualization in view 'renderView1'
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# show data from atlasEndoSurfRegistrationvtk
atlasEndoSurfRegistrationvtkDisplay = Show(atlasEndoSurfRegistrationvtk, renderView1)
# trace defaults for the display properties.
atlasEndoSurfRegistrationvtkDisplay.ColorArrayName = [None, '']
atlasEndoSurfRegistrationvtkDisplay.DiffuseColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.4980392156862745]

# show data from outputEndoSurfRegistrationvtk
outputEndoSurfRegistrationvtkDisplay = Show(outputEndoSurfRegistrationvtk, renderView1)
# trace defaults for the display properties.
outputEndoSurfRegistrationvtkDisplay.ColorArrayName = ['POINTS', '']
outputEndoSurfRegistrationvtkDisplay.DiffuseColor = [0.0, 0.3333333333333333, 0.0]                                                                       

I guess that it will be only a simple command added at the end of the script which does the trick and would appreciate any help on that, thanks! Finally, happy new year to everyone! :-)

Best, Thomas

You can indeed run a python script from terminal to automate such a
task. Use pvpython or pvbatch executables. Those are simply Python
interpreters with ParaView initialization stub. You can pass in a
script as command line argument and the application will quit once the
script is done.

Message-ID: <CAGqzA5X__peAedMH9LNC0ScDszhutvCE0zLitscKKZ5uJZtUJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

   I found a possible bug of the paraview's transform filter. If I put just
the uniform scaling, e.g. set the scale to 10 10 10. Some of the
vector-type data arrays get scaled by 10 but not all. Why is that?

Thanks,
Mengda

Dear Utkarsh,


Needing the same thing as Willi, I've created a paraview plugin written in C++ 
doing basically the same as Your script. Would it be possible to achieve 
something like vtkFollower does from within a c++ PV plugin such that the text 
always faces the camera? An other idea would be to use Python in the animation 
view to rotate the text as the camera orbits. This would be a workaround only 
for animations, which would suffice for me. Do You thing that should be possible 
if nothing else works?

Many thanks for looking into this.
Roman

Hi Alan,

I was able to reproduce your problem. I'm not sure why the
programmable filter approach fails, though.

As an alternative, use the attached Poly Data Distance XML plugin
(it's better, anyway, since you don't have to enter the script each
time you use it). Try the following:

- launch ParaView
- Tools -> Manage Plugins... -> Load New...
- Change file type to .xml and select the attached XML plugin file
- open disk_out_ref.exo
- Merge blocks
- Extract surface
- Transform, shifting 20 units in X
- Use PolyData distance plugin

You should have the distance computed on each version of disk_out_ref.exo.

Please let me know how it goes.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Roman,

A representation plugin could probably do this. It would just need to
set its internal actor to an instance of vtkFollower and set the
camera from the view's renderer, which could be set by overriding the
AddToView(vtkView* view) method in your custom representation.

I hope that helps,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel XML VTK with arbitrary polyhedra
Message-ID: <D0D052EC.B32%vlc@illinois.edu>

Hi there,

I?m attempting to write a parallel XML file to source unstructured data to read in Paraview (written from an in-house fortran CFD code). Everything works out of the box when I use zoo elements (hexahedra, tetrahedra, ?), not so when using arbitrary polyhedra.

I?m attaching a sample test (a sphere discretized on a 16x16x16 lattice, see sphere1.png). The .vtu files I dump seem to be valid, for the external boundaries are displayed accurately when visualizing them separately (see attached sphere2.png to see the partitioning).

When loading the .pvtu file, however, the external boundary considers only the zoo elements (hex only, in this case), not the polyhedral cells. Paraview also crashes whenever I apply a filter, which suggests I?m doing something wrong.

I?m most likely missing something in the .pvtu file? I tried a few things, e.g. adding a <PCells/> element where with <PDataArray/>?s referencing the faces and faceoffsets arrays specific to polyhedral cells, but no success so far? Any input is much welcome at this point!

Thanks,
Vincent

PS: I?m using the 4.2.0 built of Paraview. The ASCII .vtu and .pvtu files I use are attached in a tarball.

Dear Cory,


Many thanks for Your suggestion, I wouldn't have thought of a representation 
plugin. I guess You mean the plugin type described here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_new_Representations_for_3D_View_using_Plugins_.2A_new_in_version_3.7
I'll give it a try.

Thanks again for the hint
Roman

What is the problem you see with the new cmake? cmake is tested on many
platforms so it should work on ubuntu 12.04 as well.

Do you do the config/build in the source directory? If yes, could you try
it in a separate build directory?

Hi,

I figured using a PVD file does the job, for example

<VTKFile type="Collection" version="1.0" byte_order="LittleEndian" header_type="UInt64">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet part="0" file="sphere_0.vtu"/>
    <DataSet part="1" file="sphere_1.vtu"/>
    <DataSet part="2" file="sphere_2.vtu"/>
    <DataSet part="3" file="sphere_3.vtu"/>
    <DataSet part="4" file="sphere_4.vtu"/>
    <DataSet part="5" file="sphere_5.vtu"/>
    <DataSet part="6" file="sphere_6.vtu"/>
    <DataSet part="7" file="sphere_7.vtu"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

I?m still interested in getting .pvtu files to work though, if anyone has an idea of how to get it to work with polyhedral cells?

Best,
Vincent

Subject: Parallel XML VTK with arbitrary polyhedra

Hi there,

I?m attempting to write a parallel XML file to source unstructured data to read in Paraview (written from an in-house fortran CFD code). Everything works out of the box when I use zoo elements (hexahedra, tetrahedra, ?), not so when using arbitrary polyhedra.

I?m attaching a sample test (a sphere discretized on a 16x16x16 lattice, see sphere1.png). The .vtu files I dump seem to be valid, for the external boundaries are displayed accurately when visualizing them separately (see attached sphere2.png to see the partitioning).

When loading the .pvtu file, however, the external boundary considers only the zoo elements (hex only, in this case), not the polyhedral cells. Paraview also crashes whenever I apply a filter, which suggests I?m doing something wrong.

I?m most likely missing something in the .pvtu file? I tried a few things, e.g. adding a <PCells/> element where with <PDataArray/>?s referencing the faces and faceoffsets arrays specific to polyhedral cells, but no success so far? Any input is much welcome at this point!

Thanks,
Vincent

PS: I?m using the 4.2.0 built of Paraview. The ASCII .vtu and .pvtu files I use are attached in a tarball.

Mengda,
I believe that the transform filter is just scaling the space ? i.e., the X, Y and Z data.  If you want to scale data arrays, use the Calculator filter.

Hi All,
   I found a possible bug of the paraview's transform filter. If I put just the uniform scaling, e.g. set the scale to 10 10 10. Some of the vector-type data arrays get scaled by 10 but not all. Why is that?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Gradient filters

The gradient filter works specifically on image-based data. (An AMR grid is essentially a hierarchy of image data.) It computes the gradient by taking differences in the x, y, and z directions of the grid. The unstructured gradient filter makes no such assumption about the directionality of the edges. Instead, it computes the gradients within the cells and averages the results. The intention is to get valid results on unstructured grids, but the implementation actually works on any dataset object. Thus, it will work on image-based data, but slower (and will probably give a slightly different answer).

I am guessing that the warning message you are getting is only supposed to be outputted once, but the filter is being independently executed on each block of the AMR and so gives the warning each time. Rather than fix this specific instance, it might be better to have a smarter output window that recognizes when a message is repeated and reports only once with an indicator of how many times it was raised. Now that I think about it, it would be nice if the output window also cleaned up all messages to hide some of the diagnostic information that comes with every message (like file location). That would make warnings/errors more helpful in general.

Message-ID: <D0D06128.1F4BD%kmorel@sandia.gov>

To add a bit more detail to the answer, the reason the transform filter is not scaling all the vectors is because the proper transformation of vectors depends on the type of vector so the filter is being conservative and not transforming most of the vectors at all. To understand this, let's back up and look at different types of vectors that might be in scientific data.

First, there are vectors that deal with spatial movements. Things like displacements, velocities, and accelerations. These have units like m, m/s, and m/s^2, respectively. They clearly should be scaled along with the space like you described.

But other types of vectors shouldn't be scaled. For example, consider electrical current. Current is the amount of electricity that passes through a point per unit of time, and a vector can give the direction of the movement. However, it is not clear that scaling up the model means that more electricity passes through the point. Other "vectors" might just be triples that have no spatial meaning and therefore should also not be scaled. Other spatial vectors have different types of transformations when being scaled. A normal vector, for instance, is transformed by the inverse transpose to maintain its perpendicular-to-surface property. A flux vector, which is related to surface area, would be scaled quadratically.

So the problem is that the transform filter has no way to reliably determine how each vector field should be scaled. VTK data sets have the ability to identify certain fields with special attributes. For example, one field can be attributed as the "vectors" and another can be attributed as the "normals". The transform filter assumes that the vectors are to be scaled linearly and the normals are transformed by the inverse transpose. The rest of the arrays are left alone.

So in summary, in a sense this is in fact a "bug" in that the fields are not being handled correctly. But the filter is doing about as best as it can, so there is no real fix for this bug.

Mengda,
I believe that the transform filter is just scaling the space - i.e., the X, Y and Z data.  If you want to scale data arrays, use the Calculator filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Transform filter bug? why some of the data arrays get scaled?

Hi All,
   I found a possible bug of the paraview's transform filter. If I put just the uniform scaling, e.g. set the scale to 10 10 10. Some of the vector-type data arrays get scaled by 10 but not all. Why is that?

Thanks,
Mengda

Dear Cory,


Following Your suggestion, I tried to modify my current plugin to include a new 
representation. However, I'm lost on how to combine the two things together. The 
example at the wiki and the one I found from Utkarsh 
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2011-July/022296.html) replace the 
Mapper and not the actor. So I'm not sure where to place the 
text-plydata-generation in that case. Can You help me to get going with this? My 
current attempt is attached.

Many thanks for Your help
Roman


PS: I tried to compile Utkarsh's example but it stops because the 
UpdateSuppressor seems to be gone:

/net/home/grothama/vtk/paraview_plugins/Representation/vtkMySpecialRepresentation.cxx:43:53: 
error: ?class vtkMySpecialRepresentation? has no member named ?UpdateSuppressor?

Would vtkMySpecialRepresentation need to be derived from vtkPVUpdateSuppressor?

Cory,

"New in ParaView: Coloring by field data
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/817 "

Thanks for this effort and explanation of how to use it! I am familiar 
with the ExodusII simulation results database and its 'field' variables.

In my multiple-material simulation models, total internal energy 
by-material is a field variable for each material block.

However, once I implemented in my software, the capability for writing 
an EnSight Gold simulation results file-set, my efforts to advance to 
the ExodusII format have all been for naught. My results simulation 
output routinely uses the EnSight-format 'Part' construct to create 
by-material blocks that the PV Extract Block filter nicely allows me to 
display any-and-all combinations of material Parts.

Is their any possibility of storing and accessing field data via 
ParaView's EnSight reader?

Message-ID: <f0413ee391d641659ef5016f63fde6c0@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I have a user that is trying to write a python script that reads in a dataset with a large number of files (say hundreds to thousands of files).  The dataset is Exodus.  This user wants to read in a large number of these datasets (dozens to hundreds), with each dataset comprised of a different number of individual files than the other datasets.  Thus, he doesn't want to read in files like this (example, only 8 files):

z_pinch1exo8 = ExodusIIReader(FileName=['z_pinch1.exo.8.0', 'z_pinch1.exo.8.1', z_pinch1.exo.8.2', 'z_pinch1.exo.8.3', 'z_pinch1.exo.8.4', 'z_pinch1.exo.8.5', 'z_pinch1.exo.8.6', 'z_pinch1.exo.8.7'])


But would rather like this:
z_pinch1exo8 = ExodusIIReader(FileName=['z_pinch1.exo.8.*'])
or
z_pinch1exo8 = ExodusIIReader(FileName=['z_pinch1.exo."totalFileCount".*'])


Is this possible in Python?  What is the format?

If the user wants to window into his data, say take the last 4 files, is this possible?

Thanks,

Alan

Roman,

I think there's a fundamental problem with the approach we've
discussed so far. vtkFollower won't work with the text glyph approach
you are proposing. The problem is that you need to rotate each of the
text glyphs independently to face the camera plane. If you generate a
set of 3D glyphs at each point, using a vtkFollower in the
representation will reorient the entire set of glyphs and not each
glyph independently. Does that make sense?

You might want to take a look at vtkDataLabelRepresentation in
ParaView. It draws cell ID and point ID labels oriented with the
camera plane.

Hope that helps,
Cory

I think this would not be a problem because I would append all labels to a 
single vtkPolyData and that would not be translated from the origin, so I'd 
think that a rotation applied by the vtkFollower to that object should do the 
trick. If I understand the general idea of representation plugins correctly, I 
could just choose this kind of camera-follower representation for the appended 
vtkVectorText object and the normal representations for other objects.
Let's assume for simplicity that I'd just want a 3D arrow to always point in the 
same direction no matter how I rotate the view direction. Would that be possible 
with this modified representation approach?

I had a look and found an example from Utkarsh here: 
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2012-May/024920.html
It works but has the same problem as the selection label tool: It draws the 
labels as 2D text such that labels of hidden points (when using an intransparent 
surface or volume representation) are still visible in front. For an orbiting 
cam animation we need, this effect is very irritating when viewed with many labels.
I also tried to modify vtkDataLabelRepresentation* to use:
   this->PointLabelMapper = vtkPolyDataMapper::New();
   this->PointLabelActor = vtkFollower::New();
   this->PointLabelProperty = vtkVectorText::New();
but it seems this needs many many changes in the code.

Although I'd love to have such functionality for the 3D-view of PV, one other 
idea I just had: Is it possible to load a paraview scene within a python script 
such that I'd do the creation of the animation there? Would it be possible then 
to use vtkVectorText+vtkFollower?

Many thanks for Your help.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 4.1: animations of large data
Message-ID: <54AD00C7.1000107@inria.fr>

I create animation using PV with mpi. I can create 200 frames quickly, 
no problem.

The problem is visualizing the frames. What I do currently is to create 
a gif
convert *.jpg animation.gif
animate animation.gif

The problem is that the gif file is huge, takes a long time to load the 
gif file.

1- Are there other visualization options that will be more rapid? I 
would like to animate 1000 frames which is not possible using a mono gif 
file.
2- The jpg s are 64-bit, is there a convert option to reduce the options 
to 32-bit?
Thanks for your precious advice,
Stephen
p.s.
Some links to my animations are given below.

You should create directly a video file from paraview. The 4.1 version
installed on nef is able to create directly ogv files.

Hi Alan,

I'm thinking it may be easiest to let Python do the heavy lifting on this
to figure out the files to read in. You can use glob from the glob module
and then sort the files. So that would look like:
=======
import glob
files = glob.glob("z_pinch*")
files.sort() # if the order of the files isn't important you can probably
skip this
========

You can use more advanced regex's in the glob() method to get pickier about
the desired files, do a bit of playing around with sort() to get
non-default sorting and then play with the list to get the files you want
from them like the last 4 files.

Cheers,
Andy

Thanks Nicolas. I tried ogv and it is much, much faster than using convert.

How does one add sound in ParaView 4.1? Any suggestions?

Most filters would have to do something like Andy suggests, but the Exodus reader just so happens to have the ability to find all relevant files if you point to the first one (for historical reasons). So using the following should work:

z_pinch1exo8 = ExodusIIReader(FileName='z_pinch1.exo.8.0')

Yep, that did it.  Only option I didn't try.  I will pass this on to my user.

This is also an issue, since if a user wants to only open file 'z_pinch1.exo.8.0', or 'z_pinch1.exo.8.5' which does happen fairly often, they can't.  Any ideas how to get that to work?  Maybe we need to rethink how we open all files?

Yeah, I can certainly see that as a problem. We could change the behavior to be more like other modern readers where you have to list all the files, but that would break backward compatibility and some other features (such as restart case files <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Restarted_Simulation_Readers#Exodus_Time_Series_Case_Files> and who knows what else).

I don't have a good fix.

z_pinch1exo8 = ExodusIIReader(FileName=['z_pinch1.exo."totalFileCount".*'])


Is this possible in Python?  What is the format?

If the user wants to window into his data, say take the last 4 files, is this possible?

Thanks,

Alan

A tab could be pasted into the field, I imagine (works here in other
fields).

Interesting coincidence: over the Christmas break, as a fun project
for the break, I was thinking of working on refactoring ParaView's
output window to borrow ideas from Chrome's console/output window
which allows for nice formatting as well as grouping of repeated
messages etc. I never got around to actually implementing it, however
:). I just had a discussion with Dan. He'll work on putting up a
design page to collect some of the targeted features.

The script was created by running an interactive Paraview session and
recording the commands. I then modified it slightly to add the loop and
some variables.

I have been able to run the script successfully on 1,2,16 and 32 cores
successfully and it loops twice. However when I try to run on 64 cores I
get the following error message:

I am afraid there is an issue with memory leakage or improper memory
allocation and deallocation. At this point I do not know how to proceed to
debug it. Is there an obvious problem in in the script and the way datasets
are deallocated at the end of each iteration?

Correct, the user has a specific XML file / block of code he wants to load.  He is working on a car engine, with a few hundred blocks.  He is coloring the car engine by material type ? aluminum, steel, rubber, copper, etc.

Alan,

What does your user want to do exactly? Does he have a color XML that he wants to load?

There is an issue with the trace recorder missing color preset changes.  I wrote up a bug here: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15116.  However, I need the python for a user so that he can manually edit the trace script and change color presets.  Does anyone either know the python I need, or where to find it?

Thanks,

Alan

Subject: [Paraview] Relative frequencies in Histogram plots
Message-ID: <CACoCd8dask8qNs16Tift=DX+Vh9dVhwXsxxYfXjK_2Lx2LVLmg@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon and happy new year!

I have a colleague who would like to be able to plot the relative frequency
of the histogram data instead of absolute bin count. I.e. instead of having
the left axis say there are 100 things in bin one, he'd like for it to say
that 5% of the things are in bin one.

Is this possible?

Thank you!

Subject: [Paraview] Help with memory crash?

So I did some more tests by running the script interactively. I used a
smaller grid first, 2002 x 20 x 1000 points and ran it only for 1
iteration. When Paraview loaded the memory usage on the server was 1.04GB.
After doing one iteration the memory usage spiked to 10.42GB and remained
like that when the script finished. What I found out is the Delete
statements make no difference at all, with or without them the memory usage
remained 10.42GB. Performing more iterations in the script actually worsens
this problem, after 4 iterations the memory used increased to 14.32GB. With
a larger grid of 2002 x 100 x 1000 points the memory after one iteration
increased from 10.42GB before the script to 45.25GB after the script. How
can I properly delete all datasets and clear the memory in Paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] Help with memory crash?

After reading about memory leaks I modified the script at the end by adding
"del" after "Delete":

  Delete(DataRepresentation4)
  del DataRepresentation4
  Delete(Contour2)
  del Contour2
  Delete(DataRepresentation3)
  del DataRepresentation3
  Delete(Q_VP_xmf)
  del Q_VP_xmf
  Delete(DataRepresentation2)
  del DataRepresentation2
  Delete(Contour1)
  del Contour1
  Delete(DataRepresentation1)
  del DataRepresentation1
  Delete(cf_VP_xmf)
  del cf_VP_xmf

That should fully delete the objects from the memory and it helped a little
but I still have memory leaks. Before the script memory usage in the Memory
Inspector is 1.4Gb and after one iteration it increases to 4Gb, compared to
10Gb without the del statements. After 4 iterations the memory usage
increases to 8Gb. Any ideas on how to track and eliminate completely the
memory leaks? I am forgetting to delete an object from the script?

Subject: [Paraview] Help with 'Plot Selection Over Time' Filter
Message-ID: <CAOX0pDeLMW9fEC1Mzb1t-7GHENXaySom5q7d_cBZsgeX4ZA99w@mail.gmail.com>

I am having the following problem with paraview. I have a .pvd which refers
to 6000-8000 .vtu files one for each time step. Each .vtu file contains
information for a finite element mesh consisting of 40000-50000 nodes in 3
dimensions and contains vector values for displacement , velocity and
acceleration. I load the .pvd file andi nteract with the model or watch the
animation and everything is fine. The problem starts when I select a
certain node and choose 'plot selection over time'  filter. The moment I
press 'Apply' in the pipeline browser, paraview becomes unresponsive and I
have to wait for about 5 minutes for the chart to appear. My pc has 16gb of
ram and an i7 4970k cpu so I don't think that the problem is lack of
resources . Am I doing something wrong? If show can you give me a hint
where to look for a faster solution (a python script maybe) or is this kind
of performance normal for my case?

Thank you very much.

Just guessing here, but your wait time is very likely the number of files.  Plot selection over time will have to open, read, process, and close each of those files.  Try just ?play? for all of the timesteps ? I bet it takes numerous minutes also.  We often run problems (usually fewer timesteps, usually 10 to 1000 times bigger datasets) that take hours to run (either creating movies or plot selection over time) on some big iron clusters.

Just to make sure you aren?t running out of memory, try opening the memory inspector.  View/ Memory Inspector.  Or, open the Task Manager and look at free memory.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Help with 'Plot Selection Over Time' Filter

I am having the following problem with paraview. I have a .pvd which refers to 6000-8000 .vtu files one for each time step. Each .vtu file contains information for a finite element mesh consisting of 40000-50000 nodes in 3 dimensions and contains vector values for displacement , velocity and acceleration. I load the .pvd file andi nteract with the model or watch the animation and everything is fine. The problem starts when I select a certain node and choose 'plot selection over time'  filter. The moment I press 'Apply' in the pipeline browser, paraview becomes unresponsive and I have to wait for about 5 minutes for the chart to appear. My pc has 16gb of ram and an i7 4970k cpu so I don't think that the problem is lack of resources . Am I doing something wrong? If show can you give me a hint where to look for a faster solution (a python script maybe) or is this kind of performance normal for my case?

Thank you very much.

Hello,

Same problem with PV 4.3.0 RC1 (tested on Linux 64 bits binaries)

Best regards.

Hi Nikolaos,

One thing that I would suggest is to restructure your script so that you 
do not create new objects inside your loop. You can usually construct 
your rendering pipeline first then loop over the files(times, arrays, 
etc) modifying the existing pipeline objects and then calling Render 
followed by WriteImage. When you write your script that way you avoid 
the possibility of creating leaks. If you are convinced that there is a 
leak in ParaView we could advise on locating it, however I hesitate to 
give that advise prematurely. It's more likely that the issues are 
resulting from the way your script is structured.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview cmake can't find proper qt
Message-ID: <54B0171D.3010809@nasa.gov>

Hi. My initial run of ccmake complained that my distro's qt was too old, 
so I downloaded and built/installed a supported version in 
/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.6. Thus I set:

//Where can the qmake-qt4 library be found
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.6/bin/qmake

However, even though ccmake completes (allowing the g key to be 
activated), the qt libraries/executables listed in CMakeCache.txt are 
all from the distro's versions (in /usr/lib64/qt4). E.g.,

//Path to a library.
QT_CUSTOMWIDGETPLUGIN_PLUGIN_RELEASE:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/plugins/designer/libcustomwidgetplugin.so

//Path to a program.
QT_DBUSCPP2XML_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin/qdbuscpp2xml

  Is there a QTHOME or similar variable I need to set to get the right 
libraries/executables? Thanks.

Hi Jeff,

Here are the vars that I set:

    prepend-path     PATH /work/apps/qt-4.8.2/bin
    prepend-path     MANPATH :/work/apps/qt-4.8.2/man
    prepend-path     LD_LIBRARY_PATH /work/apps/qt-4.8.2/lib
    prepend-path     LD_RUN_PATH /work/apps/qt-4.8.2/lib

after sourcing this, typing "which qmake" in the shell where you're 
doing your build should print the path to your qt. then cmake should 
find your qt.

the above is an excerpt from a module file 
<http://modules.sourceforge.net/> which provides a convenient way to 
manage multiple installs.

Hey guys,

Just one more question. How do you define:

far  = config.camFac

I cannot find in the code neither config nor camFac variable, so anybody
could explain me how to compute far variable?

This code has helped me so much. 

Yhanks in advance,

Liam

Alan,

Here;s an example to load a color map XML

lut = GetColorTransferFunction("RTData")
with open("/tmp/Blot.xml", "r") as f:
      data = f.read()
      lut.ApplyColorMap(data)

Alan,

Here;s an example to load a color map XML

lut = GetColorTransferFunction("RTData")
with open("/tmp/Blot.xml", "r") as f:
      data = f.read()
      lut.ApplyColorMap(data)

Correct, the user has a specific XML file / block of code he wants to load.  He is working on a car engine, with a few hundred blocks.  He is coloring the car engine by material type ? aluminum, steel, rubber, copper, etc.

What does your user want to do exactly? Does he have a color XML that he wants to load?

However, I need the python for a user so that he can manually edit the trace script and change color presets.  Does anyone either know the python I need, or where to find it?

Thanks,

Jeff,
I probably hit Qt with too big of a hammer, but try the following (Python, but you get the idea).

I believe that the most important single line below is setting the MOC executable.

Alan


    '-DQT_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH='+qtInstallDir+'/include '+\
    '-DQT_MOC_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH='+qtInstallDir+'/bin/moc ' +\
    '-DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH='+qtInstallDir+'/bin/qmake ' +\
    '-DQT_UIC_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH='+qtInstallDir+'/bin/uic '

  # During build, we are having issues linking to Qt - specifically the
  #   libQtXml.so library.  Let's add the Qt library path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  path = os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH')
  os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH']=qtInstallDir+'/lib/:'+path

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] paraview cmake can't find proper qt

Hi. My initial run of ccmake complained that my distro's qt was too old, so I downloaded and built/installed a supported version in /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.6. Thus I set:

//Where can the qmake-qt4 library be found QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.6/bin/qmake

However, even though ccmake completes (allowing the g key to be activated), the qt libraries/executables listed in CMakeCache.txt are all from the distro's versions (in /usr/lib64/qt4). E.g.,

//Path to a library.
QT_CUSTOMWIDGETPLUGIN_PLUGIN_RELEASE:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/plugins/designer/libcustomwidgetplugin.so

//Path to a program.
QT_DBUSCPP2XML_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin/qdbuscpp2xml

  Is there a QTHOME or similar variable I need to set to get the right libraries/executables? Thanks.

-jeff

Thanks Utkarsh for your reply. I've gone through the blog a few times
already but I still don't understand the whole procedure. I even tried
to just run the example in the blog in a Programmable Source but it
doesn't work ('No module named numpy_interface'). Part of the issue
could be that I still don't fully understand the RequestInformation,
RequestUpdateExtent, and RequestData bits of the filter.

The input data that I'm working on in the pipeline (vtk unstructured
grid) already have different time steps. How can I update the values of
the inputs for the different time steps?

Thank you,
Omid

Ethan,
Pretty sure you didn?t get a reply.  The simple answer is that it probably won?t work.  Mind writing up a feature request?  This is a pretty good idea.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Relative frequencies in Histogram plots

Good afternoon and happy new year!

I have a colleague who would like to be able to plot the relative frequency of the histogram data instead of absolute bin count. I.e. instead of having the left axis say there are 100 things in bin one, he'd like for it to say that 5% of the things are in bin one.

Is this possible?

Thank you!

Not sure what's the issue. I tested out in my build and seems to work as
expected. Mind attaching your CMakeCache.txt file? Did you by any chance
turn on PARAVIEW_USE_UNIFIED_BINDINGS cmake flag?

in that post config.camFac was a variable for used for fine tuning the 
camera position. It could be 1.0 to go with default, less than 1.0 to 
move camera closer or greater than 1.0 to move the camera away.

Since I originally posted the script I had made improvements to it which 
I'll paste below. To remind of the context of the script below: I have 
2d axis aligned image data in the object named bovr. the script below 
automatically positions the camera and sizes the view according to the 
aspect ratio of the data. "config_camZoom" is a fine tuning parameter, 
and is documented here 
<http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCamera.html#a64512cc87555856a84f6c7d00abe0da9>. 
1.0 is the value to start with.

hope this helps

Subject: [Paraview] making vtkGaussianSplatter multi-threaded
Message-ID: <54B3A861.6060805@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


Since I already started to create and use a modified version of 
vtkGaussianSplatter I now wonder if it were possible to make vtkGaussianSplatter 
run multi-threaded. I'd expect that this is possible if getting and setting 
pixel values is thread-safe. In vtkGaussianSplatter pixel values are stored in a 
vtkDoubleArray and read with GetValue and written with SetTuple. There is no 
info in the docs whether SetTuple (in the way used) is thread-safe. Although 
GetValue seems to exist, I cannot find any hint in the docs that vtkDoubleArray 
offers this function, however a thread-safe version of GetTuple exists.
So is there any reason vtkGaussianSplatter cannot be made multi-threaded with VTK6?

I found vtkGaussianScalarSplatter in the MADAI Workbench 
(https://github.com/MADAI/MADAIWorkbench/tree/71086409933f5c7dbb4ad56e1cd79939325ee7cd/Plugins/GaussianScalarSplatter) 
which seems to be based on vtkGaussianSplatter and originally was multi-threaded 
(https://github.com/MADAI/MADAIWorkbench/commit/8a6d9eba7a1cddeac38a9af03ef6c3dd197308d7). 

As far as I understand the code, the output of that filter is different to that 
of vtkGaussianSplatter, as setting the model bounds is disabled and the function 
SetScalar is gone and replaced by vtkGaussianScalarSplatter_erf.

Are there any other derivatives of vtkGaussianSplatter that are multi-threaded 
that I could use instead?

Thanks for any help or hints.
Roman

The SetTuple/GetTuple methods don't lock the array, so they equivalent to
(but slower than) raw memory reads and writes. And writing memory is not
thread safe if threads can write to the same memory address or (depending
on alignment) to adjacent addresses.

For vtkGaussianSplatter, any performance gains that could be had by
multi-threading would depend on the threads all being able to write at the
same time, therefore any sort of "lock" would kill the performance by
essentially serializing the writes.  Hence, in order for
vtkGaussianSplatter to be properly multi-threaded, each thread must write
to its own block of output memory.  After the splatting is done these must
be composited together.

I wrote a multi-threaded splatting filter once (for ultrasound
reconstruction), and in that case I divided my input points such that each
thread would write to different (but adjacent) memory regions within the
output.  It performed well but wasn't completely thread-safe, because it
was possible for memory collisions to occur on the border between the
regions.

In summary: properly multi-threading vtkGaussianSplatter would be a
moderately difficult task.  I haven't heard of anyone who has done it yet.

Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F682AEC5A3D@MBX111.d.ethz.ch>

Hello List

I cannot find information about reading  a collection of binary time-dependent PLY files. My files are numbered with leading zeroes and *.ply extension

the GUI shows me "filename-00*" but ParaView does not recognize the series as a time collection. It only shows  the first file.

Converting to STL files enables time animation. Can the same not be enabled for PLY files?

TIA

So a simple way to make vtkGaussianSplatter multi-threaded would be to partition 
the input points into n groups and run vtkGaussianSplatter on each group, 
resulting in n fully sized outputs, which have to be combine together 
afterwards. The problem is that this will need n times the memory.

Would it help and be possible to only lock access in these border regions?

Many thanks again.

Subject: [Paraview] realizing partial updates of filter-pipeline within a

Message-ID: <54B4060B.20009@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


If a single paraview plugin consists of multiple connected vtk-fiters (like a 
mini-pipeline) and Apply is clicked again after some of its parameters have been 
changed in the Properties panel.
Is it possible to only cause updates to specific filters in this pipeline, i.e. 
those for which e.g. a parameter was changed in the GUI?

Thanks for any help or hints.

Hi Utkarsh,

> To get the year started, we have the ParaView 4.3.0, Release Candidate 1 binaries available for download [1]. ...


Will it be possible to build branded ParaView applications from an *installed* version of ParaView 4.3 instead of requiring a build directory? I haven't been able to find a bug in the tracker for this.

	Thanks,
	David

You could do this using a Python Programmable Filter.

Here's a script to use:

import numpy
sum = numpy.sum(inputs[0].RowData["bin_values"])
array = 1.0 * inputs[0].RowData["bin_values"]
array = 100.0*array/sum
output.RowData.append(array, "bin_values")
output.RowData.append(inputs[0].RowData["bin_extents"], "bin_extents")

Attached is a state file.

Before some yells at me for using bad code for type conversion :),
here's a better code:

import numpy
sum = numpy.sum(inputs[0].RowData["bin_values"])
array = inputs[0].RowData["bin_values"].astype(numpy.float32)
array = 100.0*array/sum
output.RowData.append(array, "bin_values")
output.RowData.append(inputs[0].RowData["bin_extents"], "bin_extents")

Hum,

That should not really matter root or no-root. But since lot of test
perform some rendering operations and that we capture that section of the
screen, we often (on wrongly setup dashboard) see screensaver capture
instead of the user desktop where the expected rendering is actually
happening. (Hence my previous comment) Such error provide false positive
error.

And looking at several tests here:
https://open.cdash.org/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=3650082
I've notice the same captured image.

When you run "ctest -D Experimental", do you see flashing windows poping up
with that image?
Or do they seems to be somewhat valid?
If you try again, try to see if you can disable the screensaver altogether.

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Volume and the Find Data or Calculator
Message-ID: <9d01f292c24e4754b69e312499249019@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Is it possible to find the volume of each cell, and create a new variable with this information?

Thanks,

Alan

Try "volume(inputs[0])" as the expression for Python calculator to
compute a "Cell Data" result. That should give you volume for each
cell in the dataset.

Sweet!  Thanks, I have been asked for that for ages.

So, why isn't that natively in the GUI calculator?  Is the calculator where it belongs?  Mind if I add a feature request, targeted for 4.4?

David,

On Linux, it is supported. You can turn on
"PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES", then you can build off a install
tree.

It isn't currently fully supported/tested on Mac and Windows.

Hi Jeff,

looking at your test here:
https://open.cdash.org/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=3650142

It seems much better. Some of the tests still fail as another window went
on top (terminal or web browser).
And some other failures seems to be related to a zoom factor which was
different.

Base on what I've seen, your ParaView seems OK.
Although, I'm wondering if you have the proper set of OpenGL drivers.

That test show for example some differences in term of quality.
=> https://open.cdash.org/testDetails.php?test=306359279&build=3650142

But as far as I can tell, you seems to be all set.

I'm tracking this part of it down; do you still have the CMakeCache.txt
related to this failure? If the current build is the same one as here
with just PARAVIEW_USE_UNIFIED_BINDINGS flipped, that will work.

Thanks,

Hi everybody,

This file (attached) is generated by a Finite Element code, and when trying
to open it from Paraview (v4.2 Win64), it crashes (just after clicking
'Apply'). I checked the file against the specification, and it seems to me
that it is ok. Also, as sometimes a file generated by the code can be
opened with Paraview not crashing, I have the vague impression that the
problem could be related to a large number of cells. To my impression, this
is not a big number of cells, but it happens that smaller files are opened
without problem. I also attach a file generated by the same code that I am
able to open.

I wonder if some expert could check the files and catch an error, or point
me in the right direction to explore for a solution.

Thanks in advance.

The number of items in CELLS is incorrect. It should be 1684, not
3789. Fixed version attached.

The native GUI calculator doesn't support such features. We created
the Python calculator to a support such functions with ease. We should
investigate making function discovery easy for the Python calculator
for sure.

Would it be possible to add volume calculation/retrieval to the GUI calculator?  I hear a need for this functionality fairly frequently, including from non Python folks.  

Regarding making function discovery and use easy for the Python Calculator, see this as an equally useful functionality to the trace recorder.  I.e., somewhat game changing.

Subject: [Paraview] Opacity crashing ParaView and Value Range field for
 creating multiple slices is missing
Message-ID: <CAHou1pC4Be7-EMB-gUYh2O=2WWxuPxRYeF3OvaSQTp6bDY3osQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to ParaView and going through the first webinar, using the demo
data set disk_out.ref. I'm using ParaView 4.2.0 on two different Windows
64-bit computers.

I'm having two problems, one on each computer.

1. On the first computer, a desktop, when I go to change opacity of the
main disk_out_ref.ex2 object, ParaView crashes. Is this a problem with my
graphics card?

2. On the second computer, a laptop, the opacity changes just fine,
however, for creating multiple slices, the Value Range field is missing
(under the Properties tab for Slice 1, immediately under the "Triangulate
the slice" option). How do I get it to show up? I have tried quitting and
restarting, and also tried ParaView 4.3.0 and had no success.

Thanks,

- Mary

Hi all,

Has anyone successfully built the superbuild of Paraview on Yellowstone (actually, caldera)?  I am attempting to compile, and I keep getting a freetype build failure.

Here is the failure:

If anyone has had any luck with this, could you please let me know the trick?

Mary,
Since one computer works and the other doesn?t, sounds like a graphics card issue to me.  Try updating your graphics drivers?  Also, try PV 4.3.0.  I know there was a problem with some volume rendering for older versions of OpenGL.  This should be fixed for PV 4.3.0.  Note that the next version of ParaView will require a somewhat newer version of OpenGL than PV 4.3.0, so if this is the problem, you are on borrowed time for volume rendering and opacity rendering.

I just tried, and got multiple slices to work just fine.  The trick is to click on the blue plus sign, slightly right of the Value Range window.  You can then edit the value that appears.  Does that work?

Alan

Hi,

I'm new to ParaView and going through the first webinar, using the demo data set disk_out.ref. I'm using ParaView 4.2.0 on two different Windows 64-bit computers.

I'm having two problems, one on each computer.

1. On the first computer, a desktop, when I go to change opacity of the main disk_out_ref.ex2 object, ParaView crashes. Is this a problem with my graphics card?

2. On the second computer, a laptop, the opacity changes just fine, however, for creating multiple slices, the Value Range field is missing (under the Properties tab for Slice 1, immediately under the "Triangulate the slice" option). How do I get it to show up? I have tried quitting and restarting, and also tried ParaView 4.3.0 and had no success.

Thanks,

- Mary

Alan,

Thanks for your reply. I'm out of the office until Friday, so I'll have to
wait to try upgrading my graphics drivers on the desktop until then. The
laptop problem, however, continues. I'm attaching a screen snapshot of what
I see. Am I missing something?

Thanks again,

- Mary

Hi Mary,

Try clicking the small gear icon in the property panel. That should display the advanced settings like value range.

Hello

I successfully updated paraview and my plugins from 4.1 with qt4 to 4.3 with qt5. But now my personal polydata meshes were not colored correctly. In paraview 4.1 I added Point Attribute based field data to my triangles (vtkPolydata object) with a 3 component RGB unsigned char array named color to color the meshes. Now in PV4.3 only the magnitude is displayed. Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks for help and tips

Gerald

Hey Mark,

Yes that is superfluous now. We removed the GIL back in the 4.0 transition to be compatible with python libraries that are incompatible with it. Since then you don't need to manage it directly anymore.

Hello,

I?ve started migrating a set of plugins written in ParaView 3.14.1 to ParaView 4.0.1 There?s a class method that uses pqPythonShell and tries to call releaseControl(). Sure enough, pqPythonShell in 3.14.1 has a releseControl() method, but it?s no longer there in 4.0.1.

What?s recommended for this, is that method just superfluous now?

Thanks,

Alan,

I successfully upgraded my OpenGL version and changing opacity works just
fine now.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi,

I'm new to ParaView and going through the first webinar, using the demo data set disk_out.ref. I'm using ParaView 4.2.0 on two different Windows 64-bit computers.

I'm having two problems, one on each computer.

1. On the first computer, a desktop, when I go to change opacity of the main disk_out_ref.ex2 object, ParaView crashes. Is this a problem with my graphics card?

2. On the second computer, a laptop, the opacity changes just fine, however, for creating multiple slices, the Value Range field is missing (under the Properties tab for Slice 1, immediately under the "Triangulate the slice" option). How do I get it to show up? I have tried quitting and restarting, and also tried ParaView 4.3.0 and had no success.

Thanks,

- Mary

Utkarsh,

Thank you very much. That is exactly what we were looking for. I just knew
that there had to be a way to do it using the "Programmable Filter" but I
didn't know how!

Cheers, and thank you again for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] VTK parallel unstructured grid and halo elements
Message-ID: <CAOCDKs-QyegsnEEypxCewSSRe82tDBvPwXMOepCj5kDxjmY3fA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Paraview list,

I use a finite element code that generates VTK output, but I'm having
trouble dealing with halo (ghost) nodes/elements correctly.

We currently partition meshes node-wise, and each process writes all its
owned nodes and one level of halo nodes to a chunk. Once all the chunks are
loaded there is a "double layer" of internal boundaries between processes.
I'd really like to be able to use the Extract Surface filter correctly but
as you would expect it also finds all the internal surfaces. From searching
I've tried:

* Clean To Grid, but this removes both sides of the double layer leaving
unsightly gaps.
* Writing a vtkGhostPoints array (on nodes) but this seems not to be used
by this filter (or Paraview at all?)
* Writing a vtkGhostLevels array (on elements). This correctly hides all
the ghost elements at the internal boundaries (great!) but still doesn't
let me do everything I want to. For example, the extracted surface looks
right, but the array limits still seem to be based on the max/min of the
external AND internal surfaces, so I suspect the internal ones are just
"hidden from view".

What's the right way to deal with this?

Thanks in advance.

Louie

Hello.

Same problem again with "merge blocks" filter with PV 4.3.1. Is it the 
same version as PV 4.3.0. RC1 ?

I attached a picture showing the pipeline built from scratch (I do not 
read a state file) and the error message. The data sets are the simple 
Tecplot (Vislt) files sent in a previous mail.

Is there a way, with the comparative render view, to set what time the four viewports are at?  If I have a user that is interested in looking at 4 times, not evenly distributed throughout the run, can he do this?  How?

Thanks,

Alan

In "Comparative View Inspector", add a new "track" from "Time" and
then manually entire the time values of interest for each view in the
widget under the "Time" combo-box.

OK, when I try what you suggest, using can.exo, I have a window of 2X2 viewports - i.e., 4 viewports.  In the comparative view inspector, when I hit the blue +, I only see two entries.  I want one for each viewport, or 4.  Am I missing something?

Alan,

In your screenshot I see 4 entries for the time value: two columns :
A, B and two rows: 0, 1. You can manually enter values there.
Sometimes, only column A may be shown, that's because of the width is
too narrow -- not in your screenshot, however.

Subject: [Paraview] Specify TCP interface for pvserver to listen on
Message-ID: <54BE3E1B.3060208@stfc.ac.uk>

Hello,

In a nutshell; can one somehow specify the TCP interface on which 
pvserver listens for connections?

The background:

I've been using pvserver on a remote machine and connecting to it from 
behind a firewall without problems for a while.
However, the remote machine has recently been re-configured and the 
login nodes now have two TCP interfaces, only one of which is publicly 
accessible. Unfortunately the pvserver is binding to the 'private' 
interface and thus I cannot connect to it.
I've tried using an ssh tunnel from the public interface to the private 
interface but unfortunately I get an 'administratively prohibited' 
message from ssh when I try to connect.

Does anyone know of a solution?

Thanks very much,

Andy.

Message-ID: <C8921E2F87E8024BBD6C59CB07C0F47D28D7853C@AAI-EXCH-MBX1.campus.unibe.ch>

Dear Paraview List,
I have different polydata with the same structure (same point data arrays). I am showing them in two 3D views side by side in the same layout window, and with the same camera view (I used the camera link feature).
Is it possible to link also the visible data array in the same two views? So, for example, if I switch from "solid color" to "array1" in the first view, also the data in the second view is updated and coloured according to "array1"? I tried to check the  link manager but I could not recognize the properties for this effect (should be something like DataRepresentation or DisplayProperties?). I am using Paraview 4.1.

Thank you
Best regards
Livia Barazzetti

Message-ID: <30CD7BA2-5C96-4D24-B0DB-BBAAA1D535E5@geo.uib.no>

Hi,


I?m running a pvserver and connect to it from my local client. I can easily open files stored on the server, but can?t seem to manage to load a state file from the server. 

When I?m connected to the server, the ?Load State??  window is showing my local machine file system and not the server file system? 

Am I missing something?

I?ve also tried using the Python shell - but had no success either:

> from paraviewSimple import *
> connection =  server manager.Connect(?server.name?,111111)
> LoadServer(?/home/gdu001/state.pvsm",connection)

ERROR: In /Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release-Python27/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/XMLParser/vtkXMLParser.cxx, line 218
vtkPVXMLParser (0x7ff674477b30): Cannot open XML file: /home/gdu001/state.pvsm


Versions: Paraview 4.2.0 installed both locally (mac OS X, from 64-bit bundle) and on the server (redhead Linux, built from source). Running pvserver on the server. 

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel rendering of XDMF unstructured data
Message-ID: <CAPBPWZxyasxGKi_6VhBz3JnawtovVrcBwE3KjzB3yMS80Jtwxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

 Hello,

 I have an unstructured mesh, with 2 million points, in a single
'HDF5/XDMF' file format that I am trying to visualize on our clusters. The
goal is to perform remote parallel rendering on our cluster ( 16 processors
per node and 64 GB memory) nodes using a client-server model.

Currently I load this file on a single node with 16 processes, apply the D3
filter to it, followed by the application of a 'Clip' filter.  This dataset
contains time-steps and when I try to animate it over time, the memory
usage on the remote compute node increases with each time-step and this
eventually causes 'pvserver' to crash.

However, I can partition the data using D3 and write it out as '*.pvtu'
files. When I restart ParaView and read the '*.pvtu' files back in and
perform the same rendering tests, the performance seems to scale pretty
well and memory usage is kept to a minimum.

Is this something to do with the XDMF reader ? Is the D3 filter not being
applied correctly ?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Custom filter/reader
Message-ID: <54BE8702.5040505@sogeti.com>

Dear mailing list,

I would like to create a customisation of paraview to achieve the following :

  *   data of kind multi-group are stored in 2 files that have no available readers
     *   the first file contains the geometry, composed of several parts like geom1, geom2
     *   the second file contains the datasets bound to the geometry, composed of several datasets like data1, data2
  *   for my purposes, I'd like to create a pipeline that would look like the following in the pipeline browser
     *   builtin
        *   data1 (full geometry with dataset restricted to data1)
           *   geom1 (restriction of the parent node to a geometry part)
           *   geom2
        *   data2
           *   geom1
           *   geom2


After having read most of the wiki and other informations here and there, I am puzzled about how to tackle this in practice.

Is it possible to create a custom reader that would read the 2 files and would produce more than one pipeline source like data1 and data2 in the above example?

Furthermore, could a reader create the full pipeline as well?

Kindest regards,

Hi,

First of all -- thank you for this great release and especially for the
free user guide!

However I've noticed couple glitches on my debian testing amd64:
a) can't permanently change camera settings (Edit->Settings->Camera) --
default values restored after restart
b) it's really hard to work with advanced properties of Line Chart View
-- for example simply add notation to an axis is difficult! It would be
great to have separate window for such settings (as it was in previous
releases, 4.1 and earlier).

Hi Kazuyoshi,

Did you update the ParaView submodules?

Try running

git submodule update --init

from within the ParaView source directory and compile again.

Hope that helps,
Cory

If I am not mistaken, this was never supported, right? Mind adding a
feature request to the bug tracker so we don't forget about this?
Thanks.

That's doable. See Chapter 9, Section 9.2. Or this blog post [1]

Hey guys!
I'm in trouble trying to make some plots in paraview.
For my analysis, it's important to plot data from a specific point over
time.
I'm trying some filters, but I'm not succeeding. Do you have some tips or
advices? Thank you for your attention.

What are the errors you're getting? What cmake version are you using?
Dan, did the fix for hdf5 with cmake version get merged in time for
4.3.1?

Have you tried the "Plot Selection Over Time" filter?
It's in "Filter->Data Analysis". You can select cell or point data.

The guys from the lab did an experiment and measured the residual stress on
some points with specific coordinates.
I have to measure the stress on the same points along time in my simulation
so i can compare the results with the real values and validate my model.
But I don't know how to do that.

For moving grids or grids that don't have a grid point exactly at the
coordinate you want to plot over time, you can use the probe filter to get
the desired location and then use the plot selection over time for that.

I was using cmake-2.8.11 and I upgraded to cmake-3.1.0, but I?m still seeing errors.   I?m currently dying in QT -  I?ve seen these QCLUcene errors before, but not on the platforms  that I?m currently testing the builds on ?.  I believe that I get around this by going into the qt build directory and running ?make install? and the problem goes  away.

I?m having trouble building 4.3.1 on several systems where 4.2 built without issue.  Is there a particular version of cmake that 4.3.1 needs to be built with?

Rick,

Can you try using the "release" branch on the Superbuild repo (or the
v4.3.1 tag)? There have been quite  few changes merged into git/master
of the repo since which may be causing these issues.

Subject: [Paraview] Immersive VRPN - Paraview - CAVE display questions
Message-ID: <CAE=GJrYx2-z3Zrbox0YHSj3QGLC2SroazH_eO5sUk8CUoJ30EQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, my name is Leonardo Pessanha and i work at the Computational Methods
and Engineering lab at COPPE-UFRJ in a scientific visualization project and
i've facing some problems dealing with immesive paraview

I am working in a Windows 7 - 64 bit environment
I've compiled paraview 4.0.1 with qt 4.8.2 - Microsoft MPI (4.2.4400.0) -
vrpn 7.31 using VS2008
My stereoscopic system is passive and i am using the
--stereo-type=SplitViewportHorizontal flag
My tracking system is from ARTrack, and so far, i am only interested in the
wand
interactions, letting the headtracking for later

First, i would like to know if there's any major changes/fixes in the
immersive part of paraview from the 4.0.1 to the 4.2.0 that justifies a new
compilation. It would be positive?

After setting up the server and loading the VRPN plugin I've succeeded
adding the grab interaction with the Model Transform Matrix but i had some
obstacles

It took me a while to understand that my center of rotation was 0 , 0 , 0 -
and i would like to know if there's a way of changing that. My data is
usually VTK Structured_Point and the format uses the 0 , 0 , 0 as the lower
left point of the data, so it would be useful to change the center of
rotation to the center of the object.

------------

Sometimes while doing translation i have a weird flickering movement that
i've managed to control using the TrackerTransform value

1 0 0 1
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1
0 0 0 1

I don't know why it worked, and i don't know why it doesn't work changing
some of the matrix values, so i would like to understand a little better
since i am a little blind in that aspect

------------

Right now i am trying to find a solution on the model illumination. I don't
know why but only the backface of my model is illuminated. It's like the
illumination camera position does not change at all, only the view camera.
A way around that is flipping the normals but it does not solve my problem
since only a part of the model is affected by the flip

------------
I've read in the participants page that the ARL contributed with the CAVE
display. It would be a good idea to contact them?

I would be glad to share more details if it's needed.

I would really appreciate if someone could help in any of this aspects.
Thanks in advance

Hi All,

I need to build CosmoTools extensions in ParaView. There are some 
dependencies that I'm having a hard time locating. For example 
"GenericIO". Web search turns up nill, and the URL listed in the super 
build(git://kwsource.kitwarein.com/genericio/genericio.git) seems to be 
either private or bad. Anyone know where I can get this?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Display user-defined point and cell IDs from Ensight6
 file as labels
Message-ID: <287077896.12441410.1421877526916.JavaMail.zimbra@udc.es>

Hi,

I need to display (as labels) the user-defined point IDs and cell IDs in ASCII Ensight6 geometry files. These IDs are neither zero-based nor contiguous.

Ensight does it correctly, but Paraview displays zero-based contiguous IDs instead of the user-defined IDs given in the file.
The user-defined IDs neither show in the spreadsheet view of Paraview.

I send attached a very simple example:

  ensight6_case.case       data file (case).
  ensight6_geometry.geo    data file (geometry). Point IDs=3,5,32,33. Cell IDs=10,20.
  Ensight.PNG              Ensight screenshot, displaying used-defined IDs.
  Paraview.PNG             Paraview screenshot, not displaying used-defined IDs.
  Paraview_state.zip       Paraview state file after the screenshot.
  ens_checker_output.txt   Ensight checker output, showing that the file format is correct.

For your information, I copy here the attached geometry file (ensight6_geometry.geo):

---- START OF FILE: ensight6_geometry.geo ----
This is a test file
ASCII
node id given

      32 0.00000e+00 5.94416e-01 0.00000e+00

      20      32       3      33
---- END OF FILE: ensight6_geometry.geo ----

To reproduce my problem in Paraview 4.3.1 64 bit on Windows 7:
  Open the .case file and make it visible in the Pipeline Browser.
  Select all cells, activate Cell Labels = ID in the Selection Display Inspector.
  Select all points, activate Point Labels = ID in the Selection Display Inspector.


I know I could workaround it by also storing the used-defined IDs as scalar fields per point and per cell. But this forces me to generate 2 additional files (point field and cell field) for each .geo file, thus triplicating the number of files for my transient data.

Would it be possible with a different file format? I mean, is there any other ASCII file format that supports used-defined point and cell IDs that Paraview can read and display as labels?

I asked I similar question 5 years ago for the Ensight Gold format, but I did not get a solution:

Hi Cory,

I could build it after the `git submodule update --init`
command.  Thanks!
(Well, I must confess that I've heard about the command 
but completely forgotten...  I wonder if I can automate
the update of the submodules...)

Kazuyoshi,

No problem. We all forget to update the submodules from time to time :-)

Hello.

I still have a problem with the "merge blocks" filter in Paraview 4.3.1 
(see my attached picture) so I must stay on PV 4.1.0 if I want to use 
this filter.

I found this problem first in PV 4.2.0.( see all messages in 
http://markmail.org/message/fvatgidqbvnufgi6 subject)
It was said that this problem was related to the bug 
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15022  that is now marked as 
fixed, but "merge blocks" still fails.

I found also this problem in PV 4.3.0 RC1 ? Is the PV 4.3.1 version the 
same as PV 4.3.0 RC1 ?

Regards.

Richard

Subject: [Paraview] compile itk (VTKGlue ON) with vtk from paraview
Message-ID: <54C0CF2E.3060106@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


What configuration is needed to compile itk (4.6.1) with VTKGlue enabled with 
vtk from paraview (4.3.1) in order to compile Paraview plugins making use of ITK 
and VTK?


If I configure ITK to with:
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                ON
Module_ITKVtkGlue                ON
VTK_DIR                          /opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/cmake/paraview-4.3

cmake complains about a missing VTKTargets.cmake even though 
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES was set to ON. After a

cp VTK/VTKTargets.cmake /opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/cmake/paraview-4.3/

cmake is happy but I get linker errors at the end of the compilation of ITK when 
the VTKGlue is due:

Linking CXX shared library ../../../../lib/libITKVtkGlue-4.6.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkSciberQuest
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkEyeDomeLighting
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkQvis
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkPointSpriteRendering
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkPVPythonCatalyst
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkPointSpriteGraphics
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer


Switching off all PV plugin builds only leaves:

Linking CXX shared library ../../../../lib/libITKVtkGlue-4.6.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkPVPythonCatalyst
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer

However, the files are there:

find /opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/ -name '*vtkPVPythonCatalyst*so*'
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/site-packages/vtk/vtkPVPythonCatalystPython.so
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/libvtkPVPythonCatalyst-pv4.3.so.1
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/libvtkPVPythonCatalystPython27D-pv4.3.so.1
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/libvtkPVPythonCatalyst-pv4.3.so
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/libvtkPVPythonCatalystPython27D-pv4.3.so

find /opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/ -name '*vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer*so*'
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/libvtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer-pv4.3.so.1
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/libvtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer-pv4.3.so


Adding the abs. file locations to the build command does not help nor does 
-L/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/paraview-4.3/


Using the build dir of VTK in PV-tree instead for ITK does not help either:
VTK_DIR                          /opt/compilation/ParaView-v4.3.1/build/VTK



If I configure ITK to with:
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                OFF


I get linker errors in the last stage when compiling a PV plugin that makes use 
of VTK and ITK:

/usr/bin/ld: 
/opt/compilation/InsightToolkit-4.6.1/build/lib/libitkvnl_algo-4.6.a(vnl_real_eigensystem.cxx.o): 
relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata.str1.8' can not be used when making a 
shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/opt/compilation/InsightToolkit-4.6.1/build/lib/libitkvnl_algo-4.6.a: could not 
read symbols: Bad value

After I've added
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS                  -fPIC

to Paraview and ITK and recompiled both I get:

/usr/bin/ld: 
/opt/compilation/InsightToolkit-4.6.1/build/lib/libitkv3p_netlib-4.6.a(dlamch.c.o): 
relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.bss' can not be used when making a shared 
object; recompile with -fPIC
/opt/compilation/InsightToolkit-4.6.1/build/lib/libitkv3p_netlib-4.6.a: could 
not read symbols: Bad value


What am I missing in my configuration of PV and ITK?

When and where should I specify:
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS                  -fPIC
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                ON/OFF

Is this the right VTK_DIR specification for ITK:
/opt/compilation/ParaView-v4.3.1/build/VTK
or
/opt/paraview-4.3.1_git/lib/cmake/paraview-4.3



Many thanks for any help or hints.
Roman

FYI ? as I thought, manually running ?make install? allowed me to get past the QCLucene errors as it has in the past.     Looks like I then made it all of the way through to the paraview before it died with some python class errors.    Looks like cmake is picking up my system python instead of the one that I?m building as part of the ParaView distro.   That?s new.     How do I get it to pick up the Paraview/python not the system python?

I was using cmake-2.8.11 and I upgraded to cmake-3.1.0, but I?m still seeing errors.   I?m currently dying in QT -  I?ve seen these QCLUcene errors before, but not on the platforms  that I?m currently testing the builds on ?.  I believe that I get around this by going into the qt build directory and running ?make install? and the problem goes  away.

I?m having trouble building 4.3.1 on several systems where 4.2 built without issue.  Is there a particular version of cmake that 4.3.1 needs to be built with?

I reran ?ccmake? in the paraview build directory and changed python to
point to the one in the Paraview build rather than the system python, and
I now have a clean build.      So,  there are a couple of issues:

QCLucene ? why does it fail and require a manual ?make install? to complete
Python ? why isnt? cmake picking up python  from the build directory?
It seems to have ignored the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directive

As far as I know, these are ?new? issues.  I?m building on a generic RHEL5
workstation for the first build.  They get much more difficult on the HPC
systems.

Also ? mpiexec didn?t get pushed to the install directory.
It?s in the build directory but didn?t make it to install.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.3.1 is available for download

I reran ?ccmake? in the paraview build directory and changed python to
point to the one in the Paraview build rather than the system python, and
I now have a clean build.      So,  there are a couple of issues:

QCLucene ? why does it fail and require a manual ?make install? to complete
Python ? why isnt? cmake picking up python  from the build directory?
It seems to have ignored the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directive

As far as I know, these are ?new? issues.  I?m building on a generic RHEL5
workstation for the first build.  They get much more difficult on the HPC
systems.

FYI ? as I thought, manually running ?make install? allowed me to get
past the QCLucene errors as it has in the past.     Looks like I then
made it all of the way through to the paraview before it died with some
python class errors.    Looks like cmake
is picking up my system python instead of the one that I?m building as
part of the ParaView distro.   That?s new.     How do I get it to pick up
the Paraview/python not the system python?

I was using cmake-2.8.11 and I upgraded to cmake-3.1.0, but I?m still
seeing errors.   I?m currently dying in QT -  I?ve seen these QCLUcene
errors before, but not on the platforms  that I?m currently testing the
builds on ?.  I believe that I get around
this by going into the qt build directory and running ?make install?
and the problem goes  away.

I?m having trouble building 4.3.1 on several systems where 4.2 built
without issue.  Is there a particular version of cmake that 4.3.1 needs
to be built with?

Rich,

I'd definitely stick with v4.3.1 checkout of the Superbuild. There
have been changed pushed to git/master since the release that don't
yet build on even our dashboards, so there's work that needs to be
done.

i.e.
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git
git checkout v4.3.1

Even if that doesnt' solve the QCLucene problem. Since you said that
was present in the past too, I somehow must have missed that it.
That'd need separate tracking down. Let me know if the Python/MPI
problems persist with the v4.3.1 version of the Superbuild. The
git/master is certainly broken -- Chuck, I am assuming you're looking
into fix the git/master version.

Message-ID: <2094798470.5145860.1421941539667.JavaMail.yahoo@jws106120.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear all,
I would like to know, if there is a way in paraview to mask data arrays with a stl mesh file. For example, let's say we have a tube and? volumetric pressure values. However, the pressure data? extends outside of the tube. Is there a way to mask out those points?

The python and mpi issues both exist with the v4.3.1 of the superbuild ? assuming I?m pulling things in correctly.

Rich,

I'd definitely stick with v4.3.1 checkout of the Superbuild. There
have been changed pushed to git/master since the release that don't
yet build on even our dashboards, so there's work that needs to be
done.

i.e.
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git
git checkout v4.3.1

Even if that doesnt' solve the QCLucene problem. Since you said that
was present in the past too, I somehow must have missed that it.
That'd need separate tracking down. Let me know if the Python/MPI
problems persist with the v4.3.1 version of the Superbuild. The
git/master is certainly broken -- Chuck, I am assuming you're looking
into fix the git/master version.

It?s in the build directory but didn?t make it to install.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.3.1 is available for download

I reran ?ccmake? in the paraview build directory and changed python to
point to the one in the Paraview build rather than the system python, and
I now have a clean build.      So,  there are a couple of issues:

QCLucene ? why does it fail and require a manual ?make install? to complete
Python ? why isnt? cmake picking up python  from the build directory?
It seems to have ignored the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directive

As far as I know, these are ?new? issues.  I?m building on a generic RHEL5
workstation for the first build.  They get much more difficult on the HPC
systems.

FYI ? as I thought, manually running ?make install? allowed me to get
past the QCLucene errors as it has in the past.     Looks like I then
made it all of the way through to the paraview before it died with some
python class errors.    Looks like cmake
is picking up my system python instead of the one that I?m building as
part of the ParaView distro.   That?s new.     How do I get it to pick up
the Paraview/python not the system python?

I was using cmake-2.8.11 and I upgraded to cmake-3.1.0, but I?m still
seeing errors.   I?m currently dying in QT -  I?ve seen these QCLUcene
errors before, but not on the platforms  that I?m currently testing the
builds on ?.  I believe that I get around
this by going into the qt build directory and running ?make install?
and the problem goes  away.

I?m having trouble building 4.3.1 on several systems where 4.2 built
without issue.  Is there a particular version of cmake that 4.3.1 needs
to be built with?

Ben,

Can you follow up with Rick please? These may be related to the
changes you made to Python in the superbuilds.

I?ve seen the QCLucene issue on isolated (SGI machines?) in the past.   I seem to now be seeing on every machine I?m trying to build on ?.

Rich,

I'd definitely stick with v4.3.1 checkout of the Superbuild. There
have been changed pushed to git/master since the release that don't
yet build on even our dashboards, so there's work that needs to be
done.

i.e.
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git
git checkout v4.3.1

Even if that doesnt' solve the QCLucene problem. Since you said that
was present in the past too, I somehow must have missed that it.
That'd need separate tracking down. Let me know if the Python/MPI
problems persist with the v4.3.1 version of the Superbuild. The
git/master is certainly broken -- Chuck, I am assuming you're looking
into fix the git/master version.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.3.1 is available for download

I reran ?ccmake? in the paraview build directory and changed python to
point to the one in the Paraview build rather than the system python, and
I now have a clean build.      So,  there are a couple of issues:

QCLucene ? why does it fail and require a manual ?make install? to complete
Python ? why isnt? cmake picking up python  from the build directory?
It seems to have ignored the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directive

As far as I know, these are ?new? issues.  I?m building on a generic RHEL5
workstation for the first build.  They get much more difficult on the HPC
systems.

FYI ? as I thought, manually running ?make install? allowed me to get
past the QCLucene errors as it has in the past.     Looks like I then
made it all of the way through to the paraview before it died with some
python class errors.    Looks like cmake
is picking up my system python instead of the one that I?m building as
part of the ParaView distro.   That?s new.     How do I get it to pick up
the Paraview/python not the system python?

errors before, but not on the platforms  that I?m currently testing the
builds on ?.  I believe that I get around
this by going into the qt build directory and running ?make install?
and the problem goes  away.

I?m having trouble building 4.3.1 on several systems where 4.2 built
without issue.  Is there a particular version of cmake that 4.3.1 needs
to be built with?

Subject: [Paraview] Visualising image data
Message-ID: <CAEc4V-aeRc08XymsKfNUwM75-wsd+e=tGsc_bMjqs+K9RY4sxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on a programmable filter that needs to produce a vtkImageData
object. So far it appears to work, inspection of the properties panel shows
the object has the correct number of points/cells and the data array
contains the correct data. However I cannot get a visualisation with any of
the representations (surface, outline, wireframe etc). Curiously, if i set
the display to my data array then the color bar appears with the correct
values, but still not visualization.

I am using the following code to produce the image data object.

from vtk import *

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0);

# Create a VTK Grid
grid = vtkImageData()
grid.SetOrigin(0, 0, 0) # default values
dx=10;
grid.SetSpacing(dx, dx, dx)
grid.SetDimensions(5, 8, 10) # number of points in each direction
# print grid.GetNumberOfPoints()
# print grid.GetNumberOfCells()
array = vtkDoubleArray()
array.SetNumberOfComponents(1) # this is 3 for a vector
array.SetNumberOfTuples(grid.GetNumberOfPoints())
for i in range(grid.GetNumberOfPoints()):
    if i < 200:
        array.SetValue(i, 1)
    else:
        array.SetValue(i, 2)

grid.GetPointData().AddArray(array)
# print grid.GetPointData().GetNumberOfArrays()
array.SetName("unit array")
output.ShallowCopy(grid);

Cheers,
Bruce

Announce the whole extent in the RequestInformation script section.
That should do the trick.

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting data to an existing model's surface
Message-ID: <CAFw8VoR=PX2pEkq1D3T99brpzOjQ4WQ9+wLXAbG3rPQRNic1yA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm a graduate student in geology trying to do some visual data work, but
I'm afraid my inexperience with paraview is making things a bit difficult
for me.

Essentially what I'm trying to create is a 3D model of a rock that has its
surface coloured to show spatial distribution of a physical property
associated with certain areas on the rock.

I was able to reproduce the rock I sample from using a 3D scanner but I
have no idea how to go about selecting particular areas of the rock's
surface, assigning a value to that "area", and having the program
interpolate between multiple "areas". Essentially I'd like this to produce
a color gradient showcasing the changing values.

Can anyone offer some guidance/direction? I had someone at my campus
suggest creating a .csv file with x,y,z coordinates of the particular areas
of the model of interest, but after doing that all I've produced are
"points"...not sure how to specify the association to the model and color
and interpolation, etc.

Thanks for any help,

- Mark

Thanks for the response David. Could you elaborate on this? I am not sure
how to do what you are suggesting.

Click the gear icon in properties tab to get RI script.
Then put this there:
executive = self.GetExecutive()

outInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)

outInfo.Set(executive.WHOLE_EXTENT(), 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 9)

Dear :
    Hello,
    I'm a fresh in paraview. Now I want to develop some my own filters , but I find that the source code of paraview is so complex and I can't find any methods to develop them in wiki and doucumention . I want to konw whether there are some interfaces for us to develop filters and there are some rules that we need to comply with . Can you tell me some methos to do this or tell me where to find it .
    Thank you !

No, it's not right. I've just checked PV 4.1.0 and it saves its camera 
settings permanently.

I figured that the vtk dynamic libraries of PV have the ending *-pv4.3.so which 
seems to be the reason why the linker does not find them. If I create symbolic 
links to these files without the extension:

cd /opt/compilation/paraview-git_build/lib/
for i in *-pv*.so; do ln -s $i ${i%-pv*}.so; done

and adding -L/opt/compilation/paraview-git_build/lib/ to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
the compilation of ITK succeeds.

I wonder, is that the way it's meant to be done?

Exporting selection labels as text ("Render text as paths" not checked) works 
for me with PV-4.1.0. However, PV-4.1.0 does not allow one to specify the 
formatting, like printf formats as: %.2f\circ.
PV-4.3.1 does allow one to specify the formatting, however whether "Render text 
as paths" is checked or not, the output SVG does not contain any text-tags any 
more, that would allow editing in inkscape or text setting by latex.

Did Your changes get lost/reverted?

I tried to find the commits that made it possible for PV-4.1 but could not find 
them in the git logs:
http://www.paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=gl2ps
It seems the bug number 14231 was never mentioned in the commit messages.

What is the general procedure to find the right commits in such a case?

Many thanks for looking into this.
Roman

I just noticed that the problem only occurs if a $ (as needed for latex math) is 
used in the format string, e.g. $%.2f^\circ$. If I remove the $ signs the text 
IS exported with text-tags.
Does the $ sign have a special meaning here in PV?

The commit that made the change is in VTK, not ParaView (the histories are
stored in separate repositories):

The issue here is that the MathText is not like regular text -- regular
text can go directly into the vector document with a reasonable expectation
that it will be rendered properly by the viewer. Some of the more complex
mathematical expressions MathText is capable of rendering cannot be encoded
as pure text in the document.

So any strings that contain MathText expressions (e.g. those containing a
pair of unescaped $ characters) will always be rendered as a path, since we
know that these will always come out correctly.

You can look at the Plugins directory. And maybe something simple like
${src}/Plugins/ForceTime/*.
The core of the filter should be like writing regular VTK filter. Then it
is just a matter to expose it to ParaView via some XML descriptor.

I concur.

Basically what you need to know is how to write VTK algorithms and much of
that involves familiarity with the vtkDataSet API. You need to be
comfortable with datasets in order to inspect the input and populate the
output of your filter.

There are resources and examples on the web to help get you started.
Chapters 16 and 17 of the VTK User's guide are also helpful, as are the
courses that Kitware offers.

happy coding!

Thank you all, guys!
I solved my problem. I'm able to plot the data now.
But, only one more question: is it possible to export this plot data to a
Excel file?
If it's possible, how do I do that?

Click on the filter in the pipeline and then go to save data.
Choose csv format, which excel will readily read.

Hi Roman,

Thanks for looking into the issue and reporting it to the mailing list.

Paraview should be installing VTKTargets.cmake, which tells the build
system where to find the libraries.  Note that there might be two
VTKTargets.cmake files that are generated -- one for the build tree
and one for the install tree.

HTH,
Matt

I was wondering if there was a tool that could average values from multiple nodes and plot that over time.  For example, I would like to take a selection of nodes, average their velocities, and plot that vs. time.

Thanks for the help.

Mark,
I don?t know the answer to your question, but a few years ago I wrote a wiki page on converting .csv file data into points and structured grids.  The write-up is here:  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Data_formats.  Hope that helps.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Plotting data to an existing model's surface

Hello all,

I'm a graduate student in geology trying to do some visual data work, but I'm afraid my inexperience with paraview is making things a bit difficult for me.

Essentially what I'm trying to create is a 3D model of a rock that has its surface coloured to show spatial distribution of a physical property associated with certain areas on the rock.

I was able to reproduce the rock I sample from using a 3D scanner but I have no idea how to go about selecting particular areas of the rock's surface, assigning a value to that "area", and having the program interpolate between multiple "areas". Essentially I'd like this to produce a color gradient showcasing the changing values.

Can anyone offer some guidance/direction? I had someone at my campus suggest creating a .csv file with x,y,z coordinates of the particular areas of the model of interest, but after doing that all I've produced are "points"...not sure how to specify the association to the model and color and interpolation, etc.

Thanks for any help,

- Mark

After you

1) get the list of points and values in the csv file:
x,y,z,val1,val2,?
2) read into paraview and converted from a table to a vtkpointset as Alan
suggested
3) try the vtkSurfaceReconstruction filter to convert it into a mesh.
That isn't exposed in ParaView (maybe not parallel aware) so use this
python programmable filter to do use it:

import vtk

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()


subf1 = vtk.vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter()

subf1.SetInputData(pdi)

subf2 = vtk.vtkContourFilter()

subf2.SetInputConnection(subf1.GetOutputPort())

subf2.SetValue(0, 0.0)

subf2.Update()


pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()

pdo.ShallowCopy(subf2.GetOutput())

ParaView will then happily interpolate values across the faces of the mesh

Subject: [Paraview] Replication and rotation of 45 degree wedges?
Message-ID: <88984e6d5c2d45d2ac679bdef58ecef6@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I have a 3D pie-wedge simulation which spans 45 degrees in angle. Is there a way to make 45 degree copies and rotate them in the angular direction in order to visualize the 360-deg view?

Thanks,

Alan

Subject: [Paraview] temporal threshold
Message-ID: <CAMYd9p-qVD57=RYMH5c1ih2FiW9P93ra0_=47pkFA2K_CQ1C_g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to apply a threshold to a temporal data set. I would like to see
which nodes reach a certain temperature over the whole simulation. At the
moment the threshold will only see one moment in time.

Maybe there a way to apply a temporal threshold? Such that the filter will
apply the scalar value for all timesteps?

the temporal statistics filter will show you the max/min/avg etc over all
time. Threshold that to identify the nodes of interest.

Thanks, I've run the temporal statistics filter on my data, however it
doesn't seem to be giving any data output.  It spends a while calculating,
but the output is just a solid color representation of my object. The
information tab also shows no data.

My input is an unstructured grid, with point data. Am I missing something?

Hi Matt,


Thank You very much for Your reply.
I can only find one VTKTargets.cmake in /opt/compilation/paraview-git_build/VTK/
It seems though that it is lacking the relevant entries for the libraries that 
troubled me, e.g. vtkPVPythonCatalyst and vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer.

I'm about to publish the ITK-VTK PV plugin in the Midas Journal, what 
installation instructions should I give there?
Will the testing environment be able to compile this plugin and its tests or 
should I disable automatic testing for this contribution?

Many thanks for looking into this.
Roman

Hi David,

Thanks for your suggestion. I was able to successfully render my points in
a .csv file into specific points on the model (thanks Alan!), but I'm not
sure how to go about the next steps into turning the points into a mesh and
thus interpolating.

Where can I input these python commands in paraview? I'm afraid my skills
in programming are minimal.

Thanks for your help,

- Mark

Strange, when choosing the defaults on the Temporal Statistics filter the
output should be a copy of the input with each attribute array replaced
with name_stddev, name_average, name_maximum, and name_minimum arrays.

Try it on the Source->Time Source to see how it should behave.

Filters->Programmable Filter

Copy and paste the text into the Script entry field then hit Apply.

vtkSurfaceReconstruction doesn't have the concave shape limitation that
Delaunay has - but it isn't a perfect mesh of the surface either. Perhaps
the vtk or paraview mailing lists contain a better alternative to either.

After using the Table To Points filter, you can use the Delaunay 3D filter that creates a tetrahedral meshing.

I guess you work with a convex portion of space, so this should induce problems.

Message-ID: <B93AB4DE-D6D7-4152-8458-339F58C69E99@tacc.utexas.edu>

Hello ParaView Users,

Please excuse the shameless plug, but I would like to remind everyone that the EGPGV full paper submission deadline is three weeks away.
If you have developed parallel techniques to perform your visualization, we invite your submission!

Please note that we also are featuring a new Visualization Showcase short papers track for state-of-the-art application of visualization techniques to interesting problems.
The deadline for this track is the end of February, so there is more time to get the video and short paper in perfect shape :-)

All best,

Paul Navratil
Texas Advanced Computing Center

=================================================================

                E G P G V   2015
Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization
       25 - 26 May, Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy

       *** EGPGV 2015 - Call for Papers ***

Welcome to the 15th EGPGV, the Eurographics Symposium on
Parallel Graphics and Visualization. The event will take place
on May 25 - 26 in Cagliari, island of Sardinia, Italy.
The Symposium will be held in conjunction with EuroVis 2015.

*** NOTE: there are two tracks for this year?s symposium, full papers
and visualization showcase short papers ***

The importance of parallel computing is increasing rapidly with the
ubiquitous availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems.
Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics
and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel
efficient parallel solutions. The aim of this symposium is to foster the
exchange of experiences and knowledge exploiting and defining new trends
in parallel graphics and visualization.

The proceedings of the EGPGV Symposium will be published in the
Eurographics Proceedings Series and in the Eurographics Digital Library.


Focusing on parallel computing, the symposium seeks papers on graphics
and visualization techniques, data structures, algorithms, and systems for:

 * large-data
 * clusters
 * (multi-)GPU computing, and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures
 * out-of-core
 * hybrid distributed and shared memory architectures
 * grid and cloud environments



In particular the symposium topics include:

 * computationally and data intensive rendering
 * scientific visualization (volume rendering, flow and tensor
   visualization)
 * information visualization and visual analytics
 * simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation,
   collision detection, acoustic)
 * mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
 * visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing
   and exploitation, segmentation)
 * scheduling, memory management and data coherence
 * large and high resolution displays, virtual environments
 * scientific, engineering, and industrial applications


Full papers are expected to be eight to ten (8-10) pages in length, with
the final length appropriate to the contribution of the paper. Papers
should be submitted using the Eurographics Conference style
<https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/PGV_2015/GetConferenceFile?fileID=6146> (https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/PGV_2015/GetConferenceFile?fileID=6146).
Please use this linked version, which contains the correct details for
EGPGV.

The expected schedule is as follows:

 * Full Paper Due: February 13, 2014
 * Author Notification: March 27, 2014
 * Camera-Ready Paper Due: April 8, 2014


The best paper will be invited to submit an extended version to IEEE
Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).


   Scientific Visualization Showcase

This year we present a new track for EGPGV 2015, which provides a forum
for the year's most instrumental movies in parallel graphics and
visualization. Finalists will compete for the Best Visualization Award,
and each finalist will present his or her movie during a dedicated
session at EGPGV ?15 in a 10-minute presentation. Movies are judged
based on how their movie illuminates science, by the quality of the
movie, and for innovations in the process used for creating the movie.

The accepted submissions will appear as short papers in the symposium
proceedings.

Review and selection process:
Submission should include ?Visualization Showcase:? at the beginning of
the paper title. Submissions needed to include a movie (up to 150MB in
size) and a short paper (up to 4 pages including references). The short
paper should describe the scientific story conveyed by the movie, how
the visualization helps scientific discovery, and the
"state-of-the-practice" information behind making the movie. The short
paper should be submitted using the Eurographics Conference style
<https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/PGV_2015/GetConferenceFile?fileID=6146> (https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/PGV_2015/GetConferenceFile?fileID=6146).
Please use this linked version, which contains the correct details for
EGPGV.

Each submission will be peer reviewed by the EGPGV Paper Chairs.
Criteria for revision include:

1. Compelling visualization
2. Visualizing data involving parallel graphics and/or visualization in
   a significant way (e.g., data size, parallel processing, parallel
   rendering)
3. Meaningful and compelling science story
4. Description of visualization techniques necessary to accomplish the
   movie


The expected schedule is as follows:

 * Showcase Submission Due: February 28, 2014
 * Author Notification: March 27, 2014
 * Camera-Ready Paper Due: April 8, 2014

Hi Roman,

Thanks for the update. Great to hear about the Midas Journal article!

I do not think the Midas Journal will be able to build your plugin.

I would recommend creating build instructions to build against a
ParaView build tree.  I have just verified that ITK builds with the
ITKVtkGlue module ON when pointing VTK_DIR to the <ParaView-build>/VTK
directory.

I don't see the install tree VTKTargets.cmake file in my ParaView
build, either. In the long term, the ParaView CMake configuration
should be corrected.

HTH,
Matt

PS. Another option is to compile / install VTK separately outside of
ParaView.  This may be a better approach.

It is a little tricky to configure ParaView in this way.  See:

  http://www.paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=blob;f=CMakeLists.txt;h=d80ff535090edc1fa9520d39aa66d269fc1db8b3;hb=HEAD#l516

Dave,
Not related to Tim?s issue below, but ? if I remember correctly ? the temporal statistics filter does not work in parallel.

Strange, when choosing the defaults on the Temporal Statistics filter the output should be a copy of the input with each attribute array replaced with name_stddev, name_average, name_maximum, and name_minimum arrays.

Try it on the Source->Time Source to see how it should behave.

Maybe there a way to apply a temporal threshold? Such that the filter will apply the scalar value for all timesteps?

It doesn't? I thought it worked in parallel but didn't work if the topology changed.

Dave,
Not related to Tim's issue below, but - if I remember correctly - the temporal statistics filter does not work in parallel.

Strange, when choosing the defaults on the Temporal Statistics filter the output should be a copy of the input with each attribute array replaced with name_stddev, name_average, name_maximum, and name_minimum arrays.

Try it on the Source->Time Source to see how it should behave.

Actually, I wrote Temporal Statistics filter. David T. co-wrote the descriptive statistics and host of other statistics filters that I believe operate on a single time slice. I also believe they all work in parallel except there is an issue with replicated points in parallel data that has never been resolved.

I am sure that at one point it worked in parallel, with the caveat that samples of points or point-data will over-represent values on process boundaries (because ParaView does not have knowledge of how many processes hold any given process-boundary point).

Err, and as I see Ken just mentioned, I only worked on the statistics filters that Temporal Statistics uses under the hood.

Hi all,

Thanks for your suggestions. I was able to follow the directions but I'm
afraid the outcome wasn't what I was looking for.

I am going to send out another email shortly that will hopefully better
explain what I currently have and what I want to achieve.

Subject: [Paraview] color mapping + interpolation of areas of a pre-existing
	model's surface.
Message-ID: <CAFw8VoS+_THAkVQkg7GSz=R6D-9o+euLmQ=g7RPgt2+AzZbLZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to develop a surface spatial distribution of data onto a
pre-existing 3D model. The model I currently have is composed of some 80K
polygons in mesh format (.obj file, captured via 3D scanner) and what I'm
trying to figure out is how to assign several areas of the mesh with values
(ie: isotopic data) and have the areas interpolate to cover the surface.

The images I've attached include the current model I am working on and the
approximate size and areas of where I'm sampling.

I'm wondering if instead of assigning scalars to each and every vertex of
the model, is it possible to assign scalars to groups of polygons and
interpolate this way? (that is, assign the "dots" in the "example" image
with values and have the "dots" interpolate amongst each other over the
surface of the model)?

Ideally, this would include much more than just 3 measurements but I am
trying to familiarize a general process of creating this before I receive
actual data.

If not, any guidance or suggestions to achieve the representation I want?

Thanks in advance for your help, I understand this may be a very unique
goal for Paraview.

- Mark

Mark,

I cannot think of any straightforward way to interpolate scalar values sparsely dispersed across a mesh.

I think a much more straightforward approach would be to use these dots in 3D space to define a function f(x,y,z) that interpolates values in all 3D space, and then use either the array calculator or the Python calculator to compute that value at each point.

Thanks, I see from Ken's comment that my problem is a changing topology.
Some of the nodes in the grid will become active over time... I've tried
sectioning away the regions that become active, but this didn't work... Is
there a better way to get around topology change for this filter?

There is no straightforward way of getting around changing topology.

One so-so way to solve the problem is to build a static topology and use the Resample With Dataset filter to apply the field values in the changing topology to the static topology. You should then be able to run the temporal statistics filter on the static topology.

I am sure that at one point it worked in parallel, with the caveat that samples of points or point-data will over-represent values on process boundaries (because ParaView does not have knowledge of how many processes hold any given process-boundary point).

Err, and as I see Ken just mentioned, I only worked on the statistics filters that Temporal Statistics uses under the hood.

Thanks Ken, I made a csv file from data of the first time step, imported
it, and used the Table to Points filter to create the static topology. The
Resample with Dataset filter and Temporal Statistics filter then worked
fine.

You can solve 3 Lapacians problem (one for each color component) to calculate the interpolation of the color.

Imagine that the red component of the color is like temperature. So you solve a problem with impose temperature on the sampling points to get the ? interpolated ? color in the rest of the domain.

Subject: [Paraview] particle surface based on position
Message-ID: <CAMYd9p8uM-MO8k61Wq0gR0BVs+BCjTV=Vppztip_7RuXtT3-wQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way for paraview to generate a surface based on point positions?

Viewing particle data as a surface, it just shows the points. One way I
have generated a "surface" is to use a contour by mass on nodal points. But
this is a bit iffy as changing the mass threshold will add or remove parts
of the surface.

Attached is an image for both of these. The contour looks okay, but
probably isn't the right way to go about it...

Subject: [Paraview] Scalar bar modifications
Message-ID: <54C8B6A9.20003@tu-braunschweig.de>

Hi all,

a colleague of mine is trying modify the scalar bar according to his 
preferences, and though he is almost there, there are two questions left 
open:

1. Is it possible to influence or remove the minor tick marks? He has 
not found any option to do that.

2. Why are the tick labels 'labels', whereas the min-max-values are 
'annotations'? The question arose, because he wanted to change the 
numerical format, which is no problem for the labels, but he had to set 
an explicit string for the min-max-values, which is not very convenient.

He is using Paraview 4.1.

Kind regards
Ian

OK, so I added a VTK test program. Is there a way to test if the automatic 
testing environment would be able to build and run my VTK test program BEFORE 
submitting the contribution to Midas?
(My last submission never got tested by the system so far, i.e. there is no 
colde review reported:
http://www.vtkjournal.org/browse/publication/949)

Did You use BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON for both ITK and ParaView? ITK also compiles 
fine without any errors for me if I use BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF, however the 
problems then arise when compiling the plugin.
If You like, You can test the compilation of the plugin with the code from the 
git repository:
https://github.com/romangrothausmann/FacetAnalyser

Many thanks for looking into this.
Roman

In ParaView 4.3, you can remove the tick marks (Draw Tick Marks) and the
minor tick marks (Draw Sub Tick Marks) in the color legend parameters
dialog. This was added recently, so it might not be in 4.1.

2. Why are the tick labels 'labels', whereas the min-max-values are
> 'annotations'? The question arose, because he wanted to change the

In 4.3, the min and max are in fact tick labels instead of annotations. You
can change the format of the min-max with the (Range Label Format setting.

I hope that helps.

Subject: [Paraview] Writer plugin?
Message-ID: <74D8CC62-B21B-454F-B299-CD6EFF258801@kitware.com>

Hi all,

I have a ParaView plugin that contains a new writer which I would like to expose. However, while the plugin does properly expose a new view and representation, the writer does not appear to get added (when I try to save a vtkTable such as a statistics filter output, it doesn't appear as an option).

1. Is there any documentation for adding writers in plugins? This page has a comment or two but doesn't appear complete:

    http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo

2. If you're willing to look over the XML, I've attached it below. See any mistakes?

	Thanks,
	David

I think you may be missing the FileName property. I thought that PV looked
for that attribute to know that it should be classified as a writer. Also,
you'll want to hide that property.

So:
      <StringVectorProperty name="FileName"
                            command="SetFileName"
                            number_of_elements="1"
                            label="File Name">
        <Documentation>
          The file name.
        </Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>


and:
      <Hints>
        <Property name="Input" show="0"/>
        <Property name="FileName" show="0"/>
        <WriterFactory extensions="json" file_description="JSON tabular
data" />
      </Hints>

However, while the plugin does properly expose a new view and representation, the writer does not appear to get added (when I try to save a vtkTable such as a statistics filter output, it doesn't appear as an option).

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting blocks from a large pvd file with Python
Message-ID: <AM2PR06MB0882C3DBBE3BAFBC830804ACD8330@AM2PR06MB0882.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

I am trying to use Python to extract all of the files in a pvd file with the Extract Block filter. This loop takes too much time (over a minute) for pvd files containing more than about 100 entries, and is unusable for any pvd files that are much bigger. I have run out of ideas to speed it up, and I don't know if there is a memory leak or other problem with my code, or if this is just a side effect of dealing with such large pvd files. Any help fixing or avoiding this problem would be greatly appreciated.

Here is the relevant code

                                inputFile = open(pvdFilePath)

                                lines = inputFile.readlines()

                                pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
                                view = GetRenderView()

                                i = 2 # Block Indices in PVDReader object begin at 2 and are incremented by 2.

                                for line in lines:

                                                words = line.split(" ")

                                                if words[0] == "<DataSet":           # Indicates this line references a .vtu file

                                                                name = words[1].split("\"")[1] # e.g. Returns 'NAME' from 'group="NAME"'

                                                                SetActiveSource(source)

                                                                ex = ExtractBlock()
                                                                ex.BlockIndices = [i]
                                                                i += 2

                                                                rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(ex, view)
                                                                pm.RegisterProxy("representations",name,rep)

                                                                RenameSource(name, ex)

                                                                del ex
                                                                del rep

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with update propagation through Double Input
 Programmable filter, in Animation mode
Message-ID: <CAD=br4wm2rvLgpZtfa4-UO5H9rVBWstohFa8yuTyJWC+AYApjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

Here is my configuration:

I have a programmable filter that has 2 inputs:
- a vtkPolyData, which is an Animation (loaded from a series of files)
- a vtkPolyData, which is static (loaded from 1 file)

The filter takes some parameters in the 2nd input (single file), to ceate a
transform, and applies it to the other input: the current frame of polyData
that is selected by the animation.
The output is a copy of this transformed polydata

The problem, it seems, is that the update doesn't propagate through the
programmable filter when I change the frame in the Animation.
The input varies, but the output of the filter doesn't. Also, I can tell
because my programmable filter normally outputs some text, and when I
change the frame, nothing is displayed on the output Window. THe filer is
executed once when I hit apply, but isn't when I change frames.

The weird part is that it has worked only once last week, and I haven't
been able to make it work again since. I've retried the exact same
configuration as when it worked, but it still fails.

I have tried it with a single input programmable filter, with the animation
polyData as input, and this polydata transformed as an output. In that case
it works fine, the update is propagated through the programmable filter,
and both input and output change when I change frames. This means that the
problem comes from the fact that it's a double input filter.

When it worked, it was on ParaView 4.2.0, and it didn't work after. I have
tried with the latest nightly of 4.3.1, and it has never worked on that
version.

Have anyone encountered this problem, or has any ideas on how to solve it ?

Thank you very much,


Matthieu Heitz

Dear Paraview community: Good day. I need assistance on visualizing a
matlab file? Any tips will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.


Details:
I need to visualize temperature distribution in a volume.  The volume is a
wedge-like slice of a hollow cylinder (shown in the attached schematic).

The calculations are made in MATLAB.  The three-dimensional matrices of the
solution (T) and the node-coordinates (X, Y and Z) are saved in a HDF5 file.

So far, I have not been able to make ParaView to visualize the result in
the actual geometry. They get the length, width and height of the volume
and simply build a cuboid out of them.

Thanks

My best, Mart?n

Subject: [Paraview] Super build Problem
Message-ID: <7B37CE47-6799-4D99-8904-33DA1E8153CE@lasp.colorado.edu>

I have posted this question once before, but everyone was probably busy with the 4.3.1 release? So here goes again.

I am trying to build the superbuild on the NCAR visualization cluster Caldera for development work.  I need to build 4.1.0, as I have not yet had time to update my tools to the most recent release.

When I attempt to build the superbuild, I get an error building Freetype (see below).

I have not been able to figure out what is causing the build error.

I am using the gnu/4.6.4 module, the cmake/3.0.2 module, and the gmake/4.1 module.

If anyone can help, that would be great.

Thanks,
Josh

You should probably write an XDMF file (
http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Main_Page) that describes the hdf5 file. Like
a "text" file or a "binary" file, "hdf5" files can contain anything, so the
XDMF file adds a bit of helpful context.

Here is a sample xdmf file that reads in three arrays from a named hdf5
file that define the cell connectivity. coordinates, and one scalar field.
The data in this case looks like a rubix cube of 27 hexes.

<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">

For such kind of data I typically write a custom made XDMF [1] file. 
XDMF is basically a XML wrapper that contains the description of the 
HDF5 data file.
What comes in handy in your cases, is that you have the heavy data 
already in a HDF5 file.

I typically write the XDMF file with a hand crafted python script since 
I typically deal with data sets from various source.
However, there is also a XDMF library [2,3], which should provide some 
convenient advantages.

The XDMF file format is very well supported by ParaView, or VisIt for 
that matter.

I attached 2 XDMF files, so you get an idea what I'm talking of (the 
HDF5 data files are missing though).

Hi Burlen,

> The WriterProxy may have a special "file_name_method" attribute that needs to be set. I'm not sure if that's required, optional, or long since obsolete since I haven't used our plugin in quite a while.

I did see the "file_name_method" (and "supports_parallel" and "parallel_only") attribute, but not all of the writers have it. When I add it, nothing happens.

	Thanks,
	David

Subject: [Paraview] Glyphs/Streamlines
Message-ID: <1422488962755.52852@kcl.ac.uk>

Hello Community,


I am trying to view a vector field (one vector at each vertex stored as 'Point Data') in Paraview 4.2.0 using the 'Glyph' filter. After application of the filter and using the Glyph Type 'Line' I tried to scale these lines (all vectors are unity vectors) in length and diameter, but I haven't found this property and think that this has been possible in older versions. Is this still possible in Paraview 4.2.0?


Beside that I was trying to create streamlines from my static vector field. I tried 'Stream Tracer', but that didn't display any result in my case. Can anybody give me a hint on how to start working on that since I have never been doing this, thanks.


Kind regards,

Quick suggestions:

1 Click the gear icon or use the search field to find the glyph scaling in
the advanced properties.
2 Apply the point to cell filter to spread the vector field throughout
space so that the the advection algorithm sees values to move by.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Seg Faults when running Animation in a
	Programmable Filter
Message-ID: <54C97E84.80003@geomechanica.com>

Hi,
I've been experiencing a very weird seg faults in various versions of
ParaView (4.1.x, 4.2.0, 4.3.x) when running an animation (streaming over
time) of my Programmable Filter. I'm not even sure this is a ParaView
issue, but I'll still share my story in case someone has any insights
that they can kindly share.

My Programmable Filter code works fine for the Current time step,
regardless at which time step I run it (i.e., hit the Apply button of
the Programmable Filter). However, when I hit the Play button to loop
over time steps (which appends some information to a CSV file), ParaView
seg faults after reaching the /3rd time step/. The filter has been
working for some time and this started to happen all of a sudden,
without any system update.

It may be related to a weird combination of hardware, software, and
drivers. My script works fine on a desktop computer I have but it seg
faults on my main workstation, which has an AMD/ATI Radeon R9 280x GPU
running on Linux Mint 15, 64-bit. When I completely removed the AMD
drivers, it still seg faulted but after reaching the /6th time step/
after the current one. Then, I launched an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit, live
on a USB flash drive. The script in Programmable Filter worked perfectly
fine. As a result, I installed the OS, but it acted up exactly as the
Linux Mint installation.

The input files are massive vtk unstructured grids (about 800 MB each).
I created smaller files, but unfortunately I couldn't reproduce the
error. But I'm fairly sure that the files are not corrupted. As such, I
can't send out the files that cause the issue. I also monitored the
memory usage using free -h command while Playing. Here's the output for
the "-/+ buffers/cache" line:

                         total       used       free
    -/+ buffers/cache:       7.2G       8.4G (Opening the .vtu files)

    -/+ buffers/cache:       7.0G       8.6G

As you can see, my system still had a lot of free memory when the seg
fault happened and I haven't done anything explicitly to limit memory
usage by a single process.

Looking at syslog, this is the error message for the seg fault:

    kernel: [77995.911073] paraview[22483]: segfault at 7f3c8e0398ac ip
    00007f3a47ebe169 sp 00007fff9106ab50 error 4 in
    fglrx_dri.so[7f3a479e9000+21e9000]


Am I missing something here? Is there any other debugging steps I should
take? Any insights or help will be hugely appreciated.

Thank you,
Omid

Alan, I'm a beginner user of paraview. I don't know if there is such tool,
but I think you can do that other way.
You can plot all the variables you want for each point and, then, export to
a csv file.
After you do that, you can manipulate the numbers the way you want, so you
can take all that values to a same sheet and average than.
With this average, you can plot using Excel or some other software.
I hope I've been clear enough.

I used to make my writers the same as filters and even allow them to shallow copy their input to the output. Then in paraview they can appear in the filters menu and can be inserted in the middle of a pipeline and each time a render is activated, the writer would be triggered. (I used it for saving particles out from animations of advected flows). (you can check if the timestep has changed or other stuff is different and skip writes if necessary).

Adding the writer as a filter is an easy option!

Subject: [Paraview] Writer plugin?

Hi all,

I have a ParaView plugin that contains a new writer which I would like to expose. However, while the plugin does properly expose a new view and representation, the writer does not appear to get added (when I try to save a vtkTable such as a statistics filter output, it doesn't appear as an option).

1. Is there any documentation for adding writers in plugins? This page has a comment or two but doesn't appear complete:

2. If you're willing to look over the XML, I've attached it below. See any mistakes?

What branch of the superbuild are you using? Are you using the 4.1.0 tag
in the repository?

At a guess, it looks like the targets are out-of-order since it looks
like output directories aren't being created? Is this a parallel or
serial build?

Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A8A0E8B9D@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi Paraview,

This is for a ParaView 3.14.1 plugin. I have an object panel gui with two dropdown menus for selecting scalars. I tried following the example from this older list thread:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview-developers/2011-February/000947.html


The menus show up correctly in the object panel, and are populated with the expected scalar names. However, only one of the scalars is getting placed into the inputVector because inside RequestData, The second call to GetInputArrayToProcess is returning null. I have

vtkDataArray* scalar1 = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0, inputVector);
vtkDataArray* scalar2 = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(1, inputVector);

scalar2 is 0x0.

I'm not very experienced with the GUI side of ParaView, so I feel like I'm missing something. I'm just writing a servermanager XML because the autogenerated layout is fine. Do I still need to do additional Qt code in order to grab that second scalar?

Thanks,
Mark

I just stumbled across this interesting blog:

If you have some kind of python knowledge, especially the "HDF5Reader" 
part should be very interesting for you.
For this you don't even need the XDMF files.

Hi John,

> Adding the writer as a filter is an easy option!

Thanks! Changing the ProxyGroup to "filters" and the WriterProxy element to a SourceProxy seems to have worked. I still want to understand why I can't expose it as a writer, but at least I can move on to the actual work.

Subject: [Paraview] .cube files in pvbatch
Message-ID: <059D8F98-73D2-4246-9B48-47E2EDE094D7@anl.gov>

Hi,

I am trying to render a gaussian cube file using pvbatch, and am not having much luck.  Using the GUI, I load a .cube file, and apply the contour filter to the Gridded Data portion of the file.  I can save the state as a pvsm and reload that state using the GUI, and things work as expected.  If I instead save as a python state file, and run pvbatch with that state file, the contour is not rendered.  I suspect that this has something to do with the fact that in the pipeline browser the cube file has two outputs (called Output and Gridded Data), and pvbatch is somehow applying the contour filter to the wrong one.  

I tried doing the following, which I thought should select output port 1 instead of output port 0, and indeed when I print them, I see different addresses, but the contour is still not being rendered.  Does anyone have any advice?

bk2_cube = GaussianCubeReader( guiName="bk2.cube", FileName='/sandbox/bk2.cube' )
print "bk2_cube: ", bk2_cube
cube_port1=servermanager.OutputPort(bk2_cube, 1)
print "cube_port1: ", cube_port1

Thanks,
joe

Your description is a bit vague to diagnose the issue. Can you share your
data set? I was able to use the Wavelet source, use the Slice filter and
then use the Gradient of Unstructured Data Set without any issues. Can you
see if that works for you?

Regards,
Andy

 Thank you for the answer.I think that the dimension of the .vtk file was too big. You can download the .vtk file from:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1wjo2brsaeu5ag/stability_realEigU_up0.vtk.tar.gz?dl=0

In which sense should I use the Slice filter? Sorry but I am quite new with paraview.Kind regards,Eleonora?      Il Venerd? 30 Gennaio 2015 11:16, Eleonora Piersanti <eleonorapiersanti at yahoo.it> ha scritto:

It looks like the Gradient of Unstructured Data Set filter isn't working
properly with quadratic triangles. Try using the Extract Surface filter
before computing gradients to convert them into linear triangles.

If you want to get more familiar with using ParaView, the ParaView tutorial
at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial is a good place to
start.

Andy

Alan,

Try selecting the points you want and then plot the selection over time. I think the current version of plot selection over time creates a series for the average value of the selection.

Subject: [Paraview] Memory use with Xdmf files
Message-ID: <CAEqXkzeGkN0dPopVrk3BzBP4rT9GPddQ2Fx_Y5+d9pFbW88xDA@mail.gmail.com>

I have written an Xdmf file that uses the 3D CoRectMesh to display a
montage of 54 gray scale images. They are laid out in a 9x6 fashion. Each
Image is about 1292x968 pixels. We have run stitching algorithms on the
images to find their correct coordinates in XYZ space so that they will
form the montage correctly.

The raw amount of memory is 67,535,424 bytes. If that has to be as RGBA for
rendering then it is 270,141,696 bytes.

Then ParaView has to create a "cell" for each pixel and then some other
stuff. At one point ParaView spiked to 120GB of RAM and then fell back to
about 36GB of RAM. This seems a bit excessive to me. This is with ParaView
4.3.1 on a Windows 8.1 workstation. Am I doing something wrong? Just seems
like a lot of memory.

Are their alternate ways of writing the Xdmf file so that each image is a
single cell perhaps?

Thanks for any insights.

I can make the data set available to anyone who needs it.

 It looks like the Gradient of Unstructured Data Set filter isn't working properly with quadratic triangles. Try using the Extract Surface filter before computing gradients to convert them into linear triangles.

If you want to get more familiar with using ParaView, the ParaView tutorial at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial is a good place to start.

Andy

I don't think that works.  Try the following:

select a few dozen points.  plot selection over time.  apply.
Notice that it only shows the first point.  Select multiple points.  (this now works).
You never get an average.

After a lot of debugging, it turns out the issue is with the SetCells
function of the vtk unstructured grid. Below are the bits of my
Programmable Filter code that are relevant to the seg fault:

    output  = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

    cellArray   = vtk.vtkCellArray()
    cellTypes   = []

    # Create a polygon to display the selected points
    polygon = vtk.vtkPolygon()
    polygon.GetPoints().DeepCopy(pointArray)
    polygon.GetPointIds().SetNumberOfIds(len(coordinates))
    for i in range(len(coordinates)):
      polygon.GetPointIds().SetId(i, coordinates[i][0])

    # Add the polygon to a list of Cells
    cellArray.InsertNextCell(polygon)
    cellTypes.append(vtk.VTK_POLYGON)

    # Get the cell containing a given cell & add it to the cellArray
    selectedCell  = input.GetCell(cellID)  
    cellArray.InsertNextCell(selectedCell)
    cellTypes.append(vtk.VTK_TETRA)

    # SetCells of the output with only the selected analyzed cells
    output.SetCells(cellTypes, cellArray)

The last line above seg faults on one of my computers but not on the
other one, both using Linux Mint 15 OS, and similar versions of
ParaView. Any thoughts?

Huh. I'm thinking of the behavior described in bug 0014940. When you make a query selection, you get statistics like average. When you make a surface selection (which is essentially an id selection) you get that first point. When you make a frustum selection, you get an error.

I would report this as a bug. I expect the plot selection over time to be consistent over all types of selection. And I would want the behavior to be as described in bug 0014945.

Unfortunately, the submission build system is currently opaque and
limited.  We have many thoughts on how to improve the journal
infrastructure but lack the funding to implement it :-(.

Looks like a great project!

I was using BUILD_SHARED_LIBS for both.  What issue were you seeing?

Again, I think the best approach is to build VTK separately, then
