Subject: [Paraview] Filter the array list in
Message-ID: <CAJrGgcOTWfj-sGmQxfPbCvv_gnBnuxg0PUTPc7Z24nHLDTZ4Lw@mail.gmail.com>

How should I filter the array list from xml?
I have the following:
<StringVectorProperty name="SelectInputScalars"
                            label="Array"
                            command="SetInputArrayToProcess"
                            number_of_elements="5"
                            element_types="0 0 0 0 2"
                            animateable="0">
        <ArrayListDomain name="array_list"
                         attribute_type="Scalars"
                         input_domain_name="input_array">
          <RequiredProperties>
            <Property name="Input"
                      function="Input" />
          </RequiredProperties>
        </ArrayListDomain>
        <FieldDataDomain name="field_list">
          <RequiredProperties>
            <Property name="Input"
                      function="Input" />
          </RequiredProperties>
        </FieldDataDomain>
      </StringVectorProperty>

For instance, obtained array list contains the following:
["nodegroups","temperature","speed","cellgroups"]

I need that this list contains only two elements
["nodegroups","cellgroups"].
Is it possible to do it on server manager xml level?

Hi Alexandre,

I'm glad it's working for you and thanks for letting other people know what
you did.

In my opinion I think that just having the adaptor produce a
vtkUnstructuredGrid is the way to go. Certain filters will only take in
vtkUnstructuredGrids and others will only take in vtkPolyData. You may be
forced to used different scripts for 3D simulations than 1D and 2D.

If you get some nice results with Catalyst, feel free to share them with
me. I'm always interested in what people are using Catalyst for.

Regards,
Andy

Can you give us some information on papers, reports, etc. that do that? I
haven't heard of any plans to do that yet.

Subject: [Paraview] Data updates in Paraview+MPI
Message-ID: <1417449831206.49260@masonlive.gmu.edu>

Dear all,

I am using the Paraview with MPI enabled to visualize a NetCDF dataset and need some suggestions on developing the following application.


If I want to modify the NetCDF array based on the data values from another numpy array (not in NetCDF format), do I need to store the numpy array in a NetCDF in every computing node with MPI installed?   The dimensions of the numpy array are not the same as the NetCDF array (e.g., numpy 2*2*2; NetCDF 4*4*4, one element from the numpy array corresponds to 8 elements in the NetCDF array ).


Also, the numpy array is updated during the interactive manipulation of the view.  Whenever the view changes (e.g., zoom), the values are updated.  If I store the numpy array as files, I am not sure how much communication overhead will be introduced. Is it possible to store the numpy array in memory and update the array on the fly? I'm not sure how the shared memory works in this case..


Any suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <d1e961f315ca3299a151788e617227d3@ssc.net.cn>

Hi All
I tried to install paraview web with apache as the front end and followed the information on http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/ubuntu_14_04
The web browser can open the index.html and when I tried to open localhost:8080/apps/pipeline, the client browser issues a warning "authentication error" and pipeline page closed automatically.

This sounds strange.
Though, I cannot reproduce this bug under Linux (ParaView 4.2.0, 
openSUSE 13.1 64bit).

However, I noticed that the XDMF file written by ParaView contains the 
absolute path to the HDF5 file, which makes the file not really "portable".

Probably this could be solved by using relative paths in the XDMF file?

There is actually an ancient bug-report concerning that topic:
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=4433

Hi Ying,

instead of pipeline, it should be Visualizer, but I've also noticed
something strange in your launcher config.

=>  "sessionURL" :  "ws://192.168.120.8:${port}/proxy?sessionId=${id}"

Why do you have ${port} here is you are using apache to forward the web
socket?

Another thing that you can do is remove all the [ "--authKey", "${secret}"
] inside the "cmd" sections.

Jing,

I'm having a little trouble conceptualizing exactly how you are planning to use it, but I suspect you are going to run into several problems because it sounds like you are breaking some of the assumptions of VTK and ParaView.

First, I'm not sure how you could attach an array describing 2x2x2 values to 4x4x4 blocks. There is no convention in VTK to specify a field arrangement other than 1 to 1. All filters will assume the array is 4x4x4, which will cause bad data access and could potentially crash ParaView.

Second, trying to modify an array interactively in the view and then access it through filters in the pipeline is not going to work very well. The pipeline will not catch the changes and the changed values will not appear in the visualization. ParaView additionally has update suppressors to prevent updates that were not modified by the ParaView system.

I suspect that for whatever it is you are trying to do to work right you will need to create a custom view or representation that internally handles this numpy array.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Data updates in Paraview+MPI


Dear all,

I am using the Paraview with MPI enabled to visualize a NetCDF dataset and need some suggestions on developing the following application.


If I want to modify the NetCDF array based on the data values from another numpy array (not in NetCDF format), do I need to store the numpy array in a NetCDF in every computing node with MPI installed?   The dimensions of the numpy array are not the same as the NetCDF array (e.g., numpy 2*2*2; NetCDF 4*4*4, one element from the numpy array corresponds to 8 elements in the NetCDF array ).


Also, the numpy array is updated during the interactive manipulation of the view.  Whenever the view changes (e.g., zoom), the values are updated.  If I store the numpy array as files, I am not sure how much communication overhead will be introduced. Is it possible to store the numpy array in memory and update the array on the fly? I'm not sure how the shared memory works in this case..


Any suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.


Jing

Hi Seb,

Thanks for the info. The client browser opens properly with "--authKey", 
"${secret}" removed.

=>  "sessionURL" :  "ws://192.168.120.8:${port}/proxy?sessionId=${id}"
${port} should be there otherwise  "pvpython pv_web_visualizer.py" is 
not issued.

Thanks!

Ying

we implemented vortex cores in paraview many years ago, but after searching I could not find the code
http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/peikert/SciVis/research/CTI-FinalReport.pdf
is the/one reference.

Filip Sadlo was the main author and might have a copy somewhere. I must have it in one of my archives of old code, but it would require some work to get going in a recent paraview as it probably worked with 3.x

Hi Ken,
Thanks for your prompt response. Sorry about the confusion here.
I have a large Netcdf file which is visualized with Parallel Paraview. Now I have no problems with visualizing the values of an attribute( e.g., temperature). The next step is to modify the attribute values based on the another numpy array storing the weighting values. The weighting values are changing during the interactive manipulation.

For  the first question, I think I can resample the numpy data to make the dimensions the same.  I noticed there is a calculator for array data but it seems only to work with data read through Netcdf reader from Paraview. I guess the less efficient way is to store the scaling array to the original Netcdf file and use the calculator to generate a new array based on both original and weighting arrays.   Do you think this will work? I don't want to "modify" the core API of Paraview.

Thanks again.

The point of using Apache as a front-end is to provide a single entry point
(just port 80 or 443 for https).
While the ${port} here will change for each running visualization process.

Message-ID: <EEF0C6662AEDE64D95ADE04A7F911B651FE8E19D@EXDAG0-A3.intra.cea.fr>

Hello,

I have a very simple temporal dataset, consisting of half a dozen  points with two fields : displacement and velocity.
I can animate the motion thanks to the WarpByVector filter (applied to the displacement field) : this shows the successive positions of the points.
Now I also want to display the trajectory of these points, that is the line joining all of their previous positions up to the current ones.

This seem to be quite basic, but I cannot find a way to do it (the ParticlePath filter seems to be the closest match, but it crashes Paraview with this kind of dataset).

If someone has ever had success doing this, please let me know.

Kind regards,

Jerome Cardolaccia

Is your data set a multiblock data set? If it is, you may need to have all
of the same point data fields ordered in the same way on each block. You
can use the pass arrays filter to get rid of all of the arrays that you
don't use if this is the case. Also, certain readers (the openFOAM reader
for example), has different arrays at the first time step than the others
and this can cause problems as well.

Can you share your data set? The particle paths filter can be a bit
finicky.

Subject: [Paraview] Data updates in Paraview+MPI
Message-ID: <D0A4E898.1EA2A%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Jing,

I'm still unclear about where this numpy array is being generated. Is it using the Python Shell in the GUI, running a Python script, or using a batch interpreter like pvpython or pvbatch? In that case, the numpy array is in a separate memory space as the data being loaded from the netCDF file (and has to be due to the distributed nature of parallel computers). There is a mechanism for pulling data to the Python script, but I doubt there is a way to push it back.

The calculator filter (as all other filters) has access to arrays that are either read from the netCDF file or generated in upstream filters. For example, the calculator filter will itself create an array that can be accessed by a second calculator if you add one to the first. So it is possible to add arrays after they are loaded.

One option you might try is to look into filters that internally use Python scripting. These are the Python Calculator and Programable Filter. Both of these will be able to access arrays from the netCDF file and then add arrays. If you can compute the values in the numpy array, then one or both of these should be able to add the data you want.

Hi Ken,
Thanks for your prompt response. Sorry about the confusion here.
I have a large Netcdf file which is visualized with Parallel Paraview. Now I have no problems with visualizing the values of an attribute( e.g., temperature). The next step is to modify the attribute values based on the another numpy array storing the weighting values. The weighting values are changing during the interactive manipulation.

For  the first question, I think I can resample the numpy data to make the dimensions the same.  I noticed there is a calculator for array data but it seems only to work with data read through Netcdf reader from Paraview. I guess the less efficient way is to store the scaling array to the original Netcdf file and use the calculator to generate a new array based on both original and weighting arrays.   Do you think this will work? I don't want to "modify" the core API of Paraview.

Thanks again.
Jing

Jing,

I'm having a little trouble conceptualizing exactly how you are planning to use it, but I suspect you are going to run into several problems because it sounds like you are breaking some of the assumptions of VTK and ParaView.

First, I'm not sure how you could attach an array describing 2x2x2 values to 4x4x4 blocks. There is no convention in VTK to specify a field arrangement other than 1 to 1. All filters will assume the array is 4x4x4, which will cause bad data access and could potentially crash ParaView.

Second, trying to modify an array interactively in the view and then access it through filters in the pipeline is not going to work very well. The pipeline will not catch the changes and the changed values will not appear in the visualization. ParaView additionally has update suppressors to prevent updates that were not modified by the ParaView system.

I suspect that for whatever it is you are trying to do to work right you will need to create a custom view or representation that internally handles this numpy array.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Data updates in Paraview+MPI


Dear all,

I am using the Paraview with MPI enabled to visualize a NetCDF dataset and need some suggestions on developing the following application.


If I want to modify the NetCDF array based on the data values from another numpy array (not in NetCDF format), do I need to store the numpy array in a NetCDF in every computing node with MPI installed?   The dimensions of the numpy array are not the same as the NetCDF array (e.g., numpy 2*2*2; NetCDF 4*4*4, one element from the numpy array corresponds to 8 elements in the NetCDF array ).


Also, the numpy array is updated during the interactive manipulation of the view.  Whenever the view changes (e.g., zoom), the values are updated.  If I store the numpy array as files, I am not sure how much communication overhead will be introduced. Is it possible to store the numpy array in memory and update the array on the fly? I'm not sure how the shared memory works in this case..


Any suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <4D78A5C3-8864-4033-8CBE-B12252EEDCAF@physik.uni-muenchen.de>

Hi,

Paraview is a great and handy tool. I am now trying to scale it to large data sets and have
a question related to the parallel capabilities of the Paraview-XDMF-Reader:

We use a PIC-Code that devides its grid into blocks distributed over the ranks.
For the output every rank writes exactly one HDF5, collecting all local blocks and all time steps.
One XDMF per rank was written describing the data, as well as a central XDMF including all the individual ones.

The hierarchy is 
	central-xdmf:  spatial_collection->includes_for_rank_xdmf_files
	rank_xdmf_files: temporal_collection->spatial_collectio_within_ranks->grids

The size of the simulation is about 1024 ranks and 256 time steps but should be increased.
For these parameters we see (via top) a memory consumption of 16GB per pvserver instance.
Directly after opening of the file, so even before "apply". 

I guess that this is because all the pvserver instances read and parse the XDMF file?
One time the paths to the HDF5 files were wrong, the memory consumption was the same.
After "apply" there was than an error.

I tried "PV_USE_TRANSMIT=1" and also changed the grid hierarchy to only have:
temporal_collection->spatial_collection->grids

This directly in one file, that was finally 1GB on disk and around 16GB in memory with lxml2 via python.

But it was to no effort, still every instance was consuming around 16GB

Is there any chance that pvserver can parallelize on the top-level so every pvserver instance only reads some of the "include" files.
Or is there a different approach to store the grid-patches (all the same resolution right now) in HDF5?

All suggestions are highly appreciated :-)

Thank you all very much for any support,
Best regards

Hello,
Thank you for your answer.
It WAS a multiblock dataset, but as you mentioned it as a potential issue, I made it even simpler : one temporal dataset with a unique block of 8 points and 2 fields (displacement=DEPL and velocity=VITE). No more success for me, the ParticlePath filter proves to be highly unstable (version 4.2.0 on Linux 64 bits).
You will find my data in the attached tarball.
Regards,
Jerome

Is your data set a multiblock data set? If it is, you may need to have all of the same point data fields ordered in the same way on each block. You can use the pass arrays filter to get rid of all of the arrays that you don't use if this is the case. Also, certain readers (the openFOAM reader for example), has different arrays at the first time step than the others and this can cause problems as well.

Can you share your data set? The particle paths filter can be a bit finicky.

This seem to be quite basic, but I cannot find a way to do it (the ParticlePath filter seems to be the closest match, but it crashes Paraview with this kind of dataset).

If someone has ever had success doing this, please let me know.

Subject: [Paraview] question about Principal Component Analysis (extracting

Message-ID: <CABzPro0_r5GSwmiUAgMFAo3CvWhOJhRg3wKKv7MS4aQ-puw77w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using Paraview's Stats filter to run Principal Component Analysis on a
3D mesh (converted to a point cloud).  My problem is that I'd like to get
the transformation matrix and I have been unable to figure out where it's
located.  More specifically,  I want to supply this transform (as a 4x4
matrix) to a VTK application.

I'm assuming that it's embedded in a 10 row table labelled Stats   (Block
#, Column, Entries, RowID, RowID)?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Marshall

I was wondering if there was a way to use the traditional scientific 
notation (1x10^16) instead of the E notation (1E16) in the axis labels 
(for example in a simple XY plot). I see there are three formats Mixed, 
Scientific and Fixed that Paraview allows but a lot of journals do not 
accept the E notation which according to Paraview is the Scientific 
notation.

The switch is very well hidden... too well in my opinion.

In the properties panel, you have to toggle the advanced properties (the 
gear button), the parallel projection checkbox will appear then at the 
bottom of the panel.

You can also just search what you are looking for in the search box of the
property panel.
If so, you could have found it without toggling the advanced option and
just by typing "par" in that search box.

Hope that help to find other hidden/advanced options.

Hi all?
      I connected the client to the pvserver mpi job to test if paraview was using all the nodes. I opened Memory inspector, I saw there were many processors' information.Then I used the Process Id scalars filter, there was only one color. After I used  D3 filter I can see many colors, but pvserver occupied much more memory.
      What can I do to make paraview distribute data to different nodes at the time I load the data, without using D3 filter?
      If I have 4 nodes with 2G memory, is it posssible for me to process 6G data?


?

Cool, didn't realize that the search also find advanced settings. :)

Is there a way to set parallel project as default?

Up to 4.1 this could be done in Edit->View Settings->General, but that 
option somehow got lost in 4.2 (or at least I couldn't find it by using 
the search in Edit->Settings).

I have a unsteady 2D contour plot of a flow past a cylinder. Is it possible
to plot the streaklines of a flow using Paraview? My solution file only
contains the following data:
U,V,W velocity and Pressure.

Andy,
Mind giving me an example of how to run this streakline filter?  I have never used it before.

Thanks!

Yes, I have seen that. It happened just after we completed the update to
1.8.13.


Any chances of just jumping to that version?

Just a guess: It would take a while to update again, unless there is a

Compelling? No, But it just means that you are one version back already. Out of curiosity, what all is involved in bringing in HDF5?

Diff will give you the details: mainly integrate the library into
vtk,paraview build system and fixing any issues on platforms an external
library was not tested on (but VTK/ParaView is)

Hi Greg,

I tracked down the problem. It is this line:

133 sgrid->SetDimensions(count[0], count[1], count[2]);

This is equivalent to

sgrid->SetExtent(0, count[0]-1, 0, count[1]-1, 0, count[2]-1);

which overwrites the earlier SetExtent() call.

If you get rid of it, it should work fine.

Best,

to get the update extent from the pipeline and set it onto the structured grid..  It then stuffs points and data to create a grid from -1 to 1 in each axis.

When I run it on 2 processes, the result *looks* right, it fills the -1 to 1 space along each axis, there are the right number of cells and points, ProcessIdScalars shows two equal size partitions, but the extent is clearly not right - the wireframe and surface surface boundaries are incomplete and the extent shown in the Information tab is correct for only one of the two parts.

So, what am I doing wrong?

I had forgotten, but just got reminded by Utkarsh.  ParaView 4.2 has a really sweet feature - you can save any state in the Properties Panel as default.  You go it by group.

With regards to parallel projection, Properties Panel/ Advanced/ Camera Parallel Projection on.  You will notice this is under the sub header (or whatever you call it) of "View (Render View)" .  On the right side of this button (which allows Render View to be minimized/ maximized), are two buttons.  One is restore default settings, one is save settings as default.  Click on save settings as default.

Alan

p.s. - Utkarsh, I just tested this functionality and it worked just fine.

Cool, didn't realize that the search also find advanced settings. :)

Is there a way to set parallel project as default?

Up to 4.1 this could be done in Edit->View Settings->General, but that option somehow got lost in 4.2 (or at least I couldn't find it by using the search in Edit->Settings).

Subject: [Paraview] Bugs with pvti and pvd

Message-ID: <CAE32kpXpP3x0NTKh-WwEmJ9BhgdFCoVxt7jCN4tr7Yz4Qn19NQ@mail.gmail.com>

This is a very interesting bug. First the quick fix: uncheck vtkGhostLevels
for cells and points when loading the dataset.

Here is the explanation:

The pvti writer writes all inputs cells including the ghost ones. So, if
you look at the resulting vti files, there is an overlap. When the pvti
reader reads these files, it makes a decision to pick the overlapping cells
from one of the files - since they are ghosts, they should be identical and
it should not matter which one. Well it does matter because if it loads a
cell from a piece that marks it as ghost instead of the one that does not,
it will only have a ghost copy of the data in the output. Which is thrown
out by the geometry filter before rendering.

The issue with the unstructured grid is actually different. It seems like
there is a bug in the code where the ghost values are calculate for points.
It seems to be marking some of the outer boundary points as ghosts. The fix
for that is to not load vtkGhostLevels for points.

Both of these problems show up when you are writing the data after applying
a filter that causes the reader to generate ghost levels (the contour
filter probably). Which is why this was not caught earlier. Thank you for
reporting it.

I will work on a fix and a set of tests, hopefully for 4.3.

Best,
-berk

Thanks a lot for the hints, I got my defaults properly set now!

One has to get used to the new search/settings/defaults thing, but it 
works really nicely after all.

I probably should have read the blog posts before I switched to ParaView 
4.2. :)

I'ld use something like the PythonCalculator to pass through a renamed copy
of the original array.
Once the copy is renamed, paraview will let you color and otherwise treat
it independently from the input array that it is a copy of.

You can probably get away with a shallow copy of the array contents too.
Then the only cost will be a few bytes for the new container data
structures. I'ld start going about doing that at the VTK API level in the
python programmable filter.

What file format is this data in? Not all file format readers are able to
split apart their input. Try saving out the results of the D3 filter into
an exodus file, quitting paraview and then starting it up again and loading
the data back in.

8G total for 6G seems a bit tight, but it _might_ be possible. It depends a
lot on what the data format is and what you want to do with it. Some
operations are more memory thrifty than others. There are a helpful
suggestions and guidelines in the ParaView tutorial and book sections.

Subject: [Paraview] Best way to handle KML data in ParaView
Message-ID: <ECC0198A97CCBA4BB64188582518F55437BADF97@XMBVAG72.northgrum.com>

Hello,

I have a KML file that defines the trajectory of a balloon as it ascends through the atmosphere and eventually descents back to the ground.  It's encoded with the latitude and longitude coordinates at various points along the way.  It also contains time stamps for each latitude, longitude location.  I have a NetCDF file that contains wind data that I've already been able to load into ParaView.   I'd like to visualize the balloon's trajectory as it passes through the wind data set, if possible.

What is the best way to get the KML information into ParaView?  I'm running on Linux and/or OSX (whatever works best!).  Perhaps the conversion process is a multistage operation (KML -> Shapefile -> ???), that's OK.  If anyone could just tell me the tools and the file formats used, that would be great.

Thank you very much for your time,
-Mike

Subject: [Paraview] Mixed Formulation FEM in Paraview
Message-ID: <CAOX0pDf9e9E2Q_EmobK3W5Y_AQkqMOKJMhH5P_u--7jWLHMRRw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to ask if it is possible to display scalar, vector or tensor
values at distinct nodes in a finite element mesh.

To make things clearer, there exist finite element formulations where not
all nodes have the same number of degrees of freedom. Consider the case of
a 20 node hexahedral element. In a so called u-p formulation all 20 nodes
have 3 displacement degrees of freedom (one for each x, y, z axis) but only
the 8 corner nodes have pressure degrees of freedom.

For this particular case, i know how to display the vector of displacements
for all the nodes. But since only the corner nodes of each hexahedron have
pressure degrees of freedom how can I instruct paraview to 'see' that only
these nodes have the pressure scalar values and make the correct color
interpolation?

Thank you very much.

Hi,

Currently ParaView assumes that all field variables have the same
interpolation/shape functions for point data. You would have to either
throw out the higher order interpolation/shape functions or compute the
dofs for them for the lower order field approximation.

Regards,
Andy

Dear ParaView people,

I'm trying to make a periodic but non-symmetric color map. I tried the 
attached xml definition, but it seems that between red and magenta, 
ParaView interpolates "in the other direction", see attached png 
screenshot. Is that the expected behavior? Is there a way to interpolate 
differently? Thanks!

Hello,

I have been successfully using pvbatch to generate animated image
sequences of state files created with the ParaView GUI.  However,
I am not able to begin an animation in the middle -- which I
desperately need to do in order to parallelize my renderings.

I mentioned this before in July (and again in person at SC'14),
but haven't yet reached a solution.

The documentation for the WriteAnimation() method in "simple.py"
indicates that this is possible, but fails in two ways.

1) The WriteAnimation() method doesn't actually implement the two
most important parameters needed: SetStartFileCount() and
SetPlaybackTimeWindow().

2) Even doing the operation manually, SetPlaybackTimeWindow()
affects the time of time-varying data, but does not affect the
time of animation cues such as the cameras!  or translation
values, etc used to move objects around.

I've also experimented a lot with setting various values of the
GetAnimationScene() -- such as: StartTime, Duration (which seems
to have no affect whatsoever), and AnimationTime.


I created a tar file with an example state file and batch rendering
script:
	http://www.freevr.org/Downloads/pvanimationtest.tar.gz

The scene has three time-varying elements:
	* Annotated Time -- works
	* Time-varying data (meshes of digits 0-9) -- works
	* An arrow moving through a sphere -- fails

NOTE: camera moves also fail, basically in the same way as the
arrow.

So how the arrow fails is that even when I begin the animation
process in the middle, the arrow (and any camera moves) always
start as though it were the first frame.  By the time it gets
to animation-time 5.0, the arrow should be through the sphere,
but instead it appears to the left.


To run a test, just do:
	% pvbatch 3Drender.py

This will print out some information, and may print warnings about
bad interpolation -- these are fine because it's a result of the
interpolating between polygonal objects (the digits) that aren't
intended to be morphed.  The effect is sufficient that it works
to tell me that data-time is working.

Newly rendered frames go into the "Frames" directory.  There are
other directories of the form "Frames-exN", which are various
experiments I've run to figure out the problem.

The state file that I am using is "arrowspheredatai.pvsm" (which is
loaded in the Python script).


This is a most desperate hour.

Please help me O PV wizards, you are my only hope.

	Thanks in abundance,
	Bill

You need to change your color space to "RGB". In the GUI, there is a combo box labeled Color Space that you probably have set to "HSV". Change that to "RGB". Alternately, in your xml file change the space attribute in the ColorMap tag to "RGB".

Hi,

The streakline filter requires a time dependent input as well as a vector
field input (probably point data required but didn't verify this). After
that, an input needs to be created for the seeds of the streaklines (i.e.
the location that the streaklines go through). Select the time dependent
input and then create the StreakLine filter. Then a dialog box will come up
to set the seed source (Input should be set to the time dependent input and
Seed Source should be set to the source to use for the streaklines). The
seeds are the points in the Seed Source. Next, in the Properties panel
you'll probably want to set Termination Time to something other than 0.0
since the streakline filter will integrate forward in time to that value.
Thus, if it's 0.0 and the first time step is at 0.0 it will seem like the
filter didnt' do anything. The Force Reinjection Every NSteps is
essentially the resolution of the streakline.

Note that PV's implementation of streaklines only does forward integration
in time.

Regards,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] animate parameter for python programmable filter
Message-ID: <CAJAZx5DxVLOLATueyJTzrE1z_pdJcwv=oAhoxanEObOohd7NMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to animate a parameter with a python programmable filter using
keyframes. In this simple example, I just want to rescale a scalar variable
by a constant factor (alpha). But I want to animate this factor. Here is my
filter:

from paraview.vtk import dataset_adapter as DA
self.SetParameter('alpha', 0.1)
pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
pdo.CopyAttributes(pdi)
d = alpha * inputs[0].PointData['temperature']
arr = DA.numpyTovtkDataArray(d, 'temperature_scaled')
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(arr)

This script works, but I can't set alpha using keyframes. It just doesn't
show up in the animation view.

Perhaps I have understood what the whole "SetParameter" framework does.
What is the point of setting these parameters if they can't be modified
from outside the filter?

Thanks in advance for your help.

-Ryan

Message-ID: <9700A92FD044934E8E64B214D8B0F38C2677242EF3@MAILBOX1.nrel.gov>

Hello,

I seem to have the same problem as Mr. Pastorelli:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2014-February/030582.html
Has this been resolved?

We are running Immersive ParaView 4.2.0 (custom build) on RHEL6.5 machine for both server and client. I can use the vrpn interface for tracking, though translating the model view matrix causes flickering rotations (that's a problem for another day). Due to our need for two vrpn ports (similar to the above exchange), I am trying to use Vrui's VRDeviceDaemon to pass the tracking data to ParaView. When I hit "Start", the program siezes. On the VRDeviceDaemon terminal, the last lines are:

VRDeviceServer: Connecting new client from localhost, port 60884
VRDeviceServer: Waiting for client connection

Killing the process results in a plethora of these errors to the ParaView server terminal:

ERROR: In /opt/ParaView/dist/ParaView-v4.2.0/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx, line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x13f9730): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.

The same thing happens with Vrui 3.1-002 and 2.6-001. I can run "Vrui/bin/DeviceTest -t 0 localhost:3883" to see that the tracking data does indeed exist.

The relevant section of my state file is:

  <VRConnectionManager>
    <VRUIConnection name="vrconn" address="localhost" port="3883">
      <Tracker id="0" name="head"/>
      <TrackerTransform value="-1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 "/>
    </VRUIConnection>
  </VRConnectionManager>
  <VRInteractorStyles>
    <Style class="vtkVRTrackStyle" proxyName="RenderView1" proxy="3559" property="EyeTransformMatrix">
      <Tracker role="Tracker" name="vrconn.head"/>
    </Style>
  </VRInteractorStyles>

Any idea how I can get Vrui tracking to work with ParaView?

Dear Utkarsh,


Just yesterday I stumbled over vtkImplicitTextureCoords. Could that be used to 
achieve my initial idea, ie to avoid the paraview clipper for clipping images 
"roughly"? I managed to create an xml-file that loads as a filter-plugin in 
paraview but after execution, there seems to be no texture available to use for 
rendering. I'm not sure if using ProxyProperty, ProxyGroupDomain and 
ProxyListDomain is doing the same for a filter instead of a source as in Your 
original XML. Are those tags the same as InputProperty, DataTypeDomain otherwise 
used for the input of a filter-plugin?
If that is correct, what else could I be missing?

Many thanks for looking into this.

Dear Utkarsh,


Finally, after visiting the paraview workshop in Lyon, I got my own paraview 
plugin based on c++ for this old task to compile and link. However, already when 
loading it as a module in paraview, paraview crashes with a symbol lookup error:

/opt/paraview-4.1.0_debug/bin/paraview
/opt/paraview-4.1.0_debug/lib/paraview-4.1/paraview: symbol lookup error: 
/net/home/grothama/vtk/paraview_plugins/image-clipper/build/libmyImageClipper.so: undefined 
symbol: _Z19myImageClipper_InitP26vtkClientServerInterpreter

What could be the problem for this? How can I debug this problem?
I tried to combine things from 
ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Default/vtkPVMetaSliceDataSet.cxx and from Your XML 
to use a vtkImplicitFunction as an input to a filter.  I had to copy

cp ParaView-v4.1.0/VTK/Imaging/Stencil/*.h 
ParaView-v4.1.0/build_141124/VTK/Imaging/Stencil/

and to add
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS   -I ParaView-v4.1.0/build_141124/VTK/Imaging/Stencil/

for vtkImplicitFunctionToImageStencil.h to be found by cmake. However, the error 
does not seem to be caused by the stencil stuff. Attached are the files.

Thanks for any help or hints
Roman

Hi Ian,
I have the following patch that fixes the EnSightReader for the files you
sent to Utkarsh. Would you mind trying it out? If you have other files you
can try it on, please do so.

You'll have to build ParaView from the repository:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Git

And then apply this patch in ParaView/VTK

git apply --stat ensight.patch


Thanks,
Dan

With a single balloon I expect that you can convert it to a comma separated
values text file and then load that in. You will have to do the lat/lon ->
x/y conversion as well perhaps in the python calculator.

Is there a representative file you can share with the list?

The problem stems because ParaView doesn't enable the
vtkImagingStencil by default. In your ParaView build, turn on
Module_vtkImagingStencil CMake flag and then rebuild ParaView and your
plugin.

Roman,

Let's take a few steps back. To make sure the end goal is still
unchanged: you want a way to clip an image dataset using an arbitrary
clip plane (not necessarily axis aligned) and then volume render it.
If you use the Clip fliter, the resulting unstructured grid becomes
too large and hence takes a lot of time to volume render. Is that
correct?

BTW, if you want to just clip using axis-aligned clip plane, you
should just use the "Extract Subset" filter.

What does the plot over intersection curves plot do?  Plot the boundary around the slice where a plane intersects a dataset?  OK, Next, what does the Sphere slice type do?

An example is Sources/ Wavelet, Apply.  Plot over intersection curves.  Slice type Sphere.  Radius 12.  Apply.  What does this represent?

Try the attached patch. I believe you need to set two things: the

Message-ID: <CA+_3LfMr6N5=ByZrk60ZRBby+tQP3bd-0MJJQ3WCBUEab1zBwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to write my particles positions and their velocities in vtu
format. However, when I load my data in paraview, it gives me the following
error:

ERROR: In
/Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release-Python27/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/XML/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx,
line 434

vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0x7ff4adfbcbc0): Cannot read point data array
"Velocity" from PointData in piece 0. The data array in the element may be
too short.


I read in another post that changing Float32 to Float64 might help, but it
did not. Any help will be appreciated. Also, I can send my cpp code.


Thanks,

Payman

Dear Utkarsh,

Yes, if possible any kind of implicit function.

Not only the rendering takes a long time but even the execution of the filter 
itself, and its precision on cutting voxels is not at all needed for a volume of 
around 1500x1500x1500 voxels. Basically I just want to make voxels 
inside/outside the implicit function be "invisible".
What's the best way to achieve that?

Many thanks for Your help.

Hi,

     I downloaded the Paraview 4.2 DMG and installed it on OS X Yosemite.

     I renamed the *.app directory to include a version in the directory 
to allow concurrent installation of future versions.

     When I attempt to launch it, it says that the app is not signed via 
the Mac App store.

Cheers

Hello,

I meet a problem when running paraview and hope to get some help from you.

After I write paraview in the terminal, paraview could not open. And the 
terminal shows:

That's expected. ParaView app isn't signed. Right-click on the app and
then select Open from the context menu. That'll get around this.

Seems to me your data file is invalid. If you can share your data file
someone may be able to provide more clues as to what's missing.

Message-ID: <CABX6FTxmyrOiqz1Va9aQfgJmsnOa3_55UsfAka3nzbw+ntqj9A@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,
I'm a new user of software ParaView and I have some problem.
Everytime I try to create a selection using the option "Find Data" the
software returns this error message:

"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 8, in <module>

TypeError: CreateDataArray argument 1: an integer is required"

I'm trying to locate the residual stress in the cells in a mesh of a welded
plate.

I would like to know how to solve this problem.

Thanks for your attention,

This is a know bug on Windows. I'd suggest using the nightly binaries
for now. The issue will be fixed in the upcoming 4.3 release.

Hi Andy,

I followed your instructions and have had some success but not completely :)

Here is what I did:
1) My input data has a time-dependent X velocity and a Y velocity and the
mesh information
2) I use the "Calculator" tool to create a "velocity" vector using
"x_velocity*iHat + y_velocity*jHat"
3) With "Calculator1" active, I click on Streakline (Streakline filter
doesn't show up with my initial data as, I guess, there are no vector
fields there)
4) A pop-up window comes: for both the "Input" and "Seed Source" I choose
"Calculator1"
5) Then "Streakline1" appears in the pipeline. I change Termination time to
a non zero value. With the "Calculator1" and "Streakline1" "eye" activated
in the pipeline, I click on the play button
6) I don't see any streaklines. Only the velocity contour movie continue
(and much slowly than it does without the streakline filter on).
7) I don't see the option of where can I decide the point of origin of the
streaklines.

Any sugggestions?
Thanks
Pradeep

Okay yes, that patch works!  Thank you.  I would perhaps point out
in the documentation that the values for PlaybackTimeWindow are
designated in the time reference of the data -- not the render time,
nor the normalized animation time.

	Thanks again,

Subject: [Paraview] Multi-block Inspector - unexpected result
Message-ID: <CACXVUXG5CYFpnFiDLxOFBqsnEuJrcEG1hVOSxu=5hfyzgBKTgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

When using the Multi-block Inspector I see behavior that I don't expect.
After setting colors and opacity for individual blocks, if the model is
then colored by a nodal scalar variable the solid colors persist. This
isn't what happens if I add an extract block filter for each block. It
gives weird effects if opacity is less than 1 in a block, where other
blocks (not transparent) viewed through the transparent block are rendered
by the scalar variable, but if viewed directly are rendered in the
prescribed solid color.

Is this a expected?

I'm using the latest stable 4.2 on Windows 7 x64, with an EnSight Gold
format reader.

Thanks, Bob

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter,
	looping over time steps and reimporting inputs
Message-ID: <5490AE69.3030506@geomechanica.com>

Hi,
I'm writing a python script for the Programmable Filter of ParaView to
do some analysis on my simulation results. The simulations results are
transient and hence the analysis has to be done over time steps (perhaps
similar to integrate over time filter). All bits of my script are
working fine. However, after spending a considerable amount of time on
fiddling with the script, googling, reading mailing lists and the VTK
documentation, I haven't found a way to "loop over time steps AND update
the input" from within the script. I can loop over time steps using:

    from vtk import vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline
    for time in outInfo.Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.TIME_STEPS()):
        #Perform some analysis, for instance subtracting value_v for
    this time from value_v at time zero...

However, the input data is still from the time step where I first
applied the script. Of course, when I animate the results, the inputs
will be updated, but I will need to achieve the same results from within
my script in the Programmable Filter dialogue.

How can I update the inputs from within my for loop or how can I modify
the for loop or my script to achieve that? Can Programmable Filter
handle my situation? If not, what is the alternative?

Many thanks,
Omid

Hi,
I recently switched from Paraview 4.1.0 to 4.2.0, both 64-bit under
ubuntu. I noticed that when I select Cells and/or Points and view their
IDs, they are assigned arbitrary numbers. You can visualize the attached
file (cube.zip, zipped to save space) and select the giant tetrahedron
on the top (along Y) to see the problem. I'm also attaching such
screenshots from both versions.

Am I missing something? Or should I modify my VTP/VTU files for PV4.2?

Thanks,

Omid,
I am pretty sure that is a bug that has been found and fixed.  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15137.    Either wait for the next release (due out RSN (Real Soon Now), maybe January), or try one of the nightly builds off of the ParaView website.

Hi,
I recently switched from Paraview 4.1.0 to 4.2.0, both 64-bit under ubuntu. I noticed that when I select Cells and/or Points and view their IDs, they are assigned arbitrary numbers. You can visualize the attached file (cube.zip, zipped to save space) and select the giant tetrahedron on the top (along Y) to see the problem. I'm also attaching such screenshots from both versions.

Alternatively, you can manually change the "Point Label Format" or "Cell
Label Format" from the "Selection Display Inspector" (you'll need to click
the gear to pop up the dialog to edit advanced selection  display
properties).

Hello everybody,

I would like to know if is it possible to perform a this special computation by using paraview:

Actually I'm using paraviewgeo, I loaded a .vo file. I would like to count the vertical cell and 
write the result in ascii file (x, y, value) (2D).
Is it possible?

Kind regards

Utkarsh,
Thank you again.
But, there's a problem. There are no yellow boxes in "Nightly Binaries"
section, so I can't donload it.
Is there some other way to do this?

Subject: [Paraview] How to get the name of a block in a programmable filter
Message-ID: <CAJ-2Sz2auVVv1jOE2T4sieR5ktKuwAPH6xT3ixMO6dREdEJCdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to define a custom programmable filter to work with
MultiBlockDatasets. In that filter, I need to access to the name of each
block being processed. By "name", I mean the information given in the
"Information>Data Hierarchy" tree.

Could you explain me how to access to that information in a programmable
filter?

Fort information, here is a code example of what I would like to do:

[code]
from    paraview.vtk import dataset_adapter as DA

input   = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

def process_block(input_block, output_block) :

    data = input_block.PointData['data']
    if data is None :
        print 'data is None'

    else :
        # <<<< get the name of input_block >>>>
        print 'do something with data'


iter = DA.MultiCompositeDataIterator([input, output])
for input_block, output_block in iter:
    process_block(input_block, output_block)

[/code]

Pedro,

Try the "Super-Build (master)" section (not the Nightly Binaries). Also if
try the previous day, if the current day builds haven't been built yet.

In the "Series Parameters" section, you can click on the series you want to
change the properties for and then use the combo-boxes under it to change
the "marker style" and "line styles".

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview/Load File and Take Screenshot
Message-ID: <1419001275345.42183@kcl.ac.uk>

Dear Paraview-Community,


I am currently running parameter sweeps and want to visually compare the result (a single .vtk file) to a base line (a single .vtk file). Therefore, I wanted to load both .vtk-files in Paraview, generate a screenshot of them and close Paraview again. Since I have several hundred simulations this task would be very tedious to do manually and hence I though I might be able to run a python script from the terminal to do this task in an automated fashion.


I have found this link online (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2011-October/023026.html) which is not very promising, but also hoping that this feature would have been added since then. I already want to thank you in advance for any help, merry Xmas!


Kind regards,

You can indeed run a python script from terminal to automate such a
task. Use pvpython or pvbatch executables. Those are simply Python
interpreters with ParaView initialization stub. You can pass in a
script as command line argument and the application will quit once the
script is done.

Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A8A0AD6F9@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello,

I've started migrating a set of plugins written in ParaView 3.14.1 to ParaView 4.0.1 There's a class method that uses pqPythonShell and tries to call releaseControl(). Sure enough, pqPythonShell in 3.14.1 has a releseControl() method, but it's no longer there in 4.0.1.

What's recommended for this, is that method just superfluous now?

Thanks,
Mark

Hey Mark,

Yes that is superfluous now. We removed the GIL back in the 4.0 transition
to be compatible with python libraries that are incompatible with it. Since
then you don't need to manage it directly anymore.

Hi Karl,

Sorry for the lag in response.

We spent quite a bit of time looking at this issue when we were making the
xdmf3 reader.

The new xdmf library's treatment of the data structures that pertain to the
xml contents it much more efficient than the old version.

Also, at the ParaView level there you have two choices of how to read and
xdmf file with the new reader.

The "(Top Level Parition)" is meant for this case. It makes it so that that
every node opens its own child xdmf files. That way no memory is spent on
the xml structured for contents they are not responsible for the hdf5 data
for.

Anton,

The lookup table would be setup only if scalar coloring was employed.
Some reason the code is deciding to pick scalar coloring for the
dataset when being shown in render view, but not so for
pqMultiSliceView. What version of ParaView is this?

Hi Dan,

thanks for the patch, but unfortunately I have not been able to test it 
yet, though I tried different things.

I work with pvpython on a compute server with Ubuntu 12.04. For 
configuration I have CMake 2.8.7, and I built ParaView 3.14.1 a while 
ago. For ParaView 4.2, I need at least CMake 2.8.8, but I could not get 
it to work on that system. Our admin supposed that there might be 
library problems between Ubuntu 12.04 and newer CMake versions, and it 
may not work at all. Therefore I could not build ParaView 4.2.

I tried applying the patch to ParaView 3.14.1 instead, but I had the 
same result as before. Maybe it is just not the right thing to do, I am 
not familiar with these things.

Then I switched to my desktop PC with Windows 7, where I set up the 
building process. When I run the configuration in CMake, as soon as I 
enable python, I get the error

CMake Error at VTK/CMake/ExternalData.cmake:176 (add_test):
   add_test given test NAME "pvpythonPython-TestAnnotateAttributeData"
   which already exists in this directory.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

   CMake/ParaViewTestingMacros.cmake:44 (vtk_add_test_python)
   Applications/ParaView/Testing/Python/CMakeLists.txt:82 
(paraview_add_test_pvbatch)

even without the patch. Can you tell me what to do about it?

Kind regards
Ian

Subject: [Paraview] Tensor variables in ExodusII database
Message-ID: <30A7AFEA-9FF4-4690-ADB3-C8622E1AE983@utah.edu>

When writing a symmetric tensor to an ExodusII database, the following link indicates that ParaView will interpret the variable as a symmetric tensor if it is written to the file as var_xx, var_yy, var_zz, var_xy, var_xz, var_yz, where var is the variable name

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=5979

However, when I write symmetric tensors to the database with the above convention, ParaView interprets them as 6 independent scalars.  Is there a more updated method of naming symmetric tensors in ExodusII database files so that ParaView will interpret them correctly?

Cheers,

That would be the perfect approach for my use case :-)
Could you point me to some documentation on how to use the new XDMF reader?
I did not yet find much on Google & Co.

I am using Paraview 4.2.0 for Linux x64. I also tried a Nightly-Build in November.
The XDMF-Files state the specification as 2.2 from 2003.

Is there anything special necessary to make Paraview use the new reader and provide the option for top-level-partitioning?
Or do I have to compile Paraview myself and enable some configure-flags?

Thanks a lot and happy holidays :-)

Thanks for the reply Sam.  I made a typo in my original question - I did have the off-diagonal components labeled as you suggested.  I tried swapping x and z in the last off-diagonal term to see if that would make a difference - to no avail.  Interestingly, ParaView does seem to interpret the variable as a tensor, as indicated in ParaView re-ordering the components from how they are written to the database.  e.g. ParaView lists them as _xx, _xy, _xz, _yy, _yz, _zz but they are written to the database as _xx, _yy, _zz, _xy, _yz, _xz (or _zx) - as shown in attached screen shots.

I seem to recall opening ExodusII files with tensors displayed in a ?collapsed" fashion - with the magnitude being the default view, just as Displacement in the attached screen shots.  Any further advice to reproduce this behavior is much appreciated!

Cheers,

Tim,

Tribal knowledge leads me to suggest trying

var_xy, var_yz, var_zx

for the off-diagonal terms.

(I can't recall for sure but the last entry may be var_xz)

When writing a symmetric tensor to an ExodusII database, the following link indicates that ParaView will interpret the variable as a symmetric tensor if it is written to the file as var_xx, var_yy, var_zz, var_xy, var_xz, var_yz, where var is the variable name

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=5979

However, when I write symmetric tensors to the database with the above convention, ParaView interprets them as 6 independent scalars.  Is there a more updated method of naming symmetric tensors in ExodusII database files so that ParaView will interpret them correctly?

Cheers,

Message-ID: <d13e0c0f5d344176a00b484f04c2378b@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

There is an issue with the trace recorder missing color preset changes.  I wrote up a bug here: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15116.  However, I need the python for a user so that he can manually edit the trace script and change color presets.  Does anyone either know the python I need, or where to find it?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <770597768.1809859.1419342093531.JavaMail.root@univ-valenciennes.fr>

Hello, 

I would like to see my finite volume mesh resolution in a line plot (OpenFOAM data). I would like to use the PlotOverLine filter or something else that can plot : 

* only the cell center values when inside the internal mesh 
* the boundary face values when on the computational domain boundary 

I've tried to use the PointDatatoCellData filter before using the PlotOverLine filter but it doesn't change anything for me and I don't know if it's the best procedure to accomplish this. 

Basically, I just want to have a line plot with the same number and values as the cell centers when inside the internal mesh + 2 face centers if the line cross the domain boundaries. 

Is it possible to use some filters in addition to PlotOverLine or something else to obtain this behavior ? 

Any help will be warmly welcome 
Thanks

The plot over line filter only interpolates at the specified points so it
will always have point data output for the plot. You can try using two
slice planes that intersect at the location of the line and then maybe some
cut filters to get rid of the rest of the line that's not wanted. I'm not
sure of the details of how to turn this into a plot view in paraview with
discontinuous values. If you figure that step out, please share it since I
was trying to do similar things but didn't get to figuring out the last
step in the process.

Regards,
Andy

Anton,

In 3.98.1, pqPipelineRepresentation::setDefaultPropertyValues() made the
decisions about scalar coloring. Stepping through that code for the case
where not coloring is picked by default, may shed some light on it.

Alan,

What does your user want to do exactly? Does he have a color XML that he
wants to load?

Hi Alan,

Did you want to load a preset color lut by name from python? If so, this 
example shows how: 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python/Lookup_tables

That commit was accepted as an interim measure, was never publicized, 
and Utkarsh may have a better way by now.

Thanks Andy for your kind answer. 

I follow the same path as yours with two slices but sadly can't go any further. 
But perhaps someone can help us to overcome this obstacle 

Be sure that I will share the solution if I found one :) 

Thanks again.

Objet: Re: [Paraview] Line plot with cell data: PlotOverLine ? 



The plot over line filter only interpolates at the specified points so it will always have point data output for the plot. You can try using two slice planes that intersect at the location of the line and then maybe some cut filters to get rid of the rest of the line that's not wanted. I'm not sure of the details of how to turn this into a plot view in paraview with discontinuous values. If you figure that step out, please share it since I was trying to do similar things but didn't get to figuring out the last step in the process.

Hello, 

I would like to see my finite volume mesh resolution in a line plot (OpenFOAM data). I would like to use the PlotOverLine filter or something else that can plot : 

* only the cell center values when inside the internal mesh 
* the boundary face values when on the computational domain boundary 

I've tried to use the PointDatatoCellData filter before using the PlotOverLine filter but it doesn't change anything for me and I don't know if it's the best procedure to accomplish this. 

Basically, I just want to have a line plot with the same number and values as the cell centers when inside the internal mesh + 2 face centers if the line cross the domain boundaries. 

Is it possible to use some filters in addition to PlotOverLine or something else to obtain this behavior ? 

Any help will be warmly welcome 
Thanks 


Fran?ois,

Correct, the user has a specific XML file / block of code he wants to load.  He is working on a car engine, with a few hundred blocks.  He is coloring the car engine by material type ? aluminum, steel, rubber, copper, etc.

I think what you would need to do is use a Python Programmable filter to
essentially generate a point data with 3 points at the interior points in
the grid. One would be for the point data for the first cell using the
original interior point, another point marked with vtkValidPointMask of 0
to indicate that it shouldn't be used for plotting and a third point for
the second cell using the original interior point. The first and third
points above would have a vtkValidPointMask of 1 to indicate that they
should be plotted. There was some talk about adding functionality to
ParaView's plotting to do this easier but no real action on it yet.

Andy

Greetings,

I need to quantify the distance between two curved and deforming surfaces (large deformation mechanical analysis) as a function of time in batch mode. I don't know (and don't want to know) which two node points are the closest. Could you outline how you would code up something like this ?

The way I did this was to use one surface as a ?source? - fire rays from
this surface along the surface normal until they hit the ?target? and
return the distance. Then use the distances for every source node as a new
field which is output. One requires ideally a source mesh with quite dense
points to get a good sampling.

Hi Alan,

There is a filter in VTK called vtkDistancePolyDataFilter. It takes
two polydata as inputs and produces up two two outputs, each with an
the (optionally) signed distance from each point in the first polydata
to the closest point on the second polydata. If the polydata inputs
overlap and the signed distance is requested, the distance may be
negative, which means that the point at which the distance is computed
is inside the other polydata.

Attached is a ParaView 4.2 state file with a Programmable Filter that
exposes the vtkDistancePolyDataFilter. It could also be exposed as an
XML plugin.

Cheers,
Cory

Thanks for pointing that out, I was not aware of that filter. (Main
difference in the approaches looks like "signed distance from each point
in the first polydata to the closest point on the second polydata? whereas
the ray method would do an intersection).

Merry Christmas

Very nice and simple!  Thanks.

I tried running it on two instances of disk_out_ref.exo, and it complained that it has MultiBlock data as inputs, but needs PolyData.  Being a neophyte with the programmable filter, how can I either convert my data, or convert the filter to use multiblock data?

Thanks!!

Alan,

disk_out_ref.ex2 -> Merge Blocks -> Extract Surface should get you
polydata that you can feed into the programmable filter.

Thanks,

Cory, 
Excellent idea.  I did try, and yes - I end up with polydata.  However, I then don't see any output.  Mind giving this a try?  Utkarsh should have disk_out_ref.exo.  What I did;

Read in disk_out_ref.exo.
merge blocks
extract surface.
read in disk_out_ref.exo (yes, I know I could have used the original.  Being pre-Christmas brain dead.)
transform.  X translation 20.  (disks now have a distance from each other of about 8.5 units.)
merge blocks
extract surface.
highlight each extract surface.
programmable filter.  Paste in your code.

No output variable named "distance" to be found.  

Thanks,

Alan

Alan,

disk_out_ref.ex2 -> Merge Blocks -> Extract Surface should get you polydata that you can feed into the programmable filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Gradient filters
Message-ID: <5a9967f5859d4b1e8e83cac41a703222@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

What is the difference between the Gradient and Gradient Of Unstructured Dataset filters?  The Gradient filter puts out a few million lines of warning with a structured (CTH AMR) dataset, but the Gradient of Unstructured Dataset filter seems to work fine with structured data (once again, CTH AMR data).

Thanks,

Alan

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C4isXhvyoWDdGk4KZVKH7CbUBQUg4dKY7bWyZ6W32D4Vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to visualize the result of two simulations from PFLOTRAN in
ParaView 4.2.0 64 bits using PFLOTRAN Reader.

One simulation I run locally and the other one is coming from the
supercomputer.
The results of the simulation that I ran locally open correctly in
ParaView, while the result of the  simulations that come from the
supercomputer do not show correctly in ParaView although the hdf file
contains the correct data ranges.

The simulation h5 files that come from the supercomputer contain the
correct data if you look at them with hdfview or compare them with the
local results using h5diff , but when you open the results of the
simulation from supercomputer  in ParaView, all data arrays are [0,0] and
this is while the file contains the correct data for which the data arrays
is for example  [0, 1].

Does anybody have any idea why this possibly happens ?


Thank you very much in Advance for your help.

Best Regards,
Hedie

Subject: [Paraview] error loading binary XML file
Message-ID: <54A1D4BB.5060808@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I wrote two simple Matlab scripts to output data in a XML format (this 
is VTS - for structured grids). In the attached scripts the structured 
mesh is 2x2, the values to be visualized are all ones. The only 
difference is that one script outputs the data in ASCII format, another 
- in binary one. Using ParaView for visualization of the ASCII file is 
nice, while with binary data I get the following error:

ERROR: In

I can't figure out where the problem is. Searching in the Internet also 
didn't give me a clue. What am I doing wrong?

I use ParaView 4.2.0 64-bit on Linux Mint.

Thank you,

Hi,
I just downloaded the paraview-4.2.0 binaries from the website to use on my
newly installed Gentoo desktop.
When opening a file the 'Surface' does not show up. Neither do the labels
for the legend (colors do appear).
'Surface with edges' shows edges well.
Files are fine because they work well on other setups (Mac, Ubuntu).
Any clue as to why this might not be working in this environment?
Same thing with paraview-4.1.0. Both 64 bits linux.
Any help appreciated.
Thanks

I don't know how to guide you on setting up drivers for Gentoo.

The gradient filter works specifically on image-based data. (An AMR grid is essentially a hierarchy of image data.) It computes the gradient by taking differences in the x, y, and z directions of the grid. The unstructured gradient filter makes no such assumption about the directionality of the edges. Instead, it computes the gradients within the cells and averages the results. The intention is to get valid results on unstructured grids, but the implementation actually works on any dataset object. Thus, it will work on image-based data, but slower (and will probably give a slightly different answer).

I am guessing that the warning message you are getting is only supposed to be outputted once, but the filter is being independently executed on each block of the AMR and so gives the warning each time. Rather than fix this specific instance, it might be better to have a smarter output window that recognizes when a message is repeated and reports only once with an indicator of how many times it was raised. Now that I think about it, it would be nice if the output window also cleaned up all messages to hide some of the diagnostic information that comes with every message (like file location). That would make warnings/errors more helpful in general.
