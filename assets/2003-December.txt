Unfortunately, although I had time to look at this problem a few weeks ago,
this opportunity has vanished!  From the current look of things, I might get
another chance in Feb/04.

Nonetheless thanks.

Perhaps the quick method of using the command prompt is the way to go ... I
just have to find the docs.

Hi Marsha,

What version of compiler are you using? Also, could you send
CMakeError.log and CMakeCache.txt file to me?

Thank you.

Paraview is just hanging when I try using Mangled Mesa for software
rendering. I've waited like 20 minutes assuming it would take it longer to
load but nothing comes up. 

I know this isn't a lot of information but if anyone knows of a step I might
have missed to cause this behavior please let me know.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Arash,

Since ParaView uses main tree VTK, it will be updated to the VTK5
changes. For example, the next release of ParaView will be released with
VTK 4.4.

Message-ID: <1071698014.26203.13.camel@nike.itc.virginia.edu>

I'm trying to compile Paraview 1.0.4 with HDF5.  I have an HDF5 library
on my system and it also appears that Paraview contains the HDF5
source.  I have tried to use both.  The only obvious question Cmake asks
about locations for HDF5 is for the path to one include file, nothing
about the libraries.  The compilation fails with a lot of "undefined
references" to HDF5 functions.

Thanks for any help.

Hi Katherine,

If you have HDF5 on the system, try turning XDMF_SYSTEM_HDF5 and/or
PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 to ON.

I did set PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 to ON.  I believe I left
XDMF_SYSTEM_HDF5 to whatever the default was, but I can check.  Should
only one of the two be ON?  I saw no way to give the location of any
HDF5 libraries, although the lib directory is under the same overall
directory as the include directory requested.

Hi Katherine,

Is this ParaViewComplete or did you build your own VTK?

As far as I know it's ParaView Complete.  It has a VTK subdirectory.

Hello List

I am trying to run a ParaView server across a firewall but can't 
establish any connection

from my remote server:

paraview --server

from my local client:

paraview --client --host=remote

I access my remote host via ssh without password. I generated a key with 
  ssh-keygen, which I then copied to my authorized_keys file on the 
remote server. Via simple X11 forwarding, I can get a normal ParaView 
session running. But what I really want to do is a server/client connection.

I have used the default port. Should the network administrator do 
something to allow me to go thru?

Any tips would be useful. TIA.

ParaView  has a reverse connection flag thingy. It makes the
server connect to the client. It might work better. Look
at command line help.
