Message-ID: <CAE3taFAQR9boX8NsERtMUv2bmZKcV1JTgLUScafzxtsTvPTYEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

A quick query. I have a csv file that has trend and plunge data for
three orthogonal axes, but I can't see an obvious way of entering the
data, eg.

S1 = Vector_1 plunge_1
S2 = Vector_2 plunge_2
S3  = Vector_3 plunge_3

Where S1 > S2 > S3

So that I generate a 3D cross with the axes plotted, or an ellipsoid.

Can this be done? Paraview v5.0.0

Message-ID: <CAEhu9hA4Kz-946ukE+zK6HGkzJY4Ax4ZzK-j806BGA+oGOiKJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

A recent e-mail <http://markmail.org/message/3tdylg46uj6shevy> in the group
explained how to property create a drop-down menu in a Custom Filter XML
file whose entries are taken from the input data object's array names.  I
was wondering if this could be extended to filters with multiple inputs:

1.  Is it possible to populate the drop-down menu with the array names from
a specific input?
2.  Is it possible to populate the drop-down menu with the array names from
all inputs?

Right now, it will only take array names from one of the inputs (from
testing, it seems like whichever object was created first).

Thanks,
Evan Kao

 string datatypes ?
Message-ID: <CAGgSO3hZajAss0bZ+iOqTX1e0y-dQy_pSpm1EqsMsJLQqiTEcg@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to write a python programmable filter which calculates
statistics across multiple input datasets and outputs those as a vtkTable.

All is ok for numeric values.   But I can't seem to get any approach to
work for outputting a vtkTable column of string values.
Using numpy_interface/dataset_adapter.py is the cleanest approach I've yet
tried for appending  columns of numeric values to an output dataset of type
vtkTable, but it raises the following error on string-valued arrays:

> Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 29, in <module>

File "<string>", line 14, in RequestData

File "C:\Program
> Files\ParaView\lib\paraview-5.0\site-packages\vtk\numpy_interface\dataset_adapter.py",
> line 648, in append

narray = narray * numpy.ones(arrLength)

TypeError: only integer arrays with one element can be converted to an index


Can someone please post an example python programmable filter that outputs
a vtkTable which includes a column of string valued data?   I have attached
a minimal script which reproduces the problem.


Thanks....

Message-ID: <089A0E19-CB81-485F-98C7-41D84914AA7A@ucf.edu>

Hi

I created sim_*.h5part files with 100 steps in each. The step numbers was recorded as 1-100, 101-200?.

However when I load the files, it doesnt show as a time series.

So question is how do I breakup H5Part files on time-steps so they can be visualized by paraview.

Message-ID: <c41619f7-5458-192d-8f2d-9911537515fa@audiofair.de>

So I've been trying to get parallel rendering to work for my Paraview.

I built the server myself with MPI support enabled. I then started the
parallel server using mpirun which appears to run fine.

After connecting to the server and loading my VTK Dataset I however only
see a part of the dataset rendered. It appears that this is the part
that is loaded in the master process and nothing else. I tried running
with more or less processes in parallel which then increased or
decreased the size of the shown dataset.

So I was wondering how do I actually display the rest? The way it is
right now its pretty useless to me since I can't see most of my data.

The data I have is an unstructured grid.

Any help would be appreciated.

I guess your .h5part files are not correct. You need write data of each time step into the file. Do you have your own code to write the data?

Message-ID: <CAN4XDHZ1r-J0My4kzZhzQtd+c_cYaE5CE7AGgYSu1brB0NzCUg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview developers

I intended to plot a quantity on a certain point with exact coordinates
over the time. To do so, I assumed that I should firstly use ??Select
Points On ??option. Then, I should use the ?Plot Selection Over Time? tool.
However, according to the fact that the chosen point is in the cross
section of my mesh and Paraview only allows me to choose the points on the
mesh element boundaries, I was not able to choose the exact point. As a
result, I had to use the ?Probe Location? tool in order to be able to
choose the exact point. Nevertheless, I could not plot the desired quantity
over the time (For example, if I have 10000 time steps, I am able to see
the desired quantity in each time step but it is time consuming to manually
plot the raw data). I would be so pleased if you could guide me how I can
plot this quantity over the time appropriately at the desired point.

Best regards
Omid

If you know the point id, you can select exactly that with the Find Data dialog. You can then plot that selection over time.

Message-ID: <CADLMsL6Hd1Wu5hHcsHT8ErrmthUFKh6_+2KedMF=BG6_+As6_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I really need someone to explain the meaning and setting of "Whole extent"
in the "Table to structured grid" filter, I've read the following thread:"
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-October/013948.html" and
would like to know how the Whole Extent (0, 149), (0, 151), (0, 2) was
deducted from the dataset.
Also, I've been trying without success to get a volume from a *.csv file
with "Table to Point" -->"Delaunay 3d".
Table to point is working fine, but Delaunay 3D is meshing my model wrong.
I then tried to append scalars on an STL version of my model using "append
dataset" and the point cloud, but all the scalars turn to 0.

several subject I know, but one goal: Find a way to read ANSY MEchanical
model/results in PARAVIEW.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Stephane,

It can be a bit confusing, but for example if you have a cube:

X = 20 cells, Y = 20 cells, Z = 20 cells (i.e.) the dimensions are 20 x 20 x 20

In Paraview, the extent always starts at index 0 so the whole extent would be:

X = 0 to 19, Y = 0 to 19, Z = 0 to 19.

For structured grids, the order on X, Y and Z must be correct. X
changes fastest, then Y and finally Z, something due to the way VTK
works - maybe an expert can clarify better.

Subject: [Paraview] plugin error: "Input for algorithm vtkPVPostFilter is of

Message-ID: <CAOyh2ea54jdUpn51YO02N6GYXDNNxLYzmbQSJ5897Fiq+KXKOw@mail.gmail.com>

To anybody experienced in plugin programming:

I am trying to include items in the paraview tree, which are not derived
from vtkDataSet or vtkDataObject. For example, a mySQL database should be
allowed as a data source, which delivers data in an intermediate format.
Next I'd implement filters which take the intermediate format and produce
vtkDataSets as output.

Is it possible to use such "abstract" (not vtkDataSet) objects in the
paraview tree as a representation of the intermediate format? I have tried
to integrate the example for custom classes from
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_Examples_vtkAlgorithm_Source into a paraview
plugin (CMakeLists and servermanager xml below). When the plugin is loaded
and I add a source of the new type AlgorithmSourceExample, this error is
thrown:

ERROR: In

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x3857810): Input for connection index 0 on input
port index 0 for algorithm vtkPVPostFilter(0x3858910) is of type vtkTest,
but a vtkPolyData is required.

What do I need to change such that the vtkTest objects, produced by
AlgorithmSourceExample, can live in the paraview tree?

Thank you

yes I have my own code.

I wrote the step numbers as 1-10 in first file and then 11-20 in second file and so on.

So do I have to create first file with data from 1-10 steps and then second file with empty 10 steps and then data for 11-20 steps and so on ?

Is there any other easy way to create h5part file such that:
- code writes N steps and then closes the file and starts a new file
- write another N steps and then closes the file and starts a new file ?

Regards

Amit

Hi,

When importing STL format geometry or similar, where connectivity information is not implicit in the data structure, it appears that the connectivity is reconstructed via an  octree search. This is very inefficient when surfaces with large differences in edge length are imported ? we have had a recent case where an STL took 45mins to load. If the same input geometry is converted to OBJ format via an external tool, the load time reduces to minutes.

A generally more efficient method is to calculate the distance of each point from a location outside the point cloud bounding box and then to bubble-sort the resulting list. Unless you are dealing with a pathological case your local search neighbourhood of identical distance points will be small and the algorithm very fast. More complex, multi-origin algorithms are also possible to counter pathological instances.

I can provide more details and sample code if you are interested.

Eugene,

I am pretty sure the community will be interested in this! While I'll need
to look into the reader to understand, to get things going, do you have a
sample dataset to demonstrate the issue?

Subject: [Paraview] problems using pvbatch in frozen build
Message-ID: <c83d21df-76f1-ea17-6cff-afa30d65757e@lbl.gov>

Hi All,

I'm encountering some issues when trying to use pvbatch from a frozen 
build(PARAVIEW_FREEZE_PYTHON=ON). Seems that certain key python modules 
are missing.ie math. However, I can use Python shell feature in the GUI 
from the same build. Do we have any idea about what may be wrong with 
pvbatch?


here is output from a simple test:

    nid00048:~$pvbatch pvbatch-test.py
    started
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "pvbatch-test.py", line 3, in <module>
         from paraview.simple import *
       File
    "/usr/common/graphics/ParaView/builds/PV-4.4.0/lib/site-packages/paraview/simple.py",
    line 40, in <module>
         import lookuptable
       File
    "/usr/common/graphics/ParaView/builds/PV-4.4.0/lib/site-packages/paraview/lookuptable.py",
    line 21, in <module>
         from math import sqrt
    ImportError: No module named math

I tried this as well:

    nid00048:~$pvpython
    Python 2.7.9 (default, Jan  8 2015, 22:29:31)
    [GCC 4.9.1 20140716 (Cray Inc.)] on linux2
    Traceback (most recent call last):

         import readline
    ImportError: Excluded frozen object named readline
     >>> import math
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    ImportError: No module named math

Hi All,

first of all, is 5.1 production ready? or is 4.4 still the way to go in 
a production environment? this would be the only install available for 
users so it's important that it function reliably/correctly.

re: 5.1, I'm wondering what the recommended mesa config for use with pv 
5.1 on cray is?  Which version of mesa have been tested/recommended? is 
open swr an option yet? or is llvmpipe still a better bet?

Thanks

11.2.* is recommended. OpenSWR is not yet in official release of
Mesa3D (it's still in the RC stage), llvmpipe would still be the best
bet.

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight 6 imported case error
Message-ID: <577CD16A.3000908@virtualmech.com>

Hi there,

We are working with Syrthes thermal. The output of such program is
written in Ensight case format, version 6. All data is imported
correctly from Paraview 4.3.1 except for one node, we tested in several
different problems, whose temperature nodal value is incorrect. It
should be 7.12e+02, and ends up being 7.12e22, to give an example.
Therefore, the maximum is unreal and the whole surface plot is ruined. I
checked with Paravis inside Salome 7.7.1 and 7.6.0, and also, as pointed
out before with Paraview 4.3.1.

I also run the ens_checker (ensight case file health checker) on the
files and they seem to be ok. I also inspected the results file and all
nodal data is correct, no e+22 found in these files.

Did anybody have the same problem? It seems related to the Ensight
reader or plugin used by Paravis/Paraview.
Attached example plots.
Any help would be much appreciated.

Regards,

Juan

Yeah, my steps go on for several days, so I want to save let us say 100 steps in a file (each steps has 100K particles), and then 101-200 steps in next file and so on.

That way if my code crashes after 100 steps, I can resume from that point onwards.

So is there a way to save the H5Part timeseries in separate files based on time ?

Regards

Amit

Eugene,

BTW, the reader does support not merging points. I'll check if ParaView
exposes that option, if not, it should. That'll speed this up too.

Subject: [Paraview] Time Series of 3D scans in Paraview
Message-ID: <388819EB-3727-47BF-B2B5-2546898ADC65@mac.com>

Hi there,

	I?m new to Paraview, and I was hoping that I could get some advice for my research. I have data from a flow visualization that consists of scanning a laser sheet over a dyed flow and imaging the sheet head-on with a high-speed camera, resulting in a tomographic scan of the flow. Each scan consists of 25 image slices (the z-coordinate and order of each slice is known). I have many volumetric scans (~900) each consisting of 25 image slices that are TIFF image files (~1.3 KB each). The intensity of each image corresponds to the presence/absence of dye in the flow in order to observe flow structures. 

	I would like to combine the images from each scan into a volume and then be able to create a time series of the consecutive volumes, essentially making a ?4D? video from my data. In the future, I would like to implement a fast-marching algorithm to segment out various structures and play around with particle tracking, but for now, I just want to create a 4D visualization of my data. 

1.) Is this possible to do in Paraview, and if so, how? If not, do you know of any other software (preferably open-source) that can perform this task? 
2.) Is Paraview capable of handing such a large overall file without grinding to a crawl?
3.) Is it possible to automate the import of my data perhaps through Python?

I greatly appreciate any advice that people can offer me.

Thanks so much,

-Ryan

Doesn't anybody know, why a vtkAlgorithm which produces a custom class
(vtkTest) that is not derived from vtkDataSet show the error "... but a
vtkPolyData is required"?

A side remark, previously I wrote that the custom class "vtkTest" is
neither derived from vtkDataSet nor from vtkDataObject. Actually it is
derived from vtkDataObject.

If my question doesn't make sense, please let me know. Maybe it is against
every paraview design, so that I'll have to find a completely different
solution. But it becomes more and more urgent for me to include a data
source (mySQL database) of custom classes (not vtkDataSets) in the paraview
tree.

Thank you
Corinna

Hi,

Has anyone managed to get Paraview working nicely on a 3D Tv? We are looking at purchasing one of these http://www.lg.com/uk/tvs/lg-65UF860V but we want to be sure that it?s going to be possible to configure with Paraview before we purchase it.

Thanks in advance,

Hi Corinna,

Does vtkTestSource override the FillOutputPortInformation() member
function? It should look like

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
int vtkTestSource::FillOutputPortInformation(
  int vtkNotUsed(port), vtkInformation* info)
{
  // now add our info
  info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkTest");
  return 1;
}

If that doesn't fix the error, let us know.

You may run into other problems with a custom data object - you may
want to derive your vtkTest class from one of the vtkDataObject
ParaView works with, e.g., vtkTable.

Thanks,
Cory

Evan,

1.  Is it possible to populate the drop-down menu with the array names from
> a specific input?
>

Yes, it should be possible, with some finagling. Take a look at the
RibbonFilter in
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/filters.xml. In the
Input property, an InputArrayDomain is defined - actually, two are defined,
but the point is they are named differently and referred to differently in
the ArrayListDomains in the SelectInputScalars and SelectInputVectors
properties.

In your case, I would try to define two inputs as two different properties,
define at least the one InputArrayDomain in the input property for the
input from which you want the arrays, and use that in your ArrayListDomain.
If you are talking about picking the input first and then the array from
the chosen input, I'm not sure how to do that.

Hmm, not sure about that one. Probably not without some
modifications/additions to the ParaView code.

HTH,
Cory

Yes, FillOutputPortInformation already looks exactly as you say.

I gave the link to the complete example code in my initial question:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_Examples_vtkAlgorithm_Source
I changed a few lines to make it compile with Paraview 5.0.1 (see the
comments in the CMakeLists.txt with my initial question). In addition, I
can send to you tomorrow a small source archive ready for compilation.

I'll also check vtkTable to see if it solves my problem. I thought of just
deriving the vtkTest class from vtkDataSet and returning a fake, empty
dataset while keeping the information from which the actual vtkDataSet will
be processed downstream in the pipeline. Do you think that this workaround
is feasible, or what other problems should I excpect?

Thank you
Corinna

Hi Cory,

We looked into this. The problem was not with the dataset but with the
paraview settings files ("paraview -dr" runs without issues).

Thanks
Sujin

Hi Sujin,

Thanks for following up.

Stephane,

Could I get the settings configuration files in effect when you saw the PLY
reader problem to try to figure out which settings caused this problem?

Thanks,
Cory

Burlen - we?ve successfully built 4.x and 5.x on a number of different
Crays.   We use the Superbuild and allow ParaView to pull whatever
versions of the dependent libraries it needs and build everything on the
fly.    It looks like the recent builds used mesa-11.2.2 ?..

Hi All,

first of all, is 5.1 production ready? or is 4.4 still the way to go in
a production environment? this would be the only install available for
users so it's important that it function reliably/correctly.

re: 5.1, I'm wondering what the recommended mesa config for use with pv
5.1 on cray is?  Which version of mesa have been tested/recommended? is
open swr an option yet? or is llvmpipe still a better bet?

Thanks
Burlen

Subject: [Paraview] Simplest file format/method to import meshless 3D field
	data?
Message-ID: <CAJ7aB-+QDTM+aswUqRP5uZ8YHSeFyL0zAsvPFHoT+AeQeu3ZgA@mail.gmail.com>

I have 3D flowfield data that has odd connectivity. I *could* manually
write a triangulation to produce the connectivity and write a standard file
format with tetrahedral elements, but I'd prefer it if I could simply dump
all the point data and import it.

>From what I've seen, the "point cloud" methods seem to just create
topologically 2-dimensional surfaces from points in 3D space, and not an
actual 3D field, is that correct?

Is there some file format / importer where I can just write a data file
along the lines of

x1,y1,z1,var1,var2,var3,...
x2,y2,z2,var1,var2,var3,....

and read that into paraview complete with some kind of interpolation
between points to produce contours?

Thanks Rich! Have you had a good experience with 5 thus far?

I am more concerned with the usability aspect rather than the build. For 
instance if a user goes to volume render something and they see a 
trashed screen, they are likely to file  aticket which ccreates a bunch 
of work for me, and worse they are likely to switch to the competition's 
vis tool. Thus I'd rather see something slow but reliable, vs fast and 
flakey. I'm assuming 5 is maturing by now though...

Hello Cory,

Paraview is still crashing if I start it normally and try to load a .PLY
(even after deleting the settings configuration files, so I am not so sure
the problem is coming from the config files....I don't know...).  I am
sending the original config files.

Following on the footsteps of the successful VTK hackathon, we'll be
doing a ParaView hackathon next week on Wed. July 13.

Please email me (or the list) if you're attending. The objectives will
be similar:

* clean up pending MRs
* clean up bugs reported on bug tracker
* update/triage dashboard machines

Hi Weiguang,

Have you tried recent release of paraview / vtk? This should have been
fixed in the recent commits.

Thanks

Hi,

We have used Paraview on some 3D HD TV connected via HDMI to a laptop.
You have to set the stereo in Paraview to SplitViewPortHorizontal. It
is not as nice as CrystalEyes since you loose half of the horizontal
resolution.

To display in UHD on the TV from your link you will need a graphic
card allowing UHD, like an Nvidia Quadro 5000.

Utkarsh,

Unfortunately, the STL that produced the issue is confidential and also quite large, so I am unsure how to go about producing something equivalent. Let me know what you find after looking at the reader and I will try to find something appropriate. To be honest, the reasoning is speculative, but it is clear that the STL reader has some drawbacks. At the very least we would be happy to test any alterations you might come up with on the original input.

Not merging the points is a reasonable work-around, but you will lose some utility (feature detection). I think it should be relatively easy to create or port an existing algorithm that is a bit more efficient (of course these kind of assumptions tend to be wrong, but anyway!).

Eugene,

I am pretty sure the community will be interested in this! While I'll need to look into the reader to understand, to get things going, do you have a sample dataset to demonstrate the issue?

Hi,

When importing STL format geometry or similar, where connectivity information is not implicit in the data structure, it appears that the connectivity is reconstructed via an  octree search. This is very inefficient when surfaces with large differences in edge length are imported ? we have had a recent case where an STL took 45mins to load. If the same input geometry is converted to OBJ format via an external tool, the load time reduces to minutes.

A generally more efficient method is to calculate the distance of each point from a location outside the point cloud bounding box and then to bubble-sort the resulting list. Unless you are dealing with a pathological case your local search neighbourhood of identical distance points will be small and the algorithm very fast. More complex, multi-origin algorithms are also possible to counter pathological instances.

I can provide more details and sample code if you are interested.

I got over such problems by delaying importing of those modules until
needed. They are not needed for most common use-cases.

Subject: [Paraview] Fwd: ADIOS plugin Paraview 5.1

Hello,

I've compiled Paraview 5.1 with mpi support and ADIOS plugin to read some
ADIOS
datafiles.

I run paraview in client/server mode with 16 mpi processes in one node; when
opening a test file I got the next error (16 times, one per each process):

Connection URL: cs://XXXX:11111
Accepting connection(s): XXXX:11111
Client connected.
'rpc_read_config()': failed with -2.
'dc_boot()': failed with -2.
'dc_alloc()': failed with -2.
'rpc_read_config()': failed with -2.
'dc_boot()': failed with -2.
'dc_alloc()': failed with -2.
'dcg_alloc()': failed with -12.
common_dspaces_init(): failed to initialize.
ERROR: Failed to connect with DATASPACES

So it seems I need to run the Dataspace server by hand, right ?

Why the plugin uses Daspaces transport method instead of the more
traditional mpi ?

I don't recall paraview cmake configuration allowed to
specify any transport method for ADIOS.


Thanks,

Benjamin

It should. As I am looking at the code, I notice that there may be a bug in
the code that passes the cell data information which is causing the arrays
to be lost.

Thanks Utakarsh. It sounds like it may be possible to work around the 
issue by not importing the lookuptable module from simple. However,  
it's "import math" that fails, and math seems like a fairly basic module 
that should always be present. Is there any chance it got left out of 
some packaging manifest used in the freeze process? having it be 
available might be a better solution.

Dean,

Current numpy support in VTK doesn't include string arrays, You can
overcome that as follows:

colNames = [ 'simulation', 'v0 (m/s)', 'k (%)' ]
col0     = [ 'm01-sim001', 'm01-sim002', 'm02-sim001' ]
...
strArray = vtk.vtkStringArray()
strArray.SetName(colNames[0])
strArray.SetNumberOfTuples(len(col0))
for i in range(len(col0)):
    strArray.SetValue(i, col0[i])
output.RowData.AddArray(strArray)

Is it possible to plot some variable over time at an xyz location?  For instance, if I have water flowing down a pipe, and want to plot the pressure as the water velocity increases one unit (i.e., cm) in from the edge of the pipe, how do I do it?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CANA1KAARx0xYmnsffh0owdDN=hvH962aM9kUOtgjQ5rOt=YCzw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaView users,

I recently set up a pvserver on our small cluster. I used the most recent
stable ParaView release 5.1 and compiled from source.

The connection and rendering in client/server mode works fine in all
representations except the "Volume" rendering. Here, depending on the
model, either no model is shown at all (just the standard 3D render
screen), or the previous representation with artifacts shows up. This seems
to be a problem of the --use-offscreen-rendering flag that I use in the
pvserver startup.

I run the server on a node with 2 CPU (with 10 cores each) and 2 Nvidia
Tesla K40c. I start the server with:

xinit /usr/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.6.5/bin/mpirun -np 4 pvserver -display :0.0
--use-offscreen-rendering   : -np 4 pvserver -display :0.1
--use-offscreen-rendering

In the client the threshold for remote rendering is set to 0.

If I pass additionally the -tdx=1 and -tdy=1 flags the volume rendering is
performed correctly, but the overall speed is decreased greatly.

Thank you in advance for any help!

Gunnar

Hi Alan,

How about using the Extract Location filter using the interpolate at point
for the mode and then do a Plot Selection Over Time after selecting that
point?

Thanks for asking the question -- I didn't know about the Extract Location
filter until I tried answering this! I was originally thinking of using a
Point Source at the desired location and then Resample with Dataset filter
before doing the Plot Selection Over Time. I'm sick of Ken Moreland always
coming up with better ways of doing what I suggest on the mailing list for
questions like these so this time I looked into it a bit more :)

Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview]  Custom Python plugin with multiple input ports
Message-ID: <CAJ-2Sz0+hiBc93ryTQNGG9pKrcdZ-5GWFn+0SrsJJ_mrapf20g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to make some custom python plugins for ParaView.

I've made one based on a PythonProgrammableFilter with the help of the
Python Filter Generator Script
(https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/snippets/5).

It's working pretty well, but it seems that the PythonProgrammableFilter is
limited to algorithm with only one input port.
I need to make another plugin which needs two well separated inputs ports.

I've seen that one could use vtkPythonAlgorithm to define a plugin with
input ports
(https://blog.kitware.com/vtkpythonalgorithm-is-great/).

Unfortunately, I've been unable to find any documentation to define a
plugin with the XML syntax based on that vtkPythonAlgorithm.

Could you give some hints ?


Best regards,

Message-ID: <1468223588232.47724@rwth-aachen.de>

Dear Paraview Community,
I have succeded to import my FEM Data (Nodal Coordinates, Element Connectivity and Nodal Tensions) into Paraview via a self written *.vtk-file.
Now that I finally have my Force Vectors I want to use the stream tracer filter. But whatever I do ?laying around with the stream tracer settings, nothing happens.
I don't even get an error message or anything like that. Is there any additional documentation about the stream tracer filter? Anything else I could read and can't find on google?

I'd be grateful for any hints, help or critics =)

Thanks a lot!
Asaad

Message-ID: <2F1A6BF3-3F11-4262-AF0C-5E6E1A367D50@aia.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi folks,

I would like to visualize an integer array of an unstructured dataset based on voxels, which contains MPI rank ids generated by a filter we use. To achieve this, I plan to somehow extract the ?sharp? interfaces, similar to what the contour filter does, to obtain a visual representation of the domain decomposition. However, for the contour filter, I first have to call ?Cell data to point data?, which smears out the previously sharp interfaces and causes connectivity problems of the resulting contours, as in some areas the domain decomposition features are very small.

Is there another way how I could extract these contours? Please note that I am not using vtkProcessId but rather an own integer array.

Thanks a lot in advance

Michael

Maybe some visualization might help to illustrate the problem. This is what the domain decomposition looks like for two domains:

[cid:5C5D6EE8-569B-4469-93BF-E838F51706B8 at aia.RWTH-Aachen.DE]

There are only two domains with values 0 and 1, respectively. I then select & apply the ?Cell Data to Point Data? filter, then the ?Contour? filter with only one isosurface set to ?0.5?. However, in this example, the result is a blank screen, i.e., no visible output from the Contour filter.

In another example, I get the following result:
[cid:43435313-C9BC-46AB-94F7-145F6A981F56 at aia.RWTH-Aachen.DE]

The sharp, colored interfaces of the integer array in the back is clearly visible. In this case, there are 5 domains (values [0,4]) and I used 0.5, ?, 3.5 as the isosurface values in the contour filter. While in this case I actually get an output (white lines), they follow the fuzzy output of ?Cell Data to Point Data? and I am not able to reconstruct the sharp interfaces.

To conclude, my problems are actually twofold: I would like to find out how to restore sharp contours, and - if that does not work - at least how to make this approach work for all datasets I am looking at.

Again, thanks a lot in advance, and please excuse my double posting...

Subject: [Paraview] different data ranges
Message-ID: <09A83B4F-1DB3-4222-B8F5-38A3EB89B1F1@dzne.de>

Dear all,

I am new to paraview.

I want to visualize and compare two image stacks with different bit depth (8 and 16-bit).
Thus two different data ranges. Is there a way to overcome the default behaviour of paraview to use the same color transfer function?

I found two related posts here, but I somehow cannot make this work for me.

Could try threshold, or nearly equivalently clip by scalar, followed by
surface filter.

Another option is the material interface filter. That requires unstructured
grid input and an integer or idtype material array. Clip its output or use
opacity to see inside since its external surface looks the same as its
input's.

Hi David,

Thanks for your answer. From what I understand, your suggestions allow me to extract the surface for a single domain. However, what I am really looking for is something like in the second example, i.e., where I get lines representing the domain boundaries between *all* domains at once. I just want them to align neatly with the actual boundaries and not have them diluted by the Cell-to-Point filter. Any idea how I can achieve that? Or maybe I just misunderstood you?

Extract region surface will do all domains at the same time.

What it does is iterate over all cells and extract the faces of the cell
for which either their is no neighbor or the neighbor cell has different
material.

Christopher,

You basically need to have different names for your 8 and 16 bit data
arrays to be able to use color maps with different ranges.

You tried the Calculator trick to rename one of your arrays? Could you walk
through what you tried that isn't working?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi David,

ah, ok. However, in this case I?m wondering what I am doing wrong here: If I use the Extract Region Surface filter, my dataset looks just like before. Do I need to create an array with a certain name that contains the information on which the regions are extracted? And does this work also for 2D (unstructured grid with vtkQuads) or only in 3D?

Sorry for being so slow :-/

Extract region surface will do all domains at the same time.

What it does is iterate over all cells and extract the faces of the cell for which either their is no neighbor or the neighbor cell has different material.

Hi David,

Thanks for your answer. From what I understand, your suggestions allow me to extract the surface for a single domain. However, what I am really looking for is something like in the second example, i.e., where I get lines representing the domain boundaries between *all* domains at once. I just want them to align neatly with the actual boundaries and not have them diluted by the Cell-to-Point filter. Any idea how I can achieve that? Or maybe I just misunderstood you?

Could try threshold, or nearly equivalently clip by scalar, followed by surface filter.

Another option is the material interface filter. That requires unstructured grid input and an integer or idtype material array. Clip its output or use opacity to see inside since its external surface looks the same as its input's.

Christopher,

Adding the paraview list back so that others may benefit from or contribute
to the discussion.

I think the advice to leave the function blank wasn't quite right. What you
actually want in the function is the name of the existing array in your
data set. You can get a list of the names in the Scalars or Vectors pop-up
menu at the bottom of the calculator controls, or you can just type in the
array name. For example, to rename from 'ImageScalars' to 'Result', you
would leave the Result Array Name as 'Result' and enter 'ImageScalars' in
the function.

HTH,
Cory

Dear Cory,

ah ok! Good that works now. I also needed to change the data array in the coloring section from my ?MetaImage? to ?Result"
Awesome! Thanks a lot!

Can you share your dataset and specific information on what you're trying
to do in ParaView?

Cheers,

I encountered issues building ParaView 5.1.0 with VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5=ON and CMake 3.6. The issue with FindHDF5 was reported by another user on the CMake mailing list (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/cmake/2016-July/063908.html) and on OS X I was able to work around it by setting the HDF5_ROOT variable. 

I also encountered linker errors that go away after cherry-picking VTK commit 351d0a6d1ce13daef7e52ed988f843aae0ff9fbf (https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/commit/351d0a6d1ce13daef7e52ed988f843aae0ff9fbf).  Would you please add a fix for the HDF5 linking errors in ParaView 5.1.1?

Folks,

Since there we a couple of crucial issues reported after the 5.1.0
release, we are planning on putting out a 5.1.1 patch release.

Currently, this will include the following fixes:

1. Address issues with depth peeling not working as expected in
client-server mode.
2. Address issues with ExodisIIReader not loading certain variables.
3. Address issue with nested lists in OpenFOAM
4. Address issue with "?" button not working in ParaView binaries.

Is there anything else that's can qualify as critical that should go
in this patch release? Note the 5.2.0 release in planned for SC16 i.e.
Oct/Nov.

If there's nothing else, I think we have fixes for almost all of
these, so we can put the release out early next week.

Steve,

That's already on the `release` branch which will become 5.1.1. There
are a few more issues with it that we are currently tracking down, but
yea, it should get included in the 5.1.1 release.

Odd. I wonder if it's driver related. Did you build ParaView with
VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND set to OpenGL2? Also, "-tdx"/"-tdy" could indeed
slow things down as it's now rendering for a tiledisplay rather than
for a client. The rendering works in that case, since the client is
rendering on it's own. Also what is the datatype you're rendering? I'd
suspect it's an unstructured grid or a multiblock of unstructured
grid.

Message-ID: <D150EB91-B994-4C2E-8CA9-38F45744B9C5@gmail.com>

Hi,

I use vtkDistributedDataFilter to partition the unstructured data. It seems that each process gets a data partition and does not know any information about other data partitions.
So my question is, after the partitioning, given a point, how can I know which process owns it? Or simply how can I know whether it is inside the entire domain?

Oh, I forgot to mention the data type in my previous post.
You are indeed right, it is an unstructured grid. In order to make sure it
is not related to my input files, I tried with the example case XX as well
with the same results.
ParaView was built with the OpenGL2 rendering backend, as this seems to be
the new standard also with the pre-compiled clients.
I think this is not a MPI issue, as also starting only a single process
does not solve the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView5.1.0 fails to read XDMF 3DCoRectMesh
Message-ID: <5784EB8D.9070702@fz-juelich.de>

Hello,

since Version 5, I have several problems using the xdmf reader.
Unlike ParaView4.4.0, which is able to read it withou any problems,
ParaView 5.1.0 and 5.0.1 fail to read the following xdmf file:
(Please find the complete xdmf file here:
https://fz-juelich.sciebo.de/index.php/s/f6VicXjvJz64q3l
and the binary file here:
https://fz-juelich.sciebo.de/index.php/s/XKcfR9kDKW9Nmct )

Can anyone reproduce the error? Has the xdmf reader changed sice 4.4.0?

thanks for your help,
Sonja

Hi Asaad,

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that everyone can follow
along that wants to.

The issue is that your vtk file is incorrect and the cells are being passed
in as VTK_POLY_VERTEX instead of 10 noded tets. The change for this is to
change the CELL_TYPES value from 2 to 24. The reason that the stream tracer
doesn't work is that the cells have no volume so when the stream tracer
tries to find which cell a seed or point along the streamline belongs to it
doesn't and thus the streamline never begins or ends.

Best,
Andy

Can replicate the problem, thanks.

I don't see any suspicious changes in the ThirdParty/xdmf2 or vtkIOXdmf2
directories that might cause this.

Trying with the newer Xdmf3 path now.

Mind filing a bug report?

Folks,

Thanks to all those who responded. I've create a calendar invite.
Others are welcome to join in on July 13th, between 10 am - 5 pm EDT
(NY time) to participate remotely using the following hangout link:

https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/kitware.com/paraview

Everyone is free to help out as you deem fit. A few suggestions are as follows:

1. Fix bugs reported on the bug tracker. To make this easier, we've
created a short list of bugs with tag "Hackathon-July-2016". You may
pick ones in this list, or any other open issue. Even just trying the
bug report out with latest "master" and flagging the bug as
reproducible or not -- for those new to ParaView development -- is a
huge help. Here's a link to these shortlisted bugs:

http://tinyurl.com/hhfnjh7

Again, you are free to expand beyond these to all open bugs if you
like. This short list is just a starting point for those who need it.

2. Review merge requests

3. Investigate Python 3 support

4. Review/reorganize dashboard machines

Utkarsh

Subject: [Paraview] Streamlines with an octree/hierarchical grid
Message-ID: <CACoCd8d_GDMB31DxJ5wg1OLNuw9gyW_XCOmD2Ccwp9wosO-BCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon,

I am trying to generate streamlines on a solution generated on an octree
style grid with hanging nodes/faces. I have cell centered data. The problem
is that the streamlines always end too early. I assume this has to do with
the incomplete connectivity inherent within this type of grid.

My questions is, has anybody dealt with this before? And if so, what might
I try to get this to work?

I've tried creating a 3D Delaunay tessellation from the cell centers
(obtained from the Cell Centers filter) but, at least for this case,
Paraview crashes. Also, converting the cell data to point data does not
take care of the problem.

I've thought about attempting to interpolate my data onto a uniform
structured mesh and use that new dataset as the source for the streamline
filter, but I'm not sure how to go about doing that.

Does anybody done this before or have any ideas about how I might solve
this problem?

Thanks for your time,

Ethan Alan

Hi Ethan,

I've been able to use streamlines with a general multiblock data set that
uses blanking. This may be slightly different than your data set but I
don't see why it shouldn't work for you.

Are the streamlines terminating near the interfaces between different
leaves of the octree grid? If you look at the ReasonForTermination cell
data output that should give you an idea. Note that values for that are:

   1. out of domain
   2. not initialized
   3. unexpected value
   4. streamline max length reached
   5. maximum number of integration time steps reached
   6. stagnation (velocity too close to zero)


There are termination criteria for the filter (e.g. the options under
Integration Parameters and Streamline Parameters in the Properties panel,
some of them are advanced options so click on the gear to get access to
those) so you may want to play with those.

If you still have problems with this, could you share your data set for us
to test with?

Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] How to animate the clip plane to remain in the middle of
	a dataset.
Message-ID: <084be1b7a81a423d9225a5e52115fe6c@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

My user is trying to clip an object, such as the can, and then animate the clip plane to remain in the middle of the dataset over time.  He then wants to be able to follow data.  Finally, he wants this in a script, so he can run many datasets through this process.  Here is a thread on how it is done.  The trick is to insert a python track in the animation view that keeps the clip centered, and then add a camera track using follow data.  The trace recorder is missing this magic - I will write up a bug.

<<Start reply from Utkarsh>>
Alan,

Attached is the corrected trace. Yes, it's indeed a bug. We'll need to extend the tracing to trace Python Animation Cue, which it's currently missing.

I hear you, but isn't that just as arbitrary? You'd run into the same
problem when your data has 10001 points, but now it won't even be as
obvious. Remember, if you mostly dealing with small data, you can use
the "settings" [1] to save your preference for default value for the
"Glyph Mode".

Andy,

Thanks for your rapid response. The streamlines do indeed seem to end near
interfaces between leaves in the grid, but specifically when they are at
different levels in the octree; i.e. when one element has four neighbors
across any of its faces. I should be able to give an example of this
behavior. But I thought I'd give you this update first. At least most of
the times, in the cases that I've been experimenting with this afternoon,
the reason for termination is 1/'out of domain'

I'm using a newish version of paraview (4.4.0) but I'll try on 5.0 soon.
Also, I'm not sure that this is important, but he elements are VTK Voxels,
not hexahedra.

Thanks for your help,

Hi Ethan,

I'm not sure updating to a newer version of ParaView will help here but it
should be an easy thing to test out.

I think the issue is that the grids aren't quite fitting tightly together
like you think they are. It's tough to say why that is without having
access to the data set but I'd suggest doing some slice planes through
where the streamlines terminate early to see if there are any gaps there.
The slice plane will automatically remove the ghost/blanked cells so it
should be much easier to see any gaps between the octree leaves.

I don't think the cell types should matter here but if you want to test out
my assumption you can use the clip filter to convert the AMR grids to
unstructured grids with hex cells. This will blow up the memory usage so
it's not a good long term solution but ok for testing.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Slice filter to Image
Message-ID: <CAOmyp+SvEgqSOmqSAfgqGmWyS4MUkndvY8GKaiPk_unmP6WNuw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Is there a way to make an image out of a slice?

I want to take a slice of a 3D hydro (cell data) and turn it into an image
of just the slice, without the extra information such as the background,
perspective, etc...

I'm specifically going to be doing this in a python script that I run with
pvbatch --mpi.


If there isn't a quick way, but someone can point me to some examples that
can help me get where I'm trying to go, that would be great as well.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAOyh2eaoOaajSLXuLyK5KO6gpE=uvQU9sz1AxUaNXTohqGi0sA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Cory,
can you still help me to find the problem, why the custom vtkTest source
cannot be produced inside paraview, but fails with a vtkPVPostFilter
message (see subject)? A complete test was attached to my previous email.

Why does vtkPVPostFilter expect vtkPolyData input, although both in the
Servermanager xml and in FillOutputPortInformation the type is correctly
given as vtkTest? Is there another place, where I need to define the output
type?

I also tried to make use of the vtkTableReader, but I can't seem to make it
work, because it tries to read point data, cell data etc., which don't
exist a priori in my use case.

Hi Asaad,

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that everyone can follow along that wants to.

The issue is that your vtk file is incorrect and the cells are being passed in as VTK_POLY_VERTEX instead of 10 noded tets. The change for this is to change the CELL_TYPES value from 2 to 24. The reason that the stream tracer doesn't work is that the cells have no volume so when the stream tracer tries to find which cell a seed or point along the streamline belongs to it doesn't and thus the streamline never begins or ends.

Best,
Andy

Hey Andy!

Yes, no Problem. I attached my vtk file which includes the nodal coordinates and corresponding IDs. It also includes the definition of my elements which are 10 node tetra elements. And it includes nodal and elemental Force vectors, each consisting of Fx,Fy and Fz. Each of theses vectors are created with the qudrature norm of three tensor components. And last but not least this file includes the Fx force vector consisting of three tensor components(without quadrature). This force vector is supposed to represent the load path in x direction. to visualize that load path I want to use the stream tracer filter.

My idea is following the approach of D.W. Kelly (see Load paths and Load Flow in Finite Element Analysis) and the last attached file has figures that might show a bit more of what I am trying to achieve.


If you need any additional information please let me know!

Thanks in advance for any kind of hint or help!!

Now that I finally have my Force Vectors I want to use the stream tracer filter. But whatever I do ?laying around with the stream tracer settings, nothing happens.
I don't even get an error message or anything like that. Is there any additional documentation about the stream tracer filter? Anything else I could read and can't find on google?

I'd be grateful for any hints, help or critics =)

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable sphere source - update position each
 timestep from csv file
Message-ID: <2db5a765-ea2e-aab4-f769-71d688b4fd3b@ucl.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I am trying to create a programmable source to create a sphere, the 
location of which updates per time step based on coordinates in a csv 
file. However, I have sort of got my head around the python library 
(thanks to tracing what I do in the GUI!), but I think one needs to use 
the vtk library instead? I have written a python script which does the 
job when called from the python shell, but this is not updating when the 
timestep changes. I have tried adapting this code to work as a 
programmable source, but to no avail.

Here is the code for the programmable source I have so far:

import vtk
import os
import csv

csvfilename = '../../resources/vtk/testpos.csv'
csvfilename= os.path.abspath(csvfilename)

animationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()
target = int(animationScene1.AnimationTime)
print "Target value is: " + str(target)

pos = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
count=0
with open(csvfilename) as f:
     r = csv.reader(f)
     for row in r:
         print "Current row :" + str(row)
         if count == target:
             print "found it"
             pos = [float(i) for i in row]
             break
         count += 1
print "Pos is now : " + str(pos)

s=vtk.vtkSphereSource()
s.SetCenter(pos)
s.SetRadius(10)
s.Update()


The csv stuff works as far as I can tell, but it gives an error because 
GetAnimationScene is not defined. However, there is another problem, 
even if I ignore all of the time dependent things and just try to create 
a sphere in this manner:

import vtk
s=vtk.vtkSphereSource()
s.SetCenter([0,0,0])
s.SetRadius(10)
s.Update()

there are no errors, but no sphere either! So I guess I am missing 
something fundamental about the difference between python scripting and 
programmable sources. Further, I wonder if it would be easier to change 
the position of an already created sphere source with a programmable 
filter instead?

Has anybody solved a similar problem and can point me in the correct 
direction? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

James

Hi Ethan,

The issue here is that unstructured grids (which is what you have here)
doesn't support non-conforming grids (e.g. octree grids with "hanging"
nodes). So in this case the stream tracer filter is trying to traverse the
grid by using cell adjacency information and because there isn't proper
connectivity information at the interfaces between different octree levels
the grid traversal thinks it has hit a boundary and stops.

The proper way to model this octree grid in VTK is through a
vtkNonOverlappingAMR, vtkOverlappingAMR or vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet. See
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUniformGridAMR.html for
information on that and either the VTK or ParaView users guides.

Cheers,
Andy

Probably not, but then I assumed you had moved on. Are you still doing
this? Can you go back to your original use-case? What is your objective
with this? Maybe there are alternative approaches than using the
"collaboration" support, which frankly is rarely used and hence I'd
consider experimental.

Subject: [Paraview] Issue with PVD timestep attribute format
Message-ID: <CA+Wz_Fz4103637hD7c+3=755aJvnwNWV5mRD0G8WkPgFMPc0BA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

the official description of the PVD file format (
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats) tells that "TimeStep"
attribute "is a floating point value", but i think that Paraview 4.0.1 and
also 4.4.0 only accepts integers as the value of timestep attribute.

An example of a PVD that I'm using is:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
> <VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
>   <Collection>
>     <DataSet timestep="+0.10000000E+001" group="" part="+0"
> file="filename.pvtu"/>
>     <DataSet timestep="+0.20000000E+001" group="" part="+0"
> file="filename.pvtu"/>
>     <DataSet timestep="+0.30000000E+001" group="" part="+0"
> file="filename.pvtu"/>
>   </Collection>
> </VTKFile>
>

This is working with Paraview 3.14.1, but it doesn't work with Paraview
4.0.1 and 4.4.0.

Timestep attribute accepts floating point values?
Which floating point format?

Thanks in advance!

Corinna,

It seems that your use case is not currently supported. T.J. (CC'ed)
is working on a bug fix in ParaView that should enable what you are
doing.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/404

He can fill you in with more details if you need.

Thanks,
Cory

Thanks for looking into this for me.

I'm unclear how exactly to implement the solution you have suggested. Does
this solution require me to export my data differently from my solver? Or
can I somehow use paraview to convert my dataset into one of the
AMR/Hierarchical datasets you mentioned? I'm sorry to sound so noobish,
please bear with me.

I looked in the community edition Paraview user guide (for version 5.0) and
didn't find anything about any of these filters. Am I missing something or
looking for the wrong things?

I guess the crux of my question here is, can I use the data I have already
and have paraview convert it into something more appropriate? Or do I need
to write code to either export my data differently or convert my data
outside of paraview? And, if you will, could you give me an outline of the
appropriate approach to get me started?

Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Paraview] Horizontal averages
Message-ID: <CAK3vnGfDdE5d7uHuFzwo53PzqkWboXQmsvyJqanik7EqhcwVrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working with data on a spherical mesh and want to create a couple
related outputs in Paraview. Let's say that I want to focus on the
temperature values:

1) I would like to extract the horizontal average of temperature at every
depth (i.e. radius). So, I would like Paraview to look at each depth
resolved by the mesh and calculate the mean temperature over the sphere at
that depth. I can inspect the data for spherical slices but can't figure
out the most elegant way to automate this process and export the data to a
CSV file...

2) I would like to use these values to visualise temperature anomalies.
This should be pretty simple since it just requires subtracting the mean
from each depth. So, if the average temperature at 1000km depth were 1600,
then 1600 would be subtracted at each temperature at 1000km depth... and so
on throughout the whole sphere.

Here is a sample *.vtu file:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/aart4ivqr33h1ew/solution-00000.0000.vtu?dl=0

Thanks!

Marie

Dear Utkarsh,
yes, for the time being, I am trying to base my project only on VTK, which
means reinventing lots of ParaView's architecture. At least, I get
*something* running, although progress is slow. But my hope is to switch
back to ParaView once I understand it better and when some bugs are fixed.

The objective is nothing more than what "collaboration" promises: do
collaborative visualization. Without the restriction of a master and slaves
(at least from the user view, although programmatically there may be one
designated master client).

If collaboration is experimental in ParaView, I'd say so in the very
beginning of any article documenting or blogging about those functions.
Still, in an experimental feature, there should be suffiecient interest to
fix bugs, or "unsupported" would be a better term.

One problem I see with the (free, of course) help in this mailing list is
that one never knows whether someone is still considering the problems
adressed in the list after a week or so. Often I see problems half
solved,but the remaining - hard - problem is then silently ignored. I
assume that you communicate internally who is assigned which question,
given that you consider them worthwile at all, so that not two people work
on the same. Just a suggestion, could you send a short "I'll look into
this", and, more importantly "Sorry, we can't solve this problem"? It is
much better to know that one has to go another path than sitting and wait
and maybe ask again and again because nobody dares to say that there is no
solution for a problem that seemed easy in the beginning.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with large VTR files on Windows
Message-ID: <CAOm1YKPiv92DLAbET09Zs052ZmSEGGWVSjEEzOUnCQyKGFT1XA@mail.gmail.com>

I can successfully open a large (4556MB, 1200x450x300 cells) VTR (or a
PVTR file that consists of only 1 piece) on a 64-it Linux (CentOS)
machine.

However, on my Windows 8 64-bit machine I encounter this error:

cannot be read.


When I am trying to open this file in Python using
vtkXMLRectilinearGridReader (VTK version 6.3.0):

reader = vtk.vtkXMLRectilinearGridReader()
reader.SetFileName(fname)
reader.Update()
rtg = reader.GetOutputAsDataSet()

Can this problem be related to the way ParaView binaries are compiled
for Windows?

Makes sense. Note that there's nothing new that has popped up about
collaboration since 2012. Then, it wasn't experimental..over time due
to lack of use and continuous iterations to avoid deteriorations now I
would, personally, consider it experimental. Also, I vaguely remember
saying so in the very first emails about this. Maybe I remember it
wrong. In fact, I am

> One problem I see with the (free, of course) help in this mailing list is that one never knows whether someone is still considering the problems adressed in the list after a week or so.

It is much better to know that one has to go another path than sitting and wait and maybe ask again and again because nobody dares to say that there is no solution for a problem that seemed easy in the beginning.

While that makes sense, I am not sure there's anyway of enforcing
that. No, we don't have internally communications about who's
answering what. Mailing lists are community driven. Community extends
beyond just Kitware. Things get dropped not because no one dares to
say there's no solution, but firstly, because people are busy. I often
see emails with "not supported yet", "it's a bug, please report it"
etc. etc. And secondly, because community is a two way street. Being
human, I would be more inclined to help someone out who's helped the
community out before. If someone keeps asking time consuming questions
over and over again without contributing back to the community much, I
think one can be forgiven to prioritize responding to that question
below others. Thirdly, mailing lists are not akin to "customer
support" in traditional sense. There are paid services
(http://www.kitware.com/products/consulting.html) for that.

Going back to your collaboration issue, I can try to see if I can
reproduce it in near future -- but I really can't guarantee when. Much
to my dismay, there are way too many things on my todo list.

Vyacheslav,

I believe you are running into problems with files > 4 GB on Windows.
Special functions for randomly accessing files of this size are
required on Windows, but they are not used in the ParaView, VTK, or
supporting libraries in a consistent way. See
http://www.firstobject.com/fseeki64-ftelli64-in-vc++.htm for some
background.

I'm not aware of current plans to address this problem, unfortunately.
If someone in the community wanted to take up this challenge, I would
be happy to review a patch.

Best regards,
Cory

Christophe,

I doubt it has anything to do with the particular version of Fedora
that you are running.

The first thing I would suspect is an incompatible version of OpenGL.
You need OpenGL 2.1 at the very least, but better would be OpenGL 3.2
or above.

Can you report the output you get when running 'glxinfo'?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Ethan,

I think you're going to need to export your data differently from your
solver. You could hack around for a solution but it would probably cause
different issues with different filters and I don't see any filters that
would get you to a proper representation of your data in the VTK data
model.

The ParaView Catalyst User's Guide (
http://www.paraview.org/files/catalyst/docs/ParaViewCatalystUsersGuide_v2.pdf)
has some more in-depth information on the different data sets in VTK and
some explanations on how to programmatically construct them. It's probably
not exactly what you want but more detailed than the ParaView User's Guide.
A short description of the format you probably want to use is
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_readers#XML_UniformGrid_AMR_Reader
.

Best,
Andy

Thank you! After recompiling Paraview with that patch, the problem seems to
be solved.
Will the patch be automatically merged into the development version? And in
which future Paraview release can we expect to find it? (I don't understand
the details of the build robot's messages)

I have been seeing flackiness with X with OpenGL2 too .. things like
the pvserver windows taking forever to startup with pvserver. Haven't
dug in much, but thought i'd mention.

Corinna,

Thanks for trying that patch! If you would like, feel free to report
your findings on the GitLab merge request itself.

Once TJ's patch is merged, it will be available in ParaView's master
branch. It will then be available in ParaView 5.2, due out in the fall
of 2016.

Best regards,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] custom filter doesn't update property in the Paraview UI
Message-ID: <CAOyh2eZxL7ZaJBo_G_Pe=Y0-4vg_2skomuFV3q=5Gm4TgxyB8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I would like to work on a filter that updates some of its properties from
the filter input. As a demonstration, I attach a (quite minimal)
"vtkTestProperty" filter algorithm, which takes vtkPolyData input, and
which is supposed to copy input->GetNumberOfPoints() into the filter's
"NPoints" property which is exposed to the user interface.

Inside vtkTestProperty::RequestData, I execute:
    int nset=input->GetNumberOfPoints();
    this->SetNPoints(nset);
which, is correctly setting the NPoints value. Additional print statements
in the code confirm, that NPoints is actually updated, but the new value
won't be shown in the Paraview UI.

To reproduce the behaviour, the attachment is ready to compile with
Paraview 5.0.1. Just load the compiled plugin in Paraview, create a
"SphereSource" and append the "ATestPropery" filter to the SphereSource.
The console output will show that NPoints is set to 50 (Number of Points of
the Sphere), but the UI still shows 42 (the default value from the
Servermanager xml).

What am I doing wrong?

Thank you
Corinna

There are a couple of things wrong with your plugin :).

1. A RequestData() implementation should never change MTime of the
filter. You code call SetNPoints() which changes MTime.
2. ParaView's properties are not bi-directional. They are only
intended to be set on the UI side and pushed to the VTK side. There
are of course exceptions to this, and you can add what's called a
"information_only" property that instead reads a value from the VTK
side and provides it on the "client" side, but for such properties,
often there's no UI. They are instead, used to define the "domain" for
the property which controls things like range for the slider, for
example.

Thank you so much Andy,

That's precisely the type of answer I was looking for. Now I know where to
start looking and approximately the scope of the problem.

Cheers!

I'll check the meaning of MTime.

I was also assuming this, but I thought there are a few filters that update
their properties when some inputs upstream in the pipeline change. My
memory can be wrong, though.

I am not sure, whether I understand all details of your reply.
In summary, is it possible to update UI properties of a filter, when its
input changes? By no means?

I'd need something similar to an image resize filter. The output size
should be identical to the input size, when the filter is first attached to
the input. The output size should be shown in the UI and the user should be
able to enter a different output size. Is this impossible? Not even with
some more complicated workaround?

Thank you
Corinna

See the implementation of vtkSetMacro() in vtkSetGet.h. Every time the
value changes, it call this->Modified() which updates the MTime. Since
VTK is a demand-driven pipeline, changes to MTime is what tells the
pipeline that the algorithm has been modified and needs reexecution.
If one modifies the MTime in RequestData() (the method called by the
pipeline to process the input to produce output), the pipeline thinks
the filter is always dirty and that can cause unexpected side effects.

This is possible. Let me see if I can find you a simple example for
the same. I'll get back to you.

Corinna,

Take a look at the TIFFReader SourceProxy in
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/readers.xml. It has
a CustomDataSpacing property that enables you to set voxel spacing,
and has an associated information property CustomDataSpacingInfo that
should initially populate the spacing property when the reader is
created.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Default opacity in ParaView version 5.1
Message-ID: <20160714160512.GA27017@florence>

Hello,

I noticed that the new version of ParaView displays only the boundaries
of an object in an opaque way. Previously, the default behaviour was to
display solid colours and "Opacity" slider provided some control. Also,
clearly only the boundaries are shown and internal mesh is invisible.
Is that an intentional change. Is there a way to revert to previous
behaviour and have boundaries displayed in solid colours.

I am using OpenFOAM Paraview reader, but a minimal example for me is to
display a cylinder from Sources.

Please let me know,
Robert

Dear Utkarsh,
thank you for these explanations. If you feel like I "keep asking time
consuming questions over and over again without contributing back to the
community much", it is, because I'll need a long time to get to a point
where I can help others. Maybe never. Depends on the help I get :(

If you find some time to look back into this, please drop me a message.
I'll appreciate. I'll continue developing a minimal solution with only VTK
dependencies in the meantime.

Peter

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable sphere source - update position each
 timestep from csv file

Hi James,

Instead of the Programmable Source, you should be able to use the
paraview.simple module to do this in a Python script. Here's code to
create and show a Sphere source:

s = Sphere()
Show(s)

You can update the sphere position with

s.Center = [1, 2, 3]

Obviously, you can use the above line in your loop over the positions
from the CSV file. After each Center update, you should re-render with

RenderAllViews()

You can run Python script files through the Python console by clicking
the "Run Script" button and navigating to your script file.

HTH,
Cory

Lo?c,

Python Programmable Filter can indeed take more than one input. Select
all the inputs in the Pipeline Browser you want to pass to the
Programmable Filter before you create it. Within the script, you can
access the inputs with

input1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
input2 = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 1)

print input1
print input2

One big caveat with this - the order of the inputs is somewhat
arbitrary. There is a feature request to make these inputs easier to
order.

Best regards,
Cory

Hmm, I don't see anything unusual with these settings files.

Is your PLY file unusually large by chance?

Dear Colleague,

I am trying to use the fielter GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet on the 
field T which is in the vtk file example.vtk (see the joined file). 
Nevertheless, I only obtain a NULL gradient (see the file tutu.png) 
although the T field is not a constant scalar field.

Is it normal ?

Thank you for your help !

With my best regards.

St?phane

Hi,

It looks like gradients aren't getting  computed properly for quadratic
triangles. A quick work around is to use the tesselate filter to subdivide
the quadratic triangles while converting them to linear triangles. The
gradient of unstructured data filter should work after that. I'll add in a
bug report to see about getting this fixed as well.

Best,
Andy

Cory, thanks for mentioning the TIFFReader proxy. I tried to modify my
previously attached code such that the NPoints property links to a
NPointsInfo property. Plus, I have removed the call
"this->SetNPoints(nset);" inside vtkTestProperty::RequestData as suggested
by Utkarsh. The NPoints property is still showing the default "42", though,
and not initialized or updated from the number of points of the input
dataset. I am obviously missing another important step in addition to
changing the xml definitions, but which one?

Here is the detailed modification of TestProperty.xml compared to the
earlier attachment:
replace
"<IntVectorProperty name="NPoints"
                        command="SetNPoints"
                        number_of_elements="1"
                        default_values="42">
  </IntVectorProperty>"
with:
"<IntVectorProperty name="NPoints"
                        command="SetNPoints"
                        information_property="NPointsInfo"
                        number_of_elements="1"
                        default_values="42">
  </IntVectorProperty>
  <IntVectorProperty name="NPointsInfo"
                        command="GetNPoints"
                        information_only="1">
    <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
  </IntVectorProperty>"

Thank you

Hi Cory,

As I understand, the Python Programmable filter can accept only one input
port, but this port can accept multiple connections. The order of multiple
connections on the same port cannot be controlled by the user.

My filter need two input datasets, but they are not commutable.
The user should be able to set up each input manually.

It seems possible in ParaView when a filter accepts multiple input ports.
For example, the "Resample with Dataset" filter accept two inputs ports and
the "Change input" dialog define an input named 'Source' and an input named
'Input'.

This is exactly what I need.But I don't know how to make a paraview filter
accepting multiples input ports in python:
 - "Python Programmable filter" seems limited to only one input port
 - the vtkPythonAlgorithm seems able to handle multiple input ports, but I
don't know how to use it in ParaView.This vtkPythonAlgorithm seems a good
candidate to respond to the feature request you mentioned.

Do you have any hint two make a ParaView filter with multiple input ports?


Best regards,

Dear Andy,

Thank you for your answer.

I don't find the "tesselate filter" in the alphabetical list : would you 
tell me what is the right filter ? Thank you.

Moreover, if the pb is due to the fact that I use quadratic triangles, 
the filter GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet should works after the use of 
the filter PointDataToCellData ? But it does not still work.

Best

St?ph

Hi Cory,

Thanks for your help. Sorry if the message was rambling, but I had a 
script which made the spheres is called from the python shell as you 
suggest. However, I was looking for a solution that was automatically 
updated when changing the timestep in the GUI - I was not clear on this, 
apologies. So I thought I had to use a programmable source or 
programmable filter.

The spheres are designed to indicate locations inside a larger dataset, 
so I compromised by having a spherical clip which updates its centre. 
The code for the programmable filter to do this is:

import vtk
import csv
csvfilename = '../../resources/vtk/testpos.csv'
input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

t = 
self.GetInputDataObject(0,0).GetInformation().Get(vtk.vtkDataObject.DATA_TIME_STEP())
TimePoint  = int(t)
     # read the specific line from the csv file
Centre = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
count = 0

with open(csvfilename) as f:
     r = csv.reader(f)
     for row in r:
         if count == TimePoint:
             Centre = [float(i) for i in row]
             break
         count += 1

s = vtk.vtkSphere()
s.SetCenter(Centre)
s.SetRadius(10)

clip = vtk.vtkClipDataSet()
clip.SetInputDataObject(input)
clip.SetClipFunction(s)
clip.SetValue(0.0)
clip.InsideOutOn()
clip.Update()
print clip

output.ShallowCopy(clip.GetOutputDataObject(0))

Probably not the most elegant solution, but it seems to be doing the job!

Kind regards,

James

I mispelled it -- it's the Tessellate filter.

I'm not sure how the Point Data To Cell Data filter is supposed to fix the
problem. The Gradient of Unstructured Data Set filter uses that filter in
the implementation.

I believe the best way to deal with this would be using a Python
programmable filter. Let me see if I can put something together for
you. I'll get back to you.

LB,

Yes, it is troublesome to not be able to tell which input is which inside the Programmable filter.     Something I have done in the past is differentiate them inside the filter.   I have tested for element type to tell them apart, for example.  Something else I have heard of but have not had to use is assigning a unique variable to one input and then testing for that inside the filter to determine which input is which.

None of this may address  your general problem, but here's hoping.

Sorry for chiming in late, but here are some things to note:

* Both Dennis and Cory are talking about multiple connections on the
same input port. This is arguably not too well supported since the
order cannot be determined easily.
* Seems to me you want multiple input ports, each with a single
connection. That's supported. Just not by the Python Filter Generator
Script. Once you have the XML for the filter, you can indeed just add
another <InputProperty /> tag to it as follows (note the "port_index"
attribute):

<InputProperty command="SetInputConnection"
                         name="Input2"
                         port_index="2">
   <!-- fill with relevant domain information -->
</InputProperty>

Then, your python filter code can access data on each input port as:

input1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
input2 = self.GetInputDataObject(1, 0)

Here there's no confusion which data is on which input port.

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

Corinna,

Looking at the ParaView source code, I believe that vector properties
with information properties must have a domain associated with them.
In your case, you can add an IntRangeDomain with only a minimum
defined:

<IntVectorProperty name="NPoints"
                        command="SetNPoints"
                        information_property="NPointsInfo"
                        number_of_elements="1"
                        default_values="42">
    <IntRangeDomain name="range" min="0" />
</IntVectorProperty>

0 seems like a reasonable minimum in your case.

Keep your information_only property as it is. You'll need to change
where your NPoints is set, though - moving this to the
RequestInformation() member function should work.

Cory

Hi Utkarsh,

Multiple input ports are exactly what I want.
But I can't get it to work. I've attached my last XML plugin attempt with
different port_index definition.

When I try to use it, I have the following error:

/ParaViewVTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkAlgorithm.cxx, line 893

vtkPythonProgrammableFilter (0x6c7a510): Attempt to connect input port
index 1 for an algorithm with 1 input ports.

Should I add something to tell ParaView that this filter has multiple input
ports?
Should I use a different class than the vtkPythonProgrammableFilter?

Regards,
-- 
Lo?c

Doh! I forgot that the number of ports need to set in the constructor of
the vtkAlgorithm subclass. Grr...let me see if there's a workaround. I'll
get back to you on it.

Subject: [Paraview] Example of Programmable Filter that is Time aware?
Message-ID: <CAGgSO3ivuSZ7nGpRYp3Ot=4C4hPV6YxWMOw61mVnXFjfGT92kg@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to find documentation on how to access different timesteps of
field data within a Python Programmable Filter.   (Specifically, I want to
output a vtkTable of the cross-correlation sequences of scalar field arrays
A and B over all timesteps.)

The only reference I found was this comment :

> *I suspect that one will have to add support for RequestInformation and
> RequestUpdateData to the programmable filter to support time. That's what
> we had to do in the python programmable filter we use with ParaView.*


I have found no documentation on what the 'RequestInformation' and
'RequestUpdateData'
scripts should look like, and how to use their outputs in the filter.

Can someone please post an example of a paraview Programmable Python Filter
that accesses the timesteps of field data of its inputs?

Many thanks...
Dean

Hello,

I do not think it is a size problem, as i tried also very small files.

Subject: [Paraview] Compute boundary normals of 2D mesh
Message-ID: <e0884457-dd11-2c8e-b1fc-148f00dd6ae1@dim.uchile.cl>

Dear all,

I'm trying to visualize the normal gradient of a variable along the
boundary of an unstructured 2D mesh.
To compute the normal vectors I tried the following:
- Extract Surface
- Generate Surface Normals

However, the resulting vectors are all n = (0, 0, 1), in the z direction
(the mesh lies in the x-y plane), and not the 2D boundary normals that
I'm looking for.
Is there a way to achieve this with the Paraview filters?

Thanks in advance,
David

I am going to say it's just historical. Maybe since filtering is an action,
"Transform" filter went with action verbs while since the Display
properties (on the Properties tab) are the state of the item, they went
with noun forms -- but that's just a guess.

While I have no objection changing one or the other or both,  we should not
forget to weight the cost of changing these to the backwards compatibility
issues they will introduce.

The attached patch for vtkPythonProgrammableFilter along with a minor tweak
to your plugin XML does the trick. I can have this cleaned up and merged in
"master" for 5.2 if that's acceptable.

James,

Thanks for sharing your solution. That seems like a reasonable
approach to achieving what you need.

I was thinking you might be able to use the animation controls to
specify the centers of your sphere, but that does not appear to be
possible with discrete sphere positions. You can do some interpolation
of the x, y, and z components of the clip function center
independently, but I can't think of a way to import discrete
positions.

Best,
Cory

Message-ID: <578CFCE7.7060807@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have many LES results on a stationary mesh. Is it possible to store 
mesh and time dependent flow fields in separate VTU files, so that I can 
save some disk space.

Many thanks,
Feng Gao

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Transforming vs transform filter

I am going to say it's just historical. Maybe since filtering is an action, "Transform" filter went with action verbs while since the Display properties (on the Properties tab) are the state of the item, they went with noun forms -- but that's just a guess.

While I have no objection changing one or the other or both,  we should not forget to weight the cost of changing these to the backwards compatibility issues they will introduce.

Why are the Properties tab/ Transforming controls and the Transform filter different?

The Properties Tab/ Transforming looks like this:

?         Scale

?         Orientation

?         Origin

The Transform filter looks like this:

?         Translate

?         Rotate

?         Scale

Yes, Python and XML state files will be affected. We can handle that,
but it's worth weighing the pros and cons for any such changes.

Thanks Utkarsh!

It's a neat hack, and it will fit my problem perfectly.

The dark side of this patch is that you are limited to one or two inputs
ports.  It would not be possible to create more complex filter like, for
example, the vtkLandmarkTransformFilter (which needs 3 separate input
ports).

To respond to the feature request mentioned by Cory, it would be nice to
have more flexibility. It would be nice to define the number of input ports
directly in the XML plugin file.

Do you think it could be possible?

Regards,

Yes indeed. This was just a quick hack to demonstrate the
functionality with minimal code changes. The actual solution will be
more general, for sure.

Juan,

This indeed seems to be a bug in 4.3.1 that's been fixed since. When I
tried with ParaView 5.1.0 I didn't see the same issue as I did with 4.3.1.
Can you give 5.1.0 a try please? Note we'll be putting out 5.1.1 patch
release soon, so once that happens you may want to start using that to
avoid running into a few bugs with translucent geometry rendering in 5.1.0.

Subject: [Paraview] making animation using vtu export from comsol
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C7RKw7rOic1zcWAW5OTmzcndwPfZJuACOyvgya-0u4mRg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I export from comsol to a single vtu file which saves the time-dependent
info for a variable in separate data arrays in the vtu file.

variable1 at _t=0
variable1 at _t=1
variable1 at _t=2
variable1 at _t=3
variable1 at _t=4
...

The time-dependent values for variable 1 are saved in different data arrays
and therefore  I can not use the paraview animation player.

Is there anyway to use the vtu file above to make animation?

Thanks in Advance for your help,

Dear Paraview developers

I intended to plot a quantity on a certain point with exact coordinates overthe time. To do so, I use ProbeLocation to capture the point. Then, I useFind Data to Plot the probe Over Time. 
In the Find Data window, I set the Find on point and fromon Probe Location. My ID was set to zero which was exactly thesame as the Probe Location tool. ??However, when I select Run Selection Query, I got thefollowing error:?RuntimeError: 'numpy' module is not found. numpy is neededfor this functionality to work. Please install numpy and try again?.
I would be wondering if you could tell me how I can fix this error.
Best regards

Message-ID: <CADLMsL6JSFd1JzoqanD2_OLHvgqVg2KGxEMsm7XGE=y=8Gv+cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to report a few problems encountered on Paraview 5.1.
I am running the Binary-MPI version on Win7, on a workstation with 32
threads (16 physical cores right?).
When running in Parallel with Ensight data, I am using the same workstation
as both Server and client:

- I can execute the pvserver (mpiexec -n 4 pvserver) up to n =24 without
problem
- From there on the same machine I launch a paraview session and connect to
the server
- I Can launch the geometry without problem

The problem occurs when I load the D3 filter on the geometry  with n>12. I
get an error message. This problem was already reported on March 18th, 2016
by another user.

If I stick to 12 cores or less I get another problem with the following
workflow:
I want to apply the StreamTracerWithCustomSource (STWCS) in Parallel so I
do the following:

1) Save the Source surface as a *vtm file, and read it back in current
session
2) Apply D3 filter to Full model
3) Apply STWCS filter with D3 filter as input and *vtm surface as source.

this workflow works perfectly, but there are too many seeds so after step2:
3')Apply MaskPoints to *vtm surface
4)Apply STWCS filter with D3 filter as input and result of MaskPoints as
source ==> Paraview Crashes in Parallel (This works well in a non-parallel
session)

Finally a question on Delaunay2D

I have a point clouds extracted from a surface with a big hole in the
middle. Applying Delaunay2d Always closes the hole. is there a way to keep
the hole ?

Thanks in advance.

Hello Stephane,

The STWCS requires that your seeding data is available on all processes, the solution to your problem is in the attached email. You must simply save your masked points as a VTM file and read it before invoking the STWCS filter. Regarding the issues with the Ensight reader in parallel (second attachment) there was no progress on the Paraview side I assume.

Regards,
Lukasz

Stephane,

Regarding Delaunay2D, by definition if you only provide points it will
always generate a mesh that have the shape of the convex hull of this point
set.
If you want to keep a hole you will have to define a clock-wise ordered
polygon (not polyline) with points that defines the hole and provide it in
input of the algorithm. In this case Constrained Delaunay trianglation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation> will be
computed - you might have to provide a polygon for the external boundary
(ie. the convex hull boundary for instance) defined in counter-clockwise
order in input too.

Hi,
i am having a problem on plotting the trajectory of a single particle at the top of a flow solution. Particularly, i have a csv file, which is named text0000.csv,inside which i have 4 columns, x,y,z,t.in addition, i have additional files text0001.csv,text0002.csv etc, with one row each( variables' values at each time step)
When i load them to the paraview project,i have no problem on performing the animation.However, i also want to have particle's trajectory while it evolves, that is,having lines connecting the updated points with the previous ones. But i havent managed to do that yet. I have installed a paraview version 5.0.1. pls help me,what i should do?

Hello

You should have a look to ParticlePath filter.

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf latest sources?
Message-ID: <CAPd7EPpR1Pd+RUyQhF0LV-vtQCypQY-Wk0Cz6=9gM6QYkNbxgw@mail.gmail.com>

dear experts,
where can I download the latest XDMF source code from?
In the http://xdmf.org/index.php/Get_Xdmf wiki, it says one needs to use:
git clone git://xdmf.org/Xdmf.git
but this simply does not work.
it hangs up with the following message:
Cloning into 'Xdmf'...

many thanks for your valuable help.

Hi Nabil,

"git clone git: <git://xdmf.org/Xdmf.git>//xdmf.org/Xdmf <git://xdmf.org/Xdmf.git>.git <git://xdmf.org/Xdmf.git>? appears to work for me. Perhaps try again from a different network connection?

hi Tom,
many thanks for your reply. strangely it does not really work for me using
two different computers and networks. Could it simply be some domain
restriction in the end?
In the end, I managed to get it from here:
 https://github.com/live-clones/xdmf.git

but I would prefer to use the official repository, if any.

Subject: [Paraview] Homebrew Point-Data-To-Cell-Data is too slow - what's
	the magic
Message-ID: <SN2PR07MB2511464E89756C4E5A4FAC479F0A0@SN2PR07MB2511.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

All,

I need a couple homebrew versions of Pt-to-Cell Data because:

1.       I don't want all pts variables done - just 1 at a time

2.       I need special handling for angles that go from -180 to +180 (when 1 end of element has angle of -178 and other end has angle of 180,  a straight average will give an element angle of 1, when the correct answer is -179)

I have attached the kludge versions which I am using.   They are terribly slow.   The Pt-to-Cell data filter is much faster processing the entire set of variables than these are to process a single one.   Is there any VTK routines I can tap to make these faster?

If I'm doing something stupid which is making them slow, please feel free to correct me.

Thanks for looking

Dennis

Subject: [Paraview] How to convert scalars to colors (and texture) with
	OpenGL2 turned ON
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQtAKchdfA4iEXa55EQs7USmxsuUTp_YeRqXdwgy03BJXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I work on ParaView exporter plugin and I bumped on one problem when OpenGL2
was introduced as default value for PARAVIEW_RENDERING_BACKEND (v5.1). When
I used OpenGL, I converted scalars to colors and generated textures, which
I used for coloring meshes in format to which I export, using class derived
from vtkScalarsToColorsPainter. However, now, when I turn ON OpenGL2, I'm
not able to access this class and even if I access, it relies on some
header files which are generated during build (but only if OpenGL is
selected).

Luckily, OpenGL still exists as an option and I can use it for now. But, I
would like to know:

1. Is it possible somehow to generate colors and texture from scalars when
OpenGL2 is used (similar technique like with vtkScalarsToColorsPainter
class with OpenGL)?

2. If it is not possible, is it planned in future to add support for
something like this for OpenGL2 case?

3. Is it planned to drop support for OpenGL option at some time in future
and approximately when (if known)?

Thanks in advance!

Nenad.

p.s. I build entire ParaViewSuperbuild using VS2013, x64 under Windows 10
Pro with approximately same options like on your dashboards (
https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=ParaView), at the moment (but,
very soon will work on CentOS v7 x64 too).

Btw, is there some page with ParaView roadmap? I found only

Subject: [Paraview] Procedure for compiling Catalyst
Message-ID: <B357A42B-9CFF-4D00-A681-7ABA5C3BC735@snumerics.com>

Hi All,

 

I?m interesting in trying to compile Paraview Catalyst. I understand that there are ?Editions? of the Catalyst library that vary in the amount of functions that are included from the Paraview library. That?s about the extent of my knowledge about the actual source for the Catalyst library. The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.? If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system? The best documentation that I have found for building Paraview is (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code), and I?m having trouble getting Paraview to build from the instructions(I?ve never used cmake before).

Has anyone who has successfully built the Catalyst library or knows about the process lend me any tips about how I should approach building Catalyst?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi Chris,

You can get the Catalyst editions source code at
http://www.paraview.org/download/ by just selecting Catalyst editions for
Type of Download. If you're just getting started though I would recommend
doing a build of ParaView without the GUI. Yes this will require learning a
bit of CMake (see instructions for building ParaView at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install) but it will likely
be smoother for you for understanding Catalyst's capabilities. Also, it's
much easier to link a simulation code with Catalyst through CMake than
specifying all of the include directories and libraries. When you're
looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest
going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues
on HPC machines too).

Best,
Andy

Hi Chris,

Catalyst is not a separate entity from ParaView. It is a subset of ParaView
that is used for *in situ *processing. The concept of the editions is that
the subset of interest differs based on the desired *in situ *processing
and linking your simulation code to all of ParaView Catalyst can take up a
significant amount of memory. Hopefully the blog post at
https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-catalyst-editions-what-are-they/ may
clear up your confusion.

Best,
Andy

Thank you Andy,

 

My understanding is that the Catalyst editions can be compiled separately from Paraview i.e. I do not need to have a version of Paraview compiled in order to compile a Catalyst edition. Is this correct?

Thank you,

Chris

Hi Chris,

You can get the Catalyst editions source code at http://www.paraview.org/download/ by just selecting Catalyst editions for Type of Download. If you're just getting started though I would recommend doing a build of ParaView without the GUI. Yes this will require learning a bit of CMake (see instructions for building ParaView at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install) but it will likely be smoother for you for understanding Catalyst's capabilities. Also, it's much easier to link a simulation code with Catalyst through CMake than specifying all of the include directories and libraries. When you're looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues on HPC machines too).

Best,

Andy

The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.  If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system?

Has anyone who has successfully built the Catalyst library or knows about the process lend me any tips about how I should approach building Catalyst?

Thank you,

Catalyst is not a separate entity from ParaView. It is a subset of ParaView that is used for in situ processing.

How do you use paraview to convert an exodus mesh (with hex8 elements) into voxels and export as a VTK file?  Can I control the number of voxels in each dimension? The mesh is of uniform size in each direction and I need the number of voxels to be a factor of 8.




Thanks,

Hi Alan,

Have you tried the "Resample To Image" filter? It will resample an input
dataset to a vtkImageData. You can also specify the bounds and the
dimension of the image data. By default the bounds is the same as the input
dataset bounds.

Thanks
Sujin

Hey guys,

 

Have you ever had an issue with cmake concerning some missing VTK files? I typed Adam?s command exactly after cloning the Paraview repo(git clone https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git). I made a ParaView_build directory and executed Adam?s command in the build directory. I?m seeing the error shown below. The VTK folder in the cloned source directory is completely empty.


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:615 (include):

? include could not find load file:

 

??? vtkModuleAPI

 

 

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:616 (include):

? include could not find load file:

 

??? vtkModuleMacros

 

 

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:621 (include):

? include could not find load file:

 

??? vtkDetermineCompilerFlags

 

 

CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewModuleTop.cmake:44 (vtk_add_to_module_search_path):

? Unknown CMake command "vtk_add_to_module_search_path".

Call Stack (most recent call first):

? CMakeLists.txt:652 (include)

 

Thank you,

Chris Neal

This will build ParaView, VTK, and Catalyst and install header files so you can build your code with it. -- Adam

Hi Chris,

Catalyst is not a separate entity from ParaView. It is a subset of ParaView that is used for in situ processing. The concept of the editions is that the subset of interest differs based on the desired in situ processing and linking your simulation code to all of ParaView Catalyst can take up a significant amount of memory. Hopefully the blog post at https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-catalyst-editions-what-are-they/ may clear up your confusion.

Best,

Andy

Thank you Andy,

 

My understanding is that the Catalyst editions can be compiled separately from Paraview i.e. I do not need to have a version of Paraview compiled in order to compile a Catalyst edition. Is this correct?

Thank you,

Chris

Hi Chris,

You can get the Catalyst editions source code at http://www.paraview.org/download/ by just selecting Catalyst editions for Type of Download. If you're just getting started though I would recommend doing a build of ParaView without the GUI. Yes this will require learning a bit of CMake (see instructions for building ParaView at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install) but it will likely be smoother for you for understanding Catalyst's capabilities. Also, it's much easier to link a simulation code with Catalyst through CMake than specifying all of the include directories and libraries. When you're looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues on HPC machines too).

Best,

Andy

Hi All,

 

I?m interesting in trying to compile Paraview Catalyst. I understand that there are ?Editions? of the Catalyst library that vary in the amount of functions that are included from the Paraview library. That?s about the extent of my knowledge about the actual source for the Catalyst library. The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.  If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system? The best documentation that I have found for building Paraview is (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code), and I?m having trouble getting Paraview to build from the instructions(I?ve never used cmake before).

Has anyone who has successfully built the Catalyst library or knows about the process lend me any tips about how I should approach building Catalyst?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview compatibility questions
Message-ID: <CADPbR1ioL5dCS7DVGJMEdFJQbGXJ6oYrOk_dF14PuA_2efP3WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am a fairly new user of Paraview, and have been floored at how powerful
of a tool it is. I would like to install it on my research group's remote
desktop; however, my colleagues in IT are not comfortable with installing
it until I have confirmation that it is compatible with oursystem.

First off, has anyone successfully installed Paraview using the Windows
Server 2008 R2 Enterprise (Service Pack 1) operating system? If so, what
version of Paraview was installed?

Second, I am having a hard time finding documentation on whether the remote
desktop's graphics card is OpenGL compatible. Has anyone using Paraview had
success with the Matrox G200eW 16MB DDR2 graphics card?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Hi Chris,

VTK is a submodule under VTK, so try the following:

> git clone https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git <https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git>git submodule init
git submodule update
?the rest of the build process.

Hope this helps!

Sincerely,
T.J.

Well, reading that page again, it doesn't mention VTK, but adding
"--recursive" to git clone will get the submodule. You should probably
delete your repository and clone it again following the instructions at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.

Alan,

For reasons I am sure you are aware of, you cannot in general directly convert the points and cells of an unstructured grid like an Exodus mesh to a regular grid of voxels, and there is no such filter.

The easiest way to make this conversion is to run the Resample To Image filter. This will (potentially) reinterpret the data which could have side effects even if the sample grid matches the original Exodus grid (like interpolating cell data to point data).

-Ken

>From a user - is this even possible?




How do you use paraview to convert an exodus mesh (with hex8 elements) into voxels and export as a VTK file?  Can I control the number of voxels in each dimension? The mesh is of uniform size in each direction and I need the number of voxels to be a factor of 8.




Thanks,

Alan

He doesn't need to delete and re-clone.  The recursive flag just does a
normal clone followed by a git submodule update --init.  So run that
command in your paraview source tree and you should be fine.

HTH,
Shawn

Alan,

For reasons I am sure you are aware of, you cannot in general directly convert the points and cells of an unstructured grid like an Exodus mesh to a regular grid of voxels, and there is no such filter.

The easiest way to make this conversion is to run the Resample To Image filter. This will (potentially) reinterpret the data which could have side effects even if the sample grid matches the original Exodus grid (like interpolating cell data to point data).

>From a user - is this even possible?




How do you use paraview to convert an exodus mesh (with hex8 elements) into voxels and export as a VTK file?  Can I control the number of voxels in each dimension? The mesh is of uniform size in each direction and I need the number of voxels to be a factor of 8.




Thanks,

Alan

Hi Alan,
Have you tried the "Resample To Image" filter? It will resample an input dataset to a vtkImageData. You can also specify the bounds and the dimension of the image data. By default the bounds is the same as the input dataset bounds.
Thanks

Hi Nabil,

It's likely that you are behind some sort of firewall, either local on your
machine or on the networks your trying use, that is blocking access to
unknown protocols, in this case, the git protocol.  HTTP and HTTPS are
usually always allowed but probably not git://.  You can also access the
repo from our public gitlab server by cloning
https://gitlab.kitware.com/xdmf/xdmf.git .

hi Chuck;
many thanks for your reply and for the link. As a side question, do you
know whether there is some link you could point me to and which describes
how to migrate from version 2 to version 3 for Xdmf; Is such a
documentation available? The following wiki is lacking information about it:
http://xdmf.org/index.php/V2_To_V3
cheers, nabil.

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple animations after one another
Message-ID: <CAAfnFpj-boDk0GUguRy4rcK6TdcRuEC9hzt5AL2t4CCDQyLc+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm trying something very simple, but it doesn't seem to work. I have
multiple sequences of data that can be played in an animation. All these
sequences follow each other, creating one long animation. They all have a
length of 250 steps, but when I load them, they all play at the same time
(the first 250 steps) and I can't figure out how to shift the second
animation to (250,500) and the third one to (500,750) etc. A solution is of
course to make separate movies and edit them in an external movie-editor,
but I am pretty sure that ParaView should be able to handle this problem.
Could anyone please help me (either by an explanation on how to do this
manually in the animation view, or by providing me with a simple script)?

With kind regards,
Tim

I'm pretty sure it will not work with the new OpenGL2 backend, it may work
with the old OpenGL backend as microsoft provides a software implementation
of opengl 1.4 with their OSs. That card is not really intended for graphics
so the rendering performance may be a bit slow.

Hi Tim,

Are you loading a sequentially numbered file series? If so, you could
simply renumber the names of the files in the second and third files
so they range from 0 to 750.

Another option is to use a .pvd file to describe the time series and
explicitly list the times for each file. See
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#PVD_File_Format for
details.

HTH,
Cory

Dear Mathieu, 
i have installed cmake and qt in order to use cmake command to convert to .vtp. However,i need to add some additional packages which i am not familiar with. 
So, instead of converting to .vtp, i am sending you in zip form two files with different formats, vtk and csv respectively, files which i have loaded to paraview and being able to animate them using glyph. they are few KB each, it is the minimum i could do in order to keep the example as simple as possible for possible extension later on. 
Sincerely, 
Kostas

Please keep the ml in the loop so everyone can follow this. 

Please open you csv data, save it as a .vtp file and send it to me (if it's not too big)

Hello Mathieu, 
i have applied the Temporal ParticlePath filter,however i havent seen any change. I mean, when i apply glyph to the input data, i can activate this filter and apply it to the input data,either vtk or csv point data. 
However, i havent managed yet to see trajectories of the particles, only the position of the particle or particles at a specific time step.I have searched and I have seen in other posts in the forum referring to the same issue, that the operation interface of the newest vesrion of paraview is different than the previous ones for the specific function. Can you guide me pls if you can? :)

Dear Mathieu, 
i have installed cmake and qt in order to use cmake command to convert to .vtp. However,i need to add some additional packages which i am not familiar with. 
So, instead of converting to .vtp, i am sending you in zip form two files with different formats, vtk and csv respectively, files which i have loaded to paraview and being able to animate them using glyph. they are few KB each, it is the minimum i could do in order to keep the example as simple as possible for possible extension later on.

Hello Mathieu, 
i have applied the Temporal ParticlePath filter,however i havent seen any change. I mean, when i apply glyph to the input data, i can activate this filter and apply it to the input data,either vtk or csv point data. 
However, i havent managed yet to see trajectories of the particles, only the position of the particle or particles at a specific time step.I have searched and I have seen in other posts in the forum referring to the same issue, that the operation interface of the newest vesrion of paraview is different than the previous ones for the specific function. Can you guide me pls if you can? :)

When i load them to the paraview project,i have no problem on performing the animation.However, i also want to have particle's trajectory while it evolves, that is,having lines connecting the updated points with the previous ones.

Hello

You can use the filter ParticleToPathLines on the TableToPoints filter to
visualize the path of your particle.

Hello Mathieu, 
i have applied the Temporal ParticlePath filter,however i havent seen any change. I mean, when i apply glyph to the input data, i can activate this filter and apply it to the input data,either vtk or csv point data. 
However, i havent managed yet to see trajectories of the particles, only the position of the particle or particles at a specific time step.I have searched and I have seen in other posts in the forum referring to the same issue, that the operation interface of the newest vesrion of paraview is different than the previous ones for the specific function. Can you guide me pls if you can? :) 

Thanks again,

Hello 

You should have a look to ParticlePath filter.

When i load them to the paraview project,i have no problem on performing the animation.However, i also want to have particle's trajectory while it evolves, that is,having lines connecting the updated points with the previous ones.

Hello,

I have Paraview 5.0.1. I load pvd file and for the first step of the
solution of partial differential equation, I got the image but then I am
not ale to proceed upcoming solutions in time step. When I click the
'further' button it gives an error and closes.

The error message I get is attached.

What am I supposed to do is there any suggestion?

Best,

Thanks T.J. Your suggestions has resolved the VTK issue. I did not know that it was a submodule. I just learned that submodules exist from this actually haha.

I see that the examples for Catalyst are under the Paraview source tree. I was able to get Paraview to build with Catalyst. I compiled the examples using
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH~/software/ParaView_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON ?~/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/


That seems to build all of the examples without throwing any errors.? Now if I have a small C++ code that I have written that I want to try and link with the Catalyst headers and library files, is there a way to figure out what the command that was used to build the example cases was so that I can copy it? Reading the makefiles that are generated by cmake hasn?t been too helpful for me i.e. I can?t find the ?L and ?I sections of the compile statement that pulls the libraries and headers together.


The end-game for me is to be able to write an adaptor for a simulation code to allow it to utilize the Catalyst functions. This code uses a standard make process, and so I would like to try and avoid having to re-cast the entire build process to cmake.


Thank you,

Chris

Hi Chris,

 

VTK is a submodule under VTK, so try the following:

 

git clone https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git

git submodule init

git submodule update

?the rest of the build process.

 

Hope this helps!

Hi Chris,

You can get the Catalyst editions source code at http://www.paraview.org/download/ by just selecting Catalyst editions for Type of Download. If you're just getting started though I would recommend doing a build of ParaView without the GUI. Yes this will require learning a bit of CMake (see instructions for building ParaView at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install) but it will likely be smoother for you for understanding Catalyst's capabilities. Also, it's much easier to link a simulation code with Catalyst through CMake than specifying all of the include directories and libraries. When you're looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues on HPC machines too).

Best,

Andy

Hi All,

 

I?m interesting in trying to compile Paraview Catalyst. I understand that there are ?Editions? of the Catalyst library that vary in the amount of functions that are included from the Paraview library. That?s about the extent of my knowledge about the actual source for the Catalyst library. The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.  If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system? The best documentation that I have found for building Paraview is (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code), and I?m having trouble getting Paraview to build from the instructions(I?ve never used cmake before).

Has anyone who has successfully built the Catalyst library or knows about the process lend me any tips about how I should approach building Catalyst?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi Chris,

I believe that you can link against ParaView from a standard Makefile by using the `paraview-config` executable that gets built when building ParaView. An example of how to do this is something like this:

ifeq "$(USE_PARAVIEW)" "true"
	PARAVIEW_CONFIG = $(PARAVIEW)/bin/paraview-config
	LIBS += $(shell $(PARAVIEW_CONFIG) --libs --python vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkPVServerManagerRendering vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer) -lparaview -Lparaview_catalyst/Adaptor-build -lMPASAdaptor
endif

I should mention, it is much easier to use CMake ;)

T.J.

If you're just getting started though I would recommend doing a build of ParaView without the GUI. Yes this will require learning a bit of CMake (see instructions for building ParaView at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install>) but it will likely be smoother for you for understanding Catalyst's capabilities. Also, it's much easier to link a simulation code with Catalyst through CMake than specifying all of the include directories and libraries. When you're looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues on HPC machines too).

I understand that there are ?Editions? of the Catalyst library that vary in the amount of functions that are included from the Paraview library. That?s about the extent of my knowledge about the actual source for the Catalyst library. The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.  If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system? The best documentation that I have found for building Paraview is (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code) <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code)>, and I?m having trouble getting Paraview to build from the instructions(I?ve never used cmake before).

Subject: [Paraview] animating .. a single point's traverse in time
Message-ID: <E57E6D5F-5792-46E1-9A04-CCE95F972566@email.arizona.edu>

Hi folks,

I have an exceedingly simple thing I?d like to be able to animate in Paraview, and I can?t seem to figure out how.  I?m thinking it?s stunningly easy, but I just can?t see it!

I am working with some agricultural remote sensing data.   My data input format is very, very simple ? just a plain vanilla /csv file.  Embedded in that file, are the Northing/Easting coordinates of a GPS equipped tractor as it moves through several fields, bearing sensors and acquiring data as it goes.  For starters, it is desired to produce an animation showing the path of the tractor as it moves.  There are approx. 20,000 points in the file.  I?d like to create some sort of simple terrain backdrop for the ?map? and then show the path of the tractor, frame by frame, based on coordinates provided on each row of the csv file.  What would be the easiest way to go about this?

The file also contains sensor data values from a set of identical scanners positioned in a straight row on a large ?boom? which is centered on the tractor.  (a linear detector array, essentially).  One reason to animate the path as the tractor moves, is to see at what frame the tractor turns around to take the next pass between the rows of the field it is scanning.  I eventually want to visualize the sensor values on the boom as it moves, I imagine as some sort of heat map.  Each sensor location is only known as relative to the tractor center.  So, when the tractor turns around? the location of each sensor relative to the known location (the GPS value from the tractor) changes sign in one axis.

I appreciate input on how you might go about this seemingly simple task.   Perhaps Paraview is not the right tool for the job and I ought to look at something else?  I suspect this project might build up into additional variables and such, so I thought it might be well served by Paraview in the long run.

Sorry for the noise...

After fetching (instead of pulling) from the repo,
the configuration was successful...

Subject: [Paraview] Can't see Catalyst examples' output
Message-ID: <D156E9A6-2A86-4C2C-8A8F-6D3D4DD8E714@snumerics.com>

Hi,

 

I recently compiled a version of Paraview using the command:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH:BOOL=YES -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI:BOOL=OFF -DVTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL2 -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_CATALYST_ADAPTERS:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_AnalyzeNIfTIIO:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_ArrowGlyph:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_CDIReader:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_EyeDomeLighting:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_GMVReader:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_GeodesicMeasurement:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_H5PartReader:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_InSituExodus:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_MantaView:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_Moments:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_NonOrthogonalSource:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_PacMan:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_PointSprite:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_RGBZView:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SLACTools:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SciberQuestToolKit:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SierraPlotTools:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_StreamingParticles:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SurfaceLIC:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_ThickenLayeredCells:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_UncertaintyRendering:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_AcceleratedAlgorithms:BOOL=OFF -DVTK_USE_CXX11_FEATURES:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/neal/software/ParaView_build /home/neal/software/ParaView

 

Then ?make?.


I then compiled the Catalyst examples in a separate directory using:? cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/neal/software/ParaView_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON /home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/

The cmake process throws no errors, and when I type ?make? it compiles without throwing any errors as well. If I go to a directory that has an example executable and run the executable I see no output generated at all. I even copied over the ?SampleScripts? directories that were in the examples source to the directories with the executables and they still generate no output. Has anyone seen this behavior before when trying to run the Catalyst examples?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Thank you T.J! I think I understand what the paraview-config does(and it?s awesome). How would I know which library keywords(vtkPVPythonCatalyst, vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer,etc) that I need to specify? Is there a list maintained somewhere of the available options?? Also, your example provides the method for obtaining the library list to link to. Is there a way to get the list of header files to include with the ?I flag in a Makefile?

Thank you,

Chris

Hi Chris,

 

I believe that you can link against ParaView from a standard Makefile by using the `paraview-config` executable that gets built when building ParaView. An example of how to do this is something like this:

 

ifeq "$(USE_PARAVIEW)" "true"
??????????? PARAVIEW_CONFIG = $(PARAVIEW)/bin/paraview-config
??????????? LIBS += $(shell $(PARAVIEW_CONFIG) --libs --python vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkPVServerManagerRendering vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer) -lparaview -Lparaview_catalyst/Adaptor-build -lMPASAdaptor
endif

I should mention, it is much easier to use CMake ;)

 

Sincerely,

T.J.

Thanks T.J. Your suggestions has resolved the VTK issue. I did not know that it was a submodule. I just learned that submodules exist from this actually haha.

I see that the examples for Catalyst are under the Paraview source tree. I was able to get Paraview to build with Catalyst. I compiled the examples using
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH~/software/ParaView_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON  ~/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/


That seems to build all of the examples without throwing any errors.  Now if I have a small C++ code that I have written that I want to try and link with the Catalyst headers and library files, is there a way to figure out what the command that was used to build the example cases was so that I can copy it? Reading the makefiles that are generated by cmake hasn?t been too helpful for me i.e. I can?t find the ?L and ?I sections of the compile statement that pulls the libraries and headers together.


The end-game for me is to be able to write an adaptor for a simulation code to allow it to utilize the Catalyst functions. This code uses a standard make process, and so I would like to try and avoid having to re-cast the entire build process to cmake.


Thank you,

Chris

Hi Chris,

 

VTK is a submodule under VTK, so try the following:

 

git clone https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git

git submodule init

git submodule update

?the rest of the build process.

 

Hope this helps!

Hi Chris,

Catalyst is not a separate entity from ParaView. It is a subset of ParaView that is used for in situ processing. The concept of the editions is that the subset of interest differs based on the desired in situ processing and linking your simulation code to all of ParaView Catalyst can take up a significant amount of memory. Hopefully the blog post at https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-catalyst-editions-what-are-they/ may clear up your confusion.

Best,

My understanding is that the Catalyst editions can be compiled separately from Paraview i.e. I do not need to have a version of Paraview compiled in order to compile a Catalyst edition. Is this correct?

Hi Chris,

You can get the Catalyst editions source code at http://www.paraview.org/download/ by just selecting Catalyst editions for Type of Download. If you're just getting started though I would recommend doing a build of ParaView without the GUI. Yes this will require learning a bit of CMake (see instructions for building ParaView at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install) but it will likely be smoother for you for understanding Catalyst's capabilities. Also, it's much easier to link a simulation code with Catalyst through CMake than specifying all of the include directories and libraries. When you're looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues on HPC machines too).

Best,

Andy

Hi All,

 

I?m interesting in trying to compile Paraview Catalyst. I understand that there are ?Editions? of the Catalyst library that vary in the amount of functions that are included from the Paraview library. That?s about the extent of my knowledge about the actual source for the Catalyst library. The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.  If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system? The best documentation that I have found for building Paraview is (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code), and I?m having trouble getting Paraview to build from the instructions(I?ve never used cmake before).

Has anyone who has successfully built the Catalyst library or knows about the process lend me any tips about how I should approach building Catalyst?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi Christopher,

I?m pretty sure the ?library keywords? are what ParaView refers to as ?modules?. These are defined within ParaView?s CMakeFile.txt-s as `vtk_module(###)`. If you are building a Catalyst plugin, you will probably get most of what you need by querying the vtkPVCatalyst module for its dependencies. As for the header files, I think paraview-config only gives the include directory (`paraview-config --include`). Putting this in your makefile should be sufficient for linking against ParaView.

Sincerely,
T.J.

When you're looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues on HPC machines too).

I understand that there are ?Editions? of the Catalyst library that vary in the amount of functions that are included from the Paraview library. That?s about the extent of my knowledge about the actual source for the Catalyst library. The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.  If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system? The best documentation that I have found for building Paraview is (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code) <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code)>, and I?m having trouble getting Paraview to build from the instructions(I?ve never used cmake before).

To answer my own question ? It was my mistake in handling how the examples were executed. I did not realize that the catalyst scripts located in the SampleScripts directory had to be passed directly as arguments to the executable i.e. ./CxxFullExample SampleScripts/*

On another note, has anyone run into the following error when running the CxxFullExample catalyst example?

 

~software/Catalyst_examples/CxxFullExample> ./CxxFullExample SampleScripts/*

Subject: Can't see Catalyst examples' output

 

Hi,

 

I recently compiled a version of Paraview using the command:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH:BOOL=YES -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI:BOOL=OFF -DVTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL2 -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_CATALYST_ADAPTERS:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_AnalyzeNIfTIIO:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_ArrowGlyph:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_CDIReader:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_EyeDomeLighting:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_GMVReader:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_GeodesicMeasurement:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_H5PartReader:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_InSituExodus:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_MantaView:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_Moments:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_NonOrthogonalSource:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_PacMan:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_PointSprite:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_RGBZView:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SLACTools:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SciberQuestToolKit:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SierraPlotTools:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_StreamingParticles:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SurfaceLIC:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_ThickenLayeredCells:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_UncertaintyRendering:BOOL=FALSE -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_AcceleratedAlgorithms:BOOL=OFF -DVTK_USE_CXX11_FEATURES:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/neal/software/ParaView_build /home/neal/software/ParaView

 

Then ?make?.


I then compiled the Catalyst examples in a separate directory using:  cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/neal/software/ParaView_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON /home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/

The cmake process throws no errors, and when I type ?make? it compiles without throwing any errors as well. If I go to a directory that has an example executable and run the executable I see no output generated at all. I even copied over the ?SampleScripts? directories that were in the examples source to the directories with the executables and they still generate no output. Has anyone seen this behavior before when trying to run the Catalyst examples?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling Catalyst examples from a Catalyst edition
Message-ID: <2B90D66E-71F9-4FF1-8372-0B0FE4452C60@snumerics.com>

Hello again,

 

Is it possible to compile the Catalyst examples that are in the main Paraview source tree by linking them to a Catalyst edition that has been compiled separately?? 

I did the following

1.)     downloaded the Catalyst edition and untarred it to a directory called: Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials-Extras-Rendering-Base 

2.)     Made a separate directory called: Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build, and went into that directory

3.)     I ran the following from the directory in step 2: ./../Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials/cmake.sh ../Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials

4.)     I typed ?make?

 

This process built the Catalyst edition and there were no errors.

Then I did the following
1.) Made a directory called ?Catalyst_examples?, and went into that directory

2.) Ran the following in the directory from step 1: cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials-Extras-Rendering-Base_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON /home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/
3.) I typed ?make?


When I do this I see the following error:
ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/CxxVTKPipelineExample/vtkCPVTKPipeline.cxx:12:34: fatal error: vtkPVArrayCalculator.h: No such file or directory

 #include < vtkPVArrayCalculator.h >

????????????????????????????????? ^

compilation terminated.

CxxVTKPipelineExample/CMakeFiles/CxxVTKPipelineExampleAdaptor.dir/build.make:86: recipe for target 'CxxVTKPipelineExample/CMakeFiles/CxxVTKPipelineExampleAdaptor.dir/vtkCPVTKPipeline.cxx.o' failed

make[2]: *** [CxxVTKPipelineExample/CMakeFiles/CxxVTKPipelineExampleAdaptor.dir/vtkCPVTKPipeline.cxx.o] Error 1

CMakeFiles/Makefile2:594: recipe for target 'CxxVTKPipelineExample/CMakeFiles/CxxVTKPipelineExampleAdaptor.dir/all' failed

make[1]: *** [CxxVTKPipelineExample/CMakeFiles/CxxVTKPipelineExampleAdaptor.dir/all] Error 2

Makefile:83: recipe for target 'all' failed

make: *** [all] Error 2

 

 

This error does not show up however I change the ?DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to point to the Paraview build that I have. I used ?find . ?name ?vtkPVArrayCalculator.h? in the Catalyst edition source, and it is there under /ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Default/ . How can I tell cmake to look at the Catalyst edition source for the required header files? Is there a cmake flag for that? I tried adding the CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH variable to the cmake command, but it ignored it.

Thank you,

Chris Neal

I'm guessing that the edition you're working with doesn't have that filter.
Is vtkPVArrayCalculator.h in the source directory of your Catalyst edition?

Note that for the Catalyst examples you can build them individually by
pointing CMake to each individual directory.

Subject: [Paraview] qt5 issues on OSX
Message-ID: <354481E4-18D7-4268-8246-146CC6D1CF8C@fau.de>

Hello,

I have an up-to-date OS X system (10.11) and try to compile PVSB by myself using the system clang compiler. 
I use psvb v5.1.2 and only enable paraview and qt. I compile with export VERBOSE=1

It is known, that qt4 does not compile any more with clang on OSX.

The standard qt5 version in versions.cmake is 5.4.1and results in a compile error (see below)

Changing qt5 in versions.cmake to the current 5.7.0 requires to remove 
-skip qtquick1 
-skip qtwebkit
from qt5.cmake.

It results in another compile error (see below) which is strange as qt5.7.0 compiles if I just compile the sources (with default configure and the configure from pvsb, see also below). 

According to 
https://forum.qt.io/topic/64255/compile-errors-updating-my-osx-and-qt/6 
one should configure -std=c++11 instead of -std=c++1z which I didn?t manage yet.

With the latest qt 5.6 I made the same observations as with qt 5.7.0.

With qt 5.5.1 ist works.

However I was not able to compile qt 5.5.1 on Linux with gcc 6.1 (but had no issues with 5.7.0 beside the two skips to be removed). So I?ll use 5.5.1 for OSX with clang and 5.7.0 with gcc 6.1 on Linux.

Anyway, psvb doesn?t compile on OS X 10.11 with standard clang but with the proper change in versions.cmake for qt5 it works.


????????????????????

Message-ID: <394FDAF599CCB54DA3B7096E19D1B99AED00E8@CINMBCNA09.e2k.ad.ge.com>

Hi,

I have been using Paraview to display my unstructured data in vtu files.

Paraview gives me an error when I try to open a large vtu file (>6GB):
a reader for ".....vtu" could not be found, plesase choose one:
(followed by lists of file types, ....)


Any ideas on how to open large vtu files?

Thanks,
GZ

Thanks for reporting, Fabian. Please stay tuned. We'll be working on
making the superbuild work with Qt5 better in coming days as we
official migrate to Qt 5.

There still seems to be something misconfigured deep down in the
Superbuild configuration files.    We saw this in the 5.1.0 build as well.
        The install directory has install/lib/paraview-5.0 rather than
install/lib/paraview-5.1.   I downloaded clean Superbuild source directory
before this build ?..

Strange.  I built with Superbuild yesterday, and used install, and here is what I get for the libraries:

/.../lib/paraview-5.1

Note that my build is behind a firewall, thus I have to hand copy everything manually.  Could this be the difference?

There still seems to be something misconfigured deep down in the
Superbuild configuration files.    We saw this in the 5.1.0 build as well.
        The install directory has install/lib/paraview-5.0 rather than
install/lib/paraview-5.1.   I downloaded clean Superbuild source directory
before this build ?..

Yes, the changes to both of those files are in place.

Here?s what I ran prior to the build:

git clone http://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git
cd ParaViewSuperbuild
git checkout v5.1.2



I then ran cmake using cmake-3.5.2

I can see that the build is using the 5.1.2 tar ball

Can you confirm that your ParaView superbuild has this commit

Not sure, but I cannot reproduce the issue. Can you do this:

> mkdir -p /home/angel/PV/5.1.2/Build/install/lib/paraview-5.1

ensure that the directory is created and then try again. I wonder if
that directory is not being created for some reason.

OK - but it is creating lib/paraview-5.0  which I believe is a mistake of
some sort ?..

I can?t believe that it?s anything in my CMAKE command:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/angel/pv-test/${version} \
-Ddownload_location=`pwd`/../Downloads \
-DParaView_FROM_GIT=OFF \

You are doing a clean build, right? In an empty directory and not just
"make clean".

Utkarsh - yes I was building 5.1.2 in a totally clean directory - as I
said, I also downloaded clean SuperBuild sources prior to doing the build.

You are doing a clean build, right? In an empty directory and not just
"make clean".

Meh!   I created the lib/paraview-5.1 directory and the build gets further
along then dies again.   If I look at the output ?  the initial make is
stuffing files into lib/paraview-5.0 - then the make install seems to
correctly push to the release directory in lib/paraview-5.1

Not sure, but I cannot reproduce the issue. Can you do this:

> mkdir -p /home/angel/PV/5.1.2/Build/install/lib/paraview-5.1

ensure that the directory is created and then try again. I wonder if
that directory is not being created for some reason.

What plugins should I turn on by default?  This is done in the lib/paraview/.plugins file.  I usually turn on Moments (no idea why) and H5PartReader (for a user).  Should Surface LIC be turned on by default also?  What else?

Thanks,

I made slight change to my build script - turned GIT=OFF to GIT=ON, and I
seem to have a clean build????

Changed this:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/angel/pv-test/5.1.2 \
-Ddownload_location=`pwd`/../Downloads \
DParaView_FROM_GIT=OFF \
-DParaView_URL=`pwd`/../Downloads/ParaView-v5.1.2.tar.gz \
?


to this:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/angel/pv-test/${version} \
-Ddownload_location=`pwd`/../Downloads \
DParaView_FROM_GIT=ON \
-DParaView_URL=git://www.paraview.org/files/v5.1/ParaView-v5.1.2.tar.gz \
?.

Rick/All,
Here is what I do, which worked.  Not sure if it will help, but here it is.  I am behind a firewall, and cannot pull from git with SuperBuild.  This is on clusters.

    '-DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF '+\

I made slight change to my build script - turned GIT=OFF to GIT=ON, and I seem to have a clean build????

Changed this:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/angel/pv-test/5.1.2 \ -Ddownload_location=`pwd`/../Downloads \ DParaView_FROM_GIT=OFF \ -DParaView_URL=`pwd`/../Downloads/ParaView-v5.1.2.tar.gz \ ?

Utkarsh - yes I was building 5.1.2 in a totally clean directory - as I said, I also downloaded clean SuperBuild sources prior to doing the build.

You are doing a clean build, right? In an empty directory and not just "make clean".

All,

I can't figure out how to do this, maybe it's possible.   People get multiple views up with a different model in each and they would like to link ColorArrayName so that they can paint each with a variable, then change 1 window to a different variable and have all windows update.   I have tried a few View links, but haven't achieved this.

Also linking Plot Data filters doesn't seem to do much.   If it's possible to select different variables to plot, etc and get linked Plot Data filters to sync, I haven't found that either.

Thanks for looking

Dennis

Less the better. Since users cannot "unload" plugins loaded by
default,it's better to keep the list minimal. Users can always change
a plugin to be automatically loaded, if they tend to use it
frequently.

Thank you for your answer Utkash!

In this context, what is the texturePlane variable? Also, how can I add the
created plane with texture to the pipeline?

Is there any documentation on these functions or the interaction between
VTK and ParaView?  I'd like to try to figure out how to do what I want to
do without having to bother you guys on the list.

Thank you!

Hello. AFAIK, there is no any elementary filter to do it. I usually create
a Density*Velocity and Density*Velocity*Scalar variables in Calculators and
then apply an Integrate variable filter.  It integrates by area so I get
Rho*W*dF and Rho*W*Scalar*dF integrals. Dividing second by first I get mass
flow average of Scalar. Velocity must be a normal to control surface
component.

Message-ID: <CAMGPr0XFArfaM1nB9+cpiGTDPGi_Sfqvopj8YxH4RUPGUdS5mA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I'm trying to read a jpeg file using python to use in a plane as a texture,
I have this:

        from paraview.vtk.vtkIOImage import vtkImageReader2Factory
        reader =
vtkImageReader2Factory.CreateImageReader2("/home/silencer/example.jpg")

This doesn't display any errors when executing from the paraview python
console, but when displaying reader (by entering "reader" in the console)
it displays nothing so I guess it's null. I've made sure the jpg file is in
that path.
According to the documentation (
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkImageReader2Factory.html) If no
reader is found, null is returned. I guess that's what's happening?

I've tried using

from paraview.vtk.vtkIOImage import vtkJPEGReader

but it was a shot in the dark. It didn't work, anyway :(

Do you know what could be happening?

thank you!
Rodrigo

Message-ID: <CAOmyp+QwnJEkAMv40GboZZdJND9WqqiNyEEqOYwLsavEiVx=Uw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

When one clicks the 'Edit' button for the Lights section in the Properties
tab, the default behavior when [Enter] is pressed, is to reset all of the
settings.


As an example, if I were to change the Key light's Elevation, then hit
[Enter], the value gets reset.  This has bitten me more than once when I've
made a handful of changes, and then accidentally hit [Enter] just to have
all of my changes reset.


It would be nice to have behavior consistent with the other Paraview dialog
boxes.  This is on OS X (El Capitan).  I don't know if this is the behavior
on Windows/Linux/other...

So there is clearly something different going on with the Superbuild
depending on whether or not git is enabled in the cmake command.

If git is turned off :
-DParaView_FROM_GIT=OFF \
-DParaView_URL=git://www.paraview.org/files/v5.1/ParaView-v5.1.2.tar.gz

The the ?make? process will dutifully download the tar ball and start
processing, but installing the libraries in lib/paraview-5.0

However, if GIT is enable, there seems to be additional processing going
on, specifically additional patches related to VTK?
Here?s the output if -DParaView_FROM_GIT=ON \

I made slight change to my build script - turned GIT=OFF to GIT=ON, and I
seem to have a clean build????

Changed this:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/angel/pv-test/5.1.2 \
-Ddownload_location=`pwd`/../Downloads \
DParaView_FROM_GIT=OFF \
-DParaView_URL=`pwd`/../Downloads/ParaView-v5.1.2.tar.gz \
?


to this:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/angel/pv-test/${version} \
-Ddownload_location=`pwd`/../Downloads \
DParaView_FROM_GIT=ON \
-DParaView_URL=git://www.paraview.org/files/v5.1/ParaView-v5.1.2.tar.gz \

Utkarsh - yes I was building 5.1.2 in a totally clean directory - as I
said, I also downloaded clean SuperBuild sources prior to doing the build.

You are doing a clean build, right? In an empty directory and not just
"make clean".

You don't need a particular named array, but you do need to change the
"Region Array Name" from "material" to
"name-or-your-cell-aligned-integer-valued-material-array".

Darn. Looks like there is a bug somewhere in
vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter's treatment of 2D cells. Please file a bug
report and reference this conversation in the report to help reproduce.

In the attached state file, change Mandelbrot1's extent from 0,25 0,25,
0,25 to 0,25 0,25, 0,0 to demonstrate.

Andy,

Thanks again.

I don't think that there are any gaps, slicing the dataset surely doesn't
seem to indicate that to me. I don't follow you with respect to using the
clip filter to 'convert the AMR grid to an unstructured grid with hex
cells' What does that mean? I use the clip filter a lot, but for isolating
parts of the mesh that I'm particularly interested in. Am I missing
something here?

I'll attach a state file demonstrating the issue I'm seeing on a much
simpler example case as well as the data. Maybe you'll have some time to
glance at it and point out my blunder? This case has three dimensional flow
but you'll notice how the streamlines simply terminate in the middle of the
flow field for no apparent reason, usually where elements in the grid
change level.

I do sincerely appreciate your help here. It would help me out a lot if you
could help me figure out how to make nice streamlines with this kind of
data.

Cheers,

Ethan Alan

I hope this time is ok 
the vtk file is the flow solution,the csv file is the particle data

Your data does not seem to be correctly formated. 
Can you send me an associated pvsm file ?

Dear Mathieu, 
i have installed cmake and qt in order to use cmake command to convert to .vtp. However,i need to add some additional packages which i am not familiar with. 
So, instead of converting to .vtp, i am sending you in zip form two files with different formats, vtk and csv respectively, files which i have loaded to paraview and being able to animate them using glyph. they are few KB each, it is the minimum i could do in order to keep the example as simple as possible for possible extension later on. 
Sincerely,

Please keep the ml in the loop so everyone can follow this. 

Please open you csv data, save it as a .vtp file and send it to me (if it's not too big)

Hello Mathieu, 
i have applied the Temporal ParticlePath filter,however i havent seen any change. I mean, when i apply glyph to the input data, i can activate this filter and apply it to the input data,either vtk or csv point data. 
However, i havent managed yet to see trajectories of the particles, only the position of the particle or particles at a specific time step.I have searched and I have seen in other posts in the forum referring to the same issue, that the operation interface of the newest vesrion of paraview is different than the previous ones for the specific function. Can you guide me pls if you can? :) 

Thanks again, 
Kostas

Hello 

You should have a look to ParticlePath filter.

Hi, 
i am having a problem on plotting the trajectory of a single particle at the top of a flow solution. Particularly, i have a csv file, which is named text0000.csv,inside which i have 4 columns, x,y,z, t.in addition, i have additional files text0001.csv,text0002.csv etc, with one row each( variables' values at each time step) 
When i load them to the paraview project,i have no problem on performing the animation.However, i also want to have particle's trajectory while it evolves, that is,having lines connecting the updated points with the previous ones. But i havent managed to do that yet. I have installed a paraview version 5.0.1. pls help me,what i should do?
