Subject: [Paraview] Use IPython with paraview instead of PVPython
Message-ID: <000201c8c3a5$4dbc10d0$0501a8c0@jonathanpc>

Hi,
 
How can I use Paraview's python scripting library from IPython instead of
PVPython ?
 
Regards,
 
Jonathan.

If you setup you PYTHONPATH properly, you can import the paraview
python modules directly. Here is what I have my PYTHONPATH set to:

/Users/berk/Work/paraview3-build/bin:/Users/berk/Work/paraview3-build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping:/Users/berk/Work/PythonScripts

This is a : separated list. The first entry is the build directory of
ParaView, this is so that the shared libraries can be imported. The
second one is where the paraview modules are. The third one is my own
modules. For this to work, you have to make sure that you compile
paraview against the same python as ipython uses.

SetParameters takes to char* and copies them directly into the script as 
a global define. So yes if you want to pass in string properties the end 
user has to actually quote them selves.

The other problem is that SetParameters are only done once so you cannot 
change the parameters you send to the python interpreter between the 
RequestInformation script and the RequestData script.

Recently I solved this problem by making a child of the 
PythonProgrammableFilter and passing in memory references of objects, 
like how it gets 'self' into the script. Once this was working it 
allowed me to share information between the qt panel, 
RequestInformation, and RequestData. We had a major problem though than 
with the delete code in PythonProgrammableFilter, but it works now.

That would be very cool. And if the pytables (http://www.pytables.org)
library would be available in a next version of paraview, then all the
people trying to load their own special hdf5 based files could easily
write a reader.

Or, as you're using Debian, you can use pinning to prevent apt from  
updating Qt. See e.g. [1] or ask google.

I would hate a bundled Qt because it is a large beast and if everybody  
starts doing it we end up in Windows-Land where every program comes  
with the full set of libraries it depends on, cluttering the system  
until it's so broken only a clean install can solve the problems...

That's an excellent idea. I made a note of it. If you don't hear about
anything happening in a month or so, please remind me anyway. Another
possibility is to expose the python bindings of Xdmf.

I agree with Michael that it is not a good idea to bundle Qt with
ParaView. I was not happy with bundling Tcl/Tk despite the fact that
they are pretty small compared to Qt. I think we will try to keep up
with Qt better in the future. We may officially support a specific
version but we will try new version as they come out and make sure
that they compile at least.

Hi,

Is bundling VTK not falling into the same category?

In my opinion it is (although one might argue it's not "third-party",  
but then what does THAT matter?).

Perhaps that would be something for you guys at kitware? Provide  
different downloads: one with no dependencies, the other with VTK  
bundled? Or no VTK included and leave it to the user to either install  
it beforehand or untar it in the right place so the paraview build  
process can build VTK the way it does now.

I still wouldn't include Qt though...

In a way, I suppose. However, keep in mind that VTK and ParaView
release cycles are completely different. VTK is released at most once
per year (and it is almost a miracle when that happens) whereas
ParaView is released 3-4 times per year. If we were stuck with the
latest version of VTK (5.0 from 2 years ago), we would end up bundling
a lot of improvements and bug fixes for VTK in ParaView. This would
make the development a major pain and the migration of improvements
from ParaView to VTK would almost never happen. Maybe one day, if the
release cycles are close AND VTK is as widely distributed as Qt, we
can stop bundling VTK.

Subject: [Paraview] Read an IntVectorProperty
Message-ID: <c9adba420806020655x305182c5r73ecb2ce6b7bf291@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have created my own object panel deriving from pqObjectPanel.  My plugin
needs to check that the meshing program is in the path.  In my
ServerManagerConfiguration XML file I have the following:

8<----------------------------------------------------
...
<IntVectorProperty
                    name="ValidExeInfo"
                    command="isExecutableValid"
                    information_only="1">
      <Documentation>
          This returns whether a valid executable has been selected.
      </Documentation>
</IntVectorProperty>
...
---------------------------------------------------->8

In my ObjectPanel class I use the following to check it:

QVariant v =
pqSMAdaptor::getElementProperty(proxy()->GetProperty("ValidExeInfo"));

This isExecutableValid function (defined as "int isExecutableValid()") is
never called.  Am I doing something wrong?  This method works for
StringVectorProperty...

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

For information properties to work, one needs what's called "Information 
helper" objects. These are instances that know how to obtain the given 
information from the server side VTK object. In your case, all you need 
is to add  <SimpleIntInformationHelper/> to the XML as follows:

<IntVectorProperty
                     name="ValidExeInfo"
                     command="isExecutableValid"
                     information_only="1">
       <SimpleIntInformationHelper/>
       <Documentation>
           This returns whether a valid executable has been selected.
       </Documentation>
</IntVectorProperty>

Are you suggesting that the PV's VTK version should be used instead of 
the 'official' one - for the 'usual' VTK coding?
Thanks,

That's not what I am suggesting, unless you are doing ParaView
development. If you are doing ParaView development, you probably
cannot use any of the VTK releases.

* If you are doing VTK development for the purpose of inclusion in
VTK, use the VTK that comes with VTK (which is what I do)
* If you are doing VTK development for any other reason, use the
latest VTK release unless
* The feature you need is not available in the latest VTK release.
Then use VTK cvs

Subject: [Paraview] xml plugins crash Windows 3.3.0 snapshot
Message-ID: <8961895D-3874-4E4F-B8FF-3A65DCFA3AD5@gmail.com>

It seems that whenever I attempt load a xml only plugin, e.g. the  
Helix example from CVS, to the Windows 3.3.0 snapshot using the plugin  
manager ParaView instantly crashes. The same plugin loads fine in the  
Linux and Mac snapshots. Is anyone else seeing this or am I missing  
some Windows specific voodoo?

Best,

It is now fixed in CVS.  Thanks for testing.

Subject: [Paraview] getElementProperty with arguments
Message-ID: <c9adba420806030809n3f7d3978se8faf7078f21e31a@mail.gmail.com>

In my pqObjectPanel I would like to be able to call a function with
parameters on my vtkAlgorithm and then get the return value.

I can do this without parameters, e.g.

In vtkAlgorithm class I have the function:
      char* GetValue();

In my xml file I have:
      <StringVectorProperty
                           name="GetValue"
                           command="GetValue"
                           information_only="1">
          <SimpleStringInformationHelper/>
      </StringVectorProperty>

And, in pqObjectPanel I have:
      QVariant v =
pqSMAdaptor::getElementProperty(this->proxy()->GetProperty("GetValue"));

So this all works but how could this be updated for a function that took a
parameter.  I have tried the following:

In vtkAlgorithm class I changed the function to take an argument:
      char* GetValue(char* arg1);

In my xml file I set the number of elements:
      <StringVectorProperty
                           name="GetValue"
                           command="GetValue"
                           number_of_elements="1"
                           information_only="1">
          <SimpleStringInformationHelper/>
      </StringVectorProperty>

I'm not sure the XML file is correct - is it still a
<SimpleStringInformationHelper>?  And finally I do not know what to do in
pqObjectPanel...

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

So you want the camera to follow the object or zoom out enough such
that the object is always visible?

Try loading the following script from the python shell (under Tools).
Watch out for line wrap. We can tweak this script to fit your needs
better.

from paraview import servermanager
sm = servermanager
rv = sm.GetRenderView().SMProxy
pm = sm.vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule()
ans = None
for i in sm.ProxyManager().GetProxiesInGroup("animation").values():
  if i.IsA("vtkSMAnimationSceneProxy"):
    ans = i
    break
if ans:
  def callback(caller, *args):
    global rv
    rv.UpdateAllRepresentations()
    rv.ResetCamera()

  print pm.GetObjectFromID(ans.GetIDAsInt()).AddObserver("AnimationCueTickEvent",
callback, 1.0)

Subject: [Paraview] libQtPython.so not installed
Message-ID: <1212530046.9366.3.camel@valhalla>

Hello, 

I just updated my ParaView3 sources from CVS today and rebuilt.  The
installed program does not run because libQtPython.so is not installed
along with the other shared libraries.  I can fix this by manually
copying the file into the proper install directory.  This must be some
sort of cmake glitch; I just wanted to report the problem.

Thanks, Julian C.

Hmmm... actually there is a large set of these shared library files that
are not being installed by the "make install" command.  I have had to
manually install several of the libvtk*.so, not just libQtPython.so.
Does anyone have any idea why the install is incomplete or how to fix
the problem using cmake?

Thanks, Julian C.

Subject: [Paraview] replacement for ProbeLocationOverTime filter?
Message-ID: <1212537431.6303.20.camel@valhalla>

There used to be a ProbeLocationOverTime filter in Paraview 3.2.1 that
could produce an XY plot of a variable value at a selected location
versus time, but this is gone in the development version of Paraview
3.3.0.  Is there a simple way to reproduce this capability in 3.3.0? 
(I recall that the ProbeLocationOverTime was very, very slow because
ParaView would try to render the data for the entire domain and each
frame in the time sequence, instead of just reading and storing the
single data value at the selected location from each time dump.)

What I *actually* want to do is slightly more complicated than this.  I
need to plot the radial displacement of a selected point along a tube
from its original position as a function of time.  The radial position
is not a field variable, but rather can be computed from the location in
the YZ plane.  (The X axis runs along the cylindrical tube in my
geometry.)  So is there a way to do a time series of each frame versus
frame 0, select a particular point in the mesh, and produce an XY plot
of the difference in radial position versus time?

Regards, Julian C.

Hello,

I am starting to evaluate paraview for a project and I am curious
about a few things:

File formats:

Does the vtk ascii format support unicode data set names?  If it
doesn't, is there a format that does?

Solution data on 2D meshes:

Does paraview allow you to display the magnitude of the solution data
as the third dimension?  If this is a filter, what is it called?

Thanks in advance.

Juan

You might be better off taking this up with the guys at TrollTech who
produce Qt.  Here is a link to their documentation that explains the
situation - http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qsettings.html (see section on
platform specific notes).  BTW I don't think there is actually a standard
place for registry settings on unix/linux.

Take a look at:

We use iniFormat settings files in ParaView.

The filter is now called "Plot Selection over time". Go to
"View | Selection Inspector" and create a new selection with "Selection 
Type": "Location" to create a location based selection. Then, create 
"Plot Selection over time" and copy the active selection to it.

One possibility is apply the Calculator to the output of the "Plot 
Selection Over Time" filter. However, you'll have to hard code the 
position at time 0 in the equation for the calculator to compute the 
displacement.

I am afraid that you will find VTK (the underlying computing layer of
ParaView) and ParaView lacking quite a bit in supporting anything but
ASCII. Can you elaborate a bit more what you need? Do you need the
whole user interface to support unicode or just the dataset names? And
what do you mean by "dataset name"? Names of the field variables?

Why are you using "iniFormat" and NOT QSettings::NativeFormat? It is  
VERY un-natural for OS X users to go looking for .config in their  
home directory. If you use QSettings::NativeFormat each platform will  
get their own "correct" usage. One small change and LOTS of people  
happy.

Unless of course there is some odd reason why ParaView can not use  
QSettings::NativeFormat and _must_ use QSettings::IniFormat?

I can't remember the reason (Clint will probably chime in) but there
was one. We started using the native format and then we switched.

There is a "fast-path" option for doing reading only the selected
element/point attributes but the reader has to support it. Currently,
only the Exodus reader supports this feature. If you have your own
reader or you are using Exodus, I can give you more information.

You may be moving into "write your own filter" territory here. I would
like to see the programmable filter support time series in the future
but it is not there yet.

When operating on windows it uses the windows AVI library to write
with 'msvc' compression.
When operating on *Nix machine, it uses the FFMPEG library to write
with  'MP43' compression.

I think it was so that people can share their settings file. Since the 
settings has things like server resources etc.

As I recall, we were worried about putting large strings into things like the windows registry.  Some of the settings we store have a larger than typical length.

Ok,
  How about this then.
   Have an "Export Settings" feature along with an "Import Settings".  
The export saves the users settings in the .ini format, which the  
importer can then read. I think this would be a better solution and  
cause less confusion among the various platforms.

   Either that OR Put the ini files in the "appropriate" place for  
each platform, which would probably require MORE work than just  
writing an import/export functionality. I guess I should file a  
feature request at this point.

For some reason I had paraview in a state where many of the top row
menu items were no longer clickable (file, edit, view).  The only way
around was to use the "-dr" option, but then I lost the ability to
retain state.

In *nix, most programs have always created a hidden file or directory
in the user's home.  This .config directory was so unnatural, that I
had to use strace to figure out where paraview was getting the
registry.

It might be helpful to document for people where they would expect to
find the registry files if something goes horribly wrong.

Thanks,

Juan

Subject: [Paraview] IMPORTATION
Message-ID: <2647d0a80806040807h719b2a01obdbd07f90ea008f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am a novice on Paraview Software but I would like using it for calculate
volume of lenses of sweet water in the ground (it is the subject of my
internship at the BGR at Hannover). In reality I already did it on Geosoft
software but I would like to try different 3D tools and Paraview seems to be
well adapted for what I want to do.
My probleme is that I do not know how to import my geosoft database in
Paraview. I can convert it into a GDB, GOCAD, UBC, or XYZ files but these
one do not seem to be suported by Paraview. Would you have an idea ? ?

Thanks for your help

Ok, I can see that thought process, but users of each OS are used to  
the way _their_ Operating system works. Having their preference file  
located in a "non-standard" location is a "surprise" to the user and  
does not make for a nice user experience. Having said that I do agree  
that if an operating system's preference system can not handle the  
data that is needed to be stored then that needs to be changed, but  
why punish all operating systems for one's failure? As a "normal" OS  
X user that is using ParaView, I would _expect_ my settings to be  
stored in ~/Library/Preferences or _Maybe_ ~/Library/ParaView or  
_possibly_ ~/Library/Application Support but NOT in .config/blah/blah/ 
blah. So the old argument comes up, what is "consistent". Should the  
app adapt to the platform or should the user adapt to the App? I  
would vote for the app to adapt to the platform. The support issues  
would be _less_ because users can help themselves because they _know_  
instinctively where to look for application settings.

I'll leave it alone as there is nothing more I can say or debate.

Everyone have a great day. :-)

Peace.

My program uses utf-8.  I want to allow users to use symbols for their
data, such as psi (u03c8) for potential, and script E (u2130) for
electric field.

I tried this with an ascii format file, and the names came up as
random characters.  I would be happy to write out in whatever encoding
and file format in order to be able to have this feature.

I don't know what that is.  I would want to plot potential or the log
of carrier density as the z coordinate.

My vote: I agree with Mike. I've written applications on Unix, Linux and VMS that use initialization files and found that it is a loosing battle to store them in non-standard places. It is *easy* for a piece of software to store them in the right place.

Small hints to the user can be a big help. 1) Whenever a new version of the initialization file is written by PV a brief popup could show its location. 2) If Qt won't play ball at least put in one of PV's "Settings" menus a note about how to find/edit the Qt settings.

You could use the warp filter (WarpScalar).

Select the direction normal to the plane and the scale factor.

I could chime in but it looks like everyone covered the issues :)

As for the Windows registry limitation, we could try to limit what we store in 
the registry and still store some things in %APPDATA% such as server 
configurations.

And there's also the servers configuration file, which doesn't get saved in 
the same file as the settings, but is in the same location.  Changing how the 
settings are saved will separate those files.
In any case, an import/export functionality on the server configuration dialog

I'd like to vote in favour of $HOME/.config - one place on all systems 
is better (for me) and much easier to edit/wipe than a registry etc...by 
all means add QSettings::NativeFormat as an option (compile time?), but 
I vote to keep the existing method as default

  I'll re-chime against that idea.
</squeaky wheel gets the oil>

If you make this a compile-time option then the support costs go up  
because you then have to know how ParaView was compiled in order to  
attempt to help someone.

Basically I am voting to change this just on OS X. On windows, the  
registry will not work and on Linux the .config seems to be the  
"standard". So we are left with just 2 places to look depending on  
Operating system.

.config is not the standard for Linux.  That freedesktop standard
someone mentioned isn't yet a common standard.  I have many more
hidden files in my home directory than in my .config directory:

I wouldn't object to keeping it in the .config directory, as long as
it is documented where the registry files are located.

I started using paraview and have a question regarding the textures. I
loaded the texture onto a plane and want to save the data along with the
texture in .vtk format. Could anyone assist me. TIA.

Subject: [Paraview] seg fault when loading pvd file
Message-ID: <1212606484.6265.31.camel@valhalla>

Hello,

I am getting a segmentation fault from the latest cvs version of
paraview 3.3.0 when loading what I believe is an innocuous PVD file (see
attached).  Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?  The seg fault
occurs when I click the Apply button after loading the file.  BTW, I
have a similar PVD file that loads a short series of VTU files (rather
than VTK files), and that one loads just fine.  Also, I can load my VTK
files series using the "legacy file series" approach just fine also, but
I wanted to use the PVD file approach in order to get the correct "time"
information loaded with each data file.

Thanks, Julian C.

PVD files cannot use vtk files. To see a list of what they can use look at the end of <src>/Servers/Filters/vtkXMLCollectionReader.cxx

Unfortunately, you have to keep the texture on a separate file.

Yes. Select what you want in the pipeline browser, apply the append
geometry filter and save it's output.

Could someone post a feature request in the bug tracker for pvd
support for legacy vtk files (as well as any other "simple" formats)?
I think it would be relatively easy to do this.

I checked out the CVS tree from the repository. I made some
modifications, built and installed Paraview with vs8 2005. Now I need
to distribute these same changes to multiple machines. Is there a
project in the paraview solution to generate the windows installer
(.exe)? If not and I do the install by hand (copy directory to each
machine and setup shortcuts), are there any registry keys that need to
be created for the install to be complete?

Could someone post a feature request in the bug tracker for pvd support for legacy vtk files (as well as any other "simple" formats)?
I think it would be relatively easy to do this.

I'd be interested in what is referred to as the legacy file format and
has the header:
# vtk DataFile Version 3.1

Since QT has native unicode support, I'd be interested in seeing how
hard it would be to allow utf-8 scalar names.  I would consider either
writing vtk files in utf-8 or in escape sequences (e.g. \u03c8).

I'd be happy to provide a patch or a plugin enabling such a capability.

Regards,

Juan

Start with vtkDataSetReader. That class points to bunch of other
classes. Just  a word of caution: it is not a straightforward task. I
would estimate that it would take someone a few months of effort to
fully, properly integrate unicode support to VTK and ParaView.

Julian,

Please keep the Q&A on the list so all can see. Try setting the "timestep" attribute in the PVD file to the actual time instead of an integer.

Yes, that's what I was doing and that is why I ran into the trouble with
loading a series of legacy VTK files via a PVD file.

I have finally solved my problem now.  I googled around and found a
Python script posted online that automatically converts a series of
legacy VTK files into a series of VTU files and a corresponding PVD
file.  You can find this Python script here:
http://ait.web.psi.ch/services/visualization/paraview_python.html

There is still the trouble of getting the real time values into the
"timestep" attribute, so I tweaked the script to read those values from
a separate ASCII text file into a Python array and then write them into
the PVD file.  Now I am getting what I wanted.

Regards, Julian C.

That's not true, there are quite a few apps which do so (parts of GTK 
+, Totem and XFCE use it, just to name some). And actually I prefer  
that place, because it helps remove the clutter from my home.

To follow the standard, it shouldn't even be a hard-coded ~/.config,  
but use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME instead with ~/.config as a fall-back if that  
environment variable is not set.

In many places. There are a few ways of getting field (array) names.
One is through a class called vtkPVInformation. Another one through
vtkSMArraySelectionDomain. Another one, probably, through
vtkSMArrayListDomain. Happy digging.

Cool. I am glad it worked.

Hi folks,

We recently discovered that due to an oversight on our part, ParaView
3.2.1 could not be configured using CMake 2.6. I just made a new patch
release that fixes the problem (3.2.2). Since there is really no
functional change, I did not create new binaries. I posted new source
archives as well as updated the cvs tag.

Audrey,

I noticed that the file formats you mentioned are for geographic information.  I forwarded your question to the folks on the Titan project, some of whom are working on geographic views in the VTK/ParaView framework.  So far, no one has found the specifications for these file formats.

I've heard of them but don't have any idea where to obtain the
specifications for them. None of those appear to be supported by GDAL
(http://www.gdal.org/) either, which is the library I had planned to
eventually use for reading raster geovis data (but have nothing yet).

I work for Mirarco who is currently developing paraview-geo, whose 
website is at paraviewgeo.mirarco.org.

While we are currently still in development, we have already developed a 
GoCad reader, and are actually currently working on a Geosoft reader.  I 
will talk to my boss and see if I can send you a distribution of our 
latest development snapshot.

I am guessing that this is not the only place you are getting that
warning? So the main problem is in the assembler? It looks like a
compiler bug to me... Did you experiment with different optimization
options?

Message-ID: <92f19da0806051042t13d7ad59j50151487f5424657@mail.gmail.com>

I was going to use implement a vtk writer for my program.  I would
like to use the vtk ascii datafile format.  A few questions:

1. I have multiple regions.  Some of these regions share coordinates
at an interface.  Do I have to average the data on both sides of the
interface, or is there a way to put 2 values at the same point?  Will
paraview complain about duplicate coordinates (collinear points)?

2. Some data fields only exist in certain regions.  Does that mean I
have to set 0 values in the regions the field does not exist?

3. I have points, lines, and triangles.  If I put data on lines, does
that mean I have to define the same data fields on all of the other
cell types in my design as well?  For example, I have current flowing
along lines, but not through triangles.  So it wouldn't make sense to
have current data defined for the triangles.

Thanks,

Juan

No, indeed this error happens more than once, see below. Using the same 
compiler I was able to compile CVS version dated 20080505 without any 
problems - on a 32 bit machine. The one where the error occurs is 64bit.

I do not think this has to do with the compiler as I have seen the same 
type of error when using gcc (in google). One of the conclusions was 
that this is about non-portable code (32->64 bit). But than I saw this 
error also for 32 bits, so the conclusion does not quite hold up.

regards,
Dominik

Juan,

For what it is worth here is my 2 centavos,

First, I would consider the VTK XML data format.

Second, I have found that it works really well to consider each *.vt* 
file as an independently displayable graphics object. One then uses a 
*.pvd meta-file (an ASCII "mother" file) to get PV to read them all at once.

Parallel generated data sets are managed this way. I use this approach 
to generate separate objects based on material type. PV does not care 
(or know) that they were not generated in parallel. As independently 
displayable graphics objects, they need to have their own point sets. PV 
doesn't worry about one or more points having "matching" locations.

Each object has its own set of iso-surfaces so that on boundaries the 
data from each side is used and you get disconnected iso-surfaces which 
in my case is exactly what I want.

The question of different fields/data on different objects someone else 
will need to answer. (You can always flesh out zero's.)

The assembler error is not very helpful, I have to say :-) Maybe you
can manually have it generate the assembly code and try to figure out
which function causes this error?

It's been more than 20 years since I last coded in assembler so I am a

Hi Sam,

Thanks for the excellent ideas.

Since:
1 I have on average 2 triangles for every line.

2. And having zero data for the triangles interspersed with nonzero
data for the lines may not work out so well.

Perhaps I can have a vtk file for lines and a vtk file for triangles?

I can only find documentation online for the vtk format.  Is there
documentation for the pvd format?  The example file I saw online is
xml like, I guess this implies that I'd have to use xml for the
individual data files?

Thanks,

Juan

Hmmm. I don't see anything unusual there. Maybe this line?

  const QString connection_name = QString::number(this->id++);

Looking in the vtk file formats document, I can see that the xml
format allows multiple pieces in the same unstructured mesh.  This
should suit my purposes.

I am assuming I can have two pieces per region.  One piece would be
for point and line data.  The other piece would be for triangle data.
I assume it would be ok for the two region to share the same
coordinates?

Thanks,

Juan

John Doe,

*.pvd file is documented in the PV user's manual. Currently, the *.pvd 
file can only reference the VTK XML-formatted files. I have seen 
comments that in the future the *.pvd files will be able to reference 
some other formats.

Each file must be an independent *displayable* graphics object. An 
XML-formatted file has a point data set (coordinates). Each geometric 
entity (point, line, triangle, quadrilateral, hexahedron, et cetera is 
an integer n-tuple that references (with offsets) points that make up 
its vertexes.

All 1-D lines can be described in one set; all triangles can be 
described in another set. I am not sure that you can have different data 
on lines and triangles without using zero fill on the other geometric 
entities.

If the images you want to display consider all triangles alike and all 
lines alike, and it is important to have different data on lines and 
triangles use two files. Both files will have the same points repeated 
but PV does not care. Read in the files one after another and 
graphically process them independently.

Unless you are very familiar with "filters" and "pipe lines," and PV's 
ability to manage them it is almost impossible to describe how they work 
with words alone.

I recommend you create two toy data files, one for lines and one for 
triangles. Read them in independently and learn by trial-and-error how 
PV works. The more you use PV, the smarter it gets.

Subject: [Paraview] problem with Multi-Scale View
Message-ID: <f79365390806060943m4e7971cdmea71902090dd4550@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
i want to have different scales for x,y and z coordinates because usually in
river engineering the horizontal dimensions of problem is much larger that
its vertical dimension. i faced 2 problem for having multi-scale in
paraview:
1. when i load the dataset and adjust the scales, it does not used for the
filters i used after that and i should do the same adjustment for every
filter. this waste time and needs attention to do the same for all the
filters.
2. when i use the scaling on glyph, the scale effect the shape of arrows
which is not desirable.
Thanks,
Hadian

Hi Hadian

You could transform the data. This actually modifies the data, so it 
will not cause the effects you mention.

(pv: Filters -> Transform -> Scale x,y,z)

Thanks, i somehow solve the problem. i will more appreciate if someone 
can suggest another solution that does not transform the data.
another question, how can i show the x,y and z axis ?

Hi
a problem i have with transform filter is that my data sets are cell
center and i should use "cell center to point data" filter so i can
use streamline filter. after using transform filter the streamline
filter does not work.

We have a feature request to change the behavior tranforms. In the
next version of ParaView, filters will "inherit" the settings of their
input, including the transform. This should address most of your
problem. I am not sure how to address the glyph scaling issue. The
right solution is to add support for transforms to datasets and have
all filters work properly with it. This is major change so it is
unlikely to happen any time soon. Why do you not want to use the
transform filter?

You can use the the cube axes to show the axes. It is turned on from
the display page. It is very configurable so make sure to check all
the settings.

How about just changing the Scale in 'Display' tab? (Without transforming
the data, is it really possible?)

How about checking 'Show cube axes' in display tab?

Subject: [Paraview] a minor problem with Sources->Point Source
Message-ID: <20080609.085637.141665040.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

This time a minor problem with Source->Point Source. Select
Sources->Point Source, enter non-origin point e.g. (1 2 3) to Point,
enter either Number of Points other than 1 or Radius other than 0,
click Apply. Then the Point is reset to (0 0 0). However if I re-enter
the point, this time the point coordinates are set as expected. Not a
big problem but would be nice to have it fixed?

Message-ID: <8e0b87a90806091405g1f07fcyd3da9d485d319be7@mail.gmail.com>

The Windows build of Paraview (3.2.1 and 3.3.0) fails reading an
uncompressed raw appended binary image data file (VTI) if the image size is
bigger than total of 128 elements. Here are two sample files for
verification:

7x4x4.vti <http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/pv/7x4x4.vti> - ok
8x4x4.vti <http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/pv/8x4x4.vti> - fail

First one is a 7-by-4-by-4 image, second is 8-by-4-by-4. Each one has 2
scalar point data arrays, named `u' and `v', in little endian Float64.
Paraview unix builds successfully read both data files.

Here is the error I get on Windows with 8x4x4.vti after Open -> Apply:

ERROR: In
C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx, line
314

vtkXMLImageDataReader (05E460A8): Error reading extent 0 7 0 3 0 3 from
piece 0

ERROR: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line
497

vtkXMLImageDataReader (05E460A8): Cannot read point data array "u" from
PointData in piece 0. The data array in the element may be too short.
[ repeats 5 more times ]


Can anyone confirm?

thanks

This happens only with ParaView? Only with cvs ParaView?

I followed the reader in the debugger. It looks like the header of the
u block is corrupt. The length of the array does not look right.

Message-ID: <03905C03-C87D-47D0-A796-8124498E034B@videotron.ca>

Hi,

I've been browsing on the net for some time but cannot find the answer  
for this question :

- Is it possible to display (annotate some text on the screen) to show  
the x,y,z components of a) the coordinates of
some points and b) the components of a normal vector that define a  
plane surface ?

I'm using both versions 3.2.1 and 3.3. Please let me know if you have  
a solution to suggest.

Best regards,

Pierre-Olivier

Message-ID: <c9adba420806100506u30deb134ld0eb5a18420b2150@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to use a subclass of TransformFilter in one other Filters
(subclass of vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm) in the RequestData method.
 The RequestData looks like this:

8<----------------------------------------------------------
int vtkFilter::RequestData(vtkInformation* info,
		vtkInformationVector** vector,
		vtkInformationVector* outputVector)
{
        vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
        vtkMultiBlockDataSet* output = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(
            outInfo0->Get(vtkMultiBlockDataSet::DATA_OBJECT()));

	vtkSmartPointer<vtkMyMultiBlockDataSetReader> reader =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkMyMultiBlockDataSetReader>::New();
	// setup reader here...
        // .....
	vtkSmartPointer<vtkXYZTransformFilter> transform =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXYZTransformFilter>::New();
	transform->SetInput(reader->GetOutput());
	transform->Update();
	output->ShallowCopy(transform->GetOutput());
        return 1;
}
---------------------------------------------------------->8

This filter above will work without the transform and the transform
works as a filter in paraview but when I have it as above I get the
following error:

8<----------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: In /home/paul/workspace/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkExecutive.cxx,

Can anyone see what I am doing wrong?

Try setting transform's Executive to a new instance of
vtkCompositeDataPipeline. I suspect that the default executive created
for the algorithm is a vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline, which does
not know how to iterate over all of the blocks.

Subject: [Paraview] opengl extension manager issue
Message-ID: <484E757F.3020608@cscs.ch>

Can anyone tell me why Cmake/ParaView fail to generate the correct 
opengl stuff

/users/biddisco/code/pv/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx: In 
member function `virtual void (* 
vtkOpenGLExtensionManager::GetProcAddress(const char*))()':
/users/biddisco/code/pv/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx:267: 
error: `glXGetProcAddressARB' was not declared in this scope
make[2]: *** 
[VTK/Rendering/CMakeFiles/vtkRendering.dir/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.o] 
Error 1
make[1]: *** [VTK/Rendering/CMakeFiles/vtkRendering.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I have had this problem for ever and I have finally decided I don't 
understand why I get it sometimes, but not others.

if I wipe vtkOpenGLExtensionManagerConfigure and vtkParseOpenGLExt - the 
files are regenerated - but usually wrongly - wopuld one expect the 
results to be differnt if they are generated with/without a display?

Any ideas?

JB

I've added the SetExecutable call in there and it has got rid of the
first two errors, but it still says:

BTW Here is my modified requestData:

int vtkFilter::RequestData(vtkInformation* info,
               vtkInformationVector** vector,
               vtkInformationVector* outputVector)

       vtkSmartPointer<vtkMyMultiBlockDataSetReader> reader =

       // setup reader here...
       // .....
       vtkSmartPointer<vtkXYZTransformFilter> transform =

       vtkSmartPointer<vtkCompositeDataPipeline> pipeline =

       transform->SetInput(reader->GetOutput());
       transform->Update();

       return 1;

Yes. Using selection and selection annotation you can do this. Once
you select a set of surface cells, you can turn on labeling in the
Selection Inspector. To get the surface normals, you may have to apply
the surface normals filter first.

Can you post the source code for the transform filter? It is somehow
failing (returning 0) during RequestDataObject() (which may be in the
superclass). Do you have that method implemented by any chance?

I wonder if somehow a #define is screwing up symbols... Maybe you
could run the prepocessor and see if its output has anything unusual?

You can select which array to label by in the selection inspector. I
realized that point coordinates is not an option there. Can you submit
a feature request here: http://paraview.org.Bug? As a temporary work
around, you can use the array calculator to copy the point coordinates
into an attribute. Set the expression to be coords.

All I do is set the transform in the constructor and I just want to
use a transform as a filter....

I must be doing something wrong as I just realised that I was not
freeing the vtkCylindricalTransform - now I also get a seg fault after
the warning:

The seg fault is because I just used the C++ delete rather than the
VTK version, i.e. this->Transform->Delete() in the destructor.  So, I
still have this error:

I am guessing it is failing in
vtkPointSetAlgorithm::RequestDataObject(). Try putting a breakpoint
there.

Message-ID: <484E9B0C.3060800@gmail.com>

I am currently working with multiblock datasets, and was wondering if 
there was a way to give each block of the dataset a name and use that 
for display purposes in pqProxyInformationWidget. The only way it seems 
I can do this is to make a fake field entry and use its name. Does 
anybody know of a better way?

There is a test for this symbol in VTK/Rendering/CMakeLists.txt and it seems that it is defined by PV if not found in GL/glx.h. A comment says that the GL include files are sometimes different.

Is it possible that different versions of glx.h were used between running cmake and running make?

That's a great feature that I'd never noticed before!

Is there any way to get it to update the labels (using the same  
selection) when switching to a new time point or during an animation?

Thanks,

What does it do currently? Reset the selection?

The points appear to still be selected, and still show up in the  
selection inspector, but the labels stay where they were and are not  
updated to the current point positions on the screen or currently  
appropriate label values. You then have to change something about the  
properties in the selection inspector pane to get labels to update.

Can you be a bit more specific? What is the length you read, what is it that
you expect (in what binary format you expect the number 128)? Well, the
thing is I highly doubt that the data itself is corrupt, because it does
work on some systems. I might be wrong. Please read on.

First off, I did some more checks with whatever build I have access to. It
turns out it is not just the Win32 build:

system / PV version / can load file 8x4x4.vti?
Linux (ubuntu hardy) x86_64 / 3.3.0 / yes
Linux (ubuntu hardy) x86_64 / 3.2.1 / yes
MacOSX x86_32 / 3.2.1 / yes
Linux (ubuntu gutsy) x86_32 / 3.2.1 / no
Windows XP x86_32 / 3.2.1 / no

Based on this pattern, it seems to me quite unlikely that my data file is
corrupt. Just in case here is how I encode the raw binary (although it is
the simplest to use format, it is not a fully documented one and I had to
ask for help here in the mail group and iterate a number of times to get it
"right"):

[ header ]
<AppendedData encoding="raw"> _
[Number of elements in the array, in 4 byte BIG ENDIAN integer]
[BinaryData with precision and endianness as specified in the header]
[ .. more of the same for each record..]
</AppendedData>

(note: there are no line breaks or any other extra space after `_' in the
actual file)

To discover (for it was undocumented) that a 4 byte number of elements
should precede each record and should be a BIG ENDIAN integer regardless of
the endianness of rest of the binary data was quite a thrill (to say the
least!). Although there is still room in some mysterious way that I might be
wrong with this discovery; this is what works in Linux 64bit builds for any
file and all builds for small data (<128 elements). Can someone please
enlighten the situation? What is it with this data format?


thanks,
Levent

I need help about using Paraview with base-64 binaries.
I would like to know which is the right format to use. I mean: I wrote a

The problem is with binaries.

I don't know of any "built-in" way to add a name to blocks in composite data
sets, but if I were to implement it, I would put the name in the
vtkInformation object that is contained in each node in the composite data
set and all of the data set leaves.

Berk, do you want to add anything to that.  You have been thinking more
about what "metadata" should be stored and where to store it.

It is implemented exactly as Ken described and does what you need. For
an example, look at vtkEnSightReader.cxx and search for NAME().

I debugged on Mac OS X. I put a breakpoint right before the error occurs:

I follow the code until it starts reading the array:

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
vtkXMLDataParser::OffsetType
vtkXMLDataParser::ReadUncompressedData(unsigned char* data,
                                       OffsetType startWord,
                                       OffsetType numWords,
                                       int wordSize)
{
  // First read the length of the data.
  HeaderType rsize;
  const unsigned long len = sizeof(HeaderType);
  unsigned char* p = reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(&rsize);
  if(this->DataStream->Read(p, len) < len) { return 0; }
  this->PerformByteSwap(&rsize, 1, len);

At this point rsize is 2147483648. Note that len here is 4 bytes. It
looks like the reader is expecting a 4 byte block that is the size of
the block but somehow is getting junk. I cannot tell you much more
beyond that because I am not very familiar with the internals of the
file format.

I'll forward this to the develop of the readers. We'll see what he says.

Subject: [Paraview] Can Use Volume Vis with Cell Data?
Message-ID: <484EF32F.4040009@psc.edu>

The CVS version from May allows the representation to be changed to volume for a vti file with only float cell data.

But then it shows the message "Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data available." which is incorrect.

On Linux.

Subject: [Paraview] Gray scale image & calculating area with ParaView
Message-ID: <f54255b11bdb.1bdbf54255b1@monash.edu.au>

Hallo,

I am new to ParaView & got a few questions. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

1. When I download a 3D .mhd gray scale image with ParaView 3.2.1, it
appears in colour. The option "Map Scalars" under Display option can be
turned off with a .png image to have a grayscale one but this option
does not work (i.e. remains inactive) with the .mhd image. How can I
view my image in gray scale?
2. I need to measure/calculate different areas of a slice of a 3D mesh.
I found a filter called 
"Integrate Variables" which does something but I am not sure exactly
what it does. Can anybody give me more information on this (e.g. how it
calculates the area, the unit of measurement etc etc.).

Thank you.

Hello,

When comparing datasets, you can use the following procedures to
integrate multiple data.  However, the resulting data contains
multiple data arrays in addition to the original data, which increases
the data size.  For example, the data 'h0' is a copy of 'h' in the
following case, so it seems like that 'h' is no longer necessary.  Is
it possible to remove such data arrays?

Any other suggestions to decrease the data size would be appreciated.

I've created a simple program to demonstrate the problem.  I tried to
debug but I'm not sure what to look for....

I'm still getting this error:

Warning: In /home/paul/workspace/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDataObject.cxx,
line 908
vtkMultiBlockDataSet (0x622ec0): Attempted to ShallowCopy from null.

I've forwarded this to the VTK list in case anyone can help there.

BTW I'm using the latest CVS version of VTK from the ParaVIew source tree.

Any help here would be appreciated,
Paul

Ah, that was easy! If you look at the signature of GetOutput(), you'll
find out that it returns vtkPointSet (see vtkPointSetAlgorithm.h).
That method gets the output and SafeDownCasts it to vtkPointSet, hence
the NULL. Try using GetOutputDataObject(0) instead.

Hi Levent,

Compare the attached vti file to the one you wrote. I wrote this using
VTK and I can read into ParaView without a problem. I opened both with
a hex editor and I can definitely see a difference at the beginning of
the appended section.

This is probably a simple bug. Can you post an image we can test this with?

For 2D meshes, this filter divides polygons to triangles and sums the
area of all triangles. Since ParaView does not really support units,
the area is based on the original units of the dataset. I am not sure
how the mhd reader figures out spacing of the volume. Is it embedded
in the file? You can find the dimensions of the volume under the
information panel of the reader.

"Map Scalars" option is enabled only when the array used to color is made up
of upto 4 component unsigned chars. You can look at the data type/number of
components for the arrays using the "Information" tab. To map scalars using
a grayscale lookup table, go to the "Display" tab, click on "Edit Color
Map", then click on "Choose Preset" and select grayscale.

Yes, there is a better way of doing this: using the python
programmable filter. What you will need:

1. cvs paraview or a development snapshot from here:
http://paraview.org/New/download.html

2. numpy

We are not distributing numpy with our binaries yet so your best bet
is to download python and numpy and then download the ParaView source
from cvs and compile against that. We will probably start distributing
numpy with our binaries in the future to avoid this.

Then, you write a scipt like the following:

from paraview import numpy_support
import numpy

# get the two inputs - note this requires connecting two inputs to the filter
input0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
input1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 1)

# convert the input arrays to numpy arrays. substitute the right cell/point data
# and the right array names
ar0 = numpy_support.vtk_to_numpy(input0.GetPointData().GetArray("Elevation"))
ar1 = numpy_support.vtk_to_numpy(input1.GetPointData().GetArray("Result"))

# take the difference and convert to vtk array
out = numpy_support.numpy_to_vtk(ar1 - ar0, 1)
# give it a name
out.SetName("difference")

# add it to the output
self.GetOutputDataObject(0).GetPointData().AddArray(out)


In the future, this will be much simpler. My plan is that the above
will look like:

out = inputs[1].pointdata.Elevation - inputs[0].pointdata.Result
output.add_array(out, "difference")

I hope this helps.

Where did you see this?  It's most certainly wrong.  The byte order of
the count should match that specified by the "byte_order" attribute of
the VTKFile element.  I see that the files you posted are using big
endian order for that number even though the file says they are
LittleEndian.  It's just luck that the file reads anywhere.

> What is it with this data format?

Writing with anything but the VTK-provided writer was not a design goal.
 That's it's not really documented.  It's also why we provide C, C++,
and Fortran interfaces to the writer so that people can link to VTK
instead of using their own home-grown writers.

Oh, and FYI the count should not be the number of elements, it should be
the number of *bytes* in the array (before base-64 encoding if that is
done).

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering Slow Down on OS X, ParaView CVS,
	Custom GUI Plugin
Message-ID: <9BD10B4F-A544-458A-9FB6-8FAC77ED7E18@gmail.com>

System: OS X, 10.4.11, Intel, 2 GB Ram, Xcode 2.5, ParaView CVS from  
this morning.

Generally rendering was fine until I loaded one of my plugins and  
applied the filter that the plugin contains. The plugin also has a  
custom GUI that is loaded and I created a new Menu Category for the  
filter. Selecting the filter from the menu, clicking "Apply" and then  
trying to rotate/render the scene becomes very slow. Deleting the  
filter returns the speed to normal. Also, NOT loading the Client Side  
plugin BUT applying the same filter results in NO slow down.

I ran "Shark" against ParaView 3 while interacting with the render  
view (constant rotation by click-dragging in the render view) and I  
found that the time is being spent in the following call:

15.1 s	16.1 s	libpqComponents.dylib

I am finding the new "Rubber-band" mode of point selection extremely  
useful for our analysis. The problem I am having is that our data is  
time varying. What happens is that I make a selection of points, then  
use the "Selection Inspector" to show the Point IDs and finally click  
the "Forward" button to step forward in time. The problem is the  
annotations above the points does not move with the data. Basically  
the annotations are only valid for that time step. Is this a  
"feature" or a bug?

Thanks a lot!

One more question.  If one can create difference maps, they would also
like to know statistical details of them (e.g., mean, standard
deviation).  I know the histogram filter is useful for this, and data
ranges can be found in the information tab.  However, there seems to
be no ways to know more details.  Actually I'd like to calculate the
mean as well as standard deviation of differences.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks

Most cetainly... I haven't seen it anywhere. As I said it was a trial and
error procedure for me to figure this out and I stopped trying when it
worked as some point (although it didn't make sense). And as you indicated,
I just got lucky on 64bit Linux. I still haven't got the slightest idea why
it works.

Point taken. However, what we intended here was just a simple dirty solution
and VTI raw binary seems plain enough to implement without resorting to high
level library calls. There is hardly any need to grow anything at home, but
dump a couple lines of text and the binary data. All I strove to find out
was a proper specification of the binary format.  Although it was apparently
not a design goal, VTK User's guide already documents the data formats in
detail; however omits to mention this 4-byte thingy, and look where we ended
up :)

Thanks Brad. Much needed indeed. All I needed to know was what that magic
word is supposed to be. I am indebted for your guidance on the matter.

sorry for the noise,

This morning I updated my version from CVS but the problem persists. The messages comes from this section of code in pqPipelineRepresentation::onRepresentationChanged:

======
  // Representation is Volume, is color array set?
  QList<QString> colorFields = this->getColorFields();
  if (colorFields.size() == 0)
    {
    qCritical() << 
      "Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data available.";
    this->setRepresentation(vtkSMPVRepresentationProxy::OUTLINE);
    return;
    }
======

What are these "color fields"? Why are they missing when using cell data? Why does the message say there is no data when its actually the "color fields" that are missing?

The variable "Dummy" can be used to color the surface of both attachments, cubePointInt32.vti and cubeCellInt32.vti. Switching to volume visualization works for the first (point data) but produces the above error for the second (cell data).

TIA!

Dear Berk,
Thank you for your reply.
For a 3D surface mesh it shows surface area but when I cut a slice it
shows length possibly because it recognizes this as a line segment. Is
there any way to calculate the area inside this closed curve?

Message-ID: <c9adba420806121143q73001ee1s1eed32a71b198778@mail.gmail.com>

My pqObjectPanel has a dialog which provides an editor for my filter.
I would like to apply or reset changes from my dialog (or
pqObjectPanel) but (I think) this requires a call to
"pqObjectInspectorWidget::accept" or "pqObjectInspectorWidget::reset".
 I cannot work out how to get a pointer to pqObjectInspector from my
pqObjectPanel.

Can any help (or suggest another way)?

This is generally not recommended. An object panel cannot cause an 
"Apply" or a "Reset" since the user could have un-applied changes to 
other panels as well.

If absolutely needed, to push changes made in the panel alone, that can 
call "apply()" on itself. The apply button's modified state should 
update correctly depending on whether any other panels are modified (I 
think).

What is your use-case? Why does the panel need to cause an Apply?

Calling apply on itself doesn't work until apply is first pressed by
the "proper" button (and I don't think it works with undo either).
The reader/filter I have written is an interface for meshing software
and the panel on the side is too small for all the options so I have
created a separate dialog (that pops up from a push button).  The
dialog has 3 buttons; ok, apply and cancel.  I could just let the user
press the usual "Accept" but I like the option of having the buttons
in the dialog so the user doesn't need to switch windows.

Paul

For volume rendering image data, ParaView uses 
vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper and that mapper does not support using 
cell data scalars. Hence ParaView complains.

Subject: [Paraview] Using the accept button from a pqObjectPanel

Hmm, I can't think of any easy way to achieve that.
One hackish way is to go up the Qt parent tree for the panel till you 
hit a pqObjectInspectorWidget. I think pqObjectInspectorWidget is indeed 
the parent of the panel. Once you have the
pqObjectInspectorWidget you can call the appropriate slot on it. 
Ofcourse, this is just a hack, so try at your own risk :).

I am not sure I follow your question. Are you looking for a plugin for a 
reader? There is an example reader plugin in

Alright, Im having no luck modifying paraview for my own needs on this
one. I have been trying to get the call to "writer->Save()"
(vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter::Save)  in pqAnimationManager.cxx to
modify the FileName (i.e. insert ".left." before the extension of the
filename chosen by the qt file selector), then render+save the
animation from to two different filenames. I have the renaming done,
but the generated left/right files are exactly the same. What I do
though is call "the vtkRenderWindow->STEREO_LEFT view, then do the
same thing again rendering with vtkRenderWindow->STEREO_RIGHT.
Unfortunately, I think something lower level is forcing the rendering
to stay "left" (or turns stereo off) because both sequences come out
exactly the same. Here is a cvs diff of the damage Ive done so far:

http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~bollig/vislab/development/paraview/diff.txt

Can I submit a feature request and hope someone will continue?

I created a vtu file which has 2 pieces for each region.  One consists
of lines connecting the points.  One consists of triangles connecting
the points.  Having the triangle data superimposed on the lines data
results in the lines data being displayed incorrectly.

Is there a way to ensure that the triangle based structure and lines
based structure do not interfere with each other?

Juan

Subject: [Paraview] Leaks when opening files?
Message-ID: <20080613.103427.205325000.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I sometimes run the cvs head on OS X with MallocStackLogging=1 and use
the Apple's "leaks" tool as a simple way of detecting leaks from my
reader.

The problem is I always get about 3 - 15 leaks when I try to open a
file which do not seem to be coming from my reader since they also
occurs for other file types (*.vtk, *.vts, etc). The exact number of
leaks is quite dependent on how I open the file (through the Open File
dialog, Recent Files menu, etc.), but my impression is that I get
larger number of leaks when opened from Recent Files menu.

For example if I try to open a *.vts file from Recent Files, the first
of the reported leaks by "leaks" goes as shown below. Are they
considered harmless or unfixable (since most, but not all, of them
seem to be coming from within Qt-classes)?

Subject: [Paraview] question: how to add "vtkDICOMImageReader" into Paraview
	3.2.2 using plugin
Message-ID: <e00a3a3d0806121838j1009910av5f28cb1805b3441e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I tried to extend Paraview to read DICOM images through vtkDICOMImageReader.
Following the example in source code
"ParaView3.2.2/Examples/Plugins/Reader", I successfully added a DICOM reader
into Paraview. The problem is that this reader can only read one file rather
than to load all DICOM images from a directory. I guess this is because the
GUI XML , i.e., "ParaView3.2.2/Examples/Plugins/Reader/pqReader.xml", can
only return a filename. Any hint to make a GUI XML to return a directory
name? Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Units of Integration Time in Streamline Tracer filter
Message-ID: <C478106F.19E9%m.gulamali@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi all!

I'm using the Streamline Tracer filter with a custom source in Paraview to
view streamlines in my velocity vector data.  All is going well but I'm a
little confused by the "Integration Time" variable that this filter
generates.  I'd be grateful if someone could tell me what the units of this
variable would be if the units of length in my data is metres, and the units
of velocity is metres per second?  I would expect the "Integration Time"
variable to be in units of seconds but the values are coming out to be way
too large.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf X_Y_Z format
Message-ID: <b8f06b560806130408h117a8777xac43c9da19cc8c1e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a program that writes out files in HDF5 format. The geometry is
a structured grid and is specified as three arrays, each containing
one coordinate value for every point. I'm trying to get Paraview to
read this by using Xdmf, but can't get it to work. Reading the
following xdmf file with the attached hdf5 file gives the error below.
If I interleave the coordinates and use the XYZ format instead of
X_Y_Z then everything is fine. For various reasons though, it is
inconvenient to change the original program to do this so I would
prefer to use X_Y_Z.  I'm using serial Paraview 3.2.2 on 64-bit Centos
5. Does anyone know what might be wrong?

Cheers,
Tobias.

Tobias,

You've run into a bug in Xdmf that has been fixed.
The problem is with XdmfHDF.cxx when not compiled with MPI.
You can :
	1. Compile with MPI - probably not what you want
	2. Edit XdmfHDF.cxx - asking for trouble
	3. Get a current version of XDMF - I think you can go
		into Utilities/Xdmf/libsrc and just "cvd up -d".
Also, just to be picky,
	<Geometry Type="3DSMESH" ...
should really be :
	<Geometry GeometryType="3DSMESH ...

"Type" will work with the Xdmf library but it's really not standard.

Let me know if it works,
Jerry Clarke

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel file formats (again)...
Message-ID: <48526EDF.8010602@nacad.ufrj.br>

Can anyone shed some light above how is the support status for parallel 
file formats in ParaView?

In my lab most of the students still work with Fortran. It seems that 
"the universe nowadays only speaks C++ (and Python for scripting)" which 
force us to do an extensive evaluation for a good and well supported 
parallel file format to invest before struggling with all that mixed 
languages interface/wrapping annoyances (not everybody working with 
programs are programmers, there's still some engineers like civil, 
mechanical, chemical, etc... doing science...).

I could say that our my concerns about choosing a file format to sticky 
with is:

-- Easiness for installation and use (in this sense, Ensight is 
wonderful since we don't need extra libraries. It's insane when we need 
to compile 50 MB of libraries to link with a 2 MB program that uses just 
one routine of such library);
-- Easiness for interfacing (most of the libraries nowadays is written 
in C++ for C++ programmers which discourage its use by C and Fortran 
programs. Ok, we can always spend some time in interfacing it, but, a 
library should offer more functionality and flexibility than annoyances)
-- Portability.

Some time ago there was some interesting posts from Jean Favre and 
Dominic about this, which give us some overview about the subject.

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-May/008070.html
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-May/008071.html

My 2 cents for the discussion, *from a Fortran perspective*, is:

1). ENSIGHT:
1.1. Quite simple to implement and use (no need for extra libraries and 
all that stuff. Just a few Fortran statements do the job);
1.2. Implicit support for transient data and parallelism;
1.3. Depending on the number of processes we might have a huge number of 
small/medium files since each point and cell data variable is stored in 
one file (sometimes it can be a serious problem);
1.4. Not compressed (too bad);
1.5. Not so well supported *as a parallel format* by ParaView yet. After 
the change to deal (after PV 2.2.1) with multigroup datasets some 
functionalities were lost until reimplementation.
1.6. Supported by ParaView, Visit and Ensight (of course)

2). XML/VTK:
2.1. Almost impossible for a Fortran user to implement, so, we're forced 
to interface with VTK in order to write something;
2.2. Time series support has been introduced in some sense ;o)
2.3. It's a bit complicated to understand. Ok, it's XML and we should 
use it (and believe on it ;o) ) through some library, so, it's not 
supposed to "hand-implementation";
2.4. Encoding/compression is supported (which is really good)
2.5. It should be the most well parallel file format supported by 
ParaView (after EXODUS, maybe)
2.6. Only supported by VTK based softwares (ParaView, Visit, MayaVi)

3). XDMF/HDF5:
3.1. Same as 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
3.2. The website describing the library is a bit down lately...
3.3. HDF5 seems a very promising file format. It has some development 
concern about its use by other scientific languages besides being 
flexible, compressed, cross platform, etc... .
3.4. From my knowledge, XDMF is supported by Ensight, ParaView and Visit 
also --> not sure about how good is that support.

4). EXODUS II:
4.1. Same as 2.1 --> I already tried more than once to find something 
about Exodus format. There's a good documentation in SANDIA/SEACAS page 
but the library is not open source (it's a license based distribution) 
which turns it a bit complicated to adopt;
4.2. Nothing to say about timea nd compression support since I never 
used it;
4.3. It must be well supported by PV since it's a Sandia's format;

regards

Renato.

Hi Renato,

You should strongly consider HDF5. In addition, this is not true that 
the worlds speaks C++. Most of my colleague physicists use FORTRAN, and 
this will not change anytime soon. Advantage of using HDF5 would be not 
forcing you to do this (dramatic) change. You could (should!) consider 
FORTRAN 90 instead, 77 is really an old hat :)

Also see some points below.

Does not apply to HDF5. only XDMF. I discourage you to use XDMF, 
especially if you are a fortran progammer.

> 3.2. The website describing the library is a bit down lately...

Does not apply to HDF5, on the contrary.

correct.

See my other email about XDMF. You are stuck with FORTRAN, and yes, as 
most (not all) of the world speaks C++, I doubt this will be fixed.

Subject: [Paraview] question: how to add "vtkDICOMImageReader" into
 Paraview 3.2.2 using plugin

There's no way currently to tell ParaView to set the directory name on 
the reader (instead of a file or a list of files). I just committed a 
feature to CVS where if the <UseDirectoryName /> hint is present on the 
filename property, the directory name will be used instead of the file name:
eg.

     <StringVectorProperty
         name="Directory"
         command="SetDirectory"
         number_of_elements="1">
         <FileListDomain name="files"/>
         <Hints>
           <UseDirectoryName />
         </Hints>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Note that now the reader will always get the directory name and never 
the filename. You cannot have two properties one taking a filename and 
another taking a directory. In that case, paraview will only end up 
using one of them.

Renato,

Just checked again, Exodus-II is open source now.  Look here --

http://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&type_of_search=soft&words=exodusii

Maybe easier -- http://sourceforge.net/  and enter string "exodusii" in 
search.  Of course, one also has to get a netCDF library since Exodus-II 
is a layer between your code and the netCDF library, but that is easy 
also --

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

Exodus-II is written in c, but has a Fortran binding. Unless it has 
changed recently, there are far more uses of Exodus-II in Fortran 
programs than in c programs.

Jerry,

Thanks for your help. I compiled it with MPI support and everything works fine.

You might want to reconsider XDMF or something based on it. I'm not  
sure that XDMF is significantly harder to implement in fortran than  
straight HDF5. It's just a matter  of doing some additional text i/o  
on a relatively simple XML file. XDMF splits the data (with some  
redundancy) into light/meta data stored as simple XML (ascii) file and  
an HDF5 archive of the "heavy" data.  You can read and write the XML  
file directly from fortran without using the XDMF library and then use  
the HDF5 fortran API directly to write the heavy data.   You have the  
option of storing the heavy data in the XML file as text when HDF5  
isn't available (or when debugging/running on small data).   To me it  
looks like the posts you cite are pointing in this  direction though  
they were unhappy with some aspects of XDMF.  It's not clear to me  
whether it's the XDMF xml format, the documentation of that format, or  
the C API that needs work in order to make it more  useful.

Also, it sounds like you've already decided against a mixed language  
approach, but the the book by H. P. Langtangen "Python Scripting for  
Computational Science" advocates a fortran/python pairing to deal with  
some of your  general concerns.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems compiling 3.2 on IA64 with ICC/ICPC
	(Resolution)
Message-ID: <b02264720806130815o70c4d9c2s1f5ca742b34324af@mail.gmail.com>

Ok, for anyone watching this thread, I wanted to post an update.

The first problem (about _SC_GR0_OFFSET) was solved by switching from the
icc 9.1.042 compilers to anything newer, in my case 9.1.049.  This, however,
created another problem later in the compile where the libxml2 headers were
all missing.

After alot of digging & help from the Kitware B-Trio (Bill, Berk, and Brad),
I got past that by recompiling CMake for the ia64 architecture (with icc).
It seems the x86 compile doesn't entirely work on ia64 systems.  It works
enough to confuse you, but not enough to actually complete the compile.  As
of this writing, I'm 15% through compiling paraview and it's working fine so
far.

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot Build on Altix
Message-ID: <48529D01.3070001@psc.edu>

ccmake 2.6.0 fails to compile the CVS version with the message that it cannot find Qt 4.3.0 or greater.

However, I have explicitly entered the path to qmake for 4.4.0. Each time I enter "c" the above message is shown again and the path I set is changed back to "UNKNOWN".

This is the initial build so there is only the one Qt-releated cmake variable.

System: SGI Altix 4700, Itanium2 ia64
OS: enhanced version of SuSE
Compiler: GNU

Thanks!

It seems that XDMF is the unique way to go if we'd like to get parallel 
data into ParaView using HDF5. No problem since XDMF can be seen as a 
HDF5 extension. In fact, I thought about doing exactly what you cited -- 
use the HDF5 API and write simple XML/XDMF files using Fortran, no 
matter if my data is heavy or light.

The problem with XDMF is the lack of information. The first link pointed 
by Google is always down (www.arl.hpc.mil/ice/) and the "official" wiki 
site doesn't offer so much. I already got something on doing Fortran 
talk with XDMF (we can also write interfaces from the Fortran side to 
talk with C-like routine names) but, now, I'd like to go a bit further 
and use parallelism but there's no examples covering the subject using 
Fortran. My chance is debugging C++ examples and try to make some 
correlation.

Regarding row-major order and non 0 started arrays I can't say anything. 
I only say that, for Fortran programmers, it's getting a bit harder to 
work without having to deal with C++ and all that OOP stuffs. In this 
sense, I love Metis, so powerful, so easy, so fast, so simple and 
everything written in C ANSI. Just minor efforts to get it working with 
Fortran. As we say in Brazil, sometimes people like to kill cockroaches 
using bazookas instead of flip-flops... for writing files*my guess* is 
that straight C would do the job nicely

Dominik, the problem with Fortran is that everybody associates it with 
77 (just that old programming language). Maybe, they should change the 
name of the language from Fortran 2003 to F++ ;oP

Does a simple CMakeLists.txt file with one line
find_package(Qt4)
work?

Thanks! Here's the test:

1) Created suggested CMakeLists.txt file
2) Entered "ccmake ." then "c"
3) See warning "No cmake_minimum_required ..." then entered "e"
4) Qt not found; set QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to "/usr/local/packages/Trolltech/4.4.0/bin/qmake" then entered "c"
5) See same warning, entered "e" then "g" 
6) CMakeCache.txt contains this line (I broke into two at the "="):

CMakeCache.txt:QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH
=/usr/local/packages/Trolltech/4.4.0/bin/qmake-NOTFOUND

7) Enter "ccmake ." and see that Qt is again marked as not found.

I made very, very sure I entered the correct path to qmake, and that I have permission to read those files.

Well,
 on a 64bit system, long and "long long" are the same thing. So my
guess is that wherever Xdmf is defining XdmfInt64 isn't quite "right".
Might be it or I might be completely wrong.

Hi Jerry,

As I described in my last email, I managed to compile and link the 
Fortran example supplied with the XDMF library (in fact, I changed the 
example a little bit writing a Fortran interface explicitly to call the 
extern "C" routine name). It gave me 10 XDMF and 10 HDF5 files. Each 
XDMF pointing to a corresponding HDF5. Ok, everything easy and 
running... now, I'm guessing, from a naive approach, that I could just 
follow the same example for a parallel running where each process, 
having its own piece of the domain, would write its data in pairs of 
files XDMF/HDF5. Thus, for 2 processes, I'd have something like:

Iteration 1
Demo_00001.00.xmf  --> Demo_00001.00.h5
Demo_00001.01.xmf --> Demo_00001.01.h5

Iteration 2
Demo_00002.00.xmf  --> Demo_00002.00.h5
Demo_00002.01.xmf --> Demo_00002.01.h5
...
and so on

Maybe, all 20 XDMF files in this example could be replaced by just one 
containing all iterations and processes information, but, I haven't 
found it explained on XDMF's wiki.

Do you have a simple example of parallel XDMF file? Moreover, Is 
ParaView able to load transient parallel files in XDMF?

thanks

Renato.

You are right: write 1 XML file that references all HDF5 files. For example, process 0 writes 1 XML file with 4096 grids, each describing the HDF5 file from one process.

FindQt4.cmake will set the qmake to NOTFOUND if any of these variables are 
empty
QT_LIBRARY_DIR 
QT_INCLUDE_DIR 
QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE 
QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE 
QT_RCC_EXECUTABLE 
QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_RELEASE AND QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_DEBUG

That typically happens with an incorrectly installed Qt.

Renato,
	There are lots of ways to handle this in parallel, each with pros and 
cons. The simplest approach is what you have described; writing
one HDF5 file per node. You don't have to write out one xml file for
each node, you can just write out one xml file that pulls them all
together. (But I typically write them out anyway particularly during
debugging so I can easily look at one node's data in ParaView).

The trick is to use the "Collection" grid type. Xdmf Grids can
be "Uniform" (a homogeneous single grid), "Tree" (a hierarchical group), or
"Collection" (an array of Uniform grids all with the same Attributes)

On the Wiki, at the end :
http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Write_from_Fortran

It describes using a collection for time :
--------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">
        <Domain>
            <Grid GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">
              <xi:include href="Demo_00001.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00002.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00003.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00004.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00005.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00006.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00007.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00008.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00009.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
              <xi:include href="Demo_00010.xmf" 
xpointer="xpointer(//Xdmf/Domain/Grid)" />
           </Grid>
        </Domain>
</Xdmf>
--------------------------------

All you have to do is change CollectionType="Temporal" to
CollectionType="Spatial" and it should work; ParaView
will pull in all 10 grids (one written from each node)
and assemble it into one grid. If you wanted to eliminate
the pre-node xml files, write that portion of the xml
(from <Grid..> to </Grid>)to the collection xml file
replacing the <xi:include ... syntax.


If you want this to work over time, you make a
collection of collections. The outer is
CollectionType="Temporal" which contains a
collection of CollectionType="Temporal" which are
each like the above example.

Now, having said all that, you could also try parallel
HDF5 and have a single HDF5 file. I've done that in the
past but if I remember correctly some of the operations
must be done collectively. HDF5 is very powerful; there
are many ways to do things.

Hope this helps,
Jerry

Clint,

Sorry, I don't know what you mean by "incorrectly installed". After running "make" in the Qt directory I ran "make install" and the installation directory looks like that on the 4 other Linux systems where I use the CVS version of ParaView.

I am not sure what you mean by "these variables". Are those environment variables? If so they are not defined on any system where I've installed Qt and ParaView, and were obviously not needed.

They are variables in your CMakeCache.txt file with the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE 
variable.

Subject: [Paraview] Compile error with Windows XP
Message-ID: <F33C0EE2-3AB7-4F55-8E59-A23238D7A4A6@arsc.edu>

I'm trying to compile paraview 3.2.2 without the QT GUI on a Windows  
XP machine using Cygwin. I'm mainly interested in just the pvpython  
scripting portion, which is why I'm leaving out the GUI. Anyway, I'm  
running into this error.

In file included from /home/Webb/ParaView3.2.2/VTK/Utilities/vtkjpeg/ 
jpeglib.h:27,
	from /home/Webb/ParaView3.2.2/VTK/Utilities/vtk_jpeg.h:35,

/home/Webb/ParaView3.2.2/VTK/Utilities/vtkjpeg/jmorecfg.h:246: error:

tif_jpeg.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [VTK/Utilities/vtktiff/CmakeFiles/vtktiff.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

Is there something special I need to do to get it to compile in Cygwin?

Message-ID: <280239.31110.qm@web35302.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview Group:

I have a couple of workstations running OpenSuSE 10.3 64 bit OS.  These systems should have similar configurations, but, not identical.  I downloaded pre-compiled paraview (version 3.2.1, linux, I believe it is 32 bit).  On some system, paraview starts without any problem, but, some system failed to start paraview, with the following error:
--------------------------------
phsieh at huwei:~/paraview/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/bin> ./paraview
/home/phsieh/paraview/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview-real: error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
phsieh at huwei:~/paraview/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/bin>
---------------------------------

Under /usr/lib64, I do have libGL.so (.so, .so.1, .so.169.12).  Anyway, I created soft link to /usr/lib, so now, I have /usr/lib/libGL.so (and .so.1, .so.169.12).  But, Still the same problem.

Can someone shed some light on this problem?  How to fix this?

Thanks!

Pei

Wrong ELF class sounds to me like using 32 bits version while 64 is 
expected. Run ldd to see what is missing. Then see the linker 
configuration and/or LD_LIBRARY_PATH for library search order.

Further to what everyone else has written on the subject.

Here at CSCS we are convinced that HDF5 is really the only way to 
proceed for parallel IO and we try to encourage all our users to adopt it.
The trouble is that we have a proliferation of 'formats' - they are all 
hdf5, bur as you know there are a myriad way of arranging groups, 
heirarchies, different vector scalar combinations etc. We have something 
like 6 or 7 different hdf5 readers for vtk/paraview. Image/particle/mesh 
etc etc. XDMF allows the possibility of writing a simple xml wrapper 
around each file and then having a single reader which can handle them 
all (in principle at least). XDMF stores the where/form/shape in the xml 
so that its easy to tell the reader to find this group, that dataset and 
put it into this place in the vtk structure.

Of course, the vtk/xdmf support it still quite tatty and needs a lot of 
work, but I am using it whenever possible because every time I fix a bug 
in it, it supports all my hdf formats and not just one. (in principle 
again!).

Hi Clint,

Are you saying that I should manually set the variables you listed? I've never had to do that before.

Are you saying that the files to which these programs point are missing? They are not. I compared the Qt directory on the system where the failure occurs to the same directory on another system, and it seems that everything is there. In particular I verified that the files to which your variables point on the working installation are present on the system that is failing.

By the way, the failures occur using Qt 4.4.0 and cmake 2.6.0.

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting - displaying results on a FE mesh
Message-ID: <48568F17.8010204@ntc.zcu.cz>

Hi,

I am trying to write a Python script to visualize a finite element mesh 
with some fields, stored in a legacy VTK file (unstructured grid). 
Following Servermanager2.pdf, I have created the script below, which 
displays the mesh (solid color). However now I do not know how to 
visualize one of the fields (point data or cell data), i.e. have some 
colormap and related color bar. Does anyone have a small example script 
to do that?

Then I digged more and found:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-July/005394.html
The problem is that the script described there, that dumps the session 
state from the paraview GUI into a python script, does not seem to work 
with the Paraview 3.2. Is there an updated version somewhere?

best wishes,

I wanted to know which of those variables was not defined.
Can you send me your CMakeCache.txt file?

Hmmm ... I just tried that (attached) and get a multiblock dataset instead of one grid.

Is there anyway at all to get the Xdmf reader to combine uniform grids from several files into one grid? Volume visualization won't work on a multiblock dataset.

elev = sm.filters.ElevationFilter(Input=sphere)
view = sm.CreateRenderView()
repr = sm.CreateRepresentation(elev, view)

lut = sm.rendering.PVLookupTable()
# Add to RGB points. These are tuples of 4 values. First one is

yes I did, just this morning in fact.  By turning off "VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS",
it compiled just fine.

Wouldn't that basically kill the 64 bit ability of VTK then? Doesn't  
VTK/ParaView us vtkIdType as indices and such.

I did some digging on this and what I have found so far is that the  
file ParaView3/VTK/Common/VTKType.h
has something that looks like a "hack" to turn off something. Down  
towards the bottom of the file is the following block:

/ 
*----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
---*/

#else
typedef int vtkIdType;

# define VTK_LARGE_ID VTK_INT_MAX

The real line of interest is:
# if defined(VTK_SIZEOF_LONG) && VTK_SIZEOF_LONG == 8 && 0

I guess some one put in the "&& 0" to disable that block permanently,  
this makes the compiler go to the next #elif which passes all of its  
tests and we get vtkIdType == "long long".

This becomes a problem because XdmfInt64 defines to "long". Thus the  
conflicting types and we get the error. I am not sure what the  
correct fix is though. Is this just an Intel Compiler thing? It seems  
that the Xdmf project is figuring out the type for XdmfInt64 in a  
slightly different manner than VTK. or the Xdmf project is  
interchanging vtkIdType, int, long and long long without proper  
regard. Don't know.

I am cross posting to the Xdmf list in the hopes someone there might  
be able to help.

Hello,

While I am waiting for my paraview book, I was wondering if anyone knew how:

1. To display arrows (length scaled w.r.t. magnitude) instead of
colored edges for vector data?

2.  When warping scalar in the Z direction, how to warp to the log of
the data as opposed to just the linear magnitude?

Thanks,

Juan

Changing the functions allocated for each actions doesn't seem to be 
working. However the values changed, the default assigned functions are 
executed.

Thank you. I think I understand the example. However I still struggle 
with applying this to the source given by LegacyVTKFileReader. My VTK 
file has two point data sets: scalar 'p' and vector 'u'. How do I refer 
to them? The LegacyVTKFileReader instance has only two attributes 
(FileNames, TimestepValues) - how do I say that I want to apply e.g. 
Glyph filter to 'u' and color the mesh by 'p'? How to get to the data?

I can do this easily in the GUI, but as I need to visualize several 
results files in the same way I would like to automate it a bit.

How about the following code:

dssf = filters.DataSetSurfaceFilter()
view = CreateRenderView()
display = CreateRepresentation(dssf, view)
lt = rendering.PVLookupTable()
display.LookupTable = lt
display.ColorAttributeType = 0; # Point Data
display.ColorArrayName = "p"

Hey, thanks, that's it! I thought that the name "Elevation" in the
example by Utkarsh is just an arbitrary name... I have tried
DataSetSurfaceFilter but without this piece of knowledge all stayed white...

I dug some more into this and I have a compile working on IA64 using  
ICC 9.1.049. The difference seems to be in the XdmfConfig.h.in file.

I switched around some preprocessor so that they were more inline  
with vtk:

#if defined( SIZEOF_LONG_LONG )
# define XDMF_64_INT long long
# define HAVE_64_INT
# define XDMF_have_64_bit_int
#elif defined( SIZEOF___INT64 )
# define XDMF_64_INT __int64
# define HAVE_64_INT
#else
# error "64 bit long not defined"
#endif

and now Xdmf seems to compile correctly without have to disable the  
64 bit ids. Is this correct? Comments?

I also tested the compile on OS X 10.4.11 (X86) Intel Core Duo with  
GCC and that also passed. I have a Linux AMD 64 box that I am going  
to also try in the morning with Intel 10.1.x compilers.

Like Dominik suggests, try using the Calculator to compute the log of the
scalar value. For the arrows, use the "Glyph" filter, with glyph type set to
arrow. You can then choose the vector to direct the glyphs along, and the
scalar to scale with. Don't forget to set the scale mode appropriately.

Subject: [Paraview] streamline tracer does not work on cut filter results
Message-ID: <4857B5E5.1040808@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

I noticed that if I cut my tet mesh with cut filter I can no longer plot 
streamlines. I tried finetuning the parameters -> no luck. Works perfect 
on the original 3D dataset with no tweaks. Any ideas?
Thanks.

Try using the "Surface Vectors" filter to project the vectors onto the cut
plane. Also, you have to ensure that the seed point is on the surface (which
may be tricky with a point clound, use the line source instead for seeding
streamlines).

Mike,

Thanks. I made you changes compiled and tested here.
Seems to work fine. I checked changes into CVS

Thanks for a hint, but no, applying SurfaceVectors prior to StreamTracer 
does not help. I made sure the line is in plane. I manage to get a few 
very short bits of streamlines but they die out quick. So indeed sounds 
like in-plane accuracy. I checked the range of my velocity and after 
SurfaceVectors the range in the plance normal direction is NOT zero. I 
used the Calculator to put it explicitly to zero, but it did not help 
either. BTW. I can correctly display velocity as glyphs on the cut. 
Anything else I can do to make sure it is not a bug?

Thanks. Sounds like problems with the in-plane accuracy as mine is not 
exactly 0.0 (1e-18 or so, but putting it to 0 does not help). In any 
case, which PV are you using? I am using CVS from a few days back.

Can you try reproducing the issue using the disk_out_ref.ex2 data set 
provided with in ParaViewData?

I load 'V' from that dataset, cut it in YZ or XZ plane, chose line 
source, and the streamlines do not make any sense, they are normal 
(sic!) to the cut plane. Strealining the original 3D dataset, however, 
makes sense. Can it confirm it works for you?

Here is my screenshot:

OK, sorry, in this file I did not apply surfaceVectors. If I do, it works.
However, my own file still does not work. Here the file:

http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~domi/tmp/problem.vtk

Does it matter that it is a quadratic mesh maybe?

Works for me also.

Bassem - could you please post detailed instructions on how to replicate the bug?  For instance, I just changed Left Button to Zoom, grabbed the image with the left mouse, and the image zoomed.

Seems to work for me. What version are you using?

I had a similar problem when trying to visualize an axi-symmetric data 
set.  The problem was that the streamlines were not confined to the the 
axi-symmetric plane, and thus they were cut short at the point where the 
flow went in the circumferential direction.  The fix in my case was to 
use the calculator to develop a new, simplified data set.

V = V_x * ihat + V_y * jhat + 0 * khat

This way, the axi-symmetric component is zero, and doesn't affect the in 
plane streamlines.  I wonder if you could do something similar in your 
case?  Although I presume it would be more complex given that your 
cutting plane may not lay perfectly within one of the Cartesian planes...

I already did it, as mentioned in a previous post. No, it does not work 
for me - does it work on my dataset for you?

In any case, that is a trivialized example, my real case is not 
symmetric and a cut plane is not easily aligned with the axes.

I suspect this might have to do with:

1) the funny range like 1.52e-18 - 1.22e-17 for point1/point2 in line 
source sub-window that I get hitting 'X/Y/Z Axis' button.

2) my mesh being quadratic and streamlining not working in such cases.

Thanks for any hints.

Ha it even works with official 3.3.0, only not my own compilation from 
CVS 05 June. So either it is my own compilation, or something still got 
broken in CVS slightly later. Attached is my CMakeCache. Any ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] Make install NOT installing HDF5 library [CVS]
Message-ID: <FF63B617-FA24-4E08-9D35-8C676477AC0D@gmail.com>

I just did a "make install" on ParaView CVS and tried to run a  
program and noticed that the libvtkHDF library was NOT installed. It  
was built, just not installed. This is on IA64 using ICC 9.1.049 and  
CMake 2.4.8 (built using same ICC).

Any suggestions where to start looking to fix this?

OK I traced the problem down to using the Intel compiler for my build. 
The same code compiled with GNU works.

To the developer of the stream tracer class: are you using things like

if(x==y)

for x,y float/double?

I have already noticed GNU and Intel respond differently, with GNU more 
forgiving. The proper (= correct, robust, meaningful) comparison should be

if(fabs(x-y)<eps)

I do not know if that is the problem, but it is one of the differences 
between the compilers that I noticed.

I'm trying to set the right button for the pan function. Actually I 
tried to change all buttons combinations to have the pan function, but 
it is not working except for the middle button which I miss on my laptop.

I was using 3.2.1 and installed 3.2.2 after the last email from Utkarsh, 
but also didn't work for me.

Dominik, can you please report a bug for this issue and assign it to 
Berk. I will make sure he takes a look at it when he gets back.

AAAhhh, found it.

This is a bug in ParaView 3.2.1 ( I replicated it local client, XP, left mouse button, changed pan to zoom.).

It has been fixed on the nightly trunk, which should be released as ParaView 3.4 in the next month or so.

I'm trying to set the right button for the pan function. Actually I tried to change all buttons combinations to have the pan function, but it is not working except for the middle button which I miss on my laptop.

I was using 3.2.1 and installed 3.2.2 after the last email from Utkarsh, but also didn't work for me.

Message-ID: <485811B6.5050900@kitware.com>

Kitware is considering offering a training course for VTK (www.vtk.org) 
and ParaView (www.paraview.org) in Thailand during October 2008. This 
two day hands-on course would cover VTK at a beginner / intermediate 
level, and ParaView at a beginner / intermediate level (focused on basic 
desktop / laptop end-user data visualization.) This course would be 
appropriate for developers who are new to VTK or ParaView and would like 
to understand the pipeline architecture, the rendering subsystem, and 
data visualization techniques applied to a variety of data types. This 
course is also appropriate for project managers who are considering 
using VTK or ParaView as a visualization solution, and educators who 
would like to use VTK or ParaView in their academic courses.

If you, your development team, or your students are interested in 
attending this training course, or if you have any questions on the 
course details, please send email to courses at kitware.com by June 30th.

Subject: [Paraview] Does XDMF support wildcards?
Message-ID: <485887CE.3060103@nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi folks,

Does anybody know if XDMF support wildcards? My intention is do 
something like:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">
   <Domain>
      <Grid GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">
         <Grid Name="Test mesh" Type="Uniform">

            <Time TimeType="List">
              <DataItem Format="XML" NumberType="Float" Dimensions="7">
		   0.0 0.1 0.5 1.0 1.1 10.0 100.5
              </DataItem>
            </Time>

            <Topology Type="Tetrahedron" NumberOfElements="   108104 " 
BaseOffset="1">
               <DataItem Dimensions="432416" NumberType="Int" 
Format="HDF">foo_[**].h5:/incid</DataItem>
            </Topology>

            <Geometry Type="XYZ">
               <DataItem Dimensions="61767" NumberType="Float" 
Precision="8" Format="HDF">foo_[**].h5:/coords</DataItem>
            </Geometry>

         </Grid>

      </Grid>
   </Domain>
</Xdmf>

The block above would load 7 files (corresponding to the time values 
listed) with name pattern foo_[**].h5, where [**] is the wildcard 
representing the file numbers (00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06). It's 
comparable with what Ensight case files use to represent name patterns. 
Maybe it could be done using functions, but I can't figure out how it's 
used with grids.

Renato.

Hello !

Can anybody tell me the correct way to set up ICET with paraview 3.2 

Now i did folowwing on a 128 Processor Machine::

Client and Server are the same Machine just other proc.

on CLient: ./ paraview

on Server: mpirun -np 3 ./pvrenderserver -tdx=3 
and            mpirun -np 1 ./pvdataserver

or

mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver -tdx=3 


the result is always that only one screen (:0.0 )  is showing a picture
not :0.0 plus :0.1 plus :0.2

I think I did something wrong with the Display Variable.

thanks

Message-ID: <73D1EAB2-0F0E-49DE-8399-BF76CCDF7D87@sjc.ox.ac.uk>

Hello,

I am looking to put a large amount of existing data into Xdmf format  
but I'm new to setting up Xdmf and using them in Paraview so I was  
hoping for some help in the process.  Here is my situation:

- currently have ASCII data with one system snapshot per file (approx  
100-200 MB per snapshot)
- data set is from atomistic simulation so there is no connectivity  
between any of the data points

Are there any specific recommendations for grid type, topology,  
geometry type etc... that would suit my situation?

If anyone has a sample XML file that fits this type of situation and  
would be willing to share that would be great too!

Many thanks.

Dan

Message-ID: <4858FE11.1040200@ntc.zcu.cz>

Hi all,

I try to visualize a point vector field 'u' using arrow glyphs, but no 
matter how I set 'ScaleFactor' property the arrows stay the same (too 
big). The relevant part of the code is below - what I am doing wrong? I 
have even created the scene in the GUI, saved it into .pvsm file, loaded 
into another script, examined the Glyph proxy and set the Glyph 
properties in my script accordingly. No change :(

...
reader = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader( FileNames = 
[inFileName] )

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

arrows = servermanager.filters.Glyph( Input = reader )
arrows.SelectInputScalars = [ '', '', '', '', 'p' ]
arrows.SelectInputVectors = [ '1', '', '', '', 'u' ]
arrows.ScaleMode = 1
arrows.Orient = 1
arrows.ScaleFactor = 0.001
arrows.Source = servermanager.sources.ArrowSource()

arep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( arrows, view )

view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()
camera = view.GetActiveCamera()
camera.Elevation( 45 )
view.StillRender()
...

Hi Robert,

To create a glyph filter using python scripting I always use something like:

sourceArrow = servermanager.sources.ArrowSource()
sourceCone = servermanager.sources.ConeSource()
sourceCube = servermanager.sources.CubeSource()
sourceCylinder = servermanager.sources.CylinderSource()
sourceLine = servermanager.sources.LineSource()
sourceSphere = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
sourceGlyph2D = servermanager.sources.GlyphSource2D()
sourcePoint = servermanager.sources.PointSource()

Glyph01 =
servermanager.filters.Glyph(registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='Gl
yph01',Input=SurfVec01)
propertyGlyph01 = Glyph01.GetProperty('Source')

domainGlyph01 = propertyGlyph01.GetDomain('proxy_list');

Hi all,

I try to visualize a point vector field 'u' using arrow glyphs, but no 
matter how I set 'ScaleFactor' property the arrows stay the same (too 
big). The relevant part of the code is below - what I am doing wrong? I 
have even created the scene in the GUI, saved it into .pvsm file, loaded 
into another script, examined the Glyph proxy and set the Glyph 
properties in my script accordingly. No change :(

...
reader = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader( FileNames = 
[inFileName] )

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

arrows = servermanager.filters.Glyph( Input = reader )
arrows.SelectInputScalars = [ '', '', '', '', 'p' ]
arrows.SelectInputVectors = [ '1', '', '', '', 'u' ]
arrows.ScaleMode = 1
arrows.Orient = 1
arrows.ScaleFactor = 0.001
arrows.Source = servermanager.sources.ArrowSource()

arep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( arrows, view )

view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()
camera = view.GetActiveCamera()
camera.Elevation( 45 )
view.StillRender()
...

Whoops, now I can see what was wrong... I should stop today.

arrows.ScaleFactor = 0.001
instead of
arrows.SetScaleFactor = 0.001

It works now, thanks Sylvester!

BTW. how do I color the glyphs according to their magnitude?
If you happen to have a complete example code with colorbars, opacity
setting, etc. that you could share I would be very happy. :) The public
documentation is a little bit terse (I do not have the manual).

Is it possible to force paraview to report something/raise an error if
one sets an attribute that is not a valid property name? The mistake
that I made is very difficult to detect for a paraview newbie...

cheers,

Hi Kent.

Unfortunately no.

The reader itself will produce a uniform grid only if it is given an
xdmf file that defines a single structured grid. If there are two or
more grids it will produce a composite data set and then you have to
extract blocks to get each out.

Also, there is no filter in paraview that will merge uniform grids
together into a single uniform grid. There almost certainly is one in
VTK/Imaging, but it is not enabled and might be hard to use in
paraview because of the difficulty in making sure the data sets all
combine to create a nice structured data set.

CVS of paraview can volume render composite data sets, but only one
block at a time.

Dave DeMarle

Concerning scalar bars:
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-January/006766.html

The opacity is a property of the representation, I expect. (repGlyph01 is
the example below)

Not only is the public documentation sparse on this subject, but the new
ParaView Guide as well. I am really disappointed in it, as contains hardly
any more information (if any at all) on python scripting than in the
Servermanager2.pdf file available in the Wiki.

Thanks again!

Yes, simply 'repr.Opacity = 0.5' works for a DataSetSurfaceFilter 
representation. But depending on whether I run my script with python or 
pvpython it does or does not work for a Glyph representation. Strange. I 
have to try installing paraview from sources.

To color the glyphs according to their magnitude I tried to attach a 
lookup table analogously to what Jean Favre advised me:
########
arrows = servermanager.filters.Glyph( Input = reader )
arrows.SelectInputScalars = [ '', '', '', '', 'p' ]
arrows.SelectInputVectors = [ '1', '', '', '', 'u' ]
arrows.SetScaleMode = 1
arrows.SetOrient = 1
arrows.SetScaleFactor = 0.01
arrows.Source = sourceArrow
arep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation( arrows, view )

lut = servermanager.rendering.PVLookupTable()
lut.RGBPoints = [0, 0, 0, 1,
                  1, 1, 0, 0]
lut.ColorSpace = 1 # HSV

arep.ColorAttributeType = 1
arep.ColorArrayName = 'u'
arep.LookupTable = lut
#########
... But it is ignored.

Well, anyway, thanks to Servermanager2.pdf and the mailing list I have 
already got somewhere. Things start looking promising.

Subject: [Paraview] problems after compilation with gcc
Message-ID: <485945FA.8030602@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

I have recently recompiled both the CVS Paraview and my reader plugins 
to find the following:

1) one of my (XML, GUI+SM) reader plugins is no longer recognized: no 
error, just silent ignorance. It was recognized when everything was 
compiled with the Intel compiler.

2) PV segfaults with another plugin on reading a dataset with PV 
compiled in RELEASE mode. Compiled with DEBUG mode there is no crash, so 
I believe something goes wrong with gcc and the RELEASE optimizations. 
The same codes worked fine as well with the Intel compiler in RELEASE mode.

Any hints how to start debugging?

Thanks
Dominik

Hey Dan,

I look at data which are time series simulating cells swimming around  
in a 3D volume, so maybe it's similar enough (although I think your  
data sets are much larger than mine).

The grid should have a TopologyType="Polyvertex", and then for me, my  
data sets are saved with the positions of the cells in an nCells x 3  
array for x,y,z, so I use GeometryType="XYZ". My Xdmf files are a bit  
strange because I use hyperslabs to split up an nCells x 4 array by  
column into four separate scalar arrays.

Here's an example with five time steps, which are all stored in the  
same HDF5 file (not attached). You can see that after the first few  
time steps the number of particles changes with each time step in this  
case.

Maybe someone else can advise you the best way to get all your ASCII  
data into HDF5. I would probably use a Python script and the PyTables  
package (which makes accessing the HDF5 easy) to convert the data  
since I've had good luck using it to go the other way (from HDF5 to  
other formats) when needed. I also use this combination to generate  
my .xmf files since my collaborators just dump out HDF5 directly and I  
need to build the XML file afterwards to get it all into ParaView.

Hope this helps,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph Cell Data [CVS]
Message-ID: <594C01F5-339A-460F-9371-1BE76672E75E@gmail.com>

I have an unstructured grid that has vectors associated with cells. I  
thought I used to be able to Glyph these vectors with Arrows? I have  
been poking around in ParaView3 CVS and the best I can glyph is the  
point data. Maybe I am remembering PV 2.6? Is this possible in PV3?  
Do I need to convert the cell data to point data which seems counter- 
intuitive and possibly wrong.

Thanks for any help

Subject: [Paraview] Selection Inspector off the window bounds [CVS]
Message-ID: <18212E2E-74DA-4663-8F31-958FE13B4CF4@gmail.com>

I think I found an "issue" with the "Selection Inspector" and  
probably any other "Dockable" window that is "pulled off" into its  
own window. Say I am running 2 monitors and I put the selection  
Inspector on the second screen. Then I shutdown everything and go  
mobile where I only have the built in monitor. When I use the menu to  
try and view the "Selection Inspector" it is no where to be found.  
Where might I start hacking into the code to check the window  
boundaries versus the position of the torn off window?

I remember doing this for the actual main paraview window so the  
logic should be the same.

Thanks

Unfortunately, not... I'm forwarding the reply I got from Jerry Clark 
whom confirmed me that XDMF does not support wildcards. My problem is 
similar with yours, a bunch of time steps producing heavy XDMF files 
where XML blocks are being repeated unnecessarily. Just a wildcard 
representing the name patterns would solve the problem.

Regards

Renato.

P.S.: I'm copying this message to the mail list since, I guess, it's an 
important (and simple in some sense) feature to be future implemented in 
XDMF.

It is not the question of the compiler, it is the CVS checkout date. The
problem is not there for me in the version checked out 05 May, problem
is there with the version from 17 June. Compilers and compilation
options the same.

Again: when PV is compiled in DEBUG mode nothing crashes. If compiled 
with gcc (but not icc) with RELEASE mode then crash. gdb's bet: "cerr << 
"hello world" << endl", the first line of my plugin's RequestData.

I don't know if I would consider this to be a ParaView problem rather 
than an Window Manager issue. I am pretty sure 90% of my applications 
due the same thing on my OSX machine, I have resorted to using an Apple 
Script to fix the problem.

That's a new function in Qt 4.4.

Perhaps the link error is because you're actually linking against Qt 4.3 
libraries?  But using Qt 4.4 headers?

Hi all,

Thanks for all the previous help. Just want to clarify something.. I
understand that D3 filter ( which used the KD tree ) can be used to load
balanced the unstructured grid. I have tried that. Now, I am trying the
polydata files. The files were automatically balanced, is there some way I
can find out what filters or what methodologies are applied in doing this.

Thanks in advance

 firstly it cmake can not find the QT_EXECUTABLE values, I set the value %QTINSTALL-DIR%/bin/qmake

 but it still errored message that cannot find Qt...


 how to solve that ...?

%QTDIR%/bin/qmake

And make sure QTDIR is defined.

Also, I think for the latest PV you may need Qt 4.3.x.

Hi, I'm a novice of paraview so I beg your pardon if I submit an already 
discussed problem. I had many problems playing with the camera because 
it seems the min-max range of the possible values spans the interval 
[-10000 ,+10000]. This limits sound strange to me, I wondered why it 
hasn't been set a much higher value. For example, in my case, I had a 
model in mm, thus it was easy to reach the upper and lower bound, 
causing a crazy behavior of the final view. Two questions about this:

1) Has anybody already faced such a problem?
2) Is it possible to somehow alter these bounds?

Another non-related issue:

3) If I load a huge mesh (around 8 millions of elements) Paraview 
suddenly crashes because a failed memory allocation. Would it be 
possible in the future to have a smoother failure, maybe through a popup 
warning that the memory limits have been reached? This would be 
extremely helpful both for a cleaner behavior and to avoid a waste of 
time because of a not yet saved state.

Thanks in advance

Davide

On my system I use ssh to login to the remote machine and mpirun to
spawn the parallel pvserver process. Once I have ssh configured such
that I can type "ssh remotemachine command" on the command line and
see the result of "command" from the remote system without a login
prompt, and once I have mpi configured on the remote machine such that
I can log into the remote machine and run "mpirun -np numproc
pvserver" and see the "Listen on port:11111 Waiting for client...."
message. Then I can put this command into the command mode dialog:
"ssh remotemachine mpirun -np numproc pvserver" and have the client
start up the server for me.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

There are no set limits, but multiple readers have run into problems with camera movement when the geometry bounds of the data are very large or very small (see bug #5576 http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=5576).  I'm pretty sure they are due to some rounding issues with a 32-bit float somewhere.  However, they usually don't occur unless the bounds exceed +/-1e13.  I've never seen it on bounds as small as yours.  Can you describe your data further?

Try using the Transform filter and apply a scale to make the bounds smaller.

I think everyone agrees that would be ideal, but unfortunately requires a huge level of effort.  Also, any solution would be difficult to test and maintain.

Yes, it does get saved in the .ini file. You can try running with -dr 
option to disable the use of the ini file.

Great.. Where does it get read back out so I can sanity check the  
values?

  I am looking in pqSettings.cxx but nothing is really jumping out at  
me. I do see in the file a large byte array of values though which is  
where I am assuming the data is kept.

You can also delete the "Layout" section under "MainWindow" in the .ini file.

To possibly save your time, the bug has already been reported to Trolltech.
http://trolltech.com/developer/task-tracker/index_html?method=entry&id=211712
The proper fix for this would go into Qt, not ParaView.
I just added my vote to help it get fixed quicker.

Yes! cmake only says one must use Qt 4.3 "or later". Isn't 4.4 "later"? It seems not. When I switched back to 4.3.5 I edited the CMakeCache.txt file to remove all Qt references but must have missed one. Thanks!

Bug 0007223 submitted and Fixed. Tested on OS X 10.4.11.

Looking at the Qt tracker I am not real confident that will not come  
back and say that is an issue for the client app to deal with.

Anyways, until they have a fix, mine seems to work and I learned a  
bit in the process.

It is very straightforward to install the qt and cmake packages if you have
administrative privileges (i.e., "sudo").  You can use either the "apt-get"
command or the GUI-based tool "synaptic".  The key packages you will want to
install are "qt4-dev-tools" and "cmake".  There are some other packages you
may wish to install, such as python, and you can search for these and
install them easily with the synaptic package manager GUI.

Hope this helps,

      Hi,everyone,few day ago,when buliding Paraview3.2.3 with cmake2.6 , 

      I questioned about the Qt-Not-found problem.

      At the same time, thers is some error tips about cmake

      error code is :

      System is unknown to cmake,create:
      ......filename.....................
      please send you config file to cmake at ........ so it can be added to cmake.


      fourtunatelly, then I used the cmake2.4,the Qt could be found ,but the above cmake problem was still there. what can i do ,where was the config file?

Hi Kenneth, thanks for your reply. What I saw is that the min-max values 
of the camera spinbuttons are, as I said, [-10000,+10000]. Even trying 
to modify them by hands by clicking on the spinbutton arrows I couldn't 
exceed those values. Then I guessed they were strong bounds of the 
camera settings. My version is the 3.3.0, thus the last one, I guess. 
I've found a workaround by rescaling my mesh by a factor 1000, by doing 
this the camera works fine. However, this is clearly a temporary 
solution, just a trick to fix the problem. Can you change the camera 
bounds beyond those limits? I think my problem is not due to any 
rounding issue, but just to (strange) bounds on the min-max allowed 
camera values. And if the mesh is in mm is not that unusual to reach the 
bounds while playing with the camera.

scaling by means of the transform filter works fine. It is the same I 
did before to fix the problem, even if at that time I did it outside 
Paraview within the mesh generator.

I understand that a clean, fully satisfactory solution it's not 
straightforward but all the crashes I got have been due to failed 
mallocs, then a first step for future releases might be a simple check 
on the allocated memory, that now I guess is sometimes missing, 
eventually popping up a warning when the allocation fails. I can imagine 
that there are many calls to mallocs all over the code, thus this may 
require some time. However, I think this effort is worthwhile and, at 
this first level, I don't think it would be too complicate to test and 
maintain.

Anyway, thanks for all your hints

Oh.  You're talking about the widgets in the camera position dialog.  I didn't realize that it was still using those stupid spin boxes.  I just checked a change into cvs that changed them to use line edits so that you could enter data at any precision.  The disadvantage of the change that it is harder to read the values after the camera is moved with the mouse.

Subject: [Paraview] Client-Server Fails on Altix
Message-ID: <485FC140.5020101@psc.edu>

The interactive version of PV works fine but when using pvserver (1 or 4 processes) all attempts to add to the display (e.g., a source of box or sphere) only yields this message:

ERROR: In .../ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkPVDataInformation.cxx, line 971
vtkPVDataInformation (0x9e93040): Error parsing data set type.

I also get the now-expected warnings about being unable to connect to an X server.

System: SGI Altix 4700, Itanium2 ia64
OS: enhanced version of SuSE
Compiler: g++ 4.1.2
Cmake: 2.6.0
ParaView: from CVS around June 13
Qt: 4.3.5
Mesa: 7.0.1

Any ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] Only One Color Scale Feature/Bug
Message-ID: <1214237810.30571.10.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

Is it a feature, or a bug that there is only one color scale in
ParaView?

I want to color several objects differently by their scalar value. That
is I want volume 1 colored black for 0 and red for 255, volume 2 black
to green, and so on. Whenever I change the color scale of one object the
color scale is changed for every object.

Is this deliberate? I can see how this would make sense so that there
only has to be one color key, and so that the color always means the
same thing.

It is a feature that all scalar fields with the same name have the same color map and scale.  This is to prevent confusion with renderings in different views or from data at different pipeline changes.

You can have different color maps and scales for variables with different names.  A simple (but not particularly efficient) way of changing a variables name is to run the data through the calculator filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Resize Issues with OS X [CVS]
Message-ID: <FBDA16EA-8A56-4A65-B43F-4F1B8C44933B@gmail.com>

I am trying to track down a bug that occurs when you select the  
"green" maximize button on OS X. The window correctly resizes but the  
render view does not seem to fully update itself. The render view  
looks to have resized itself but there is a large white area where  
the new larger render area should be. As a test I compiled the VTK  
examples and ran the GUISupport/Qt/Events test program and that does  
NOT show this issue. I was rummaging around in the QVTKWidget but  
everything seems to be executing correctly.
    Might someone "in-the-know" point me to some other locations that  
would be causing this issue?

   From my simple experiment above it would seem that the problem  
lies with ParaView is using the QVTKWidget and not the QVTKWidget  
itself. Maybe an event is getting swallowed somewhere? It just seems  
that ParaView needs to issue one last "update" to the render view.


Thanks for any help.

What version of Qt are you using?
I've seen this too in Qt 4.3.0 to 4.3.3.  The regression was fixed in Qt 
4.3.4.
Its a limitation in the Carbon Toolkit that Qt and the QVTKWidget need to 
cooperate to overcome.  When we go to Cocoa, I'm assuming this complexity 
will go away.

with that.

Are you running the client on the same machine? By any chance, do the
client and server have different VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS set?

Are you clipping something that starts off as structured?  In this case, the output data is converted to unstructured data, which can handle the irregular cell shapes that can result from the cut but has much less efficient storage.  In this case you are probably running out of memory.

Try using the slice filter instead of the cut filter.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Installation

Because when I say

ccmake $HOME/projects/ParaView3

it gave me the following error:
 CMake Error: Qt 4.3.0 or greater not found.  Please check the
 QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable.

 Qt was not found
Could you help, please?

Thanks,

Samuele.

It is very straightforward to install the qt and cmake packages if you have

administrative privileges (i.e., "sudo").  You can use either the "apt-get"

command or the GUI-based tool "synaptic".  The key packages you will want to

install are "qt4-dev-tools" and "cmake".  There are some other packages you

may wish to install, such as python, and you can search for these and

install them easily with the synaptic package manager GUI.



Hope this helps,

Julian C.

I have installed a new OS (Ubuntu 8.04) and I am finding it

very difficult to re-install Paraview.

I have to install both QT and cmake...

Could anyone help?

The client is 32-bit and the server is 64-bit, with VTK_USE_64BIT_ID off and on, respectively.

However ... I've had no problem using this same client system and pvserver on another 64-bit system with VTK_USE_64BIT_ID on.

The client and server that work together run CentOS. The other server with the new problem runs SUSE. All use PV CVS but downloaded at slightly different times.

Suggestions welcome!

Hi there.
I have just installed paraview under SUSE linux (from source) and it doesn't
come with the python console enabled. Does someone know how to get it to
work without reinstall the whole software?
Thanks for your help!

Subject: [Paraview] Reader format changes since version 2.4?
Message-ID: <654886.34838.qm@web59505.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I'm making a custom reader for ParaView using a
proprietary custom library.  The most recent print
documentation I have for doing this is the ParaView
Guide version 2.4 .  Is this documentation current
enough?  If not, should I be scrounging through the
source code for something newer to use as an example? 
The format I'm importing from is 3d and will not need
any animation features.

My slower system is a G4 Macintosh with 1 Gig of RAM
and am developing with XCode 2.4.1 although I am
building from makefiles in order to dodge the
restrictions of the XCode project files under CMake. 
I will also be supporting Intel Macintoshes and
Windows-based systems in the near future.

Thanks in advance for any help,

--Sam

Message-ID: <6CDD60864A1CCF49B95D5FF1E63EC79205CBBD1D@UKDEWEB005.uk.rolls-royce.com>

I am running a server on a linux machine (64 bit) and connecting with a
windows client (32 bit).  Initially when connecting (on the win32
client) I get the message "Server DISPLAY not accessible".  Then, as
soon as it tries to render something (anything!), the server crashes
with the following error.

Jaco,

That would be easy to do using pvbatch and a batch script. The book and Wiki contain notes on such scripts which are written in Python. It can be tricky at first to create the visualizations but its quite powerful.

I don't know whether pvbatch comes with the binary download. It is created  by default when you compile from source.

Hey PV gurus: is there a "repository" of batch scripts somewhere? I have a few I could contribute.

Looks like you are using CVS client. Are you sure that the client and 
the server are of the same version?

Are you using gcc 4.3.x?

Try adding the <cstring> and <cstdlib> headers to 
/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfObject.h

i.e. for my linux box, i needed to update the header to:

# ifdef UNIX
#  include "sys/file.h"
#  include "strings.h"
#  include <cstring>                                  // ADDED

#  define STRCASECMP strcasecmp
#  define STRNCASECMP strncasecmp

It is the CVS version - but both are compiled from the same checkout.

Looks like you are using CVS client. Are you sure that the client and 
the server are of the same version?

Hmm, strange. Do the following:

* Verify that "void RemoveAllSelectionsInputs()" is defined in 
ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkPVExtractSelection.h on the server side.
* Verify that in the binary directory there exists a file 
vtkPVExtractSelectionClientServer.cxx (under 
ParaView3Bin/Servers/Filters/). This file should have 
"RemoveAllSelectionsInputs()" call made somewhere.

As you probably already suspect, the crash is caused by a buffer overrun during a sprintf call.  I did not fix the problem, but I made it less likely.  I changed the buffer size from 512 to 1024 (so 600 will work, but don't go to 6000).  I also changed the update mechanism so that the scalar bar does not update on every key entry into the label format widget but rather only when you hit enter or that widget loses focus.

I have a similar problem. I did a python-vtk script that animates time  
dependent results and creates a movie. But doing visualization that  
way is much much more cumbersome than using paraview. I have read the  
server manager pdf file, but it only describes time manipulation with  
reader that have built in time support.
How could I set up paraview animation engine through python scripting,  
without any reader that have time support ?

Here is a "pseudo Python" script to do that. Sorry I don't have time to cleanup and post my batch script. In this I am assuming that the reader cannot properly switch from one file to another correctly so a new instance of the reader is created for each file.

=======
initialize PV in Python
   I'll call the instance of RenderView "view"
create entire pipeline except for the reader
   this is something like filter1->filter2->filter3
   create a representation of the final filter
   don't forget to set the camera
for N input files
   set the strings "infile" and "outfile"
   create reader and set "infile"
   connect the reader to filter1
   view.StillRender() (may not be needed but seems to help)
   view.WriteImage( outfile, "vtkPNGWriter" )
      this updates the pipeline which reads the input
   delete the reader
======

The values for the "infile" string could be anything. You could even have your Python script to read them from a file.

In the loop pick strings for "outfile" like "frame0000.png", "frame0001.png", etc. When done use a good movie encoder to convert the frames to a movie file.

pvbatch will probably display each frame. On the command line it will accept the option "--use-offscreen-rendering" but I'm not sure if that will eliminate the display (you might need to link to Mesa).

Note that such a script does NOT use the ParaView animator and so you will be missing many of the great features. Nevertheless, if all you want to do is loop over input files, it gets the job done.

Hello,

I'm using the ParaView development version (3.3.0) and I'm observing a
speed loss compared to the releases (reading, filtering and animating of
bigger data sets takes about 30% more time). Is there any special flag
or part in the development version, that is slowing everything down? I
tested ParaView 3.3.0 from cvs and the release 3.2.1, both compiled with
shared libraries..

Thanks in advance

Is this possible? I am running paraview 3.3.0

Michael,

Could you provide some more info?

 - what type of data? (structured, unstructured, multiblock, ...)
 - system? (Linux, Windows, ...)
 - visualization? (slice, isosurface, volume, ...)
 - large? (1M polygons, 10M polygons, ...)

Hi,
We are also looking to measure performance. However, we were hoping to 
access performance data through the python interface. Is this possible?

To be on the safe side, I would try:

* Client/server built from the exact same source
* Both set to the same VTK_USE_64BIT_ID (I recommend off)

Yes. It is possible (although not trivial). Try this:

sm = servermanager
ti = sm.vtkPVTimerInformation()
pm = sm.vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule()
pm.GatherInformation(sm.ActiveConnection.ID, 1, ti,
pm.GetProcessModuleIDAsInt())
ti.GetNumberOfLogs()
ti.GetLog(0)

For more information, look at the doxygen pages of
vtkPVTimerInformation and vtkProcessModule.

Subject: [Paraview] BUG: Same Variables name
Message-ID: <48628401.7090008@gmail.com>

I was loading a PVD file that had 4 variables with the same name. 
Paraview just quit without any warning and without even a single alert. 
But since I was using my converter from Plot3D to PVD, I figured that I 
didn't change the names of the variables. Otherwise I wouldn't find out 
why the program crashes.

I suggest creatin an option of changing the similar variables names by a 
counter or somethin.

There seems to be no link to the Bug area from the main PV site. I've looked under Help, FAQ and Wiki.  Are the Bugs hiding on purpose?

Nope, not on purpose. We'll fix it when we update the paraview web pages soon.

Subject: [Paraview] ERROR with 3.3.0
Message-ID: <1b61cab90806252138l5e70ebc9n3461a165e36a87b3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When I read a legacy VTK file like

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
TEST DATA
BINARY
DATASET RECTILINEAR_GRID
DIMENSIONS 49 97 897
X_COORDINATES 49 FLOAT
...(x-coordinate binary data)...
Y_COORDINATES 97 FLOAT
...(y-coordinate binary data)...
Z_COORDINATES 897 FLOAT
...(z-coordinate binary data)...
CELL_DATA 4128768
SCALARS dens FLOAT
LOOKUP_TABLE default
...(scalar binary data)...
SCALARS erad FLOAT
LOOKUP_TABLE default
...(scalar binary data)...
...

with paraview-3.3.0 and try to display "Surface", I get an error message like

ERROR: In /Users/shirose/src/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDataSet.cxx, line 439
vtkPolyData (0x21786c10): Cell array dens with 1 components, has only
0 tuples but there are 384 cells

Then when I try to display scalar data "dens" rather than solid color,
paraview fails suddenly.

But, the VTK file can be read by paraview-3.2.1 with no error message
and works fine.

Does anyone have any idea on this error?

Thank you.
Shigenobu

I'm embarrassed, it was my fault - while I compiled the same client, I
didn't change the symlink to the new paraview build on the linux system.

Sorry for wasting your time,
Paul

Hmm, strange. Do the following:

* Verify that "void RemoveAllSelectionsInputs()" is defined in 
ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkPVExtractSelection.h on the server side.
* Verify that in the binary directory there exists a file 
vtkPVExtractSelectionClientServer.cxx (under 
ParaView3Bin/Servers/Filters/). This file should have 
"RemoveAllSelectionsInputs()" call made somewhere.

Did you build ParaView with PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON set to ON when 
configuring using CMake?

Hey All,

Has anyone ever read any XDMF data into ParaView which has the 2d XY  
GeometryType?

I have a sudden need for it, and it's not working (PV sometimes loads  
okay, but shows strange values for coordinates & crashes on  
animation). I can track down more specifically what it's doing some  
other time, but I was just curious whether anyone has ever tried it  
and/or gotten it to work?

Thanks,
-Eric

Hi,
 
I am looking for one solution to get my results made in Paraview into Blender. Exists any script who can do this?
 
I would like a better representation of my fluid. Paraview is good but i would like to put some refraction in some fluid and use raytracing or a good render. What do you recomend me? Indigo is a good solution?
 
Thanks in advance.

Hi, 

You can also use the x3d exporter of paraview available in the ParaView 
cvs (File->Export  *.x3d) and import it into blender with the scripts 
available at

Subject: [Paraview] Fedora mpi packaging
Message-ID: <4863D080.1010403@cora.nwra.com>

I'm the packager for the Fedora paraview package.  Currently I've been 
making "normal" and "mpi" packages compiled without and with openmpi 
support respectively.  Currently the mpi version is busted and I'm 
working on fixing it with the help of Tyson Whitehead who filed a 
helpful bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=450598

My current question is what binaries need mpi versions?  Just about 
everything ends up with openmpi dependencies:

But I'm guessing you could use a non-mpi "paraview" binary to connect to 
  a parallel running pvserver just fine.  Does it make sense to ship mpi 
versions of these other binaries?

Yes. I don't think the mpi version of "paraview" actually uses mpi. You definitely need the mpi version of pvbatch and pvserver; I don't know about the others.

paraview, pvpython and pvTestDriver shouldn't have MPI
pvbatch, pvserver, pvdataserver and pvrenderserver do.

Follow up -

  Would it make sense to have "client" and "server" packages?  If so, 
what would go where?

Thanks!

I don't think so. The "client" package would only contain one binary, "paraview", which is also the standalone binary.

However, separating the packages would allow a paraview server to be installed 
on a machine without a bunch of extra prerequisites (I'm not sure how many 
that would be).

Although it would make sense to separate the two, it would probably
require duplication of some files. The client would have paraview and
pvpython, the server pvbatch, pvserver, pvdataserver, pvrenderserver.
However, pvpython and pvbatch both depend on some .py files. To do it
really right, you would have to do something like:

* ParaView python core - all .py files (this package is useless by itself)
* ParaView client (paraview and pvpython) depends on python, Qt and
ParaView python core
* ParaView server (pvbatch, pvserver, pvdataserver, pvrenderserver)
depends on python, mpi and ParaView python core

I may be missing some dependencies here...

On second thought, it may not be as easy as I described before. All
paraview binaries link against vtkParallel which links against MPI. If
you want to distribute a non-mpi client and an mpi server, you would
have to distribute multiple sets of shared libraries (which may be
acceptable).

Yeah, I ship two sets of libraries (one mpi, one not).  But it seems 
like it might be useful to have:

paraview - contains paraview/pvpython, installed on front ends
paraview-server - non-mpi server
paraview-server-mpi - mpi server

You need to stick pvbatch, serial and parallel, in there somewhere. It is usefull when generating 10,000 frames for a video.

Subject: [Paraview] building a custom viewer from the example
Message-ID: <646303.7006.qm@web59504.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

While I'm waiting for the latest edition of the ParaView Guide and CMake manual to arrive, I'm trying to compile a slight variation of the example reader for ParaView version 3.2.2 .? I've modified it to call vtkTIFFReader instead of vtkPNGReader.  I've changed every instance of PNG to TIFF in the XML files.  Also, I've modified the CMake script in accordance with the Wiki so it starts with the following two lines of code:

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

When I point the CMake script entry "MyTIFFReader_SOURCE_DIR" with the directory containing the files I've described, CMake attempts to configure with an error stating that it can't find the directory I've pointed it to and fails with an Include in the call stack.  I'm using the full absolute path.  Am I supposed to point it somewhere else?

I'm building this with the Unix Makefiles option on a Mac PowerBook G4 with 1 GB of RAM and MacOSX 10.4.11 .

Thanks in advance,

--Sam

Yes.  You just have to expose properties of the target reader in the SM XML proxy.

As I hope you already know, to use vtkFileSeriesReader, you create a proxy object with the FileSeriesReaderProxy tag (in lieu of SourceProxy) and, among other things, you have a SubProxy named "Reader" which is the type of the target reader.  Just add ExposedProperties for the Reader SubProxy and they will be exposed to the GUI.

I made a Wiki page recently concerning using the vtkFileSeriesReader that has a few more details.  I would consult that if you have not yet.

I tried that option, and my property widgets are not showing up ( 
checkboxes ), I have attached the xml that is causing the problems.

Subject: [Paraview] Hidden Line Removal in ParaView
Message-ID: <21f0b0400806270450j282a814epdb3c255bca6b44a8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

How I can enable hidden line removal in Paraview ? I have large
wireframe model and I would like to see the front edges only.

Thanks.

Hello,

Is there any way to control the polygon offset technique to view both
surface and wireframe model clearly in Paraview ?

Thanks.

Are you using the "Surface with edges" representation mode? ParaView 
doesn't provide user-changeable parameters from changing the offsets. 
But if you are building from source, you can take a look at 
"ParaView3Source/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx: ~189"  and change 
the following set of lines as per your choice.

vtkMapper::SetResolveCoincidentTopologyToPolygonOffset();
// We offset lines/vertices.
vtkMapper::SetResolveCoincidentTopologyPolygonOffsetFaces(0);
vtkMapper::SetResolveCoincidentTopologyPolygonOffsetParameters(-1.0, -1.0);

Fixed, mostly. When client and server are built from the exact same source (from CVS) it works when the client uses 32-bit IDs and when the server uses either 32-bit or 64-bit IDs.

Unfortunately, it seems that our users must now switch their clients to the same CVS version as the server on the Altix. For example, the 3.2.1 client fails with this message:

===
Handshake failed. You are probably using mismatching versions of client and server.
===

Could someone involved with this part of ParaView comment, in general, on using a client with a server of a different version?

Kent,

Unfortunately there's no easy way around the requirement that the 
client-server versions must match. The client assumes what the server 
side provides in terms of classes, their API etc. These keep on 
changing. For example, the composite dataset stuff changed a great deal 
between 3.2 and the current CVS. Consequently, if a 3.2 client connected 
to a CVS server and started creating old composite data filters, the 
server can do nothing but abort().

Hi Michael,

Do you think there is still a difference between 3.2 and cvs?

Subject: [Paraview] Bug Reading pvti Files?
Message-ID: <4864F0E7.5010602@psc.edu>

Not sure if this is a bug. A new program of mine creates a pvti file that reference two vti files in the same directory. No errors are produced when PV reads the pvti file but the 2nd vti file seems to be ignored.

In the attached image the top object is what the pvti reader produces. A slice through just the right half has a min,max of 0,0.

The middle object results when only the "left" vti file is read; and the bottom when only the "right" vti file is read. Obviously the "right" file contains valid numbers.

The files without the binary parts are below. I hope someone can spot some simple mistake I've made.

OS: CentOS 5, 32-bit
PV: CVS downloaded June 25 at 4:42pm
Compiler: gcc 4.1.2
CMake: 2.4.6

This is a major problem for a project here and so all advice will be very much appreciated!

Maybe there's a better way, but you can fake it by setting your object 
to "Surfaces With Edges" representation mode then in the view 
properties, make the background black, and turn the lights off.

Okay I solved the problem, had a small mistake in the xml file, and no 
error was being raised. Thanks for the help.

Thanks, I think you are right. After reading your bug report I created and uploaded a very simple test case consisting of only 2 cubes, 2 points on a side each. It was a complete failure even when running in serial.

The code that selects "pieces" from the files to match the "pieces" of the update request is quite complex. The bug is probably in that section. Maybe using the name "pieces" for two different things contributed to the confusion.

This looks like a fundamental error in one of the basic VTK file readers. I strongly urge that a fix be given high priority. 

P.S. I removed my long, original post from this reply since one can find it in the archives or look at the bug report.

Subject: [Paraview] libQtPython fails to link/install - CVS
Message-ID: <48651A68.50408@vt.edu>

Hi,
I checked out the CVS version of ParaView this morning at 9:15 EST. 
Although PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON, and the object files were built, the 
libQtPython.so failed to link and install. Even running `sudo make 
install` within the Qt/Python directory did nothing although I do see 
the object files within the Qt/Python/CMakeFiles directory. Other 
libQt*.so libs were installed - libQtAssistantClient.so, libQtCore.so, 
libQtNetwork.so, libQtTesting.so, libQtXml.so, libQtChart.so, 
libQtGui.so, libQtSql.so, libQtTest.so

This is an out-of-source build. My CMakeCache.txt file is attached.

cmake-2.4.8
gcc-4.1.2
python-2.5.1
qt-4.3.5

Thanks,
Pat

Hello,

Can someone tell me how to rotate objects continuously as we can
do with OpenInventor ?  Currently, I am rotating by mouse to see
the object from different angle and it is not somewhat painful.

Thanks,

Can you try adding a

#include <stdlib.h>

towards the top of
/home/rreis/on_hold/src/paraview/ParaView3/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx?

Please let me know if it works so that I can fix cvs.

I am afraid that interaction mode is not available in ParaView. It is
not difficult to implement but this is the first request we received
for it. Please file a feature request here: http://paraview.org/Bug

I am guessing as much. The fixes for gcc 4.3 are in the development
version but not in 3.2.1. We will have to create a new source
distribution (3.2.2). I will see if we can do that next week.

Subject: [Paraview] libQtPython fails to link/install - CVS

Hi Berk,
In ParaView-3.2.x and before (2.6 was the same I believe) the 
VTK_USE_RPATH was a non-advanced option defaulting to OFF and would show 
up when running cmake or ccmake without looking at advanced options. In 
the CVS version it appears only in the advanced options, defaults to ON 
and therefore does not encourage verifying its state. Is this behavior 
just for CVS to make it easier for the developers? If not, could it be 
returned to its former behavior?

Anyway, that did fix the issue with the libs.

Thanks,
Pat

Message-ID: <60ED6983-8EEE-469F-9709-8062E9E0F7B4@berkeley.edu>

Hello, I am looking for advice to see if this is achievable (I believe  
it should be), and how to do it.

I have matlab data consisting of an array of particles (spheres) where  
I know the radius and center points of each sphere:  centers = [x1 y1  
z1; x2 y2 z2; x3 y3 z3; ....].  I also have transient data about the  
temperature of each particle (assumed to be constant per particle) in  
a matrix:  temperatures = [t1_s1 t2_s1 t3_s1; t1_s2 t2_s2 t3_s2; t1_s3  
t2_s3 t3_s3; ....].

Is it possible to import this data into paraview and use the sphere  
command to plot all of the data?  The dataset can be large with the  
number of particles ranging up to 400k.  In matlab, there was no need  
to store discretized information about the particle other than the  
center locations because I assumed constant properties throughout each  
particle.

I know about the vtk matlab wiki and storing the data as an ascii  
file, but is there a way to set in the ascii file that the points  
correspond to sphere centers and not a mesh of points for each sphere?

Thanks for any help!
Mike

Subject: [Paraview] Gradient (Unstructured) filter
Message-ID: <fd5546a50806280500q318af9a3l5bed1117e0ca88bb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
I am trying to get the gradient of a scalar field that is stored in an
unstructured grid. This is time-dependent data grouped using a PVD file.
When I add the Gradient (Unstructured) filter, it only gives me the
magnitude of the gradient. I need to get just the gradient. Has anybody run
into this issue?

Thank you,

Alessandro

Subject: [Paraview] paraview bug
Message-ID: <92f19da0806281324n5cef8cdaq6d804249ffd415f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am writing an ascii xml file for an unstructured mesh.  I have
scalar and vector data on lines.  If I have any vector data listed
before scalar data, I get a crash upon hitting the apply button in
paraview:
ERROR: In /home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx,
line 532
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0x8aeed88): Cannot read cell data array
"ElectricField" from PointData in piece 1.  The data array in the
element may be too short.

This is how I am declaring data to be vector data.
<DataArray Name="ElectricField" type="Float64" NumberOfComponents="3"
format="ascii">

However, if I ensure that the vector data are listed after the scalar
data in the cell data section, everything is cool.

Is this a known issue, or should I file a bug?



Thanks,

Juan

By default, VTK_USE_RPATH is OFF for release versions and ON for
development versions.  The installation should either work with both
settings or print an error when RPATH is ON. I made a note to myself
to fix this in the future.

How do you know it is giving you just the magnitude? Are you trying to
color by it? The filter produces a gradient vector so you should be
able to access individual components of the vector.

What you should do is to create an unstructured grid that has 1 point
per sphere and no geometry (no cells). In this dataset, store the
radius and temperature as point centered attributes. Then you can use
the glyph filter to place a sphere at each point. The sizes of these
sphere can be scaled by the radius attribute. They can also be colored
based on the temperature. The VTK file formats are described here:
http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf. I recommend using the legacy
formats as they are the easiest to write.

When I look at a cross section of the domain using "plot over line", places
where the gradient should be negative, it is always positive. In addition,
the label for the color bar says "Gradient Magnitude" even though that is
not the filter I selected.

I downloaded ParaView 3.3, and that one is letting me choose between
gradient magnitude and each of the components. Version 3.2.1 doesn't let me.

Thanks,

Thanks for the suggestion.  My vector data is defined on lines, not
points.  The glyph filter does not appear allow me to select any of
this data.  Is there any way to make the data selectable, or do I
somehow have to interpolate the celldata onto points?

Thanks,
Juan

You can interpolate the vectors to points or you can use the "Cell
Centers" filter.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 3.2.2 is in Debian
Message-ID: <85b5c3130806300603h6aeb13d2l11e0c1424c307823@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

we finally managed to fix the compilation problems and paraview 3.2.2
entered Debian unstable:

http://packages.debian.org/sid/main/paraview

it should work on i386, amd64 and other architectures. Those using
Debian, please test the package and report all bugs using reportbug.
It will probably enter Ubuntu in couple of days as well.

We had to apply the following patches:

http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/trunk/debian/patches/assistant-qt4.patch?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/trunk/debian/patches/cmake2.6.patch?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/trunk/debian/patches/configure.patch?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/trunk/debian/patches/gcc4.3.patch?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/trunk/debian/patches/install.patch?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/trunk/debian/patches/rpath.patch?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/trunk/debian/patches/search-client-doc-finder-in-fhs-dir.patch?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

I think some of them should be applied to the official sources of
paraview as well, for example the gcc 4.3 fixes.

I just noticed that Christophe has sent the patches here as well:

We fixed the gcc 4.3 issues in cvs. Our approach was slightly
different. We included the C headers instead of their C++ counterparts
(stdlib.h instead of cstdlib etc.) to make sure everything works with
older (really older) compilers that we support for VTK. The cmake 2.6
patch is not needed either. I took a quick look at the other patches,
they seem to be debian installation specific. Please let me know if
there is anything I should look at more carefully.

Hello,

I am using ParaView 3.2.1 and at the right bottom, there is a widget
which display status of the function rendered. May be it is useful for
debugging purposes, or something else, but how can I disable it. I
find this display irritating.

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Surfaces with Edges
Message-ID: <21f0b0400806301104m579e87dcg91cffc40d1bd08a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using ParaView 3.2.1 and in it, I find it extremely useful "Surface
with edges" functionality. Can someone tell me

1.  How can I change the color of Edges only ?
    ( Right now it is always black) ?

2.  Can I change the opacity of the edges only and not the surface ?

3.  How can I have "anti-aliased" surface edges ?


Thanks,

Currently there's no way to disable progress updates from showing up on 
the GUI. Feel free to add a feature request at http://www.paraview.org/Bug

This was reported, and a fix promised for the next release, many months ago.

Excellent, we'll remove the patch once you make a new stable release
from the CVS.

> The cmake 2.6

Without it, the build fails in Debian (or more precisely, it failed
when we were creating the package a few weeks ago), so in this sense
it is needed. Maybe it is possible to fix the problem by some other
way too.

Yes, the other ones are Debian specific, so that the package conforms
to Debian policy.

Subject: [Paraview] Animate a single file
Message-ID: <B05FCC04-FFE5-4CE4-8B09-5F556DB53517@berkeley.edu>

I have timeseries data which consists of several thousand spheres  
(saved as point data -- just center locations and radii) whose  
temperature changes with time.  I am able to import the locations and  
temperatures using both the legacy vtk file format and the newer xml  
vtu format.

Is it possible to animate the temperatures using a single file which  
has all of the timesteps stored as a matrix as opposed to the legacy  
animation method (one timestep per file)?  It becomes cumbersome for  
hundreds of timesteps to keep saving additional files.  It is also a  
pain to have to keep resaving the sphere center locations when they  
remain fixed.

Does anyone have an example of animating a single vtu file?  Is this  
even possible..?

Thanks!
Mike
