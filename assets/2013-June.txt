Subject: [Paraview] Help with batch processing and loops

Hi Nikos,

I think, there are basically two different ways of doing this.

You can set up your visualization in the ParaView GUI, and then write a 
small python script, that changes the filename and saves the images. 
That would look something like this (not tested):

filenames = [list of filenames]
source = GetActiveSource()
for f in filenames:
   source.FileNames = [f]
   Render()
   WriteImage(f+'.png')

For GetActiveSource you have to select the reader first (maybe someone 
has a better way of doing this). You can execute the script with the 
Python Shell.
For details of python syntax, I recommend 
http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html (you don't have to do the 
whole tutorial).

The other way is to record your pipeline with the trace tool (see 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools). Then you can do the same 
loop in the python script, and just execute the script via command line.

Kind regards
Ian

Hi Sean,

Ok, so that means there is no way to run it in the foreground without having an app bundle? The problem is, that somehow I get an

"The application cannot be opened because its executable is missing."

error even though the executable is there AND the Info.plist file is identical to another app bundle that does work. Any ideas where else to look for the problems?

hi I use the ParaViewSuperBuild all the time to test my plugin.

you can do something like this to bring paraview to the foreground (from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11248284/mac-os-x-bring-non-bundle-gui-applications-to-foreground-when-launched-from-t).

>$ pwd

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Reflect Filter Error
Message-ID: <CA+1xp0+yzDG0jyW7Va73nMDSzkwNEuYo0HVDABp4aU-LCy_NQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

In my research I used paraview to open my 3D image and mesh. but after
visualizing I noticed that original 3D image and 3D binary image has
different coordinates.
Therefore I used to paraview reflect filter to reflect 3D mesh and adjusted
to same coordinates with 3D image. After
using itkTriangleMeshToBinaryImageFilter it gives an exception. That
exception attached with this post. Can you please give me a solution for
this? It would be great help. Thank you.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

 

Hello All,

 

Last week, I was able to open paraview with no issues.  This morning I tried opening paraview from the ubuntu 12.04 LTS terminal and received the following error:

 

Error converting runtime path entry "/usr/local/bin/../lib/paraview-3.98" to real path: No such file or directory

 

Does anyone know what can be done to enable the use of paraview again?

 

Thank you,

 

Kyle Gamble

What version is this? How was the ParaView binary installed?

This has been fixed in 4.0. Can you try the release candidate binaries
from paraview.org and verify that the problem is fixed? thanks

Please check with the maintainer of the ubuntu package, we don't
provide those packages and hence cannot assist in any issues with
those. You can directly download the tar ball from paraview.org and
use it directly from the download location (no need to install).

Burlen,

I am downloading the data to reproduce. How many process should I run
this with to reproduce the issue?

Thanks,

Good afternoon folks,

We?d like to announce the upcoming Android tutorial: App Building with VES
and Kiwi next Thursday, June 13 from 2:00pm-3:00pm.

Hosted by Kitware, this free, one hour webinar will present a tutorial on
Android programming with the VES and Kiwi libraries. You'll learn how to
use CMake and the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) to crosscompile VTK
and VES/Kiwi libraries for Android. The tutorial topics include CMake and
the NDK, designing Java Native Interface (JNI) libraries, and an intro to
the KiwiViewer Android app demonstrating how to package assets, load data,
and render geometry. Free registration is available
here<https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/746177726>.


If there is a webinar topic that you?d like to recommend we cover, please
email Kitware at kitware.com.

Thanks!

To use eclipse as your IDE for ParaView, tell cmake to use the Eclipse
generator when you first configure a new build directory.
'ccmake -G  "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" $PATHTOPVSRC', for example, or
pick the appropriate generator from cmake-gui.

Regarding using, see the paraview wiki book (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents) and
tutorial (http://paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) to learn how to
get your data into ParaView and what you can then do with it.

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so that everyone can
contribute and benefit.

Personally I've not tried eclipse on windows. If cmake-gui doesn't provide
a generator option for it, it might be tricky to set up.

Perhaps someone else on the list will advise.

Subject: [Paraview] Spreadsheet display of Field Data?
Message-ID: <CANmPiKDSN6q8h8shhfQQhYCX-wtttRDaYjk9qrQ_y2Dr9gL-QA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a custom VTK filter that I am using to create a ParaView
filter. I'd like to store some information about the output from the
filter in the output's field data. My filter sets the field data for
this output as follows:

  vtkPolyData *output1 = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(
    outputVector->GetInformationObject(1)->Get(
        vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  // do some stuff

  vtkStdString xColumnString( ... );
  vtkStdString yColumnString( ... );
  vtkStdString zColumnString( ... );

  vtkSmartPointer< vtkStringArray > bestDimensionsArray =
    vtkSmartPointer< vtkStringArray >::New();
  bestDimensionsArray->SetNumberOfValues( 3 );
  bestDimensionsArray->SetValue( 0, xColumnString );
  bestDimensionsArray->SetValue( 1, yColumnString );
  bestDimensionsArray->SetValue( 2, zColumnString );

  vtkSmartPointer< vtkFieldData > fieldData =
    vtkSmartPointer< vtkFieldData >::New();
  fieldData->AddArray( bestDimensionsArray );

  output1->SetFieldData( fieldData );

I was expecting to be able to see the field data in a spreadsheet view
of the data. However, all I see is a single column with three empty
cells.

Thinking it might be a problem specific to vtkStringArray, I tried to
set the field data to have a single vtkDoubleArray. However, I still
get empty cells.

Am I doing something wrong? I looked at the bug tracker but didn't
find any open issues with regards to displaying field data in the
spreadsheet view.

Thanks!
Cory

Ah, never mind. I forgot to set a name for the array.

If I add

bestDimensionsArray->SetName( ... );

the field data array shows up as expected.

It seems like you should still be able to see the array values if the
array doesn't have a name, though.

For better, or for worse, that's an assumption we made in ParaView
from the get go and hence it's not possible to support unnamed arrays
without extensive re-factoring.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkGeometryRepresentation and server-mode
Message-ID: <9B37D8E5-9DE3-441A-9610-3E794E682D2F@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I wonder whether it is possible to controll pipeline-soureces (e.g. PlaneSource) vtkGeometryRepresentation over all processes runing on server-side. In this way I could set the UserTransformation of an Visible object within a view or setting texture data. I was able to do this in client-mode.

Cheers,
Stephan

Subject: [Paraview] Difference in output of GUI and PVbatch for same macro
Message-ID: <CAL_eiiRseVZwv08SfFFcrNoj5SyK75vdN_e=seW3bL6W3X8aDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have put the output, data file, and the xmf file in this directory.

http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~jhapk/gui_vs_pvbatch/

I am trying to plot a slice along with some contours for some data in a
cube. Why is there a difference in both the outputs I get from the PV GUI
and PVbatch? The slice I get using PVbatch is completely dark without any
contours values on it.

I created this macro by using "start trace" and "stop trace" and later
modified it a bit for my convenience. I want to keep the range of maximum
and minimum values for colouring the contours on the slice between 0 to
396.

I am using PV 3.98.

Thanks!!

Message-ID: <0E78ED28-ADBB-4371-AA9E-86B7AFCE9B24@bluequartz.net>

We are writing some data analysis software in which we would like to visualize each step of our analysis. Is it possible to send ParaView a "chunk" of data at certain times during our program that ParaView will then visualize?I I seem to remember something like this but I must have the syntax incorrect as I am coming up empty searching around the wiki?

Thanks

I believe you are talking about co-processing which is now handled by the Catalyst modules. The documentation is not up yet, but it is similar to the co-processing in older versions of ParaView. Andy generated some examples which may help here:

Best of luck,

One possibility is ParaView Catalyst's live viz capability (
http://catalyst.paraview.org/). At this point I would consider it beta
functionality for it's intended purpose but it may be sufficient for what
you're trying to do. I'm attaching a Python script that you can demo it
with. You'll need to change the path to can.ex2 in the script to your local
location (it's available in ParaViewData in case you don't have it yet).
The directions on how to use it are:
1) <path to pv build dir>/bin/pvpython co_processing_3.py
2) run paraview and select Tools->Connect to Catalyst and click OK in the
next 2 pop-up dialogs
3) Select each filter under catalyst and then click on the circle/triangle
thingy to the left of it.
4) This should bring up the same filters under the builtin server. At this
point hopefully one of them will have a grayed out eyeball that you can
make visible to see the "simulation" in the ParaView client.

Now you should be able to make a new pipeline on the client to interrogate
that data. If this doesn't work, try quitting the ParaView client and
repeat. Like I said, it's beta functionality and doesn't include a test so
depending on which version of ParaView you're using you'll get different
results. I'm using master as of today so it's a bit clunky but it may work
really nicely with other versions.

Another possibility is the adios reader plugin. I don't know enough about
that though to give you any more information.

Regards,
Andy

At this point I would consider it beta functionality for it's intended purpose but it may be sufficient for what you're trying to do. I'm attaching a Python script that you can demo it with. You'll need to change the path to can.ex2 in the script to your local location (it's available in ParaViewData in case you don't have it yet). The directions on how to use it are:

Like I said, it's beta functionality and doesn't include a test so depending on which version of ParaView you're using you'll get different results. I'm using master as of today so it's a bit clunky but it may work really nicely with other versions.

Subject: [Paraview] Viewing a slice as a 2D object
Message-ID: <CAL_eiiRHmznhomRU3Cdd6_9o=5RL3isgzybOt1bzOm5tB4giOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

when I extract a slice from a 3D data, how can I look at the slice as a 2D
plane/object? That is to say, how can I do things like probing, finding the
variable value at different points on the slice without giving its 3D
coordinates, because its not convenient to find out the exact 3D
coordinates of points on the slice.

Thank you

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Hello,

 

Is there a way to extract the value of a variable for all nodes on a particular surface and obtain the sum of all these values? I've used the selection to highlight the nodes but it seems to select nodes that are not on the particular surface of interest.  If I do it this way it is time consuming to add up all the values displayed manually.

 

Thank you,

 

Kyle

Subject: [Paraview] vtkGeometryRepresentation and server-mode
Message-ID: <002801ce61f0$b8d44f10$2a7ced30$@tu-cottbus.de>

Ok, after sleeping on it one night I found the solution by myself. For those
who were faced with the same question I'd liked to share my code snipped
that does work for me. It takes all Pipeline Source objects and search for
the right GeometryRepresenation property. If there is an easier way feel
free to correct me. My goal was to find the geometry representation for a
certain pipeline source (named "Plane1"). Since I wasn't able to find a
direct mapping between source and representation proxies, I had to compare
all input proxies of the GeometryRepresentation proxies. Hope this is
useful.

pqServerManagerModel* smmodel =
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel();

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting an irregular surface
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6ZaSmO6mY=r-8+Fk7uqcuvyDuRN+HHBxujvCnAB=3Uaw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question. I have two different csv files, both representing
surfaces of an area.
These two csv files consist of  "X","Y","Z"  values,
after opening these csv files in paraview and applying the following
filters on each,

/CSV File
1.Table to Points
2. Delunay 2D

I  will get a surface for each of them with one being a subset of the
other. The problem is one of these csv files has more points and represents
a bigger area and will end up to the higher resolution surface. These are
range of x,y values for the two csv files:

1.csv File with more points showing a bigger area

X=[-6000,24000]
Y=[-7000,23000]

2.csv File with less points showing smaller area

X=[1152,14336]
Y=[1408,17024]

Is there any way I can extract from the bigger csv file the area related to
the smaller file ?

I know I can extract from the bigger file the limits of the smaller one?
but the area I am interested in has an irregular shape and I don?t want to
be simply exporting a rectangle.

Is there anyway to do this in paraview?

I hope I?m being clear in my explanation.

Thanks
Hedie

Hi

I am using paraview 4 RC:

-       Is there a possibility to import x3d files?
-       I can load vrml files but texture seems to be ignored, is there a possibility to load texture as well?

Thanks in advance

Hello again,

Great.  I now have some time to do more testing and learning.

> If you get issues, let me know.

Okay, so I'm now getting a different error when I run the Catalyst
application/script:
	% ./FEDriver SampleScripts/feslicescript.py
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
	  File "SampleScripts/feslicescript.py", line 87, in DoCoProcessing
	    coprocessor.DoLiveVisualization(datadescription, "localhost", 22222)
	  File 
"/home/avl/VR/Apps/ParaView/ParaView_git20130528/Build/lib/site-packages/paraview/coprocessing.py", 
line 155, in DoLiveVisualization
	    self.__LiveVisualizationLink = servermanager.vtkLiveInsituLink()
	NameError: global name 'servermanager' is not defined

And that is repeated 11 times.


So, the versions I'm using are: the Catalyst examples from master.zip
where the files are all dated 05/29/13 17:59.

And a ParaView git clone that reports:
	% git show HEAD
	commit 723b5455491ef913ed1083f75e34c2820d1f06e8
	Merge: d915ca0 3e6ceec
	Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
	Date:   Fri May 24 10:41:11 2013 -0400

	    Merge topic 'update_version_rc2'

	    3e6ceec Update version to 4.0.0-RC2

So I guess that's a slightly different commit than what you were
testing against -- but I downloaded it 05/28/13, so only one day
difference.

I can try a newer (or different) version of ParaView, but I'm not
sufficiently familiar with git to know how to request a specific
commit code.

Recommendations?

Hi Bill,

My changes went into ParaView on 5/29 (the commit SHA is
617e91e3f318a22a54aca7e82b8ab1a0f5d88820) which is after your version of
ParaView. That should fix your issue. After doing a "git pull" you can do a
"git checkout 617e91e3f318" to get that revision but I would suggest just
using the master version (also make sure to do a git submodule update from
the main source directory).

The Catalyst examples commit SHA which you'll want is
f041507af5f6f010c9f8a2de8b3014ae19a2394b.

There are plans to make the Catalyst examples tested nightly so that things
don't get out of sync causing these headaches. That probably won't get done
before the 4.0 release though.

Regards,
Andy

Hi,

the first thing that comes to mind is the spreadsheet view which lets 
you look at numerical values of the data. You can use it in combination 
with selection to interactively, using the mouse, identify the subset of 
cells/point you are interested in, all without knowing exact coordinates.

Does that help?

ok, I will try that. But is there no way to look at/analyze a slice as a 2D
plane ?

With regards to extracting the values, have you tried the extract selection filter?  Then, try the Integrate Variables filter to do the sum?

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?
Hello,

Is there a way to extract the value of a variable for all nodes on a particular surface and obtain the sum of all these values? I've used the selection to highlight the nodes but it seems to select nodes that are not on the particular surface of interest.  If I do it this way it is time consuming to add up all the values displayed manually.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <345817C8A61EA841AAE0120EC1514D9547E45579@umechphd.easf.csd.disa.mil>

I am using Superbuild to compile 4.0.0-RC2 and for the most part I'm having very good success.  I have a particular HPC system (SGI ICE X) where I'm getting a strange error when configuring paraview itself.

"string sub-command REGEX, mode MATCH needs at least 5 arguments total to command."

Google pointed me here to a hack/fix that got me past the cmake error message.

http://the-unofficial-paraview-developers-forum.34153.x6.nabble.com/Build-error-Windows-td1858.html

Is there possibly a better solution to this problem other than manually editing the ParaViewDetermineVersion.cmake file?   I'm running cmake 2.8.11 and the latest ParaViewSuperbuild source files.

Rick,

Can you try the attached verion of ParaViewDetermineVersion.cmake and
see if that works? If so, I'll have it merged in for the next RC.

That will be good.

Okay, so progress report -- works more, but not all the way.

I tested both with a git master from this morning as well as
with "git checkout 617e91e3f318", and got the same results for
both.

And before I report the output for "CFullExample", I thought I'd try a
couple of the other examples ("CxxFullExample" and "CxxImageDataExample",
and I got a different (non-working) result -- and that is, that it just
returned to the prompt without apparently connecting to ParaView, but
it did produce datafiles for every 10th time step (as well as the "fullgrid"
for the first and last time steps) -- actually, that now happens for all
the examples I've tried.


Okay, so back to what happens with "CFullExample", which now is clearly
connecting to the ParaView Catalyst tool.  After it connects, a popup
appears saying:
                 "Catalyst Disconnected"

                 "Connection to Catalyst Co-Processor has been terminated
                 involuntarily. This implies either a communication 
error, or
                 that the Catalyst co-processor has terminated. The Catalyst
                 session will now be cleaned up. You can start a new one 
if you
                 want to monitor for additional Catalyst connection 
requests."

Now, behind it, in the pipeline browser, I can see that some modules
have been connected to teh catalyst input icon:
                 * PVTrivalProducer1
                 * Slice1

But then I click "OK" on the popup, and everything goes away.

The shell and the "Output Messages" window report this:
                 ERROR: In 
/home/avl/VR/Apps/ParaView/ParaView_git20130605/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, 
line 812
                 vtkSocketCommunicator (0x2b009d0): Could not receive tag. 1

Looks like definite progress, but not quite there.

Hello,

I am receiving the paraview digests but do not know how to post questions.

I would like to overlay "png" files on a sphere simulating the earth.  The data is sampled every tenth of a degree in lat and lon.  I need to make sure it is correctly mapped onto the sphere so that the lat/lon or ecr coordinates line up.

I see that the phi and theta resolutions max out at 1024.

Is there a way to map my data correctly?

Thank you,
Karen Wilk

If using texture mapping, a display property, to show the image, you should not need the make the sphere anywhere near the resolution of the image. The rendering process will interpolate values in between sphere vertices to make the results indistinguishable.

Yes,  I was getting that something like that. Even if I have a 2D slice,
still I am visualizing/analyzing the figure in a 3D format. Is it possible
to just treat it as a 2D object (get rid of all the 3D objects around).
 Even when I snap the camera to the plane's normal, to get the value of a
point on the slice I need to specify (x,y,z). Ideally, I want to probe into
the contour values, use tools like "Probe" and "Ruler" on the slice just by
specifying the coordinates (x,y) and not (x,y,z).

Subject: [Paraview] pause/unpause animation
Message-ID: <UEJ.FRbT.2yIZS17Jkwf.1Hi1s2@seznam.cz>

I use Paraview 4.0.0 RC2. I pause an animation. When I unpause the animation
by clicking on play, the animation starts from the beginning. How can I 
unpause the animation so that it continues from the paused time instead?



Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Highlighting specific nodes as a function of time
Message-ID: <CAL_eiiQYjpP8yWWp2S5eMWXKL_xSkqwVs2=2j6nADU6HW_XdWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a NxNxN (N=512) cube data stored in multiple h5 format files for a
time varying solution. I read it in Paraview using a xmf file. I am able to
make a time varying movie of a particular iso-surface using the xmf file.

For each time step I have a particular node, say (x*, y*, z*), which I want
to highlight (using a sphere, for example). I have all these coordinates
stored in a another file. Can anyone please suggest me, how can I make a
movie where these particular nodes are highlighted along with the
iso-suface movie?

Thank you,
Pradeep

My present xmf file looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf Version="2.0">
  <Domain>
    <Grid Name="Box" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">

      </Attribute>
    </Grid>
  ******many blocks like these************

And the points I want to highlight have coordinates like this:

I think I can state my question much more simply. I have a file with data
like this:

 00000,       241,          54,         310
 00006,       241,          54,         308
 00012,       240,          55,         310
 00018,       239,          55,         310
 00024,      261,         294,         395
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 00030,       256,         373,          32
 00036,       257,         372,          32
 00042,       257,         371,          32
 00048,       258,         370,          32
 00054,      258,         369,           32

The first coloumn is the time stamp and the following three coloums are the
x, y and z coordinates. I want to highlight the points in the file as
function of time in a cube of 512x512x512 such that the only the particular
node has a sphere (for example) and the rest of the domain is empty.

How can I do that?

Rick,

Can you try the attached verion of ParaViewDetermineVersion.cmake and
see if that works? If so, I'll have it merged in for the next RC.

I have some ideas.


1. Apply Transform filter.
   If you set scale factors as [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], then the source is smashed to x-y plane.

2. Apply Calculator filter.
   Checking the 'Coordinate Results' box and set a function you want.
   Then the source's points are translated by the function.

Cool. I have it merged into "next". It'll be included in the next

Subject: [Paraview] SelectCells function
Message-ID: <CAMKonzs6zbFBt5yR+wpsJWnau-pmr+vfCAiK=J06ZpyJaNbF4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. i,m interested in a python script to automatice the selection of
several cellsIds. im trying to use the selectcells function but its seems
to be wrong because its works fine if select all ids, but when i write i.e.
SelectCells(27) its give severals mistakes. Id like to automatice severals
cellsid ranges and its impossible for mi from Find Data, because its only
can select one range in the query selection. I,d like to use selectcells
function in severals loops to select diferents zones in the same mesh.
i.e,  selecting cells like this (22089 to 26700 and 31000 to 31100 and
32650 to 40000) It,s possible?
thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkPVSysnchronizedRenderWindows + Splitted views
Message-ID: <004901ce62be$13fb2ee0$3bf18ca0$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

when I run ParaView and connect to pvserver with activated CAVE mode (with a
full screen render window), split the main active 3D view (horizontal or
vertical) and create a non-3D view (e.g. Spreadsheet), the render window on
the server is also separated into two viewports. The left half is covered by
the 3D-render window the right side seems to be empty. I guess non-3D-views
were not shown in the CAVE which is ok. But why is the render window
separated into two viewports? Is this a desired behavior?

Is it possible to detach new created views from the ParaView
Tab-Widget-Panel to have pure view-windows?

Stephan

Message-ID: <E70FE8EA6EBE9241BDB4CA6D8D12E1D801C23A5411C0@RZJC1EX.jr1.local>

Hi

I programmed my own vtml reader because the original vrml implementation does not load texture. Now I found out that the texture coordinates are extracted correctly, only the vtkTexture object is not generated with the input image. This texture object must be passed to the actual actor, but how do I implement that in the reader wich is a vtkPolyDataAlgorithm?????? There is no access to any actor...

So whats the correct way to make an reader which loads texture onto the surface?

Best regards,
Gerald Lodron

Hi, I use a xdmf to store my research data (I use a home compiled
version of ParaView).

I recently found a bug and I added a bug report on the Paraview BugTracker.
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14021

Is this the best place to report issues about the xdmf library???

Also I will like to add some improvement to the format like
(1DCoRectMesh, and 1DRectMesh).
And some improvement to the reader. I found the reader very slow when I
have a lot of fields (more than 10000).

Felipe

That is not a desirable behavior. This is definitely a bug. Thanks for
point that out.

I don't think this is possible. The best one can do right now is
a full-screen and that's it.

Dear Samuel San,

thank you for the response. But it didn't answer my question. I have a grid
of 512x512x512 which I initiate in the xmf file using the following lines:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions="512 512 512"/>
      <Geometry GeometryType="ORIGIN_DXDYDZ">
        <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">0.0 0.0
0.0</DataItem>
        <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">0.1 0.1
0.1</DataItem>
      </Geometry>
      <Time Value="00006"/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this geometry I want to visualize just ONE coordinate at each time step.
Suppose I want to have a little sphere at (x*,y*,z*) for time = t, how do I
edit the xmf file to do that? How should I input that data?

I hope I explained my question clearly. If not, please let me know.

Concur -- I'd never tried a split window while using the VR plugin.

I asked about that a while ago and I was told that it would only be a basic
change to the parameters to the panels in Qt, so could in theory be done
with a pretty basic code change to ParaView -- but I didn't pursue it
beyond that.

Woops, that is a bug.  I have written up a bug report.  It is number 14120.

Thanks for reporting.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] pause/unpause animation

I use Paraview 4.0.0 RC2. I pause an animation. When I unpause the animation by clicking on play, the animation starts from the beginning. How can I unpause the animation so that it continues from the paused time instead?

Thanks

Hi Bill,

The Catalyst examples were meant more for batch processing examples (i.e.
specified output files at given intervals). I didn't test them with
connecting to Catalyst and all of the Python scripts in there probably have
that functionality disabled. I'm updating some of the stuff to make Live In
Situ work better but those fixes probably won't go into ParaView master
until next week. I'll send you an email for notification when it's fixed.

Okay, sounds good, I'll watch for your email.

In the meantime, what is the process for running them in batch mode?

Ken,

Yes, I'm using the texture mapping.  That's good news--thank you so much!

If using texture mapping, a display property, to show the image, you should not need the make the sphere anywhere near the resolution of the image. The rendering process will interpolate values in between sphere vertices to make the results indistinguishable.

Hello,

I am receiving the paraview digests but do not know how to post questions.

I would like to overlay ?png? files on a sphere simulating the earth.  The data is sampled every tenth of a degree in lat and lon.  I need to make sure it is correctly mapped onto the sphere so that the lat/lon or ecr coordinates line up.

I see that the phi and theta resolutions max out at 1024.

Is there a way to map my data correctly?

Thank you,
Karen Wilk

Yes,  I was getting that something like that. Even if I have a 2D slice, still I am visualizing/analyzing the figure in a 3D format. Is it possible to just treat it as a 2D object (get rid of all the 3D objects around).
 Even when I snap the camera to the plane's normal, to get the value of a point on the slice I need to specify (x,y,z). Ideally, I want to probe into the contour values, use tools like "Probe" and "Ruler" on the slice just by specifying the coordinates (x,y) and not (x,y,z).

Nikhil, no problem :)

Bill, that undocked window would be a nice feature.

Having your attention I guess there is another bug when running in  
CAVE mode: I was not able to use the multi-server and CAVE mode at the  
same time. Connecting one client to a pvserver session works but PV  
crashes immediately after connecting a second PV client to that session.

Best reagrds,
Stephan

Concur -- I'd never tried a split window while using the VR plugin.

I asked about that a while ago and I was told that it would only be a basic
change to the parameters to the panels in Qt, so could in theory be done
with a pretty basic code change to ParaView -- but I didn't pursue it
beyond that.

Hi Bill,

Running in batch mode with Catalyst should essentially be the same as
running the simulation code on its own, besides adding in the Catalyst
output information of course. If you're getting output files, which I
thought you said you were then you're already running in batch mode.

Alternatively if you want to connect many clients to one server then you
are looking at a multi-client configuration. I'm guessing this is what you
are looking to do. This will not work by current design because the PV cave
mode works on the server side .

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Collaboration

To have the current collaboration framework to work with the CAVE mode we
would have to handle cave stuff at the client side instead of the server. I
have been working on something in my spare time to make this possible but
it'll be some time till that is done.

Nikhil,

thanks for clarification. You are right, I meant the multi-client mode. I looking forward for that feature. Thank you very much.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?            

 

Hello,

 

In my model I have small deformations.  I want to be able to magnify the deformation for visualization purposes (i.e. 5, 10 or 100 times greater).  I have used Ansys in the past and know it is possible to magnify the results for clarity of visualization.  Is it possible to do this using Paraview?

Yes. Use the "Scale Factor" property of the Warp filter to 5,10, or 100.

Hello again,

Ok, I have my sphere and my png texture seems to be mapping appropriately.  I now need to create a lat/lon grid--one that will move/zoom with the sphere.  I've looked through the sources and filters and don't see how to do that.  Any suggestions?

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling Paraview errors on Oak Ridge HPC Titan
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514B21F52C@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

I've been working on building ParaView on Oak Ridge HPC Titan (Cray HPC system) for its coprocessing/catalyst libraries to be linked to PHASTA simulation code running on Titan for in-situ coprocessing as well as live monitoring via pvserver which are already built and can run successfully on Oak Ridge visualization cluster Lens. There are some "undefined references" errors while building ParaView on Titan which I already contacted Titan HPC support specialist but we are currently out of ideas on what to try next to fix these compilation errors. So I am hoping to get some ideas from people on this list who might have experienced such issues and might have some fresh ideas to help us move forward.

Specifically, we have to build ParaView on titan with "BUILD_SHARED_LIB" off so it can be statically linked to PHASTA simulation code and run on the Titan compute nodes. I set "apron" as MPIEXEC, set Cray pgi  wrapper compilers CC, cc, ftn as MPI_CXX_COMPILER, MPI_C_COMPILER, and MPI_FORTRAN_COMPILER, set Cray_mpich2/5.6.3 as MPI libraries to link to.  First, I tried to use gnu compilers as CMAKE compilers and was able to configure and then build ParaView, but got the following "undefined references" errors in libmpich.a such as the following when it was about 51% built:


------------------------------------

Linking CXX executable ../../../bin/vtkpython

/opt/cray/mpt/5.6.3/gni/mpich2-pgi/119/lib/libmpich.a(gni_poll.o): In function `MPID_nem_gni_process_async_mhndl_ack':

gni_poll.c:(.text+0x3d): undefined reference to `GNI_SmsgRelease'

gni_poll.c:(.text+0x58): undefined reference to `gni_err_str'
--------------------------------

Then as suggested by HPC support specialist, I changed to use cray pgi wrapper compilers CC, cc, ftn as corresponding CMAKE compilers (rather than use gnu compilers as I initially did), however, I got the following "undefined references" errors when it was about 19% built:


--------------------------------

/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Utilities/KWSys/vtksys/SystemTools.cxx:1768: warning: Using 'getpwnam' in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking

/opt/pgi/12.10.0/linux86-64/12.10/lib/libCmpz.a(eh_util.o): In function `std::uncaught_exception(void)':

eh_util.c:(.text+0x307): undefined reference to `__zceh_uncaught_exception'

/usr/bin/ld: link errors found, deleting executable `../../../bin/vtkHashSource-pv3.98'

child process exit status 1: /sw/xk6/altd/bin/ld

make[2]: *** [bin/vtkHashSource-pv3.98] Error 2

make[1]: *** [VTK/Utilities/HashSource/CMakeFiles/vtkHashSource.dir/all] Error 2

make: *** [all] Error 2

---------------------------------------

Not sure why pgi compiler is trying to use glibc which then leads to the undefined reference error as shown above with libCmpz.a. This problem does not happen if we use gnu compilers for CMake compilers but we got another set of undefined references in libmpich.a as described above.

Anybody has any ideas on what is wrong here and what we should try next to resolve these "undefined references" errors?

Many thanks for any suggestions you can provide!

Can you insert the the cell associated values at the same time or in the
same order that you inserted the cells themselves?
Like so:
  unstructeredgirdP->InsertNextCell(hex->GetCellType(), hex->GetPointIds());
  floatarrayP->InsertNextTuple(uuTmp);

If not, use the fact that InsertNextCell returns a vtkIdType indicating the
new cell's location (or you could just maintain a counter). Store the cell
location's in a map indexed by your elemId for the cell, and use that when
you make the cell associated data array to find the corresponding location
in the cell array.

If you are just looking for a simple ASCII format, you can use one of the basic VTK file formats.  They are easy to read and write, and their documentation is here (as well as in the VTK Users Guide):

Hi all. I want to know what file formats supported by paraview allows to describe deforming 2d geometry.
Thanks in advance.

P.s. In ParaView Tutorial I found .ex2 format but it's a bit complicated and binary. It would be great if proposed file formats won't be binary

You may be missing a gni library? use nm on the .a files to figure out 
if it has the missing symbols. Also with static linking the order you 
list the libraries matters. in your case you'll need to list the gni 
library(ies) before the mpich libarary on the link line. You could check 
if that's your problem by running "make VERBOSE=1" and examining the 
order that's used. You could potentiall force the linker to not care 
about library order by enclosing mpi and it's dependencies in 
--start-group , --end-group linker options...

It's a little more work but in my experience things will go smoother for 
you if you avoid the CC wrappers when building ParaView. also pgi is 
used relatively rarely compared to gcc so you're asking for problems. 
Fine if you're prepared to dig in a deal with them, but if you want it 
just to work, then use gcc.

to avoid cc wrappers one thing you need to do is find mpi and its 
dependencies. if you run "CC --verbose" you can see the link options 
used by CC. You want to extract just the ones you need and no others. 
then since you want static linking you might need determine the order of 
the libraries. to give you some ideas about what you're after, I'll 
attach result of this process from NERSC's Cray XC30 Edison, but watch 
out I used dynamic linking so it's not exactly what you need.

hope this will help

Try using the paraview superbuild to build static lib paraview on titan.

To do that do a git fetch from:
git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git

Then make two build directories.

In the first, set CROSS_BUILD_STAGE to "TOOLS", set CROSS_TARGET to
"xk7_gnu", and build.

In the next, set CROSS_BUILD_STAGE to "CROSS", and point
PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR to the first build directory and build.

If it doesn't work let us know. It has been a couple of months since I
built there, and until I get a nightly dashboard up on titan, I can't
assert that something hasn't broken it.

Note that this the build will use the gnu compiler chain. I haven't tried
any of the other compilers recently on a cray, but I'm sure we can make it
work and then add another CROSS_TARGET for them if your codes require
something else.

As Burlen suggested, with static builds library order can easily be a
sticking point that result in late stage linking errors. As a workaround
you can make VERBOSE=1 to see the link line, and edit it and reenter it to
see if this is the problem. The longer term fix for me was to add the
MPI library set to the HDF5_LIBRARIES set, which makes cmake infer the
proper link order. (see the bgp_xlc target's ParaViewDefaults.cmake to see
that approach).

There are some "undefined references" errors while building ParaView on Titan which I already contacted Titan HPC support specialist but we are currently out of ideas on what to try next to fix these compilation errors. So I am hoping to get some ideas from people on this list who might have experienced such issues and might have some fresh ideas to help us move forward.

Specifically, we have to build ParaView on titan with "BUILD_SHARED_LIB" off so it can be statically linked to PHASTA simulation code and run on the Titan compute nodes. I set "apron" as MPIEXEC, set Cray pgi  wrapper compilers CC, cc, ftn as MPI_CXX_COMPILER, MPI_C_COMPILER, and MPI_FORTRAN_COMPILER, set Cray_mpich2/5.6.3 as MPI libraries to link to.  First, I tried to use gnu compilers as CMAKE compilers and was able to configure and then build ParaView, but got the following "undefined references" errors in libmpich.a such as the following when it was about 51% built:

Then as suggested by HPC support specialist, I changed to use cray pgi wrapper compilers CC, cc, ftn as corresponding CMAKE compilers (rather than use gnu compilers as I initially did), however, I got the following "undefined references" errors when it was about 19% built:

Not sure why pgi compiler is trying to use glibc which then leads to the undefined reference error as shown above with libCmpz.a. This problem does not happen if we use gnu compilers for CMake compilers but we got another set of undefined references in libmpich.a as described above.

Anybody has any ideas on what is wrong here and what we should try next to resolve these "undefined references" errors?

Many thanks for any suggestions you can provide!

Kyle,
I am cleaning up old e-mails, and found this one.

My best (and only) guess is that you have a bad graphics driver on your remote computer.  I suspect ParaView uses OpenGL PolyOffset for surface with edges, and the driver could be giving you issues.  Update it?

Alan

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Triangulation of Mesh

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Hello All,

I am trying to understand why when I use show with surface with edges I am getting bizarre results.  I have used a program called cubit to create an exodus file of my mesh on my local machine with quad8 (quadratic) elements.  To explain the behaviour, I have created a simple case called junk. When I open this exodus file (without results) into Paraview  on my local machine I obtain the mesh shown in the attached image JunkParaviewLocal.jpg.

Now, I run my simulations remotely to another computer used by someone else because it is faster than the computer I currently use locally.  This is done through linux and ssh. If I secure copy the same exodus file to the remote machine and open it in Paraview on the remote machine I obtain the mesh shown in ParaviewJunkRemote.jpg, which is obviously the incorrect representation of the mesh.  I've run the simulation assuming the triangulation was just a graphics issue but the results were based upon the triangular mesh which is incorrect.

Why does paraview triangulize the mesh when running remotely?  I ask this because if I run the simulation using the mesh from this exodus file, I obtain results based on the triangular mesh rather than the quadrilateral mesh I designed, and this leads to incorrect results.

I thought it may be an issue with the copying of the file so I went to the remote machine with the exodus file on a usb key and copied the file to the hard drive.  I tried opening the file locally on the remote machine and when I click surface with edges, Paraview immediately exits with a seg fault.

Why would paraview exit with a seg fault when clicking surface with edges, when the exodus file opens fine on my local machine?  In addition other exodus files open perfectly fine in Paraview on the remote machine indicating to me there is nothing wrong with the installation of Paraview either.

Again this seems like unusual behaviour and I need to be able to run my simulations on the remote computer on the correct mesh.  I do not experience this behaviour using first order quad4 elements.

If anyone has any ideas on why this behaviour is observed and how to correct it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Kyle Gamble

Okay, yes I am getting the output files, so I suppose that may mean
that the other two examples that I tested are working as they ought.

I was thinking that since a pipeline only shows up for the "CFullExample"
that that was the one closest to working.  I guess there's a bit more
that I have to learn.

I have a couple questions about the Python shell in the ParaView GUI client:

1) Will we be able to paste text from the OS clipboard into the shell
such that it will be treated as input?  (Currently pasted text gets
ignored.)

2) Is there a way to have an ongoing loop that doesn't totally disable
the client GUI?  My goal is to have a script that watches for a change
in the data file and then will cause the pipeline to update, but if I
use the "pyinotify" package, the "loop" method goes into an enduring
loop, and so the Python shell doesn't relinquish control back to the
GUI, effectively freezing the ParaView client.  In fact I don't even
know how to send an interrupt to the Python in the shell.

As a quick test, an infinite while loop has the save effect:
	-> Tools -> Python Shell

         >>> count = 0
         >>> while 1:
         ...   count = count + 1
         ...   print count
         ...
         1
         2
         [...]

(frozen GUI).

	Thank you!
	Bill

Subject: [Paraview] Size of 3D view windows [was regarding camera undo]

ParaViewies, Utkarsh,

After the conversation about the camera undo buttons and your
mentioning that there are now a lot more buttons on the 3D view
windows (which there are), I now find that these buttons seem
to constrain the allowable size of the view windows such that
they have to be wide enough to accommodate all those buttons.

I figured this must be a Qt requirement, but then the other night
I happened to be using a machine with an older ParaView build (3.12),
and while that doesn't have as many buttons on the 3D view windows,
even those that it does have will shrink when making the 3D window
narrower and narrower.  So if that feature could be returned, that
would be handy (and if it's possible to do this on a button by
button basis it might be good to keep the "x" button full sized).

	Thanks,
	Bill

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch is not working with newer osmesa releases
Message-ID: <51B2904A.1030001@gmail.com>

Hi All,

pvbatch is not working with os mesa. however there's no issue when 
running pvserver in cs mode with same os mesa. so same operations 
initiated from a pvbatch script and from the gui in cs mode produce 
quite different results. Similarly, valgrind spews pages of unitialzed 
value errors (originating from mesa threads) when using pvbatch but not 
pvserver.

I'm using mesa from git, the issue was not present in mesa 
7.10.1....it's still very curious that things run fine using pvserver in 
cs mode and not in pvbatch... Any idea what's going wrong here? What 
does pvbatch do differently than pvserver that could account for the issue?

I'm attaching a python script and the images it produced with pvserver 
in cs mode and pvbatch.

You could also find this on the dashboards that use pvbatch and recent mesa

Hi.
There used to be a an option to set subdivison for higher order elements
(up to 4) under the Display panel (under style).

In paraview 4.0.0 it seems to have disappeared. Is there any way to access
it?

Subject: [Paraview] Can Paraview track distance travelled by a data in a
	movie?
Message-ID: <CAL_eiiSS8WnUJ44iWG1u1aEVSgyF1u2KMiXRg1M-iw0j28n=uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am wondering if Paraview is capable of doing something like I state
below.

I have vorticity data over a time sequence which gives me a movie as in the
avi file in this location: http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~jhapk/vorticity/

Is it somehow possible that if I specify any threshold value, say T, then
Paraview can calculate the number of different vorticities greater than or
equal to T that exist in this domain? I mean, any number of immediate
neighbors all with values higher than T will form "one" vorticity.

Also, is it possible that I can calculate the distance travelled by each
vorticity value higher than T over the sequence of the movie. If anyone can
suggest me a smarter way of doing these, it will save me few days of coding
time.

Thank you

Hi all,

I am trying to save Animation using Paraview GUI. is there any way to set
Paraview  to zoom in one by some factor after a specific time ?

Once I click the writeAnimation button, I can?t do anything else till the
write is totally finished.

I would really appreciate if somebody could guide me,If there is anyway to
do this, with gui or without gui and with use of python scripts in pvbatch.

Thanks in Advance

Hi Bill,

1) I submitted a patch to ParaView that makes copy and paste work.  I think
the patch didn't make it into ParaView 4.0 release candidate, but hopefully
it can be available soon.  The commit is in the PythonQt-pv4.0 branch that
I mentioned to you in another email.  It is:

https://github.com/patmarion/ParaView/commit/4a092e2d9f492ebb77a864d3080823c0b431754f

2) All the Python code in the python shell has to run on the main thread,
so if you have a loop that does not return, it will block the gui.  My
suggestion, if you are using PythonQt, is to use a QTimer to look for
changes to the data file.  Here's a QTimer example using PythonQt which
will not block the gui:


from PythonQt import QtCore, QtGui

def myCallback():
    print 'checking data file...'

timer = QtCore.QTimer()
timer.connect('timeout()', onPlayTimer)
timer.setTimeout(100) # start timer with 100 msec timeout

Subject: [Paraview] FPS drop in stereo mode
Message-ID: <008801ce65e9$709a9f90$51cfdeb0$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I observed an unexpected frame rate drop when using one of PV's supported
stereo modes within an empty scene.

Considering 
* OS: Windows
* V-Sync: On
* Application to display FPS (e.g. www.fraps.com)
* Latest ParaView from git-master 

Following steps should emphasizes the frame rate drop:
1. Open ParaView without any stereo mode
2. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 60 FPS)
3. Close ParaView
4. Open ParaView with "--stereo" flag enabled
5. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 22 FPS)

Obviously, stereo rendering should take twice the time of a monocular
rendering. But this should only occurs in more complex scenes. Can anyone
reproduce this behavior? Is this a BUG?

Best regards,
Stephan

some more info

* running the script using pvpython and a separate invocation of 
pvserver works correctly with any number of mpi ranks
* running pvbatch with 1 mpi rank produces visually correct result (but 
valgrind still reports over 1000 errors)
* I compared the ldd output from pvserver and pvbatch they're line for 
line identical (was thinking that maybe this could be a factory issue)

I simplified the test script further and added the code to connect to 
pvserver with pvpython. attached.

over the weekend I updated the hopper.nersc.gov dashboard to build 
against ver 9.2.0 mesa from git, and most of the failures are because of 
this issue.

(Apologies for multiple receptions)

              THIRD WORKSHOP ON DATA-FLOW EXECUTION MODELS
                  FOR EXTREME SCALE COMPUTING (DFM 2013)
              to be held in conjunction with PACT 2013

              September 8, 2013, Edinburgh, Scotland
              http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/dfmworkshop/

The First International workshop on "Data-Flow Models (DFM) for extreme 
scale computing" was held in Galveston Island, Texas in October 2011 in 
conjunction with PACT 2011. DFM 2012 was held in conjunction with PACT 
2012 in Minneapolis, Minnesota in September 2012.

The purpose of DFM continues being to bring together those researchers 
interested in novel computational models based on Data-Flow principles 
of execution. The switch to multi-core systems has raised concurrency to 
the level of a major issue if we are to use the increasing number of 
cores in a chip.

In the past five decades, sequential computing dominated the computer 
architecture landscape because designers were successful at building 
faster and faster computers by solely relying on improvements on 
fabrication technologies and architectural/organization optimizations. 
The most severe limitation of the sequential model, namely its inability 
to tolerate long memory latencies has slowed down the performance gains. 
This phenomenon is the ubiquitous Memory Wall. While various mechanisms 
have been implemented to overcome the wall (such as extremely efficient 
hardware prefetch support for example), they only add to another wall 
that hampers highly efficient execution of programs and modern chip 
design: the Power Wall. Power considerations and heat dissipation issues 
have forced manufacturers to switch to multiple cores per chip and thus 
move into the concurrency era.

New concurrent models/paradigms are needed in order to fully utilize the 
potential of Multi-core chips. The Data-flow model is a formal model 
that can handle concurrency and tolerate memory and synchronization 
latencies. Data-Flow inspired systems could also be simpler and more 
power efficient than conventional systems. Recent work has shown that 
the Data-Flow principles can be used to develop systems that can 
outperform systems based on conventional techniques. Thus, it is time to 
revisit Data-driven computation and bring it to the Multi-core and 
extreme scale computing.

DFM 2013 solicits novel papers that include but are not limited to:
- Novel Data-Flow inspired Execution models and architectures
- Functional and Single assignment based Languages.
- Strict and non-strict execution models.
- Compilers and tools for Data-Flow/Data-Driven systems.
- Hybrid Data-driven/Control-driven systems.
- Position Papers on the Future of Data-Flow in the Multi-core era and 
beyond.

All accepted papers will appear in the Computer Society Digital Library. 
Extended versions of the best papers will be published in a special 
issue of IJPP (International Journal on Parallel Programming).

How can I make a XY plot of the scalar variable passing through a line or
by limiting the indices of the variables (i.e. i=1-NX, j=3, k=4) ? Is there
a command similar to slice but for a line?

Thank you,

Subject: [Paraview] Import Camera positions
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C5A+GNNjd7v_YD1ALgZicNYpxuvF8W7R8ruWRpsDsr8ZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all ,

I am trying to save an animation. In my animation I am giving a path for
camera positions by adding Camera/Follow Path in the Animation View and
then adding coordinates in the Camera Positions.

I wonder if there is anyway to import all coordinates for camera positions
as a file.

If i click the camera button on the 3D window and try to save the
configurations, it will just save one coordinate for the camera position
and it doen?t save the path of all the coordinates I have added.

Is there anyway to import camera positions from a file ?

It is really time consuming entering all the values by hand.

I?d appreciate any help.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CDDC9AB8.1786A%reuterma@ornl.gov>

Hi,

    Sorry for the stupid question, but I'm trying to figure out if the new SliceView  and QuadView are available for use from pvpython. This link: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Slice_View nicely shows the syntax for control, but it implies an active view, so you need to be within ParaView. Am I just missing the documentation on how to create a specific render view from pvpython?

Thanks,

Is QtWebKit required to Build ParaView 4.0.0-RC2? I am getting the following error on VS 2012 trying to build a 64 bit ParaView:

My own build of Qt does not have QtWebKit.

You can turn off WebKit dependency by setting CMake variable
PQWIDGETS_DISABLE_QTWEBKIT to ON.

CMake has a pending fix to the current slow configure/generate time on
master. This was a performance regression that occurred during
development and won't be in CMake 2.8.12.

Subject: [Paraview] ExtractSelection() and SelectionQuerySource() in Python
	shell
Message-ID: <CAFgey_89ULq6xWjSU5hfbDUOXh=Rp08VjjmVSmY5oTJwveaVAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm running Paraview 4.0 RC 2 and trying to make a selection from Python
shell. First I used the Find Data dialog with Python trace to get on track
and then do it all from the shell.

I have a Legacy VTK source with 2Tuple point data, and would like to
extract a selection based on the point data magnitude (Surface_pressure).
The following commands are given in the shell:

ex = ExtractSelection()

sqs = SelectionQuerySource( ProcessID=-1,
QueryString='mag(Surface_pressure) >= 100', HierarchicalIndex=-1,
FieldType='POINT', HierarchicalLevel=-1)
ex.Selection = sqs
Show()

but I get the following runtime exception

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<console>", line 1, in <module>

File
"/usr/local/ParaView-4.0.0-RC2-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/simple.py",
line 300, in Show

raise RuntimeError, "Could not create a representation object for proxy %s"
% proxy.GetXMLLabel()

RuntimeError: Could not create a representation object for proxy
SelectionQuerySource

The Python trace does not help as it does not show any proxy handling. Is
this a proxy issue or something else? Thanks.

Got this working by setting input explicitly. Though I'm not quite
following the magic Render() does with the proxies... This script runs fine
in Python shell

from paraview.simple import *

inp = GetActiveSource()
ex = ExtractSelection()
sqs = SelectionQuerySource(FieldType="POINT", QueryString =
"mag(Surface_pressure) >= 100")
ex.Selection = sqs
ex.Input = inp
Render()
Show(ex)
Render()

I'm trying to pass some MPI-related flags through the Superbuild cmake.  These flags need to get passed down to the actual Paraview source cmake, but they don't seem to getting included.   If I run ccmake I can see that the flags have not been set - and if I manually add the flags at that time, the build proceeds.

(I'm talking about the MPI_xx) flags being passed via the cmake command line)   I'm using cmake 2.8.11

We need to provide cleaner API than using _create_view(). Can you put that
on the bug tracker (or your todo list ;) ) please :)?

Thanks

Rick,

Can you try using -D arguments with the correct syntax and see if that
works?

cmake documentation states the following:

      -D <var>:<type>=<value>     = Create a cmake cache entry.

Ensure that you pass each of the -D arguments correctly with ":type"
suffix. You can identify the type for the variables by running ccmake once
and then looking at the generated CMakeCache.txt. Also, try quoting the
arguments with spaces in them, namely MPI_*_LIBRARIES variables.

Thanks for the pointer.   I changed my Superbuild cmake command to pass these arguments which I believe now include the correct tags

-DUSE_SYSTEM_mpi=ON \
-DMPI_CXX:FILEPATH=`which mpicxx` \
-DMPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=${CPATH} \
-DMPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING="-lmpi -lmpi++ -L${LIBRARY_PATH}" \
-DMPI_C:FILEPATH=`which mpicc` \
-DMPI_C_LIBRARIES:STRING="-lmpi -lmpi++ -L${LIBRARY_PATH}" \
-DMPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=${CPATH} \
-DMPI_Fortran:FILEPATH=`which mpif90` \
-DMPI_Fortran_LIBRARIES:STRING="-lmpi -lmpi++ -L${LIBRARY_PATH}" \
-DMPI_Fortran_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=${CPATH} \

In the Build directory, the  CMakeCache.txt file has the correct values:

MPI_C:FILEPATH=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/bin/mpicc
MPI_CXX:FILEPATH=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/bin/mpicxx
MPI_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/bin/mpicxx
MPI_CXX_COMPILE_FLAGS:STRING=
MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/include:/usr/include
MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING=-lmpi -lmpi++ -L/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/lib
MPI_CXX_LINK_FLAGS:STRING=
MPI_C_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/bin/mpicc
MPI_C_COMPILE_FLAGS:STRING=
MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/include:/usr/include
MPI_C_LIBRARIES:STRING=-lmpi -lmpi++ -L/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/lib
MPI_C_LINK_FLAGS:STRING=
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:STRING=MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
MPI_Fortran:FILEPATH=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/bin/mpif90
MPI_Fortran_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/include:/usr/include
MPI_Fortran_LIBRARIES:STRING=-lmpi -lmpi++ -L/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/lib
MPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=-lmpi -lmpi++ -L/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/lib

However, the in the Build/paraview/src/paraview-build directory, the CMakeCache.txt file does not have the correct values:

MPI_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/opt/sgi/mpt/mpt-2.07/bin/mpicxx

Aashish,

it doesn't matter which stereo type is activated. I've got only 20 FPS...
This is tested on GeForce GTX 580. The ParaView version is pulled from
latest git-master.

Surprisingly, this problem does not occurs on my Render-PC of our
CAVE-system. There I have 2 K5000 NV Quadro cards. But the code base is
older (PV RC1), though I have to check it, with an updated code base and
see, whether this fps drop remains.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hello,

I observed an unexpected frame rate drop when using one of PV's supported
stereo modes within an empty scene.

Considering
* OS: Windows
* V-Sync: On
* Application to display FPS (e.g. www.fraps.com)
* Latest ParaView from git-master

Following steps should emphasizes the frame rate drop:
1. Open ParaView without any stereo mode
2. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 60 FPS)
3. Close ParaView
4. Open ParaView with "--stereo" flag enabled
5. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 22 FPS)

Obviously, stereo rendering should take twice the time of a monocular
rendering. But this should only occurs in more complex scenes. Can anyone
reproduce this behavior? Is this a BUG?

Best regards,
Stephan

Hi Stephan,

GeForce GTX 580 are not great for stereo rendering as I believe they don't
support Quad buffered stereo  (
http://3dvision-blog.com/3840-nvidia-with-a-new-high-end-gpu-namely-the-geforce-gtx-580/
).
In that case, I believe VTK will perform software stereo implementation and
that's why your performance will go down quite a bit.

I don't have the latest card but normally the consumer level card don't
support stereo that well (although this might not be the case with recent
NVIDIA cards).

Let us know if you find this performance degradation on your Quadro cards
as well with latest paraview.

Thanks,

Hi Richard,

the solution seems to be elsewhere...

The variables that get propagated to ParaView don't have necessarily the
same names. (I've listed the ones that are not using the same name)

    -DMPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING=${PV_MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES}
    -DMPI_C_LIBRARIES:STRING=${PV_MPI_C_LIBRARIES}
    -DMPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:STRING=${PV_MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY}
    -DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${PV_MPI_LIBRARY}

Therefore you may need to duplicate some values and use PV_XXX as key.

Not sure that's intended, but I tried to set
 -DPV_MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING="a b c d"
and it properly get pushed to the ParaView CMakeCache.txt.

Seb

Seb,

We should track down why they don't have the same name. I'd think they should.

Curiously, if I rerun cmake in the Build/paraview/paraview-build directory using these same exact flags,  cmake seems to complete correctly as does the build.

Hi Richard,

the solution seems to be elsewhere...

The variables that get propagated to ParaView don't have necessarily the same names. (I've listed the ones that are not using the same name)

    -DMPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING=${PV_MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES}
    -DMPI_C_LIBRARIES:STRING=${PV_MPI_C_LIBRARIES}
    -DMPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:STRING=${PV_MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY}
    -DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${PV_MPI_LIBRARY}

Therefore you may need to duplicate some values and use PV_XXX as key.

Not sure that's intended, but I tried to set  -DPV_MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING="a b c d"
and it properly get pushed to the ParaView CMakeCache.txt.

Seb

Shouldn't there be PV_ variables defined in the CMakeCache.txt file in the paraview directory?

$ grep PV_ CMakeCache.txt
PV_TEST_CLEAN_COMMAND:STRING=
PV_TEST_CLIENT:STRING=localhost
PV_TEST_INIT_COMMAND:STRING=
PV_TEST_USE_RANDOM_PORTS:BOOL=ON
//ADVANCED property for variable: PV_TEST_CLEAN_COMMAND
PV_TEST_CLEAN_COMMAND-ADVANCED:INTERNAL=1
//ADVANCED property for variable: PV_TEST_CLIENT
PV_TEST_CLIENT-ADVANCED:INTERNAL=1
//ADVANCED property for variable: PV_TEST_INIT_COMMAND
PV_TEST_INIT_COMMAND-ADVANCED:INTERNAL=1
//ADVANCED property for variable: PV_TEST_USE_RANDOM_PORTS
PV_TEST_USE_RANDOM_PORTS-ADVANCED:INTERNAL=1

Seb,

We should track down why they don't have the same name. I'd think they should.

They wont. If you look at mpi.use.system.cmake in PAraViewSuperbuild,
it pass the PV variables as MPI_* variables. I'd say the bug is that
the file uses PV_MPI_* variables at all. They should all just be
MPI_*.

Subject: [Paraview] How to simply "Reload" a data file
Message-ID: <CAEqXkzcM7uHXV0Q9grSYqYTiKR4wwHyyXqTsYDQ7LdNb6xHtgA@mail.gmail.com>

Is there button where I can simply reload a data file that was read in
a pipeline?

We have a workflow where we process data into a file and view it in
ParaView. it is becoming tedious to blow away the entire pipeline just
to reload the new data.

 I know about state files but this still requires the user to go to
the File->Load State... " menu and then select a state file. I would
like to just select the data file in the Pipeline browser (XDMF File
reader for us), and just click some button that just reloads data from
the file.

Or am I just missing something? I am using ParaView 3.98.1. I have to
admit I have not tried any of the 4.0.RC* downloads.

Thanks

I would love to know how to do this if it is possible. For one of our
workflows, a periodic checking if an input file has changed and
reloading it at a specified time interval would be even better.

Aashish,

the quad buffer explenation does make sense. But after some more testing
with the "old" PV version (ParaView_4.0-RC1-51-g2965c8) on a machine with
*  a NVidia Quadro 5000 and 
* a machine with 2 NVidia Quadro K5000 (SLI),
I observed a FPS drop in all stereo modes except "Crystal Eyes" which is
hard to measure with fraps. The FPS overly is not visible in that stereo
mode. 

When I use "SplitViewportHorizontal" as stereo mode on my Kepler GPUs I can
see a FPS drop. Interestingly the rate depends on the ParaView's window
size. The smaller the window is the higher the rate and vice versa. I guess
that a post process, which copies pixel between buffers, need some more time
for execution. Is it possible?

Regards,
Stephan

Hi Stephan,?

GeForce GTX 580 are not great for stereo rendering as I believe they don't
support Quad buffered stereo
?(http://3dvision-blog.com/3840-nvidia-with-a-new-high-end-gpu-namely-the-ge
force-gtx-580/).?
In that case, I believe VTK will perform software stereo implementation and
that's why your performance will go down quite a bit.?

I don't have the latest card but normally the consumer level card don't
support stereo that well (although this might not be the case with recent
NVIDIA cards).?

Let us know if you find this performance degradation on your Quadro cards as
well with latest paraview.?

Thanks,

Aashish,

it doesn't matter which stereo type is activated. I've got only 20 FPS...
This is tested on GeForce GTX 580. The ParaView version is pulled from
latest git-master.

Surprisingly, this problem does not occurs on my Render-PC of our
CAVE-system. There I have 2 K5000 NV Quadro cards. But the code base is
older (PV RC1), though I have to check it, with an updated code base and
see, whether this fps drop remains.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hi?Stephan,?

What particular stereo type you chose for this comparison? Also what
graphics hardware you have??

Thanks,

Hello,

I observed an unexpected frame rate drop when using one of PV's supported
stereo modes within an empty scene.

Considering
* OS: Windows
* V-Sync: On
* Application to display FPS (e.g. www.fraps.com)
* Latest ParaView from git-master

Following steps should emphasizes the frame rate drop:
1. Open ParaView without any stereo mode
2. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 60 FPS)
3. Close ParaView
4. Open ParaView with "--stereo" flag enabled
5. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 22 FPS)

Obviously, stereo rendering should take twice the time of a monocular
rendering. But this should only occurs in more complex scenes. Can anyone
reproduce this behavior? Is this a BUG?

Best regards,
Stephan

There is a way if you are willing to create your own Plugin for the reader
that you are using.

The XML should look like that

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
<ProxyGroup name="sources">
<SourceProxy name="ReaderWithButton" base_proxygroup="sources"
base_proxyname="LegacyVTKFileReader">
      <Property name="Refresh" command="Modified"
panel_widget="command_button"/>
      <Hints>
        <ReaderFactory extensions="vtr" file_description="Refresh (Legacy
VTK files)" />
      </Hints>
    </SourceProxy>
</ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

Unfortunately the hints/ReaderFactory didn't properly worked which prevent
its usage from a simple XML file, but if you register it as a real plugin
with the XML-GUI one, you should be fine with the OpenFile dialog.

The remaining thing for you would be to figure out the proxyname of the
reader that you are willing to extend.

If you don't mind using python to create the reader, then you can do
something like that in the python shell.

> r = ReaderWithButton(FileNames='/.../ParaViewData/Data/cone.vtr')
> Show()
> Render()

If either of you are using hdf5 (xdmf for example) you could try our dsm reader. Paraview creates a memory buffer which is used instead of the filesystem by your client application which generates data and writes it to hdf5, it is routed to the dsm inside paraview which updates automatically when the writer closes the file.

I've cleaned it up a it and got it mostly working with paraview 4.0 and will make a 'release' soon. The main problem is that when the app writing data, or paraview shut down, it isn't very clean disconnecting unless they happen in the right order. If one shuts down unexpectedly, or is closed without isconnecting, problems can arise. Apart from that it is quite stable.

I'll post a video and a link soon.

An alternative is to just add a reload button which calls modified and make the filename widget visible - I've just seen a post from Sebastien that does it for you whilst I was typing.

You can save the code as a macro, so you will have a button.

I was hoping that ParaView just had something built in. I would rather not have to create a plugin and distribute that along side my own software and to keep up on builds for all the various OS's and all of that. i tried that for a while and I just could not keep up.

So either I am the only person who has asked for this or there is some over riding reason in the design of ParView why this type of functionality is not in ParaView.

Thanks

As you said earlier, the FPS will drop but not as hard as you have seen on
GTX cards. How does the FPS drop on 5000 compares with the FPS drop on GTX?

Yes, that mode  performs the copy between buffers to produce the final
image.

I forgot to state the obvious, the plugin is a XML one... No code
involved...

In fact, just having the XML that I wrote in a file extend the UI with a
button to refresh the reader should be enough.
Need to figure out why the reader factory did not catch up the hint.

That should be the only thing that you would need.

Another approach could be a python macro that invalidate the
"active/selected' proxy in the pipeline, but that one will require the
usage of ParaView in built-in mode.

If interested I can try to write the corresponding python code...

BTW that's the correct XML for you, just need to create a file with that in
and load it as a plugin and you will have your "Refresh" button.

<ParaViewPlugin>
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
<SourceProxy name="XDMFRrefresh" base_proxygroup="sources"
base_proxyname="XdmfReader" class="vtkXdmfReader">
      <Property name="Refresh" command="Modified"
panel_widget="command_button"/>
      <Hints>
        <ReaderFactory extensions="xmf xdmf" file_description="Xdmf Reader
(Refresh button)" />
      </Hints>
    </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
  </ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ParaViewReaders>
    <Reader name="ReaderWithButton" />
  </ParaViewReaders>
</ParaViewPlugin>

For what it's worth, I just experimented with adding the line

<Property name="Refresh" command="Modified" panel_widget="command_button"/>

to the CSV reader and XDMF reader in

ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/readers.xml

The Refresh button appears among the other property widgets and it
indeed reloads the data set.

I would happily add this to all the readers and submit a patch to
gerrit if it would be received well by the core ParaView developers.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Nikos,


I have two ideas:

1) Extract Subset, and Plot Data (Only when you have Uniform Rectilinear Grids with Cell Data)
2) Plot Over Line

Hi all,


I'm trying to modify nodes' or cells' values of transient sources
with Programmable Filter.
I'd like to multiply these values and the animation time values,
but I don't know how to get the time values.


How can I get it from Programmable Filter?

It's still there. You need to turn the advanced view on. A small gear on
the upper right of the panel.

Subject: [Paraview] Specifying the data set name when loading image file or
 applying filter
Message-ID: <51be4aa8.4f00e00a.2fcc.413f@mx.google.com>

I have had several cases in my vis class, and when working with 
biologists that have large 3D image data sets, where I wanted to load 
in a couple of data sets (or the same data set twice, perhaps at 
different blur levels) and then subtract or otherwise merge the data 
sets (perhaps 3 vector components, one from each file, perhaps to do 
difference-of-Gaussian filtering).

The issue is that there are a bunch of data sets, all with the same 
name ("scalars" for example), so I can't select each one separately 
to combine them.

I can do this by using the Calculator filter on each to produce a new 
data set for each and then using the Append Attributes filter to pull 
them all together.  The calculator step has a couple of unfortunate 
features: (1) it takes a while to run these filters, and (2) it takes 
a lot more memory to do things this way.

Is there any way to tell the input filter what name you'd like to 
have it give to the data set?  It tells you that it will be 
"scalars", but you cannot edit that field to make it something else 
-- all you can do is turn it on or off.  It would save several steps 
and a lot of time and memory if we could name the field something 
useful as it came in the first time.

Thanks,
Russ

p.s. We've pulled a lot of ITK filters together with the BioFormats 
readers into a 3D microscopy tool based on ParaView, called 
ImageSurfer, and this is where I'm currently trying to do 
this.  Thank you so much for making this code available to the 
community to extend!

Aashish,

I've made another test on my render node [1] and my desktop PC. The FPS-drop
depends on the size of the render viewport. To showcase the drop I ran
ParaView in the "SplitViewportHorizontal" mode and play a looped animation
with an empty scene. Then I measured the FPS with three different viewport
sizes:

Resolution => FPS on render node [1]
1617 x 906 => 33 FPS (PV window maximized)
1617 x 702 => 45 FPS
1617 x 438 => 60 FPS

Resolution => FPS on desktop PC [2]
1617 x 906 => 20 FPS (PV window maximized)
1617 x 707 => 26 FPS
1617 x 292 => 60 FPS

Conclusion: The Quadro performs better within that stereo mode, but has also
a drop of ca. 50 % when the PV window is maximized.

[1] Render node:

Aashish,

the quad buffer explenation does make sense. But after some more testing
with the "old" PV version (ParaView_4.0-RC1-51-g2965c8) on a machine with
* ?a NVidia Quadro 5000 and
* a machine with 2 NVidia Quadro K5000 (SLI),
I observed a FPS drop in all stereo modes except "Crystal Eyes" which is
hard to measure with fraps. The FPS overly is not visible in that stereo
mode.

As you said earlier, the FPS will drop but not as hard as you have seen on
GTX cards. How does the FPS drop on 5000 compares with the FPS drop on GTX?

When I use "SplitViewportHorizontal" as stereo mode on my Kepler GPUs I can
see a FPS drop. Interestingly the rate depends on the ParaView's window
size. The smaller the window is the higher the rate and vice versa. I guess
that a post process, which copies pixel between buffers, need some more time
for execution. Is it possible?

Yes, that mode ?performs the copy between buffers to produce the final
image.?

Stephan

Hi Stephan,?
GeForce GTX 580 are not great for stereo rendering as I believe they don't
support Quad buffered stereo
?(http://3dvision-blog.com/3840-nvidia-with-a-new-high-end-gpu-namely-the-ge
force-gtx-580/).?
In that case, I believe VTK will perform software stereo implementation and
that's why your performance will go down quite a bit.?

I don't have the latest card but normally the consumer level card don't
support stereo that well (although this might not be the case with recent
NVIDIA cards).?

Let us know if you find this performance degradation on your Quadro cards as
well with latest paraview.?

Thanks,

it doesn't matter which stereo type is activated. I've got only 20 FPS...
This is tested on GeForce GTX 580. The ParaView version is pulled from
latest git-master.

Surprisingly, this problem does not occurs on my Render-PC of our
CAVE-system. There I have 2 K5000 NV Quadro cards. But the code base is
older (PV RC1), though I have to check it, with an updated code base and
see, whether this fps drop remains.

Hi?Stephan,?

What particular stereo type you chose for this comparison? Also what
graphics hardware you have??

Thanks,

Hello,

I observed an unexpected frame rate drop when using one of PV's supported
stereo modes within an empty scene.

Considering
* OS: Windows
* V-Sync: On
* Application to display FPS (e.g. www.fraps.com)
* Latest ParaView from git-master

Following steps should emphasizes the frame rate drop:
1. Open ParaView without any stereo mode
2. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 60 FPS)
3. Close ParaView
4. Open ParaView with "--stereo" flag enabled
5. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 22 FPS)

Obviously, stereo rendering should take twice the time of a monocular
rendering. But this should only occurs in more complex scenes. Can anyone
reproduce this behavior? Is this a BUG?

Best regards,
Stephan

Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD2145099086BC897@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

I don't use python much so haven't really explored the paraview+python capabilities, however my tests the other day tell me that

The python interface within paraview is very nice and you can create visualizations entirely from script with nice GUI interface thrown in.

If you run a raw python shell and import paraview, the renderviews are not interactive, so although you can setup reasonably decent visualizations, you can't 'play' with them.

Is there a way of having a pure python interface (i.e. no paraview gui), but still keep some of the interactive features that the paraview gui gives you (i.e. an event loop for interaction and some other basic functionality)

...Is it possible to go further and create a mini paraview entirely in python? (I'm not sure what I'm asking for here, but I am curious as to what you can do).

Thanks

JB

I am trying to build the ParaView 4.0 sources from the download website on Windows 7 x64 with Visual Studio 2012 express as a 64 bit executable. I have a self built Qt 4.8.4 with OUT QtWebkit. I set the appropriate CMake variables for the missing QtWeb kit, configured and started to build. I am getting errors of the type:

And lots more of those for various files. Is this a known issue with VS2012 or my own Qt or something else?

Hi Mike,

I'm not sure if it's the correct fix but the attached patch should
allow it to compile.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.0.1 is available for download
Message-ID: <CADHSJjCL0g3TF4HdX3+e7mkG9Y4KyTfii2-SYt+rfZeGxExFMg@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

ParaView 4.0.1 is now available for download
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php). For those looking to
checkout the source
from  the git repository, the tag name is "v4.0.1" (or simply use the
"release" branch).
This release marks the first change in the major version number since 2007.
Unlike the change
from 2 to 3, however, this release is not a major departure from the 3
series, but marks a
milestone in the gradual progression of ParaView UI and framework since
2007.
These notes highlight some of the major enhacements in this version that
addresses over 100 issues since the most recent release
(http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php). ParaView 4.0.1 is based on
VTK 6.0
and hence includes all the fixes and enhancements that went into the VTK 6.0
release. (If you're wondering what happened to 4.0.0: we nabbed an issue as
the binaries
were being built for 4.0.0 and hence we decided to put out 4.0.1 instead).

*Enhancements for Visualizing Multi-block Datasets*
This release introduces a new way for interacting with multi-block datasets,
making it easier to change display parameters such as visibility, color, and
opacity for multi-block datasets. Using the Multi-Block Inspector, users
can now
specify such properties on a per-block basis. By treating the multi-block
hierarchy as a basic scene-graph, properties specifications can be
inherited,
thus avoiding the need to explicitly specify overrides for all blocks.

Block properties can also be changed using the context menu in the 3D view.
By
selecting multiple blocks, one can change properties for all the selected
blocks
using the context menu. Refer to this blog post to get started
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/posts/view/503).

*Enhancements to the Properties Panel*
The Properties panel has been undergoing changes in the past few releases.
This
release includes further cleanups, bug-fixes and enhancements including a
newer
and cleaner look for the Properties panel with the ability to  group widgets
based on functionality. The plugin framework has now been extended to enable
users to add custom widgets for the new properties panel. Refer to this blog
post covering how to effectively use the new panel
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491). Developers are referred to
ParaView
Wiki (http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Properties_Panel) for additional
details.

*Extended annotations with mathtext*
One of the most requested features on ParaView User Voice (
http://paraview.uservoice.com)
was the ability to add mathematical markup to annotation text. ParaView can
now
use the equation rendering support in the matplotlib package to generate
mathematical equations in selected text fields. The support for mathtext was
added in 3.98 and has been expanded in this release to include chart titles,
scalar bar title and labels, along with text sources. ParaView binaries come
bundled with matplotlib. Siimply use $<math-text>$ as the text to use.
Anything
containing the $...$ symbols will be treated as math-text and rendered using
matplotlib. Refer to this blog post (
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/509).

*Exporting vector graphics*
One of the most requested features on ParaView User Voice
(http://paraview.uservoice.com) was to add support for vector graphics. With
this release, it is now possible to export scenes from 3D views and charts
as
postscript, eps, pdf, or svg vector graphics. All text and annotations such
as
scalar bars, cube-axes, and curves in charts are exported as vector
graphics,
thus ensuring crisp reproduction for publications. 3D surfaces and volumes,
however, must remain embedded as a rasterized image in the resulting output
file. Refer to this blog post for more details
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/508).

*Completely redesigned ParaViewWeb*
Using Web-based technologies for 3D interactive visualization is now easier
than
ever before with the totally redesigned ParaViewWeb. ParaViewWeb is a
collection
of components that enables the use of ParaView's visualization and data
analysis
capabilities within Web applications and is now simply a part of ParaView
source
(and binary) packages. Using the latest HTML 5.0 based technologies, such as
WebSocket, and WebGL, ParaViewWeb enables communication with a ParaView
server
running on a remote visualization node or cluster using a lightweight
JavaScript
API. Using this API, Web applications can easily embed interactive 3D
visualization components. Application developers can write simple Python
scripts
to extend the server capabilities including creating custom visualization
pipelines. Updated documentation and examples coming soon, so stay tuned.

*Enhancement to CoProcessing Modules*
ParaView?s CoProcessing support has undergone several usability improvements
with the ability to build adapters externally, and cleanups to the Python
coprocessing modules and scripts. Additional details will soon be available
in
form a Catalyst/CoProcessing Users Guide in the near future.

*Improvements to Scalar Bar (Color Legend)*
We have added several new enhancements to scalar bar in this release.
Besides
general improvements in the appearance and label rendering, the scalar bar
now
has the ability to accept MathText (similar to LaTeX) for the title,
subtitle,
and annotation text. Similar to including MathText in chart titles and text
sources in previous release, any text that enclosed within dollar ($) signs,
($...$) will be presumed to be MathText. This requires Python support with
matplotlib available, which is included in the distributed binaries. You
can now
include Greek letters and other math symbols in your legend.

Another new feature is that colormaps may now be marked to indicate that
their
domains are ratio or interval-scaled (i.e., continuous, as in previous
versions
of ParaView) or categorical (also called nominal). Categorical colormaps
are not
shown as a continuous range of colors but as a discrete set of color
swatches.
You may set the text to accompany each value in the Annotations tab of the
color
legend editor. Arrays that hold categorical data (where there are no more
than
32 unique values stored across all array entries) will automatically have
annotations added when you open the color legend editor. When switching a
colormap between ratio and categorical modes, the color set-points in the
continuous color bar are used as the colors to assign to categorical
values; the
default blue-to-red colormap has only 2 color set-points, so if you switch
from
this preset to a categorical colormap, you will see only 2 color swatches:
red
and blue. However, another new feature is that several categorical colormap
presets have been added, including the Brewer palettes. You may wish to
choose
one of these presets (which will automatically switch the colormap to
categorical mode).

*Documentation*
Starting with this release, we will now be providing online documentation
for
the Python and JavaScript API along with the C++ API online. The
documentation
can be accessed from
http://www.paraview.org/paraview/help/api-documentation.html.

*Nightly binaries*
For users interested into trying out the latest and greatest developments
for
ParaView as the development team works on them without building from source,
they can download the nightly builds from the ParaView download page
(http://paraview.org//paraview/resources/software.php).

As always, we look forward to your feedback (http://paraview.uservoice.com).
Also stay tuned to the Kitware Blog (http://www.kitware.com/blog/) for more
details on Catalyst and ParaViewWeb.

*The ParaView Team*

Thanks, Utkarsh. I did not receive my test email, so I logged into my mailing list subscription page and surprisingly found the "Mail delivery" option was changed to "OFF" for some reason. I knew I have never done that. Looks like this option was automatically changed from "ON" to "OFF" about 1.5 weeks ago. I got the same symptom on VTK list at the same time, so I'll go check this option on VTK list as well. Glad I can receive emails now from the list now that I turned the option back on.

It kind of looks like something funky is still going on with this, at least
for using the system MPI. In my superbuild cmake cache I get the following
for MPI_C_LIBRARIES:
/usr/lib/libmpich.so;/usr/lib/libopa.so;/usr/lib/libmpl.so;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so;/usr/lib/libcr.so;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so

For my paraview/src/paraview-build/CMakeCache.txt I get:
/usr/lib/libmpich.so

Is anyone else hitting this issue besides me?

They wont. If you look at mpi.use.system.cmake in PAraViewSuperbuild,
it pass the PV variables as MPI_* variables. I'd say the bug is that
the file uses PV_MPI_* variables at all. They should all just be
MPI_*.

Thanks Stephan. The conclusion makes sense as the SplitViewportHorizontal
performs operations on pixels directly. How about the quad buffer stereo?
Can you even do that on GTX card?

Aashish,

quad stereo doesn?t work on GeForce as you already mentioned too. But
interestingly NVidia seems to support in the future (see the first post:
http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=17077). But even with quad
stereo the problem remain.

The left and right image are merged in vtkRenderWindow::
StereoRenderComplete(void). There is an pixel-wise copying for all
stereo-types except "Crystal Eyes". Here I would request an improvement for
the future, to speed up the execution.

Thanks in advance,
Stephan

Aashish,

I've made another test on my render node [1] and my desktop PC. The FPS-drop
depends on the size of the render viewport. To showcase the drop I ran
ParaView in the "SplitViewportHorizontal" mode and play a looped animation
with an empty scene. Then I measured the FPS with three different viewport
sizes:

Resolution => FPS on render node [1]
1617 x 906 => 33 FPS (PV window maximized)
1617 x 702 => 45 FPS
1617 x 438 => 60 FPS

Resolution => FPS on desktop PC [2]
1617 x 906 => 20 FPS (PV window maximized)
1617 x 707 => 26 FPS
1617 x 292 => 60 FPS

Conclusion: The Quadro performs better within that stereo mode, but has also
a drop of ca. 50 % when the PV window is maximized.

[1] Render node:
* 2x NVidia Quadro K5000
* ParaView on git-master (latest)
* Fraps as FPS-Display
* Windows 7 64 Bit

[2] Desktop PC:
* NVidia GeForce GTX 580
* ParaView on git-master (latest)

As you said earlier, the FPS will drop but not as hard as you have seen on
GTX cards. How does the FPS drop on 5000 compares with the FPS drop on GTX?

When I use "SplitViewportHorizontal" as stereo mode on my Kepler GPUs I can
see a FPS drop. Interestingly the rate depends on the ParaView's window
size. The smaller the window is the higher the rate and vice versa. I guess
that a post process, which copies pixel between buffers, need some more time

Yes, that mode ?performs the copy between buffers to produce the final
image.?

Hi Stephan,?
GeForce GTX 580 are not great for stereo rendering as I believe they don't
support Quad buffered stereo
?(http://3dvision-blog.com/3840-nvidia-with-a-new-high-end-gpu-namely-the-ge

In that case, I believe VTK will perform software stereo implementation and
that's why your performance will go down quite a bit.?

I don't have the latest card but normally the consumer level card don't
support stereo that well (although this might not be the case with recent
NVIDIA cards).?

Let us know if you find this performance degradation on your Quadro cards as
well with latest paraview.?

This is tested on GeForce GTX 580. The ParaView version is pulled from

Surprisingly, this problem does not occurs on my Render-PC of our

Hello,

I observed an unexpected frame rate drop when using one of PV's supported

Considering
* OS: Windows
* V-Sync: On
* Application to display FPS (e.g. www.fraps.com)
* Latest ParaView from git-master

Following steps should emphasizes the frame rate drop:
1. Open ParaView without any stereo mode
2. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 60 FPS)
3. Close ParaView
4. Open ParaView with "--stereo" flag enabled
5. Rotate or drag the camera in the 3D view for several seconds and watch at
the frame rate (should be around 22 FPS)

Obviously, stereo rendering should take twice the time of a monocular
rendering. But this should only occurs in more complex scenes. Can anyone
reproduce this behavior? Is this a BUG?

Subject: [Paraview] Irregular outer boundary of Points
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6ZpurOdw4ZciCWQTqvgzYKDhTFoFVjOzgvtYXR+6aoxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi dear ParaView Users,

I am trying to see the outline of a number of points which I input in to
paraview as a CSV file
and then convert to points using "Table to Points" filter.

When putting the representation to "OUTLINE" , ParaView will show me a
rectangular outline of these points. What I am interested to see is an
irregular outline or outer boundary of these group of points which shows
exactly the area covered by the points. ( my points are 3D but I am
watching them on a 2D plane)

Is there anyway in ParaView to see the outline of Points as they actually
are (irregular boundary of the group of points)  and not an estimated
rectangular boundary as OUTLINE representation?


Thanks in advance for any help on this.

Any producer producing vtkUniformGrid/vtkImageData needs to override
vtkAlgorithm::RequestInformation(...) and provide meta-data about the
extents of the image, origin, and spacing. Refer to another Image
source e.g. vtkRTAnalyticSource on how that should be done.

so that cleared up a few of the errors but now I am getting this:


Error    187    error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "__declspec(dllimport) const pqAnimationKeyFrame::`vftable'{for `QObject'}" (__imp_??_7pqAnimationKeyFrame@@6BQObject@@@) referenced in function "public: __cdecl pqAnimationKeyFrame::pqAnimationKeyFrame(class pqAnimationTrack *,class QGraphicsScene *)" (??0pqAnimationKeyFrame@@QEAA at PEAVpqAnimationTrack@@PEAVQGraphicsScene@@@Z)

This is also with the just released ParaView 4.0.1 sources. What I find strange is that a release was done from these sources. I think my self compiled Qt is in some way causing these errors as I checked the Dashboard and none of the Windows computers seem to be having these issues. Just seems odd that everyone else can compile ParaView without a problem but I can not.

Thoughts?

Hi Bill,

The issues with the live connection to Catalyst from the ParaView GUI
should now be fixed. Let me know if you get any weird issues with it.

Subject: [Paraview] Function attribute in Xdmf/HDF5 format
Message-ID: <1371565311.3199.64.camel@sputnik.bsc.es>

Hi Paraview users/developers,

I am generating some output data in Xdmf/HDF5 format which I want to
visualize later with Paraview. I have seen that the current Xdmf support
in Paraview is a bit flawed and is not completed for some complex Xdmf
Entities, eg. DataItem with Functions.

I have been able to use "JOIN()" function correctly, however "WHERE()"
is causing SegFaults or results are wrong using last Paraview-3.98
version. Furthermore, I have seen that some operators for Function
attribute in Xdmf Attributes are 'nasty'. Let me explain a little bit:

* "WHERE()" function in Xdmf supports filtering some data if the
sentence given is true. For instance, "WHERE($0 == 10.0)" would show
only those attributes values where the value is equal 10. It also works
with '<' or '>' operators. The point is that '<' and '>' are protected
keywords in Xml and they cannot be used like that in Xdmf files, we have
to use '&lt' and '&gt'. However, these operators don't work neither in
Paraview and a segfault is given.

I don't know if this is the best place, but my recommendation would be
to use 'EQ', 'NE', 'LT', 'GT' keywords for Function operators (similar
to Fortran ones for instance) instead of the current ones.

What are the plans about a full support of Xdmf standard?
Anyone has any further experience with this in Paraview? Any help would
be appreciated.

P.D.: I am attaching the examples if anybody wants to play a little bit
with Xdmf and Function operators in Paraview.


Best regards,
Ra?l

Actually, the issue is with pqWidgets. Compiling this library I get hundreds of errors of the type:

Note that this is with the generated moc_* files of pqWidgets so I am not sure what is happening.

Hello David,

Thanks for your reply. Delunay 3D will actually work and give me the
irregular area, but if I put the representation to outline to see the
outline of this object, again the outline will be a rectangle.

Is there anyway to see the outer boundary of a group of points without
seeing the interior points, that is is there anyway to see the PERIMETER
of a group of points?

I would except there isn't a prebuilt VS11 version of Qt. I'll take the next day to do a full Qt build and test against that.

Hello Ra?l

I'm not sure how complete the XML implementation is in the XDMF library
either. For example, I tried to use XPath to avoid repeating the XML for my
mesh geometry at every timestep, but could not get it to work successfully.
I ended up having to repeat the writing of the same XML over and over.
Perhaps the XDMF library supports XPath, but the ParaView XDMF reader does
not?

I've successfully used JOIN as well. But I've never tried WHERE.

And I think your suggestion of using Fortran style operators like GT, LT,
etc is excellent.

But I'm not even sure who to talk to about implementing such an improvement
into XDMF. Can anyone on this list tell us?

Cheers
Jason

Hi Michael,

I saw you also using CTK (ctkDoubleRangeSlider)? how does that gets pulled
in when you are building Paraview? The only thing I can think of is
QtTesting. Are you using QtTesting built from CTK?

Yumin,

That was recently added to ParaView, so that's not too surprising. We
should rename it at some point.

Works on my Windows 7x64 running VS 2012 Express. Configured with Qt 4.8.4 self built (No QtWebKit) using CMake 2.8.10.1.

Also tested on Windows 7x64 VS 2010 Pro. Configured with Qt 4.8.4 self built (No QtWebKit) using CMake 2.8.10.1.

               THIRD WORKSHOP ON DATA-FLOW EXECUTION MODELS
                   FOR EXTREME SCALE COMPUTING (DFM 2013)
               to be held in conjunction with PACT 2013

               September 8, 2013, Edinburgh, Scotland
               http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/dfmworkshop/

The First International workshop on "Data-Flow Models (DFM) for extreme 
scale computing" was held in Galveston Island, Texas in October 2011 in 
conjunction with PACT 2011. DFM 2012 was held in conjunction with PACT 
2012 in Minneapolis, Minnesota in September 2012.

The purpose of DFM continues being to bring together those researchers 
interested in novel computational models based on Data-Flow principles 
of execution. The switch to multi-core systems has raised concurrency to 
the level of a major issue if we are to use the increasing number of 
cores in a chip.

In the past five decades, sequential computing dominated the computer 
architecture landscape because designers were successful at building 
faster and faster computers by solely relying on improvements on 
fabrication technologies and architectural/organization optimizations. 
The most severe limitation of the sequential model, namely its inability 
to tolerate long memory latencies has slowed down the performance gains. 
This phenomenon is the ubiquitous Memory Wall. While various mechanisms 
have been implemented to overcome the wall (such as extremely efficient 
hardware prefetch support for example), they only add to another wall 
that hampers highly efficient execution of programs and modern chip 
design: the Power Wall. Power considerations and heat dissipation issues 
have forced manufacturers to switch to multiple cores per chip and thus 
move into the concurrency era.

New concurrent models/paradigms are needed in order to fully utilize the 
potential of Multi-core chips. The Data-flow model is a formal model 
that can handle concurrency and tolerate memory and synchronization 
latencies. Data-Flow inspired systems could also be simpler and more 
power efficient than conventional systems. Recent work has shown that 
the Data-Flow principles can be used to develop systems that can 
outperform systems based on conventional techniques. Thus, it is time to 
revisit Data-driven computation and bring it to the Multi-core and 
extreme scale computing.

DFM 2013 solicits novel papers that include but are not limited to:
- Novel Data-Flow inspired Execution models and architectures
- Functional and Single assignment based Languages.
- Strict and non-strict execution models.
- Compilers and tools for Data-Flow/Data-Driven systems.
- Hybrid Data-driven/Control-driven systems.
- Position Papers on the Future of Data-Flow in the Multi-core era and 
beyond.

All accepted papers will appear in the Computer Society Digital Library. 
Extended versions of the best papers will be published in a special 
issue of IJPP (International Journal on Parallel Programming).

Subject: [Paraview] Display Transformation in PV 4.0
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP468B133D568A59FF5EB9DC2F08C0@phx.gbl>

Hi All,

Since the display and properties panels are merged in the new PV 4.0,
where is the transformation input (used to be in the display panel)? I
cannot find it directly. But I can type "orientation" in the search box
in the new Properties panel to find it.

I wonder if I can find it by clicking the mouse.

Thanks,
Jim

Hi Jim,

The transform is an "advanced" property. You can access it by clicking
on the gear next to the search box in the properties panel.

Hi, 

So i'm running CFD, in house, code that output it's field files in ensight gold format.  Most of the time i have no problems with paraview opening my field files, but sometimes paraview crashes with this error output:

I was hoping someone could shed some light on what that means.  The error makes even less sense, to me, when i rerun the simulation and then the file opens flawlessly.   Any help would be much appreciated. I've only put up a the first few lines of the error traceback, let me know if you need all of them to make it more clear.

Message-ID: <0386E970-0DA7-4921-B956-10A18DFDB063@uvm.edu>

A bit of an amendment to my last post.  I can open the files, that cause paraview to crash on my mac, off the paraview on my cluster without any issues.  That version on the cluster is 3.6.1, so i tried that on my mac and paraview still crashes.  I usually use the newest version which, right now, is 4.0.

Hi John,

For render window interaction via pvpython, see the example script here:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-June/018059.html

You probably need to update the library name in the 2nd import statement.


As for your 2nd question, it is possible to create a custom ParaView app
(with GUI) from Python, but it takes some setup.  It's not a use case that
is supported with examples and documentation, but if you're clever you can
do it using a python Qt library like PyQt4.  My preferred library is called
PythonQt, with a c++ plugin you can expose much of the ParaView pq api to
python.  I don't have documentation for it, yet, but it's here
(PythonQtPlugin-pv4.0 branch):

I have not been receiving emails properly,
I discovered the other day that all my emails from lists

cmake/cmake-dev/paraview/paraview-dev/vtk/vtk-dev/

which are all kitware run have been classified as SPAM by the servers for about the last 10 days.
I filed a bug/report with our mail people and they told me that the kitware IP has been blacklisted.

Not sure what is going to happen next - if it can be lifted or anything. I have no idea who controls these things, but it must be something on our swiss ETHZ server, but possibly it was picked up from another which is also affecting you

Anyone expecting replies from me on threads I have participated in recently - apologies, I'm not seeing most of them unless I trawl though a lot of junk email.

Subject: [Paraview] Can't see an object in view area after OpenFOAM
 installation with lower ver. of Paraview
Message-ID: <51C17693.30302@gmail.com>

Dear all

I already had Paraview ver. 4.0.0 in my 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

After installation of OpenFOAM and Paraview ver. 3.12.0, I can see only 
grey colour in 'view area' after open data files and I can see loaded 
object only when I drag the invisible object with mouse in the view area.

I think I need to uninstall the lower version of Paraview and somehow 
link the last version to OpenFOAM but I have no idea.

Would anyone please help me?

Thank you in advance.

Finally it seemed like " Feature Edges " filter from ParaView seems to work
to get the outer boundary of an irregular shape.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.0.1 is available for download

Folks,

ParaView 4.0.1 is now available for download
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php). For those looking to checkout the source
from  the git repository, the tag name is "v4.0.1" (or simply use the "release" branch).
This release marks the first change in the major version number since 2007. Unlike the change
from 2 to 3, however, this release is not a major departure from the 3 series, but marks a
milestone in the gradual progression of ParaView UI and framework since 2007.
These notes highlight some of the major enhacements in this version that
addresses over 100 issues since the most recent release
(http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php). ParaView 4.0.1 is based on VTK 6.0
and hence includes all the fixes and enhancements that went into the VTK 6.0
release. (If you're wondering what happened to 4.0.0: we nabbed an issue as the binaries
were being built for 4.0.0 and hence we decided to put out 4.0.1 instead).

Enhancements for Visualizing Multi-block Datasets
This release introduces a new way for interacting with multi-block datasets,
making it easier to change display parameters such as visibility, color, and
opacity for multi-block datasets. Using the Multi-Block Inspector, users can now
specify such properties on a per-block basis. By treating the multi-block
hierarchy as a basic scene-graph, properties specifications can be inherited,
thus avoiding the need to explicitly specify overrides for all blocks.

Block properties can also be changed using the context menu in the 3D view. By
selecting multiple blocks, one can change properties for all the selected blocks
using the context menu. Refer to this blog post to get started
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/posts/view/503).

Enhancements to the Properties Panel
The Properties panel has been undergoing changes in the past few releases. This
release includes further cleanups, bug-fixes and enhancements including a newer
and cleaner look for the Properties panel with the ability to  group widgets
based on functionality. The plugin framework has now been extended to enable
users to add custom widgets for the new properties panel. Refer to this blog
post covering how to effectively use the new panel
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491). Developers are referred to ParaView
Wiki (http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Properties_Panel) for additional
details.

Extended annotations with mathtext
One of the most requested features on ParaView User Voice (http://paraview.uservoice.com)
was the ability to add mathematical markup to annotation text. ParaView can now
use the equation rendering support in the matplotlib package to generate
mathematical equations in selected text fields. The support for mathtext was
added in 3.98 and has been expanded in this release to include chart titles,
scalar bar title and labels, along with text sources. ParaView binaries come
bundled with matplotlib. Siimply use $<math-text>$ as the text to use. Anything
containing the $...$ symbols will be treated as math-text and rendered using
matplotlib. Refer to this blog post (http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/509).

Exporting vector graphics
One of the most requested features on ParaView User Voice
(http://paraview.uservoice.com) was to add support for vector graphics. With
this release, it is now possible to export scenes from 3D views and charts as
postscript, eps, pdf, or svg vector graphics. All text and annotations such as
scalar bars, cube-axes, and curves in charts are exported as vector graphics,
thus ensuring crisp reproduction for publications. 3D surfaces and volumes,
however, must remain embedded as a rasterized image in the resulting output
file. Refer to this blog post for more details
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/508).

Completely redesigned ParaViewWeb
Using Web-based technologies for 3D interactive visualization is now easier than
ever before with the totally redesigned ParaViewWeb. ParaViewWeb is a collection
of components that enables the use of ParaView's visualization and data analysis
capabilities within Web applications and is now simply a part of ParaView source
(and binary) packages. Using the latest HTML 5.0 based technologies, such as
WebSocket, and WebGL, ParaViewWeb enables communication with a ParaView server
running on a remote visualization node or cluster using a lightweight JavaScript
API. Using this API, Web applications can easily embed interactive 3D
visualization components. Application developers can write simple Python scripts
to extend the server capabilities including creating custom visualization
pipelines. Updated documentation and examples coming soon, so stay tuned.

Enhancement to CoProcessing Modules
ParaView?s CoProcessing support has undergone several usability improvements
with the ability to build adapters externally, and cleanups to the Python
coprocessing modules and scripts. Additional details will soon be available in
form a Catalyst/CoProcessing Users Guide in the near future.

Improvements to Scalar Bar (Color Legend)
We have added several new enhancements to scalar bar in this release. Besides
general improvements in the appearance and label rendering, the scalar bar now
has the ability to accept MathText (similar to LaTeX) for the title, subtitle,
and annotation text. Similar to including MathText in chart titles and text
sources in previous release, any text that enclosed within dollar ($) signs,
($...$) will be presumed to be MathText. This requires Python support with
matplotlib available, which is included in the distributed binaries. You can now
include Greek letters and other math symbols in your legend.

Another new feature is that colormaps may now be marked to indicate that their
domains are ratio or interval-scaled (i.e., continuous, as in previous versions
of ParaView) or categorical (also called nominal). Categorical colormaps are not
shown as a continuous range of colors but as a discrete set of color swatches.
You may set the text to accompany each value in the Annotations tab of the color
legend editor. Arrays that hold categorical data (where there are no more than
32 unique values stored across all array entries) will automatically have
annotations added when you open the color legend editor. When switching a
colormap between ratio and categorical modes, the color set-points in the
continuous color bar are used as the colors to assign to categorical values; the
default blue-to-red colormap has only 2 color set-points, so if you switch from
this preset to a categorical colormap, you will see only 2 color swatches: red
and blue. However, another new feature is that several categorical colormap
presets have been added, including the Brewer palettes. You may wish to choose
one of these presets (which will automatically switch the colormap to
categorical mode).

Documentation
Starting with this release, we will now be providing online documentation for
the Python and JavaScript API along with the C++ API online. The documentation
can be accessed from
http://www.paraview.org/paraview/help/api-documentation.html.

Nightly binaries
For users interested into trying out the latest and greatest developments for
ParaView as the development team works on them without building from source,
they can download the nightly builds from the ParaView download page
(http://paraview.org//paraview/resources/software.php).

As always, we look forward to your feedback (http://paraview.uservoice.com).
Also stay tuned to the Kitware Blog (http://www.kitware.com/blog/) for more
details on Catalyst and ParaViewWeb.

Both version will work.

The version ParaView-4.0.1-Darwin-64bin.dmg works on Leopard, Snow Leopard,
Lion and Mountain Lion, but it is using Python 2.6 from the system.
In some use case Python 2.6 may not be enough and users may want to rely on
a 2.7 version.
If so, they should download ParaView-4.0.1-Lion-Python27-64bit.dmg,
although this version will only work on Lion and Mountain Lion when Python
2.7 was introduced.

The reason for that new "Lion-Python27" version is for ParaViewWeb which
seems to have an issue with Python 2.6 due to the twisted library that we
are using...

Hi Claudio,

Thanks for reporting this issue.  It's a bug in the script, I think it
might only be an issue if using the script in ParaView 4.0, is that the
version you are using?  Anyway, to correct it, please edit line 179 and
change:

    exportViewToDirectory(GetRenderView(), outDir)

to

    exportViewToDirectory(smp.GetRenderView(), outDir)

I will upload a new version of the script, too, with this correction.

Pat

All,

Running 4.0.1, although I think it was the same in previous versions.

When I add multiple Ruler Sources, only 1 is visible at a time.   This makes it difficult to show much in the way of dimensions.   

Am I doing something stupid?

Are you sure only one instance is created? By default all instances are
created at the same locations. If you move one of the points, can you see
the other rulers?

Okay, I see what you mean. Look like the behavior is changed from 3.98.0,
which actually shows all the instances at the same time. You can file a bug
report on this.

Hi, sorry about that!  It's another typo in the script, this time the typo
is only exposed if you have camera parallel projection enabled (instead of
perspective projection).  I uploaded a new version of the script that
corrects the typo, so please re-download:

http://packages.kitware.com/item/3021

However, KiwiViewer will set the view projection to perspective by default,
not parallel projection, so if you set the camera position in paraview
using parallel projection then the camera position might not be optimal in
KiwiViewer's perspective, so I would recommend that you setup your view
with perspective mode before exporting.

You should enter array sizes as an extent, e.g. if you have an array of 10*8*15 points, you should enter 0 9 for x, 0 7 for y and 0 14 for z.

Hi,

I cannot download the new ParaView since I cannot view the download page http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php since some  days. To be more specific, the page appears, but the pull-down widgets where one can choose the version, OS etc. are empty. I am using (have to use :( )M$ Internet Explorer 8 under Windoze XP. Am I the only one with this problem? If so, is there an alternative download location?

Thanks,

Matthias

No,

I also thought it worked this way, but no. The only way you can have 10919 points is if you have an array of 1*61*179 points. Right? Then the extent will be x: 0 0; y: 0 60; z: 0 178.

Try this.

Oleg.

Hello.

I have an error in PV 4.0.1 after making a selection using Select Cells

When doing the same thing with PV 3.14.1, all is OK. So it seems that 
this error appeared with PV.3.98.0 or PV.3.98.1. Is this a known bug ?

All tested PV versions (3.14.1, 3.98.1 and 4.0.1) are Linux 64 bits 
binaries.

Best regards.

Subject: [Paraview]  Problem of Block Selection
Message-ID: <51C2E1BF.8060204@onera.fr>

Hello.


Many thanks to Karl K?nig for his info on the bug about "Show Frustum" 
in the Selectio inspector.

But I have another problem related to Selection with a Frustum in 
Paraview: I have a complex multi-block surface geometry and I want to 
select all blocks inside or intersecting the rubberband frame drawn when 
I drag the mouse.

I am using the "Select blocks" mode, but the problem is that I get only 
the VISIBLE blocks!  And it is not always possible to get a point of 
view where all searched blocks are visible.

Then I have to search for the missing blocks in the Selection inspector: 
I check each block one by one to highlight it and see if it is a missing 
block. This is a rather long task if there are many blocks ( > 300) and 
if the missing blocks are very small.

So my question is : is there a method to get all blocks in the selection 
like cells inside a Frustum in the "Select cells through" mode ? If not, 
it would be nice to have such a "Select blocks through" mode in a next 
release.

Richard.

as
open -a paraview filename.pvd
I get a window, title Open data with ... asking me for a reader! (see

Good suggestion. Mind adding a feature request on the bug tracker
(http://paraview.org/Bug)? BTW, you can also use the "Multiblock
Inspector" to select blocks of interest.

Do you mind trying again, I've updated that web page to avoid a known issue
on IE and based on our local test with IE, we managed to get things working
again.

Thanks for reporting the issue,

Utkarsh

I have added a feature request 0014137 on the bug tracker:
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14137
Feel free to add comments if it's not clear enough.

Thank you for your suggestion of using the "Multiblock Inspector"

At the end of the for loop, I delete all the objects and readers. I run
this python script in batch mode (Paraview 3.98) and in parallel with 4
processors. However I am having a memory leak, by the 6th time in the for
loop it complains about insufficient memory. Can anyone understand what is
causing the memory to increase? Do I forget to delete sth?

Thank you,

Subject: [Paraview] Strange tube behaviour
Message-ID: <CA+V7QS9a_CKj1sWVSsaOWg-iUi0-9-kFuAPsidmbtGEKsHpEsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm finding inconsistent behaviour between mac 4.0.1 (binary install) and
linux 4.0.1 which I compiled myself. The issue is to do with applying the
tube filter.

I load a streamline dataset (which is an ascii vtk polydata file) - these
streamlines are from MRI brain data, not fluid simulations. Streamlines
show up fine for both platforms. I then apply the tube filter - on the mac
this works fine, however the tube filter is greyed out on the linux
version, so I'm not able to select it. This also works on older versions
for the mac (3.12). Is this a known issue? Is there a hidden configuration
somewhere that I've missed?

Subject: [Paraview] Creating an orbit camera path with a certain angle to
	normal of object
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6F5E5xkjazVAGMwktTPWqXo7=yj-N1gT82Awudrd94Kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


Could anybody please give me a hint how I can create an orbit (camera path)
around an object by setting

CENTER, NORMAL AND ORIGIN of camera orbit in the Animation View.

I know how to create an arbitrary orbit, but I don?t know how to create an
orbit that has a certain angle with the normal of the object.

It is a very time consuming task If I want to create this orbit each time
by manually setting points and I was wondering if there was any way to
create an orbit around the object that has a specific angle with the object
.

Thanks for any replies.
Regards

Hello Nikos

I have memory leak issues when creating animations from an XDMF file from
the Paraview GUI (version 3.14.1 32-bit). In my case, I was using a single
file XDMF file pair (i.e., one XML file and one HDF5 file) rather than a
series of XDMF files.

As a workaround, I use VTK to write a series of images and then make the
animation from those myself.

I wonder if there is a memory leak in the Paraview 3.x XDMF reader? I think
Kitware may have used a new version of the XDMF library in the recently
released Paraview 4.0 ... if so, then you might try Paraview 4.0 to see if
that fixes the issue.

Cheers
Jason

But when I import the file, I can only apply Table To Structured Grid filter, and it reads the file as if it were arbitrary curvilinear grid. How can I transform this grid to the rectilinear one? And is there any way to interpolate data between points, as grid size is 12*11*14 only? I could, for example, create finer uniform rectilinear mesh and estimate f on this mesh points, then plot it, but don't know how to do it. Any advice is appreciated.

I am trying to build 4.0.1 using the Superbuild on an Intel-build system.    I have my compilers set to icc/icpc     I'm failing deep down in the QT build with missing Intel libraries - and I believe that the reason for the failure is that somehow QT is trying to build with gcc/g++ rather than icc/icpc.  Is there any way to force the compiler selection down to QT?

Hi Rick,

You may be able to set your CXX and CC environment variables in the shell
your building in to get what you want. I don't know enough about the Qt
build system though to know if it will then use those compilers but I'm
optimistic enough to think it will :)

Andy - I think that I have that set when I run the top level cmake.   The Build/CMakeCache.txt file has this:

CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/056/bin/intel64/icpc
CMAKE_C_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/056/bin/intel64/icc

Hi Rick,

You may be able to set your CXX and CC environment variables in the shell your building in to get what you want. I don't know enough about the Qt build system though to know if it will then use those compilers but I'm optimistic enough to think it will :)

Hmm, just to make sure things are working properly do you also get the same
thing in the Build/paraview/src/paraview-build/CMakeCache.txt? If you
aren't then it may not have been set properly. If it is then the superbuild
code would have to be changed to pass that information down to the external
projects which probably isn't too hard of a task to do. At that point it
may be faster to just build your own version of Qt with specified compilers
(look at ParaViewSuperbuild/Projects/qt.cmake for the options that are used
to build Qt).

I may have actually found the right answer ...

You can pass a platform command to qt/configure and one of the options is linux-icc-64.

So, in the top level cmake, I've added:

qt_EXTRA_CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS:STRING=-platform linux-icc-64

and it *seems* to be building now!

Subject: [Paraview] .Creating an orbit camera path with a certain angle to
	normal
Message-ID: <4A466FF9363E8E4B871F07B0A43E54A81AA1D7D8@bw2k8azemail2>

Hedieh,

Hello!  I successfully got my object to orbit as I wanted by doing:

Open the camera settings for the object
Play with the camera settings until you have the object positioned the way you want it to orbit.  
I used the -x position button on the paraview gui as a starting point.  That positions it so that the +x axis is pointing out.  You can then use the Elevation on the camera settings to tilt it to a specified angle.
When you have it the way you want it, open the animation view.
Select camera and then hit the plus sign on the left to add a camera to the animation view.  Just accept the values in the center, normal, origin popup.
Hit play.
The object will orbit using the camera settings.
If you want to change your camera settings:
delete the camera in the animation view,
change your camera settings,
then add the camera back into the animation view.  It uses the camera settings at the time when it's added.

Hope this helps!
Karen

Hello,


Could anybody please give me a hint how I can create an orbit (camera path) around an object by setting

CENTER, NORMAL AND ORIGIN of camera orbit in the Animation View.

I know how to create an arbitrary orbit, but I don?t know how to create an orbit that has a certain angle with the normal of the object.

It is a very time consuming task If I want to create this orbit each time by manually setting points and I was wondering if there was any way to create an orbit around the object that has a specific angle with the object .

Thanks for any replies.
Regards

Hi Oleg,


Maybe everyone couldn't understand your problem.
Could you upload your (x y z f) data?
And if you can, it's better to upload your state files (*.pvsm).

Message-ID: <345817C8A61EA841AAE0120EC1514D9547E4DA3A@umechphd.easf.csd.disa.mil>

I want to pass a VTK build parameter from the Superbuild down into the depths of the ParaView build.   In my top level cmake command, I'm passing the flag:

-DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON \

but if I look in the paraview/src/*build/CMakeCache.txt file I'm getting this:

VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=OFF

Should I be able to pass this parameter from the top-level cmake command in the Superbuild?

Rick,

The instrastructure doesnt' support passing flags to ParaView yet.
However to build ParaView with OSMesa (which is needed for OffScreen),
you can simply enable "osmesa". Note when osmesa is enabled, Qt and
Mesa cannot be enabled (you'll get cmake errors if they are).

OK - so that brings up the point that I was working towards.   I'm relatively new to building ParaView, but in the past, I'm told that we did not use the OSmesa build, we used to build Mesa with VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=on which apparently achieved the same thing.     I have done the OSmesa build and it does exactly what I want, but it's also forcing me to do two builds - an OSMesa build for the compute node that doesn't have an Xwindow server, and a Mesa build for remote X display from the login node.   I was really looking to see if I could get by with just one build as we've apparently done in the past.

Or am I totally wrong and just need to do two builds?  8-)

Rick,

The instrastructure doesnt' support passing flags to ParaView yet.
However to build ParaView with OSMesa (which is needed for OffScreen),
you can simply enable "osmesa". Note when osmesa is enabled, Qt and
Mesa cannot be enabled (you'll get cmake errors if they are).

Finally I got ParaView built on Titan using gnu compiler chain. However, when I link those ParaView Coprocessing libraries to PHASTA simulation software which was built using pgi compiler, I got the following linking error:

------------------------
/usr/bin/ld: dynamic STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol `strcmp' with pointer equality in `/opt/cray/xe-sysroot/4.1.40/usr/lib64/libc.a(strcmp.o)' can not be used when making an executable; recompile with -fPIE and relink with -pie
------------------------

I contacted Titan user support but they have not seen such error before and have no ideas on how to resolve the error. I tried to build ParaView both statically (with BUILD_SHARED_LIB off) and dynamically (with BUILD_SHARED_LIB on) and linked them to PHASTA code and got the same linking error. In both static and dynamic build of ParaView, there exist a few shared libraries (in static build) and static libraries (in dynamic build) due to the fact of missing some static and shared libraries on Titan HPC, but ParaView built successfully without any errors in both cases. I suspect this error has to do with linking GNU-built libraries using pgi compilers, so I also tried once more to build ParaView using pgi compiler (as opposed to gnu compiler chain) and got further along to 31% built, but then got the following error after "built target protoc_compiler" and while "generating vtkPVMessage.pb.h, vtkPVMessage.pb.cc":

------------------------
/bin/sh: line 1: 64439 Illegal instruction     /ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98-Release-Titan-pgi/bin/protoc --cpp_out=dllexport_decl=VTKPVSERVERIMPLEMENTATIONCORE_EXPORT:/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98-Release-Titan-pgi/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core --proto_path /ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core /ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkPVMessage.proto

make[1]: *** [ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/CMakeFiles/protobuf_code_generation.dir/all] Error 2
------------------------
I tried to run this "protoc" on my bash environment and got the same error "Illegal instruction." I simplified the command as follows and still got the same error:
---------------------
/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98-Release-Titan-pgi/bin/protoc --cpp_out=/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98-Release-Titan-pgi/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core --proto_path /ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core /ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkPVMessage.proto
---------------------

Looking at the protoc command help, the command above looks like a valid one, but still got the error "Illegal instruction."

Any idea on what is wrong with this "protoc" command and how I can resolve this error?

I am running out of ideas and really appreciate any suggestions and comments you can provide.

Thanks,

Hong

Try using the paraview superbuild to build static lib paraview on titan.

To do that do a git fetch from:
git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git>

Then make two build directories.

In the first, set CROSS_BUILD_STAGE to "TOOLS", set CROSS_TARGET to "xk7_gnu", and build.

In the next, set CROSS_BUILD_STAGE to "CROSS", and point PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR to the first build directory and build.

If it doesn't work let us know. It has been a couple of months since I built there, and until I get a nightly dashboard up on titan, I can't assert that something hasn't broken it.

Note that this the build will use the gnu compiler chain. I haven't tried any of the other compilers recently on a cray, but I'm sure we can make it work and then add another CROSS_TARGET for them if your codes require something else.

As Burlen suggested, with static builds library order can easily be a sticking point that result in late stage linking errors. As a workaround you can make VERBOSE=1 to see the link line, and edit it and reenter it to see if this is the problem. The longer term fix for me was to add the MPI library set to the HDF5_LIBRARIES set, which makes cmake infer the proper link order. (see the bgp_xlc target's ParaViewDefaults.cmake to see that approach).

You may be missing a gni library? use nm on the .a files to figure out if it has the missing symbols. Also with static linking the order you list the libraries matters. in your case you'll need to list the gni library(ies) before the mpich libarary on the link line. You could check if that's your problem by running "make VERBOSE=1" and examining the order that's used. You could potentiall force the linker to not care about library order by enclosing mpi and it's dependencies in --start-group , --end-group linker options...

It's a little more work but in my experience things will go smoother for you if you avoid the CC wrappers when building ParaView. also pgi is used relatively rarely compared to gcc so you're asking for problems. Fine if you're prepared to dig in a deal with them, but if you want it just to work, then use gcc.

to avoid cc wrappers one thing you need to do is find mpi and its dependencies. if you run "CC --verbose" you can see the link options used by CC. You want to extract just the ones you need and no others. then since you want static linking you might need determine the order of the libraries. to give you some ideas about what you're after, I'll attach result of this process from NERSC's Cray XC30 Edison, but watch out I used dynamic linking so it's not exactly what you need.

hope this will help

I?ve been working on building ParaView on Oak Ridge HPC Titan (Cray HPC system) for its coprocessing/catalyst libraries to be linked to PHASTA simulation code running on Titan for in-situ coprocessing as well as live monitoring via pvserver which are already built and can run successfully on Oak Ridge visualization cluster Lens. There are some ?undefined references? errors while building ParaView on Titan which I already contacted Titan HPC support specialist but we are currently out of ideas on what to try next to fix these compilation errors. So I am hoping to get some ideas from people on this list who might have experienced such issues and might have some fresh ideas to help us move forward.

Specifically, we have to build ParaView on titan with ?BUILD_SHARED_LIB? off so it can be statically linked to PHASTA simulation code and run on the Titan compute nodes. I set ?apron? as MPIEXEC, set Cray pgi  wrapper compilers CC, cc, ftn as MPI_CXX_COMPILER, MPI_C_COMPILER, and MPI_FORTRAN_COMPILER, set Cray_mpich2/5.6.3 as MPI libraries to link to.  First, I tried to use gnu compilers as CMAKE compilers and was able to configure and then build ParaView, but got the following ?undefined references? errors in libmpich.a such as the following when it was about 51% built:


------------------------------------

Linking CXX executable ../../../bin/vtkpython

/opt/cray/mpt/5.6.3/gni/mpich2-pgi/119/lib/libmpich.a(gni_poll.o): In function `MPID_nem_gni_process_async_mhndl_ack':

gni_poll.c:(.text+0x3d): undefined reference to `GNI_SmsgRelease'

gni_poll.c:(.text+0x58): undefined reference to `gni_err_str'
--------------------------------

Then as suggested by HPC support specialist, I changed to use cray pgi wrapper compilers CC, cc, ftn as corresponding CMAKE compilers (rather than use gnu compilers as I initially did), however, I got the following ?undefined references? errors when it was about 19% built:


--------------------------------

/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Utilities/KWSys/vtksys/SystemTools.cxx:1768: warning: Using 'getpwnam' in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking

/opt/pgi/12.10.0/linux86-64/12.10/lib/libCmpz.a(eh_util.o): In function `std::uncaught_exception(void)':

make[2]: *** [bin/vtkHashSource-pv3.98] Error 2

make[1]: *** [VTK/Utilities/HashSource/CMakeFiles/vtkHashSource.dir/all] Error 2

make: *** [all] Error 2

---------------------------------------

Not sure why pgi compiler is trying to use glibc which then leads to the undefined reference error as shown above with libCmpz.a. This problem does not happen if we use gnu compilers for CMake compilers but we got another set of undefined references in libmpich.a as described above.

Anybody has any ideas on what is wrong here and what we should try next to resolve these ?undefined references? errors?

Many thanks for any suggestions you can provide!

Subject: [Paraview] Tube on line problem solved
Message-ID: <CA+V7QS_ic=e53EBQxRE+VFNKccZXX4KwNZmxiQBPyukBaN3bTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
My previous issue with applying the tube filter to polydata lines has been
solved, although there may be a bug that can be looked at in future
releases.

The problem came up on a linux machine on which the drop down filter menu
stretched required scrolling. The Tube filter is well down this menu and
appeared greyed out and therefore unselectable. However if I search for the
filter using the alternative menu choice, I can apply the tube filter
successfully to the line object. After that it is possible to access the
Tube filter via the "Recent" menu option. I haven't tested with alternative
window manager configurations, but did notice that I didn't have the same
problem when displaying via X on a mac (with a much bigger screen).

I use this command line to pass variables to paraview using the superbuild.

cmake

$(ParaViewSuperBuild_dir)

hope this help you.

Rick,

The ParaViewSuperbuild currently builds a newer version of Mesa which
doesn't allow building with onscreen and offscreen together
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D), so you're
stuck with two separate builds. Using older-mesa may not work either
since, if I am not mistaken, VTK has some logic after modularization
that'd make using X and OSMesa in the same build difficult, if not
impossible.

OK - thanks for the reply.    Just wanted to make sure that I wasn't wasting time by doing the additional build if I didn't need to.

Rick,

The ParaViewSuperbuild currently builds a newer version of Mesa which
doesn't allow building with onscreen and offscreen together
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D), so you're
stuck with two separate builds. Using older-mesa may not work either
since, if I am not mistaken, VTK has some logic after modularization
that'd make using X and OSMesa in the same build difficult, if not
impossible.

I'm relatively new to building ParaView, but in the past, I'm told that we did not use the OSmesa build, we used to build Mesa with VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=on which apparently achieved the same thing.     I have done the OSmesa build and it does exactly what I want, but it's also forcing me to do two builds - an OSMesa build for the compute node that doesn't have an Xwindow server, and a Mesa build for remote X display from the login node.   I was really looking to see if I could get by with just one build as we've apparently done in the past.

Hi,

thanks for the answer! Here are the files.

The most general of my questions can be stated as "How to obtain a nice isosurface from this?". The isosurface should correspond to a particular value of, say, Field 5.

Regards,
Oleg.

I just checked again if I can open these files with PV4.01 - everything works fine. If it makes any difference, I use 64bit linux version.

Hi,

Concerning the *.pvsm file:
One needs to remove the absolute path to Oleg's home directory from the
state file prior to loading it. E.g. by means of GNU sed:

   sed -i -e 's/\/home\/oleg\///' test.pvsm

Concerning getting the data into ParaView:
I'm wondering why you do not convert your CSV based data into a format
ParaView can natively read rectilinear data from? It's fairly easy to
convert your CSV data into LegacyVTK file format. Given that you're on
Linux, you could apply the attached simple shell script to test.txt and
obtain test.vtk, your rectilinear data in VTK legacy format:

   cd /home/oleg; sh convert.sh

Hope that helps,
Karl

Subject: [Paraview] 4.0.1 release: problems loading paraview.simple in
	pvpython or pvbatch
Message-ID: <CAAFVgJMTvGQxauUDFKGmB1LvwLdfPpmv-xOjy=T-59j17g2bjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having trouble while trying to import * in paraview.simple in
pvpython or pvbatch, using both the mac compiled version and a code
built from source on a unix machine, using the 4.0.1 release.

Once I added build/lib/site-packages to PYTHONPATH (this step was not
required in pvbatch 3.14.1), here's the error I get:

  File "~/local/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/vtk/__init__.py",
line 7, in <module>
    from vtkCommonCorePython import *
ImportError: No module named vtkCommonCorePython

If I launch pvbatch from a working directory and let the shell find
the executable in the path, I have the problem above. If I explicitly
launch the executable using its absolute path, I don't have that
problem (both were working in version 3.14.1). Is it an expected
change of behavior?

Thanks,
Anthony

Hi Oleg,


Sometimes CSV-formatted files are very convenient to check
the models' conditions.
So, if possible, I don't want to convert CSVs into Legacy VTKs.


I checked your data, and I found your problem.
Maybe the "Whole Extent" values of TableToStructuredGrid are wrong.

Try ((0, 13), (0, 10), (0, 11)). # 1st and 3rd arrays are swapped.
I got a rectangular source with these values successfully.

Message-ID: <CAFtK+esD8gXCFZO-WxLQ4+ecHH-fUL2p_9q71K58RSF0LmJq5Q@mail.gmail.com>

hi !

  I have some stuff like this in a python programmable filter.

pressureForce = inputs[0].PointData['pressureForce']

viscousForce = inputs[0].PointData['viscousForce']

points = inputs[0].Points

with open('blah','w') as f:

     for i in range(size(points,0)):

          f.write("%s %s \n" % (pressureForce[i,0], viscousForce[i,0]))


 Now this creates problems when I run it in parallel. I have tried using
CSV writers... they output all data and not just what I want. Any chance I
can write it on my own? I would prefer to write just the data I want in
binary (e.g pickle) since I'm going to be writing a LOT of data.

Hi,

correct! I would say it's not very intuitive. I supposed that first "whole extent" line corresponded to x axis, second to y and third to z. It seems that it works other way.

Thanks,
Oleg.

Thanks for reporting this. I've reported a bug:

Definitely sounds like a regression.

So is MatPlotLib distributed with ParaView 4.x Now? I saw something that alluded to this in the release notes and just wanted a clarification. My group was thinking of using MatPlotLib for some visualization and having this wrapped in ParaView would help.

Subject: [Paraview] Lighting in Paraview
Message-ID: <CAL_eiiRvw0dzpF0JPbTueMXuCDshPHoJt3v=WBz91O2O9_mfzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using PV 3.98. I saw some earlier posts which mention that PV does not
have an intuitive way of handling the Light direction and intensity. I was
wondering if it is still the case for PV 3.98 or is there a easy way of
 handling light? I have been trying the Light option in Edit->Settings menu
but it is not very easy to use.

Ideally I would like specify the coordinates of my light source and its
direction and intensity. Any ideas how can I go about doing this?

Thanks!
