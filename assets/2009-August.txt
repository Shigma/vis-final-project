That was my original idea and implementation: However, this way the 
WHOLE pipeline ALWAYS gets re-executed. Concrete example pipeline: 
extractVOI->GaussianSmooth. If Apply button gathers the parameters and 
sets them to the filters every time, changing e.g. only smoothing params 
(while keeping the same VOI) still causes both filters to re-execute. 
This should not happen, as VOI should be up to date. The same is true 
for more filters, e.g. Threshold: re-feeding the same parameters and/or 
arrays to process somehow fools the up-to-date'ness of the filter. Am I 
expected to walk around the problem by bookkeeping the changing params 
and the up-to-date'ness myself?

Note that this is different to paraview, where you have only one filter 
per menu entry and can explicitly request changes. Here I have one 
meta-filter, consisting of several atomic ones.

After your remark I feel the original approach was the right one. But 
then how do I only request the update if a REAL CHANGE and not only a 
FORMAL SET of parameters is the case?

regards,
Dominik

vtkSetMacro checks for changes before calling this->Modified();  But are 
you saying its a problem because not all Set functions check for changes?

To do your own bookkeeping, one idea is to connect to the QWidget's user 
property's notify signal (see QMetaObject::userPropery), and anytime one 
of those fires, you add to a list of widgets that have changed.  Then at 
apply time, just push those values down.

I am saying that (e.g.) setting VOI in vtkExtractVOI or 
InputArrayToProcess in vtkThreshold to the already previously set values 
(no factual change, just re-feed of the old ones) triggers the pipeline 
to re-execute. I do not understand this behavior as I was - as you point 
out - hoping for the set macros to take care of that.

A little above my knowledge level but many thanks for the pointers to 
start with!

Overall, many thanks for valuable insights.

Ok, I finally got it to compile replacing the CMakeCache.txt in the buildtree for ParaView3 with the CMakeCache.txt from the build tree of ParaView3.4.0, changing manually the pathes. A time I go I updated the Qt and it seems that something there got wrong. 

Greets,
Natalie

Good evening,

I have slightly modified the patch from http://markmail.org/thread/m2asfe3wod52k2ym 
  and applied it
on the cvs paraview. This error occurs :

Well it looks like there may be some missing libraries that are needed
by the linker.

The _CF* stuff is either in the Carbon library or the AppFramework so
maybe the cmake files need to be updated to allow the
vtkPVServerCommon to be linked against some OS X specific frameworks.

I added "-framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreServices" in Servers/ 
Common/CMakeFiles/vtkPVServerCommon.dir/link.txt
and everything compiled and I was able to run ParaView from the build  
directory- thanks again !

I will start to add things, i.e., python, mpi, ...

However, I believe some adjustments will be needed for the bundle  
creation when doing "make install"; I received this error
when starting ParaView with "/Applications/ParaView\ 3.7.0.app/ 
Contents/MacOS/paraview " :

Qt internal error: qt_menu.nib could not be loaded. The .nib file  
should be placed in QtGui.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/  or in  
the resources directory of your application bundle.
Abort trap

... having now come back to the original implementation (Update gathers 
parameters, pipeline re-executes always waisting time) I recalled one 
more problem I was having with it before:

vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline (0xa14ee18): The update extent 
specified in the information for output port 0 on algorithm 
vtkExtractVOI(0xa14e760) is 62 325 104 272 88 167, which is outside the 
whole extent 63 324 105 271 89 166.

which is really driving me mad as I can google out absolutely no 
conclusions on this frequently raised issue. Migrating to signal/slots 
resolved this issue (while creating new ones...)

with regards,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] Modify font size
Message-ID: <4A76A396.1000201@cscs>

Hi,

I have a problem when using ParaView on my laptop. When I go to
filters->alphabetical, all the filters are displayed so that it covers
all my screen and I can't even select those I want.
Is there a simple way to decrease the font size? why is there not a
scroll bar instead of displaying all the filters like this? I know that
this is a Qt option but in case someone already knows the answer...

Thanks in advance.

Jerome

Alternatively you can use Ctrl+Space or Alt+Space to popup a "quick
search" dialog in which you can type to create the filter/source you
want.

So that other poor souls save some time... the problem was this single 
line of code executed at the beginning of the apply function:

image->GetPointData()->SetActiveScalars(comboBoxFieldName->currentText().toStdString());

I would not expect setting the active scalars to modify the object, but 
doing my own bookkeeping for the scalar name (and calling this line only 
when the value really changes) fixes it.

Interestingly, this also solved the problem with the update extents. 
While I am glad I had solved it - and am grateful for the very useful 
hints I received - I would still allow myself to complain at the ease 
with which it is possible to make errors and at the difficulties to find 
them quickly... (this is in the context of our recent (very hot :) 
discussions over here to eventually switch the whole visualization group 
to work with VTK and not raw OpenGL - and those points are always the 
counter arguments of my opponents...)

with regards,
Dominik

Here is what I do in my current projects, I think ParaView is similar:

  I have a file called CompleteBundle.cmake.in that I 'Configure' with  
cmake to fill in to the blanks. I then manually copy a "qt.conf" file  
and the qt_menu.nib into the proper location in the Application  
Bundle. Here is my file which will obviously need to be adapted for  
paraview:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

#-- Need this for link line stuff?
if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
   cmake_policy(SET CMP0009 NEW)
endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)


if (${CMAKE_VERSION} VERSION_GREATER 2.6.2)
if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
   cmake_policy(SET CMP0011 NEW)
endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)
endif()

Subject: [Paraview] Transforming Points IDs to Global IDs
Message-ID: <678119.93319.qm@web110114.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

what is the easiest way to transform Points IDs to Global IDs ?

I have a Multiblock Dataset, and I can iterate through its blocks, get each cell of each block and get the ids of its points. These points ids are unique and global, since my model is being read with the Ensight reader. Now, I would like that this point information persists when I apply a filter to my model. 

For example: suppose I have a Model with 2 parts: A and B. When I look at the points nodes which belong to the part A, I have a set. Then I extract this part, selecting it and using Extract Selection filter. When I look again to its points ids it seems that I have another set: they have been regenerated, and begin with 0 and end with "number of points".

Is there a way to avoid this ?

Thanks,
Rafael March.

See also:
<http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=7818>

It address the "while still preserving Carbon build functionality" part
of your comment.  But it does mean a backwards-incompatibility in VTK,
however it's only to a semi-public API and is unlikely to affect many
apps (it will affect apps that are not "wholly VTK" like my app and
OsiriX, but the change is simple).

Is that OK?  Maybe I should ask on vtk-dev...

regarding your email below, could you please be kind to provide me an 
example on how to load the ascii file in ParaView and saving it as binary

(vtk legacy) written in fortran and I would like to create  movie, but 
loading the files take long 
time and space.

Thank you!

You can use the visit_writer:

http://certik.github.com/visit_writer/

that I extracted from Visit. I can write binary vtk files and works
very nice for me.

Hi all,
I have from one simulation datas (Particle datas, position xyz and radius of this particle and one scalar property). I am able to display this information using paraview/Table to Point/ Glyph etc.
But how can I create animation automatically?
Many thanks for your ideas.

Are you running on Linux.  You should be able to change the fonts used in the ParaView's GUI (and any Qt application GUI) by running to qtconfig application.

With ParaView 3.6, you can do:

from paraview.simple import *
r = LegacyVTKReader()
r.FileNames = ["foo.vtk"]
w = servermanager.writers.DataSetWriter()
w.Input = r
w.FileName = "bar.vtk"
w.UpdatePipeline()

You will have to create a loop where you do the following 3:

for index in range...:
  r.FileNames = ["foo%d.vtk"  % index]
  w.FileName = "bar%d.vtk % index
  w.UpdatePipeline

To convert binary to ascii, do
w.FileType = 'Ascii'

Ah yes, you're right, I had not seen that my .config/Trolltech.conf was 
not including the good values. The qtconfig gui was taking size values 
from my desktop config and not from this file so everything was looking 
fine from this gui, but Paraview was taking the configuration from the 
Trolltech.conf file with bad font size values.
To make it understandable, I had not realized that the values displayed 
in qtconfig were not the ones written in this config file.
I should have tried changing again the font size value from the qtconfig 
gui and do save.

Anyway thanks for tips, it's fixed.

Hi,

Sorry to introduce me in this conversation but it's very interesting for me.
I have a little query about the functions reader VTK.
Can I use a mmap to import the data file ?
Like this code 

import mmap
import os
import time
from paraview.simple import *

filename = "sphere.vtk"

file = open(filename, "r+")
size = os.path.getsize(filename)
data = mmap.mmap(file.fileno(), size, flags=mmap.MAP_SHARED, prot=mmap.PROT_READ)   #Linux

r = LegacyVTKReader()
???
But after, I don't see how I can do...


Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards, 
Jona

Subject: [Paraview] Average value on specific sub-domains
Message-ID: <002401ca15bc$0fee9790$2fcbc6b0$@wu-2@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I am from Manchester, UK and I am new to CFD calculations. I am using Code_Saturne(http://code-saturne.blogspot.com) /FVM method to produce data in EnSight format and then checking it in ParaView. An illustration is attached. I am working on coolant oil flow and so the picture shows a matrix of oil flow ducts. This is a 2D model with structured rectangular mesh grid, but the mesh density is not uniform.

In order to compare with results from my lumped parameter models, I have to investigate average values of parameters (the most important one of these is temperature) on specific sub-domains, as framed out in the picture. I found a solution (http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-April/007882.html) and tried the filter "integrate variables", but found the result doesn't seem to be reasonable. I guess I must did something wrong.

I am quite interested in the extension script by python. Because my model is constructed by basic geometric elements, and the number of the elements is growing along with my progress, I am thinking about using python to obtain average values for all of the sub-domains in a loop. If I can access information of all the cells in a specific sub-domain (I can compute coordinate of these domains first), including rectangular cells' sides and areas as well as the corresponding cell values (temperature, pressure, velocity etc), I guess it is not difficult to derive average values for all of the sub-domains.

I know a little about python and have experience on programming. I looked up ParaView Wiki, tried some python samples, but unfortunately I still don't know how to start to implement my idea. Is there a detailed API functions manual existing? Or could you please give some hints or examples to help?

Thank you very much for your help about this.

Best regards,
Wei

Now that the flurry around 3.6 has settled a bit and Berk is back, I  
would like to draw some attention to below message of mine I sent a

I would be glad to try it on linux. I assume I need to apply all the 3 
patches to the latest CVS checkout - correct?

Hi hope it works with a current checkout... Otherwise you might try to  
apply the patches on a checkout with a date in mid-July.

Yes, all three patches are necessary:

1. adds the vtkoggtheora library to VTK
2. adds the vtkOggTheoraWriter class to VTK
3. adds the whole machinery into ParaView

Hi Michael,

This thread has been sitting in my mailbox waiting for attention :-) I

No. I am afraid you need ParaView 3.6 for this to work. The binaries
are on the ParaView website.

I am afraid that you can't do that. I am curious, why use mmap instead
of letting the reader access the file directly?

Hello Wei,

I'm using the Integrate Filter to calculate area- and mass-averaged flow
values in planar polydata grids (boundary surfaces) of cfd-models.

It's important to convert point-data to cell-data previous to applying
the integrate variables filter. After applying this filter you receive
area averaged values of every cell-data. Therefore in my case you would
have to multiply the averaged value (for example averaged temperature)
with the although calculated area value to receive "proper" temperature
values.

I've never tried to apply the integrate filter on 3D volume data, but I
expect volume averaged results, therefore multiplying with the volume
value should give you more meaningful values.

Dear Tobias,

Many thanks for your help.

Do you think it is necessary to extract the sub-domain, on which I  
want to calculate average value, previous to using the integrate filter?

I am so sorry that I am still confused about the integrate filter. For  
example, I have a result, in which temperatures are in the range 20 ~  
39.5 degree C. After I apply the integrate filter, I got the  
temperature value is 0.00210551, which is so small. I multiply this  
value with the cell number, 23040, I got 48.5109504, which is beyond  
the range.

You did mention I have to multiply this averaged value with the  
calculated area value to produce proper values. I feel sorry that I  
don't truly understand this. In my example, the area/volume is very  
small. They are at the level 0.01/0.001. Therefore 0.00210551 times  
total area/volume cannot give a reasonable temperature either. I feel  
quite confused.

Many thanks in advance for your further help.

Regards, Wei

Subject: [Paraview] Bug in CMake Install code for the 3.6.1 Release on OS X
Message-ID: <DEDDACED-BE1A-43F8-BACB-9086EB73A024@bluequartz.net>

I have PV 3.6.1 from CVS and ran a "make install" and to my surprise I  
end up with "ParaView3.6.1.app in /Applications which is NOT where  
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is set to. The rest of ParaView seems to have  
been installed into CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX but not the actual  
Application Bundle. If this was intended behavior, what is the reason?  
I would have expected everything to show where I set the  
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to.
    What if I don't have write privileges to /Applications on my  
machine?

And, BTW, if you don't have write privileges to "/Applications" then you
should get some sort of error message when doing the "make install" -- let
us know if that's not the case.

Yes, it is intended, and has to do with the dual nature of the ParaView Mac
installation. (It's a bundle app, it's a unix command line tool, you
decide...)

Use:DESTDIR=blah make install

and it will end up in "$blah/Applications" instead of "/Applications"

If we put it where CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX points, it would end up in /usr/bin
or /usr/local/bin for most people and they would never find it. Not what
most people want...

If you use DESTDIR, the "/Applications" is prefixed with the DESTDIR value
so that you can put it wherever you want.

On the other hand, "make package" should work and give you a *.dmg file that
has the client app in it that you can drag-n-drop wherever you want, too.


HTH,
David

The easiest thing to do is to write a series of VTK files. For
example, they would be named particles0.vtk, particles1.vtk etc. Each
file would be something like the example below. If you do this, you
can open the file series (which would show up as a group in the file
browser) and press play to animate. The full documentation for the VTK
file format is at http://vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf

Subject: [Paraview] MultiblockDataSet Global IDs
Message-ID: <42808.35593.qm@web110116.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

how to correctly generate a Points Global IDs to a vtkMultiBlockDataSet ? The IDs must, of course, be unique. I tried to iterate through the blocks and attribute to each part a vtkIntArray with the IDs, but of course this does not work when the parts have points in common. 

Also, I'm specially interested in MultiBlock comming from Ensight files, and I discovered recently that the Ensight Reader does not associate the "true" number of points to each part. So the GetNumberOfPoints() method doesn't work in these cases.

How to achieve this ? I really need these Global IDs in order to uniquely identify each node of my model, to create a finite element preprocessor.

Regards,
Rafael March.

Hi,

I am trying to make out how to display a set of 1 million spheres of the
same radius, knowing their xyz coordinates + a kind of intensity (varying
from 1 to 12), something like :

        1     0.000000     0.000000     0.000000  0.000000 12
        2    -1.732051     1.000000     0.000000  0.000000 10
        3    -1.732051    -1.000000     0.000000  0.000000  9
        4    -1.154701     0.000000     1.632993  1.000000  9
        5    -0.192450     1.666667     1.088662  1.000000 11

but I can't find a guide that explains how I should write my text file so
that paraview may understand it... if anyone has advices, that would be
super great !!

Thanks a lot,

Marc

Hi Rafael:

    If my guess is not wrong, I feel you want to obtain a set of unique
point ids for each block. Then the following segment of code might be ok.


int           numPtIds = 0;
vtkIdList * ptIdList = vtkIdList::New();
ptIdList->Allocate( 1000, 1000 ); // or better estimated sizes

vtkMultiBlockDataSet * multiBlock = ...;

for ( i = 0; i < multiBlock->GetNumberOfBlocks(); i ++ )
  {
  ptIdList->Reset();
  vtkDataSet * block = vtkDataSet::SafeDownCase(  multiBlock->GetBlock( i )
);

  for ( j = 0; j < block->GetNumberOfCells(); j ++ )
    {
    vtkCell   * cell = block->GetCell( j );
    vtkIdList * list = cell->GetPointIds();
    for ( k = 0; k < list->GetNumberOfIds(); k ++ )
      {
      vtkIdType globalPtId = list->GetId( k );
      if (  ptIdList->IsId( globalPtId )  ==  -1  )
        {
        ptIdList->InsertNextId( globalPtId );
        }
      }
    cell = NULL;
    list = NULL;
    }

  block = NULL;
  numPtIds = ptIdList->GetNumberOfIds();
  // now export the point ids stored in ptIdList and the number numPtIds

  }
ptIdList->Delete();
ptIdList = NULL;

What do  you mean by points in common?  Do you mean that they come from the
same vtkPoints or that they just share the same coordinate values (to within
tolerance at least)?

If you mean that they share the same coordinate values you can use the
vtkIncrementalOctreePointLocator to avoid duplicates.

If you mean that they come from the same vtkPointSet how about iterating
through the blocks and if the block is not a vtkPointSet then create their
global ids.  If the block is derived from vtkPointSet, then get the
vtkPoints.  If  you've already gone through this set of points then skip it
(you can store the pointer in a set to mark it as being examine), otherwise
go through and create your global ids for each point in vtkPoints and add
vtkPoints to the set. Of course this assumes that you do a shallow
copy/reference counting on the vtkPoints so that the pointer to multiple
copies of them are the same.

Subject: [Paraview] [PV-3.6.1] Problem compiling with Python in linux x86_64
Message-ID: <ef747b890908060939k1264ed68ucafde50eef950ace@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I'm trouble in compiling PV-3.6.1 in a linux x86_64 environment. The error
is:

Linking CXX shared library ../../../bin/libvtkPVPythonInterpretor.so
/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.1.2/../../../../x86_64-suse-linux/bin/ld:
/sw/shared/x86_64/Python/2.6.2/lib/libpython2.6.a(abstract.o): relocation
R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared
object; recompile with -fPIC
/sw/shared/x86_64/Python/2.6.2/lib/libpython2.6.a: could not read symbols:
Bad value

Ok, I already followed what the error message suggests and recompiled Python
2.6.2 as well as PV-3.6.1 with the -fPIC option with no luck. Thus, what's
the secret?

Thanks for any help

Ok, more information.

If I compile ParaView without Python and without MPI, it works beautifully.

Enabling MPI, however, causes the problem.. a GDB trace:


(gdb) run
Starting program: /viz/work/rhand/pvezviz/install-MPI/bin/paraview

Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
0x00000030fea6911c in _int_free () from /lib64/tls/libc.so.6

(gdb)

The MPI libraries I'm using:

 MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
/usr/local/ofed/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.8/lib64/libmpi.so;/usr/local/ofed/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.8/lib64/libopen-rte.so;/usr/local/ofed/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.8/lib64/libopen-pal.so;/usr/lib64/libdl.so;/usr/lib64/libnsl.so;/usr/lib64/libutil.so;/usr/lib64/libm.so;/usr/lib64/libdl.so

/usr/local/ofed/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.8/include
 MPI_LIBRARY
/usr/local/ofed/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.8/lib64/libmpi_cxx.so

Anyone see anything obviously wrong?

To answer your question directly, you could write out a csv file.  You could read that in and then run the Table To Points filter to get the particles you want.  After that, you could run the glyph filter to create the spheres or you could use the point sprite plugin to render them as spheres directly.

That said, if you really have a million spheres, are you sure you want to create ASCII data?  That would take a lot of time to load.  You might want to consider using a binary format instead.

Looking online, that is a nasty FPE, since it is a result of an integer
operation, not a floating point operation.

This is occuring at address NULL, which should not be possible.
#8  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()

It looks like a function at address 0 is being called.  Do you have more of
the trace, or is that the top?  If that is the top, can you see if this
function is being invoked from a different thread?

I'm not sure if a function is being called through a null pointer, or gdb is
reporting it for another reason.

Something bad is happening in free(), which has nothing to do with numerics,
but may have something to do with how your libraries are treating memory.

Apparently bt is supposed to give you the whole backtrace, but probably only
for that thread.  You can type:
info threads

to see if any other threads are running and try looking at their stack
traces.

Regards,

Juan

You may be able to try setting the environment variable:
MALLOC_CHECK_
to
2

and the program should abort on the first instance of heap corruption.

Hi,

Sorry, simple copy-paste error, fixed it manually in my build tree and  
then forgot about it ;-)

Please try the following patch, if it works I will update the patches  
on the bug-tracker.

Go to "View|Settings". Then in the "Render View" sub-option, uncheck
"Use offscreen rendering for screenshots". Does that resolve the
issue?

Subject: [Paraview] Animating vtp files
Message-ID: <229a1bad0908070703p70199fddwbc0a160347969514@mail.gmail.com>

I have dozens of result files in vtp format and the files are named
with a sequential number. I am interested in seeing how the results
changes over time.  How would I go about reading the files and
animating  in Paraview? I opened the filename..vtp and it displays the
first file  but I don't know how to get to the next file in this
structure.
How can I do this in the latest versions of Paraview ?
Any help is very welcome.
Thanks,
Alex
P.S. When I press the play button the slider moves but no animation is showed.

This sounded like an easy question until you said you pressed play and
nothing happened...
When you click "next frame" it is supposed to display the next file in the
sequence.

File -> Save Animation
should then save each step into a separate image file that you can then
concatenate into a video if necessary.

Can you provide a few of the files so we can see if we can reproduce the
behavior?

Thanks,

David

Pretty strange...

But the patch in itself should be self-explaining: just remove the  
VTKOGGTHEORA_ prefix from all VTKOGGTHEORA_USIZE16 variable names.

OK I managed to compile.
The movie is distorted (false colors).
I get a message like "disabling offscreen rendering because empty image 
was detected" or so.

Message-ID: <21f0b0400908070853qf5a7714i3b87c6f4c1f12141@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

It seems that the quality of rendering ( surface with edges) seems to quite
low with Version 3.6 compared to ParaView 3.4. Are there any settings that
needs to be tuned to get higher quality ( or atleast equal to  Verson 3.4 )

With with the surface rendering quite many artifacts are visible which were
not there in version 3.4.
Somehow I think version 3.4 was better.

thanks.

Can you post screenshots for surface rendering artifacts that you
mention? It would be great if you can post images for 3.4 and 3.6.

Thanks

Hi David,
Sorry for bothering you again. Are you just loading the  *1.vtp file,
aplying the glyph and pressing the play button ?
In case not, could you please tell me exact command
sequence/adjustment for generating the animation ?
I am really not a Paraview seasoned user.
Thanks,
Alex
P.S.  Regarding the another approach : File -> Save Animation
should then save each step into a separate image file that you can
then concatenate into a video if necessary.
Is there a way of automating the image saving at each time step (I
have dozens of sequential vtp files).

Alex,

Attached is a zip file with a bunch of vtp files. Try loading this
dataset. When opening the data file, select the root of the group i.e.
singleSphereAnimation_source93T..vtp
Hit "Apply" and then hit play. Doe you see the sphere changing?

In order to support depth peeling, paraview calls SetMultiSamples(0)
on the vtkRenderWindow.  On my computer with an nvidia graphics card
and linux driver, this kills antialiasing.  The only way to get
antialiasing for me is to recompile paraview with MultiSamples
enabled.

Subject: [Paraview] parallel run filter operate on plane source
Message-ID: <6dac95df0908071122t2b73cc86q44ae44f135e23bdb@mail.gmail.com>

Have some issue with a filter that operate on plane source when run with
more than a single process. Plane source on imput seem to be duplicated
identical on all processes (no problem), then my filter run and make a
shallow copy of the source and pass to output (problem start!). In the
spreadsheet view I see more points than I should in the output, + I add
point data I see more point data as well, I explore with spreadsheet view
show that unexpected point data all duplicate of expected.

My question, how paraview handle source duplicated on all process? How
paraview can know that the data is duplicate for plane source? How does it
render such duplicate data? I seek to add some point data to plane source
and provide on the output. What I need to do in the filter to avoid the
issue?

I didn't get any responses from this - would anyone mind responding
(negative responses are just as helpful as positive ones :) ) so I can put
this to rest or move forward, which ever the community vote turns out :).

Hi David,

Did you write this code as a VTK filter?  If not, could it be written
as a VTK filter?  Once you have that, you could add the filter to
paraview as a plugin.  Written as a plugin that conforms to
vtk/paraview style, the code will be very accessible to the paraview
community and you'll get a lot more feedback I'd bet.

Forgive my misconception before! I am baffelt by how this work!

I looked closer. I see plane source on my imput is empty! bounds 1 -1 ...
on all process except 0... so that answer something! before this I suppose
that the source must be duplicate on all process, because the class doc for
vtkPStreamTracer say thaat this must be so. Now I will like to know how does
filter such as distributed stream tracer work in this case (plane source is
empty on all imput except 0)? Web doc day seed points must be the same
across on all process? Can we explain how paraview works here?

I look more at how the distribute stream tracer work and learnt that it work
by setting: UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER() to 0 and UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES to 1.
Apparently this cause data from process 0 to be transfer across network to
other process. I make a guess here, is that correct?

   I am in the process of updating the fink
paraview packaging from 3.4.0 to 3.6.1, however
I have run into a issue that I am unsure how to
solve. Currently the new paraview plugins are
installed in a subdirectory in /sw/bin. I would
like to be able to redirect those to 
/sw/lib/paraview-3.6/plugins instead. Are there
any existing cmake options to do this in the

around this problem. Thanks in advance for any
advice.

Looking at the library references (otool -L), I see that e.g. bin/ 
libvtkRendering.pv3.7.dylib references QtGui.framework/Versions/4/ 
QtGui (that being the install-name of /Library/Frameworks/ 
QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGu). Howerver, why the linker isn't able  
to pick up this dependency isn't clear to me, because it's right  
there, on the default search path in /Library/Frameworks/ 
QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui.

Besides, shouldn't CMake figure out the transitive dependencies and  
add -framework QtGui (and friends) to the link line automagically?

What irritates me, is that the dashboard doesn't show anything  
(however, that one uses OS X 10.4): http://www.cdash.org/CDash/buildSummary.php?buildid=398013

Any idea what's going wrong here?

Subject: [Paraview] Linking against static builds of FFMPEG fails since cvs
 up -D'2009-07-31 16:52:02 CEST'
Message-ID: <4A7ECE14.40408@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone else noticed problems compiling ParaView from
CVS while setting -DVTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER:BOOL=ON and using static
builds of http://www.vtk.org/files/support/ffmpeg_source.tar.gz since
the commit with ID FWQft1X9tt8TgSXt that occurred between 2009/07/31
16:52:47 CEST and 16:53:52 CEST.

On both a openSuSE 11.1 (32 bit) and a Ubuntu 9.04 (64 bit) machine
linking against static FFMPEG libraries fails with:

> Linking CXX executable ../../../../../bin/QVTKCxxTests
> ../../../../../bin/libvtkIO.so.pv3.7: undefined reference to `avcodec_register_all'
> ../../../../../bin/libvtkIO.so.pv3.7: undefined reference to `avcodec_pix_fmt_to_codec_tag'
> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
> make[2]: *** [bin/QVTKCxxTests] Error 1
> make[1]: *** [VTK/GUISupport/Qt/Testing/Cxx/CMakeFiles/QVTKCxxTests.dir/all] Error 2

I obviously checked and my libavcodec.a does provide both symbols:

> nm libavcodec.a | egrep "avcodec_pix_fmt_to_codec_tag|avcodec_register_all"
> 00000000 T avcodec_register_all
> 00000000 T avcodec_pix_fmt_to_codec_tag

Linking against shared FFMPEG libraries works. But I prefer to link
ParaView against static FFMPEG libraries because of the outdated FFMPEG
version ParaView requires. Using shared libraries repeatedly raised
problems with other software that requires a recent version of FFMPEG.

Reverting the changes made with commitid FWQft1X9tt8TgSXt one by one
resolves the issue. But being aware of the intention of this commit
that's no solution, either.

I used gcc 4.3.3 and 4.3.4, Qt 4.5.2, cmake 2.6-patch 4, GNU make 3.81
and binutils 2.19.1.

Thanks for feedback.

Sven

Not sure what official version of Qt ParaView 3.8 is going to support.
My hope would be the current version (4.5). If they are still only
supporting 4.3 (which based on recent email traffic seems to be the
case) then you may be on your own to try and figure out what is wrong,
or at least "lead the way". I know I have to patch the ParaView tree
to get it to build against Qt 4.5 Cocoa and then do some manual file
copying after the packages are made.

I don't think this is true. Have a look at the following file (which  
currently is HEAD), starting from line 94:

You can edit Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml, search for
the property "MultiSamples" and set the default value to 1 instead of
0, then recompile.

Ok, I kind of tracked it down, although I couldn't solve it... Through  
bisection I found the following:

- Before the commit from Fri Jul 31 14:52:47 2009 "ENH: Applying patch  
transitive3.patch, see vtk-dev thread #Use LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  
for VTK libs" by Mathieu Malaterre vtkpython compiles just fine. This  
commit then causes the linking of the vtkParallel library to fail  
(looks like missing OpenGL libraries to me).

- All subsequent commits have the same problem, until...

- the commit from Fri Jul 31 19:25:31 2009 by David Partyka titled  
"COMP: link Parallel against opengl when rendering is enabled."  
introduces the linking failure described in my first message.

PS: Can't tell you guys how much I hate "describing" CVS commits...  
Last time I checked msysGit was pretty useable!

Linking vtkpython against vtkQtChart solves the problem for me.  
However, I'm not sure this is the proper thing to do...

Subject: [Paraview] VTK under ParaView
Message-ID: <4A7FEBD4.4070404@gmx.com>

Hello everyone,

I have Paraview3.4.0 compiled in my local folder, and now I need the
location of header and lib directory for VTK so that I can compile
another softw. that depends on it (Open Source mesh application engrid).

This software requires me to define VTKLIBDIR and VTKINCDIR for libs ans
headers of VTK. There are no such (or similar) env. variables currently
set in my shell.

Best regards,

Tomislav

Hi,

I found a possible cure. I'm not sure, though, about side effects it may
cause w.r.t. what has been the intention of the changes made with
commitid FWQft1X9tt8TgSXt, discussed in vtk-dev thread #Use
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES for VTK libs"
(http://www.vtk.org/pipermail/vtk-developers/2009-July/006180.html)

Given the changes Mathieu Malaterre made in VTK/IO/CMakeLists.txt with
revision 1.179 (introducing variable KIT_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES) and given that the
remaining changes in other CMakeLists.txt of this commit mainly are using
KIT_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES instead of KIT_LIBS I find it reasonable to believe that
the following patch is required in order to be able to compile ParaView using
static FFMPEG libraries:

Applying this patch, ParaView compiles smoothly. Whether one uses static
or shared FFMPEG libraries.

Hi,

ParaView comes with its own VTK sources. You can find in the source tree :
./Paraview3/VTK
The VTK binaries will be put in the ParaView binary tree : ./ParaViewBin/bin

Obviously, the paths depend on your calling way, and on your CMake settings

Hope that helps

I think that it should be an option in teh Settings menu, so that
people who don't care about depth-peeling can benefit from
multi-sampling.

Jack,

Attached is a patch that fixes the install dir. We plan to do some
installation cleanup for the next release which should fix this
problem.

You are almost correct. The keys don't cause the data to be transfered
from process 0, but it causes all processes to produce the full plane
data as if they were being run on a single processes. Trypically,
UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES corresponds to the number of processes, while
UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER corresponds to the process index. By setting them
to 1 and 0 respectively, we are telling the source that we want the
entire dataset, not a piece of it.

Hmmm, will have to try myself then.

On OS X 10.5 it works fine. See www.ifd.mavt.ethz.ch/people/wild/personal/files/damBreak.ogv

Junlin,

I am adding the ParaView mailing list to the recipients of this reply so that others may fill in the gaps in my knowledge.

Based on your description of SciNet, it should be straightforward to compile ParaView and set up the server.  There is information on how to do both on the ParaView Wiki (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView).

I don't know much about GIS in general and almost nothing about ArcGIS specifically, but the basic types of data are supported within ParaView.  I know that ParaView supports the loading of DEM files, which appears to be a common format for geographic data.  The surface terrain from elevation data is also a common question with a simple answer; it can be achieved by applying the "Clean to Grid" and then "Warp by Scalars" filters.

I hope that helps.

-Ken

Dear Dr. Moreland,

We are exploring the possibility of spatial analysis using SciNet supercomputer. This cluster is currently the most powerful computer in Canada and the 15th in the world.

SciNet is currently running AIX 5.3 on the TCS and CentOS 5.3 on the GPC. Moab+loadleveler on the TCS and moab+torque on the GPC.  IBM XL compilers on the TCS. Intel and gcc compilers on the GPC along with a couple of MPI releases (recommending intel mpi or openmpi).

We have some problems here with processing very large datasets because of the RAM and speed limit of desktop machine. SciNet supercomputer may provide a solution to this challenge. I notice ParaView has the capacity of parallel processing. Just wonder if it is capable to handle geographic information, such as surface interpolation from elevation point data. I guess you already use or know of ESRI ArcGIS. Is ArcGIS and ParaView data format convertible? We only need some basic function of GIS using ParaView for now. But we need to handle very large datasets.

Thanks for your time.

Subject: [Paraview] parallel run filter operate on plane source

Bam,

If you are interested in how ParaView performs parallel processing, you should really start by reading the documentation first.  You should look at Chapters 13 and 14 of The ParaView Guide (http://www.paraview.org/paraview/help/book.html) or at Chapter 3 of the SC08 tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SC08_ParaView_Tutorial).

Once you understand the high level concepts and are ready to experiment with parallel processing, don't use the plane source.  It is a terrible example of parallel processing.  Instead, try loading a file with "real" data that will actually be distributed amongst processes.  Try the bluntfin.vts file in the ParaView test data (http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/ParaViewData3.6.zip).

You are almost correct. The keys don't cause the data to be transfered
from process 0, but it causes all processes to produce the full plane
data as if they were being run on a single processes. Trypically,
UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES corresponds to the number of processes, while
UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER corresponds to the process index. By setting them
to 1 and 0 respectively, we are telling the source that we want the
entire dataset, not a piece of it.

Dave,

My implementation is simply a collection of ray/mesh intersections. There is
no attempt at modeling the waveform of the return that the hardware would
see - the output is simply a 3d coordinate along each ray. The idea is not
to simulate the scanner, but rather treat is a black box and get the point
cloud that would be at the output of the real scanning process. To simulate
the absorption, scattering, etc you would have to have a very detailed model
with these parameters available at each point - where I just work with
simple points and triangles.

I'm still looking into the VTK filter style implementation that Pat
recommended, when it gets to a reasonable state (which shouldn't be too
long, as it already uses mostly VTK classes) I'll post it so you can try it
out.

Thanks,

David

Yep, looks like the YUV planes are shifted, or something. But the  
first frame is fine. Very strange. Stupid thing is, I can't compile a  
64-bit version on my Mac, because the Qt-Carbon libraries are only ppc/ 
i386.

Subject: [Paraview] cannot display 3 component volume data
Message-ID: <4A8043D5.2080704@umassmed.edu>

I have created a 3 component image dataset (.vti format).  I am trying
to read it into paraview so that I can display it as a red/green/blue image.
p. 42 of the ParaView Guide says that this should be possible (for 3 
component
images with unsigned chars for each of the 3 components).

Unfortunately, for some reason I can't even get ParaView to treat this
as a volume data set.  It reads in the data, but when I try to set it to
volume rendering  (Object Inspector->Display tab -> Style -> 
Interpolation -> Volume)
I get the message "cannot volume render since no point (or cell)
data available".   I am getting this message EVEN THOUGH the
"Information" tab of the Object Inspector  says

Type: Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid)
Number of Cells 10444840
Number of Points 10747904
Memory:  3.15e+01 MB
Data Arrays:
Name: i2idata
Data Type:  unsigned char
Data Ranges:  [0,255], [0,255], [0,255]

This all looks correct to me.
The extents and bounds are also correct.

So, why, if all this info looks correct, is it saying it doesn't
have any point data?

I did create the dataset with my own software, so it is possible
that something in the format is wrong; but it couldn't be very
wrong if all the display info looks fine.  I also use this software to
create 1 component signed short data volumes, and those work
fine (i.e., I can set the display style to "volume").

Alternatively (or maybe better) I would be happy reading in
3 images and using different colormaps on each one.  Can ParaView
handle multiple colormaps with the image volumes superimposed?
Or even in separate windows (I've tried fooling around with that but
it seems like it each colormap which gets presented is not independent
of the others, but not quite identical either; I can't interpret exactly
what it thinks it is doing)?

Thanks for any help.

  Larry

(I am using ParaView 3.4.0 on Fedora 11 64 bit system).

Subject: [Paraview] multiple time steps and particle tracing
Message-ID: <1e5109b00908100917t1cfb4f04qc263cf8ec4801a12@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to visualize blood flow through the aorta from MRI scans. I have
a series of .vti images with the velocity, each one a single time step. I
opened them in paraview as a composite data set, and paraview seems to have
loaded each time step correctly. I now need to use a temporalshiftscale to
set the correct time for each step, and then use a particle trace to
visualize the blood flow.

I'm having two problems: first of all, when I apply the temporalshiftscale,
I get the following error message:

 ERROR: In
/home/awiktor/Desktop/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 747

vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x153c960): No maximum number of pieces has been
set in the information for output port 0 on algorithm
vtkFileSeriesReader(0x1537e70).

I wasn't getting this error before when I was doing the same thing on the
same data set, but something must have changed.

Also, back when I wasn't getting this error message, I tried applying the
ParticleTracer filter, and got the following error message:

ERROR: In
/home/awiktor/Desktop/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 728 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x11e2a10): Input port 1 of algorithm
vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x5be0420) has 0 connections but is not optional.

Does anyone know what these errors mean, and how to fix them?

Finally, I assume that the difference between stream tracer and particle
tracer is that stream tracer operates on a single time step, whereas
particle tracer incorporates multiple time steps. Is that true? And if that
is the case, what does particle pathlines do?

Thanks,

Adam

 I see no logic for this in the plane source. So this is something that
happen behind the scene in pipeline execute? I guess it works like this: If
a source say by way of key "I produce piece 0 of 1" and he is run in
parallel if he is really piece n not 0 of m piece then RequestData is not
called on him? I this correct?

Thank you for the help! Appreciate much!

Hi
I just downloaded and installed paraview-3.6.1-Linux64-x86.tar.gz
I selected the root group of the file, pressed apply and pressed play
: no animation produced.
There are something I missed ?
Alex
P.S. When I select the root group of the *.vtp files and apply only
the first vtp file is showed in the tree.

Please don't look at the plane source as an example for parallel processing.  The plane source has no parallel processing.  The plane source is designed to output a small amount of geometry.  Trying to process this in parallel would just add overhead rather than provide any real benefit.  If you are going to look at anything, please look at components that are actually designed to work with distributed partitioned data.  Most of the sources are not designed this way because they typically generate small geometries.  Many of the readers are designed for parallel processing.

UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER corresponds to the process index. By setting them

Do not worry! I am not using it as an example of how to!

Rather I like to know how ParaView work in the case of the distribute stream
tracer, it's documnet say in effect - all seed must be the same on all
process. I try something like that my self, and find it do not work. I hope
you can still answer my last question. I won't use it in genral. I only try
to make sense of how distributed stream tracer works in paraview with a
plane source, and I spend already a day on it, I will like in the end to
have the correct understaning.

I am not sure what's the problem. I've attached a link with a screen
capture of opening a vtp file series.

Hi Utkarsh,
Thanks for the output.
Now I see the problem : Even if  I select the root file when opening,
the only file opened is the
*000.vtp. If I check the time caption in the Information tab : Index
and Value are blank.
Any suggestion for a solution would be helpful.
Alex
P.S. sorry for my ugly english (I am a non-native speaker).

Alex,

I am not sure how to resolve this. Do you think you can try to give me
a screencapture? I believe screentoaster.com supports linux as well.

I am confused, I thought you were using ParaView 3.6 after you
downloaded the latest binaries. The title bar still says it's ParaView
3.3. Are you sure you running the right executable?
ParaView 3.3 does not support loading a vtp file series.

HI Utkarsh
Please let me apologize. I made some confusion.
The animation now is working with version 3.6.
Thanks a lot for your help.

Hi David,
Our group is just starting to get into lidar scanning of forests so your
proposed contribution does sound very interesting to us. Just a few days
back we were discussing the idea of simulating a lidar scan of a detailed
polygonal model of a single tree. This idea is to understand from first
principles what lidar returns from such a complex target look like, and in
a controlled environment where we could play around with various parameters
and see what the effect on return data is. For that exercise we were
thinking of simulating just the direct 'first order' reflections. But
longer term we are very interested in full waveform lidar data. Would your
implementation allow simulation of this?
Having a lidar simulator in Paraview would make things very convenient for
us, but if there is no other support for this we may be keen to talk to you
about what you have implemented in C++.
Actually our first problem is to get / create detailed 3D polygonal models
of trees - right down to the individual leaves - gulp - this could keep us
busy for a while yet.

regards (or should that be "many happy returns"), Dave Pont

Subject: [Paraview] multiple time steps and particle tracing

I cannot replicate the first issue you are having with the temporal shift scale.  Perhaps it would help if you could post some example data.

John Biddiscombe would be better at answering questions about the particle tracer, but I believe your problem is that you have not connected a "source" input.  The particle tracer requires two inputs.  The first input (port 0) contains the mesh with the vector field data.  The second input (port 1, called the source) is a mesh used to inject particles.  At each time step, a particle located at each point in the source mesh will be injected into the particle tracer.

Hi,

I am trying to visualize blood flow through the aorta from MRI scans. I have a series of .vti images with the velocity, each one a single time step. I opened them in paraview as a composite data set, and paraview seems to have loaded each time step correctly. I now need to use a temporalshiftscale to set the correct time for each step, and then use a particle trace to visualize the blood flow.

I'm having two problems: first of all, when I apply the temporalshiftscale, I get the following error message:


ERROR: In /home/awiktor/Desktop/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 747

vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x153c960): No maximum number of pieces has been set in the information for output port 0 on algorithm vtkFileSeriesReader(0x1537e70).

I wasn't getting this error before when I was doing the same thing on the same data set, but something must have changed.

Also, back when I wasn't getting this error message, I tried applying the ParticleTracer filter, and got the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/awiktor/Desktop/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 728 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x11e2a10): Input port 1 of algorithm vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x5be0420) has 0 connections but is not optional.

Does anyone know what these errors mean, and how to fix them?

Finally, I assume that the difference between stream tracer and particle tracer is that stream tracer operates on a single time step, whereas particle tracer incorporates multiple time steps. Is that true? And if that is the case, what does particle pathlines do?

Thanks,

Adam

Message-ID: <200908110113.n7B1DeXU010248@haides.silverbrookresearch.com>

Hi,

I have just installed Paraview V3.6.1 on my WinXP x64 machine from the 
binaries. The installation appeared to complete successfully. When I try 
to launch Paraview I get the message "This application has failed to 
start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling 
the application may fix this problem." (see attached for the full message).

I have uninstalled and reinstalled Paraview and restarted my machine, 
still crashes.

My colleague has just installed V3.6.1 on his Vista x64 machine and that 
works fine.

If you need any further information let me know.

Regards,

The first error is nothing to do with time, check how you are reading 
the data, something is not right. but I cannot diagnose it from here.

The ParticleTracer requires an input vector field and a seed point 
input. Same as for the Streamtracer, the first error you mentioned is 
probably causing one input to be null (port 0 = vector field, port 1 = 
seed points).

Message-ID: <d7f4480f0908110548i333d5deaw7a6c80ce8a852191@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I currently have one linux node with four GPUs and a single 8 core CPU I'd
like to setup as a Paraview server. I am unsure how to go about setting
things up so that MPI assigns each pair of cores a different GPU, or if
problems would arise with the 2 core/1 GPU ratio. Could someone who has
experience with this issue give me some pointers regarding the setup?

This thread, for example, seems to imply that I would run multiple instances
of pvserver, somehow pointing each to a different GPU?

Thanks,
Christine

updating to the latest should work.

Hey,

Just subscribed to the list.

I got this error too and my WinXP 64bit is SP2.

I've read that one should upgrade to SP3. But what about if that is not an
option at this time?

I've noticed also that a fix is already available for the 32-bit version,
although I can't test that too.

Thanks in advance,
Carlos

Hi Sven,

This is not the right fix. The problem arose from the fact that the
ffmpeg libraries were listed in the wrong order in the CMake files. It
worked before because ffmpeg libraries were listed multiple times in
the link line. The recent changes fixed this but they also revealed
this bug. I committed a fix that simply reorders the ffmpeg libraries.

Having said that, you should not be linking a shared library against a
static library in the first place. It works right now because libvtkIO
is the only library that pulls ffmpeg in. If another library depended
on it, you would run into potential issues.

Best,

I committed a fix to this problem - which happened only with the Qt
binaries from Trolltech not if you built Qt from source. I believe
that this is a small problem with the way they are creating their

The integrate variables filter does not compute an average. It
integrates the variables over a surface/volume. To calculate a
(weighted) average, you have to divide by the area/volume. If the
result is still off, let me know - I can investigate if there is a
bug.

My guess is that there is a symbol conflict between something in
ParaView and OpenMPI 1.2.6. If switching to 1.3 does not fix the
problem, we'll have to resort to debugging this some other way.

Hi Larry,

This sounds like a potential bug. Can you send me a dataset so that I
can reproduce it?

Thanks,

I don't think there is a SP3 for 64bit XP but there is for the 32bit
version. That said, those of you who are having this problem can you
download the dependency walker and then open up the ParaView executable
inside of dpenedency walker and tell me if it reports anything that it can't
find.
http://www.dependencywalker.com/depends22_x64.zip

Another alternative is that you can run the 32 bit version of ParaView on
x64 Windows while we sort out this issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Fortran "binaries" = unformatted. Any chance to work?
Message-ID: <ef747b890908110734r1a30bd11xd4188dc5521f2ca@mail.gmail.com>

Just recovering a very old PV/Fortran issue.

Is there any chance (at any time in the future) to PV load an unformatted
Fortran file?

For those interested in a try, get this file (
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/fortran_ensight_test.f90),
compile in your favorite Fortran compiler and try to load in any PV version.

It's a minor (and very old) bug, but, in my limited understanding of C/C++,
it should not be that hard to fix (am I wrong?!)

*(ps.: ok, ok, I should fill out a bug report instead of sending it to the
list. The problem is that I always forget the link and the list is more
dynamic...)*

It just occurred to me that this really should be documented on the ParaView server set up Wiki page.  I added a couple of sections on using multiple GPUs per node and sharing GPUs on nodes.  I added an mpirun command based on our OpenMPI implementation, but I think other implementations use different syntax.  I would appreciate it if other users with experience in using multiple GPUs per node (that includes you, JB) go to the page add suggestions.  (In particular, could someone describe how to do it with MPICH?)

As you will notice from the start of the thread you link to, we use multiple GPUs on a single node (2 for us, but 4 for you).

The secret is to ensure in your case that mpi jobs
0,1 have Display:0
2,3 have Display:1
4,5 have Display:2
6,7 have Display:3

and then all will be well. you'll need a rather complicated mpirun -e blah blah command line.

Hi,

I currently have one linux node with four GPUs and a single 8 core CPU I'd like to setup as a Paraview server. I am unsure how to go about setting things up so that MPI assigns each pair of cores a different GPU, or if problems would arise with the 2 core/1 GPU ratio. Could someone who has experience with this issue give me some pointers regarding the setup?

This thread, for example, seems to imply that I would run multiple instances of pvserver, somehow pointing each to a different GPU?
 http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg00501.html

Thanks,
 Christine

Thanks for the thorough answer, that covers all the issues I had with setup.
I am sure others will find the details helpful as well.

An alternative to making a complex mpirun arguments is to supply a
machines.pvx file. That will let you assign displays to each process on the
server. See the ParaView guide p134. for details.

It sounds like Dave is volunteering to add the machines.pvx method to the Wiki page.  I personally don't even know how to set up a normal client/server connection with it.  It is not documented in the book.

Here is the code modified to fit into the vtk algorithm filter pipeline:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/VTK_List/vtkLidarScanner.zip<http://www.rpi.edu/%7Edoriad/VTK_List/vtkLidarScanner.zip>

and the dataset that the example works with:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/VTK_List/bunny.vtp<http://www.rpi.edu/%7Edoriad/VTK_List/bunny.vtp>

The test is Test/TestScanner.cpp

Please let me know if you have any comments / recommendations / additions
that should be made.

Thanks,

David

I'm currently waiting for the admins to Install OpenMPI1.3, but in the
meantime I recompiled and linked against Mesa (rather than the nvidia
drivers).

Tada, all works.  So there's definately some problem with NVidia Drivers +
OpenMPI1.2.x

We've had a number of problems with some of the newer nvidia drivers and some commercial software (crashes, mouse events getting lost, etc).

We hadn't any luck with any of the newer 185 driver series, but have a working configuration with the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-173.14.18 driver that behaves normally. You might try fiddling about with that too - it might not just be openmpi causing issues.

Subject: [Paraview] Installation failed on WinXP x64
Message-ID: <200908112319.n7BNJBqM010871@haides.silverbrookresearch.com>

I have WinXP x64 with SP2. You are correct - there is no SP3 for WinXP x64.

I have run the dependency walker and attached is the output (dw2.png). 
It looks like it can't find MSJAVA.DLL. I did not have Java installed on 
the machine so I installed it from www.java.com but that did not fix it.

Regards,
Glenn Horrocks

I don't think there is a SP3 for 64bit XP but there is for the 32bit
version. That said, those of you who are having this problem can you
download the dependency walker and then open up the ParaView executable
inside of dpenedency walker and tell me if it reports anything that it 
can't
find.
http://www.dependencywalker.com/depends22_x64.zip

Another alternative is that you can run the 32 bit version of ParaView on
x64 Windows while we sort out this issue.

Subject: [Paraview] problems compiling paraview cvs, osx, qt 4.5.2
Message-ID: <030C9A42-053B-4A99-826B-586D2C615EA5@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi

Updated my paraview installation yesterday and got the message that  
the current cvs version wants Qt 4.5. I installed Qt 4.5.2 (the pre- 
compiled binaries from the SDK) and tried to compile paraview.

Unfortunately I get following error message:

Linking CXX shared module ../../bin/libvtkViewsPython.so
[ 45%] Built target vtkViewsPython
[ 47%] Built target vtkQtChart
[ 47%] Built target QVTK
[ 47%] Built target QVTKWidgetPlugin
Linking CXX executable ../../../bin/vtkpython
ld: file not found: QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [bin/vtkpython] Error 1
make[1]: *** [VTK/Wrapping/Python/CMakeFiles/vtkpython.dir/all] Error 2

The QtGui library is where is should be, in /Library/Frameworks/ 
QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui. Why can't paraview find it? Why is  
it only showing part of the path, i.e. the "/Library/Frameworks/" is  
missing?


I used following settings:

cmake \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DVTK_DEBUG_LEAKS=ON \
-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
-DKWCommon_BUILD_TESTING=OFF \
-DPARAVIEW_TESTING_WITH_PYTHON=OFF \
-DVTK_USE_GEOVIS=OFF \
-DVTK_USE_INFOVIS=OFF \
-DVTK_USE_RPATH=ON \
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON \
-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/sw/lib/python2.5/config/libpython2.5.dylib \
-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/sw/bin/python2.5 \
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=/sw/include/python2.5 \
..


Thanks for any ideas/hints. Meanwhile I reverted to paraview 3.6.1,  
which compiles fine with qt 4.5.2 (although it wants 4.3).

Wondrous what a cvs update can do:

Try setting the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE (or something). Also, I found a few 
times that cvs update somehow break things while a clean checkout works 
fine.

Forgot to mention that the strange coloring of the "rotation-centre- 
cross" (or whatever it is called) is probably due the chroma-planes  
subsampling required by the theora encoder (I know, hate it too).

Hi Dominik,

Thanks. I just noticed that there was a CMakeLists.txt.r.1.92 file in my 
directory, indicating that I must have made a modification at some 
point. The cvs update did not overwrite this modified file. I tried a 
clean checkout and it compiled fine.

Dear Berk

 

well, basically we don't have a very clear idea of how paraview deals with "parallel rendering".
we could "ssh -X" to any of these machines and run "xclock" and the X windows does appear 
at the machine we are from.

on the other hand, while trying to start a "parallel pvserver", everything works fine until when 
a client (paraview) connects to the "parallel pvserver", and we get a window alerting us about 
"parallel rendering disabled"..

by following the thread in paraview mailing list, we got to know that to enable "parallel rendering",
each of the machine running the "parallel pvserver" should be able to generate a "window" to 
do the rendering work. now in order to do that, we are suppose to have xdm ran on startup.

that's where our question is, (because we are not very good at linux) how do we "startup" the xdm?
we do have a login screen in each of the machine.

tried setting the "usr/bin/env DISPLAY=localhost:0" while starting the "parallel pvserver", but still 
the window alert of "parallel rendering disabled" persist. (i guess it's because the "node 0" still can't 
open the window in each process's node.)

any diagnostic test for us to try out?

thanks

Hi there,

The same issue here (MSJAVA.DLL). Yesterday I've given Dave the .dwi file.
Let's see what he can find.

If one wants to use the 32bit version, will we be limited to 2GB RAM?

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Tiled Quadric Clustering
Message-ID: <69988708-9E90-464B-B2F8-499765B2975F@3DTOPO.com>


Greetings,

I have tiled my DEMs and saved them to VTK which I am opening into  
ParaView.

I then run the Delaunay2D filter to generate polygons from the point  
data.

I need to simplify the data using a quadric cluster algorithm (or  
similar). I am checking the "Use Feature Edges" option, but I am  
seeing gaps in the connecting tiles, see:

<http://3DTOPO.com/quadric_clustering.jpg>

In other words, the feature edges are not being completely honored.  
The data for the edge columns and rows are identical from one tile to  
the next.

Does anyone know a filter or setting that I can run to fix this? I  
need my tiles to be seamless, and I am really hoping that can use  
ParaView for the job. It is a beautiful program, I have the process  
automated with Python, and it seems so close to being exactly what I  
need.

I greatly appreciate any advice, tips or pointers.


Thank you,

Of course you still need the patches. The following command should  
update a (patched) CVS checkout, hopefully without any conflicts

cvs update -dARP

Michael

PS: explanation of the -dARP:

-d: also create directories that have been created remotely
-A: reset sticky tags
-R: update recursively
-P: Remove empty directories

CVS is a very strange thing...

I changed the scanner from using the vtkOBBTree to using John Biddiscombe's
new vtkModifiedBSPTree (
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkModifiedBSPTree.html). The speed
improvement is amazing! The scans are now 40-60x faster!!

The new code is here:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/VTK_List/vtkLidarScanner.zip<http://www.rpi.edu/%7Edoriad/VTK_List/vtkLidarScanner.zip>

Is there a vtk sandbox or something that I can work in instead of mailing
the file to the list each update? Do I need to email the devel list to get
access/code reviews/ etc?

@David Pont - please let me know if your group tries it out / has any
problems or questions

Thanks,

David

Dear Glenn,

I faced the exact same problem yesterday. It was, in my case, a mismatch
between the version of Msvcr90.dll deployed vs. version published through
the VC90 manifest. I solved it by changing the version number of the VC90
manifest. Here's how:
- look for the Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest file in your bin directory of
Paraview
- search for the "version" field
- change the version number. Mine is 9.0.21022.8
- save and retry...

Hope this will help. I found this tip on the net, but I am unable to
remember where...

Charles-Andr?

Message-ID: <FE6A60A54854A948B985B23275835AEB01DE4316@GLKMS2102.GREENLNK.NET>

Hello

 

My apologies if this has already been discussed (yes I am a newby).

It would be helpful if you can point me to those discussions.

 

Still use 3.4.0 will migrate shortly.

 

I've been asked to develop a simplified version of paraview call it
pv-lite 

This involves changing menu bar, toolbar and modifying a few filters.

The input data is always in the same format.  

 

I changed the menu bar from: [File] [Edit] {View] .. [Help] to something
like [(pv-lite)File] [(pv-lite)Edit] ... [(pv-lite)Help]

The toolbars of pvlite contain icons for Opening, Saving and Printing
and a few specific filters. Plus there is a icon with which the user can
switch to and from paraview proper.

 

All this can be achieved by modifying the class MainWindow as given in
ParaView-3.4.0\Applications\Client

 

An other way is using plugins aka the Autostart plugin. There is a trick
to get to the QMainWindow object. 

I think the use of plugins is preferred however due to the savestate in
MainWindow::~MainWindow() I do still require minor modifications to that
class.

 

I wonder if someone has achieved changing the look and feel of paraview
in a similar manner by purely using plugins. 

 

Regards

 

Niek

Ah yes, I did this same thing for the 32bit release. I will make the same
change to the 64 bit when I get a chance. Thanks for refreshing my memory!

You can also sign up for github and make a fork of the ParaView
repository that is located here:
http://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/tree/cvshead

Or create your own project external to paraview, github offers a nice
'download' button.  And some getting started guides-

Niek,

I am currently working exactly on this functionality: making it easier
to create custom applications based on ParaView. It's still under
development and hence hasn't been committed to CVS head and is bound
to change. However, I've attached a pdf documenting the current state
of the developers wiki page about the same. It's bound to change as it
matures, but this will help you get the picture.

Is Paraview moving to git? Or can git branches be merged into the cvs for
releases?

Thanks, I did a fresh checkout and applied the patches.
Compiles fine, the colors are finally OK.
Do note, the fourth patch still fails.
Let me know when it is in the CVS without pathes so I can test it out.
Good move!
best regards,
Dominik

I don't think there are plans to move paraview to git anytime in the
near future.

Git can export commits to a cvs checkout.  Also, paraview developers
who use git can easily pull commits from other people's git forks of
paraview.  Even though paraview is still cvs based you can take nearly
full advantage of git with paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] ClipFunction Property
Message-ID: <3E5BF8CF-0456-4597-8176-3CAB51225E2E@3dTopo.com>


Greetings,

I am trying to script ParaView's 3.6.1 clip class.

My script is something like:

connection = servermanager.Connect()
from paraview.simple import *
from paraview import servermanager

dataset = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames="myData.vtk")

plane = servermanager.implicit_functions.Plane()
plane.Normal = [1,0,0]
plane.Origin = [10.0,0.0,5.0]

clipper = servermanager.filters.Clip(Input=inputFile)

clipper.ClipFunction = plane

Which causes the error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
   File "/Users/kitware/ParaViewReleases/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3Bin/ 
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", line 197, in  
__setattr__
AttributeError: Attribute ClipFunction does not exist.  This class  
does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to  
typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.

All of the documentation I can find on servermanager.filters.Clip  
shows use of the ClipFunction property. I guess with 3.6.1 it no  
longer exists?

How do I set the plane without it? I don't see any plane property for  
servermanager.filters.Clip.

Can anyone point me to documentation for how to set the plane for the  
filter?

Hi,

There are some changes you need to make to get it to work.

from paraview.simple import * //use this to import the updated
ParaView-Python API

dataset = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKreader(FileNames="myData.vtk")
dataset.UpdatePipeline()

clipper = servermanager.filters.Clip(Input=dataset)

//you can use clipper.GetProperty('ClipType').Available to see the available
options. You should get a list like this:
//['Plane', 'Box, 'Sphere', 'Scalar']
//set the clip type to plane
clipper.ClipType = Plane

//to set the properties of the plane
clipper.ClipType.Origin = [10.0,0.0,5.0]
clipper.ClipType.Normal = [1,0,0]
clipper.UpdatePipeline()

-------------

There are more options available.. use dir(servermanager.filters.Clip) and
dir(servermanager.filters.Clip.ClipType). Plus, I believe the latest release
has a trace functionality where-by you can have written to Python script any
action you perform interactively, which can help get you find these things
out.

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <82719CF4D95FBE4FA20C49581A8525AE0276A763@hrfmail01.barf1.com>

Hi,

 

I've recently installed Paraview3.6.1 with OSMesa 7.4.4 on a linux based
workstation (64bit). However, when running python scripts to set up and
output jpg (or png) files using pvbatch with the
--use-offscreen-rendering flag, the scripts run perfectly with no error,
however the output picture is garbled. I've tried a fresh install of
both Paraview and OSMesa to double check my configuration and the
compilation runs through fine with no errors. I'm trying to use the
OSMesa libraries installed in a shared location across a network instead
of on my local machine - could this be the source of the problem? The
python scripts only use Paraview as serial (i.e no parallel server) and
output the pictures fine if the --use-offscreen-rendering flag is not
used (and the OpenGL visualisation window opens). 

 

Any help with this would be great as I'm pretty stumped.

 

Cheers,

 

Lucy

Thanks for your help Adriano!

Unfortunately, I get something different:

 >>> clipper.GetProperty('ClipType')
<paraview.servermanager.Plane object at 0x6e839b0>

> //set the clip type to plane
> clipper.ClipType = Plane

When I try that I get:

 >>> clipper.ClipType = Plane
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?

I also tried:

> //to set the properties of the plane
> clipper.ClipType.Origin = [10.0,0.0,5.0]
> clipper.ClipType.Normal = [1,0,0]


When I tried that I get:

 >>> clipper.ClipType.Origin = [10.0,0.0,5.0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'Origin'


I set my PYTHON path to point to the ParaView python functions:

export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/paraview-3.6.1-Darwin-i386/lib/ 
paraview-3.6/paraview/vtk:$PYTHONPATH


Is there anything else I need to import or set?

I figured it out - I just need to add quotes:

It is working great now, thank you very much for your help Adriano!

You need to append .Available to the end of the command, so:

clipper.GetProperty('ClipType').Available

Hope it helps.

Subject: [Paraview]   xdmf/hdf5 errors (?)
Message-ID: <FE6A60A54854A948B985B23275835AEB01DE44DC@GLKMS2102.GREENLNK.NET>

Hello
 
Is there a specific bug reporting site?
 
Test conducted on: XP Professional 5.1 Service Pack 2.0 dual core laptop
with 2G mem.
Paraview versions 3.4.0 and 3.6.1 both win32 both are downloaded release
versions.
 
A simple method of generating a xmf hdf5 files example is:
    start paraview
    select menu [Source]
    choose 'plane
    set X resolution to 10
    set Y resolution to 10
    press Apply
    select menu [File] [Save Data]
    set Files of type: Xdmf Data File (*.xmf)
    set File name: MyPlane
    press OK
 
On 3.4.0:
A window with messages and warnings does pop up.
Warning: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\Filtering\vtkDataSet.cxx, line 414
 vtkUnstructuredGrid (0E88A928): Point array TextureCoordinates with 1
components, has 242 tuples but there are only 121 points
See attached txt file
On 3.6.1 paraview crashes.
The result is two files MyPlane.xmf and MyPlane.h5
with for 3.6.1 MyPlane.xmf  empty.
 
Using either 3.4.0 or 3.61. to open MyPlane.xmf (as generated with
3.4.0)
I used 3.6.1: 
   sequence:
    select menu [File] [Open]
    set Files of type: Xdmf  Reader (*.xmf *.xdmf)
    browse to MyPlane.xmf and select and press ok
    press Apply
 
This results in an pop-up window with warning
Warning: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\Filtering\vtkDataSet.cxx, line 414 

vtkUnstructuredGrid (1049A0C0): Point array TextureCoordinates with 1
components, has 242 tuples but there are only 121 points

And a very colourful plane. 

 

Something must have gone wrong with writing and reading of the
TextureCoordinates on 3.4.0

Paraview 3.6.1 unfortunately crashes on writing. 

 

It would be interesting to see if other people have similar problems.

Message-ID: <E8E687BD-ED3C-4D56-B458-0A28E9EE3B14@gmail.com>

Attached a new set of patches to http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9281 
  (suffixed with '_updated'), which REPLACE the first three patches.

libtheora has been updated to version 1.1beta2, allowing for 4:4:4  
subsampling (i.e. no subsampling), resulting in higher quality (and,  
of course, larger size). The Subsampling property of  
vtkOggTheoraWriter and vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter controls whether  
4:2:0 or 4:4:4 mode is used. 4:2:2 is not implemented. However, this  
property is not exposed through the GUI so far. 4:4:4 has been chosen  
as the default.

One problem could be that old video players do not support the default  
4:4:4 subsampling. I did see problems with mplayer on OpenSUSE 10.3,  
where the chroma planes where simply offset and scaled, resulting in  
quite psychedelic effects. So we probably want that Subsampling  
property to be exposed in the GUI (or default back to 4:2:0, but that  
results in color bleeding).

Cheers

Michael

Hi Lucy,
   I'm pretty certain that we are doing what you want to do.  We are  
building  OSMesa 7.5 from source as we have had various problems with  
system supplied mesa versions...

Subject: [Paraview] How to get a smooth clipping at the boundary
Message-ID: <4A844354.2010809@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi,

I have a 2D data set with one scalar value. When I apply the "Warp by Scalar"
filter with default settings and then a clipping filter of type box with scale
settings being 1/1/0.3 and "inside out" checked I end up with a scenery with
nice hills, except at the boundary. There, the hills are chopped off pretty
ugly, exhibiting a lot of fringes. See the screenshot at
http://www.mathematik.tu-dortmund.de/lsiii/download/foo.png

Does anyone have an idea what filter to apply before clipping in order to
improve this, to get a cleaner clipping?

Data set can be downloaded here:
http://www.mathematik.tu-dortmund.de/lsiii/download/foo.vtu

Thanks a lot
Sven

Subject: [Paraview] LSDYNA support in 3.6.1
Message-ID: <811a1f290908130951y76805d6cy8385bf4bbba33cfa@mail.gmail.com>

I have another program that has supposedly generated an LSDYNA file
named *.k. ParaView 3.6.1 does recognize the file type as something it
thinks it can open but when I select the file and click "Open" from
the file dialog I get another window that asks me to specify the
reader to use and LSDYNA isn't in the list. Thoughts?

Thanks

The *.k files are input decks. The LSDyna reader in VTK really only  
reads output decks (named d3plot, d3plot1, ...). If those are present,  
it will read the input deck to obtain part names but does not read the  
input deck for geometry or boundary condition information.

Seems straightforward, in servermanager it was

My_rep.Color=[r, g, b]

But in simple, there is no Color attribute, and nothing obvious jumps out when I do dir(my_rep).

Thanks,

The property is now DiffuseColor.  There is also an AmbientColor
property, and then properties named Ambient and Diffuse to set the
intensities.

You might be able to solve the problem by clipping the geometry multiple times with planes instead of using the box.

Hi,

Does anyone have an idea what filter to apply before clipping in order to
improve this, to get a cleaner clipping?

Subject: [Paraview] Calculator filter
Message-ID: <4A8462F9.7090208@yahoo.de>

Dear all,

after some time with paraview I am quite impressed about its features.
However one thing I am not very happy with remains: I do an ipmort of a
dataset from CFD and afterwards create some slices or clips... Now I
realize there was a variable missing. I calculate it using the
calculator but afterwards the scalar is not available on all allredy
created parts. This means I have to re-create all slices,... using the
calculator filter as an input. I do not think this is very effective.
Are there reasons for this? Any workarounds? Plans to change this?

Regards BastiL

Hi,

Sorry if I am misunderstanding your question... but perhaps the
solution is to use paraviews Change input dialog.  You can right click
an object in the pipeline browser and select "Change input..."  This
way you can use the calculator as an input to your pre-existing
pipeline.

I am currently viewing labels of the points of a .vtp data set via the
Selection Inspector.  This however requires the manual selection of points.
I would prefer to just have all labels displayed automatically.  Is this
possible?

Try manually making a selection by id in the inspector of some id not in
data, then turning on invert selection.

The reason it isn't easier to do it is that most scientific datasets have
too many points and cells to display meaningully, or efficiently as text on
the client.

Message-ID: <4A847A69.2090605@u.washington.edu>

Dear Paraview users,

I have access to a Linux machine with 32 CPUs and 128 GB RAM, and would 
like to use it in full when running Paraview. The machine also has 
NVIDIA Quadro Plex GPUs.

Unfortunately, for some reason the Paraview v3.6 only uses one CPU when 
running. The build that I'm using was compiled on that 32 CPU machine 
and the pthreads library was used in the process (at least according to 
CMake).

Any ideas on what's going or suggestions how to make paraview use all 32 
CPUs?

Thank you for your help,

Brani

Hi,

The paraview gui only uses one CPU.  To use all 32 CPUs you have to
connect to a paraview server, and compile with mpi enabled.  Here is a
link to the wiki that details the server setup:

  http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView#Server_Setup

What kind of work are you going to use paraview for?  Keep in mind
that some tasks will actually be slower when using 32 CPUs.

Pat

Message-ID: <A8DD8C83-199D-45F8-9CF8-B10BF61F5BBB@gmail.com>

Hi all

In current CVS there seems to be a rendering problem with the  
crosshairs displayed at the rotation centre. Whenever the x-y plane is  
becoming close to normal to the view-vector (i.e. parallel to the  
camera-plane), these markers simply disappear. Funny thing is, they  
seem to be gradually "cut off" from left to right (or right to left,  
depending on which way x-y is tilted).

To illustrate the problem, I created a small animation which sweeps  
the camera from left to right: https://www.ifd.mavt.ethz.ch/people/wild/personal/files/sweep.mp4

- The first frame shows the partially cut-off crosshairs
- As the x-y plane becomes close to parallel with the view-plane, it  
completely disappears
- Towards the end, the crosshairs gradually appear again

I see this problem both on Mac OS X 10.5.7 and OpenSUSE 10.3.

Am I the only one with this issue?

Michael

Can you post your dataset for a test?

I have observed a similar problems with whole actors disappearing (the 
same way, as if gradually cut by something) for very small datasets. I 
suspect this may have to do with single precision accuracy somewhere.

It actually the data set you gave me for testing the Ogg/Theora stuff.  
I just noticed that this only happens with your data set (I do not  
have such small stuff normally ;-))

It really seems to be the size. If I scale with a factor of 35,  
everything is fine. All smaller integer scaling factors result in this  
effect (more pronounced the smaller the factor).

That's what I thought. PV and more specifically VTK probably hardcodes 
float representation. I once raised this issue with no resonance.
I think the single/double should be respected (visualization for 
micro/nano). Of course one can scale, but this slows things down for 
large transient datasets.

True, but you could write a small utility which directly operates on  
your output data and scales it there... Better than this very  
irritating behavior nothing.

Well I am outputing loads of stuff from a transient solver and I need 
the data files in real scale as it gets used in other solvers (or as 
starting condition for the same run some time later). I am occupying 
already too much space and storing a duplicate only for visualization is 
  ruled out. Are people not using VTK for large scale visualizations of 
micro/nano structures?

Hello Lucy,

just for your information. I'm encountering similar problems when using
paraview3.5 version compiled with OSMesa-support in pvpython mode.
Executing pvpython scripts fails if I try to save the pipeline result to
a .png od .jpeg file.

That's why I compiled a non-OSMesa version of paraview3.5 which I use in
parallel pvpython mode. I'm not sure what caused this behaviour of the
paraview version compiled with OSMesa support. Maybe the problem is
caused by a from environment setting running in script mode. If I use
the mentioned OSMesa paraview version in parallel GUI mode (client +
server) everything runs fine, even saving screen-shots to .png or .jpeg
file.

Maybe somebody knows a solution.

Regards Tobias

Hi Tobias, 

I've also encountered the same problem with 3.5 although with this
version I received a segmentation fault from my scripts if I tried to
output a picture or movie (avi using ffmpeg). This was the reason I
originally switched to 3.6.1 - to see if the situation improved. I've
had no problems with either version running the same scripts without the
--use-offscreen-rendering flag so I believe that the scripting
environment is okay using pvpython/pvbatch. 

I'm in the process of trying the latest version of OSMesa (7.5) but am
currently having issues getting it to compile on my system. Not sure if
this difficulty may be related to my problems.


Regards,

Lucy

scaling data while reading it only gets you that far, until what you are
looking for are not just Colorful Visualization, but quantitative data
analysis.

I have similar problems, on the other side of the number spectrum, with
astro-physics data. 10^50 numbers. We're now taking better advantage of
ParaView to calculate volumes, fluxes, etc. The units have better be
right, and it's easier to look at data in true scale.

I vote for no-scaling to get immediate feedback on quantitative data
analysis.

Correct, analysis is also a strong reason.
I would embrace the double precision (at option) for my micro-scale data.
So how do we go from here?
I once ago filed a request but it never got assigned.
I had some success in smuggling SetDataTypeToDouble into vtkThreshold 
once, but the subsequent cases went unnoticed. I have grown quite some 
collection of duplicate VTK filters that do nothing else but expose 
SetDataTypeToXXX to the user.

Message-ID: <4A85D132.2040706@itis.ethz.ch>

For a longer while I have been observing trash on the GUI input widgets. 
I enter numbers and the gadgets just go insane unreadable colors.

I have been attributing this to the outdated QT version PV is using.
But I see now the latest PV uses QT 4.5.x. But the problem is still 
there. What's the matter?

I have also seen this problem for quite a while on XP and also on Linux.  I wondered if it is just my video driver doing bad things.

If anyone can get a step by step example of this problem (input data file, display tab - translate X such and such, etc) that is totally repeatable, we will try to get it fixed.

Hi Brani,

See Render View/Server in the Options dialog under Edit -> Settings.
Look at the Remote Rendering Parameters.  You can choose between
rendering on the client or rendering by the server.  You can
optionally compile with mesa to do software rendering offscreen on the
server.

I have looked online extensively today, and I cannot find any
documentation on the PVD file format for paraview.

Where can I find a specification, or details about the file format so
that I can generate output from my program to this format?

How is it possible???

  double *bds = reader->GetOutput()->GetBounds();
  printf("%lf %lf %lf %lf\n", bds[0], bds[1], bds[2], bds[3]);

-> 0.000000 69.000000 0.000000 69.000000

  printf("point1[0]=%f point1[1]=%f point1[2]=%f\n", point1[0], point1[1], point1[2]);

-> point1[0]=58.196274 point1[1]=68.862898 point1[2]=0.000000

  if (integrator->ComputeNextStep(point1, point2, 0, delT.Interval, stepTaken, minStep, maxStep, this->MaximumError, error) != 0)
    break;
  printf("point2[0]=%f point2[1]=%f point2[2]=%f\n", point2[0], point2[1], point2[2]);

-> point2[0]=59.002164 point2[1]=69.454414 point2[2]=0.000000

 Using real timesteps in pvd files)

Hi,

Sorry about digging up a discussion held on as old as this February.

I've been also getting reports from the users of my reader, in which
strtod() is used as well, that the reader fails to work only when the
main ParaView application is compiled with Qt 4.5.x (the ParaView
versions include 3.6.1 and 3.7-cvs. I know that Qt 4.3 is the only
officially supported version for 3.6.1, but in reality many users try
to compile with Qt 4.5) and run under certain locales (de_DE, fr_FR,
etc) [1]. Besides, it is also reported that the problem always goes
away when I tell the users to run ParaView after setting LC_ALL=C.

After some digging around I found that this seems to come from a
behavior specific to Qt 4.5 [2]:

On Unix/Linux Qt is configured to use the system local settings by
default. This can cause a conflict when using POSIX functions, for
instance, when converting between data types such as floats and
strings, since the notation may differ between locales. To get around
this problem call the POSIX function setlocale(LC_NUMERIC,"C") right
after initializing QApplication or QCoreApplication to reset the
locale that is used for number formatting to "C"-locale.

which has not been in Qt 4.3/4.4 [3,4]. Hence, two possible solutions
that come to my mind are

1) Modify the reader to use the functions that are not affected by
locale settings, e.g. istream::operator<<(). Note that some readers
included in ParaView itself also has to be modified (e.g. the VRML
reader as reported in [1]) if this is the solution.

2) Ask the ParaView developers to modify ParaView as suggested by the
Qt 4.5 doc, at least for 3.7-cvs.

Do you have any ideas?

Thanks,
Takuya

Hi Fred:

    As JB suggested, please try using RK45, which employs an adaptive step
size that is insensitive to the velocity magnitude and hence is capable of
capturing accurate shape of the curve (flow line). Using RK4 (still adopting
a fixed step size) does not guarantee a sufficient / desired acurracy of
numerical integration (though certainly it is better than RK2) since it is
stil sensitive to the velocity magnitude.

    Recently we improved the flow line integration accuracy issue. For any
problems, please feel free to let us know.

    Thanks.

I'm new to paraview.
I installed paraview-2.4.4_6 on FreeBSD 8.0-beta2 SMP ia64.
I launch the server as:

% pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...

then I launch the client and get this error:

TZAV> pvclient

This probably means that tk wasn't installed properly.

I've tcl-8.4.19_3,1 and tk-8.4.19_2,2 installed.

Any advice?

Subject: [Paraview] make error when building ParaView 3.6
Message-ID: <371f2e490908170847v1b9a4308tc19afa0574f036d1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to build ParaView 3.6 on an Ubuntu machine (w/ Qt 4.5) but I'm
hitting an error when I run 'make'.  I'm doing the 'ccmake <path_to_source>'
and keeping the default configuration except setting number of processors to
8 (I have a Core i7) and turning on the PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON and
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI.  I try to turn off BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, but it keeps
switching itself back on (why??).  Anyway, it configures fine with just a
complaint about "Qt PHONON library not found", which I understand is just a
warning, not a show-stopper (right?).  But when I run 'make', it gets to
about 4% and then dies as follows:

I had a similar problem.  To get around it I had to build shared mpi
libraries (i.e. libmpich.so).

Any simpler suggestions anyone?

When you say "do have a login screen in each of the machine", what do
you mean? Is it a graphical one or a black window with a login prompt
at the top? If you have a graphical login screen, that means you are
running X (through xdm or some other display manager). If not, you
need to enable X on those machines. This may require installing it -
or not if it is already there - and turning it on. How to do that
depends on the Linux distribution. Once that's done, you should create
a user and make Linux login to that user automatically at boot time.
You will also have to make sure that the display is accessible. This
may require using something like the xhost command. I recommend
searching on the web for more information on setting up X.

Yes. paraview.org/Bug.

Utkarsh is working on cleaning up the Xdmf so he'll probably look at this soon.

Hi Berk,

I haven't got a solution to this as yet, I'm afraid. The OSMesa 7.4.4
was built from source as we don't have Mesa installed locally on our
hardware. 

I've also since tried to download and compile the latest version of Mesa
(7.5), however, I am unable to get it to compile. I'm waiting on one of
our systems guys to have a look as I think I may be missing libraries in
my local linux install (I get different errors on different
workstations). 
Considering that 7.4.4 complied however, I'm not sure if even getting it
compiled will solve my problem. But I'll keep you posted if I get any
further.

Do you have any suggestions? 

Thanks,

Lucy

Subject: [Paraview] make error when building ParaView 3.6

Thanks!  I tried that but it didn't make the error go away.

However... I did manage to get past the error eventually.  I (re)configured
mpich with CFLAGS="-fPIC" and reinstalled it.  Paraview was then able to
compile.  What's confusing is that I did this once before and it didn't fix
it, but now it does.  So I must've done something slightly different this
time around, but I have no idea what.  Weird...

So, on to the next bug (I'm hijacking my own thread here)...  When I try to
run the paraview app, I get the following message:
"paraview: symbol lookup error:
/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.5.0/lib/libQtWebKit.so.4: undefined symbol:
_ZN24QXmlStreamEntityResolver13resolveEntityERK7QStringS2_"

Any ideas?  I ran ldd on my paraview binary and didn't see any obvious
file/path conflicts.

Thanks for the help.

Hello,
My main concern is why does the integrator return 0 instead of OUT_OF_DOMAIN?

Hi Fred:
 
    As JB suggested, please try using RK45, which employs an adaptive step size that is insensitive to the velocity magnitude and hence is capable of capturing accurate shape of the curve (flow line). Using RK4 (still adopting a fixed step size) does not guarantee a sufficient / desired acurracy of numerical integration (though certainly it is better than RK2) since it is stil sensitive to the velocity magnitude.

 
    Recently we improved the flow line integration accuracy issue. For any problems, please feel free to let us know.
 
    Thanks.

I suggest you attach a debugger to the code and step through. Then you'll be able to answer your question. 

Since the velocity field of your data may be high, it is entirely possible that the computed next position is outside of the bounds. Perhaps reducing the step size will help. Try even Rk4.5 with adaptive steps, this may help if the velocity gradient at the edge of the domain is very large..


JB





How is it possible???

  double *bds = reader->GetOutput()->GetBounds();
  printf("%lf %lf %lf %lf\n", bds[0], bds[1], bds[2], bds[3]);

-> 0.000000 69.000000 0.000000 69.000000


  printf("point1[0]=%f point1[1]=%f point1[2]=%f\n", point1[0], point1[1], point1[2]);

-> point1[0]=58.196274 point1[1]=68.862898 point1[2]=0.000000

  if (integrator->ComputeNextStep(point1, point2, 0, delT.Interval, stepTaken, minStep, maxStep, this->MaximumError, error) != 0)

    break;
  printf("point2[0]=%f point2[1]=%f point2[2]=%f\n", point2[0], point2[1], point2[2]);

-> point2[0]=59.002164 point2[1]=69.454414 point2[2]=0.000000

Hi,

We are pleased to announce that we have completed the Japanese
translation of the SC08 tutorial and it is now tentatively available at
http://oshima.eng.niigata-u.ac.jp/SC08_tut121_ParaView_Handouts-jp.pdf
. We would like to thank the original authors for the permission about
the translation and providing the original LaTeX sources. The provided
LaTeX sources indeed helped us a lot to concentrate on the translation
itself without being bothered by formatting.

As promised, we would like to attach the document to the wiki. Am I
allowd to create an account for the wiki and attach it to 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SC08_ParaView_Tutorial
by myself? Or should I ask it to someone?

Dominik,

I don't recall ever seeing anything like what you describe, but the description is pretty vague.  You enter what in what GUI widget and what happens?  Can you send a list of instructions for replicating the problem?  Perhaps a screenshot of the bad results?

For a longer while I have been observing trash on the GUI input widgets.
I enter numbers and the gadgets just go insane unreadable colors.

I have been attributing this to the outdated QT version PV is using.
But I see now the latest PV uses QT 4.5.x. But the problem is still
there. What's the matter?

Huh?  I get over 100 emails from that list every week.  There is usually more activity on the VTK mailing list than the ParaView mailing list (according to markmail).

Is there a reason that you are using such an old version of ParaView?  Try downloading and installing the most recent version of ParaView (currently 3.6.1).

This probably means that tk wasn't installed properly.

I've tcl-8.4.19_3,1 and tk-8.4.19_2,2 installed.

Any advice?

Subject: [Paraview] make error when building ParaView 3.6
In-Reply-To: <3b6093ef0908170907q55b120e4tb92550a1eb4280f5@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C6B02524.C3A6%kmorel@sandia.gov>

ParaView forces a shared libs builds when PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON is on.  The reason is technical; Python cannot load ParaView's modules if they are built in static libraries.  Clearly the shared libs requirement is rolling into your MPI library.  I can think of three ways around the problem listed below from easiest to hardest.


 1.  Turn off Python.  Either this is feasible or it isn't.  You only really need Python if you are planning to use pvbatch or the programmable filter.  Any other use of Python runs on the client and you can download the binary or compile that separately with Python and without MPI.
 2.  Compile MPI with shared libraries.
 3.  Compile static libraries for Python.  I have not done this, but I understand that it is very hard.  As stated above, Python uses shared libraries to dynamically load modules.  You have to turn off this mechanism and decide at compile time which modules to include.

Any simpler suggestions anyone?

well.. the reason is that there is a FreeBSD port of paraview, which
is the easy way to install all dependencies. I'll see if the paraview
FreeBSD port maintainers could be persuaded to update their makefiles.

thanks for reply though.

Hi,
The problem is application-wide: whatever I enter in the widgets, e.g., 
numbers in filter properties (e.g. extractVOI, but REALLY not only 
there) very often (but not always!) I get trash, like really some random 
colors, usually confined to a few small boxes around edited areas. It 
looks a little like kind of trash you get from a buggy video driver, but 
I never get this with my own QT/VTK applications.
This is a little annoying as it sometimes makes the edited values 
completely unreadable.
I am sitting on Ubuntu 9.04 with an integrated video card (Thinkpad 
x60). I have not seen the problem on the same system but with an Nvidia 
card. But then again why don't I have this problem with my own QT 
applications/VTK? The only difference is I am using self compiled 
VTK-5.4.0, maybe the problem is here.
best regards,
Dominik

This is cool.  I cannot remember if you have to do anything special beyond request an account to modify the Wiki, but I took the liberty of uploading your translation on the Wiki and adding a link next to the one for the original document.

Thanks,

the translation and providing the original LaTeX sources. The provided
LaTeX sources indeed helped us a lot to concentrate on the translation
itself without being bothered by formatting.

As promised, we would like to attach the document to the wiki. Am I

Subject: [Paraview] Qt version ( was: gui trash )
In-Reply-To: <4A85D132.2040706@itis.ethz.ch>
Message-ID: <C6B08CD5.CC4%Thomas.Maxwell@nasa.gov>

I tried building ParaView 3.6.1 on Mac OSX with QT 4.5.2.   Cmake gave me a warning that this was not the supported version.   I then tried to load a plugin I built into the client I built (both with Qt 4.5) and it said this plugin uses an incompatible version of Qt.  So what version of ParaView uses Qt 4.5.x??

Thanks,
Tom

I have been attributing this to the outdated QT version PV is using.
But I see now the latest PV uses QT 4.5.x. But the problem is still
there. What's the matter?

You should be able to use Qt 4.5 with CVS ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] request for LOD actor behavior
Message-ID: <4A8B15D5.6030505@itis.ethz.ch>

LOD actor goes back to full representation on mouse release.
In ICEM_CFD it waits 2sec (or so so) so I can continue transformations 
in LOD mode without annoying delays. It is very smart of them and such 
feature should be added to VTK/PV.

Subject: [Paraview] multiple time steps and particle tracing
In-Reply-To: <1e5109b00908111336h22225853qeb17f6a17864d7ed@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C6B07C22.C3E5%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I can see the problem with the data set you sent.  I posted a bug report for it:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9435

I'm pretty sure that this bug is caused by a non-feature of ParaView that causes the data type of the input of a temporal shift scale (and some other temporal filters) to spontaneously convert to temporal data.  John B. is supposed to be working on that.  I have no idea what the eta is.

I still think the particle tracer does about what you are looking for.  I'm not really the right person to give advice here as I have limited experience with the filter (again John B is the expert), but if you only want to inject points at the first time step, you should be able to do that by setting the "Force Reinjection Every NSteps" parameter to something very large.

Hi John and Ken,

Paraview seems to read the data fine. If I just load the data and don't apply the temporal shift scale, I don't get any error messages as I go through the frames. As soon as I apply the temporal shift scale and try to change time points, though, I get the error.

I've attached three time points out of the twenty that I'm using (the number in the file name is the time in ms). I checked, and paraview still gives me the error when only using these three. What I do is open the "Velocity-..vti" in paraview. I then click apply, and everything is still fine. When I apply the temporal shift scale filter, I don't get a message right away, but as soon as I go to the next frame (or any other frame) I get the error I mentioned. Do you know what could be wrong?

Also, I'm not completely sure that particletracer is what I'm looking for. What I need is something that's basically the same as the streamtracer, but that would incorporate the differences in the velocity in each of the time points. It would place a seed and integrate like the streamtracer up to the next time step, but then use the velocities in the next frame to continue the integration. Is that what the particle tracer does? And if so, what do I use as the input for port 1?

Thanks for the help,

Adam

The first error is nothing to do with time, check how you are reading the data, something is not right. but I cannot diagnose it from here.


Also, back when I wasn't getting this error message, I tried applying the ParticleTracer filter, and got the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/awiktor/Desktop/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 728 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x11e2a10): Input port 1 of algorithm vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x5be0420) has 0 connections but is not optional.
The ParticleTracer requires an input vector field and a seed point input. Same as for the Streamtracer, the first error you mentioned is probably causing one input to be null (port 0 = vector field, port 1 = seed points).

I've got plugins working fine with paraview, but I cannot load them with
pvpython (pv3.7 CVS). Loading them without globals() gives no errors,
but they ain't visible. Loading them with globals() gives this error:

>>> LoadPlugin("MySMPlugin.so", remote='False', ns=globals())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File
"/local/apps/ParaView3Build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py",
line 530, in LoadPlugin
    servermanager.LoadPlugin(filename, remote)
  File
"/local/apps/ParaView3Build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py",
line 2083, in LoadPlugin
    plinfo = plm.LoadPlugin(filename, connection.ID, serverURI, remote)
TypeError: function takes exactly 1 argument (4 given)


looking at the source code of simple.py, it seems like globals() is
required, but should not be the second argument, but the third argument.
 is this a copy-and-paste error from LoadXML()?

def LoadPlugin(filename, remote=True, ns=None):
    """Loads a ParaView plugin and updates this module with new
constructors if any. If you loaded the simple module with from
paraview.simple import *, make sure to pass globals() as the second
arguments: LoadPlugin("myplugin", globals()) Otherwise, the new
functions will not appear in the global namespace."""

thanks for any tip

python gives me the following syntax error on all the systems I have
with python version less than 2.5, and python tracing is thus not
working on these systems.

Compiling
/workspace/jfavre/ParaView3Build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/smtrace.py
...
?File
"/workspace/jfavre/ParaView3Build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/smtrace.py",
line 6
???class trace_globals(): pass
???????????????????????^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Any workarounds?

TIA

Hi Jean,

Thanks for reporting the errors, fixed in cvs now.  Trace has not been
completely tested for python 2.4, so if you find any more errors
please send them my way!

Hi Jean,

Thanks for the report. I recently changed the "LoadPlugin" API as part
of the improvements for ParaView's plugin framework. Apparently, the
comments were not updated properly. Also there were some conflicts in
the new APIs I added. I just committed some fix and update the
comments. Could you update and give it another try. Sorry for the
inconvenience.

Message-ID: <33fb468c0908191411t7f95e350qb273e3cda2feac81@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to paraview.

I know that VTK has a module to visualize tensors (I have managed to do this
through MayaVi2) I am now trying to get access to this module through
paraview but I am unfamiliar with the set of steps one needs to follow in
order to get it done. I know that it can be done by writing to xml files...
I was wondering whether someone could help me with this by providing me a
list of steps I could follow?

Thank you so much.

Marcos

Dear Marcos,

You will be able to find the "HyperStreamlines.xml" to uncover the
Hyperstreamline VTK class in ParaView (you just have to load it in ParaView)
in ParaView bugtracker, bug with ID 0008424.

You might be interested in the discussion held there.

Best regards,

Pierre

Hello,

I have had the same problem a few weeks ago.
Here is what I did, but the code is not originally
mine. Bryn Lloyd did write it.
You will need cmake and a built-from-source ParaView.
Unpack the attached archive, create a separate build directory
and execute
ccmake /path/to/source/dir
then hit 'c' until you are prompted for the ParaView
include path. Supply it, hit 'c' some more times until
the generate option 'g' appears, execute this.
Then you can build via make normally.

Best regards,
    Thorsten

I had the same thing a week-or-so ago.  For me it was because I'd installed
Qt through 'synaptic' (on Ubuntu) and it wasn't a supported version.  So I
compiled/installed the latest Qt from source and the GLOB error went away.
So check your Qt.  Also, I think cmake leaves a log file that sometimes
sheds light on errors.  That's perhaps worth checking.

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView] " not a valid qt plugin"
Message-ID: <E16B3478CCEBBF4FBD82FDDDE6D9B17A0178DE59@GLKMS2109.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi All,
 
I have recieved the above error when trying to use an object from an
external source within the Reader.cxx. If anyone could point me in the
right direction to solve it that would be a great help.
 
I have included the header "VolumeData.h" and this compiles fine and the
plugin works. When I then try to include an instance of the object I get
the the error when i try to load the plugin using the plugin manager.
 
I am using VS2008, ParaView 3.4.0, CMake 2.6.4, qt 4.3.5, on XP.
 
Is this an issue with version or compilation issue? 
 
Cheers
 
Stuart

Subject: [Paraview] Suggested format for open unstructured CFD including
	surface geometry?
Message-ID: <1250797074.13194.1330837751@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all.

I'm interested in using ParaView  to view unstructured CFD solutions. 
I'm currently using a proprietary flow solver which outputs results in
FieldView-Unstructured format.  The nice thing about that format is that
it allows the inclusion of not just the solution grid, but also all the
boundary surface geometry.

However, I'm not crazy about being stuck with FieldView as my only
option, so I'd like to write a translator to output an equivalent
dataset in a more open format.  I've looked at CGNS, but it expects the
user to link to external CAD files to provide the surface geometry.  Is
there a recommended file format supported by VTK that is well-documented
which includes the capability to include the surface geometry as a
triangular surface mesh?  The geometric body definitions in my existing
FieldView-Unstructured files consist of triangular surface meshes, a la
FACET or STL, and in fact starts out as a FACET input into the flow
solver.

Another question is if ParaView allows such a surface to clip the mesh
such that it would be possible to view a coordinate plane, but only the
portion contained within one of the boundary surfaces?

Thank you.

Ensight is quite a common format. However I would be very interested in
having a Fieldview-Reader for Paraview...

It's possible but I would like to add this:

  - before the cvs version compiled ok (let's say one month ago)

  - after my recent co (I always do a full check out) it complained, before 
the GLOB error, that my QT version was 4.4 and now it wanted 4.5

  - i've updated (I'm using debian), the 4.5 is gone, but the GLOB still 
exists.

  so, something changed in between, the error is located in this bit of 
code:

IF(NOT Q_WS_MAC)
   FOREACH(qtlib ${QTLIBLIST})
     IF (NOT WIN32)
       #INSTALL(FILES ${QT_${qtlib}_LIBRARY_RELEASE} DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR})
       GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(QT_LIB_DIR_tmp ${QT_${qtlib}_LIBRARY_RELEASE} PATH)
       GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(QT_LIB_NAME_tmp ${QT_${qtlib}_LIBRARY_RELEASE} NAME)
       FILE(GLOB QT_LIB_LIST RELATIVE ${QT_LIB_DIR_tmp} "${QT_${qtlib}_LIBRARY_RELEASE}*")
       INSTALL(CODE "
MESSAGE(STATUS \"Installing \${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR}/${QT_LIB_NAME_tmp}\")
EXECUTE_PROCESS (WORKING_DIRECTORY ${QT_LIB_DIR_tmp}
                  COMMAND tar c ${QT_LIB_LIST}
                  COMMAND tar -xC \${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR})
         " COMPONENT Runtime)
     ELSE (NOT WIN32)
       GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(QT_DLL_PATH_tmp ${QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE} PATH)
       INSTALL(FILES ${QT_DLL_PATH_tmp}/${qtlib}4.dll DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR} COMPONENT Runtime)
     ENDIF (NOT WIN32)
   ENDFOREACH(qtlib)


  so, if someone would explain what this line of code does

       FILE(GLOB QT_LIB_LIST RELATIVE ${QT_LIB_DIR_tmp} "${QT_${qtlib}_LIBRARY_RELEASE}*")

  maybe I could trace the problem to the debian package?

  many thanks,

Try adding something like this before the GLOB:

 message("${qtlib} ${QT_LIB_DIR_tmp} ${QT_${qtlib}_LIBRARY_RELEASE}")

What do you get right before the error?

I believe that the GLOB is looking for all the libraries (maybe
libQtGUI.so, libQtGUI.so.4.5 etc.) for each Qt component.

nice. from this I could see I needed this package in my system:

  libqt4-opengl-dev

Hi Ken,

Thanks for figuring that out. Can you think of any way around this bug? The
only reason I needed the temporal shift scale filter was so that the
particle tracer knew the spacing between time steps (by default it's 1 sec,
but it should be 0.0275 sec).

Thanks again,

Adam

Hi Berk,

I don't think the problem is in the script or vtk file, because I have done many test.

I use a cluster type Beowulf with diskless via nfs. Only the master has disk-dur.
I see that the problem is nfs.
I tried to make the vtk file in a ramdisk but I have always the problem, sometime it run fine sometime not.

I had done a test without diskless, it run fine.
But I would like to install paraview on this cluster (32 PC with 4cpu each)
Somebody have a idea on what is the probleme ?
And how I can to solve my probleme ?

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards, 
Jona

Hi Jona,

If I were to make a guess, I would say that the file caching done by
the OS is why your script runs sometimes faster. I see a huge
difference in performance when loading a large file the second time in
ParaView. It is hard to say more without having the data and the
script.

Message-ID: <371f2e490908210704w3e8d2bfamb0dae7e4a72e35f5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using the latest CVS build of Paraview (on Ubuntu) and am getting some
errors when I try to do python scripting from the Python shell.  I start
ParaView and bring up the python shell, and type the simple command:

>>> reader=LegacyVTKReader()
As soon as I enter this command, the error console pops up saying:


ERROR: In
/home/battams/Builds/Paraview3/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkExecutive.cxx,
line 757

vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x253f0b0): Algorithm
vtkFileSeriesReader(0x2560aa0) returned failure for request: vtkInformation
(0xd1e190)

Debug: Off

Modified Time: 197255

Reference Count: 1

Registered Events: (none)

Request: REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT

ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1

FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0


It has a similar error for vtkPDataSetReader.  It then has the lines:


ERROR: In
/home/battams/Builds/Paraview3/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkSelfConnection.cxx,
line 147
vtkSelfConnection (0x14ef4f0): Failed to locate object with ID: 154

ERROR: In
/home/battams/Builds/Paraview3/ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMOutputPort.cxx,
line 293

vtkSMOutputPort (0x152f200): Missing data information.


And then some more output like the top part.


Now what seems odd to me is that it is complaining about errors in my build
directory, but I installed Paraview to /usr/local.  But the same error
persists, even if I actually remove the build directory before running
paraview.  But perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.  Regardless, I get
the above errors when python scripting.  Any ideas?


Also, in my CMakeOutput.log file I see the message:


Determining if glXGetProcAddressARB exists in GL/glx.h FALSE


...leading to an error...


/home/battams/Builds/Paraview3/ParaView3/VTK/Rendering/CheckglXGetProcAddressARB.cxx:
In function 'int main(int, char**)':
/home/battams/Builds/Paraview3/ParaView3/VTK/Rendering/CheckglXGetProcAddressARB.cxx:33:

make[1]: Leaving directory
`/home/battams/Builds/paraview-bin/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp'
make: *** [cmTryCompileExec/fast] Error 2


Is this related?  Or an entirely different problem?  (or not a problem at
all?)


Thanks!

When you creating the readers using python shell from the GUI (not
pvpython or pvbatch), it's recommended that you set the FileName in
the constructor itself. So try:

> reader = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames="foo.vtk")

You could ignore it.  You get a bunch of warnings, but it still looks like the data is being generated correctly.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for figuring that out. Can you think of any way around this bug? The only reason I needed the temporal shift scale filter was so that the particle tracer knew the spacing between time steps (by default it's 1 sec, but it should be 0.0275 sec).

Thanks again,

Adam

I can see the problem with the data set you sent.  I posted a bug report for it:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9435

I'm pretty sure that this bug is caused by a non-feature of ParaView that causes the data type of the input of a temporal shift scale (and some other temporal filters) to spontaneously convert to temporal data.  John B. is supposed to be working on that.  I have no idea what the eta is.

I still think the particle tracer does about what you are looking for.  I'm not really the right person to give advice here as I have limited experience with the filter (again John B is the expert), but if you only want to inject points at the first time step, you should be able to do that by setting the "Force Reinjection Every NSteps" parameter to something very large.

Hi John and Ken,

Paraview seems to read the data fine. If I just load the data and don't apply the temporal shift scale, I don't get any error messages as I go through the frames. As soon as I apply the temporal shift scale and try to change time points, though, I get the error.

I've attached three time points out of the twenty that I'm using (the number in the file name is the time in ms). I checked, and paraview still gives me the error when only using these three. What I do is open the "Velocity-..vti" in paraview. I then click apply, and everything is still fine. When I apply the temporal shift scale filter, I don't get a message right away, but as soon as I go to the next frame (or any other frame) I get the error I mentioned. Do you know what could be wrong?

Also, I'm not completely sure that particletracer is what I'm looking for. What I need is something that's basically the same as the streamtracer, but that would incorporate the differences in the velocity in each of the time points. It would place a seed and integrate like the streamtracer up to the next time step, but then use the velocities in the next frame to continue the integration. Is that what the particle tracer does? And if so, what do I use as the input for port 1?

Thanks for the help,

Adam

The first error is nothing to do with time, check how you are reading the data, something is not right. but I cannot diagnose it from here.


Also, back when I wasn't getting this error message, I tried applying the ParticleTracer filter, and got the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/awiktor/Desktop/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 728 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x11e2a10): Input port 1 of algorithm vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x5be0420) has 0 connections but is not optional.
The ParticleTracer requires an input vector field and a seed point input. Same as for the Streamtracer, the first error you mentioned is probably causing one input to be null (port 0 = vector field, port 1 = seed points).

Thanks!  That did it!

Next problem, along similar lines.  I want to simply volume render a vtk
file I have.  If I do everything from within the paraview app, it works
fine.  But if I try to do the following from the python shell (or pvpython)
it seg faults on me:

>>> reader=LegacyVTKReader(FileNames="/home/battams/model.vtk")
>>> Show(reader)
>>> SetDisplayProperties(reader,Representation='Volume')

Here's the error I get in my terminal:

ERROR: In
/home/battams/Builds/Paraview3/ParaView3/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper.cxx,
line 1467
vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper (0x7fc7b7368010): Cell Scalars not
supported
[3]    Segmentation fault            paraview

It looks to me like the problem is my model because of the "Cell scalars not
supported" message.  But I can load/view it fine if I just use the ParaView
GUI.

Apologies in advance if I'm making some sort of stupid beginner mistake...

Hi Karl,

The volume representation needs a set of valid scalars.  In the GUI,
the color-by scalars are automatically switched for you when you
change the representation combobox to Volume.  In python you'll need
to do something like this:

SetDisplayProperties(reader, ColorArrayName='SomeVariableName')

Where SomeVariableName is the scalar array you want to use for volume
rendering.  Try doing this before setting Representation='Volume'.

Karl,

I think you'll find that you still don't get the same results as in
the GUI.  The GUI also handles the creation of a default color lookup
table and opacity function when you switch to volume rendering.  Here
is some code to do the same in python.  It's a mix of paraview.simple
API and paraview.servermanager API... so the code isn't too pretty at
the moment...

In the following example, the scalar value 37 is set to an opacity
value of 0 and scalar value 270 is set to opacity value 0.8:

Wavelet()
rep = Show()
rep.ColorArrayName = "RTData"
rep.Representation = "Volume"

lut = CreateLookupTable()
lut.RGBPoints = [37, 1, 0, 0, 270, 0, 0, 1]
rep.LookupTable = lut

func = servermanager.ProxyManager().NewProxy("piecewise_functions",
"PiecewiseFunction")
func.GetProperty("Points").SetElements4(37, 0, 270, 0.8)
func.UpdateVTKObjects()
rep.ScalarOpacityFunction = func

Render()

Thanks Ken, that got everything working. One more question, though. I'm
wondering what the Particle pathlines filter does. I saw in a tutorial that
it connects to the particle tracer. Does it create path lines similar to
streamtracer? What do the various properties do? And what are output-0 and
output-1?

Thank you very much for all your help!

That's the basic idea.  It takes as input a group of particles and, as it gets executed for new time steps through an animation, builds a trail behind them.  The output of the particle tracer makes for good input to the particle pathlines filter.

Output-0 is the pathlines themselves.  Output-1 is the particles used for the paths.  It is a bit like a pass-through of the input, except that if the filter masks any points it will also mask them on this output.  In the next release of ParaView, these outputs will have names that actually represent what geometry is output on each port.

I'm pretty sure that this bug is caused by a non-feature of ParaView that causes the data type of the input of a temporal shift scale (and some other temporal filters) to spontaneously convert to temporal data.  John B. is supposed to be working on that.  I have no idea what the eta is.

I still think the particle tracer does about what you are looking for.  I'm not really the right person to give advice here as I have limited experience with the filter (again John B is the expert), but if you only want to inject points at the first time step, you should be able to do that by setting the "Force Reinjection Every NSteps" parameter to something very large.

Paraview seems to read the data fine. If I just load the data and don't apply the temporal shift scale, I don't get any error messages as I go through the frames. As soon as I apply the temporal shift scale and try to change time points, though, I get the error.

I've attached three time points out of the twenty that I'm using (the number in the file name is the time in ms). I checked, and paraview still gives me the error when only using these three.

The first error is nothing to do with time, check how you are reading the data, something is not right. but I cannot diagnose it from here.


Also, back when I wasn't getting this error message, I tried applying the ParticleTracer filter, and got the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/awiktor/Desktop/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 728 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x11e2a10): Input port 1 of algorithm vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x5be0420) has 0 connections but is not optional.
The ParticleTracer requires an input vector field and a seed point input. Same as for the Streamtracer, the first error you mentioned is probably causing one input to be null (port 0 = vector field, port 1 = seed points).

Yes it helps since I understood there is no bug here, although I still think it would be more useful for users to be able to detect when the integration has gone out of the domain, so as to stop integration one step earlier.

My main concern is why does the integrator return 0
instead of OUT_OF_DOMAIN?




Because the (current position inside domain + computed velocity * time)
is returned - this final result is out of domain as you noticed, but
until you pass that new position value back in and ask for the next
point, it doesn't check that the value is in/out.



It checks that the start point, and all intermediate computed points
are inside the domain, but if the final result pops out - then it means
that the final step was too big (or the data was a bit rubbish -
typically when every Nth time step is saved - the courant condition is
no longer satisfied etc etc).



does that help?

  Hi Fred:
   
      As JB suggested, please try using RK45, which employs an
adaptive step size that is insensitive to the velocity magnitude and
hence is capable of capturing accurate shape of the curve (flow line).
Using RK4 (still adopting a fixed step size) does not guarantee a
sufficient / desired acurracy of numerical integration (though
certainly it is better than RK2) since it is stil sensitive to the
velocity magnitude.
   
      Recently we improved the flow line integration accuracy
issue. For any problems, please feel free to let us know.
   
      Thanks.

Then you'll be able to answer your question. 

    

Since the velocity field of your data may be high, it is entirely
possible that the computed next position is outside of the bounds.
Perhaps reducing the step size will help. Try even Rk4.5 with adaptive
steps, this may help if the velocity gradient at the edge of the domain
is very large..

      How is it possible???

      

  double *bds = reader->GetOutput()->GetBounds();

  printf("%lf %lf %lf %lf\n", bds[0], bds[1], bds[2], bds[3]);

      

-> 0.000000 69.000000 0.000000 69.000000

      

  printf("point1[0]=%f point1[1]=%f point1[2]=%f\n", point1[0],
point1[1], point1[2]);

      

-> point1[0]=58.196274 point1[1]=68.862898 point1[2]=0.000000

      

  if (integrator->ComputeNextStep(point1, point2, 0, delT.Interval,
stepTaken, minStep, maxStep, this->MaximumError, error) != 0)

    break;

  printf("point2[0]=%f point2[1]=%f point2[2]=%f\n", point2[0],
point2[1], point2[2]);

      

-> point2[0]=59.002164 point2[1]=69.454414 point2[2]=0.000000

Hi all,
I am new to ParaView (and this mailing list) and I'm interested in the
ability to automate Paraview operations with python scripts. I noticed in
the online documentation that the "Record Test" function should allow one to
produce XML or python scripts for a recorded set of actions performed in the
GUI. However, in my installation, I only have the option of recording XML,
it appears. Does anyone know if the python recording capability is
implemented, or is it still on the way? Thanks,

Jon

Hi Jon,

Where did you install paraview from, and what version is it?  If you
go to Help --> About, there should be a box called Client Information
that will tell you if embedded python and python testing is enabled or
not.  Some versions of paraview are built without python, maybe yours
falls into this category.

This is by deliberate action of the company that makes FieldView,
"Intelligent Light."  The documentation for the FieldView file formats
is part of the overall documentation set which is expressly distributed
under an "End User License Agreement" that forbids the dissemination of
covered materials to non-licensees.  They believe that making their file
formats open gives their competition an advantage.  I can't say that I
even remotely agree with this (EnSight andTecplot, are just a couple of
counterexamples), but they are probably not going to change their minds
until their licensed users get upset and organized about lobbying them
on this issue.  This is why I'm interested in writing a translator for
my own use, so I'm not forever stuck with only one
visualization/post-processing tool for my datasets.

So the consensus is that I should target the EnSight file format?  I'm
looking at their documentation now...

Hi Jon,

Yes, in fact there is a new feature in paraview called python trace
that generates python scripts using the paraview python api (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting )  In order to get
this feature you need to checkout the current development version of
paraview from cvs.  Paraview doesn't come with makefiles, instead we
use CMake to generate makefiles.  Instructions can be found here
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install .

Python trace is still a very new feature, but it works well for many
basic tasks. It won't handle everything though.  Instructions for
using trace can be found on this page
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools .

When you reply remember to cc the paraview list too.

This is something I assumed they were doing, but with the limited experience
I have using FieldView I was never sure. As you said, Tecplot and Ensight
appear to do well enough with their open formats, and if I'm correct are
cheaper per licence too. (On a side note, having used them both extensively
and realise their individual merits, I believe ParaView is at least as
capable as them both, but with more potential.)

I didn't realise that there already existed a converter in OpenFOAM to
FieldView format. I'll take a look and keep you posted, but it may be a week
or so before I get round to working on it.

Adriano

p.s. Ensight Gold is a solid format from my own experience and most packages
can handle it.

This is by deliberate action of the company that makes FieldView,
"Intelligent Light."  The documentation for the FieldView file formats is
part of the overall documentation set which is expressly distributed under
an "End User License Agreement" that forbids the dissemination of covered
materials to non-licensees.  They believe that making their file formats
open gives their competition an advantage.  I can't say that I even remotely
agree with this (EnSight andTecplot, are just a couple of counterexamples),
but they are probably not going to change their minds until their licensed
users get upset and organized about lobbying them on this issue.  This is
why I'm interested in writing a translator for my own use, so I'm not
forever stuck with only one visualization/post-processing tool for my
datasets.

So the consensus is that I should target the EnSight file format?  I'm
looking at their documentation now...

Subject: [Paraview] Qt problem on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <F9867705-5B73-4598-B18A-B5D0556DFFE3@gmail.com>

Hi all

With current ParaView-CVS and Qt 4.5 on Mac OS X I get the problem,  
that when I try to start the fixed-up ParaView bundle, the /Developer/ 
Applications/Qt/plugins/imageformats/libqgif.dylib plugin is loaded.  
Bad thing is, that one refers to QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui and  
QtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore, which then get loaded from / 
Library/Frameworks, resulting in ugly error messages and eventually  
the application crashes.

So far I tried to delete ~/.config/ParaView, adding /Developer/ 
Applications/Qt/plugins/imageformat to ParaView 3.7.0.app/Contents/ 
Libraries as is done for sqdlrivers, but still the plugin gets loaded  
from the system.

Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?

I think you can override the plugin search paths using a qt.conf file
but I don't remember exactly how to do it.  Here is some
documentation- http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qt-conf.html

Just put a blank qt.conf file in your package. This will force the Qt
app to NOT load and Qt plugins.

Works like a charm. I trust that Qt tries to load these plugins  
preemptively, and that they actually are never really used?

On a similar issue: Applications/Client/CreateBundle.sh.in copies the  
Qt SQL driver plugins into Contents/Libraries/sqldrivers, but  
shouldn't they go into Contents/Plugins/sqldrivers in order for the  
help-browser to find them?

Further, when "bundlizing" I always see the error message that  
libQtCLucene.dylib cannot be resolved. I noticed that this is because  
that library is located (pretty strangely) in /usr/lib, but that  
directory does not get passed to fixup_bundle(). Adding it to the list  
of directories passed to that function at the very bottom of  
Applications/Client/CompleteBundle.cmake.in resolves that.

Message-ID: <d7f4480f0908240826x3631b8bfq20ceae2370a07824@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have an existing HDF5 file (which I did not personally create so am not
familiar with other than the info I get from h5dump/h5ls) I'd like to read
in with Paraview. I'm first trying to create the most basic xmf file
possible which allows Paraview to read in the position array from the HDF5
file (based on the documentation here:
http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format). Right now whatever I
try either causes a segfault or reads in data nonsensically. Could anyone
point me in the right direction--e.g. based on the info below are my data
dimensions just off?--or to better documentation? Thanks in advance, it's
hopefully something simple I just missed from the documentation.

More information about the file and what I have tried is below.

*After reading a bit and playing around with the parameters, my current .xmf
attempt segfaults shortly after the server prints "Done Parsing." If I
change TopologyType to 3DSMesh it doesn't segfault but what it manages to
read in (only a single point) is nonsensical. Any of the other TopologyTypes
listed in the documentation I have found likewise produce a segfault. I also
tried various permutations of the Dimensions argument ("11254149 3", "3
11254149", "3751383 3", "3751383 3"*), *with each possible 3D Topology,
these likewise manage to read in either just a single point or segfault. I
didn't try modifying the precision argument as hd5ls tells me the position
array should be of doubles. This is my current attempt:*
*<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">

Format="HDF">examplefile.h5:/dark/position</DataItem>
      </Geometry>
    </Grid>

Christine,

I import HDF5 files into ParaView by first converting them to VTK (which
ParaView will natively read).  To do this I use the 'h5tovtk' converter that
is supplied as part of the 'h5utils' package (
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/H5utils).  This may or may not work
for you -- I seem to recall I had one h5 file that didn't want to
cooperate.  But for most of my data it's fine.

Hope this helps.
~~Karl

Subject: [Paraview] vtkDataObjectAlgorithm with multiple inputs
Message-ID: <c9adba420908240848l3acc4015nca2e273e6a44cc80@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am creating a filter that calculates the difference between all scalar
values for two inputs.  The filter assumes that both the inputs have the
sames number of points (and same block structure if multi-block).  I want to
work with both single and multi-block so I have subclassed
vtkDataObjectAlgorithm but when I just set the output as a DeepCopy of the
first input I just get an empty output with an "Unknown type".  Does anyone
know what I am doing wrong?

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Ken,

Thanks! That worked, I had only tried structured topologies which was my
mistake.

Cheers,
Christine

Hi Christine,

If you are reading in a position array and are unsure of the topology type,
you will probably want to read in the data with Polyvertex topology, which
is a group of unconnected points.

The Topology element must specify the number of elements to read.  In this
case, it would be the number of points = 3751383.

This is what I imagine your Xdmf file should look like:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">
  <Domain>
    <Grid>
      <Topology TopologyType="Polyvertex" Dimensions="3751383"/>
      <Geometry>
        <DataItem Dimensions="3751383 3" NumberType="Float" Precision="8"
Format="HDF">examplefile.h5:/dark/position</DataItem>
      </Geometry>
    </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Hi,

I have an existing HDF5 file (which I did not personally create so am not
familiar with other than the info I get from h5dump/h5ls) I'd like to read
in with Paraview. I'm first trying to create the most basic xmf file
possible which allows Paraview to read in the position array from the HDF5
file (based on the documentation here:
http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format). Right now whatever I
try either causes a segfault or reads in data nonsensically. Could anyone
point me in the right direction--e.g. based on the info below are my data
dimensions just off?--or to better documentation? Thanks in advance, it's
hopefully something simple I just missed from the documentation.

More information about the file and what I have tried is below.

*After reading a bit and playing around with the parameters, my current .xmf
attempt segfaults shortly after the server prints "Done Parsing." If I
change TopologyType to 3DSMesh it doesn't segfault but what it manages to
read in (only a single point) is nonsensical. Any of the other TopologyTypes
listed in the documentation I have found likewise produce a segfault. I also
tried various permutations of the Dimensions argument ("11254149 3", "3
11254149", "3751383 3", "3751383 3"), with each possible 3D Topology, these
likewise manage to read in either just a single point or segfault. I didn't
try modifying the precision argument as hd5ls tells me the position array
should be of doubles. This is my current attempt:

Christine,

You need to add dimensions to <Topology>. Something like :

        <Topology TopologyType="3DRectMesh" Dimensions="10 20 30" />
        <Geometry GeometryType="XYZ" >
          <DataItem Dimensions="11254149 3" NumberType="Float" 
Precision="8"
  Format="HDF">examplefile.h5:/dark/position</DataItem>
        </Geometry>

Obviously it's not 10x20x30 .....

Also, you'll want NumberType="Float" in the DataItem of the Geometry and 
GeometryType="XYZ" in Geometry.
Eventhough those are the default, it's still a good idea.

How did you implement RequestDataObject?
Did you set the keys:

vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME()
vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()
vtkDataObject::DATA_EXTENT_TYPE()

?

You might also consider subclassing vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm instead.  That should set up the output object the way you want (the same type as the input) for you.

Subject: [Paraview] distributed stream tracer scalability issue
Message-ID: <4A93293F.5080701@gmail.com>

We've been using the distributed stream tracer to generate 100s-1000s of 
stream lines per time step. It's very slow, and it doesn't scale at 
all.  The class comments say as much. I'm sure there is a reason why 
this implementation was chosen. Is there something that generally 
prevents real parallel implementation? Is there a better implementation 
available out there?

There is this post a while back

What's the status?

When you say slow, can you quantify that? Also, what is the size of the mesh
in the regions where you are generating the streamtraces? I ask purely
because I've always found streamtraces to take a long time regardless of the
application used.

I have had performance issues with the Distributed Stream tracer, but in 
fact I found that in general, the problem of it not being very well 
optimized for parallel operation was not the main trouble. If you are 
using Unstructured Grids, and they are large (in my case 20million cells 
in a block), then the main time was taken by the building of cell links 
which are used to FindCEll inwhich an integration point lies. I modified 
the stream tracer interpolation to use a BSP tree (or CellLocator) and 
found a huge improvement in execution time. (minutes instead of hours).

Secondly. the parallelization of the stream tracer is an inherent 
problem. One cannot integrate the streamline in block 2, until it has 
reached a boundary in block 1 - one must wait until the streamling 
traverses one block before passing it to the next. In actuality, the 
implementation could be improved with more intelligent seeding and 
rending/receiving of streamline seeds etc between iterations.

The Particle tracer code could be modifed to produce streamlines in a 
serial or distributed manner and ought to give a 'reasonably' optimal 
solution to the problem - but in fact the chaps at kitware are at the 
moment (they tell me) in the process of revamping the streamline code to 
make use of CellLocators - and for this reason I recently committed my 
BSP tree code.

Here's how to check your bottleneck.
Find a large StructuredGrid dataset which is loaded in parallel. 
Generate streamlines. Time it. Convert the grdi to UnstructuredGrid and 
do the same. If test 1 takes 1 minute and test 2 1 hour, then it isn't 
the parallization that's the real issue, but the grid being used.

Thanks, I have it working now.

I looked at the vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm and noticed the following in
RequestDataObject:

 if (!output || !output->IsA(input->GetClassName()))

{

vtkDataObject* newOutput = input->NewInstance();

newOutput->SetPipelineInformation(info);

* newOutput->Delete();*

this->GetOutputPortInformation(0)->Set(

vtkDataObject::DATA_EXTENT_TYPE(), *newOutput->GetExtentType()*);

}

Is there a reason why Delete is called before GetExtentType?  Or is this a
bug? (although it doesn't crash on me....)

Regards,
Paul

Hi Burlen,

The only reason I implemented it as it is was time constraint. It can
be made much scalable (hint hint ;-) ).

As for the issue with building links, we are working on incorporating
the BSP tree locator as an alternative to vtkPointSet::FindCell().
Thanks John for contributing it.

I am having a problem running paraview-3.6 and paraview-CVS on a tiled
display. There are large gaps (several 100s) of pixels between each
tile, no matter what the -tmx and -tmy options are set to.

ParaView 3.4 and EqualizerGraphics 0.9 work perfectly well on the same
cluster and tiled display setup, with no gaps between rows and columns.

Has some setting gotten lost in version 3.6 and above?

There was a paper at Super Computing last year (or maybe the year before)
about improved partitioning for stream tracing that would probably help
alot. Think of making a filter like D3 which moves data around to
repartition, such that the partitions take into account the principle flow
directions. That way particles stay resident much more often. The upfront
cost might be high to do the repartition, but afterwards stream tracing
would be faster.

Hi Jean,

I know of at least one change to the tile gap code, and that was this bugfix-

   http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7238

But this shouldn't be causing the problem.  I'll test to make sure and
let you know.

	issues
Message-ID: <20883570.398791251209335671.JavaMail.coremail@bj163app122.163.com>

Hi all:

    I got some questions when I visualized my datasets (data format is HDF5, using xdmf metadata file to organize). My datasets consist of 30 HDF5 data files, and all files stored in one directory. I wrote a xdmf file(.xmf) to organize these raw data. The .xmf file?s content as follows:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>

<Xdmf> 

 <Domain>

   <Grid Name="BX0" GridType="Uniform">

     <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions="50 80 800"/>

     <Geometry GeometryType="ORIGIN_DXDYDZ">

       <DataItem  Name="Origin" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">

        0 0 0

       </DataItem>

       <DataItem Name="Spacing" DataType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">

        1 1 1

       </DataItem>

      </Geometry>

      <Attribute Name="Scalar" Type="Scalar" Center="Node">

         <DataItem   Name="Points"   Dimensions="50 80 800"    Format="HDF">

            fields-10.000-0:/Fields/bx

         </DataItem>

     </Attribute>

   </Grid>

??# the other 29 Grids are the same with the first Grid, except the file name # and the coordinate parameters

</Domain>

</Xdmf>

The first question is: Should I use ?Data Collection? or other structures like ?Tree?, ?Subset? to organize the Grids? Does the organization of Grids affect the performance of vtkXdmfReader? I also want to know whether the class vtkXdmfReader read the raw HDF5 data in parallel when I run ParaView in parallel mode, and if reading is in parallel, how does it work in detail?

I run paraview on an cluster with 8 nodes, and I type the command ?mpirun ?np 8 ./pvserver? on the first node to start the server, which allocate each node one server process. Then I also start paraview on the first node using ?./paraview?, and connect to the server.

I have read << The ParaView Guide>>, and it says that when paraview run in the Client/Server mode, render server and data server will all run on the server end. But when running the Client/Server mode on my cluster, it seems that only the data server is distributed working on the 8 nodes and the render server does not work(only Collection but not sort last render). Here are some time logs recording the whole process.

Local Process

Still Render,  0.022987 seconds

    Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 1563,  0.019109 seconds

Still Render,  82.7161 seconds

??????# also the vtkContourFilter time

Execute vtkPVGeometryFilter id: 1729,  2.45381 seconds

Execute vtkMPIMoveData id: 1843,  61.2669 seconds

    Dataserver gathering to 0,  39.0038 seconds

    Dataserver sending to client,  22.2626 seconds

    Dataserver gathering to 0,  3.25879 seconds

 

Server, Process 2

?????????

?????????

Server, Process 7

??????

#the other Server process are same as process 1

 

From the time log, I only see the time record related to data server, but there are not render server. It seems that all render works are just done on the Local Process, and the other processes only take responsibility for raw data processing, producing geometry and transferring geometry to Local Process.

       In additional, I tried to run paraview in Client/Server mode respectively on 1 node, 4 nodes and 8 nodes. I found that the more I use the nodes, the longer the render time is. It depressed me seriously.

Do I run the Client/Server mode correctly? Why the performance continued to decline when more nodes joined to the server? Is it related to the ?Setting->Render View->Server->Remote Render Threshold?? But my data is large(about 4GB), and even I cancel this Threshold, there are no improvement for the render time. Could you tell me how to make paraview render in distributed parallel?

Thank you for your helpJ

SetPipelineInformation will cause the information object to increment the
reference count of the data object. Thus calling Delete will safely
decrement the reference count without yet releasing the memory (this matches
the reference created by NewInstance()). This is necessary or else a
reference will be floating and the object will never be deleted.

Hi Burlen:

    Have you tried the RK-45 integrator? It uses an adaptive step size and
hence in many cases makes streamline integration faster than the other two
modes (RK-2 and RK-4)? I agree with John in that the low performance
exhibited to us might be caused by 'other' (data-depenent) components than
the inherent integration part itself, e.g., point location and cell location
in an unstructured grid (which are cetainly also related to streamline
integration).

    Thanks.

Hi,

I understand there is a need to call Delete on the object but I don't
understand why it is called before the line that uses the object that has
just been deleted.  I.e. why isn't it:

this->GetOutputPortInformation(0)->Set(

vtkDataObject::DATA_EXTENT_TYPE(), *newOutput->GetExtentType()*);

*newOutput->Delete();*
*
*

instead of:


*newOutput->Delete();*

this->GetOutputPortInformation(0)->Set(

vtkDataObject::DATA_EXTENT_TYPE(), *newOutput->GetExtentType()*);


Am I missing something here?

Thanks,Paul

Since that call to Delete doesn't actually destroy anything (It just
decrements the object's reference count from 2 to 1) both are equivalent and
it is just a matter of preference. If you put it right there it is less
likely to be forgotten later. This happens for example when someone adds a
conditional return somewhere before the intended Delete.

Hi Zp,

Thanks for the hint, I hadn't expected that, and was using rk4.

Hi Berk,

Thanks for your help here.

By the way, I really meant for "slow" to read "time consuming". I am 
heartened by your comments, because I am really hoping to get a speed 
up, to make our application feasible! We need too many stream lines, 
that's really the issue.

Seems that the current DST implementation is a reasonable choice for 
generating a single stream or a set of streams with seeds that all 
originate in the same sub-domain/process, which is often the case. I 
wonder about the other cases, where many seeds are distributed over a 
number of  sub-domains. And perhaps as others suggest that its pretty 
good there as well.

For our use case we have a heavier work load, with better (but far from 
ideal) loading, and neighbor meta data that could be used. We hope the 
potential for a speed up is there, but I am convinced I need to do more 
homework on this before coming to that conclusion!

Thanks again,
Burlen

Hi John,

Thanks for the insight! We have image and rectilinear grids (current 
size is 512^3 not that big, but these are growing as we get more cpu 
hours), we use seed points from a plane  with a higher than grid 
resolution, which intersects a number of sub domains,. There is some 
potential to integrate in parallel. At this point I am not sure it will 
help (and after reading your and others comments less so). There is a 
big serial component to the algorithm, and load is imbalanced.

Great that you found some ways to boost the performance! Any speed up 
will be very helpful in this application.

Actually I wasn't clear in my original post, I didn't really mean so 
much that the DST was slow itself, but rather that it simply is taking 
too long for my application, which requires many many streamlines to be 
generated. My first tendency is to throw more processes at it in hopes 
of a speed up. but in reality that really hurts the DST performance.

   The choice of RK-45 might not be able to make a big difference for your
case if the bottleneck lies in other components of the whole pipeline.

Burlen,

OK, if you are using rectilinear grids and image data and it is too 
slow, then findCell is probably not the cause of your trouble, and using 
locators won't help much. A modified version of the particle tracer may 
well buy you something.
(Lets assume that your data is well balanced when loaded from disk, such 
that pieces are approximately equal on each core and the more cores, the 
better the loading).
The PT first classifies all seed points according to the bounds of the 
pieces of the input data and distributes the seeds according to the 
process they start in, then all processes integrate until all are 
terminated, or have left the domain.
When each process has reached stagnation/termination, it goes through a 
send/receive from it's neighbour processes (there is a BSP tree of 
bounding boxes generated on initialization) so that each process 
sends/receives only to/from where particles travel.
Each process then iterates again through it's new particle list and so on.

In your case, if the number of processes increases in such a way that 
the number of particles per block is scaling nicely (at least at start 
of integration), then you should see an improvement, because you don't 
have to wait for one process to complete before starting. The total time 
will still be dominated by the longest streamline + communication and 
waits, but there is some scope for optimization.

I haven't committed the latest PT code yet, so maybe if you want to try 
a customized version for your data you should contact me off list - 
particularly if you can adapt the loading of the data / pieces to suit 
the geometry of the seed points you are starting with (eg plane slices 
through the data would benefit from pieces which are orthogonal to the 
slices so that seeds become more distributed as core count increases - 
etc etc)...

is not in DS1, such as 0.25, ParaView will load the "closest" time value
available.  (I don't remember whether ParaView will round down to 0.0 or up
to 0.5.  Try it and find out.)

When you ask for a time value that does not exactly match one of the ones a
reader can produce, it is up to the reader to time to produce geometry at,
but it has to specify what it chose in its outputs time meta information

gstreamer would be highly preferred for Fedora as that is the default 
media abstraction layer on that platform.  ffmpeg is barred from Fedora 
due to patents.

Subject: [Paraview] building ParaView/OverView for Windows XP with MinGW
Message-ID: <4314f7000908260350h183cb76ar66f884cbd302467a@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to build ParaView, including the OverView informatics
client, for Windows XP using MinGW, based on these instructions:

    https://www.kitware.com/InfovisWiki/index.php/Building_OverView

The instructions worked flawlessly for Mac OS 10.5.x, but I am getting
stuck on the Windows build. I started with a binary installation of Qt
4.5.2, using Qt's MinGW, but that led to this error:

    sorry, unimplemented: use of `enumeral_type' in template type unification

That appears to be related to the older version of GCC contained in
the MinGW release provided by Qt. Installing a current MinGW, 5.1.4,
and building my own Qt libraries with it, solved that problem, but now
I'm getting stuck building the Xdmf libraries (see the output from
make, below).

I have successfully built Xdmf outside the ParaView source tree,
according the instructions here:

    http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Get_Xdmf

but as part of the ParaView build, libXdmf.dll will not build . Since
my external Xdmf build was successful, I figured maybe the ParaView
source for those modules was out of date, and I replaced ParaView3's
Xdmf and hdf5 source with the external source, but got the same
results.

Has anybody had recent success building OverView with MinGW? Thanks
for any tips,

Zak

Am I guessing right that XY Plots do not support double precision
numbers? I have CSV tables of numbers in the range e+48 e+49. the
paraview Spreadsheet view works fine, but the XY plot is empty. Too bad
I have to export the data and do the final visualization with another tool.

I am running a parallel pipeline, using IntegrateVariables to calculate
mass, volume, and other quantities in a region.

I find that when the region is changed (e.g. a threshold of an
iso-clip), IntegrateVariables does not update and recalculates.

Going to the Python shell and forcing an UpdatePipeline each time I
change the threshold is enough to get the correct value. Shouldn't this
update be automatic? I use paraview cvs version.

TIA

Do you know if the filter executes at all? I am wondering if the bug
is because the client is not pulling the results or because the filter
is not executing.

Adriano,

I use the EnSight Gold binary formats with PV for unstructured mesh, 3-D 
  solid models where the mesh deforms with time.  I actually put out two 
file sets: (1) a time=0.0 file set that contains the mesh, and node-sets 
and surface-facet-sets that are to be used with BC's, along with initial 
condition information, and (2) a transient results datum-set from the 
actual dynamic impact calculations.  In each case, I use the Ensight 
'part'-construct to place all of these in a single datum-set.  Each 
material domain (or in your case it could be mesh sub-domains of your 
choosing) is a separate EnSight "part."

The Extract Block filter can then be used to isolate just those parts 
you want to display/postprocess.

The time=0.0 file is used to check the mesh, BC's, and initial velocity 
fields when present -- a huge help in debugging a complex finite element 
model.

I have attached a Fortran-90 file that implements all of this.

Enjoy,

Sam Key

If the data and render servers are running on the same nodes, do you need to
run them separately? pvserver will be more efficient if you do not because
it uses pointer references instead of serialization over TCP between the
data processing and rendering algorithms.

As for your question, if you want the server to take part in rendering, it
needs either X11 or OSMesa in order to render. If you use OSMesa, use the
--use-offscreen-rendering argument on the server.

If the data is small enough that the client can render it all, you do not
need the renderserver part at all. In this case run pvserver with
--disable-composite or go to preferences->render view->server and uncheck
remote render threshold to prevent paraview from trying to do any rendering
on the server.

the filter is not executing at all. I have set up an animation of my
threshold. The Timer log shows no activity from vtkIntegrateAtttributes,
and when I do an explicit call to UpdatePipeline() in the python shell,
it takes a long time to return the result, which I believe means it is
not simply pulling the result from the server, but the server actually
goes ahead and does the full work.

N.B. I haven't tried with "simple" data. My data is a full AMR hierarchy
of blocks. And I run in parallel.

>The first question is: Should I use ??Data Collection?? or other structures
like ??Tree??, >??Subset?? to organize the Grids?

I recommend a collection for this. In Parallel, it _should_ work such that
each processor reads a different stripe of the contents of the collection
out of the HDF5 data. I think that a top level collection is required to
make the striping work and an implicit one like you have will not work (that
was the case last time I touched the reader a couple of years ago). I say
should because I think as of a few weeks ago there was a bug in the
vtkXDMFReader that made this not work properly.

If the filesystem has bandwidth to support the independent reads then
striping within a collection will be the fastest configuration possible.

 I run paraview on an cluster with 8 nodes, and I type the command ??mpirun

Whether the render server gets involved is configuration and data size
dependent. See the remote render threshold control under preferences. When
you are doing remote rendering make sure that the server has access to GL
(either GPU based or CPU based with OSMesa) and that X is not being
forwarded back to the client. mpirun -np N glxgears should pop up windows on
each server node for instance, and not multiple windows back on the client.

ParaView scales in terms of data size (Gustafsons law), not in terms of
speed (Ahmdahls law). That is, if the data is small enough to process on one
processor, adding more processors will probably slow it down. If the data is
too large for one processor, say because it requires swapping (or exceeds
memory entirely), then adding more processors makes it faster (or possible
at all).

Subject: [Paraview] building ParaView/OverView for Windows XP with MinGW

Everyone I know uses Visual Studio for Windows builds. You can get a basic
version of Visual C++ for free. I don't know of anyone else who is compiling
ParaView using MinGW, but perhaps there are some out there.

By any chance, is the filter visible on any views? If its visibility
is turned off everywhere, it will not execute (by design). If the
visibility is on, what type of view is it?

good catch. The filter was not visible. Once made visible, it updates
correctly.

the reason I did not make it visible is essentially because using a
spreadsheet view for a dataset with a single point is a big waste of
real estate. The "showing" label which allows selection of an active
source is by default the size of the longest string name from the full
list of sources, and does not resize when I select
"IntegrateAttriutes1". Since I have some very long names in the
filenames, I end up with a spreadsheet which has a minimal width of over
1200 pixels, no matter where I put it. Wasting too much screen space. I
was limiting myself to looking at the Information tab in the Object
Inspector.

Hmmm. Maybe there should be an option on the display page that's like
"Update even when invisible". You may want to add a feature request
for it.

Subject: [Paraview] animation + python
Message-ID: <OFB72D384B.2FAD051B-ONC125761F.0056E233-C125761F.00578146@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hi,

At the end of the python scripting wiki page 
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting), you give an example 
on how to create an animation via python.

However, this animation is not visible in the Animation View, and I did 
not find how to save the images to create a film. 
It is possible by using the AnimateReader, but it does not seem to be 
possible by using the scene.Play method.

Question : 
*Is the integration with the GUI a planned feature?
*How to dump the animation to images with the scene.Play method? 
*Should I add a feature request?

Best regards,
Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] Building ParaView with MPICH2 (Windows)
Message-ID: <35e9bc2c0908221740w49f57e38pfb3d0a9208b0703a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a problem to build ParaView under multi-core environment.
I think some settings in CMake are not correct, but maybe somethings else.

Compiling is finished correctly, it seems. I can start pvserver and
can connect from ParaView client.
I tested "Headsq" sample and images coming from multiple processes
cannot be merged correctly (screenshot is attached).
(The server and the client are running on the same machine)
(I set the parameters for "headsq" according tio the book "ParaView
Guide" P172-179)

Two VTK processes (pvserver.exe) are running because I specify below
to start pvserver:
mpiexec -localonly 2 C:\pvserver.exe
(Then, connecting from ParaView client on the same machine)

Does anybody have an idea or experience to fix this?

[OS]
Windows 2008 Server (32bit)

[CPU]
Opteron Quad-Core

[MPICH2]
1.0.8p1-win-ia32

[Qt]
2009.02.1 (Build from source files)

[CMake]
2.6

I'll list my settings in CMAKE below:
-----
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI    on
MPI_LIBRARY   lib\mpi.lib
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH   include

VTK_MPIRUN_EXE   mpiexec.exe
MPI_COMPILER   "NOTFOUND"
-----
Procs are specified "2".

I changed settings regarding  some times, but the result were the same.

[IDE]
Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition

Any help or idea is welcome.

Subject: [Paraview] Elevation representation of .CSV data
Message-ID: <31f0aa470908270743w5ed4fd11mcc7b1a1fed326336@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm a recent user of Paraview, and I'm using Paraview to represent a mesh by
means of the x, y, z coordinates contained in a CSV archive created using
Scilab. As shown in the enclosed image I could make the representation of
the mesh and, using the elevation filter, I could obtain a graphic
representation of the z coordinate values. However I had to set the scalar
range manually in order to obtain the correct range in the legend that can
be observed in the upper part of the image (as this range is set by default
as a range from 0 to 1). Also I have to set manually the lower and higher
point z coordinate (in the elevation widget) as its values is always set out
of the real range.

Could anybody tell me if there is a way to modify these values automatically
or recommend me better way to do this?

Thanks in advance,

David

Try using the calculator filter instead of the elevation filter. The
calculator expression will be simply "coordsz"

Some drivers require that the window not be obscurred. Try shrinking the
client window to make up enough screen real estate, then making sure that
both server windows are on top of the window manager (nothing is on top of
them).

If the rendering is correct in that case, then you need using offscreen
rendering.
Try using --offscreen-rendering on the pvserver command. If the hardware
supports it, this will work right away. If not, you need OSMesa on the
machine (pure software GL). After you have then condigure and compile
paraview from source to make it aware of it.

You could also try using the --disable-composite option on pvserver, which will force to send all of its geometry to the client.  This may be the best option of you want to take advantage of all the cores, but only have one GPU to render everything.

Hi,

Tom,

That's weird. I haven't run into this error before. Is your plugin
using multiple threads? Can you try putting a break point in
Qt/Core/pqOutputWindow.cxx in the methods: "onDisplayText",
"onDisplayWarningText", "onDisplayErrorText",
"onDisplayGenericWarningText" and check what is causing the error?

Hi all,

Does anyone know if there exists a parallel OBJ reader for ParaView? I know
that a VRML reader exists, but I have not seen nothing of the sorts for OBJ
files. Thanks for your answers.

Thanks for your answer. Now I tried to use the calculator filter but, even
knowing that the data array has the correct range (as I could check on the
information tab), I do not know why when I click on "Rescale to data range"
the range automatically sets from 0 to 1 (not from 0 to 10.51 as should be).
I tried to change the color by "cellnormals" and when using this it works
fine. Does it works in this way or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks in advance,

David

Color by should be RESULT or whatever name you've given to the array created
by the elevation filter. If the range is not automatically set (as soon as
you pick the array the first time, you shouldn't even have to rescale to
data range) to the min max of the RESULT array, it is a bug.

Can you send us the link error you are seeing? Which symbols are
missing? Or are you seeing the error when loading the plugin?

There is an OBJ reader in VTK which can be enabled in ParaView. It is
not parallel though - I don't think the OBJ format is really a
parallel format. Look at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Reader to see how you
can build a plugin to enable the OBJ reader. Alternatively, you can
add a feature request at http://uservoice.paraview.com.

Best,

Hi,

Is there any news on an easier way to build plugins against the official
releases? 4 months ago Berk mentioned those plans in a reply to a user
posting here.

The reason I'm asking is that I've been compiling the ParaView 3.6.1
sources over and over again in the last days on a variety of 64-bit
Linux machines (exactly the one listed on
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries, i.e. a Debian Lenny
5.0.1 with system gcc 4.3.2, system libc 2.6.26-1-amd64, system python
2.5.2 and a self-compiled Qt 4.3.5 open source and a self compiled CMake
2.6.4, freshly set up for exactly this purpose; but also on SuSE Linux
Enterprise 10 SP2, openSuSE 10.x, openSuSE 11.x, Ubuntu 8.10, Ubuntu
9.04, again everytime with Qt 4.3.5, cmake 2.6.4, gcc 4.3.2, python
2.5.2) to be able to compile my custom reader plugin against it.

The custom reader plugin works smoothly in all self-compiled binaries
(3.6.1, but also older and newer sources from CVS), but as soon as I try
to use that plugin with the official 3.6.1 binaries, ParaView segfaults.
Reason behind is that the official release contains in
lib/paraview-3.6/libvtkFiltering.so.pv3.6 the symbol
  _ZN19vtkUnstructuredGrid14InsertNextCellEixPx
but every time I compile the sources the method InsertNextCell in
VTK/Filtering/vtkUnstructuredGrid.cxx gets turned into a symbol slightly
differently named:
  _ZN19vtkUnstructuredGrid14InsertNextCellEixPx

On 32 bit Linux, I have been able to get a working custom reader plugin
for the official release.
On Mac, I get "not a valid qt plugin" upon loading the plugin into the
official binary. Compiling on Windows I haven't embarked on yet, but
given the success rate so far I'm reluctant to do so.

So, I'm wondering if there is no easier way to turn my little custom
reader into a plugin working with the official binaries.

Thank you
Sven

the answer lies in the source code of servermanager.py

Add these 5 lines to your code:

writer = servermanager.vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter()
writer.SetFileName("/tmp/foo.jpg")
writer.SetFrameRate(1)
writer.SetAnimationScene(scene.SMProxy)
writer.Save()

Hi Sven,

I think the binary releases could include the development files as there 
is a build option for this, I don't know if that's currently being done 
with the releases though.

your link errors may be because the released binary is built with 
VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS set OFF. While your local compile is built with it set 
ON. Try setting it to OFF. You can probably verify this with something 
like:
nm -C /my/path/libvtkFiltering.so | grep vtkUnstructuredGrid::InsertNextCell
if your version demangles to long and the binary version demangles to 
int then this is your issue.

Hi,

    I have installed the binary version of Paraview 3.6.1 (PPC)

    I'd like to develop a writer plugin.

    I am familiar with CMake.

    Is the binary installation version of Paraview sufficient for plugin 
development?

Regards

No.

To write plugins, you need the source code. You also need the intermediate
compilation files. To get those you need to build from source. When you
compile a plugin you point it at the resulting binary and it figures out
where the corresponding source is.

Finally, to use your plugin with binary paraview releases, the library
versions must match exactly (ABI compatibility). For that you need to build
your paraview with exactly the compiler and library versions listed on the
paraview binary build documentation for that platform.

Hi all:
  First thanks for David's help.
  When I run paraview, I find that paraview will report error if one process consume more than about 2.5GB memory. It says that "unable to allocate xxxxx 4 bytes float" or something else. There are 8GB memory on my computer. Is it caused by my OS? For my OS is 32-bit RHEL, are there some resolutions for this? Or I must change to 64-bit OS?
  Thanks for your help.

You need a 64 bit OS, and to use paraviews that was compiled with 64 bit libs.

Here is why. 32 bit OS's can never address more than 2^32 = 4 GB. In addition, the OS takes about 1 GB of that. So the max you can theoretically do on you system is 3. Furthermore, pararaview usually has to make some derived data to visualize the input, which can easily equal the input. Finally,  memory fragmentation means that for any program only pieces of the totak free space are allcatable.

Hi all:
  First thanks for Dave.Demarle's help.
  I use "mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver" to launch a server with four nodes, visualizing a 800*800*300 grid. It seems that each process consume too much memory. So I extend the number of nodes from 4 to 8 using "mpirun -np 8 ./pvserver" , but each process on 8 nodes server consume the same memory as 4 nodes server. The situation of 16 processes(16 nodes) is same as above.
   I thought that with the number of processes' growth, each process on server would share less raw data, so the quantity of memory each process consuming would decline. It proved that I was wrong. Could someone tell me the reason?

The problem may be the reader that you're using.  Some of the readers in VTK
are not parallel so even if you run multiple processes each process will
still try to load the entire dataset in that case.

Subject: [Paraview] Loading a Plugin from a Python-Script in 3.6.1
Message-ID: <87ws4kqqpz.fsf@workstation006.office.ice-sf.at>


Hi!

I'm trying to update a pvpython-script from 3.4 to 3.6.1

Amongst other things it should load a Plugin. The plugin loads
perfectly over the GUI, but when I try to do it from the script it
fails with this message:

  File "/home/bgschaid/Development/OpenFOAM/Python/PyFoam/PyFoam/Paraview/ServermanagerWrapper.py", line 41, in __init__
    servermanager.LoadPlugin(path.join(p,plug1))
  File "/home/openfoam/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-1.6/paraview-3.6.1/platforms/linux64Gcc/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", line 2094, in LoadPlugin
    if not parser.Parse(f.read()):
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

I tried replacing the call to servermanager.LoadPlugin with the
equivalent call in simple, but obviously this goes through the
servermanager and fails with the same message.

As far as I could tell from the servermanager.py the actual loading of
the Plugin fails before that and in that line it tries to interpret
the given file as an XML-File as a fallback.

The script fails on Linux and MacOS X. Calling LoadPlugin from the
Python-Shell in paraview also fails.

I noticed that the part about loading plugins is missing from
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Does this mean that it is currently not supported?

only two ways I found yet are

 - Going through paraview.vtk.vtkVersion.GetVersion() and determining
   from that number the paraview-version
 - Testing for the paraview.simple-library:

try:
        from paraview import simple
        paraViewPre36=False
except ImportError:
       paraViewPre36=True

Is there any other method that I have overlooked? I don't like either
of them because they are indirect and won't help me to find out about
later versions

the error message indicates that the second argument is missing. Please
try again using the following syntax:

LoadPlugin("yourlibname.so", ns=globals())

this is documented in the source code of
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py

def LoadPlugin(filename, ns=None):
    """Loads a ParaView plugin and updates this module with new constructors
    if any. If you loaded the simple module with from paraview.simple
import *,
    make sure to pass globals() as the second arguments:

    Otherwise, the new functions will not appear in the global namespace."""

Yeah. But not to LoadPlugin, but to the Parse-method of parser (which
is a vtkSMXMLParser-object). And that is a method that I'm not calling
myself.

    JMF> Please try again using the following syntax:

    JMF> LoadPlugin("yourlibname.so", ns=globals())

Gives the same error.

Good hint anyway, I'd probably have searched for the missing reader
once the above problem is solved ;)

I noticed those. But they are only defined in the "Python Shell" from
the GUI (to "3" and "5"). When I do

>>> from paraview import compatibility
>>> print compatibility.minor,compatibility.major

in pvpython I get the answer

None None

which isn't too helpful ;)

To obtain the version number, you can do something as follows:

>>> from paraview.simple import *
>>> pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
>>> pxm.GetVersionMajor()
>>> pxm.GetVersionMinor()
>>> pxm.GetVersionPatch()

That'd be great. Having things on the bug trackers ensures that we

Thanks. That was exactly what I was looking for. (and it works in 3.4,
too if I import the servermanager directly :) )

Only question: how could I have found it on my own as the usual
methods for introspection (dir(pxm), help(pxm))don't reveal these
three methods?

Hi Bernhard,

The c++ class, vtkSMProxyManager, gets wrapped by a python class.  So
dir(pxm) only shows you the methods added by the python class.  To see
the available c++ methods, try dir(pxm.SMProxyManager)  The proxy
manager is a special case, most pvpython objects are instances of
Proxy and you can do dir(foo.SMProxy) to see the c++ documentation.

The proxy manager c++ documentation is here:
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/html/classvtkSMProxyManager.html

Also, if you browse the doxygen documentation
(http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/html/classes.html) keep
in mind that not all c++ methods are going to be available from
python.

??? Re:Re: [Paraview] Paraview store all data in every server node?

Hi:
   I used vtkXdmfReader to read my data(ParaView version is 3.4.0), and I also found some information about my problem(XDMF bad memory use) from the mail list. But I didn't find a final resolution for it.
   My problem is, for example: 
      run: mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver         
    after reading data and rendering isosurface, each node(process) consume 2GB memory

  and run: mpirun -np 16 ./pvserver
    after reading data and rendering isosurface, each node(process) also consume 2GB memory
    For this problem, I could't visualize large-scale dataset. Because if a dataset could be visualized by one node, It also could  be visualized by 16 nodes, but if it could't be visualized by one node, it also could't by 16 nodes(or more).
    Maybe I should try ParaView 3.6.1. I will cry if the problem still exist in version 3.6.1......

?2009-08-30?"Andy Bauer" <andy.bauer at kitware.com> ???
The problem may be the reader that you're using.  Some of the readers in VTK are not parallel so even if you run multiple processes each process will still try to load the entire dataset in that case.

2009/8/30 weaponfire2005 <weaponfire2005 at 163.com>

Hi all:
  First thanks for Dave.Demarle's help.
  I use "mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver" to launch a server with four nodes, visualizing a 800*800*300 grid. It seems that each process consume too much memory. So I extend the number of nodes from 4 to 8 using "mpirun -np 8 ./pvserver" , but each process on 8 nodes server consume the same memory as 4 nodes server. The situation of 16 processes(16 nodes) is same as above.
   I thought that with the number of processes' growth, each process on server would share less raw data, so the quantity of memory each process consuming would decline. It proved that I was wrong. Could someone tell me the reason?
 Thanks for your help:)
 Pan Wang

Hi,<br><br>find attached an xml that exposes the vtkPlatonicSolidSource in =
the paraview sources menu. Load it from the tools-&gt;&quot;Manage plugins&=
quot; menu. At least it will allow you to create a platonic solid in paravi=
ew GUI. But I don&#39;t understand why you want to ask for it in C++.<br>
Maybe you want a plugin (autostart or toolbar) to do that ? If yes, take a =
look at the object builder :<br>=A0=A0 pqApplicationCore* core =3D pqApplic=
ationCore::instance();<br>=A0=A0 pqObjectBuilder* builder =3D core-&gt;getO=
bjectBuilder();<br>
<br>From current core instance&#39;s object builder, you will be able to cr=
eate servers, sources, filters,...<br><br>&#39;Hope that helps.<br><br>Jero=

the outline by default. Try changing the representation type to
"Wireframe" or "Surface" does that help?

ParaView doesn't use parallelism to scale in terms of processing speed, it
uses it to scale in terms of achievable data size. That means, if you have
sufficient memory on one machine, processing the data on two machines isn't
likely to give you any speed up and will usually slow it down because of th=
e
extra code and especially communication that has to happen in the parallel
program (Ahmdahls law). If the problem is too big for one machine, then the
only alternative is to split the data and run it on many machines
(Gustafsen's law). That said, if the data is nearly to big for one machine,
for instance when swapping, then splitting it and running it on several
machines will make it faster for a while until the overhead starts to
dominate the performance.

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log, my guess is:<br>

Scenario 1: <br>
Process 0 reads the whole data, disseminate the dats into 4 pieces, then di=
stribute to itself and Process 1&amp;2&amp;3,<br>

Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,<br>

=A0<br>
Scenario 2:<br>
Process 0 reads the whole data, distribute the whole data to Process 0&amp;=
1&amp;2&amp;3,<br>
each node will &#39;take&#39; their own piece of data to process, then send=
 it back Process 0,<br>
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,<br>
client renders the data<br>
=A0=A0=A0<br>
Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?<br>

is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute =

i tried running the same data using np1 until np10=2C and i get the followi=
ng reading for still render=2C the rest of the readings are quite consisten=
t=2C which makes me wonder why the time (still render) decrease initially b=
ut increase eventually? shouldn't it become much faster when more nodes are=
 used? all my server nodes are identical to each other (intel core 2 duo=2C=
 2.66 GHz)



ParaView doesn't use parallelism to scale in terms of processing speed=2C i=
t uses it to scale in terms of achievable data size. That means=2C if you h=
ave sufficient memory on one machine=2C processing the data on two machines=
 isn't likely to give you any speed up and will usually slow it down becaus=
e of the extra code and especially communication that has to happen in the =
parallel program (Ahmdahls law). If the problem is too big for one machine=
=2C then the only alternative is to split the data and run it on many machi=
nes (Gustafsen's law). That said=2C if the data is nearly to big for one ma=
chine=2C for instance when swapping=2C then splitting it and running it on =
several machines will make it faster for a while until the overhead starts =
to dominate the performance.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log




Both scenarios are wrong.  ParaView will not push out data from process 0 t=
o processes 1-3 unless you explicitly run a filter that does that (or the r=
eader does that internally=2C but I know of no such reader).  What is actua=
lly happening is more along the lines of:



Processes 0-3 each read in a partition of data from the file.=20
Each process extracts polygonal geometry from their local data.=20
Per your settings=2C ParaView decides to send the geometry to the client.  =
The data is collected to process 0 and sent to the client.

The reason you are not seeing vtkFileSeriesReader on all of the servers is =
that there is a threshold in the timer log to not show anything that execut=
es under a certain amount of time (by default 0.01 seconds).  If you change=
 the Time Threshold to Show All=2C you should be able to see everything tha=
t executes=2C even if it completes immediately.

You should note that how readers read partitions is determined by the reade=
r itself.  Many of the readers do not really handle partitioned reading.  T=
hus=2C the reader will do something na=EFve like read everything on process=
 0.  Based on your timings=2C that is probably what is happening to you.  T=
hat is=2C processes 1-3 probably have empty data.  You never specified what=
 format of data you are reader=2C so I cannot answer the data completely.  =
However=2C if you want to know how your data is partitioned on the server (=
at least=2C before rendering)=2C you can run the Process Ids filter.

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log=2C my guess is:
=20
Scenario 1:=20
Process 0 reads the whole data=2C disseminate the dats into 4 pieces=2C the=
n distribute to itself and Process 1&2&3=2C
each node will process the data and send it back Process 0=2C
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client=2C
client renders the data
=20
Scenario 2:
Process 0 reads the whole data=2C distribute the whole data to Process 0&1&=
2&3=2C
each node will 'take' their own piece of data to process=2C then send it ba=
ck Process 0=2C
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client=2C
client renders the data
  =20
Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?
=20
is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute =
vtkFileSeriesReader=2C Execute vtkMPIMoveData?
=20
any help / feedback is highly appreciated!

i tried running the same data using np1 until np10, and i get the following=
 reading for still render, the rest of the readings are quite consistent, w=
hich makes me wonder why the time (still render) decrease initially but inc=
rease eventually? shouldn't it become much faster when more nodes are used?=
 all my server nodes are identical to each other (intel core 2 duo, 2.66 GH=
z)


ParaView doesn't use parallelism to scale in terms of processing speed, it =
uses it to scale in terms of achievable data size. That means, if you have =
sufficient memory on one machine, processing the data on two machines isn't=
 likely to give you any speed up and will usually slow it down because of t=
he extra code and especially communication that has to happen in the parall=
el program (Ahmdahls law). If the problem is too big for one machine, then =
the only alternative is to split the data and run it on many machines (Gust=
afsen's law). That said, if the data is nearly to big for one machine, for =
instance when swapping, then splitting it and running it on several machine=
s will make it faster for a while until the overhead starts to dominate the=
 performance.



----------------------------------------------
number of process used still render (seconds)

Subject: Re: [Paraview] How to interpret timer log


Both scenarios are wrong.  ParaView will not push out data from process 0 t=
o processes 1-3 unless you explicitly run a filter that does that (or the r=
eader does that internally, but I know of no such reader).  What is actuall=
y happening is more along the lines of:


 1.  Processes 0-3 each read in a partition of data from the file.
 2.  Each process extracts polygonal geometry from their local data.
 3.  Per your settings, ParaView decides to send the geometry to the client=
.  The data is collected to process 0 and sent to the client.

The reason you are not seeing vtkFileSeriesReader on all of the servers is =
that there is a threshold in the timer log to not show anything that execut=
es under a certain amount of time (by default 0.01 seconds).  If you change=
 the Time Threshold to Show All, you should be able to see everything that =
executes, even if it completes immediately.

You should note that how readers read partitions is determined by the reade=
r itself.  Many of the readers do not really handle partitioned reading.  T=
hus, the reader will do something na=EFve like read everything on process 0=
.  Based on your timings, that is probably what is happening to you.  That =
is, processes 1-3 probably have empty data.  You never specified what forma=
t of data you are reader, so I cannot answer the data completely.  However,=
 if you want to know how your data is partitioned on the server (at least, =
before rendering), you can run the Process Ids filter.

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log, my guess is:

Scenario 1:
Process 0 reads the whole data, disseminate the dats into 4 pieces, then di=
stribute to itself and Process 1&2&3,
each node will process the data and send it back Process 0,
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,
client renders the data

Scenario 2:
Process 0 reads the whole data, distribute the whole data to Process 0&1&2&=
3,
each node will 'take' their own piece of data to process, then send it back=
 Process 0,
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,
client renders the data

Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?

is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute =
vtkFileSeriesReader, Execute vtkMPIMoveData?

any help / feedback is highly appreciated!
thanks!

i tried running the same data using np1 until np10, and i get the following=
 reading for still render, the rest of the readings are quite consistent, w=
hich makes me wonder why the time (still render) decrease initially but inc=
rease eventually? shouldn't it become much faster when more nodes are used?=
 all my server nodes are identical to each other (intel core 2 duo, 2.66 GH=
z)<BR>

ParaView doesn't use parallelism to scale in terms of processing speed, it =
uses it to scale in terms of achievable data size. That means, if you have =
sufficient memory on one machine, processing the data on two machines isn't=
 likely to give you any speed up and will usually slow it down because of t=
he extra code and especially communication that has to happen in the parall=
el program (Ahmdahls law). If the problem is too big for one machine, then =
the only alternative is to split the data and run it on many machines (Gust=
afsen's law). That said, if the data is nearly to big for one machine, for =
instance when swapping, then splitting it and running it on several machine=
s will make it faster for a while until the overhead starts to dominate the=
 performance.<BR>

The reason you are not seeing vtkFileSeriesReader on all of the servers is =
that there is a threshold in the timer log to not show anything that execut=
es under a certain amount of time (by default 0.01 seconds). &nbsp;If you c=
hange the Time Threshold to Show All, you should be able to see everything =
that executes, even if it completes immediately.<BR>
<BR>
You should note that how readers read partitions is determined by the reade=
r itself. &nbsp;Many of the readers do not really handle partitioned readin=
g. &nbsp;Thus, the reader will do something na&iuml;ve like read everything=
 on process 0. &nbsp;Based on your timings, that is probably what is happen=
ing to you. &nbsp;That is, processes 1-3 probably have empty data. &nbsp;Yo=
u never specified what format of data you are reader, so I cannot answer th=
e data completely. &nbsp;However, if you want to know how your data is part=
itioned on the server (at least, before rendering), you can run the Process=
 Ids filter.<BR>

i have difficulty interpreting the timer log, my guess is:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Scenario 1: <BR>
Process 0 reads the whole data, disseminate the dats into 4 pieces, then di=
stribute to itself and Process 1&amp;2&amp;3,<BR>
each node will process the data and send it back Process 0,<BR>
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,<BR>
client renders the data<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Scenario 2:<BR>
Process 0 reads the whole data, distribute the whole data to Process 0&amp;=
1&amp;2&amp;3,<BR>
each node will 'take' their own piece of data to process, then send it back=
 Process 0,<BR>
Process 0 gather all data and send it back to client,<BR>
client renders the data<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
Which scenario is the correct one? or both are wrong?<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
is there any resources i could refer to find what does it mean by: Execute =
vtkFileSeriesReader, Execute vtkMPIMoveData?<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
any help / feedback is highly appreciated!<BR>
thanks!<BR>
