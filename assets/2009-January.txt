Subject: [Paraview] Building Plugin PV3.5 (Newbie)
Message-ID: <495CF836.5090105@yahoo.de>

Dear group,

I try to build a plugin to Paraview following the wiki:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Filter

I have a CVS-snapshot of Paraview and build it successfully. Now I try 
to add the example vtkMyElevationFilter to this Paraview. However, I do 
not understand how to build the Plugin with cmake. The wiki tells:

"Then using cmake and a build system, one can build a plugin for this 
new filter."

I do not know how to run cmake / build the plugin. I tried running 
"cmake ." in the directory "$PV_SOURCE/Examples/Plugins/Filter" but 
cmake complains:
CMake Error: Error in cmake code at
/home/basti/Desktop/ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/Filter/CMakeLists.txt:6:
Unknown CMake command "ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN".
-- Configuring done

Thanks BastiL

You can compute the magnitude with the calculator and then contour that.

You split the main 3D window and selected "Spreadsheet View" for the
new frame? Then, did you turn on the visibility of the slice in that
view? I can't reproduce your issue.

Subject: [Paraview] calculator filter via python
Message-ID: <3b6093ef0901020904t73da6ce2v21d939c255b105fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to do calculations based on coordinate locations.  In the
GUI I can simply select 'coordsX', 'coordsY', 'coordsZ'.  From python
things seem to be more complicated.  I've tried the snippet below with
several variations and keep getting errors

calc_radius = servermanager.filters.Calculator(Input=g_cont)
calc_radius.AddCoordinateScalarVariable('coordsX', 0)
calc_radius.Function =
'sqrt((coordsX-center[i][0])^2+(coordsY-center[i][1])^2+(coordsZ-center[i][2])^2)'
calc_radius.UpdatePipeline()

I've also tried
calc_radius.AddCoordinateScalarVariable('coordsX')
but I get the error:
     calc_radius.AddCoordinateScalarVariable('coordsX')
TypeError: __call__() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)

I've also tried using the scalar array name ('G' in this case) in
place of coordsX but have met the same error message.

What is the correct way of doing this?

Also, I've tried using the PV-Dump.py script that was suggested to me
previously but am met with the error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 33, in allToPython
  File "<string>", line 48, in proxiesToPython
  File "<string>", line 149, in __orderProxies
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups'

The offending lines are:
def __orderProxies( proxies ):
    """Returns an array, where each entry contains the names of the proxies that
    depend on the previous array entry."""
    patternName   = re.compile(' *XMLName: *(.*)')
    patternValues = re.compile(' *Values: *(.*)')
    patternHex    = re.compile('^0x[0-9a-f]+$')
    pmanager      = servermanager.ProxyManager()

    dependencies  = {}                                        # COLLECT DEPS
    for group in proxies:                                     # For each proxy
      for name in proxies[group]:
        dependencies[group+':'+name] = {}                     # Init its depend.
        proxy = proxies[group][name]

        for prop in proxy:
148          match     = patternName.search( str(prop) )
149          propName  = match.groups()[0]

I was hoping that this script would be very helpful.  Anyone else have
similar problems?

Thanks in advance for your help,
Peter.

I don't think I can do what I originally intended via the calculator
filter due to the need to access the data in center[i][k] which is a
data array in my script but the function parser won't know what to do
with it.  I was able to make some good progress using the programmable
filter and the information on the wiki.

My main question at this point is how do I access the time data from
the programmable filter?  I am using multiblockdatasets.

Thanks,
Peter.

Hi,

I am trying to use "DoubleArrayInformationHelper" to get a 
vtkDoubleArray from server side and show it in my filter 
GUI.
XML code:

       <DoubleVectorProperty
          name="volumesArray"
          command="GetVolumesArray"
          information_only="1">
         <DoubleArrayInformationHelper/>
       </DoubleVectorProperty>

C++:
	vtkDoubleArray* GetVolumesArray()
	{
		return this->volumesArray;
	}
The current code don't show anything in the GUI.
I would like to see the content of volumesArray in a 
Table, List or a Tree widget.

How can I do that ?

You will have to create a custom panel. Look at the custom panel
example in Examples/Plugin.

If its because its an information property, I think adding a show="1" 
attribute to the property will make it show up.

Thanks for your responses.

I know how to create a custom panel and how to use 
"SimpleDoubleInformationHelper". My problem is how to get 
a "DoubleArrayInformationHelper" from a vtkDoubleArray 
with unknown size and send it to my custom panel. The 
compoment of this vtkDoubleArray ( called "VolumesArray" 
here) will be added in ResquestData().

I found a way to do it:

XML:
       <StringVectorProperty
          name="VolumesArray"
          command="GetVolumesArray"
          information_only="1">
         <SimpleStringInformationHelper/>
       </StringVectorProperty>

In RequestData(), I will set VolumesArray to some values 
like "1223.44|2244.09|233232|..." Note the "|" separator 
after each volume.

In my .ui, I created a QLineEdit with the same name 
("VolumesArray").

In my pqCustomPanel.cxx:

pqComputeVolumes::pqComputeVolumes(pqProxy* pxy, QWidget* 
p) :
   pqLoadedFormObjectPanel(":/CustomWidget/pqComputeVolumes.ui", 
pxy, p)
   {

		this->volumes = 
this->findChild<QLineEdit*>("VolumesArray");
		this->volumesList = 
this->findChild<QListWidget*>("volumesList");

		this->volumes->setVisible(false);

		QObject::connect(this->volumes, SIGNAL(textChanged(const 
QString&)),
			this, SLOT(onShowVolumesList(const 
QString&)),Qt::QueuedConnection);

	  this->linkServerManagerProperties();	
	}


void pqComputeVolumes::onShowVolumesList(const QString& 
text)
{
	int i=0;
	QStringList list = 
text.split("|",QString::SkipEmptyParts);

	foreach( QString v, list)
	{
		i++;
		this->volumesList->addItem("Volume " + 
QString::number(i) + "             " + v);
	}
}

This works fine for me but I think there is an easier way.

Subject: [Paraview] Running ParaView without the GUI and windows.
Message-ID: <49622A9E.9040001@whoi.edu>

Hi,

I am wondering if there is a way to run ParaView without the GUI and 
screen output. The idea would be to get ParaView to process a script and 
  output the scene in some format, for example JPEG, to be attached to a 
web-page.

Many thanks in advance for any ideas on this.

Best,

Gonzalo

ParaView supports Python scripting, which can be run without the GUI.  See this Wiki page:

Subject: [Paraview] Ensuring that a plugin is loaded in pvpython
Message-ID: <87sknxjzrk.fsf@workstation006.office.ice-sf.at>


Hi!

I'm trying to write a script that loads a state-file and makes a
picture. The source that reads the data is in a plugin. The plugin is
loaded and works in paraview (obviously. Otherwise I couldn't generate
the state-file). The script is run via pvpython.
So before loading the State-file using servermanager.LoadState() I
load the plugin (actually both plugins) with servermanager.LoadPlugin()
Loading the state I get the error message

ERROR: In /home/openfoam/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMProxyManager.cxx, line 327
vtkSMProxyManager (0x5a98bd0): No proxy that matches: group=sources and proxy=PV3FoamReader were found.

(PV3FoamReader being the source). I can verify that by having a look
at dir(servermanager.sources) - it's not there.

And now comes the punch-line: the same script worked on my Mac the
problem happens on my 64-Bit-Linux-Machine (and it is not a matter 
of wrong-path or wrong dylib/so-extension. I checked). The plugin and
paraview were compiled on both machines from the same sources with the
same settings.

Is there a way to diagnose what the problem might be? I can't find two
things in the Python/servermanager-interface that would help me:
 - A facility that lists all the loaded modules (Paraview can do this)
 - Some feedback from LoadPlugin whether and why it failed. Currently
   I can do
   servermanager.LoadPlugin("/path/I/m/pretty/sure/it/doesnt/exist")
   and I will see no difference to a sucessfully loaded module

To sum up my two problems:

a)
   Mac:   paraview + Plugin = OK
          pvpython + Plugin = OK
   Linux: paraview + Plugin = OK
          pvpython + Plugin = Not Loaded
What could be the cause?

b) Better interface to the plugin-facilities in Python.

Dear all,

I go further with this discussion : I have also a "not a valid Qt
plugin" error on windows.

The devel system is :
- Windows XP SP3
- ParaView 3.4 built with
   - Python 2.5
   - Qt 4.3.5
   - MS Visual C++ 9.0 Express

Qt is also built with Visual 9.0

The plugin compiles and works well on this system (but a weird
"STATIC" vs "SHARED" problem persists, that will be described in
another e-mail).

The user system is XP SP3 with the available ParaView 3.4 binaries.
When loading the plugin, I get a "Is not a valid Qt plugin"

I noted that the only difference between my compiled ParaView and the
available one is the IDE (Visual 9 express vs. Visual 2005 ). Is it
possible that this is the source of the error ? Unfortunately, I do
not have access to a VS 2005, so I cannot try...

Thanks for your time, and obviously : happy new year !

Regards,

Jerome

Hi all!

I'm compiling ParaView3 by cmake on my Kubuntu 8.04.1 machine. I see
that PARAVIEW_DATA ROOT value is not found when configure the project.
What is that variable is used for? I didn't find it on the Web.

Thank you in advance!

Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0901060203m7cac25bckf92ea19ed6613567@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have to place interactively a point in a volume (medical image).
Today, I use the PointSource and move the cursor in the volume by
changing the current plane view (camera). this is not easy for the
user 'Lambda'. My question is :
Is it possible to use the 2D view, ie a slice-by-slice volume
visualization, and then click on the pixel of interest : it gives the
2D (eg. x,y) position, the depth (eg. z) being defined by the current
slice number ?

Thanks a lot !

Regards,
Jerome

Hi, 

You need to download the DATA package along paraview in order to use this.
It basically specifies where all the test/demo data is for the examples.

I am by no means a Windows expert but I don't think you can mix and
match C++ libraries built with different versions of Visual Studio. We
should probably migrate to using Visual Studio Express to build our 32
bit binaries but I don't have much time to do it.

for it to remain NOT_FOUND.

Subject: [Paraview] Question on Image reader
Message-ID: <49638415.2020703@tp1.rub.de>

Hello everyone.

I'm trying to implement a custom reader for ParaView 3.4.
The output data is of the ImageData type.
With the help of the ParaView guid I got as far as implementing
the reader, save the most important bit of filling the actual data
into the output object.
So I have got the raw binary array - or file, if this is better -
and the vtkImageData object.
How can I move my data into the vtk object?

Thanks in advance
    Thorsten

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple inheritance in filter writing
Message-ID: <496384C2.6060802@student.ethz.ch>

Hi

I've got a filter which is shared among a paraview plugin and some other 
tools. That's why it inherits a basic threading class to simplify 
writing threaded filters.

The filter is defined as follows:

class vtkMyFilter: public vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm, public 
vtkThreadedFilter

The ThreadedFilter class has a vtk prefix to make the parser happy.... 
Anyway, I run this filter, because in the generated file:
vtkMyFilterClientServer.cxx, there is a function defined and used called:

int vtkThreadedFilterCommand(vtkClientServerInterpreter*, 
vtkObjectBase*, const char*, const vtkClientServerStream&, 
vtkClientServerStream& resultStream);

Obviously, such a function is defined for every base class - but the one 
above does not exist because vtkThreadedFilter is not wrapped. The easy 
solution would be to wrap vtkThreadedFilter, but this requires the 
definition of the New, SafeDownCast etc macros like in every other vtk 
object. However, since vtkThreadedFilter is not a vtk Object by 
themselves, it does not have a vtk baseclass and therefore, I cannot 
declare the macro vtkTypeRevisionMacro.

Is there a simple solution to this mess?

Thanks
Benjamin

Thank you. 

That would be the better feedback wouldn't it? 

About not working on Linux: is this a general problem or something
special to my machine (I the "Paraview/Python Scripting"-document the
path "/Users/berk" and the words "This is on my Mac ..." lead me to
the conclusion that the primary platform for testing the python-stuff
is NOT Linux)

Yes, it is possible. You have two choices:

1) Use the programmable filter

In a programmable filter, you can access the blocks of a multi-block
dataset with something like:

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
output.GetBlock(0).GetNumberOfPoints()

2) Fetch the data from the server

Of course, Fetch is a no-op if you are using the built-in server.
output = servermanager.Fetch(reader)
output.GetBlock(0).GetNumberOfPoints()

vtkImage->GetScalarPointer(); will return a void* which you can cast  
to the appropriate type for your image data.

You can then use any byte copying routine to copy the data from the  
file into the byte array. To save yourself some of that copying if  
your data file is setup so that you can read some header information  
so that you know how much to allocate you can FIRST allocate the  
vtkImageData object, get the pointer to the front of the array and  
read directly from the file into the array.

Not true. My main machine is Mac but several other developers use
Linux. We also perform nightly testing on a variety of Linux
platforms. Having said that, I am not sure how well loading a plugin
from Python is tested. I am guessing your problem is going to be some
shared library dependency and the way Linux resolves shared libraries.
I am not an expert on shared library loading so I can't help much...

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple inheritance in filter writing

I am afraid there is no solution. VTK does not support multiple
inheritance. I recommend using HasA instead of IsA.

Subject: [Paraview] eternal Unknown CMake command "QT4_WRAP_CPP". error
Message-ID: <704f3c640901061003t316477fdj2d1de4d48b7af097@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there
I'm very new to paraview, I managed to compile paraview on linux and mac
but when I try to compile a plugin y get the infamous Unknown CMake command
"QT4_WRAP_CPP". error.

I read on this list that I have to setup the variable QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE

the problem is that I dont know how and were to set it on
/Applications/CMake 2.6-2.app/Contents/share/cmake-2.6/Modules/FindQt4.cmake

like this
SET(QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE /usr/bin/qmake-4.3)
 at the end of the file

but still does not work

one problem is that man cmake skills are very near to 0

any help would be appreciate it.



qmake -v
QMake version 2.01a
Using Qt version 4.3.5 in /Library/Frameworks

You probably want something like:

IF (DEFINED ParaView_BINARY_DIR)
   INCLUDE(${ParaView_BINARY_DIR}/ParaViewConfig.cmake)
ELSE (DEFINED ParaView_BINARY_DIR)
    INCLUDE($ENV{ParaView_DIR}/ParaViewConfig.cmake)
ENDIF (DEFINED ParaView_BINARY_DIR)
PROJECT(RoboMetClientPlugin)

FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)
IF(QT4_FOUND)

   INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})
   #-- All your Qt4 dependent code in here.

ENDIF (QT4_FOUND)

Hi there and thanks
since I'm very new to the paraview and cmake build workd, could you tell me
where should I put that

I'm trying to compile the GUITollbar example
################################################CMAKELists.txt#################
# create a plugin that implements an object panel for a source proxy

QT4_WRAP_CPP(MOC_SRCS MyToolBarActions.h)

# we implement a pqConePanel.h for the ConeSource
ADD_PARAVIEW_ACTION_GROUP(IFACES IFACE_SRCS CLASS_NAME MyToolBarActions
                          GROUP_NAME "ToolBar/MyActions")

# create a plugin for this panel
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(GUIMyToolBar "1.0"
                    GUI_INTERFACES ${IFACES}
                    SOURCES MyToolBarActions.cxx ${MOC_SRCS} ${IFACE_SRCS})

You need to set the environment variable "ParaView_DIR" to the correct  
directory.

So you installed ParaView 3.4 into /Users/jmazo/gato?

then ParaView_DIR should be /Users/jmazo/gato

I think..

Also, keep the discussion on list in case someone else wants to help  
out..

hi there

I did the find

find / -name ParaViewConfig.cmake
/Users/jmazo/Desktop/paraview/ParaViewConfig.cmake

so I set

yarumal8:Plugins jmazo$ export ParaView_DIR=/Users/jmazo/Desktop/paraview

but I get the same error

Unknown CMake command "ADD_PARAVIEW_ACTION_GROUP".

I'm running ccmake on

/Users/jmazo/Desktop/fofo/ParaView-3.4.0/Examples/Plugins



and when I did make install I set the dir to

/Users/jmazo/gato


I tried setting ParaView_DIR to

/Users/jmazo/gato
/Users/jmazo/Desktop/paraview/
/Users/jmazo/Desktop/fofo/ParaView-3.4.0


but I got the same error on all cases

any ideas


thanks

What happens if you do this...

class vtkMyFilter: public vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm
//BTX
, public myThreadedFilter
//ETX

I think I've used that trick before (or something similar, I'll check). 
If that doesn't remove the offending method instantiation, then why not 
simply define a dummy method in your vtk class (as long as it is linked 
in, it should be ok).

int vtkThreadedFilterCommand(vtkClientServerInterpreter*, 
vtkObjectBase*, const char*, const vtkClientServerStream&, 
vtkClientServerStream& resultStream)
{
return 1 or 0;
}

Hi

Thanks for the idea - I thought about this (the second trick) as well 
yesterday evening and it seems to work. The nice thing is - I can put it 
into a vtkHacks.cxx and not pollute anything inside my classes

Thanks
Benjamin

Hi,

i have a question regarding the filters "Compute Derivatives" and 
"Gradient (Unstructured)". I have to calculate a equation on an 
unstructured data set with some derivatives of the velocity.

Using the "Gradient (Unstructured)" it works, but it is really slow. 
Using the "Compute Derivatives" and the convert the result back from 
cell centers to points i can get nearly the same results - but much 
faster (the most time takes the conversion from cell center to points!).

So i made a comparison of both results with an isosurface of the 
magnitude of the difference between both gradients an i can only find 
minor changes. So my question to the developers: Where is the difference 
between both filters? Why is the "Gradient (Unstructured)" so much slower?

Best regards and thank you in advance,

     Stefan

Subject: [Paraview] image quality for JPEG writer in pvpython
Message-ID: <68E6DDCE37821E429FEA595B7FAC4FF6067E081209@srvmes03.spe-ch-md9.net>

Hello All,

I am working with pvpython/pvbatch. I need to save some JPEG files, which I do using something like:

view.WriteImage(outputdir + filename, "vtkJPEGWriter")

The resulting JPEG files have a 95% quality, which turns out to be too much for what I am doing (in terms of file size).
Is there a way to specify the quality of the JPEG files saved using WriteImage()?

If this is not possible, can somebody suggest how to tweak the ParaView sources to save with a different quality?

Many thanks,
-Marzio

Hmmm. This is possible if you have access to the ParaView build tree.
Here is the abbreviated C++ implementation of WriteImage:

  vtkImageData* shot = this->CaptureWindow(magnification);
  writer->SetInput(shot);
  writer->SetFileName(filename);
  writer->Write();

You can call CaptureWindow() on the view and get an image data back.
Then, you can create you own write and set the quality on it. This is
the tricky part. You  need the import the full VTK module. To do that,
you have to add <build tree prefix>/ VTK/Wrapping/Python to your
PYTHONPATH. Then, you can do:

import vtk
writer = vtk.vtkJPEGWriter()
writer.SetInput(shot)
writer.SetQuality(80)
writer.Write()

-berk

Thanks a lot!
I ended up last night hand-editing the Makefile generated
by CMake to include and link an additional library to the
plugin binary, but I guess there is some better method.
If someone could point me in the right direction?

I use the following to link additional libraries to my server side  
plugin:

  TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES("${MODULE_NAME}"
                      vtkClientServer
                      vtkPVServerManager
                      ${MXA_LIBRARIES}
                      ${MXA_SUPPORT_LIBRARIES}
                      ${BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY}

If you are building your plugin at the same time you compile ParaView  
by using the $MODULE_NAME}ParaViewImport.cmake and the  
Paraview_Extra_External_Modules cmake property then you can use the $ 
{PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES} variable to add more libraries to the  
linking of the pvFilters target.

I have a few projects that do this if you are interested in seeing them.

Thanks!
An example would be very nice indeed.

Jorge,

First of, you cannot build new plugins using an installed ParaView (at
for ParaView 3.4.* and earlier, it should work with CVS ParaView). You
need to download the source and build ParaView from scartch. Then set
the ParaView_DIR to the directory in which you've built ParaView.

Alas there's no way for the python programmable filter to ask for a
particular timestep currently. This should be remedied soon. Feel free
to add a bug report at:

The plugins in the Examples directory can be built by turning on the
"BUILD_EXAMPLES" cmake option. It's an advanced option so may not be
visible by default in your cmake gui.

Jacques,

Is this functionality for a custom application developed over ParaView
or for a plugin extending standard ParaView?

However, you can get the current time value with:

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
print input.GetInformation().Get(vtk.vtkDataObject.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)

When it comes to images there's whole lot of things to worry about
such as extents, extent translators etc etc. Adding support for
delivering image data in parallel may not be a trivial task.

hi there
so what you are saying is that I need the cvs version of paraview?

I tried building paraview with sources 3.4.0 in
/home/jmazo/parasrc

then set the variable to  /home/jmazo/parasrc

then tried to build a plugin but I still get the QT error, so I added
find_package(Qt4)

but I still get the paraview errors

thanks in advance, I'm going to try with the cvs version

Ignore my comment about ParaView CVS. That was only if you needed to
build a plugin from installed ParaView (and not one built from
source).

Just to make sure /home/jmazo/parasrc is the build directory and not
the source directory i.e. it contains ParaViewConfig.cmake and has
"bin" directory that contains the paraview executable right?

Here is what we are saying for ParaView 3.4.0

1: Download the source for PV 3.4.0 from the kitware website.
2: Uncompress the file, this should create a folder ParaView
3: cd into ParaView
4: mkdir Build
5: cd Build
6: ccmake ../
   6a: Turn ON SHARED_LIBS
   6b: [c]onfigure
   6c: [g]enerate
7: make  ( Wait a long time for the build. use the -jx flag for make  
to speed up the compile)
8: You are done with paraview build. DO NOT "install" paraview anywhere.

Assume this was done in /home/jmazo/paraview/Build
export QTDIR=/home/jmazo/paraview/Build

Now try to build your plugin. Qt and ParaView specific macros should  
be found.

If you are building ParaView anyway you may want to consider having  
your plugin build as part of the ParaView build.

Hi there
I followed you instructions but still did not work
here is what I did
1. downloaded paraview-3.4.0.tar.gz, and uncompress it, and got a directory
ParaView-3.4.0
  yarumal8:ParaView-3.4.0 jmazo$ pwd
  /Users/jmazo/ParaView-3.4.0
2. Created the directory Build inside ParaView-3.4.0
    in there
    configured, BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON, VTK_USE_RPATH=ON, and PYTHON=ON
    build with make -j 8

yarumal8:ParaView-3.4.0 jmazo$ pwd
/Users/jmazo/ParaView-3.4.0
yarumal8:ParaView-3.4.0 jmazo$ ls Build/
Applications                DartConfiguration.tcl            Testing
CMakeCache.txt                Documentation                Utilities
CMakeFiles                Makefile                VTK
CMakeTmp                ParaView3CompileToolsConfig.cmake    bin
CPackConfig.cmake            ParaViewConfig.cmake
cmake_install.cmake
CPackSourceConfig.cmake            ParaViewLibraryDepends.cmake
pqClient.adp
CTestCustom.ctest            Plugins                    vtkPQConfig.h
CTestTestfile.cmake            Qt                    vtkPVConfig.h
Common                    Servers
yarumal8:ParaView-3.4.0 jmazo$

3. set the varialbes

yarumal8:ParaView-3.4.0 jmazo$ echo $QTDIR
/Users/jmazo/ParaView-3.4.0/Build
yarumal8:ParaView-3.4.0 jmazo$ echo $ParaView_DIR
/Users/jmazo/ParaView-3.4.0

I had to add PACKAGE_FIND(Qt4) becuase I got the QT4_WRAP error
so here is the CMakeList

yarumal8:Plugins jmazo$ cat GUIToolBar/CMakeLists.txt
FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)

# create a plugin that implements an object panel for a source proxy

QT4_WRAP_CPP(MOC_SRCS MyToolBarActions.h)

# we implement a pqConePanel.h for the ConeSource
ADD_PARAVIEW_ACTION_GROUP(IFACES IFACE_SRCS CLASS_NAME MyToolBarActions
                          GROUP_NAME "ToolBar/MyActions")

# create a plugin for this panel
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(GUIMyToolBar "1.0"
                    GUI_INTERFACES ${IFACES}
                    SOURCES MyToolBarActions.cxx ${MOC_SRCS} ${IFACE_SRCS})


yarumal8:Plugins jmazo$ cmake GUIToolBar

Add the following two lines to your CMakeLists and set the
ParaView_DIR to point to the  /Users/jmazo/ParaView-3.4.0/Build
BEGIN=====
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
END====

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Help fails on repacking
Message-ID: <4964F89C.3030603@gmail.com>

When I rebuild a custom version of ParaView 3.4 using cpack using the 
help fails. The error I get is that when I click on the help I get a 
vtkErrorMacro of  "Qt Assistant crashed".  What am I doing wrong?

Sorry if I am reposting this question it seems some of my questions 
where getting bounced because of format problems.

Just to correct what I wrote:
Here is what we are saying for ParaView 3.4.0

1: Download the source for PV 3.4.0 from the kitware website.
2: Uncompress the file, this should create a folder ParaView-3.4.0
3: cd into ParaView-3.4.0
4: mkdir Build
5: cd Build
6: ccmake ../
  6a: Turn ON SHARED_LIBS
  6b: [c]onfigure
  6c: [g]enerate
7: make  ( Wait a long time for the build. use the -jx flag for make  
to speed up the compile)
8: You are done with paraview build. DO NOT "install" paraview anywhere.

Assume this was done in /home/jmazo/ParaView-3.4.0/Build
export ParaView_DIR=/home/jmazo/ParaView-3.4.0/Build

Now try to build your plugin. Qt and ParaView specific macros should  
be found.

And what Utkarsh Ayachit Also added:

# Add the following two lines to _your_ CMakeLists.txt file for your  
plugin
#BEGIN=====
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
#END====

Sorry for the errors....

Thanks for letting me know. Maybe you can point me in the right direction  
for an alternate solution then? I have a 12-16 gigabyte image dataset that  
will be loaded by a 64 bit pvserver. I would like to develop a client using  
paraview as a library to connect this dataset to a client-side image plane  
widget. The rest of my client is written in pure vtk/Qt so I'm avoiding  
paraview GUI components to make my journey to 64-bit Qt/Cocoa easier.

You can run a 64 bit pvserver and connect to it with a 32bit ParaView  
Client. Does that satisfy your needs?

Also, the GUI presented by ParaView is programmed in Qt 4. When Qt 4.5  
comes out then the journey to 64 bit on the client side should be  
straight forward although I am sure there will be "bumps" along the  
way. What specific "Paraview GUI Components" are you trying to avoid  
by writing your own client? (which is based on vtk/Qt itself as you  
state, which will have the _exact_ same problems that ParaView has  
with 32/b4 bit.)

Subject: [Paraview] Difference between "Compute Derivatives" and
 "Gradient (Unstructured)"...
In-Reply-To: <49647990.3060804@DLR.de>
Message-ID: <C58A6592.4BB4%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I took a look at this.  To answer the first question, compute derivatives and gradient (unstructured) are fairly similar.  The compute derivatives filter takes point scalars and computes the gradient in the centroid of each cell (thus producing cell data).  This is a fairly straightforward operation as the vtkCell classes can compute the gradient anywhere in the cell from point data.

The gradient filter can take point data and find the data at the points or take cell data and find (an estimate of) the gradient at the cell centroids.  The algorithm for finding the cell-centered is similar to that in compute derivatives and should take about the same amount of time.  The algorithm for finding point-centered data is to find the gradient at each point of each cell and average the results at each point.

On your prompting, I can the gradient filter through a performance monitor and realized that it was spending about half its time checking for degenerate cells.  I just checked in a change that makes the check much faster.  However, because the gradient filter is doing more derivative calculations, it will always be slower than compute derivatives.

That said, I think it should be fairly easy to add a mode that approximates point gradients by computing cell gradients using the point data and then doint a point-to-cell conversion much like you were doing.  Would anyone want that?

Hi,

i have a question regarding the filters "Compute Derivatives" and
"Gradient (Unstructured)". I have to calculate a equation on an
unstructured data set with some derivatives of the velocity.

Using the "Gradient (Unstructured)" it works, but it is really slow.
Using the "Compute Derivatives" and the convert the result back from
cell centers to points i can get nearly the same results - but much
faster (the most time takes the conversion from cell center to points!).

So i made a comparison of both results with an isosurface of the
magnitude of the difference between both gradients an i can only find
minor changes. So my question to the developers: Where is the difference
between both filters? Why is the "Gradient (Unstructured)" so much slower?

Best regards and thank you in advance,

I assumed there were more Carbon dependencies in paraview, it looks like it
may be just the progress bar, but I'm familiar with vtk/Qt, and I have a
working client for smaller datasets, so I'd rather not learn Views and
representations more than I have to.

Can I use vtkClientServerMoveData? Can I use
SelectionDeliveryRepresentationProxy? It looks like qt 4.5 will solve this
for my mac clients, but I need to figure this out eventually, because we
aren't going to Vista so the poor 32 bit windows machines will need the help
of the linux box in the basement.

Hello there
after much struggle I can now work on a plugin I have to implement

I need to call the FILE > Open functionality, and then jump to Transform
filter
so it is a simple thing to save us some time, since most of the time all we
do is FILE > OPEN {}  > FILTERS > TRANSFORM{}{}{}.


so, my questions are:

1. Documentation for the "file open", (python preferred)
2. Documentation about how to apply the filter to the opened file
3. any advice would be appreciate it (like should I go with python or C...
xml?)


So far I was able to modify the HelixSource example plugin, to apply the
filter I want, but we still have to do the file open thing and then
selecting the plugin from the menu which is annoying


thanks in advance

So its possible to change the gradient-filter to get a speedup? - nice. 
Please let me know when this change is checked in into the cvs-version 
of paraview - i will check it here again.

The last statement i dont understand: using the "compute derivatives" i 
get overall a tensor with 9 derivatives, using the "gradient" filter i 
get only three. So in my case, because i need the complete tensor (to 
compute the strain-rate of the flow) i have to call three times the 
"gradient"-filter. So overall, in both cases 9 derivatives are 
calculated - or am i wrong?

I have done it by combining both steps in a custom filter ... so thats 
enough for me. If other users need it - why not.

Yust a small remark regarding paraview overall: its really a nice tool! 
I currently do much comparison work between paraview, fieldview and 
ensight. We have all packages here at DLR (the german aerospace center) 
and i want to find out if all features we need from fv and ensight can 
be done although in pv ... it seems, thats the case. And pv is much more 
flexible then the other packages. Further on, the speed is critical, 
because we have huge unstructured datasets (typical: > 20e6 points up to 
50e6, sometimes time dependend). So the complete parallel setup of pv 
can be a great help here - with (serial) fv for example we run all the 
time on the limits of our workstations (16 GB main memory, 4 cores) ...

Best regards,

      Stefan

Hi,

I also need such a functionality, as I want to share a simple, easy
demo of a filter -it seems that "open" then "load state" is a too
complicated process...-. On my mind, the purpose is to built
automatically a pipeline when a file is open, that is not
straight-forward: depending on the type of data you opened -that
implicitly choose an appropriate reader-, the next filter may be, or
not, available.

I think that we can take a look on the Auto-starter plugin. The given
example show a notification of "Plugin is loaded", through the
onStartup function. The way should be to catch another event than
startup, such as "fileOpen" or "onRead".

But in your case, maybe the "save state" functionality will be
sufficient ? Or maybe it is possible to include a reader in a custom
filter (composite pipeline functionality) ?

Thank for your help !

In ParaView 3.4 its now possible to load a given state-file over the
command-line.
e.g.: paraview.exe --state=<path_to_state-file>

Hi Jacques,

currently i use tau2plt, then generate "EnsightGold" output and read 
that in. Would be very nice if you can share your NetCDF-Reader for 
paraview...

You working at ARA in Bedford? I was there last December for a 
Solar-Training - there i had my first contact with paraview - it is a 
really nice tool - thats why i am now working with it more and more

Best regards,

     Stefan

Dear ParaView Community,

We have an opening for an HPC/ParaView developer to work on an EU funded 
project aimed at computational steering of particle based simulations - 
we intend to use ParaView for development of the front-end controlling 
application.

The job advertisment, which contains some details, can be found here,  
http://www.cscs.ch/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=135&Itemid=100

Please contact me off-list if you would like further information about 
the project and/or the requirements of the post.

Thank you ! This will help for sure, when the loaded file is the same
at each session. But in the case where the user wants to try another
file, will it be possible for him to change the filename in a simple
way ?

Thanks !

Hi all , John,
I have been trying without success to build the vtkCSCSFluent plugin. I have
tried to build it as a Paraview module, as a VTK module ... When trying to
genereate the makefile with cmake for the paraview module it complains
because it doesnot find a vtkCSCSFluent.pvsm.in file.
Could anyone give me a hint on how to compile this plugin ?

I have both VTK and ParaView CVS versions compiled.
Thanks,
Jacques

Either way. I haven't thought of creating a custom application over ParaView
for the moment. I think I would like most developments to be in ParaView as
a standard. Why?Jacques

you mean, using the _same_ paraView state-file, but different 'data'-files?
if so, this is not really possible.
However, state-files are XML, so it might be possible to update the
filenames in this state-files, but this looks like a ugly solution.

And i don't think that there is an easy way to _replace_ an (already)
loaded 'data'-files in paraView.

Hi,
I can think of two solutions :

1 . Kind of ugly but does work (I've tried it) : Create a template state
file, and replace the filename by a key that a script can change for you
when you want to load in a new file.

2. Write out your pipeline to a python script and just change the file you
load in at the beginning.

There is a solution, using the Python Shell.

1) load your existing state file
2) identify the name of your data object in the pipeline browser. It is
usually the filename stripped of its directory name
3) open the Python Shell and type

pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
reader = pm.GetProxy('sources', 'filename')??????? # where 'filename' is
the string found above in 2)

# your data object is likely to have a name called FileName.
# you may print it to verify
reader.FileName
# you may change it to a new filename
reader.FileName = "your new filename"

4) Forcing the render window to refresh itself will be enough to cause
the update of the whole pipeline. Otherwise, you get a handle to your
view and call StillRender, i.e.

view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
view.StillRender()

Jacques,

>> -> flip between the views by just typing a number on the keyboard
This should be easy. You need to create a QShortcut that captures come
key combination, say Ctrl+Num and then simply changes the active view.
Ofcourse the ordering of views is not necessarily obvious but
shouldn't be too hard to come up with a convention. Look at
Qt/Components/pqActiveView. It's a singleton. Simply call setCurrent()
on it to change the active view. Look at pqApplicationCore::loadState
to see how to get the list of current views.

The other cases dealing with blocks and views are a bit tricky. Let me
get back to you.

Subject: [Paraview] PointData and the components' name
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0901080641m24615967xa4f43689abd5fee1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wrote a filter that build PointData with several vtkDoubleArray. I
gave names to these array, that appear in Paraview - which is very
useful for statistical view.
But these arrays contain several components that ParaView
automatically names X, Y and Z when there are 3 components, or XX, XY,
XZ, YX, YY ... when 9 components, and 1, 2, 3 for other numbers of
field.
I would like to give special names to these fields - the best being
inside my cxx vtk filter- such as "Radius", "Mean", "StdDev", ...,
without allocating one array for each value...

Does someone know how to do that ?

Thanks !

Hey all,

I want to program a filter - an algorithm - that acts only on the current selected nodes or cells in the screen. How can I get this information from the vtkInformationVector** inputVector, which is actually the input of any VTK filter ? 

Thanks,

Look at vtkExtractSelection. Similar to that, you'll have to create a
2 input filter whose one input is a vtkSelection with other is the
data object to be selected.

Message-ID: <6sQJSzM9RAjNH7wBwy2kMj9Z6m5GO_G_lTlqsT55an2hix_L4xeM4Q@cipher.nrlssc.navy.mil>

I'd like to write a plugin that makes the Meta format time-aware.  I've
looked at: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series .

 From that, I see that I can modify 
VTK/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/reader.xml, but I'd prefer it to be
plugin that I can send to someone else with requiring a complete rebuild
of Paraview/VTK.  It should be possible to write a .xml file that gets
loaded as a plugin and that wraps the Meta reader in a vtkFileSeriesReader.

However, if I do it without modifying readers.xml, the original Meta
reader does not get moved to a different ProxyGroup.  Does that mean my
new Meta Series reader won't ever be used?  Is there some other way to 
do it that doesn't require a rebuild of Paraview?

Thanks,
Sean

Sean,

I am a little confused.  Are you saying that there exists a reader in ParaView that you want to use to load in a file series?  And the issue is that because the reader already exists in ParaView in the "sources" group and you cannot move it to "internal_sources" or some other naming conflict?

If this is the case, I don't think there is anything special you have to do.  Just make a new <FileSeriesReaderProxy> tag in the "sources" group.  The Reader subproxy can be in any group; it does not mater if it also came from "sources".  The FileSeriesReaderProxy can also co-exist with the single file reader so long as they have unique names.  You can also make your reader read files with the same file extension; ParaView will use the plugin reader instead of the one defined in ParaView.

-Ken

Hi everyone

I have tried the python way and it works, but it?s kind of ugly,  and boss
kind of wants a more graphic thing, so what I?m doing is making a filechoser
in qt and then TRYING to pass the file name to the python script!
so far no success.


A couple of minutes ago I had this idea: write a file choser in python/TK,
and run the script from paraview, any ideas if that would work?

anyway thank to all, good tips

Subject: [Paraview] linking a library to paraview
Message-ID: <BAY122-W10844FA82F64A2C4D26F0CBCDD0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m trying to write a Paraview Writer which writes data in the .vdc-format i.e. the data format supported by the VAPoR visualization software. 

Downloading the vapor source code, there is a program which does that, so I just modified that code in a way that can be called from Paraview. The problem now is that this code needs to be linked to a few dlls, and I do not know how to achieve this in Paraview. Is it done with my placing the dlls in the Paraview-build directory or do I have to modify the CMakeLists.txt in the directory where I placed the vdcWriter-code? 

Greetings,
Natalie

If you want something graphical why don't you just use the lookmarks ?
Load the data you want and then just apply your lookmark.

I believe it?s an error thrown by the Qt. Does anyone know what?s the problem here (the vtkVdcWriter.h file is posted below) or at least, how I can get an error message which is at least a bit more specific?

vtkVdcWriter.h:
#ifndef _vtkVdcWriter_h
#define _vtkVdcWriter_h

#include "vtkProcessObject.h"
#include "vtkDataSet.h"
#include <vector>
#include <string>


class VTK_EXPORT vtkVdcWriter : public vtkProcessObject
{
public:
  static vtkVdcWriter *New();
  vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkVdcWriter,vtkProcessObject);
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

  //Description:
  // Set or get the file name of the vdc file.
  virtual void SetFileName(const char* fname);
  virtual const char* GetFileName();

  //Description:
  // Set the input data set.
  virtual void SetInput(vtkDataSet* ds);

  // Description:
  // Get any input of this filter.
  vtkDataObject *GetInput(int idx);
  vtkDataObject *GetInput() 
    {return this->GetInput( 0 );}

  //Description:
  // Write the XDMF file.
  void Write();

  //routines from vapor vdfcreate
 int cvtToOrder(const char *from, void *to);
 int cvtToExtents(const char *from, void *to);
 int cvtTo3DBool(const char *from, void *to);
 int getUserTimes(const char *path, vector <double> &timevec); 

 int WriteVDF(unsigned int* dims, int numts, int level, string coordsystem, string metafilename, string var);


  protected:
  vtkVdcWriter();
  ~vtkVdcWriter();

  vtkSetStringMacro(FileNameString);
  vtkSetStringMacro(MetaFileName);
  vtkSetStringMacro(DataFileName);
  char *FileNameString;
  char *MetaFileName;
  char *DataFileName;
};
#endif /* _vtkVdcWriter_h */


Could it be a problem using STL-classes here?

thx for any piece of advice,
Natalie

You need to modify the CMakeLists.txt file for your writer.

Use the Find_Library(...) command to find the dependent dlls and then  
use something like the following:

  #  Build the package as a plugin for ParaView.
  ADD_LIBRARY("${MODULE_NAME}" MODULE ${wrappedSrcs} ${CS_SOURCES} $ 
{PVRoboMet_SRCS} ${PVRoboMet_HEADERS})
  TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES("${MODULE_NAME}"
                      vtkClientServer
                      vtkPVServerManager
                      ${MXA_LIBRARIES}
                      ${MXA_SUPPORT_LIBRARIES}
                      ${BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY}
  )

for your plugin CmakeLists.txt.

One problem is you need the std:: prefix before string and vector.

I am afraid that the only way of doing this is to create separate
array for each component.

Message-ID: <C58CB946.6887%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The error that you are getting is actually from the "client-server" wrapper that is generating the code to marshal and unmarshal function calls between ParaView client and server.  I agree that the problem is most likely caused by the use of STL classes.  The parser does not handle these, so you will have to wrap any portion of your header using STL with //BTX & //ETX flags.  That is, have a line "//BTX" at the start of the portion you want the wrapper to ignore and a line "//ETX at the end.

BTW, when including an STL header file, you should prefix the file with vtkstd.  That is, use "#include <vtkstd/vector>" and "#include <vtkstd/string>".  The VTK build creates these special include files to help make your STL use more portable.  Also, you should prefix all of the STL classes and functions with vtkstd:: rather than std:: (or use the vtkstd namespace in you cxx file).  Again, VTK creates the vtkstd namespace to be portable to STL implementations that do not use the std namespace correctly.

Hi!
I encounter yet another problem which is, I believe, independent from the library-linking issue.
Trying to build my code (vtkVdcWriter.h and vtkVdcWriter.cxx) within paraview and expecting all the linker errors, I get the following error:

[99%] Generating vtkVdcWriterClientServer.cxx

Hi there
I just checked to lookmark and it's not what we are looking for, what we
need is more like a "macro", guessing that in paraview terminology is a
plugin

so far we have the plugin working, but the user has to load the file python
shell, which is not very user friendly, so all we have left to do is a a
file open


thanks in advance

Ken,
Yes, that's correct.  The "Meta" (.mha, .mhd) reader exists in ParaView 
(actually in VTK) and I want to load in a file series.  And that answers 
my question, i.e., ParaView will load files of the same extension using 
the new plugin reader instead of the original one.

The reason I asked was that I seem to recall earlier versions of 
ParaView always using the _first_ reader for a given file extension if 
the extension conflicted with another reader.  I assume that has been 
changed recently.  Anyway, thanks for the answer.  I didn't want to 
spend time on this if there was no hope of it working.

Is really no one interested in reading Fluent data in parallel into ParaView
apart from me ? Or am I doing something seriously wrong ?
My understanding is that this plugin should work much better than the
current reader in ParaView, am I right ?

Hi all , John, 

I have been trying without success to build the vtkCSCSFluent plugin. I have
tried to build it as a Paraview module, as a VTK module ... When trying to
genereate the makefile with cmake for the paraview module it complains
because it doesnot find a vtkCSCSFluent.pvsm.in file. 
Could anyone give me a hint on how to compile this plugin ? 

I have both VTK and ParaView CVS versions compiled. 
Thanks,
Jacques

Is there any cmake commands for me to use to tell cpack to include custom
plugins in the package. Or is there a way to change where the plugins will
be built, since currently they are being dumped into the bin folder instead
of bin/plugins?

I am interested in this, too. However I have not yet tried to build the
plugin but I will do. I miss some documentation for it. Hopfully it is
better than the current reader - this one is really poor.

Subject: [Paraview] how to work with cells having interior nodes?
Message-ID: <DF9E3669-8AC3-4443-98E0-8A0EE8023673@gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I was forced to code the cubic triangle (T10) in my finite element  
code. This element has an interior node, so I was wondering if any of  
you came across this. I was taking a look at the vtk cell types and  
the higher the triangle goes is a quadratic triangle. I tried to use  
the vtk_polygon, but I get the following error:

ERROR: In /Users/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/IO/ 
vtkXMLUnstructuredDataReader.cxx, line 653
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0x2400beb0): Cannot read cell  
connectivity from Cells in piece 0 because the "connectivity" array is  
not long enough.

I checked the connectivity array and it contains the exact number of  
cells, so I guess the problem is that paraview is not connecting those  
interior nodes. I thought that one way to solve this was to  
triangulate the T10, but that is going to take some time to code so I  
was wondering if there is a shortcut around it.

Thank you all,

Alejandro M. Arag?n

Hello,
I am facing the same issue, I do not manage to read a Fluent dataset with Paraview. According to Berk Geveci, the Fluent reader is not as good as it could be, so I was trying to find out a Fluent licence in order to convert the file in an alternative format, for instance Ensight.
As I was discovering this thread, I downloaded the plugin code and tried to compile it with VTK but the problem is that some classes, used in the plugin code, are no longer available in VTK, such as vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid.h or vtkTransformVectors.h.
May be I found an old version ("  Copyright (C) 2000, 2002 Mario Valle") at https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/vtkFluent/, so John, is there a more recent version of the plugin?

If you look at the code you will see see that in vtkCSCS root there is a 
directory called pv3-plugin
If you use the cmakelists in this directoy and enable CSCSCommon and 
CSCSFluent, it should compile.

Note that I use a customized version of paraview which is pv-meshless 
and some functions in the fluent reader might use additions to 
CleanUnstructuredGrid or vtkUnstructuredGrid etc which are not in 
paraview CVS (I have added some ifdefs I think which should make it work 
with standard paraview as well - if you encounter problems, why not 
consider fixing them, it's called open source for a very good reason).

Unfortunately, I don't have time to support every request I receive - 
which is a surprisingly large number since I have made several modules 
available so please apologise my silence on this thread until now.

The fluent reader, parses the partition table and loads in parallel, but 
I wouldn't expect you to be very impressed as in my opinion the fluent 
format is rubbish and the whole file has to be parsed in order to 
extract parts of interest. This is particularly bad if you access the 
same file from N nodes over a shared nfs like filesystem. I did spend a 
lot of time optimizing the parallel loading to ensure that memory is not 
allocated for cells that are not loaded on a particular process. In this 
respect the reader is a huge improvement over the cvs reader, parallel 
loads work very well if the number of nodes is comparable to the 
partition table size, though I have successfully loaded 12million cell 
models on desktop workstation using a single process. Your mileage may vary.

Unfortunately (or rather very fortunately, given the badness of the 
fluent format), the users who made use of this reader are switching to 
OpenFoam for future simulations, so this reader is unlikely to be 
supported further.

The code will only load volumetric cells. Boundaries can be loaded (I 
can't recall if I re-enabled them after some changes), but many of the 
fluent information/structures/types are skipped. There are many boundary 
information/types that are completely ignored. Feel free to contribute 
improvements should you implement these.

Subject: [Paraview] Confused over the term sort first and sort last
	rendering modes
Message-ID: <b05971d10901110126x166efe24x6321a20a89340b5e@mail.gmail.com>

Hie everyone,

I have managed to run my paraview on a heterogeneous cluster. I have several
questions, I ran the application on 4 nodes consisting of a quad core and
three dual cores. I included display as an option in my command, but there
were no display showed. However, when I ran paraview by using mpirun -np 4,
there were display and each portion of my dataset appeared on all the 3 dual
core nodes, the final composited image appeared on the master node, the quad
core. There was no display when I used mpirun -np 10, but the final image
did appear on my master node and it was load balanced, and each node shared
the processing load, thus I am just assuming that the display is just a
command and it does not matter whether it is included or not as the results
are the same, the end results shows the each process does its work.

I am however, confused over my rendering mode.

Am I running my paraview in a sort first or sort last rendering mode.
According to paraview's wiki page,

a) sort first
Sort first (collection): Small objects can be collected to the first node
and rendered locally. In this mode, the polygons are collected only when the
source generating them is modified. Although this collection might take
time, it is done only once and rendering is fast.

b) Sort last (distributed rendering): In this mode, first, each process
renders their scene, then these scenes are composited using the depth
buffer. This is done every render. Although this is slower for smaller
datasets, it is the only scalable solution when the dataset become large.


According to another wiki page,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_rendering
a) Sort-first rendering decomposes the final view in screen space, that is,
each contributor renders a 2D tile of the final view.[1] This mode has a
limited scalability due to the parallel overhead caused by objects rendered
on multiple tiles.
 The image to the right[image missing] shows an example of sort-first
rendering on a video wall. Each computer in the video wall renders a portion
of the viewing volume, or viewing frustum, and the final image is the
summation of the images on the monitors that make up the video wall. The
speedup comes from the fact that graphics libraries (OpenGL for example)
will clip away pixels that would appear outside of the viewing volume. This
happens very early in the graphics pipeline, which accelerates the rendering
process by eliminating the unneeded rasterization and post-processing on
primitives that will not appear anyway.
 -  I don't really understand this, but the Each computer in the video wall
renders a portion of the viewing volume seems to be like what I do

b) Sort-last rendering on the other hand decomposes the rendered database
across all rendering units, and recombines the partially rendered frames.
This modes scales the rendering very well, but the recomposition step is
expensive due to the amount of pixel data processed during recomposition.
 The image to the right[image missing] shows an example of sort-last
rendering. The computer in the top left corner is the master computer. This
means it is responsible for receiving the images created by the other
computers, and then compositing them into the final image, which it displays
on its own monitor.

I am coming to a conclusion that I am using sort last rendering,
I have included my log file here

Hi!
Very well, I used the //BTX and //ETX flags wherever I used the STL classes, but now I have another problem:
Building the code, I get the following error:

Building CXX object Plugins/CMakeFiles/VdcWriter.dir/moc_VdcWriterPluginImplementation.obj
In file included from C:\ParaviewSource\build\Plugins\VdcWriterPluginImplementation.h:38,

...

First it asked for the file pqPlugin.h , which I copied to C:/ParaviewSource/build/Plugins,
but the file QObjectList.h I do not find even in the Qt-directory. Where do I get that file from or how can I work around that?

thx,
Natalie

Re: [Paraview] error building my code






The error that you are getting is actually from the ?client-server? wrapper that is generating the code to marshal and unmarshal function calls between ParaView client and server.  I agree that the problem is most likely caused by the use of STL classes.  The parser does not handle these, so you will have to wrap any portion of your header using STL with //BTX & //ETX flags.  That is, have a line ?//BTX? at the start of the portion you want the wrapper to ignore and a line ?//ETX at the end.



BTW, when including an STL header file, you should prefix the file with vtkstd.  That is, use ?#include <vtkstd/vector>? and ?#include <vtkstd/string>?.  The VTK build creates these special include files to help make your STL use more portable.  Also, you should prefix all of the STL classes and functions with vtkstd:: rather than std:: (or use the vtkstd namespace in you cxx file).  Again, VTK creates the vtkstd namespace to be portable to STL implementations that do not use the std namespace correctly.

Hi!

I encounter yet another problem which is, I believe, independent from the library-linking issue. 

Trying to build my code (vtkVdcWriter.h and vtkVdcWriter.cxx) within paraview and expecting all the linker errors, I get the following error:



[99%] Generating vtkVdcWriterClientServer.cxx 

syntax error

***SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file C:/ParaviewSource/ParaView3/Plugins/vtkVdcWriter.h before line 49 ***

...



I believe it?s an error thrown by the Qt. Does anyone know what?s the problem here (the vtkVdcWriter.h file is posted below) or at least, how I can get an error message which is at least a bit more specific?



vtkVdcWriter.h:

#ifndef _vtkVdcWriter_h

#define _vtkVdcWriter_h



#include "vtkProcessObject.h"

#include "vtkDataSet.h"

#include <vector>

#include <string>

{

  static vtkVdcWriter *New();

  vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkVdcWriter,vtkProcessObject);

  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

 int WriteVDF(unsigned int* dims, int numts, int level, string coordsystem, string metafilename, string var);





  protected:

  vtkVdcWriter();

  ~vtkVdcWriter();



  vtkSetStringMacro(FileNameString);

  vtkSetStringMacro(MetaFileName);

  vtkSetStringMacro(DataFileName);

  char *FileNameString;

  char *MetaFileName;

  char *DataFileName;

};

#endif /* _vtkVdcWriter_h */





Could it be a problem using STL-classes here?



thx for any piece of advice,

Natalie

I am hurtling through the wild snowy wastelands of Eastern Switzerland, 
on a train that lurches from side to side as it careers it's unruly way 
through the wild mountains at breakneck pace. Strange animals leap away 
in terror as the huge metal machine streaks past - Trolls flee to their 
hideaways under bridges and the air rings with the screech of metal 
against metal as the wheels spin against the ice covered tracks.

The train emerges from a tunnel, vast long and dark, and I type vtkCSCS 
into Google, and yes (praise be) for this is a Swiss train, it has 
wireless internet, electricity, coffee and even Dancing Bears that 
parade their way up and down the aisles.

What will I discover?

Why not try it yourself. I presume that Google exists in whatever far 
corner of the earth you inhabit?

Thanks for the link.

And sorry for the google stuff. All our internet requests are processed by a google-certified troll, but he was busy looking the the new telephone number of the Wizard of Oz. Things that happen from time to time.

If you look at the code you will see see that in vtkCSCS root there is a directory called pv3-plugin If you use the cmakelists in this directoy and enable CSCSCommon and CSCSFluent, it should compile.

Note that I use a customized version of paraview which is pv-meshless and some functions in the fluent reader might use additions to CleanUnstructuredGrid or vtkUnstructuredGrid etc which are not in paraview CVS (I have added some ifdefs I think which should make it work with standard paraview as well - if you encounter problems, why not consider fixing them, it's called open source for a very good reason).

Hello,
I am facing the same issue, I do not manage to read a Fluent dataset
with Paraview. According to Berk Geveci, the Fluent reader is not as
good as it could be, so I was trying to find out a Fluent licence in
order to convert the file in an alternative format, for instance Ensight.
As I was discovering this thread, I downloaded the plugin code and
tried to compile it with VTK but the problem is that some classes,
used in the plugin code, are no longer available in VTK, such as
vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid.h or vtkTransformVectors.h.
May I only found an old version ("  Copyright (C) 2000, 2002 Mario
Valle") at https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/vtkFluent/, so
John, is there a more recent version of the plugin?
Regards.

Hi all , John,

I have been trying without success to build the vtkCSCSFluent plugin.
I have tried to build it as a Paraview module, as a VTK module ...
When trying to genereate the makefile with cmake for the paraview
module it complains because it doesnot find a
vtkCSCSFluent.pvsm.in <http://vtkCSCSFluent.pvsm.in><http://vtkCSCSFluent.pvsm.in> file.
Could anyone give me a hint on how to compile this plugin ?

I have both VTK and ParaView CVS versions compiled.
Thanks,
Jacques

Dear ParaView Community,

We have an opening for an HPC/ParaView developer to work on an EU
funded project aimed at computational steering of particle based
simulations - we intend to use ParaView for development of the
front-end controlling application.

You should not copy headers from one location to another. What you  
need to do is include the proper directory in your compilation  
command. My guess is that you are missing an include to one of the Qt  
or ParaView directories.

$QTDIR/include/QtCore/QObjectList

So it looks like you are missing the Qt directories. Is this a client  
side plugin? Are you using the following in your CMakeLists.txt file  
for the plugin:

Find_Package(Qt4)
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})

Subject: [Paraview] Confused over the term sort first and sort last
 rendering modes
In-Reply-To: <b05971d10901110126x166efe24x6321a20a89340b5e@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C590BE24.4D8B%kmorel@sandia.gov>

ParaView implements sort-last parallel rendering.  If the amount of geometry you are rendering is small, ParaView also has the ability to collect the geometry and render it wherever it is being displayed.  You could call that second mode sort-last rendering, but it is missing the screen decomposition that is usually characteristic of a true sort-first parallel rendering implementation.  The rendering mode ParaView uses is controlled by the "Remote Render Threshold" setting.

I'd rather not get into a more detailed description of sort-first/last parallel rendering or ParaView's implementation.  There are many papers on the subject.  A good place to start is the following, which outlines the ParaView client/server rendering framework:

Andy Cedilnik, Berk Geveci, Kenneth Moreland, James Ahrens, and Jean Favre. "Remote Large Data Visualization in the ParaView Framework." In Eurographics Parallel Graphics and Visualization 2006, pg. 163-170, May 2006.

Hie everyone,

I have managed to run my paraview on a heterogeneous cluster. I have several questions, I ran the application on 4 nodes consisting of a quad core and three dual cores. I included display as an option in my command, but there were no display showed. However, when I ran paraview by using mpirun -np 4, there were display and each portion of my dataset appeared on all the 3 dual core nodes, the final composited image appeared on the master node, the quad core. There was no display when I used mpirun -np 10, but the final image did appear on my master node and it was load balanced, and each node shared the processing load, thus I am just assuming that the display is just a command and it does not matter whether it is included or not as the results are the same, the end results shows the each process does its work.

I am however, confused over my rendering mode.

Am I running my paraview in a sort first or sort last rendering mode.
According to paraview's wiki page,

a) sort first
Sort first (collection): Small objects can be collected to the first node and rendered locally. In this mode, the polygons are collected only when the source generating them is modified. Although this collection might take time, it is done only once and rendering is fast.

b) Sort last (distributed rendering): In this mode, first, each process renders their scene, then these scenes are composited using the depth buffer. This is done every render. Although this is slower for smaller datasets, it is the only scalable solution when the dataset become large.


According to another wiki page, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_rendering
a) Sort-first rendering decomposes the final view in screen space, that is, each contributor renders a 2D tile of the final view.[1] This mode has a limited scalability due to the parallel overhead caused by objects rendered on multiple tiles.
The image to the right[image missing] shows an example of sort-first rendering on a video wall. Each computer in the video wall renders a portion of the viewing volume, or viewing frustum, and the final image is the summation of the images on the monitors that make up the video wall. The speedup comes from the fact that graphics libraries (OpenGL for example) will clip away pixels that would appear outside of the viewing volume. This happens very early in the graphics pipeline, which accelerates the rendering process by eliminating the unneeded rasterization and post-processing on primitives that will not appear anyway.
-  I don't really understand this, but the Each computer in the video wall renders a portion of the viewing volume seems to be like what I do

b) Sort-last rendering on the other hand decomposes the rendered database across all rendering units, and recombines the partially rendered frames. This modes scales the rendering very well, but the recomposition step is expensive due to the amount of pixel data processed during recomposition.
The image to the right[image missing] shows an example of sort-last rendering. The computer in the top left corner is the master computer. This means it is responsible for receiving the images created by the other computers, and then compositing them into the final image, which it displays on its own monitor.

I am coming to a conclusion that I am using sort last rendering,
I have included my log file here

Hi Louise,

I'm afraid not. I don't have the data anymore because it was big (the cube colors are defined by processor ID;) maybe I could find a smaller version. The focus of making those images was in the python scripting and (python) programmable filter, and both of those capabilities have evolved significantly since then, so I would generate the same images in a different way now. In that sense the source code is not so useful anyway.

If you are just starting with paraview, there are publicly available sample datasets you can play around with, as well as tutorial slides to guide you. If you have specific questions on what paraview can do, or how to make a particular visualization, this list is a good place to get answers. But because paraview is fairly easy to learn just by experimenting, most of the questions here tend to be more advanced.

That would be so cool, if you could reconstruct it =)

Why are the sides curved? To make it look cute?

I was amazed how well designed Paraview's UI was. I had expected
something like PovRay [0], which is hard to learn.

I would really like to play around with your coloured cube plot, so I
hope something can be worked out =)

I read the documentation on the wiki about how to create a 
custom view, and I think this is my start point. Is that 
true ? if yes, from witch class should myView inherits

How my pqMyView class will be linked to my vtkMyFilter

Thank you,

Are you creating new new view for your filter, or do you want to
simply show the output of the new filter in the current "BarChart"
view used by the Histogram filter?

If you are creating a totally new view, simply start by subclassing pqView.
In the filter's XML you can use a hint as follows to indicate to
ParaView which view to create by default for the filter.

    <Hints>
        <!-- View can be used to specify the preferred view for the proxy -->
        <View type="MyViewsXMLName" />
     </Hints>

Nehme,

It sounds like you do not need to create a custom view.  You should be able to create a filter that generates the data and then use the existing bar chart and x-y plot views.  You can specify a "Hint" in the server manager xml for a filter to tell it which view to go to.  See the implementation of vtkPExtractHistogram and the corresponding ExtractHistogram entry in filters.xml for more details.

When I sent out my original email, I had already checked into CVS the
gradient filter optimization.  This morning I checked in another change that
allows you to run a faster but less accurate algorithm to get the point

Hi everyone.
I am trying to use paraview for side by side stereo display. I understand
that I can link cameras between two display areas. The problem is that I
don't know how to set a constant offset (like the distance between two eyes)
of camera position for two linked cameras.  Dose anybody have any idea?
Thanks very much!

Hi,

I am developing a helper class that do some prefiltering to remove 
constraints on the filters (need of point data instead of cell data for 
instance).
It provides warnings when an interpolation is performed, but should allow 
to have all the filters available at any time.
The pb I am now facing is that it seems that the constraints specified in 
the server xml are never removed in the inherited proxies. A typical usage 
is :

vtkInterpolatedContour is a class that can take point or cell centered 
data and pre-interpolate it internally to point-centered data if needed.

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="filters">
    <SourceProxy
                 name="InterpolatedContour"
                 base_proxygroup="filters"
                 base_proxyname="Contour"
                 class="vtkInterpolatedContour"
                 label="InterpolatedContour">

      <InputProperty
         name="Input"
         command="SetInputConnection">
        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
          <Group name="sources"/>
          <Group name="filters"/>
        </ProxyGroupDomain>
        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
          <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
        </DataTypeDomain>
<!-- I DISABLE THE ATTRIBUTE_TYPE HERE, BUT PARAVIEW STILL REQUIRES POINT 
CENTERED DATA -->
        <!--<InputArrayDomain name="input_array" attribute_type="point"
                          number_of_components="1"/>-->
      </InputProperty>

    </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

I can copy paste and modify the whole xml from the contour filter, but it 
seems to me that would be nicer to be able to use the base_proxy 
mechanism, any idea?

Best regards,
Stephane

Stephane,

Unfortunately such more involved control for inheritance is not
provided by ParaView, hence you'll have to go with copying the xml and
changing it. The base_proxy mechanism is very simple (to say the
least), it does not support overriding anything (including
properties/domains) defined by the base _proxy.

Hello,

Unlike the release versions, the trunk version doesn't install shared
libraries with make install. Is there a way to turn this on?

thanks

Hi everybody!
 
I am also new to this forum and new to paraview and python coding.
 
I am currently looking to create an animation of shallow water waves using paraview, but I am having some trouble uploading my data files.
At this stage, my data files are in excel files (.xls) and I am just wondering how I should go about converting them to paraview data files (.pvd) or the like, so that I may create an animation.
 
Any help would be much appreciated.
 
Jamie.

Hi Paraviewers.
I guess that I didn't make my question clear in my last email. Here comes
two specific questions:
1. I have tried camera link and property link separately to do my job. If I
use camera link to link the camears in two views, after I rotate the camera
in one view, the other camera will update itself automatically (The two
views are exactly the same at all time). However, if I use property link,
the other camera won't update itself unless I click on its view area (It
needs focus to update). For property link, I only link two properties:
"CameraPosition" and "CameraViewUp". Is there a way that I can make the
other camera update itself automatically?
2. I can't find any CameraRotation property, is there a way to link the
rotation matrix of camera in different views? That means, the two different
cameras in the two different views will multiply the same rotation matrix
after a rotation.
Thanks very much for your time!

You will probably have to write some sort of custom reader for your  
data. This can be just a simple stand-alone program that converts your  
data into the .pvd file or you can make the reader a ParaView plugin  
so that ParaView can open your data file(s).

The first thing you will probably want to do is export the data from  
excel into a CSV file for easier reading.

Next you can write the code for your reader. If you can give some more  
information about what exactly the data in the xls files represents  
the community may be able to guide you further. For example is the  
data xyz coordinates for a triangular mesh? Is it voxel data? Is it  
image data?

There are lots of examples for all of those around the net and from  
various folks on the list (including myself).

Cheers

Mike, 
 
Thanks for your reply and assistance so far! To be more specific, our data is a 1-dimensional times series of water suface elevations. At each time step we have water heights recorded for the length of the computational domain. The columns in our excel file represents the changing water profile for each time step and the rows represent the spatial step. The aim is to generate a 2D animation showing a wave propagating along the computational domain.
 
Cheers,
Jamie.

Hi,

Just an idea: It seems that the error message warns about typo... Are
you sure it is "translation" and not "Translation" ?

Hi all,

   I am switching from Paraview 3.2.1 to 3.4.0. It seems that the appearance
of the color legend has changed.
The new style has the maximum and minimum values displayed (attached as
newstyle.png), which is not what I want. Is it a way to go back to the old
style with 3.4.0, which just has a series even-spaced values (attached as
oldstyle.png)?

Thanks,
Mengda

Message-ID: <20090114112950.5qpu5hxs044ocooo@webpers.univ-valenciennes.fr>

Hi all,

I'm able to import some very simple csv file but can't animate them in time.
Say for example that I have a serie of csv files like this:

file_1.csv
file_2.csv
file_3.csv
file_4.csv

When I want to import them Paraview show them as a file series in the  
open-file panel, import is ok but I can't animate them.

Is animation not supported for those csv files ?

How can I convert them to vtk file format ?
I know how to do this for 2d or 3D data set but not for simple 1D DATA  
... don't find some good info on the last one

Here is an example of one of my csv file where X is the spatial  
coordinate, C the concentration of a scalar and U the magnitude of a  
velocity

  X(m),C,U
  0.20000000E+01, 0.69499998E+01, 0.57000003E+01
  0.21000001E+01, 0.79500017E+01, 0.58000002E+01

Hello everyone!

 

ParaView is very interesting program!

 

Two small questions: 

1. Is any possibility to format text or to insert some math symbols?

Like this: \epsilon or fm^3.

 

2. Is any possibility to change color legend extremely,

 for example, to do nonlinear fragmentation? 

 

How can someone insert an image to animation?

 

Thanks to community.

Hi all,
Is there in ParaView3 an image slicer that slices along a track ?
Explanation: I have a vtkPolyData that contains one polyline. This
vtkPolyData is embedded in a volume vtkImageData. I would like to get
a slice of the volume at each polydata point, oriented by the tangent
of the line.

I think I would be able to write my own filter, but I wonder if there
already exists a way for doing that, maybe by using correctly the
paraview slicer?

Thank you!

/usr/bin/ld: /home/th/lib/Linux-x86_64/libgdif2.a(Block.o): relocation  
R_X86_64_32S
against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object;  
recompile with -fPIC
/home/th/lib/Linux-x86_64/libgdif2.a: could not read symbols: Bad value

After recompiling the external library with -fPIC enabled and the  
plugin code as well,
the error still remains unchanged.
Has someone else encounter this problem?

Best regards

Subject: [Paraview] Add support for PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS?
Message-ID: <496DEC98.5000202@cscs.ch>

There used to be a PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES - which allowed you 
to compile modules into paraview - in fact it still exists, but probably 
nobody uses it any more since plugins have improved so much.

I have some users who want to compile paraview, and a couple of selected 
plugins, and then do a single "make install"

I've added PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS to the main paraview cmake, 
which allows you to enter

vtkCSCSCommon;vtkCSCSFluent;vtkCSCSNetCDF etc etc etc

and then it prompts for paths to the sources, and compiles them at the 
same time as paraview itself.

Does anyone else need this functionality? Shall I add it to cvs? It's 
very simple - but does make life easier for the less experienced users 
(to manage one build instead of two).

JB

Your two follow-up questions seem to have nothing to do with the original question.  For the initial question, no there is no way to link cameras with a constant offset.  I don't have any good ideas how to do it, but I would recommend getting the one of ParaView's stereo modes to work.

As for the follow-up questions:

1. There is some specialness with the camera link that causes the renders to be synchronized along with the camera parameters.  I know of no easy way to do the same thing with property links (perhaps someone else knows some magic).  I'm not sure why you want to.  What is the point of implementing a camera link with property links?

2. There is no CameraRotation property.  I'll try not to spark a debate on why that is; suffice it to say that the underlying vtkCamera has no such support.

Hi Paraviewers.
I guess that I didn't make my question clear in my last email. Here comes two specific questions:
 1. I have tried camera link and property link separately to do my job. If I use camera link to link the camears in two views, after I rotate the camera in one view, the other camera will update itself automatically (The two views are exactly the same at all time). However, if I use property link, the other camera won't update itself unless I click on its view area (It needs focus to update). For property link, I only link two properties: "CameraPosition" and "CameraViewUp". Is there a way that I can make the other camera update itself automatically?
2. I can't find any CameraRotation property, is there a way to link the rotation matrix of camera in different views? That means, the two different cameras in the two different views will multiply the same rotation matrix after a rotation.
Thanks very much for your time!

Hi everyone.
I am trying to use paraview for side by side stereo display. I understand that I can link cameras between two display areas. The problem is that I don't know how to set a constant offset (like the distance between two eyes) of camera position for two linked cameras.  Dose anybody have any idea? Thanks very much!

Yes.  Open the view settings for the plot view (that button on the thin toolbar right above the view, third from the left).  Click on Left Axis -> Layout, then select Specify the Axis Range and set the Axis Range to what you want it fixed to.

Francois,

I've just committed a fix to the CVS head to make it possible to read
a file-series of CSV files so that one can animate through them.

That is not is ParaView anymore? When did it go away? I use it all the  
time and recommend it to my first time users to compile their own  
filters. I would vote to keep the functionality if it is not causing  
problems for other parts of the build.

Why was it removed? Is it removed in CVS or 3.4?

Read again carefully and this time look for the "in fact it still 
exists, but probably nobody uses it any more since plugins have improved 
so much" - I actually use it myself, so I'm playing deveils advocate, 
but I like plugins better now...

Oh.. Knee Jerk Reaction.. I guess I still need that cup of coffee yet

Yes. I use it. Yes I would like it to stay if it does not cause any  
problems.

In-Reply-To: <1c02becc0901140033t7eb3c9ecnd7844c497168d73b@mail.gmail.com>

First, I observe that you must not be using 3.4.0, because the new color legend is not is that version.  The new color legend is only in the CVS trunk and will be in the next release of ParaView.

Second, I'm not sure why you have an aversion to the new scalar bar.  It is designed to be more readable.  Your complaint centers around the minimum and maximum values being displayed, but both styles show the minimum and maximum.  The only difference is that the old style shows less precision in the numbers.  Note that if you round the min/max numbers to the hundredths place you get the numbers in the old style.

If you wish to continue to fool yourself with less precision, you can open the color scale editor, open the color legend tab, unclick Automatic Label Format, and insert any precision that you like.  You can also change the range of the scalar bar to anything that you like.

Hi all,

   I am switching from Paraview 3.2.1 to 3.4.0. It seems that the appearance of the color legend has changed.
The new style has the maximum and minimum values displayed (attached as newstyle.png), which is not what I want. Is it a way to go back to the old style with 3.4.0, which just has a series even-spaced values (attached as oldstyle.png)?

Thanks,
Mengda

Subject: [Paraview] Csv files and time series
In-Reply-To: <20090114112950.5qpu5hxs044ocooo@webpers.univ-valenciennes.fr>
Message-ID: <C5934841.4EA6%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Right now the csv file reader is only designed to read a single file at a time (the file browser naively groups them regardless).  On solution around this is to write a python script to iteratively read the files.  A better solution, IMHO, is to use the file series reader meta-reader to convert the csv reader to read file series as time series.  This Wiki page explains how to do create the server manager XML for that, which can then be used in a ParaView plugin.

  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Restarted_Simulation_Readers#Collection_of_Files

Here is a larger question for the group: Should we change the CVS reader in ParaView to be a file series reader?

Hi all,

I'm able to import some very simple csv file but can't animate them in time.
Say for example that I have a serie of csv files like this:

file_1.csv
file_2.csv
file_3.csv
file_4.csv

When I want to import them Paraview show them as a file series in the
open-file panel, import is ok but I can't animate them.

Is animation not supported for those csv files ?

How can I convert them to vtk file format ?
I know how to do this for 2d or 3D data set but not for simple 1D DATA

Here is an example of one of my csv file where X is the spatial

That's an incorrect syntax, you are probably trying to do the following:

reader = servermanager.sources.vrmlreader(FileName = "/home/jmazo/car.wrl")

* note the " ... FileName= ..."

No.  At least not yet.  There is currently a minor project to add the font
support for this, but then someone still needs to implement a way of
defining the symbols in the GUI.

I'm not sure what you mean by nonlinear fragmentation, but the scalar bar is
what it is.  The best you can do is insert control points in the color scale
editor to create nonlinear changes.

You can load an image and show it in any 3D view.  If you need to turn the
image on and off during the animation, you can animate the visible property
of the image.

John,

You should talk to Tim Shead.  As part of his OverView work, he is implementing a mechanism is ParaView in which you can define a set of plugins which you want loaded upon program startup.  The vision is that one day the ParaView application will really be an empty shell the defines its GUI and implementation by opening a set of predefined plugins.

My point is that PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS may be unnecessary and at some point may be obsolete.

I've added PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS to the main paraview cmake,
which allows you to enter

vtkCSCSCommon;vtkCSCSFluent;vtkCSCSNetCDF etc etc etc

and then it prompts for paths to the sources, and compiles them at the
same time as paraview itself.

Does anyone else need this functionality? Shall I add it to cvs? It's
very simple - but does make life easier for the less experienced users
(to manage one build instead of two).

Attached is an example script. "Transform" property on the
TransformFilter is a proxy property that takes either the (transforms,
Transform) or (transforms, Transform2) proxy. These proxies have
properties to affect the transform as illustrated in the attached

Thanks all for your kind answer it's very nice from you.

I'm new to Paraview and the solution to use the file series reader  
meta-reader to convert the csv reader to read file series as time  
series is too complex for me.

I agree with you perhaps it's a good idea to change the CSV reader in  
ParaView to be a file series reader

I think I will look at the CSV to VTK file format conversion, if  
someone as an idea for such simple 1D DATA ?

Thank your very much Utkarsh and Ken for your help.

Regards
Francois

PS: Do you know when the 3.5 or 3.6 version of Paraview will be released ?

PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES is useful when deploying ParaView with
 extensions on a platform that does not support shared libraries (for
example Cray Xts and IBM Blue Genes).

I don't think mha support time natively. I am cc'ing the vtk users

as long as the images are of the same dimensions, should be fairly
easy. Would that do the trick?

Perhaps Tim's plugins should also have an option to compile in statically.  There is a lot of interest in running infovis capabilities on these platforms.

PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES is useful when deploying ParaView with
 extensions on a platform that does not support shared libraries (for
example Cray Xts and IBM Blue Genes).

Writing out a series of legacy VTK files (one per time step) should be
fairly easy. I would write this as a polydata using the polylines cell
type. The documentation for the legacy format is at
http://vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf See this page for information
about animating series of VTK files:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series

To my knowledge, such filter does not exist. However, it would be
fairly easy to do this using the Programmable Filter.

I sooo missed the subtle difference between  
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES and PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS.  
My eyes just saw what they wanted to see and the brain didn't process  
it correctly.


So how does this mechanism work? Do I still need to have a  
*ParaViewImport.cmake file in my EXTERNAL_MODULE? Currently most of my  
EXTERNAL_MODULES are compiled into the vtkPVFilters library, what is  
the difference between setting my Module as a  
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES vs PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS?

EXTERNAL_MODULES : the source files are added to the target for 
pvfilters. They might be static or dynamic, depending on how your build 
is configured. The code is compiled into pvfilters, the core of paraview.
CMake picks up the file 'NAME'ParaViewImport.cmake and uses it for the 
sources

EXTERNAL_PLUGINS : when BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ON the source directory for 
each plugin is supplied and the MACRO "add_paraview_plugin" is called 
for each plugin listed passing the source directory in. The 
CmakeLists.txt file in the directory is used, just as if you were 
compiling the plugin separately. The plugin is added as a separate 
target to the paraview build, and appears just like all those 
overview/prism plugins that are gradually appearing in the build.

I develop custom plugins for several institutions (each one has 
different plugins), and each time I compile paraview for them, I then 
compile the plugins they need afterwards. Each time, they ask, "why 
can't you just compile the plugins at the same time as paraview". Well 
now I can. I could have used the EXTERNAL_MODULES feature as well, but 
as you have seen from emails on this list, there are Fluent, netCDF, 
OpenDX, blah vlah blah modules out there and many other people weant to 
use them too and expect to be able to compile the as plugins, not as 
internal modules. Plugins are in general easier to manage and I don't 
want to maintain multiple cmakelists files

Currently I have 3 setf for each module, and maintaining them is a pain.
1) compile as a vtk filter, (use cmakelists.txt)
2) compile as a plugin (use pv3-plugin/cmakelists.txt)
3) compiles as external_module into paraview (use 
'NAME'ParaViewImport.cmake)

too much work.
3) is no longer required by me.
2) is nice because changing a plugin is a quicker make than changing 
paraview source
2) also allows me to use my new external_plugins to compile at 
pv-compile time just like I used to with 3)

I hope this thread is finished now.

JB

Awesome. I have the same issues with keeping 2 CMake files for each  
plugin. This eliminates that need and is less work for me. I vote keep  
it/put it in.

Thanks for the excellent explanation.

Just to fill-in some details ... if you take a look at 
Applications/OverView/CMakeLists.txt, you can see the new OverView 
"Branding" mechanism at work.  The idea is to enable OverView clients 
that allow for some minor customization of the user interface (such as 
substituting your own name, version number, and logo) and incorporate a 
specific set of plugins that will be automatically loaded at runtime (so 
end-users don't have to put them in a special directory, set 
PV_PLUGIN_PATH, or use the plugin manager to load them).

This mechanism can also be used outside the ParaView build, which allows 
us to create custom OverView clients incorporating plugins that aren't 
part of the ParaView source tree.  This approach could be a viable 
alternative to PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS, if we updated the 
ParaView client to use the same branding mechanism as OverView (which 
would be a trivial set of code changes).  This approach is advantageous 
as your external plugin builds become more complex.

Cheers,
Tim

I am really intrested in using this feature, does anybody have an example of
using PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES with a custom GUI?

John,

I think this would be a very good idea.

So if I put
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS : vtkCSCSFluent
then it will prompt for a path and I just give it the path to the source for
example : vtkCSCS/vtkFluentvtkCSCS/
I assume that it will then use the cmake file that's in
vtkCSCS/vtkFluent/pv3-plugin ?

So am I right to assume that in order to use the same methodology with my
plugins I should put a cmake file in a directory called pv3-plugin ?

Regards,
Jacques

Thanks for your reply Ken.
I am not trying to implement a camera link with property links. I just use
it as an example. The point I was trying to make is how to synchronize the
properties of two views.
The relationship between my two follow-up questions is that if there is a
way to synchronize property links, I can use CameraViewUp and CameraRotation
(my second question) property links to link cameras with a constant offset.
Sorry for the confusions and Thanks again.

Aaron

Hi there is there a way to create a GUIToolbar icon in python

or is there to write a XML "view", that trows the data parameters to a
python script, instead of c++ classes,
pretty much like the helix.xml plugin example.

btw how can I "hide" the

Good evening,

I'm trying to import a text file in order to superimpose the results  
with some OpenFOAM results.
I'm using a python script to read the text file; however, the basic  
script provided at
http://cmake.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters
fails at pdo = self.GetOutput() :

Traceback (most recent call last):

     pdo = self.GetOutput()
NameError: name 'self' is not defined

Not sure what is wrong - any idea ?

Best regards,

Hi there

I have a python script that does a lot of stuff to some vrml files, it
works perfect if its ran from the paraview python shell,
but when I run it from outside paraview, the script runs, but it does
not visualizes anything. I dont how to tell python to use the
"open" paraview.
I also tried to create a server pvserver, connect my script to that
server and then I opened paraview and connected it to that server

but I keep getting

"The startup command failed to start ... check your PATH and file permissions"

what should my PATH have?

thanks in advance

Hi,

I updated and built my copy of cvs head for the first time this
year. Unfortunately, it gets immediate crash after opening the main
window at vtkCarbonRenderWindow::UpdateGLRegion(). Here's a part of
gdb backtrace output:

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.

However, if I revert ParaView3/VTK/Rendering/vtkCarbonRenderWindow.cxx
from the current revision of 1.75 to revision 1.74, I get a compiler
waring about a deprecated API but the produced binary runs fine. So
I'm wondering if the compiler warning fix

COMP: fixed compiler warning related to bug 4001, by conditionally using newer n

of vtkCarbonRenderWindow.cxx is really correct.

Am I the only one who is having this problem? I'm using an Intel Mac

thanks for the tips. I will work from this. earlier I've tried to do

dir(servermanager.sources)

but didn't find ensight (I think my brain was on loop trying to find 
'insight')

Hello,

meanwhile my colleague (oliver.borm at web.de) and I found a possible solution for the attached problem. One way to instance a new transform filter is using the function NewProxy() to instance the Transform Property

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*

import sys
sys.path.insert(0 ,"/usr/lib/paraview-3.4")
from paraview import servermanager

sm=servermanager
sm.Connect()

#create simple cone
cone = sm.sources.ConeSource()

#create transform filter 
transF = sm.filters.TransformFilter( Input = cone)

#Instance Transform Property with NewProxy()
transF.Transform = sm.servermanger.Proxymanager().SMProxyManager().NewProxy("transforms","Transform2")

#for example, set Rotation or Position Property
transF.Transform.GetData().SetPropertyWithName("Rotation",[0.0,90.0,0.0])
transF.Transform.GetData().SetPropertyWithName("Position",[1.0,5.0,0.0])

Regards, Tobias.

    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0 ,"/usr/lib/paraview-3.3")
    from paraview import servermanager

    sm=servermanager
    sm.Connect()

    #create simple cone
    cone = sm.sources.ConeSource()

    #create transform filter
    transF = sm.filters.TransformFilter( Input = cone)

#debug
print transF.Transform
print type(transF.Transform)

Actually the transform filter  doesn't d o anything  since  the
proxyProperty transF.Transform has no value.
I tried to set a sm.vtk.vtkTransform -object  to  the  transF.Transform
Property but unfortunately it does not work:


>>> >>> trafo = sm.vtk.vtkTransform()
>>> >>> transF.Transform = trafo
>>>       
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/paraview-3.3/paraview/servermanager.py", line 1503, in

SetData
    self.SMProperty.AddProxy(value_proxy)
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

I guess the types  of  both  objects do not match.

Maybe anybody knows how to set an appropriate transform value to the
TransformFilter's Property Transform.

Thanks a lot  for  your attention, Tobias

I'm assuming you are building a 32-bit binary (because there is no 64-bit
Carbon to link to....)

Sean, would you mind (1) fixing this or (2) reverting your
vtkCarbonRenderWindow change of 1.75 until somebody can figure out what it
takes to fix this...?

I think we should view vtkCarbonRenderWindow itself as largely deprecated
and just ignore deprecation warnings from within it... Cocoa will be the new
order of the day after the upcoming Qt 4.5 kinks are worked out...


Thanks,
David

It will use the CMakeLists.txt file in the path supplied, so you would 
(in this case) supply vtkCSCS/vtkFluentvtkCSCS/pv3-plugin

Only if you still need another CMakeLists file somewhere else. I use a 
pv3-plugin directory for my plugin cmakelists files just because I can't 
have two in the main directory. If I don't need to compile the classes 
against standard vtk or some other project, then there's no need for a 
plugin specific location.

Note that I have not checked in my changes to cvs paraview. And after 
reading Tim's email, I may not bother. I'll follow the Overview/Branding 
developments for now.

Subject: [Paraview] Writer Plugin cannot be loaded
Message-ID: <BAY122-W50AA283DAAF4959BA74524BCD70@phx.gbl>


Hi!

I have written a Writer-Plugin and after (at last) successfully compiling and linking it within Paraview, I tried to load it with the PluginManager,
and in the Paraview/build/bin directory I found my libVdcWriter.so, but loading fails. I get the error message: "libVdcWriter.so: no such file or directory"
But the file is in the build/bin - directory, the plugin-manager-browser found it! 
Does anyone know what could be the problem here? Is it possible that I missed to link something, any library from paraview so that this plugin can be loaded?

and by the way, a stupid question: linux .so - files are equivalent to windows .dll-files, true? so while I?m loading my plugins as .dlls in windows, with linux they have the ending .so, right? 

thx a lot,
Natalie Happenhofer

Ok,
maybe this is the reason for the problem:
Building Paraview I just run "make" - and I do have to run "make install" too,don?t I? Is it "make install" on linux? (Under Windos I run "mingw32-make" and
"mingw32-make install")

Well, running "make install" I get the following error:

[100%] Built target PrismClientPlugin
Install the project...
-- Install configuration: "Release"

How can I set the permissions correctly? Or does the root-user have to do that?

Thx a lot,
Natalie

Yes indeed, you have to be root for that. "make install" copies files
into /usr/.../lib... which simple users cannot.
you can maybe use this command:

> sudo make install

Hope this helps.

Has your ParaView been built with the same compiler as your plugin?

Yes it's a 32-bit binary as far as I understand in the same way.

You cannot make an external python interpretor or pvpython control an
separate paraview process. To be able to affect ParaView GUI through
python you have to use the python shell provided by the GUI.

Where are you typing the python script: the python shell or the
"Script" parameter for the Programmable Filter/Programmable Source?

 * Well, in your "view" plugin, you can create a new vtkSMViewProxy
subclass that passes parameters to an internal python interpretor.
Otherwise however, there's no direct way of doing this.

> btw how can I "hide" the ...from the helix source plugin!!!

* To hide any property use the "show" hint as under:

    <Property name="Script" show="0" />
    <!-- this will not show the "Script" property in the GUI -->

You can control where the install is located. It's common under linux to 
use a configure option called --prefix=/some/path. In paraview you can 
set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to a folder that you own. You shouldn't have to 
do an install to get your plugin working.

 These scripts are meant to be used at values for the Script paramater
for Programmable Filter or Programmable Source as identified by the
title. These will not directly work from the python shell or pvpython.
Create a "Programmable Source" from the "Sources" menu in the ParaView
GUI and try pasting the script in the "Script" entry box on the
Paramaters panel.

It sounds like the dynamic linker/loader , ld, isn't finding your 
libVdcWriter.so library. first you can verify by running ldd on your 
plugin and searching for "not found". like this:

ldd /path/to/libMyPlugin.so | grep "not found"

This will list the libraries that are not found. There are a number of 
ways to remedy such an issue. The easiest (especially for debugging 
purposes) is to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH on the command line to add locations 
to ld's search path. You know where the missing library is located then 
you can run paraview like this:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/missing/lib/folder /path/to/paraview

or you can export this variable in your shell.

Subject: [Paraview] Calling a vtk filter from my custom filter
Message-ID: <422661.44970.qm@web110102.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi ParaView Community,

I'm programming a filter, and I would like to call the vtkExtractEdges filter from it. Since my filter acts on vtkPolyData, it extends vtkPolyDataAlgorithm.

The problem is, the requestData() method of all filters are made protected, so that only derived classes are able to call it. Hence, I can't see how can I call this method from inside the body of my filter's code. 

What's the usual way to do things such this ? 

Thanks in advance,
Rafael March.

You can instantiate the vtkExtractEdges filter and connect it to
shallow copy of your input (don't directly connect the input to avoid
nasty pipleine update issues) and then call Update() on the
vtkExtractEdges to make it execute. Then you can shallow copy
vtkExtractEdges' output to your own or further processes it.

That is by design.  The min/max labels are placed where they can be shown
with the maximum amount of precision (so that you get the most accurate
account of what the range is).

The field is working, but it really means the maximum number of (non
min/max) labels.  It will show less if it means the labels will be more
readable.  You have to bump up the number of labels to 11 before you get to
the next increment that the color bar will allow.  I changed the label next
to the field to better reflect what it means.

Note that the point of the changes to the scalar bar are to make it more
readable.  Even with only 5 labels, you can quickly pinpoint the color
precisely to the thousands place using the minor tick marks.  That's way
better than you could with the old labels.

Now I see that I didn't look close enough at your patch, as I thought it 
was handling the case of apps without HIViews.  Sorry.

Here's what I think needs to happen.
In vtkCarbonRenderWindow::CreateAWindow(),
aglSetDrawable is replaced with aglSetWindowRef only if WindowId is 
NULL, and replaced with aglSetHIViewRef if WindowID is not NULL.  
ParaView needs aglSetHIViewRef, not aglSetWindowRef.

Then in vtkCarbonRenderWindow::UpdateGLRegion(), if WindowId != NULL and 
10.5 is the minimum version of OSX, skip all 100 or so lines of code and 
only call aglUpdateContext().
By calling aglSetHIViewRef, we're giving them enough data to do all of 
the code that happens in vtkCarbonRenderWindow::UpdateGLRegion(), so I'm 
assuming their implementation does that and we simply call 
aglUpdateContext(), and not have to go through the work of doing 
clipping based on other overlapping views.  And when skipping all 100 
lines of code, we're also skipping almost all of the deprecated apis.

If you make these changes, I'd test with ParaView, and a few random VTK 
tests, the Tk examples in the VTK tests, and the Qt examples with Qt3 
and Qt4, to test all the different code paths.  Its a bit complicated 
that it has to support apps with and without  HIViews.

I think at some time it would be good to make these changes.  Carbon 
apps aren't going away very soon.  And I've been curious if it'll help 
performance a bit not having to call all that old code.
Even Qt 4.5 uses Carbon by default, and it requires a configure switch 
to use Cocoa instead.

Message-ID: <704f3c640901151124u6a4d30a9j7b541042ed5025e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there

I'm developing a pythong plugin. I'm using tkinter for some quick
input, so far it works

I can do a tkFileDialog.askopenfilename()

but after the tkdialog is opened the paraview menu is gone.

all is left is a console window (empty)
and in the menu there is Paraview, FILE, EDIT

If I click on Paraview there is an "about TCL/TK" option

so my question is:

How do I "mix" tk in paraview without losing the menus (filters,
tools, etc,etc,)

has anyone tried this

thanks

Sorry I cannot reproduce your problem. I just loaded your csv file
with the CSV reader code from the Wiki and it worked as expected.

With CVS ParaView, you can directly load a CSV file and the apply
"Table to Points' filter to interpret the CSV data as a set of points.

Sounds like a plan, and I agree it's worthwhile since Carbon will still
be around for a long time, but as I don't personally use it, I don't
think I'll have the time in the near term.  I'd be happy to test
anything you come up with though.

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Averages over Selections of Sliced Areas
Message-ID: <20090116072056.112040@gmx.net>

Dear Paraview Users

I have been using ParaView for some time now, but am unsure of how to calculate averages over certain areas. Picture1 shows a side-view of an incineration vessel. It has several passes, some of them with separation walls. Picture2 depicts a horizontal slice of it.
I would like to calculate average values (e.g. of velocity, temperature, etc.) of some of these SUB-areas of the slice. In addition, very near to the walls, there is the wall effect. I would for instance calculate the averages of the subareas, excluding the values nearer than 100 mm to the walls.

1) How can I calculate the averages of the sub-areas?
2) How can I calculate the averages of the sub-areas, excluding the wall-effect boundary zone?

Thank you very much for your help!
Maurice

Hi,

I wonder how I can add the "slice" slider of a slice representation in
the representation toolbar. First, is it possible within a plugin ? If
not, I can make changes in ParaView source code, but I didn't find how
the combo box for the representation is added, so I cannot do the same
!

Thanks a lot,

Jerome,

It's definitely possible using a plugin to create a new toolbar that
acts as both the representation chooser as well as slice selector.
Look at the toolbar plugin example on the Wiki and then look at
pqDisplayRepresentationWidget ( in
Qt/Components/pqDisplayRepresentationWidget.h|cxx) to see the code for
the  current representation toolbar.

pqDisplayRepresentationWidget is indeed the representation toolbar, so
for simply changing the source code, that's the one you should be
looking at.

Message-ID: <1b61cab90901160655j251f208fpb885cf29ec4f4fce@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to build a parallel pvserver on Mac OS X 10.5.6 (Intel) with
paraview-3.4.0 and MPICH2, which fails as follows. It seems that
ccmake cannot find MPI libraries, but I'm sure that the parameters
point correct locations of the libraries. Also, I've confirmed that
MPICH2 are correctly installed on the system. (I also tried the CVS
source, which failed in the same way.)
Could anyone give me suggestions?

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Building parallel pvserver with MPICH2 on Mac OS X

Try adding libpmpich.a to the MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:

MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
/opt/local/lib/libmpich.a;/opt/local/lib/libpmpich.a

By the way, unless you are building ParaView statically, I recommend
using shared MPI libraries as well.

This is a very cool challenge :-)

(1) is pretty easy. After the slice filter, apply the Connectivity
filter. This will create a new array called RegionId, which will be
different for each region. You can the use the threshold filter or the
selection mechanism to extract one of these regions.

Now (2) is more fun. Is there any way of quantifying the regions that
are outside the boundary zone? Is it based on distance? The value of
some other variable?

Subject: [Paraview] TransformFilter from python
Message-ID: <704f3c640901160934t21be4e27u5a7cfa71f6a40ec5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there

I'm having problems trying to use the TransforFilter, so far I can
transform objects
but when I create a filter from python and register the proxy, the
object inspenctor shows nothing

and I got this error "paraview Selected proxy value not in the list:  Transform"

then

I found this

http://markmail.org/message/rfd75oj74fk4u4v7

that is a similar problem, but that solution seems to crash paraview

this a test code

any help is very appreciated it

====================================================================
sph = servermanager.sources.vrmlreader(FileName="/Users/jmazo/Desktop/carRot.wrl")
#sph = servermanager.sources.vrmlreader(FileName=filenamefoo)
pm=servermanager.ProxyManager()
pm.RegisterProxy("sources", "mysource", sph)
view = pm.GetProxy("views", "RenderView1")
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(sph, view)
pm.RegisterProxy("representations", "myrep1", rep)


transforms = servermanager.createModule("transforms")
transform = transforms.Transform()
#transform.Translate = [0, 0, 0]
#transform.Rotate = [3, 2, 11]
#transform.Scale = [1, 1, 10]


tf = servermanager.filters.TransformFilter(Input = sph, Transform = transform)

sourceProperty = tf.GetProperty("Transform")
domain = sourceProperty.GetDomain("proxy_list")
domain.AddProxy(sph.SMProxy)




#tf.Transform = transform
pm.RegisterProxy("sources", "TransformFilter", tf) <====== HERE when I
click on TransformFilter paraview just dies, (no messages)


repr = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(tf, view)
pm.RegisterProxy("representations", "myrep2", repr)

Subject: [Paraview] Update all pipeline objects,  paraview time

References: <mailman.5.1232125208.25490.paraview@paraview.org>

- I am trying to add an action to paraview that cause a re 
apply for all pipeline objets. I tried:
vtkSMProxyManager *pxm = 
vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager();
pxm->UpdateRegisteredProxiesInOrder(0);

but this didn't work. I also tried:

	vtkSMProxyManager *pxm = 
vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager();
	vtkStringList *list = vtkStringList::New();
	pxm->GetProxiesNamesInGroup("sources", list);
	for(int i =0; i < list->GetLength(); i++)
	{
		vtkSMProxy *proxy = 
pxm->GetProxy("sources",list->GetString(i));
		proxy->Modified();
	}

	pxm->UpdateRegisteredProxiesInOrder(0);
	pqApplicationCore::instance()->render();

this doesn't work two ! what am I missing ?

another question:
- I know that vtkObject::GetMTime() return a single 
object's modified time. Is there a way to find the last 
time ANY object was modified, not just a single object. I 
know that I can do it by comparing last modified objects 
time and get the earlier one but am just wondering if it's 
already stored somewhere in Paraview.

Thank you,

Hi Berk,

Thank you. That solved the problem.
(I didn't realize that libpmpich.a (rather than libmpichxx.a) had the
MPI functions.)

Well,
I tried everything, changing the cmake_install_prefix and so on, and lastly I checked  the CMakeLists.txt file  which took care of the Plugin and there I found a mistake.. a library name spelled incorrectly. I changed that and now I get
linker errors which I do not know how to get rid of:

No rule to make target `/usr/local/unpackaged/libcommon.so', needed by `bin/libVdcWriter.so'.  Stop.

That libcommon.so is a library which is already build, but not by paraview, and I want it to be linked to my code. Here
is the CMakeLists.txt:

INCLUDE(${ParaView_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake)

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(
  ${VTK_INCLUDE_DIR}
  ${PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${VTKEXPAT_SOURCE_DIR}
 )

FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
 INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

FIND_PACKAGE(VDC REQUIRED)
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${VDC_INCLUDE_DIR})

FIND_PACKAGE(NETCDF REQUIRED)
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${NETCDF_INCLUDE_DIR})

IF (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI)
  ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(VdcWriter "1.0"
    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES GUIVdcWriter.xml
    SERVER_MANAGER_XML SMVdcWriter.xml
    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkVdcWriter.cxx
    )
ELSE (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI)
  ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(VdcWriter "1.0"
    SERVER_MANAGER_XML SMVdcWriter.xml
    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkVdcWriter.cxx
    )
ENDIF (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI)

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(VdcWriter ${EXPAT_LIBRARY} ${NETCDF_LIBRARY} ${COMMON_LIBRARY} ${VDF_LIBRARY}

I believe that target_link_libraries command is not correct, but how can I link all these libraries to my code?

thx
Natalie

You can try the following:

SET(PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES
      ${PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES}
      ${vtkexpat} ${NETCDF_LIBRARY} ${COMMON_LIBRARY} ${VDF_LIBRARY})

BEFORE the line

IF (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI)


Also ParaView provides its own expat library which you may be able to  
use instead of your own or a system one. vtkexpat

Hope that helps

Subject: [Paraview] 3.4.0 compilation broken due to xdfm / old hdf5
Message-ID: <1232282331.30903.7.camel@localhost.localdomain>

PV 3.4.0 + bundled hdf5 tandem is buggy somewhere, as reported long ago,
so I need a newer ("system") version of hdf5. However, compiling both
with hdf5 1.8.x and 1.6.8 breaks the compilation, e.g. errors with
1.6.8:

In file included
from /home/domel/pack/ParaView-3.4.0/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfArray.h:29,

from /home/domel/pack/ParaView-3.4.0/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfArray.cxx:26:
/home/domel/pack/ParaView-3.4.0/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfDataDesc.h:
In member function ?XdmfInt32 XdmfDataDesc::SetHeavyDataSetName(const
char*)?:

/home/domel/pack/ParaView-3.4.0/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfDataDesc.h:198: error: ?strcpy? was not declared in this scope
(...)

The simplest solution for me would be disabling Xdfm (the only user of
hdf5 in PV) that I don't need, but it is not possible, it is referenced
in the server code.

1) can xdfm be disabled at option?

2) how can I compile with a newer version of hdf5?

Thanks,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] pvrenderserver with MPI or without MPI?
Message-ID: <1b61cab90901181943v4464b4a6p8de39d4e7ffde7c4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've built Paraview servers on Mac OS X (10.5.6 intel x86_64) with
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON.
I'm going to run the servers on a MacPro with 8 CPUs and with a single
graphics card.

I understand that
% mpirun -np 8 pvserver
is meaningful for data processing since it will be done in parallel
using 8 CPUs. But, I think it is redundant for rendering since there
is only one graphics card. In fact, when I run the above command,
there appear 8 windows, but rendering seems to be done on only one of
them with other 7 windows being blank.

So, I guess I should launch the pvdataserver with MPI but the
pvrenderserver without MPI like this:
% mpirun -np 8 pvdataserver
% pvrenderserver

Is my understanding correct?

Thank you.
Shigenobu

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Paraview to work with SAGE
Message-ID: <49746615.7060403@ifd.mavt.ethz.ch>

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to get paraview to work with SAGE (http://www.sagemath.org/), 
an open source mathematics software based on the python language. 
Ideally, I would like to do my data manipulation etc. in SAGE, connect 
from SAGE promt (which is an ipython promt) to the paraview server, and 
plot my data.
I keep running into compatibility problems, even when compiling paraview 
from source, and listing the SAGE python distribution in the CCMake 
configuration. Has anyone tried this before and can give me some hints 
how to get it working on OS X Leopard?

Thank you,
Johannes

Hi,

Thanks for your answer. It is helpful.
Now, I would like to initiate an action when the user presses a
toolbar button that divides the GUI into 4 independent view frames (
as opposed to "Comparative" where there is only one frame with several
renderers).

I coded that inside the onAction function:

void MyToolbarAction::onAction(QAction* a)
{
  pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
  pqObjectBuilder* builder = core->getObjectBuilder();
  pqServerManagerModel* sm = core->getServerManagerModel();

  QString actionStr = a->data().toString();
  if( actionStr == QString("Configure") )
  {
     pqServer* server = sm->getItemAtIndex<pqServer*>(0);
     if( server )
     {
        builder->createView( "RenderView", server );
        builder->createView( "RenderView", server );
        builder->createView( "RenderView", server );
     }
  }
}

The problem is that this way splits the current view frame (I think
so, but I didn't manage to track the code until the
splitVertical/Horizontal functions). And the result is attached
(paraview_tile_result.jpg) : this is not a regular tile of the
interface.

I tried, but it was unsuccessful, to get the ActiveView::instance,
then set the ActiveView::current(), and so on. But nothing changed.
How can I access the pqView, pqViewManager, pqMainWindowCore instances
inside my plugin? I think this is the way to handle the layout of the
main window.

If I am wrong, what is the best way to get automatically an interface
as in paraview_tile_expected.jpg?

Thanks a lot !

Regards,

Jerome

Hi Shigenobu,

I'd recommend using simple client-server and turning off remote
rendering from the Preferences -> Render View -> Server. This should
give you the same result without the complication of the render
server. Making use of multiple cores when there is only one graphics
card is a research topic for us. In the future, there will be better
way of doing this.

Hi Johannes,

Can you be more specific about what you mean by compatibility
problems? Does SAGE have its own Python? Where is it installed?

Jerome,

You can use:
  pqViewManager * viewmgr = qobject_cast<pqViewManager*>(
    pqApplicationCore::instace()->manager("MULTIVIEW_MANAGER"));
to get the view manager.

Before even creating your render views, you can simply split the
frames and create empty frames layed out the way you want. Then create
the views. pqViewManager will automatically assign those views to
already existing empty frames.

In case it was not clear before, you can load up a .png file just like any
other data file (File -> Open).  You can then manipulate it like any other
pipeline object.

There is no eps reader, so you will have to convert it to a raster format
like png.  There are several utilities that will do it for you.  Imagemagick
is one cross-platform solution.

I assume you are talking about the grid and ticks of the cube axis.  I do
not see a way to change them.  I raised a feature request to do that.

Hope that helps.

Hi there
I'm trying to use the transformFilter, and show it in the pipeline properly

here
http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/TransformFilter.html

The value must be set to one of the following: Transform3. for the

but I dont know how to set it to that value, all I can set it to is to
transform and trasform2

so this way I keep getting the error
"Selected proxy value not in the list:  Transform" and the

Hi Berk,

Thank you for the information. It looks fine for my current purpose.

But, I think I haven't yet understood how pvrenderserver works in
parallel. Does it still use MPI?; for example, if I had multiple
graphics cards, say 4 cards, should I do like this?:
% mpirun -np 8 pvdataserver
% mpirun -np 4 pvrenderserver
Or does it work in other way?

Subject: [Paraview] building code as part of paraview
Message-ID: <BAY122-W55E7ECE618A29230C1C869BCD00@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?d like to add a new writer to Paraview. I?ve already tried it as a plugin, and this works fine, but I would prefer not loading the plugin everytime I need it. 
I followed the instructions on the wiki called "Build code as part from paraview". Technically, everything is found, but building paraview I get many errors of the kind "undefined reference". 
The problem is, that I also build shared libraries to get my Writer to work, and it seems they are built too late for the code to be linked. But where should I put the libraries to be build? 

thx,
Natalie

Hi,

I found - I was lucky ! - something interesting for loading a plugin
without environment variables and ParaView build.

I made a sub-directory named Plugins in the folder that contains the
paraview executable. I put in this subdir the dynamic lib involved in
the plugin. My surprise was that my plugin loads twice - because I set
the PV_PLUGIN_PATH env. variable - !

'Hope that helps.

The render server uses mpi as well. Its main use is to support compute
server (a supercomputer for example), rendering cluster and client
scenarios. The compute server produces geometry, reduces it to N piece
(where N is the number of nodes on the render server), ships it to the
render server using N sockets and then the render server renders
geometry using distributed rendering (Ice-T over MPI).

Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0901200714q15fe594fvd9ca027130d73cba@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I successfully created a reader in paraview that uses the
vtkDICOMImageReader. I used the hint "UseDirectory" in the xml, so
that the directory name is used instead of the selected file name.
My problem is : I have files without extensions !

How can I handle this ?
I am currently using this GUI XML :
<ParaViewReaders>
  <Reader name="DICOMImageReader" extensions="dcm"
          file_description="DICOM Files and folders">
  </Reader>
</ParaViewReaders>

How may I change the element 'extensions' ?

Thanks !

Jerome

Thanks Utkarsh and Moreland for your responses.

I'm creating a totally new view, similar to the histogram 
view, but I want to use a different way to draw the 
histogram or the curve.
1- Should I create a custom diplay panel for my view or 
it's optional ? If it's optional, should I specify the 
display proxy information in my xml file ?

I did a first try and I got this error:
ERROR: In 
..\..\..\trunk\Servers\ServerManager\vtkSMProxyManager.cxx, 
line 330
vtkSMProxyManager (07F8C570): No proxy that matches: 
group=views and proxy=pqPlotPropertiesOverTimeView were 
found.

Do I have to add my view name somewhere in Paraview core ?

here are my files:
https://mail.mirarco.org/~nbilal/PlotPropertiesOverTime.zip

Thank you,

Nehme

Hi Again,

I am able to create the new view, it was some errors in my 
xml file and cmake list.

- How can I send the data from my vtk server class to 
myView class ? is it the same way that we normaly use to 
send data from server to qt custom panel ? is that mean I 
have to fetch all my data to the client side ? if yes, how 
to do that ?

The custom view wiki page does not explain anything about 
the communication between the view and the server.

Thanks,
Nehme

Subject: [Paraview] Does stereo mode support in windows?
Message-ID: <d0767b160901201139y449cab8axa471e210c91c95d3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.
I try to get the stereo mode work in windows. It seems that no matter which
stereo mode (Red Blue or Crystal eyes) I choose,  the result is not stereo
rendering. I am wondering if stereo mode support in windows? My paraview
version is 3.4.0 and I compile it from source.
Thanks very much!

Hello,

I was wondering what everyone would consider to be the most portable format
for:

1. multi-zone
2. unstructured
3. 2d or 3d

mesh data.

Thanks Everyone,

What do you mean by portable? Across visualization applications or
across platforms? Across visualization applications, you best bet is
probably EnSight.

As close as you will get to a standard. If you are in the CFD field,
you may want to look into CGNS too. We will have CGNS support
relatively soon.

Hi Juan,

Please direct your questions to the ParaView mailing list instead of
me. I believe that we will have some sort of CGNS support in the next
release. It may take some time to mature though.

Subject: [Paraview] Isosurface
Message-ID: <90434.33291.qm@web59805.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am new to Paraview and I hope some of you can help me. I am trying to visualize an isosurface. I used to work with Matlab where I would input the data in 4D in the format: <X> <Y> <Z> <Intensity>
To use Paraview, I generated a dataset in VTK format as an unstructured grid with no cells. The Intensities are associated to the corners of the cells as follow:





# vtk DataFile Version 3.1

Volume

ASCII

DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID

POINTS 197173 FLOAT

1 1 1

1 1 6

1 1 11

....
....





POINT_DATA 197173

SCALARS Intensities float

LOOKUP_TABLE default

20799.3681311062

20803.8373905225

20806.6752675851......
When I open this file, Paraview correctly identifies minimum and maximum values and the number of points. But I can't manage to visualize the contours.
Any suggestion? Do I need to generate CELLS data to draw isosurfaces? Can Paraview generate an isosurface solely from POINTS data? Thanks in advance.

This is one of the most essential feature ParaView should have.
For many vendors and companies CGNS file format is the most common one for data interchange and analysis. Waiting anxiously for this feature to appear.

Please change the mailing list so the default "reply to" is the list and not
the person who last responded.

I realized my mistake once it was already sent, but I didn't follow up to
the list since I figured you'd reply to the list if you thought it warranted
public attention.

I?m sorry, I didn?t really understand.
You made a subdirectory named Plugins in the -in my case - Paraview/build/bin directory, you put libMyPlugin.so there and then the Plugin loaded without using the plugin manager?

Yes, that is exactly the case with Windows XP. I didn't try yet with my Linux.

Subject: [Paraview] Cmake and RPATH
Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAF0V88snc7NDnLzKjZ+tgCrCgAAAEAAAAHZN/Ew18wZFoqtVSgv2qgsBAAAAAA==@ara.co.uk>

Hi all, 

I'm having a problem running paraview when compiling it with a new version
of my compiler.
The compiler I am using is installed in a non common directory. The
compilation goes through without a problem, but when I run ParaView I get
the following :

/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.1' not found (required by
/usr/people/papper/PARAVIEW/ParaView3-64-bin/bin/libvtkPVServerCommon.so)

This is because it should pickup another version of libstdc++.so.6 which is
not in /usr/lib64 but in my LD_LIBRARY_PATH

When I do objdump -p paraview I get the following :

RPATH       BLABLABLA...:/usr/lib64:BLABLABLA...

My question is : How do I get CMAKE (v2.4.6) to not use RPATH ?

Thanks for any help.

Hallo!
 
Paraview is completely new for me, and I'm struggling with the CreateRepresentation Proxy in
pvpython...
I did the same thing as written in a paraview manual but it just won't work. Does someone of you
know why?

That should also work on Linux. For OS X the Plugins should be in the  
ParaView.app bundle at ParaView.app/Contents/Plugins. At least that is  
what I remember.

Hi Jacques,

You should set VTK_USE_RPATH to OFF.

Dominik,

What is your compiler version? I couldn't duplicate this on the cvs
head but I have feeling that's because I am using gcc 4.0.

I've updated the wiki 
<http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Using_Plugins> with the 
information of where you can place plugins for paraview to pick them up 
automatically without setting PV_PLUGIN_PATH.  There's a system-wide 
location (if paraview is installed that way), and a user specific location.

Thank you Berk, 

I was looking for a flag like SKIP_RPATH_INSTALL not a specific VTK flag...
Do you know if there is a way of manually setting the RPATH ? 
I would like to use RPATH so that I can create releases that do not need the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH but as I explained in my previous mail the wrong paths are
taken when I do.

Kind Regards,
Jacques

Hi Jacques,

You should set VTK_USE_RPATH to OFF.

Yes, you need cells to create an isosurface.  The cells specify how the scalar field should be interpolated between points.

The easiest way to impose cells on your points is to run the Delaunay 3D filter on them.

Hi,

I am new to Paraview and I hope some of you can help me. I am trying to visualize an isosurface. I used to work with Matlab where I would input the data in 4D in the format: <X> <Y> <Z> <Intensity>
To use Paraview, I generated a dataset in VTK format as an unstructured grid with no cells. The Intensities are associated to the corners of the cells as follow:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.1 Volume ASCII DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID POINTS 197173 FLOAT 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 1 11 ....
...

POINT_DATA 197173 SCALARS Intensities float LOOKUP_TABLE default 20799.3681311062 20803.8373905225 20806.6752675851......
When I open this file, Paraview correctly identifies minimum and maximum values and the number of points. But I can't manage to visualize the contours.
Any suggestion? Do I need to generate CELLS data to draw isosurfaces? Can Paraview generate an isosurface solely from POINTS data? Thanks in advance.

If this is a regular, cartesian grid, you can use image data. If
rectilinear, use rectilinear grid. If this is curvilinear grid, you
can use structured grid. Otherwise, you have to create cells somehow.

I fixed the cvs head so that it compiles with 4.3 after ParaView 3.4
release. I am wondering if the issue Dominik is running into is still
there on cvs head though. If hdf5 was pulling in some headers, and now
it doesn't, some things may still be broken. Dominik, how hard is it
for you to try cvs head?

I have a clean compilation of cvs head today, without system hdf5, and
gcc 4.3.1

as soon as I turn SYSTEM_HDF5 = ON with my local HDF5 version 1.8.1, I
get the errors mentioned:

Subject: [Paraview] animation with changing visibility
Message-ID: <49775DE7.4040506@tufts.edu>

To All,

I have searched around a bit for some documentation on this (including 
this mailing list), so my apologizes if it has been discussed before. 

I am trying to create a simple animation using Paraview 3.4.0.  The 
animation desired is: a 3D cube rotates for 5 seconds, becomes invisible 
and is replaced with a new object (a slice from the center of the 3D 
cube). 

It seemed fairly straight forward but I have been running into some 
problems.  I have no problem with the rotation (using the Transform 
filter) for 5 seconds.  I am running into trouble with changing the 
visibility.  Specifically, making the 3D sphere turn invisible and 
making the slice become visible at the appropriate time.  I have tried 
animating the visibility of an object but am not sure how to do this 
properly or what values to set.  I tried working with the assumption 
that a visibility value of 0 meant invisible, but that didn't seem to be 
working.

Thanks for any help!

Animating the visibility is the right thing to do.  If you have not already, try changing the interpolation from ramp to step.  That might be the problem.

Ken,

Thanks for the quick feedback.  I have tried this, with no luck yet.  
Using this approach, how do you toggle visibility??  Does a value of 0 
turn visibility off?  If so, what value turns it back on??

Thanks again.

0 turns visibility off.  1 turns visibility on.

This one of the possibilities. My way is to tell ParaView that I want
to read "other files (*)", then I pick the file, then Paraview tells
that it cannot understand the file type, so I can precise to it that
this is a DICOM one...

My problem is still the user-friendly interface that I have to deploy
: I don't want to explain to the user that he has to change the
extension of the file for the plugin to work.

Regards,

Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] ellipsoid glyphs
Message-ID: <2DDC0446EF4690489771E0A9491C6305028AF95F@EX3.d.ethz.ch>

Hello,

I'm new to paraview and vtk, and would like to use glyphs filter for  
3d visualization. More precisely, I have a 3d vtk mesh and 3x3  
matrices corresponding to each mesh vertex (matrices were obtained in  
matlab and are not stored to any of paraview file types). I need  
ellipsoids visualizing eigenvectors/eigenvalues of these matrices (for  
all mesh points or for a subset). Is there any straight forward way to  
do it?

I found spheres in glyphs filter, custom source glyph filter and  
vtkTensorGlyph class, which seem to be able to solve my problem. But I  
don't understand how to store my data and how to open them in  
paraview. Or do I have to create my own filter to use ellipsoid glyphs?

Thanks. Regards,
Katya

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython Transform Filter problem
Message-ID: <16d926890901220748lbed9109pc5db46d75aafb0a6@mail.gmail.com>

Good day everyone.

I've been having big trouble using pvpython to apply a Transform filter, the
command sequence I'm using on my script is as follows:

transforms = servermanager.createModule("transforms")
thisT=transforms.Transform2()
thisT.Scale=[2,2,1]
thisTransformFilter =
servermanager.filters.TransformFilter(Input=coneSource,registrationGroup="sources",registrationName="Transform2",Transform=thisT)
rep=servermanager.CreateRepresentation(thisTransformFilter,view)
pm.RegisterProxy("representations", "myRepT", rep)

The Render window shows exactly what I want to see, but after applying the
filter when I try to change its values (Rotation, Scaling, Translation) I
get this message on the error screen:

"Selected proxy value not in the list: Transform"

I've been trying for a week or so and haven't got anywhere. (It seems as if
the pvpython filter I'm using is not registering the transform property
somewhere).

Any help will be really appreciated,

Greetings from Colombia!

I apologize for misleading (doing 5 things at the same time does not 
work): as you see below I was screwing around with a wrong version. The 
CVS version dated 21.01.2009 results in the same compilation error as 
reported originally (strcmp etc.).

Subject: [Paraview]  Reading excel data into paraview
Message-ID: <COL119-W455071E365DD4F34C8D49894CE0@phx.gbl>


 
Hi everybody,
 
I have just started working on paraview and have data which is a 1-dimensional times series of water suface elevations. At each time step I have water heights recorded for the length of the computational domain. The columns in my excel file represents the changing water profile for each time step and the rows represent the spatial step. My aim is to generate a 2D animation showing a wave propagating along the computational domain. 
 
Mike suggested that I convert the file from .xls to .csv (for easier reading) than to .pvd (to view in paraview). This is all well and good, though I am not that confident with python coding, I think if I had an example I will be able to get my head around it though. If anyone could help me out in that would be much appreciated. Cheers,Jamie.

I'd like my new FileSeriesReaderProxy to be a run-time loaded plugin.
I've created the necessary XML tags as per the discussion below, and put
it in a .xml file.  It loads fine with the Plugin Manager, but the files
still aren't recognized as a series.

Is this because run-time loading of a FileSeriesReaderProxy isn't
supported?  Has anyone else tried it this way (as opposed to adding it
to the readers.xml file and recompiling)?

Thanks,
Sean

Subject: [Paraview]  Python command to rescale data range
Message-ID: <b77d3d340901221415va9da1f6l7df93d0bf3fb2797@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear all,

I would need your lights on a small but annoying problem that I have with
Paraview 3.4.0.
I use a python script to load and display a preformatted state. It all works
fine except that the color scale doesn't automatically rescale to fit data
range, even though the corresponding checkbox is selected.
I would like to find the python command equivalent to a simple click on the
icon "Rescale data to range". Does anyone know such command ?

Any help on the subject would be very much appreciated.

Best Regards,

Charles-Andr?

Dear All,

	I just compiled and built the cvs version of paraview with some
of my new code on openSUSE linux. Everything is fine apart from at
runtime I get the error:

./paraview: symbol lookup error: ./paraview: undefined symbol:

Any ideas?

This is not "a simple click", but the following python code works for me:

#get the proxy to your object, example

pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
slice = pm.GetProxy('sources', 'Slice1')

#get the data range

range =
slice.GetDataInformation().GetPointDataInformation().GetArrayInformation(0).GetComponentRange(0)

# find a proxy to the representation of your object
# iterate until you find the right one, e.g.

print pm.GetProxiesInGroup("representations")
#  once you know your proxy, e.g.

rep = pm.GetProxy("representations", "DataRepresentation4")

# get its lookuptable and the RGBpoints array

table = rep.LookupTable.GetData().RGBPoints
# you can now set it to your data range

table[0] = range[0]
table[4] = range[1]



Your mileage will vary. Error checking is left as an exercise

I am going to interpret this as a feature request as it is not
possible to do this automatically. I take that back, it is probably
possible by adding an observer to the appropriate event but not
straightforward. We are planning on moving some of the lookup table
management to the engine (as opposed to the GUI layer). After that, it
should be fairly easy to implement this in Python.

It definitely sounds like a library, or library-header mismatch. It
also looks like it has something to do with Qt (stating the obvious
here) :-). Do you have multiple versions of Qt? Did you compile from

Hmmm. It should work. Are you saying that it works if you add it to
readers.xml but not as a plugin? Can you share your xml and maybe the
reader code with the guts taken out?

NOTE: Everything described here works with cvs version. I don't think
they will work with 3.4.

* Load the csv file - this will create a table
* Apply Table to Points - choose the right columns for X, Y and Z values
* Apply programmable filter with the following code:
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
npts = output.GetNumberOfPoints()
lines = vtk.vtkCellArray()
lines.InsertNextCell(npts)
for i in range(npts):
	lines.InsertCellPoint(i)
output.SetLines(lines)
output.SetVerts(None)

This will produce a polygonal dataset that contains one polyline that
connects all points. Then you can save the dataset out as a VTK file.
I recommend legacy VTK. If you write a python script that does the
above for each timestep, you can create a set of legacy VTK files. If
they are named as
foo1.vtk
foo2.vtk
...

You can then load them as a time series.

I've had the same problem yesterday. 
It most certainly has to do with picking up the wrong version of QT in your
Path. 
If you do:
ldd -d paraview 
You should be able to see if it's picking up the correct versions.

Dear Paraview,

I can't get python scripting working with paraview. I have downloaded
paraview binary 3.4.0 for linux and set pythonpath by

export
PYTHONPATH="/home/sree/paraview-3.4.0/lib/paraview-3.4/paraview/:/home/sree/paraview-3.4.0/bin/"
in .bashrc file

and in python when i printed the paths it showed the paraview paths:

print sys.path
['', '/home/sree/paraview-3.4.0/lib/paraview-3.4/paraview',
'/home/sree/paraview-3.4.0/bin'.... ]

however when i followed commands as given in
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting
the following error occured.
>>> from paraview import servermanager
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named paraview

what I am missing here.. ?

thanks,
Sreejith

Hi Sreejith,

I'm not sure if the paraview binaries are built with python scripting
enabled.  (the default, when I've compiled it on my machine, is that
it is disabled)  In that case you need to compile from source and turn
on python scripting.  To check you could probably do a search for
paraview.py on your system and see if it turns up.

Hope that helps,
Peter.

I haven't tried adding it to readers.xml.  I want to distribute this to 
other users, and it would be best if they didn't have to recompile - 
just use the plugin.

The good news is that the reader isn't mine; it already exists.  It is 
the UNC Meta Image reader (vtkMetaImageReader).  It reads .mha & .mhd 
files.  I'm simply trying to extend it to read time series.  I've 
attached the .xml file that I've written.

It appears to select the original reader rather than the file series 
reader for these files.  I _think_ I've set all of the properties 
correctly.  I wonder if I need to tell it to override the file 
extensions somehow?

Thanks,
Sean

First, I would like to mention that the ParaView binaries come with a program called pvpython that is basically just a python interpreter with the paths set up.

That said, I understand that it is not always practical to use pvpython in lieu of the default python interpreter, so to actually answer your question, you also have to add this to your PYTHONPATH

/home/sree/paraview-3.4.0/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping

After that, python should find the paraview module.

Although not strictly necessary, I also recommend calling paraview.servermanager.vtkInitializationHelper.Finalize() right before your script exits.  This will make sure that all the VTK object get cleaned up nicely and is one of the other things that pvpython will do for you.

Thank you for the quick reply.
But in the paraview-3.4 directory, I do not have a Utilities directory. I
only have  bin/  and lib/

Sorry.  I was looking at my development build because I don't have the release installed on my system right now.  Try removing the final paraview from the lib directory path.

export PYTHONPATH="/home/sree/paraview-3.4.0/lib/paraview-3.4:/home/sree/paraview-3.4.0/bin"

Message-ID: <17777b020901231543r32fde239he7498376b98a3ac9@mail.gmail.com>

HI;

I have a series of PVD files names PVD_XXX.pvd. When I go to File/Open, the
file series shows up collapsed. I select the file series itself and hit OK.
The loader loads the 1st file. No matter what I try, paraview only deals
with the 1st file. I think there should be something with the PVD reader
that makes it treat the file series as if it is only the 1st file.

I will be grateful for any comments.

Regards,

Subject: [Paraview]  Export python programmable filters ?
Message-ID: <fac5e9bb0901231733q7227f5a7rb003849f57e0e0e6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Can a python programmable filter be saved?

As described on this wiki page, it is possible to export cutom programmable
filters (last part: "Managing custom filters"):
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Custom_Filters

Is a similar mechanism available for python programmable filter?
It would be very interesting:
- having at hand, as soon as Paraview is started ones own usual scripts.
- having the possibility to execute them in a ParaView batch job (as I
understand it, once created, they are not currently saved with other
ParaView settings).
- easing the python programmable filter sharing between different paraview
installations.

Please, could you indicate me if such a feature is available?
It doesn't appear so in:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter

I thank you in advance for your help.

Cheers,

Pierre

Message-ID: <fac5e9bb0901231742v95ce249ya9dd12b68a8f6183@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to know if there is a way to have a python programmable flter
without output in ParaView, that is to say, having an additional entry
"none" when the "Output DataSet Type is requested in the ParaView python
programmable filter GUI?
For instance, is it possible to have a python programmable filter computing
the whole volume of a 3D mesh (making use of
vtkMassProperties<http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkMassProperties.html>for
instance) which would thus returns a single scalar.
Such a result could then be displayed or saved in a result file, but not new
vtk data or grid would be generated...

I thank you in advance for your comments.
Cheers,

Hi all,


I am wondering if it is possible to export a ParaView session in a file,
which could then be loaded back for execution.
I mean is there a way to save all user choices of the session pipeline, such
that it could be executed again once reloaded in ParaView?
The result file produced could be close to a pvsm file, but with user values
for each user inputs needed to set readers filters, and writters working. It
would describe the chain of plugins that was previously run, as well as all
their input data.

I thank you in advance for your help.

filter in a file and read it into a string at the the beginning of the
my script.

Hi,

When I use "Save state", I have this result. Isn't it the case for you?
My pvsm files contain the user parameters and pipelines (except maybe
the writer, but I used to use "Save data" from the file menu, so they
are not really in the pipeline..)

Regards,
Jerome

How do I load a custom filter into pvpython ?

Hi Peter,

Tank you for your help.
What do you mean exactly with "read it into a string at the the beginning of
the script".
Is it related to the way you make use of python programmable filters in
batch mode (in this case, I guess that you start ParaView with a python
script)?
Could you explain me what script does your comment refer to?

I thank you in advance for your help.

Regards,

Pierre

Hi J?r?me,

Thanks for your answer.
It helps, but the pvsm file stored contains really every ParaView settings.

I am going to study closely its content: do you know if some data are
optional in the sense, if there is no value in the pvsm file, a default
value considered instead by ParaView?
Actually, I'm not interested in most of the data in the pvsm file I saved
because I would like then start from a pvsm file to execute ParaView in
batch, and save the results in vtk xml file for instance.
Thus, the only data which would be kept are nearly all related to the
filters used, and only them. For other settings, defaut values are ok: they
do not actually to be set.
Currently, the only additional important information I see is the increment
at which filters have to be applied.

As I foresee to write then the pvsm file from another application, I would
like to simplify it as much as possible. I have tried "cleaning" the
obtained pvsm file, keeping only the tags related to the filters I have been
using, but it doesn't work well: when loaded back, ParaView hangs on the
screen "Create View" (3D View, 2D View, ...)
I'm gonna do some experiments to see what can be cleaned or not.


I thank you again for your help.
Regards,

Pierre

Another solution is to make a custom filter that contains the
programmable filter. The custom filter can be exported as an xml file,
emailed, and imported by another user.

Hmm,

One thing to try is to have it output a vtkPolyData with exactly one
point and VTK_VERTEX cell (to contain the point and cell associated
attribute arrays respectively. The output is minimal in that case, but
can be used by vtk/paraview for additional processing if needed (for
example the information tab will display something useful). That is
what the paraview.servermanager.Fetch filter does for client side
python scripting of reduction operations.

But no output? We would have to change the cxx code for that. Please
add a feature request to the bug tracker if the above solution does
not work for your needs.

cheers,

Hi Pierre,

I do most of my python processing via pvpython.  At the top of my
processing script I simply have something like:

filterfile = open('prog_filter.py', 'r')
filterString = filterfile.read()
filterfile.close()

where the file: 'prog_filter.py' is my programmable filter.  To use it:

deform = servermanager.filters.ProgrammableFilter(Input=someInput)
deform.Script = filterString
deform.UpdatePipeline()

It's the 'quick and dirty' way but not particularly elegant.  I don't
think this approach would work from the GUI though.  For that you
would need to implement David's suggestion about the customFilter.

Hope that helps,
Peter.

As Dave mentioned, the best way of doing what you want is to wrap the
programmable filter in a custom filter. We are planning some
improvements that will make this better by the next release:

- Custom readers
- Custom writers
- Capability of defining parameters of a programmable filter that will
be exposed in the GUI

Actually, I think that such a filter should have an output. Probably a
vtkTable that has one or a few values in it. You can then save that
table to a csv file or something. Even use it as an input to another
filter. Applications like OpenDX, SCIRun and AVS take this idea to the
extreme and make pretty much all parameters of pipeline modules into
inputs...

We have plans to implement exactly what you want, in Python, for the
next release. Currently, the state is the only way to do this.

We never added file series support for the  pvd format because it
supports time natively. Can you not create one pvd file that points to
everything instead of a series of pvd files?

Thank you for your comments.

Yes a cvs table is an interesting idea to store the results. I'm gonna check
that. Thanks for the track!

At first, I was thinking to another way to keep such kind of scalar results
computed by a given filter.
I indeed thought that it could be interesting to store them as an attribute
value in the .pvsm file of the ParaView session, something like:

    <Proxy group="filters" type="" id=""
servers="">                                         *<= the filter that
computes a scalar result...*
      <Property name="Input" id=""
number_of_elements="">                            *<= ...and the definition
of all its inputs, and other necessary data*
        ...
      </Property>
        ...
      <Property name="Output" id="" umber_of_elements="1" *value="46"*>
* <= ...finally, the results obtained and written in the pvsm after a batch
execution or when the ParaView session is saved.*
        ...
      </Property>
    </Proxy>


But it may not be well in accordance with the logic of the pvsm file.

Thanks again for your help!
Cheers,



Pierre

As an alternative, Are there any other imaging formats written by ITK
for which paraview has a time dependent reader?
I have a time series of imaging data that I want to animate.
I have used paraview's python command line interface to animate
the files in the past, but am wondering if there was an easier way?


thank you,

Nope. You should be able to create a new issues using "Report Issue".
Our bug tracker does not differentiate bugs/feature requests at the
top level. Once you create an issues, you can set it as feature
request.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview v3.4.0 poor movie quality
Message-ID: <497D0E9B.7090005@mchsi.com>

I have been trying to generate several animations in paraview v3.4.0 (32 
bit windows xp O.S.) but so far the animation quality has been terrible. 
I have reviewed some of the previous posts and solutions but making the 
changes offered in those solutions did not change the quality of the 
animations generated.  Specifically, I turned off the light kit and I 
also unchecked the "Use Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots", which can 
be found under "Render View" in the options.  I did not have problems 
with animation quality until upgrading to version 3.  Since then all of 
the version 3 variants of paraview have given me the same animation 
quality problems.

Additional information: I generate an animation by choosing "save 
animation" under "file", set the frames per sec., etc. and then save the 
animation as an "avi" file.  I was hoping someone who subscribes to this 
list could provide some guidance on how to generate a high quality 
animation out of paraview v3.4.0.  I have also tried this on two 
different windows xp computers with different video cards and drivers, 
but still get the same results.

Sincerely,
Rick

Hi Rick,

Not sure if this is helpful but I save the animation as png's and then
use a separate program (ffmpeg - its open source) to turn the png's
into a movie.  ffmpeg gives me a lot of control on the frame rate,
quality, size, and format of the output.

Hope that helps,
Peter.

If you save the animation as a series of images, are the images of
poor quality as well? I am trying to figure out if the encoding or
screen capture is bad.

Hi Berk,

I have generated an animation using the method you are referring to, 
where individual images are generated for each time-step.  The 
individual images generated out of Paraview v3.4.0 are high quality when 
using this approach.

Please see the email I sent to you directly that includes a sample 
movie, illustrating the poor movie quality.

Does Paraview have its own built-in codecs or does it use codecs 
available elsewhere on the computer system?

Sincerely,
Rick

Hi,


i have a huge number of cases with the same layout (state-file 
available). Now i would like to run paraview (serial) from a 
shell-script to process all this cases and write out a picture as a 
result for each case.

What is the easiest way to do this? pvbatch? pvpython? Are there any 
examples?

Best regards,

That's a good question (i.e. I have no idea :-) ). I'll investigate it
this week and implement a solution if not already possible.

It looks like paraview 2.6's animation quality setting (low, medium,
high) was lost in the transition to 3.x. The result is that 3.x
chooses medium as the default.

I've added bug 8427 to the bugtracker so that it will get resolved by
3.6. In the meantime, if you build from source, you can change

vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter.cxx line 60 to be
this->Quality = 2; //for max
or
this->Quality = 0; //for min

Stefan,

pvpython is what you want to use in this case.  If you have not used the ParaView python scripting, you should take a look at the documentation on the ParaView Wiki.

  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Let us know if you run into any problems.

John,

Thanks.  I already look into both of those filters.  Although both filters internally compute polygon area, I did not see a way to get the per-cell area (written out to a cell data array) from them.  When I run vtkIntegrateAttributes, I get a single value back that is the total area of all the cells.  I also did not see a clear way to get the data from vtkIntegrateFlowSurface.  Am I missing something?

But although it does the area of triangulted data ok, I never used it as I ended up using the vtkIntegrateAttributes (this does areas for all 2D cell types) filter and IntegrateFlowThroughSurface

Compute cell area Is there an easy way to compute the area of a 2D cell?

What about the "Mesh Quality" filter?  You can select "Area" for 
triangle and quadrilateral quality.  You get a cell data array with 
results for each cell.

I didn't think of that filter.  Thanks, Clint.

What about the "Mesh Quality" filter?  You can select "Area" for
triangle and quadrilateral quality.  You get a cell data array with

The can dataset is available in the ParaView Data download.  The download is found here: http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html (which is just the resource/downloads page), then get Data (ParaViewData3.4.zip).

The dataset you are looking for is can.ex2.  disk_out_ref.ex2 is another good dataset.  Both of these are found in the Data directory.

Hi all,

I see that there is a crushed can test case in VTK for temporal data management, illustrated here (bottom of the page):
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Time_Support

Is this test case available in the ParaView examples?
I unfartunately do not see it in the ParaView 3.4.0 package.

I thank you in advance for your help!

Subject: [Paraview] problems with new version of ffmpeg
Message-ID: <BAY122-W463D4835D6059E1F8AB2F5BCCB0@phx.gbl>


Hi!

I?ve recently updated my ffmpeg-library and it seems that the function "img_convert", used by paraview, is not implemented any more. Is there already a new paraview version without this problem or is it soon released? Just out of interest. 
 In the meanwhile I turned the option "VTK_USE_FFMPEG" (something like that it is called) off. 

thx,
Natalie

This is bug 7522.

You can turn it off, dump images and use some external program (like
ffmpeg command line) to put them together into a file, or use the old
version of ffmpeg recommended on this page
http://www.vtk.org/get-software.php#addons.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview vs. nVidia Driver
Message-ID: <497F6662.4070406@arl.army.mil>

Has anyone had any trouble building Paraview with the latest nVidia GL 
libraries?  On both RH4 and RH5, we've not been able to compile Paraview 
3.4.0 (or 3.2.1) against nVidia driver 180.22 or 180.25.    We can build 
against nVidia driver 173.14.xx.   Also, if we build on a system that 
has driver 173.14.xx and then try to execute 'paraview' on a system with 
a 180.22 driver, we also get a floating point exception error.   

The compile failure is a floating point exception and looks like this:

[89%] Built target pvpython-real

Huh, that's weird. vtkSMExtractDocumentation links against OpenGL but
does not make any OpenGL calls. Can you build debug and try to get a

Hi, 

This is my frist go at using the vtkMultiBlockDataSet interface.
I am creating a vtkMultiblockDataSetAlgorithm which has for input a
vtkMultiBlockDataSet with names for each block (EnSight data).
I would like my algorithm to output a vtkMultiBlockDataSet which is
completely different but keeps the names for each block.
Should I do the following ?

output->GetMetaData(iblock)->Copy(input->GetMetaData(iblock))
(loop over iblock)

That'd work. But it will copy other information (besides names), if
any was well.
You can explicitly get the value of vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME() key
from the input meta-data and if present copy it to the output.

if (input->GetMetaData(iblock)->Has(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME()))
  {
  output->GetMetaData(oblock)->GetMetaData()->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
   input->GetMetaData(iblock)->Get(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME()));
  }

Hi,

i checked out yesterday the current version of pv and compiled it -
starting it, it fails searching for some libs. In the mailing list i
found that VTK_USE_RPATH has to switched off. Further on, i used

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5

Starting pv it gives:

/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5/paraview-real: error while loading shared
libraries: libKWCommon.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file
or directory

Playing around i found using also the libs of the compiled 3.4

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5:/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.4

it works.

My question: Is this the right way - or is it a bug (feature) of the
current CVS-version?

Best regards,

     Stefan

Hi Stefan,

Even when you set VTK_USE_RPATH to off, you shouldn't have to set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. ParaView does a forwarding trick that should make it
work without setting the path. I am guessing you installed using make
install? Can you send us a list of all files under
/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5? Also, can you run paraview with the --ldd
argument and post the output?

Hmm, it looks like there is a bug and libKWCommon is not being
installed. What happens if you manually copy it from your build tree
to /usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5?

David,

Did you get this working? I am not sure what you mean by "the volume
rendering seems to have a bug with this method". Are you seeing an
error or crash?

Berk/all,
This is a current bug in the ParaView install.  I have had to copy the libKWCommon.so file from the lib/paraview-3.5 directory to the bin directory for a few weeks now.  I have only seen the problem with Linux, but have not tried XP or OS-X.

Hmm, it looks like there is a bug and libKWCommon is not being installed. What happens if you manually copy it from your build tree to /usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5?

Thank you, 

That will help. What I am intending to do is modify the
vtkIntegrateAttributes class so to be a vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm so
that the result of the integration are available then for each block. I
think I'm almost there but I'm now trying to understand the whole Controller
thing and how to deal with the processes....

That'd work. But it will copy other information (besides names), if any was
well.
You can explicitly get the value of vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME() key from the
input meta-data and if present copy it to the output.

if (input->GetMetaData(iblock)->Has(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME()))
  {
 
output->GetMetaData(oblock)->GetMetaData()->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
   input->GetMetaData(iblock)->Get(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME()));
  }

Hi Stefan, 

I've hit this as well, but you don't get the same problem when you don't
finalise with an "install".

Subject: [Paraview] Compilation of current paraview-CVS failed...

Hi,

i checked out yesterday the current version of pv and compiled it - starting
it, it fails searching for some libs. In the mailing list i found that
VTK_USE_RPATH has to switched off. Further on, i used

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5

Starting pv it gives:

/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5/paraview-real: error while loading shared
libraries: libKWCommon.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

Playing around i found using also the libs of the compiled 3.4

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5:/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.4

it works.

My question: Is this the right way - or is it a bug (feature) of the current
CVS-version?

Best regards,

     Stefan

Hi all,
I will take a look at this, since it's probably related to recent 
development install changes.

Message-ID: <c7269c9e0901281305h55cfebeas61ce47ad6ee7e7ba@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
While compiling parallel version of paraview, I get this error message

[ 34%] Built target vtkVolumeRenderingPython
Linking CXX shared library ../../bin/libvtkParallel.so
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libnuma.so when searching for

and using openmpi version 1.2.7 compiled with intel compiler 10.1

Any suggestion is much appreciated

thank you

Hmmm. I can't reproduce this. Can you share a dataset that
demonstrates the problem?

This is indeed a difficult problem. I can't think of one or more
filters that can compute the wall distance. What about computing a
derived quantity such as shear that would be large in the boundary
layer. Maybe you can use that to threshold?

I applied the slice filter to get the cut, then the connectivity filter to mark the regionIDs, and then applied the extraction filter (ExtractCellsByRegion). I then applied the IntegrateVariables filter. Under temperature, I can read 12'200. How can I calculate the average? Divide this by number of cells? by number of data points? or by the area in square meters? guess the latter, right?

Subject: [Paraview] best way to update a custom reader
Message-ID: <498159F4.7070706@itis.ethz.ch>

Hi,

What is the best way to update my custom reader?
I have a complex pipeline and my timesteps are continuously coming in - 
reloading the dataset and rebuilding the settings every time is not very 
funny.
I CAN do it by calling RequestInformation (where I set the time range 
etc) each time I press 'left' or 'right' on the animation tab, but slows 
down playback, because the function does some extra IO. Maybe a custom 
filter calling RequestInformation of current dataset? Any other ideas?

Message-ID: <56281f5e0901290053w45bc250btf53f28486d2bd884@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm using ParaView 3.4 to load the results of a transient simulation
via a pvd file and a set
of vtp XML PolyData files. Each vtp file corresponds to a particular real time
value which are not evenly spaced. I tried to provide the real time
values via the timestep key
in the pvd file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep="1.23"  group="" part="0" file="sp_test0000000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="2.34"  group="" part="0" file="sp_test0002498.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="3.15"  group="" part="0" file="sp_test0004496.vtp"/>
</Collection>
</VTKFile>

It seems that ParaView expects integer values for the timestep key, because
it loads the files like expected but the time table in the Object
Inspector -> Information
tab shows for the above pvd file:
Index   Value
0         1
1         2
2         3

I would be grateful for any help/suggestions.

Thanks,
Christian Wellmann

This works for me. Can't comment on why you are having trouble, but 
maybe try to remove the group, part unused tags.

I use CVS paraview (3.4 should work)

Thanks Stephen and John for your quick answers.
Unfortunately any changes to the group and/or part tag not seem to
solve the problem.
What is strange is that, although ParaView seems to read an int value,
it is able
to handle

<DataSet timestep="-922337203685477580825263735124730" group=""
part="0" file="sp_test0000000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 922337203685477580825263735124730" group=""
part="0" file="sp_test0002498.vtp"/>

correctly, what gives me

Index      Value
0            -9.22337e+32
1             9.22337e+32

in the time table although the values are out of range of any standard
integer representation I guess.
However, as a workaround -considering the large range of representable
integer values- I will simpliy
change my scale to micro- or even nano-seconds to get integer time values.

Hi all,

I have been using the curvature filter in ParaView on a test case.
Curvature seems indeed computed, but a single blue color is displayed on the
screen.
(picture joined)

I was awaiting something more talkative: red color where the shape is
curved, blue where it is flat...

Did I miss a basic step?
(you can see the pipeline on the screenshot)

I can send the vtu file as well if that helps.
(I don't do it because the mail limit size is quite low)

Thanks in advance for your help!
Regards,

Pierre

  I've compiled the last cvs version from source.

  PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ON

  which sets

  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON

  If I run from the compilation directory everything is fine.

  If I run from the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory (after doing make 
install) I get this message:

  The install dir is /opt/paraview

  Any ideas?

Hi Ricardo,

just  switch the VTK_USE_RPATH off - then it should work (for me with 
the version checked out this moring) ...

Forgot to mention, VTK_USE_RPATH was/is OFF

I'm checking out and re-compiling.

Does anyone know why using PYTHON implies SHARED LIBS ?

Hi all. As I now figured out, the problem with my real timestep values
seems to be the decimal separator. Strangely my ParaView 3.4
installation seems to require a comma as decimal separator. So

<DataSet timestep="0,5e-5" group="0" part="0"
file="hour_5121_fall_se0000000.vtp"/>

is interpreted correctly and gives the time value 0.5e-5.
The idea of using a comma as decimal separator came into my mind
using the "Annotate Time" filter, which shows comma separated values
in my installation.

Is it possible that the lookup table range is incorrect? Can you edit
color table range to not be as high as 820.

Hi Utkarsh,

You're indeed right.
Thanks for your help! I had this idea, but I have not been so low in my
previous tests, and I was not seeing color evolves.
 However, why is the curvature so important at the edges? I was not aware
edges would be kind of singular "points"...

Thanks again!
Regards,

Pierre

It must be some part of our build process.  If we download the 
precompiled Paraview executable, it works fine.   If I do a generic 
build using the source code, it also works.   So, there must be some 
flag or something in our production build tree that's causing a problem 
with the nVidia 180-xx drivers.

Because Python modules have to be built as shared libraries if you
want to load them from the standard Python executable.

Message-ID: <4982BD44.7050407@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Dear VTK Developers


I would like to use the vtkResampleImage class in Paraview (plugin). For 
this purpose it would be helpful if in addition to the methods

SetAxisMagnificationFactor (int axis, double factor)
SetAxisOutputSpacing (int axis, double spacing)


which are valid for axis 0,1 and 2, following new functions could be added:

SetAxisMagnificationFactor (double, double, double)
SetAxisOutputSpacing (double, double, double)


i.e. taking values for all three axis directions simultaneously.


Could this be done?


Thanks in advance!

Bryn

Hi,

I tried to do what you talked about, because I need isotropic volumes
for a number of algorithms. I think it is the same for you, right?

I wrote an xml file that you can load in the plugin manager menu,
according to this wiki page:

The problem is that the VTK filter seems not to be paraview-compliant:
it didn't work, but unfortunately I didn't have time to describe the
bugs. I joint the xml file, so that you can try and please tell me if
it works for you -then I may guess it is because of my settings...-.

In a nutshell, here are my problems for a volume of spacing 0.5x0.5x1
that I want to be 0.5x0.5x0.5 ie magnification factor = 0.5 on axis z
(= 2)
- The filter updates, but the extent does not change in the output
- When representation of input is 'Slice', the output dimensionality is 2 !!!

I hope someone could find the mistake, wherever it comes (my xml,
paraview, or VTK)

I also write a Cxx class that inherites from vtkImageResample and
computes automatically the magnification factor depending on a
user-chosen reference axis (in my example, x or y). Today, I use an
independent executable that converts an input mhd file into an
isotropic volume, and then I open it in paraview. I would be glad if
this step is part of a paraview pipeline, but my inherited class has
the same behaviour than vtkImageResample (and I think that when I
tried with the parent class vtkImageReslice, the same problem
occured...).

This numa library somehow is being picked up as something to be linked
against. I did not hear of this library before. Can you search for it
in you CMakeCache.txt?

Subject: [Paraview] vtk data objects as property: how to handle that in
	Paraview?
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0901300424i330cb665t6e44027f77b7527a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Some VTK filters, such as vtkImageReslice, have vtkImageData as
property. This is not really an input, just an object than may give
information about, for example, spacing, extent, data type, etc.
What is the property to be used in a paraview XML plugin file ? I
wondered about ProxyProperty, but I am not sure how to use it in the
case of vtkImageReslice.

In other words, when a VTK filter has accessor like:
vtkSetMacro( Information, vtkImageData* );

What is the XML corresponding? Maybe that:
<ProxyProperty name="Information"
                         command="SetInformation"
                          ... >
When to tell this is an image data ? How the user can give the image
data to the proxy ? As the InputProperty is linked to the
vtkAlgorithmOutput type, it cannot be used in this case...


Thank you!

Jerome

Hi,

I have tried it in a similar way with no success.


It works though using following Set-methods:

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkImageResample2::SetOutputSpacing(double v[3])
{
   this->SetOutputSpacing(v[0],v[1],v[2]);
}

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkImageResample2::SetOutputSpacing(double v0,double v1,double v2)
{
   this->SetAxisOutputSpacing(0,v0);
   this->SetAxisOutputSpacing(1,v1);
   this->SetAxisOutputSpacing(2,v2);
}



With standard xml description:

       <DoubleVectorProperty
          name="OutputSpacing"
          command="SetOutputSpacing"
          number_of_elements="3"
          default_values="0 0 0" >
       </DoubleVectorProperty>



I have place the code here:

http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~blloyd/vtkImageResample2/



This seems to work (extent is changed say for MagnifactionFactos="0.5 
0.5 1.0"). But the image data becomes invisible. I think it converts the 
PointData->Arrays to some other form, e.g. image scalars or something, 
which paraview doesn't display.

This sounds like a poor filter design. It sounds like instead of
exposing a filter's properties through public setters and getters, the
developer bundled all of them into one property object. I'd recommend
subclassing this filter to add proper setters and getters and
including the subclass in ParaView as a plugin.

Hi

I am trying to  build    paraview 3.4.0
I am using Qt 4.3.5

when cmake finishes to configure   I got :
CMake Error: This project requires some variables to be set,
and cmake can not find them.
QT_FONTCONFIG_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_FREETYPE_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_PNG_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_X11_ICE_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_X11_SM_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_X11_X11_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_X11_Xext_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_XCURSOR_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_XINERAMA_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_XI_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_XRANDR_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
QT_XRENDER_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)


How can I force Paraview to be configured without  all these libraries
(mostly X11 dev stuff )  . I used the same qt4.3.5 to build PV3.3 and
that time i didnt have these problems

Cheers

Orlando

Subject: [Paraview] Converting selections
Message-ID: <188236.4218.qm@web110101.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm programming a plugin which writes in a file the ids of the current selected cells in the vtkUnstructuredGrid displayed in ParaView. In my code I write something like this:

pqSelectionManager* selMan = (pqSelectionManager*)(pqApplicationCore::instance()->manager("SelectionManager"));

pqOutputPort* port = selMan->getSelectedPort();
??? 
vtkSMSourceProxy* activeSelection=port->getSelectionInput();

and get the property "IDs", just like the pqExtractSelectionsPanel class does. Of course, if the user made a selection by Frustum or Threshold, I should get the properties "Frustum" or "Thresholds" respectively, but they wouldn't "store" the cell id's, but some other information. I'm wondering if there is a way to convert a selection from frustum and/or threshold (or any other type) to a selection by IDs, that is: getting the IDs of the cells from a Frustum selection. I've been looking at classes vtkSelectionConverter and vtkPConvertSelection, but couldn't figure out a way of doing this. How can it be made ?

Thanks for any help,
Rafael March.

This is a kernel interface library for fine grained process control it's 
probably a dependency of openmpi. I think the error message:

Linking CXX shared library ../../bin/libvtkParallel.so
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libnuma.so when searching for
-lnuma



means libnuma was compiled as 32 bit .so. I used to get these from time 
to time on my old opteron system you have to build stuff with -fpic and 
-m64.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview on a tiled display
Message-ID: <3755b5990901300721xd77e252qbd77e185a9557c59@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,


We are trying to configure and run Paraview 3.4.0 on a tiled display with
the following command:

mpirun -np 8 --mca btl ^openib,udapl --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo --hostfile
/home/imagine/ParaView/hosts /bin/env DISPLAY=:0
~/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty/ParaView3.3-cvs/platforms/linux64Gcc/bin/pvserver
--server-port=1100 -tdx=1 -tdy=2

Then when we connect throught the paraview client it doesn't show in the two
displays we requested.

So, is there a guideline or some kind of command/configuration we are
missing so it can be displayed as wished?



Thnaks in advance.

This should answer your question.

You can patch the qatomic_windows.h header file.

What's the version of CMake you are using?  Later versions of CMake can 
handle that problem.
Some Linux distros don't install those development packages when the Qt 
development package is installed, which means they had to modify the Qt 
installation in ways that CMake's FindQt4.cmake didn't expect.  That 
might be what you're seeing.

What do you mean by new version of ServerManager? Are you referring to
a new version of the python scripting interface?

Rafael,

Try looking at  pqSelectionManager::getIndices. It may be possible for
you to just call that method to get the list of selected ids.

Hi again,

It seems the vtkImageResample filter (and it's parent vtkImageReslice 
probably too) does not give the output array a name (unless no 
resampling is done).

This would seem to be a bug. However, I couldn't follow the code in 
vtkImageReslice to see where the name could be set or what the problem is.

Cheers
Bryn

I found the problem, and it seems so simple now.  In addition to the 
server .xml file, I needed to create a .bqrc file for the client side.

I figured this out by reading both the "Animating Legacy VTK File 
Series" and the "Plugin How-to" wiki pages and putting the knowledge 
together.  Would anyone object to me laying this out a little more 
explicitly in the "Animating Legacy..." page (only the one on 
paraview.org, not the one on vtk.org)?  I could append a section called 
"File Series Plugins for Existing Readers" or something like that.
