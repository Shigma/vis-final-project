That is a strange error. Usually it prints what library it had an issue
with. That said, I am assuming you're numpy was built against lapack/blas or
clapack? Are those dlls in your path as well?

Subject: [Paraview] vtkSMExtractDocumentation linking error for ParaView
	3.8.1
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=8c441R0QQFZWCbqp6cr-aDAUWA5dt8S6AR16V@mail.gmail.com>

I'm setting up ParaView 3.8.1 (stable version from source linked on the
website) on our cluster and running into a linking error.

the error is
"[ 87%] Built target vtkPVServerManager
Linking CXX executable ../../bin/vtkSMExtractDocumentation
../../bin/libvtkPVServerCommon.so: undefined reference to `MD5'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status"

and I have
 OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARIES
/usr/lib64/libssl.a:/usr/lib64/libcrypto.a
 OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR              /usr/include
 OPENSSL_LIBRARIES

 OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARIES            /usr/lib64/libssl.a:/usr/lib64/libcrypto.a
set via ccmake.

I've tried both the static and the shared versions of the libraries on
the machine. I've tried using different versions of CMake (2.8.1 vs.
2.8.2). A simple program using MD5 compiles against these libraries no
problem gcc -o md5sum md5sum.c -lcrypto, I've done an ldd on this test
program md5sum binary to verify that it is indeed pointing to the same
libs that I've pointed to in the PV build. I've tried manually adding
the locations of the libraries to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I've also tried
putting INCLUDE(FindOpenSSL) in my CMakeLists.txt. Now I'm out of new
ideas.

Subject: [Paraview] .cosmo file format?
Message-ID: <4CCED894.1070104@sara.nl>

Hi,

Is there some documentation on the file format "Cosmology files
(.cosmo)" supported in PV? I've been reading "Analyzing and visualizing
cosmological simulations with paraview" by Woodring et.al, where the
cosmological support that was added to PV 3.8 is described. The .cosmo
file format is mentioned, but the given reference where it is supposedly
introduced doesn't mention it at all. Reading the parallel .cosmo reader
and related source files doesn't give me a clearer picture either.

Thanks,
Paul

This is how Jon responded (with minor edits from me) off-list:
--------
The cosmo file format is simple, it is just a record format/list of
particles: 7 floats and 1 32-bit int per record/particle, no header.

x1 vx1 y1 vy1 z1 vz1 mass1 tag1
x2 vx2 y2 vy2 z2 vz2 mass2 tag2
x3 vx3 y3 vy3 z3 vz3 mass3 tag3
...
xN vxN yN vyN zN vzN massN tagN

x y z = particle position (float)
vx vy vz = particle velocity (float)
mass = scalar quantity (float)
tag = unique id (int)

You can have multiple files as well, as long as the file ends in a number,
or ends in a number before the cosmo tag, e.g.:

file1.cosmo
file2.cosmo
...
fileN.cosmo

or

file001
file002
file003

Lastly, the format is binary, not ascii.  So 32 bytes per particle, and the
size of your file will be N * 32 bytes.

Utkarsh,

I've updated that page (http://mypage.iu.edu/~heiland/pv-stuff/) with my latest playing around.  Basically, I discovered the "Plot Over Line" filter which does sort of what I want - ability to plot a row in an ImageData.  However, I have a few questions:

1) why doesn't the plot dynamically update as I move (or as I move and then release the picked line source)?  It almost seems to update at random.  Does this have something to do with my PV Settings?  I do have "Auto Accept" on.

2) is there some way to constrain the line source to take on only integer Y values?  Basically, I only want to plot the exact values within the ImageData, no interpolation.

3) Instead of the Plot Over Line, I tried to use a VOI filter on the ImageData, thinking I might be able to extract just the row I wanted to plot, but saw that I am not allowed to specify a 1-D VOI.

thanks, Randy

I can (sort of) already select a row in my ImageData, if I use a 3D view (http://mypage.iu.edu/~heiland/pv-stuff/).  But is there some magic to connect that selection to a port, that triggers an update to a plot window, etc?

We would like the ability to select a region of the ImageData, e.g. select an entire row, and have an X-Y plot be displayed in another window.  So, in this use case, one window (ImageData) remains static, but as a new row is selected, another window (plot/chart) is dynamically updated.  I'd welcome pointers to docs/examples and suggestions.

Hi,

     I have a HDF5 file with half-precision-float stored as

         DATATYPE  H5T_STD_I16LE

     Has anyone managed to load such data into Paraview?

     What is the workflow?

     I have success loading single float HDF5 datasets via XDMF.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimEEt9gpkUJRe-H7KXhnJ-aMtU3o55VtQXWq5Z7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When turning on HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL, the XDMF reader hangs. Without
it, everything works fine (even when running the server in parallel).
Parallel HDF5 works fine on the system in other applications (the file
I'm trying to read in was created with parallel HDF5). This is on a
64-bit Linux cluster with with a Lustre file system and a recent
Paraview 3.9 from CVS, compiled with Mesa support. Is this feature
supposed to work? If so, I would be grateful for any hints on what I
should try. Also, I seem to remember there being an option to use a
user-supplied version of HDF5 - is this still available/recommended? I
couldn't find the correct CMAKE option for it.

Best wishes,
Tobias

Hi Tobias,

I doubt anyone has tested this as those options originate from HDF5 itself
and only have been available for around 2 months. I would suspect that work
needs to be done in Xdmf to support parallel HDF5. You can specify your own
HDF5 by enabaling PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5, reconfiguring and then setting
the necessary HDF5 library/header variables in ccmake/cmake-gui. The version
included in ParaView is the 1.8.5 release available on the HDF5 groups
website.

Also, would you mind reporting a bug on paraview.org/Bug and also a simple
dataset that recreates the issue? That way the issue won't be forgotten.

Subject: [Paraview] How to use a filter in a Python script?
Message-ID: <20101103022721.M55722@accutrol.com>

I am a newbie to Paraview and have little experience programming Python.  I 
would like to know how to call a particular filter from within Python.  The 
only filter I have seen referenced in the Python scripting documentation is 
Shrink().

I want to retrieve the scalar values along a line segment (Plot Over 
Line(ProbeLine)) that extends through an unstructured 3D grid.  I have "The 
ParaView Guide", "The VTK User's Guide" and "The Visualization Toolkit:  An 
Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics".  I don't see how to programmatically 
do this.  I have looked on all of the ParaView web sites that I can find, and 
in tutorials.  I do not even see a list of available filter names.

Is there a guide for Python Scripting (chapter 20 of The ParaView Guide is the 
best I have found) that covers using filters?  Example code?  Anything?  How 
do you even find the filter names in the documentation?

Thanks for any help,
Hamilton Woods

Message-ID: <396130.98883.qm@web120507.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello There,

I am trying to print the "save screenshot" of a vtu file with 0.5 opacity. But when I specify the file name to be saved, the program crashes. If I save it without opacity it works fine. Could you please suggest me how do I save with opacity.

Thank you,

Manoj

Subject: [Paraview] OBJ reader, Points+normals
Message-ID: <781607.9716.qm@web110410.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Dear List,

I recently compiled paraview 3.8 in order to use the new wavefront/OBJ reader. I have a vector cloud in an OBJ file (point+attached vector) that I would like to visualise, and thought this might be a solution.

However, I ran the OBJ reader, and the normals for the points are loaded, but the normals appear to not be recognised.

The file contents look something like this:
---------
# OBJ file, containing only points and normals
#

v 315 -62.3371 156.152
vn -0.157145 0.722267 -0.673525
v 315 -44.3808 162.142
vn 0.146189 0.69951 -0.69951
v 315 -53.3286 163.284
vn 0.26163 0.694284 -0.670462
v 315 -35.2797 162.731
vn -0.103498 0.690928 -0.715477
---------
and so on.

There is a 1:1 correspondence between points and normals. However when using the as-given reader, applying the glyph filter with 2D arrow mode shows all the normals as pointing along the X axis with the same magnitude (scaling mode set to "vector").

I tried hacking up the code in IO/vtkOBJReader.cxx , but to be honest I don't know what I am doing. I forced an unconditional call to

std::cerr << "Forcing normals" << std::endl;
output->GetPointData()->SetNormals(new_normals);

directly after

if(everything_ok)
{


but  this was unsuccesful, although the print statement is run.

I checked that the vn lines are being parsed by using print statements, and it appears that they are. The points are also loaded just fine, and the visualisation output is correct.

Any hints? I am unfamiliar with the VTK library unfortunately -- perhaps there is an alternate representation (not OBJ) that I can use to do this? Alternatively someone can suggest an easy patch to this?

My next stop is to hack up an OpenGL tutorial...


Thanks.

Can you save the imported file as a vtp file and upload it somewhere and
post a link to it? We can poke around to see if it has been imported
properly and you are just missing a step in Paraview or if it has not been
imported properly.

Hey Hamilton,

You should also try using the Python Trace (and Trace State) functionality now built into ParaView. After (or while) you set up your pipeline in ParaView this will give you a Python script to accomplish the same thing. This page tells a bit about the current (git) version:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools

You'll see the Start Trace and Trace State if you go to Tools->Python Shell, and then click on the Trace tab on the right of the panel.

Dude!  You are sooooo awesome!  Why didn't I think of that?  Because 
I thought trace was for something altogether different from that.  

Now I feel like I can do anything!

Thanks immensely for your help,

Hi Christine,

As far as I am aware (and doing some of my own grepping) I am not finding
any dependency on MD5 in ParaView/VTK, so this is very puzzling. Are you
using some kind of secure MPI? Anyway, just adding in FindOpenSSL won't help
as it won't change what libraries ParaView links to. You could try adding
-lcrypto to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and CMAKE_C_FLAGS in ccmake/cmake-gui. But as I
said, this shouldn't be required.

Message-ID: <C8F71F2F.1B738%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The ParaView developers are pleased to announce that we will be holding a tutorial on the ParaView coprocessing library at this year's Supercomputing conference for simulation developers and advanced ParaView users.  The coprocessing library is a concise API that allows you to integrate the parallel ParaView services with another application to perform in-situ visualization or other analyses.  Although designed to be coupled with simulation, the coproessing library could be used for subservient processing in any application.  This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the API, how to bind it to other languages, how to dynamically change the visualization via Python scripting, and how to use the ParaView GUI to automatically generate Python scripts.

The tutorial will be held on Sunday, November 14.  To register, go to the Supercomputing web site (http://sc10.supercomputing.org/) and register for the Sunday tutorials.  For more information, see the tutorial Wiki page (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SC10_Coprocessing_Tutorial).

Subject: [Paraview] OBJ reader bug
Message-ID: <790498.91804.qm@web110408.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Dear List,

Continuing a conversation I had off-list with David Doria, there appears to be a possible bug with the OBJ reader.

The process goes like this, please forgive my terminology:

1) Using the attached OBJ file, read it, then place a glyph filter on the tree.
2) Note that the attached glyph filter has no arrays. All glyph vectors point along (1,0,0).
3) Delete the glyph filter, then save the paraview pipeline as a VTP file.
4) clear the tree
5) open the VTP file
6) attach a glyph filter. Note there is now a "Normals_" array. 

-> Why did the glyph filter not work on the OBJ to show the normals? Is this a bug?

OBJ file. Save as something like "data.obj". In case of attachment scrubbing/email wrapping, the file is both attached and in-line

Subject: [Paraview] Adding Reader Plugin to "Files of Type" dialogue
Message-ID: <AANLkTinr1UWJ6oGsSmWNqo4qZAZW_CHjLNnETe=VNAx5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I cannot get my reader into ParaView's "File -> Open" dialog.  I am
following the "CSVImageReader" tutorial here:
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/WritingAParaViewReaderPlug-in.html

I built ParaView-3.8.1 from source using qt-4.5.3 on my 64-bit Linux
workstation (FWIW, I've also tried this on my Mac OSX 10.5.8 box using
Nokia's qt-4.6.2 dmg release for 10.5+).  I built the libCSVImage.so after
adding the following to the top of vtkCSVImageReader.cxx:

#include "vtkCSVImageReader.h"
#include "vtkDataArray.h"
#include "vtkImageData.h"
#include "vtkInformation.h"
#include "vtkInformationVector.h"
#include "vtkObjectFactory.h"
#include "vtkPointData.h"
#include "vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.h"
#include "vtkTable.h"
#include "vtkVariant.h"
vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkCSVImageReader);


I start up ParaView, goto "Tools -> Manage Plugins -> Load New ..." and I
now see "CSVImage" as "Loaded" in the "Local Plugins" pane.  However, the
"File -> Open" menu doesn't show the CSVImage type.

When I attempt to open a *.csvimg file, I am prompted with a dialog titled
"Open Data WIth ..." saying "A reader for
/home/schmitt/paraview/testData/test.csvimg" could not be found.  Please
choose one:"  and a list of 22 readers ("POP Ocean" through "TecPlot", but
no CSVImage type.

What am I doing wrong?

Thank you,
Pete Schmitt

Hi,

Yes the trace is great, it still couldn't tell me how to actually
extract the numbers along a plotoverline though, without doing a
Spreadsheet view or something.

You have probably figured out how to do a plotoverline using the Trace:

from paraview.simple import *
reader = servermanager.sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName = "/var/tmp/file.vtu")
pl = PlotOverLine(Input = reader)
pl.Source.Point1 = [-7000, -5000, 0]
pl.Source.Point2 = [4300, 6300, 1111.75]
CreateXYPlotView()
d = Show()
d.XArrayName = 'arc_length'
d.SeriesVisibility = ['namecolours (0)', '0', 'namecolours (1)', '0', 'namecolours (2)', '0', 'vtkValidPointMask', '0', 'arc_length', '0'] # whatever your variables are
d.UseIndexForXAxis = 0
Render()

But to actually get the values out you don't even need to do the plot
a simple:

from paraview.simple import *
reader = servermanager.sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName = "/var/tmp/file.vtu")
pl = PlotOverLine(Input = reader)
pl.Source.Point1 = [-7000, -5000, 0]
pl.Source.Point2 = [4300, 6300, 1111.75]

does, followed by stuff like this:

# to get the number of points on the plotoverline line
pl = servermanager.Fetch(pl)
pl.GetPoints().GetData().GetNumberOfPoints()

# to get the (x,y,z) info for the points on the pol line
pl.GetPoints().GetData().GetValue(0) -> x of first point
pl.GetPoints().GetData().GetValue(1) -> y of first point
pl.GetPoints().GetData().GetValue(2) -> z of first point
etc

# to get the data on the line
pl.GetPointData().GetArray(0).GetValue(0)
etc

# and to get the name of the array on the line
pl.GetPointData().GetArrayName(0) -> 'cfnode'
etc

Hi,

Thanks Jerome.  You are dead right!  The writer doesn't want
vtkpolydata, rather vtkimagedata.  Grrrr, silly me.  I couldn't figure
out how to convert vtkpolydata to vtkimagedata without actually
rendering to the screen unfortunately.

Actually I found a really old posting on this mailing list (damn, lost
it now) that says that "Offscreen screenshots" aren't possible, unless
you compile paraview with offscreen rendering.  Don't know if this is
still true or not.  But, it appears I am after something too
difficult.

Anyway, I did figure out how to just extract the numbers of the
vtkpolydata, using commands like this:

pl.GetPoints().GetData().GetValue(0)
and
pl.GetPointData().GetArray(0).GetValue(0)

etc

so I can throw them into an array and use matplotlib.

Thanks again

Matt Wilkins

  Hi Peter,

The way PV learns about plugin reader extensions changed some time ago. 
The place we specify the file extension association moved from the gui 
xml to the server manager xml in the SourceProxy's hints.

Here are the modified XML files.

<!-- CSVImage.xml -->
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
<ProxyGroup name=?sources?>
<SourceProxy
name=?CSVImageReader?
class=?vtkCSVImageReader?>

<StringVectorProperty
name=?FileName?
command=?SetFileName?
number_of_elements=?1?>
<FileListDomain name=?files?/>
</StringVectorProperty>

<StringVectorProperty
name=?FieldDelimiterCharacters?
command=?SetFieldDelimiterCharacters?
number_of_elements=?1?
default_values=?,?/>

<!-- This is how PV now makes the association -->
<Hints>
<ReaderFactory
extensions="csvimg"
file_description="blah blah blah."/>
</Hints>

</SourceProxy>
</ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>
<!-- EOF -->

<!-- CSVImageGUI.xml -->
<ParaViewReaders>

<!-- No information about file extension association -->
<Proxy group="sources" name="CSVImageReader" />

</ParaViewReaders>
<!-- EOF -->

Hope this helps
Burlen

Ps. I think the gui xml is now optional.

If it helps, there is an example of how to write a python programmable
filter that outputs image data here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.#Producing_Image_Data_.28Source.29

You could modify this to be a filter that takes polydata from the
PlotOverLine and outputs an image data.  The wiki example may be slightly
complicated to read because it is written in a way that it works as a
parallel filter.  You might be able to skip this part for your purposes.

Subject: [Paraview] custom reader and extra libs (blas) link problem
Message-ID: <4CD27DDB.6070607@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

I have a custom reader, and I have to do a lot of computations to 
generate the data.
I want to use blas to speed up the computations.

How can I link my plugging to the blas library???
the cmake macro  ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(..   does not have any option for 
extra libraries.
and when I try  to use it I get :
/.../bin/paraview: symbol lookup error: /../libPGDReader.so: undefined 
symbol: cblas_saxpy

If I use the pluging in a vtk project I explicitly link the library and 
everything work fine.


I have another question:
Can my reader know if it used in paraview or in a c++ project (only 
vtk)?? (I want to automatised some things if is used in paraview)?

thanks

Hello,
to add an extra library you have to add this kind of lines in the CMAKE file
:
in order to find the library :
FIND_LIBRARY(MY_LIBRARY mylib.so
  /usr/local/lib
  /usr/lib
)

in order to link with the librarie
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myReader
  ${MY_LIBRARY}
  )

Best regards,
Didier

Yes, the following link points to the section regarding how to get
access to the camera:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Representations_and_Views

Once you have the camera, you can use the vtkCamera API to zoom or do
whatever (http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCamera.html)

	site-packages
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=nvD+M47Mgcov5aHLhRjCoB_kJVCfcuEr3jdKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to install all the python extensions for paraview and vtk into my
python interpreter instead of pvpython/vtkpython. I used to do this with
just the VTK extensions by running the usual 'python setup.py install' in
VTK/Wrapping/Python but can't find a similar route for the paraview stuff. I
know how to set it up via environment variables; I'm asking about how to do
a standard install.

Thanks,
Chris

Subject: [Paraview] SC10 CoProcessing example
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=e5-5VTcCyyQd1TSXV_pKpWeQPgheu4Xa2VXkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've got a few questions about the python example, CoProcessingExample.py.
First, FYI, when downloaded to my mac the script contains indentation errors
so python can't parse it. Don't know what is going on (maybe our firewall is
trying to prevent us from using python by messing up the indentation!).
Second, my interepreter couldn't find the mpi module even though my
PYTHONPATH etc were set up as on the wiki. I use mpi4py to manipulate mpi
anyway, so I just modified the script to use it instead. Will that be OK in
general or do I need to track down the mpi module in order for the
coprocessing library to work correctly?

In terms of using the example, I constructed an image source in paraview and
colored it with the pointData, then saved the state script. I had to get
some of the name strings straightened out but the example appeared to run
and generated a sequence of png files. Does anybody have a simpler
state/coprocessing script for that example that I can use for learning
purposes?  The next thing to do is expose my solver's vtk data structures to
the co-processor and generate a coprocessing script for it. I'm afraid given
my weak understanding of what is going on, generating the state script from
one of my xdmf data sets and trying to get it to work inside the
coprocessing is going to be difficult (our i/o and existing vtk
visualization are completely independent). It might be easier if I new how
to wrote the state script by hand to execute something very simple. I've got
lots of vtk pipelines set up for the data under our current approach to
runtime vtk viz so I was hoping I could just paste in something similar into
the state script.

Thanks,
Chris

Hi,

Thanks for the response. Adding -lcrypto to the CMAKE_C*_FLAGS fixed things.
I had missed trying that in my investigations so thanks for suggesting that.


Still not sure why it failed there and only there, could be something with
my MPI as you mentioned I'll look into it.

Cheers,
Christine

Matt,

Dude!  You are sooooooo awesome!  Now, how can I impress my 
customers if all of the magic is gone?  

You have been reading my mail.  You are correct.  I am interested 
in integrating the data values along a line segment (in this case, 
density).  I have actually been doing this in TECPLOT, on an OLD 
Linux box.  The license upgrade for TECPLOT is prohibitively 
expensive and I am concerned that some day the Gateway 166 MHz 
box will die.  Therefore, I am converting my TECPLOT tools over 
to ParaView.

ParaView rocks!  And so does this community!

Thanks for all your help,
Hamilton Woods

Message-ID: <AANLkTinLHE6tO5OZU-9XQo=EcmU6-TGh-GOr7M_imJH1@mail.gmail.com>

I want to save an animation from a python script using pvbatch or pvpython.
Is there a python command for saving an image sequence, or do I need to
repeatedly change frames and call WriteImage() each time?

Hi John,

I don't know how one could save an entire animation from Python, but I use
WriteImage() for each frame to output a .png, and I end up with a bunch of
numbered images (I manually write the file names in a loop). That gives you
more flexibility in encoding, as you can change the frame rate, bitrate, use
more codecs, etc...Of course, if you do this, you need to use some encoding
software such as ffmpeg, mencoder, QuickTime Pro, etc in order to encode the
movie. I hope this helps,

Milos

Hi Chris,

I just fixed the formatting for the python code snippets.  As you noticed
there were problems of tabs and spaces intermixed but it's not been
converted to all spaces now.  There were also some problems with changes to
the library names (import libvtkvtkCoProcessorPython now needs to be import
vtkCoProcessorPython).

The mpi part of the sample script is for when ParaView is built in parallel
since it will call MPI functions.  If ParaView is built in serial, then that
part can be ignored and certainly coprocessing shouldn't be used for a
parallel run.

As far as simpler coprocesing scripts, if you don't generate any images the
script will be much simpler.  Unfortunately, the vtk python interface is
quite different from the pv python interface such that it would take a
decent amount of hand editing in order to convert them, at least for most
non-trivial scripts.  I think the best way to get things going with the pv
python interface is by using the python trace tools to mimic your gui
actions in a python script.  There is also tab completion in the paraview
python shell so that would be another way to figure things out.

Hello,
I recently downloaded the plugin example at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_Examples. I loaded this plugin into ParaView 3.8 and tried to load the example data. Then I got this error message:

    Cannot show the data in the current view although the view reported that it can show the data.

There is no display of the loaded example data (geometry) on screen. This example illustrates how to use ParaView's Generic Data Set.  Can some tell me what I need to do in order to see the display?

Thank you,
Jim

Hi all,

Just writing to mention that I ran into this same problem on Mac OSX 10.6.4
(just upgraded from 10.5.8 yesterday). Compiled my own qt-4.6.2 from source.
 Building ParaView 3.8.1 from source.  I fixed this by swapping the "cxx"
and "mm" extension in the "IF(Q_WS_MAC) .... ELSE" block of
Qt/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt:

IF(Q_WS_MAC)
  SET(QtWidgets_SRCS ${QtWidgets_SRCS} pqProgressBarHelper.mm)
ELSE(Q_WS_MAC)
  SET(QtWidgets_SRCS ${QtWidgets_SRCS} pqProgressBarHelper.cxx)
ENDIF(Q_WS_MAC)

Patch:

../ParaView-3.8.1/Qt/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt
101,102d100
<   SET(QtWidgets_SRCS ${QtWidgets_SRCS} pqProgressBarHelper.mm)
< ELSE(Q_WS_MAC)
103a102,103
> ELSE(Q_WS_MAC)
>   SET(QtWidgets_SRCS ${QtWidgets_SRCS} pqProgressBarHelper.mm)

The code is still compiling, but got beyond the "'class QObject' is not a
direct base of 'pqProgressBarHelper'" error.

Cheers,
Pete

This is all very strage, I have two Macs, both Snow leopard with the latest
updates and have never seen this error. I am curious what version of CMake
you are using?

Hello,

I would like to visualize RGB data files in parallel using the .pvtk 
format.  Sample files:

"colortest.pvtk"
<File version="pvtk-1.0" dataType="vtkImageData" numberOfPieces="4" 
origin="0 0 0" spacing="1 1 1" wholeExtent="0 99 0 99 0 0" >
     <Piece extent="0 49 0 49 0 0" Source="data-colortest/colortest-0.vtk"/>
     <Piece extent="0 49 50 99 0 0" Source="data-colortest/colortest-1.vtk"/>
     <Piece extent="50 99 0 49 0 0" Source="data-colortest/colortest-2.vtk"/>
     <Piece extent="50 99 50 99 0 0" Source="data-colortest/colortest-3.vtk"/>
</File>

"data-colortest/colortest-0.vtk" (1/4 of the 100x100 grid)
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
comment

DIMENSIONS 50 50 1
ORIGIN 0 0 0
SPACING 1 1 1
POINT_DATA 2500
COLOR_SCALARS color_data 3
(...unsigned char data ....)

Paraview does not have any problems with the *.vtk files.  The .pvtk file
throws the following error:

ERROR: In /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/ParaView3.2.3/VTK/Parallel/vtkPDataSetReader.cxx, 
line 1410
vtkPDataSetReader (0x945b080): Incomplete coverage.

I have tried manipulating the global and piece extents, but nothing seems 
to work.  Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <4CD3D697.60305@knmi.nl>

Hello everyone,

I have a question over reading an image file into Paraview. I have a png 
file of world map in latlon projection. But the data I have is a global 
data which should be visualized on a globe. Does anyone know whether the 
latlon image file can be converted in a globe and plot the data on top 
of it? I tried this in Paraview, the image and the data appear in two 
different window...

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <971D3AAAE60F3241973E4DFA762F548831439FB489@ivdis5.ivdwin.ivd.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hi,

I got a question regarding the 'ParticlePathlines'-filter. What I want to do is, load particle time series follow its trajectories and colour the pathlines according to a certain variable... 
If I load my time series of vtk-files (see below), apply the 'ParticlePathlines'-filter and skip through the time steps I can follow the particle trajectories. I may also choose the variable for the particles itself (TPART, see below). But for the pathlines the only options are 'Solid Color' and 'TrailId', so it's not possible to color the tracks acc. to for example TPART... Why that?
- Is sth wrong with my file?
- Do I need another paraview filter?

I am currently using the downloaded version 3.8.1.

And by the way, it is working properly using simple csv file series: after loading the series, applying TableToPoints & ParticlePathlines filter I may choose TPART for coloring the pathlines...

Any hints on that?

Thanks.
Michael

I think what you're seeing is that the default behavior is to open an
image in a 2D window. Try closing the window that opens when you open
the image, and then making the image data visible (with the little
eyeball in the pipeline inspector) when the focus is back in the
window with your other data.

Chris,

We haven't implemented support for that yet. There are two approaches,
you can post it to paraview.uservoice.com and if there's enough
interest, we can try to add support for that; alternatively, you can
try to create a setup.py for ParaView modeled on the one from VTK and
contribute it back, and we'll be more than happy to incorporate it
into ParaView.

I'm using this version of CMake, installed in Leopard prior to upgrading to
Snow Leopard:
http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.2-Darwin-universal.dmg

Also, I didn't get this error when compiling ParaView 3.8.1 on Leopard
10.5.8 just before I upgraded to Snow Leopard 10.6.4.

Cheers,
Pete

Thanks Burlen, that seemed to do the trick.  I couldn't get it to work
without the GUI xml file.  In any case, I'm happy it's working now.

Thanks again,

Subject: [Paraview] Confused by vtkWrapClientServer in my ParaView Reader
	Plugin
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=0MbQ4mC_G6hRm=0fHcsdV4aLAT13RNDV_Sscd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to implement a simple ParaView reader plugin: vtkLFMReader.  We
already have a proprietary I/O class that handles our data format:
 LFMReader.  I would like vtkLFMReader::RequestInformation and
vtkLFMReader::RequestData to call the appropriate LFMReader methods to
import my data to ParaView as a vtkStructuredGrid.  However,
vtkWrapClientServer complains "*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header
file" error while parsing "LFMReader.h".  I tried wrapping all of the
LFMReader.h with //BTX //ETX and I tried wrapping the code in
vtkLFMReader.cxx that includes this header:

//BTX
#include "LFMReader.h"
//ETX

However, I still get the "SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file".
 Is it possible to have a ParaView Reader plugin instantiate a proprietary
class to do the actual I/O?  Are there examples of this in the ParaView
release (I couldn't find anything in VTK/IO/* or Examples/Plugins/* that
seemed applicable).

Here's my CMakeLists.txt:

INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(vtkLFMReader "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML vtkLFMReader.xml
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkLFMReader.cxx LFMReader.cxx
  GUI_RESOURCE_FILES vtkLFMGUI.xml)

Thanks,
Pete

Change the macro call to follows:
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(vtkLFMReader "1.0"
??SERVER_MANAGER_XML vtkLFMReader.xml
??SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkLFMReader.cxx
  SOURCES LFMReader.cxx
??GUI_RESOURCE_FILES vtkLFMGUI.xml)

Any source files specified in SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES will be wrapped,
so ParaView was trying to wrap LFMReader.

When you upgraded to 10.6, did you also update your Xcode installation? 
10.6 requires Xcode 3.2 or later.

Utkarsh,

here you can see my sample files (vtk & csv) each consisting of 4 time steps. The csv series works as expected, the vtk series doesn't...

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Two python questions: client vtk object ->server;
 macro-> set plugin fields
Message-ID: <4CD6ACA0.8070301@illinois.edu>

Hi,
Some python client related questions -

Some Background: I have a pure-vtk python project that reads in 
volumetric and time-series polydata. I'd like to convert this to be a 
paraview plugin and macros. Ideally this would be a pure python solution 
and it would create two paraview sources (an unstructured grid and 
polydata) when the user opens a custom config file.  Eventually it would 
be great to create a default pipeline of filters too.

Q1 Is it possible to send a vtk unstructured grid object, built within a 
python macro, to the Paraview server? FYI I'll probably implement this 
with a python plugin instead but wondered if the above implementation is 
even possible with Paraview 3.8.1 (or later)?

FYI I played with TrivialProducer and GetClientSideObject but did not 
see a way to push the data back to the server without saving to disk 
first i.e. the opposite of "Fetch" and then asking paraview to load the 
files.

   import paraview.vtk as vtk
    from paraview.simple import *
    .. Create client vtk objects... Now want to display them in paraview...
   tp=TrivialProducer()
   # Proxy does not support SetOutput
   tpclient=tp.GetClientSideObject()
   tpclient.SetOutput( myvtkpolydata ) # Nothing appears on server :-(
    # How do I send my poly data and ugrid to the server without saving 
to disk?


Q2 Is about an alternative implementation idea -
An alternative would be to create a python programmable filter that 
reads in the file and wrap it as a plugin. I'd need to two plugins (one 
for the UGrid and one of the poly data). Correct? How would you 
recommend that I control these from a python macro? e.g. The python 
macro would display a filename chooser, read in some basic config 
parameters and then set the relevant parameters on each filter before 
invoking the filter.
I understand a filechooser may be possible using PyQt but am wondering 
if it's trivial to call custom methods and set attributes on a python 
programmable filter directly from a python macro (or other python 
plugin). Are there any code-snippets that you can recommend? I didnt see 
anything relevant on the wiki.

By the way, thanks for the python bindings. We find python development 
so much faster than traditional C++ development - it's great not having 
to wait for a C++ build to complete.

Thanks for your help!
Lawrence.

Ah, I thought vtkCommunicator was a ParaView class. I made a fresh
clone (which got the updated submodule) and then it built fine.

Is there ever a reason to pull ParaView without also updating the
submodules? If not, can this be done automatically with a script? It
doesn't seem to make sense to allow ParaView to be pulled when it
would go into an invalid state (like it did for me, where the new
ParaView code depends on the new VTK code). Is there a way to get git
to work kind of work like a compiler - when a "high level" command is
issued (i.e. checkout paraview), it checks to see if anything that
paraview depends on has changed and updates it before updating
ParaView?

There are many reasons why you might pull ParaView without updating
the submodules. What if you are working on a topic branch in VTK, and
want to check it builds OK with more recent ParaView master? If you do
want to get everything then I added an alias for ParaView,

git pullall

It will update ParaView, and then call git submodule update. I think
this is documented on the wiki page and the one page PDF I added
there. We could possibly make the pullall a little more intelligent
about topic branches in the future, but it should work as advertised
for most.

Is there any way besides a programmable filter to convert a double

happens to be type double).

Hello Utkarsh:

Thanks a lot for your reply. I have made some progress in using 
ParaView. I have now a script to make zoom in and zoom out of the view. 
But it is too quick.  I can't control the speed of the process. I would 
like to have a script that shows this zoom in and out slowly just like 
what we see on the television. Do you know how to do it?
By the way I got these scripts by using the "Python shell" trace to 
record what I did by mouse click and so...

Thanks a lot!

Hey David,

No, programmable filter and maybe Python calculator (I haven't really played much with that one yet) are the only ones I can think of. Sometimes I have to modify the reader to get the data in in the correct format, so that's always a non-trivial option.

Good luck,
-Eric

Try using time.sleep (from Python module "time") to slow things down

A1> There are round about ways of doing that, but I'd not recommend
doing it. Sending data from client-to-server isn't the best strategy,
the question you should ask in such cases is "why can't I read the
data on  the server itself"?

A2> This sounds a better approach. There was a separate thread a while
ago that talked about how to popup a input widget from a python macro,
you might want to search for that. You wouldn't be setting attributes
on the python programmable filter, in this case, you'll indeed simply
change the python script used by the filter with the attributes
replaced using the user chosen values.

Michael,

Looks like your vtk file doesn't define any cell, just points. That's
the problem. Several filters iterate over points in cells and when
cells are missing may totally skip points (which why you see no
rendering when you load the vtk file). You need to define a vertices
cell for your polydata in the vtk file. Save out the
csv->table-to-points data as a ASCII vtk file to see how to define the
cells.

Utkarsh, 

sorry to contradict you, but actually the cells are irrelevant here. If you throw in a MaskPoints filter, with the create vertices option on, set mask to 1, and one point per cell, you see the points animate.
When you stick in a pathline filter, as Michael pointed out, the option to display the original point vars is gone. They get lost. I experimented by adding a calculator filter which did nothing except create a new point array and hey-presto - the point vars re-appear.

I didn't look into the pathline code, but it's just possible, that when there is only one scalar array, a bug manifests itself and you can't interpolate arrays. when there is >1 array, it works.

Probably when I implemented it originally, I assumed that one array was Ids and somehow mucked it up.

For a quick fix, throw a calculator filter in which just copied the TPART array with a new name to generate 2 arrays, then try again.

sorry also beacuse I had a look at this over the weekend and forgot completely to post my findings.

JB

Michael,

Looks like your vtk file doesn't define any cell, just points. That's
the problem. Several filters iterate over points in cells and when
cells are missing may totally skip points (which why you see no
rendering when you load the vtk file). You need to define a vertices
cell for your polydata in the vtk file. Save out the
csv->table-to-points data as a ASCII vtk file to see how to define the
cells.

First of all, thanks for your replies...

The quick fix with the calculator filter works. I get my original scalar and the newly created copy of it...

I just tried to append another scalar in the vtk files (appended). With that I may actually choose the second scalar as a variable for the pathlines, but the first scalar is still missing...

Within paraview I also wrote the csv/TableToPoints output into a ASCII vtk series. But after loading the new series (appended) into paraview, and applying the pathlines filter paraview crashes as soon as I skip to the 2nd time step...

Message-ID: <AANLkTim0HSRf9=cs71jyyRFaA56PDnD9YQmSjzspyU8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

What is the current status of Paraview's ability to read in Tecplot data?
I've had mixed success reading in ASCII (usually *.DAT) files.  For example,
many of the DAT files listed here
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/tec/tec.html<http://people.sc.fsu.edu/%7Ejburkardt/data/tec/tec.html>cannot
be read in to Paraview (3.8.0 64-bit, running on Ubuntu 10.10).

I'm pondering whether its worth writing a script to convert my DAT files to
VTU instead...

cheers,
Novak.

Hi there

I run a job in a 16-processor computer. I get the results. I can see the
animation in paraview. But I am interested to make a video out of that. So
whenever I want to watch it, It should not be necessary to launch paraview.
I really appreciate if you can help me with this regard.

Thank you for your time.

please have a look at the following tutorial I  think that might be helpful!
at the end of the page it explains how to export the animation to AVI file!

Using a file series reader, a sequence of images (mhd for example) can
be imported into a time series. When I step through the time steps, on
each image I often want to "Rescale to Data Range" on the color
property of the object (in the Display tab). Is there a way to do this
automatically every time step?

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=wHeY9MoZyegSrCugTZOyVEa=gcViqCzr+D-6C@mail.gmail.com>

I want to make one color of an image (a traditional 2D image) totally
transparent and leave the rest in tact. I have some mask files (white
and green pixels) and I want only the green pixels to be displayed in
ParaView. The white pixels should be transparent so I can see the
original image in that region (when I also have it opened in
ParaView).

I can do it in VTK using vtkImageMapToColors with a vtkLookupTable
(http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Images/Transparency) but is
it possible in ParaView?

Thanks,

David

Hello Novak,

I am currently working on increasing the support of Tecplot files inside of
ParaView for the 3.10 release. The updated reader will have support for more
of the different Tecplot data formats.

Subject: [Paraview] Building a ParaView plugin
Message-ID: <AANLkTins-OaL3VF3tNEOXJAGPvvbXfiaujDqQfAsh3BZ@mail.gmail.com>

I downloaded a new vtk class (vtkAddTetraLayer) from
http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~blloyd/Extrusion/. I compiled the
vtkAddTetraLayer.cxx to a shared library. I can then load the plugin using
the Server Manager XML file, but when I try to use it I get:

ERROR: In
/home/haiduced/Downloads/ParaView-3.8.1/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1065
vtkProcessModule (0x861b60): Cannot create object of type
"vtkAddTetraLayer".
while processing
Message 0 = New
  Argument 0 = string_value {vtkAddTetraLayer}
  Argument 1 = id_value {1068}



ERROR: In
/home/haiduced/Downloads/ParaView-3.8.1/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1066
vtkProcessModule (0x861b60): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.

So ParaView doesn't know about this vtk class. Is there a way to tell
ParaView that the class is defined in the shared library
vtkAddTetraLayer.so? Is there a way to access this new class from ParaView
without recompiling VTK and ParaView from scratch?

David,
  I'm pretty sure I got TIFF files to display with transparency a while back. The files were RGBA, ie included an alpha channel and I had masked out a background. Can you pre-process your images and add an alpha channel with 0 where you want transparency? You should be able to find or make a test image pretty fast to see if it works.

  regards, Dave

You need to compile a plugin and load that, simply loading the XML
wouldn't do. Look at the example in
${ParaViewSource}/Examples/Plugins/Filter to see how to write the
CMakeLists.txt to build such a plugin.

Refer to the Wiki for additional details:

Dave P,

That did the trick. I used the itkRGBAPixel type for my image then
wrote it as a TIFF and the transparency is as expected in ParaView.

Not currently. There's a mechanism to "grow" the range to fit the
current range if required from Edit |Settings dialog. I believe
there's a feature request for the same on the bug tracker.

In general, this is not a great solution.  Clean to Grid converts to unstructured grid, and that provides a heck of a lot of overhead.

A better solution would be to convert to a curvilinear grid.  An even better solution would be if the transform filter were smart enough to transform images.  Unfortunately, neither of these are implemented in ParaView, although either would be really easy to do.  I submitted a suggestion to ParaView UserVoice, so go vote for it if you want to transform images:

Thanks for the tip, Utkarsh.

Now I'm having some difficulty with CMake (I've not used CMake enough to get
comfortable with it yet).

My CMakeLists.txt is:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
 FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
 INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(AddTetraLayer "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML vtkAddTetraLayer_SM.xml
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkAddTetraLayer.cxx
  GUI_RESOURCE_FILES vtkAddTetraLayer_GUI.xml)


When I do a "generate" in ccmake, I get this:

 CMake Warning at
/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.8/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake:986 (ADD_LIBRARY):
   Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target AddTetraLayer
because
   files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
   directories:

     runtime library [libQtCore.so.4] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files
in:
       /usr/local/lib/paraview-3.8

   Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   CMakeLists.txt:9 (ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN)


I am then able to build in spite of the error, but the output looks like:

[  9%] Generating qrc_AddTetraLayer.cxx
[ 18%] Generating vtkSMXML_AddTetraLayer.h
/usr/local/bin/kwProcessXML: error while loading shared libraries:

make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/AddTetraLayer.dir/all] Error 2

Can anyone tell me how to fix these errors?

You have my vote(s). Would you plan to use the vtkImageReslice filter?
If you have any thoughts/implementations, I'd be happy to be a second
pair of eyes.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView environment for Python
Message-ID: <20101109031125.M5663@accutrol.com>

I have a Python script that works inside of ParaView.  I would
like to execute the script from IDLE.  I am using Python 3.1.2
on Windows.  The documentation I have seen indicates setting
an environment path for PYTHONPATH.  The examples are for Unix.  
According to another piece of ParaView documentation, I could
use pvPython or pvBatch.  

I tried to load simple.py and servermanager.py into IDLE.  There
were multiple syntax errors, which led me to consider that they
are out of date and therefore no longer to be used.

How does one interface with the ParaView engine (servermanager)
from outside of ParaView?  Is it similar for Windows and for
Unix?  

Thanks for your help,
Hamilton Woods

Subject: [Paraview] Importing time-varying data into Paraview
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=_bpAnPx4XXLYD7po83XtFM1xHWaNae+_kiHJf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working for a fluid mechanics laboratory, and we have very large amounts
of data that we want to interrogate in Paraview.  We're moving away from
text and custom binary data formats, to use the more portable VTK and NetCDF
data formats.  NetCDF and VTK seem very fast and easy to imolement in our in
house code.  Paraview is also a very efficient tool for us to visualise
large data sets and create complex, 3D isosurfaces etc.  It's in some
respects better than the expensive commercial alternatives.  I'm new to
Paraview, NetCDF and VTK, but have been using Linux & Open Source for a long
time.

There is one major snag that we have, which is the importing of
time-dependent data.   Paraview's feature set and documentation seems to
indicate that handling time-dependent data is a large part of what the
application should be capable of doing, so I'm not sure why we can't get it
to work.

We have very large scalar and vector fields which are typically a function
of 3D space and time, for example we might wish to plot a vector field
u~(x,y,z,time).  Whilst the importing of a single time instance u~(x,y,z)
works perfectly via both NetCDF, we can't seem to import 4D time dependent
data and animate it.  Paraview appears to have some very nice animation and
time based functions, but we can't use them at all because we can't get any
of our data imported as a function of time.

I've tried a number of different ways of doing it, and in every instance
Paraview fails to identify the "time" axis as being distinct from x, y & z.
  I will list them here, along with the error messages and the incoming data
format.  I won't attach our actual .nc data files, as they're gigabytes in
size!  But I will provide the ncdump header info at the bottom of the
message.  They are very simple; one scalar value over a regular,
structured, rectilinear grid with a regular time-step size.  We don't need
to compute any time-derivatives, but simply wish to animate iso-surfaces
computed at each time step discretely.  We have Paraview v.3.6.1 running on
Linux and Mac OS X.

Our failed attempts at loading time varying data are as follows:

1.  Importing a single large NetCDF file which has the data stored as a 4-D
array (x,y,z,time).  In this case each dimension is stored as a NetCDF
"double" type with the appropriate units.

Opening the .nc file results in the error "more than 3 dims without time not
supported".
The "information" tab after clearing away that error shows Extents X =
#timesteps in netcdf,  extents Y = #sizeX in netcdf, extents Z = #sizeY in
netcdf.  The "Time" list at the bottom of the object inspector is empty.  So
it appears that Paraview is treating "time" as a spatial co-ordinate and
then failing to be able to have 4 spatial co-ordinates (which makes perfect
sense).  I've tried naming the "time" axis several different ways and
changing its units, but to no avail.

2.  Importing a sequence of separate NetCDF files which are in 3D (x,y,z)
and are numbered according to their position in time.  ie  data-0.00.nc,
data-0.01.nc , data-0.02.nc etc.   In this case each spatial dimension is
stored as a "double" type with the appropriate units , and the time value is
only recorded in the filename.

In this case, the Paraview "open" dialog does detect a "set" of files
"data-*.nc".  So it recognises that they are a related series.  When I open
"data-*.nc", I only see the data for the first time step.  The "Information"
tab shows "properties: filename: data-0.00.nc", and the "Time" list at the
bottom of the object inspector is empty.  Apparently only the first file has
loaded.  The time animation features don't do anything.  I can't find a way
to move forward in the set data-*.nc.

3.  Importing time slices as NetCDF files individually into Paraview and
attempting to place each slice at its appropriate position in time (tedious,
but it should work, right?)

I can't seem to find any feature which will allow me to assign a data set to
a particular place in time.  Creating a time source does not allow me to
link a dataset to a point in time;  all visible datasets are overlapping
each other at all points in time.

In summary:
Is importing time dependent data via NetCDF currently possible in Paraview ?
 Do we need to convert to an alternative file format, or name or mark the
time axis in some special way so that Paraview recognises it?  I can't see
why the importing process can't allow one to choose any axis they like as
the time axis; certainly this feature is built into all commercial data
visualisation packages.  Even if a restructuring of the data was required to
do this, surely this could be easily implemented.

I'm guessing you're missing LD_LIBRARY_PATH or PATH

pvpython and pvbatch should have all of the proper environment variables set
up for you.

Dear All,
I'd like to export a 3D scene from paraview into interactive 3D PDF
format which is readable by Adobe Reader or can be used in latex
documents. Has anyone already tried to do that?

I found this old message in email-list,

" Normalize Paraview data from 0 to 1 with the calculator.
Save the normalized data in *.vtm format.
Open a new Paraview windows with the the normalized data.
Save the scene with the VRML format (*.wrl).
Use VRML2PDF3D Application to convert the VRML format to a 3D PDF."

However I couldn't find the VRML2PDF3D application.

Does anyone knows how to make 3D PDF's in paraview?

Best,
Nima

Daniel,

The (default) ParaView netCDF reader supports the COARDS convention (http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html).  ParaView will pick up the time dimension in a 4D array if you follow that convention.

The first thing you have to do is to change the order of the axes.  In the COARDS convention, you list the axes backwards.  NetCDF has Fortran-style indexing, so the rightmost index is the value that changes the most.  The way you have your axes set up (x,y,z,time), which means that for each x,y,z position there is a continuous array of all values over time.  Since you usually read or write a block of values at a single time step, this causes a widely interleaved access and subsequently horrible I/O performance.  Order your axis (time,z,y,x).

The second thing you have to do is declare the time axis as time.  In the COARDS convention time is identified by the units attribute on the time variable.  The ParaView reader looks for a string of the form "<time length> since <date>" or "<time length> until <date>".  (Actually, the reader just looks for the substring "since" or "until".  If you change your units from "seconds" to "seconds since 2010-11-9 00:00:00 +0:00", that would be sufficient.

I've never looked at the vtkImageReslice filter before, but it's not quite what I had in mind.  It looks like the vtkImageReslice filter is rotating the data and then resampling on another axis-aligned regular grid.  That certainly has its uses, but in the case of using the ParaView transform filter, the expected behavior is to warp the topology in space.

I gave an example of a filter that could do translations of scaling of vtkImageData by adjusting the origin and spacing, respectively, for building a simple plugin in the IEEE Vis09 tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/1/11/PV_Vis09_Tut_Plugins_Examples.tar.gz).  Something similar could be done for the x,y,z arrays in a vtkRectilinearGrid.

That said, a more practical implementation is probably to convert the vtkImageData or vtkRectilinearGrid to a vtkStructuredGrid and feed that to the transform filter.  That would be the only way to warp the grid by arbitrary rotations.

You have my vote(s). Would you plan to use the vtkImageReslice filter?
If you have any thoughts/implementations, I'd be happy to be a second

I've had no issues reading ASCII TECPLOT files into Paraview. We modified 
our CFD code to generate ASCII TECPLOT files for post-processing in 
Paraview because we were having issues reading binary PLOT3D files with 
Paraview. The ASCII files are very large and slow to read though. Also we 
don't yet have a good solution for generating derived variables from the 
raw data - we're using a Python script to generate a series of Calculator 
filters. 

I suggest reviewing the TECPLOT Data Format Guide (
ftp://ftp.tecplot.com/pub/doc/tecplot/360/dataformat.pdf) for details on 
the ASCII file format. 

Our files look like this:
TITLE="TECPLOT Wall Output"
VARIABLES= "x" "y" "z" "density" "heat-flux" "wall-temp-out-surf" 
"absolute-pressure" "x-wall-shear" "y-wall-shear" "z-wall-shear" "y-plus"

Each "surface" is indicated by a ZONE header with the zone title, i/j/k

Hi everyone,

What is the current status of Paraview's ability to read in Tecplot data?  
I've had mixed success reading in ASCII (usually *.DAT) files.  For 
example, many of the DAT files listed here 
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/tec/tec.html cannot be read in to 
Paraview (3.8.0 64-bit, running on Ubuntu 10.10).

I'm pondering whether its worth writing a script to convert my DAT files 
to VTU instead...

cheers,
Novak._______________________________________________

Is there anyone who's familiar with CMake and can explain to me why the
generated makefiles can't find my vtk libraries?

Subject: [Paraview] How do I install a python macro?
Message-ID: <E1PFvna-0007zz-GK@cosmos.phy.tufts.edu>

I am a new ParaView user.  I'm using 3.8.0.  I understand there's a
facility for writing macros in python and putting them in a toolbar.
I can type the code I want the macro to execute into the python shell,
but I don't understand how to get it established as a macro.  I can't
seem to find any documentation.  In
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools#Macros it says

   Macros allow the user to define a Python script as built-in actions
   that become accessible from the Macros menu or directly inside the
   Toolbar.

   Once a local file is defined as a Macro...

This is what I want, and indeed I see the "Macros" menu and the
toolbar, both empty.  So how do I perform this operation of defining a
local file as a macro?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Reader Plugin Dev: "NA" extents & how to print debug
	messages?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikjNt9VZi0i3kwqqea7i5ON0hq6LgVsAyro1B9h@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ParaViewers,

(Sorry if this double-posts!)

I am writing a ParaView Reader Plugin to get my data into ParaView via a
vtkStructuredGrid object.  I can load my plugin into ParaView via "Manage
Plugins".  My file type shows up in the "File-> Open" dialog.  When
PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG is set, the "Output Messages" window shows that the library
was loaded successfully.

When I select a file and click "Apply" in the object inspector, Paraview
thinks for a split second before returning to an interactive state.
 However, no data appears & the "Information" tab of the object inspector
sets nCells = 0; nPoints = 0; Memory = 0 MB and the X,Y,Z extents are "NA".

My plugin reader derives from "vtkStructuredGridReader" and implements:

* SetFileName
* GetFileName
* CanReadFile
* RequestInformation, where I set the extents via:
  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),extent,6);
* RequestData, where I obtain a vtkStructuredGrid via:
  vtkStructuredGrid *output =

 vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

I am not sure why the "Information" tab is showing an empty structured grid.
 My questions are:

1.  How can I print debugging messages to stdout or Paraview's own "Output
Messages" window?  Specifically, I'd like to make sure that my X,Y,Z extents
are being read properly from file.   I tried vtkDebugMacro, but the data
isn't being printed.

2.  Have I implemented the appropriate functions that derive from
vtkStructuredGridReader?

3.  Should I derive instead from another class?  When I derive from
vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm, I get three error messages from
vtkCompositeDataPipeline:  "Input port 0 of algorithm
vtkLFMReader(0x11f98a720) has 0 connections but is not optional".

Can you offer any hints of how I can proceed to debug my reader?

Thanks!
Pete

Subject: [Paraview] Combining vector components
Message-ID: <4CD9CC82.7000907@gmail.com>

Hi,

     From an existing simulation, a set of vectors were written out (as 
binary float in a brick i.e. width x height x depth) as individual axes 
components e.g. U01.bin, V01.bin, W01.bin, for a given time step.

     What is the recommended way to combine the data in Paraview so that 
one can view them as 3 component vector?

     I have already been visualizing the scalar components like 
temperature and pressure from the same simulation.

Regards

Hi John,

You might be able to get past the "error while loading shared libraries:
libvtkCommon.so.pv3.8" problem by prepending to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  In
bash:

export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=..../path/containing/libvtkCommon.so.pv3.8:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Cheers,
Pete

The easiest way is to use the Calculator. You can use an expression of
the following form to generate a vector from 3 scalars:

scalar0 * iHat  + scalar1 * jHat + scalar2 * kHat

Hi Peter,

To use the vtkDebugMacro, do a "this->DebugOn()" in your constructor.

You could just use cerr if you are Linux/mac and launch 
paraview/pvserver from a terminal.  Doing a "output->Print(cerr);" at 
the end of request data would prove that you did what you think.

You could use vtkErrorMacro to get stuff into PV 's window.

Hi Ken,

We recently changed the Macro menu and the way that macro are managed.
The wiki explain the new way.

For your case on ParaView 3.8.0, you need to go to Tools -> Python
Shell, and on the right side select a python file from your disk and
click on the Add Macro button.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Reading ASCII Tecplot data


I've had no issues reading ASCII TECPLOT files into Paraview. We modified
our CFD code to generate ASCII TECPLOT files for post-processing in Paraview
because we were having issues reading binary PLOT3D files with Paraview. The
ASCII files are very large and slow to read though. Also we don't yet have a
good solution for generating derived variables from the raw data - we're
using a Python script to generate a series of Calculator filters. 

I suggest reviewing the TECPLOT Data Format Guide (
<ftp://ftp.tecplot.com/pub/doc/tecplot/360/dataformat.pdf>
ftp://ftp.tecplot.com/pub/doc/tecplot/360/dataformat.pdf) for details on the
ASCII file format. 

Our files look like this: 
TITLE="TECPLOT Wall Output" 
VARIABLES= "x" "y" "z" "density" "heat-flux" "wall-temp-out-surf"
"absolute-pressure" "x-wall-shear" "y-wall-shear" "z-wall-shear" "y-plus" 
ZONE T="airfoil", i=362, j=69, k=1, DATAPACKING=BLOCK 
  2.42144130E-02  2.40880810E-02  2.39595771E-02  2.38230173E-02
2.36812476E-02  2.35372968E-02  2.33908389E-02  2.32443120E-02
2.30974443E-02  2.29516029E-02  2.28067115E-02  2.26650704E-02
2.25249752E-02  2.23834831E-02 ... 

Each "surface" is indicated by a ZONE header with the zone title, i/j/k
counts, and DATAPACKING flag.

Hi everyone,

What is the current status of Paraview's ability to read in Tecplot data?
I've had mixed success reading in ASCII (usually *.DAT) files.  For example,
many of the DAT files listed here
<http://people.sc.fsu.edu/%7Ejburkardt/data/tec/tec.html>
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/tec/tec.html cannot be read in to
Paraview (3.8.0 64-bit, running on Ubuntu 10.10).

I'm pondering whether its worth writing a script to convert my DAT files to
VTU instead...

cheers,
Novak._______________________________________________

Message-ID: <1632E2AA-40DD-47DC-B33B-05DBD49FDE8F@indiana.edu>

Hello ParaViewers,

Is it possible to interactively plot horizontal points (actual scalar values, no interpolation) from a 2-D ImageData and show the associated line across the imagedata?  I had sort of asked this earlier and pointed to this page as reference:  http://mypage.iu.edu/~heiland/pv-stuff/

thanks, Randy

Apply "Extract Subset" to extract a 1D section and then try using the
"Plot Data" filter. That will allow you to plot the raw attribute
data.

The error message you get after the ExtractVOI is because ParaView is
trying to show the data in the 2D, you can ignore that. Simply hide
the "ExtractVOI" in the 2D view and apply Plot Data.

Utkarsh,  Thanks for the prompt reply!  That does indeed work - as far as plotting the values.  But what about showing the associated horiz line across the imagedata?  And what about being able to interactively/dynamically translate that line up/down?  Are there options other than changing the Y range of the VOI for the ExtractSubset filter?  Is it possible to at least lockstep the Y's min/max?

You will have to manually change the Y range. Alternatively, write
your own filter that provides a simple slider-like  interface for
changing Y and internally you can use the ExtractVOI filter to achieve
the same effect.

Subject: [Paraview] Linker error involving ParaView's vtk and mvapich
Message-ID: <164492FD-8746-420B-805F-6ABAC3F2614A@math.hu-berlin.de>

Dear ParaView community!

I'm having a problem building ParaView on a linux x86-64 cluster. I intend to use pvserver (parallelized via mvapich2) to visualize results  from finite element compuations. There is no graphics hardware available on the machine, so I'm using osmesa.
Configuration works as described in the wiki but running make gives this:

# make

... output truncated ... (nothing interesting here)

To me, this looks like mvapich2 and vtk both use parsers generated by flex+bison where at least one of them should rename their yyin etc. Unfortunately, Google was unable to offer any useful help, so I'm turning to you.

Any ideas on how I could fix this (or work around it)?

Cheers,
Leonard Kern.

P.S. My CMakeCache.txt is appended.

Dear All,

For some reason, I am getting error messages running a python batch script
when I try to execute WriteImage on an XYPlotView. I have tried various
combinations but I get the same error message each time:

The combinations I have tried are:

WriteImage("test.png",XYPlotView,Writer=vtkPNGWriter,Magnification=2)

and I get the same error each time. I get the same error when running the
script interactively, but I can then proceed to save a screenshot without a
problem. Am I missing something or is this a bug? I am using
ParaView-3.6.2-RC2.

I wouldn't be surprised if 3.6 didn't support writing images from
chart views. The chart view were revamped for 3.8 and included several
fixed including Python improvements.

ParaView cannot save screenshots as EPS. However you can save them as
pdf/png etc and use tools like ImageMagick to convert the image to
eps.

Hi,

That is correct. As a matter of fact I was wondering if there is anyway to
compile ( paraview with any external package ) to get vector graphic
outputs?

Thanks

Hi all,

I have uploaded the files BestPatch_0000.mhd and BestPatch_0001.mhd
and a "reference point image", BlankedCorrelation.mhd so you can see
what I'm talking about more easily with the following steps.  They are
available here:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/MetaSeriesReader/

Steps to reproduce:
// Broken
1) Open the BlankedCorrelation image in Paraview.
2) Open the BestPatch_* images as a series.
3) Click "Next frame"
4) Observe that the second patch is in the same position as the first
(this is incorrect, they are supposed to be in different positions)

// Works properly
5) Delete the BestPatch_* from the pipeline
6) Open BestPatch_0000 and BestPatch_0001 separately.
7) Observe that they are in different positions (as they are supposed to be).

Any thoughts as to the cause of this?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to use "Append attributes" filter after using
 "Resample with dataset" filter
Message-ID: <4CDE59C1.7010607@gmail.com>

Hi Paraviewers,

I would like to do a mesh refinement analysis using the predefined 
filters of paraview (I can already do such an analysis with numpy and 
pylab).
My objective is to calculate the difference between the pressure fields 
of a fine grid simulation and a coarse grid simulation.

I have two OpenFoam simulations: A fine grid simulation and a coarse 
grid simulation.
I have imported the results of both simulations into paraview.
Then I have resampled the fine grid solution as follows:
Select fine grid source >Resample with dataset > Source>Coarse grid
Then I apply a calculator on the resampled solution and basically rename 
the point pressure variable to 'presampled'
I also apply a calculator on the coarse solution and rename the point 
pressure variable to 'pcoarse'

The next step should be:
Select both calculators and apply the 'Append attributes' filter.
However, this filter is not selectable at this stage (grayed out)
I can confirm that both calculators have the same number of points and 
cells.

Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong or whether there is a better 
way of performing a grid sensitivity study in paraview?

Thank you,
George

Hi,

Does anyone know if it's possible to colour a surface with two (or more)
different data sets?  e.g. In "Object Inspector->Display->Color by" you can
choose only one data set.

I need to colour with one data set as an "underlay" and then second data set
over the top.

It doesn't seem like this is in Paraview, are there any work arounds or
alternatives?

Thanks,

Just to clarify, are you trying to color the same mesh with different
arrays or different meshes with different arrays? Is the former,
there's no way of doing it. If the latter, then the Object Inspector
allows one to change the color for the "active" mesh. You change
what's active by choose a different mesh in the pipeline browser.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with plugin reader and GUI selection
Message-ID: <570731.15015.qm@web26101.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have a file format that contains arrays of scalars data (each array has a 
name) . What I would like to do is to choose the array I have selected and load 
it in paraview.
ex: 
array 0 -> name = temp_0  1.2 3.5 7.8 ....
array 1 -> name = temp_1  8.7 5.9 2.3 ....
array 2 -> name = temp_2  72 10.5 87.8 ....

So, I have wrote  a plugin reader and in the xml file I have add for some tests  
(from 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_Categories_to_the_Filters_Menu):
<IntVectorProperty
                            name="temperature"
                            command="SetTemperature"
                            number_of_elements="1"
                            default_values="0">
            <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
              <Entry value="0" text="temp_0"/>
              <Entry value="1" text="temp_1"/>
              <Entry value="2" text="temp_2"/>
            </EnumerationDomain>
</IntVectorProperty>

When I use the plugin, I have a drop down list. But What I want is start from an 
empty drop down list and add the name and index of the array at the end of the 
requestInformation (Because files don't have the same number of arrays and 
differents names).

But, I can find anything about how to do that (internet and The ParaView Guide 
book and VTK User's Guide book).

How can I do that ?

Thank you for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] documentation
Message-ID: <E1PI58A-00012C-Ny@cosmos.phy.tufts.edu>

Thanks for the quick answer to my question about installing macros.

I'm writing now because I'm very unhappy about the state of the
documentation.  Let me say that paraview is a great program and it
enables me to make beautiful visualizations.  So I am reluctant to
criticize the developers, but it really is remarkably difficult to
learn to use.  It's bad enough that I'm seriously considering
abandoning paraview and using something else.

I hope that you would like to have a product that new users can learn
to use without too much frustration, so let me go through my recent
experiences to show why I'm so frustrated.

I would like to display stereoscopic images.  So I looked in the
Paraview Guide for any mention of stereoscopic display.  It isn't
there.  I tried the online help, but there is no index, so I can't
search for it.  I tried various help topics, but didn't find anything
relevant.

So I went to the net.  I couldn't find any documentation for stereo,
but at least there is some archived discussion, so I learned that
there is a "--stereo" command line switch.  So far so good, but how
can I control how it renders the stereo?  I got a list of commandline
options, and there is a set of modes.  But what are they?  What do the
options mean?  I have access to a "visualization wall" which sends
side-by-side display of the stereo frames to overlapping
super-anaglyph projectors.  Can I use it?  How?

And what about turning it on or off dynamically?  There doesn't seem
to be any control of it once paraview is running.  But I managed to
learn, again by looking through the archived messages to this list,
that the stereo selection is an option of the viewer, and I was able
to turn it on and off using the python shell.  Excellent!

So then I thought, "Can I make this into something I can click on?"  I
see that there is a "Macros" tab, and a macro is just what I want.
Back to the online help.  No mention of macros.  Back to the book.  No
mention of macros there either.  I didn't mind paying $80 for this
book, since the software is free, but at least I thought for $80 it
would answer my questions.

OK.  Back to the net.  Aha.  There is a Wiki page on "Python GUI
Tools".  The first topic is Macros.  What does it say?  "The
management of macros is done inside the Macros menu".  Click on
"Macros".  The only item is "<empty>".  Oops.

What does it say next?  "Macros allow the user to define a Python
script as built-in actions that become accessible from the Macros menu
or directly inside the Toolbar."  Just what I want!  Great!  But how
do I do it?  "Once a local file is defined as a Macro the given file
is copied inside the user specific ParaView directory."  OK, but HOW
do I define a local file as a Macro?  Nothing further is mentioned in
this file.

So I posted to this list, and right away I got an answer.  Thanks!
That's great, but should I really just post my question here first?
It seems I ought to try to answer my questions before bothering
everyone, but I'm not having much success.

In any case, while the answer (from Sebastien Jourdain) answered my
question perfectly, he also said "We recently changed the Macro menu
and the way that macros are managed.  The wiki explains the new way."
Does it?  All I could see was what I quoted above, which does not
include any mention of how to define a macro.  Maybe if I actually had
the new version it would be obvious, but I certainly couldn't figure
it out from this file.

Anyway, shouldn't the documentation correspond to the latest version
that one can download from the download site?  Or, at least, shouldn't
it say that it corresponds to a later version and make it easy for me
to find the documentation corresponding to the version I have?

Again, I'm sorry to be so critical (and so verbose), but I beg you to
consider the plight of new users and make things not so frustrating.

Ken,

We totally understand your frustration. For this very reason, we have
started working on an online version of a user's guide for ParaView
which will be freely available. With every release of ParaView we will
package a pdf file which will serve as the manual for that release.

You can look at the current state of this document at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents. It's
still under development, but we plan to have most of the sections
filled in by ParaView 3.10 release.

You may want to consider using multiple views and then link them.  Linking
will allow you to manipulate the view identically in each 3d view while
maintaining separate representations in each.

Utkarsh,

Is it the case that if you color by a vector array comprising unsigned char, ParaView can color the surface directly using those colors (turn of Map Scalars)?  If that's the case, Tristan can create a filter (perhaps by using the Python Programmable Filter)) to create such an array.

Thanks Andy, I'll look into this.

Ken, I think I already tried something similar.  I wrote a program to
"merge" two scalar data sets as colours (3 vector) according to a colour
scheme, then turned off "map scalars".  Is that what you mean?  This works
ok but I think it means I can't use any of the colouring and visualization
options in Paraview to manipulate the appearance (e.g. change the colour
lookup scheme, set logarithmic scale etc).  I have to rerun my program to
change any parameters.

Thanks,
Tristan

Message-ID: <AANLkTinEp2xtrFo-oZ+mvU4NMZy8SjOOY7ddXXUS4k-T@mail.gmail.com>

I have a series of Plot3D files, each corresponding to a different time step
of a time-dependent simulation. I want to animate this data, but I can't
figure out how to make get ParaView to load a new q file when the time
changes. When I couldn't do it from the GUI, I tried setting the q file from
a Python script. Even then, pvbatch seems to ignore changes to the q file
name after the first frame has been rendered. I'm setting it using:

grid_p3d.QFileName='/path/to/qfile.p3d'

Can anyone tell me what I need to do to load the other Plot3D q files?

Subject: [Paraview] a quick question about color map
Message-ID: <AANLkTimGgs1ZviqH9s1ba1dmKmoAwa8z_549HvR0WtNK@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys.

I'm using paraview to generate a display the results of my lipids
simulation.

Each runtime I print to file exactly 3008 points which are divided into 4
types:

   1. 8 stationary particles. I used to set the size of the display as
   constant (marking the corners positions). They get a value of 100
   2. 1000 Hydrophilic particles. It doesn't matter what are those, it is
   only important to know that they get a value of 1
   3. 1000 Hydrophobic particles which get the value of 2.
   4. 1000 Hydrophobic particles which are different that those in the
   previous line but should appear similar on the output. They get a value of
   3.


What I want is to create is an image with 2 colors for each of the 3000
particles. The image should have red color for particle number 1 and any
other color for particles number 2 and 3. I also want to remove the 8
stationary particles of value 100 which I think I can do by creating another
file.

I tried to create a costume color map:

<ColorMap name="a" space="RGB">
<Point x="100" o="1" r="0" g="0" b="0"/>
<Point x="1" o="1" r="1,0" g="0" b="0"/>
<Point x="2" o="1" r="0" g="1.0" b="0"/>
<Point x="3" o="1" r="0" g="1.0" b="0"/>
</ColorMap>

but I get a gradient between red and black.

What have I missed?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] visualization of neural network activity
Message-ID: <AANLkTimZAZ2EQvMhTVwe13WAwtrsYBPtPMCRUJZMJej4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
 my question is about suitability of ParaView for visualization of neural
network models. I saw the gallery, looked at the supported file formats,
available tools and filters, and looked over the user guide (1.7). My
impression is that ParaView is typically used for visualization of data that
is layed out in a grid, say 3D matrices, especially particles, however I
noticed there is the possibility to interactively create 3D objects and
output them to povray and I I saw that ITK R4 at one point had support for
neural network visualization (http://www.paraview
.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4/Discussion_Points#Neural_Networks).
 Our aim is to visualize a network model consisting of neurons and
connections between neurons and show time dynamics of evolving attractors,
etc. The visualization should basically colorcode neurons and synapses,
possibly in 3D and possibly raytraced. We run our simulations in parallel
and would like to use a binary format like hdf5 or netcdf to store data of
neural activations and connection strengths. These should then be used to
create a 3D representations (images and videos). I think Povray (+ pevious
binary2text conversion) could be simply setup to do network visualization
for our purpose. Can this visualization be done in ParaView? (If yes, how?)
thanks,
Benjamin.

Hi,

I loaded a 3D matrix and am displaying slices of it, however it seems
that the near and far clipping planes are sometimes incorrect, and cut
parts of the plane off. I uploaded a video of this.

sorry it is in a retarded format).

How on earth can I change the clip planes? I've looked everywhere!

Cheers,

Hey Yotam,

Personally, I would first do a Threshold filter to remove the points with value 100 rather than try to adapt the color map to these "unwanted" points or make another data file. Then, just remove the 100 value color from your map and it might be more obvious that it's working.

I'm not sure why it doesn't work the way you have it now, though. When I load this colormap in to ParaView 3.8.1 it looks fine to me. (You're mixing commas and periods for the decimal markers, but it seems to deal with that fine...) If you hit "Edit Color Map" to get to the Color Scale Editor, does the scale (min,max) of your color map range match your data values range? Can you check in the Information tab and make sure your scalar values are getting read in properly?

Hi Chris,

I just fixed the formatting for the python code snippets.  As you noticed there were problems of tabs and spaces intermixed but it's not been converted to all spaces now.  There were also some problems with changes to the library names (import libvtkvtkCoProcessorPython now needs to be import vtkCoProcessorPython).

Andy
----------------

You'all

I am not attending SC10, so don't know what was said during the tutorial. I was a little bit confused by the different wiki pages today. In summary, the code examples I downloaded today from the SC10 page ( http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SC10_Coprocessing_Tutorial ) do not appear to run, due to the aforementioned indentation problems corrected by Andy. The corrections, however, are on a different page http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_example

That said, I was then able to run the demos (from the 2nd wiki page) in parallel. Great work. Thanks.

What version of ParaView are you using? Are you running in parallel
i.e. connected to remote server or not? What's your visualization?
Just a volume data and then showing it as a "Slice" representation or
are you applying the slice filter?

There's no way to change the clip planes explicitly, but ParaView
should be updating it correctly. Since it's not, it's a bug.

Hi Jean,

I'm going to go back and fix the inconsistencies in the SC10 tutorial.  I
just didn't want to mess with it before the tutorial.

Glad things are working for you!

VTK/Titan may have most of the components that you need, but they are not
currently available in ParaView. Titan (titan.sandia.gov) has a generic hdf5
reader that loads data into a vtkTable that may suit your needs. There are
also utilities for converting a vtkTable into a vtkGraph which can then be
visualized in vtkGraphLayoutView, which can do 2D or 3D layout. As far as
animation goes, graph layout on time-changing graphs is a tricky problem
since it's easy to lose your frame-of-reference if you redo layout each
time. But if you want to do the layout once, fix the node positions, then
just animate properties like colors, that is more doable.

The other option is to manually get the data into one of the several
geometry formats ParaView supports, then you could use ParaView directly.
For example, you could produce a legacy vtkPolyData format where you define
neurons as points and connections as lines, then you load it in ParaView and
do things like glyph the points with spheres, color lines by attributes,
etc.

Thanks a lot, Jeff. I will think over, which option to use. Using titan I
could even do visualization at runtime (for analysis of the network) and for
bigger networks I could just store the network state and visualize offline.
Now I have somewhere to start. That helped a lot.

I see. Ah well, the slice filter seems to work, although that has
another issue: The diagrammatic depiction of where the slice goes
isn't scaled like the actual resulting slice is, so the orientation
doesn't match. Also rotating it is really fiddly!

Tim,

This seems to have been fixed in 3.8. You may want to try to download
the binaries from paraview.org. Alternative, apply the "Outline"
filter to your data and leave it visible. That way the clipping bounds
will be computed correctly.

Message-ID: <20101116173810.GA5503@mail.mcgill.ca>

Hello,

This is probably a FAQ, but I could not find a procedure that worked for me.
I have data a CSV file (space-separater rather than comma-separated, but the CSV 
reader reads it properly anyway) that looks like this:

x y z value

It is huge, with about 3 million points.

I've imported it into a table using the CSV reader, and it works well. However,
I'd like to do a volume plot of the data, but neither the "Table to points" 
or "Table to structured grid" filters give me something I can volume render.

Does anybody know a process for obtaining that?

Thank you very much!

Pablo B.

Any clues on this? Has anyone ever seen similar behavior with any of
the other series readers?

Subject: [Paraview] VTU vs. Exodus: "play" through list of files
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=GCNWtSjhtbNJtYShuknBjteqLAftJegC9k6rQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've had a bunch of VTU files (say, state1.vtu, state2.vtu,
state2.vtu,...) and using ParaView, it is very easy to display them in
a movie style, being able to "play", "pause", click through the frames
and so on.
I then recently switched to the Exodus format, the information in the
files remains exactly the same (say, state1.exo, state2.exo,
state2.exo,...). When opening each file individually, one is presented
with a slightly altered menu as opposed to VTU files (--makes
sense--), but it does not seem to be possible to "play" the sequence
of the files. ParaView would always iterate over "time" from 0 to 1 in
in steps of 1/9, instead of iterating over the files.

-- Is that something that cane be fixed, or am I ideally expected to
present the data to ParaView in a different way?

Cheers,
Nico

In exodus format, one generally writes all the steps (state1, state2, ...) in the same file. This relies on the mesh topology being the same for the entire set of steps.

Right; I'll try that later. Moving mesh sequences might also be
represented in one file only I believe.

It's still a bit confusing as to *what ParaView displays when there's
only one state per file.

It is possible to have a sequence of exodus files that each have 1 or 
more states in them; as an example, the Sierra codes will output files 
with names similar to "box.e, box.e-s0002, ..., box.e-s0006" In 
paraview, I can open the file "box.e" and it automatically opens all 
files in the series and shows me the combined state times from each file.

I am just wondering what disanvantages the disabling of the window popup has? 
Since it still is in the current git code I gurss the code that is commended by this fix has some use?


Thansk and Regards

Utkarsh,

I've now been able to test out the new patch and it is working fine. To be
honest, this is all that is required as it removes the annoyance of having
numerous pop-up windows cluttering your desktop anytime you try to run
ParaView in parallel.

Thanks again!

I believe you are talking about the server-side render window that pops up.

I am attaching a experimental patch to get you started. It works only on
Linux. All I am doing it not mapping the window. Now when you run server
with offscreen:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

and connect to it from ParaView client, you should no longer see any
server-side windows when remote rendering.

Of course the patch is more of a hack, but it should give you a starting
point.

You might have luck converting it to a structured grid. There are a
couple of filters that do that. You might need to downsample your grid
using Extract Subset first in order to get renders in a reasonable
time.

Another way would be to convert to vtkStructuredPoints first, although
I don't know a way to do that inside of paraview; I wrote a program in
C++ to do it but the input wasn't a CSV file.

Great! This does work with ParaView >= 3.8.0 and this exact file name format.
Thanks for the hint.

Whoops, I meant unstructured grid in that first paragraph. There's a filter
called "Merge blocks" or something like that which will get you an
unstructured grid. Tetrahedralize will do it too.

Resampling shouldn't be too hard in Python. You can create a
vtkStructuredPoints grid and then resample your dataset onto it using
vtkProbeFilter. Resampling can be very slow (hours for a small unstructured
grid), but volume renders on structured points are orders of magnitude
faster than on unstructured grids.

Tristan,

Yes, that is what I meant, and yes that suggestion is only really viable if you have specific transfer functions you want to apply because you would have no GUI controls to set it.

Thanks Andy, I'll look into this.

Ken, I think I already tried something similar.  I wrote a program to "merge" two scalar data sets as colours (3 vector) according to a colour scheme, then turned off "map scalars".  Is that what you mean?  This works ok but I think it means I can't use any of the colouring and visualization options in Paraview to manipulate the appearance (e.g. change the colour lookup scheme, set logarithmic scale etc).  I have to rerun my program to change any parameters.

Thanks,
Tristan

Utkarsh,

Is it the case that if you color by a vector array comprising unsigned char, ParaView can color the surface directly using those colors (turn of Map Scalars)?  If that's the case, Tristan can create a filter (perhaps by using the Python Programmable Filter)) to create such an array.

Just to clarify, are you trying to color the same mesh with different

there's no way of doing it. If the latter, then the Object Inspector

Subject: [Paraview] VTU vs. Exodus: "play" through list of files
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTikBk_mLvuLzGRfh_j-_hhVZBFa-QEGhVnOPCc6T@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C908C101.8E8F%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Just to complete the thread, a time series of Exodus files is generally called Exodus restarts.  The feature for reading the restarts is documented on the Wiki:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Restarted_Simulation_Readers#Exodus

Note that the .e-s# naming convention is one way to read them in.  Another is creating a .ex-timeseries file.

As Greg mentioned, it is more common for a single Exodus file to store the entire time series.  This is only possible in Exodus, however, if the toplogy does not change.  That is, you have the same number of cells and all the cells have the same neighbors.  The cells can, however, move around.  This is done by displacing the points of the mesh.

Great! This does work with ParaView >= 3.8.0 and this exact file name format.
Thanks for the hint.

Hey Yotam,

(Please reply to the list, also, so everyone can contribute and learn together)

The Table to Points filter creates polydata with many points but one cell. (You can see this in teh Information tab.) The Threshold filter (from the documentation) "...extracts cells that have point or cell scalars in the specified range." So, you need to run another filter before the threshold which breaks your data out into one cell per point. The Triangulate filter happens to do this, so apply that before the Threshold. (Maybe someone else has a solution which is more intuitive, but this works...)

A small point: you should probably remove the trailing comma at the end of your header line -- it's causing ParaView to create an attribute column with undefined values. This wasn't affecting your results, it just isn't necessary if you remove the extra comma.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

(You're mixing commas and periods for the decimal markers, but it seems to deal with that fine...) If you hit "Edit Color Map" to get to the Color Scale Editor, does the scale (min,max) of your color map range match your data values range? Can you check in the Information tab and make sure your scalar values are getting read in properly?

Subject: [Paraview] Normal Glyphs and Cullbackface give different results
Message-ID: <21B5422E-7FDA-481C-B51F-ECFA1C74B86B@bluequartz.net>

I was checking some results on a triangular surface mesh that was  
generated through an external program and I have some conflicting  
results. If I use the "Backface Style" section of the "Display" tab to  
set the Backface Representation to "Cull Backface" I see some of the  
triangles disappear which is to be expected if the surface meshing  
program did not correctly "wind" the triangles. I then applied the  
"Normal Glyph" filter and I would have expected to see some arrows  
pointing at me and some away but they are all in the same direction.  
See attached image.
   My question is this expected? Does the Normal Glyph use the same  
algorithm as the CullbackFace? I'll assume that the CullBackface is  
just an OpenGL setting so ParaView really has no control over that.

  Or maybe I am just really misunderstanding what is going on. Any  
comments or clarifications would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Setting color / transparency for polydata
Message-ID: <4CE3F060.6010304@gmx.ch>

Hi there

For my bachelor thesis, I'm doing a reader in c++ to read in large 
amount of points and display them (from a solar system simulation output 
in a sqlite db), but i fail at setting transparency for certain points. 
Can anybody please point me to a tutorial or give me a hint? I did look 
around and saw i probably need a mapper or actor, with a lookuptable, 
(at least in vtk only it works like this) but i didn't find an example 
how to convert this to paraview. (witch would be great, because i'm 
totally new to pv and vtk).
How and where do i have to attach the mapper to?
I did get the coloring working, but no clue how to continue from here.

Many Thanks

Here's a draft of my code:

int vtkSQLiteReader::RequestData(vtkInformation*,
	vtkInformationVector**,vtkInformationVector* outputVector)
{
	
	vtkPolyData * out = vtkPolyData::GetData(outputVector);

	if (!this->dataIsRead)
		// only read if it's not been read before
	{
		readSnapshots(); //reads in the coordinates and velocities of particles
		readTracks(); //reads in the tracks of the particles

		this->dataIsRead = true;
	}

	out->SetPoints(this->Position);
	out->SetVerts(this->Cells);
	out->SetLines(this->Tracks);
	out->GetPointData()->AddArray(this->Velocity);

	// update the colors in every update
	generateColors();
	out->GetPointData()->SetScalars(this->colors);
	
	return 1;
}


int vtkSQLiteReader::generateColors()
{
	this->colors = vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnsignedCharArray>::New();
	this->colors->SetName("Colors");
	this->colors->SetNumberOfComponents(3);
	this->colors->SetNumberOfTuples(this->nParticles);

	for (int i = 0; i<this->nParticles;i++)
	{
		// heres some code to choose the color per point..
		red = 255;
		green = 255;
		blue = 255;

		this->colors->InsertTuple3(i,
				red,
				green,
				blue);
	}
	return 1;
}

Subject: [Paraview] reading a stack of TIFF images
Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A194FE014D2E2@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

Hi there

this afternoon, I was asked to read a stack of TIFF images in ParaView. Well, I search the archive mailing list, tried different things which led me nowhere, and could not find a solution out of the box.

I then worked on a Python script which now works very well for our purpose. I thought I would post it since the question seems to come up every now and then, and I am not aware of a solution posted on the net. 

I used a ProgrammableSource, with output type set to "vtkImageData"

# I set my whole extend in the RequestInformation panel:

self.GetImageDataOutput().SetWholeExtent(0,511,0,511,0,192)

# and I filled in the Script text panel with:

import vtk
r = vtk.vtkTIFFReader()
r.SetFilePrefix("/local/data/red_Z")
r.SetFilePattern("%s%03d.tif")
r.SetDataExtent(0,511,0,511,0,192)
r.SetDataSpacing(1,1,0.001)
r.Update()
self.GetImageDataOutput().ShallowCopy(r.GetOutput())


Got a nice picture of a neuron after that, so I hope some other people find it useful.

Hi everyone,

   I am new on this mailing list, I wanted to know if it is possible to display bonds between points with Paraview. 
I know about UNSTRUCTURED_GRID, but I want to represent the bond by a cylinder where the color and the radius can change.

This type of representation is used to display the lattice beams and chain force concept in granular simulations.


Can you help me to find more informations about that in Paraview ?

Hey Jean-Fran?ois,

You should be able to do it, but you'll have to have the right elements in your data to work with. (I'll attach a screen shot that I think is the type of thing you're referring to. You can see the pipeline I used to create it, too, where the Curvature filter is just used to generate some scalars for my cone.) 

If you only have the points themselves, then it may be difficult to generate the correct lines between them. If you also have the lines between them as part of the geometry you're loading into ParaView, then you can use the Tube filter to represent those bonds with size and color proportional to the values _at the end points that define the lines_. I haven't used the Tube filter very much, but it looks like e.g. if you have two points which define a polydata line, it ignores "cell data", which would be defined on the line itself connecting the points, but it can use the "point data", which would be an attribute defined on the two points at the ends of the lines... (If you only have scalar attributes defined on the lines, you can always run the data through Cell Data to Point Data filter before creating the tubes.)

So, it may take a little playing around, but it should be quite possible. Just make sure you specify your data in a way that defines the connections between points, as well as the points themselves.

Good luck,
-Eric

   I haven't used the Tube filter very much, but it looks like e.g. if
   you have two points which define a polydata line, it ignores "cell
   data", which would be defined on the line itself connecting the
   points, but it can use the "point data", which would be an
   attribute defined on the two points at the ends of the lines.

Actually, Tube is willing to use cell data also, but I encountered a
problem with that.  I would like to display a tube with each segment a
different color.  If I write a polydata file with a series of points
connected by a single line going through all of them, then Tube
generates a beautiful tube, but it can only make it one color because
there's only one cell.  If I create a sperate polydata line between
every pair of consecutive points, then Tube is happy to color each of
these segments differently according to cell data, but it does not
connect the segments into a single tube, so it has holes and overlaps
at the corners.

If instead I use point data, then the colors change smoothly from one
vertex to another, which is not what I want.

Anyone know a solution?  Thanks.

Jean,

I just tried allowing the TIFF reader to read a series of files. For
some reason it doesn't work though - my test files named 001.tif and
002.tif are not recognized as a series. Here are the relevant files:

http://gitorious.org/paraviewsandbox/paraviewsandbox/blobs/TIFFSeries/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml
http://gitorious.org/paraviewsandbox/paraviewsandbox/blobs/TIFFSeries/Applications/ParaView/ParaViewReaders.xml

Can anyone see where I've gone wrong?

Thanks,

David

Hey Ken,

It looks to me that if you go to the Display tab and both uncheck Interpolate Scalars, and in the Style group box move Interpolation from Gouraud to Flat, you'll get nasty looking tubes, but each segment will be a separate color. (The attached image is a polydata with six points and one cell where the tubes were scaled and colored by the point data.) Of course, you can increase the tube number of sides to get slightly rounder-looking tubes.

Not a great solution, maybe, but I don't see another one offhand...
-Eric

Hello Eric,

   Thank you for your quick reply (very nice picture !!!), this is a good news for me and people who work on granular media. 
However I saw the filter tube in Paraview, but I am a beginner and I don't know to write a correct data file to display this element.

I wrote a little file (see attached file) where I have the point positions (XYZ), the segments (2 Pt_i Pt_j) and the value of radius.
How can I modifiy this file to see the tube instead of four segments

Please, can you help me once again ?

Many thanks
JF

Hi guys.

First of all, I asked about the separation of parameters and Eric answered
my question (in the case of any tag Handling). Thanks Eric.

I still have the problem with the color map that I don't know how to solve
but I can by-pass it.

To display my data, I need to load a csv file, use the table to points
filter, use the triangulate filter and then apply the threshold filter 3
times. I want to automate this and I though that the costume filter might do
the trick however:


   1. I can't find my filters is in the filters list.
   2. I couldn't find any clear documentation on this topic. When I right
   click the table to point filer for example, and choose the costume filter. I
   don't have any options about the input and output field and then, in the
   properties selection all I have is the X,Y,Z Column. How do I create a
   costume filter properly. Is there a way to write my own filter?

Thanks

I suggest you look at readers.xml and look as the example for the PNGSeriesReader

http://paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=blob;f=Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml

Note also that both the PNG and the JPEG readers are enabled as "FileSeries".

But one must understand the difference between a) "FileSeries" and b) reading a stack of images as a volume.

a) reading a list of files as a series, means that you end up with a time-dependent series of 2D vtkImageData (look at the Time values in teh Information panel)

b) reading the list as a volume gives me a single 3D vtkImageData

I implemented the reading as a volume since I wanted to apply 3D filters (such as isosurface) to the data.

In VTK there is a vtkImageDivergence filter:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Images/ImageDivergence

<http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Images/ImageDivergence>It doesn't
look like there is an interface to this in Paraview. You can write one - it
is actually quite easy:

Subject: [Paraview] animation in ParaView
Message-ID: <4CE529B6.6010708@knmi.nl>

Hello everyone,

I want to make an animation using ParaView. I found it takes very long 
time to make 300 frames. Of course my data are a bit large. But I'm 
suspicious that it interpolates the data before make the shot?? Does 
anyone know about this? Is it possible to avoid this?

Thanks!

No, ParaView does not interpolate data (unless you explicitly applied
such a filer in the pipeline). HOwever, ParaView will render each and
every frame even if you expected nothing to change in that frame. So,
if your data is large, there's not much one can do but to wait for the
300 frames to render. Unless you have 300 timesteps however, you don't
need to render 300 frames. Try reducing the frame rate and the number
of frames and you may be able to get by with an animation of the same
length (in time) using lesser number of frames.

Hey Jean-Fran?ois,

Well, since you want to apply the Tube filter, you may want to define your data as POLYDATA instead of unstructured grid (since you have to turn the data into vtkPolyData to apply the Tube filter, anyway). Then, since the radius of the tube filter is based on point data rather than cell data, you'll have to run Cell Data to Point Data in ParaView at some point, but with the way your data is defined now you share points at the intersections of the line segments, and so the point data will end up as the average value of each of the neighboring cells. (Just run it on your data file and you'll see in the Inspector tab that all values are 15.) You can solve this by running the Shrink filter first with a Shrink Factor of 1.0 and it will duplicate the end points for you. (This will also create an Unstructured Grid out of your polydata, though.) So, you might want to just define the duplicate end points in your data file. With this you can just load it in, run cell data to point data, and then apply tubes. Of course, you can also just define point data in your data file, where you duplicate the cell data for each of the line segment end points instead of doing this with ParaView.

With separate cells you'll always get disconnected tubes (instead of one continuous tube with "nice" joined corners around the square, in this case) -- I don't think you can avoid this with the way you need to define your data on the edges.

Mainly it comes down to choices between how much you want to do with ParaView filters, and how much you want to pre-process and just store in your data file instead. I'll attach an alternate vtk file which does the extreme example of putting everything in the data file so all you have to do is load it in and apply the Tube filter. (But again, if you want to store minimal information in you data file, you can just use your original data file and apply the pipeline: file.vtk->Shrink->CellDatatoPointData->ExtractSurface->Tube.)

Hope this helps,
-Eric

If you also have the lines between them as part of the geometry you're loading into ParaView, then you can use the Tube filter to represent those bonds with size and color proportional to the values _at the end points that define the lines_. I haven't used the Tube filter very much, but it looks like e.g. if you have two points which define a polydata line, it ignores "cell data", which would be defined on the line itself connecting the points, but it can use the "point data", which would be an attribute defined on the two points at the ends of the lines... (If you only have scalar attributes defined on the lines, you can always run the data through Cell Data to Point Data filter before creating the tubes.)

Look at ParaViewSource/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml

Almost all readers have properties like CellArrayStatus/CellArrayInfo
or PointArrayStatus/PointArrayInfo. You want to define your reader xml
similarly. Note that it expects your reader to have API as

* int GetNumberOf<Attribute>Arrays
* const char* Get<Attribute>ArrayName (int index)
* int Get<Attribute>ArrayStatus(const char* arrayname)

Where <Attribute> is replaced by the value for the XML item
"attribute_name" specified on  the ArraySelectionInformationHelper
element.

Hope that helps.

Hi Eric,

Many thanks for your file and your clear explanations, I managed to do that I wanted. I have learned many things on Paraview and I discovered the power of filters.

I tried your method but get some error message, which I do not completely understand. I'm fairly new to ParaView an Python, so maybe my problem quite simple to you. If you could provide me any help on this, I would be very graceful. 

I'm using ParaView 3.8.1 (64 -bit) on a Mac OS 10.6 system.

When I try to re-implent your method, I get the error message:

I fixed this by adding paraview to the import line:

instead of
> import vtk

But then I get another error stating:
> Traceback (most recent call last):

I'm wondering, if I do a 2D cut of a 3D model, will the ID shown be a
number assigned for hte point/element in the 2D plane only? The
coordinates don't seem to match with that of the 3D mode and I've no
way of going the middle of the volume plot and seeing everything
clearly and selecting points from there...

Is there some way I can find the global ID of a given selected point
in a 2D cut?

Or, if it's not possible to show the global ID of a given selected

Hi:

i want write my results into VTK format, then i can use the paraview.
but i have some problem. my compute model is 700KM*700KM, there are 71*71
nodes. it's a Quadrilateral mesh.

my matlab code as followed
% Model size, m
xsize=700000;
ysize=700000;
% Defining resolution
xnum=71;
ynum=71;
NP=xnum*ynum;

% In horizontal direction
gridx=zeros(xnum,1);
for i=2:1:xnum
    gridx(i)=gridx(i-1)+xstp;
end

% In vertical direction
gridy=zeros(ynum,1);
for i=2:1:6
    gridy(i)=gridy(i-1)+20000;
end
for i=7:1:46
    gridy(i)=gridy(i-1)+1250;
end
for i=46:1:51
    gridy(i)=gridy(i-1)+10000;
end
for i=51:1:71
    gridy(i)=gridy(i-1)+25000;
end
gridy(ynum)=ysize;

%write the points
a=0;
for i=1:1:ynum
    for j=1:1:xnum
        a=a+1;
        Points(1,a)=gridx(j);
        Points(2,a)=gridy(i);
    end
end
% write the cell
nn=0;
for j=1:1:ynum
    for i=1:1:xnum
        nn=nn+1;
        Cells(1,nn)=(j-1)*(xnum+1)+i;
        Cells(2,nn)=(j-1)*(xnum+1)+i+1;
        Cells(3,nn)=j*(xnum+1)+i+1;
        Cells(4,nn)=j*(xnum+1)+i;
        Cells(5,nn)=nn;
    end
end
% write VTK file
fp=fopen('Resault.vtk','w');
fprintf(fp,'# vtk DataFile Version 3.0\n');
fprintf(fp,'vtk output\n');
fprintf(fp,'ASCII\n');
fprintf(fp,'DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID\n');

    fprintf(fp,'%e %e %e \n',Points(1,i),Points(2,i),0);
end

    aa=aa+1;
    fprintf(fp,'%d %d %d %d

end

for i=1:NC
    fprintf(fp,'%d\n',4);
end
fprintf(fp,'\n');
fprintf(fp,'POINT_DATA %d\n',NP);

when i tried to open it with paraview.
it sayed "ERROR: In

Hello,

after using this filter I see that cell data array disappeared from
the pipeline (I see it through Object Inspector - "Information" tab -
"Data Arrays").
It happens on some of my files, with other files "Merge Blocks" filter
keep all data arrays.

Is it a normal behaviour or not?

Thanks in advance,
Mike.

I have an excel file which contains x,y,z (points coordinates) and an id (i use 
it to group coordinates according to specific feature).
I want to visualize points with Paraview. I tried to save my file in .csv 
format and i opened. What i see is a table with 4 columns (x, y, z,id). Is 
there any way to visualize these points?
And....is there any way to color points, with the same id, with the same 
color?

Dear list,

As a newbie I have some problems to display the third dimension in paraview.
I have opened a nc file which displays nicely although only in 2D. The third
dimension is shown in the Object Inspector under variable but I don't know
how to display it.
Can somebody point me in the right direction, please.

What is an "nc" file?

If you click the "split window" button, you can then choose "3D
window". Then when you make the data visible in that window it will be
3d.

Would anyone agree to a feature request of having the option of
changing the window type, exactly so you can open this type of file
and then just click "3d" without having to open a new window and close
the old one?

I think:

1. It should be "DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID" not "DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID"
2. In CELLS it should be NC*5 not NC*4, because this represents the total
number of integer values in the CELL list. In your case it is (Number of
elements*(1 + Number of nodes per element))
3. In the CELL list you should have
Number of nodes per element, node1, node2, node3, node4
...
...
Therefore, it should be:
fprintf(fp,'%d %d %d %d
%d\n',4,Cells(1,i)-1,Cells(2,i)-1,Cells(3,i)-1,Cells(4,i)-1);

4. Because you are displaying Quadrilateral, in the list of CELL_TYPE you
should use:

fprintf(fp,'%d\n',9);  not fprintf(fp,'%d\n',4); 4 is for polyline see
figure 3 of (5)


5. See http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf for detail

Good luck!

Thank for the reply.
I am using a netcdf grid file. This file consists of three dimensions. When
I open it in paraview the x- and y-dimensions are nicely displayed while the
z-variable is colour coded. I, however, would like to display the the
z-dimension in z-direction.

Opening the data in 3D mode allows me to rotate the grid as a flat disc but
does not give me a 3D effect of the z-dimension. Changing the vertical scale
had no effect either. In the Object Inspector>Information>Data Array is the
z-dimension listed with z, float, [5.566, 170.259] for Name, Data Type, Data
Ranges, respectively. In the Extents field, however, is the Z Extent 0 to 0
(dimension: 1).
Can anybody help?

Merge blocks will remove any arrays not present in all the blocks. Are
the arrays that are disappearing available on all the blocks that you
are merging? You can verify that by going to the information tab. Any
any arrays marked as "partial" are not present on all blocks.

You can right click on the top title bar of a view to get a "Convert

Try applying the "Table to Points" filter. There you can choose the 3
arrays that constitute the point coordinates. After which, you can
choose to color the points using "id" either on  the Display tab or
using the color-toolbar.

Ah, nice. It seems to change (disable) the visibility of the pipeline
objects though when switching from a 2D to 3D view.

(Sorry Xian, you're thread kind of got hijacked).

Ok, I found a way now. I will post it here for the benefit of future
readers.
I had to apply two filters to the data. First 'Extract Suface' and then '
Warp by Scalar'.

However, I encountered another problem now. While these filters worked fine
on one file they made Paraview crash on another. The only difference between
the two files as far as I can see is that the latter has holes in its
z-dimensions indicated by 'nan'. is this a problem for paraview.

Your csv has all numerical values in quotes ("). That's resulting in
treating those values are strings instead of numbers. Remove the
quotes from all numerical values and it should load it in correctly.
Also there are "," in  place of decimal points. You may want to fix
that too.

Hello,

I have a series of vtk legacy files which are named like
1.vtk,  2.vtk, 3.vtk, ....
Can anyone kindly tell me how I can load them and apply filter automatically
based on the time steps? For example I may first manually load 1.vtk and
then I apply some filters on it. When I click 'Next Frame' paraview will
load 2.vtk and apply the same filter on it. In this way I can generate a
movie.
Thanks very much.

Dear All,

I am new to paraview and its so vast I dunno where to start to learn. I want
to plot a microstructual unit cell comprising of more than one material.
The microstrcture is a cube discretized using a structured finite element
mesh and each finite element has one material property.
To cut short, how do I start to create a figure like the one that is on *the
right half of the figure*, in the following link

any help is appreciated.

There are a few different ways to do this. One client I am working  
with is creating an UNSTRUCTURED_GRID file full of "VOXELS" where each  
voxel has a scalar value associated with it. When you load this up in  
ParaView you will get something like the image you linked to.

Message-ID: <89162.2489.qm@web29610.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Dear Utkarsh,

I am just wondering what disanvantages the disabling of the window popup has? 
Since it still is in the current git code I guess the code that is commended by 
this fix has some use?


Thanks and Regards

Bastian


Utkarsh,

I've now been able to test out the new patch and it is working fine. To be
honest, this is all that is required as it removes the annoyance of having
numerous pop-up windows cluttering your desktop anytime you try to run
ParaView in parallel.

Thanks again!

I believe you are talking about the server-side render window that pops up.

I am attaching a experimental patch to get you started. It works only on
Linux. All I am doing it not mapping the window. Now when you run server
with offscreen:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

and connect to it from ParaView client, you should no longer see any
server-side windows when remote rendering.

Of course the patch is more of a hack, but it should give you a starting
point.

The issue may or may not be related to the nan values.  It is certainly possible that something in ParaView is crashing when encountering a NaN.  Until recently, there was no support whatsoever for NaN, and there is still plenty of code on VTK/ParaView that was not written with NaN in mind and could conceivably crash.

That said, I just tried loading in a netCDF data set with NaN values then running extract surface and warp by scalars and it worked just fine.  Could you send the group an example data set?

Ok, I found a way now. I will post it here for the benefit of future readers.
I had to apply two filters to the data. First 'Extract Suface' and then ' Warp by Scalar'.

However, I encountered another problem now. While these filters worked fine on one file they made Paraview crash on another. The only difference between the two files as far as I can see is that the latter has holes in its z-dimensions indicated by 'nan'. is this a problem for paraview.

Ah, nice. It seems to change (disable) the visibility of the pipeline
objects though when switching from a 2D to 3D view.

(Sorry Xian, you're thread kind of got hijacked).

I am new to paraview and its so vast I dunno where to start to learn. I want to plot a microstructual unit cell comprising of more than one material.
The microstrcture is a cube discretized using a structured finite element mesh and each finite element has one material property.
To cut short, how do I start to create a figure like the one that is on the right half of the figure, in the following link

Hi Bastian,

Have you encountered any problems with using the supplied patch (if you are
using it, that is)? It's been almost a year since I applied it and we have
been using it here without any obvious problems that could be attributed to
it.

Dear Utkarsh,

I am just wondering what disanvantages the disabling of the window popup

Since it still is in the current git code I guess the code that is commended
by this fix has some use?


Thanks and Regards

Utkarsh,

I've now been able to test out the new patch and it is working fine. To be
honest, this is all that is required as it removes the annoyance of having
numerous pop-up windows cluttering your desktop anytime you try to run
ParaView in parallel.

Thanks again!

Hi,

     I have a collection of datasets that is 500 x 500 x 100 scalar and 
vector

     I can load them in Paraview but it is difficult to work with (slow).

     What filter would you recommend to sub/re-sample the inputs to a 
smaller amount e.g. (100 x 100 x 20), so as to get a quick visualization 
(interactive) of the datasets?

If the change can be defined using a mathematical expression, you can
use the "Calculator" filter.  If these are arbitrary changes that you
want to make manually (think Excel), then unfortunately ParaView
doesn't facilitate such changes.

position" to zoom in and zoom out to the object. But I couldn't make 
nice rotation. I saw it was possible to do this by using "camera orbit". 
My question is whether is it possible to combine these two functions? Or 
is there a way to cat two movie file together...?

Thanks!

Xueli Wang

You can combine two video files back to back using mencoder:

mencoder -of mpeg -oac copy -ovc copy -o output.mpg file1.mpg file2.mpg

Thanks David for your reply. You know I have movie file with .avi in the 
file name. Can I just replace th file1.mpg by file1.avi?

Thanks!

Extract Subset with a stride of 5,5,5 will do a raw down-sampling. You may
want to write out the smaller dataset to a new set of files because IO of
each timestep is probably the biggest bottleneck and downsampling happens
only after IO.

Hi Adriano,

no I have no problems. However, I see the code that opens up the window
is still in the git so I think it is useful for something more than
blocking ones display, isn't it?

Well, I also had the same thought and at the time Utkarsh did say it was a
quick fix for the issue.

Subject: [Paraview] change of axis names in 3D view??
Message-ID: <4CEB9283.9070302@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi,

I use a custom reader (.c++, .ui, .xml) to read my custom files. But the 
information in the file is not always relates to the spacial coordinates 
x, y, z.

I will like to change the names of the axes in the 3D view (the 
Orientation Axes), at the moment the user press apply, so the user can 
see the real axes names of the data.

(I look at the class vtkPVAxesActor:: setXAxisLabeltext(...); but how 
can I access this object from my reader ... (I think is not possible).)


thanks,

To be honest, I am not too sure if there would be any issues with the
patch. Hopefully, someone with more knowledge of X and OpenGL can
comment.

You are right, it's not possible to change the labels for the
orientation axes from a plugin.

Hi Mubashir,

ParaView has several gradient filters. If you apply these to a vector field,
they should produce a tensor. Then you can use the array calculator to
calculate the divergence. In the next version, you will be able to do this
directly through the Python Calculator. If you want to try out this feature,
you need to compile ParaView from source using Python and also make sure
that you have NumPy installed.

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to select: Append attributes
Message-ID: <AANLkTin=M73dPY2EAKxaxZfzthyw8itLYBYgp5byn5F7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Paraviewers,

I would like to do a mesh refinement analysis using the predefined filters
of paraview (I can already do such an analysis with numpy and pylab).
My objective is to calculate the difference between the pressure fields of a
fine grid simulation and a coarse grid simulation.

I have two OpenFoam simulations: A fine grid simulation and a coarse grid
simulation (attached tarball).
I have imported the results of both simulations into paraview.
Then I have resampled the fine grid solution as follows:
Select fine grid source >Resample with dataset > Source>Coarse grid
Then I apply a calculator on the resampled solution and basically rename the
point pressure variable to 'presampled'
I also apply a calculator on the coarse solution and rename the point
pressure variable to 'pcoarse'

The next step should be:
Select both calculators and apply the 'Append attributes' filter.
However, this filter is not selectable at this stage (grayed out)
I can confirm that both calculators have the same number of points and
cells.

Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong or whether there is a better way of
performing a grid sensitivity study in paraview?

Thank you,
George

It looks like the Append Attributes filter does not work with multiblock data, which is what the OpenFOAM reader is creating.  To get around the problem, try running the Merge Blocks filter on the readers for both the coarse and fine data.  Then follow your instructions below on the merged blocks and I think it shouldl work.

Subject: [Paraview] XY-Plot: Drag force of a body summed along its flow
	length
Message-ID: <4CEC29A2.4090403@yahoo.de>

Hi all,

I want to create a XY-Plot of a body, e.g. a sphere where the x-axis is
the length parallel to the flow direction (for a sphere from 0 to
diameter) and y is the summed drag on the body. At x=sphere diameter I
will get the drag of the complete spare on y.

The question is how to do it. I have tools to get the dragforce as a
scalar into paraview. I need to clip the body and sum the forces over
the clipped body. This must be done several times to get a continuos
line-plot. The summed values and the corresponding position has to be
stored somewhere to create the lineplot finally. Ideas?

Thanks Bastian

Hello everyone,

I tried to compile ParaView 3.8.1 with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS,
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI and PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON options turned on, but I
get following linking errors:

I use Visual Studio 2008 SP1, CMake 2.8 and OpenMPI 1.4.3 (compiled
with default options in Release mode). Same errors I get when trying
to compile under CentOS 5.3 (with precompiled OpenMPI 1.4.3 sources)
too. Other projects are compiled well in both cases. Does anyone knows
how to solve this problem? I believe the solution is in setting
appropriate building options for OpenMPI, but I'm not sure what to do.

Thanks,
Nenad.

Hi

I would like to compare (subtract) datasets derived over different unstructured triangular grids (which have the same boundary).  Can paraview handle this using existing filters?  If so, how?

thanks

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.8.1 hangs on select points/cells for
 plugin-generated multiblock data set
Message-ID: <4CECC720.8020100@web.de>

Hi all,

I've a multiblock reader plugin which behaves nicely in Unix
environments (Linux and Solaris, 32 and 64bit), but seems to cause
problems under Windows (XP and 7, 32 and 64bit, compiled with Visual
Studio 2008 SP1 against official PV Development release):
Importing the data, viewing the data and exporting the data to different
file formats (e.g. as *.vtm) and importing that data again into ParaView
works without any problem, but whenever I use SelectCells or
SelectPoints from the selection toolbar and lasso select an area from an
object imported by this reader, ParaView hangs - under Windows, not in a
Unix environment. If, however, one applies a MergeBlocks filter first
and then lasso selects an area, there is no problem.

I boiled down the reader to a minimal test case, it's more or less a
mere source now (but still implemented as a reader) and am attaching the
source code. Once compiled, it will integrate into paraview and offer to
open any file named *.mini (there is one in subdirectory sample-input).
The content of the file is completely ignored, instead a multiblock
containing one unstructured grid with exactly one cube is created. This
is enough to trigger the problem.

I'd like to know whether this is a problem with the ParaView Windows
builds or whether I am misconstructing a multiblock data set which
somehow confuses only Windows builds. I tend to believe the latter (as a
data object generator source using the program "MB { UG1 }" does not
cause ParaView to hang when trying to select something), but have no
idea what I might be doing wrong.

Thanks a lot for any feedback
Karl

Not easily. The easiest thing may be to put a label or something on
the properties page for the reader itself, using a custom panel.

Subject: [Paraview] slice filter
Message-ID: <AANLkTinkX_LhUhoQoqQ88hfSJnejsCuqjaC4OOTs-A0E@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I have been trying to slice my image by a plane. However, whenever I press
the apply-button no sliced picture appears but only the emty box. My data
are displayed as points so that I thought the plane actually cuts between
the points. If this is the problem how can I convert my original image into
a surface? Could someone point me in the right direction?

Cheers,
xian

Subject: [Paraview] How to update GUI/paraview when data and time change in
	a reader ?
Message-ID: <921905.36775.qm@web26102.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Here?s my problems. I have a reader that load a geometry and some attributes (at 
the points). These attributes changed in the time and I can select one of them 
in a combo box (GUI in the reader).
For example, I have 2 attributes ?A? and ?B?.  So In the reader, by default the 
first attribute is seleted (? A ?).  The  selection in the reader GUI makes  the 
call of a method doing the change of the selected attribute (? A ?) and 
corresponding time values. For time values it looks like this :

vtkDemandDrivenPipeline* ddp = 
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::SafeDownCast(this->GetExecutive());
vtkInformationVector* outputVector = ddp->GetOutputInformation();
vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
                    
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(), & timeData[0], 
numTimeData);                   

                                  
doubletimeRange[2];
 
timeRange[0] = timeData[0];
timeRange[1] = timData[numTimeData-1];                      
                    
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);
 
The problems are the following. When I select ?B? and make apply, timevalues 
corresponding to ?B? are set and a new vtkPolyData is made with the 
corresponding point attribute data of ?B? for the given time step. But, in 
paraview, the mapped variable of the toolbars is not update. ?A? is always here 
(whereas I would like to have ?B?). 


-> How and where can we say to paraview to update the GUI and have the B appears 
in the mapped variable of the toolbars ?

Moreover, Paraview has a geometry cache  (Edit/settings /Animation). But when 
for example atributes ?A? and ?B? have the same time values and that we have 
selected all the time step for ? A ?, when we select ?B?, nothing is done 
because paraview has cached data for the ?A? and for the same time values than 
?B?. So paraview doesn?t need to update beacause it considerer to have data for 
the requested time step.

-> So, How can I say to Paraview that when a new attribute is selected, it needs 
to empty it?s cache and load data for requested time ?
 
Thank you.

Hi there,

I'm trying to build paraview 3.8.1 on the mac using standard options with Qt 4.6.2 built from source. I get the following error:

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Rny_UQdxZKJV-NOYK9VFud+m1PQLGQesNiCPt@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just a word for the people who use the surface LIC plugin.
You should take care of the projection that you use : Im' quite sure that
the surface LIC use the parallel projection mode in order to compute the
streamlines.

Thus, looking tangentially to a surface, using LIC and perspective
projection mode, the directions of the streamlines is not correct.

Hi.

I am not a PV developer - but rather just a user so I'm not sure hot
to interpret this error message I get on startup:

I am using the SuperquadricTensor plugin which I downloaded from the
PV wiki.  If this isn't a big deal that's great, but I just wanted to
make sure and/or get rid of the message if I could.

Also - I just rebuilt both Paraview (from git) and the plugin, so
everything is fully up to date.

Thanks.

Looks like you have some custom filter that uses a filter provided by
a plugin. Currently, it's a bug that ParaView raises these errors when
custom filter definitions include plugins. To get rid of the error,
remove the custom filter definitions using Tools | Manage Custom
Filter.

Yes - that's right. I had a couple of old custom filters which
referenced the Superquadric Tensor plugin.

I guess it has to do with the order in which things are loaded on launch.

At any rate - when I remove the custom filters the messages go away as
you suggest.

Thanks!!

Is the image a 2D image or a 3D image?  With the slice filter as the active
filter (e.g. highlighted in the Pipeline Browser), how many cells are listed
in the Information tab of the Object Inspector?

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver not rendering when built with osmesa (MPI
	disabled)
Message-ID: <4CED9CCC.2080904@sandia.gov>

I am trying to run a paraview server (pvserver) on a multinode machine 
using osmesa to do offscreen rendering (and then viewed from a client on 
another machine).

I have been successful in compiling pvserver with osmesa.  However, when 
I try to use pvserver, it hangs.  Specifically, I start a paraview 
client on machine A (bentley) and ask for a reverse-connection 
connection to a pvserver which I will start manually on machine B.  I go 
to machine B and start pvserver (in reverse connect, with machine A 
specified as the client host).

The connection is successful insofar as the output on the terminal I 
started pvserver on on machine B says

Connected to client.

However, no rendering occurs on the paraview client on Machine A.

quite a bit of digging later (including putting some printf calls into 
pvserver on machine B), I've figured out where the hang is:

In

vtkPVSynchronizedRenderWindows::SynchronizeBounds
we are in case RENDER_SERVER and we freeze during either the
c_rs_controller->Send
or
c_rs_controller->Receive
call.

A bit of the call stack is:

vtkPVSynchronizedRenderWindows::SynchronizeBounds
vtkPVRenderView::GatherBoundsInformation
vtkPVRenderView::Render

I belive this is the first render attempt made by pvserver.

I had compiled pvserver without MPI and am currently trying to recompile 
it with MPI.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Transform filter
Message-ID: <3D1619F26FA041E39FB7CF85CC162FE4@win.ara>


Dear All,

I've come across some strange behaviour using the transform filter. I have
two pipelines that are near identical. Infact, the only difference is the
point at which a transform about a single axis is applied. The process is as
follows:

1 Read Data
2 Extract Blocks
3 Extract Surface
4 Generate Surface Normals
5 Calculator (create vector, var*Normals)
6 Calculator (create vector from scalars)
7 Integrate data

If I apply the transform at any point before step 6, I get one set of
integrated values. If I apply it after step 6, then my x components of the
first vector & z component of the second vector are completely different
(even different signs), but the others still agree well. I noticed that the
transform filter was actually converting the value computed in item 6 from a
double to a float, so I changed this last night and recompiled. I also
changed the vtkPolyDataNormals to use doubles instead of floats. However,
neither of these changes has helped the issue. 

I fail to see why the timing of applying the transform for this case should
influence the results so. Have I missed something?

Regards,

Adriano

Hello,

I've downloaded the current development version of Paraview, but I can't install it. The installation stops always at the point, when the vtkWrapHierarchy executable tries to update the vtkRenderingHierarchy.txt file. The vtkWrapHierarchy executable shows no error messages, it just stops doing anything. What could be the reason?

yep, just tried the whole build again with ./configure -cocoa -arch x86_64 for the Qt build and it fails in the same spot

Alright, the last time I dealt with this error it had to do with some sort
of configuration inconsistency between how qt was built relating to platform
and cocoa/carbon. Can you now try to blow away your build of ParaView and
reconfigure it from scratch?

Subject: [Paraview] Temporal Filter
Message-ID: <SNT123-W4001D978B1871158EF8438BC200@phx.gbl>


Hi everybody,

I have written a small filter similar to the Temporal Interpolator, and it works nicely if I start calculating from the beginning of my timeseries. But I encounter problems if I jump directly to another timestep, let's say from 0 to 50. Then the filter does calculate the result correctly, but it is not displayed. Looking at the associated datasets, the values are correct, but they are strangely named - instead of "Result" it says "Result (partial)". 
Moving one step forward and then one step backward in time, the correct result is calculated and also displayed. 

Does anyone know what these "partial arrays" are?

Thanks a lot,
Natalie

So, I use the Modified() method that updates the internal time stamp for the 
object (from "The VTK User's Guide"). 

When I have attributes (points attributes  of a  vtkpolydata) with the same time 
steps, everything is fine and when I switch from one attribute to an other, the 
requested Time step is ok (because we have the same time steps).
But, when I have attributes with differents time steps (ex: A [1, 5, 10] and B 
[2, 6, 11]) there is a problem of update.  If I switch from an attribute to an 
other, the requested time step for the new selected attribute is the requested 
time step of the previous attribute.

So how can I correctly update  the requested time steps of the vtk pipeline when 
I updarte time steps and time range of the vtk pipeline ?

Objet : [Paraview] How to update GUI/paraview when data and time change in a 
reader ?


Hi,

Here?s my problems. I have a reader that load a geometry and some attributes (at 
the points). These attributes changed in the time and I can select one of them 
in a combo box (GUI in the reader).
For example, I have 2 attributes ?A? and ?B?.  So In the reader, by default the 
first attribute is seleted (? A ?).  The  selection in the reader GUI makes  the 
call of a method doing the change of the selected attribute (? A ?) and 
corresponding time values. For time values it looks like this :

vtkDemandDrivenPipeline* ddp = 
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::SafeDownCast(this->GetExecutive());
vtkInformationVector* outputVector = ddp->GetOutputInformation();
vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
                    
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(), & timeData[0], 
numTimeData);                   

                                  
doubletimeRange[2];
 
timeRange[0] = timeData[0];
timeRange[1] = timData[numTimeData-1];                      
                    
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);
 
The problems are the following. When I select ?B? and make apply, timevalues 
corresponding to ?B? are set and a new vtkPolyData is made with the 
corresponding point attribute data of ?B? for the given time step. But, in 
paraview, the mapped variable of the toolbars is not update. ?A? is always here 
(whereas I would like to have ?B?). 


-> How and where can we say to paraview to update the GUI and have the B appears 
in the mapped variable of the toolbars ?

Moreover, Paraview has a geometry cache  (Edit/settings /Animation). But when 
for example atributes ?A? and ?B? have the same time values and that we have 
selected all the time step for ? A ?, when we select ?B?, nothing is done 
because paraview has cached data for the ?A? and for the same time values than 
?B?. So paraview doesn?t need to update beacause it considerer to have data for 
the requested time step.

-> So, How can I say to Paraview that when a new attribute is selected, it needs 
to empty it?s cache and load data for requested time ?
 
Thank you.

Whenever I see partial on a dataset it's usually caused by a multiblock dataset having arrays on N blocks, but missing them on others. The information tab is telling you that on some blocks they exist - on others - they don't. Is it possible that when you jump in time arbitrarily, the source object is falling over on some blocks.

If your data isn't multiblock, then ignore this. The temporal data created is probably wrong somehow and paraview is thinking its multiblock when it shouldn't be - (the temporal output is a collection object and there are many known bugs in the current implementation which I will hopefully fix around Christmas time).

If the time values change, then the view needs to be told to update with a new ?time? ? you?ll need to force an update with something similar to
vtkPVView::SetViewTime
(You?ll also want to make sure the timekeeper refreshes itself when the reader updates ? to ensure that paraview has the coorect times in it?s internal state).

I though that the fact that using in RequestInfo :

outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(), &timedata[0], 
numTimeData); 

outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS(), 
&myRequestedTime, 1);

and using in RequestData:

int tsLength = outInfo->Length(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
double* steps = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
double *requestedTimeSteps = 
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS());

would make the job.

But In my tests, as if outinfo is the same object (same address), the use of 
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS(), 
&myRequestedTime, 1); in RequestInfo doen't set my requestedTime but keep the 
old requested time.  Is-it Normal ?

If the time values change, then the view needs to be told to update with a new ?time? ? you?ll need to force an update with something similar to
vtkPVView::SetViewTime
(You?ll also want to make sure the timekeeper refreshes itself when the reader updates ? to ensure that paraview has the coorect times in it?s internal state).

So, I use the Modified() method that updates the internal time stamp for the object (from "The VTK User's Guide").
When I have attributes (points attributes  of a  vtkpolydata) with the same time steps, everything is fine and when I switch from one attribute to an other, the requested Time step is ok (because we have the same time steps).
But, when I have attributes with differents time steps (ex: A [1, 5, 10] and B [2, 6, 11]) there is a problem of update.  If I switch from an attribute to an other, the requested time step for the new selected attribute is the requested time step of the previous attribute.

So how can I correctly update  the requested time steps of the vtk pipeline when I updarte time steps and time range of the vtk pipeline ?

Hi,

Here?s my problems. I have a reader that load a geometry and some attributes (at the points). These attributes changed in the time and I can select one of them in a combo box (GUI in the reader).
For example, I have 2 attributes ?A? and ?B?.  So In the reader, by default the first attribute is seleted (? A ?).  The  selection in the reader GUI makes  the call of a method doing the change of the selected attribute (? A ?) and corresponding time values. For time values it looks like this :

vtkDemandDrivenPipeline* ddp = vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::SafeDownCast(this->GetExecutive());
vtkInformationVector* outputVector = ddp->GetOutputInformation();
vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(), & timeData[0], numTimeData);

double timeRange[2];

timeRange[0] = timeData[0];
timeRange[1] = timData[numTimeData-1];

outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);

The problems are the following. When I select ?B? and make apply, timevalues corresponding to ?B? are set and a new vtkPolyData is made with the corresponding point attribute data of ?B? for the given time step. But, in paraview, the mapped variable of the toolbars is not update. ?A? is always here (whereas I would like to have ?B?).

-> How and where can we say to paraview to update the GUI and have the B appears in the mapped variable of the toolbars ?

Moreover, Paraview has a geometry cache  (Edit/settings /Animation). But when for example atributes ?A? and ?B? have the same time values and that we have selected all the time step for ? A ?, when we select ?B?, nothing is done because paraview has cached data for the ?A? and for the same time values than ?B?. So paraview doesn?t need to update beacause it considerer to have data for the requested time step.

-> So, How can I say to Paraview that when a new attribute is selected, it needs to empty it?s cache and load data for requested time ?

Thank you.

Hi Xian,

Please reply to the list so that everyone can participate in the
conversation.

As for your problem, how many cells and points are in the original image
data set?  Did you change the location of the slice plane?  I believe by
default the slice plane has a normal in the x-direction and is centered on
the bounding box of the domain.  Did you hit apply after selecting the slice
filter?

If after checking these things you still don't get it working properly, can
you share your data set?

Andy

when I use  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),  
&TimeStepValues[0], numTimeStepValues); it is for set all the time  values of my 
selected attribute.

Then I compare the requestedTimeValue obtain using  
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0];

Then I try to look if the requestedTimeValue is in my TimeStepValues array. If 
not, I use: 

double newTime = TimeStepValues[0];
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS(), &newTime, 
1);

Doing this two last operation in RequestInfo doesn't set the newTime.  but doing 
this in RequestData works (and outInfo has the same address in  RequestInfo and 
RequestData).

In the gui the TimeStepValues are ok, but not the requestedTimeStep. There is 
something wrong. But where, I don't know !

Apologies, reread the mail after I sent it and I see that you did set TIME_STEPS. Changing UPDATE_TIME_STEPS  can be done in request update extent, but not request information. One usually does this when modifying time as it passes through the pipeline. I don?t think you want to do this. when you change the TIME_STEPS, paraview should refresh it?s internal knowledge of time and change the requested time to something sensible. if this is not happening, then

Then I compare the requestedTimeValue obtain using

Doing this two last operation in RequestInfo doesn't set the newTime. but doing

UPDATE_TIME STEPS is what is being requested from you. Are you sure yoy 
shouldn?t be setting 

 
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),
      &this->TimeStepValues[0],
      static_cast<int>(this->TimeStepValues.size()));
 
or similar in your request information? When this changes, the time keeper 
should refresh, and then the GUI ought to change the time it asks for (assuming 
there?s some whay it can know the correct time)

If the time values change, then the view needs to be told to update with a new 
?time? ? you?ll need to force an update with something similar to
vtkPVView::SetViewTime
(You?ll also want to make sure the timekeeper refreshes itself when the reader 
updates ? to ensure that paraview has the coorect times in it?s internal state).

So, I use the Modified() method that updates the internal time stamp for the 
object (from "The VTK User's Guide"). 

When I have attributes (points attributes  of a  vtkpolydata) with the same time 
steps, everything is fine and when I switch from one attribute to an other, the 
requested Time step is ok (because we have the same time steps).
But, when I have attributes with differents time steps (ex: A [1, 5, 10] and B 
[2, 6, 11]) there is a problem of update.  If I switch from an attribute to an 
other, the requested time step for the new selected attribute is the requested 
time step of the previous attribute.

So how can I correctly update  the requested time steps of the vtk pipeline when 
I updarte time steps and time range of the vtk pipeline ?

Objet : [Paraview] How to update GUI/paraview when data and time change in a 
reader ?
Hi,
 
Here?s my problems. I have a reader that load a geometry and some attributes (at 
the points). These attributes changed in the time and I can select one of them 
in a combo box (GUI in the reader).
For example, I have 2 attributes ?A? and ?B?.  So In the reader, by default the 
first attribute is seleted (? A ?).  The  selection in the reader GUI makes  the 
call of a method doing the change of the selected attribute (? A ?) and 
corresponding time values. For time values it looks like this :
 
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline* ddp = 
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::SafeDownCast(this->GetExecutive());
vtkInformationVector* outputVector = ddp->GetOutputInformation();
vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
                    
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(), & timeData[0], 
numTimeData);                   

                                  
doubletimeRange[2];
 
timeRange[0] = timeData[0];
timeRange[1] = timData[numTimeData-1];                      
                    
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);
 
The problems are the following. When I select ?B? and make apply, timevalues 
corresponding to ?B? are set and a new vtkPolyData is made with the 
corresponding point attribute data of ?B? for the given time step. But, in 
paraview, the mapped variable of the toolbars is not update. ?A? is always here 
(whereas I would like to have ?B?). 

 
-> How and where can we say to paraview to update the GUI and have the B appears 
in the mapped variable of the toolbars ?
 
Moreover, Paraview has a geometry cache  (Edit/settings /Animation). But when 
for example atributes ?A? and ?B? have the same time values and that we have 
selected all the time step for ? A ?, when we select ?B?, nothing is done 
because paraview has cached data for the ?A? and for the same time values than 
?B?. So paraview doesn?t need to update beacause it considerer to have data for 
the requested time step.
 
-> So, How can I say to Paraview that when a new attribute is selected, it needs 
to empty it?s cache and load data for requested time ?
 
Thank you.

When you use the transform filter it will also transform the "active"
vectors, i.e. rotating the model will rotate the vectors too.  Note: this is
very confusing if you have multiple vectors as it is not immediately obvious
which one is getting transformed (as only one is "active").

Paul

Dear All,

I've come across some strange behaviour using the transform filter. I have
two pipelines that are near identical. Infact, the only difference is the
point at which a transform about a single axis is applied. The process is as
follows:

1 Read Data
2 Extract Blocks
3 Extract Surface
4 Generate Surface Normals
5 Calculator (create vector, var*Normals)
6 Calculator (create vector from scalars)
7 Integrate data

If I apply the transform at any point before step 6, I get one set of
integrated values. If I apply it after step 6, then my x components of the
first vector & z component of the second vector are completely different
(even different signs), but the others still agree well. I noticed that the
transform filter was actually converting the value computed in item 6 from a
double to a float, so I changed this last night and recompiled. I also
changed the vtkPolyDataNormals to use doubles instead of floats. However,
neither of these changes has helped the issue.

I fail to see why the timing of applying the transform for this case should
influence the results so. Have I missed something?

Adriano

Hello,

Any Idea?

The code executed is coming from the Python trace of Paraview 3.8.1
Is there a workaround for this kind of issues?

I found the problem ... In fact, the th z table is refering to Velocity in
my case)... and the for the non-working cases, range are between [0, 0]
And it seems to give problems as this table is used by Glyph2 ....

Subject: [Paraview] Normals consistency on a Multi-block dataset of surfaces
Message-ID: <4CEF8B93.2010407@onera.fr>

Hello all.

Could someone tell me if there is a simple way to get Normals 
consistency over a multi-block dataset that contains only structured 
surfaces grids?

Here is my problem: I have a multi-zone Tecplot file that contains the 
skin of the right part of an aircraft, so the skin is NOT closed in the 
symmetry plane. The skin is a collection of structured IxJ ordered 
surface grids. The orientation of the surface grids are not consistent, 
some grids having normals pointing outward, other grids having normals 
pointing inward, and I need all normals pointing the same direction for 
Surface Flow integration.

The Tecplot reader gives a multi-block dataset and I am using these 
filters for rendering:

Tecplot reader->Extract Surface->Generate Surface Normals

The Generate Surface Normals filter is used with Consistency property on 
(the default).

Also rendering with light is OK, adding the NormalGlyph filter shows 
that normals are still inconsistent, each surface grid keeping its 
orientation, and using the Surface Flow filter with any vector gives bad 
results.

Thank you in advance for any suggestion.

Best regards.

Paul,
 
I've just checked that out and, by applying the filter twice after each
vector creation it works now. That has completely caught me out. I assumed
(not a good thing clearly) that the filter would transform the entire
data-set, but at least it explains why only a single vector was getting
converted to a float.
 
Thanks again for pointing this out.
 
Regards,
 
Adriano

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Problem with Transform filter



When you use the transform filter it will also transform the "active"
vectors, i.e. rotating the model will rotate the vectors too.  Note: this is
very confusing if you have multiple vectors as it is not immediately obvious
which one is getting transformed (as only one is "active").

Dear All,

I've come across some strange behaviour using the transform filter. I have
two pipelines that are near identical. Infact, the only difference is the
point at which a transform about a single axis is applied. The process is as
follows:

1 Read Data
2 Extract Blocks
3 Extract Surface
4 Generate Surface Normals
5 Calculator (create vector, var*Normals)
6 Calculator (create vector from scalars)
7 Integrate data

If I apply the transform at any point before step 6, I get one set of
integrated values. If I apply it after step 6, then my x components of the
first vector & z component of the second vector are completely different
(even different signs), but the others still agree well. I noticed that the
transform filter was actually converting the value computed in item 6 from a
double to a float, so I changed this last night and recompiled. I also
changed the vtkPolyDataNormals to use doubles instead of floats. However,
neither of these changes has helped the issue.

I fail to see why the timing of applying the transform for this case should
influence the results so. Have I missed something?

Regards,

Adriano

Shame on me!
I have found the (very simple) Solution! Just add the "Merge Blocks" 
filter between the Tecplot reader and the "Extract Surface" filter, and 
it gives an unstructured grid. Now the Consistency property of the 
"Generate Normals" is taken into account and "Surface flow" gives good 
results.

I hope that this will help other people.

First set your camera up. Next, open Tools->Python Shell and type:

camera = GetActiveCamera()

All your current camera settings will be accessable in 'camera'. The member
functions to access the specific values can be listed using dir(camera).

You may click on the "Adjust Camera" button which is the rightmost 
button of the left group of buttons in the bar above the 3D window. It 
opens the "Adjust Camera" window where you can see and save the current 
camera parameters.

Subject: [Paraview] GUI bug: Error message when moving the cursor on the
 menu bar
Message-ID: <4CEFBADA.50501@onera.fr>

Hello everybody.

Here I am again, but for a very annoying bug in the GUI of the PV 3.8.1 
Windows 32 bits version:
When I click on a menu item, for instance the "Filter" item,  its list 
of options appears. That's OK! Now if I don't make a choice in this 
options list and I move the cursor above the next item ("Tools") or the 
previous item ("Sources") without clicking again, the options list of 
the new item appears, but the "Output messages" window is shown with 
this error message:

> QAccessibleWidget::rect: This implementation does not support 
> subelements! (ID  X unknown for QMenuBar)

where X is a number depending of the item where the cursor is.

If I click on "Filters" and if I move the mouse over "Tools", "Macros", 
and "Help", I get three error messages with X being 6, 7 and 8 respectively.

This very annoying bug is on PV 3.8.1 Windows Vista 32 bits Premium Home 
edition. Each item on the main menu bar is concerned.

There is no such problem with PV 3.8.1 Linux 64 bits.

Regards

Hi Jeff,

Which version of paraview source code are you compiling, and which version
of osmesa are you using?

Luca,

There is no freehand selection of points in ParaView nor - to my
knowledge - an easy way to add/remove points from a selection using the
mouse (plus some control/shift/alt/apple/whatever key) or to do
intersections of selections as it is possible in a graphics editor.
There actually exists a petition at UserVoice for this:
http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/310404-non-rectangular-selection
You may want to go ahead and vote for such a feature to be implemented.

You might be able to accomplish what you want as follows:
Use the Calculator filter to expose the coordinates as a data array.
Then run a query (menu Edit - Find Data) on your data set using either
point IDs or coordinate values to select points.

You can subsequently modify the selection by either running more
queries on the extracted selection or with the Selection Inspector
(View menu). Activate the labels (Selection Inspector - Display Style -
Point Label. Tick the Visible checkbox.) and remove any point from the
selection you are not interested in by deleting its ID from the list.

There is actually a wiki page available on data selection in ParaView:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Data_Selection

It might also be possible to select points from the python shell, but
that's something I've never tried myself.

Subject: [Paraview] Calling the calculator filter repeatedly inside a
	for-loop
Message-ID: <4CF2AEA2.7010607@gmail.com>

Hi paraviewers,

I am trying to write a python script where I call the Calculator filter 
repeatedly inside a for-loop.
However, I am not quite sure how to write this for paraview. At the 
moment my code looks like this:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

# Data Processing
Coarse = OpenFOAMReader( FileName='C:\\Users\\Public\\Mesh.OpenFOAM' )
Coarse.CellArrays = ['U', 'U_0', 'p']
Coarse.MeshRegions = ['internalMesh']
SetActiveSource(Coarse)
CalculatorX = Calculator()
CalculatorX.AttributeMode = 'point_data'
CalculatorX.Function = 'p'
CalculatorX.ResultArrayName = 'Result'

# A hypothetical for-loop where I repeatedly add the array 'p' to the 
array 'Result'
for i in range(10):
     CalculatorX.Function = 'Result+p'    #( Result = Result + p)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The above script will not work in paraview as is.
Can anyone tell me the proper way of writing this in Python?

Thank you very much,
George

	and vtkImageData
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=h5jyCuX3DMfDnwRPYBvDVMsqQ32_u8TnFyvXy@mail.gmail.com>

I had a question about the nature of the underlying VTK data.

In my work I am often visualizing particle data, which I currently have in
XMDF files with Polyvertex topology.  When I load the files into PV, the
data ends up being represented by a vtkUnstructuredGrid.  What is the
difference between vtkUnstructuredGrid versus vtkPolyData?  I know that both
inherit from abstract vtkPointSet so they are generally fairly
interchangeable as most filters appear to require only a vtkPointSet.  Are
there any filters that would take one but not the other?

Also:

Some filters I am looking to use want a vtkPointSet input, but I have
vtkImageData (via XMDF 3DCoRectMesh topology).  What would be the best way
to make the conversion in Paraview?

Many thanks.

vtkUnstructuredGrid allows you to have 3D (volumetric) cells, where
vtkPolyData only allow a maximum of 2D (polygonal) cells.

vtkImageDataGeometryFilter does this, but I don't see an interface for it in PV.

Here is an example of how to use it:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/ImageData/ImageDataGeometryFilter

and here is how to make an existing VTK filter accessible in ParaView:

Good luck,

David

Hi George,

To execute a filter from python you can call UpdatePipeline().  This is just
like clicking the Apply button.  So for your code it would be
CalculatorX.UpdatePipeline().  But your loop isn't going to do what you
want.  Filters operate on their input data and output new data, they do not
modify their input data in place.  If you call the calculator filter 10
times, it's going to produce the same output each time unless its input has
changed.

Hi  Pat,

Thank you for the advice.
Is it therefore not possible to run the calculator filter inside a for 
loop? Or do I need to create an intermediate array (say ResultTemp) by 
deep copying the original Result array?

Thank you,
George

Ok - thanks. I'll give that a try.

If anybody can shed light on how XDMF topology types map onto VTK data types
within Paraview that would be great too.

You can run it in a loop, but I'm not sure it will accomplish what you are
trying to do. Your code says:

    CalculatorX.Function = 'Result+p'

But the input to the calculator filter only has the "p" array.  It's the
output of the calculator that has the "Result" array.  So you can call the
calculator filter a second time, but the input still won't have any "Result"
array.  You could apply a 2nd Calculator filter that operates on the output
of the first calculator filter.  You would apply a 2nd calculator filter by
calling Calculator() again.  You could use your for loop to apply a new
calculator filter each time.  But it's important that you understand
paraview's pipeline model, filters do not operate on their data in place.

Subject: [Paraview] Announcement: Self-contained Python module to write
	binary VTK files.
Message-ID: <FC975619-304E-43E4-A5DE-46A60CBA8048@gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

This is my first post to this list.

I would like to announce the first release of a Python module I wrote to export
scientific data to binary VTK files. The source code for the module can be
downloaded from its Mercurial repository at bitbucket. To get a copy, type on
terminal window:

hg clone https://pauloh at bitbucket.org/pauloh/pyevtk

PyEVTK (Python Export VTK) package allows exporting data to binary VTK files for
visualization and data analysis with any of the visualization packages that
support VTK files, e.g.  Paraview, VisIt and Mayavi. EVTK does not depend on any
external library (e.g. VTK), so it is easy to install in different systems.

The package is composed of a set of Python files and a small C/Cython library
that provides performance critical routines. PyEVTK provides low and high level
interfaces.  While the low level interface can be used to export data that is
stored in any type of container, the high level functions make easy to export
data stored in Numpy arrays. In addition, it provides a helper class to create
pvd files that can be imported into Paraview to visualize time dependent data
series.

PyEVTK is released under the GPL 3 open source license. A copy of the license is
included in the src directory.

Please see below for an example of how to use the high level routines. More examples
are included in the package.

I hope you will find this package useful and I look forward to getting your feedback.

Paulo

High-level interface example:
=============================

from evtk.hl import imageToVTK
import numpy as np

# Dimensions
nx, ny, nz = 6, 6, 2
ncells = nx * ny * nz
npoints = (nx + 1) * (ny + 1) * (nz + 1)

# Variables
pressure = np.random.rand(ncells).reshape( (nx, ny, nz), order = 'C')
temp = np.random.rand(npoints).reshape( (nx + 1, ny + 1, nz + 1))

imageToVTK("./image", cellData = {"pressure" : pressure}, pointData = {"temp" : temp} )

Subject: [Paraview] BUG in vtkPVDataSetAttributesInformation on Linux ?
Message-ID: <926966.39598.qm@web26106.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I use paraview 3.9.0 on a Centos 5 32 bits and also Windows XP.

Here' my problem. I have developed a plugin with temporal data and with windows 
XP it works. But under linux I have a crash of paraview during some time step 
change.
In Debug I have the following error message:

#else
  return  (  strcasecmp( thisArray.arrayName, thatArray.arrayName )  <=  0  )
          ?  true  :  false;
#endif
}

In linux it use:  (  strcasecmp( thisArray.arrayName, thatArray.arrayName )  <=  
0  ) an d when it crashed, the size of thisArray.arrayName.arrayName is 0 (and 
thatArrayName.arrayName is OK).

So what can it be bone to avoid this crash with Linux ?

Hi, Pat.

I am using the PV 381 Windows version with Vista Home Premium SP2 on a 
Toshiba Satellite X200 laptop with a Synaptics Touchpad. No mouse is 
connected and I did not use any Windows accessibility feature. The bug 
occurs both when I click on the left button of the touchpad or when I 
hit the touchpad to simulate a mouse click. This is not really a 
blocking bug, but it's just annoying because it rises the Output 
Messages window.

That check should be fixed. In any case, you should ensure that your
filter/reader names all arrays it produces. Unnamed arrays are not
recognized by ParaView.

Your're right !  I was so used to test my files that I had forgotten to set a 
name to one of my arrays.
Thanks !

Hi Nenad, Sorry for not replying, Utkarsh just pointed your email out to me.
Let me give this a try to see if I can recreate the problem.

My data were polydata although the vertices were organised as points instead
of 'real' polygones. After connecting these points through squares I was
able to apply the slice filter.

Thanks,

Thank You very much for Your help. It seems I made little mistake in
previous message - everything builds fine under Linux, there is a
problem only under Windows. I'm sorry for this mistake. Here is a list
of steps I make under Windows:

1. Download OpenMPI 1.4.3. (from www.open-mpi.org) and ParaView 3.8.1 sources
2. I recompile OpenMPI with standard options in release mode:
  - mkdir build, cd build, cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..,
open .sln file and build solution in Release mode
3. I create OpenMPI NSIS package (cpack -G NSIS --config
CPackConfig.cmake) and install it
4. I recompile ParaView sources with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS,
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI and PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON options turned on:
  - mkdir build, cd build, cmake-gui .., open .sln file and build
solution in Release mode
  - After the first configure, I set above 3 options, after the second
I update following options:
      + MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
??libmpi.lib;??libmpi_cxx.lib;??libopen-pal.lib;??libopen-rte.lib
          * instead of ?? is full path to .lib file
      + MPI_INCLUDE_PATH C:/Program Files/OpenMPI_v1.4.3-win32/include
      + MPI_LIBRARY C:/Program Files/OpenMPI_v1.4.3-win32/lib/libmpi_cxx.lib

I have Vista SP2, Visual Studio 2008 SP1 and Python 2.7 installed on
problematic machine. Tell me if You need more informations.

Best regards,
Nenad.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik83J8r76R-4wJ1HRpQtTEpK0DCb1Jiw-1Gg3_v@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

We will be branching ParaView and VTK for their respective releases soon
(probably this week). This is a heads up that finished features, bug fixes,
etc., that are a part of these releases should be merged in the coming days.
 Once the branches are created any further changes that need to be part of
the releases will need to be manually cherry-picked onto the release
branches.

Also, If anyone is responsible for failing tests on the dashboards we would
strongly encourage you to please take a look at them.

Thank you,

I have some XY data that I would like to plot in ParaView. I currently  
have a plugin that reads the data from our HDF5 file and into vtkTable  
objects. Along the lines of a "Line Chart 101" question how do I  
programmatically set the x-axis and y-axis columns?

Hi Mike,

I'm not up to speed with the current chart api so I can't answer your
question... but maybe you could try doing it in the gui with python trace
enabled, then translate the generated python code into c++ for your plugin?
Customizing the chart should be a matter of setting properties on the
representation and view, the data object itself doesn't have much say.

Thanks for the idea. I was trying to figure out the flow from reading  
the data into displaying the data hoping to reveal some sort of  
default or something. I was going to generate some fake CSV data and  
see how that reader does things hoping the CSV reader takes the first  
column as the x-axis.

There is a convenience function in the vtkPlot base class for this,

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPlot.html#ab2349981a5adb902a695e867ed15e1fc

You can set the table, along with the name of the x and y column for
the plot. The vtkPlotLine inherits from vtkPlotPoint, and both of them
respect this variable. It becomes a little murkier for parallel
coordinates, where I have to maintain a list of columns that should be
plotted.

Please let me know if it isn't clear, there are some tests such as
TestLinePlot.cxx that will take you through building up a table with
multiple columns, and plotting the points.

I think by default it will plot a line for each column in the table.  It
will use the cell value as the Y value, and the row index as the X value.
To change the behavior, you have to change two representation properties:


 rep.UseIndexForXAxis = 0

rep.XArrayName = 'foo'

This will plot all all the columns, except use the "foo" column as the X
values.  That means the line for the "foo" column is still displayed, and it
will be a diagonal line.

I just looked, and Paraview has one cheat hard coded- if there is a column
named "Time" or "arc_length" then it will be used automatically for the X
axis.

Sorry, yes, I was in VTK world. There are a few column names with
special meanings to ParaView that are hard coded in the proxy. You can
get at the chart object if you wish to manipulate it directly, but you
should be able to achieve everything you need to through the proxies.

Thanks for more info.

   I do in fact have "Time" for one of my plots so that is easy to  
achieve. I just had to correctly set the name of the column from "Time  
Values" to "Time" and that should work. The other plots probably are  
more difficult at this point. I have Stress/Strain data where I need  
the Stress on the x-axis and strain on the y-axis. I do not think I am  
understanding how to set some value on the vtkTable class that when  
finally passed over to the GUI layer will set the some arbitrary  
column as the x-axis. I thought the proxy stuff was all done on the  
GUI side of things? I guess I need just a bit more hand holding.

That's correct, the data objects at the vtk level cannot influence how the
chart will be displayed.  It all happens in the gui & servermanager level,
at the proxy level.  Are you at least able to see your data in the XY Line
Chart?  It only takes two clicks in the Display tab to assign the X axis.

It would be convenient if there was some way for the data object to provide
a hint to gui.  Maybe we could make a rule that if an array name ends with
"xaxis_hint" or something, that could clue the gui to use it automatically.

Yes, I can see the data in ParaView after I mess around digging in the  
"Display" tab, clicking some checkbox, taking guess about what needs  
to be enabled/disabled..
   I was hoping my use-case would fall into the "Default" use case  
where the first column represented the x-axis and subsequent columns  
were y-axis values but I guess not this time. Yes, I agree that it  
does only take a few clicks here and there but you first have to know  
_what_ to click which is where the user experience is falling apart  
for me. I have to teach a bunch of users to click here and there in  
order to show their data.
    Along those lines maybe I am not really understanding how a "Line  
Chart" works. Maybe what I am really after is an "XY Scatter Plot" of  
my data?
    What would help me out would be what source file is the default  
value of using the cell indices as the x-axis set? for my builds which  
I distribute to my users maybe I can just set this to the other value  
"Use Data Array" instead?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Proper Way to Include Plugins in ParaView 3.8 and beyond
Message-ID: <44D137E2-7FFB-4024-866F-50F86124101F@bluequartz.net>

I usually use PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE to add my plugins. Is  
this the "proper" way now? In looking through the ParaView cmake files  
I found the PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_FILE variable which seems to  
only take a single value (a file path). What happens if I have  
multiple plugins in multiple project directories to add? Or is there  
another way that I should be upgrading all my plugins to use? Wiki  
entry that I missed?

Thank

In the file PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_FILE points to you can just enumerate
all your plugins like so

paraview_build_optional_plugin(Plugin1 "My Plugin 1" "/some/source/dir" ON)
paraview_build_optional_plugin(Plugin2 "My Plugin 2"
"/some/other/source/dir" ON)

Lets try this again, from an even higher perspective:

I have several git repositories. Each one holds a plugin project for  
paraview. They are:

PVMXA
PVDislocation
PVOIM

The three projects are independent. Usually I would set  
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE to "PVMXA;PVOIM;PVDislocation" and run  
CMake. CMake would ask me for all the source directories for each  
"module" and things went as planned. With the  
PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_FILE which one of the repos would I store  
that in? (Rhetorical question..). I guess I can keep the same file in  
_each_ of the repos with instructions telling the user how to comment  
out what they don't need? Seems a bit odd to have to do it that way.  
Now, if PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_FILE would actually be  
PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_FILES (Note the plural) and I could assign  
multiple files to it then this would be much better. Again, Having  
been out of the ParaView plugin game for 9 months I may have missed  
something along then way.

Hopefully that is more clear in where I am getting confused.

Take a look at pqChartRepresentation::setDefaultPropertyValues().  See where
the x_array variable is assigned, and then the magic happens here:

  if (!x_array.isEmpty())
    {
    vtkSMPropertyHelper(proxy, "XArrayName").Set(x_array.toAscii().data());
    vtkSMPropertyHelper(proxy, "UseIndexForXAxis").Set(0);
    }

and then a little more magic a few lines later:

      else if (!x_array.isNull() && (array == x_array))
        {
        // No point in plotting the series used as the x-array.
        helper.SetStatus(array.toAscii().data(), 0);
        }


I totally agree with you that it would be nice if there was a way to make
this choice happen by default under the right conditions.

So in pqChartRepresentation::setDefaultPropertyValues() we have a pointer to
the vtkSMRepresentationProxy.  This object will have a proxy property named
"Input" which leads to a vtkSMSourceProxy pointer.  This will be the source
proxy for the vtk filter that is producing the table data.  Maybe we could
add a convention- if the source proxy has an information property named
something like "XAxisHint", then we'll use that to determine the default x
axis.  I'm not sure what to do with the "Time" and "arc_length" hard coded
values, maybe those would stay as-is.

You could try again with mesa 7.6.1, I know that version works.  I think
there was a problem with mesa since from that version through 7.8, but I
think it is fixed in mesa's current development source.  I thought the
problem manifested itself as a crash though, not a hang.  Hopefully someone
else will recognize your problem, I have never seen that before.

I just tried out the newly released 7.9 version last week and that one
worked fairly well for me. It appears to contain the fixes to make_current
that plagued 7.7/7.8.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.81 color legend multiple views
Message-ID: <4CF4C141.1020109@inria.fr>

I have two paraview file (PV1 and PV2). I split the screen and open PV1 
in the left screen and PV2 in the right screen. I make pressure 
surfaces. The two view are different and correct.
The problem: When I activate the color legends for PV1 and PV2, the 
scale is the same for both views even though the views are not linked. 
What I expected was two different legends corresponding to PV1 and PV2.

What am I doing incorrectly?
Thanks,
Stephen

Hello all, 

We will be branching ParaView and VTK for their respective releases soon
(probably this week). This is a heads up that finished features, bug fixes,
etc., that are a part of these releases should be merged in the coming days.
Once the branches are created any further changes that need to be part of
the releases will need to be manually cherry-picked onto the release
branches.

Also, If anyone is responsible for failing tests on the dashboards we would
strongly encourage you to please take a look at them.

Thank you,

Subject: [Paraview]  Saving integrated data on an animated slice
Message-ID: <4CF4F75D.9080806@onera.fr>

Hello everybody.

I am performing Surface flow integrations over the skin of an aircraft 
and I would like to see how the integration depends on the X coordinate 
with integrations from the nose of the aircraft to some X moving plane.

I am using the Surface Flow filter over a Clip object, and I have 
animated the X coordinate of the origin of the cutting plane in the Clip 
object. Using a spreadsheet view, I can see the value of the Surface 
Flow object changing with the X coordinate, but I don't know how to save 
the data of the Surface Flow object for all animations steps into a 
single csv file. I don't want to save the animated pictures, just the 
animated data into a single csv file for further computations with 
OpenOffice Calc.

I first tried to select the Surface Flow object then File->Save data, 
but even when I check the "Write all time steps" box of the "Configure 
Writer" dialog box that comes after the dialog box for the name of the 
file, all I can get in the csv file is the value for the last animation 
step.

Then I tried to select the SpreadSheet view and File->export into a csv 
file, but this gives the same result.

I believe that the Writer is expecting Time series, by my data (the 
aircraft skin) are not, and animations steps don't seem to be understood 
as Time steps. Of course, I can save data step by step, each step in a 
csv file, but does anyone know a trick to save data for all steps into a 
single csv file.

Best regards.

I think I like the multiple PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_FILES idea. To
avoid confusion for existing users of PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_FILE
variable, we can keep the variable name same, just accept multiple
values similar to PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE. Dave, can you make
that change?

Subject: [Paraview] combine vtk tables
Message-ID: <AANLkTinSLSO1Xty7DZJKGvdZRLXr+S=AM8-tvnR+z1V9@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

is it possible to combine vtk tables? I have two vtk-files with polydata
which i would like to combine into one file. Has paraview the option to do
that for me or do i have to do this manually?

My actual goal is to apply the slice-filter to a collection of individual
vtk-tables. However, what i found is that the filter will only be applied to
the highlighted vtk-table.

Can anybody point me in the right direction?

Cheers,
xian

Hi Xian,

You can apply the Append Geometry filter.  First, highlight all the polydata
datasets you want to combine.  Then go to the menu Filters -> Alphabetical
-> Append Geometry.

Thanks, John, but I don't know how to use this. Does it need some code 
writing?
I cannot compile PV and I was wondering if saving data from each step of 
an animated clip on static objects was possible with the last PV 381 
binaries. Is there any filter, or maybe Python script to do that? I 
tried to play the animation in a Python script and use CreateWriter as 
found on a Wiki page, but it does not work (CreateWriter seems to be for 
future PV 3.9).

I have found a workaround if it may help: when you click on a menu item 
and you don't select any option in its list, click again on the same 
item to remove its options list, and you can move over other menu items 
without error message.

Hi Stephen,

I get the same incorrect/linked behavior for 3.8.1.  I tried it out and this
has been fixed in the development version.  The 3.10 release candidate
should be ready in a week or two and this fix ought to be in that.

Thanks, Adriano.

This seems to be a very good idea. I could attach a Programmable Filter 
script after my "Surface flow" filter.
My script should first create the data file with an "append" status so 
that it would not be overwritten at each animation step, then it should 
output the "Surface Flow" point value at each step. So maybe two 
Programmable Filter scripts? The first one before the animated Clip 
filter to create the output file, the second after the Surface flow 
filter. Maybe a pipeline like that:

- Programmable Filter 1 : Creates the output file with "append" status. 
Should execute once!
- Animated Clip : X coordinate of the cutting plane origin is animated.
- Surface Flow filter: performs integrations and gives a "Surface Flow" 
point value.
- Programmable Filter 2: write the "Surface Flow" value. Should execute 
at each animation step.

I will try to do that, but I am not very easy with Python, so if someone 
can help me to write these two scripts, thanks in advance.

Richard.

That behavior is not incorrect.  ParaView is supposed to synchronize the color map of all fields with the same name regardless of which pipeline object the data comes from or what view they are in.  This is an important feature that prevents confusion when interpreting field values and also avoids the headache of having to change the colors of the same field over and over again.

If the development version allows you to declare different color maps for the same variable, then that is a bug and should be fixed before the 3.10 release.  However, I tried both 3.8.1 and the development build from last night and it appears that the color map is synchronizing just fine (although you usually have to force a render in other views to update to changes in the color map).

Richard,

I don't thionk you'll need the first programmable filter. The following
should be a start:

vtkUnsData = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
fout = open(filename,'a')
#then you can use the write function to write data to file ie
fout.write("%s" % (vtkUnsData.GetPointData().GetTuple1(0))
fout.close()

I've never used Surface Flow so don't know what type of data-set you will be
working with.

Good luck!

Subject: [Paraview] paraviewweb: separate pipeline control from rendering
	client
Message-ID: <149805.60124.qm@web121508.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Dear all,
the paraview web visualization looks like the perfect solution for our software 
training sessions. I would like to ask whether it is possible to use it in an 
even more suitable way for teacher - student scenarios.

The idea is to have the complete Paraviewweb functionality (setup data sources 
and visualization pipeline, as well as a rendering view) available in the 
teacher's web browser. The students should receive only the rendering view with 
the possibility to navigate in 3D, but not to modify the pipeline. (Ideally each 
student should be able to take over navigation if nobody else is active. But it 
is also sufficient if a single student workplace is prioritized to allow 
interaction.)

I am looking for an example that separates the pipeline controls from the render 
view into two different web pages. Is this possible, or is the render view 
always tied to the control widgets?

Thank you
Vlad

Subject: [Paraview] How to clip an image according to a surface?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Zwrp0Hnt0oL=3hD4R-N9tpve1MarGykSodM7C@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
I use paraview 3.8.1 to visualize geophysical data. My data are arranged
as an unstructured grid of cell data. This gives an image of resistivity
(the colour value) in 3 dimensions.
I also have another image giving the maximum depth to which I can trust
the previous data. This is a polydata dataset of point data, where the
points are simply the depths.

Is it possible to clip or threshold my original image (the unstructured
grid) according to the depths given in the polydata?  I.e cut away any
data in the original image that is below xx depth, where xx is given in
the polydata surface?

Thanks

You can use the Resample With Dataset filter to apply the field values of the unstructured grid to the surface of the poly data.  It is roughly equivalent to intersecting the unstructured grid with the surface.

Hi
Thanks, but this simply colours the polydata surface with the values of the
unstructured grid. I want to cut all the data in the unstructured grid that
lies below the polydata, but keep all the cells that lie above, not just
extract the polydata surface

Hi Vlad,

ParaViewWeb as a framework has all the capabilities that you need and
want. The only thing right now, is that the provided web applications
are made for demonstration purpose and might not fully fit your
expectations.

But it is true and fairly simple to have one application for the
teacher and one application for the students.
For the code example, if you managed to install and deploy ParaViewWeb
on one of your computer, you can look at some of our examples.
In fact, in the Administration page of the PWService, you are able to
view the content of a running session, which is typically what you
want for the student application. Therefore, you will just need to
make a standalone application based on that web page.

For your information, here is the content of that page, where I
removed the unnecessary part...

<html>
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/ParaViewWeb.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="page">

            <div id="web-renderer">
                <!-- Try the javascrip rendering here -->
            </div>

        </div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            var serverUrl =
'http://paraviewweb.kitware.com:80/PWService';// MUST BE CHANGED
            var sessionId = '4063255';
                     // MUST BE CHANGED

            var paraview = new Paraview(serverUrl);
            paraview.connectToSession(sessionId);
            var viewId = paraview.CreateIfNeededRenderView().__selfid__;

            var renderer = new JavaScriptRenderer("renderer", serverUrl);
            renderer.init(sessionId, viewId);
            renderer.bindToElementId("web-renderer");
            renderer.setSize('400','400');
            renderer.start();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

And we are working to make ParaView itself compatible with
collaboration workflow so ideally the teacher will be able to use
ParaView desktop and the student could go to a web page in order to
share the rendering with the teacher.

Thanks for your interest,

Seb

Hi Ken,

If that is the desired behavior then there is a bug.  You can see from the
attached image that I'm getting that behavior.  This happens when I rescale
the data range in one window.  When I change the active view though it
updates properly so that the legends are again in sync.  This out-of-sync
behavior doesn't happen in 3.8.1 but does happen in my development version.

Stephen, I didn't notice before that it synced when the view was changed so
my information was incorrect.  To get around this behavior though you can
use the calculator filter to create a second copy of the array with a
different name and then create unsynced legends.

I'll file a bug report.

Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Extract cells by region and colors
Message-ID: <AANLkTikt3g_Mh49ZjY=3wq_rFPDpg9VKe+awiy8ECmBy@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I use Paraview to open a VTK ASCII tetrahedral unstructured grid file which
has color scalars assigned per cell (tetrahedron). Everything is correct so
far: I am able to see the different colors on the surface of the
unstructured grid. That is, the boundary triangles are colored as they ought
to be according to the scalars of the file.

The problem occurs when I apply the Extract cells by region filter. The
different colors disappear and only one color is displayed for all cells. Is
there a way to preserve the different colors per cell after the filter is
applied?

Regards,
Panagiotis Foteinos

I have tried setting the log level to ERROR and WARNING and I get the
same output. If I set it on INFO or DEBUG it gives me some error about
not able to initialize pw-logger but I only see half of that error
message and I can not focus the window and copy paste it from. Also,
sometimes I can not close the tab in firefox and I even managed to
crash internet explorer with PWApp.

I also tried the connect to a pvserver that is running locally by
typing the adress in the PWApp login screen but the pvserver didn't
register any connection attempt being made. But if I start
PWServer.exe with command-line arguments to connect it to a remote
server it works. I also tried uploading datasets with PWApp, they do
appear in the workdir/data folder but nothing is displayed still.

Cheers,
Pjotr
