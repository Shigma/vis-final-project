Hi Colin,

I am not sure about the configuration in Mac OS X, but in Linux I can
access to the paraview python interface from the "system wide" python
with the following setting of PYTHONPATH:

/opt/Paraview-3.10.1/bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages:/opt/Paraview-3.10.1/bin/bin

hope it helps.

Bests,

Alessandro

HI,

I would descripe a h5 file with a array of compound types or array of 
array[3].
h5dump -H h5array_0_0_0.h5 create the follow output:

          DATASET "e_global_cell_pos" {
             DATATYPE  H5T_ARRAY { [3] H5T_STD_I32LE }
             DATASPACE  SIMPLE { ( 434176 ) / ( 434176 ) }
          }
          DATASET "e_momentum" {
             DATATYPE  H5T_COMPOUND {
                H5T_IEEE_F32LE "x";
                H5T_IEEE_F32LE "y";
                H5T_IEEE_F32LE "z";
             }
             DATASPACE  SIMPLE { ( 434176 ) / ( 434176 ) }
          }

I search for a way to descripe with xdmf to read in e_momentum or 
e_global_cell_pos.
I have test:

<Grid Name="Domain 1x1x1">
<Topology TopologyType="Polyvertex" NumberOfElements = "434176">
</Topology>
<Geometry GeometryType="XYZ">
<DataItem  Dimensions="434176"  NumberType="Int" Precision="4"

</Grid>

and

<Grid Name="Domain 1x1x1">
<Topology TopologyType="Polyvertex"  NumberOfElements = "434176">

Hello,

It looks like there is something not working with your 3D video card.
Make sure you have the 3D acceleration enabled on your video card.

Dear all,

sorry for warming up this older bug report; but I just tried out version 3.12 RC2, and I found that the bug (at least I believe it is one) is still present. As the problem is really being very important for my work, but presumably also for many others, I am taking the opportunity to bring it up once more.

The issue is as follows:
If I load a rectilinear grid, and then plot isosurfaces of the data with a certain "color by" turned on, I am experiencing that the colouring is not done correctly depending on the number of MPI processes paraview/pvserver is running on. Let me illustrate that with a simple example:

The pipeline is simply reading data (for instance RectGrid2.vtk from the examples), then applying the Elevation filter to get a second scalar to do the colouring; in the example we just use elevation along the x axis. Then, we plot a bunch of isosurfaces to illustrate the problem:
1) one isosurface for the actual data (scalars), coloured by elevation. This gives a repeated colour pattern as shown in the screenshot:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/Screenshot.png and http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpi_2.png 
The correct colour of course would be one single sequence starting from blue to red as the elevation gradually changes without jumping. This is shown in another screenshot, obtained with one single MPI processor:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpi_1.png: All is ok.
For instance running on 10 processors, we get an even more strange picture: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpi_10.png

It appears to me that the data structure that is use to colour the isosurfaces is not properly recomputed on each processor, but rather computed on one, and then used on all the others, although their own data would require different data.

There are a few workarounds, see below, however they are not practical as both the memory footprint is increased considerably, but also the quality of the rendering is very poor when going to unstructured grids.

The background of the issue is that I am intending to visualise large data sets and plot isosurfaces of say vorticity which is then coloured by a velocity component. Due to the size of the dataset I would like to use parallel visualisation, instead of just running serially on very fat nodes. I believe that such a visualisation technique is quite common in our area, which makes me think that the present bug is quite important. 

Of course I would be happy to provide more information (e.g. the state file: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpitest.pvsm), or also fill in an official bug report if this helps.

Thanks!
The "Compute Normals" is checked in the contour filter after the CleanToGrid filter, however the Gouraud shading does not work. But using an additional "Generate Surface Normals" then does the trick, at least partially. The contours look nicer than without Gouraud shading, obviously, but the best result (and also the cheapest one, I will use it on large data sets) would still be obtained when directly doing a contour on the original rectilinear data without transforming it to unstructured.

Thus, I was wondering whether I should submit the present case also as a bug report, as I guess also other people might need coloured isosurfaces when running MPI?

Best regards,
Philipp

Subject: [Paraview] PYTHONPATH for prebuilt MAC OSX Paraview

The 'paraview' directory is the module.  Python treats directories that
contain a __init__.py file as modules.  So you want your python path to
contain "/Applications/ParaView 3.10.1.app/Contents/Python", and drop the
/paraview ending.

But, I recommend you use pvpython instead of python.  The paraview python
modules may not be compatible with your system python.  Using pvpython also
ensures that all paths are set correctly, so you don't need to set
PYTHONPATH.  You can find pvpython at:

  /Applications/ParaView\ 3.10.1.app/Contents/bin/pvpython

If you want to try system python, you need to:

export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/ParaView\
3.10.1.app/Contents/Python:/Applications/ParaView\
3.10.1.app/Contents/Libraries
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/ParaView\
3.10.1.app/Contents/Libraries

I'm not sure it will work for you though.  On my system, python aborts when
the modules are loaded.

Philip,

Great bug report. I also had trouble with replicated colours when using rectilinear grid but due to time constraints didn't have time to track down the problem. In my case I was able to switch to ImageData since my grids were regular at the time and the problem went away. However with your detailed post I'll have another crack at locating the problem. My own suspicion was that the contouring and everything works fine, the scalars are actually correct, but somewhere in the mpi collection of the results, something gets gathered up wrongly. It seemed to me that the extent handling / piece requests for rectilinear grids was somehow broken -

[pause for 5 minutes]

Loading the rect2.vtk dataset and following your example I see the problem, but I also see that if you add a process ID filter and then open a spreadsheet view, you can see the original elevation values are correctly computed (as we'd expect), but then looking at the contour filter and seeing the values of elevation matched to processId and they're clearly wrong (in the spreadsheet you can select the points with zero elevation and they're visibly in the wrong place). 

I'll pursue this further .....

JB

Subject: Re: [Paraview] FW: FW: Coloured isosurfaces when running MPI

Dear all,

sorry for warming up this older bug report; but I just tried out version 3.12 RC2, and I found that the bug (at least I believe it is one) is still present. As the problem is really being very important for my work, but presumably also for many others, I am taking the opportunity to bring it up once more.

The issue is as follows:
If I load a rectilinear grid, and then plot isosurfaces of the data with a certain "color by" turned on, I am experiencing that the colouring is not done correctly depending on the number of MPI processes paraview/pvserver is running on. Let me illustrate that with a simple example:

The pipeline is simply reading data (for instance RectGrid2.vtk from the examples), then applying the Elevation filter to get a second scalar to do the colouring; in the example we just use elevation along the x axis. Then, we plot a bunch of isosurfaces to illustrate the problem:
1) one isosurface for the actual data (scalars), coloured by elevation. This gives a repeated colour pattern as shown in the screenshot:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/Screenshot.png and http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpi_2.png 
The correct colour of course would be one single sequence starting from blue to red as the elevation gradually changes without jumping. This is shown in another screenshot, obtained with one single MPI processor:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpi_1.png: All is ok.
For instance running on 10 processors, we get an even more strange picture: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpi_10.png

It appears to me that the data structure that is use to colour the isosurfaces is not properly recomputed on each processor, but rather computed on one, and then used on all the others, although their own data would require different data.

There are a few workarounds, see below, however they are not practical as both the memory footprint is increased considerably, but also the quality of the rendering is very poor when going to unstructured grids.

The background of the issue is that I am intending to visualise large data sets and plot isosurfaces of say vorticity which is then coloured by a velocity component. Due to the size of the dataset I would like to use parallel visualisation, instead of just running serially on very fat nodes. I believe that such a visualisation technique is quite common in our area, which makes me think that the present bug is quite important. 

Of course I would be happy to provide more information (e.g. the state file: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39264314/paraview/mpitest.pvsm), or also fill in an official bug report if this helps.

Best regards,

Thanks!
The "Compute Normals" is checked in the contour filter after the CleanToGrid filter, however the Gouraud shading does not work. But using an additional "Generate Surface Normals" then does the trick, at least partially. The contours look nicer than without Gouraud shading, obviously, but the best result (and also the cheapest one, I will use it on large data sets) would still be obtained when directly doing a contour on the original rectilinear data without transforming it to unstructured.

Thus, I was wondering whether I should submit the present case also as a bug report, as I guess also other people might need coloured isosurfaces when running MPI?

Best regards,
Philipp

Dear Users,

I am facing problem while rendering images/animation.

i found the information about openGL rendering
what does the following lines mean?

is it  possible/not to render the images in my sys?

[naveen at localhost ~]$ glxinfo | grep rende

is their any thing i need to install to overcome this problem?

plz help me.

thanking you

Message-ID: <CAEGkFz8LmwyHjiRMkqNc+f_C_a8wHgV-7Gr+43vWkZWk3wq80A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I used the codes following to get the mapper of a volume actor, but I get
NULL while *volume *is not NULL.

*  vtkAbstractMapper3D *mapper = NULL;
  if ( (volume = vtkVolume::SafeDownCast(propCandidate)) != NULL )
    mapper = volume->GetMapper();
*
Why? Thanks for any advice!

Best wishes!

Subject: [Paraview] problem with python script generated by trace for simple
	plot
Message-ID: <CADbE-6BspQzmHk_ubg9a4xLg3m3gTh48ib9V8LDGpR6WRcj_ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a simple data (stress tensor) and I want to draw Txx, Txy on a line
with a script and save it in
a PNG file. (since I should repeat it many times...)

Used the trace functionality and generated a script. But the result of
running script is totally different
from what I get with doing it in interactive mode.

In the output of script lines for all possible variables are visible but I
only want two of them (tensor(0) and tensor(1))
as you can see in the attached files.

Can anyone help me what's going wrong here?

Thanks,
Ali

If you edit the script and move the WriteImage() call to the very end, it
will work if you run the script form the python console in the paraview
gui.  Is the script you posted exactly what was generated, or did you move
the WriteImage() while trying to debug it?  Also, you're right that it
doesn't work correctly if you run it from pvpython.  Unfortunately there are
some bugs with replaying scripts that generate plots, and we're trying to
fix them soon.  At least one bug report that I know about is:

Unfortunatley, no.  Paraview can be compiled in a mode to do software
rendering which does not require windows, but the paraview releases don't
have this ability.  If you're concerned about speed, it would be more
efficient if you modified the python script so that it looped over the files
in the same run, instead of having to start up and shut down each time, and
it could re-used the same window.

Thank you very much Andy,
with your precious help I have been able to find out a working solution for
what I need.

I foud out the the original script is completly functional without any
modification....
the only BIG ISSUE was the the Paraview binaries provided by the Ubuntu
Repositories
do not provide all the needed python scripts for the execution of a perfect
python environment
in Paraview. I would like to notify this to the mantainers of the repos.
So, the workaround was this easy! I just installed Paraview from the latest
source and got
the thing running.

However I found another problem relatet of course to the execution of the
pipeline due to
the missing active source, just as you suggested in you mail. That was
easier to solve.
So I ended up with a working script I want to share with all those people
that may need it.
I'll send an heavily commented version with a dedicated email. Here is a
snippet just to let you
see how i did.
Thank you very much for your time!

Luca

------------------ CODE-------------------

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

fotobioreattore_foam = FindSource("fotobioreattore.foam")
SetActiveSource(fotobioreattore_foam)

PlotOverLine2 = PlotOverLine( Source="High Resolution Line Source" )
DataRepresentation7 = Show()

PlotOverLine2.Source.Point1 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
PlotOverLine2.Source.Point2 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.43]

Render()

source = PlotOverLine2
writer = CreateWriter("YOUR_FILE_NAME_GOES_HERE.csv", source)
writer.FieldAssociation = "Points" # or "Cells"
writer.UpdatePipeline()
del writer

Subject: [Paraview] How to execute the Plot Over Line with a Python script
	and export to CSV
Message-ID: <CAAg8wy-P95zu0eoxtq98TKbFV=2cq5GBY2j9_pA=3mejqaE1hQ@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy.

I have been looking through the Internet to find a solution for how to have
the Plot over line
executed automatically through a Python script. I was able to find some
sources here on the
Paraview mailing list but nobody reporting a fully functional script (at
list for my case).
So I will share what I wrote to help those people that will surely come up
with the same problems
I had. What does the script do:

- execute a PlotOverLine filter
- export the results in a CSV file
- execute a subsequent second filter directly after the first
- export this to a separate file

I know it may sound an easy job and I know it is not by any means a
"perfect" solution.... but
the code is heavily commented so I think it can surely work well as the base
for further
development for other people.

Good work.

Luca

# First of all, I created this script because I needed to execute the
probing with

simulation with

# This is such a dumb script that you can of course modify it as you like to
suit your needs!
# That's Open Source...!
#
# @@ IMPORTANT NOTICE @@
#
# If you are running Paraview using the binaries provided by the Ubuntu
repos, it is
# very likely that you don't have full python support due to the lack of
some functions
# here and there in the provided installation.
# THUS, THIS SCRIPT WON'T RUN!!
# The obvious work around is to uninstall the Ubuntu version and build from
source the
# last stable. This was tested using Ubuntu 11.04 and Paraview 3.8.0 32bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's first identify the source to which we want to execute the P-O-L on:

change

in

#
# my_case = FindSource("THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_CASE_GOES_HERE")
fotobioreattore_foam = FindSource("fotobioreattore.foam")

# Now set the source you just defined, as the active one so that the P-O-L
filter
# will be executed on that without need of any other definition. Example:
#
# SetActiveSource(my_case)

# Create the first P-O-L, set the extremes of the line and then commit to
render

PlotOverLine2.Source.Point2 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.43]

# This will calculate all the values for all the fileds along the line.
# I was not able to identify how to show only the needed parameters.
# However, it is trivial to run all the files through an "awk" command

Or, even if it's not possible to control which window ("Output Window"

predict which one will do the displaying?

Thanks.

It will probably be the one which has the focus, I guess.

Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F6815CE8A1E@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

Hello List

I am checking my private plugins, (compiled, and tested successfully under 3.10) under the RC2 for v3.12. Configuration, compilation show no warnings or errors. When loading manually, paraview crashes with the following message:

Plugin's signature: paraviewplugin|GNU|3.12
Plugin signature verification successful.
Now loading components from the plugin instance based on the interfaces it implements.

Warning: In /apps/eiger/src/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/vtkSMProxyManager.cxx, line 327
vtkSMProxyManager (0xd70080): Creation of new proxy vtkSMFileSeriesReaderProxy failed (sources, GPReader).

Segmentation fault

The question is:  Has anything changed with respect to FileSeries and the xml definitions?

I use this:

 <ProxyGroup name="internal_sources">
  <SourceProxy name="PhysicsReader">
  </SourceProxy>
 </ProxyGroup>

 <ProxyGroup name="sources">
   <FileSeriesReaderProxy name="GPReader"
                          class="vtkFileSeriesReader">
      <SubProxy>
        <Proxy name="Reader"
          proxygroup="internal_sources" proxyname="PhysicsReader">
        </Proxy>
      </SubProxy>
 </ProxyGroup>

the makefile generation of RC2 actually gave me an error, but make and make install worked fine. The error was:
 CMake Error: INSTALL(EXPORT) given unknown export "IceTTargets"

can this be related? I doubt...

Thanks for any tip. I use 3.12.0-RC2-4-ge9de676

Hi Jean,

Yes we did some changes regarding the proxy definitions. We don't need
any more specific proxy code regarding the file serie reader.
To fix your XML, you should write it as follow:

<ProxyGroup name="sources">
 ? <SourceProxy name="GPReader"
                         si_class="vtkSIFileSeriesReaderProxy"
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?class="vtkFileSeriesReader"
                         file_name_method="SetFileName">
 ? ? ?<SubProxy>
 ? ? ? ?<Proxy name="Reader"
 ? ? ? ? ?proxygroup="internal_sources" proxyname="PhysicsReader">
 ? ? ? ?</Proxy>
 ? ? ?</SubProxy>
 ?</ProxyGroup>

Let us know either way if it did solve your issue or solved it.

Thanks,

Seb

PS: You can check the current definitions for readers that are in the
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/readers.xml if you want
to.

>I don't think I understand what you're trying to do here. Can you elaborate?

This should give a better idea:
I would end up having two representations for the plugin: 1) inherits from vtkGeometryRepresentation and 2) inherits from vtkXYChartRepresentation. My reader's output would be in the form of a vtkMultiBlockDataSet which would hold information for both representations (polydatas for representation 1 and vtktables for representation 2) The same vtkMultiBlockDataSet would be passed to each representation where the representation would control what would be sent to the view. For 1, the tables would be ignored and for 2, the polydatas would be ignored.

The problem I have run into:
I'm not sure how I can set up the XML so that I can select the Representation in the GUI. (Or if I should even be trying to do this)

[code]
 <ProxyGroup name="representations">
        <!-- 3d representation -->
        <RepresentationProxy name="MyFirstRepresentation"
            class="vtkMyFirstRepresentation"
            processes="client|renderserver|dataserver"
            base_proxygroup="representations"
            base_proxyname="SurfaceRepresentation">
        </RepresentationProxy>
        <Extension name="GeometryRepresentation">
            <RepresentationType subproxy="MyFirstRepresentation"
                text="My Rep" subtype="Surface" />
            <SubProxy>
                <Proxy name="MyFirstRepresentation"
                    proxygroup="representations" 
                    proxyname="MyFirstRepresentation">
                </Proxy>
                <ShareProperties subproxy="SurfaceRepresentation">
                    <Exception name="Input" />
                    <Exception name="Visibility" />
                    <Exception name="Representation" />
                </ShareProperties>
                <ExposedProperties>
                </ExposedProperties>
            </SubProxy>
        </Extension>

        <!-- Statistical Representation -->
        <RepresentationProxy name="MyStatisticRepresentation"
            class="vtkMyStatisticRepresentation"
            processes="client|renderserver|dataserver"
            base_proxygroup="representations"
            base_proxyname="XYChartRepresentation">
        </RepresentationProxy>

        <Extension name="????">
            <RepresentationType subproxy="MyStatisticRepresentation"
                text="My Stat Rep" subtype="?????" />
             ...
        </Extension>
    </ProxyGroup>
[/code]

If there are any other ways to do this, I would be interested in looking into them.

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

Although ParaView does support defining default view type in XML,
currently it's only support for filters with 1 output port. Feel free
to add a feature request to the bug tracker and we can try to address
it soon.

I don't think I understand what you're trying to do here. Can you elaborate?

I'm glad it's working for you.

I'm not sure who is responsible for building the paraview binaries for the
ubuntu repos.  I know some maintainers have contacted us in the past about
properly doing this for certain installations and we are more than happy to
help.  If you have the energy to contact the people for ubuntu we can help
get it properly done.

Hi Jean,

Yes we did some changes regarding the proxy definitions.

          proxygroup="internal_sources" proxyname="PhysicsReader">

Thanks. That did the trick. I corrected one more line from what you sent me:

          proxygroup="sources" proxyname="PhysicsReader">

Things are now running smoothly.

Subject: [Paraview] Cube Axes labels problems in current ParaView sources
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQsphzWUoDMtP0yDmhA+NO7Uk+5_Nko6XewPu910J=MBtg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have problems with Cube Axes labels in ParaView v3.10.1 (and SVN
sources). I load file with terrain mesh, turn on "Show Cube Axes" (on
Display tab of Object Inspector) and everything is displayed great.
However, if I scale (either using transformation controls on display
tab or with Transform Filter) along Z axis, Z axis labels will be
scaled too (numerically)! In this way labels (in my case elevation)
will be incorrect. Is this correct behavior? Also, in "Edit Cube Axes
Properties" dialog, when I select "Custom Bounds", again both axes and
axes labels are changed.

I looked at vtkCubeAxesActor.cxx and it seems it generates entire axes
mesh (both axes/ticks and labels) from previously calculated
boundaries. Can anyone suggest some easy way to patch it, so only axes
/ ticks are scaled (i.e. without multiplying labels values)?

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,
Nenad.

I can have a look at it but it may take one or two days before I get
to it.  How soon you need this?

Thank You very much for Your response! I'm not in big rush, so it can
wait few days.

Subject: [Paraview] cannot link Plugin based on Paraview 3.10.1 using Qt
 4.7.4 on Mac OS OX 10.6.8 | gcc 4.2.1 | Xcode 4.0 | CMake 2.8-2 (x86_64 is
 on)
Message-ID: <CAA7soDWVL_pMRxOPGHCgOF2zjKau8yRKQ5MZ2uP_ubDDw26y9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

i am working on a Paraview Plugin that adds a new Qt progress bar type to
the standard ParaView toolbar. I try to build the plugin as a stand-alone,
that is the plugin is not included in Paraview build but out of source. Note
that the plugin builds and works fine on linux x86_64 (load/unload at
runtime).

I ?ve included /Developer/Tools/Qt to my PATH for Qt/Paraview binaries and
included the libraries i need in LD_LIBRARY_PATH | DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (
LIBRARY_PATH is
blank, not sure if i have to care about this). While trying to link the
plug-in with a makefile i get:

Linking CXX shared library libZeo.dylib
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64: ?typeinfo for
pqPVAnimationWidget?, referenced from: pqZeo::GetTimeSteps() in pqZeo.cpp.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64

Now, pqPVAnimationWidget is related to ParaView, but i believe that
QList<double> pqZeo::GetTimeSteps() {?}
makes it relevant to mention the issue here.

The first idea (although irrelevant i am afraid) is to configure the
CMakeCache file

//Build architectures for OSX
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=x86_64

I switched to Qt 4.7.4, qmake query outputs:
QT_INSTALL_PREFIX:/
QT_INSTALL_DATA:/usr/local/Qt4.7
QT_INSTALL_DOCS:/Developer/Documentation/Qt
QT_INSTALL_HEADERS:/usr/include
QT_INSTALL_LIBS:/Library/Frameworks
QT_INSTALL_BINS:/Developer/Tools/Qt
QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS:/Developer/Applications/Qt/plugins
QT_INSTALL_IMPORTS:/Developer/Applications/Qt/imports
QT_INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS:/Developer/Applications/Qt/translations
QT_INSTALL_CONFIGURATION:/Library/Preferences/Qt
QT_INSTALL_EXAMPLES:/Developer/Examples/Qt/
QT_INSTALL_DEMOS:/Developer/Examples/Qt/Demos
QMAKE_MKSPECS:/usr/local/Qt4.7/mkspecs
QMAKE_VERSION:2.01a
QT_VERSION:4.7.4

I don't think there is sth wrong with my Qt installation.

   - I can only build Paraview 3.10.1 and my plug-in with Xcode 4.0 (instead
   of makefiles i used before) only if i leave BUILT_SHARED_LIBS off, which is
   of no practical merit since the plugin is static (*.a) and cannot be loaded
   to Paraview. When i switch BUILT_SHARED_LIBS to on though, i get the exact
   same message i was getting before (failure while linking)


*Linking CXX shared library libZ.dylib*
*Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:*
*  "typeinfo for pqPVAnimationWidget", referenced from:*
*      pqZ::GetTimeSteps()       in pqZ.cpp.o*
*ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64*
*
*

   - When I am trying to build the Paraview 3.12.0-RC2 version, i cannot
   even build the ParaView.xcodeproj. Cmake GUI 2.8-2 gives me:

Could NOT find
/Users/nikos/Documents/codin_SRC/test/paraview/Paraview_3.12.0/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2/CMake/.paraview.version
which is mandatory if Git is not found either.

CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewDetermineVersion.cmake:68 (message):
  Failed to determine source version correctly.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:70 (determine_version)

If i manually configure the CMakeLists.txt (which is a bad idea) the
procedure hangs to CMakeLists.txt:70 (determine_version) again.


   - When I am trying to build the git version on Xcode, leaving aside the
   vtk warnings like in tif_unix,c "cast to pointer from integer of different
   size,

it builds only a few dylibs and *not* ParaView.app. When i run it it hangs
to the tests below that i successfully pass

(  0. TestArraySerialization

  1. TestArrayDenormalized )

Has anyone successfully built PV (3.10.1 or RC or the git version) and her
own plugins with Xcode 4.0?
Let me know if you have any hints, cheers

Hello,

I have a question about the source distribution of 3.12.0 RC-2.   I understand from a message from Utkarsh back in August that the way that version numbers are determined has changed, and now requires a call to "git describe".  After downloading the source tarball from http://paraview.org/files/v3.12/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2.tar.gz, my attempt to build failed, apparently while attempting to call git describe.  So, my question is, will git now become a dependency for building release versions of ParaView?  Or is this call currently still in there because this is still just a release candidate, and not yet an official release?

Thanks,
joe.

I Joe, can you redownload the tarball. I forgot to include the version file
in the tarball which the version calculation code uses when there isn't a
git repository. If it still doesn't work let me know. Thanks!

My plugin builds OK if i choose a static library, but of course i cannot
load it into PV.
Can anyone decipher the message below when i choose to build a shared lib,
that is *.dylib?
Thanks

Paraview 3.10.1 using Qt 4.7.4 on Mac OS OX 10.6.8 | gcc 4.2.1 | CMake 2.8-2

Hi,

If I were to write a typical VTK filter C++ (i.e. the type with VTKRequestData, not existing in the VTK/Rendering folder), would it be fine to have OpenGL calls in there?? I'm guessing based on the way VTK is designed, most classes that access OpenGL directly might exist in the Rendering folder.? This is more of a design question anyway and relates to how to VTK classes are designed.

My class will add data structures to the pipeline but it may need a fragment shader for computations.

Sohail

Thanks, Pierre.

Would you have any idea how to set the focus from python?

Thanks.

I will try to contact the Ubuntu folks and point them the problem.... I
think that it will probably be up to them to decide whether they do really
need to update the package or not. However, thanks to this mailing list, a
small trace of this bug will remain; in this way, people seeking for help
will know that the only thing that needs to be done is to recompile the
official Paraview sources.

Keep up the good Job!
Regards

Luca

Subject: [Paraview] confused with getting nan values in plot over line
Message-ID: <CADbE-6CPNKB9RCBoMAuaBHLu3nk305V04qNktH7zc4wH==oKQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a tensor field (stress) which I like to draw it on a line in the
middle of the domain.
When I use the "Plot over line" filter I get "nan" values.

You can see them as points far away from the borders of plot (screenshot
attached). Also
when I do a "save data" and write points to a csv file I can see the nan
values in the resulting
file(again attached).

My field does not contain any nan values and I'm confused how they are
coming...

I would appreciate if anyone can give me some idea on this behavior.

Thanks,
Ali

Hi,

Actually the borders are ok and I get these nan values for points in the
middle of my domain.
And this is why I do not have an idea where these nans are coming from.

Regards,
Ali

Hi,

There is an incorrect insertion of polyhedral cell in vtkAppendFilter
that causes ParaView to crash, which I filed as a VTK bug with a
proposed patch (attached in this mail as well) as follows. I hope the
fix is included in the PV 3.12 release.

Are you hoping that this will make its way into the main VTK repo or is this
personal code that you plan on maintaining yourself and plan on linking with
VTK?

There are people that know more about this than me but this sounds like a
bad idea for the main VTK repo.  A lot of the OpenGL specific calls are
hidden by factories which create them as needed.  For example, you'd create
a vtkPolyDataMapper and the factory would create the
vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper, vtkMesaPolyDataMapper, etc as needed by the build.

I switched to a .pro file and qmake for building the plugin.

qmake -project outputs a src_qmake.pbproj file that i rename to
src_qmake.xcodeproj.

I cannot launch src_qmake.xcodeproj, it complains about incompatible project
version.


any mac PV users/developers out there? thanks

It looks like from the initial linker error that some function is NOT included in the 64 bit compile of ParaView? Are you compiling everything or using your own versions of libZ?

This is personal code, by maybe one day I will contribute it to VTK, as like a plugin or something....

There are pieces of code that special things that do access OpenGL directly however, like the LIC code.? But I could do things another way...I so see classes related to shaders (vtkShader) and setting up the view volume (vtkPersp*), so those classes may come in handy....

Are you hoping that this will make its way into the main VTK repo or is this personal code that you plan on maintaining yourself and plan on linking with VTK?

There are people that know more about this than me but this sounds like a bad idea for the main VTK repo.? A lot of the OpenGL specific calls are hidden by factories which create them as needed.? For example, you'd create a vtkPolyDataMapper and the factory would create the vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper, vtkMesaPolyDataMapper, etc as needed by the build.

Hello all--

I am running Fedora 15, 64 bit and I have been having the same problems.  Tried
to compile the 3.12 version from source, but I could not make any headway with
ccmake and the build instructions from KitWare.  EMPTY CACHE... ok, now what? 
Gave up on that.

I then downloaded the binary version (originally compiled for Debian), and got
this error when I tried to run it:

[dan at sbox bin]$ ./paraview
/home/dan/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.12/paraview: error
while loading shared libraries: libbz2.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory

The only thing I could think of was to put in a link to the correct location
like so and hope for the best:

whereis libbz2.so.1.0
cd ParaView-3.12.0-RC2-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.12/
ln -s /lib64/libbz2.so.1 libbz2.so.1.0

..and yes, the filenames are slightly different to "fool" the binary

Anyway, this seems to work... I can now save animations but only if I go to
Edit-->Settings... and then
1. disable geometry caching
2. enable Immediate Mode Rendering

Without the second thing, I get the same memory explosion and crash as before.

Hope this helps someone,
D

Oh yeah, I think I remember someone saying that the LIC code had OpenGL
dependencies.  It wouldn't surprise me that other VTK code had these
dependencies as well but I think you'd have to make a pretty strong case as
to why it should be like that.  Implementing it and showing how great it is
would be a good start to making your case though :)

Subject: [Paraview] Changing Chart Series Visibilities from Python
Message-ID: <4E8CF41D.5020208@slac.stanford.edu>

Hi.

I have a ParaView macro which sets up a CSVReader, and a PlotData of 
that.  The variable names and legend names and series colors are all 
filled in automatically by ParaView.

What I would like to do is, from the python macro, iterate through all 
series in a chart and make specific ones visible or invisible.  
Recording a python trace of this gives:

try: paraview.simple

except: from paraview.simple import *

paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

PlotData1 = GetActiveSource()

my_representation0 = GetDisplayProperties(PlotData1)

my_representation0.SeriesColor = ['A(0,0)', '0', '1', '0']

my_representation0.SeriesVisibility = ['A(0,0)', '0']

Render()


When I go the python shell after doing this, and  I do this:

   p = FindSource("PlotData1")
   d = GetDisplayProperties(p)
   print d.SeriesVisibility

it gives me

   ['A(0,0)', '0']

but doesn't say anything about the other series ('A(0,1)' ... 'A(5,5)).

How do I get at the names of the other series?

If I had them, how would I use them?  Like the following?

Thanks.

Greg

new_visibility = []
For i in xrange(len(series_names)):
   new_visibility.append(series_names[i])
   if series_names[i] == 'A(1,3)':  # for example
      new_visibility.append('1')
   else:
      new_visibility.append('0')

d.SeriesVisibility = new_visibility

Render()

Hm, not really.  I'll see if I can figure it out, I'll keep you 
informed.  Not in the coming days, I'm afraid, I'm just about to leave

Subject: [Paraview] plugin input property to select vectors
Message-ID: <CABWOrb_w5EMNaEewcikC6=WGyD2rV6La0qwkLX9sW+ab-z4ZCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to have an input property for my plugin to allow the user to
choose a vector from the input data source.  I add this to my XML (copied
from the stream tracer):

     <StringVectorProperty
       name="SelectInputVectors"
       command="SetInputArrayToProcess"
       number_of_elements="5"
       element_types="0 0 0 0 2"
       animateable="0"
       label="Vectors">
           <ArrayListDomain name="array_list" attribute_type="Vectors">
             <RequiredProperties>
                <Property name="Input" function="Input"/>
             </RequiredProperties>
           </ArrayListDomain>
           <Documentation>
             This property contains the name of the vector array from which
to generate streamlines.
           </Documentation>
     </StringVectorProperty>

This only gives an empty combo box.  What else do I need to do?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Hi Greg,

If you look at Plugins/pvblot/tplot.py you'll find some code that does
exactly this.  You may find some other useful chart code in there too.

For your example, you could do:

series_names = [name for name in d.GetProperty("SeriesNamesInfo")]

Hello,

just tested it on linux 64bit with openfoam decomposed data.
Making a slice and applying "Surface Vectors" results in a Segmentation 
fault.

It would be great to fix this in the 3.12.

Best Regards

Hi, Pierre.

Thanks for responding, especially considering your workload.

Best of luck on your mission.

I'll keep looking at this, and will post if I find something or figure 
something out.

Hi Greg,

I may be out of touch with some recent paraview developments, but I have
never seen this behavior before, it sounds like a bug to me.  Output from
code that is executed in the python console, which includes python macros,
should always be routed to the python console, not paraview's output
window.   Perhaps you are printing from inside a python programmable filter?

Pat

Subject: [Paraview] confused with getting nan values in plot over line
In-Reply-To: <CADbE-6CJ9DVXtRr0KsKqDhnaZUQ8RhnUH5u9uzNdw6SEL=AqOA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <F4420EF66C9C2E459F82C436DABE2F0E2B304D39@EXMB02.srn.sandia.gov>

For starters, the going to infinity thing in the plot is weird. There should just be gaps in the curve. You may have hit a bug.

As far as why you are getting nans in the first place I'm not sure. I can't really tell from your screenshots, but it looks your geometry might be a bunch of polygons on a plane. Is that the case? If so, make sure that all z coordinates are zero. If all the coordinates in pone dimension are exactly the same, then I would expect it to work. Otherwise the line will not be completely on it.

If that is not the case, another problem could be with your topology. The find cell method could fail if your mesh is not fully connected. For example, if you have repeated coincident points, then VTK won't be able to find neighbors and trace to a cell. Try running one of the clean filter on the data. I think that should fix the problem. I think there are some corner cases where even that might not work, but your mesh looks like it has good quality triangles or tetrahedra, so that seems unlikely unless you have degenerate cells or gaps I cannot see.

Hi,

I tried and tried to move the start and end of line inside the domain.
Actually I see two lines going to infinity (nan) in xyplot pane now! (screen shot attached)

Hi, Pat.

Thanks for the helpful pointers.

After setting everything up in ParaView (3.10.1, 64-bit), I'm not 
getting results.  Here is what I did from the ParaView Python Shell:

> >> p = FindSource("PlotData1")

> >> rep = GetDisplayProperties(p)

> >> rep.GetProperty("SeriesNamesInfo")

None

> >>


While, at the same time, the Object Inspector shows 27 series, each with 
the correct name.

Does something need to be updated or refreshed first?  I notice in the 
pvblot script, there is a

   rep.Update()

but when I try that in ParaView's python shell (after getting the 
representation the way I showed above), it tells me:

> >> rep.Update()

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<console>", line 1, in <module>

File "/usr/lib64/paraview/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", line 
370, in __getattr__

return getattr(self.SMProxy, name)

AttributeError: Update

Thanks!

Greg

Hi, Pat.

You're right.  When the print comes from inside a programmable filter, 
the output goes to the Output Messages, and when I print from the macro, 
the output goes to the Python Shell.

I had thought that, within a programmable filter,

   print "something"

was going to the Output Messages, and

   print "something", mylist

was going to the Python Shell,  but I am not able to reproduce this.

Thanks for solving the mystery!

Are you sure that the chart view is the active view when you call
GetDisplayProperties(p)?   If the render view is active, you'll get the
wrong representation.  I verified that this works for Wavelet --> Plot Data
filter using PV 3.10.1.

Hi, Pat.

In the Pipeline Browser, PlotData1 is visible (non-greyed out eye next 
to it), and selected (white text on blue background).  There's a blue 
border around the displayed chart (and not around the 3d view next to it).

When I say

   rep.Visibility = 0
   Render()

the plot window goes all white, and

   rep.Visibilty = 1
   Render()

brings the plot back.

I'm guessing that means rep refers to the correct thing.

How is the ParaView GUI able to see something that I can't?  Or is it 
just that ParaView does most of it's work directly in C++?

Thanks for your help.

Greg

Hi, Pat.

I tried plotting directly from the CSVReader, and then it all works.   
But when my programmable filter is in between, there's a problem.  When 
I apply the plot filter  (via ParaView's GUI) to my programmable filter, 
the plot works fine in the gui, but the GetProperty("SeriesNameInfo") 
returns None.   However, if I skip the programmable filter, and plot the 
CSV reader directly, then GetProperty("SeriesNameInfo") does what you 
say it should.

Anyway, I think I can skip my programmable filter for now, and get this 
working dircetly.

Thanks so much for what you've provided.

Greg

Hi Greg,

I think I found a bug, or else I don't quite understand what is happening.
It seems that under certain circumstances the python layer fails to wrap all
the properties of a proxy.  I look into this, but for now you can work
around the issue by accessing the c++ api:

 >>> p = rep.SMProxy.GetProperty("SeriesNamesInfo")

>>> series_names = [p.GetElement(i) for i in
xrange(p.GetNumberOfElements())]

Hi, Pat.

On further checking, there's still some sort of problem.

When I use your example below, it works in ParaView's Python Shell, if 
the PlotData filter was created via the ParaView gui.   However, if it 
was created in the macro (using the text from a python trace of how it 
was created via the gui), then your example produces an empty list.   
The PlotData filter created in the macro does show up on the screen and 
look correct; but the series names aren't accessible.

Does this provide any useful clues?

Thanks.

Greg

Hi, Pat.

Here is an example that recreates the problem.  Using this as a CSV file:

AAA,BBB,CCC,DDD
0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0
0.0,2.0,4.0,8.0
0.0,3.5,2.5,1.5

and this (modified python trace) as a script run from the python shell 
in paraview:
----------------------------------------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

test_csv = CSVReader( FileName=['test.csv'] )

AnimationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()
RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
Delete(RenderView1)
SpreadSheetView1 = CreateRenderView()
SpreadSheetView1.ViewTime = 0.0

AnimationScene1.ViewModules = SpreadSheetView1

PlotData1 = PlotData()

XYChartView1 = CreateXYPlotView()
XYChartView1.ViewTime = 0.0

DataRepresentation2 = Show()
DataRepresentation2.XArrayName = 'AAA'
DataRepresentation2.AttributeType = 'Row Data'
DataRepresentation2.SeriesVisibility = ['vtkOriginalIndices', '0']

AnimationScene1.ViewModules = [ SpreadSheetView1, XYChartView1 ]

Render()

p = DataRepresentation2.SMProxy.GetProperty("SeriesNamesInfo")
series_names = [p.GetElement(i) for i in xrange(p.GetNumberOfElements())]
print "series_names:", series_names
----------------------------------------------------------------

I get back

   series_names: []

Thanks for any suggestions.

Greg

Thanks Greg.  I can reproduce this.  I'm observing the same thing- if the
chart is created by hand, things are ok, but when created via python
commands, not working correctly.  I'll investigate the problem.  Hopefully
I'll find an easy work around too so that you don't have to wait for the
next release to get the bugfix.

Hi Fabian, I cannot reproduce (OS X 64bit / Ubuntu 10.04 64bit). Can
you isolate whether it is specific to OpeFOAM data or not? If it is,
can you share a test case?

Hi,

I noticed a bug with "Surface Vectors" before - if you have any lines in
your input (i.e. you cut through a volume and surfaces) then it will crash.
 Is this the problem you are having Fabian?

Regards,
Paul

Hello,

   Currently, we are using 3.10.1 release and have noticed the same memory
   problem with or without caching geometry/off screen/immediate mode
   rendering. The 3.8.1 shows the same problem also.  However, 3.6.2 works
   really fine with long time animations.

Hope that helps,

Hi,

I'm encountering a segfault with 3.12 RC2 when I load a .vtu file with
multiple 'pieces'. I'm writing my VTU files in ascii, I've included
two files; one with just a single piece which works just fine in all
released versions from 3.4 to 3.12, and one with two pieces, actually
just a copy of the first piece, which works fine in 3.10.1, but
segfaults 3.12RC2.

I've got another dataset with 40 pieces which are all different but
it's a bit large (6 MB compressed), in case someone is interested.

I have seen this issue too when the client screen size is larger than
the servers display resolution and you are doing GPU rendering on the
server.

Would you be able to create a bug report for this issue please.

Hello community,

 

I?ve noticed the new VRPlugin in the current development version which
replaces VRUI and VRPN plugin. Is there any how to use or tutorial for that
available?

 

Have a nice weekend.

yes it is work in progress, the base idea here is that you can choose
the back-end via a configuration element. So if the VRPlugin is
compiled with VRUI and
VRPN, you can choose which one to use or choose both in a config file
(currently state file).

We are finalizing details and working on a documentation alongside. We
have a pending branch (on gitorious), that needs to be merged in
master once we do some clean up.

We can provide you more details, or even can send you the link for our
collaboration repository if you wish to test our latest and greatest.
We are hoping to have the documentation / code in ParaView master
sometime in November.

Best,

Probably the simplest thing to do is to use the Calculator filter to copy
the data to a different array.  You could use the Python  Calculator to
rename the array (uncheck the Copy Arrays checkbox -- this will get rid of
all other arrays though).

Subject: [Paraview] use of global variables
Message-ID: <4E8F339D.9030503@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello everybody,

I have a custom reader, and I generate cells and points data correctly.
Now I am trying to put global data (like material propeties) in a 
vtkFieldData using

ouput->SetFieldData(my_vtkfielddata);

This work properly and I can see the information in the information tab 
(variable Y).


But the problem is I am unable to access this information in paraview, I 
cant use the variable in the calculator, and if apply the calculator 
filter the global fields are not passed to the output.

How can I access this kind of information in the calculator??

I am using the 3.12.0-RC2 from git in linux, and a custom reader in c++.

Hi Robert,

here you go: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12244

A work around we've used on longhorn and nautilus is to configure the 
server side display w/ a large resolution, such as 2550x1920. It would 
be nice if PV new when it was exceeding servers capability though.

Thanks for looking into it.

Hello to you both,

I am not sure, what you mean with lines in my input, but yes I did cut 
(slice) through a openfoam domain... now I am not able to reproduce it; 
though as Paul mentioned, this error was there earlier as well. I check 
again.

Best Regards
Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot compile ParaView using Macports build of Qt
Message-ID: <F4420EF66C9C2E459F82C436DABE2F0E2B30524A@EXMB02.srn.sandia.gov>

I've been having trouble compiling ParaView on mac using the version of Qt installed with macports. The problem is that I get the following CMake error:

CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewMacros.cmake:193 (add_executable):
  Cannot find source file:

    /opt/local/lib/libQtGui.dylib/Resources/qt_menu.nib/classes.nib

  Tried extensions .c .C .c++ .cc .cpp .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp
  .hxx .in .txx
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMake/ParaViewBranding.cmake:263 (add_executable_with_forwarding2)
  Applications/ParaView/CMakeLists.txt:49 (build_paraview_client)

The problem appears to be that this section of code is assuming that Qt libraries, such as QtGui, are installed as frameworks but macports builds and installs them as simple libraries.  I did find the classes.nib file elsewhere, and created the attached patch to fix the problem.  Could someone please take a look at this?

Hi Fabian,

Paul probably meant lines created by slicing patches (in OpenFOAM
term). Sounds like a bug in Surface Vectors than one in the OpenFOAM
reader anyway...

With Paul's comment I was able to reproduce the problem and did find
what were wrong. One is a trivial bug that forced the filter to try to
calculate normals for all cell types and another is lack of skipping
everything when input array to process is not found (e.g. when a
partial array in a multiblock dataset is specified).

Please find the attachment for the fix. Like Paul and Fabian I'd like
to see this fixed in the 3.12 release.

Felipe,

The Calculator filter has no support for field data currently, see e.g.
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=5626. Neither it is the only
filter that does not pass field data, see e.g.
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10787.

For operations involving field data, like plotting field data over time
or some trivial calculations, I resort to the Programmable Filter.

Here's an example pipeline that first adds a source, then adds some
vector point data to operate on and a single scalar value as field data
to eventually scale an input (point data) data array (stored in the
first non-multi-block leaf of a multi-block dataset) by (the first
component of) the first tuple of a given name data array stored as field
data and add the result as a new data array.

    Sources - Wavelet - Apply
    Filters - Programmable Filter -
        Script: see add.scalarValue.as.fieldData.py - Apply
    Filters - Random Vectors - Apply
    Filters - Programmable Filter -
        Script: see scale.pointData.by.fieldDataValue.py - Apply

It should get you started. Changing the script to work on cell data or
with a different input data array/field data tuple is straightforward.

Sven

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Pyton-Script: GetDisplayProperties fails...
Message-ID: <4E92EC33.9000201@DLR.de>

Hi,

i have an problem with an simple  pyton-script and ParaView (v3.12rc2) - 
trying to use "GetDisplayProperties" in the script (below)

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

servermanager.LoadState("test.pvsm")
view = GetRenderView()
src = GetActiveSource()

dp = GetDisplayProperties(src)
dp.Visibility = 0


gives an error message:


Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
     dp = GetDisplayProperties(src)
   File 
"/opt/PARAVIEW_3_12_0_rc2/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2.bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", 
line 189, in GetDisplayProperties
     return GetRepresentation(proxy, view)
   File 
"/opt/PARAVIEW_3_12_0_rc2/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2.bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", 
line 178, in GetRepresentation
     rep = servermanager.GetRepresentation(proxy, view)
   File 
"/opt/PARAVIEW_3_12_0_rc2/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2.bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 1936, in GetRepresentation
     for rep in view.Representations:
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'Representations'


If i comment out both lines with "dp", everything is fine.

Any ideas what is wrong here?

Best regards and thank you,

      Stefan

The culprit is not dp, but src

GetActiveSource() most likely returns nothing

use FindSource("name"), or GetSources()

Brian, I was on vacation last week. Playing catch up today. Let me
read this thread again and I'll get back to you. Sorry for the

Hi,
I m trying to bluid paraview in a scientific linux 6 x86_64 using ccmake,

Brian,

The Extension mechanism for adding representation types in only
supported by the SurfaceRepresentation and other representations in
the 3D view. We haven't really provided any support for adding
different representation types if Chart views. For your use-case, I
think the easier option would be to create a filter that extracts the
block of interest from the multiblock dataset that contains the
vtkTable and then directly show that in the chart view. The user will
have to explicitly apply this filter. Alternatively, your source can
have two output port, one producing the data to be shown in the 3D
view and the other a vtkTable that can be directly shown in the chart
views.

Does that help?

My reader's output would be in the form of a vtkMultiBlockDataSet which would hold information for both representations (polydatas for representation 1 and vtktables for representation 2) The same vtkMultiBlockDataSet would be passed to each representation where the representation would control what would be sent to the view.

Leonie,

I'm a bit fuzzy on the implementation details, but due to the
interpolation used, movements in straight lines (including zooming)
don't tend to playback correctly. Try using the "Follow Path". You can
define a path in a straight line approaching or moving away from the
object. Also with 3.12, you can write a small Python script to do
custom actions in animation, that may come in handy for doing camera
movements easily.

Zak,

Look at the PYTHON_EXECUTABLE cmake variable. It's been set to
/usr/bin. You need to set it to point to a valid "python" executable.
Make sure Python is installed correctly.

Dear Jean,

thank you for the tip. FindSource gives me the right direction - however 
- FindSource alone does not help, still the same error. What i found is, 
you need to call SetActiveView(GetRenderView()) above. So the running 
script now looks like

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

servermanager.LoadState("test.pvsm")
view = GetRenderView()

SetActiveView(GetRenderView())

GetSources()

#src = GetActiveSource()
src = FindSource("test")

dp = GetDisplayProperties(src)
dp.Visibility = 0


Best regards and thank you,

Message-ID: <SNT108-W15FB4D9E3098E504FAC4A28AE20@phx.gbl>


Hello,

I would like to be able to clip or slice the Earth sphere by specifying say a longitude (e.g 135) or latitude (e.g. -40) but cannot see an easy option.

The slice/clip parameters go from 0 to 1 or -1, so what conversion can one use to get a longitude/latitude etc. I know that the slice can be reoriented manually but it is not ideal.

Thanks for the guidance.

If longitude and latitude are scalar values on your dataset you could use
contour for slicing and threshold for clipping.

I'm trying to update the Fedora package and I'm running into the vtk python 
bindings wanting to be installed in /usr/bin/Python/vtk, which is clearly not 
the right place.  Previously they appeared to be going into 
/usr/lib/paraview/site-packages/paraview/vtk.  Any idea what changed?

Message-ID: <5007D39A-14E3-4698-A713-000D3C7B5AA0@bluequartz.net>

I have a custom reader for ParaView that has multiple output ports. On 2 of those ports are "vtkTable" data types. This all works just fine and reads ok. The issue is when I open the data file in ParaView I get 2 different views each with a "Spreadsheet". Is there any way to tell ParaView that those data sets should be displayed as Line Charts instead of the Spreadsheet view? Or is there a reader that does this already? If so I'll look at that code and figure it out. 

Thanks

I don't know about readers, but some of the filters have a section of their XML that specifies a Chart view preference:

     <Hints>
        <!-- View can be used to specify the preferred view for the proxy -->
        <View type="XYChartView" />
        <Plotable />

Hi Mike,

Normally, few things need to be changed. Maybe due to the
restructuration of the code, some of the CMake variables have changed
as well as the library names. A quick look into the CMakeLists.txt of
the plugins from paraview should fix most of it. XML wise, it's a
different story, but except if you defined a reader, you should
already be good to go as we automatically patch the XML on the fly. If
you are in a reader definition, then you can check how they are
defined inside the file
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/readers.xml

Hope this help,

Seb

Thanks for the heads up. I needed to add some additional include paths to my plugins.

Subject: [Paraview] Slicing or clipping the global sphere to the mailing
 list ParaView
Message-ID: <SNT108-W17690D49BCC51DF34ECD158AE30@phx.gbl>



Hello Paul and Paraview,

Thanks for the reply - resending this without the pics (forgot the 500kb limit!). The data have been projected into spherical coordinates from the original Long/Lat, so X,Y and Z are in kilometers. Not sure if this helps to clarify or not.

I am working with seismic tomography data. The original Lat, Long, radius, anomaly matrix was loaded as a CSV file and then projected into a sphere:

(coordsZ*cos(coordsX*3.14159265/180)*cos(coordsY*3.14159265/180))*iHat+(coordsZ*sin(coordsX*3.14159265/180)*cos(coordsY*3.14159265/180))*jHat+(coordsZ*sin(coordsY*3.14159265/180))*kHat

Loading up a coastline file helps to fix ones position and can use that as a reference for slicing but it is not perfect and needs a lot of tweaking to get the profile right. Looking at the numbers it appears to be radians so one can do the inverse calculation.

I now think I have resolved the issue as the values for the normal can be defined as radians and so feeding in the converted value (angle_in_degrees x pi/180) works - tested for 30 degree slices.
Attached some screen caps to show the workings - hopefully I have got it sorted.

Perhaps it would be useful to have Paraview automatically indicate that the normal values are in Radians (following a degree to Radians conversion in the calculator filter) to avoid confusion.

Regards

Lester

Sven,

Thank very much for the info. With your filters an the changes to my 
home made paraview, I'm able to do what I want.

I put some changer in the bugs report.

changes to use fielddata in the pythoncalculator.

Subject: [Paraview] Displaying an unstructured grid of tetrahedra
Message-ID: <A13978B8-E63F-4AEE-9783-3C3C2B08F9FF@bluequartz.net>

I am trying to visualize the output from some volume meshing code. The output is a bunch of Tetrahedra. When I load the file in paraview (3.12.0rc2) I see the surface just fine but I do not "see" any thing connected to the single interior node. I have checked the file by hand using pencil and paper and the file seems to be formed correctly. When ParaView is viewing a dataset in "Surface mode" does it leave out the interior nodes or am I just missing something basic? Here is the data file:

Hey Mike,

Yes, it's a standard ParaView thing that the interior nodes are left out for rendering efficiency. You can see this more dramatically if you generate a Wavelet Source and view it in Points representation ? it only shows the surface vertices. Now with your data or this ImageData, apply a 2D vertex glyph and you'll see all the interior nodes. Or, apply the Extract Edges filter to view the interior edges.

Yes.  All the display modes except volume rendering show only things on
the external surface. If you want to see that interior point, you can run
the extract edges filter to show all of the edges or run the glyph filter
using a 2D glyph of type vertex.

Can I put that as part of an <outputport> xml element? My reader produces 5 different output ports. 3 of those are XY scatter plot data sets.

The issue is when I open the data file in ParaView I get 2 different views each with a "Spreadsheet". Is there any way to tell ParaView that those data sets should be displayed as Line Charts instead of the Spreadsheet view? Or is there a reader that does this already? If so I'll look at that code and figure it out.

If I remember correctly, that's not supported yet. ViewType hint is
only supported for the 1st output port

The issue is when I open the data file in ParaView I get 2 different views each with a "Spreadsheet". Is there any way to tell ParaView that those data sets should be displayed as Line Charts instead of the Spreadsheet view? Or is there a reader that does this already? If so I'll look at that code and figure it out.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin Crashing on PV 3.12 RC2
Message-ID: <73D838C2-D2BA-41B7-9905-C039A702B515@bluequartz.net>

I have a custom reader plugin that I am trying to update for ParaView 3.12. Everything seems to compile OK and ParaView launches Ok. When I try to open one of my files I get the following:

ERROR: In /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/vtkSIProxy.cxx, line 240

Which is down in this section of the vtkSIProxy:

  if (className && className[0])
    {
    this->SetVTKClassName(className);
    vtkObjectBase* obj = this->Interpreter->NewInstance(className);
    if (!obj)

In my "Gui XML" code I have this:

          extensions="ddviz"

I have cleaned the build directory a few times in the hopes that there was something weird with the configuration/compilation but that did not seem to help. I have not been keeping up with the changes going on with ParaView lately so this is all new to me. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

Mike,

Can you include the CMakeLists.txt?

Message-ID: <CAF2rzHLJpEXGFXCqTRqGrYCE_dC=B5+hTNPAD=U2-eGfYx3vAg@mail.gmail.com>

So I have went with the filter and it seems to be what I need. However I
have run into an odd issue.

In my filter's xml, I have:

<Hints>
    <View type="XYChartView" />
    <Plotable />
 </Hints>

and the filter returns a table containing 4 columns as follows:
Node1: Data Received
Node2: Data Received
Time
vtkOriginalIndices

I was wondering how I can by default get Time and vtkOriginalIndices to not
show up.
If I have my filter go to a spreadsheet, then I open a Line Chart View and
show my data in it, I
end up with the line chart showing Node1: Data Received, Node2: Data
Received and a vertical line depicting which timestep we are currently on.

How can I have this show up by default?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

What is this new XML tag? 
si_class="vtkSIFileSeriesReaderProxy"

This is one of the differences between my plugin and the plugins that come with ParaView. I still can not come up with why my plugin is failing.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualization of legacy Vtk
Message-ID: <CAKpY3KUUG7myhd8gKRHbNRp1webTVZN5dc-i1eb5b-og2wJ93Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a vtk file, generated by the famous WriteToVtk.m file circulating in
the web from a 3D matrix in Matlab.The format is kind of legacy vtk. I have
tried to load the file in Paraview. The file loads but is transparent (I can
just see the bounding box).

Can anyone help? What's the problem?

Best,
Negar

P.S: This is the mfile I am talking about:

function WriteToVTK(matrix, filename)
% WriteToVTK(matrix, filename)
%
% Writes a 3D matrix as a VTK file. View with paraview.
% The matrix must be 3D and is normalised (kind of).
%
% A sligthly old format is used because it is simpler.

% Example VTK file:
% # vtk DataFile Version 2.0
% Volume example
% ASCII
% DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
% DIMENSIONS 3 4 6
% ASPECT_RATIO 1 1 1
% ORIGIN 0 0 0
% POINT_DATA 72
% SCALARS volume_scalars char 1
% LOOKUP_TABLE default
% 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
% 0 5 10 15 20 25 25 20 15 10 5 0
% 0 10 20 30 40 50 50 40 30 20 10 0
% 0 10 20 30 40 50 50 40 30 20 10 0
% 0 5 10 15 20 25 25 20 15 10 5 0
% 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

% Get the matrix dimensions.
[N M O] = size(matrix);

% Get the maximum value for the normalisation.
mx = max(matrix(:));

% Open the file.
fid = fopen(filename, 'w');
if fid == -1
    error('Cannot open file for writing.');
end

% New line.
nl = sprintf('\n'); % Stupid matlab doesn't interpret \n normally.

% Write the file header.
fwrite(fid, ['# vtk DataFile Version 2.0' nl 'Volume example' nl 'ASCII' nl ...
    'DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS' nl 'DIMENSIONS ' ...
    num2str(N) ' ' num2str(M) ' ' num2str(O) nl 'ASPECT_RATIO 1 1 1' nl ...
    'ORIGIN 0 0 0' nl 'POINT_DATA ' ...
    num2str(N*M*O) nl 'SCALARS volume_scalars char 1' nl 'LOOKUP_TABLE
default' nl]);

for z = 1:O
    % Get this layer.
    v = matrix(:, :, z);
    % Scale it. This assumes there are no negative numbers. I'm not sure
    % this is actually necessary.
    v = round(100 .* v(:) ./ mx);
    % Write the values as text numbers.
    fwrite(fid, num2str(v'));
    % Newline.
    fwrite(fid, nl);

    % Display progress.
    disp([num2str(round(100*z/O)) '%']);
end

% Close the file.
fclose(fid);

end

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple polydata in same pipeline -- don't always seem
	centered around same origin
Message-ID: <1318448045.50287.YahooMailNeo@web36505.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,


I have been writing some code that basically computes points on certain portions of line segments (kind of line intersection points), and I can't help but notice that when I zoom in, these points appear "disconnected" from lines the should lie on top of.

To illustrate my point, I have created a simple example using stock paraview filters (see attachments).? In centroid_zoomed_out, I basically create a line using the line source filter, then using a programmable filter I compute its centroid and create a vertex.? When I render both pieces of polydata, the result looks correct when one is zoomed out.


But zoomed-in (centroid_zoomed_in), it appears to be disconnected from the line.? Is there any reason for this? I have never rendered points and lines together in paraview, but I would expect them to exist around the same origin.


Thanks, Sohail

That's only needed if you're creating a file-series writer using a
writer that does not support file series, which is not the case here.
The problem is your VTk classes aren't getting compiled in/wrapped
correctly. Let me check it out.

You need to change the representation in ParaView to be "Surface"
instead of "Outline" in one of the combo box that is in the toolbar.

ParaView draws points and lines slightly offset so that you see
wireframes on top of surfaces.

Try playing with Edit->Settings->Render View->General->Coincident
Topology Resolution to change this behavior.

Thanks. Changing the setting "Coincident Topology Resolution" to "Do Nothing" made it work.

I'm kind of new to paraview; I want to compare different volumes with each

The information tab shows the bounds.

On the bottom of the display tab you can scale and translate where the
objects are _drawn_ if you need to force them to line up. The
transform filter works similarly but it actually moves the (point set)
data if you need to filter the lined up data.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin Requiring another plugin option
Message-ID: <92A4EA68-E1EB-4175-93CC-761ABB238BBD@bluequartz.net>

I have a plugin that requires another plugin to work correctly. I have the following in my CMake files for the plugin:

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN ("PVDislocationPlugin" "1.0"
    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ${ParaDis_Server_Wrapped_Sources}
    SERVER_MANAGER_XML     ${ParaDis_SM_XML}
    SERVER_SOURCES         ${ParaDis_Server_Sources}
    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES     ${ParaDis_Client_XML}
    REQUIRED_ON_SERVER     ${PVDislocation_SOURCE_DIR}/Code/Client/Resources/
    REQUIRED_PLUGINS   "PVH5VtkPlugin")
target_link_libraries(PVDislocationPlugin PVH5VtkPlugin)

Note the "target_link_libraries" call. To get the plugin to compile I need to add that line. I would have thought the REQUIRED_PLUGINS argument would have taken care of that. Is this a bug, half implemented feature or operator error?


Thanks

required plugins doesn't add compile-time dependencies. It's meant for
runtime dependencies. The Plugin Dialog will complain if required
plugins are not loaded.

Hi Takuya,

Thanks a lot for your suggestion.  I looked at the readers.xml file and
found an example in vtkExodusIIReader.
I copied that to a test reader of mine and it worked like a charm.
But, I then put the same code in my custom *filter* and it did not
work, the text box and browser widget simply did not appear in the
properties panel.

Does anyone have sample code (hopefully just XML spec) for adding
a browser button to a filter properties panel, not a reader ?

thanks
Kate

Specificially, when I click on the file open button and locate the directory where the file is located, I can not see it.  I then scroll down to show all files.  When I click on the .facet file it asks for me to select a reader.   So far, I have been unable to make the right selection.  I am running ParaView 3.12 on a Mac (using Lion).

I really hate to bother you, but would really appreciate any help you could offer.  Thank you very much for your time.
Sincerely
Micah North

Hi,

VTK supports facet files with the vtkUGFacetReader which has not been
exposed in ParaView. I don't have any experience with the reader but I
don't see why we can't expose it.

You can create an xml plugin that exposes the reader in ParaView. You
should read the wiki page on this at:

Hi,

Currently in ParaView you can't expose a new reader with a pure XML
based plugin. I have added the feature to mantis so you can track the
feature ( http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12657)

In the meantime you will have build your own plugin which will require
you too build your own version of ParaView or to use the developer
release.  I have included the necessary files to make the reader once
you have the correct ParaView version.

I would recommend reading the
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo page to understand how
to build your own plugin.

You can use the python console instead of a plugin, if you want.  Open the
python console under the Tools menu and execute:

filename = "foo.facet"

import vtkIOPython
r = vtkIOPython.vtkUGFacetReader()
r.SetFileName(filename)
r.Update()
t = TrivialProducer()
t.GetClientSideObject().SetOutput(r.GetOutput())
t.UpdatePipeline()
Show()


Note, this works for paraview in the standard client only mode.  This will
not work when paraview is connected to a remote server.

I also added a bug to add a facet reader to ParaView.  Per Robert's comments, it should be easy to add.

You can use the python console instead of a plugin, if you want.  Open the python console under the Tools menu and execute:

filename = "foo.facet"

import vtkIOPython
r = vtkIOPython.vtkUGFacetReader()
r.SetFileName(filename)
r.Update()
t = TrivialProducer()
t.GetClientSideObject().SetOutput(r.GetOutput())
t.UpdatePipeline()
Show()


Note, this works for paraview in the standard client only mode.  This will not work when paraview is connected to a remote server.

Hi,

Currently in ParaView you can't expose a new reader with a pure XML
based plugin. I have added the feature to mantis so you can track the
feature ( http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12657)

In the meantime you will have build your own plugin which will require
you too build your own version of ParaView or to use the developer
release.  I have included the necessary files to make the reader once
you have the correct ParaView version.

I would recommend reading the
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo page to understand how
to build your own plugin.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkODBCDatabase and Oracle
Message-ID: <CAHSaYkpsms7Uz0atQb8Cr2pfOgKwKdmrD6iZXtnvV5auN1dtbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to create a ParaView reader (or source) that uses
vtkODBCDatabase to connect and read data from an
Oracle Database.

I compiled ParaView with :
VTK_USE_ODBC ON
ODBC_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft
SDKs/Windows/v7.0A/Include
ODBC_LIBRARY C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.0A/Lib/odbc32.lib

The connection is working correctly:

vtkODBCDatabase* db = vtkODBCDatabase::New();
vtkStdString dataSourceName ="DRIVER={Microsoft ODBC for
Oracle};SERVER=localhost:1521/xe/;";
db->SetDataSourceName(dataSourceName.c_str());
db->SetUserName("user");
bool status = db->Open("password");

To get a specific table from the database and information about the
columns I do:

vtkSQLQuery* sqlQuery = db->GetQueryInstance();
vtkStdString query = "select * from " + vtkStdString(tableName);
sqlQuery->SetQuery(query.c_str());
sqlQuery->Execute();

for(int j=0; j<sqlQuery->GetNumberOfFields(); ++j)
{
? ? ? ?vtkStdString fieldName = sqlQuery->GetFieldName(j);
? ? ? ?int fieldType = sqlQuery->GetFieldType(j);
}

All that is working very well. The problem happens when I try to read
values of "Number" data type:

?while(sqlQuery->NextRow())
{
? ? ? ?// the first column is a "string" so it works -> ok = true
? ? ? ?bool ok = sqlQuery->DataValue(0).IsValid();

? ? ? ?// the second value is a Number-> ok = false this time.
? ? ? ?bool ok = sqlQuery->DataValue(1).IsValid();
}

Reading a Number value from a row is returning an invalid vtkVariant.
Any ideas ?

I also tried "float" columns and it works. It seems that the problem
happens only with "Number".

I created the table with a query like:
CREATE TABLE Table1 (Name VARCHAR2 (40), Value NUMBER (38,8));


Thanks,

Nehme

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Panel in Plugin Auto Qt Signal/Slot not working
Message-ID: <9E35D0B7-98A3-4EB5-A2E4-5F7FCD0D1865@bluequartz.net>

I have a plugin that has a custom Qt panel derived from pqLoadedFormObjectPanel which has a bunch of buttons. I was relying on Qt's auto hookup feature in the past to connect all the buttons and checkboxes with the proper slots that are declared in my class. Those hookups do not seem to be happening anymore as clicking on the checkboxes or buttons will not execute the code. I have had to change up my CMake files a bit so maybe I am missing something? Automoc? Not sure how to check if the header is getting moc'ed or not. 
  Just posting to make sure something has not changed between ParaView 3.10 and 3.12 that necessitates having to manually hook everything up.

Thanks

Hi and excuse me for late reply,

I tried the "Clean to grid" filter and it seems that problems has been
solved. But I noticed that
the data was coming from a finite element method using P1-discontinuous
Triangular elements.
And it looks for me the problem is somehow related to that.

But as a general question Can paraview show P1-discontinuous data? then for
each node in mesh
we have several values. But I think vtk format accepts only one value for
each noed.

Regards,
Ali

Hi,

 From a few of the recent posts it sounds like there are potentially 
disruptive changes in 3.12 that could affect existing external plugins. 
It would be very helpful if these changes were documented on the wiki as 
a courtesy to plugin authors/maintainers. Any chance you have such a 
wiki page already or would be willing to add one?

I'm not familier with the term P1-discontinuous.  Is that the same as not C0 continuous (or simply not continuous)?

If so, then yes that is a problem.  The VTK data sets do not directly represent discontinuous interpolated fields.  The only way to do it is how you describe.  Replicate the point so that two distinct field values can be placed at the same coordinates.  But, as you discovered, this means that the connectivity cannot be represented, which can foul up some operations like finding a cell.

I know of no simple away around the problem.  You would need a different cell locator that used a different slower but more reliable search.

As far as why you are getting nans in the first place I'm not sure. I can't really tell from your screenshots, but it looks your geometry might be a bunch of polygons on a plane. Is that the case? If so, make sure that all z coordinates are zero. If all the coordinates in pone dimension are exactly the same, then I would expect it to work. Otherwise the line will not be completely on it.

Burlen,

What changes are you referring to?
The changes to ServerManager have been documented at:
http://paraview.org/ParaView3/images/2/24/ParaViewCollaborationChanges.pdf

Reader/filter plugins should be unaffected for the most part.

Hi Utkarsh,

Perhaps I was reading too much into recent posts by Michael Jackson 
<mike.jackson at bluequartz.net> about 3.12 changes that affected his 
plugins. I'm a bit defensive on this issue as over the past couple of 
years I can think of 3 changes that bit me. all showed up at run time 
and were difficult to debug. I thought it would be good to plan ahead 
for this release, make a pass through our plugins and catch any 
potential issues up front. Thanks for the link. Judging from your reply, 
it sounds like there won't be much to do this time :)

Hello,

I would like to distribute binaries for a reader plugin I wrote.  In the
past, I built our plugins against ParaView-Development-3.8.1-*.tar.gz as
documented here
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView:Plugin_Deployment_with_Development_Installs
However, I can't track down the 3.10 development release.

Also, the release notes [ http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/273 ]
linked to the "Get the Software" page points to 3.8.1
http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html.  Where can I find
3.10.x and 3.12.x release notes?

Thanks,
Pete

Hi,

Thanks,

Yes p1-discontinuous elements are exactly the same as p1's but on each point
of
mesh each cell has it's own degree of freedom so at one point we'll have
different
values...

Message-ID: <CABWOrb92-heZVn-bPzXYNTHTqG72p9T763e7kUV+v=jsPHhMoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been using QtCreator for quite a while developing ParaView plugins but
before I had been manually maintaining my "*.list" file containing all the
source files to be put in the project tree.  Recently I have upgraded to the
latest version and now import the project from the CMakeLists.txt file but I
do not see any of the XML files (i.e. files that are added with
SERVER_MANAGER_XML in the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro).  Has anyone else had
this problem?  And, can anyone suggest a fix?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

None of those.  The cell data to point data filter just finds all cells
neighboring each point and averages the cell values of those neighbors.

Wow, not even a volume averaging? node value = sum (cell values * cell 
volume)/total volume

No, but I'm not sure that would be more accurate in any sense.


The cell values I usually see represent some field values integrated over
the volume of the cell.  In this case, the smaller the cell volume, the
more representative the integrated value is likely to be for any point in
the cell.  Thus, if I was to introduce weighting, I would use the inverse
of the cell volume.

I'm sure you can quickly come up with a counterexample why scaling by the
cell volume is the right thing to do.  And that's kind of the point.  The
conversion from cell data to point data is ambiguously defined and the
best solution depends on your data semantics and problem domain.  Although
simple averaging is not always ideal, it is fast and can be used as a low
order approximation as well as anything else.

Hi,

I wanted to add the visit readers to my custom app but, after compiling
paraview with VISIT_BRIDGE, it works with the paraview app and not mine.  I
couldn't see anything in the paraview client CMakeLists.txt for using it.
 Can anyone help?

Here are a few of the issues that I have had with migrating a few plugins from ParaView 3.10 to 3.12:

I now use EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGIN_DIRS instead of EXTERNAL_MODULES.

Where I used to have code in my cmake files such as:
# -- Add the Server Manager XML
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES( "${H5Vtk_SM_XML}" )
# -- Add the Client side xml
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES( "${H5Vtk_Client_XML}" )
# -- Add the wrapped sources
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES("${H5Vtk_SM_Wrapped_SRCS}")
# -- Add additional sources that are NOT wrapped
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SOURCES ("${H5Vtk_SRCS}")

I now have this code:
    ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN ("PVH5VtkPlugin" "1.0"
        SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ${H5Vtk_Server_Wrapped_Sources}
        SERVER_MANAGER_XML     ${H5Vtk_SM_XML}
        SERVER_SOURCES         ${H5Vtk_Server_Sources}
        GUI_RESOURCE_FILES     ${H5Vtk_Client_XML}
        REQUIRED_ON_SERVER )

I also have some Custom object panels I designed with QDesigner and I have found I need to add the following to the constructor:

  QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName(this);

in order to get the auto connect of signals/slots connected properly. After those changes the plugins now seem to be working correctly.

The other comment I have is that the original CMake code I had to add a server side "plugin" really just added additional code to one of the PVFilters targets and then I compiled a separate plugin that had the gui code. The first iteration of changes had me creating actual plugins for both the server and client side which seemed even more confusing. After looking through some additional plugins in the ParaView source directory I was able to extract the needed cmake logic to compile the plugin with our without the GUI stuff included based on if ParaView was being compile with Qt support. I think this is the "preferred" way to do this now. If not, can someone with knowledge please comment.

Hope that helps someone in the future.

I'm a bit defensive on this issue as over the past couple of years I can think of 3 changes that bit me. all showed up at run time and were difficult to debug. I thought it would be good to plan ahead for this release, make a pass through our plugins and catch any potential issues up front. Thanks for the link. Judging from your reply, it sounds like there won't be much to do this time :)

Ah yes, now  I remember. I think we meant to deprecate the support for
compiling in "external modules" in favor of the ability to add
plugins. I've updated
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time to
indicate the same.

In short, extending ParaView at compile time one now has to
exclusively use Plugin mechanism. Random compiling-in of code is no
longer supported.

Hi Nenad,

I looked into some but then got distracted. I will try to have a
solution this week.

Sorry about the delay.

Thanks,

Peter,

We didn't put out the development binaries for 3.10, however we are
currently gearing for 3.12 and we will include development binaries
with this version.

Once the release is out, the release notes are collected at:

only these two

Hi Andy,

Excuse me, suddenly hit the send button...
So in the edit view  options for legend I see only
- a check box "show the chart legend when available"
and
 a drop box for setting the location of legend.

But I want to change the text in legend. e.g. currently I see "vectors(0)"
and
"vectors(1)" in legend but I want to change them to "horizontal V" and
"vertical V"

Regards,
Ali

Hi Ali,

The easiest way I can think of to accomplish this is to abuse the
Calculator filter twice prior to applying the filter you use to create
the xyplot: Use the formula "vector . iHat" and the result array name
"horizontal V" in the first Calculator filter and "vector . jHat" and
"vertical V" in the second.

Alternatively to using dot products and unit vectors, directly use the
vector components that ParaView auto-splits up and refers to as
'vector_X', 'vector_Y' in the Calculatur's filter.

I've found a solution here - I can just add lines to my ParaViewReaders.xml
for my custom client to get the plugins I would like.  I had just assumed
they would all be included as they are with the paraview application....
Thanks,
Paul

Hi,

I've looked into this further and the problem is that cmake is not adding
the XML files to the cbp file that it generates.  The only solution I can
find is to include the XML files in the sources (although this doesn't seem
a good idea to me).  Is there something that can be added to the paraview
cmake files to get these included automatically?

Thanks,
Paul

As the VisIt Readers are optional the xml definitions of them have to
be optional, else ParaView
would report it had readers that don't exist.

On the display tab, in the table showing the "Line Series" simply
double-click on the "Legend Name" text corresponding to the variable
who's legend text you want change to edit it.

Subject: [Paraview] 2D slices from 3d surface image.
Message-ID: <000c01cc8e65$04b7d7a0$0e2786e0$@com>

Hi, 

 

I am using paraview 3.10 and am trying to load a 3Dimensional IMG-HDR file
or SDT-SPR file. I would like to see the 2D slices of the 3D image, I find
that the slice part on the left hand side is not visible for these file
types.

 

Could someone tell me how to load 2D slices of a 3d Surface? Does Paraview
support loading a 2D slice image at all.?

 

Thanks, 

Anand

Hi Utkarsh,

When I double click on that the "select color" window opens and I can
change the color of line only (and nothing for changing the legend name)...

That's good to know - I've been wanting to do that!  And it can even be done

Try click-small-pause-click, rather than just a double-click. You
know, the kind of "double-click" one uses if one wants to change the
name of a folder in Windows Explorer, for example.

Could you clarify what you mean by not visible?

I suggest loading it as a 3D volume and then using extract subset
filter to pull out whatever axis aligned slice you need.

I haven't tried the time series helper trick with the raw reader
myself. Perhaps someone else has.

In the past what I've done is use xdmf's Binary format (as opposed to
the normal hdf or text) inside a time series collection to get time
varying raw image data into ParaView.

A snippet of my xdmf file from reading the IEEEVis04 challenge data is attached.

That's a cool trick.  Think you can post that the the ParaView wiki?

I second that. I didn't know such a thing was even possible, but

It shouldn't be a problem with a build from source version of
ParaView. In that case when you turn on the python option cmake finds
your system python libs and build/links with them. If they happen to
find the wrong set for some reason you can always change them and
rebuild.

Message-ID: <CAB-kKvHTb6erZ0RA+13vDguce=ahFhd9T1x1HnYJjyGrHMJvQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I try to run the MPI version of Paraview but it's probably don't work.

First I run pvserver:

*login at hostname:~$ mpirun -np 8 pvserver  --use-offscreen-rendering
Waiting for client
Connection URL: cs://localhost:11111*

Probably this is fine.
After I start paraview with

*login at hostname:/opt/Paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2_MPI/bin$ ./paraview
--server=cs://localhost:11111*

This is give no error message but I'm not sure that it's work.

Is somebody know a way to test it ?

Thanks,
Guillaume

Make a sphere source and apply the process id scalars filter.

If there is no such filter you are not connected to an MPI enabled
server. If you are you should see a sphere with N distinct colors
where N is the number of nodes in the MPI job.

*I run:
mpirun -np 8 pvserver  --use-offscreen-rendering*
And after connecting to the server with the GUI and it's work fine.
I can see one color per process on the sphere with the filter "Process Id
scalars"

Thanks,

David, 

If I understand correct, Paraview tool loads data primarily by rendering as
mesh, how can I load an image to load as an image data not as 3D.
I have a IMG-HDR files and I want them to see as 2D slices in X,Y,Z
direction. This is basically for an Medical imaging application I am trying
to work out and in medical imaging we have to represent 2D slices rather
than rendering them as 3D representation. 

I may be na?ve in asking this but I can send further image samples and
screen shots for further info. I don?t know if I can attach images as
attachments on the mailing list. Please confirm I will detail out further.

Thanks. 
Anand

Could you clarify what you mean by not visible?

I suggest loading it as a 3D volume and then using extract subset
filter to pull out whatever axis aligned slice you need.

Once the image is opened, try changing the representation type on the
display tab (or from the toolbar) to "Slice", or split the view and
create a 2D View and show the data in that view.

Subject: [Paraview] create representation to display 3 planes of image data
Message-ID: <3382af7bdbbacd7679455f6986d1b6b3.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

I would like to simultaneously view 3 planes (XY, YZ, XZ) of an image.
I made a Python macro to do this, but I think its clunky.

I think the right way to do this is to write a plugin representation
similar to
ImageSliceRepresentation but pulling out  3 slices.

-- Would a plugin representation be the right way to go ?
-- Documentation seems to discourage folks a little from messing
    with their own representations.  If it is the right way to go, is
    it feasible in ParaView right now ?  I am using 3.12-RC2.
-- To start, based on the MySpecialRepresentation example, I wrote
    a "OrthoSliceAlphaRepresentation" that subclasses
ImageSliceRepresentation
    but doesn't change anything, and I don't even substitute my own mapper
    at this point.  I made it a subproxy extending UniformGridRepresentation.
    It appears as a Rep. for image data, but the Slice selector in the
    display panel is greyed out.  Why is this ?  (Code snippets below).
-- For the real code I think I should not subclass ImageSliceRepresentation
   but copy/rename all that code and alter it, ie having
OrthoSliceAlphaRepresentation
   subclass  vtkPVDataRepresentation.  Is that the way you would do it ?

thanks
Kate

Message-ID: <BA893EC25B302C47ACB2C8AA19FA998BE0D6B7E6B2@EXCHANGE.cadensimaging.local>

Hello,

I know I can launch Paraview and load a file using the following command in a linux terminal:

paraview --data=file.vtk

I also know I can load a group of file with different timesteps (file0.vtk, file1.vtk, ... ) like this:

paraview --data=file..vtk

Is it possible to launch Paraview and load at once a group of files with different timesteps and a few other files? Something like:

paraview --data=file..vtk result.vtk data.vtk

Entering multiple arguments after "--data=" like in the command here above doesn't work. I also tough about something like this, but it opens different viewers... :

paraview --data=file..vtk
paraview --data=result.vtk
paraview --data=data.vtk

So if there is a way to load many files at once in a terminal, it would be very helpful!

Thanks for helping!

David

Utkarsh,

Its my observation that the slice option under representation comes for few
of my data files and for rest it doesn?t, what does it depend on? the headsq
file under tutorial seem to have 93 slice individual images.  So when does
slice option comes when I load a image data ?

Thanks, 
Anand

Once the image is opened, try changing the representation type on the
display tab (or from the toolbar) to "Slice", or split the view and
create a 2D View and show the data in that view.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkHardwareSelection on vtkUnstructuredGrid
Message-ID: <1319191698.34782.YahooMailNeo@web132205.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello,?

Here's my problem, I want to select cells from vtkUnstructuredGrid using vtkHardwareSelector but this does not work.

I have seen on this? link http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkHardwareSelector.html#details? that "If you need to select other data types, consider using vtkDataSetMapper and turning on it's PassThroughCellIds feature, or using vtkFrustumExtractor".

But where I enable the PassThroughCellIds feature and how should I use vtkFrustumExtractor.

I have tried with vtkAreaPicker using vtkDataSetMapper but no result. 


Thank you for your help.

Message-ID: <B92425CF-E445-440C-ACEB-25D128023438@lcp.nrl.navy.mil>

Are there plans for Paraview to upgrade to version 3.1 of the CGNS library?

Paraview does not seem to be able to handle CGNS 3.1 files currently, which is the version of CGNS my code exports data to.  Therefore, in order to use Paraview, I have to first run 'cgnsversion 2.5 data.cgns', which is an inconvenience.  Furthermore, the error message given is just 'Unable to find any meshes', which is not that helpful for users who don't realize what the problem might be.

Thanks,
Andrew Corrigan

Yes, Slice representation type is only available for Image Data datasets.

So, since I have not yet find any solution, my question is: what vtkMapper should I use to display vtkMultiBlockDataSet of unstructuredGrid in order to select cells or points and extract this selection ?


Thank you

Currently CGNS support is provided by the VisIt bridge so we are
limited to the versions they support.

I expect if that a large number of users would like CGNS 3.X support
we can look at the effort required to get that into ParaView.

So I guess I configured wrong? I set the following variables in cmake:

CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.6
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS -arch x86_64
CMAKE_C_FLAGS -arch x86_64
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES x86_64

Am I missing something?

Thanks

Hello,

I encounter a segmentation fault when trying to clip an unstructured
grid containing more than one polyhedron (cell type 42) in Paraview
3.10.1 64-bit. Clipping a single polyhedron does not yield a seg. fault
but gives a non-watertight cell which obviously is not correct. In
contrast, slicing works flawlessly.

I wonder if my .vtu file is faulty. A minimal example containing two
tetrahedra is given below. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Lennart

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to build Paraview 3.12 with VisIt readers
Message-ID: <F7E5180F-18D6-40A8-BDC9-595631DABAC7@llnl.gov>

I have never been able to successfully get Paraview to build and use the MILI readers at LLNL.  
Recently I decided to try building paraview 3.12 to see if I can do it.  

the build exits with the follwoing error.  Can someone point me at a resolution?  Thanks!

It looks like it's not finding HDF5.  I don't know why.  I grepped for HDF5 in CMakeCache.txt.  There are a few NOTFOUND entries, but would they cause that error?  
Thanks!

Hello Aashish,

sorry for my late response: Yes, I would like to have some more information
and the link to your collaboration repro. Thank you for that. Is there also
an how-to available for using VRPlugin?
Is this new plugin a part of the refactoring work you mentioned in your post
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2011-June/022086.html). How is
the state of this project, cause I also need those capabilities to configure
ParaView for Virtual Environment.

Thanks again.

Regards,
Stephan

yes it is work in progress, the base idea here is that you can choose the
back-end via a configuration element. So if the VRPlugin is compiled with
VRUI and VRPN, you can choose which one to use or choose both in a config
file (currently state file).

We are finalizing details and working on a documentation alongside. We have
a pending branch (on gitorious), that needs to be merged in master once we
do some clean up.

We can provide you more details, or even can send you the link for our
collaboration repository if you wish to test our latest and greatest.
We are hoping to have the documentation / code in ParaView master sometime
in November.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] vtkPCosmoReader
Message-ID: <CAKVa3HHHieTmxnr-TaEetrnfm5kcMUww-6qcAPAUiV8c5okK+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Till last week I used vtkCosmoReader to read .cosmo files.
Now I try to use its parallel version,
and I have a few questions.

I noticed that there are more functions, like SetRL
and SetOverlap.
I set them, should I call update() after that?

i tried to run this:
    vtkPCosmoReader *cosmo_reader = vtkPCosmoReader::New();
    vtkUnstructuredGrid *cosmo_data;
    cosmo_reader->SetRL(256.0);
    cosmo_reader->SetOverlap(5);
    cosmo_reader->SetFileName(cosmo_filename);
    cosmo_reader->Update();
    cosmo_data = cosmo_reader->GetOutput(0);

I get bad-alloc error because of
"cosmo_reader->Update();"

if i comment this line out,
it will go through, but the all the fields will have values equal to zero.


Thank you,
Uliana

Subject: [Paraview] need book to understand vtk-file formats?
Message-ID: <201110251619.56616.tlange@gwdg.de>

Hello,

I asked a student to get familiar with vtk formats to later write scripts to 
extract geometry and scalar/property data from a simulation tool to be 
visualized in PARAVIEW.

There are two books offered related to vtk (Textbook and User's Guide). Would 
one of those be helpful for the student? Or are the online sources sufficient? 
Or maybe other books?

Thank you,
Torsten

I believe that neither of these explain the file formats.

You are looking for a file called VTK-file-formats.pdf which explains the "legacy" file formats. There are some XML based file formats that might also be useful. Just depends what the simulation is writing.

The VTK file formats (both the legacy and the xml-based versions) are
described in the VTK User's Guide.  There is also a file posted on the VTK
Wiki (URL below) that gives the same information.

Sorry for my noise. I guess I should not be commenting on a book that
I have 20 miles away from me at work. I am glad the others cleared
that up..

I am currently working on adding MPI Support and better read times to
the LSDyna reader and noticed that
we currently don't have any test files. So if anybody has reasonable
sized files that can be added to the VTK/ParaView
test suite it would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] pvdataserver no clip/slice work
Message-ID: <4EA706B8.3010809@web.de>

Hi,

I have to analyse very big data up to 20TB in the next time. To do this 
I start a pvdataserver, pvrenderserve and a paraview client whith a 
small testfile.

#### config.pvx##############
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
<Process Type="client" >
<Machine Name="joker" />
</Process>
<Process Type="data-server">
<Machine Name="wildcard" />
<Machine Name="n05" />
<Machine Name="n04"/>
<Machine Name="n03"/>
<Machine Name="n02"/>
<Machine Name="n06"/>
</Process>
<Process Type="render-server" >
<Machine Name="joker" />
</Process>
</pvx>
##########config end########

mpirun -np 4 ./pvdataserver config.pvx
./pvrenderserver  config.pvx
./paraview config.pvx

The problem is that if I use a pvdataserver and renderserver I can't use 
the clip tool. I can select the clip tool and than I see nothing in the 
preview window. I can't see my extracted data and can't see  the plane 
which normaly shows where I cut the data.
I have the same problem if I only use one dataserver (without mpi) and 
one renderserver.
If I start only paraview in single mode I can use the cut tool without 
problems.

I have test paraview 3.10.1 for linux64 and 3.12.0 RC2 linux64.

Can someone help me? Is this normal that the cut and slice tool on a 
cluster not work?

Hi,

if you use a single pvserver instead of pvdataserver and
pvrenderserver do you still have the problem?
You should be able to use all the filters with a remote server.

Hey Rich, is this paraview master? What settings have you turned on? Just
Build Shared, PARAVIEW_USE_MPI and Python?

I have been tweaking for days on my CMakeCache.txt.
I don't know which are relevant to this but, here's a start:
Thanks!
BTW, I searched through our mpi headers and could not find a reference to MPI_IN_PLACE.  I'm wondering if there is a version of MPI which is being assumed.  We are using mvapich 0.9.9 I think.  This might be an option I could change.

Ah, thanks,
perhaps this only works with OpenMPI... I'll investigate whether I can use that. 
Paraview is hard as hell to build.

You shouldn't be tweaking the Cache! :-P It should work with openmpi,
mpich2, msmpi intel mpi etc.

Subject: [Paraview] Linking error when trying to use vtkGLSL/vtkXMLShader
Message-ID: <1319602303.98643.YahooMailNeo@web36506.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am currently trying to do some shader operations in a standard C++ filter. ?This filter (inherits from vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm, resides in VTK/Graphics) will be used to voxelize a polygonal object (basically the result of the contour filter) and write the results to a 3D texture.

I tried to do the following:
vtkXMLShader? ? ? *xmlShader? ? ? = vtkXMLShader::New();?
? vtkGLSLShader ? ? *glslShader ? ? = vtkGLSLShader::New(); ?

Which results in:
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
? "vtkXMLShader::New()", referenced from:
? ? ? vtkRepulsiveForceFieldGenerator::RequestData(vtkInformation*, vtkInformationVector**, vtkInformationVector*)in vtkRepulsiveForceFieldGenerator.cxx.o
? "vtkGLSLShader::New()", referenced from:
? ? ? vtkRepulsiveForceFieldGenerator::RequestData(vtkInformation*, vtkInformationVector**, vtkInformationVector*)in vtkRepulsiveForceFieldGenerator.cxx.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

I'm going to guess that standard filters can't use code like this, and that my filter should reside inside of the VTK/Rendering folder and follow the examples in that folder.

Thanks,
Sohail

The problem I think is that MPI_IN_PLACE is supported only by MPI-2
whereas your MPI library probably implements MPI 1.x.

MPI_IN_PLACE was not in IceT until PV 3.10.1. I had given up trying to
install PV 3.12 series on a supercluster that only has MPI 1.2 support
so would really appreciate if the MPI-2 dependence is removed by any
chance...

Richard

In an emergency, you can simply paste

#define MPI_IN_PLACE ((void *) 1)    

into files where you're getting a build error to shut the compiler up and produce a test build to work with.

If you're not actually using the functions, you won't get any run time errors. (of course, if you are using parallel compositing - in this case, you might indeed get problems).

MPI_IN_PLACE was not in IceT until PV 3.10.1. I had given up trying to
install PV 3.12 series on a supercluster that only has MPI 1.2 support
so would really appreciate if the MPI-2 dependence is removed by any
chance...

Message-ID: <055b01cc93de$802f2d60$808d8820$@gmail.com>

Dear all

I am a newbie to Linux.

I was trying to install paraview in a Linux based cluster.

 

I was following the instructions given in
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install . 

I am stuck at the point - Configure ParaView with Cmake. 

I am attaching the error I got while installing.

 

 

Can you please Let me know what I am doing incorrectly?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView GUI hanging in debug mode
Message-ID: <CD64319454914B16B09DF137CF7E507E@win.ara>


Dear All,

I'm trying to debug a parallel reader I am working on. I normally work with
gdb and ParaView in serial client-server mode, which works fine. However,
I'm now trying to debug the client-server mode when run in parallel using
MPICH2 and I'm encountering issues.

I've tried the following:

(1) Run parallel pvserver first -> attach gdb to a process id -> start
paraview client -> connect to server -> Result: client connected message
appears then the client hangs.

>>> mpirun -np 16 /path/to/ParaView-3.10.1-Debug/bin/pvserver
>>> gdb --pid xxxx
>>> paraview
>>> (connect to client)

(2) Run parallel pvserver first with gdb -> Result: pvserver does not start
properly (no port message or waiting for client).

>>> mpirun -np 16 gdb /path/to/ParaView-3.10.1-Debug/bin/pvserver
gdb>> run
>>> (server hangs)

I tried the second option just in case it worked, but I was sure (and
previous posts on the mailing lists showed) that the first option would
work. I am using ParaView 3.10.1 Release built on CentOS5.4 using standard
OS libraries with MPICH2.1.3.

Is there something I've done wrong here? Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Adriano

The FindGIT.cmake file is only available with cmake version 2.8.5 or above.

you are using cmake version 2.6.4 and you need to upgrade to a newer cmake.

Dear Jean,

I ahve downloaded and installed a newer version in a separate folder.
The installation guide says "Use ccmake (Curses CMake GUI) from the CMake
installed location. CCMake is a Curses based GUI for CMake. To run it go to
the build directory and specify as an argument the src directory".

I am not sure what it means. 
I have used the same set of commands  available.  But still only cmake
version 2.6 is called.  Can you pls explain me what the sentence means!!

Classes in graphics cannot depend on classes in rendering. You can move your filter to hybrid.

Hi Nenad,

I looked into the code and the behavior you are seeing is correct. So it is
not a bug but I think what you are asking is quite logicial.

Probably I need to put some logic in vtkCubeAxesRepresentation.  I will drop
another email once I have it working.

Best,

These are all good suggestions.  Thanks so much for the help everybody! 

Our mvapich MPI could easily be 1x instead of 2x.  
However, the good news is that by switching to OpenMPI and diddling with the CMakeCache.txt, I was able to get it to build including the MILI reader. 

As for not hacking the CMakeCache.txt, I much prefer that to endlessly iterating through the  obnoxious ccmake GUI.  Please forgive me, but I must vent:  
<rant>  CMake has to be one of the worst user experiences ever devised and brings very little to the table that I can see.  It's not even cross platform as its intended, AFAICT.  Here's my experience with it: 
1)  type a magic command line
2)  hit "configure".  Why doesn't cmake initialize itself?  Because. 
3)  Scan through the list of options, tediously enabling and disabling.   
4)  hit "configure" again to see more options.  If you're done configuring, go to 5, else go to 3. How do you know when you're done?  Experience.  No hint from the GUI.  No sanity checks. No "you're ready" message.  No summary.  No help at all!  Basically, ask a human.  
5)  Hit "generate."
6)  Kick off a build and wait for an error to show up that a decent sanity check would have caught.  
7)  Attempt to debug the error without any compile lines being shown.  Go back to the ccmake GUI and turn on VERBOSE build.  Since you changed something, every .o file is rebuilt from scratch.  Wait forever for the same error.  Go to #1

This process takes literally hours.  I have done it so many times I can do it in my sleep, but I still hate it.  Job security, I guess.  :-)
</rant>

I will pore through them and probably grab some help from Alan Scott if my latest efforts fail.

I don't really have a horse in the race here, but I've fought a lot with CMake and the old school Makefile/configure setup and CMake is infinitely better. To address your rant:

0. We've used it on every HPC system the DOD, DOE and NASA have to offer with no problems. Cray, IBM, SGI, our own in-house Linux clusters, no issues. 
1. ccmake is no more magic than ./configure
2. I suppose it could start configuring itself, never really thought about it. But it's nice that it doesn't sometimes when I accidentally go into cmake in a folder I didn't mean to.
3. Ever build a linux kernel? Paraview has nothing on that list of options. If you know what options you want turned on ahead of time, you can put -DOPTION=VALUE on the cmake command line, just as you would with ./configure --enable-OPTION
4. You know you're done configuring when new options that are *'d stop showing up at the top of the list. The "you're ready" message is when the g for generate pops up. 
5, 6. CMake is open source -- if there are basic sanity checks that are so trivial, contribute them and people will be glad to have them. 
7. You don't have to go back into ccmake to turn on verbose building. Just do make VERBOSE=1 and it will be plenty verbose. And it will pick up right where it left off. 

I'll admit there is a learning curve to using and writing CMake systems. But it's infintely less tedious for developers compared to autotools or writing your own Makefiles. It's also much nicer for users when there are tons of options than trying to specify them all on a command line to a configure script (and easier for us developers when users ask for a GUI to set options -- it's one less thing to write and debug). 

Maybe some of the above will make things easier for you, or maybe it won't, but that's what we've learned through this process.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview will not build

    I would have to offer that ParaView _can_ be a harsh introduction to CMake. If you are using CMake on a MUCH smaller project then learning CMake can have a much less steep learning curve. And in the end it is MUCH less time consuming for the developers to upkeep a few CMake files rather than have to upkeep 3 or 4 visual studio projects, an autotools for Linux and Xcode for OS X. Then add to that all the subtleties with cygwin, msys, HPC, MPI, other C/C++ Compilers, Fortran compilers and the endless list of other items and the ParaView developers have done an extraordinary job of keeping cross platform alive and kicking. 
  As to your rant, we have all been there. Ask questions on this list. Search Google/Bing/Yahoo. Hey, at least you can do it in your sleep now. ;-)

It's also much nicer for users when there are tons of options than trying to specify them all on a command line to a configure script (and easier for us developers when users ask for a GUI to set options -- it's one less thing to write and debug).

I usually do this:

cd ~/ # Go to my home directory
# Download CMake source
wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.6.tar.gz
tar -xzvf cmake-2.8.6.tar.gz # Extract CMake
mkdir cmake-2.8.6_build # make a cmake build directory
cd cmake-2.8.6_build # go into the build directory
ccmake ../cmake-2.8.6 # configure cmake with system cmake
make -j8 # build cmake in parallel
# you can run it from the build directory without installing

cd ~/ # Go to my home directory
# Download ParaView source
wget http://paraview.org/files/v3.12/ParaView-3.12.0-RC2.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ParaView-3.12.0-RC2.tar.gz # extract paraview
mkdir ParaView-3.12.0-RC2_build # make a ParaView build directory
cd ParaView-3.12.0-RC2_build/ # go into the build directory

# now this is the part where you seem to be confused
# configure ParaView with the CMake we just built
../cmake-2.8.6_build/bin/ccmake ../ParaView-3.12.0-RC2
make -j8 # build ParaView in parallel
bin/paraview # run paraview from the build directory

Sorry Jim, I wasn't trying to take a cheap shot. Anyway, I created a bug
report for fixing MPI 1 support in IceT and assigned it to Ken.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView GUI hanging in debug mode

When debugging in parallel you will need to start the job without gdb and
then connect individually to  each of the pvserver processes with gdb.

The other option is to use a parallel debugger such as DDT or totalview -
both are commercial but you can get a trial license. Note: I'm biased
towards DDT as I used to work for Allinea and was one of the original
developers!

The "Selection Inspector" of ParaView can probably do what you want:

We finally have Paraview working with the MILI reader.  It's glorious!  Thanks again for the help in making that happen.  

However, there is an error reading the data from our user.  I may have screwed up, or perhaps there is a bug in the reader. 
Is there someone that could help troubleshooting?  
What happens is "it seems to read the mili files and I can see the model and mesh but I most of the data is missing. No stresses/strains are showing in the data drop down. Let me know if you want me to send you a mili file to look at."
Help?  
Thank you!

With the pvserver all work fine.

  A other solution is: Don't use the pvx File.

Run only.

mpirun -machinefile servers.dat -np 4 ./pvdataserver
./pvrenderserver
./paraview

work.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with pvdataserver and pvrenderserver
Message-ID: <4EA85CFE.5070004@web.de>

Hi,

this is the way I start my paraview envirement.

(on a cluset)   mpirun -machinefile server.dat -np 4 ./pvdataserver
(on joker)  ./pvrenderserver
(world)     ./paraview

The problem is if the first node from the pvdataserver and the 
pvrenderserver are not on the same machine I get a connecting error if I 
connect with the client to both servers.
The dataserver can not connect to the renderserver, because the 
dataserver not use the ip (or hostname) of the renderserver e.g. 
joker:53652 instead the dataserver would connect to localhost:53652, but 
there is not server.
If I putdataserver (master) and renderserver on the same host the 
renderserver listen on localhost and can answere the connection entry of 
the dataserver.

How I can tell the dataserver on which host the renderserver listening. 
I would create a *.pvx file but if I do this I get problems with the 
cut/slice tool.

Gar.  I guess I should have been paying attention to this email thread.  I'll take a look at this.

I don't think I can easily replicate the compile problem.  Could someone (Rich?) please volunteer to accept a patch and attempt to compile it rather than have me spin my wheels trying to install an old version of MPI on something?

Sorry Jim, I wasn't trying to take a cheap shot. Anyway, I created a bug report for fixing MPI 1 support in IceT and assigned it to Ken.

   I would have to offer that ParaView _can_ be a harsh introduction to CMake. If you are using CMake on a MUCH smaller project then learning CMake can have a much less steep learning curve. And in the end it is MUCH less time consuming for the developers to upkeep a few CMake files rather than have to upkeep 3 or 4 visual studio projects, an autotools for Linux and Xcode for OS X. Then add to that all the subtleties with cygwin, msys, HPC, MPI, other C/C++ Compilers, Fortran compilers and the endless list of other items and the ParaView developers have done an extraordinary job of keeping cross platform alive and kicking.
 As to your rant, we have all been there. Ask questions on this list. Search Google/Bing/Yahoo. Hey, at least you can do it in your sleep now. ;-)

Message-ID: <CA+pnd0==HSXVzg65k=8tc2_v22QnLVm01tJcTmK3voTT=Q2W7A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have a very simple question. I have a regular need to measure the
distance between points in a grid. Is this possible?
If not, would it make a chance if I add to the feature request list?

Kind regards,

Marco

P.S. I would be happy to try to implement this myself, but I would
need some help to do this.

acceptable because we have to throw the whole cmake/make process in a

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter issue with modifying grid data
Message-ID: <CAGqbCOQju-ho7psSfLb73qmmag9FsV-W20xnyt9UixpBcuYXCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I am trying to write a programmable filter which will take my
RectilinearGrid data and modify one of the data arrays. Specifically I want
to sum over one dimension. I have written something to do this, but my data
comes out garbled.

Below is my code. Basically all I am doing is extracting all the data, doing
my sum over the z direction and then putting this data into another
rectilinear grid.


*data=self.GetInput()*
*out=self.GetOutput()*
*extent=data.GetExtent()*
*vtkVarray=data.GetPointData().GetArray('velocity')*
*
*
*import numpy*
*pyVarray_x = numpy.zeros([extent[1]+1,extent[3]+1,extent[5]+1])*
*pyVarray_y = numpy.zeros([extent[1]+1,extent[3]+1,extent[5]+1])*
*pyVarray_z = numpy.zeros([extent[1]+1,extent[3]+1,extent[5]+1])*
*
*
*for i in range(0,extent[1]+1):*
* for j in range(0,extent[3]+1):*
* for k in range(0,extent[5]+1):*
* tup=vtkVarray.GetTuple(i+j*(extent[1]+1)+k*(extent[1]+1)*(extent[3]+1))*
* pyVarray_x[i,j,k]=tup[0]*
* pyVarray_y[i,j,k]=tup[1]*
* pyVarray_z[i,j,k]=tup[2] *
*
*
*
*
*
*
*pyVarray_x_noz = numpy.zeros([extent[1]+1,extent[3]+1,1])*
*pyVarray_y_noz = numpy.zeros([extent[1]+1,extent[3]+1,1])*
*pyVarray_z_noz = numpy.zeros([extent[1]+1,extent[3]+1,1])*
*
*
*for i in range(0,extent[1]+1):*
* for j in range(0,extent[3]+1):*
* pyVarray_x_noz[i,j]=pyVarray_x[i,j,:].sum()*
* pyVarray_y_noz[i,j]=pyVarray_y[i,j,:].sum()*
* pyVarray_z_noz[i,j]=pyVarray_z[i,j,:].sum()*
*
*
*newArray=vtk.vtkDoubleArray()*
*newArray.SetName("test")*
*newArray.SetNumberOfComponents(3)*
*
*
*print newArray*
*
*
*for k in range(0,extent[5]+1):*
* for j in range(0,extent[3]+1):*
* for i in range(0,extent[1]+1):*
* tup0=pyVarray_x_noz[i,j]*
* tup1=pyVarray_y_noz[i,j]*
* tup2=pyVarray_z_noz[i,j]*
* tup=(tup0,tup1,tup2)*
* newArray.InsertNextTuple((tup0,tup1,tup2))*
*
*
*print newArray*
*print vtkVarray*
*
*
*out.GetCellData().AddArray(newArray)*
*
*
I have no idea whats going wrong with this. Any help is much appreciated,
new to using paraview.

Thanks, James

I?d just like to say using MPI_IN_PLACE is a great way of saving on memory copies and there is a reason why newer versions of MPI have it; it?s better.

Constantly making compromises to support old versions is (in my opinion) bad practice.
I?d vote (and I know that nobody agrees with me) to not support older MPI versions. Let people upgrade their MPI rather than bloat code by patching for this.

I feel quite strongly about this and will happily contribute a CMake check for MPI_IN_PLACE which will tell the user at cmake time that their MPI is unsupported and they need to upgrade.

hello,

You can select the two points (with the control key for the second 
point), then extract them with the Extract Selection.
And Finally in the information tab, you can see the bounds of the box 
(and the delta).

Dear Felipe,

Thanks for your answer. It does work, but it does not provide you
directly with the distance between the two points.
It provides deltas in each of the X,Y,Z coordinate directions. I was
looking for a slightly more intuitive way like just clicking
two points.

Regards,

Marco

Thanks, Paul. I still can't stop it hanging, but I've resolved the bug I was
tracking anyway.
 
We have some totalview licences here, but I tend to prefer gdb. I remember
you saying you worked on DDT. Nothing like favouritism!

When debugging in parallel you will need to start the job without gdb and
then connect individually to  each of the pvserver processes with gdb.

The other option is to use a parallel debugger such as DDT or totalview -
both are commercial but you can get a trial license. Note: I'm biased
towards DDT as I used to work for Allinea and was one of the original
developers!

Dear All,

I'm trying to debug a parallel reader I am working on. I normally work with
gdb and ParaView in serial client-server mode, which works fine. However,
I'm now trying to debug the client-server mode when run in parallel using
MPICH2 and I'm encountering issues.

I've tried the following:

(1) Run parallel pvserver first -> attach gdb to a process id -> start
paraview client -> connect to server -> Result: client connected message
appears then the client hangs.

>>> mpirun -np 16 /path/to/ParaView-3.10.1-Debug/bin/pvserver
>>> gdb --pid xxxx
>>> paraview
>>> (connect to client)

(2) Run parallel pvserver first with gdb -> Result: pvserver does not start
properly (no port message or waiting for client).

>>> mpirun -np 16 gdb /path/to/ParaView-3.10.1-Debug/bin/pvserver
gdb>> run
>>> (server hangs)

I tried the second option just in case it worked, but I was sure (and
previous posts on the mailing lists showed) that the first option would
work. I am using ParaView 3.10.1 Release built on CentOS5.4 using standard
OS libraries with MPICH2.1.3.

Is there something I've done wrong here? Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Adriano

I just testing connecting to a running pvserver and it works ok for me - are
you continuing the gdb process after you attach?

There's a ruler source that you can use to determine the distance
between two locations.

No, I wasn't. Applying the "continue" command fixed the non-issue. Thanks,

I just testing connecting to a running pvserver and it works ok for me - are

We have some totalview licences here, but I tend to prefer gdb. I remember
you saying you worked on DDT. Nothing like favouritism!

When debugging in parallel you will need to start the job without gdb and
then connect individually to  each of the pvserver processes with gdb.

The other option is to use a parallel debugger such as DDT or totalview -
both are commercial but you can get a trial license. Note: I'm biased
towards DDT as I used to work for Allinea and was one of the original
developers!

Paul

Dear All,

I'm trying to debug a parallel reader I am working on. I normally work with
gdb and ParaView in serial client-server mode, which works fine. However,
I'm now trying to debug the client-server mode when run in parallel using
MPICH2 and I'm encountering issues.

I've tried the following:

(1) Run parallel pvserver first -> attach gdb to a process id -> start
paraview client -> connect to server -> Result: client connected message
appears then the client hangs.

>>> mpirun -np 16 /path/to/ParaView-3.10.1-Debug/bin/pvserver
>>> gdb --pid xxxx
>>> paraview
>>> (connect to client)

(2) Run parallel pvserver first with gdb -> Result: pvserver does not start
properly (no port message or waiting for client).

>>> mpirun -np 16 gdb /path/to/ParaView-3.10.1-Debug/bin/pvserver
gdb>> run
>>> (server hangs)

I tried the second option just in case it worked, but I was sure (and
previous posts on the mailing lists showed) that the first option would
work. I am using ParaView 3.10.1 Release built on CentOS5.4 using standard
OS libraries with MPICH2.1.3.

Is there something I've done wrong here? Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Adriano

Hey Ken, I just built mpich1 on a linux machine of mine and recreated the
compile error. Feel free to send me patches to try.

I would agree if we were talking about a "user level" library. Often MPI
isn't. Upgrading it is not option for many users stuck on older systems.

Subject: [Paraview] Segmentation fault when clipping Polyhedra
In-Reply-To: <1319459140.13286.25.camel@aia065.aia.RWTH-Aachen.de>
References: <1319459140.13286.25.camel@aia065.aia.RWTH-Aachen.de>

Hi Lennart,

Your file seems correct, especially because saving it again as VTU from
ParaView yields basically the same file.

I could reproduce the segfault with ParaView git/master as follows:
 * Load file
 * Filters - Clip
   Clip Type: Plane
   Origin: 0.3, 0.5, 0.5
   Normal: 1, 0, 0
   Tick "Inside Out" checkbox
   Apply
(One may need to toggle the checkbox a couple of times and pressing
Apply each time after toggling until the segfault gets triggered.)

=> 0x00007fffdf00166a in vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::InsertPolygonInHash
(this=0x2a09270, ids=0x2bd7cb0, numPts=0, sourceId=0)
    at /opt/ParaView3.git/VTK/Graphics/vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter.cxx:1797
1797      quad = *end;
(gdb) list 1794
1789      vtkIdType* tab = new vtkIdType[numPts];
1790      for(int i=0; i<numPts; i++)
1791        {
1792        tab[i] = ids[(offset+i)%numPts];
1793        }
1794
1795      // Look for existing hex in the hash;
1796      end = this->QuadHash + tab[0];
1797      quad = *end;
(gdb) print numPts
$1 = 0
(gdb) print tab[0]
$1 = -614752568

The segfault is triggered by the variable 'numPts' being zero which
causes the for-loop in line 1790 being skipped such that the array 'tab'
is not initialized, but still queried at position 0 in line 1796. So,
'end' points to some random location in memory and dereferencing it in
line 1797 causes the segfault.
I'm not familiar with the algorithm implemented here, so I'm not sure
whether a feasible way of avoiding this issue would be to skip execution
of InsertPolygonInHash() altogether if numPts <= 0. Someone on this list
will know.
Probably best if you'd file a bug report at http://www.paraview.org/Bug/

Thanks. That seems to do the trick.? The only other issue is the rendering context.? I've used the line integral convolution/lic filters as an example, and it seems like I need a "SetContext" function, which is passed a pointer to an (new) allocated vtkRenderWindow object.? For reference, I am looking at vtkImageDataLIC2D.cxx. 


I will then need to downcast this object to a vtkOpenGLRenderWindow and pass it to? vtkShaderProgram2, which requires a proper context...well I've done all of that, and so far I've noticed that a new (small, blacked out) window with the title "Visualization Toolkit" pops up when I start my filter.? Now I have to do something with this fragment shader (which currently does nothing).


Am I on the right track here? Or I am issuing an improper context?


Sohail

Classes in graphics cannot depend on classes in rendering. You can move your filter to hybrid.?

In general you can't assume that extent[0] = extent[2] = extent[4] = 0.
Maybe it is for your data sets but it is not required.

I didn't fully go through your code to debug but I am working on a filter
that does a similar operation in either the x, y, or z topological
direction.  It also works in parallel as well as for both image data and
rectilinear grids.  It still needs some tweaking before it goes into
paraview (right now it averages in each direction instead of sums but
that's an easy tweak to allow the user to do either).  It also does it for
all of the point and cell arrays.  I hope to have it in paraview in the
next couple of weeks.

Message-ID: <CAHDyfPBU=EnCMNAVTta9Zfr4rx-2-YLMdifgKYHvE7O5cZif0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
It is very useful to clip any object in the ParaView. But, it would be
more useful if an option was available so that the user could cap a
clipped polydata with a polygon, like a VTK Example:
(http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Meshes/CapClip).
Is there a way (or a feature) to clip with capping in ParaView?

Thanks,
yoshimi

Message-ID: <FC17C27D1141BF4C945453BACB1CB1D10F7DBD@GLKMS2100.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi,

 

I already have an established reader that reads in our bespoke format
and converts it to a vtkUnstructuredGrids so that I can view it in
Paraview. Furthermore a filter then reads in a solution file in a
bespoke format and shows the cell data from the CFD solution. This works
great, happy days.  However, I now need to show data on the faces on the
vtkUnstructuredGrid, a metric.  I have two problems, no idea how to set
this given the above setup, and two, to compute the metric I could do
with the following type of access:

 

Loop over all faces of vtkUnstructuredGrid

                

                Get the face centre

                Get the Left cell centre

                Get the Right cell centre

 

                Do some stuff.....

 

                Set a scale on the face to be a number based on the
stuff

 

Finish

 

I have no idea how to access the vtkUnstructuredGrid in the above to
pattern???


Can anybody help, it would be very useful... examples more than welcome.


Cheers,

Andy

Hi,

You haven't configured your output, assuming rectilinear grid you need 
to set the extent and provide coordinate arrays.

You are indexing a point based array with cell based index, so the 
lookup you make into vtkVarray is incorrect. 'Extent' tells you the 
number of cells, not the number of points, for that use 'Dimensions' or 
add one in each direction. Your script would certainly be more readable 
if you used some variables such as:

ncx = ext[1]-ext[0]+1
ncy = ext[3] -ext[2] +1
ncxy = nx*ny
ncz = ext[5]-ext[4] +1
cidx = k*nxy + j*nx+i

for number of cells and a cell array index.

In the two first loops you are treating 'i' as the slowest changing 
direction when it is the fastest. That will kill your performance. Last 
loop has correct order.

You may want to avoid the range function in your loop since if my 
recollection is correct that explicitly constructs a list of values.

I hope this is helpful.

You can use the calculator filter to call it a different name.

Subject: [Paraview] threshold filter for vector magnitudes?
Message-ID: <CAK6Z60dQCKKaZKGK3DoCu9q8vxmcoLnBdwPVAA2Zohv3aeotwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have some Exodus files with complex-values on unstructured grids.
The complex values are represented as vectors of size 2. By default,
ParaView shows the Magntite of the "vectors" (equals the absolute
value of the complex number).

What I would like to have is a threshold plot of where the magnitude
sits between certain values. So far, it seems, the interface only
allows for threshold plots for actual (real-valued) scalar data, not
for magnitudes of vectors and such.

Would there be a way around this restriction?

Cheers,
Nico

Since 3.10 there is an Auto Convert Properties preference/setting that
will expose the vector magnitude so that you can filter on it.
Otherwise, and in previous versions, you would do it by using the
calculator filter to calculate the magnitude and threshold based on
that.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 3.12.0 RC-3 available for download
Message-ID: <CAPxbyhyCUAXBV+26fhkd8czS-yO0K12MAjLzJU+ZYj9TkYhekg@mail.gmail.com>

 The ParaView team is pleased to announce the availability of the ParaView
3.12.0 Release Candidate 3 binaries for download on the ParaView (
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html). ParaView 3.12 can be
considered as a bug-fix release with over 180 issues resolved. The detailed
list can be found at
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php?version_id=85.

With Python being one of the preferred means of interacting with ParaView,
we've added support to create animation tracks that use Python scripts to
build highly customized animations.

Plugins support is one of the strong points of ParaView and with this
release, we've made it easier to load deployed plugins on the server
processes as well. All distributed plugins are now listed on the client as
well as the server side.

The release includes updates to LANL's streaming framework.
The multiresolution streaming view now automatically adjusts resolution
to match the projected image size. Also, VTK filters are now able to modify
meta-information which means they can modify the data while still allowing
the streaming framework to cull and prioritize pieces. An example is a new
spherical warp filter that projects flat data onto the globe while correctly
tracking piece bounding boxes.

Also, there are updates to support users of the cosmology and windblade
formats. For example the MaskPoints filter (used to place glyphs and in
other places) was updated with new options that improve random sampling in
parallel. Likewise VTK's Gaussian Splatter filter is now exposed in ParaView
which makes it easy to visualize point set data with imaging filters. The
cosmo and windblade readers have also been revised.

This version includes some major changes under the covers. ParaView 3.12
includes improvements to the underpinnings of ParaView ServerManager. The
communication layer under the ParaView ServerManager was upgraded to
minimize communication as well as making it easier to debug and trace
messages being exchanged between client and server. We now use
Google Protocol Buffers, for example, to exchange messages between client
and server.

In addition, there are several small but notable improvements included in
this release for example, the views now use caching to avoid re-renders from
repaints due to menus and dialogs popup up on the screen; volume rendering
of uniform grids now supports shading; ability to enable specular highlights
when using scalar coloring and others.

The updated userguide can be accessed at:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents
Or in PDF form at:
http://paraview.org/files/v3.12/ParaView%20Users%20Guide%20v3.12.pdf

The development team has adopted a git-workflow-based development process
that is integrated with the ParaView Bug Tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug).
The workflow enables us to track every change that goes into ParaView and
maintain a stable repository.

Additionally, the following issues have been addressed since RC2.

12670 SPTimeseries tests failing
12636 fix incompatibility with OCCT 6.5.2
12678 Build issues using external png on OSX
12667 cross compilation fails
12671 Prism now working correctly in client-server mode.
12630 Default PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES to OFF
12652 coprocessing writers menu is not enabled after creating a filter and
hitting the Apply button
12650 Multiple file plot over line seg faults
12651 Crash toggling displayed variables plot over line.
12638 ServerConfiguration XML (PVSC) not correctly using random default
values.
12626 remove cosmo plugin

Hi,

Thanks for your help both of you.

Cheers for pointing out my Cell-Point mistake Burlen, I actually am
increasing my extents (extent[1]+1 for example) to compensate for this, but
I did make a mistake in my final call

*out.GetCellData().AddArray(newArray)*
*
*
which should be getting PointData, not CellData. My filter now works as
planned :)

However I am interested in some of your comments. Being a new
Python/Paraview/VTK programmer I would appreciate a bit of further advice:

In the two first loops you are treating 'i' as the slowest changing

I agree that i should be the fastest changing index in some sense, but
because I have to step over all values of i,j,k to read the entire array
into my python array, I don't see why any other looping direction would be
quicker?

You may want to avoid the range function in your loop since if my
> recollection is correct that explicitly constructs a list of values


I think you're right, it does seem to construct a list explicitly, but I
don't really know what the alternative is?

Thanks again.

Looking forward to seeing that new filter built in!

yes you added one. that is needed to compute the number of cells from 
the extents. you still need to add one to the result (the number of 
cells) to get the number of points. As is, you are not looking up the 
values you think you are in your input array. You won't crash since 
you'll stay within the point array bounds.

for cells compute the number of them like this:

    ncx = ext[1]-ext[0]+1
    ncy = ext[3]-ext[2]+1
    ncxy = ncx*ncy
    ncz = ext[3]-ext[2]+1

and in your loop index a cell at i,j,k like this:

    cidx = k*ncxy + j*ncx+i

For points compute the number of them like this:

    npx = ncx+1
    npy = ncy+1
    npxy = npx*npy
    npz = ncz+1

and in your loop index a point at i,j,k like this:

    pidx = k*npxy + j*npx+i

This has to do with the cache inside your cpu. When you use a memory 
location the cpu automatically loads the adjacent locations(a cache 
line) into the cache. In memory i direction changes fastest, meaning 
location (i+1,j,k) is adjacent following location (i,j,k). when you 
access the adjacent memory locations in your loops sequentially your 
data are more likely to be in the cache and hence a faster. On the other 
hand memory location (i,j,k+1) is npx*npy elements away from location 
(i,j,k). That's usually quite a number of cache lines away and hence 
less likely to already be in the cache resulting in a cache miss. 
Execution stalls while the cpu loads the cache line. the cache is fairly 
small so a cache miss likely results in some data being evicted to make 
room for the new data. When this happens on every array access it's 
called thrashing.This is what happens when you use the wrong order in 
your loops.

I am not a great python programmer, but one way would be to use a while 
loop:

k=ext[4]
while(k<=ext[5]):
#
   j=ext[2]
   while(j<=ext[3]):
   #
     i=ext[0]
     while(i<=ext[1]):
     #
         pidx = k*npxy + j*npx+i
         # do something here
         i+=1
     #
     j+=1
   #
   k+=1
#

You are on the right track. And indeed use vtkShaderProgram2 (similar
to LIC) and not the XMLShaders.

Hi,

Please accept my apologies if this message has reached you before (I sent a
similar reply to the 3.12RC2 announcement but it seems to have been
rejected from the list due to file size).

When I try and load an ascii .vtu file with multiple 'pieces' (to account
for multiple separate meshes), the 3.12 versions crash with a segmentation
fault on Ubuntu 11.04 Linux 64 bit (using the provided binaries from the
site). Such files have never been a problem before (versions 3.2 - 3.10.1).
I attached a smaller example this time.

Kind regards,
Ivo

Message-ID: <BLU139-W21B2B7EA8D4C5591A97CA3CDD10@phx.gbl>






Hi all,
I am trying to run a script to obtain images from different data sets. The resolution I am getting from the server is poor. I want to know how to obtain better resolution for my images. 
I read that increasing the "Number of Peels" should help with my issue but I cant seem to edit it from the Paraview GUI and dont know how to access it from the python shell.
Attached are the script Im using, an image done by using pvbatch and an image done connected from the client, which has a better resolution. 
Thanks,
Tony

Hi,

 

I have to be honest so far there has been no solution/suggestions to the problem I posed.  I am particularly interested in the access pattern I described, but also the ability to be able to add a scale to faces of a 3d unstructured mesh, which I can then cut.

 

Any help would be great, I should imagine this is of interest to a lot of people.

 

Andy

I have the same problem 
I dont know how to export data on surfaces like wall faces through vtk , as vtk is a bulk reader

Suppose I want to show data on wall zones,inlet zones,outlet ,  no idea how to show that.
IF you solved ur problem please post the solution

Hi,

 

I already have an established reader that reads in our bespoke format and converts it to a vtkUnstructuredGrids so that I can view it in Paraview. Furthermore a filter then reads in a solution file in a bespoke format and shows the cell data from the CFD solution. This works great, happy days.  However, I now need to show data on the faces on the vtkUnstructuredGrid, a metric.  I have two problems, no idea how to set this given the above setup, and two, to compute the metric I could do with the following type of access:

 

Loop over all faces of vtkUnstructuredGrid

                

                Get the face centre

                Get the Left cell centre

                Get the Right cell centre

 

                Do some stuff?..

 

                Set a scale on the face to be a number based on the stuff

 

Finish

 

I have no idea how to access the vtkUnstructuredGrid in the above to pattern???


Can anybody help, it would be very useful? examples more than welcome.


Cheers,

Andy

Hi Andy,

Given your unstructured volume mesh, M, one way to achieve what you
describe is the following:

(1) Construct a vtkUnstructureGrid instance, F(M), consisting of the
faces of M, i.e., each cell in F(M) is a facet in M.
(2) Build auxiliary arrays for each cell in F(M) to store which cells
in M the face is adjacent to.

I think you can do this in one loop and it should be sufficient for
the operations you want to perform, e.g., interpolate to the face etc.

Let me know if you need more help to get started on this.

Best,
George

Hi,

Ok so basically I need to build and store the connectivity for the face-cell for the graph, fine I can do that no problems (a mapping of faces to left and right adjacent cells).  But what about actually adding a scalar for each cell (a face of M) to the new mesh F(M)?  Can I do that, can that scalar then be visualized?   

Reason for scalar: Basically I have a very large unstructured mesh, and in the solver a flag is used, this scalar that I want to view, has a value on each face.  I wish to see that in the mesh and how it change to understand the behavior of the solver, hence I want to see each face value, no interpolation, just the value in the solver, on the face of the mesh.

Assuming the answer is yes to the above, another question I have is, what structure to I hand back to paraview?  The input will be M, in the form of a vtkUnstructuredGrid, I still want to see that data on M, but I need to return F(M), a new mesh, looking identical, but having data on its cells (the faces of M) so that I can look at this single lowly scalar.  How do I do this?  Is this not a massive waste of memory?   I need to build additional connectivity information for M, which is probably already there inside paraview I assume, I can't believe it can't map faces to adjacent cells, plus store a new mesh F(M), just so I can see the data on the faces....?  Why did face normals get a special treatment, and for all other face data this has been totally missed?

Confused, 

Thanks in advance,
Andy

Hi Andy,

I tried to address your questions below

First, the reason for extracting F(M) is that we don't have FaceData
and so, we need to work with PointData and CellData. Since F(M) stores
faces as cells, you can add scalars by just adding cell data to F(M).
This in effect will give you face data on M and you will be able to
visualize it in ParaView.

You could open both files. It is going to require more memory of
course, but, it is not much different from storing the face data
internally.

Is this not a massive waste of memory? ? I need to build additional
connectivity information for M, which is probably already there inside
paraview I assume, I can't believe it can't map faces to adjacent
cells, plus store a new mesh F(M), just so I can see the data on the
faces....? ?Why did face normals get a special treatment, and for all
other face data this has been totally missed?

Take a look at http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGrid.html
-- There are some methods that you can use in your implementation.
Again the reason that we need to do that is that ParaView/VTK
currently works with PointData and CellData.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. I'd be
glad to help more with this.

Best,
George

True using the following:

WriteImage("/tmp/foo.png", Magnification=2)

You can specify any Magnification >= 1.

You can also change the default view size in Python using:
view = GetActiveView()
view.ViewSize = [ 800, 800 ]

Thanks Ivo. I was able to reproduce the problem. I would like to add a
regression test to VTK for this type of files. Can I use your sample
dataset and add it to the VTKData (and/or ParaViewData) repositoriies?

Hi Karl,

thank you for verifying the issue. I followed your suggestion and
reported the bug (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12689).
I just noticed that the example contains three redundant points, the
removal of which does not affect the crashing of Paraview though.

Message-ID: <CAMfhe-tPYdUDHFGSg3rxi=voeELwbHMOV-NOXsggJtp+FQUh0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Has anyone been able to configure the RDAV server to connect ParaView to
NICS Nautilus on OS X Lion?  The latest version of ParaView that works with
Lion is not the one listed on the RDAV wiki, so I'm anticipating a
compatibility issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Interpolate data from an unstructured mesh to a
	structured one
Message-ID: <201110311848.51429.archaerolog@mail.ru>

Hello!

I have an interesting task -- I need to move the cell data from an unstructured mesh to 
corresponding cartesian mesh. Original domain is an alpha-degree 3D sector (alpha is a 
parameter, sector' angle, may be pi/3, pi/4, ...) with periodic side boundaries and 
unstructured discretization (hexahedral and wedge cells). The target domain is a cube that 
contains the whole cylinder (sum of N sectors: N*alpha = 2*pi). And my task is to generate 
cartezian mesh in the target domain (cube) and interpolate data from the original mesh to 
the cartezian.

I'm almost sure about answer, but I must ask: is there a combination of filters that can do 
the trick?

I think to write a python script that can do this, but I don't know how to:
a) create a cartezian mesh and
b) iterate throw mesh cells and their nodes.

You are correct. Doesn't look like nautilus sysadmins have installed
PV 3.10.1. However, 3.12 is soon to be out the door and I'm sure the
setup on nautilius will follow soon there after.

You might be interested in the code at:
https://github.com/berkgeveci/ComparativeVis

It has a filter called Cross Mesh Field Evaluation which maps a
property from a unstructured mesh
onto a structured mesh in parallel.

Ivo,

The bug should be fixed in 3.12. I've pushed a fix to the git
repository http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12690

pvx is indeed the way to tell data-server about the render server
nodes. What are the problems you are facing with the cut/slice tool?

Still the same on RC3.  Any chance this could be fixed before release?  It's 
going to require a kludge at the moment for my Fedora packages.
