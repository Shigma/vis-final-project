I am succesful reading legacy binary unstructured files in PV 2.4.2.
Your error looks like some n.elem. is not set right. Send me an example
file.

Sounds like your mpi has a built-in limit. Is this mpich? Maybe there 
are some mpis without this limitation. We use lam and haven't seen this 
limitation (but have only gone up to 10Mb or so messages sizes)

Subject: [Paraview] How to save points from a cut
Message-ID: <20060301115515.b8lwxliigsg88gw4@www.astro.helsinki.fi>

Hello!

This is probably a newbie question, but I simply do not find the answer 
myself.
I am  running paraview on linux, open a vtk file, the header of the 
file I am opening looks like that:
ASCII                     DATASET POLYDATA          POINTS   10818  float

What I would like to do, is to store the points and triangles after I 
have cut this object in to a file, which has plain text, as it was the 
case for the input file. The problem, I have is that I do not find the 
setting to change the encoding of the save-format to the format where 
the points are stored in ASCII text.
Is this possible? What I get, if I store the results of the cut in a 
file I allways get the encoded data <AppendedData encoding="base64">, 
which I can not process further.
I really tried all the formats like vtk, pvd, ply etc, but all of them 
store the data somehow encoded.

Thanks very much!

Save the file as legacy, but AFAIR this will give you a binary file. But
this you can already read yourself (will be big endian) - or use a
simple TCL script or C++ code to convert it to ASCII.

Subject: [Paraview] Surface vector - Linear Integral Convolution
Message-ID: <1141229208.5072.153.camel@localhost>

Hello list,

this topic has appeared before on the mailing list and I was able to
help someone who asked how to visualize surface vectors confined on a
surface (e.g. skin friction). Back then I suggested to constrain the
vector field to be parallel to the surface and then visualize the field
using glyphs or streamlines. That's what I've been doing so far (with
pretty bad results), but recently I came across:

LIC (Line Integral Convolution) is a well-known texture-based method
which, presented by Cabral and Leedom of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.

So I am wondering if anybody on this list (from LLNL?) knows if LIC has
been implemented into Paraview or VTK.

Is there maybe an other method for visualizing in a smart way surface
vectors?


Thanks, Simone

Subject: [Paraview] New Data Analysis filters in ParaView.
Message-ID: <4405C7B2.2050908@kitware.com>

Hi,

We've added a new "Data Analysis" filter to ParaView. This can be
treated as a filter combining both, Pick and Probe filters currently in
ParaView. Here's a brief description of this filter.

"Query Method" controls the behavior of this filter. Following are the
options:
* Point :-- output is point data interpolated at the choosen world point.
* Cell  :-- output is cell data of the cell nearest to the choosen world
point.
* Line  :-- output is point data interpolated along the sample points on
the line.
* Cell Id :-- output is cell data for the cell with the given Id.
* Point Id :-- output is point data for the point with the given Id.


When this filter is connected to a pipeline with a reader with time
support, "Temporal plotting" GUI is shown. Unlike with Pick/Probe where
one has to explicitly play the animation to generate plot over time;
with the Data Analysis filter, one can generate the plot over time by
simply clicking the "Generate" button in the "Temporal Parameters"
frame. One can also change the time steps for which the plot is
generated. To freeze the generated temporal plot for changes to the
pipeline, simply enable the "Lock" check mark. Not that the lock is
cleared when one changes the "Query Method".

It's also possible to change the properties of the plot such as titles,
title positions, number of labels, label formats, 'minor' tick marks etc.

Additionally, now one can change the colors assigned to the curves for
each array.

Utkarsh,

what about a naive brute force: export your data to a file such that the
vectors are non-zero only at the boundary?

The cause:
VTK is flipping the order of the bytes of the binary data.

I added print statements in the VTK code right after the vertices and cell 
connections were read. They are fine at that point. But VTK goes on to uses 
routines like vtkByteSwap::Swap4BERange. Additional print statements show 
that the data is then wrong.

Why is this swapping going on? Its a waste of time and turns good data into 
bad. Is there a way to turn it off?

Thanks!

LIC has been implemented for VTK (by Jean Favre). I am ashamed to
admit that  I still have not added it to VTK. However, this algorithm
works only on flat surfaces. Would this be enough?

I believe VTK expects binary files to be written as big endian. I
don't think there is a way of getting around this. You have to swap as
you are writing out.

Subject: [Paraview] Extension to EnSight readers to read nfaced elements
Message-ID: <1141435002.18210.40.camel@newhon.site>

Hello,

I modified VTK's EnSight Gold readers (binary and text) to read
EnSight's "nfaced" (convex polyhedra) element types
(using VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET).

The modified files (based on the current CVS head) are at the
following URL hoping that they may good enough for inclusion in
ParaView/VTK:

http://yvan.fournier.free.fr/paraview/nfaced/index.html

As EnSight's nfaced elements are defined by n polygonal faces,
vertices appear in an element's node list once per face to which
they belong. This does not seem to be the case with
VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET, so I used a nodeMarker array, initialized to
-1 for each node. Looping on elements, when a node is first used
for a given element, its marker value is set to the current
element index, so if we encounter it again for this element,
seeing that its marker value is not lower than the current
element index, we know that it has already been counted.

This seems to work fine.

For the Ensight Gold text reader, I had to add a "ElementIdsListed"
member to the "vtkEnSightGoldReader" class (similar to the one
used in "vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader"), because the method used
for polygons ("nsided") to skip optional element ids was not
extensible to polyhedra. In the vtk_EnSight_minimal_changes.tar.gz
version of the modified files, this member is only used for
polyhedra. In the vtk_EnSight.tar.gz version, it is also
used for polygons, for consistency (and simplification). Further
cleanup would be possible, but I would rather check first that
the modifications are OK for inclusion in ParaView.

Everything seems to work fine, except for "cell centers" outside
the VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET (which I suspect is an unrelated
bug). "shrink" shows cells having the correct shape.

I also include test data including "nfaced" elements (in both
text and little-endian binary).

Hoping this is can be useful (it is for us).

      This is probably due to a strict interpretation of the
      EnSight documentation, in which nsided elements seem
      to be defined in an clockwise (counter direct trigonometric
      order) manner. The last time I checked (building an
      elevated surface depending on face normals), EnSight
      did not in fact seem to use an inverse order, but the
      direct trigonometric order, so the node order of
      polygons read from EnSight into VTK should probably be reversed
      (I can check again if anyone is interested).

I came across Jean's filter last week and already compiled it.
After also recompiling Paraview 2.4.2 (shared libs!), PVLEA works fine
with the sample vf.xx.vti files.

Had to play around a bit with the settings, but now I get it working as
I want it!


As Berk says, the filter can only handle 2d, planar surfaces, but I have
3D RANS, Ensight datasets that I would like to unleash LIC on! Even if I
make a cut plane, the LEA filter is grayed out. I think it should be due
to the unstructured mesh of the cut.

What I'd need is the possibility to visualize surface-bound vectors
(skin friction coefficient in 3 directions) ... obviously on non-planar
surfaces! It seems that it's not possible right now. Does somebody
(Jean?) have thought of generalizing the filter?


Thanks, Simone

Subject: [Paraview] Animation Interpolation
Message-ID: <20060308105217.k6uobkmvmssck808@webmail.ualberta.ca>

Hi there,

I have a series of data files composed of large numbers of points in an 
unstructured grid.

Is there any way to get Paraview to interpolate between the location of 
each point as I progress through the data files in an animation? When I 
try to do this (change the 'Filename' attribute in the animation 
track), Paraview just changes data files at the keyframe, and does no 
interpolation. What I am going for is a smooth movement of the points 
from data file to data file to show how they are moving in the 
simulation.

I am running parallel Paraview 2.0, release 2, on windows XP.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Here is brief introduction to server manager (the user's guide has
more information I believe):

ParaView works in client/server. Because of this, it is not always
possible for the client to access vtk objects directly (some of them
reside on the server). Instead of directly accessing vtk objects, the
client code accesses proxies manager by the server manager code. A
proxy is a client-side representation of a distributed object. It has
properties. These can be set (or get). Once properties are set, they
can be pushed to the server. For example:

# get the proxy from the server manager
coneProxy = proxyManager.GetProxy("sources", "myCone")
# get a property to set
res = coneProxy.GetProperty("PhiResolution")
# set the resolution (not pushed to the server yet)
res.SetElement(0, 24)
# push changes to the server
coneProxy.UpdateVTKObjects()

Proxy and properties are described in XML files that are in
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/. It is also possible to load more XML
files at run-time or compile them in. To set the eye angle, you first
have to add the appropriate property to the appropriate XML file. This
is a bit more tricky than simple sources and filters because all
global rendering parameters used in paraview is encapsulated in a
proxy call render module. This is a complicated, compound proxy (with
bunch of sub-proxies). Anyway, the following change to rendering.xml
should expose SetEyeAngle (based on current cvs):

I dont think so but I would also wish there was no need for double

he just doesnt find init.tcl in the places he looks into. I had this

I can have access to
1. velocity vectors on several time step (I can use to see steamlines)
2. a file with the particles positions per time step.

Can I load in Paraview, my file (2.) to see my particles along the time

Hi Thierry,

Good question; I've wanted to do something similiar with time-varying 
velocities but feel we should both wait, if possible, for reasons I'll 
mention below.

There might be some confusion about the words. Here's a web page from 
Purdue that seems to do a good job of explaining streamlines, pathlines and 
streaklines (note: I don't see the Java applet that they mention).

   https://widget.ecn.purdue.edu/~meapplet/java/flowvis/Index.html

With a steady flow all are the same. The fact that you have new velocities 
at every time step indicates that you are looking at an unsteady flow where 
the 3 methods differ.

ParaView currently only supports streamlines which are not appropriate for 
unsteady flow. At best, you'd need to be very careful how you interpret 
what you see.

Time-varying velocity information could be viewed with a pathlines filter. 
The only little problem is that the VTK pipeline currently works with 
information from only one time step.

However, I understand that there is a group of VTK/ParaView developers that 
are working on a general facility for time-varying data. In addition to 
pathlines there are, I suspect, a number of other methods that need data 
from more than one time step.

If you are reading this note and are a member of this group, working on 
time-varying data, I would really appreciate you jumping in to let us all 
know the status of that effort. Can we expect to see pathlines soon? Do you 
need help?

Subject: [Paraview] help vtk
Message-ID: <1141917571.1689.20.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hallo to all,

I am studying paraview from two days, and would want to visualize in its
monitor the result of mine files vtk. I have adapted mine files vtk,
eliminating the function that creates me the visualization monitor, but
do not obtain the intentional result.
Then I have thought to an alternative, I would have to export from vtk,
the scene obtained in rows of points and then to make to read this last
file in paraview?


Thanks Dina.

Did you install paraview or just copy the binary somewhere? What
happens if you run paraview typing the full path?

We just started working on it. We don't have a clear plan of attack
yet. I'll try to keep you posted.

It is not. It used to be but we ran into too many problems with people
using the wrong versions of Tcl/Tk and VTK. We stopped supporting it.

I think I know what is wrong but I'll need your help to confirm my 
hypothesis.  Please go to the build tree and run "cmake ." to 
reconfigure the project.  I bet the setting in vtkConfigure.h will 
magically change and the macro will be defined.

Let me know whether that works.  If it does then I should be able to fix 
things so the problem does not happen again.

Thanks,

I saw this and the variable below helped.  I have no idea if it's the
correct thing to do.

	--latest error
Message-ID: <200603091451.55369.msh@cvu.wustl.edu>

To get paraview to compile I edited my .bashrc file and added:

	CXX=/usr/bin/g++
	export CXX
	CC=/usr/bin/cc
	export CC

cc make reports the following error:

	VTK specific hacks go here in VTKCompatibility
 
	It is impossible to order the linker search path in such a 
	way that libraries specified as full paths will be picked by 
	the  linker.
	Directories and libraries involved are:
	Directory: /usr/X11R6/lib64 contains:
	Library: /usr/lib64/libGL.so
	Library: /usr/lib64/libGLU.so
	
	Directory: /usr/lib64 contains:
	Library: /usr/X11R6/lib64/libX11.so
	Library: /usr/X11R6/lib64/libXext.so

I compiled anyway and typed paraview from a command shell and got:

	bash-3.00$paraview
	ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed
	Tcl_Init error: Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following 
	directories:
		/usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 
	/home/msh/documents/Installers/Linux/ParaView/lib/tcl8.4 
	/home/msh/documents/Installers/Linux/lib/tcl8.4 
	/home/msh/documents/Installers/Linux/ParaView/library 
	/home/msh/documents/Installers/Linux/library 
	/home/msh/documents/Installers/Linux/tcl8.4.5/library 
	/home/msh/documents/Installers/tcl8.4.5/library /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4
	
	 
	
	This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.

I then added the following to my .bashrc (thanks again to a reply from a 
reader of this mailing list):
	
	TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib64/paraview-2.4/tcl8.4
	export TCL_LIBRARY

Any ideas how to fix this one? 


P.S.
I have emerged X11 with the opengl USE flag set, which should mean the openGL

Your /etc/X11R6/xorg.conf probably still needs to be configured for your
hardware, emerge doesn't try to do it for you.

Use glxinfo and glxgears for testing until your xorg.conf is complete -
if they won't run, ParaView won't either.

Cheers,
Tim

xdpyinfo will list your X server's extentions which should contain GLX or a 
vendor-specific extensions such as NV-GLX. If not there the vendor-specific 
driver for your graphics card may include it.

With the help of my colleigue Kirk Wallace (who figured this out for me) we 
compiled the following list of instructions:

I had an nvidia card so I had to do the following:
Next go to:
	http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-437647-highlight-amd64+worth.html

and scroll down till you see:

 	echo "=media-video/nvidia-kernel-1.0.8178-r3 ~amd64"

Things must have changed since the post I also had to:

 	echo "=app-admin/eselect-1.0_rc2 ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
	

Go to:

and to instructions on configuring and compiling a kernel compatible with 
nvidia graphics cards and glx


and then:

	emerge nvidia-kernel nvidia-glx

(I've updated the numbers to the latest versions)

Next run:
	modprobe nvidia
	
Next run:
 	modules-update

change
	# This loads the GLX module
	#    Load       "glx"

to
	# This loads the GLX module
	    Load       "glx"

and change:

Running cmake twice fixes.  Kent seemed to think a fix had already been 
made by Amy (perhaps in cvs?).  If I could get patch, that would be 
appreciated.

Yes, this has been fixed on the ParaView-2-4 CVS branch.  If you get 
the source code from CVS using the tag ParaView-2-4, it will include the fix.

It has been fixed on the ParaView 2.4 branch but after the 2.4.2 tag was 
made.  You should be able to get the fix by looking at the ParaView-2-4 
branch head.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with TCL_LIBRARY
Message-ID: <4411B95F.8000308@cora.nwra.com>

I'm installing ParaView under /usr and the Tcl stuff ends up in 
/usr/lib/paraview-2.4/tcl8.4.  However, Tcl is looking for init.tcl in 
/usr/local/lib/tcl8.4.  I believe this is because --libdir is not being 
set in Utilities/TclTk/configure_tcltk.sh.in:

if [ "x$build_tcl" = "xtrue" ]; then
   cd "@TclTk_BINARY_DIR@/tcl8.4.5/unix"
   "@TclTk_SOURCE_DIR@/tcl8.4.5/unix/configure" --disable-shared 
${EXTRAFLAGS} || exit 1
else
   echo "-- Found existing Tcl, not rerunning configure"
fi

if [ "x$build_tcl" = "xtrue" -o "x$build_tk" = "xtrue" ]; then
   cd "@TclTk_BINARY_DIR@/tk8.4.5/unix"
   "@TclTk_SOURCE_DIR@/tk8.4.5/unix/configure" --disable-shared 
${EXTRAFLAGS} || exit 1
else
   echo "-- Found existing Tk, not rerunning configure"
fi

I've never found it either, but I've been slowly learning, and it's come
up on the list a few times it amounts to :

mkdir paraview_build_dir
cd paraview_build_dir
export CC=mpicc
export CXX=mpiCC
ccmake paraview_SOURCE_dir

Alternatively, turn on VTK_USE_MPI in CMake.  (It's an advanced 
variable.)  Reconfigure.  If CMake can't find MPI on your system, 
you'll need to specify where the MPI library and the include path for 
MPI are on your system.  Once CMake knows where those are, run 
Generate again from within CMake.  Then rebuild.

This is described in "The ParaView Guide" on pages 221-222.

Oh yeah VTK_USE_MPI is sort of important.

I've had trouble if I do not set CC and CXX prior to running cmake.  On
our clusters cmake finds gcc and mpicc is a wrapper around icc and is in
some /usr/local/mpich... path.  The paths included and the libraries
linked by mpicc baffle me so I wouldn't want to enter them in cmake.

I suppose if MPI were in some standard location it would be much easier
to compile.

That's too bad.  I'd really like to build against the system Tcl/Tk, 
which might make it acceptable to package for Fedora Extras.  I think 
I'm close to figuring out how, just need to figure out how to pass -ltcl 
and -ltk when building the binaries.

Hi All,
   I have been able to compile ParaView OK using Visual Studio  8.0 (it
compiles with the usual warnings about {Microsoft} deprecated functions) but
it will not run.
I have filed a bug report (2926) but I am curious to see if others are able
to run ParaView after compiling with Visual Studio 8.0. The crash seems to
be caused by dereferencing the end iterator.
Am I the only one using Visual Studio 8.0 and ParaView?

Andrew

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Particle format problem
Message-ID: <44137381.2020504@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out how the Ensight particle file format works 
(writing a program for the file in ASCII or Binary should be easier than 
figuring it out how it works!). In the documentation, it is given as the 
Ensight Measured/Particle file format - but I'm not sure if this means 
its a .Geo file, or a scalar/vector file.

My question basically is - how would such a format be represented?
What I do currently is: (taken from the manual)

viksit_ascii.case
--
FORMAT
type: ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model:  1       viksit_ascii.geo


and

viksit_ascii.geo
--

This is a simple measured geometry file
particle coordinates
7
101 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00
102 1.00000E+00 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00
103 1.00000E+00 1.00000E+00 0.00000E+00
104 0.00000E+00 1.00000E+00 0.00000E+00
205 5.00000E-01 0.00000E+00 2.00000E+00
206 5.00000E-01 1.00000E+00 2.00000E+00
307 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00-1.50000E+00


But loading it into Paraview doesn't make it appear. Could anyone shed a 
light on as to why not - What am I doing wrong?

I had 2 further questions -
a) Once I do get these points to show up, how would I assign say, a 3d 
sphere glyph or similar to each of these points? Am I right in assuming 
that this can be done by the materials format?

b) If I had to limit these particles in a sort of a box (say a cube with 
these particles moving about) - how would I achieve the bounding such 
that they don't move out of that particular set of coordinates?)

Thanks,
Viksit

Message-ID: <6bb554800603130322w2cbcbb50x14973dc153720757@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all

I try to write binary data for Paraview in VTK format using fortran. The
code is something like this:


      OPEN (UNIT=NAUS1, FILE=FILE1,FORM='UNFORMATTED'
     +,STATUS='UNKNOWN',ERR=90998)

      WRITE (NAUGIT)'# vtk DataFile Version 2.0'
      WRITE (NAUGIT)'proba'
      WRITE (NAUGIT)'BINARY'
      WRITE (NAUGIT)'DATASET RECTILINEAR_GRID'

      WRITE (NAUGIT)'DIMENSIONS', NXGI, NYGI, NZGI

      WRITE (NAUGIT)'X_COORDINATES',NX,'float'
      WRITE (NAUS1)'Y_COORDINATES', NY,'float'
       WRITE (NAUS1)'Z_COORDINATES', NZ,'float'
................



Can somebody give me a hint because if i am using ASCII than i have no
problems, but when i try to use BINARY ,Paraview can not read it ..

Thanks a lot
Adrian

hi,

i need to compute lift/drag coefficient/force in 2d for flow past
cylinder/airfoil etc. my output data is single structured c-grid with cell
center velocities/pressure. I am trying to explore different software to
find out which is better. Has anybody tried using paraview. Is it easy?
thanks.

PV does have a calculator module but I do not think using it to derive
e.g. traction forces on the boundaries is the right/easy thing to do. Do
derive the forces yourself and export them along with pressure and
velocity in a PV-readable file (e.g. legacy binary with velocity/forces
as vectors pressure as scalar) - you can do very good visualization. I
have beed very succesful with such a solution.

Hi Andrew,

A change was made recently (a week ago) to fix this problem both on 
the trunk and the 2.4 branch of the ParaView CVS repository.  How 
recent is your checkout of ParaView?  If it's older than a week ago, 
please try updating the source tree and rebuilding.  If your source 
tree is up-to-date and you're still seeing the problem, can you tell 
where the end iterator is being dereferenced and will you send us a 
stack trace?

Each of the above 3 lines should be followed by the appropriate coordinate, 
in binary. See  http://www.vtk.org => Technical Documents => File Formats.

There is another issue that you will probably run across soon; its not 
documented as far as I can tell. After reading legacy-style files in binary 
VTK swaps the bytes. It seems to be done whether or not it is needed. Thus, 
you may need to swap the bytes before writing integers or floats in binary.

I didn't write the EnSight reader so I can't say whether it supports
particles without looking at the code. If it does,  you should see the
right number of points in the information tab (the third tab on the
left panel, under the navigation window). If the number of points is
larger than 0, you should be able to create glyphs by applying the
glyph filter. You should also be able to limit the particles in a box
by using the clip filter. Just use box as the clip function and set
"Inside Out" to on.

You can't do this out-of-box. However, if you invest some time, it
would be quite easy to write your own filter that does this. It would
be implemented using the VTK API. Although there is an initial
learning curve, at the end you will have complete freedom on what you
can do.

The EnSight readers do support particles, and Berk is right about 
what you should see.

Hi,
If you are using the measured particles then you have to specify them
under the geometry section using the line:

Measured: 1  viksit_ascii.geo

You must also have both a model line and measured line.

You can define the particles as point elements and view them that way
instead of using measured data. If you have access to EnSight, you can
use the included program ens_checker to verify your EnSight case and
data files.

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Particle format problem

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out how the Ensight particle file format works
(writing a program for the file in ASCII or Binary should be easier than
figuring it out how it works!). In the documentation, it is given as the
Ensight Measured/Particle file format - but I'm not sure if this means
its a .Geo file, or a scalar/vector file.

My question basically is - how would such a format be represented?
What I do currently is: (taken from the manual)

viksit_ascii.case
--
FORMAT
type: ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model:  1       viksit_ascii.geo


and

viksit_ascii.geo
--

This is a simple measured geometry file
particle coordinates

101 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00
102 1.00000E+00 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00
103 1.00000E+00 1.00000E+00 0.00000E+00

307 0.00000E+00 0.00000E+00-1.50000E+00


But loading it into Paraview doesn't make it appear. Could anyone shed a
light on as to why not - What am I doing wrong?

I had 2 further questions -
a) Once I do get these points to show up, how would I assign say, a 3d
sphere glyph or similar to each of these points? Am I right in assuming
that this can be done by the materials format?

b) If I had to limit these particles in a sort of a box (say a cube with
these particles moving about) - how would I achieve the bounding such
that they don't move out of that particular set of coordinates?)

Thanks,

Hi,
Because I had to compute flow rate across sections, torque values on
body surfaces, etc, I have developed a filter called
vtkIntegrateVariables which performs a discrete integration of a
variable field (define on points of an unstructured mesh) over a
surface. I give you an example of the way it works for a flow rate
computation:
- extract the surface
- generate normals *n*
- vtkCalculator: generate field *V*.*n *(where *V* is the velocity vector)
- integrate with the vtkIntegrateVariables filter

The pipeline of the filter is the following:
- check whether values are defined at points
- pass values to cell (vtkPointDataToCellData)
- loop over number of cells, compute cell_value*cell_area, sum
- store the local integration values into an array
- pass back to point data (vtkCellDataToPointData)
- write the result (sum of the local integrations) into a file
I have compared the results of torque and flow rate integration with
CFX5.7-Post and it gives extremely good results. I have used it for 3D
surface integration but it should work for 2D line. If you wish to use
it, please let me know and I will send it to you. An option for cell
data input has then to be added.
I would be glad to contribute to paraview with this filter if needed. In
such a case I will modified it so that it can handle different kinds of
input data type. Just let me know.

Hi,


I've been a silent reader of this thread. I'd also have a need for a
3D-surface variable integration filter. Since you offered to make your
filter available, now I thought I could knock on your door :-)

I've tried to gather a couple of filters/batch scripts for CFD
postprocessing and it seems to be pretty difficult. I am sure that some
of you list-subscribers out there have mastered many problems before and
it feels a bit dumb to "re-invent the wheel" on and on again ... I am
sure that somebody out there has written lots of remarkable/useful
filters (as you did) but it is impossible to have an overview.

I have been trying to find out something about a possible implementation
of line integral convolution, or something similar for visualizing skin
friction lines on 3d-surfaces (usually unstructured) and had no success.
Apart Jean Favre's 2D-planar, structured LEA filter I couldn't find
anything out there. 


I am not sure, but I think it would be of very high value to Paraview to
have e.g., a Wiki page, dedicated to gather these kind of filters, batch
scripts, user experiences about CFD postprocessing. I do not feel that
experienced to kick off such an effort, but maybe someone of the Kitware
team?

Hi all

i am now able to write ASCII data in a binary file

        WRITE(WORT1,'(a,a,I2,a,a,a)')  'X_COORDINATES',' ',NXGI,'
','float','\n'
        WRITE (NAUGIT) WORT1

1 if my data is real in fortran and in paraview reader is float are this two
corespondent, i mean the same? I do not see real in the vtk fileformats
documentation...

2 the file for writing should be unformatted or binary opened for writing -
i am working on a sun machine?

3 how do i sweep bites? a line command would be very helpful


Kent thanks for your reply

Hi Andrew,

I'm copying this thread back to the ParaView 
users list to keep other people up-to-date on 
this issue.  The error around line 1205 in 
vtkClientServerStream.cxx has now been fixed both 
on the trunk and the 2.4 branch of the ParaView 
CVS repository.  Another developer at Kitware 
(who has a Visual Studio 8.0 compiler) is looking 
into the problem in 
vtkInformationVectorKey.  I'll let you know when it has been fixed.

Yes, real and float mean the same here.

I can't answer that as my Fortran is rusty.

I can only give an example in C; perhaps someone can contribute an example 
in Fortran. In C, if "a" is your array of integers or floats, the bytes 
could be swapped as follows:

   int i;
   char one_byte;
   char *b = (char*)a;

   for( i=0; i<nWords; ++i, b+=4 ) {
      one_byte = b[0]; b[0] = b[3]; b[3] = one_byte;
      one_byte = b[1]; b[1] = b[2]; b[2] = one_byte;
   }

Now it works pefectly

i will post a full how to for fortran users

Thanks Kent for all your answers

Message-ID: <1142360141.10582.36.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I just built paraview with the mpicc on our cluster. The interface
crashes at about the time that the render portion of window ... um turns
black.  I assume this is when the GL stuff starts. A make test shows
similarly dismal results.  I can open windows on my workstation and even
GL things like glxgears from the compute nodes. 

The test log is here:

dear all ,

I am trying to plot discrete array points each number being assigned a
different attribute , not the grid but the numbers on the point of
intersection of grids. is there any way by which i can do it .

   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
   2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  2  0  0

   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
   2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

the above set has 12 X 12 grids. and the numbers 1 and 2 are assigned a
different atttribute and 0 none.

Thank you,

Hi Andrew,

Please update your ParaView 2.4 CVS repository 
and try building again.  I checked in changes 
this afternoon to that CVS branch that should fix 
your build problems.  Please let us know if you encounter more problems.

Hi Eugene,

ParaView does not currently do spatial interpolation between time steps 
in the way that you are looking for. Improvements to time varying 
visualization are an ongoing effort for both ParaView and VTK.

cheers,

On closer inspection of the test log I see all these BadWindow things. I
see the same in the test log of the VTK I just built on my workstation
which is an x86_64 with Fedora Core 4 installed.

Hi Amy,

 

Unfortunately, there are still problems with vectors.

 

Built Ok, and I was able to load one of the test files say: blow.vtk

Then try cutting with an implicit plane using the icon in the menu bar - you
will get a debug assertion "vector subscript out of range."

 

Regards

   Andrew

Hi Andrew,

Please update your ParaView 2.4 CVS repository and try building again.  I
checked in changes this afternoon to that CVS branch that should fix your
build problems.  Please let us know if you encounter more problems.

Hi Amy,

Thanks for fixing line 239 (I prefer your solution to mine!), but in the
same bug report I also mentioned line1205 and, as I thought, it is not
fixed.
Look at line 1205 - in vtkClientServerStream.cxx [ unsigned char* end =
&*this->Internal->Data.end(); ]
This raises a "vector iterator not dereferencable" error. This is actually
correct behavior; the standard does not allow you to dereference the end
iterator. It just so happens that this compiler picks up this one and no
others do!
 
 
My suggestions would be:
 
1 ) Delete lines 1208 to 1211 and add the following at line 1202:
if(this->Internal->Data.empty())
  {
     return 0;
  }
This does the empty vector check before anything happens.
 
2) You can then (but I don't like it - it's a kludge which fools the
compiler) replace:
unsigned char *end = &*this->Internal->Data.end();
with
unsigned char *end = begin+this->Internal->Data.size()*sizeof(unsigned
char);
 
and the parser seems to work.
 
3) But then you then get a crash at line 138 in vtkInformationVectorKey.cxx.
Once again this line triggers a "vector subscript out of range error".
 
. this is getting complex!   I don't know this code very well. I am guessing
that v is empty and that info is empty also. So something is not being
checked for being empty in ParaView.
 
I suspect something in vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects(); line 875.
 
Attached is the call stack for this crash.
 
 
4) Could you also disable the deprecated warnings by adding this to the
CMakeLists.txt file?
 
 
I hope all this helps.

Hi Andrew,

A change was made recently (a week ago) to fix this problem both on the
trunk and the 2.4 branch of the ParaView CVS repository.  How recent is your
checkout of ParaView?  If it's older than a week ago, please try updating
the source tree and rebuilding.  If your source tree is up-to-date and
you're still seeing the problem, can you tell where the end iterator is

Message-ID: <1142459227.31265.10.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I compiled Paraview with the system GL and off screen mesa with very
poor results. I recompiled Paraview without any off screen rendering and
got very good test results but if I run a server on many nodes I get
many windows on the client display. It was really slow. Are these
windows competing for the graphics hardware on my workstation? 

Now I'm working on using mangled mesa on the cluster to try and get over
this.

Message-ID: <20060316183318.es21efe1gk4w4gcs@www.astro.helsinki.fi>

Hello,

I have one more newbie question to you all, sorry for that.

How can I read out the coordinates of points from the unstructured grid 
file? The file has vtu extension and contains the unstructed grid as 
binary (littleEndian compressed). I was looking for some .dll that 
provides a reader for .net (I have to use C#), unfortunatelly I did not 
find anything on google.
What I want to do is read out the points and cells and write them to an 
ASCII file. Do you have a suggestion where to look for this?

Thanks very much in advance!

Some time ago I posted a small example code to do this kind of
conversions (search the PV and VTK mailing list) in VTK. Otherwise on
the VTK webpage in the technical doc. section you will find precise
explanation of the file formats.

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Particle format problem - Segfault update
Message-ID: <f858b3640603191300ief3a037kdf31cca6c7c7ca2a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Thanks for your replies. I was experimenting with both the measured
and point formats. The latter seems easier, but gives me some
troubles. The former, on the other hand, doesn't load at all.

For the Measured particle files - I tried the following, as suggested:

-- viksit_ascii.case --
#EnSight Gold file written by VTK

FORMAT
type: ensight gold

GEOMETRY
Model: 1 viksit_ascii.geo
Measured: 1  viksit_ascii.geo

(And the same .geo file as i put in the last email, can be viewed below).
This just gives a segfault to paraview, without any inkling of what
the error might possibly be.  And since I don't have access to Ensight
itself, I can't verify if the file format itself is correct using
env_checker. I recall seeing the program on some public FTP site, and
I'm trying to find it. Now, I'm making the assumption that the case
file and the .geo file are all that are required - I don't use any
time steps yet, nor am I using any variables - vector or scalar.

Secondly, I tried the point element format as suggested in the
previous email. From http://www.ensight.com/FAQ/faq.0062.html, I was
able to obtain a sample data set which renders well with Paraview.
However, I run into a couple of problems here too:

a) The points show up as blocks (small cube structures) (and visible
only when the point size is increased to 8 or so). Is there anyway to
render them as small spheres (to simulate say, closely packed
particles of spherical origin - or any other forms). I tried using
glyphs on the data, but from what I could make out, you can only
select a particular glyph (say a sphere) for one data point at a time
and not for the entire dataset.

b) The tutorial format has the following timesteps:
TIME
time set:                  1
number of steps:           6
filename start number:     0
filename increment:        1
time values:               1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0  5.0 6.0

When pressing the animate button in Paraview however, it crashes, this
time with some (hopefully) helpful messages!

That is because the standard compositing code does not work correctly
with transparent data.  Simply put, the z-buffer algorithm used by the
compositing is incompatible with transparent data.

Under view options, try selecting "Enable Ordered Compositing".  That
will switch the compositing to an ordered color blending mode.  You may
still see artifacts, but at least all of the geometry will be drawn.
The downside of this mode is that the geometry must be redistributed
every time you make a pipeline change.

Hi,
	I am new to the list, so let me greet everyone.

I am trying to compile paraview (both stable release and from CVS) on  
a MacBook pro and I am facing the following error:

in vtkOpenGL.h I find:

I configured the build with

VTK_USE_COCOA OFF
VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER OFF
VTK_USE_GLSL_SHADERS OFF

These settings are suggested in the FAQ (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ 
ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_compile_ParaView_for_Mac_OS_X.3F).
So the second branch will be taken, but obviously GL/gl.h is not  
found. If I "force" the first branch the compilation process gets  
stuck at

I have CMake from CVS and I tried and build VTK 5.1 from CVS without  
any problem, so I guess paraview should work, too...

Thanks to anyone who will shred some light on the solution

FWIW, I don't think the FAQ is telling you to turn off VTK_USE_COCOA ...
from vtkOpenGL.h you have to have it ON to get the OpenGL headers for
mac.

I am running paraview (pvserver) using MPI on 6 machines (a small rendering 
or vis cluster) and piping it back to a single display using pvclient.  I am 
wondering if I can specifiy one pc to only do the compositing.  So instead 
of one pc rendering a portion of the data and compositing, one could just 
composite.  Is this feasible and performance-wise would it be a good idea?

Thanks in advance.

No, don't turn on VTK_USE_CARBON.  That will make the ParaView build
fail in other ways.

There should be a separate version of OpenGL header files that come with
the X version of OpenGL.  On my system, they are in /usr/X11R6/include
(I have an old G4, but the directory should be the same for the new
Intel).  If you don't have those headers, than you will need to install
X11 OpenGL (which can be downloaded from Apple's web site).  Also make
sure that the OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR CMake variable points to this
directory.

I am running paraview (pvserver) using MPI on 6 machines (a small rendering 
or vis cluster) and piping it back to a single display using pvclient.  Is 
there a recommended operating system for such a configuration or should all 
perform about the same (currently we are running Suse 10.0)?

Also would I see a substanual performance increase with a 64bit OS with 
64bit cpu as opposed to a 32 bit OS on a 32bit with the same clock speed as 
64bit cpu?

Thanks in advance.

We are running some test of the performance of ensight versus paraview.  In 
the test we use the same data set and create an iso surface (contour).  Then 
we animate the transient data set.  We are seeing about 1 order of magnitude 
increase in performance over paraview (about 2.5 mins to 29 mins).  Does 
anyone know if ensight is doing something to speed up the performance such 
as decimation or are their algorithms that much faster?

Thanks in advance.

Lots of information missing here.
1) What are you animating? Single Isovalue for multiple timesteps?  Multiple
isovalues?
2) What data type are you using?  Native VTK, Native Ensight, or a 3rd
party.  Each of the first two give a somewhat unfair advantage to one
product, if you're going for a truly even comparison.
3) What data format are you using? Structured, unstructured?  2d, 3d?
4) What pipeline/viz tools are you using?
5) What exactly are you counting time for?  Data load, or just computation?
I bet you're just timing the actual time to generate all the isosurfaces,
and Ensight gets a big win because it preloads all the data at once where
Paraview loads it as it goes.

Message-ID: <7137A9E1D1768C44BE7DF11D30FAB32301CDFA59@ES21SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

If there is not much difference between your server nodes and client,
you can very easily move all the geometry to the client and render
locally.  In "3D View Properties" under "LOD Parameters" there is an
entry titled "Composite."  That entry has a slider bar that represents
the threshold at which geometry is moved to the client.  If necessary,
you can move that slider to the right so that it collects bigger
geometries.  You can also unclick the box to turn off compositing
altogether and always collect polygons.  This will backfire on you,
however, if you are rendering a large quantity of data.

If you really want the geometry to be collected on one of the server
nodes, you will have to run in client/render server/data server mode.
Make the data server span all 6 machines and the render server reside on
one of them.  It should be OK to have a render server and data server
share a node so long as memory is not a problem.  This configuration
will force all the geometry to be pushed to the single render server
node where it will be rendered and delivered to the client.

Performance-wise is this a good idea?  That depends on your system
configuration.  Unless your server rendering hardware is way faster than
your client and your cluster interconnect really sucks, then probably
not.  I recommend experimenting with the "Composite" and "Subsample
Rate" options first to try to find a good compromise amongst rendering
speed, image quality, and data management.

What kind of ParaView binary are you using? Did you download it or
compile it yourself? Also, are you running in parallel?

All,
 
Some other stuff to be a bit careful of 
(1) 'Advanced Render Parameter' under '3D View Properties'
(2) 'Cache Geometry' under 'Keyframe Animation'
 
(1) Options can have things like construct T-Strips and create display
lists, both of which are not useful for animations
(2) Cache Geometry is a double edged sword, great for 'replay', but can
chew up a lot of memory which could lead to swapping or worse
 
My recommendation is for this particular test...
    Make sure 'Use Triangle Strips' is OFF
    'Use Immediate mode rendering' is ON
    'Cache Geometry' is OFF
 
Also if you could make the test data publicly available that makes all
the difference in the world. That way if there is an issue, we can
actually do something about it. :)

	Lots of information missing here.
	1) What are you animating? Single Isovalue for multiple
timesteps?  Multiple isovalues?  
	2) What data type are you using?  Native VTK, Native Ensight, or
a 3rd party.  Each of the first two give a somewhat unfair advantage to
one product, if you're going for a truly even comparison.  
	3) What data format are you using? Structured, unstructured?
2d, 3d?
	4) What pipeline/viz tools are you using? 
	5) What exactly are you counting time for?  Data load, or just
computation?  I bet you're just timing the actual time to generate all
the isosurfaces, and Ensight gets a big win because it preloads all the
data at once where Paraview loads it as it goes.

Thanks Ken!

Pointing cmake to the OpenGL implementation in /usr/X11R6/ seems to  
work.
I compiled paraview and I can execute it. I see the splash screen  
until "Building UI (main window)",
where it crashes with a segmentation fault.
I noticed the following warnings at the end of the compilation process:

[lots of similar linking errors before]

Ivan,

It looks like the wrong Tcl library is being linked in.  Try setting
both CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS and CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS to
-Wl,-serach_paths_first

We are almost there, I guess. No more segmentation faults, but the
following error:

ivang$ ./paraview
X Error of failed request:  BadColor (invalid Colormap parameter)
   Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
   Resource id in failed request:  0x1
   Serial number of failed request:  1141
   Current serial number in output stream:  1142


The linker gave a bunch of warnings like

symbol _XDrawLines used from dynamic library /usr/X11R6/lib/ 
libX11.dylib(DrLines.o) not from earlier dynamic library /System/ 
Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.4/Tk(single module)

so, it seems that the X11 library is used instead of Tk's version. Is  
that correct?

The problem we have is that the data is starting to hit the theshold of what 
a single workstation can handle, so we are trying to setup a small vis 
cluster to allow us to look at larger data.  Some of the data can be 
aninated and I am trying to allow the animation to run as smoothly as 
possible while using parallel paraview.  It just seemed to me that the first 
node, the one you launch the mpi pvserver from seems to be doing more work 
than all the other nodes and I thought it would balance out the workload a 
little if one machine did the compositing alone and not have a chunk of its 
own it needed to render.  So in our case we have 6 nodes I want to run mpi 
pvserver on and 1 node to run the client.  of those 6 nodes I figured we 
could have 5 pcs rendering chunks and one compositing the chunks and 
squirting it to the client.

If there is not much difference between your server nodes and client,
you can very easily move all the geometry to the client and render
locally.  In "3D View Properties" under "LOD Parameters" there is an
entry titled "Composite."  That entry has a slider bar that represents
the threshold at which geometry is moved to the client.  If necessary,
you can move that slider to the right so that it collects bigger
geometries.  You can also unclick the box to turn off compositing
altogether and always collect polygons.  This will backfire on you,
however, if you are rendering a large quantity of data.

If you really want the geometry to be collected on one of the server
nodes, you will have to run in client/render server/data server mode.
Make the data server span all 6 machines and the render server reside on
one of them.  It should be OK to have a render server and data server
share a node so long as memory is not a problem.  This configuration
will force all the geometry to be pushed to the single render server
node where it will be rendered and delivered to the client.

Performance-wise is this a good idea?  That depends on your system
configuration.  Unless your server rendering hardware is way faster than
your client and your cluster interconnect really sucks, then probably
not.  I recommend experimenting with the "Composite" and "Subsample
Rate" options first to try to find a good compromise amongst rendering
speed, image quality, and data management.

1) What are you animating? Single Isovalue for multiple timesteps?  Multiple
isovalues?

Single IsoValue for multiple timesteps.


2) What data type are you using?  Native VTK, Native Ensight, or a 3rd
party.  Each of the first two give a somewhat unfair advantage to one
product, if you're going for a truly even comparison.

3rd party cfd data.  We have written readers for paraview and ensight for 
this data.

3) What data format are you using? Structured, unstructured?  2d, 3d?
For ensight it is structured, and in paraview we are using unstructured.

4) What pipeline/viz tools are you using?
I'm not sure what you are asking here.  But I will guess you mean vtk 
pipeline in paraview.
In paraview it's Reader->CellToPoint->Contour.
and in ensight it is just Reader->IsoSurface.

5) What exactly are you counting time for?  Data load, or just computation?
I bet you're just timing the actual time to generate all the isosurfaces,
and Ensight gets a big win because it preloads all the data at once where
Paraview loads it as it goes.
We are counting the time it takes to generate all of the isosurfaces.

Another problem could be that the data is taken as a structured grid in 
ensight and an unstructured grid in paraview.

This would make a huge difference both in file size (i.e. I/O time),
memory usage and performance. Also, since you have your own reader,
make sure that there isn't a bug/performance bottleneck there. Are you
using a custom reader for ensight as well? I don't know whether
EnSight preloads everything. ParaView won't so the timing you have
includes reading.

I know of at least one case where the data was converted from structured to 
unstructured for one reason: some cells in the structured array were 
unused. They could be flagged as such in OpenDX and Ensight but there 
didn't seem to be a way to do this with VTK/ParaView. Any ideas on how to 
so flag a cell in a structured array?

Hi folks, I'm facing a weird and annoying problem with PV...

After a crash the left panel of PV has not been working anymore. It's not
hidden, it's just unreachable (take a look in the
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/transfer/pv.jpg). I've already deleted the
PV instalation directory, reinstalled it and the problem persists. Where
does PV store its enviroment configuration parameters, such as, window size,
background color, panels position, last directory accessed, etc? Does anyone
have any idea about what could be happening?! 

note: I'm still using PV 2.2.1 in a Dell Precision P-4 3.6GHz machine and
video card Nvidia Quadro FX-3400 (Windows XP/SP2 Ing).

Thanks for any help

Hmmm. Blanking support was added to VTK and ParaView a while ago but
it is not fully implemented yet. I believe blanking arrays in plot3d
files are read for example. It also works with AMR in certain cases. I
think the blanking support will get better as we get feature requests
and use cases from users.

That's annoying. Run regedit, go to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\ParaView\ParaViewM.N where M.N is
the version. In there, delete the Geometry folder.

With only 6 nodes, ParaView uses a tree compositing algorithm (at 8
nodes it switches to binary swap for better distribution).  So the first
node does indeed to some more compositing, but not much.  If you are
seeing a large difference in load balancing, I seriously doubt the
compositing is a major contribution.  Are you sure your data has an even
distribution to begin with?  Many readers do not necessarily give a good
distribution of data.  You could try running your visible surfaces
through D3 to balance them better, but if your animation changes the
geometry every frame you will lose more in redistribution than you gain
in load balancing.

The list of possible ways to work the rendering is starting to boggle my
mind.  It may be time to go home.  

To get a valid DISPLAY for paraview from the compute nodes we had to
tell ssh to not set localhost:blah but the real hostname of the login
node ( the node to which I ssh from where I'm sitting ). Then we had to
tell the batch system to copy all shell variables to the execution host.
mpiexec copies it to all the nodes. So yeah they are all getting that
valid DISPLAY from my workstation.

I suppose now that I know I can get client/server working I'll try
DISPLAY=:0. There's no X server running on them though so I didn't think
that'd work. They all do have a graphics card for each pair of
processors.

In the mean time I recompiled paraview with pure Mesa which seems to do
a lot better. CMake still doesn't like to be told the GL can do
offscreen mesa calls.

I've read some of the other points, and I can easily see one huge
bottleneck.

You've fed STructured Data to Ensight, but processed it (to remove blank
cells) into unstructured for Paraview.  Then, because of this, you have to
run a CellToPoints filter for each isosurface.  The way VTK does
CellToPoints is with a nice cell averaging routine, which gives you great
results but at a huge performance penalty.  For a more-balanced test, you
should have written out per-point data during the conversion process, to
eliminate this reprocessing during the Paraview run.

If I've misunderstood you and you actually are using Per-Cell data, then
perhaps an Isosurface isn't exactly what you want, but rather a Thresholding
(only keep data within a narrow range of your target value).

Success! Everything seems to work fine now (although I use
just a very small subset of paraview's capabilities).

I had to to the following, in case someone faces the same problems:

- disable VTK_USE_CARBON, VTK_USE_COCOA and enable VTK_USE_USE_X (see  
this FAQ entry:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ 
ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_compile_ParaView_for_Mac_OS_X.3F)

- make sure that cmake is using the OpenGL implementation found in / 
usr/X11R6/lib
(both libGL and libGLU) and the headers in /usr/X11R6/include/

- set ALL the CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS* and CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS*  
(just
to be sure) to -Wl,-search_paths_first

- run make

I'd like to thank Kenneth Moreland for his invaluable help with this  
issue!

Hi all,

I've been asking myself whether PV is running at full speed with my video
card or not. Therefore, I'd like to know where I should check if it's
happing or not. Furthermore, how could I have PV compiled in a optimized
manner according to my video card (Nvidia Quadro FX3400)? Does it make sense
or the optimizations are automatically accomplished through the use of the
OpenGL and DirectX drivers included with the video card?

To make sure the data is load balanced. Run 'ProcessIdScalars' filter...
That way you can see if the 6 processors have about the same amount of
data.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 2.4.3
Message-ID: <6.2.5.6.2.20060323102839.022ab3b0@kitware.com>

Dear ParaView users and developers,

The ParaView 2.4.3 patch release is now available for download from 
the ParaView web site: http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html. 
There are several changes (listed below) included in this release.

changes from 2.4.2 to 2.4.3:
1)   Progress was added to the Extract Group and Extract CTH Parts filters.
2)   An option was added to SpyPlot reader to load active block array.
3)   Extract Grid, Probe, and Generic Stream Tracer should accept 
input from filters.
4)   Update Exodus reader to look for new metadata filename.
5)   Fix rendering problem on Macs that don't support alpha 
bit-planes.  (bug #2704)
6)   Give more error messages than "out of disk space" when saving an 
animation.
7)   Add support for writing AVIs on unix.
8)   Improvements to FFMPEG installation.
9)   In vtkExodusReader, do not add internalNodeId array to output.
10) Fix problem where VTK_HAVE_GETSOCKNAME_WITH_SOCKLEN_T was not 
being set correctly, causing VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx 
to not compile on platforms where this variable should have been set 
to 1.  (It defaulted to 0.)
11) Fix bug where the server did not disable compositing even if a 
display was not accessible when using Mesa (onscreen).
12) Add support to vtkSpyPlotReader for SPCTH 102.  Remove forced 
dependency on controller.  Start adding some profiling code.
13) Session state was being save wrong in client/server mode.  (bug #2655)
14) Addition of new plotting functionality: Data Analysis 
filter.  (bug #2545)  Add a new toolbar icon for this new filter.
15) Fix a bug in vtkClientServerStream that resulted in dereferencing 
an end iterator.
16) Get ParaView building on AIX.

changes from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2:
1)   Sub-classes of vtkCommandOptions should be able to override 
which XML parser is created.
2)   ParaView was hanging in cave mode if more than two displays were used.
3)   The per-machine environment variables (from .pvx file) were all 
being set on the first process.
4)   In vtkExtractCTHPart, pass the volume fraction data to all 
extracted parts.
5)   ParaView was running out of memory when saving an animation in 
an MP2 file. (bug #2557)
6)   Change the default frame rate for movie files from 15 to 1. (bug #2557)
7)   When writing out VTK XML files, leave enough whitespace to fill 
in range of a data array. (bug #2561)
8)   Fixed memory leak that occurs when switching between onscreen 
and offscreen rendering on unix.
9)   Free memory as each frame of an MP2 is written.
10) --render-module command-line argument should work with the 
paraview executable (not just pvclient, pvserver, and pvrenderserver).
11) Commented out the Integrate Attributes filter (in 
GUI/Client/Resources/Filters.xml) because it easily crashes ParaView.
12) Print an error message when a reader module used by an entry in 
the recent-file menu cannot be created (i.e., when the file requires 
an external reader module that hasn't been loaded).
13) Extract CTH Parts filter should report an error instead of 
crashing if no arrays are chosen. (bug #2589)
14) In tiled display mode with IceT, if the bounds of the data set 
extend from the visible region to behind the viewpoint in perspective 
projection, then certain tiles would stop rendering the data. (bug #2579)
15) Extract CTH Parts filter was crashing; if no geometry is 
extracted do not try to process it. (bug #2650)
16) Caching of geometry during animation was broken.

changes from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1:
1)   In the Extract Surface filter, Piece Invariant should default to 
ON. (bug #2425)
2)   bug fixes to parallel unstructured volume rendering
3)   With CMake 2.2, do not rebuild all of ParaView when you change 
whether an external module is included.
4)   Fix building of ParaView on Red Hat Fedora core 4.
5)   In the Exodus reader, the Internal NodeId array has the same 
number of nodes as the output unstructured grid, not the input file.
6)   When you play an animation and return to a source that should be 
delete-able, the Delete button is now enabled. (Previously it was 
disabled even though it should have been active.)
7)   Data distribution issues when loading EnSight .case files 
containing vtkImageData (uniform rectilinear data) in parallel have 
been corrected.
8)   In the .pvx configuration file, the XML arguments that are for 
all processes are now being recognized.
9)   The extract groups widget (used by the Extract Groups filter) 
now gets the correct initial range.
10)  The demo runs (finds the correct path) in installed versions of ParaView.
11)  Make the Xdmf writer handle pixels and voxels correctly. (Write 
them out with the same point ordering as is used for quads and hexahedra.)
12)  Properly handle cancelling out of reading an Xdmf file.

We hope you enjoy this new release of ParaView.

Hi Stephen,

Please post questions like this to the mailing list instead of 
replying to me directly.

After you type the new descriptive label, press Enter.  This entry 
does not go through the same "Accept" mechanism as the other controls 
(below the Accept, Reset, and Delete buttons) on the Parameters 
tab.  This is because the label is used by ParaView to make 
identifying the results of filters, etc. easier, but it is not used 
by VTK, the underlying toolkit used for ParaView's data processing.

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight to VTK  converter
Message-ID: <20060323184825.DF8887261C@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi folks,

As I was struggling with my Ensight files written in Fortran and Paraview I
thought about writing a simple VTK/TCL script to convert my files to VTK
format. The script is simple and basically do the following steps:

1- Load several Ensight case files (each one corresponding to a portion of a
parallel unstructured model)
2- Append all case files in only one geometry
3- Save this unified model to a VTK file

It's already working but I'm still having problems with the scalar and
vector transient data. The VTK file created seems to have only the geometry
and the results corresponding to the first time step. Does anyone could give
me a hand? I left the partial script available in
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/ens2vtk.tcl. There's also a
sample file http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/sample.zip

Dear all,


I think I might have found an error in the archive paraview-2.4.3.zip. 

I tried to compile paraview first using the .zip archive and it didn't
work because of an error in .../Utilities/TclTk/build_tcltk.sh, line 2. 
Since there didn't seem to be anything wrong, I tried to download again
the archive, but this time the .tar.gz one.
Now everything worked fine. A diff between the two files (from the two
archives) told me that they differed from the first to the last line ...
although being completely identical when compared by hand/eye.


Regards, Simone

Hi, Simone

If you're trying to compile PV in a like-Unix system you must download the
gzipped source code instead of the zip.

Hope this help

Renato.

Hi Renato,

yes, thanks. I had not been clear before. 
I knew about it, as it is mentioned in the Download section:

"Note that for the source downloads the .zip files have Windows newlines
and may not work on Unix while the .gz and .Z files have Unix newlines
and may not work on Windows."

Just wanted to point out that the "may" is indeed a "will" in case of
2.4.3 :-)

Message-ID: <9f1915c90603240633n1f4b42fck@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I need to add a new source into paraview. However, I found a problem.
I can add a new source into ParaView when the class that describes this
source has a name initialized by vtk.
Ex: vtkMyClass.h

However, if I want to put other prefix, an error is reported.
Ex: hmMyClass.h

See the class:

//===================================================
#ifndef __hmMyClass_h
#define __hmMyClass_h

#include "vtkConeSource.h"
#include "hmCommonConfigure.h"

// Na declara??o da classe tamb?m deve entrar o nome do projeto
class VTK_hmCommon_EXPORT hmMyClass : public vtkConeSource
{
public:
  vtkTypeRevisionMacro(hmMyClass,vtkConeSource);
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
  static hmMyClass* New();
   void SetTest(int v);

protected:
  hmMyClass();
  ~hmMyClass();

private:
  hmMyClass(const hmMyClass&);  // Not implemented.
  void operator=(const hmMyClass&);  // Not implemented.
};
#endif
//===================================================


The cmake command run without problens. When I rum make comand, the follow
erro is reported:

Generating hmMyClassClientServer.cxx
syntax error
*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file
/home/usuario/workspace/HeMoLab/src/common/hmMyClass.h before line 20 ***
make[2]: *** [hmMyClassClientServer.cxx] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/hmCommon.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


Can I implement classes without prefix "vtk" ?
Where do I change?

Thank's

It's always been there, but is not documented. It's just a hack :-)

What you need is the Animation menu, set animation between two identical
keyframes, use the "Save animation as a movie or images" and type in the
resolution you want. You can make your images any resolution you wish.

The source code is vtkSMAnimationSceneProxy.cxx: Open it up and you will
understand the logic of it.

Message-ID: <44242AE7.6070905@mcs.anl.gov>


I've been wrestling a "syntax error", too (see Diego Mazala's note, below).

I'm building paraview 2.4.2 with three readers of my own (a new one, and 
two that have worked for some time with various releases of paraview).

Here's the message about the syntax error that was issued when my 
paraview build failed in a step where my reader's header is being used 
to create vtkFlashHDF5PolyDataReaderClientServer.cxx:

    Building Custom command
    Software/ParaView.2.4.2/build_visprep_gm/Servers/Filters/vtkFlashHDF5PolyDataReaderClientServer.cxx...
    Software/ParaView.2.4.2/build_visprep_gm/bin/vtkWrapClientServer
    Software/ParaView.2.4.2/src_visprep/Servers/Filters/vtkFlashHDF5PolyDataReader.h
    Software/ParaView.2.4.2/src_visprep/VTK/Wrapping/hints 1
    Software/ParaView.2.4.2/build_visprep_gm/Servers/Filters/vtkFlashHDF5PolyDataReaderClientServer.cxx

    *** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file
    Software/ParaView.2.4.2/src_visprep/Servers/Filters/vtkFlashHDF5PolyDataReader.h
    before line 90 ***


Here's a small piece of the offensive header, ending in the line 90 
mentioned in the error message:

    void Init();
    bool OpenFile(char *datafile);
    void CloseFile();
    bool LoadData();
    bool AddParticles(int varNum);
    int lo_particle_idx, hi_particle_idx, num_particles;


I finally determined that vtkWrapClientServer doesn't like the last 
line.  When I put lo_particle_idx, hi_particle_idx and num_particles on 
separate lines, everything was hunky-dory.

For such cases which break the wrapper generator, one can simply put
//BTX
  ---code--
//ETX

around the violating code. Ofcourse the stuff within the BTX-ETX block
doesn;t get wrapped.

Renato,

Maybe this is the cause of the confusion: none of the VTK file formats 
support transient data, not even the newer XML versions. For transient data 
you need to use the ParaView "pvd" format which is an XML file that has the 
names of VTK files that each hold one time step. It is defined in the 
ParaView book.

That's not good... :-0

so... I guess I would have to create the geometry and result files
separately and write this pvd file through some other program or script in
order to rebuild my problem...

I guess my problem is getting worse... maybe I should keep struggling with
the Ensight's format in Fortran :o(

Thanks a lot Kent. I would be trying forever if you have not advised me...

Renato.

Message-ID: <e7ddbec60603241756wd33e7ax4feb5a3c0717fb50@mail.gmail.com>

ParaView still does not run when compiled with VS 2005.
I am using the latest CVS.

1) Build ParaView using Visual Studio 2005.
2) Start ParaView
3) Select a source e.g. Box Press Accept.
4) Select Cut with imlplicit plane or sphere (7th icon) and press Accept.
5) The application crashes with a vector subscript out of range error.

To me, there seem to be definite coding problems here relating to the STL.
An observation that I can make is that we must remember the indexing in the
STL is based on half-open intervals [...).
So accessing the end pointer or past it, will trigger an exception.
Earlier (and other current) compilers tended to ignore dereferencing end(),
but will trigger an exception for dereferencing past the end pointer.
Fortunatly (and I mean it - because the behaviour is standards compliant)
this compiler will trigger an exception then the end pointer is
dereferenced.

I hope this helps because I suspect that there is a bit of code like this
here.

Assunto: [Paraview] Crash - ParaView + Visual Studio 2005


ParaView still does not run when compiled with VS 2005.
I am using the latest CVS.
 
1) Build ParaView using Visual Studio 2005.
2) Start ParaView
3) Select a source e.g. Box Press Accept.
4) Select Cut with imlplicit plane or sphere (7th icon) and press Accept.
5) The application crashes with a vector subscript out of range error.
 
To me, there seem to be definite coding problems here relating to the STL. 
An observation that I can make is that we must remember the indexing in the
STL is based on half-open intervals [...). 
So accessing the end pointer or past it, will trigger an exception. 
Earlier (and other current) compilers tended to ignore dereferencing end(),
but will trigger an exception for dereferencing past the end pointer.
Fortunatly (and I mean it - because the behaviour is standards compliant)
this compiler will trigger an exception then the end pointer is
dereferenced.
 
I hope this helps because I suspect that there is a bit of code like this
here.

Renato,

My experiences with --

1) EnSight Gold c-binary files written from Fortran-90/95
Works exceptionally well for time-series data, The EnSight reader 
expects time-series data and sets "flags and switches internally" so 
that the '>'-button on the animation-control bar produces what you would 
expect. (Don't forget to force big-endian binary output when you write 
the c-binary stream -- the PV EnSight reader by default expects it. 
There is a button to alter the reader's setting, however, it is a real 
bother to change it every time.)  An example EnSight *.case file is 
attached.

2) Exodus netCDF-based binary files written from Fortran-90/95 (or 
written from c)
Works even better than the EnSight reader in PV.  At least two nice 
advantages: (1) the binary files are hardware/operating system 
independent, that is, compute on one platform, post process on a 
different platform without using any file-format translation, and (2) 
the animations come pre-scripted with a timer "Time = 1.23E-5" running 
in the lower right corner  of the frame. The selection of sub-domains, 
if defined in the data, is on the face sheet.
Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii  All but the 
Fortran-binding are contained in PV/bin/vtkexoIIc.dll and 
PV/bin/vtkNetCDF.dll on WinXX, similarly on Linux.

3) VTK (legacy or xml, ASCII or binary)
The vtk-reader is very good at seeing a serialized file set. That is, if 
your results are serialized one-file-per-time-step something like 
mydata.000.vtu to mydata.099.vtu, the  animation  capability will  see 
it as a time series  (requires some button setting) and produce what you 
need. Do not go over a 100 snap shoots (animation will ignore your 
serialized file set); you can count from either 000 to 099 or 001 to 
100. This works with myjob.000.pvtu to myjob.099.pvtu mother-files also. 
If you write the current deformed coordinates as you go, then you get a 
warp=1 geometry change in the animation without having to use the warp 
filter.

If you use PV's *.pvd files, for example, myjob.000.pvd to 
myjob.099.pvd, to group objects (a very nice feature!), the animation 
capability is busted and only the first object gets animated, the others 
stay at the initial state. I have attached examples of a *.pvtu file. 
and a *.pvd file.

All of this my be more advanced than you anticipated, but you have 
expressed a desire to do
animation.

Hello,

I am really new to Paraview and VTK and even though I tried writing the .xml and .pvsm files for vtkVRMLExporter and vtkIVExporter, I have been getting errors. Does anyone have the files or can help me with this? This would be of great help.

Thank you,

Hi all!

In the last days I have been trying to understand the VTK file formats. 
I have found several questions about the file format in the mailing list

would be good to write down my new knowledge:

Thanks for your effort, there is one thing missing, though: binary
compressed non-based64'd - the "ultimate" storage way. It is possible
only I couldnt figure out how to code it. Are you able to clear that up?

miss the vortices behind the strakes. Is there a way to start the 
streamlines from the cylinder and strake surfaces?

According to this mail, you have to do the same as I have described for
binary appended data, except that you skip the base64 encoding, write
<AppendedData encoding="raw"> instead of encoding="base64", and use the
correct offsets.
However, I could not get it to work.

This is my test file; maybe I have made a mistake somewhere:

I do not see your mistake, but it works as described in your mail with 4 
byte headers for each data block. The offsets in the DataArray of course 
include the headers. In fact, it is the only binary format that I got to 
work :-)

Hey St?phane ,

unfortunately not... I only got success when running Paraview in stereo mode
on Linux systems. Firstly, I thought it was due my LCD monitors but I've
already tried in a CRT with several different sets, but nothing worked... 

It's a bit strange for me... Have you noticed that Paraview show the "stereo
rendering" as enabled in the "about's window" even without displaying any
stereo image on WinXP? I think it's a bug or some hardware/software
requirement. Maybe some feature being tested or undocumented sets...

Hey..., PV developers... may anyone kindly explain it to us?

Regards

NOTE: This subject is not discussed (or I haven't found yet) in the
Paraview's Guide (the old one).

Answer 1:  (for Stephen Wornom in France, a respectable distance from  
Vicksburg, MS)
Streamlines are seeded by using a vtk-geometry; even a set of points  
as an unstructured points object will work.  VTK does not have a  
topology extractor which would help you to find the vrotex cores and  
the strakes.

Question 1:
   Is there interest in a topology filter?  Any features that you'd  
like to have?  I need to write one, and it would be nice to have a  
collaborator or even an interested party.

Question 2:
   I have several Sharp 15" LCD autostereo panels plus the SDK for  
win and XP.  Has anyone toyed with a rendering module for these  
displays?  I quite like them, and although everyone wants stereo, no  
one wants to cede their desk to the CRT needed to display stereo.

Interesting ... this means that instead of "line" and "point cloud" in
the streamtracer seed selection box, one could have something like
"extracted topology" ... provided an appropriate filter? What about a
cut between a custom plane and a surface mesh? Could the resulting curve
be used for seeding the streamlines?

Stockholm, Sweden is also a respectable distance from Vicksburg, MS ...
and I have interest in a topology extraction filter ... that's another
thing in common with Stephen Wornom (presumably :-)

A feature extraction filter as in Ensight (I think using the semi-open
MIT FX toolkit) would be a great thing to have! But personally, I would
be more that happy to have just a "simple" cut to use as a seed. 

So ... interested party: definitely; collaborator: if I can help, sure!

Hello!

I know that there are several things in VTK which cannot be used with

possible. But I have no idea how to do it.

Can anyone please explain to me how to access the VTK properties and

variable "EyeAngle" (in vtkCamera.cxx); but I have no idea how to access 
it in Tcl.

Message-ID: <9f1915c90603290418j31646a8brceaf2ac788cfb9f7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I have found problems when trying to compile my vtkClasses and those classes
have templates definitions.

Example:

#ifndef _vtkHMSimplifiedModel_h_
#define _vtkHMSimplifiedModel_h_

#include <vtkObject.h>
#include <vtkObjectFactory.h>
#include "hmCommonConfigure.h"

class vtkHMTreeElement;
class vtkArrayMap;

class VTK_hmCommon_EXPORT vtkHMSimplifiedModel:public vtkObject
{
protected:
  vtkArrayMap<int, vtkHMTreeElement*> TreeNode;

public:
  static vtkHMSimplifiedModel *New();
  vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkHMSimplifiedModel,vtkObject);
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

  void SetName(const char* name){this->name = name;return;}
  const char* GetName(){return name;};

protected:
    vtkHMSimplifiedModel();
    virtual ~vtkHMSimplifiedModel();

  // Description:
  // Class/object name.
  const char* name;
};

#endif /*_vtkHMSimplifiedModel_h_*/


This example return a: "SYNTAX ERROR" before class declaration line, when
generating vtkHMSimplifiedModelClientServer.cxx
In my debugs, I have verified that the use of templates, for example STL
structures(vector,string,map) do not work. We found out that when a
class name does not have the vtk prefix, this error also occurs. The classes
vtkArrayMap, vtkQueue, etc, where designed with this in mind?
How can I to resolve this?, is this a bug or architectural design feature?,
do you have any suggestion or comments?.

Another question:
What are the tags "//BTX" and "//ETX"? I think they might be related. (??)

Best regards,

Message-ID: <20060329160759.wlaylv5qg40sgss0@www.astro.helsinki.fi>

Hello!

I am plotting vtk unstructured grid data which look like:

Point data
1 1 1
1 2 -1
..
CELL_TYPES 10
7
7
..
CELL DATA 10
COLOR_SCALARS colors 1
1
0.1
0.5
0.4
...

When paraview displays the data, it plots the values in the scalar bar 
starting from 0 to 255. But I would like to have the labels to display 
the actual color scalar value for example 0.8. Does this work? Changing 
the parameters of the color map changes also the ranges of values to be 
plotted, and I do not want to do that.

It would also be great to assign a color to a data set with values 
ranging from 10^-5 to 0.1 (or 10^-5 until 1000) and to display the 
correct label of the colors beside the plot.  The manual states that 
this is done automatically, but unfortunatelly, I did not figure out 
how to do this, sorry for this newbie question. But it would be really 
nice if somebody could explain it to me :-)

Thanks in advance!

I'm getting crazy because I can't read my plot3d file in binary. I have
500MB formatted plot3d data file so the binary format should be better to
manage.
This is my fortran code to write the .xyz and .q file:

open(12,file='bouco.xyz',form='formatted',status='unknown')
       rewind(12)
       write(12,*) n3,n2,n1

     %  (((x1c(i),k=1,n3,n3p),j=1,n2,n2p),i=1,n1,n1p)
        close(12)



namfi3='post.q'
      open(29,file=namfi3,form='formatted',status='unknown')
      rewind(29)
      write(29,*) n3,n2,n1
      write(29,*) 1.,1.,1.,1.
      write(29,121) (((vmod(i,j,k),k=1,n3),j=1,n2),i=1,n1)
      write(29,121) (((v3(i,j,k),k=1,n3),j=1,n2),i=1,n1)
     %             ,(((v2(i,j,k),k=1,n3),j=1,n2),i=1,n1)

     %             ,(((vmod(i,j,k),k=1,n3),j=1,n2),i=1,n1)

If I write  unformatted files Paraview doesn't work.

Anybody know which is the problem.

Hi!

I have problems loading big files with Paraview. I have asked a similar
question already some weeks ago; but then I have found out that the
errors I get must have different causes. So I ask again, this time more
tightly focused.

I have a binary data file (unstructured grid) in different resolutions.
The smaller versions of the file work well, up to a grid size of 5.5
million points/10.5 million cells (file size: 400 MB). But the file
with the highest resolution, with 10.8 million grid points and 21
million cells (file size: 800 MB), does not work. Paraview fails with
the following error message:
========
There was a VTK Error in file:

It sounds as if there was not enough memory -- but the computer has 2
GB RAM plus 3 GB swap space, this should be really enough.

Does anyone know why this does not work? Is there any size limit? How
big are the data files that you process?

Thanks,

Is this a  unix-like machine of some sort? I see the /home path at
least.  If it's a 32bit processor you could be bumping up against the
address space limit. Did you compile with 64bit IDs? If not you could be
hitting the limit of the VTK id type.

Keep in mind many parts of the pipeline might need a chunk of memory as
big as the input.

I've found it really helps to use the streaming abilities of VTK LONG
before you bump into these limits.

When you say "the file does not work", do you mean that it fails when
you load the file or after you apply some filter?

Subject: [Paraview] visualizing brain scan data
Message-ID: <442AA97D.80700@vije.ca>

  Hi,
I have a file that contains information derived from a DT MRI scan.  The 
information is in the form of set of floating point triplets for each 
pixel of a 20x256x256 volume.  i.e the file is of the form:

A(1,1,1) = (3.2, 1.1, 1.2),
A(1,1,2) = (5.6, 2.8,3.2),
 ...,
A(1,1,256) = (4.3,6.5, 5.4),
A(1,2,1 )= (4.5, 6.7, 2.3)
...
A(1,256,256) = (4.5, 5.6, 6.7),
A(2,1,1) = (1.2, 2.3, 3.4),
 ...,
A(20, 256, 256) = (5.4, 4.2, 2.1)



The index number of elements is of course not contained in the file.  I 
wrote them to make the format clear.

I know the physical resolution of each point and of course I can write a 
program to place whatever headers are needed.


QUESTION:

How can I have paraview  to automatically map the triplet values to HSV 
and/or RGB triplet sets and display the volume.  I don't really care 
what format my data file is converted to (e.g pvd, vtk, tiff, ...) so 
long as it requires minimal programming on my part, as I am not really a 
programmer.

I am hoping that this is a very easy problem and that there exists some 
reader/writer filter in paraiew or VTK/ITK  to help with this task.

thanks for all your help,
Arash



PS  Sorry if this is a repeat

Chris,

In my opinion 2 Gig isn't enough for a 21 million unstructured cell
dataset. If you have the option of a mini-cluster (4, 8 nodes) then
that's the way to go. :)

Is the 21 million cell dataset coming from a simulation that you are
running at your institution? Is that simulation running on a cluster?
Can you put paraview server on that cluster? 

At Sandia we don't usually put more than 2 million unstructured cells
per paraview server process, that way operations and interactions are
fairly responsive.

Hi Diego,

I want to thank you for the example you gave me, however, I still cannot get the files to work. Maybe you could look over them and let me know if I doing something wrong?
Here is what I'm doing:

     </StringVectorProperty>
    </WriterProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>
------------------------------------------------------

Following your instructions and checking also the "forced read" button, it
works!

Message-ID: <3CAFA8502A25A841B2F6D22237BFC01A129453@exbe05.intra.dlr.de>

Hi
 
I do have an unstructured grid (saved in vtkXML-format). This grid surrounds some kind of bodys (in my case wings and stuff like this). The surface of the bodys is discribed by surface-triangles and -quads. I only want to have a free look at the body?s surface, but I still need the surrounding grid for streamlines and so on. -> I want to have something like you can see on the Paraview-Screenshot-page - picture called "CFD analysis of the..." (http://www.paraview.org/Art/BigShot12.jpg)
My problem is the following:
When I do make an (Banded)SurfaceMap Paraview still presents the surface of the surrounding grid (although there are no surfacetriangles or -quads) and this surface is of course in the line of sight to my body. I only want to see the surfacetriangles and quad of my body!
 
Does anyone has an idea how to manage it?
 
Thanks
 
Steffen

What i've done for similar datasets is use the Extract Surface filter to
generate an outer surface (which includes "inner" surfaces as well).  Then
use a Cut filter with a Box input to trim away all the outer bounding
surfaces.

Message-ID: <200603300042491041661@163.com>

hello all,
I had a problem in offscreen.
A rendering window is always showed and appeared at once when I run a saved session with pvbath in the linux. It seems that it had nothing to do with the offscreen box since it was always that whether we choose the offscreen box or not.
How can I make the rendering window not to be showed in my case?

If I understood your question you're trying to extract and show the body's
surface from your solid mesh, is that correct?! If my understanding of your
question is right, It's something that PV does nicely. Thus, assuming you
have a tetrahedra mesh with everything minus your body (I use to calling it
"femme" model or "negative" model), you'll need to extract the surface
through the "extract surface" filter and then apply the "clip" filter in
order to cut out the outward surfaces and show only the inward surface (the
body you want). If you already have the outward and inward surfaces, you
only need to apply the clip filter.

NOTE: You'll need to select a suitable "clipping function" (the box function
is good for it) and set the "inside out" option accordingly.

Cheers

Assunto: [Paraview] I only want to see the bodys in a 3d-unstructured grid

Hi
 
I do have an unstructured grid (saved in vtkXML-format). This grid surrounds
some kind of bodys (in my case wings and stuff like this). The surface of
the bodys is discribed by surface-triangles and -quads. I only want to have
a free look at the body?s surface, but I still need the surrounding grid for
streamlines and so on. -> I want to have something like you can see on the
Paraview-Screenshot-page - picture called "CFD analysis of the..."
(http://www.paraview.org/Art/BigShot12.jpg)
My problem is the following:
When I do make an (Banded)SurfaceMap Paraview still presents the surface of
the surrounding grid (although there are no surfacetriangles or -quads) and
this surface is of course in the line of sight to my body. I only want to
see the surfacetriangles and quad of my body!
 
Does anyone has an idea how to manage it?
 
Thanks
 
Steffen

Maybe this can help you:
Paraview only read C binary file.

Fortran can emulate this format by this way:

      reclength=80*3+4*(1+(imax-imin+1)*(jmax-jmin+1)*(kmax-kmin+1)*ndv)

        open (unit=FileUnit,file=VarFileName,
     &        form='UNFORMATTED',access="direct",recl=reclength)
        write(unit=FileUnit,rec=1) VarFileName
     &                            ,part,rank,block
     &                            ,((((SNGl(var(m,i,j,k))
     &                            ,i=imin,imax)
     &                            ,j=jmin,jmax)
     &                            ,k=kmin,kmax)
     &                            ,m=1,ndv)

Looks like vtkpng doesn't get built when using the system version, but 
doesn't get removed from the dependencies for libKWWidgets.

Perhaps paraview-2.4.3/GUI/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt needs fixing?

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES (KWWidgets vtkpng)

to something link (I'm very new to cmake):

IF(VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PNG)
   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES (KWWidgets vtkpng)
ELSE(VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PNG)
   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES (KWWidgets png)
ENDIF(VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PNG)

Although it looks like it is already picking up -lpng.

By using the isosurface filter, I can visualize some hairpin vortices in

But I  would like to visualize the sens of the rotation of these vortices.
To do so,  I would like to colorize it by the streamwise vorticty .

How to colorize an iso-surface with another scalar value coming  from 
another data file ?
(I can only colorize the iso-surface with the iso-value, the property 
the normal or the gradient)

Or

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting an unstructured grid from Ensight case
	files...
Message-ID: <20060329191722.CCA767263F@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi there,

Since I'm a poor Fortran programmer that can't make the Ensight's binary
format working in Paraview properly, I've been writing a TCL/VTK script to
convert from Ensight case files to Paraview/VTK format (and I hope it will
work out my problems...). 

A have the following situation to cover:

1- Model partitioned in several case files (sometimes I run problems in
parallel/MPI)
2- Each case file has its geometry and results files associated
3- The geometry does not change in time

Then, I was thinking about do the following:

1- Read each case file
2- Export the Unstructured grid through the vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter
3- Export the results for each time step through the vtkXMLDataSetWriter
4- Assembly the files through a PVD file (Paraview format) as is done with
the case file

My problem is: 

* * * How do I export unstructured grids and results separetely? * * *

I'm using the following script, but it's only able to save grid+results in
the same file. Note that it's not good since I'll be replicating grid that
does not change in time.

--------------------------------------------------------------
package require vtk

# loading command line arguments
set arch [lindex $argv 0]      
set nprocs  [lindex $argv 1]

# building the case file names
append arch "_"
append arch $nprocs
append arch "_"

# loop over the case files that will be read and saved in vtk format
for {set i 0} {$i < $nprocs} {incr i} {

    set filename $arch
    if {$i < 10} { append filename "0" }
    append filename $i
    set casefile $filename    
    append casefile ".case"
    puts " Reading Ensight casefile $casefile"

    vtkGenericEnSightReader reader
       reader SetCaseFileName $casefile
       reader Update

    vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter vtkfile
      vtkfile SetInput [ reader GetOutput ]
      vtkfile SetFileName "$filename.vtk"
      puts " Exporting VTK unified file..."
      vtkfile Write

    reader  Delete    
    vtkfile Delete
}
wm withdraw .
Exit
--------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for any help

Nice to see someone else using Tcl/Tk for file conversion :)  I do it all
the time here.

Sadly, you've run into the #1 problem with VTK formats, the Grid & Data must
remain together (AFAIK, someone please correct me if I'm wrong)..  If you
want to separate the two, then you have little choice than to switch to
another format.

Hi Randall, thanks for your advice...
 
This subject has been drive me crazy!!!
 
- I can't read SOS files since they are written by Fortran routines;
 
- I can't save transient data in VTK since VTK does not have support to
transient data... ok, it can be overcame through PVD files;
 
- I can't save grid and results separetely... Ok, I can save them together
but it would give unnecessary data being replicated;
 
- I tried the Stephane approach (opening the file as unstructured and saving
with only one write) but the number of parameters passed to the "write"
function is greater than the limit that the function supports to write;
 
- I open the file (ENSIGHT6) as binary (my Fortran has support to it) but PV
only read my files in serial modes (SOS does not work)
 
- Ensight Gold binary written by Fortran does not work as well
 
- Ok, Ensight format in ASCII works fine but it would give me huge and very
slow files...

- Ok, there's a Fortran/VTK library distributed with PV, but I'd have to
install VTK or port the library to any machine I use (and I'm not a system
administrator to do it). 

- I only get success when reading Ensight6 Fortran/Binary data in serial
mode.

I'm feeling that I (and other Fortran programmers) have no choice... I know
that PV and VTK have different Ensight readers, but why do the VTK readers
work with my files and in PV it is not always possible? Furthermore, how can
Ensight read Fortran unstructured/binary and C/C++ files without any
problem? Within the files have a "C binary" and a "Fortran binary"
indication, can't it be used to guide the right way of reading the file?

I don't know what I should do... I was writing this script to convert a
bunch of results that I have stored but I'm almost giving up and going
through write a C writer for my Fortran programs (unfortunately, it won't
solve the problem of my results stored - only if I do another file
converter)

Well, i'm about as far away from an Ensight guru as you can get, so someone
else will have to chime in on the specifics of the File Format & Ensight.

But there's a few issues with Binary & Fortran files.
   1) Binary isn't really "cross platform compatible" .  If you do an
unformatted write on a big endian machine, you have to be careful to byte
swap it on a little-endian machine.  This can't be easily autodetected, so
alot of the readers have the ability to specify it.   Maybe this option is
missing?
   2) Fortran insists on writing Record Markers at the beginning & end of
each write.  Handy for integrity checking, royal PITA when you start trying
to use it in anything other than fortran.  Again, hard to autodetect, so
some of the readers give you the ability to specify C or Fortran (like the
Plot3d Reader).

So you're kinda left to using other formats.  Personally, I would like to
see the new VTK Parallel XML formats extended to allow for putting the data
& the grid in separate files, but I doubt that will happen anytime soon.
Xmdf & Xdmf are an option, but not very ensight friendly (I think).

Personally i've started writing things to VTK XML formats with the
compression enabled.  It's ascii, and the grid gets carried around, but it's
a minor annoyance for the stuff I'm doing. The ones where it is a huge
annoyance, we're using PLOT3D files so it's not an issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Python wrapping
Message-ID: <442AECD3.8070202@cora.nwra.com>

Trying to turn on the python wrapping:

         -DPARAVIEW_WRAP_PYTHON:BOOL=ON

But when paraview is installed, the following libraries are not installed:

libvtkPVServerCommonPython.so
libvtkPVServerManagerPython.so

Looks like the relevant configuration is here:

IF(PARAVIEW_WRAP_PYTHON)
   FIND_PACKAGE(PythonLibs REQUIRED)
   SUBDIRS(Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping)
   IF(PV_INSTALL_NO_LIBRARIES)
     SET(VTKPythonWrapping_INSTALL_LIBRARIES 0)
   ELSE(PV_INSTALL_NO_LIBRARIES)
     SET(VTKPythonWrapping_INSTALL_LIBRARIES 1)
   ENDIF(PV_INSTALL_NO_LIBRARIES)
   SET(VTKPythonWrapping_INSTALL_LIB_DIR ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR})
   SET(VTKPythonWrapping_INSTALL_BIN_DIR ${PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR})
ENDIF(PARAVIEW_WRAP_PYTHON)

But I'm not sure what I should be doing.  I'm not really sure what the 
python wrapping is either, but trying to do a full featured build...

Kent,
I've found the solution to one problem.
I've puted

protected:
  vtkArrayMap<int, vtkHMTreeElement*> TreeNode;

between tags //BTX and //ETX.

However, I diddin't found solution to name the class.
All them need have vtk prefix.

I didn't make none change into paraview code, only in external codes (Import
Package).
I don't have other version of ParaView.
I' ve used GNU 4.o compiler too.

Good point. I have recompiled it with support for 64 bit IDs, but it 
does not help.

Ok, I was not aware of this.

But now I have just been trying to load the files, without any filters

What does that mean? I don't understand... what is VTK LONG?

It fails when I load the file. Instead of displaying the surface of the

exclamation mark in the lower right corner.

I'm afraid of trying any other file format since the problem is mainly due
the Fortran. I really like the Ensight format, it seems me to be the easiest
and more powerful format among the formats supported by PV, but these
weirdness regarding the Fortran binary are really annoying...

I know that the "unformatted" data written by Fortran is something weird for
any other programming language, but what about the "binary" format provided
by some compilers?! What's wrong with this BINARY? My files are all open as
"BINARY" and not as "UNFORMATTED". I use the Compaq and Intel compilers and
both have support to "BINARY". PV (2.2.1) is able to open the files but only
in serial mode. When I try to use a SOS file to open several pieces of model
in parallel they don't work. Can anyone point me the differences between
this kind of "BINARY" (not UNFORMATTED) and the binary provided by other
languages, such as C/C++? I think this "BINARY" should work as in any other
language.


Renato.

Oh, hehe. That wasn't meant to look like a type.  What I meant was that
LONG before a program starts to behave badly because it's using up the
address space or all the RAM + swap it starts to pay off to use
streaming.

Ok, good to know. I thought, if the binary file is only 800 MB big, 
about 1 GB RAM should be enough. But it didn't work even on a PC with 3 
GB RAM.

We have already thought about running it in parallel, but there are 
problems with MPI (using the MPICH library). The program crashes even 
with much smaller files, with a different error message (see below), and 
I have also no idea why.

At the moment, it is just a test file. But we want to use Paraview for 
simulations in geodynamics and seismology; the cluster for these 
simulations will be ready in a few weeks.

Of course it should be possible to run Paraview there, when the MPI 
problem is solved.

Also good to know.

Thank you very much, cheers,

I didn't understand the sentence because I had no idea what you mean by 
"streaming abilities" and that it is a VTK feature. Now I have seen in 
the Paraview FAQ that this must be a kind of filter that can be added to 
a VTK pipeline, but unfortunately I have no idea how to do that. I would 
like to deal with Tcl, but I don't know how to start...

One problem is that the process on the second node is trying to open an
X window, and the xhost is refusing the connection.  ParaView does not
open up an x window until it needs to composite the data, which is why
it doesn't happen until you load a "larger" data set.  Change the
permissions of the xhost on process 2 to allow the mpi job to connect to
it.

Message-ID: <442B26F1.000093.03817@bj163app52.163.com>

Dear ParaView users and developers,
When I use Paraview in c/s or c/r/s mode (client and 
server both are windows OS),I find that there is 
error appearing on the server screen when I open a 
file, if I move dataserver from one machine to 
another machine.
The error is like "there is no such dictionary ...on<BR>this dataserver". If I don't click the OK button on 
the server screen, the Client will not continue.
It is very inconvenient for user if the data servers is
separately located in the diffirent remote places.
How can I solve this problem?
 
Nancy

Christoph,
 
I have read your questions in paraview mailing list. We have compiled and installed paraview with MPI in a 8-node cluster. and we have met the same problems as you, but we solved them later.
 
#1:
==========
$ mpirun -machinefile ~/machinefile.txt -np 2 ./paraview
p1_27474:  p4_error: alloc_p4_msg: Message size exceeds P4s maximum 
message size: 321213977
rm_l_1_27475: (257.175131) net_send: could not write to fd=5, errno = 32
==========
 
The first problem is caused by the MPI message size limit. you can configrate the MPI to enlarge this size.
 
#2:
==========
$ mpirun -machinefile ~/machinefile.txt -np 2 ./paraview
Process id: 1 >> ERROR: In 
/home/moder/paraview-3D/paraview-2.4.2-clone2/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,

rm_l_1_22330: (1360.557878) net_send: could not write to fd=5, errno = 32
==========
 
The second error is caused by Linux Xserver. You should set the $DISPLAY to localhost and run the commond 'xhost+' to allow remote processes could open a window locally.
 
Another request, Can you share your big test data with me? We want do some test about parallel performance of paraview, but can not find large enough dataset. 
 
Best,
Nancy

Hi,
 
Following the paraview guide, I saved a batch script from the File menu after I have created a visualization. But I find that the parameter of 'Offscreen' in the box of Batch File Elements is no use when running paraview using 'pvbatch', for there is always a render window created in linux Xwindows. But in Windows OS, everything is normal.
 
Anything wrong?

Oh OK.  Streaming large data sets keeps the overall memory usage down. I
don't know how to use it in Paraview but I do whatever I can beforehand
in VTK. If every filter supports streaming than telling the last one to
divide the pipeline into a number pieces divides the total amount of
memory used at once. The file reader and any filter only load enough
data to process the piece.

Thinking about streaming matters for Paraview even when run in parallel
because not all readers can load only a part of a data set. If every
process on the cluster tries to load the whole thing and throw out what
it does not need then there is a lot of waste. I saw a big speedup by
switching to the XML file types broken into pieces. Your mileage will of
course vary.

Hi Stephane,

you could try to use the filter available in the PV Wiki's page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend. This filter will give you the
vorticity and you could use this data to do what you want.

Cheers

Renato.

NOTE: Have you discovered anything regarding the stereo view in WinXP?

By using the isosurface filter, I can visualize some hairpin vortices in my
flow.
But I  would like to visualize the sens of the rotation of these vortices.
To do so,  I would like to colorize it by the streamwise vorticty .

How to colorize an iso-surface with another scalar value coming  from
another data file ?
(I can only colorize the iso-surface with the iso-value, the property the
normal or the gradient)

Or

How to cut a scalar data file with a previously generated iso-surface ?
(I can only cut a data file with a plane or a sphere)

ParaView defaults to showing the external surface of a volume, and that
is what you are seeing.

The picture I contributed was made by loading the volume data in memory
and making it invisible. The surface of the solid is extracted by a
second filter which knows exactly (from a description in our custom file
format) which triangles make the surface. It creates two outputs when
reading the file. Output 0 is the volume, Output 1 is the surface.
Coordinates of points are reference-counted (shared).

Using a box-clipper like others have suggested will work in simple
cases, but I have found it too difficult to deal with multiple objects,
and multiple boundary-conditions on the walls. Creating explicit objects
classified by their boundary condition types guarantees clean
extraction. You can then easily distinguish between symmetry walls,
inlets, outlets, solid surfaces, etc...

Wow, what a tricky model you have guy...

Your domain is so slim that the clip filter can't handle with it - I guess
it's due accuracy losses. Ok, ok... it's possible to do what you want with
Paraview - take a look in:
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/pv-screen-Steffen-Kunze.PNG. As
you can see I applied the "transform" filter in order to have your model
scaled up (mainly in the Y direction - 100:1000:100).

In your case, I do recommend you to follow the suggestion given by Jean
Frave: create your own surface subsets and write them out in your file.

Assunto: AW: [Paraview] I only want to see the bodys in a 3d-unstructured
grid

Hello
Thanks for your tip. I guess you understood me right (if I understood you
:-) ) But nevertheless I didn?t figure out how to do it - I am new in
working with Paraview. Maybe you can have a look on my dataset and tell me
what you have done to see the surface. Therefor I have attached one of my
files. It contains a huge area of hexaeders and prisms. This area surrounds
the body (an airfoil/wing) that has surfacetriangles/quads. And exactly this
surface I want to see.

It would be realy realy cool, if you find time.

Thanks in advance

Steffen

If I understood your question you're trying to extract and show the body's
surface from your solid mesh, is that correct?! If my understanding of your
question is right, It's something that PV does nicely. Thus, assuming you
have a tetrahedra mesh with everything minus your body (I use to calling it
"femme" model or "negative" model), you'll need to extract the surface
through the "extract surface" filter and then apply the "clip" filter in
order to cut out the outward surfaces and show only the inward surface (the
body you want). If you already have the outward and inward surfaces, you
only need to apply the clip filter.

NOTE: You'll need to select a suitable "clipping function" (the box function
is good for it) and set the "inside out" option accordingly.

Cheers

Assunto: [Paraview] I only want to see the bodys in a 3d-unstructured grid

Hi
 
I do have an unstructured grid (saved in vtkXML-format). This grid surrounds
some kind of bodys (in my case wings and stuff like this). The surface of
the bodys is discribed by surface-triangles and -quads. I only want to have
a free look at the body?s surface, but I still need the surrounding grid for
streamlines and so on. -> I want to have something like you can see on the
Paraview-Screenshot-page - picture called "CFD analysis of the..."
(http://www.paraview.org/Art/BigShot12.jpg)
My problem is the following:
When I do make an (Banded)SurfaceMap Paraview still presents the surface of
the surrounding grid (although there are no surfacetriangles or -quads) and
this surface is of course in the line of sight to my body. I only want to
see the surfacetriangles and quad of my body!
 
Does anyone has an idea how to manage it?
 
Thanks
 
Steffen

This sounds more like a bug in the ensight reader than a problem with
your code. Can you send me a very small example (including the sos
file)?

Do the two datasets (the one that you generated the isosurface from
and the one that has the vorticity) have the same geometry?

Hi Berk, 

here we go... I put a model partitioned in 4 parts with their case and SOS
files in

http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/sos/  

The files were written in Fortran BINARY in ENSIGHT6 format and were checked
with ens_checker utility with no warnings.

It seems that PV (2.2.1) can't read SOS files pointing to ENSIGHT6 cases,
only GOLD cases are supported because the server returned me the following
messages:

"Unexpected file type: 'master_server ensight6'"
"Error parsing the master server file"

I tried to cheat changing the "master_server ensight6" line to
"master_server gold" but it didn't work.

------------------------------------------------------------

The machines used in my tests are:

CLIENT:
Dell Precision 370 - P4 3.6Ghz, 4Gb/533Mhz/SDRAM, Nvidia Quadro Fx-3400,
Windows XP, Paraview 2.2.1 (distributed release)
Command line: pvclient -rc

SERVER:
SGI Altix - 16x Itanium-2, Red Hat advanced server kernel 2.4.21-sgi305r1,
Paraview 2.2.1 (compiled myself)
Command line: mpirun -np 4 pvserver -rc -ch=(client's IP)

Thanks a lot

Ensight case files...

This sounds more like a bug in the ensight reader than a problem with your
code. Can you send me a very small example (including the sos file)?

Ok. I am confused. You have 4 scalars with the same name? Which one of
these are you isosurfacing with and which do you want to color by?

Vorticity-Channel_512x128x256-**********-003.vec
vector per node: Vorticity   
Vorticity-Channel_512x128x256-**********-004.vec

are  4 data file associated to 4 part of  the geometry


I generate  isosurfaces with iso values of the scalar: Vortex.

I would like to colorize these surface with the streamwise components of 
the vorticity

You ' re right.
I can colorize it by the Magnitude of  the vorticity field.
So, I just need to write the streamwise Vorticity component as a scalar 
that I define in the case file

Since both share the geometry, why not put them in the same case file?
That way, you can directly color the isosurface with the other array.
Am I missing something?

Hi All

Has texture mapping been included in Paraview ? Have anyone written an xml
to include it as a filter in Paraview ?
Thanks in advance.

I would like to know, what 'python wrapping' can do for me
in paraview. Does anybody know where I can find information
about it?

Paraview still does not run. It throws "Expression: sequence not ordered", I
think line 859 in UpdateVtkObjects() (vtkSMProxy.cxx) is the culprit.
I am using the most recent CVS and I did a clean CMake and build.

Python wrapping in ParaView provides a Python scripting interface for
the ServerManager. When enabled, it will build a pvpython executable
which is a python interpretor. Once can access the proxy manager, create
new proxies, modify their properties etc using a python script. This is
similar to the current batch script written out by ParaView, except that
batch (*.pvb) is in tcl.

In the current CVS head, there are python scripting tests for the server
manager, they should be a good starting point to understand how to
access the Server Manager through python. Check in
Servers/ServerManager/Testing/Python.

Hope this helps,
Utkarsh.

ps. the CVS head has also been patched to install
libvtkPVServerCommonPython.so and libvtkPVServerManagerPython.so. Thanks
for bringing it to our attention.

This sounds nice! If I understand it correct, I will be able
to write batch file using python!?

Great!

Hi Fabian,

Yes, that's correct. Although, I don't think ParaView will ever be
writing out a batch file in python. However, one can use the "SMState"
file to achieve the same effect as the batch file written out by
paraview. (Look at the tests I mentioned earlier).

Utkarsh.

Yeah yeah yeah. It would be awesome. Vortex cores, shock waves etc.
Essentially this thing:

David N. Kenwright, Chris Henze, and Creon Levit. Feature extraction
of separation and attachment lines. IEEE Transactions on Visualization
and Computer Graphics, 5(2):135--144, April 1999.

Actually, the source code is available. I have it somewhere if you are
interested.

There is. I am attaching a custom streamline module to do it. To get it to work:

1. Checkout the 2.4 CVS branch for paraview (ParaView-2-4). I had to
fix two bugs to get this to work. 2.4.3 does not have these fixes.
2.4.4 will when it is released. Compile.

2. Put the two files I am attaching in a directory, something like
ParaViewModules. Set the PV_INTERFACE_PATH variable to this directory
(full path).

3. Start paraview.

4. Choose the source to streamline from

5. Apply Filters->Stream Tracer (2 inputs)

6. Set the Source to a seed source (only polygonal allowed, but it is
easy to change this)

If you need to reduce the number of seed points, you have to apply
some sort of decimation algorithm to the geometry, such as quadric
decimation. Let me know if it works for you.

Just CVS HEAD or also the ParaView-2-4 branch?  It would be nice if the 
latter could be fixed too.

Message-ID: <s42d3ba4.032@co.mgn.netl.doe.gov>

Hi all,
 
I need to put time information into a corner annotation.   The
annotation would be updated each step of the animation.
 
Is there a way to do this in paraview?
 
Thanks in advance.

There is but it is not straightforward. Which reader are you using?
