Subject: [Paraview] "Cell Data to Point Data" with CFD wall values
Message-ID: <4B951686-E2CF-4E83-8CA3-353F1DE93B2D@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm now trying to visualize CFD simulation data.
There are 3D-Cell and 2D-Wall elements
and each elements have cell-centered vector or scalar data.
Wall and Cell elements are read as a single Unstructured
Multiblock source.
Wall elements are exactly overlapping with cell surfaces.

I often use "Cell Data to Point Data" filter.
When I apply this filter for my Multiblock data,
point values of 3D-Cells and 2D-Walls are treated separately.
If possible, I want to replace point values of 3D-Cell surfaces'
with 2D-Walls'.

Does anyone have a good idea to do it?

Magician,

If you were using EnSight Gold formatted binary results output, you 
could use the EnSight "Part" construct to output (both in the same 
results file-set) the 2D-Wall elements and the 3D-Cell elements as 
separate displayable graphic objects (plus their point & cell data).

Then, in PV, use the "Extract Block" filter to select which "Parts" you 
want to display followed by any other filters you like.

What I would try is extract block filter to separate the 2 data sets. Then
use the resample with data set to project the wall point data to the
volumetric grid point data. I'm not sure if it will work without testing it
though.

Hey Scott,

I haven't heard of anyone doing this sort of work. In general, most of the VTK-related work with database queries seems to come from the statistics and information visualization side, rather than the large data scientific visualization folks which ParaView is traditionally aimed towards. So, you get people doing SQL queries to produce a VTK table, and from there the various things you can do with that.

It's not clear from your email what type of data you would be wanting to visualize with ParaView, and how the data in MongoDB would be structured. One large issue (and a reason you don't see much work in this direction) is that even if you store something like point coordinates in your database, you also need to describe the topology of the structures you're going to build with those points, whether that means just point vertices, or polygons of some sort, or regular grids. There just aren't any standard data formats which include something like a document-based NoSQL database for storing the data. The analogy that comes to my mind for something similar that ParaView can handle is the XDMF file format (xdmf.org). In this format, an HDF5 file can be used to store the data, but since that file format is so general and flexible, they need an XML file to go with the data which describes the topology, time steps, etc., and where to look in the HDF5 file for that information. You would have a similar issue, that MongoDB is almost infinitely flexible, and so unless there is a large community using it for similar purposes, who is willing to come up with a standard data format stored in the DB, there probably won't be something pre-made that you can use.

Now, on a more optimistic note, :), I tried a few minutes ago and had some success with reading information from a MongoDB database into ParaView using the Python Programmable Source. Some examples for creating data are here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter#Generating_Data_.28Programmable_Source.29

I had pymongo installed for the version of Python that ParaView 3.14 (downloaded binary, Mac OS X 10.7) happens to use (which I didn't know, but found by printing out sys.path and saw that it included /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages so my Python 2.5 was being used). You can see from the attached PNG image that I didn't generate any real geometric data to display, but I accessed MongoDB and queried it and printed out some values from the returned documents in the Output Window, so I'm confident that I could put some data in Mongo and use the examples on the ParaView site to create something real to display.

My knowledge isn't too deep in any of these areas, but I'll do what I can to answer other questions if you get stuck.

Good luck,
-Eric

Hi,

We are trying to open a .wind data set.? In the open file menu, ParaView lists the .wind format as a possible option.? Once we click open, however, it complains that a reader for that data format cannot be found.? This is true for the compiled-from-source and pre-compiled versions of ParaView 3.14.1. The wind blade source still exists in the VTK/Parallel folder and it is referenced in the corresponding CMakeLists.txt file. Any thoughts?

Thanks, Sohail

Hi Sohail,

a similar bug was fixed in master not so long ago. Could you try
master to see if the issue remains ?

Sam and Andy,


Thanks for your advices.
I found the order of applying filters is very important.
Here is a good step:
> 1. Extract Fluid block(s)
> 2. Cell Data to Point Data at Original Multiblock
> 3. Resample Data Sets of Original Multiblock at Fluid Block(s)

Most cases are OK with above step, but some cases including
non-contiguous interface failed on resampling step
(mismatching about Tuple Length).

Message-ID: <CAOgitUZcYSMeme+e=N0b0KyXj8NYtsibtyrvLjrLO5rJPNbMwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I could not find the solution for this problem on the web though
several people seem to have faced it or a similar one.
I want to install paraview-pcl plugin, so I need to build paraview
from source (latest: Paraview 3.14.1). I am using macosx 10.6.8
(intel), cmake2.8.6, qt4.8.2
cmake works fine. but the compilation fails because of:

ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Common/vtkArrayIteratorTemplate.txx:123:
error: ambiguous overload for ?operator<<? in ?(os << indent) <<
"Array: "?

I checked google, and apparently some people got this problem because
of a long long support, but in my case cmake returns:
-- Checking if ostream supports long long
-- Checking if ostream supports long long -- yes
-- Checking if istream supports long long
-- Checking if istream supports long long -- yes

and the CMakeCache variables are:

VTK_ISTREAM_SUPPORTS_LONG_LONG:INTERNAL=1
VTK_OSTREAM_SUPPORTS_LONG_LONG:INTERNAL=1

Do you have any idea on how to solve this problem?

Thanks
julie

I get the same problem in both 3.14.1 and master. The reader is still
available but just not conveniently through the GUI. To access it though
you can bring up the python shell and do the following:

>>> w = WindBladereader()

>>> w.Filename = "<path>/test1_topo.wind"

>>> Show()

>>> Render()


This shouldn't be too hard of a fix for ParaView. I'll let you know when
it's done.

Hi Sohail,

I went through the code and it jogged my memory about previous problems
with it. It had an explicit MPI call in the constructor that would cause
problems when paraview wasn't getting built with MPI. Any time a user tried
to open an unknown file it would try to create a windblade reader to see if
the reader could handle the file and this would cause a crash. If you
launch a separate pvserver the wind blade reader will be available in the
gui.

If someone fixes this problem in the reader we can enable it properly
through the gui. Right now though I'm getting a bunch of warnings when
running in serial like:
Warning: In
/home/acbauer/CODE/ParaView/ParaView/VTK/IO/Parallel/vtkWindBladeReader.cxx,
line 942
vtkWindBladeReader (0x3a0c800): WindBladeReader error reading file:
/home/acbauer/DATA/VTKLargeData/Data/WindBladeReader/test1_topo.wind
Premature EOF while reading block of data. Expected 896000 but got 0

Hello People,


I would like to replace the points at the representation by other objects. It could be anything like small elephants,... I need it for my master thesis. I have two show different mapping methods and therefor I think the easiest way would be to replace the points by an image.

Can someone help me an tell me how I could replace them? Maybe with the text editor?

Thx,

Subject: [Paraview] Changing Axes
Message-ID: <CAFs8s7p=P30YoAuWrVTr1surVe--N6cKq_3Oc9NKmBxdUn0=Hw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I recently started using paraview to visualize the data in
our research group.

I had a question regarding a transformation I want to do on my data set in
paraview. The x and z axis of my data set are flipped (due to array shaping
conventions in C++) and after opening the raw binary file in paraview, I
want to flip the axes.

Flipping x<-->z changes the handedness of a coordinate system, so I don't
think it can be done using transform filter's rotation capabilities.

I was hoping someone could give a suggestion on how to approach the issue.

Thanks for the help,
Deniz

There is a reflection filter that should do the trick. You should also be able to use the transform filter to scale by -1 along one axis.

Subject: [Paraview] Accessing Z buffer when rendering remotely
Message-ID: <4FF46CBE.3030302@man.poznan.pl>

Hi!

I've been doing some experiments with accessing the RGBA data and Z 
buffer from the rendering window in ParaView. What I noticed is that the 
Z buffer is not available, when the rendering is done on the server. Is 
there any way to retrieve it?

Here is a script I've been using. When the RemoteRenderThreshold is set 
to 0 I only see 2D elements (e.g. color map legend) in the outz.tiff 
file. When set to some bigger value to make it render locally, all the 
objects are seen in outz.tiff.

------------------------------------------
import sys

from paraview.simple import *
from paraview.vtk import *
from vtkIOPython import *
from vtkRenderingPython import *

Connect("beech")

servermanager.LoadState(sys.argv[1])
SetActiveView(GetRenderView())

view = GetRenderView()
window = view.GetRenderWindow()

view.RemoteRenderThreshold = 0

renderer = view.GetRenderer()

w2i = vtkWindowToImageFilter()
w2i.SetInputBufferTypeToRGBA()
w2i.SetInput(window)

zw2i = vtkWindowToImageFilter()
zw2i.SetInputBufferTypeToZBuffer()
zw2i.SetInput(window)

writer = vtkTIFFWriter()
writer.SetInputConnection(w2i.GetOutputPort())
writer.SetFileName("/tmp/out.tiff")

zwriter = vtkTIFFWriter()
zwriter.SetInputConnection(zw2i.GetOutputPort())
zwriter.SetFileName("/tmp/outz.tiff")

writer.Write()
zwriter.Write()

Chris,

Instructions for PV 3.14.1:

Load the PointSprite plugin
Load your data set
Change representation to Point Sprite
Display tab - Point Sprite Mode: Texture
              Point Sprite Texture: Load...
Select a bitmap file you like in the file dialog. Ok.

Hope this helps
Karl

You could set up transparency (opacity) of the larger model in the
display tab. Otherwise, try to set the larger model's representation
to 'cull frontface' (also in the display tab).

Hi Chris,

I'm not entirely sure I understand what you intend to do.
The Point Sprite plugin works similar to ParaView's Glyph filter: every
point in the input data set gets replaced by geometrical primitives or
basic geometric shapes and forms or - in case of the Point Sprite plugin
- a texture. The same object/texture for all points in the current data
set. The texture to apply by the Point Sprite plugin, you can load in
the Display tab in frame "PointSprite" from the drop-down list with
label "Point Sprite Texture:" the entry "Load..."

Subject: [Paraview] time series not working with xyz or lammps-dump reader
 && presenting millions of atoms by "spheres"
Message-ID: <CA+wwKMvA5dc4uH7Dn6iX6=16dp_NEaqJFMogL-kxYbBR3-wBVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am new to this extremely powerful visualization tool and I use the 3.14
version of paraview binary on windows 7 . Both binary and compiled one on
linux.
I could not get the following 2 things to work for me.

1. The xyz and lammps-dump reader comes along with the binary, but I do not
see them in the compiled one, why?
    Then with the binary, I try to load up multi-block xyz or lammps-dump
files, I can only get the first frame. I check "Information" tab on the
left, the "Index" and "Value" of Time is blank. So there is something
wrong. Both the xyz and lammps-dump files are produced by lammps and can be
recognized by other visualization software. So I think I need to do
something about the readers. So can someone tell me how to get this done?
   Eventually, I want to be able to add whatever readers in paraview by
myself so that I can stop converting hundreds of gigabytes of data from one
format to another.  First, I want to find the xyz and lammps-dump readers
within the source code and try to understand and tweak them. Then I can
follow the more comprehensive manual to do more things. I just could not
find them in the source folder, can someone point them to me?

2. For publication purpose, I want to render the points as spheres without
"masking points". I tried the "sphere" option in "glyph" filter. It worked
pretty well when the number of "spheres" were limited to 5000. But when I
tried to represent a million atoms with spheres, paraview won't be
responding for a long time and I have to kill the process. So I wondering
if there is a way that I can present millions of atoms with "sphere" in
paraview more efficiently ?

Thanks for your attention

Best,
Jian

Hi All,
I am building ParaView from the Git repository and for some reason it is
looking for MPI even though I have PARAVIEW_USE_MPI turned off.
I can't see any other setting that is forcing MPI to be turned on.

Is there something I am missing or is there an error in the configuration
files?

My output is:
...

-- Could NOT find MPI_CXX (missing:  MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES
MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH)

I had the same issue.  If I remember correctly, I "think" the solution was to turn off BUILD_EXAMPLES and BUILD_TESTING.

Thanks, Scott,

Yes, that does the trick. I guess this is not being seen on the dashboard
because those machines all have MPI running.
So there is a need to look at the CMakeLists.txt files for examples and
testing to make sure that if MPI is excluded then those examples/tests need
to be excluded.

Thanks

Hi Jian,

for 1.) have a look at my liggghts text- and binary reader at 
http://web678.public1.linz.at/Drupal/?q=node/681 (you have to register 
to see the attached files) as a starting point for your own implemention.
for 2.) you can use the PointSprite Plugin, I've written a HowTo here: 
http://web678.public1.linz.at/Drupal/?q=system/files/howto_paraview.pdf

greez,
Christian

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF Time value problem
Message-ID: <4FF6E08F.2040103@tp4.rub.de>

Greetings!

I have a collection of XDMF files, each of which contains the state of my simulation at a single instant of time. The goal is to read them into Paraview all at once, and then generate an animation with time as a parameter using the green arrow buttons. Unfortunately, I am having much trouble getting this to work.
A simplified version of my set of files (just XML, no HDF involved to demonstrate the idea and the problem) goes like this: File "timetest_1.xmf" reads:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf Version="2.0">
 <Domain>
   <Grid Name="timetest_mesh">
     <Time Value="0.1" />
     <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions="3 2 2"/>
     <Geometry GeometryType="Origin_DxDyDz">
       <DataItem Dimensions="3"> 0.0 0.0 0.0 </DataItem>
       <DataItem Dimensions="3"> 0.1 0.2 0.3 </DataItem>
     </Geometry>
     <Attribute Name="numbers">
       <DataItem Dimensions="2 2 3">
	 4 3 4 3 1 2  0 0 1 2 3 4
       </DataItem>
     </Attribute>
   </Grid>
 </Domain>
</Xdmf>

"timetest_2.xmf" looks the same except that the time value is "0.2" and the values in the "numbers" attribute are chosen to be a bit different, and similarly for "timetest_3.xmf". I can load the whole set as "timetest_..xmf" into PV (3.14 64bit Linux, if that should matter), but when I hit play, the time runs from 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.1 but only showing data from the very first file. The last number field in the animation toolbar never shows anything else than 0. The "Time" information field gives the correct (initial!) time value but an "index" of 0, also when loading the files individually.

Does anyone have a clue what I am doing wrong? Creating animations from my simulation is essential to my application of PV, so I'd be great if someone could have a look at this. For a quick test, the mentioned set of files can be obtained from [http://www.tp4.rub.de/~jk/temp/xdmf_timetest.zip].

We've never had any luck getting time series with XDMF to work correctly in Paraview.

However, we create animations all the time. Using the python trace feature, we set up the image using one of the files from the dataset. Then we modify the generated trace file slightly (make it so it's a function that takes in the file number we want, and delete the pipeline at the end so it doesn't blow up memory) and then create the frames through a python driver script. 

It's actually very simple and can be done in parallel with either multiple processors generating an image or multiple images being generated simultaneously.

I am still struggling with this problem, so I figured I would re-post the question to the general list in hopes of getting a wider audience!

Thanks in advance for any help you may provide!

For Completeness, I have verified that I am setting the number of output ports in my constructor.

Thanks again for any help!

Hello,

I am attempting to write a reader that handles both structured grids and meta-data.  It was recommended to me that I use multiple ports, and populate a vtkTable with the meta-data.

I think I am having some conceptual problems with how this is supposed to work.

I have written a dummy reader in an attempt to get the meta-data working prior to porting it to my real reader, but I am having trouble?

My understanding is that I need to


 1.  specify the number of output ports with this->SetNumberOfOutputPorts(2)
 2.  Populate the output port information
int vtkGenericReader::FillOutputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation* info)

{

  switch(port)

    {

    case 0:

      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkStructuredGrid");

      break;

    case 1:

      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkTable");

      break;

    }

  return 1;

}



3. Get the informationObject from the outputVector

   outputvector->GetInformationObject(1);



4. Get the table data

     this->MetaData = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>

      (this->MetaDataOutInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));



5. Add string to the table



  vtkStringArray *MetaString = vtkStringArray::New();

  MetaString->SetName("Meta Data");

  MetaString->SetNumberOfComponents(1);

  MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is a Test");

  MetaString->InsertNextValue("Test 2");

  MetaString->InsertNextValue("Test 3");

  this->MetaData->AddColumn(MetaString);





It is my understanding that this information should then be available in the ParaView GUI.





The problems I am having are this:



1.  When attempting to get both port information objects on the first call to RequestInformation(), port 1 returns a NULL object.  On the SECOND call to GetInformation(), both ports are available.



2.  All calls to RequestData() only provide access to port 0 in the Output information Vector.  I can access port 1 if I utilize this->getExecutive()->getOutputInformation(1)



3.  When using #2 to get the information, I populate, but I am unsure where/how things are supposed to be accessible in the GUI.





What I am trying to do is be able to access the meta-data values from within ParaView so that I can utilize data values, units, model run data, etc.



If anyone can help me understand what is supposed to be going on, or if I am completely doing something wrong, I would be grateful!  Am I missing some steps? Do I need to have XML code to access the vtkTable?





Thanks,

Can you post you reader's code? It might make things easier.

Hi Utkarsh,

Here is the generic reader I am experimenting with? I haven't ported
anything into my actual reader yet, as I am just trying to get the second
port to work before messing with my actual reader.

Thanks for helping!

You've used 
  switch(port)
    {
    case 0:
      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkStructuredGrid");
      break;

    case 1:
      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkTable");
      break;
    }

But I always use
  if (port==0) {
    info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkPointSet");
  }
  else if (port==1) {
    info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkPointSet");
  }

Does that fix it?

I think the example you gave me was for input ports, not output ports...  it
generates the following paraview error:

ERROR: In 
/Users/jjm390/Development/paraview/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Filtering/vtk

vtkGenericReader(0x7fbfdec5e4a0) did not create output for port 0 when
asked by REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT and does not specify any DATA_TYPE_NAME.

I think the example you gave me was for input ports, not output ports...  it generates the following paraview error:

ERROR: In
/Users/jjm390/Development/paraview/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Filtering/vtk
DemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 689
vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (0x7fbfdec84150): Algorithm
vtkGenericReader(0x7fbfdec5e4a0) did not create output for port 0 when asked by REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT and does not specify any DATA_TYPE_NAME.

Joshua,

Can you attach a data file to test the reader out as well? In the mean
time here are few things I see:

1. RequestInformation() should produce meta-data about both output
ports, not just the one requested for. (I will have to dig in the code
to confirm).
2. You should not be saving the information objects passed into
RequestInformation(..) i.e. there should be no place for
this->DataOutInfo, this->MetaDataOutInfo!
3. In RequestData, you can get access to the output data object by
vtkDataObject::GetData(outputVector, 0) or
vtkDataObject::GetData(outputVector, 1) and NOT
this->GetExecutive()->GetOutputInformation(). You can also use
vtkTable::GetData(outputVector, 1).

Try fixing these issues, I am guessing that should solve the problems
you are experiencing too.

I am trying to make an exact same build as what is on ParaViews web site so I can build a plugin that is compatible with it. Is disabling VRPN going to cause issues if I don't build my paraview with it but then try to use my plugin with the ParaView from the web site?

Thanks

Hello people,

I try to save the display option cull frontface within different file formats. Until now I have not had success. I would appriciate to save it in x3d. Otherwise another file format would be also okay, so I would change it afterwards to x3d with another program.

Does someone know if there is a possibility to save display options?

Thx,

 from OpenFOAM Reader
Message-ID: <20120708101713.148130@gmx.net>

Hi there,

I am using Paraview from the git-reopsitory (origin/master). I compiled it to use the VisItBridge.

The included OpenFOAM Reader (should be the one of the VisItBridge), throws the messages "Unexpected property: MeshStatus" and "Unexpected property: MeshRegions". The mesh i snot shown afterwards.

I am trying to create my own VisIt Plugin but I get the same message "Unexpected property: MeshStatus". 

Finding out what causes these messages would help me to find out if it is my code or something in paraview/visit.

Thanks in advance.

Rouven

Message-ID: <CAFYzz27KS2sZ-s0koxDovKRO0gJ7gBRVOOpV4Ny=NEwh7=0-og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been playing with writing a reader for ParaView.  I followed the
Kitware instructions from here

http://www.kitware.com/products/html/WritingAParaViewReaderPlug-in.html

I managed to get the source to build and ended up with a .so file as
expected.  When I try and load in ParaView via

Tools-> ManagePlugins ->Load new, I get the following error

mydevelopment/pvplugin/cvsReader/build/libCSVImage.so: undefined symbol:
_ZTV17vtkCSVImageReader

If I do *nm libCSVImage.so | grep " _ZTV17vtkCSVImageReader", *the output is

U _ZTV17vtkCSVImageReader

Can some one please give me any pointers? I am on Ubuntu-12.04, gcc-4.4.7
and ParaView-3.14.1 on a 32bit machine.

I am also attaching the code I used to generate the .so files.


Regards,
Rakesh

In this page "http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/ParaView:Texture"
The first step is to do "File -> Load Texture", which seems to not
exist in Paraview 3.12.

how to using texture mapping in Paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] VRPN Setup
Message-ID: <CAN-CANJ3XbK8out=PNb+ieq+j3uQQLguunEOMeVYg0qwuTbuFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use paraview's VRPN functionality for head tracking. I've
compiled Paraview 3.14.1 on linux (64) and I have one stereo screen. I'm
using a Windows tracking server with IOTracker hardware / software.

What works:
Stereoscopic rendering (I use the cube source as a test).
Independently of paraview, "vrpn_print_devices" can receive VRPN data.
(i.e. the tracking numbers change when I move the target)

What doesn't:
When I move the tracking target, nothing visibly happens in Paraview.
Expected result:
The viewing angle should change somehow then the tracking target moves. I
have not configured the geometry yet but I expect to see some change in the
display.

The build:
I compiled Paraview with the following enabled:
BUILD_SHARED_LIB, PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI, PARAVIEW_USE_MPI
and PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_VRPlugin
I also enabled PARAVIEW_USE_VRPN and disabled PARAVIEW_USE_VRUI

Note: Initially, that build failed so I enabled both VRPN and VRUI. Later,
I wondered if this was causing problems, so I disabled VRUI again and
modified the source to make it compile. I just had to add a Queue member to
the pqInternals object inside the VRPN ifdef (copied from the VRUI ifdef).
Let me know if I should report that as a bug, or if I'm just wrong.

Running:
I saved a state file with the cube source. I modified the state file by
adding the lines below at the end, just before </Paraview>. Then I
restarted Paraview, loaded the VR plugin and loaded the modified state.

Note: I could not find a ViewManager section in the state file as I
expected from the howto. Also, I have not configured a pvserver to run a
"CAVE" type display, I am just using the default server (localhost). I plan
to configure the display geometry correctly once I know the tracking
"works", i.e. does something. Is this ok?

Any help greatly appreciated.

Se?n

Hello Se?n,

 

1. When you use PV under Windows with head tracking, you should use always
VRPN. 

2. Head tracking only works with a pvserver environment. Therefore you have
to define a Server configuration file with proper display parameters (read
more
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display#Structure_of_PVX_C
onfig_File ). These information let run PV on server side in CAVE mode and
activate an off-axis-projection calculation. Hence the paraview client does
not provide such configuration properties you cannot see any effect of a
moving target directly in the client.

3. Which source version you are using? The queue bug should be already fixed
in the master branch. 

 

Hope this helps,

 

Cheers,

Stephan

Hi Sean,

Head tracking is only enabled on the server side i.e in CAVE displays.
Display configuration is tightly tied in with tracking and so the client
camera ignores HeadPose value and that's the reason you don't see anything
on the PVClient.

Hi Nikhil and Stephan,

Outstanding response time, thanks! As you say, my first mistake is not
using a CAVE client-server setup.

I have set up a CAVE display with the short pvx file below, (borrowed from
the CAVE example). I run the server with
pvserver /path/to/config.pvx
I don't use MPI because I only have 1 screen and hence 1 process. I launch
the client (by ssh from another machine) with
paraview --stereo --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes" --server="hubble1"
--state=/path/to/1.pvsm
where "hubble1" is the local hostname, and also the PVserver name.

Result: A "cave" type window is launched in fullscreen mode on the main
display showing a stereo image. The standard Paraview client is available
on the remote machine (via X forwarding). I can manipulate the session with
the mouse on the remote machine. Moving the tracking targets has no effect
on the main display.

Perhaps I should save the state from the CAVE session and append the VRPN
settings to that one instead?

Thanks,

Se?n

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview QT plugin
Message-ID: <loom.20120709T145115-821@post.gmane.org>

Hi all, I am trying to write my own qt gui which I would like to integrate in 
Paraview. Searching in internet, I did not find anything useful.
But after looking at some examples, I created a header and cxx file with the 
toolbar example illustrated in some tutorials. I created an CMakeList file 
too, by writing as stated in the tutorial:

 FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4 REQUIRED)
 FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
 INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

 include(${QT_USE_FILE}) 
 QT4_WRAP_CPP(MOC_SRCS SourceToolbar.h)

 ADD_PARAVIEW_ACTION_GROUP(IFACES IFACE_SRCS 
                         CLASS_NAME SourceToolbar
                         GROUP_NAME "SourceToolbar")
 

 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(SourceToolbar "1.0"
                   GUI_INTERFACES ${IFACES}
                   SOURCES ${MOC_SRCS} ${IFACE_SRCS} 
                   SourceToolbar.cxx)

Then I opened the CMake and was trying to run configurate, but it is not 
running. The errors are:

add_executable cannot create imported target "vtkEncodeString" because
another target with the same name already exists.

So, already running a simple example does not work. Can anybody please help?

Hi, I have the same problem:

add_executable cannot create imported target "vtkEncodeString" because
  another target with the same name already exists

and there is no option to choose "shared lib" or so. This error appears 
already in the configure step.
I played with the CMakeList file and inserted there all the examples found in 
internet, but it does not work.

Thanks Nikhil.

I should have mentioned that I have set the VRplugin to load automatically
both for the server and client (and checked that it is marked as "loaded"
in the manager). My apologies for not mentioning that in the last message.

The figures I used in the pvx file describing the corners of the screen (in
the coordinates / units of the tracking system) are not correct, I just
used them for testing. I was still expecting to see some change on the
display when I move the tracking target (even if it's not the "correct"
change). I can recalibrate the system to rule this out, but I suspect that
this will not solve the problem.

Perhaps I can use a network monitoring tool to see if Paraview is actually
connecting to the tracking server.

Se?n

Subject: [Paraview] Exporting Depth slices as 2D bitmap images
Message-ID: <CAGgO1-6AwsUMYUyec8wZ7Qpde3nrxh1Q-woo6EYYxFfvxPzh=w@mail.gmail.com>

I have a large amount of geophysical data that i need to export regular
Depth slices from as Bitmap images. Ideally it would be possible to use
Slice offset values to create a regular distribution of slices and be able
to export them all as individual bitmap images however the only way i've
found to extract bitmap images is using screenshots. This requires creating
a slice, screenshotting, cropping the image, moving the slice and
repeating. Am i missing something or is what i'm hoping to do impossible
with Paraview?

thanks

If upstream doesn't have that version available anymore, copy the tar
ball we've saved off here:
http://paraview.org/files/dependencies/
into your super build directory and it won't try to fetch it directly.

Also, I don't think that disabling vrpn will matter, only the VRPN
plugin uses its symbols.

Your class is missing implementations of various methods defined in
the header including PrintSelf, New, etc. Provide implementations for
those that the .so loading errors go away. Your CSVImage.xml is also
an invalid xml. You may want to correct that.

Subject: [Paraview] time series not working with xyz or lammps-dump
 reader && presenting millions of atoms by "spheres"
Message-ID: <CA+wwKMshY-LJyo98t=VtAO3eYF0mN5W=rXrAta3L-bxtwqdP8g@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks very much, Christian.

1. The point sprite plugin is really cool. It allows efficient atomic
presentation with control of the color, radius and opacity of individual
atoms. I tried this on win7 64 system with precompiled 3.14 paraview.  It
only works for the object loaded by xyz file reader not lammps dump file
reader. And when I tune the atom radius and opacity back and forth from
"constant value" to "c_1 (atomic scalar)", some warning shows up
"Warning: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\Rendering\vtkShaderProgram2.cxx, line 382
vtkShaderProgram2 (00000000135CBAB0): another program was used (id=5), our
id is1."
And when I continue to tune atom radius and opacity, numerous such warnings
show up and pavraview will not respond to my tuning, although I can still
rotation or pan the object.

2. I registered CFDEM, but I somehow cannot download the attachment other
than the two pdf files. So can you send them to me through email? Thanks a
lot!

Jian

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Widget, GUI and widget representation disappeared
Message-ID: <000901cd5e66$d1bc8300$75358900$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

since switch VTK to 6.0 and the integration of new panel into PV I have
trouble with an existing test plugin which holds a custom widget. To create
a custom widget, I've used the ADD_3DWIDGET in my CMakeList:

ADD_3DWIDGET(OUTIFACES OUTSRCS
    CLASS_NAME pqTestWidget
    WIDGET_TYPE TestWidget)

The class pqTestWidget handles the GUI stuff. My (test) widget
representation is a duplication of vtkSplineRepresentation class which uses
the new VTK 6.0 API. I never had any problems with this test plugin, until
now. The GUI isn't visible any more, even when "Advanced" is pressed. Also,
the representation itself is not displayed in my 3D view. Putting some debug
output messages in the constructor of pqTestWidget show me, that it this
class is never being instantiated. I did some research to find out where the
problem is but was not able to handle it. Can anyone help me?

Thanks.

Cheer,
Stephan

one thing to look out for : make sure depth peeling is turned off if you make use of the point sprite opacity features. The shader used by the depth peeling conflicts with the shader used in the point sprite.

Thanks very much, Christian.

1. The point sprite plugin is really cool. It allows efficient atomic presentation with control of the color, radius and opacity of individual atoms. I tried this on win7 64 system with precompiled 3.14 paraview.  It only works for the object loaded by xyz file reader not lammps dump file reader. And when I tune the atom radius and opacity back and forth from "constant value" to "c_1 (atomic scalar)", some warning shows up
"Warning: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\Rendering\vtkShaderProgram2.cxx, line 382
vtkShaderProgram2 (00000000135CBAB0): another program was used (id=5), our id is1."
And when I continue to tune atom radius and opacity, numerous such warnings show up and pavraview will not respond to my tuning, although I can still rotation or pan the object.

2. I registered CFDEM, but I somehow cannot download the attachment other than the two pdf files. So can you send them to me through email? Thanks a lot!

Thanks, Scott,

Yes, that does the trick. I guess this is not being seen on the dashboard because those machines all have MPI running.
So there is a need to look at the CMakeLists.txt files for examples and testing to make sure that if MPI is excluded then those examples/tests need to be excluded.

Thanks

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] ParaView looking for MPI when it shouldn't.

Hi All,
I am building ParaView from the Git repository and for some reason it is looking for MPI even though I have PARAVIEW_USE_MPI turned off.
I can't see any other setting that is forcing MPI to be turned on.

Is there something I am missing or is there an error in the configuration files?

My output is:
...
- Filter ZLIB is ON
-- Could NOT find MPI_C (missing:  MPI_C_LIBRARIES MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH)
-- Could NOT find MPI_CXX (missing:  MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH)
CMake Error at VTK/Parallel/MPI/CMakeLists.txt:35 (message):
  MPIEXEC was empty.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1

Hello people,

I try to save the animation cull frontface. It is available in the Display pannel. I tried to save it now in several formats. But it was not working.
Does someone know how I can save the animation?

Thx,

Hi Jian,

for 1.) have a look at my liggghts text- and binary reader at
http://web678.public1.linz.at/Drupal/?q=node/681 (you have to register
to see the attached files) as a starting point for your own implemention.
for 2.) you can use the PointSprite Plugin, I've written a HowTo here:

Hi Nikhil,

My config and state files are attached.

While running Paraview, I used netstat to look for a connection to the
tracking server, but found no connection. If I use "vrpn_print_devices
iotracker at 192.168.20.9" then netstat can find the connection.

By the way, the vrpn_print_devices command returns information on 2
different "sensors". Should I be selecting one of them in the state file?
Or is this standard for a single tracking device?

Thanks,

Se?n

Subject: [Paraview] Macro calling functions in separated files
Message-ID: <CAF__GamZizhyGvUX3JNqZhD3ossd8Uhyu9vVt77+FPT_QdNN8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



I create a macro for data post-treatment in ParaView. This macro represents
a geometry (STL file) and after plots for example pressure, computed
vorticity or streamlines.

My objective now is to decompose this macro to multiple python files (every
file *.py contain a python function that use a ParaView filter). The first
function uses STLReader and when I run the macro in ParaView, I got this
error message:



Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 1461, in <module>

File "C:\Project2\Fonctions\RepresentationGeometrie_v1.py", line 19, in
RepresentationGeometrie

ReaderSTL=STLReader(FileNames=[STL])

NameError: global name 'STLReader' is not defined



Thanks for any help.
Hicham

VRPN can return a number of tracking sensors but you need to pick one. For
example if you want to use Kinect with FAAST then you get around 23 tracked
sensors. Paraview is capable of only handling two tracked sensors one for
head and one for hand/wand. If you have two tracking devices then use one
for head and another for wand(hand) tracking. If you need to simply test
tracking then you can set wand pose instead of head because the wand is not
disabled on client so you can see stuff move on the screen.

I'll take a look at the files and let you know if I find something wrong
with it.

Thanks Nikhil. I guess I'll troubleshoot the connection first and then
worry about the number of sensors. It's possible that Paraview is just
dropping the connection due to an incorrect number of sensors though, or
some other issue with the data received. I'll report back with any findings.

Thanks again,

Se?n

create a .vtk file to be read into paraview, this includes a scalar

I'm afraid my knowledge here is a bit limited.? All of my edits have been in relation to loading the blade data.? The MPI calls were put in by someone else.


By the way, is the wind blade reader updated in VTK as well? (i.e. the VTK package)? I remember downloading VTK a while ago and there was a mismatch between that windbladereader and the one in ParaView.

Hi Sohail,

I went through the code and it jogged my memory about previous problems with it. It had an explicit MPI call in the constructor that would cause problems when paraview wasn't getting built with MPI. Any time a user tried to open an unknown file it would try to create a windblade reader to see if the reader could handle the file and this would cause a crash. If you launch a separate pvserver the wind blade reader will be available in the gui.

If someone fixes this problem in the reader we can enable it properly through the gui. Right now though I'm getting a bunch of warnings when running in serial like:
Warning: In /home/acbauer/CODE/ParaView/ParaView/VTK/IO/Parallel/vtkWindBladeReader.cxx, line 942
vtkWindBladeReader (0x3a0c800): WindBladeReader error reading file: /home/acbauer/DATA/VTKLargeData/Data/WindBladeReader/test1_topo.wind Premature EOF while reading block of data. Expected 896000 but got 0

Dear Paraview community, 

I have a question in regards to saving the procedure for cutting a 3D object. I have a 3D object (a box) in which I am only interested in specific slices for visualization purposes. This is a problem that arises mostly in image reconstruction using tomographic data. 

I do not like doing the same cut every time I load the 3D object. I would like to do it once and save it and everytime I load the 3D object, the same cuts apply. Is there an easy procedure to do this in paraview. 

Thank you in advance for your response. 

Bests,

Yes, you can save ParaView's state through the Save State item in the
File menu. You can then reload this state file using the Load State
item in the File menu. The state will include your 3D object and the
slices so you won't have to recreate them.

Dear Sam and Cory, 

My physical object is the same, however, the values on the cell would change each time. Think of it as different realization of a stochastic field. I thought Save State only saves the current values and loads it each time. 

What I actually want is to save only the views!... 

Any comment? 
Bests, 
Hatef

Can you post the dataset? It would help identify if the issue is with
the cutter or with the dataset.

In recent versions of ParaView, when you load a state file, you should
be able to choose the input file for your 3D data with the different
cell values. Your cuts will be in the same position, so your "view" of
the data won't change.

Hello everyone,

Can anyone estimate when next ParaView release will arrive? From
several previous release dates, I believe it should be somewhere in
September / October, am I right?

Best regards,
Nenad.

That is about right.

The plan is to call it 4.0-alpha and have 4.0 final three months or so
after that.

I'm guessing the exporter just doesn't handle textures at all. That
was probably an oversight.

Hi Nikhil,

I have fixed the networking issues. There was an error in my state file and
I had also made an embarrassing mistake with the build. It works now and
the display moves when I move the tracking target. I recalibrated the
tracking system and measured the coordinates of the screen corners in mm
(which seems to be the unit used by the tracking system).

How should I represent these coordinates in the pvx file? I tried replacing
the coordinates of the screen corners as shown below, but when I load the
state file I can't see anything on the cave screen (just the background
colour). If I use the coordinates from the example on the web, I can see
something but it doesn't appear correct.

Thanks a lot for your input, it's much appreciated.

Se?n

> So typically the if your tracking is in millimeters then your display is
configured in millimeters and that means your scene units are also in
millimeters. Typically we assume that the tracking is in meters and so is
also the assumption in the document. You could either apply a transform on
the tracker (scale) or on the scene.

You can apply a tracker transform on the <VRPNConnection> tag
  <Tracker id="0" name="something">
<TrackerTransform value=" 1 0 0 0
                                                0 1 0 0

I'm not aware of any option to build/link against mpi-io.? This is just a standard build with mpi support that suffers from this issue.


The ParaView website's builds also have the same bug.

I added the MPI calls to be in sync with what was being added in the simulation.?

In the SuperComputing demo last year, we updated both the HiGrad FireTec to use MPI-IO and likewise ParaView to do the same thing. ?

It was working when I last checked it in November. ?It could be that you didn't build or link against MPI-IO? ?It might require that the build needs to be guarded if you don't have MPI-IO. ?

I thought I did that but it might have gotten changed during the VTK overhaul? That's the only thing that I can think of at the moment, because I'm pretty sure I had it working in serial with MPI-IO (it shouldn't matter.)

I'm afraid my knowledge here is a bit limited.? All of my edits have been in relation to loading the blade data.? The MPI calls were put in by someone else.


By the way, is the wind blade reader updated in VTK as well? (i.e. the VTK package)? I remember downloading VTK a while ago and there was a mismatch between that windbladereader and the one in ParaView.

Hi Sohail,

I went through the code and it jogged my memory about previous problems with it. It had an explicit MPI call in the constructor that would cause problems when paraview wasn't getting built with MPI. Any time a user tried to open an unknown file it would try
 to create a windblade reader to see if the reader could handle the file and this would cause a crash. If you launch a separate pvserver the wind blade reader will be available in the gui.

If someone fixes this problem in the reader we can enable it properly through the gui. Right now though I'm getting a bunch of warnings when running in serial like:
Warning: In /home/acbauer/CODE/ParaView/ParaView/VTK/IO/Parallel/vtkWindBladeReader.cxx, line 942
vtkWindBladeReader (0x3a0c800): WindBladeReader error reading file: /home/acbauer/DATA/VTKLargeData/Data/WindBladeReader/test1_topo.wind Premature EOF while reading block of data. Expected 896000 but got 0

I was reluctant to enable the reader in serial (i.e. not using MPI IO which
I think is getting done by default with the parallel build) because of the
following warnings that I got:

Warning: In /home/acbauer/CODE/ParaView/
ParaView/VTK/IO/Parallel/vtkWindBladeReader.cxx, line 942
vtkWindBladeReader (0x3a0c800): WindBladeReader error reading file:
/home/acbauer/DATA/VTKLargeData/Data/WindBladeReader/test1_topo.wind
Premature EOF while reading block of data. Expected 896000 but got 0

I just assumed that it was getting bad results so I didn't check the serial
output with the parallel output. In either case the code should be changed
before enabling it in serial so that it reads the files correctly and
doesn't produce any warning messages.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Python Programmable Filter Requesting
	Additional Ghost Data
Message-ID: <CAASrb3pw8BfnJc0hu_wvDgQoLRLHbPqwhU-=rqF4vhOLR7G6NA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to request ghost data in my python programmable filter but I am
not sure how to go about and do so. I am assuming the call would go into
the RequestUpdateExtent Script.

In the C++ equivalent filters that do request ghost data, the call to is
something along the lines of
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS() , and
there are examples of that in the Paraview source but the way the objects
are defined and called does not translate into Paraview VTK Python. What
would be the appropriate call?

Thank you,
Jesus

OK, So I have figured out where the problem lay, but I don't know how to
fix it (if I can)...

The problem only arrises if I try to use the reader as a time-series
reader.  If I take out the time-series XML, then it works fine.

I am attaching my generic reader... there is no dataset required... just open
any txt file and it will just produce sample data.

If you remove the file-series portion of the reader, you will see the
reader works fine...

Please let me know what you think...

Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A2893F9E8@CHIMBX1.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi,

I built ParaView with CoProcessing support and the Fortran adaptors. I also set PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT to ON  in CMake. Everything built successfully, but CPack didn't package some files and I'm not sure if this is by design.

My cpack command was

$ cpack --verbose --debug -G TGZ --config CommandLineExecutables/CPackParaViewServersConfig.cmake

The files that weren't packaged were
${PV_SRC_DIR}/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/FortranAdaptorAPI.h
${PV_SRC_DIR}/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx
${PV_BUILD_DIR}/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/CPUseFortran.h
${PV_BUILD_DIR}/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/FortranAdaptorAPIMangling.h

Are those just example files and the expectation is that users should roll their own Fortran adaptors or copy those to their own project dir?

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [Paraview] Loading a series of .plt files
Message-ID: <000e01cd603c$3ad90da0$b08b28e0$@fdy.tu-darmstadt.de>

Dear all,

 

I was trying to load a series of Tecplot files (.plt) in Paraview for
animation. For a series of .vtk files each single file is treated as a time
step. Is this also possible for .plt files?

 

Thanks a lot in advance,

Benedikt

Hi Utkarsh,

Here is a version of my generic reader that will build a non-time series
version and a time series version. This way you can observe the behavior.
A file is not read in the reader, but it generates sample data on its own...
just select any txt file to test. (as noted in previous emails, the
information objects are not provided properly to requestInformation and
requestData when using the time series version)...

I am hoping there is a simple thing that I am missing in the time series
XML to make this work, but am afraid that it may be a bug with ParaView...
if you can provide help, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Same status. The VTK way of modifying data is to have a filter that
copies the original, with specified parts modified/removed. In
ParaView we still don't have the nice interface to make that point by
point modification you are looking for. The extract selection filter
(by ids) and the selection inspector is the closest thing we have.

Subject: [Paraview] Retrieving Data (Client-Server)
Message-ID: <CAPyAeYoC8NfjQFsqQ-Dr5GbdT1g3c5DcnFnuDbg6y8+Wp4c+Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have created a GUI panel which I would like to populate with some
information about a given object. I can find the object through the
pqServerManagerModel without any issues. However, once I already have this
object in the form of pqDataRepresentation* or vtkSMProxy* (or some slight
variation thereof), is there a way in which I can easily retrieve basic
data on the object? For instance, I would specifically like to know the
point coordinates for this object (objects are expected to be standard vtk
data types). If possible, I do not want to attempt to "reconstruct" the
original data object locally. I have also read "GetClientSideObject()"
solutions, but these break the client-server model which is something I
would like to avoid, if possible. Is there any current way of doing this?

Regards,
Dennis McWherter

Get the vtkPVDataInformation for the object. That will give you
lightweight information about the object (the same thing shown in the
Information tab)

If you need a local copy of the object, see how servermanager.Fetch
does it in the python layer.

Message-ID: <CADHSJjDnmXKTqepraK-qEpLGjcB=8HcB60u55bWHiV-RL1=2kA@mail.gmail.com>

CALL FOR POSTERS (Deadline: August 6, 2012)
======================================

IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)

VisWeek 2012 in Seattle, Washington

October 14-15, 2012

Website: http://www.ldav.org/

We invite you to submit unpublished work to the LDAV poster program.
The poster program is a venue designed to highlight ongoing research
and late breaking topics that have produced promising preliminary
results. In addition to the topics listed below, we also welcome
submissions that showcase successful stories of applying visualization
to large-scale data intensive applications . The poster program will
be a great opportunity for the authors to interact with the symposium
attendees and solicit feedback.

All posters should be directly related to collection, analysis,
manipulation or visualization of large-scale data. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:
	-	Data collection, management and curation
	-	Novel, extreme or innovative methods for understanding and
interacting with data
	-	Streaming methods for analysis, collection and visualization
	-	Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization
	-	Collaboration or co-design of data analysis with domain scientists
	-	Distributed or Multi-threaded approaches
	-	MapReduce-based methods, algorithms or approaches
	-	Hierarchical data storage, retrieval or rendering
	-	Novel interaction techniques specific to large data
	-	Topics in cognitive issues specific to manipulating and
understanding large data
	-	Case studies
	-	Industry solutions for large data

Interested authors should submit a two-page abstract that describes
the underlying problem, the proposed method, and preliminary results.
We are working towards including the accepted poster abstracts as part
of the proceedings. The format of the abstract will be the same as the
format used for the regular paper submission. Poster authors are
encouraged, but not required, to include a draft or sketch of the
poster layout and content in their submission to help reviewers and
show that the poster format is being used effectively. This should be
in PDF format. The authors should indicate if the poster will be
accompanied by an on-site demonstration and/or videos.

Important Dates:
Poster Submission Deadline: August 6, 2012
Notification: August 21, 2012

Poster Format Requirements: http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~vis/Tasks/camera.html
Page Limit: 2 pages

To submit your poster, please go to
https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc , log in, and select 'Submit to
LDAV 2012 Posters'

Best Poster Award:
The LDAV committee will present a 'Best Poster' award to the authors
of what is deemed the strongest submission to the conference according
to the reviewing criteria. The 'Best Poster' award will be announced
at the LDAV reception.

Thank you for your suggestion; do you know if there is a method to extract
coordinate data from this abstraction? If not, it seems like I may need to
delve into the python layer code a little bit. Thank you again for your
help.

Hi Mark,

I haven't tried packaging the coprocessing library but it looks like
there's some funky stuff in the CMake files for it. Utkarsh is going to
clean some of it up for modularization so hopefully that will fix it.

I don't see any reason why if someone added their adaptors to the Adaptors
directory that it shouldn't get properly packaged with ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] visualizing vorticity
Message-ID: <CAK6Z60eks0G9c1Kd0q1-A3z8gfesROJ1kdghyG8oOdEcy0fxxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to visualize the vorticity of a given vector field using ParaView.
I've just discovered the ComputeDerivatives filter (choosing
"Vorticity" as "Output Vector Type"). I would now like to have the
result of this calculation displayed as vector field (with arrows) or,
even better, in terms of field lines. (I'm actually describing a
magnetic field here.)
When I choose the glyphs filter, I can choose the original vector
field as input, but not "Vorticity".
Any hints?

Cheers,
Nico

Subject: [Paraview] Single screen, side-by-side stereo possible?
Message-ID: <500090EB.3050909@sfu.ca>

Hello,

I have a stereo display that uses side-by-side stereo (Panasonic plasma 
TV). Ideally I would be able to say --stereo 
--stereo-type="side-by-side". This stereo mode doesn't exist (correct me 
if I am wrong).

Is there a way to do this? I can't seem to find a way of running 
pvserver with a pvx config in some sort of left-eye, right-eye mode.

I want to do something like this:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
  <Process Type="client" />
   <Process Type="server">
     <!-- IQStation at SFU -->
   <Machine Name="localhost"
            Environment="DISPLAY=:0.1"
            LowerLeft=" -1 -1 -1"
            LowerRight=" 1 -1 -1"
            UpperRight=" 1  1 -1"
            windowPos = "(0, 0), (1920, 1080)"
            leftViewportPos="(0, 0), (960, 1080)"
            rightViewportPos="(960, 0), (960, 1080)"
  />
  </Process>

Of course, I made up the windowPos, left, and right viewport parts of 
course 8-) They come from a VRUI config...

Any hints? Am I missing something obvious?

Brian

Apply "Cell Data to Point Data" or turn on auto-convert properties in
the preferences/setting to tell paraview to do that for you as needed.

Hi Brian,

This feature is not implemented as of now. We are in the process of
providing this feature at VTK / ParaView level. I cannot guarantee a
time line for this though.

Thanks,

Indeed!
The vorticity data is associated with the cells, so turning that into
point data makes it a viable target for the streamtracer/glyphs.
Thanks!

I want to perform the volume representation on pointData


Hope someone can help

Could you just run Point Data to Cell Data, then the Warp by scalar filter?

Yeah I did that. Problem is, cell_data variables are discontinuous at some
points and I fear interpolation will introduce unnecessary oscillations ...

hi, you can use the shrink filter with a shrink factor of 0.99999 to get 
disconnected nodes. the you can apply the warp filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Data directory in pvsm files
Message-ID: <CAE_bc5aqcYfRkgOhe9RznUK+JZ6qkjYm7Q2rBx8Sd56Nk1fEXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a simple question.
Is it possible to assign an environment variable to define data directory
in pvsm files?
As I save a pvsm file, I see that paraview uses the complete directory
address to add files to the pvsm file.
I was wondering if there is a way to define that?

Or, an alternative question is, is there anyway for paraview just to write
the file names (and not the corresponding full directory)?
That way, we can run the pvsm file in any directory as long as all the data
files are in the current directory where the pvsm file is stored.

Thanks,
Mohamad

in RequestUpdateExtent script. Of course, this requires that the reader or
a filter before the programmable filter is able to provide ghost levels.

Subject: [Paraview] WriteImage Arguments
Message-ID: <CAGA9z8cEgtGx5C8WOafBOsfn0o2T2T9y1Qy=kyT+_yJDW1cOaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I'm want to write the result of this code to png file and I found the
writer

WriteImage()

the thing is that in Paraview's tutorials I found the writer with two
arguments like the following


view.WriteImage("example.png","vtkPNGWriter")

but when I run that from the termianl using pvpython I got an error says
that WriteImage() takes three arguments, so I found the following in one of
the websites

view.WriteImage("example.png","vtkPNGWriter",1)

and when I did that, it worked and wrote an image that has a size of 400*400

when I changed the last argument to 2 I got an image that have the size
800*800

so what does the third argument refers to ? and why is it not working with
only two arguments ?

hope someone can help

thanks

The third argument is a magnification factor.  I guess there wasn't a
default value of 1 set for the magnification factor so you need to put that
in automatically.

You should be able to just use WriteImage(<output file name>) without using
the view object. It determines the image output type from the file
extension.

Thank you Berk.

I was under the impression that this command would trigger the reader to
automatically load in the additional # of requested ghost levels. I tested
the command and each data piece still has the same extents as before.

Is there any additional way to load in ghost level that's parallel
friendly? I am aware of the D3 filter but, from the memory usage, it seems
that it will load in the entire dataset into each processor and this is not
feasible for large datasets.

I am using binary, "raw" vti piece files each with their own extent of the
data and a header pvti file.
The data has no encoded ghost layers between pieces so I was hoping to have
paraview do that for me.

Since you have structured grids, one other possibility is using:
vtkPUniformGridGhostDataGenerator
(http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPUniformGridGhostDataGenerator.html)

Each process constructs a vtkMultiBlockDataSet instance consisting of
the grids/blocks owned by the process with NULL entries for all remote
blocks.
The resulting output of the filter is a vtkMultiBlockDataSet
consisting of the ghosted grid/block instances. Make sure that you
specify the whole-extent for the entire dataset and that for each
block you attach PIECE_EXTENT() in the corresponding vtkInformation.

Let me know if you need more help on this.

Best,
George

Subject: [Paraview] Client-Server Handshake failed
Message-ID: <CAJAZx5BSygLjyQNh_abT_LO1=eiwnWiDJk0bHiBi2MazmCz8-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to establish a connection between my workstation (Mac OS
10.7.4, Paraview via binary installer version 3.14.1 64-bit) and a remote
server. On the server side, I built an mpi-enabled paraview from scratch,
following the instructions on the wiki, but using the intel compiler
(2012.0.032) and the SGI MPI library (mpi-sgi/mpt.2.04.10789). This was no
small task, but as far as I can tell, the build was completely successful.
The server version is 3.14.1-1217-g611f58e.

The essence of the problem is a "Client/server version hash mismatch"
error, which paraview suggests is due to mismatched versions. However, my
client and server versions the same. Below is a detailed description of the
problem. I have invested a lot of time in this so far and now very
frustrated to be stuck. I sincerely appreciate any help you can offer.

Best Regards,
Ryan Abernathey



DETAILS

The server nodes are behind a front-end node, so I have to use ssh
tunneling. Following the wiki instructions (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Reverse_connection_and_port_forwarding#A_Forward_Connection_Over_an_ssh_Tunnel)
I am able to establish an ssh tunnel for a forward connection. I have
verified that the client on my local host is able to open a connection to
the server. The steps I take are:
1) Run an interactive PBS job to to get a compute node.
2) Knowing the host name of the compute node, I establish an ssh tunnel
from my workstation like this:
[LOCAL_WORKSTATION]$ ssh -v -L 11111:COMPUTE_NODE:22222 FRONT_END_HOST -N
3) Then I start the paraview server on the host
[COMPUTE_NODE]$ mpiexec pvserver --server-port=22222
4) Finally, I connect to the server from my workstation using the paraview
client GUI. The settings are Server Type: Client / Server; Host: localhost;
Port: 11111.

Since I used a verbose SSH tunnel, I can verify that the tunnel is working:
debug1: Connection to port 11111 forwarding to COMPUTE_NODE port 22222
requested.
debug1: channel 2: new [direct-tcpip]
debug1: channel 2: free: direct-tcpip: listening port 11111 for r211i0n0
port 22222, connect from 127.0.0.1 port 58973, nchannels 3
(I have to admit that I don't understand what the last line means.)

This is where the errors start. On the server side, I see:
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://COMPUTE_NODE:22222

Version "3.14.1-1217-g611f58e" incorporates latest VTK changes for
modularization. I am not surprised that has resulted in changes to
vtkSocketCommunicator files and that's what resulting in the version
mismatch. Since current changes in VTK/ParaView master are what would
go to making the next release for ParaView which won't be version
compatible with 3.14.1, at this point we should consider git-master
and 3.14.1 client-server processes are non-compatible. You may either
want to build your Mac binary using the same git version of ParaView
or build ur server binary using 3.14.1 source (tag: v3.14.1).

There is also ghost cell generator for image data that does not convert 
to multi block. It's called SQImageGhosts and resides in the 
SciberQuestToolKit pluign.

You would need to ensure the plugin is loaded and insert this filter 
upstream of your python filter.

In your filter's RequestUpdateExtent you'll need to set both 
UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS() and UPDATE_EXTENT() to reflect the 
number of ghost cells that you need. When you set UPDATE_EXTENT() to 
include ghost cells you must ensure that it is contained by WHOLE_EXTENT().

In your filter's RequestData you'll need to give PV the extent he 
initially asked for and process the input and output arrays according to 
the modified input extents and requested output extents respectively. 
The following c++ code illustrates. You'll have to build PV from source 
and turn on the plugin during the build. I would recommend pulling the 
sources from PV git repo since a number of windows and mac build issues 
were recently fixed.

this illustrates how ghost cells are requested in a filter:

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
int vtkSQKernelConvolution::RequestUpdateExtent(
       vtkInformation *req,
       vtkInformationVector **inInfos,
       vtkInformationVector *outInfos)
{
   // ...

   // We will modify the extents we request from our input so
   // that we will have a layers of ghost cells. We also pass
   // the number of ghosts through the piece based key.
   int nGhosts = this->KernelWidth/2;

   inInfo->Set(
         vtkSDDPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
         nGhosts);

   CartesianExtent outputExt;
   outInfo->Get(
         vtkSDDPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),
         outputExt.GetData());

   CartesianExtent wholeExt;
   inInfo->Get(
         vtkSDDPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
         wholeExt.GetData());

   outputExt = CartesianExtent::Grow(
         outputExt,
         wholeExt,
         nGhosts,
         this->Mode);

   inInfo->Set(
         vtkSDDPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),
         outputExt.GetData(),
         6);

   int piece
     = outInfo->Get(vtkSDDPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());

   int numPieces
     = outInfo->Get(vtkSDDPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());

   inInfo->Set(vtkSDDPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
   inInfo->Set(vtkSDDPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), numPieces);
   inInfo->Set(vtkSDDPipeline::EXACT_EXTENT(), 1);

   return 1;
}

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
int vtkSQKernelConvolution::RequestData(
     vtkInformation * /*req*/,
     vtkInformationVector **inInfoVec,
     vtkInformationVector *outInfoVec)
{

   // ...

   // Get the input and output extents.
   CartesianExtent inputExt;
   inInfo->Get(
         vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),
         inputExt.GetData());

   CartesianExtent inputDom;
   inInfo->Get(

   CartesianExtent outputExt;
   outInfo->Get(
         vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),
         outputExt.GetData());

   CartesianExtent domainExt;
   outInfo->Get(
         vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
         domainExt.GetData());

   // Check that we have the ghost cells that we need (more is OK).
   int nGhost = this->KernelWidth/2;

   CartesianExtent inputBox(inputExt);
   CartesianExtent outputBox
     = CartesianExtent::Grow(outputExt, nGhost, this->Mode);

   if (!inputBox.Contains(outputBox))
     {
     vtkErrorMacro(
<< "This filter requires ghost cells to function correctly. "
<< "The input must contain the output plus " << nGhost
<< " layers of ghosts. The input is " << inputBox
<< ", but it must be at least "
<< outputBox << ".");
     return 1;
     }

   // NOTE You can't do a shallow copy because the array dimensions are
   // different on output and input because of the ghost layers.

   vtkImageData *inImData=dynamic_cast<vtkImageData *>(inData);
   vtkImageData *outImData=dynamic_cast<vtkImageData *>(outData);

What is the class that is responsible for testing to reader to see if it can open the .wind file?

I was reluctant to enable the reader in serial (i.e. not using MPI IO which I think is getting done by default with the parallel build) because of the following warnings that I got:

Warning: In /home/acbauer/CODE/ParaView/
ParaView/VTK/IO/Parallel/vtkWindBladeReader.cxx, line 942
vtkWindBladeReader (0x3a0c800): WindBladeReader error reading file: /home/acbauer/DATA/VTKLargeData/Data/WindBladeReader/test1_topo.wind Premature EOF while reading block of data. Expected 896000 but got 0

I just assumed that it was getting bad results so I didn't check the serial output with the parallel output. In either case the code should be changed before enabling it in serial so that it reads the files correctly and doesn't produce any warning messages.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem when following instructions for parallel reader
 (Paraview Manual 3.14)
Message-ID: <CC2B0E28.1853%joshua.murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,

I am attempting to follow the instructions found in the 3.14 ParaView manual for writing parallel readers.  I am successfully reading sub extents from my data file, and am generating good visualizations in Paraview, but when I start applying filters, I start to see some problems.

I load my file, and then start constructing a view using the Extract Subset tool? so far, so good.
Once I have the view built, and have the full grid turned off (eyeball greyed out), and I start changing the variables that I am loading, I seem to loose the whole extent in the pipeline.  The last call to Data->SetExtent(extent) populates the top-level of the pipeline, preventing me from changing anything in the view, as the system doesn't think it has the full wholeExtent.

I am attaching a screen shot to show the problem.

Is there something that I need to add to my reader so that paraview doesn't loose the whole extents?

Thanks,

Actually, I think that I noticed this too. It may be a bug specific to the
programmable filter. I will check it out. By the way, what do you mean by
"raw" vti? Appended raw mode?

Thanks that might work. Just another question. What type of interpolation
does PV use to map cell data information to point data? Obviously there are
more nodes than cells ... is it using some sort of least-square method?

Yes, appended raw mode. It has an ascii header then the data itself is
binary after a specified underscore delimiter.

One more question. What are you doing after reading the data? Depending on
what you are doing, I might be able to give you a piece of code that uses
George's filter to generate ghost levels using MPI. You will need to use
ParaView built from git.

Next week, George and I will start working on updating ParaView's
structured data readers to generate ghost levels using MPI under covers. We
waited way too long to do it...

I am simply applying a (Python) Programmable Filter after loading in the
data so the data itself does not get touched or modified before the
Programmable Filter is applied. Rebuilding paraview from git won't be a
problem since I've branched a few git versions in the past. If possible,
any workaround (including the previously suggested) would be great since
I'd rather not code my own MPI ghost cell trading logic inside of my
parallel programmable filter as I'm already performing computations every
single time I run the filter. I'd imagine it would be much slower than
having the ghost data already present or generating such ghost data
beforehand.

Yes, I currently use that command to split my data for my Programmable
Filter. I ran into this "feature" last year.

Hi Sebastien,

The files were all time dependent data but some had a TimeRange but no
TimestepValues so I simply did:

TimestepValues = meshFine.TimestepValues
if len(TimestepValues) == 0:
      timerange = meshFine.GetProperty('TimeRange')
      steps = 100
      TimestepValues = [timerange[1]*i/steps + timerange[0] for i in
range(steps)]

which works well enough.  Hopefully this will help anyone else that runs
into the same issue.

Thank you again,
Justin

Hi Mohammad,


According to my research, Cell Data to Point Data is just calculating
averages of surrounding cells.

I think it's not proper to explain the function as 'interpolation'.
Also I hope it will be adapted to geometric interpolation method.

Sorry, but I meant to ask a different question.? Here's what Andy said before, which relates to my concern:
">
> I went through the code and it jogged my memory about previous problems with
> it. It had an explicit MPI call in the constructor that would cause problems
> when paraview wasn't getting built with MPI. Any time a user tried to open

What I meant was; which ParaView class "creates" or "tests" a reader to see if it can handle a file? The test code you specified has a predefined data set that is loaded in, and I think is more of an example to your average user. Correct me if I'm wrong.

So basically ParaView will recognize the file extension, tries to load it, crashes somewhere, then asks you specify the data format from a dialog.? I'm trying to figure out where it crashes so that I can see how that relates to the wind blade reader class and any MPI calls that are in there.

Each file that has an association with that file extension, made via the
XML, has its CanReadFile method called. Put a breakpoint there to determine
if ParaView even knows about that reader.

Subject: [Paraview]  How to check boundary IDs
Message-ID: <CAGJiehhNk5S1dUOX84+rjb3SZy2hv8WkhrS1L9Ra7jKVUowsKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all Paraview user,

This is Tomohisa Shimoyama from Hiroshima University, Japan.

I am just wandering whether I can check the boundary IDs or not.
I try to simulate the tsunami propagation.

I made a mesh of the western Japan by using the generated mesh model
'Terreno'.
When I see the mesh, I have to use Paraview.
For my simulation, I have to know my Surface and Boundary IDs.

Do you know how to check it?
Welcome to any comments.
Thank you for your kindness in advance.

Best Regards,

Tomohisa Shimoyama

HI Joshua,

Can you send me the source code of your reader? After I take a look at it,
maybe we can get on the phone briefly to discuss details?

Message-ID: <27E58D8E-9830-4D69-BF02-842AF7838879@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

this problem has been solved. So, thank you Kyle.

Now I have a subsequent question: Do I have to use ADD_3D_WIDGET when I instatiate my custom widget within an own pqMyObjectPanel class? When I use this CMakeMacro I had some problems with my custom widget, because the constructor of my widget is beeing invoked two times, but I create only one instance within the pqMyObjectPanel class.

Can someone give me a hint?

Thanks again.

Cheers,
Stephan

It's not possible currently, but I think we should provide some clean
solution for the next release. Mind reporting  a feature request on
the bug tracker (can't remember if there's on already)?

Remember that in the GUI "Tools->Start Trace", "do something",
"Tools->Stop Trace" is the ideal way to learn how to "do something"
from the python scripting interface.

Try:
display_pipeline = Show(pointData, view)
display_pipeline.Representation = 'Volume'

A quick comparison of the log files from each one's respective
repository make me think that the one from the wiki is newer. They
seem to have been in synch back in 2010 which was the last substantive
change ParaView's version has in it.

Thanks Utkarsh.
It would be a neat and powerful feature.
I did some research and I think you are right. There has been already
request for that feature.

Subject: [Paraview] Sorting the data from GetInputDataObject in
	ProgrammableFilter
Message-ID: <5007C3A8.1060705@uclouvain.be>

Hi all,

I use the programmable filter to do some basic computations (Axis, mean 
point etc...).
I often need to access to more than one data as input, so I use 
GetInputDataObject(0,x), x being the input number. Let's say that all 
inputs are vtkPointSource.
I don't understand how the sorting is done. If I select 4 vtkPointSource 
from the object list, I get the coordinates, but in a random order. It 
seems there is no logical sorting such as object number in the object 
list or selection order using the ctrl+click.
I'm sure there is a hidden logical sorting...
How can I get correctly sorted inputs, for example according to the 
object list?

Thanks,
Laurent.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Visualization Application ()
Message-ID: <BAY156-W13904A8914FAD0EA620F36B4D90@phx.gbl>


Hello, 

I want to animation harmonic solutions or eigenmode 
as a time-dependent simulation.

My solution is a complex vector u. The physical displacement over e.g one period is then
            
              E Field = Re(E Field)*cos(2*pi*t)-Im(E Field)*sin(2*pi*t)

To animate this I could write the real and imaginary part of u in 
two vectors, and then multiply with cosine and -sine. But then I have to
 do that for each timestep somehow and I dont know how to do that. 
Would
 it be possible to write a vector containing the timesteps and then do 
the math with the calculator?

Any help is appriciated!
Thanks,
Cong

Hi Nikhil,

I have made the appropriate transformation to my tracking data, as you
suggested. The display is now responding to the motion of the tracking
targets. However, it is not responding to the rotation of the targets. I
believe this might be happening because the tracking server is showing 2
sensors. Is there some way that I can specify which sensor is used for the
"head"?

My tracking server provides 2 sensors. "sensor 0" seems to provide just
position data from the target. "sensor 1" provides position and rotation
(quaternion) data. I can not disable sensor 0. Hence, I must find a way to
select sensor 1 in the VR plugin configuration.

Thanks,

Se?n

When running serially, vtkSMReaderFactory::CanReadFile sees that the session has a single process.? As such, on line 660 it realizes that the source proxy's process support (in this case the source is a vtkWindBladeReader proxy) is multiple processes, which causes a return of "false" from that function.? This makes ParaView think that the wind blade reader can't read a .wind file in serial.? According to Andy, the reader works find in parallel.


I assume that a fix for this is pretty trivial? It never did this before in previous versions of ParaView and I think that the wind blade reader code has remained mostly the same. Andy mentioned some details in person when he was talking with Jon but at that time I didn't know as much as I do now.? There is a mention below about enabling the filter in serial and parallel -- is this done in a xml file?


Sohail

Each file that has an association with that file extension, made via the XML, has its CanReadFile method called. Put a breakpoint there to determine if ParaView even knows about that reader.

Two issues need to be fixed.
1) that behavior in 3.14 is there because of this fix which we had to
rush in just before the 3.14 release.

Committer: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>  2012-02-08 17:12:18
Parent: e401d569f6e54c49c3497852463f6b13a01da8b6 (Update version after
3.14.0-RC1 tag.)
Child:  99fdb1aeb5997c29b43393f45a478c4b53a23109 (Merge topic
'fix_windblade_segfault')
Branches: many (31)
Follows: v3.14.0-RC1
Precedes: v3.14.0-RC2

    Fix segfault with ParaView built with MPI when opening *.vtr files.

    The problem was that vtkWindBlade reader was getting created to test
    "CanReadFile" and that would cause segfault unless MPI was initialized.

    Solved the problem by added support to vtkSMReaderFactory to respect the
    ProcessSupport flag on SourceProxy and change windblade reader XML
to say that
    it only works in parallel.

In other words, Windblade reader's Constructor should not take it upon
itself to initialize MPI.

Once that is fixed, we get to issue 2 before paraview 4.0

2) VTK's new modularization has the rule that no module can behave
differently with parallel (or most other cmake config options) turned
configured on or off. This is so because it makes it very hard to
package VTK when the libs behave differently in different situations.

Ie, we can't have any more
#ifdef VTK_USE_MPI
do something
#else
do something different
#endif
in VTK classes.

Now if we want a class to behave differently when MPI is turned on or

Well it seems like #1 and #2 can be solved by writing a new parallel wind blade reader class. I had similar experience by creating distributed versions of class that I created in other vtk directories. The normal wind blade reader would have no parallel calls, which would address #1.

What I find interesting is that in your directories, the wind blade reader is located in VTK/IO/Parallel. For the ParaView snapshot that I downloaded, as well as the 3.14 source, it's still in VTK/Parallel.? No Parallel folder in VTK/IO. Is this a recent change?


So maybe the ideal folder layout would be:

VTK/IO/WindBladeReader.*

VTK/IO/Parallel/DistributedWindBladeReader.*

I can make changes to the WindBladeReader to remove the MPI-IO calls and make a distributed wind blade reader class in case you want to add them to the repository. The one template I have for the parallel/serial split is the vtkStreamTracer and its distributed counterparts so I can use those as a guide.? If you have better recommendations please let me know.

Sohail

Subject: Re: [Paraview] ParaView thinks that it does not have a wind blade reader
 
Two issues need to be fixed.
1) that behavior in 3.14 is there because of this fix which we had to
rush in just before the 3.14 release.

Committer: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>? 2012-02-08 17:12:18
Parent: e401d569f6e54c49c3497852463f6b13a01da8b6 (Update version after
3.14.0-RC1 tag.)
Child:? 99fdb1aeb5997c29b43393f45a478c4b53a23109 (Merge topic
'fix_windblade_segfault')
Branches: many (31)
Follows: v3.14.0-RC1
Precedes: v3.14.0-RC2

? ? Fix segfault with ParaView built with MPI when opening *.vtr files.

? ? The problem was that vtkWindBlade reader was getting created to test
? ? "CanReadFile" and that would cause segfault unless MPI was initialized.

? ? Solved the problem by added support to vtkSMReaderFactory to respect the
? ? ProcessSupport flag on SourceProxy and change windblade reader XML
to say that
? ? it only works in parallel.

In other words, Windblade reader's Constructor should not take it upon
itself to initialize MPI.

Once that is fixed, we get to issue 2 before paraview 4.0

2) VTK's new modularization has the rule that no module can behave
differently with parallel (or most other cmake config options) turned
configured on or off. This is so because it makes it very hard to
package VTK when the libs behave differently in different situations.

Ie, we can't have any more
#ifdef VTK_USE_MPI
do something
#else
do something different
#endif
in VTK classes.

Now if we want a class to behave differently when MPI is turned on or
off we have to make a serial only version in a non MPI dependent
module and a subclass of that in an MPI dependent module.

Good morning,

I have just found the following bug report about a mistake in the
Q-criterion formula.
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12858
that is now closed.

However, the "1/2" factor may still be missing.
In vtkGradientFilter.cxx, in the VTK/Grahpics directory, on the line 65, t1
should be divided by 2. (Paraview 3.14.1)

Should I re-open the bug report ?

With best regards,

The problem now is that I want to visualize this data (vtkpolydata) in

I probably need to access the view window and transfer data there, but does

Message-ID: <1342795658.76047.YahooMailNeo@web160106.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview experts,

I am wondering how I can produce uniform velocity vector of the flow field using Glyph.? When I unchecked the "mask points", paraview plots vector at ALL points.? This is way too much for my case.? I would like to reduce the number of vectors.? However, if I selected the "Mask Points", then, some area has lots of vector, while some other areas have almost NO vector plotted.? I am looking for plotting the vectors in a "uniform" fashion across the whole flow domain.? I am wondering how I can achieve this.? Suggestions will be highly appreciated.

Apply resample with data set, with then input port being your data and
the source port being an appropriately sized and place wavelet. Glyph
the output of that.

Hello Utkarsh, Mohamad,

Note we have supplied a working patch at:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13092

which   includes   arbitrary   environment  variable  support in pvsm paths:

     where environment can be reference using syntax of
     %VAR_NAME%, ${VAR_NAME} and $VAR_NAME. In the latest case ($VAR_NAME), VAR_NAME must be
     from [a-zA-Z0-9_-]+ language.

so full absolute paths can be replaced with:

    <Property name="FileName" id="2875.FileName" number_of_elements="1">
        <Element  index="0" value="${MY_DATA}/interesting_result.vtk"/>

We are using it in deployed production projects.

-Ian

Thanks.

In today's git master it now sits in VTK/IO/Parallel/vtkWindbladeReader.

The serial version should go in VTK/IO/Geometry.

The MPI version should go in a new module VTK/IO/MPIParallel.
(VTK/IO/Parallel depends only on vtkSocketController now and should
not depend on vtkMPIController).

Finally when that is done we can remove the flag in paraview's xml
that prevents it from being used in serial.

Hi, David,
?
Thanks for the reply!
?
When I applied "Resample with Dataset", Paraview popped up an windows, showing available input port and the dataset I have.? It is not clear to me about what to do with the source port.? How do I size?and place wavelet?? Do I need to do this first before I apply resample with dataset?
?
Pei-Ying

Apply resample with data set, with then input port being your data and
the source port being an appropriately sized and place wavelet. Glyph
the output of that.

Welcome.

The extent parameters of the wavelet itself to choose number of
samples in x,y,z, and transform filter to move and scale it to be
co-located with the other data set.

Ideally, but you can change it afterward.

It seems that vtkFileSeriesReader does not support multiple output
ports.  Quoting Utkarsh from
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-December/023494.html

Does anyone have a good example of file-series support in a reader
other than vtkFileSeriesReader documented here

?

FYI,

I've pushed a fix for this to VTK : http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/912/
It will make it into ParaView soon.

Subject: [Paraview] visualizing a material in paraview
Message-ID: <SNT138-W444FA6D50197ECF99FAA4D1D80@phx.gbl>



Hello,

I'm new to Paraview. I have 2 questions about visualizing an atomic material from a LAMMPS simulation.

1. I got the atom coordinates in from LAMMPS into Paraview using Pizza.py. When I just import the file, I can look at it as-is using point representation. To make it look more like atoms, I can also use the glyphs filter on the input file. But! some of the points end up outside the spheres. My question is, why are there points that don't turn into spheres? How does PV decide what turns into a glyph and what doesn't?

2. What I'd like to do next is to see the pore space - i.e., everything that's in my simulation box that's outside the glyphs. Is there already a filter for that? I thought I might be able to make a box that's the same size as my simulation box and intersect it with the glyphs object, but I can't figure out how to do that.

Thank you!

1) Look at the bottom of the glyph filter's properties tab. Max number
of points and random mode says pick 5000 points at random and only
glyph those. If turning that off makes paraview slow consider the
point sprite or manta plugins.

2) Use the gaussian resampling filter to push the values onto a
regular grid and then isocontour that.

That's great! Thanks for pointing it out. I will take a look when I
get back to work on Tue and try to get something in.

This source includes 4 Quad cells and Cell-based Scalar values.
These cells' area values are different.

If you apply "Cell Data to Point Data" filter, the ID:4 point's
value is calculated as 3.75 {= (1.0 + 2.0 + 4.0 + 8.0) / 4.0}.

Dear Nikhil,

Success! I believe I have the configuration right. Now I just need to add a
wand.

By the way, I may have found a bug / feature. It seems like I have to
specify the eye separation value in mm, even though I have transformed my
tracker units to metres in the state file. Perhaps this is another mistake
in my configuration though. Please let me know if that's the case.

Thanks very much for all your help

Hi all,

my question is very basic. I have a polydata with scalars which I
calculated by MITK (Medical Insight Tool Kit).
I wasn't satisfied with the colors, so I edited the scalars by* Paraview.*
In which extension/method should I save the new poly data with the updated
scalars so I will be able to open it and visualize the updated scalars in
MITK?

I tried most of the extensions, but no one presented the updated scalars in
MITK.

Please help me ...

Hi All Users,

I edited the scalars (colors) of my poly data via Paraview.
In which format/way should I save it in order to see the surface with the
edited colors in MITK?

BR,
Hila

I just pushed a change to next. Besides the default value, I also made a
change to the source code since if the magnification was greater than 1 it
would change the view. Utkarsh, do you mind checking that the change for
this is proper?  The branch name is 13320_default_view_magnification.

Cole,

The Find Data dialog has indeed changed in 3.14 and you have enter
expressions manually. (We are planning to fix that for the next
release and bring the functionality from 3.10 back). The problem
however is that your linux box is missing "numpy". ParaView now needs
numpy for query-based FindData to work (which will be the case for
future releases too).

Just as a side note, the binaries we distribute on paraview.org are
indeed packaged with numpy included.

As far as I can tell, I have not yet guessed correctly.  To attempt to see if find data was even working, I tried a simple query directly from the Users_guide.  I used the query "GlobqalElementId == 1".  The query returns all cells in the domain, and I get the error shown in the attached text file.

Probably a newbie question, but where is the PDF3D plugin in Paraview
3.14.1? I cannot see it in either the precompiled or the compiled
executable.

Panagiotis,

PDF3D is a commercial plugin, made by a company not affiliated with
Kitware. Citing from http://www.pdf3d.com/paraview_pdf3d_plugin.php:
"The ParaView PDF3D Plugin is part of the PDF3D suite of products."
You'll need to buy it at

Subject: [Paraview] run-time error in pvserver 3.14.1 when built from source
Message-ID: <870A941C-FC4E-402E-B1F3-71F32AE6FAAD@ucar.edu>

Hi,

I've built pvserver 3.14.1 for Linux X86_64 and I'm trying to use it with a binary distro of the 3.14.1 client under Mac OS X 10.6. The server runs, and I can connect to it with the Mac client, and I can load a remote file. But whenever I hit apply the client and server immediately terminate. Same result if I simply try to render one of the built in source objects (e.g. sphere). Note, if I use a binary distro of pvserver it works fine. The only changes I've made to the build configuration from the default is to turn off Qt. 


The error logs from the client and server are below:

Turn off the point sprite plugin on your server in Cmake and rebuild.

Also, unless you explicitly wanted to do a static build, you may want
to enable BUILD_SHARED cmake flag and rebuild the server executables.

Yes you have indeed found an issue. The eye separation is usually a
constant in whatever coordinate system you have at the end. However I am
not sure if we should explicitly state this is the documentation of apply
the transformation before saving it. The eye separation value does not use
the transformation but from a users perspective would a user expect the
transformation to be applied or not. I'd like to know your thoughts on this.

ParaView doesn't have the ability to put the color mapped colors back
into the data set itself. The vtk class that could do this appears to
be vtkApplyColors. To use that from ParaView, you will have to find a
way to feed the lookup table back from a display pipeline into the
data processing pipeline.

An alternative might be to modify one of the exporters to do it. Those
already put the colors back onto the mesh when they save out the
visible scene for some external rendering platform.

If you tracker data is in meters, you should keep the eye separation
in meters too. In general I keep the eye separation to 0.06 meters (6
centimeters). Now if your object is tiny, you may feel like too much
eye separation because now the object has to be really close to your
eyes and hence larger eye separation. I would recommend that you scale
you scene (objects) appropriately (to make them of a particular size
in terms of bounds).

Hope this helps.

Hi Aashish,

Thanks for your comments. To my knowledge, there is no reason why the eye
separation must be specified in the same units as the raw tracking data.
Paraview never uses my tracking data in its raw state. The tracking data is
transformed to my chosen "world" coordinates before it is used for
graphical calculations. These "world coordinates" are the ones in which my
screen geometry is defined. I believe that the eye separation should be
defined in these "world" coordinates.

I agree that the scene should be scaled to fit the world coordinates, and
then the eye separation will fit automatically.

In practice, it doesn't matter whether Paraview requires the eye separation
to be specified in tracker units or world units because the two are related
by a fixed scale factor. Users simply need to know which units Paraview
expects. In my opinion, it's simpler if everything is defined in world
coordinates. Of course, many users use the same units as the tracker for
their world coordinates, in which case, the point is moot.

Would you agree with the above? Or have I perhaps overlooked something? I'm
not coming from a graphics background, so I may have misunderstood
something.

Se?n

Lets suppose they are not in the same units, in that case we would
have to provide an API to inform an user what these numbers mean. Also
any time we perform any calculation, we would have to check the units
first before we
compute any numbers. Now if we provide an API to set eye in mm or cm,
but internally always store it in meters (and hence everything else),
that could be worked out as well. When you are not tracked, an eye
separation of 0.06 assumes that your data is in meters but when you
are tracked they both need to be in same reference system or else it
would not be a good experience for the user.  In a VR environment, you
mostly always have a real measurement (feet, inches, or meters are
most common).

It is. If you transform your tracker data, then you would have to
adjust your eye separation as well.

Like I said ParaView has no notion of units. So  it really depends on
the user to define a system and stick with it.

 In my opinion, it's simpler if everything is defined in world

Sure.

Ian,

That's a good starting point. Here are a couple of issues with the patch:

1. SetIndicator(..) won't work in client-server mode. We need to be
smart about this in client-server mode and consolidates the tests to
avoid performance degradation for  a large number of files.
2. Duplication of ResolveEnvironmentVariables()
3. Style issues: indentation, missing {} after if (), etc.

Josh,

Pete's observation is indeed correct. FileSeriesReader does not
support multiple ports. You can very easily add support to your reader
to take in a list of files, instead of a single file and then
implement the logic for the file-series with the reader itself. All
you need is :
*  AddFileName/RemoveAllFileNames methods on the reader
* "FileNames",  "TimestepValues" properties on the reader proxy
(similar to the one on the file series reader proxy)
* RequestInformation() should then announce the number of timesteps
(look at vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx)
* RequestData() should then respect the requested time ((look at
vtkFileSeriesReader.cxx)

Hi Utkarsh,

Thank you for the help!  This indeed explains a lot. I will implement my own file series logic and let you know if I have questions/problems.


Thanks again,

Hi all,

I have this Exodus file here that contains next to a bunch of
transient field (i.e., fields that change in time) a set of attribute
data, i.e., node data that is stored only once in the file. Paraview
shows the transient data, but not the attribute data.
Any way to debug?

Hi Aashish,

In my case, my tracker data is in mm but my chosen world coordinates are in
meters, so I transformed the tracking data to meters and I expect the eye
separation to be defined in meters too.

> It is. If you transform your tracker data, then you would have to
> > adjust your eye separation as well.


Ok, but this does not work for me. I have transformed my tracking data to
meters. If I define the eye separation to be "0.065", I can not see stereo
effects. If I use "65", I see the expected stereo effects. It seems like
Paraview requires the separation to be specified in mm, even though I have
transformed my tracking data (and everything else) to meters.


> Like I said ParaView has no notion of units. So  it really depends on
> the user to define a system and stick with it.


Agreed, I am trying to do this. I have defined my world coordinates in
meters. I have transformed my tracking data to meters. Yet Paraview still
requires the eye separation to be specified in mm. Why? This seems like a
mistake to me.


> No problem. Hope my explanation makes sense. Let me know if I miss
> something.


Thanks very much for the explanation and your time. It makes perfect sense.
Unfortunately this is not the behavior I see when I run Paraview with the
VR plugin. It seems like a bug to me, but perhaps this is what the
developers intended.

You mean turn some blocks on or off?  Another option is to select some cells, and then use the extract selection filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] isolate a small piece of a big model

Hello people,

is it possible to isolate a small part of a big model?
I have a big model and I would like to have just a piece of it.

Can someone explain me how that works, please?

Thx,
Chris

Hi David,

That fixed that problem. Thanks!

On to the next one: volume rendering. I'm having two problems, actually.  When I try to volume render the example disk_out_ref.ex2 data set I get what looks like a lot of garbage in the frame buffer (see attached image). I'm only using a single node on the render cluster at the moment. If I try to volume render the iron_protien.vtk data set I get no image at all, and no error messages either. I've set the opacity map to be opaque for all, but all I see is the bounding box. Neither problem exists if I load the data set locally and perform the rendering on the client. 

thanks!

jc

The server runs, and I can connect to it with the Mac client, and I can load a remote file. But whenever I hit apply the client and server immediately terminate. Same result if I simply try to render one of the built in source objects (e.g. sphere). Note, if I use a binary distro of pvserver it works fine. The only changes I've made to the build configuration from the default is to turn off Qt.

1> Corrupt frame buffer issue:

Looks like your server side X-window resolution is smaller than the client
side window. What is the maximum X resolution on the cluster nodes?

2> No volume issue:

Are you seeing an outline? In that case, I believe what's happening is
ParaView is doing local rendering and since ParaView doesn't deliver the
full image data to the client, its simply rendering the outline. Try
forcing remote rendering by setting "Remote Render Threshold" to 0 under
Edit | Settings | Render View | Server page.

Yes, something is not quite right. We do work with our collaborator and
they have a CAVE so I could ask him to experiment with this.

Thanks Aashish, it would be good to know if I have made an error with my
configuration. It's certainly not a major issue, the workaround is trivial
to implement.

Thanks a lot for your help,

Hmm. Looks like the default window is only 640x480. So that is probably the problem. Soon as I figure out how to change the resolution I'll know for sure.

In that case, I believe what's happening is ParaView is doing local rendering and since ParaView doesn't deliver the full image data to the client, its simply rendering the outline. Try forcing remote rendering by setting "Remote Render Threshold" to 0 under Edit | Settings | Render View | Server page.

Yes, that indeed fixed the problem. Thanks for your quick response!

When I try to volume render the example disk_out_ref.ex2 data set I get what looks like a lot of garbage in the frame buffer (see attached image). I'm only using a single node on the render cluster at the moment. If I try to volume render the iron_protien.vtk data set I get no image at all, and no error messages either. I've set the opacity map to be opaque for all, but all I see is the bounding box. Neither problem exists if I load the data set locally and perform the rendering on the client.

The server runs, and I can connect to it with the Mac client, and I can load a remote file. But whenever I hit apply the client and server immediately terminate. Same result if I simply try to render one of the built in source objects (e.g. sphere). Note, if I use a binary distro of pvserver it works fine. The only changes I've made to the build configuration from the default is to turn off Qt.

Subject: [Paraview] Help Need in Streamline for CGNS file
Message-ID: <CAPStnyywN+OaDx8tKk+-S1vCT_ooORDYw_+c_BPGLw-o=K6BbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a paraview 3.14 under 64-bit Win7. I have a multi-zone cgns file
(say 10-zone or more) with about 6 million points.
The grid is curvilinear and I used calculator to do the coordinate convert,
thing are good. I use calculate the velocity vector with calculator also
and I do get the velocity vector.

(1) When I apply the stream tracer filter, I got nothing. The number of
point and cell are zero. I think the connectivity of structured grid is
explicit. I have no idea & I want to know what is the necessary input for a
stream tracer filter to get streamline?

(2) I also tried glyph filter to see what I got for the created velocity
vector. The result is wried - I only have 50K points left. All the points
stay at the outline of the curvilinear grid or the edge face. Any idea?

Thanks a lot!

 GridConnecivity error with Unstructured Grid
Message-ID: <CAPStnyyKNS9v--P7tzqEjS_E4mn_DPrTEP5t1yuU2x-UjaUHnQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have paraview 3.14 with 64-bit Win7. I have an ensight file with about 5
million points. I used GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet to calculate the
gradient, and use the gradient to calculate the Q-value for vortex
detection (the Q-criterion).

(1) The selected points does not support any evidence of vortex. Does
anyone know how the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter work?

(2) I also compute the vorticity (this option is under
GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter) but I did not find any resulted
variable in the list. I was thinking using it to do vortex detection. Can
anyone tell me where to find this variable?

(3) The result of stream trace filter is noting (cell/point number is 0) as
I think it is due to the lack of gird connectivity. I tried GridConnecivity
filter to make the connection but I failed. The vtkErrorMessage: ?Missing
pedigree node array.?, ?This filter cannot handle sub-datasets of type:
vtkUnstructuredGrid. Skipping block.?, and ?ExecuteProcess: Unknown input
ScalarType.? Can anyone tell me what does the pedigree node mean and how
can I get streamline with the unstructured grid?

Tons of thank!

Best,
Mei Chen

There is a bug in the computed Q criterion where the vorticity part was
missing a factor of 0.5. I would suggest you compute Q criterion from the
output of the gradient filter. For the gradient of unstructured data set
filter, if the compute vorticity option is selected its result gets put in
the result array name instead of the velocity gradient. There has been much
confusion on this and it will get fixed in ParaView 4.0.

The stream tracer filter doesn't rely on grid connectivity to traverse the
mesh. You may want to look at the seed source that you're using or maybe
some other parameters of the stream tracer filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Large vtr files not read - The data array in the element
	may be too short
Message-ID: <C117FCE4A4C0470C9C6D7E43B15B98D7@notebook>

Hi All,

How does one go about writing large rectilinear data files (vtr) that are
suitable for reading by ParaView?

I have been trying using VTK and found that there is a size limit(?).
Googling showed that there was a bug in 2005 that should have been fixed but
I am still getting an error when I go above a certain size (even with 3.14
64bit precompiled). I have adapted a VTK example and reproduced the problem
- below is the error message followed by the code. "size = 1000" works,
"size = 1200" produced the error message, "size = 2000" ParaView just
segfaults.

Do I have to change it to use parallel writers?

Cheers,

Paul

Hello Alan,

thx I use the select cells through button and the extract select filter now. Is there a possibility like a rubber? 
Because this button sometimes collect cells from the environment to.

Thx,
Chris

Subject: [Paraview] Help Need in Streamline for CGNS file
Message-ID: <500FB058.4050207@onera.fr>

Hello.

For streamlines on a curved surface, you should get better results using 
the SurfaceLIC plugin.

First, you have to load this plugin through the menu "Tools->Manage 
plugins": select the SurfaceLic plugin, then click on the "Load 
selected" button. You can also click on the little cross before 
SurfaceLIC and check the "AutoLoad" check box: thus, the plugin will be 
loaded each time you start Paraview.

Then, you should have a velocity Vector in your dataset. If you have 
not, build a vector from three scalar components using the Calculator 
filter.

When you have a vector data,  the "Surface LIc" item is available in the 
list of representation mode. Select it and you will get a picture that 
looks like an oil flow visualization. You can adjust some LIC parameters 
in bottom of the Display tab. You can choose another vector if you want 
because LIC uses by default  the first vector that it finds, and it may 
be the normal vector.

Richard

Thanks guys for the info. That certainly could help. Hope that will appear

Hi,

If you're using VTK master to create your VTR files you can use the
SetHeaderTypeToUInt64() method to write out these large data sets. ParaView
master will be able to read them in properly. Unfortunately though this has
been fixed since the 3.14.1 release so it won't work there. We're working
on fixing this limitation properly for the next ParaView release.

My institution runs a common operating environment where numpy is not installed and will not be installed in the near future.  A partition is allocated for software of this kind, and I have installed a version of python with numpy there.  How can I get paraview to redirect all python and numpy calls to this installation?

You can set the PYTHONHOME environment variable to indicate an alternate
python install root.  See the documentation here:

  http://docs.python.org/release/2.3.5/inst/search-path.html

Specifically, the part that says...

PYTHONHOME sets an alternate value for the prefix of the Python
installation. For example, if PYTHONHOME is set to "/www/python", the
search path will be set to ['', '/www/python/lib/python2.2/',
'/www/python/lib/python2.3/plat-linux2', ...].

Can you provide a bit more detail? Are you compiling ParaView from source?
If you are not, are you using the Kitware binaries?

And is the origin of rotation absolute in the whole scene or is regarding

 Hi all,

 Lets say I have a surface polygonal (triangular) mesh. I want to add to 
 it a point data saying 1 if the point is on the edge and 0 otherwise. Is 
 it possible to do in Paraview?

 I know I can feature the edges and I get a separate object with (fewer) 
 edge nodes and line elements connecting them. But I can't use that 
 directly in my code.

 Thanks in advance!

Subject: [Paraview] Clipping data with cube of absolute size
Message-ID: <5010F205.2000206@autistici.org>

Hi all,

do you know if there is a way to clip data with a cube of specific and 
*absolute* size?

I would like to clip some data-sets of different spatial sizes with a 
cube of a specific size.

For example I would like to clip followings data with a 10x10x10 cube:
a) delta-z = 35, delta-y = 10, delta-x = 10
b) delta-z = 100, delta-y = 10, delta-x = 10
c) delta-z = 22000, delta-y = 10, delta-x = 10

The problem is that the scale parameter of the clip-filter is *relative* 
to the spatial size of the data.

PS: I'm newbie and I excuse me in advance for the trivial question..

Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E05086A45@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I want to write a VTK xml file for a time collection. So far, I have used the following syntax, as found in this document:


<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"><Collection>
 <DataSet timestep="   0.200E+00" group="" part="0" file="./step_1.vtu"/>
 <DataSet timestep="   0.400E+00" group="" part="0" file="./step_2.vtu"/>
  </Collection></VTKFile>

This works well for binary vtu files. Now I want to use ASCII vtr files. With the syntax shown above, Paraview (3.12.0-RC2) throws me the following errors:

snip -------------------------------------------------------

snap -------------------------------------------

Opening the vtr files directly works without problems (except that ParaView doesn't seem to recognize the extension .vtr by itself, I have to manually specify "Legacy vtk" as input format).

Questions:

1.      What do I have to change in the pvd file syntax?
2.      Is there a vtk syntax reference where I can learn more about the vtk collections?

Thank you,

Matthias

Dear All!

I am trying to run the SurfaceLIC representation under pvbatch. From the python trace tool under the GUI, I could find the following output which helps me setting the LIC intensity and LICStepSize:

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
DataRepresentation1 = Show()
DataRepresentation1.Representation = 'Surface LIC'
DataRepresentation1.InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping = 0
DataRepresentation1.LICIntensity = 1.0
DataRepresentation1.LICStepSize = 0.25

Unfortunately, doing the same within a python script does not work, since I get :

AttributeError: Attribute LICIntensity does not exist.  This class does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.

The above attributes LICIntensity and LICStepSize are not available from the python shell either, even after having set the representation to 'Surface LIC'.  I get the same issue either with the Kitware binaries or those compiled by myself. Even forcing the load of the SurfaceLIC plugin with  paraview.servermanager.LoadPlugin("libSurfaceLIC.so") does not solve the issue.

I am surely missing one step. Could someone tell me which?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Cheers,

Frank Albina.

Matthias,

VTR is the file extension for XML based rectilinear grid files, see e.g.
http://markmail.org/message/kewmge6o4ygh2wpr for two example files.

If you have to manually specify "Legacy VTK" as input format, chances
are you are actually trying to load a VTK file, not VTR. If your file
looks like

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Field
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID
DIMENSIONS 3 6 3
POINTS 54 float
1.000000 0.000000 1.000000
2.000000 0.000000 1.000000
3.000000 0.000000 1.000000
....

then you have the file extension wrong as this is VTK legacy format, not
VTR. If not, you probably have found a bug.

If, however, you do indeed have legacy VTK files, there is no way to add
time information to them. Especially not with a PVD collection file,
because PVD files can not point to the legacy VTK files, they can only
point to the newer XML based vt? (vtu/vtp/vti etc) files, see
http://markmail.org/message/cbndehqm2dycezce. You need to switch to
either a XML based format to in order to be able to use a PVD collection
file or switch to a completely different file format like ExodusII,
Ensight, XDMF etc.

Dear All!

I am trying to run the SurfaceLIC representation under pvbatch. From the python trace tool under the GUI, I could find the following output which helps me setting the LIC intensity and LICStepSize:

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
DataRepresentation1 = Show()
DataRepresentation1.Representation = 'Surface LIC'
DataRepresentation1.InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping = 0
DataRepresentation1.LICIntensity = 1.0
DataRepresentation1.LICStepSize = 0.25

Unfortunately, doing the same within a python script does not work, since I get :

AttributeError: Attribute LICIntensity does not exist.  This class does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.

The above attributes LICIntensity and LICStepSize are not available from the python shell either, even after having set the representation to 'Surface LIC'.  I get the same issue either with the Kitware binaries or those compiled by myself. Even forcing the load of the SurfaceLIC plugin with  paraview.servermanager.LoadPlugin("libSurfaceLIC.so") does not solve the issue.

I am surely missing one step. Could someone tell me which?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Cheers,

Frank Albina.

Luca,

Apply three subsequent calculators that turn the coords vector by means
of the following formulas
    coords.iHat
    coords.jHat
    coords.kHat
into three additional data arrays. Then apply the Threshold filter
subsequently using the calculated x-, y- and z-coordinate data arrays to
clip your data set.

Surely, you can also clip by using the appropriate Python commands to
select a subset of cells from your data set in a Programmable Filter,
but that would be more involved.

Hi Karl,

thank you for the quick reply.
My file format seems to be vtk legacy indeed.
I have loaded the files into ParaView and saved them as vtr. Now I can use a pvd file to point to them.

Side note: The files get larger when saved in vtr format. What are the best options I can set for the vtr writer in order to have compact file size and quick access?

Thank you for your help,

Matthias

Matthias,

VTR is the file extension for XML based rectilinear grid files, see e.g.
http://markmail.org/message/kewmge6o4ygh2wpr for two example files.

If you have to manually specify "Legacy VTK" as input format, chances are you are actually trying to load a VTK file, not VTR. If your file looks like

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Field
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID
DIMENSIONS 3 6 3
POINTS 54 float
1.000000 0.000000 1.000000
2.000000 0.000000 1.000000
3.000000 0.000000 1.000000
....

then you have the file extension wrong as this is VTK legacy format, not VTR. If not, you probably have found a bug.

If, however, you do indeed have legacy VTK files, there is no way to add time information to them. Especially not with a PVD collection file, because PVD files can not point to the legacy VTK files, they can only point to the newer XML based vt? (vtu/vtp/vti etc) files, see http://markmail.org/message/cbndehqm2dycezce. You need to switch to either a XML based format to in order to be able to use a PVD collection file or switch to a completely different file format like ExodusII, Ensight, XDMF etc.

Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E05086A87@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I need to convert legacy vtk files to vtr files. The vtk files are in ASCII format and approx. 17 MB large. When I use binary or ASCII as data mode, I get a file size of approx. 28 MB. When I use appended data mode without encoding, it's 20 MB. When I use encoding with ZLib compressor (there is only this one), the shinks to approx. 800 kB! Also data access is a lot faster when I load that file in ParaView.
My questions:

1.      Why does the file grow for most of the modes I have tried?
2.       Is the ZLib  compression used in ParaView lossless, or do I lose information when I apply it?

Thanks for some explanations...

Matthias

Hi Frank,

I think you need to use the C++ API as the representation was already
wrapped based on another type of representation that was not providing
those properties

Here is an example on how to set one of your property.

DataRepresentation1.SMProxy.GetProperty('LICIntensity').SetElement(0,1.0)

Alternatively, when you load you plugin, you can try to provide your
globals as argument. That might solve the problem too.

LoadPlugin('file', True, globals() )

Hi Sebastien!

Thank you very much for the invaluable information. I had found on the internet the following PV bug: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=12360, which shows that you have to load the plugin for both server and client when running pvbatch. I had to find the hard way that loading the plugin for the server only does not work. BTW, when loading the plugin for both server and client, I get the following warning messages:

The same happens with the PV binaries downloaded from KitWare. The platform is x86_64 running under SLED10 Linux.

However, loading the plugin and using the C++ API works just fine.

Thanks again.

Cheers,

Frank.

Hi Frank,

normally loading that specific plugin on the server should be enough
as it doesn't have any custom Qt-GUI component in it.

Each double in the binary file is 8 bytes. In ascii, the size depends
on the number of characters, which can be more or less than that. On
my machine I see the same counterintuitive result, the binary is
larger.

If you have an ascii file that only have a few digits in the numbers (~7
significant digits), you are better off using single precision (float
array) which is 4 bytes.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashes when reading binary VTK file
Message-ID: <CAMtGskJhvO+BGkXXNSyJcsoF6ZpnLvCURhr1sYgq47396pHUSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Paraview crashes when reading a binary VTK file.  I am writing out that
file using the Matlab function below.  When written out in ASCII the file
is read and interpreted correctly; when written out in binary paraview just
crashes without giving any details as to where and why it crashed.  I hope
someone has an idea: after several hours of debugging I am at a loss.

% Export mesh to a VTK 1.0 file as an unstructured grid.

Hi Seb!

I found out that the following works without having the need to access the C++ API explicitly and this is what I am using now:

from paraview.simple import *

LoadPlugin("libSurfaceLIC.so",ns=globals())
[...]
view = GetRenderView()
source = GetActiveSource()
rep = Show(source,view)
rep.Representation = 'Surface LIC'
rep.SetPropertyWithName('LICIntensity',0.9)
rep.SetPropertyWithName('LICStepSize',0.5)
view.StillRender()
[...]

I discovered that the Surface LIC properties of the rep object are listed when calling print rep.ListProperties(). Their respective values can be output with rep.GetPropertyValue("<Property name>").

Cheers,

Frank.

Hi Frank,

normally loading that specific plugin on the server should be enough
as it doesn't have any custom Qt-GUI component in it.

I had found on the internet the following PV bug: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=12360, which shows that you have to load the plugin for both server and client when running pvbatch. I had to find the hard way that loading the plugin for the server only does not work. BTW, when loading the plugin for both server and client, I get the following warning messages:

Hi Karl,

thank you for the quick reply. I tried it as you described and it works 
quite nice!

Still, I am wondering if there is no way to clip an absolute size in a 
different orientation system.

For example cube-objects in ParaView can be translated and rotated. 
Clipping over the cube would therefore correspond to clipping with the 
threshold filter over a translated and rotated orientation system.

Each double in the binary file is 8 bytes. In ascii, the size depends
on the number of characters, which can be more or less than that. On
my machine I see the same counterintuitive result, the binary is
larger.

lossless.

Subject: [Paraview] Slicing Cartesian meshes
Message-ID: <E19BE6953F23EE46B3D6DBC11DE7817F2C273F4EDB@HSV-EX01.wfinet.com>


I have a Cartesian volume grid consisting of hex cells of varying size 
in VTK legacy unstructured format.  When I do a (Cartesian) slice 
through the grid, the result is displayed as a triangulated surface 
instead of the expected surface of quads.  Is that just a result of 
the slicing process or is there a way to have ParaView display that 
surface as the expected surface of quads?  Thanks!

Michael,

Yes, it is. If you want to keep the hex/quad structure, you can resort
to the Threshold filter, thresholding based on coordinate values. See
yesterday's posting http://markmail.org/message/wooi4pdb7j4h6z36 on how
to get coordinates as additional data arrays. Note, though, that with
the Threshold filter you won't be able to cut through a hex, just along
its faces. So, only if the underlying hexahedra are aligned along your
chosen slice, you get be a smooth surface.
There might be another vtk filter that is unexposed in the ParaView GUI
that actually cuts through hexahedra without resorting to triangulation
of the surface. But that I don't know.

Karl

Michael,

in the same manner if you are using ParaView/master, you can use the
crinkle option in the slice that will do exactly the same thing as
Karl was explaining but with a simpler interaction. It will basically
keep the full cells along the slice.

Or if you are not on master, you can achieve exactly the same action
as the crinkle slice by using the ExtractCellByRegion and by checking
"Extract only intersected" and "Extract intersected" checkbox in the
filter panel.

Hi Utkarsh,

I'm noticing a that custom panels derived from 
pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel don't respect the new panel_visibility 
attribute, however they still honor the property show hint. Is this 
going to change for the next release?

Also having some weird issues in custom panels derived from 
pqNamedObjectPanel where the apply button is spuriously being activated. 
For example after connecting to a filter that has multiple inputs and 
one pipeline execution when I select the object in the pipeline browser 
apply button is activated. Any idea what could be going on there?

Burlen,

Kyle can give you more details, but the theme is that
pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel and related classes are going to be
deprecated. For backwards compatibility sake, these will be around for
the next release and when a custom-panel is provided using the past
mechanisms, ParaView will indeed simply show that -- in which case the
old style hints are respected.

Subject: [Paraview] polygon division
Message-ID: <CACeyOhb1qV-vdMcJmK-0-ONh0mv=UN6jxcYieRWOqQ=fsvSytQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi paraview users,

I have 2d surface including polygons (I've used Delaunay 2d filter to
create those polygons).
Is there a way to divide a polygon into another smalls polygons (I want to
increase the number of points per a cell).
I've noticed that one polygon is considered as a cell and the cell's points
are the vertexes. How am I enlarging those vertexes?
I thought to make another small polygons from the big polygon and thus
increasing my vertexes/points.

any thought?

Thank in advance.

Hello

I'm connecting to a remote server to get the data then I'm doing some volume rendering on that data

I want to be able to view the rendered object and save that in a png file


but the problem that I do not get a clear view of the object it is too small and not in the right place 

, when I run the script on the local machine I get a good view

I attached a screen shoot of what I get when connecting to the server with the Reverse connection 



and this is my code


from paraview import simple as pvsimple
from paraview.simple import *

pvsimple.ReverseConnect('12345')
File_Name = '/............./1.700E-02.xmf'
test_xmf = pvsimple.XDMFReader( FileName= File_Name )

test_xmf.UpdatePipeline()
RenderView1 = pvsimple.GetRenderView()
CellDatatoPointData2 = pvsimple.CellDatatoPointData()
CellDatatoPointData2.UpdatePipeline()
rep = pvsimple.Show(CellDatatoPointData2,RenderView1)

rep.Representation = 'Volume'
Render()
RenderView1.WriteImage("example.png","vtkPNGWriter",4)

Hi Andy,
 
Thanks - I am just trying to get my build working with the new VTK 6 library
system and if it works I'll post the updated code.
 
Cheers,
 
Paul

Hi,

If you're using VTK master to create your VTR files you can use the
SetHeaderTypeToUInt64() method to write out these large data sets. ParaView
master will be able to read them in properly. Unfortunately though this has
been fixed since the 3.14.1 release so it won't work there. We're working on
fixing this limitation properly for the next ParaView release.

Hi All,

How does one go about writing large rectilinear data files (vtr) that are
suitable for reading by ParaView?

I have been trying using VTK and found that there is a size limit(?).
Googling showed that there was a bug in 2005 that should have been fixed but
I am still getting an error when I go above a certain size (even with 3.14
64bit precompiled). I have adapted a VTK example and reproduced the problem
- below is the error message followed by the code. "size = 1000" works,
"size = 1200" produced the error message, "size = 2000" ParaView just
segfaults.

Do I have to change it to use parallel writers?

Maybe check the endianess - to read a binary file that was generated in
MATLAB I had to change the endianess. I think there is a VTK util on the
MATHWORKS site but I haven't tried that.

Hi, 

Did you ever get the Matlab writing of the binary VTK files to work?  I'm
having problems with them too: PV crashes when reading the binary files.

Paul,

This is a good guess. I have played with this already and Paraview would
read the points okay (for big ended write), but it would crash when reading
the cell data:

?
for k=1:length(Connectivity)
        f=Connectivity{k};
        ctype=zeros(size(f, 1),1)+Cell_types{k};
        fprintf(fid,'CELLS %d %d\n',size(f,1),(size(f,1)*(size(f,2)+1)));%
        if (~binary)
            for i= 1:size(f, 1)
                fprintf(fid,'%d ',size(f,2));
                for j= 1: size(f,2)
                    fprintf(fid,'%d ',f(i,j)-1);
                end
                fprintf(fid,'\n');
            end
        else

fwrite(fid,cast([zeros(size(f,1),1)+size(f,2),f-1],'int32'),'int32','b');
        end
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
        fprintf(fid,'CELL_TYPES %d\n',size(f,1));%
        if (~binary)
            for i= 1:size(f, 1)
                fprintf(fid,'%d\n',ctype(i));
            end
        else
            fwrite(fid,cast(ctype,'int32'),'int32','b');
        end
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
    end
?

There is something wrong in the code above (or there's a bug in paraview).
 By the way my Matlab code that writes out binary *structured_grid* data
works just fine with paraview.
It is just the unstructured grid that's giving me headaches.

A follow up...
 
To build I changed the linking options to:
-lvtkCommonCore-6.0 -lvtkCommonDataModel-6.0 -lvtkIOCore-6.0 -lvtkIOXML-6.0
-lvtkRenderingCore-6.0
 
And the code to:
  //writer->SetInputConnection(grid->GetProducerPort());
  writer->SetHeaderTypeToUInt64();
  writer->SetInputData(grid);

I can now write a large vtr file using VTK6 and have ParaView
3.14.1-1300-g0596919 read the file with no errors. However as the data gets
larger ParaView is more unstable. I found that I had to start using ParaView
in parallel to prevent seg faults. 
 
So it is working thanks :)

Hi,

If you're using VTK master to create your VTR files you can use the
SetHeaderTypeToUInt64() method to write out these large data sets. ParaView
master will be able to read them in properly. Unfortunately though this has
been fixed since the 3.14.1 release so it won't work there. We're working on
fixing this limitation properly for the next ParaView release.

I am new to this part of ParaView sorry - the approach I took was to use
read the data and use VTK for writing the files - you can start with the VTK
examples and then plug in your values. There could be bugs so start small
and grow the problem size. I also found that including the rendering from
the VTK examples made things quicker as you could write/read and test in the
same code.

Paul, 

This is a good guess. I have played with this already and Paraview would
read the points okay (for big ended write), but it would crash when reading
the cell data:

.
for k=1:length(Connectivity)
        f=Connectivity{k};
        ctype=zeros(size(f, 1),1)+Cell_types{k};
        fprintf(fid,'CELLS %d %d\n',size(f,1),(size(f,1)*(size(f,2)+1)));%
        if (~binary)
            for i= 1:size(f, 1)
                fprintf(fid,'%d ',size(f,2));
                for j= 1: size(f,2)
                    fprintf(fid,'%d ',f(i,j)-1);
                end
                fprintf(fid,'\n');
            end
        else
 
fwrite(fid,cast([zeros(size(f,1),1)+size(f,2),f-1],'int32'),'int32','b');
        end
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
        fprintf(fid,'CELL_TYPES %d\n',size(f,1));%
        if (~binary)
            for i= 1:size(f, 1)
                fprintf(fid,'%d\n',ctype(i));
            end
        else
            fwrite(fid,cast(ctype,'int32'),'int32','b');
        end
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
        fprintf(fid,'\n');
    end
.

There is something wrong in the code above (or there's a bug in paraview).
By the way my Matlab code that writes out binary *structured_grid* data
works just fine with paraview.
It is just the unstructured grid that's giving me headaches.

Hi, 

Did you ever get the Matlab writing of the binary VTK files to work?  I'm
having problems with them too: PV crashes when reading the binary files.

Hi,

when viewing the distribution of, say, temperature within a geometry, I would like to see the different bodies in the geometry as outline (resp. the boundaries as surfaces) at the same time. Is this possible? Which information is required in the vtu file (which maybe isn't there - how can I check that?)? Or else is there the possibility to overlay a mesh or geometry file (.msh, .step, ...) in the view?

Thank you for a hint,

Hi,

thank you for the answer.

I don't see how I could get my geometry data to EnSight format - they are in STEP format.
I did not find the Extract Group Filter in Paraview 3.12.0-RC2.

It would be practical if I could superpose vtu grid data and geometry/mesh data...

I have just seen that I can superpose two vtk files. So it might be a solution to convert my geometry data to vtk and superpose it to the results. Is there a known workflow how to do that?

Thanks,

Matthias

Dr Zenker,

I am not sure that your data (images?) is amenable to EnSight-formatted results.

In my case, the EnSight-format's "part" construct is used to create individually displayable graphical objects for each material in the results files. The Extract Group filter will allow any combination of parts to be extracted and further processed for display. One can also apply multiple Extract Group filters to the same datum source to create 'forked' pipelines.

As an aside, ParaView will read multiple results datum-sets (written in different formats) and display them one on top of the other or side-by-side. I find this feature very useful for creating complex displays that illustrate a particular simulation result.

Hi all,

Saving the 1st state file, and loading it in a new window, doing some
operations, saving the 2nd state file, and loading it in a new window,
... after several iterations, the saved state file suddenly becomes ~10x
bigger and it then takes a long time to load the large state file.

I experienced this problem several times, but didn't know which
operation triggered the problem.

Does anyone know a way to avoid this problem, or clean up the bulky
state file?

Thank you,

Hi again,

I have succeeded to convert my geometry to stl which can be superposed to the vtk data in Paraview. This is OK so far, however it is a bit clumsy if I want to make a cut (slice) - I have to apply two slices, one for each dataset (vtk and stl). Does someone know a more elegant way to have geometry and results in the same view?

Thanks,

Matthias

Is there any way in a Paraview python script to define new orientation

I don't need them to follow the mouse interaction since i only need them

When I go to http://paraviewweb.kitware.com/PWSimple/ I see 3d content in the first two columns and blank image for Flex so I hope the issue is not with my browser. I am using Firefox 14.0.1 with java enabled. The FAQ page of Paraview web has this issue listed but none of the solutions seem to match my case.  Based on the FAQ listsed possible solutions I verified that
    1. The pw-config.properties has the working dir set. I have pw.working.directory=/var/lib/apache-tomcat-6.0.35/paraviewweb-work
   2.  Checked that activemq(5.5.1) is running (I don't see any connection errors in the log)
   3. I ran superbuild with OSMesa turned on
   4. I am able to start PWServer at command line without any error
   5. Check that I am linking with the right version of  ActiveMQ-CPP  -- The faq pointed to 3.1.x but the super build came with 3.4.1
  6.  I don't see any library not found errors in the log.

Here is how I did the install:


-          I installed ParaViewWeb using the superbuild (http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_SuperBuild).

-          I am using tomcat 6.0.35 that is running on port 8180 (I have a different tomcat instance running on 8080)

-          I am using a system level tomcat that is installed in /var/lib/ and runs as the user "tomcat", so I followed the steps in http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_with_system_tomcat_package. I realized this is required after I did the initial install. Hence I ran the ccmake of the super build a second time, this time with OSMesa on and then did a make and make install

-          I did minor changes/additions to steps in http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_with_system_tomcat_package based on the initial errors I got - 1. instead of setting additional classpath in tomcat startup script, I did it  in catalina.properties 2. Copied all the files in PARAVIEW_INSTALL/lib/ to <tomcat dir>/paraviewweb-work/classpath.

-          I am running on a Debian OS virtual machine

-          I am using apache-activemq-5.5.1. I had an existing install that was using http connector instead of tcp, so I modified it to have <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616"/> and restart activemq. Is the version 5.5.1 compatible with Paraview/ParaViewWeb? I couldn't download version 5.3.x as specified in build instructions because all download links seem broken for this version.

Any help in resolving this issue is greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I could send any additional information to debug this.

Thanks
Chandrika

Are you talking about "orientation widget" shown at the corner or are
you referring to the cube-axes? We recently push some changes to
ParaView git repo that enables arbitrarily oriented cube-axes
(provided the data provides the needed meta-data).

 It might be easier to rotate your mesh/model by inverse of the rotation 
 you want and keep the orientation axis as it is.

Subject: [Paraview] State file size (Utkarsh Ayachit)
In-Reply-To: <mailman.4648.1343670612.22910.paraview@paraview.org>
Message-ID: <CC3C33A5.1A6B%joshua.murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

I have noticed, while working on writing my own reader that Load State
does some strange things.

For example:

After loading state file:
	Paraview requests data for arrays not in use with extents
[0,-1,0,-1,0,-1] for all components in the view.
	If you select and deselect any of the data arrays for not being used,
(pressing apply in between select and deselect) the problem is resolved.

I don't know if this has any relation to the issue discussed bellow, but I
thought I would post my observations.

Subject: [Paraview] Import time steps using C++ reader
Message-ID: <CAHSaYkpju8C5rxM4nB+msCQg--cgddAujx7La6Qx4KsEk8AvPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to make a C++ reader for a point set file containing time steps.
The output of the reader is a vtkPolyData.

The file format is similar to:
x1,y1,z1,prop1,prop2,...,time

I would like to import the field "time" as time steps, in order to animate
using "snap to time steps" mode.

The code looks like:

    vtkPolyData *output =
vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

    Loop:
            time = readTime();
            coords = readCoords();

            vtkIdType id = outPoints->InsertNextPoint(coords[0], coords[1],
coords[2]);
            outCells->InsertNextCell(1);
            outCells->InsertCellPoint(id);

    output->SetPoints(outPoints);
    output->SetVerts(outCells);

Assuming time is an integer, how do I insert the time steps into the output
?

I tried to import the time as an "int property" instead of time steps and
animate using threshold, but I can't display one time step at a time
because only one slider is animated. I tried a threshold on a threshold to
animate 2 sliders but couldn't get the exact effect that "snap to time
steps" would give if I had time steps.

Thank you,

Nehme

Hi Chandrika,

you are definitely on the right mailing list.

Currently there is a known issue using the JPA dao class in the
pw-config.properties, so make sure you used the Memory class instead.

Then regarding all your software version, everything should be fine.

Could you send the content of one of your pw-out*.log ? It might help
me to understand what is happening.

Also, just to make sure, when at the second step you turn ON Mesa, did
ParaView rebuild properly ?
The superbuild is kind of experimental and I'm not sure it works well
dynamically.

Thanks,

Seb

Sebastien,
Thanks for the prompt reply. Here are the details

1. I do see the line "pw.visualization.dao=org.paraview.process.jpa.VisualizationJpaDAO" in my pw-config.properties. What should I change this to in order to use the Memory class you mention?

2. Attached are the pw-out*.log file I get after running localhost:8180/PWSimple. I have also attached the pw-config.properties just in case I didn't get some settings right

3. The build completed without any error and the error I earlier got -something related to DISPLAY=Null.. I am not able to remember the exact error message - disappeared so I assumed that ParaViewWeb is now able to detect OSMesa. Should I have run some clean command before doing a configure, make and make install ?

Thanks,
Chandrika

Hi Chandrika,

it seems that you have some rendering issue.

Warning: In /home/gs3/Downloads/ParaViewWeb/build/ParaView/src/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/vtkSMRenderViewProxy.cxx,
line 996
vtkSMRenderViewProxy (0xa152430): Disabling offscreen rendering since
empty image was detected.

Regarding the DAO option just use
org.paraview.process.jpa.VisualizationInMemoryDAO
instead of the default one that is below:
   # Possible choices: VisualizationJpaDAO / VisualizationInMemoryDAO
   pw.visualization.dao=org.paraview.process.jpa.VisualizationJpaDAO

You can check if you ParaView is properly build or not.

Launch pvpython and execute those following lines

> from paraview.simple import *
> Cone()
> Show()
> Render()
> WriteImage("/.../image.png")

Then look if the image seems to be correct.

If ParaView is not properly working, either try to reconfigure it
properly with OSMesa or simply remove the whole build tree and don't
forget the OSMesa flag before calling "make".

Seb

I definitely want to install ParaViewWeb as server that is accessible to others so that others in my team need not build their own instance. I will change all Paraview bin contents to be owned by tomcat user. I will rebuild the application and test the pvpython. I will let you know how it goes

Thanks
Chandrika

That's not good to set ParaView code to belong to root. They should belong to tomcat6 as they are going to be called by tomcat.

Anyway, I should have asked it before.

Are you installing ParaViewWeb as a server that is meant to be accessible from the outside or just to test out the application ?

If it is the later, you should simply install it under your user. It will be way easier as you won't have permission issue or mesa/server x issue.

Otherwise, it seems that your ParaView installation is not right. For some reason Try to rebuild the application as the proper user. And make sure pvpython is working.

Thanks for your replies,

I actually meant "orientation widget" at some corner. I was afraid that 
model transformation would be the easiest way. (I already have many 
script developments to switch from global to local coordinates system, 
transformation means a lot of modification to my macro).

Using cube-axes may help me, I will give it a look.

Thanks,

Luc Bordier

Matthias,

What about the following pipeline?

 Load data set
 Filters - Transform - Apply (= identity transform = create a copy)
 Filters - Extract Surface - Apply
 Filters - Feature Edges - Apply (you may need to fiddle with
                                  the parameters)
   => this should give you a reasonable geometry representation
 Select the original data set and apply any filter or select any
 representation you fancy

Hi Karl,

thank you for your answer.

I have tried what you propose.  I don't really understand what I need all those filters for - the result is pretty much the same as if I don't apply any filter to my stl geometry data. Moreover, I cannot apply a slice filter to the result of the feature edges filter, or at least it doesn't slice.

What I do at the moment is to load my vtk data, then the geometry in stl format, and either apply a slice to each of them, or only to the vtk while making the geometry transparent. This solution is OK for me.

Thank you for your help,

Matthias

Are you sure you mean outline i.e. just a cube around the data bounds,
or a wireframe? If the latter, then doesn't simply changing the
representation to "Surface with Edges" give you what you want?

To solve your two-slice issue, select both the sources and create the
"Group Datasets" filter. Now you can apply the slice to just this
filter and both dataset will be operated on.

Hi Utkarsh,

my geometry is in 3D and consists of several bodies. When I make a slice, I want to see the limits of the bodies as lines in my temperature distribution. "Surface with Edges" shows me the mesh instead.

The "Group Datasets" filter does indeed give me the possibility to apply the slice to geometry and data at the same time - problem solved! :)

Thank you,

Matthias

You might want to make your reader tell VTK about the time in the
standard way instead of encoding it as a separate point associated
array. Then the time aware filters and animation controls will know
what to do with it. To do so, make your reader announce the time steps
it can produce in the RequestInformation method and respond with data
for any particular requested time RequestData. See the
vtkTimeSourceExample in the VTK source code for hints.

I can't reproduce that. Use the + button twice on the animation view
to two tracks. For one pick the threshold filter and it's threshold
range (0) property. For the second choose it's threshold range (1)
property. Using the pv binary on my system I can animate a dynamic
threshold front with the wavelet source without any problem that way.

Subject: [Paraview] aline objects from glyph filter
Message-ID: <3F2E9004-B5E2-427B-A6E2-EB8FAF8CD66D@gmx.net>

Hello Paraview-Fans,

can I align objects from the glyph filter?
I tried several things to align them row by row. 

Is there a parameter how I can do this?

Thx,
Chris

Come to think of it, the copy filter is indeed unnecessary. The purpose
of the remaining filters, however, is to get rid of the need for
separately importing the geometry (and converting your data to STL in
the first place). With the suggested pipeline it suffices to load your
vtk data.

Subject: [Paraview] Annotation and plot of a global time variable
Message-ID: <777c7892a2ccc1928f87dc7b629234da@ices.utexas.edu>

 Hi all,

 I am importing a series of legacy VTK files (beam*.vtk) into paraview 
 and animating its deformation with time. I have a separate information 
 about pressure over time. I want to annotate its value or even better 
 show its plot with a point moving during animation. Any help about how 
 to do it?

 Thanks in advance,
 Ankush.

 I found this nice programmable filter from site 
 http://paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.#Producing_Data_with_Timesteps_.28Source.29

 # Get the two inputs
 A = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 1)
 B = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
 
 # Construct a point locator containing A's points
 locator = vtk.vtkPointLocator()
 locator.InitPointInsertion(vtk.vtkPoints(), A.GetBounds())
 for i in xrange(A.GetNumberOfPoints()):
     locator.InsertNextPoint(A.GetPoints().GetPoint(i))
 
 # Create an array to store the labels
 labels = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
 labels.SetName("common points")
 labels.SetNumberOfTuples(B.GetNumberOfPoints())
 
 # Label the points in B that are also in A
 for i in xrange(B.GetNumberOfPoints()):
     point = B.GetPoints().GetPoint(i)
     if locator.IsInsertedPoint(point) != -1:
         labels.SetValue(i, 1)
     else:
         labels.SetValue(i, 0)
 
 # Initialize the output and add the labels array
 output = self.GetOutput()
 output.ShallowCopy(B)
 output.GetPointData().AddArray(labels)

 It works for me! :D

Subject: [Paraview] Visualize a curve field
Message-ID: <CAAQ61q-XfxRyFTXLww9Ki_QU1ok0JZowQ0HORBhHahFFBTwB9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Members,

I created a sample vtk file to visualize a curve in Paraview. It reads in
without any errors but nothing comes on the viewer. Can someone point in
the right direction to fix this?
