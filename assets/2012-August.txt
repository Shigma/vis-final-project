Hi Karl,

I have to additionally load the geometry as stl since the vtk data only contain the temperature distribution as far as I see.

Thanks,

Matthias

Come to think of it, the copy filter is indeed unnecessary. The purpose of the remaining filters, however, is to get rid of the need for separately importing the geometry (and converting your data to STL in the first place). With the suggested pipeline it suffices to load your vtk data.

Hello people,

I am trying to extract the center line of a vascular model.
Does someone know if there is a function, filter,... what can achieve the center line?

It would be great if someone can help?

Thx,

Each polygon in your data file has only two points. They need 3 or
more coplanar points and must not be concave for VTK to work with
them. Also, the last polygon references point id 3, which doesn't
exist.

Thank you David. I'll look at vtkTimeSourceExample.

About the threshold animation, if you animate both threshold sliders,
you're most likely not going to see anything:
for example if the array contains the values 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...,150 and
you animate both sliders of threshold using the "sequence" mode of 100
frames. The threshold value at each frame will be 150/100, 2*150/100, ...,
150.
So the threshold value at each frame won't match any value on the cells or
points a not much will be displayed.
A range of threshold should be animated at each frame, instead of discrete
values.
I was able to get something like that by using an "exponentional"
interpolation on threshold range 0 and a "rample" on threshold range 1. The
second slider was slightly ahead for the first and a small range of values
was displayed at each frame.

In ParaView 3.8, you could call:
view = GetActiveView()
view.UseImmediateMode = 1

Unfortunately I don't see that in 3.10 and 3.12 and I'm not sure what
the modern equivalent is.

Message-ID: <4776EFC6-4C43-4C8A-9326-583155B4D381@videotron.ca>

Hi,

I've been trying to build Paraview 3.14.1 from sources with options BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON, PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON
and PARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON. I have a working version of openmpi-1.6 compiled on my machine. However, it seems that the mpi/python module
fails to launch during the process:

Note that I've been able to build Paraview without any problem with the parallel option disable.

Any idea ?

Thanks !

Subject: [Paraview] Running ParaView on the back end of the cluster
Message-ID: <e9428ba8fd918daf08f4c6847af57db0@ichec.ie>

Hi all,

I have built paraview from source and run it in a small Gemini cluster 
with 2 nodes. Each node has 32 AMD CPUs and 2 NVIDIA Tesla M2090 GPGPUs.
I'm trying to run the pvserver on the back end with the script file:

# Set the shell - bash shell
#!/bin/bash

# job name (default is name of pbs script file)
#PBS -N Server_Script

# Tell pbs to use XX nodes and YY processors per node
# Note: Cluster uses nodes=XX:ppn=YY but shared memory
# machine uses ncpus=XX to specify resources
#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=32:gpus=4

#PBS -j oe

# resource limits: amount of memory and CPU time ([[h:]m:]s).
#PBS -l walltime=00:30:00

#PBS -o pview.out
#PBS -e pview.err
#PBS -V


cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

module load openmpi-intel/1.4.4
module load intel-cc

mpiexec ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering --server-port=11111


I can submit it but it can't run. Any suggestion?

Cheers,
Georgia

Greetings Dave,

This is a request for a minor(?) alter in a VTK rendering algorithm.

Polyhedral finite elements are reaching a level of numerical maturity 
where their use is likely to become widespread  -- and correspondingly 
an increased desire to display them in ParaView. For convex polygonal 
faces of a polyhedron, the VTK algorithms work fine, and omitting the 
interior triangle edges was a nice rendering improvement.

However, the discrete numerical algorithms that have emerged 
surprisingly work for polyhedrons that have the "star property." Long 
story told short, the attached ParaView figure in the right hand panel 
contains a polyhedral finite element that has a non-planar, concave 
polygonal face. Numerically, this polyhedral configuration works very well.

Would it be possible for rendering purposes, to create the polygon's 
triangular sub-facets by starting with the polygon's vertex closest to 
the average coordinate of the polygon's vertex nodal points? Maybe this 
particular polygon vertex becomes a "common" vertex for all of the 
sub-triangles?

Hello,

I am trying to develop a compiled paraview filter that takes an input 
plane/direction vector (like the clip or slice filters). Does anyone 
know of example code that shows how to incorporate the ImplicitPlane 
widget into the server manager xml. In particular, I want a way to get 
the Camera Normal. Is this possible?

Thanks,

Put the request on the bug tracker please.

It comes up often on the mailing list. It's not been fixed before
because we don't want to slow down the common case of rendering convex
polygons to find and fix the uncommon case of rendering concave ones.
My recollection from discussions on the mailing list is that a general
solution (apply filter x,y,z to tesselate) turns out to be harder than
it appears at first.

Hallo people,

does someone know how to delete parts of the model with the point through option?

I tried to isolate cells with Select cells through and an ExtractSelection filter, but it only worked roughly.
Therefore the new model model has to be modified.

Thx,
Chris

Try the "Invert Selection" check box in selection inspector. Select the
cells you want to delete, use "Invert selection" to select the cells you
want to keep and then use Extract Selection filter to delete the cells.

Subject: [Paraview] How to fill / cap tubular objects?

Hi Chris,

If you generated them with the vtkTubeFilter you can set CappingOn.  
The documentation is in: http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkTubeFilter.html 
.

You might be able to call this filter in a python script somehow.

Hi Alex,

I don't fully understand what you mean but in ParaView the way clip or
slice are doing is by using some subproxy that define the plane. I've
just paste you both clip and slice proxy definition for convenience.

Hum... To build ParaView, you just need Python, no gui needed. But as
you won't have any X server running as well you will need to configure
ParaVIew to use the OSMesa library that you may have compile on your
own somewhere.

This is what is set for ParaView in the super build.

ccmake ../src

  BUILD_TYPE                                            Release
  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                               ON
  PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI                      OFF
  PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON                 ON
  PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON_FILTERS  OFF
  VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA                   ON
  OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR                            /.../OSMesa/install/include/
  OSMESA_LIBRARY
/.../OSMesa/install/lib/libOSMesa.so
  VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN                            ON
  VTK_USE_X                                              OFF
  OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR
  OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY
  OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY
  OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR

That's it. Then ParaViewWeb will request the build directory of ParaView

I deleted the build and install directory and ran a ccmake, make and make install. This time when I configured I set OSMesa to ON and gave the install prefix as /usr/local/ParaViewWeb. After the make install, I ran pvpython from command line and I still get permission denied error.

Sebastien,

I tried reinstalling Paraview web this time with OSMesa ON and I am still not able to run pvpython on command prompt :(  Sorry it took me while because I ran out of disk space on my small VM and had to reconfigure/resize my VM partitions to do a clean build.  I deleted the build and install directory and ran a ccmake, make and make install. This time when I configured I set OSMesa to ON and gave the install prefix as /usr/local/ParaViewWeb. After the make install, I ran pvpython from command line and I still get permission denied error. 

root at gs3-debian6:/usr/local/ParaViewWeb/ParaView# ./bin/pvpython 
Error running "/usr/local/ParaViewWeb/ParaView/lib/paraview-3.14/pvpython": Permission denied

Should I be using a different build for ParaView instead of relying on the super build of paraviewweb? If so with what configurations should I build paraview so that paraviewweb would use it correctly. 

Thanks
Chandrika

I definitely want to install ParaViewWeb as server that is accessible to others so that others in my team need not build their own instance. I will change all Paraview bin contents to be owned by tomcat user. I will rebuild the application and test the pvpython. I will let you know how it goes

Thanks

That's not good to set ParaView code to belong to root. They should belong to tomcat6 as they are going to be called by tomcat.

Anyway, I should have asked it before.

Are you installing ParaViewWeb as a server that is meant to be accessible from the outside or just to test out the application ?

If it is the later, you should simply install it under your user. It will be way easier as you won't have permission issue or mesa/server x issue.

Otherwise, it seems that your ParaView installation is not right. For some reason Try to rebuild the application as the proper user. And make sure pvpython is working.

Seb

I can see the 3d content now. There was a typo in the path to PWServer. I fixed that and restarted both apache and tomcat and now I can see 3d image in PWSimple - at under the java and java script column. I see a blue image under Flex.
I still can't run pvpython on command line. Though does this mean some other paraviewweb example application is going to fail?

Thanks
Chandrika

Sebastien,

I tried reinstalling Paraview web this time with OSMesa ON and I am still not able to run pvpython on command prompt :(  Sorry it took me while because I ran out of disk space on my small VM and had to reconfigure/resize my VM partitions to do a clean build.  I deleted the build and install directory and ran a ccmake, make and make install. This time when I configured I set OSMesa to ON and gave the install prefix as /usr/local/ParaViewWeb. After the make install, I ran pvpython from command line and I still get permission denied error.

root at gs3-debian6:/usr/local/ParaViewWeb/ParaView# ./bin/pvpython Error running "/usr/local/ParaViewWeb/ParaView/lib/paraview-3.14/pvpython": Permission denied

Should I be using a different build for ParaView instead of relying on the super build of paraviewweb? If so with what configurations should I build paraview so that paraviewweb would use it correctly.

Thanks
Chandrika

I definitely want to install ParaViewWeb as server that is accessible to others so that others in my team need not build their own instance. I will change all Paraview bin contents to be owned by tomcat user. I will rebuild the application and test the pvpython. I will let you know how it goes

Thanks

That's not good to set ParaView code to belong to root. They should belong to tomcat6 as they are going to be called by tomcat.

Anyway, I should have asked it before.

Are you installing ParaViewWeb as a server that is meant to be accessible from the outside or just to test out the application ?

If it is the later, you should simply install it under your user. It will be way easier as you won't have permission issue or mesa/server x issue.

Otherwise, it seems that your ParaView installation is not right. For some reason Try to rebuild the application as the proper user. And make sure pvpython is working.

Seb

Hi folk,

my generated object seems to be to small for rapid prototyping. Therefore I would like to magnify it.?
At the moment it looks like dust cloud.

How could I do this?

Best regards,

Hi all,

I'm running paraview on a cluster but i have problems with the X 
displays. I use the command:

mpiexec -n 12 ./pvserver -display localhost:0 --use-offscreen-rendering

but when I connect the client i get the message:

Display is not accessible on the server side.
Remote rendering will be disabled

Any ideas how to get past this problems?

I've already seen that and working with the system administrator but 
still not working. The cluster uses xgm which should be the same.

Hi,

I just downloaded Paraview 3.14 and run it. Are there no dependencies on other libs to be expected when working later more with it?

Thanks, Torsten

The kitware binaries are self contained other than GL and X and system
level libraries.

If you build from source (for example to get a different MPI) you may
have to think about dependencies. Even there the source code includes
the source of the user level libraries it needs for the most part.

> In particular, I want a way to get the Camera Normal.
You could get the camera normal inside a custom panel on the client side 
and communicate it to your filter on the server side via the usual sm 
mechanisms. I have written a custom panel for an improved plane source 
in which I wanted to set the camera to look down the normal of a plane. 
Toward the end of that function is some code that sets the camera up 
based on the plane normal. Hope this will give you some ideas.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void pqSQPlaneSource::SnapViewToNormal()

   #if defined pqSQPlaneSourceDEBUG
   cerr << ":::::pqSQPlaneSource::SnapViewToNormal" << endl;

   this->GetOrigin(o);

   double p1[3];
   this->GetPoint1(p1);

   double p2[3];
   this->GetPoint2(p2);

   // compute the plane's center, this will become the camera focal point.
   double a[3];
   a[0]=o[0]+0.5*(p1[0]-o[0]);
   a[1]=o[1]+0.5*(p1[1]-o[1]);
   a[2]=o[2]+0.5*(p1[2]-o[2]);

   double b[3];
   b[0]=o[0]+0.5*(p2[0]-o[0]);
   b[1]=o[1]+0.5*(p2[1]-o[1]);
   b[2]=o[2]+0.5*(p2[2]-o[2]);

   double cen[3];
   cen[0]=a[0]+b[0]-o[0];
   cen[1]=a[1]+b[1]-o[1];
   cen[2]=a[2]+b[2]-o[2];

   // compute the camera center, 2 plane diagonals along its normal from
   // its center.
   double diag
     = sqrt(this->Dims[0]*this->Dims[0]+this->Dims[1]*this->Dims[1]);

   double l_pos[3];

   l_pos[1]=cen[1]+this->N[1]*2.0*diag;
   l_pos[2]=cen[2]+this->N[2]*2.0*diag;

   // compute the camera up from one of the planes axis.
   double up[3];
   if (this->Form->viewUp1->isChecked())
     {
     up[0]=p1[0]-o[0];
     up[1]=p1[1]-o[1];
     up[2]=p1[2]-o[2];
     }

   if (!l_view)
     {
     sqErrorMacro(qDebug(),"Failed to get the current view.");
     return;
     }

   vtkSMRenderViewProxy *l_proxy=l_view->getRenderViewProxy();

   vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty *prop;

   
prop=dynamic_cast<vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty*>(l_proxy->GetProperty("CameraPosition"));
   prop->SetElements(l_pos);

Hello folks,

is there an option to create a slice from empty 3D model?
My generated models have the shapes of a quarter or ring.?
The shapes look like a line construction, because of the empty structures.

Any help would be great.

Best regards,

 for pvti data
Message-ID: <1B23859C79EEB74F8A8BED8F11C3A6633A882DC8@CH1PRD0102MB121.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hello experts,

I am trying to generate streamlines using the streamtracer filter which I am calling from within a programmable filter. My input data is in .pvti format and I am running in a multiprocessor environment [16 processors]. I was requesting data to be split up among the processors using the request information script. And then trying to generate a streamline at a given point.

Although my original goal was to iterate over the whole data set and draw small streamlines at each point, right now I am not able to generate even a small streamline at a given point. It always returns 0 length streamlines. Although I am able to do it in a single core machine without parallelism.

And when I use streamtracer filter outside the programmable filter, it works fine and returns the streamline of non-zero length.

Can anyone point me towards the solution to this problem?

My sample code is attached below:
###################################

import paraview.vtk as vtk


input = self.GetInput()


posX=437

posY=372

posZ=20.5


streamTracer = vtk.vtkStreamTracer()

streamTracer.SetInput(input)

streamTracer.SetStartPosition(posX,posY,posZ)

streamTracer.SetMaximumPropagation(2000)

streamTracer.SetInitialIntegrationStep(0.5)

streamTracer.SetIntegrationDirection(0)

streamTracer.SetIntegratorType(0)

streamTracer.SetMaximumNumberOfSteps(2000)

streamTracer.SetTerminalSpeed(1e-12)

streamTracer.Update()


streamLines = streamTracer.GetOutput()

print(streamLines.GetNumberOfPoints())

Hi Sebastien,

Thank you very much for the advice. I was able to incorporate the 
implicit_function plane property using this xml as a guide.

Subject: [Paraview] how to change paraviewweb configuration to use different
 activemq port
Message-ID: <890F625002FC3E40ADDB42FB80BB3F14018F074F1734@EMAIL04.pnl.gov>

Hi,

I have an existing activemq install that is already using the default port 61616 over http for another application. I think I can enable tcp at a different port and restart activemq, but how can I configure ParaViewWeb to use this new port. Is there a common configuration file where I can change the default port for activemq communication or does it have to be set by individual web applications?

Thanks
Chandrika

Hi Chandrika,

if you don't mind you can simply use your existing ActiveMQ instance.
Otherwise in the pw-config.properties that should be in the classpath
of your tomcat, you have an URL to ActiveMQ server, you can simply
change the port here.

But, you will need also to let the C++ know how to contact that JMS
broker and therefore you can create a run.sh script that launch
PWServer with all the argument that it get but adding an extra one to
provide the port information and even the host if you want.

Then again in the pw-config.properties you will point to your script
instead of the PWServer executable.

The script should look like that:

/..../PWServer --jms-host=localhost --jms-port=2345345 $@

Hope I properly remembered those arguments, otherwise just run
PWServer with --help or some random argument, it will list you the
arguments names.

Seb

Hello ParaView users,

is it possible to do a texture transfer from one to another one same sized model?
I made a model with cull front face. Now I would like to transfer the texture (inner and outer model) from the generated model to the outer model without cull front face. 

I think it could work for one direction, but how? 
Could someone help, please?

Thanks for any help,
Chris

Look under Filters -> Alphabetical -> Tube. That ParaView filter
exposes the vtkTubeFilter class already, so there is no need to use
the Programmable filter. Capping is on by default.

If you haven't done so already, it may be helpful for you to work
through the excellent ParaView tutorial from Ken Moreland:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial

It is for ParaView 3.12 but is mostly applicable to 3.14 as well.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Message-ID: <B9A9B206-C977-4808-9657-DD5D6D7EFF3B@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to generate stream tracers on huge CFD data.
To reduce source points, I've been appending coarse
vtkStructuredGrid data files, and generate them by
Stream Tracer with Custom Source filter.

Now I'm trying to generate the source points on ParaView.
Quadratic Structured Grid data can be generated with
Plane sources, but Hexahedral ones couldn't.
So I'm going to do them with Programmable Source filter.

I found vtkPolyData samples on the web, but couldn't find
vtkStructuredGrid ones.
Does anyone have vtkStructuredGrid samples of
Programmable Source?

Hi Cory and Steve,

I am wondering if the tube filter can do capping? In the appendix (link + screenshot) I showed/added data for this tube.
First I tried to split the vascular tubes to get a single branch of 2 to 3 tubes, but the tube filter was not working after splitting, because it is no polygonal mesh any more.

So I tried it by adjusting the parameter, but it still is not working.

Here is a link for download data and a screenshot:
http://www.bestaltmed.at/slicer/Bildschirmfoto.zip

http://www.bestaltmed.at/slicer/Evmnr4_0.vtk.zip


It would be great if someone can help or explain me how it would work?

Many thx,
Chris
PS: I would need it for my thesis to construct stable 3D models with rapid prototyping.

Chris,

The Tube filter is meant to work on poly line input. It's not clear to
me from your emails, but it looks like you are trying to apply it to
this vasculature, which is polygonal data. When I do that in ParaView,
I get an empty output, most likely because there are no lines in the
vasculature object.

What part of the vasculature are you trying to cap? I see that there
are four open ends that all seem to be coplanar with the boundary of
the data (see yellow rings in the attached image). Is this what you
are trying to cap? If so, see the ParaView 3.14.1 state file at
http://www.cs.unc.edu/~cquammen/EndCapping.pvsm on how to identify
these openings, separate them into individual openings, create
polygonal meshes for them using the Delaunay 2D filter, then merging
the meshes for the openings with the original geometry using the
AppendGeometry and Clean filter. The state file only does this for two
of the four openings. You can modify it to take care of the other two.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi to all,i'm a new user of paraview. Primarily  i started to use paraview as compiled software by downloading the binary for Linux platform.Then i read the presence of one GEO version (ParaViewGEO) to read and view some geographical dataset, so i downloadedboth the source and the binary of paraviewgeo from,https://sites.google.com/a/objectivity.ca/paraviewgeo/but in all two cases i have a problem with the plugin reader.The binary one has not by default the reader and writer plugin, so i had to download th plugin source code to compile it,but i recevied an error reguarding "library destination" such as:

 CMake Error at Filters/CMakeLists.txt:197 (INSTALL):   install TARGETS given no LIBRARY DESTINATION for shared library target   "PVGFiltersGUIPlugin".
Which library i have to link?
On the other hand also by compiling the paraviewgeo source code i had some problems:for example after ccmake ..CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindMPI.cmake:81 (include):   File /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindMPI.cmake includes   /home/eugenio/dev/ParaViewGeo/CMake/GetPrerequisites.cmake (found via   CMAKE_MODULE_PATH) which shadows   /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/GetPrerequisites.cmake.  This may cause errors   later on .
   Policy CMP0017 is not set: Prefer files from the CMake module directory   when including from there.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0017" for policy   details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this   warning. Call Stack (most recent call first):   Plugins/SQToolkit/MPICHConfig.cmake:7 (include)   Plugins/SQToolkit/CMakeLists.txt:36 (include) This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
and then at the compiling time:[ 96%] Building CXX object Plugins/SQToolkit/CMakeFiles/SQToolkit.dir/vtkSQKernelConvolution.cxx.oIn file included from /home/eugenio/dev/ParaViewGeo/Plugins/SQToolkit/eigen-2.0.12/include/eigen2/Eigen/Core:96:0,                 from /home/eugenio/dev/ParaViewGeo/Plugins/SQToolkit/Numerics.hxx:23,                 from /home/eugenio/dev/ParaViewGeo/Plugins/SQToolkit/vtkSQKernelConvolution.cxx:33:/home/eugenio/dev/ParaViewGeo/Plugins/SQToolkit/eigen-2.0.12/include/eigen2/Eigen/src/Core/util/Memory.h:343:13: error: ?ptrdiff_t? does not name a typemake[2]: *** [Plugins/SQToolkit/CMakeFiles/SQToolkit.dir/vtkSQKernelConvolution.cxx.o] Error 1make[1]: *** [Plugins/SQToolkit/CMakeFiles/SQToolkit.dir/all] Error 2make: *** [all] Error 2
Could someone give me some hints?

Hi Hal. I'm trying to use this filter that you attached but I get errors. This is what I'm doing and I'm not sure what is wrong:
1) Take the GradientOfUnstructuredData in the Paraview filters which gives me the velocity tensor with components numbered from 0 to 8.
2) I modified your tensor components matrix to have
tensor_components = [
        'G_0', 'G_1', 'G_2',
        'G_3', 'G_4', 'G_5',
        'G_6', 'G_7', 'G_8']
where G is the result array name obtained from the Gradient Filter.
3) I run the your eig filter but I get errors:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 26, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 12, in RequestData
IndexError: 0-d arrays can only use a single () or a list of newaxes (and a single ...) as an index

And then I've tried any combination of with or without quotes in the tensor components or renaming my variables using the calculator.
So I'm pretty much have trouble in the area of loading the data from the Paraview variables to the numpy array.

I needed to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors from a tensor recently and
wrote a macro to do it.  I'll attach it.

Dear All,

I recently started working with paraview (version 3.12.0). As part of my

paraview dosen't recognize the time variable in my file. I found this 
thread with a similar problem:

The order of the axis in my file is as described there (e.g. float 
U(Time=12, bottom_top=49, south_north=249, west_east_stag=250)), also 
the description of the time variable is in the right way (units = "secs 
since 1970-01-01 00:00:00").

If I try to apply the variable U, I get the following output messages:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\source\VTK\IO\vtkNetCDFReader.cxx, line 672

vtkNetCDFCFReader (000000000B17B7C0): More than 3 dims without time not 
supported in variable U

If I apply the variable LU_INDEX for example (time, y, x), the 
time-information is interpreted as z-information.

How can I tell paraview that there is a time-information in? Do I have 
to change the structure of my file?

At the bottom of this mail I attached the info about the nc-file.

Thank you for your help,
Carolin.

My input was six separate one-component scalar arrays.  If you have a 
nine-component array, we can deal with that slightly differently:


input_array = numpy.array(pd['G'])
N = input_array.shape[0]
assert (input_array.shape[1] == 9)
Tensors = input_array.reshape((N,3,3))
eigenvalues  = numpy.empty((N,3), dtype=numpy.float32)
eigenvectors = numpy.empty((N,3,3), dtype=numpy.float32)
for i in xrange(N):
	eigenvalues[i,:], eigenvectors[i,:,:] = ( numpy.linalg.eig(Tensors[i,:,:]))
for i in xrange(3):
	pd.AddArray(
		paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter.numpyTovtkDataArray(
			eigenvalues[:,i],
			name=('EigVal_%d' % (i+1))))
	pd.AddArray(
		paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter.numpyTovtkDataArray(
			eigenvectors[:,:,i],
			name=('EigVec_%d' % (i+1))))

Dear All,

  I tried this. It worked all right when I had the QT interface built. But
now I want to use Paraview in the off screen mode with pvbatch. I've
attached a part of the error log. I've read through this

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

<http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D>I'm using option 2 - i.e
offscreen mesa only. So I made sure

 OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY = <empty>  -- *ENSURE THAT THIS IS EMPTY*.


The interesting part is that if I delete that line in my paraview compile
script, the compilation goes through. Any ideas?

ganesh

Hi Andras,

is there already a implicit modeller or do I have to add it to ParaView?
How can I do that?


Thx,
Chris

Subject: [Paraview] running pvserver under IBM's POE MPI implementation
Message-ID: <AF4D31F7-31D8-4687-A997-5D485FC6CF01@ucar.edu>

Does anyone have pvserver running under IBM's native Parallel Operating Environment (POE) implementation of MPI? I'm getting the following error message:

[clyne at booboo1 bin]$ poe ./pvserver 
ERROR: 0031-161  EOF on socket connection with node booboo1

However,

[clyne at booboo1 bin]$ poe hostname
booboo1

works just fine.

I'm running under RHEL6 with IBM Parallel Environment 1206. Any pointers would be appreciated. Thanks!

Hi Ganesh,

your error log indicates that x11 support is being referred to but not 
provided, you don't need X11 for the pvserver with OS Mesa. I'm 
wondering if you had attempted to modify the cmake cache for an existing 
build? perhaps starting over fresh would help? by the way the script 
below was used to build paraview server version 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14 on 
an sgi uv 1000 with osmesa 7.5.1. I would expect it would make a good 
starting point for building the server with osmesa your system.

Paraview and click "Apply", I get the following error.  I'd appreciate

It sounds like there is a data field called "Derived Volume" defined on 
cells that does not have values. What data format are you using? Can you 
manually remove that field from the data file(s)?

The Derived Volume field is a computed field. To stop this error un-check
the Compute Derived Variables checkbox.

filter after the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter. My question is how
to get these Gradients_0, ..., Gradients_8 in Python Shell or Programmable
Filter? I would like to do some data process with them.

I tried to get by this way:
reader = GetActiveSource()
gradientsAll = reader.PointData.GetArray(1) # suppose the Gradients is the
second variables in the data list
gradientsAll.GetRange(0) # I can see the range of the 9 gradient scalars
but I cannot access the data

I want to create a Jacobi matrix of these 9 gradients to calculate other
support matrix and the eigenvalues (for example, to get the Lambda2
criterion). I also need the number of points. I check the proxy but have no
idea which function can be used.
Any suggestion or example of codes will be very appreciated!


Thanks,
Mei Chen

Subject: [Paraview] New EdgeBundling class
Message-ID: <40073E8C-E66D-40EC-ADE1-574775A0C14B@uq.edu.au>

We have a researcher and student who would like to use the new VTK  
class mentioned at:
     http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/337
from paraview.

I saw in the paraview git code that a version of VTK is pulled in  
which seems to contain the necessary  vtkBoostDividedEdgeBundling  
class files. Having built this git version of paraview, it looks like  
there's been no incorporation of those particular VTK files - there's  
nothing obvious in the paraview gui and I've searched for likely  
strings in all the newly built paraview libraries.

If that is correct (vtkBoostDividedEdgeBundling not yet incorporated  
into paraview), could I ask whether there is any plan to expose this  
class in paraview in the nearish future?

Hi all,

I switched from Paraview 3.12.0 to 3.14.1 Linux 64-bit and have the following error:


Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 6, in <module>

TypeError: 'GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet' object is not callable


when I try to take the gradients of the velocity by calling: GradientsOfUnstructuredDatSet(). This worked in 3.12.0, did something change? Is there a quick fix for this? Please let me know. I would go back to the old version except that the numpy eig functions return 0+0i for any matrix I throw at it (so another bug which I assume won't be fixed since its an older version).

Best,

Sorry, in the e-mail I misspelled it. I do use:

GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet()

as the error indicates; it is not related to the spelling. After I sent out the first e-mail I tried Paraview 3.14.0 Linux 64-bit and it works, so for what I need this is fine. I think it is a bug that needs to be fixed in 3.14.1, if it hasn't already been fixed in the developers version.

There?s a spelling discrepancy between the two: missing ?A? in data, and extra ?S? after gradient. Could that be the issue?

In general to access the real data, use the python programmable
filter, which executes on the server where the data exists, to access
the data array contents. See the wiki for examples.

If the data is small, use servermanager.Fetch in the python shell to
copy the data from the server to the client. From there you have
direct access the arrays.

For example, with the wavelet source:
>>> proxy_toa_filter = GetActiveSource()
>>> its_data = servermanager.Fetch(proxy_toa_filter)
>>> its_data.GetPointData().GetArray('RTData').GetValue(0)
60.763465881347656
>>> its_data.GetPointData().GetArray('RTData').GetValue(1)
85.877952575683594

See http://markmail.org/thread/cs2uogvlpz7gaewx for a discussion of
the lack of infovis capabilities and ParaView.

The short story is that no, there are no plans, but Sandia is working
on a project called OpenView which most likely will have this and
other new infovis views in it.

Hi,

I have modified the git-next version of the CTH reader to be smarter when
trying to compute derived variables. If no materials exist it will not
generate a derived density property.

Thanks Burlen. It turned out that VTK_USE_X was still ON. It worked fine
otherwise. I'm now able to execute a script file with pvpython offscreen.

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch vs. pvpython
Message-ID: <CAFtK+eunpK43zwFU9GK-Tu4nSJRABPsc6cT--woww15_=p-Wxg@mail.gmail.com>

hi!

  I recently installed paraview 3.12 with offscreen mesa on a SGI cluster
with intel compilers and SGI MPT. Using the same version of paraview on my
local computer I recorded a script in the qt version using python trace. I
was able to execute the same script just fine on the cluster on a similar
but larger case using pvpython. However I'm unable to use pvbatch. First
off the cluster forces me to use mpirun to run pvbatch, saying that all MPI
applications must be launched with mpirun. Even when I do this

mpirun -np 1 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering saveImage.py
MPI: MPI_COMM_WORLD rank 0 has terminated without calling MPI_Finalize()
MPI: aborting job
MPI: Received signal 9


a termination is all I get. Is something wrong the way I'm using pvbatch?
I'll be working on datasets that are over 20 million cells. I hope to use
multiple processors if that will help me speed up visualization. Please
note that I'm not using a server. I just intend to submit the visualization
as a job on the same cluster where I run the simulation.

Subject: [Paraview] running pvserver under IBM's POE MPI implementation

John,

I have been having difficulty finding anyone who knows much about POE
here. But looking at the error, it looks like pvserver is failing to
opening up a server-socket  to which the paraview clients are expected
to connect and this is independent of MPI. Try using pvbatch/pvpython.
Do they work? These don't open up a server socket by default. At least
we'd have narrowed the issue down.

Hi Ganesh,

Sig 9 usually means your job was killed by the system. Is it possible 
that you have exhausted the available ram or hit some artificial limit 
that is imposed by your batch system?

I can't think of any right away. The fact that pvpython was able to run the
same script should mean that there's enough RAM to go around. In any case
I'm using this machine

http://www.psc.edu/index.php/computing-resources/blacklight#hardware

And 128 GB of RAM is more than enough for my 400,000 cell problem. Is there
anyway I can get more information?

assuming that you've already examined all the output, and there's no 
other info, you could do a couple of things: put some print statements 
in your python script to see how far it makes it. Also you could use MPT 
specific environment variables that tell mpt to print a stack trace, see 
man mpi. A debug build may be helpful for this.

before all this debugging effort you may want try a very simple script 
to gain confidence that things are indeed working correctly with your 
build. I'll send a simple test script that might be of use for that.

Utkarsh, I'm not sure if pvbatch and pvpython work: they don't exit immediately, but they don't seem to be doing anything either. They don't seem to respond to any input.

Subject: [Paraview] help about the paraview comparative view
Message-ID: <CAHrmR1Wm8XPrhi7BfjPAfs=YtDJQO4YOqx8DGYeZss2KoHZ+jQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:

         I have a problem with the paraview comparative view.
I have a sequence of deformable mesh under deformation.
I would like to record a screenshort the intermediate view of the surface
mesh
together with normal directions in the vertex.

         I open the mesh* file and then add a glyph for the normal
directions.
         I am trying to use the comparative view by open a new layout
window.
However, there is a complain
 "Generic Warning: In
..\..\..\..\src\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 715

Call not supported for the current property type."
I am not sure what this means and what is the reason for this?
whether I should change some setting for this or not.

Thank you very much.

regards,
Alex

Message-ID: <D7E4CFF78B9414498AEBFA93CD791D7C481AF6@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

I am trying to open some Tiff (.tif) files in ParaView, which contain an image sequence. I have converted the Tiff files to .raw format (using ImageJ) and opened them in ParaView using the "Raw (binary) Files" reader. But I am unable display the object, I get various errors been shown in the Output Messages window.

Can anyone guide me of the values to be used in "Properties" tab for correctly interpreting a .tif file converted to .raw?

I have uploaded one of the Tiff files I am using here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/39gr4ik03l8fmoh/nir_tomo.tif
It was originally a 32bit Tiff file, but I converted it to 8bit to reduce the file size.

Thanks for any help
James

LDAV CONTEST DEADLINE EXTENSION (Deadline: 22 August 2012)

The contest submission deadline for the LDAV Contest 2012 has been
extended to midnight (EDT) Wednesday, 22 August 2012. Please consider
making a submission. Thanks.

CALL FOR CONTEST SUBMISSIONS
============================

IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)
VisWeek 2012 in Seattle, Washington
14-15 October 2012
Website: http://www.ldav.org/

LDAV
The Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)
brings together domain scientists,  data analytics and visualization
researchers, HPC specialists, and database technology providers,
fostering innovative solutions to the unique problems encountered in
analysis and visualization of extremely large-scale data.

The LDAV Visualization Contest focuses on the area of visualization of
extremely large datasets. The goal is to device a visualization or a
visualization algorithm that allows exploration of a chosen HPC
dataset. The primary challenges will the size of the computational
grid, the number of co-located variables, and the time series.

The contest aims at demonstrating how visualization algorithms can be
scaled to very large computational infrastructures and handle
extremely large datasets. It shows how techniques at the forefront of
visualization research can have practical impacts upon real world
problems.

PARTICIPATION

The contest is open to everyone except contest organizers, judges, and
sponsors. We invite submissions from individuals or teams, from
industry or academia. See the http://www.ldav.org/viscontest.html web
page for details on submission requirements.

Chris Johnson and Mike Papka - Symposium Co-Chairs

Message-ID: <1139794023.11729396.1344520011931.JavaMail.root@mail.gatech.edu>

Hello everyone.  I hope this email finds you in the best of spirits.  I have a question about Paraview.  When one of my users tries to run it on a workstation he gets the following error message.

X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3
   Extension:    137 (Uknown extension)
   Minor opcode: 4 (Unknown request)
   Resource id:  0x2e00273

When I load some data with paraview ..  I cannot visualize their result


Does this look familiar to anyone?  I am running Paraview on my machine, and do not get the message.  Both systems are RHEL 6.3 fully patched and updated.

It doesn't even get past the first line i.e the module import line. I'm
unable to get it to force a core dump as "ulimit -c unlimited" is not
working. I've asked the system administrator about the issue.

But in the meanwhile can I force a debug compilation? How can I do that?
Just add "-g" to CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS?

I'm able to get the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter through the GUI's
python interpretor so I'm not sure what's causing your problem. Could you
share the script?

I am able to cause problems if I don't have an active filter/source when
creating the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter since it complains, as it
should, that there isn't a proper input for it.

Its really strange it took me several tries of doing the same thing to get the error. Just to make sure its not any typo, I used python trace to get the script I attached to this e-mail (test.py). As I understand it should run no problem in the python shell. I highlight the data set (STSone) in the pipeline and ran the script and still get


Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 6, in <module>

TypeError: 'GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet' object is not callable



On a side note I'm getting this:

QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 2

QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints

QPainter::setBrush: Painter not active

QPainter::end: Painter not active, aborted

What is this error? It pops up periodically...

I'm able to get the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter through the GUI's python interpretor so I'm not sure what's causing your problem. Could you share the script?

I am able to cause problems if I don't have an active filter/source when creating the GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet filter since it complains, as it should, that there isn't a proper input for it.

as the error indicates; it is not related to the spelling. After I sent out the first e-mail I tried Paraview 3.14.0 Linux 64-bit and it works, so for what I need this is fine. I think it is a bug that needs to be fixed in 3.14.1, if it hasn't already been fixed in the developers version.

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 6, in <module>

TypeError: 'GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet' object is not callable


when I try to take the gradients of the velocity by calling: GradientsOfUnstructuredDatSet(). This worked in 3.12.0, did something change? Is there a quick fix for this? Please let me know. I would go back to the old version except that the numpy eig functions return 0+0i for any matrix I throw at it (so another bug which I assume won't be fixed since its an older version).

OK if I can figure it out I will let you know.

I downloaded both versions from the Paraview downloads page.

I ran your script after creating a source and using the python calculator to create the velocity and pressure fields and didn't have any problems with 3.14.1. If you can figure out a way to reliably reproduce the problem I can try to fix it.

I've never seen the QPainter warning. Did you build ParaView yourself or use an installer?

When exactly that error happen ? When you load the file or when you
try to render it inside the comparative view ?

Could you be more precise on what you've done and when something
unexpected happen ?

Thanks,

Seb

this sounds more and more external to pv. For example if you compiled 
your program with one version of mpi but tried to run it with another, 
you'd very likely see exactly what you are seeing here. A few of things 
you could look at to boost your confidence: "module list", "which 
mpirun", "echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH", "ldd pvbatch" all of which will let 
you confirm that your environment is using the mpi and library versions 
that you expect, and that PV itself can find it's dependencies.

Sometimes sys admins in attempt to make things easy load modules for 
you. So when you are put into a new shell you environment is  changed. 
And of course the default modules will change as packages are updated. 
This could lead to unexepected weird problems over time. So, when 
running something like paraview that has a lot of dependencies, it can 
be helpful if you "freeze" your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. copy these 
into a bash script (or module file) which you source when using 
paraview, and then pass these into your qsub script with "-v" option.

Is your user running ParaView in client-server mode?  This error message
looks like ParaView failed to open up an X window.  This usually happens
when running ParaView on a server with no Xhost or with an Xhost that the
server process does not have permissions to open a window.  It could
happen after data is loaded because the window will be created only when
remote rendering is needed, and this happens only after the amount of data
to render goes above a certain threshold.

I have not seen this error in a while.  I thought the most recent versions
of ParaView were better about checking for this condition and disabling
remote rendering after a warning to the user.  What version of ParaView
are you using?

-Ken

I tried opening the supplied tiff file as in both ParaView and pvpython 
(version 3.14.1) but got a segfault both times.

Here's the pvpython script that failed:

	import paraview.vtk.io
	reader = paraview.vtk.io.vtkTIFFReader()
	reader.SetFileName("data/nir_tomo.tif")
	reader.Update()
	print 'ready to write'
	writer = paraview.vtk.io.vtkXMLImageDataWriter()
	writer.SetFileName("/home/hal/data/nir_tomo.vti")
	writer.SetInputConnection(reader.GetOutputPort())
	writer.Update()

hi Jourdain:


     I will have this kind of problem every time I do like this:
     1). I open a series of mesh files as   mesh* files.
     2). Then I open a layout view by click the '+' sign. A new tab with
2x2 views are generated.
     3). Then if I add a 3D glyph and choose in the property tab glyph type
as 'line', a output  message window pops out and it says:

Generic Warning: In
..\..\..\..\src\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 729

Call not supported for the current property type.
If I choose tab glyph type as 'arrow', there is not this warning.

another thing is that some times if I would like to change 'glyph type'
from 'arrow' to
'line', only the glyph in the first view of the nxn views changes from the
arrow to
line, there others remain to be arrow. but then if I close the comparative
tab, paraview will
crash.
Thank you very much.

regards,
Alex

I messed around with it a little more and was able to extract raw binary 
from the tiffs with GraphicsMagick's convert:

     $ convert nir_tomo.tif nir_tomo.gray

I then verified that the file size was correct:

     $ ls -l nir_tomo.gray
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 hal hal 22048706 Aug 10 07:57 nir_tomo.gray
     $ echo $(( 239 * 239 * 386 ))
     22048706

Then I opened it in ParaView as a raw binary file.  I specified the 
extent as [0,238,0,238,0,385], since the dimensions of the image were 
[239,239,386].

I just ran into this again, and found this old thread. Is there a way
to find_package(VTK) at the root project level, and then optionally
find_package(Paraview) in a subdirectory? The idea is a structure like
this: https://github.com/daviddoria/PointSetSurfaceReconstruction

For the Streaming and Manta plugins I took the approach of having the
VTK and PV level code in sibling directories. The PV level was
processed first and a variable set that changes the VTK level
cmakelists behavior slightly (for example whether to findpackage vtk
or not and whether to include ParaView centric VTK level classes). One
tricky part was getting the ParaView client server wrapper and
instantiators turned on for the VTK level directory. The plugin macros
only take care of that for the ParaView level directory so the VTK
level directory had to be done manually.

Note: The cmake code for those plugins has not yet been updated to
work in VTK6/PV4 but making the VTK level directory a standard module
should simplify things significantly (I hope).

Subject: [Paraview] Copy sources repeatedly with Programmable Filter
Message-ID: <F0D23576-9614-4EB5-8708-4AB0B94C58ED@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to copy vtkPolyData sources with Programmable Filter.
My latest code is here:
> input = self.GetPolyDataInput()
> output = self.GetPolyDataOutput()
> points = vtk.vtkPoints()
> for i in range(0, input.GetNumberOfPoints()):
>     point_i = input.GetPoint(i)
>     x, y, z = point_i[:3]
>     z = z + 2.0
>     points.InsertPoint(i, x, y, z)
> output.SetPoints(points)

And now I want to copy them repeatedly with only one filter.
(Ex: 10 blocks at intervals.)
How to do it?

Subject: [Paraview] FieldView to ParaView Converter
Message-ID: <50265E57.3000305@mac.com>

I have been asked a few times for this and the original link died. So 
here it is again. It is not a general converter - it only works for 
ascii output for unstructured surface meshes and streamlines and the 
output is legacy vtk. This was all I needed when I wrote it.

The original c++
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18375146/fvpv.tgz

A new Python port
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18375146/fvpv_py_source.zip

A Windows executable packaged using py2exe - put the .exe on your 
desktop and drag a Fieldview file onto the icon. The converted file will 
be written back to the same directory as the original but with '.vtk' 
appended to the name.
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18375146/fvpv_exe.zip

If this is useful to you, or you have comments/requests/patches please post.

It sounds like you want to select all of the sources and apply the 
Append Geometry filter.

Message-ID: <CACeyOhZcT1XbGXP5y802DqTi8CxuXct_yO9-Fz_MaYXua1NYTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have two surfaces, one on the other, with different scalars and sizes
(one is bigger than the other),
and I'd like to present one surface above the other, it means that both of
them will be visible,
but the bigger won't be visible in the places where the smaller is
presented.

How am I doing that?

Thanks in advance!

hi Jourdain:

     Together with this problem, I found there are several problems more.
some times when I open a comparative view and it works well,
but when I close this comparative view, there is a small black window
popping
out and the paraview crashes.

      Another kind of paraview crash happens when I load the state file
with
comparative view.  If I saved several layout views with some of them
comparative views
in as the *.pvsm file.  If I load this file, I have occasionally met crash
problem.
I wonder if you can repeat these problems and update the software.
Thank you very much for your help.

regards,
Alex

You should create a Mantis account and report that bug with the state
file attach to it as well as the steps to reproduce the issue on a
given ParaView version...

Message-ID: <CAOqTh=mEsOjdruOOFqhWQM1D4v=ZwSOAnRZmz48SbkiqQWUrjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am starting to use paraView to visualize geophysical property models,
with good success.

However, I have been running in to some issues/questions will
1. What is the NaN value in codes? I have region (the air) in a rectilinear
grid that I would like to exclude from the rendering. I would prefer not
having to use the threshold filter, since it changes the model into a
unstructured grid.

2. Using occtree meshes in paraview. I have been able to import octree mesh
made in an independant program in to paraView as a legacy unstructured grid
of the octree cells. I was that there is a .vso file format for octree, but
I haven't able to find any further information about the file format. Can
anybody recommend some sources? As well, is it possible to generate octree
grids in paraView, that I could export and use elsewhere?

3. Have been running into issues with extract subset filter. When I save
the state and load the state up, a get a strange behaviour for the boundary
values. All of the Voi's become -1 and can't adjust them. The pipelines
that follow still work, but if I re-apply the extract subset filter,
everything breaks. What could be the cause for this?

[image: Inline image 2]
Above is a screenshot of the extract subset filter, after I load the state
into paraView again.

4.ParaView crashes quite frequently, when I turning objects on and off. Are
there any know issues that could cause this?

Thanks very much in advance for the help.

Hi Hal,


Thanks for your reply.

What I want to do is:
1. Read or generate one source (Box, Sphere, or other PolyData)
2. Copying it repeatedly (hundreds of copies, along both x and y axes)

So far I wrote a VTK file including all sources,
but now I want to to change the numbers, sizes and pitches on ParaView.

I have a 3D PV mesh. I would like to clip the top.
Is it possible with ParaView to renumerate the vertices, volumes, faces 
of the mesh that remains?
Hope my question is clear.

Message-ID: <CAJtBfr-0HEdD1r-05QrMhWkZSaEFG-E79DHy4Ox75K5rdTLkKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a crash similar to this one:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-February/023797.html

I had produced a couple of line charts using Plot Over Line, saved
that as a state und now I try to load that state.

Is there anything known about this bug? I'm using the Paraview 64bit
build from the homepage.

X Error: BadColor (invalid Colormap parameter) 12
  Major opcode: 1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Resource id:  0x4e00001


Thanks,

Florian

Try this: recreate plot over line then close the plot view and save
state and reload it. Does that work? If so, we'd have narrowed the
problem to the plot view.

I've noticed that the slice filter is having similar issue: apply 
activated by selecting in the pipeline browser. In my panels this was 
because pv is creating/destroying the panel as the object is 
selected/deselected in the browser so I had to be more careful during 
the initialization not to mark the object as modified, it's probably a 
similar issue.

A second issue, I have been experiencing crashes with the histogram 
filter in parallel. After loading data and adding the histogram things 
become unstable and crash. The render view occasionally gets trashed. 
The crash often comes when resizing the window or creating or deleting a 
view with the following output in the terminal. More server ranks seems 
to help it crash. Occasionally it doesn't crash.

On a Unix-type system,
	tail -c +81 INPUT_FILE > NEW_FILE
will strip the 80 byte header.

Subject: [Paraview] Would like to apply a "saved state" to any similar model
Message-ID: <CAPfnAvmnq_GtpzdDh66SFm88RbXsFvX4GUFk=Ne=9FX0Z08rXw@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to configure a sate in ParaView, save it, and then apply
that sate to any other model?  The desired effect is to save time but
cutting out repetitive "button-clicking" and filtering so that several
separate models can be compared with one another in the same state without
having to do each process every time for each model. Any help is
appreciated!

Hi Aaron,

you should look for python Macro instead. And you can easily create a
macro by using the trace mechanism in ParaView. Then after few changes
to the script you can have a button on the toolbar that let you apply
the exact same pipeline to any selected data that you may want to
process.

The ParaView wiki might bring some more informations about that.

Subject: [Paraview] Dashboard night/master ubuntu x84
Message-ID: <502A0623.6060904@web.de>

Hi,

I noticed something weird while checking Dashboard results for section
"Nightly (master)": While the builds with names

  "Master-Win64-vs9-shared"
  "Win7x64-vs10-shared"

report during the CMake configure step:

  Determined Source Version : 3.14.1-1532-gdfc2396

the build named "ubuntu-x64-nightlymaster" reports a much older version:

  Determined Source Version : 3.12.0

(See http://open.cdash.org/viewConfigure.php?buildid=2514474 for full log.)

Basically my question is: what source version is really tested by the
build named "ubuntu-x64-nightlymaster" on site Blight.kitware?

Thanks
Karl

It's running into git issues for some reason and indeed testing an old
version. I'll check it out. Thanks for catching it.

Hi Hal,


Thanks again for your reply.
I've been trying almost all of the filters, but I didn't know
how to use the Glyph With Custom Source filter.

Applying the filter to plane source with any PolyData,
I got good results.

This seems to work, the state now loads without crash.

I still have a segfault when using the line plot this and then. Is
there any help sending a potentially large core dump?

It's an option, along with vorticity, under the Gradient of Unstructured
Dataset filter. The current behavior is a bit non-intuitive in that if you
check Compute Vorticity the output will be the vorticity (assuming a vector
field), otherwise the output will be the gradient. For the Compute
QCriterion option though it outputs that in addition to the other outputs.
This will get changed in 4.0 though to be a bit clearer.

Yes, this behavior has changed with the new panels. Property widgets
should be lightweight and avoid doing any heavy computation or
communication.

Also, if you could give me a list of steps to reproduce incorrect
modified flag issue I could take a look and fix it for you.

Subject: [Paraview] default behavior change for contour filter
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+Hy7BU3-BEmowjuT5G5UmMT0v3tjQ-5G+AZT-_Qm3wozA@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to change ParaView's default behavior of the contour filter.
Currently the default is to compute normals and not compute gradients or
scalars. These defaults are only used for structured data sets (i.e.
vtkStructuredGrid, vtkImageData, and vtkRectilinearGrid) and are not
options when isosurfacing for vtkPolyData or vtkUnstructuredGrids. When the
input data set is a multiblock data set that contains both structured and
unstructured data sets the output for the current code results in a
multiblock data set with partial arrays (Normals for the structured data
sets and the contoured variable for the unstructured data sets). The change
I'd like to make is to make Compute Normals off by default and Compute
Scalars on by default so that the output is a bit more consistent.

Does anyone think that this is a significant change and shouldn't be done?

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Kyle,

Thanks, the following steps reproduce slice filter issue:

start paraview, build the following pipeline:

wavelet source -> slice

in the pipeline browser:

select wavelet, select slice, select wavelet

The slice filter is marked modified.

Is there going to be a way of undocking the display properties from the 
object properties? In our filters/sources with a number of properties 
having that real estate makes it easier to use.

May be it is obvious, but why we don't compute normal's for
vtkPolyData in the first place? If the input has normal's array, then
I would assume that output should have normal's by default.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating Large Datasets from CSV
Message-ID: <502BE336.5030403@mst.edu>

Hello,

I'm creating a reader to convert large dataset from CSV to a ParaView 
readable format. XDMF was chosen because it seems like a simple-to-use 
and understand format. This worked well while I was testing small 
datasets but when I scaled up to larger data, I ran across a problem 
where the XML node was too large (could not have 350,000 rows).

I want to make sure now that I am on the right track. I've decided to 
start researching the HDF5 format and will place all of my data into an 
HDF5 file and then include that in the XDMF file. Does this seem 
reasonable? Is there a better way to do it?

Thank you,
David Zemon

Just curious, is ParaView's CSV reader not sufficient for reading your files?

David,

I'm currently working on a translator that sounds very similar to
yours. It uses HDF5 for the heavy data and that part works fine.

For what it's worth, my experience is that the Xdmf library is
painfully slow when serializing a large tree. For some of the data
sets that I work with, writing the XML description of the data takes
far longer than writing the HDF5 files.

David,

I'm CC'ing the list in case it helps others or others have insight.

I'm accessing the Xdmf2 and H5 libraries through C++. The XML
descriptions generated by our translator are sometimes several
megabytes. They are large because there are sometimes many hundreds of
time steps and a dozen or so fields, and the data is replicated in
several grids in the various coordinate spaces that our collaborators
want to see.

I did some profiling of the Xdmf2 library and the problem seems to be
that when the XML text is being generated, the buffer reallocation
strategy is to create a new buffer with just enough room to hold the
newly serialized XML, and the text in the previous buffer is copied
into the new buffer. In other words, there is a lot of excess copying
going on. I modified my local copy of the Xdmf2 library to change the
memory reallocation strategy to double the size of the buffer any time
a reallocation is needed, and that sped up the serialization
tremendously. Building the Xdmf tree still took a long time, but I
haven't looked into why that is slow.

I may be wrong, but Xdmf2 doesn't seem to be under active development
and there doesn't seem to be much community support of it, which is a
shame because it is a nice format.

The input doesn't have to be a polydata and usually won't be a polydata so
it won't have normals already computed. if compute scalars is on then all
the arrays are passed from the input to the output but if compute scalars
is off then all but the array selected for contouring will be passed to the
output.

Message-ID: <C1449BEF40D5CC46B21272BB352906597C1D9BE0E6@EXC3.ad.colorado.edu>

I am trying to integrate a scalar over a 3D volume. I was surprised to find that the Integrate Variables filter does not do this; when integrating a scalar variable of 1 over a cube of size 1 X 1 X 1, Integrate Variables returns the value of 6. The documentation says it will integrate over lines and surfaces only. Suggestions please.

Additional context: I am working with velocity field data, read in via the Ensight format. I have calculated vorticity, and vorticity magnitude, and I want the integral of the vorticity magnitude in a volume defined by an extracted subset.
Thanks

Hi Kyle,

Have you noticed that sources with 3d widgets (eg line source) have 
duplicate entries?

I just pulled from master and saw the new property and display buttons 
to collapse their respective properties, that's nice! It would be great 
if when collapsed the display button would then move to the bottom of 
the widget freeing up real estate for the remaining properties.

Andy,
I tried this with can and disk_out_ref, and didn't have the option to change these settings (not sure why).  Then, I tried wavelet, and without normal, lighting is messed up (it now looks like flat shading).  I am thinking we don't want lighting messed up for contours.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] default behavior change for contour filter

I'd like to change ParaView's default behavior of the contour filter. Currently the default is to compute normals and not compute gradients or scalars. These defaults are only used for structured data sets (i.e. vtkStructuredGrid, vtkImageData, and vtkRectilinearGrid) and are not options when isosurfacing for vtkPolyData or vtkUnstructuredGrids. When the input data set is a multiblock data set that contains both structured and unstructured data sets the output for the current code results in a multiblock data set with partial arrays (Normals for the structured data sets and the contoured variable for the unstructured data sets). The change I'd like to make is to make Compute Normals off by default and Compute Scalars on by default so that the output is a bit more consistent.

Does anyone think that this is a significant change and shouldn't be done?

Thanks,
Andy

The files I am working with are small test files, so size is not an issue whatsoever. When I load the PVD file in ParaView, the animation is already loaded properly, and I can just click play. When I load the PVD file through pvpython (code at bottom of message), the animation is not automatically created. The ParaView Guide mentions that "When you load time-varying data, ParaView automatically creates a default animation that allows you to play through the temporal domain of the data without manually creating an animation to do so." This does seem to explain what I am experiencing, however, I have not been able to figure out how to manually create the animation.

My guess is that I am not using the right value for "cue.AnimatedPropertyName", but I am not sure what else is available to use.


Thanks!
-Colan

P.S. The test files are just a cube that has some varying data on one corner, I would be happy to send them to anyone that would like them.

Hi Alan,

I can't tell what type of blocks are in the multiblock data set of can and
disk_out_ref but I'm guessing some of them are either unstructured or
polydata and if they are, those options get disabled since they're only
available for topologically structured input grids.

As for the contours of wavelet, I didn't check that out before but that's a
good point. I'm playing around with adding normals for unstructured grid
inputs since the current set up doesn't allow that but maybe it should.

If your data is a Uniform Rectilinear Grid (vtkImageData), then the 
volume integral is approximated by the sum of the scalar field 
multiplied by the spacing.  You could put the following into a 
Programmable Filter:

	scalar_array = numpy.array(inputs[0].PointData['RTData'])
	space = inputs[0].GetSpacing()
	print scalar_array.sum() * space[0] * space[1] * space[2]

(I tested it out on an extracted subset of a wavelet.)

Dear All,

I think there may be some option to check, but I can not find it.
I use the output of a MaskPoint filter as the source of a ParticleTracer
Filter, with random sampling.
Problem is : MaskPoint filter output points change at every timestep. Is
there a way to freeze the MaskPoint Filter during  the animation ?

Dear All

I am new to ParaView. I need to write binary files from my C code for viz with ParaView. So far, I assign values to a M x N 2D array, and write legacy VTK files - that works fine. I used code as pasted below to see if I can get the binary output (which uses a simple fwrite) working, but was unable to viz the data in the binary output. Can someone suggest how to write ParaView raw binary files (hopefully with minimal headers), and how to viz them interactively using the GUI.

thanks
Sanjay

relevant code part:

    // write to file
    if (fcnt == 40) {
// Legacy VTK format: this works fine.
        str = malloc (64*sizeof(char));
        sprintf (str, "fhn_2d_%d.vtk", cnt++);
        out1 = fopen (str, "wt");
        free(str);
        fprintf(out1, "# vtk DataFile Version 3.0\n");
        fprintf(out1, "vtk output\n");
        fprintf(out1, "ASCII\n");
        fprintf(out1, "DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS\n");
        fprintf(out1, "DIMENSIONS %d %d 1\n",N+1,M+1); // N+1 columns, M+1+header rows
        fprintf(out1, "SPACING 1 1 1\n");
        fprintf(out1, "ORIGIN 0 0 0\n");
        fprintf(out1, "POINT_DATA %d\n",(N+1)*(M+1)); // total number of points on structured data.
        fprintf(out1, "SCALARS ImageFile float 1\n");
        fprintf(out1, "LOOKUP_TABLE default\n");
        for (m = 0; m <= M; m++) {
            for (n = 0; n <= N; n++)
            fprintf (out1, "%6.4f ", u[n][m]);
            fprintf (out1, "\n");
        }
        fclose (out1);

        // binary output of the same data. Limited understanding of what ParaView wants.
        str = malloc(64*sizeof(char));
        sprintf(str,"fhn2d%d.bin",cnt);
        out1 = fopen(str,"wb");
        free(str);
        fwrite(u,sizeof(float),(N+1)*(M+1),out1);

        fcnt = 0;

Why don't you construct VTK objects and use a VTK writer to write the file?

Something like this:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/IO/XMLStructuredGridWriter

It seems like you are reinventing the wheel a little bit by actually
formatting the file to VTK file format specifications manually.

Hi all,


I'm trying to apply Calculator filter to active source
from the Python Shell.
I executed these codes:
> calc = Calculator()
> calc.AttributeMode = "point_data"
> calc.Function = "iHat+jHat+kHat"

Applying the script, a new Calculator source is generated,
but the source isn't activated on the current view.
Valid sources have eye icons on the Pipeline Browser,
but the Calculator source which is generated by Python
doesn't have it.

How can I finish to generate the filter source from Python?

Hi David, All

Thanks for the suggestion. However, I cannot incorporate any dependencies into my code. Since posting my message, I have discovered that I can put a text header (similar to VTK ASCII) and then the data in binary into the output files. The problem (if there a problem!) has now evolved to getting the binary fwrite to be big endian - or is there another way? For completeness, the revised bit of code is here:

	// write to file
	if (fcnt == 40) { 
		str = malloc (64*sizeof(char));
		sprintf (str, "fhn_2d_%d.vtk", cnt++);
// the ASCII works.
		out1 = fopen (str, "wt");
		free(str);
		fprintf(out1, "# vtk DataFile Version 2.0\n");
		fprintf(out1, "vtk output\n");
		fprintf(out1, "ASCII\n");
		fprintf(out1, "DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS\n");
		fprintf(out1, "DIMENSIONS %d %d 1\n",N+1,M+1); // N+1 columns, M+1+header rows
		fprintf(out1, "SPACING 1 1 1\n");
		fprintf(out1, "ORIGIN 0 0 0\n");
		fprintf(out1, "POINT_DATA %d\n",(N+1)*(M+1)); // total number of points on structured data.
		fprintf(out1, "SCALARS ImageFile float 1\n");
		fprintf(out1, "LOOKUP_TABLE default\n");
		for (m = 0; m <= M; m++) {
			for (n = 0; n <= N; n++)
			fprintf (out1, "%6.4f ", u[n][m]);
			fprintf (out1, "\n");
		}
		fclose (out1);

		// binary output of the same data. this does not work.
		str = malloc(64*sizeof(char));
		sprintf(str,"fhn2d%d.bin.vtk",cnt);
		out1 = fopen(str,"wab");
		free(str);
		fprintf(out1, "# vtk DataFile Version 2.0\n");
		fprintf(out1, "vtk output\n");
		fprintf(out1, "BINARY\n");
		fprintf(out1, "DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS\n");
		fprintf(out1, "DIMENSIONS %d %d 1\n",N+1,M+1); // N+1 columns, M+1+header rows
		fprintf(out1, "SPACING 1 1 1\n");
		fprintf(out1, "ORIGIN 0 0 0\n");
		fprintf(out1, "POINT_DATA %d\n",(N+1)*(M+1)); // total number of points on structured data.
		fprintf(out1, "SCALARS ImageFile float 1\n");
		fprintf(out1, "LOOKUP_TABLE default\n");
		fwrite(u,sizeof(float),(N+1)*(M+1),out1);
		fclose(out1);


		fcnt = 0;

The legacy VTK formats are agnostic with respect to endinaness, which is 
one reason why I almost never use the binary versions of them.

If you can't link to VTK and use vtkXMLImageDataWriter, as David 
suggested, then another option is to write a small C++ or Python program 
to convert from legacy ASCII to XML binary.  For example:

Hello, I'm attempting to build ParaView from the git repo with PGI 12.4 and I get the following errors for vtkSMTestDriver.cxx that I don't know how to fix:

"/usr/apps/vis/ParaView/repo/ParaView/Utilities/TestDriver/vtkSMTestDriver.cxx", line 434: error:
          expression must be a modifiable lvalue
      commandLine.insert(++commandLine.begin(), "--multi-servers");

        clientCommand.insert(++clientCommand.begin(), this->ServerURL.c_str());
                               ^

Also these, which I got around by adding #include <locale.h>
"/usr/apps/vis/ParaView/repo/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Core/vtkProcessModule.cxx", line 57: error:
          identifier "LC_NUMERIC" is undefined

    ^

And this, which I got around by adding #include <string>

"/usr/apps/vis/ParaView/repo/ParaView/VTK/Filters/AMR/vtkAMREnzoReader.h", line 70: error:
          namespace "std" has no member "string"
    int GetIndexFromArrayName( std::string arrayName );


Can someone suggest a fix for the lvalue error?
Thanks,

Hi David

That just about did the trick! It seems I can even store the whole array (I guess with some risk) and fwrite the big ended array. Its not an ideal situation, but better than what I have right now.

thanks
Sanjay

Subject: [Paraview] Numpy masking (via programm filter) not quite working in
	parallel
Message-ID: <1345237512.35086.YahooMailNeo@web140002.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I need to use Numpy in a lot of the programmable filters that I write, and I've run into differences in how its masking feature works in serial and parallel. Masking allows one to filter out portions of an array that do not pass some condition.


As an example, I've created a stock paraview wavelet, and saved it as a pvd file.? I then load it in, and run this inside of a programmable filter:
---

import numpy

data = inputs[0].PointData['RTData']
# create a mask that tells us which points are equal to one
mask = numpy.ma.masked_equal(data, 1)
# filter data array by the mask conditions (so that other points are excluded)
maskedPnts = numpy.extract(mask, data)

print len(maskedPnts)

---
In serial mode, I get 9261 points. With two processes, I get 2 x 4851 or 9702.? So masking always produces more points.

Any ideas to why that is?? Is there anything I can do/print out to see why masking doesn't quite work in parallel?

Thanks, Sohail

Hi Sohail,

This is likely caused by points shared on several processes. While ParaView splits the cells of a mesh across processes, cells on the boundary between processes share vertices. Thus if a vertex bounds cells split across 3 processes, that vertex will appear in 3 different lists of local vertices and thus be counted 3 times instead of once. There is nothing in ParaView for determining which vertices are shared (and by how many processes).

This also affects the statistics filters when run in parallel on point-centered data. For most large data, the number of vertices on inter-process boundaries is small compared to the total so we documented the behavior for the statistics filters but did not implement a solution (because the expected skew is small).

Hi,

I guess I forgot about the data duplication issue.? For most statistics that I calculate in parallel, the basic results are not affected that much (i.e. mean, standard dev). But for the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is a bit more complicated, there is a noticeable difference (0.833 for parallel and 0.99 for serial).

Will this point sharing information become available in later versions of ParaView? i.e. would it ever be easy to identify and count duplicates?


Thanks,

Sohail

Message-ID: <CAB0p=8A_P5E56npV5rMfbZwqJitdvJ3n8XbJNUeDWOHDNw+ZLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

In the "Open File" menu, I found that paraview supports "LAMMPS dump
files(*.dump)" and "LAMMPSStructure files". Yet when I load a dump
file nothing is visualized. However, there is some information about file -
how many points, domain size, etc. Do you have an idea what goes
wrong? I can't attach an example of data file because of this mail
list restriction
to the size of email but any dump/data file I generated using lammps
is not rendered in paraview.
However, there are some information about files loaded - like size, range, etc.
I use Paraview 3.14, vtk-5.10, MacOS Lion.

I tried to simply check the information tab the bounds of each cylinder and
then to calculate the Norma (sqrt((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2+(z1-z2)^2) for two
points p1(x1,y1,z1) and p2(x2,y2,z2) each point from another cylinder). But
then I figured out that the bounds are actually the *bounding box's bounds*.

So, my question is: how am I getting the information about a point which
was extracted from a cylinder?
I guess that a solution might be: filter->extract selection->information
tab and then as described above. but I'm searching for a *shorter way* ...

any suggestions?

Best,
Hila.

Hi David,


Thanks for your reply.
Executing Show() command, the Calculator Filter is activated.

# Show() command isn't recorded by "Start Trace",

Hi there,

I tested Paraview 3.14.1 Tecplot Reader with a basic Tecplot file, it always gives error as follows:

1. ParaDIS Tecplot Files

I attach the data files (1particle.dat and 1particle.tec, they have the same content, just different suffix) and the visualized image by Tecplot.

Can you please help? I believe ParaView is able to handle these fundamental unstructured Finite Element Data from Tecplot, with the zone header as follows:
ZONE N=134, E=144, DATAPACKING=POINT, ZONETYPE=FEQUADRILATERAL

Thanks,
Beichuan

Subject: [Paraview] Behavior of a plugin reader that shares the same proxy
 name as one of the internal readers?
Message-ID: <20120819.160018.267061931.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

My reader plugin shares the same name as one of the builtin readers of
ParaView (OpenFOAMReader), as shown in the following server side XML.

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
    <SourceProxy name="OpenFOAMReader" class="vtkPOFFDevReader">
....

If my memory serves me right I read in this list that a plugin has
precedence over an internal object in searching for a proxy. Indeed,
in the past released versions of ParaView (including 3.14.1), the
plugin reader has worked well in overriding the internal
reader. However, with the git-master of ParaView (as of today), when I
open an OpenFOAM case, the constructor of my reader panel (derived
from pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel) gets executed but "this->proxy()"
picks up the proxy for the internal reader. I wonder if this is a
design change?

Hello.

Your Tecplot file is written as an Unstructured grid with quadrilateral 
elements.
The Tecplot reader in Paraview cannot read this: it assumes that the 
file contains a MultiBlock Structured grid (with 3 index I, J and K for 
a volume, or only two index I and J for a surface)

When I see your image, I think that you can write your grid in a 
Structured format.

Moreover, a file header is missing. You should have a header with two 
lines: line for the title end a line for the variables:

TITLE="SOMETHING"
VARIABLES="X" "Y" "Z"

Richard.

Hello.

Sorry, I made a mistake in my previous mail: I see in the Tecplot reader 
help that it should be able to read unstructured:
> The output of the reader is a vtkMultiBlockDataset, of which each 
> block is either a vtkStructuredGrid or a vtkUnstructuredGrid.


But I never succeeded in reading my own Tecplot unstructured grids with 
triangle elements, so I can't help you for this type of file.

Also, I had some problems in reading some structured grids because some 
Tecplot options in the ZONE card are not recognized by the reader, and I 
had to suppress it. The Tecplot reader should still be improved.

But if you try again Tecplot files with Structured or Unstructure grids, 
don't forget the two header lines for title and variables.

Richard.

Subject: [Paraview] Asking for Tecplot reader improvements and a sample
 Tecplot file for Unstructured Grids
Message-ID: <5032309A.4030400@onera.fr>

Hello,

The Tecplot reader is very usefull, but it should be further improved 
because many Tecplot files (written by the user according to Tecplot 
format specifications or written by Tecplot itself !) still cannot be read !

I am usually using Structured grid, and the Tecplot reader works fine 
for most of my ASCII files, except for those that are written by Tecplot 
itself and that contain the STRANDID and SOLUTIONTIME tokens that are 
currently unsupported. I have to remove these unsupported tokens from 
all ZONE headers before reading with Paraview. May I suggest to ignore 
those unsupported tokens with just a warning rather than stopping reading ?

Another problem is with Unstructured grids. Reading the mail of Beichuan 
Yan (subject =Paraview 3.14.1 Tecplot Reader Errors ), I tried to read 
several ASCII Tecplot files with unstructured grids. Some of my files 
made Paraview freeze, other could not be read and gave many error 
messages such as :

"The record type XXX found in the file is unknown"

where xxx may be some coordinate data or something else.

It seems that the reader is bad positioned in the file because one or 
more token in the "ZONE" header are not recognized.

Looking at the reader source file, I tried to modify the header of 
simple Tecplot files with TRIANGLE or QUADRILATERAL elements, but I 
never succeeded in identifying which token is not recognized.

So, at that time, is the Tecplot reader really able to read unstructured 
grids or not ? If yes, could someone provide a sample Tecplot file for 
unstructured grid that Paraview can read ? This would help identifying 
what is not well recognized in the true Tecplot format.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards

Takuya,

I am surprised it worked in 3.14. I don;t think there has been much
change in the ServerManager since 3.14. I could track down what change
caused it, but nonetheless, I think it's probably not a good idea to
override default proxy. You should just create a new one with a new
name and still assign to the same extensions. The user will be
presented a dialog to pick which reader to create when he opens a
matching extension file. That way state files/python scrips referring
to one or the other will continue to work seamlessly without one
accidentally creating the other one, etc.

BTW, is there are newer version of the OpenFOAM reader that needs to
go into ParaView for the upcoming release?

It is possible to share a sample dataset to reproduce this problem? If
not, even if you share a capture of the "Properties" panel and
Information Panel with the reader active would help.

I'm trying to build against OSMesa so there should be no paraview GUI.

There's a configure error that seems to be about the missing paraview.

Did I miss something in the configuration?

Hi Utkarsh,

The patch worked, thank you. I hadn't seen that before so I made a small test and both Intel and GNU will compile code that uses ++ with an iterator, but PGI won't.

I also had:

VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkExtentRCBPartitioner.h", line 160: error: 
          namespace "std" has no member "string"
       void PrintExtent( std::string name, int ext[6] );

which I fixed with #include<string> as the AMR Enzo reader below.

Also got these errors, but I don't need this plugin so I just disabled it. Looks like PGI doesn't support those _mm_* functions.

Sweet! Looks pretty good to me. The vtkpython issue is a known one.
Let me see if I can wrangle a fix out.

In-Reply-To: <5031FAC6.50605@onera.fr>

Message-ID: <D67303F39678724DA65819E042CB36986F8CB105EE@EXC2.ad.colorado.edu>

Hi Richard,

Thank you for your feedback. While we are hoping that Paraview developers resolve this problem and accomplish a usable Tecplot reader, I may rewrite a code to output my data as legacy .vtk ASCII files.

May I ask you a question? it is probably simple: how to convert a legacy .vtk ASCII file to a binary file. Tecplot provides such a command line tool, preplot, which compresses data greatly before loading into Tecplot, otherwise uncompressed data could eat up all the memory quickly. For my own large scale simulation of particles, one snapshot generates as much as 14GB data for Tecplot, and preplot shrinks them to 2GB! I will run Paraview in parallel processing mode, but it is always optimal to compress ASCII data into binary before loading them into Paraview.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Paraview 3.14.1 Tecplot Reader Errors

Hello.

Sorry, I made a mistake in my previous mail: I see in the Tecplot reader help that it should be able to read unstructured:

 The output of the reader is a vtkMultiBlockDataset, of which each block is either a vtkStructuredGrid or a vtkUnstructuredGrid.


But I never succeeded in reading my own Tecplot unstructured grids with triangle elements, so I can't help you for this type of file.

Also, I had some problems in reading some structured grids because some Tecplot options in the ZONE card are not recognized by the reader, and I had to suppress it. The Tecplot reader should still be improved.

But if you try again Tecplot files with Structured or Unstructure grids, don't forget the two header lines for title and variables.

Richard.

You'll have to manually fetch pvvtk remote. Start by calling
"Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh" from ParaView source dir and that
will set up all remotes. Then cd into VTK and do a git fetch pvvtk.
You won't need this once the changes make into PAraView mater.

My mental image of the source tree just got a little more complex.

Here is a build with those changes :

Hello,

I have done some work in VTK towards that. Currently, this works only
with structured data.

If your data is structured, you can use vtkPStructuredGridConnectivity
to generate a bitmask (an unsigned char associated with each mesh
node). The bitmask can then be queried using the vtkGhostArray (See
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGhostArray.html) to see
which properties are "turned on" for the given mesh node. If the
IGNORE property is ON, that means that the node is a duplicate with
respect to the given process and should not be taken into account. The
implementation assigns ownership to the lowest rank of a mesh node --
on all other processes, the IGNORE property is set to ON.

TestPStructuredGridConnectivity illustrates how this can be used. The
test ensures that:
(1) Ensuring that the total number of nodes computed is invariant to
the number of processes/partitions
(2) Ensuring that computing the average for a given field is also
invariant to the numer of processes/partitions

If this could be useful in your work, I can elaborate more if you have
any questions on how to use it.

Best,
George

Hello

I don't know how to make this with a command line, but you may read your 
ASCII file, then use the menu File->Save Data, select the VTK file type, 
and you will have a popup window with some options:
- Data mode: ascii, binary or appended (default).
- Compressor: None (default) or Zlib

May be this could be automated with a Python script. Browse the mailing 
list: there are several subject about converting ascii to binary.

Also you make look here for Python vtk writers :

You can modify the lighting settings in the view settings.  There is a
button right above the rendering window (next to the camera undo/redo)
with an icon that looks like a dialog box.  You can also get to the view
settings from the menu bar Edit -> View Settings...

Hello Ken,

thx I tried to increase the light in every direction, but it does not work. 
I think it?s not possible to save this information in x3d file format.

Or is there any opportunity?

Thx,
Chris

ParaView uses OpenGL for its 3D rendering, and in OpenGL the light source
intensities are fixed to the range [0,1].  You cannot create a light
brighter than that.  You can add more lights, though.  I've known people
to turn on both the headlight and light kit to make objects more bright.

Now, in your last email you mentioned X3D, which has absolutely nothing to
do with the conversation so far.  Are you saying that you are exporting an
X3D scene and the scene looks darker in some other application that load
it?  That sounds like the other application, whatever it is, is not
lighting the same way ParaView is.  In that case, you will just have to
tweak the lighting parameters either in this other application or in the
X3D file.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF file format for nested mesh
Message-ID: <1345561868.77906.YahooMailNeo@web160502.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have an unstructured triangular grid and inside each triangle element i have little triangles, so i'm talking about a nested mesh. To be more clear i've drew an element of my mesh:
??????????????? 


???????????????*

???????????? /???? \

?????????? * ----?? *

???????? /???? \?? /? ?? \

????? * ----?? * ----?? *

?? /???? \???? / ??? \? ? /??? \

* -----? * -----? * ----- *


As you can see, i have points besides the vertex of the element which are forming little triangles inside. 


I was able to write a ".xmf" file to view the big triangles only (i've isolated the three vertex of all the elements and i've used a standard triangle topology) but i don't have any idea of how i can add information about the little triangles inside. I'm new to XDMF and Paraview, so please if you can give me a small example of how this can be done that will be very good.

Thank you all in advance!

Best regards,

Adrian

Subject: [Paraview] Xdmf Polyvertex, Only First Half Visible
Message-ID: <5033F6C8.3050007@mst.edu>

*Summary*
I'm creating a translator from CSV to Xdmf. My Xdmf file points to 
binary files with the heavy data. When I open the file in ParaView, only 
the first half of my data is visible.

*Question*
Why am I only seeing half of the data?

*Details
*/Dataset
/The first 3 lines of my dataset look like this. Columns 1-3 are XYZ, 
column 4 is an attribute. I have two files with the same format, the 
first 3 columns of both files hold identical values, the 4th column 
different. This gives me 5 columns: 3 for XYZ, and 1 for each of 2 
attributes. Each file is 125,000 rows (making a cube that is 50x50x50).
**

               0.80000000          0.80000000 3.14154793     -34815.54578017
               0.80000000          0.80000000          2.89352122
    -34815.61573156
               0.80000000          0.80000000          2.78985515
    -34815.59134643

/Translator/
Python is my language of choice and the Xdmf file is written by hand, 
not the Xdmf python library. I read a single line from both files, split 
those lines into lists, assign each field to a dictionary {"X": 
[0.8000000], "Y": ...., "Energy1": [-34815.54578017], "Energy2": 
[-34962.99394561]}. I then loop through the dictionary and write the 
fields to their appropriate files, erasing the dictionary as I go, and 
increment a row counter. When both files are done, I create the topology 
file based on the row counter. When all binary files are written, I 
write the Xdmf file.

/Debugging Efforts/
In the "Information" tab of ParaView, under "Statistics", "Data Arrays", 
and "Bounds" I see all of the correct information. It shows the expected 
number of cells and the correct ranges for all 5 columns. If I turn on 
"Show cube axes" in "Display", the axes extend to the full range of the 
data, not just the half that is shown.
In a small, 15 row sample, I tried printing to the screen every piece of 
information before writing to the files. The screen shows every valid 
field of all 15 rows in both files.

*Attachment*
I've attached the output files from a small sample set (15 rows in each 
file) - one Xdmf and 4 binary files (geometry, topology, attribute 1 and 
2), and 2 CSV files (two 15 row datasets).

David,

I loaded the testTwoFile.xdmf in ParaView 3.14.1. I counted 8 points
in the surface and points representations. Upon applying a Glyph
filter to the data set, I see all 15 points.

I've seen similar problems when loading point data from Xdmf files.
Perhaps there is a bug in how the surface and points representations
renders point data?

Interestingly, if you apply a Mask Points filter to your file data,
set the On Ratio to 1 and check the "Generate Vertices" option, you
will see all 15 points in the points and surface representations.

I know this doesn't answer your question about why only some of your
points are displayed, but hopefully I've presented some workarounds.

Cory

I think your topology is written incorrectly. Every other cell refers
to point 0.
See the spreadsheet view.

Hello,

The latest version of netcdf uses hdf5 as the printing backend, if
compiled. Is it possible to use xdmf together with netcdf to visualize in
Paraview? or, as an aside question, is there a way to convert from netcdf
to hdf5? Thanks a lot.

xdmf directly links to hdf5 and doesn't know anything about netcdf4. I
think you have to implement a new XdmfValues sublcass that makes
netcdf lib calls to do this.

You might have better luck asking on the xdmf mailing list. There
someone familiar with the xdmf3 work might know if it has already been
done and respond.

Yes, I do this all the time. I work with a coastal ocean model that
generates netcdf4-formatted output (which is hdf5, as you say). 

I wrote a little utility that looks at the netcdf4 data file and
generates a small ascii xml file in XDMF format to accompany and
describe the much larger netcdf4 data file. Then I start paraview, load
the xml file, and visualize the data.

Cheers
Jason

Is this something you can put up on github? And post a link to on the xdmf wiki?

Nice! Like Dave mentioned would be nice to have the source code available
on github.

I don't know the answer to most of the questions in this email.

I did however just push the latest VisItBridge tecplot reader into
ParaView master. That should make at least a few more tecplot files
readable.

Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A2F1719FD@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello,

I'm setting up someone's code to use coprocessing with OSMesa and openmpi/pgi/cuda fortran on NCSA's Forge using ParaView from the git repo. I'm getting segfaults and pgdbg gives me this error when coprocessorinitialize is called:

[0] Signalled SIGSEGV at 0x2B62188CFD9A, function vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor(), file /usr/apps/vis/ParaView/repo/ParaView/CoProcessing/CoProcessor/vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx, line 136
0x2B62188CFD9A:  48 8B 41 38            movq   56(%rcx),%rax

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()
{
  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline.cxx
coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Thanks,
Mark

David.

Thank you for the info about the new VisItBridge Tecplot reader.

But I cannot test it now because I have not all required libraries to 
rebuild PV from source and I am not the administrator to install them, 
so I will wait for the next PV binaries release.

But if someone has tried to read Tecplot Unstructured grids in ASCII 
format, it would be kind if he could provide a sample file (or just the 
ZONE header) so as I could try to modify the headers in my files.

Hello 

Yes I am happy to post the source code anywhere you like! Let me tell
you more about this utility that I've written:

1. The utility is generateXDMF.f90 (435 lines) ... plus adcmesh.f90 (263
lines), both written in fortran (since the developer community for this
model is most familiar with fortran). 

2. Highly specific to the ADCIRC finite element coastal ocean model
(i.e., unstructured data); not a general utility for any random type of
netcdf4 output. But could be useful as an example code for other
Paraview users.

3. Uses netcdf calls (not hdf5 calls) to open the data files, figure out
the dimensions, etc. Our community is more familiar with netcdf.

4. Recognizes 15 different ADCIRC output files and is able to write XDMF
for them.

5. Supports only 2D depth integrated ADCIRC output, but support for 3D
ADCIRC output would be straightforward to add. 

6. Supports time varying ADCIRC output by writing datasets as a Temporal
Collection in the xml. 

Mainly, I just wanted to point out that this is not a general tool, but
is specific to the data files produced by the ADCIRC model.

I've not used git yet (my projects all rely on svn), and I'm not sure
what is the best way to post to the XDMF wiki. Please advise. I'll email
the source code to the kitware developers directly to provide more
complete info.

Cheers
Jason

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some
more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this
and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView
with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been
ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more
information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your
ParaView build directory.

Hi Andy,

I set PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON to ON, is more needed? It did build pvpython, I don't know if that's separate thing entirely, though.
$ pvserver -version
paraview version 3.14.1-1549-g5f34f40

$ python -version
Python 2.6.6

$ cmake -version
cmake version 2.8.9

CMakeCache.txt is attached.

I also just noticed that ctest -R CoProcessing returns No tests were found!!!, yet it does have other tests.
Let me know what else you need.

Mark

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.

Hello,

I'm setting up someone's code to use coprocessing with OSMesa and openmpi/pgi/cuda fortran on NCSA's Forge using ParaView from the git repo. I'm getting segfaults and pgdbg gives me this error when coprocessorinitialize is called:

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()

  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline.cxx
coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Thanks,
Mark

Message-ID: <50350AF0.2030201@lbl.gov>

Hi,

On a windows debug build when running dashboards the following invalid 
access is reported. Unfortunately ms visual studio 10 express intercepts 
the crash with a dialog box the test times out and doesn't leave any 
useful info in the dashboard report. Any one know how to get msvc 
express 2010 to generate a stack trace? Short of re-defining assert, all 
documentation I've found is for the pro version and doesn't seem to work 
on express.

Message-ID: <50350C95.40103@lbl.gov>

Hi,

On hopper, nautilus, and very likely most other supercomputers 12 of the 
19 ctests that are available when using pv without x11 are failing 
because mpi is linked in but the appropriate mpiexec command is not used 
to launch the test. for eg: 
http://open.cdash.org/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=2527186 Would it 
be reasonable to launch these with "mpiexec" when pv is compiled with mpi?

Hi guys,

I am attempting to superbuild ParaViewWeb on CentOS 64-bit and I'm running
into a CMake error when it reaches the configuration stage for building
ParaViewWeb itself:

I looked around the CMake scripts a bit, but I'm not sure what the best way
to fix this is... any suggestions?

I'll push a fix for this soon to git-master, however in the time being
you'll have to do a

include(ParaViewPlugins)

at the top of  ParaViewAdapter/CMakeLists.txt file.

Again, I'll soon push a fix to ParaView master so that this won't be necessary.

I think I can fix these tests to not init MPI at all since they don't
run in Parallel. Would that help?

Burlen,

I have a topic on "next" named "fix_msvc_assert_dialogs" that hopefully
fixes this issue. It's suppossed to suppress the dialog when running tests
through ctest.

commit 691f44a7032b4aaacfd4dcfd2c63cf15a6fc2895
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 20 14:42:50 2012 -0400

    Avoid showing up assert dialogs on Windows.

    Hopefully this does the trick.

commit b40f31313eb8360ab2bdea4ad8771584471ad64c
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 22 14:37:42 2012 -0400

    Fix issues with MPI enabled systems.

    ServerManagerStateLoader was initing MPI even thought it wasn't run with
    mpiexec. This causes issues with certain MPI implementations. Since
    ServerManagerStateLoader is not meant to be run in parallel,
fixing the code to
    no init MPI by picking appropriate process type.

Hello Ken,

yes I saved it within x3d. Afterwards I converted it to wrl with the program BS Contract and finally I opened it with Zprint. Zprint is a program for rapid prototyping. In the last program, which is needed for a 3D print the 3D model looks not that bright. It looks more dark.

Therefore I wanted to know if there would be a opportunity to get more light.

Thx,
Chris

I have no experience with X3D or WRL or Zprint.  My speculation is that
since Zprint is for 3D printing, the lighting information is being dropped
from the data.  Either way, you cannot print a light source so the
lighting information would not be used in the printing process.


You could try choosing brighter colors.

Hi Berk.

I forgot that I could use paraview.uservoice for suggesting 
improvements. I have posted this new idea :

"Improve the Tecplot reader both for Structured and Unstructured grids"

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF and non standard topology
Message-ID: <1345711403.41139.YahooMailNeo@web160502.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I'm working with an unstructured triangular mesh and the elements which are forming the mesh are not a paraview standard (small triangles are contained inside each element--elements are triangles too). I 
created a XDMF file where i've put in a collection all my elements (for the triangles inside each element i used a standard triangle topology). I have two questions:

1) Is there any other way to do this, because paraview takes a lot of time to load this one?

2) It is possible to create a link from a XDMF file to a line or a column of a matrix found in a HDF5 file?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

Adrian

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Numpy masking (via programm filter) not quite working in parallel
 
Hello,

I have done some work in VTK towards that. Currently, this works only
with structured data.

If your data is structured, you can use vtkPStructuredGridConnectivity
to generate a bitmask (an unsigned char associated with each mesh
node). The bitmask can then be queried using the vtkGhostArray (See
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGhostArray.html) to see
which properties are "turned on" for the given mesh node. If the
IGNORE property is ON, that means that the node is a duplicate with
respect to the given process and should not be taken into account. The
implementation assigns ownership to the lowest rank of a mesh node --
on all other processes, the IGNORE property is set to ON.

TestPStructuredGridConnectivity illustrates how this can be used. The
test ensures that:
(1) Ensuring that the total number of nodes computed is invariant to
the number of processes/partitions
(2) Ensuring that computing the average for a given field is also
invariant to the numer of processes/partitions

If this could be useful in your work, I can elaborate more if you have
any questions on how to use it.

Best,
George

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that
looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is
that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download
ParaViewData (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git) and then set the
location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests

Two questions - is there a way to tell ctest where the ParaViewData is without having to go back into cmake and rebuilding? And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when running tests?

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

I also just noticed that ctest -R CoProcessing returns No tests were found!!!, yet it does have other tests.
Let me know what else you need.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.

So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test
doesn't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just
have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

Follow-up question to "Xdmf Polyvertex, Only First Half Visible":
How do you specify the bit width of integers in a binary file from 
within Xdmf? My script is writing a binary file with 64-bit unsigned 
integers and I think ParaView is interpreting it as 32-bit.

Thanks,
David

Hi Sohail,

Sorry for the slow reply but I wanted to make sure how things should work
first and that took a bit to figure out. Anyways, this is closer to what's
needed but the way it is supposed to work in VTK is that we use
vtkObjectFactory to determine which one should be created when
vtkWindBladeReader::New() is called. This is done at build time based on
whether or not VTK is built with MPI. So if VTK and ParaView are built in
parallel then there is code added that creates a vtkPWindBladeReader when
vtkWindBladeReader::New() is called. This is regardless of whether or not
the executable is run with mpi initialized or not. Because of this, the
parallel version of the reader is responsible for checking whether mpi is
initialized, ideally by doing
vtkMultiProcessController::GetGlobalController()->IsA("vtkMPIController")
is true, and if it isn't it should just call the parent class's methods for
reading in the files. You may want to look at vtkPNrrdReader and the
CMakeLists.txt file in that directory to see how they did things. Note
though that if it's a single process running that it doesn't do any MPI
calls even in the parallel version so your code will be slightly different
than theirs.

As for other parts of the email below:

1) yes, please keep cc'ing the list as there are some details in here that
will be helpful to other people trying to implement their own parallel
readers or filters

2) I'm not sure what's going on with the gradient filter but am guessing
that it has to do with the multiblock data set and that there probably
isn't that same array in each block. But that's just a guess. Did you try
extracting the "air" block and do the vorticity and/or q criterion
computation on that?

3) vtkSMReaderFactory may be the class you're looking for to determine
which reader is getting used. ParaViewReaders.xml has a list of readers
that it will try to read in a file.

Steve,
I am pretty sure that functionality was lost a few years ago when we went to PV 3.0.  Please write up a feature request?

Thanks,

Alan

I see the icon "reset center." I want to reset the center from 0,0,0 to 0,0,10.
What are the steps to reset the center?
Thanks,
Stephen
p.s.
Must I reset the center before making a slice?

Message-ID: <CALP4Zfib3aQJanaoY-9f7OZpPj5CRGqAYwGPbAy2xGKNvZpNTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I started a ParaView server using:
./pvserver.exe testheadtracking.pvx

And a client using:
./paraview.exe    (Then I successfully connected the client to the server
using the ParaView UI)

The render server window (titled "Visualization Toolkit - Win32OpenGL #1"
is frozen, and I could not see what is rendered in that window. I attached
the pvx file (even though it is called testheadtracking.pvx, I have not
started the VR Plugin).

Is this due to the fact that I am connected to the client and server via
remote desktop?

Thanks.

Are u seeing a solid colored box instead of the render window? (I
forget what color it used to be, green or blue or something like
that). If so, yes, that an issue when using remote-desktop. When using
remote desktop, Windows switches to using a sotware OpenGL driver
which doesn't support non-power of two textures which causes the issue
-- since ParaView pastes the server-side image back on the screen as a
texture.

Hi Utkarsh,

It looks like there is a problem in the order of loading internal
proxies (vtkPVInitializerPlugin?) and user plugins. I get the
aforementioned crash when I auto-load the plugin under (application
dir)/plugins but do not when I load manually from the Plugin Manager.

The problem affects not only my tricky plugin but also user plugins
that inherit internal proxies by base_proxyname="..." or <Extension
/>. Try ParaView/Examples/Plugins/Representation of the git-master. It
works (I can choose the "Special Mapper" representation for a
polygonal dataset) if manually loaded, but if auto-loaded it complains
vtkSIProxyDefinitionManager (0x119f75690): Extension for (representations, GeometryRepresentation) ignored since could not find core definition.

If I am not mistaken there has been changes like the removal of
vtkParaViewIncludeModulesToSMApplication and the introduction of
vtkPVInitializerPlugin mechanism after 3.14.1 so I think my
observation could be consistent with the internal change.

Kevin,

Fixes for the python tests have gone into paraview master today. We
should see the failures go down a bit by tommorrow -- fingers crossed.

I'll rerun the script now just to check.

Addendum: you have to put the representation plugin under
PV_PLUGIN_PATH to auto-load. Strangely, if I check "Auto Load" in the
Plugin Mnager to auto-load, the problem does not reproduce.

Ah! I cannot tell how much I abhor PV_PLUGIN_PATH. I wonder how many
people will scream if I took out support for it :/. I'll see if I can
cleanup the PV_PLUGIN_PATH init stuff while I am at it.

Subject: [Paraview] Trying to get sensible axes
Message-ID: <CAFGJzKdgjm4dDObs0Go4Yay1ixm3C3dU0hvCcxhxd=eSEhgHqA@mail.gmail.com>

G'day Paraview list!
I am using paraview 3.14 to read in some gridded netCDF files I have
created that -semi- conforms to the CF conventions (there are still radar
variables that need to be added)

I can read in and do all kinds of nice things.... but now I am getting
picky :)

The reader seems to ignore my X,Y and height axes (or lat/lon)

Is my metadata wrong? (see attached header) what variable (or standard name
or metadata attribute) does paraview look for... Main thing I want is nice
looking cube axes..
Any advice gratefully recieved..

Different results for ViewSize when running on remote station.

See my test.py script.  If I run that on a localhost, then the image gets
made the correct size.  If I run this on a remote station (of exactly the
same spec and after setting the DISPLAY) I get a different size screenshot,
even though the image size is correct.

I think this build :

http://open.cdash.org/buildSummary.php?buildid=2531668

should be more or less what will happen tonight.

Subject: [Paraview]  Lighting
Message-ID: <CAFFYk1VxFpbWVj0a5Bmeo=quWxwPDeuVGhne-udFv2pVpv=xKg@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to renders pictures of a geometry in batch.

However, when I play with the following view.BackLightAzimuth and
view.BackLightElevation, the light on the object does not move.

When I do these commands in the pyhton shell and then renders it works.

This is the part of the script where I set up the picture:

view = GetRenderView()
view.CameraParallelProjection = 1
view.CameraPosition = [1.58, 0, 10]
view.CameraFocalPoint = [1.58, 0, 0]
view.CameraViewUp = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
view.CameraParallelScale = 1.66
view.CenterAxesVisibility = 0
view.BackLightAzimuth = 0
view.BackLightElevation = 45
view.Background = [1,1,1]
view.ViewSize = [1700, 900]
Render()
WriteImage("test.png")

some more fixes through the week.

I think by default the "light kit" is off in pvbatch. The GUI turns it
on, and hence its enabled for you in Python shell. try setting

> view.LightSwitch =0 # turns of default front light

Hi Utkarsh

The window has the blue/gray background that is the default background
color in ParaView. Your explanation makes sense.

Thanks!

this should get in once he comes back. Thanks

Two questions - is there a way to tell ctest where the ParaViewData is without having to go back into cmake and rebuilding?

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when running tests?

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Andy,

I set PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON to ON, is more needed? It did build pvpython, I don't know if that's separate thing entirely, though.
$ pvserver -version
paraview version 3.14.1-1549-g5f34f40

$ python -version
Python 2.6.6

$ cmake -version
cmake version 2.8.9

CMakeCache.txt is attached.

I also just noticed that ctest -R CoProcessing returns No tests were found!!!, yet it does have other tests.
Let me know what else you need.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.

Hello,

I'm setting up someone's code to use coprocessing with OSMesa and openmpi/pgi/cuda fortran on NCSA's Forge using ParaView from the git repo. I'm getting segfaults and pgdbg gives me this error when coprocessorinitialize is called:

[0] Signalled SIGSEGV at 0x2B62188CFD9A, function vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor(), file /usr/apps/vis/ParaView/repo/ParaView/CoProcessing/CoProcessor/vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx, line 136
0x2B62188CFD9A:  48 8B 41 38            movq   56(%rcx),%rax

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()
{
  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline.cxx
coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Thanks,
Mark

Scott,

It's been a while since I've really looked at the CF convention, so apologies if I say something that is not quite right.

It looks like you have not specified your coordinate variables correctly.  You have variables lat, lon, x_disp, y_disp, and z_disp that look like they are supposed to be coordinate variables, but they are not according the CF convention.  A coordinate variable must have the exact same name as the dimension it describes.  Assuming you like the dimension names nx, ny, and nz, you will need to change your coordinate variables to be named nx, ny, and nz also.  (Personally, I would name the dimensions lat, lon, and height for clarity.)

It also looks like you are trying to simultaneously define Cartesian and spherical coordinates.  As far as I know, you cannot do that in the CF convention.  If it were me, I would define them as spherical coordinates (with lat/lon) and use the "Spherical Coordinates" checkbox of the ParaView reader to toggle between the two.

Hope that helps.

-Ken

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Trying to get sensible axes

G'day Paraview list!
I am using paraview 3.14 to read in some gridded netCDF files I have created that -semi- conforms to the CF conventions (there are still radar variables that need to be added)

I can read in and do all kinds of nice things.... but now I am getting picky :)

The reader seems to ignore my X,Y and height axes (or lat/lon)

Is my metadata wrong? (see attached header) what variable (or standard name or metadata attribute) does paraview look for... Main thing I want is nice looking cube axes..
Any advice gratefully recieved..

Subject: [Paraview] error while loading and animation of vtk files
Message-ID: <CAFB7znHENyvCUTE=QvDH97CSeqqZYs_NEcK6B-FKsidvv+OvRg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear paraview users,

i have a small problem,

i am trying to visualize the atoms in paraview, i converted a set of lammps
dump file to .vtk format.
if i chose some individual file it works (it shows the atoms)

when i load all the files, while doing animation it closes the paraview
abruptly.

the vtk files are attached with this mail
if i read last file lammps25.vtk it shows the atoms
if i read lammps0.vtk file and press apply the paraview GUI disappears.

what might be the reason?

i am not getting where it is going wrong.
could anyone help me, please.

Thanking you
Naveen

Message-ID: <CAFFYk1WftOkVDtFnozWq_tGQrvNz9CN0Eo7jEG5VZ8kWqYB=XA@mail.gmail.com>

Different results for ViewSize when running on remote station.

See my test.py script.  If I run that on a localhost, then the image gets
made the correct size.  If I run this on a remote station (of exactly the
same spec and after setting the DISPLAY) I get a different size screenshot,
even though the image size is correct.

Subject: [Paraview] Make array calculator operate on field data AND Field
 data is not maintained after some filters
Message-ID: <503B524C.8060100@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

I work mainly with XDMF files in ParaView in a daily bases, and I 
normally add some field data to store global data (like material 
properties or extra model parameters).

The problem:
1) Some filters like the 3D filter do not pass the field data to the output.
2) I need to calculate some quantities using the field data and point 
data, so I need to have access to that data in the calculator.

I patched my version of ParaView (3.14 Linux 64) and put the code in the 
bug tracker 6 months ago, but nobody seems to care about it.

Please can someone look at the patches and tell me if is the good 
approach. And eventually commit the patches to the ParaView repository.

solution for 1)

solution for 2)

Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Paraview] Unlink a property from a GUI widget on a reader panel
Message-ID: <20120827.233506.01383245.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I have a checkbox on my custom reader panel which is automatically
generated in connection with an IntVector boolean domain property from
the SM XML proxy definition, which is set to immediate_update. 

In order for checking/unchecking the checkbox to take effect in the
server side immediately without turning the Apply button to green, In
addition to setting the immediate_update attribute I unlink the
default property link and setup/take care of an alternative link by

  pqNamedWidgets::unlinkObject(regionNames, pqSMProxy(this->proxy()),
      "ShowRegionNames", this->propertyManager());
  this->Implementation->Links.addPropertyLink(regionNames, "checked",
      SIGNAL(toggled(bool)), this->proxy(), showRegionNames);
  this->Implementation->VTKConnect->Connect(showRegionNames,
      vtkCommand::ModifiedEvent, this, SLOT(onShowRegionNamesModified()));

where regonNames is the QCheckBox and showRegionNames is the
vtkSMIntVectorProperty. This has worked well with PV 3.14.1 and
earlier versions, but with the git-master the Apply button turns to
green when the checkbox is clicked. Is there a way to immediately push
the property to the server without changing the Apply button state for
the git-master?

Just as a side note, I tested commit
3bb4f74eff3f0670df5bef12c1e29b77b394a963 (Fix auto-apply with the new
properties panel) from the next branch but it did not help (unless
turning on Auto Accept in the general setting).

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were
temporarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel
runs but gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for
you to update your version of ParaView and retry this?

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were temporarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs but gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to update your version of ParaView and retry this?

Thanks,
Andy

Two questions - is there a way to tell ctest where the ParaViewData is without having to go back into cmake and rebuilding?

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when running tests?

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()
{
  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline.cxx
coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

I see...so if MPI is running then it will create a parallel version of the
class. Otherwise, it will create the normal reader.

As far as the check goes for a multiprocess controller; while it does call
the parent request data in the serial case, the inherited parallel class
overrides some of the methods.  Which is a problem because it refers to its
own file pointer in those methods (it uses MPI_File instead of a FILE*).
Hmm.

Technically, if ParaView is built with MPI enabled it will create the
parallel version of the class every time whether or not the client, server,
or python scripts are actually run with mpiexec, mpirun, or whatever is
used to start the executable. So you can't rely on MPI being initialized
and should not initialize it yourself in your class as that can cause
problems as well. I think that's what you meant but wanted to be as clear
as possible for the implications for the classes.

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph filters mask-points option only shows half side
	with vectors
Message-ID: <503C9665.4060308@ufz.de>

Hello,

I have got a problem with the behavior of the glyphs filter. I try to 
explain my approach and the problem:

- I calculated with the calculator filter: U*iHat + V*jHat
- After that I added the glyph filter
- If the "mask points" checkbox is NOT selected, all vectors are pictured
- If I select the checkbox "mask points", only half of the vectors are 
pictured
--> If I use the X+/- view it seams like only the vectors under the 
Y-axis or very close to it are shown
--> If I use the Y+/- view it seams like only the vectors under the 
X-axis or very close to it are shown

Does somebody know why there are only half of the vectors are shown if I 
use the "mask points" option?

Greetings,
Carolin.

Please attach screen shots.

What is the setting of "Maximum Number Of Points", what is the setting
of "Random Mode" and how many points does the Information tab say
there are in your data?

Hi Burlen,

Could you try the panels with the newest ParaView from git?

The display button should move to the bottom if it is collapsed and
the properties section is filled up with widgets.

Hi Kyle, It's looking great, and working well. I like your new design a lot.

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a
bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any
problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.
What version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to
simplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+Python
myself.

MPI is only used if it's available. It tries to see if there is a
MPIController available.  If not, then the number of ranks is 1, which
means that the parallel class calls the super class's requestdata (super
class is the serial wind blade reader).

However, the parallel class overrides certain functions to make use of MPI.
So even the parallel instantiation will call the superclass's requestdata,
the overriden functions that are called from that point on assume that MPI
is available...this is a problem when the MPI controller is not available.

On another note, it appears that the rectilinear grid that I am reading
(VTK file, structured points I think) is read by the vtkFileSeriesReader,
which makes use of the vtkPDataSetReader class.  Strange that if I use
vtkPDataSetReader myself in C++ code that uses VTK and not paraview,
bounds/cell information is not generated. So I think that ParaView does
something else besides using that reader...hmmm.

Well I guess it's not a problem in the derived functions if I check to see
if MPI is available; if not, call the superclass's version of the virtual
function.

As far as the gradient filter is concerned: I pick the UVW array in the
GUI.  It does compute a gradient, but only for one array -- "A-Scale
turbulence" (all variables are loaded).  So picking a different array in
the GUI doesn't seem to make a difference as it keeps computing gradient
for that one input (point data) array.  That's why it can't compute
vorticity or q-criterion because a-scale turbulence is a 1-component array.

Might be because I'm using an older version of the repo from late July.

[mvanmoer at forge ParaView]$ git log origin/master | head -1
commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/openmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors. That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I could try gcc/openmpi and see if that linked to pgi/openmpi will run.

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to simplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+Python myself.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were temporarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs but gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to update your version of ParaView and retry this?

Thanks,
Andy

Two questions - is there a way to tell ctest where the ParaViewData is without having to go back into cmake and rebuilding?

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when running tests?

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Andy,

I set PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON to ON, is more needed? It did build pvpython, I don't know if that's separate thing entirely, though.
$ pvserver -version
paraview version 3.14.1-1549-g5f34f40

$ python -version
Python 2.6.6

$ cmake -version
cmake version 2.8.9

CMakeCache.txt is attached.

I also just noticed that ctest -R CoProcessing returns No tests were found!!!, yet it does have other tests.
Let me know what else you need.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.

Hello,

I'm setting up someone's code to use coprocessing with OSMesa and openmpi/pgi/cuda fortran on NCSA's Forge using ParaView from the git repo. I'm getting segfaults and pgdbg gives me this error when coprocessorinitialize is called:

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()

  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline.cxx
coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with visibility of 3D Widgets when switching
	between views
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQvNVnR1_2oRShkKr8oJRpewruATE7mc41wWCj4iMLLg0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

I have problems with visibility of 3D widgets when I have several
views opened in one ParaView Qt client and I switch between them. I
experience this behavior on both Windows and Linux. Here is how to
reproduce it:

0) Start ParaView Qt client,
1) Create Sphere source and press Apply button,
2) Create Slice filter, turn off Show Plane option and press Apply button,
3) Create new layout item by pushing '+' and select Spreadsheet View,
4) Go on Render View by pressing Layout 1 item,
5) Export 3D scene from currently active render view to VRML file
(File->Export),
6) Reopen ParaView Qt client and load previously exported VRML file.

Looks like VRML exporter exports 3D widget's geometry and topology
too, although its turned off. This also occurs with other sources /
filters with 3D widgets (PointSource, Clip, etc.).

Can someone suggest how I could fix this bug, by changing exporter's
or ParaView's sources, or at least approximate place in sources where
I could take a look for a bug?

Thanks,
Nenad.

Nenad,

vtkVRMLExporter will be the starting point where I'd start digging in.
I am guessing somewhere where it iterates over all actors it's not
checking for visibility of 3D widgets or something.

Dear Utkarsh,

Thank You very much for Your response.

It checks actor's visibility at vtkVRMLExporter.cxx Ln 262, but actors
are visible because of some reasons. I'm sorry, looks like the problem
is much deeper. I tried even by playing from pvpython by executing:

active_objects.source.SMProxy.InvokeEvent('UserEvent', 'ShowWidget')
active_objects.source.SMProxy.InvokeEvent('UserEvent', 'HideWidget')

but it didn't work. I also experimented by counting number of actors
in interactive renderer object. After switching between views, it
contains ~13 actors, while after manually turning on and off widget's
visibility in Display panel it has ~9 (in this state exporter exports
correct scene - without 3d widgets). So, only way to "refresh" data in
current view is to manually turn ON and after it to turn OFF check box
on Display panel, which controls widget's visibility.

Btw, I have much more sophisticated exporter plugin and in which I
have the same problem. It works in similar way as VRMLExporter, so I
reported this with VRMLExporter test-case.

Thanks,
Nenad.

Sebastien may have some insight here since they do something similar
for the WebGL exporter. He's on vacation this week, but I can ping him
once he gets back.

Message-ID: <41DF703F-9B23-4C7E-84F3-83EFC222E952@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm planning to add custom tools for ParaView.
My first plan is:
 - Add a button (with graphical icon) on Toolbars' space.
 - The function is changing camera's position, focal point and reset zoom.

I'm not so familiar with developing plugins.
Are there any informations or sample codes to do it?

# I tried "Add new macro" with a Python script of camera motion,
# but the insufficiency is the button's appearance.

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to
figure out how to get it running properly with your desired configuration.
Unfortunately at this point I don't know how to move forward except for
trying to piecemeal from having it working with GCC without everything you
need to working with PGI, CUDA and everything else.

Subject: [Paraview] help about paraview macro
Message-ID: <CAHrmR1XrkTW12qaoxjMjNKoe0aCvFD9BRjB8wavC=v0nWpAj4g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:

My data has some vector properties and I would like to see them in
several tabs.
I would like to record a macro so I do not need to do this every time.
I use the tools->start trace to record the macro, i did like this:
I load in a dataset, then I open a tab, and add glyph1 for the vector
attribute 1,
and set some properties for it; then I open second tab, and add glyph2
for the vector attribute 2
then I open third tab and add glyph3 for vector attribute 3.
After this is done, I click stop trace and save it as a *.py file.
I load the macro into paraview by add a new macro.

Then I load a new dataset, and try to use the macro.
I found that I can not generate 3 independent tabs for the three glyphs views,
instead I get one tab and with 3 view windows.

I just wonder how to generate tabs in the macro actions?

regards,
Alex

Just to add to this, if I run this on a remote station, setting the DISPLAY
to my station, the image is fine.

Any help would be appreciated.

Dear Utkarsh,

Thank You very much for Your help. I hope Sebastien will have some idea.

Btw, in a meantime, I discovered one interesting detail. If I set
pipeline source (with widget) as currently active source
(SetActiveSource(...) in pvpython) before I execute code I mentioned
in first message (btw, it should be my_source.SMProxy.InvokeEvent() x
2, instead of active_objects.source.SMProxy.InvokeEvent() x 2 in first
message), everything will work OK. Of course, all this happens after I
switch between different views. Looks like there are some resetting in
pipeline when user switches between views.

Best regards,
Nenad.

Hi Andy,
Not sure what changed, but I was able to build pgi/openmpi and got to the point you did below, where the parallel test fails with "CPGrid0 image compare failed."
Can I ignore this error? Anyway, the python interpreter seems to be created, so that issue is closed.

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figure out how to get it running properly with your desired configuration. Unfortunately at this point I don't know how to move forward except for trying to piecemeal from having it working with GCC without everything you need to working with PGI, CUDA and everything else.

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/openmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors. That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I could try gcc/openmpi and see if that linked to pgi/openmpi will run.

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to simplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+Python myself.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were temporarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs but gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to update your version of ParaView and retry this?

Thanks,
Andy

Two questions - is there a way to tell ctest where the ParaViewData is without having to go back into cmake and rebuilding?

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when running tests?

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Andy,

I set PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON to ON, is more needed? It did build pvpython, I don't know if that's separate thing entirely, though.
$ pvserver -version
paraview version 3.14.1-1549-g5f34f40

$ python -version
Python 2.6.6

$ cmake -version
cmake version 2.8.9

CMakeCache.txt is attached.

I also just noticed that ctest -R CoProcessing returns No tests were found!!!, yet it does have other tests.
Let me know what else you need.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.

Hello,

I'm setting up someone's code to use coprocessing with OSMesa and openmpi/pgi/cuda fortran on NCSA's Forge using ParaView from the git repo. I'm getting segfaults and pgdbg gives me this error when coprocessorinitialize is called:

0x2B62188CFD9A:  48 8B 41 38            movq   56(%rcx),%rax

which is:
vtkPVPythonInterpretor* vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor()
{
  return Instance->PythonInterpretor;
}

The call stack is
vtkCPPythonHelper::GetPythonInterpretor() line 136 in vtkCPPythonHelper.cxx
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize(const char *) line 69 in vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline.cxx
coprocessorinitialize_ line 88 in FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx


So is an Instance not getting created? I have the system python in my path.

Thanks,
Mark

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think
you can ignore that for now. I need to fix it but I just haven't gotten
around to it yet. I think it's either a parallel rendering/compositing
issue or a problem with the actors's visibility in the views getting
screwed up. Both of those things are not my area of expertise so I've been
reluctant to go and fix it. Now that you've publicly shamed me I'm going to
have to bite the bullet and fix it :)  Hopefully by the end of next week it
will be fixed. I created a mantis issue (
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13417) if you want to follow it.

Subject: [Paraview] remove mesh partition
Message-ID: <5040CDA6.6060400@bsc.es>

Hi everybody

The output of my parallel cfd code is in Hdf5 and Xdmf.
My problem is that paraview displays the mesh partitions.
I want to remove it to just see the computation domain.
I put a picture, it is better to understand my problem.
the computational domain is a cube and I use 3 processors (so 2 slaves 
-> 2 partitions)

There is a solution with paraview to remove the mesh partition ?
like a filter ?
or I have to modify the hdf5 implementation ?

thank you very much

Hi Hadrien,

Does your output consist of partition(zone) connectivity information
or any information about nodes that are on internal boundaries?
If the simulation can write out an additional mask array to indicate
the nodes on the internal boundaries, then you could use threshold
within ParaView to remove internal boundaries.

Best,
George

Ok, attached is the newest Wind blade reader.  It makes no calls to MPI in
the constructor; only in request data or functions related to the parallel
version of wind blade reader.

I also have the change related to the vtkObjectFactory in there.  Like the
vtkPNrrdReader, the object factory code is in the base (serial) class --
the parallel class just has the standard new macro. As  I said below, I
think the problem with the gradient filter might be related with the
gradient filter I'm using (which is from the master repo from late July).

It reads in serial and parallel. If it works for your tests we'll have to
modify the xml file so that it is enabled for serial.  There are also some
commented (old) code sections; once you guys approve of the class I can
delete the pieces of commented code.

In regards to locations of the classes: I have the vtkPWind* sitting in
VTK/Parallel/MPI and vtkWind* files sitting in VTK/IO/Geometry.  I realize
that the parallel version should be elsewhere; I just placed it in inside
of VTK/Parallel/MPI for testing purposes.

For the parallel version, I added vtkPWindBladeReader.cxx to the
corresponding CMakeLists.txt file (Module_SRCS section) in the
VTK/Parallel/MPI directory.  I also added these lines to the file:
# Now to generate our object factory.
set( vtk_module_overrides
  WindBladeReader
  )

I did something similar for the vtkWindBladeReader for its corresponding
CMakeLists.txt file in VTK/IO/Geometry but did not added any lines related
to vtk_module_overrides.

Thanks for the files. I think the best place to put the reader files would
be for VTK/IO/Geometry for vtkWindBladeReader and make a new directory
ParallelMPI to put the vtkPWindBladeReader in. If you want to get this into
VTK and ParaView faster I would suggest that you push your VTK branch to
gerrit and then I can do a review. Otherwise it will probably have to wait
2 or 3 weeks before I can get to it. If you do push it to gerrit for review
you can add me as a reviewer.

Message-ID: <6289DC22EA162C41A962AF42ACB7E737233CE9E0@SN2PRD0106MB176.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hello,

I am trying to control renderings with a WiiMote instead of a mouse using Pat Marion's ParaViewSocketPlugin to send commands  to ParaView's python shell (see attached .py file) and running into an issue. When trying to manipulate 20MB of point cloud data, ParaView severely lags behind after sending commands and I was able to narrow it down to the 'Render()' call. My current fix has been to only call 'Render()' every third iteration of commands I send but this doesn't necessarily solve the issue as I plan on moving to GB sized data.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to what I can do to speed up rendering through the python shell, or another way of manipulating the render data from an external program?

Some extra information:

1.       I am running ParaView 3.14.1 64bit from source on Ubuntu 12.04

2.       Quickly rotating 15MB of point-data with the mouse peaks my CPU at about 53%. With my Wiimote application, this is just a little higher at 55% (rendering on every command).

3.       WiiMotes poll slower than most computer mice at 100Hz. So I'm pretty sure not sending commands any faster than a mouse would.

4.       Python commands are based on the python examples included with ParaView 3.14.1. They were designed to work as closely as possible to what C++ Trackball commands do. (This was my first time working with python or visualization manipulation so any advice on general improvements to the commands would be greatly appreciated too!)

5.       The Wii application works by utilizing the Nunchuk. Button combinations determine what type of manipulation (Panning, Zoom, Rotate, and Spin) and then it converts the magnitude and angle of the joystick into x-y coordinates.

I have tried to include all the information that I thought would be relevant but if there is anything else that you would like to know, I'd be more than happy to provide it.

Thanks,

Travis J. Bueter

Cool stuff! The performance problem makes me think that ParaView is not
using display lists. Is Immediate Mode Rendering off? (it should be). When
you get to GB size data, there will have to be some LOD involved. No
graphics card can render that many points at interactive rates.

This is pretty cool!! Would it be possible to create a video of your
interactions? Just to be sure, so are you saying that when you interact
with mouse, the performance is much better than when you use wiimote? If
performance is bad with both devices then it could be what Berk said. If
one is better than another then there is something else is going on.

Thanks,

So quickly looking into the code, you have Render() call at the end of each
transformations. Can't you combine them into single call, meaning that you
can perform all sort of transformations and then call Render() at the end?

Immediate Mode Rendering is off but I can't seem to utilize the LOD. I have it set and it clearly works when I use the mouse but the effects are not present when I use the WiiMote. I've yet to figure out how to get it to work with my application by using python.

When trying to manipulate 20MB of point cloud data, ParaView severely lags behind after sending commands and I was able to narrow it down to the 'Render()' call. My current fix has been to only call 'Render()' every third iteration of commands I send but this doesn't necessarily solve the issue as I plan on moving to GB sized data.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to what I can do to speed up rendering through the python shell, or another way of manipulating the render data from an external program?

Some extra information:

1.       I am running ParaView 3.14.1 64bit from source on Ubuntu 12.04

2.       Quickly rotating 15MB of point-data with the mouse peaks my CPU at about 53%. With my Wiimote application, this is just a little higher at 55% (rendering on every command).

3.       WiiMotes poll slower than most computer mice at 100Hz. So I'm pretty sure not sending commands any faster than a mouse would.

4.       Python commands are based on the python examples included with ParaView 3.14.1. They were designed to work as closely as possible to what C++ Trackball commands do. (This was my first time working with python or visualization manipulation so any advice on general improvements to the commands would be greatly appreciated too!)

5.       The Wii application works by utilizing the Nunchuk. Button combinations determine what type of manipulation (Panning, Zoom, Rotate, and Spin) and then it converts the magnitude and angle of the joystick into x-y coordinates.

I have tried to include all the information that I thought would be relevant but if there is anything else that you would like to know, I'd be more than happy to provide it.

Thanks,

Travis J. Bueter

Travis has already left for the weekend so I'll take over Q&A for what I 
know.

1) A video is probably possible but I'll want to okay with boss-man first.
2) Performance is significantly worse when using the Wii nunchuck. We 
can render a simple 15 MB point cloud on our dual-core laptops with 256 
MB Quardo NVS 160M and manipulate it with a mouse, but our head node 
lags very badly despite its quad-core CPU and 2 GB Quadro 5000 if using 
the Wii's nunchuck.

Cheers,
David

I would be happy to post a video, but I wouldn't be able to make and then post it until later next week. For very small data (such as a simple sphere), the WiiMote performs with only the slightest bit of lag in comparison to the mouse. But as the data gets larger, the lag increases linearly with the size.

This is pretty cool!! Would it be possible to create a video of your interactions? Just to be sure, so are you saying that when you interact with mouse, the performance is much better than when you use wiimote? If performance is bad with both devices then it could be what Berk said. If one is better than another then there is something else is going on.

Thanks,

Try using renView.InteractiveRender() instead of calling Render()
directly. That should kick in the LOD if you're getting LOD when
interacting with mouse.
