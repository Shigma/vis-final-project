Dear group,

I have seen some notes about plans to include feature extraction into
Paraview (http://www.paraview.org/paraview/project/News.html#feature).
Can anybody give me some details about plans and schedules? I am very
interested in that. Thanks.

- I have added the lines in both server and client machine.
- make clean and then compiled with DEBUG
- error is gone
- make clean and compile with RELEASE (-O3 -march=native) error is gone
I did the former tests from the compile dir

then I've done make install to the install dir and the error is gone

- Then I did a fresh cvs update and compiled it in the server machine and 
in a client machine and it's all ok

So, I'm baffled and don't understand why but everyting seems to be working 
ok.

  thanks for your trouble

Subject: [Paraview] CellDataToPointData in paraview script
Message-ID: <49ABAFBA.4030106@sirehna.com>

Hello,

I'm starting to use paraview in script mode using pvpython.

I succeeded to load my data and to make a representation of my U 
CellData fields using a Cut() filters.
This works fine.

But now I would like to have the magnitude of my U field for PointData 
and I'm stuck in the use of CellDataToPointData filter.
The following script only give me a blank field for my Cut() when 
passing trough the CellDataToPointData filter.

Surely I forgot something (interpolation, choice of component of field), 
but even by looking at the dir() and help() I didn't manage to have my 
field interpolated at points and represented in colors.

Thanks for anyone who could give me hints to solve this problem.

python script :

con = servermanager.Connect()
vtkf = 
servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader(FileNames="VTK\\design71_1.vtk")
vtkf.UpdatePipeline()

implicit_functions = servermanager.createModule("implicit_functions")
plane = implicit_functions.Plane()
plane.Origin = [0,0,-0.5]
plane.Normal = [0,0,1]

zcut = servermanager.filters.Cut()
zcut.Input = vtkf
zcut.CutFunction = plane
zcut.ContourValues = [0]
zcut.UpdatePipeline()

pdata = servermanager.filters.CellDataToPointData(Input=zcut)
pdata.UpdatePipeline()

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
view.ViewSize = [1440, 900]
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(pdata,view)

lt = servermanager.rendering.PVLookupTable()
rep.LookupTable = lt
rep.ColorAttributType = 0
rep.ColorArrayName = 'U'
lt.RGBPoints = [0, 0, 0, 1, 15.0, 1, 0, 0]
lt.ColorSpace = 1

view.ResetCamera()
camera = view.GetActiveCamera()
camera.SetPosition(0.85, 0, 8.55)
camera.SetFocalPoint(0.85, 0 , -0.5)

view.StillRender()
view.WriteImage("test.png","vtkPNGWriter", 1)

Message-ID: <967251.97470.qm@web32607.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi, 
I have got a data which I would like to display as ellipsoids of
different sizes and orientations. I was thinking about getting
ellipsoids as sphere glyphs scaled by components of the vector data,
but than I need to orient them according to another vector. However you
can specify only one vector for scaling and/or orienting the glyphs.
Does anybody know a way (or workaround) for doing this?
Thanks.

I suggest that you 'convert' one vector data into a scalar (e.g. over
the Calculator-filter, and by using the functions: mag(<vector>),
iHat.<vector>, jHat.<vector>, or kHat.<vector> (magnitude, X, Y, and Z
of a vector) for calculating the desired vector-parts).
Then change the 'Scale Mode', of the Glyph-filter, to 'scalar', and
select the calculation-result as scalar-field.

You can avoid the Qt dependency if you set PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI when
configuring with CMake.

This work is at a prototype stage right now. Assuming that we are
funded for the next phase, I'd expect we would have initial production
results in 2 years or so. We are also exploring other possibilities to
add feature extraction support to ParaView. I am sorry I can't be more
specific; everything is at the planning stage.

Message-ID: <24949.31430.qm@web32604.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Thanks for reply,
but I don't think it will work in my case. Maybe I wasn't specific enough about my data and it was confusing.
I have point data witch represent centers of ellipsoidal cells. With each point there are associated lengths of ellipsoid axes (e.g. as a vector data), which can be different for each ellipsoid, and directions of those axes in space (3 vectors). I want to display those ellipsoids oriented and in appropriate scale.
So I was thinking:  I need to scale spheres anisotropically to get ellipsoids so I really need to do it by scaling with vector components of the scales/axes_length vector. Scaling by scalars works isotropically so it won't help. Now I need to align axes of each ellipsoid in space. I probably need to do it by programmable filter, but I don't know how to operate on separate glyphs (ellipsoids) and their data. Did anyone have similar problem and solved it somehow?
Thanks.

Try VTK's vtkTensorGlyph
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkTensorGlyph.html filter.
You will have to write a plugin to let paraview use it. See

Hi,

I had a similar problem a while back.  Try applying the
CellDataToPointData filter before the cut filter.

Hope it works,
Peter.

**What you describe seems to be exactly what the vtkTensorGlyph does.
See details here
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkTensorGlyph.html

Tensor Glyphing is not in ParaView yet. But a ctest exist (if Python is
enabled)

 ./VTK/Graphics/Testing/Python/TenEllip.py

You can add Tensor Glyph yourself with a pluggin. Here are the XML
necessary. The CMakelists.txt is this:
############
/cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(ExtraSMPlugin "1.0"
                    SERVER_MANAGER_XML extras_Server.xml
                    )

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(ExtraGUIPlugin "1.0"
                    GUI_RESOURCES extras.qrc )/
#############

The file extras.qrc is this:

############
<RCC>
  <qresource prefix="/ParaViewResources" >
    <file>extras.xml</file>
  </qresource>
</RCC>
############

There is a complication. The data fields created by vtkTensorGlyph (and
vtkPointLoad) are not named. ParaView will not color them. You need to
add two lines of code in vtkTensorGlyph.cxx and vtkPointLoad.cxx
immediately after the declaration of
newNormals = vtkFloatArray::New();
newScalars = vtkFloatArray::New();
newTensors = vtkFloatArray::New();

newScalars->SetName("Scalars");
newNormals->SetName("Normals");
newTensors->SetName("Tensors");

hope it fits the bill. Caveat Emptor.

Message-ID: <EE35CDB51A4F8F40820C05C4D2EAF2B507D6B2@cf--amer001e--3.americas.sgi.com>

I am attemtping to build ParaView-3.4.0.  I follow the instructions on the
wiki and I am able to use cmake to configure and generate the makefiles.
 
When I run make, things go along fine until I get here:
 
Linking CXX executable ../../../../bin/DistributedData
 
 
Then I get a bunch of undefined MPI errors like:
 
/store/jmontine/projects/ParaView-bin/bin/libvtkParallel.a(vtkMPIController.o): In function `vtk
MPIController::Finalize(int)':
vtkMPIController.cxx:(.text+0x878): undefined reference to `MPI_Finalize'
/store/jmontine/projects/ParaView-bin/bin/libvtkParallel.a(vtkMPIController.o): In function `vtk

vtkMPIController.cxx:(.text+0x9fb): undefined reference to `MPI_Init'
vtkMPIController.cxx:(.text+0xa1a): undefined reference to `MPI_Get_processor_name'
 
I have tried both hpmpi and sgi's mpi with the same result.  I am using gcc for the compiling.
 
Thanks

It sounds like cmake wasn't able to tell where the MPI libraries are.
Open up ccmake, turn on the advanced options, and verify that the MPI
INCLUDE and LIBRARY and EXTRA_LIBRARY paths are correct.

Hi all,
Is the book geared to understand how to use paraview or understanding
the code. I am a imaging research developer but looking at the 2.6
million lines of code in 8820 files in the Visual Studio project that
contains the cvs paraview is not an easy task especially when there

The first 232 pages is about using paraview. The last 111 cover enough
about the architecture to get the reader started at extending
paraview. Topics covered include an overview of the code structure,
compilation and installation, the servermanager's proxy, property, and
domain structures, writing c++ plugins, python scripting, writing
readers and the client/server stream language.

Message-ID: <49AD955A.4030605@gmail.com>

How is it possible to change the opacity in the colormap for individual 
scalar values?  This would allow the surface to show through certain 
regions, for example, if the scalar values represented precipitation or 
clouds.
I DON'T want to change the global opacity of the surface with 
Display->Style->Opacity. Thanks,

Thanks for the idea, but I'm trying to avoid clipping or cutting the 
geometry.  What I'd like is to have smooth gradations of transparency.  
I also don't want an additional data processing step in the pipeline.  
For many years I've used this in standalone vtk-python scripts, etc. 
because it is possible, but the colormap editor gui seems crippled; I've 
even written my own colormap guis like that before.  I'm trying to get 
my users to gravitate towards Paraview as a uniform tool instead of 
various custom scripts.

Subject: [Paraview] Memory problem in Contour-Filter?
Message-ID: <877i361bqt.fsf@workstation006.office.ice-sf.at>


Hi!

I know that this is a bit like diagnosing a brain tumor using a
passport picture, but I'd be grateful about any help.

I'm currently using Paraview 3.4. Using a programmable source I
constructed a polyMesh (basically a number of particle trajectories). 

The trajectories are displayed alright, and work with most filters
(Tube, Slice etc) but when I apply the Contour-Filter it crashes (not
always but more often than not). The funny thing is that when I apply
the Clean-filter with large tolerances it works, but the problem is
that the result is so coarse that it doesn't resemble the
original. With finer tolerances the filter crashes again.

The traceback that I usually get (I added a clipped version below) leads
me to the conclusion that some memory is returned twice inside the
vtkContourFilter.

Answers that would help me would be:

- "That's an old one. It's already fixed one in the CVS" The point is
  I don't want to fuzz around with the CVS if there isn't a slim
  chance that it will work

- "Have you tried filter X to clean up the data" Using the
  Clean-filter produces unsatisfactory results

- "That's an interesting one. Could you send us the pvd/vtp-file, but
  we don't commit to fixing it" I've got a 3MB pvd from the filter
  that can reproduce the problem

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0903032130080.16599@alice.wonderland.caltech.edu>


I'd like to make movie comparing two datasets.  I've made a single dataset 
movie by exporting the frames from the 3D View, and then assembling them 
using ffmpeg.

Is it possible to export each frame from 2 3D Views to a single image?
Or perhaps there is a better way to go about this.

Thanks,
Keith

<said with a _lot_ of jest>
    Who wants to try out the just released Qt 4.5 with Cocoa 64 bit  
and ParaView 64 bit? Or maybe some already are trying it out? Any  
complaints or other issues building ParaView CVS against Qt 4.5?

I can thing of a couple of things to try.

First, show both data sets in the same view, use the transform filter
or the translation property on the display tab of one data set to
offset it from the other.
Second:

Second, split the view and make one data set visible in one side and
the other visible in the other. Link the cameras, then save the
animation. Both views are saved in the image files.

Third, try the comparative view. Make a 2x1 grid, with one data set in
the left and the other in the right. Use the animation inspector view
to animate time. Record the movie, the movie images will contain all
(both) grids.

Hey Pawel,

If you happen to be working from a binary version of ParaView, you  
should also be able to try it out by loading the XML that Jean  
provided with Tools->Manage Plugins/Extensions..., and then the issue  
of vtkTensorGlyphs not naming the arrays can be temporarily solved by  
adding a Python Programmable Filter after the Tensor Glyphs filter  
with a script like:

pdi = self.GetInput()
pdata = pdi.GetPointData()
pdata.GetScalars().SetName('Scalars')
pdata.GetNormals().SetName('Normals')
pdata.GetTensors().SetName('Tensors')
pdo = self.GetOutput()
pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)

I haven't tried any of this with vtkTensorGlyphs, but I used a similar  
method yesterday to try vtkImplicitModeller and compensate for the  
fact that this filter also does not name the output scalars.

Attached is a patch if you wanted to build it too.
It also needs cmake 2.6.3 if you want to build with Qt/Cocoa.
And when you configure Qt 4.5, add the "-cocoa" and "-arch x86_64" flags 
to configure.
The progress bar code in the patch isn't perfect yet.  I didn't have any 
more time to debug it.
Other than that, I didn't see any other issues.

I am confused. If you have 2 views open at the same time and try to
save the animation, aren't you getting both the views saved in  the
animation? I just tried saving an animation with two 3D-Views, the
resulting movie does indeed have both the views (attached is a frame
from the movie).

Thanks, I'll try to take a look at it.

Also reported issue http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=8671  
against the FindQt4.cmake file. Patch is attached to the bug.

Synopsis: The Carbon framework is being added to the link line when it  
should not when Qt4.5 built with Cocoa is found.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Paraview
Message-ID: <BAY122-W48BD4CBA39F991F21AF17ABCA70@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m not sure if I understood well how Paraview is working in parallel mode:
I have started Paraview in client/server mode, i.e. with 
mpirun -np 8 ./pvserver
and then I started the client and connected. 

I?m not sure how this works with filters: I?ve written a few filters, and when I run Paraview in parallel, is the filter parallelized as well, automatically? That on every piece of data the filter is applied separately and necessary data of other pieces is send there by mpi? Or is the filter computed on a single node and I have to change something in order to make it work parallel?
Applying the ProcessId-Filter on the output of my filter, it says that it was computed separately on every piece of dataset, I?m just wondering, because the filter uses the whole dataset to compute the desired output.. 

thx for explaining,
Natalie

Message-ID: <b0cfaac60903040734w2c554374pd29903a93f29aa79@mail.gmail.com>

Hi-

I'm trying to analyze data by looking at it an annotating it.  I'd like to
draw a box around anomalies and then write some information about it.

Is that possible to do?

Thanks,

Chris

In brief, the cells of the data are distributed amongst the processes, and each process runs your algorithm on its local piece.  Algorithms that perform per-cell or per-point operations usually work without any communication (assuming the request and receive any necessary ghost cells).

You can read more in Chapter 13 of the ParaView book or in the latest SC tutorial that is posted on the ParaView Wiki.

I didn't change that because qmake still adds the -framework Carbon 
compile flag for a Cocoa based Qt.  At least that's what I saw in the 
beta and rc1.
I'm not sure why it still does.

Slightly less briefly than what Ken said:

In parallel, the end of the pipeline on each processor is told to
process piece i out of j. Where i is the local processor's rank and j
is the number of processors. See
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::SetUpdatePiece() and
SetNumberOfPieces(). That information flows back through the pipeline
in the RequestUpdateExtent pass. Here each filter along the pipeline
looks as what it is asked to produce, and tells its inputs what they
need to produce for it to do that. In your case if the algorithm
requires the whole domain then filter is telling everything upstream
to give it everything, and parallelism is only effective AFTER your
filter. If the algorithm can be changed so that each processor needs
only a portion of the domain (perhaps using ghostlevels to extent the
boundaries a bit) then you will get better scalability. After
RequestUpdateExtent, the RequestData pass happens in which each filter
executes in turn. In this pass the filter's RequestData() method uses
the input it is given to fill out the previously agreed extent and
passes it onward.

Not all of Carbon.framework is deprecated, and much of it is available
in 64 bit too.  Maybe they need parts of it even for their Cocoa version?

Um.. well I just put in a bug report the removes the Carbon framework  
from linker flags in the FindQt4.cmake file. Wonder if that was really  
necessary. I just assumed that if I want a true 64 bit build then  
Carbon would hold me back on that.

I guess, how do we know if we get a true 64bit build of Qt4.5 and  
ParaView then? I guess if the compile succeeds that is the first step.

I don't actually have a 64 bit machine (yet) but hopefully by the end  
of the month I'll have one of those swanky Core i7 Xeons that just got  
release on tuesday.

You can use lipo -info.  See 'man lipo'.

The file command reports the architecture of binaries.  I had doubts 
myself partly because Carbon was still used and partly because 
everything compiled and looked the same as 32 bit Carbon, until I ran 
file to verify it really was 64 bit.  lipo can check that too, but I 
just remember commands that work on more platforms.

But anyways, what's most important is that QWidget maps to a Cocoa 
NSView and it does.

I'd like to see us move to Qt 4.5 with Cocoa support right after the
3.6 branch. Hopefully, you guys will figure it all out by then :-)

Subject: [Paraview] 1  Parallel Paraview
Message-ID: <cd4d09920903040951j55f9d80byd8f1d81e8f7e8520@mail.gmail.com>

When you work in parallel, paraview automatically subdivide your data in
many pieces according with the number of processors you have.
If not you need to do that yourself by using D3 filter by example. Each
processor has a copy of you code and work separately on the piece
of data he has. Paraview by IceT collect and diplay the output but the
result is still on each process.
If you want to have the result on the the root you can collect the data
yourself to the node0.
If anytime you want to see the different data each process has you can apply
ProcessId filter.

Arolde.



Hi!
I?m not sure if I understood well how Paraview is working in parallel mode:
I have started Paraview in client/server mode, i.e. with
mpirun -np 8 ./pvserver
and then I started the client and connected.

I?m not sure how this works with filters: I?ve written a few filters, and
when I run Paraview in parallel, is the filter parallelized as well,
automatically? That on every piece of data the filter is applied separately
and necessary data of other pieces is send there by mpi? Or is the filter
computed on a single node and I have to change something in order to make it
work parallel?
Applying the ProcessId-Filter on the output of my filter, it says that it
was computed separately on every piece of dataset, I?m just wondering,
because the filter uses the whole dataset to compute the desired output..

thx for explaining,
Natalie

Subject: [Paraview] Error while saving data
Message-ID: <BAY109-W3773D2C92ED24209AD6162B2A70@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I have a multiblock dataset, which I have sliced and put a SurfaceVectors so as to have a 2D vector field. I have checked that everything is fine by putting a StreamTracer and a Glyph generator but now I would like to save this 2D dataset.
What I have done is to select the SurfaceVectors object in the pipeline area, use File->Save Data and select VTK Ascii format and clic the save button.
But I get the following message:

  ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Filters/vtkCompleteArrays.cxx, line 138
vtkCompleteArrays (0x58eb3280): Could not create point array. The output will not contain points

  ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Filters/vtkCompleteArrays.cxx, line 138
vtkCompleteArrays (0x58eb3280): Could not create point array. The output will not contain points

I suspect selecting the SurfaceVectors object is not the good way to indicate to Paraview I want to save the sliced subset of the data so how should I proceed?

Second question : the bounding volume of the dataset has not changed after I have sliced it so I suspect the new - 2D - dataset will be have a 3D extend, so how to get a "real" 2D dataset, ie with dimensions like NxPx1?

Thanks in advance for your help.

You were correct, there was a problem with the MPI library setting.
 
I have been able to build (and run) pvserver using both openmpi and SGI's mpt library.

I think the specifics of configuring that varies dependent on the mpi library.

With some it is as simple as giving the name of the machines in the
right order as arguments on the command line to mpirun, with others it
involves making a hosts file where the first entry in the file is the
hostname that you want to be the rank 0 node and the rest are the
others, and I'm sure others make it much more complicated.

You should be able to test it out with a small mpi hello world from
uname, program, and once you get that working try it out with
pvserver.

I am trying to do a vector product with the Calculator, but this seems to
fail "Error deciding between ambiguous operators".
Is there a way to do vector products ? Or is this something that needs to be
implemented ?

Message-ID: <97d9bd670903041247p24275dfbnf25d81013a91479b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I got my application to write out each file for each block - the file is
written in .vts format and
in total i have 23 blocks = 23 files.  I then wrote a .pvts file to load
everything into Paraview.

Can I view this data as a multiblock data set ?

Another confusion I have is the difference between whole and piece extent.
At the moment, my whole
extent and piece extent is the same within a single vts file - but on the
pvts file, I define the whole extent
and define each source with the correct piece extent.  I think my data is
correctly being displayed by Paraview.

Can some one tell me why we have whole and piece extent within a single
*.vts file?

Thanks,

I don't know if this is correct, but I took a quick attempt at making a cross product.  I am using the dataset can.exo.  In the calculator, I am trying to create the cross of the DISP and ACCL vectors.  Here is the formula:

iHat*(DISPL_Y*VEL_Z+DISPL_Z*VEL_Y)+jHat*(DISPL_X*VEL_Z+DISPL_Z*VEL_X)+kHat*(DISPL_X*VEL_Y+DISPL_Y*VEL_X)

I am trying to do a vector product with the Calculator, but this seems to fail "Error deciding between ambiguous operators".
Is there a way to do vector products ? Or is this something that needs to be implemented ?

I forgot to ask the last time:
 
1. Does rank 0 do just as much work as the other ranks when it comes to computation or
does rank 0 worry mostly about coordinating things with the client and the other ranks do 
most of the computation.
 
2.  When remote rendering is enabled, what (if any ) compression is used when transmitting
images to the client.
 
 
Thanks

I think the specifics of configuring that varies dependent on the mpi library.

With some it is as simple as giving the name of the machines in the
right order as arguments on the command line to mpirun, with others it
involves making a hosts file where the first entry in the file is the
hostname that you want to be the rank 0 node and the rest are the
others, and I'm sure others make it much more complicated.

You should be able to test it out with a small mpi hello world from
uname, program, and once you get that working try it out with
pvserver.

Rank 0 does just as much work as the other ranks.

A compression algorithm called SQUIRT is used to transmit images to the client.  It is a specialized run-length encoding algorithm.  It is described in the paper "Remote Large Data Visualization in the ParaView Framework" that you can get from this link: http://www.cs.unm.edu/~kmorel/documents/EGPGV2006Paper.html

I don't know if this is correct, but I took a quick attempt at making a cross product.  I am using the dataset can.exo.  In the calculator, I am trying to create the cross of the DISP and ACCL vectors.  Here is the formula:

iHat*(DISPL_Y*VEL_Z+DISPL_Z*VEL_Y)+jHat*(DISPL_X*VEL_Z+DISPL_Z*VEL_X)+kHat*(DISPL_X*VEL_Y+DISPL_Y*VEL_X)

Is there a way to do vector products ? Or is this something that needs to be implemented ?

The + sighs between cross terms should be replaced by - signs as follows:

Thanks for the answer. I guess I missed the cross button ! (The whole point
was that I didn't want to write out the cross product anymore !! :)

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Timestep information
Message-ID: <d0767b160903042227l5d2b0427te05e0c48d4f81ff@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.
I am trying to visualize a beating heart using Paraview.
The files I need to read is a 4d dicom files. It contains several "groups"
of DICOM files. Each group of DICOM files has the same "Acquisition Time",
which means that this group of DICOM files represent the heart in a specific
time.
To make things easier to say, suppose that I have 10 groups of DICOM files.
The first group of DICOM files is the heart at time 0, the last group of
DICOM files is the heart at time 9. I need to read those files and animate
them from 0 to 9.
I know how to read one group of DICOM files into paraview. The question is I
am not sure how to read all the files into paraview with "time" information?
The time information will be used for animation by Paraview.
Anyone has done that before? Any comment and idea will be highly
appreciated.
Thanks very much for your time!

Aaron

Hi,

I forgot the "e" for ColorAttributeType (and not ColorAttributType)

stupid mistake.

thanks anyway

Thank you guys,

that's exactly what I need. I will try that next
week, as I have to deal with something else now. I am indeed using
binary version of ParaView so I will try this with plugin manager
first. I had some trouble building Paraview yesterday (something with
Qt), but I will try that too. Thanks to your detailed instructions I
should have no problem doing that. At least I am certain that it is not
a shortstoper.
Much obliged,
Pawel

Ok, thanks a lot, I believe I understand.. 

But that brings me to another question: 
I?m running paraview on 8 nodes, and my data is sliced into 8 pieces, which I can see when it?s rendering or with the ProcessId-Filter. In my case, its a cuboid and it?s divided into 8 pieces, sliced once in every layer. In order to make the parallelism useful for the algorithmus I implemented in my filters, I need to change the domain for every processor, i.e I want to slice the data into 8 pieces, but slicing it 7 times in the xy-layer. How can I achieve this, where are the domains for each processor specified?

thx a lot,
Natalie

Paraview will normally use an Extent Translator which will sub-divide in
each direction alternatively, as you have noticed.

You can override thsi default behavior with two lines of code in your
reader/filter. See further documentation for class vtkExtentTranslator
/
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline *exec =
static_cast<vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline*>(this->GetExecutive());
exec->GetExtentTranslator(outInfo)->SetSplitModeToXSlab();/

Hi,
I don't know for Paraview, but 'osirix', a free DICOM tool, should be  
able to visualize 4D dicom files.

Am I correct that the cross() operation is still broken in ParaView  
3.4.0
related to the bug posted: http://www.gccxml.org/Bug/view.php?id=2903 ?

randall.hand once suggested the addition of the support for the vector  
cross product operator. It was added some time later. Then some new  
operators such as boolean ones were added and during this process  
unfortunately the vector cross product operator was carelessly  
disabled due to the incorrect check on the number of the input  
parameters.

The correct format of a vector cross product operation is:

     ====================================
     vector_C = cross(vector_A, vector_B)
     ====================================

     INSTEAD OF

     ====================================
     cross(vector_A, vector_B, vector_C)
     ====================================

     In other words, there should be TWO parameters and ONE comma.

     However, the bug in vtkFunctionParser:: CheckSyntax() occurred  
within the following segment (between line 1444 and line 1453):

     ============================================================
     if ((functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_MIN) ||
         (functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_MAX))
       {
       expectCommaOnParenthesisCount[parenthesisCount+1] = 1;
       }
     if ((functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_IF) ||
         (functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_CROSS))
       {
       expectTwoCommasOnParenthesisCount[parenthesisCount+1] = 1;
       }
     ============================================================

     Now this segment has been replaced with

     ============================================================
     if ((functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_MIN) ||
         (functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_MAX) ||
         (functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_CROSS))
       {
       expectCommaOnParenthesisCount[parenthesisCount+1] = 1;
       }
     if (functionNumber == VTK_PARSER_IF)
       {
       expectTwoCommasOnParenthesisCount[parenthesisCount+1] = 1;
       }
     ============================================================

     Now the code performs correct check on the input format in terms  
of vector cross product and the suggested functionality is supported.

       Thanks for suggesting the enhancement.

       new revision: 1.43; previous revision: 1.42
It says it is fixed but it seems to exhibit the behavior  described it  
the history of this bug (in 3.4.0). Namely if you give it two  
arguments it complains
about needing three? Is this fixed in the cvs version?

Thanks

Yes, that was fixed after 3.4.0 was released. It works in CVS head.

Thanks Luc. But as far as I know, osirix is only for mac os. Or am I wrong?

I am not familiar with the structure of DICOM format. Are we talking
about multiple DICOM files (i.e. a file series) or one file that has
all time steps? Also, which DICOM reader are you using and can that
reader support time?

What format is your data in? What reader are you using to read it?

To easily diagnose such mistakes (which I make ALL the time), I made
changes to cvs ParaView such that you cannot add arbitrary attributes
to proxy objects. When we release the next version, this script will
produce an exception.

Yes. You need to write a vtm file that points to your pvts files
(isn't this fun?). To generate an example, load to .pvts files, group
the two together and write it out to a vtm file.

XML based VTK files support multiple pieces in the same file. That's
why you need to specify this redundant information when you have only
1 piece.

Subject: [Paraview] Delete Data Array from unstructured mesh in pypython
In-Reply-To: <90E9A71B-87E7-4E97-AAFE-C8FCEB738DA5@cora.nwra.com>
References: <90E9A71B-87E7-4E97-AAFE-C8FCEB738DA5@cora.nwra.com>
Message-ID: <45d654b0903050902i279a5718g283f59cb914c3edd@mail.gmail.com>

Use a programmable filter with the following code (or something close to it):

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
output.CopyStructure(input)
output.GetPointData().AddArray(input.GetArray("pressure"))

This would avoid passing everything but pressure to the output.
However, it would not delete the other arrays from memory as the
previous objects in the pipeline are still referring to them. It
would, however, prevent further processing of those arrays. There is
really no way of deleting an object once you load it.  There are ways
of doing this in VTK. If there is a need for it, we can put
investigating the idea on our roadmap.

We are talking about multiple DICOM files (a file series).
Each DICOM file has its own DICOM tags. These tags contain the information
of the specific DICOM file. Different DICOM file may have the same tag
values (i.e. patient ID, Acquisition Time).
In my case, for simplicity, suppose all my DIOCM files have the same patient
ID, but they don't have the same Acquisition Time. There are 10 different
acquistion times in total. So, my DICOM files can divide to 10 groups and
each group of DICOM files have the same acquisition time. Also, each group
represents the same object (because they have the same patient ID).
The reader I want will enable Paraview to aware of this acquisition time
information in DICOM files and animate the DICOM files according to the
information (from group 0 to group 9).
Currently, I use the vtkDICOMImageReader to read one group of DICOM files.
This reader doesn't support reading acquisition time information. But
reading acquisition time shouldn't be very hard to implement. The things
that I am not sure is that how to relate the time information to this group
of DIOCM files (i.e. group 0), and then keep reading until all the groups
are being read?
I hope I explain my question clear using my broken english, please let me
know if not.
Thanks

If you are willing to write some code, it is relatively easy to convert a reader for a single time to one that reads a file series over time.  That topic is covered on this Wiki page:

Indeed, I think this would be very useful. For example I often use several
calculators in a pipeline and then create a custom filter from my pipeline.
Although the only data I need is the one in the output from my custom
filter, all the intermediate variables are kept in memory (right?) which can
make everything blow up. I know I can write the equivalent C++ code and only
keep the array I want, but this means I do not use the existing filters..

Subject: [Paraview] interpolation
Message-ID: <ce5dae9f0903051410r3411c2fes17d2f4ed67933ec4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, I'm thinking of writing an interpolation filter for Paraview in
order to transfer data from one 3D grid to another efficiently using some
kind of octree. Has this already been done ? I have used the Resample with
dataset filter in the past, but this does not give accurate results on my
test cases, also I believe it is not very efficient.

Any hints about where to start, or classes to look at ?

Cheers,
Jacques

Hi-

I'm trying to analyze data by rendering it in paraview and then
annotating it.? I'd like to draw a box around anomalies and then write
some information about it.

Is that possible to do?

Thanks,

I can't think of a good way to do that without doing a lot of either
c++ or python filter programming to extend paraview.

Right now annotation is limited to the 2d and 3d text sources and the
ability to turn on labeling of values that are inside the active
selection.

I think we would need to extend ParaView with an annotation filter
that would show in text format values from the data set it inputs and
with an easy way to assign arbitrary attribute values into a data set.

The first would require some sort of warning, or memory limit, because
it would quickly overwhelm both cpu time and screen space when applied
to any data set with more than a few MB of data values. This is the
reasoning behind the current annotation limitations.

The second can be done via the python filter (or for floating point
numbers the calculator filter) now. However a GUI, perhaps through the
spreadsheet view, would be much more user friendly. For large data
sets, there will have to be some way of not having to specify every
value.

Please submit a feature request via the bug tracker. I think this
would be a really useful addition.

I think the closest thing you can do is select the cell and then create some text annotation next to it.  To select the cell, click the toolbar button that has a green triangle in a dotted square with a mouse pointer (or hit the 's' key) and then click the cell in the 3D view.  To create some text, go to Sources -> Text, type the text you want in the object inspector, apply, then move the text where you want it to go.

If the text annotation you want happens to be a field variable on the cell, you can automatically label with that.  Turn on those labels with the selection inspector (View -> Selection Inspector).

I can't replicate this issue (which sounds like a bug). Can you
provide instructions/dataset to reproduce it?

I am not sure I understand your second question. Is this an axis
aligned slice? Should you be using Extract Subset instead (which
preserves the structured nature of the data).

Unfortunately, VTK does not support volumes that are not axis aligned.
I think that the easiest thing to do is to use ITK to convert this to
vtkStructuredGrid. You will loose the ability to volume render though.

Did you figure out how to fix this yet? Did you try this:

vtkDataSet* sc = input->NewInstance();
sc->ShallowCopy(sc);
contour->SetInput(sc);
sc->Update();

Hi all, 

I was wondering if any of you have had the same problems as me when using
the Resample With Dataset filter. 

Left and right part of the image are two different grids (different mesh
refinements), with data interpolated from one to the other. In the "spurious
regions" the Resample DataSet Filter sets the vtkValidPointMask to 0. 
I believe this means the interpolation routine is not finding a cell in the
source data containing the points in the input data. Does anyone have a fix
for this ? I'm thinking of changing the tolerance... 

But what is even more strange is that if I interpolate from one grid onto an
IDENTICAL grid, I still get a few points where vtkValidPointMask is 0....

Any suggestions?

This is exactly what I need. Essentially, some sort of selection  
representation and arbitrary key/value pairs. The values would need to be  
stored somewhere. Any ideas where/how to store them? Perhaps a database?

Is it overwhelming because of the time it takes to render text?

Some sort of table view would be great. Each row would contain the  
attributes about whatever data was previously selected.
How can this be done with a python filter now?

Cool, it's now in as case 8700.

Kenneth-

The data I want to annotate is somewhat structured. So, what I need is a  
way to "structure" the input text. For example, perhaps I see in the data  
some sort of remarkable feature and I want to categorize as a foo. Then I  
see another feature that I categorize as a bar. While I could add "foo"  
or "bar" as the text of the selection I need a way to later filter the text  
to show only those text labels that are foo.

Hi,

Lets say your verts output port contains 4 verts :
1 ?2 ?3 ?4

if you want to display "a" on vert 1, "b" on vert 2 and nothing on the
other verts, you can add one vtkStringArray that contains 4 element :
"a", "b", "", ""
then you do:
myOutput->GetPointData()->AddArray(myVtkStringArray) ;

If you want to have 2 options of labels:

Verts: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?1 ? ? ? ?2 ? ? ? ?3 ? ? ? ?4
vtkStringArray1: ? ? ? "a" ? ? "b" ? ? ?"c" ? ? ?"d"
vtkStringArray2: ? ? ? "i" ? ? ?"j" ? ? ? "k" ? ? ?"F"

then you add two vtkStringArray to your output:
myOutput->GetPointData()->AddArray(myVtkStringArray1);
myOutput->GetPointData()->AddArray(myVtkStringArray2) ;

That will allow you to have different options of labeling.
The size of your vtkStringArray must be equal to the number of Points.
That's why i suggested to adding a new output port so you dont have to
add an empty string
on all you data that you don't want to annotate.

For adding labels using the user interface, I have no idea how to do
it. The text source is a static widget and I don't thing you wants a
static labels.

  Hi all, I made a quick modification to the vtkProbeFilter.cxx to pass the
input data as well as the interpolated data to the output. This is so I can
calculate deltas between two configurations without having to use a python
programmable filter. Could you tell me if you think this modification is the
right way of doing what I want? (It seems to work, but I'm not absolutely
sure this is a correct way of doing things.)




  // First, copy the input to the output as a starting point
  output->CopyStructure(input);
  output->CopyAttributes(input); //<JP - copies input data as well
  
  vtkPointData* outPD;

  outPD = output->GetPointData();

  // Change name of input data 
  int numArrays  = outPD->GetNumberOfArrays();
  for(int i = 0 ; i < numArrays; ++i){
    vtkAbstractArray * absar = outPD->GetAbstractArray(i);
    absar->SetName(strcat(absar->GetName(),"_original"));
  }

At least it compiled. I am going to have to sharpen up my gdb skills  
to get through this I guess. Eclipse doesn't want to launch gdb for  
some reason at the moment and I won't even attempt Xcode at this point.

Interesting. I am working on this, too. Is it possible to get the
source? Integrate it into paraview? I think this is an important topic.

Subject: [Paraview] SQLite to XY Plot
Message-ID: <8258ab8d0903090401j2375bdc1n4f7f0760ad744539@mail.gmail.com>

I have a sqlite database that has many time based metric results and I
would like to plot these and be able to do a comparison over different
sqlite databases.

So, what is the best way to get the query results into a format that
can be displayed as an XYPlot?

Specifically, do use a vtkRowQueryToTable object to create a vtkTable
and then how to persist to a format for Paraview, or (better) - read
directly into Paraview without persisting - create a custom reader? a
programmable source?

Eventually, I would like to animate the time series.

I have the complete book set and have compiled 3.4.0 with Python 2.6.1
and with Qt 4.5.0 (now LPGL).

I would greatly appreciate any advice.

Thanks,
Steve

Subject: [Paraview] Image filters & extent
Message-ID: <74790FF1-9E49-45A3-AAEA-40B163EBCD7E@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi,

I have been having trouble with writing image filter plugins. If the  
extent of the output image is larger than the input image extent, I  
get all sorts of problems.

I have tried using various parent classes, including  
vtkImageAlgorithm. Currently I am using vtkDataSetAlgorithm (I thought  
it would not try to be as "clever" as the vtkImageAlgorithm, but it  
seems to be the same thing).


1. The full extent is not visualized:
by setting the the extent of the output in RequestData I managed to  
get the visualization right:

   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );


2. Unfortunately, even with the addition above, the information  
(extent, dimensions etc.) are not shown correctly in the "Information  
tab" in paraview. Strangely enough, if I change a parameter of the  
filter and call Apply a second time, the values in the information tab  
are suddenly correct.


What I want is really a simple way to generate an output image with  
different size/extent than the input image, without having all this  
trouble setting pipeline information. Is there a way?

Thanks
Bryn

Another problem I get with the "partial solution" of setting the  
update extent in the output, is that the update extent is sent through  
the pipeline to the input. But it is too big for the input:

ERROR: In /Users/brynlloyd/pack/ParaView-CVS/VTK/Filtering/ 
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 818

vtkImageDataSource(0x2183b670) is 0 11 0 11 0 11, which is outside the  
whole extent 0 9 0 9 0 9.

The same thing happens with the vtkImageConstantPad filter.

I wrote a GUI and ServerManager xml file and added the plugin to  
paraview. The output outline is shown correctly, but the extent and  
dimensions displayed in the Information tab are incorrect -> they are  
are the same as for the input image, even though I set a larger output  
extent in the vtkImageConstantPad filter.

Additionally, the data array looses it's name (I think this happens  
with all image filters, which is not compatible with paraview as far  
as I can tell).

Has any body got a solution or any advice? Thanks!

You would create an instance of vtkSQLiteDatabase and point it to your
sqlite file. You set that as the database in vtkRowQueryToTable.
ParaView's vtkCSVWriter allows you to write this table as a .csv file,
which ParaView can read directly. You should be able to load a
2-column table into the existing chart view.

If you feel adventurous, you can compile from CVS with
PARAVIEW_BUILD_OverView on. This will build a set of plugins for
ParaView, one of which is a SQL Table Reader. You can run paraview and
load the related plugin manually. This enables ParaView to directly
read from sqlite, along with other SQL database types.

Message-ID: <BAY122-W945DAAE319780F4839C6EBCA00@phx.gbl>


Hi!
Trying it out, I found that the XdmfReader does not work when Paraview is started in parallel mode. How can I change that? Is it enough to compile the parallel hdf5 - library as well (in the directory Paraview3.xx/Utilities/hdf5) and then changing the XdmfReader in a way like 

#ifdef Paraview_Parallel (is there anyway to detect at runtime that paraview is started in parallel mode)
#define read_h5(..) = <parallel routine>
#endif

Or maybe someone is already working on that, so I could wait for the next release? ;-)

greetings,
NH

When I load 3D data into Paraview, I first get shown the outline, then I change this to "surface" to see the associated attribute data. What?s the difference between "surface" and "volume"? It looks the same to me - just that I get an segmentation fault when I apply the gradient filter to the data and then want to be shown the "Volume" - why is this?

thx,
Natalie

Volume Rendering uses opacity to let you see through and inside the
data. Surface just shows the outermost surface. Volume rendering is
more compute intensive and thus often slower to render.

The two usually look very different.

I would have to have more details, like a stack trace or at least
error output to hazard as guess as to why it might be segfaulting for
you.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about inheritance in paraview(vtk)
Message-ID: <d0767b160903091117o26fb5f87u30b1baf8b764abc1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone. This might be a silly question, but I am really confused.
I am writing a class inherites from vtkDICOMImageReader. In the header file
of vtkDICOMImageReader class, there are some forward declaration of these
classes: vtkDICOMImageReaderVector, DICOMParser and DICOMAppHelper. The
definition of these classes are included in the .cxx file. Normally, I
should be able to use the methods in those classes in my class. However, I
found that whenever I want to use something like
"this->Parser->ClearAllDICOMTagCallbacks()" in my class. The compiler gives
me back an error says that "invalid use of undefined type 'structure
DICOMParser". In the above, "Parser" is an instance of DICOMParser. The same
situation also happen to DICOMAppHelper and vtkDICOMImageReaderVector.
Thanks very much for any of your help.

In your .cxx file add #include "vtkDICOMImageReaderVector.h" and the  
other classes that are just forward declared in the header file.

Yes, I have done that in my .cxx file, but it doesn't work...
I also found a strange phenomenon. When I include the header files for
DICOMParser and DICOMAppHelper in the header file of my class, I got an
error said "it can't find those header files".

I am wondering if this is related to the paraview plug-in CMake file. I use
the following code in the CMake file to link the paraview (vtk) library:
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

Maybe this isn't enough to link the DICOMParser and DICOMAppHelper in
paraview?
Thanks,

Biao

Subject: [Paraview] State files pv 3.4 VS pv 3.x
Message-ID: <fb2577d80903091229h6c3b00d4sd6a971f084543fb9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

If am right, the new Paraview state files contains less information
then the old ones. For example, I used to see "CameraManipulators"
proxy in the old paraview state files but I can't find it in paraview
3.4 state files.

Is there a reason for this ?
How can I find out witch information has been removed from the
Paraview 3.4 state files ?

Thanks,
Nehme

Camera manipulators are no longer in state files since it was decided
that that's a user-setting and hence the user's setting for
interaction will be used and not those specified from state files.
Look at vtkSMStateVersionController. It has code that convert state
files from old versions to new versions. However may not remove all
redundant changes such as the manipulators.

Are you including the paths to the DICOMParser and DICOMAppHelper  
header files? Can you do a "make VERBOSE=1"  to see the entire compile  
command? Maybe it is not getting included properly for some reason.

Thanks Utkrash.

Is there a way to check if the StateLoader has a proxy with a given id ?

Currently am doing:
vtkSMProxy *proxy = myStateLoader->NewProxy(id);
if( ! proxy )
{
  continue;
}

The problem is that vtkSMStateLoader::NewProxy(int id) will pop up an
error message if the proxy with the given id is not found.
That's why I want to check if the proxy exist in the state before
using NewProxy(id)

Thank you,
Nehme

Thanks for your help, Michael Jackson! I am a big fan of you. :-)
The problem was in my CMakeLists.txt file. Because I use ITK libraries in my
class, I include
FIND_PACKAGE(ITK REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${ITK_USE_FILE})
in my CMakeList file.
After I delete those code in my CMakeList file, everything worked fine.
However, if I included those code in the CMakeList file, even if I didn't
have anything related to ITK in my .cxx file, I still get the same errors as
above mentioned.
Did that suggest ParaView Plug-in can't use external libraries (i.e. ITK)?
If not, how can I use ITK libraries in a ParaView Plug-in?
Thanks.

It depends on how you are building your plugin. I use externally built 
libraries all the time. 2 Things to remember here:

1: Compile time Includes - you will need to make sure that 
include_directories(.. ) are called for each directory that needs to be 
included. The "ITK_USE_FILE" should be setting those includes I believe.
2: Link time libraries - you will need a list of all the external 
libraries that also need to be linked to your plugin. If you are 
creating a new reader/writer/filter then that means setting the

SET (PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES
     ${PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES}
     ${BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY}
     ${HDF_LIBRARY}
)

variable like show above.

That should get you started.

Still no progress on this.


I have tried to integrate vtkImageConstantPad as a plugin. The displayed 
outline of the image (in paraview) suggests that the extent of the 
enlarged image is correct, but the information printed in the 
information tab shows the same extent as the input, rather than the one 
I expect at the output of vtkImageConstantPad.

say the input is an 10x10x10 image. I set the output extent to be 
12x12x12 in the vtkImageConstantPad. However, Paraview tells me the 
output still has dimensions 10x10x10.


I have modified vtkImageConstantPad and tried different parent classes
  - vtkImageToImageFilter
  - vtkImageAlgorithm
  - vtkDataSetAlgorithm
  - vtkTrivialProducer

... hoping to break up the pipeline somehow, i.e. simply producing a new 
image, which is displayed and can be used subsequently for other operations.

Sofar with no success. I have written a test, which runs as a separate 
program. The test proves to me that the filter DOES work as expected. 
But in Paraview the extent is screwed-up for some reason.


I have seen similar reports by John Biddiscombe, from around 2005 and 
more recent. Was there any solution to this?


Thanks

Hi,

I noticed such a problem for other filters. In fact, it seems that
vtkImageReslice and inherited filters are not ParaView compliant. I was
forced to write external executable to process my volumes (making isotropic
an anisotropic DICOM volume), then I open it in Paraview.

Best regards,

Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] Tensors in Paraview
Message-ID: <28CDD41D-94DA-4AD7-8BA1-F3C21DED9E21@sjc.ox.ac.uk>

Hi all.

I was looking for information on working with tensors in Paraview  
today and came across a whack of old mailing list posts.  Many of  
these indicated that changes might be coming to PV in the future with  
regards to tensors, especially once Numpy was supported/integrated  
within PV.

What is the current status of handling tensors in PV and Numpy  
integration?

Also - beyond the use of the basic glyph representation, and the use  
of the 'compute derivates' filter could anyone who regularly works  
with tensors in PV point me towards useful tutorials and/or PV  
extensions.

Many thanks,

Dan

Hello everybody

I want to create an animation by Python scripting. I would like to set the
position of camera in each frame(e.g. in the animation I want the camera
to rotate around the object), but I could not find any example in which
the position of the camera can be set in each frame.
I would appreciate if anybody could help me.

It sounds like FindCell() is failing. It would be great if you could
extract the cells that are causing this and post a small dataset that
contains them. It is probably a bug related to tolerance issues in one
of the cell types.

I have soloved the problem. Thanks for this amazing community and especially
thanks to Mike.

Instead of using:

IF ( ITK_FOUND)
    INCLUDE( ${USE_ITK_FILE} )
ENDIF( ITK_FOUND)

I use:

FIND_PACKAGE(ITK REQUIRED)
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${ITK_INCLUDE_DIRS})
LINK_DIRECTORIES(${ITK_LIBRARY_DIRS})

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES (MyReader
  ITKCommon ITKIO ITKAlgorithms
)

to get my expected plugin file.
Other than "TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES", I also have tried:
SET (PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES
   ${PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES}
   ${ITK_LIBRARIES}
)
There was no error in the compile and link time and I got the expected .so
file. However, when I load this .so file into ParaView as a plugin. I got an
error like this: "undefined symbol: _ZTIN3itk11LightObjectE)". This error
seems suggest that the ITK libraries aren't correctly linked.

I am not familiar with "PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES". And I can't find any
information about "PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES" in ParaViewUse.cmake and
ParaViewConfig.cmake files. Where is this variable defined? Or should I
define it by myself? How this works?

Dear developers,

      I am sorry to trouble you.     I am currently involved in a project which needs to use paraview or even add some my own stuffs.  As a beginner, i wish i could understand how the paraview works after starting up.  How the QT part initialized and set up, especially the parts involved with VTK and QT.  For example, if i create a sphere and do some subsequent filt operation, how does the QT part interact with the VTK parts?  And how do they keep synchronized with each other?    I do wish i can get the answer from you people since it is really hard to find the answer somewhere else.

      Thanks very much and i really appreciate if any help provided.

Best Regards,
zhigao

 As I said, this is just occurring when I use the Gradient filter.

 Do you have any idea what?s going wrong?

vtk objects are all controlled through vtkSMProxies. This indirection
allows the client application to control vtk objects that exist in
remote (often parallel) processes as easily as it controls vtk objects
that exist within the same process.

The QT client application controls vtkSMProxies with the help of
pqProxy class. This class helps with vtk event to qt signal slot
translation.

There is more to the story than just the above. Perhaps Utkarsh, Berk
or some of the developers from ETI will add more detail.

The error, although annoying, does not point to an issue. Slice
creates empty blocks because it does not intersect some of the input
blocks. The writer is complaining about those. You should be able to
read and write despite the errors. I'll report a low priority bug to
remove the warning.

Hey folks,

is it possible to save a screenshot of all views in the same image without
using the print screen? I noted that the "save screenshot" menu only saves
the active view.

thanks in advance

The current development version at least has a checkbox on the save
screenshot dialog that lets you control whether all or just the active
view is saved. The default is to save just the active view.

I am not sure how far back that feature goes.

Ah, ok! I thought it were something hidden in the GUI. I'll keep using the
print screen solution while the new version is not released.

Thanks David for the info.

I just installed Paraview via Fedora 10 repository. The main window

Message-ID: <C5DD4694.6C1E%kmorel@sandia.gov>

There are two main layers that deal with moving values from Qt components to the underlying VTK objects.  The first layer is the server manager layer, which is controlled through the proxies that Dave mentions below.  The server manager layer is documented in Chapter 18 of The ParaView Guide.

There are different mechanisms for going from Qt components to server manager proxies.  Most of the GUI components under the Object Inspector/Properties tab are managed by the pqPropertyManager class.  This class records changes in Qt GUI components, pushes the changes to the server manager when apply is hit, and creates entries for the undo/redo stack.  The pqPropertyManager class is usually set up by methods in the pqNamedWidgets class.  These methods will attach QWidgets to server manager properties with the same name.  It can also automatically create Qt Widgets based on the properties in a server manager proxy.

What do you mean by you cannot visualize files? Does the main render
window show up (with center axes and all)? Can you create one of the
sources in the "Sources" menu and hit "Apply", do you see the
visualization correctly?

Subject: [Paraview] Better names for 'representations' ?
Message-ID: <EC185865-A518-4267-AAB2-820D64226DE3@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I am wondering whether it would be possible or reasonable to have  
ParaView match the names of proxies in 'sources' and 'representations'?

When working from Python, it's easy to get a proxy from 'sources' if  
you know its name from the pipeline. The name even changes when you  
edit it in the pipeline. In contrast, 'representations' proxies are  
named 'DataRepresentation1', 'DataRepresentation2', etc., and to find  
the proper proxy I always have iterate through the representation  
proxies and check for a match between the proxy from 'sources' and the  
representation proxy Input.

Since I don't understand much about all the client/server/proxy stuff,  
I don't know if this is a reasonable request, or if it's difficult for  
PV to do things internally like change the representation name when  
the source name is changed.

Thanks,
-Eric

I am doing some work about making plugins for ParaView.
So I have a question ,that is after I made some changes in ParaView, I tried
to recompile it with CMake+VS2005, and then I found I could not debug it any
more. How does it happen?And, how can I do to avoid this happen ?
Thanks so much!

Subject: [Paraview] 3d visualisation
Message-ID: <1236847114.1306.23.camel@lutoslawski.cfd>

Dear All,

We are looking at buying a 3d projection system; this consists of two
projectors with polarising filters and a screen, and you wear polarising
glasses; it gives a very impressive 3d effect. I use paraview (and
paraFoam from OpenFOAM) and would want to integrate this with the new
system - does anyone have any experience with 3d visualisation using
paraview?? I assume all that is necessary is to have 2 cameras looking
at the scene and feeding to the two projectors; but is this already
implemented, or if not, is anyone working on it??

Thanks in advance for any info!

Gavin

Eric,

The request does seem reasonable. However, with the upcoming changes
to the python API, it will provide better/nicer ways of locating
representations irrespective of their names. So the naming issue would
probably be redundant.

Subject: [Paraview] pqLoadFromObjectPanel and implicit_functions
Message-ID: <fb2577d80903120625r56d71c68kdf48b8fdd2af98a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

If I use an implicit_functions in a plugin, like Box, Plane or Sphere,
it will provides it's own gui and add it to the existing gui of the
plugin. But if I use a Qt designer gui, I can't access the gui of the
implicit_functions and the 3D widgets will not show up in the 3D view
!
Is there a way to solve this problem ? ( I know that I can use
pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel but it will take me long time to reproduce
my current custom panel )
To use the implicit implicit_functions I added this code to my xml file:

      <ProxyProperty name="CutFunction" command="SetCutFunction"
         label="Slice Type">
        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
          <Group name="implicit_functions"/>
        </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
              <Proxy group="implicit_functions" name="Plane" />
              <Proxy group="implicit_functions" name="Box" />
              <Proxy group="implicit_functions" name="Sphere" />
              <Proxy group="implicit_functions" name="Scalar" />
           </ProxyListDomain>
        <Documentation>
          This property sets the parameters of the slice function.
        </Documentation>
      </ProxyProperty>

I am not sure also if this is the proper way of using
implicit_functions. ( The plan widget never show up in the 3D view ! )

Thank you,
Nehme

If your custom panel, put a frame or groupbox or some QWidget that you
want to act as the container for this widget. Then simply create the
pqProxySelectionWidget passing this frame as the parent.
Look at pqNamedWidgets.cxx and search for pqSMAdaptor::PROXYSELECTION
to see how this pqProxySelectionWidget is created/used etc.

Just a suggestion: It would be great have the pipeline objects grouped when
we have multiple views. Sometimes, when the pipeline is large, it's hard to
find what object is in each view just looking for the visibility icon (that
small eye).

Cheers

These are just some pointers (some of them outdated):

The VTK-toolkit (which paraview is based on) seems to support
stereo-rendering 

http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.2/html/a01192.html

One (possibly outdated) method to get it to work in Paraview is
described here:

http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/rg/20040715_schwarz/

I think (not sure) that MayaVi (another postprocessor based on VTK)
had the option to switch to stero-rendering

I know this is sketchy, but it's all I know (maybe somebody here can
tell you more)

Bernhard

Hi Bernhard! I think quite a few O'Foamers read the paraview mailing
list as well - for obvious reasons.

Thanks for the links. I'm passing them on to the vendor to see what
sense they can make of them - I think CrystalEyes is an active system,
whereas what we are looking at is a passive system working on polarising
light - but the second of your links seems to suggest that it will work
with that OK too.

Unfortunately, this is not the correct way of doing it. You are
changing the name of the output array which happens to also be the
input array (thanks to CopyAttributes). Changing your input in a
filter is a no no in VTK. You have to deep copy the attributes if you
want to do this. In the future, I think we will create another level
of indirection such that it will be possible to shallow copy the
contents of arrays (i.e. the pointer) for the purpose of renaming (and
else).

Does the main render window show up (with center axes and all)?: It shows up, but I can't see the "center axes and all".

Can you create one of the sources in the "Sources" menu and hit "Apply"?: No, nothing appears.

Do you see the visualization correctly?: No.

Do other OpenGL based applications work? Try updating your graphics drivers.

Does Fedora have a window manager effects control setting somewhere? I
have see things like window manager opacity and special effects
interfering with paraviews 3D Views. I don't recall which distro this
was under, but turing does the "fanciness" setting fixed a similar
problem.

Let me turn the question around to you and the ParaView user
community: What are the algorithms and visualization techniques of
interest to those dealing with tensors on a regular basis?

As for the numpy integration, we are making progress but not as fast
as I would like due to my lack of time. I am not sure 3.6 will have
the level of numpy support I'd like but it will have something; at
least by the first patch.

I agree with Utkarsh. Since the user interface hides the
representation objects from the user, the appropriate interface for
getting representations should take (view, source) as the argument.
Views on the other hand should probably be named so that it is easy to
match Python names to something in the GUI.

Can you be more specific? Grouped based on visibility? Is the idea to
quickly find the panel of an object you see in a view?

Hi Gavin,

How does this work? Are the two projectors fed by the same graphics
card? Do you need some special drivers?

Oops, sorry for not being more clear. I was thinking about grouping by
objects itself, not by visibility. In this way we would have something like
this:

view_1
    dataset_1
    filter_1.1
    filter_1.2

view_2
    dataset_2
    filter_2.1
    filter_2.2

view_3
    dataset_3
    filter_3.1
    filter_3.2

and so on...

Regards

Renato.

The paraview client has a --stereo argument which defaults to vtk's
red blue stereo mode. The other stereo modes from vtk will work but
there is no UI yet that lets the user choose which one and set up
parameters. Thus you have to change the code and recompile to try
anything other than red blue mode.

John Woodring at LANL has code to create the UI but it is not yet checked in.

I think what you mean is side-by-side stereo rendering mode. Right?
I have done this before.Paraview doesn't support this stereo rendering mode.
But it's fairly easy to change some source code of Paraview to make it work.
You only need to change the code in "*paraview/VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderWindow.h"
*and "*paraview/VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderWindow.cxx*". Please refer to this
webpage about how to change the code:
http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/intranet/it-service/applications/paraview/compiling-and-installing-paraview-and-vtk/

This works for linux system at least. I have tried it on windows, but
nothing change. Even if I use the red-blue stereo mode in paraview on
windows, it doesn't work too. I don't know if paraview doesn't support
stereo rendering on Windows or I have done something wrong on windows.
Anyway, hope this helpful.

OK, how do you decide which object belongs to which view? An object
can be shown in more than one view.

I see... I have not thought about this possibility. Maybe cloning the
object's name in the views that it's owned by. I don't know... I was just
willing to suggest a way to make the pipeline's representation more
organized and easy to understand when we have mutiple views...

As a matter of fact I believe this is the only OpenGL application I happen to have installed. In fact, now that you bring it, how can I check if my graphic card support OpenGL, or if I have it installed on my computer at all? I am using a built-in video GMA 950 on an Intel macbook. I have no idea how to update graphics drivers too. By now you probably figured out that I have limited Linux knowledge, therefore can you please provide me with command lines to run?

Hugo.

Do other OpenGL based applications work? Try updating your graphics drivers.

The only "special effects" I know of are located in System -> Preferences -> Look and Feel -> Desktop Effects pane, and they are not turned off.

Message-ID: <245222690903121947x45a85718xfb2f3331c8c5c80b@mail.gmail.com>

I am adding a new reader in ParaView as a plugin.There are some questions
about how to add the files in the appropriate path.
So Now I have already known how to write the files the plugin needs.But I
read the book The ParaView Guide, it says that if I want to write a
Client-side Plugin,I should write the source file vtkMyReader.cxx|h, and
then I need to write a SM.xml file, where shoul I add this file? And where
should I add the GUI.xml file and the CMakeLists.txt file which contains
ADD_PARA_PLUGIN( )? Thanks so much!

Would it be at all possible that, when a window has focus, the relevant filters in the pipeline have a light grey background, and the final one (with that small eyeball) is bold?

I see... I have not thought about this possibility. Maybe cloning the object's name in the views that it's owned by. I don't know... I was just willing to suggest a way to make the pipeline's representation more organized and easy to understand when we have mutiple views...

Subject: [Paraview] how to write boundary (face) data for 3D tetrahedra
	(cells) in	ASCII VTK file for Paraview visualization?
	separate value for	each face
Message-ID: <49BA5B6C02000066000B7F47@gwiasmtp.uct.ac.za>

March 14, 2009


Hi, I am not using the VTK software, but I am writing a VTK file to
visualize with Paraview.
I have one problem--writing data for the face (boundary) of my 3D
tetrahedra (cells).
Does anyone know how to do this for an unstructured grid in vtk? The
cells are 3D tetrahedra.

Currently I use CELL_DATA and FIELD type in writing my ASCII file:
(each tetrahedra gets 4 values for each of the 4 faces)

CELL_DATA 7927
FIELD FieldData 1
Boundary 4 7927 int
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 etc.

I have no idea if Paraview (or the vtk file format) knows which
number goes to which face. I'm using the .inp file face numbering system.

But when I visualize this in Paraview it doesn't seem to work well.
There are surfaces with boundary values higher than 3. Most of the
picture is correct, but the tetrahedra (cells) on the corners between
boundary groups display wrong values.


I found a similar question on Kitwares mailing list 10 years ago but there
were no responses I could find.

If you can help it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering a scene from a reader GUI while staying at
	background?
Message-ID: <20090313.232227.91290603.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I am now trying to add a simple "watch a running simulation" feature
to my reader GUI. It works such that every time a QTimer times out a
rescan for new timesteps and the following piece of code are run

  // set animation time to the last timestep and render the scene
  QList<pqAnimationScene*> scenes
      = app->getServerManagerModel()->findItems<pqAnimationScene *>();
  foreach (pqAnimationScene *scene, scenes)
    {
    scene->setAnimationTime(latestTime);
    }

where latestTime is the time value of the last timestep pulled from
the reader proxy. The code itself works fine, but what annoys me a lot
is that whenever a new time step is detected the ParaView GUI pops up
to the foreground in order to render the scene, at least on OS X. I
would rather like to keep ParaView as a background task while watching
a simulation.

So here are my questions: is there any way that I can set the
animation time and render the scene like the code above, but while
staying at backgound? If yes, how is it possible?

Thanks,
Takuya

Hey Guys,

That sounds fine. I'll be happy as long as there is a slightly  
easier / more transparent way of identifying the representation once  
you know the view and source.

Thanks,

Victor,

An elementary way is to create a second data set of just the surface 
facets (triangles in your case) with point and/or cell data as you like.

ParaView is quite happy to read in both data sets and with the 
"eye-ball" icon in the pipeline browser you can select either or both to 
view.  The two data sets can also be independently filtered as desired.
One can use the Transformation filter to offset one with respect to the 
other. One can choose separate views in which display the data sets,

All kinds of displays become easy with two displayable graphics objects.

Hi Berk, Thanks for the heads up, I noticed that I was renaming the input as
well, but in some ways that's exactly what I want.
So if that's the only "problem" then I think I'll live with it until this
other layer appears !

Thanks !

If you start weird things happening (like filters executing when they
shouldn't), don't say I didn't warn you :-)

I am not trying to shoot your idea down. I am trying to understand the
use case better. My biggest issue is that I always end up editing the
display settings when the wrong view is active. I am not sure how to
solve that problem. What is the particular problem in your case? You
have a large pipeline and you want to quickly get to an object to
modify its parameters? What  if you could just select the object in
the view?

Subject: [Paraview] slow (broken?) volume rendering in 3.4.0 (Fedora 10)
Message-ID: <49BB5A78.4010403@spamgourmet.com>

I'm having trouble with volume rendering, using the tutorial dataset 
"disk_out_ref.ex2".
 From the dataset, I selected the "Temp" variable, and the "Volume" 
representation.
The application then seems to nearly hang, except for occasional updates 
of a progress
bar which says "OpenGLProjectTetrahedraMapper: <n>" where <n> appears to 
be a
percent complete indicator.   It eventually gets to 100, but then just 
starts over again
at 1.  Each cycle takes about 5 minutes and never ends.  I have to force 
quit the application
to get out of it.

My system is Intel Core 2 Duo,  64-bit Fedora 10, with an ATI 4850 
graphics card.
I installed  paraview from the Fedora repository using yum.  Paraview 
version is 3.4.0.
I'm not using a remote server.

Mike

You seem to have OpenGL. However, the fact that glxgears is not
showing anything either is making me think that you OpenGL drivers are
not working properly. I don't have a lot of experience on Linux OpenGL
drivers, other than nVidia ones. Unless someone else here has an
answer, you will have to go to a Linux/X11/OpenGL related mailing
list. You can also try updating your Linux distribution or installing
another one...

Subject: [Paraview] vtkTableFFT compilation issue with CVS version
Message-ID: <8258ab8d0903140523r21a5db8fu155cd6908af3434@mail.gmail.com>

When building the vtkPVFiltersCS project (MS VS 9), I receive the
following error:

C:\CPP\Projects\ResultsViewer\Paraview\Build\bin\Debug\vtkPVFiltersCS.lib
and object C:\CPP\Projects\ResultsViewer\Paraview\Build\bin\Debug\vtkPVFiltersCS.exp
vtkTableFFTClientServer.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external
symbol "public: static class vtkTableFFT * __cdecl
vtkTableFFT::New(void)" (?New at vtkTableFFT@@SAPAV1 at XZ) referenced in
function "class vtkObjectBase * __cdecl
vtkTableFFTClientServerNewCommand(void)"
(?vtkTableFFTClientServerNewCommand@@YAPAVvtkObjectBase@@XZ)
C:\CPP\Projects\ResultsViewer\Paraview\Build\bin\Debug\vtkPVFiltersCS.dll
: fatal error


This is after several errors when compiling due to Window lack of
strcasecmp. I added the following to string.h to address the
strcasecmp error in vtkTableFFT.cxx:

#if defined(WIN32) || defined(WIN64)
#define strcasecmp _stricmp
#endif /* Def WIN32 or Def WIN64 */


So, even after removing the build directory and starting over, the
vtkTableFFT is still an unresolved external.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve

Another solution may be to download/install Mesa
(http://www.mesa3d.org/) and then set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the mesa
libraries before starting ParaView. That way you'll be doing software
rendering without having to deal with the driver issues.

Another solution may be to download/install Mesa
(http://www.mesa3d.org/) and then set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the mesa
libraries before starting ParaView. That way you'll be doing software
rendering without having to deal with the driver issues.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkTableFFT compilation issue with CVS version
In-Reply-To: <8258ab8d0903140523r21a5db8fu155cd6908af3434@mail.gmail.com>
References: <8258ab8d0903140523r21a5db8fu155cd6908af3434@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <8258ab8d0903150030l7f81bff2ld706a184627a4406@mail.gmail.com>

Just updated to latest CVS - looks like changes work - compile and
runs fine with BUILD_OVERVIEW on.

Relevant changes were to vtkTableFFT.cxx and vtkTableFFT.h:

VTK_EXPORT added to class vtkTable declaration in vtkTableFFT.h

For vtkTableFFT.cxx, the strcasecmp call was replaced with SystemTools::Strucmp.

Thanks,
Steve

Subject: [Paraview] Contour from Table - how?
Message-ID: <8258ab8d0903150525r3aeecb9cvf1a50fbfff6f8d91@mail.gmail.com>

I have used the latest CVS version with Overview build and used the
SQLDatabaseSource plugin to generate a table with four columns - 3
data (x int, y int, z float) and one idtype

I would like to construct a contour plot using the resulting table data.

I have ran the Table data through the TableToPoints filter and
generated a Polygonal Mesh with 1 cell and then applied the Contour
filter to the TableToPoints results but have no selection available in
the "Contour By" drop down.

What do I need to do to construct a contour from the Table?

Also, can I use lookmarks to compare several different sqlite source
files with the contour plot?

Thanks,
Steve

Subject: [Paraview] problems setting vtkDoubleArray with 3 components
Message-ID: <BAY122-W419944CC20E8FCA997B6A7BC9A0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?d like to set a vtkDoubleArray with 3 Components, it should be a vector array, the code looks like this:


vtkDoubleArray* momentum = vtkDoubleArray::New();
momentum -> SetNumberOfTuples(numOfTuples);
momentum -> SetNumberOfComponents(3);

for(vtkIdType i = 0; i < numOfTuples; i++)
    {double Tuple[3] = {xm_array -> GetValue(i), ym_array -> GetValue(i), 0.0};

     momentum -> InsertNextTuple(Tuple);
    }

Executing the code, I get the following error:
" Point array Momentum with 3 components, has 78520 tuples but there are only 58890 points"

numOfTuples just has the value 58890, it should not be inserting more tuples than that.. ?

thx, 
Natalie

When trying to compile the Paraview the other day, it complained about not
working with Qt 4.5.  I'm guessing this is in the works but figured I'd
ask.  I don't really have the option of going back to 4.4 or 4.3...

thanks,

try calling SetNumberOfComponents first, the memory is allocated in the 
call to SetNumberOfTuples

Hi !
Maybe I am an old-fashion programmer, but I don't think you are allowed to
initialized an array in this way. The braces should delimit constant
values... The best I can remember, the compiler should outputs errors for
your line :

double Tuple[3] = {xm_array -> GetValue(i), ym_array -> GetValue(i), 0.0};

Which one do you use?

Then for your specific problem, I recommend you to use the
InsertNextTupleValue from vtkDoubleArray instead of InsertNextTuple, that is
a pure virtual function of the parent class vtkDataArray.

I hope expert programmers will take a look at this !

Best regards,

Jerome

Also, if you SetNumberOfComponents, and SetNumberOfTuples, you want to 
use SetTuple(i,Tuple) not InsertNextTuple, because that will add them at 
the end.

Hi All,

I'm not 100% sure but I think you must call SetNumberOfComponents  
prior to SetNumberOfTuples.

Yes. After we release 3.6, we are going to move to Qt 4.5 as quickly
as we can. It should work with Qt 4.5 now btw. It is not tested
though. Let us know if you run into any issues.

What kind of dataset is this and which variable are you contouring by?
Before you can contour a dataset, you have to create cells (triangles,
quads, tetrahedras etc.) so that VTK has a way of interpolating values
over the area/volume. You can do this by using one of the Delaunay
filters but the solutions may be more straightforward and efficient if
the dataset is actually in some way structured.

Glenn, Berk,

I have compiled the paraview 3.5 CVS code with Qt4.5 - I changed the
main CMakeLists.txt to allow for Qt4.5 - line 111:

                STRING(REGEX MATCH "^4\\.5\\.[0-9]+" qt_version4_5_tmp
"${QTVERSION}")
        IF (NOT qt_version4_5_tmp)
          MESSAGE(SEND_ERROR "Qt ${QTVERSION} not supported.  Please
use Qt 4.3 (you may need to clean your dirtied cache).")
#	ELSE (NOT qt_version4_5_tmp)
#  	  MESSAGE("WARNING: You are using Qt ${QTVERSION}. Officially
supported version is Qt 4.3")
	ENDIF (NOT qt_version4_5_tmp)
#      ELSE (NOT qt_version4_4_tmp)
#        MESSAGE("WARNING: You are using Qt ${QTVERSION}. Officially
supported version is Qt 4.3")


The only issue so far has been adding the QVTKWidgetPlugin.dll -
receive error message:

"The plugin QVTKWidgetPlugin.dll uses an incompatible Qt library.
(Cannot mix debug and release libraries.)"

Looking at the message, it maybe that I built Qt4.5 in release mode
and Paraview 3.5.0 in debug mode - I have not had a chance to verify.

Also, define the PV_PLUGIN_PATH to be the location of the executable -
all the plugins are placed in the paraview.exe folder and not in a
plugins subfolder when doing a debug build with VS2008.

Berk,

I am trying to construct a 24 (hour) by 365 (days) plot of energy
values generated from a simulation and stored in SQLite.

The query that constructs a data table with the the three columns for
plotting is:

select  [hour],(([Month]-1)*31+ [day]) as y, variablevalue
from reportmeterdata rmd join timeindices ti on
rmd.timeindex=ti.timeindex
where recordindex=157
group by [month],[day],[hour]

This is used in the SQLDatabaseTableSource plugin and construct a
table with the [hour], y and variableValue columns from the database -
the plugin adds the idType fourth column.

Then I use a TableToPoints filter to construct a Polygonal Mesh with 1
cell with the correct X range (=[hour]), Y range (=y in query above)
and variableValues from the query.

I then try to construct a contour using the variableValue but that is
not an option in the "Contour By" property of the Contour filter.

I will try the Delaunay filter but need a way to script these data
views and to compare the results over multiple SQLite files - can
Paraview accomplish this?

Thanks,
Steve

Mike,
This is a known problem with ParaView 3.4.0.  The next version of ParaView should have much more robust volume rendering.

Volume rendering is (mostly) clean in the trunk.  You can build a version of your own (see the ParaView web site wiki - http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView, then building and installing instructions) for details.

I'm having trouble with volume rendering, using the tutorial dataset "disk_out_ref.ex2".
 From the dataset, I selected the "Temp" variable, and the "Volume" 
representation.
The application then seems to nearly hang, except for occasional updates of a progress bar which says "OpenGLProjectTetrahedraMapper: <n>" where <n> appears to be a
percent complete indicator.   It eventually gets to 100, but then just 
starts over again
at 1.  Each cycle takes about 5 minutes and never ends.  I have to force quit the application to get out of it.

My system is Intel Core 2 Duo,  64-bit Fedora 10, with an ATI 4850 graphics card.
I installed  paraview from the Fedora repository using yum.  Paraview version is 3.4.0.
I'm not using a remote server.

Mike

Make a new source code pull.  This was broken the middle of last week, but was fixed by Thursday or Friday.  If you still have troubles after a new source pull and clean cmake and build, let us know.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkTableFFT compilation issue with CVS version

When building the vtkPVFiltersCS project (MS VS 9), I receive the following error:

C:\CPP\Projects\ResultsViewer\Paraview\Build\bin\Debug\vtkPVFiltersCS.lib
and object C:\CPP\Projects\ResultsViewer\Paraview\Build\bin\Debug\vtkPVFiltersCS.exp
vtkTableFFTClientServer.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: static class vtkTableFFT * __cdecl vtkTableFFT::New(void)" (?New at vtkTableFFT@@SAPAV1 at XZ) referenced in function "class vtkObjectBase * __cdecl vtkTableFFTClientServerNewCommand(void)"
(?vtkTableFFTClientServerNewCommand@@YAPAVvtkObjectBase@@XZ)
C:\CPP\Projects\ResultsViewer\Paraview\Build\bin\Debug\vtkPVFiltersCS.dll
: fatal error


This is after several errors when compiling due to Window lack of strcasecmp. I added the following to string.h to address the strcasecmp error in vtkTableFFT.cxx:

#if defined(WIN32) || defined(WIN64)
#define strcasecmp _stricmp
#endif /* Def WIN32 or Def WIN64 */


So, even after removing the build directory and starting over, the vtkTableFFT is still an unresolved external.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve

Well, I tried to force it to use Qt 4.5 on a SuSE 10.3 machine. It  
compiled just fine, but when I try to run paraview, it crashes  
immediately with an FPE. I have to admit that this was a modified  
version of ParaView, so it very well be my own fault... So far I had  
no time investigate what the issue is.

I'm not sure when it was added, but I just noticed that the Plugin

Eric,

Representation plugin needs a redesign/reimplementation before it can
be used easily by the community. Until that happens, we are going to
say that representation plugins are not fully supported.

Hey Utkarsh,

Okay. Since the wiki referred to an existing example I thought I'd  
start playing with it, but I can wait for now.

Thanks a lot,

Hi,

could anybody give me some information on the problem of
adding multiple arrays to a single output of a reader.
Managing and displaying the array names GUI-wise is not
problematic, but rather where to put the data arrays in the
RequestData member.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <3b6093ef0903161542x33e3ede0q1dcfbc70f5698954@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to visualize some hdf5 data using the xdmf reader and I'm
encountering some issues.  My grid loads fine but when I try to import
a variable (ie. 'U') I get the error:
   Cell array U with 1 components, has only 0 tuples but there are 1024 cells

Below is my xmf file:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf>
  <Domain>
    <Grid Name="Rectilinear" GridType="Uniform">

      </Topology>
      <Geometry GeometryType="X_Y">
	<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="8" Dimensions="1 65 17" Format="HDF">

	<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="8" Dimensions="1 65 17" Format="HDF">

</Xdmf>
running h5ls on my data.init file yields:
h5ls data.init
T                        Dataset {1, 64, 16}
U                        Dataset {1, 64, 16}
V                        Dataset {1, 64, 16}
VOF                      Dataset {1, 64, 16}
W                        Dataset {1, 64, 16}

names                    Dataset {5}
time                     Dataset {2}

So 'U' has the dimensions 1x16x64 = 1024 cells.  Am I missing something?

Thanks for any help.
Peter.

Hello again,

solved this problem. But encountered a new minor one,
which is to dynamically reread the file if the GUI elements
change, for example, if some more arrays are select.
Could anybody point me where to start?
I guess that there is some kind of onUpdata callback,
but how is it called exactly and how is it used?

Best regards,

Look through the documentation for PV_PLUGIN_PATH. Basically there is
a designated folder on each platform where you can place plugins that
will get loaded on startup.

Peter,

That is probably a bug with 3D grids where one of the dimensions == 1.
I fixed that last week.
Try checking out the latest version from CVS.

There are also several directories that ParaView will check regardless of the value for PV_PLUGIN_PATH.  For example, on Linux/Mac ParaView checks ~/.config/ParaView/ParaView3.X/Plugins.  I personally find it more convenient to stick plugins (or symbolic links to them) in that directory than to try to manage PV_PLUGIN_PATH.  A list of directories that ParaView checks is displayed at the top of the Manage Plugins dialog box.

Hi,

using the button "select points on" i can drag up a rectangle to select 
some. But sometimes it would be nice by clicking on e.g. a surface to 
find the nearest point around - in fieldview for example i have to press 
to cntl-key to do this.

Is there a function in pv to do the same?

And: every time selection points the update of the graphic window takes 
some time. Is there a speed up?

Regards,

    Stefan

Subject: [Paraview] Calculator and Time history
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.0903170955590.10948@WKAN>

Hello,

Is there a way to use the Calculator on a variable at two different time
instances?  I have a time series of data stored in an exodus file.  I'm
trying to accumulate the sum of a variable over time and need to add the
previous value of a variable to the variable's current value.  Is there
a way to use the "Temporal Cache", "Temporal Shift Scale", or a similar filter to
provide the calculator access to a variable at a previous time instance?


Thank you,
David Fuentes

In your reader class method that sets which variables to load, is it calling this->Modified.  If Modified is not called, then the pipeline will not know that something has changed for your reader and it will not request a new read.

Hello again,

solved this problem. But encountered a new minor one,
which is to dynamically reread the file if the GUI elements
change, for example, if some more arrays are select.
Could anybody point me where to start?
I guess that there is some kind of onUpdata callback,
but how is it called exactly and how is it used?

Best regards,

Jerry,

I switched to a 2DSMesh and got rid of the leading 1 and everything
works fine now.  If I'm feeling bold/bored I might try the CVS version
later in the week.

Thanks for your help,
Peter.

Hey David,

I think you'll have trouble using the calculator filter for this  
because even if you time shift your data set, the variable will still  
have the same name so you won't be able to distinguish the original  
and time shifted values to add them together.

In principle you should be able to use a Python Programmable Filter to  
do this, since it can take two inputs and grab the scalars from each  
without worrying about the names. (Note, though, that there are  
sometimes issues with the pipeline updating properly when multiple  
temporal shifts are combined into a PPF -- bug 8156: http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=8156 
  )

I use this method to calculate velocity of particles "on the fly". So,  
my example may be a little more complicated than you need because I  
have to make sure particle IDs match each other before calculating the  
difference in their positions, but hopefully you can get the main  
ideas from here:

Attach a Temporal Cache to your data set (size = 2). Attach a Temporal  
Shift Scale to this with a Post Shift of whatever time value (actual  
time, not data set index) you want. Then, highlight both the Cache and  
the Shift Scale together and apply a Python Programmable Filter. My  
output data set is a vtkUnstructuredGrid, so I set the output of the  
PPF to that, and then put my script in the first window. (I'll place  
it at the end of the email.) This script adds a new array to the data  
set containing my calculated values.

NOTE: The catch for me to get the pipeline to update all the temporal  
shifts properly is that I have to "keep visible" the Temporal Shift  
Scale (or something directly branching off of it), or else my  
velocities all come out as zero! (I'll also attach a screen shot of my  
pipeline to make it clear.)

Good luck -- when it works, it works great.

Hi all,
I have an issue concerning thread usage inside paraview. I am using the vrpn
library to connect some controllers and manipulate paraview's objects. I am
running the connection routine of vrpn on a separate thread (so the main
thread of paraview keeps running smooth). However i can't seem to launch the
thread correctly... what i am doing is:

In the run method of my class(which i inherit from QThread)

void
myThread::run()
{
  analog = new vrpn_Analog_Remote(name.c_str());
  if(!analog)
  {
    cout << "Error opening device";
    return;
   }
 else
  {
    std::cout<<"SUCCESS"<<std::endl;
    analog->register_change_handler ( NULL, vrpnThread::handleAnalog );
    while(true)
    {
      analog->mainloop();
    }
  }
}

In the paraview GUI i have a button when pressed launches a connection to a
vrpn server, as follows:

void SourceToolbarActions::connectVRPNServer(void)
{
  vrpnThread theThread;
  theThread.start();
}


So, when i click the GUI button a message appears saying the following:

            QThread: Destroyed while thread is still running...

I have put the thread to wait also

            theThread.wait()

but if i do this its obviously that Paraview's GUI will get blocked...


Any ideas how to work around this problem...


Thanks in advance.



Any idea what i am doing wrong?

Hi, I am trying to stop the SplashScreen when the ParaView starts.
I have built the ParaView from the source code, and I am trying to modify
the source code ,and it doesn't work! So I just want to know how to realize
it!
Thanks so much

Subject: [Paraview] Generating a distribution of ParaView with Plugin
Message-ID: <913289.7447.qm@web110106.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've developed a plugin for ParaView, and now I would like to distribute it to some researchers, so that they can use it. As the binaries of ParaView in the website aren't compiled with support to shared libs, I think I must pack my own version of it. 

What I would like to do, is to give them a zipped folder with a distribution of ParaView and the dll of the plugin (Windows environment). They should execute a .bat file (which would set environment variables like PATH and PV_PLUGIN_PATH) to get ParaView to run, and automatically put my filter in the filter menu. 

The question is: how to get this to work ? I've tried to copy the folder which Visual Studio creates when I build the project INSTALL (I thought this would be what I needed: a distribution of ParaView), but I'm getting problems to run ParaView by this folder in another computer. 

Any tips?

Regards,
Rafael March.?

This is not true. The binaries we distribute use shared libraries and
it is possible to build plugins that can be run with them. You have to
match the compilers and Qt version we use. On the download page
, there is a link to a wiki page that describes those.

You need to use cpack like we do to make binary distributions. You
should probably check out the cpack documentation first. I believe the
CMake book talks about it so does this page:
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Packaging_With_CPack. You will have to
install the nullsoft install system if you want to distribute self
installing packages. Then you have to change the install rules of
ParaView such that you plugin is installed with ParaView. This is
somewhat complicated. We are working on making it simpler.

Is you plugin proprietary? We have plans to create methods for
researchers to contribute plugins that we maintain and build as part
of our release process.

The ParaView team is probably not going to help you on this as we
would like people to keep the splash screen. We put a lot of effort
and money into making ParaView and the least you can do is to give us
credit by keeping it.

Subject: [Paraview] Qt/Python includes?
Message-ID: <4AABDA1B-0EEA-4456-8130-EF4E12579CF1@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I am reproducing some work I followed on the mailing list to make a  
toolbar button which runs a particular Python script. It all works  
fine, but to find pqPythonShell.h I need to manually add the $ 
{ParaView_SOURCE_DIR}/Qt/Python directory to my includes in CMake.

Is there a reason that this directory is not included in the main PV  
CMakeLists.txt file in the SET(PARAVIEW_GUI_INCLUDE_DIRS ...) section?

Thanks,
-Eric

Unfortunately, doing what you want without writing a new filter is not
possible. I suggest modifying the temporal statistics filter to add
what you need. I'd like to see the next generation array calculator
supporting this sort of thing much better but that won't make it into
3.6.

Using the point selection mode, you should be able to click to select
1 point. Doesn't this work?

How slow? How big is the geometry that is being rendered?

I think Delaunay 2D will be useful. There are better ways of doing it
but this should get you started.

Definitely. Using the Python scripting support, you can do this pretty easily.

We used to have this functionality but we lost it in transition to 3.
I believe you can use lookmarks to achieve this though. Someone who
know lookmarks better please speak up. If not, I suggest posting a

There is no GUI directory in the base of the repository.  Are you sure you don't mean ParaView3/Applications/Client?

Subject: [Paraview] How to read a series of a series of data into memory?
Message-ID: <d0767b160903181427m2b756f49m6ec4f3ed8096f93d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.
I am wondering if there is a way to read a series of a series of files into
memory at one time.
I understand that there is a restarted reader mechanism in Paraview and it
can do the job for me. But the problem is that my data is kind of large, I
have to wait a long time for a series of files to load from hard disk for
each time step. This isn't a good thing for me, since I need to animate the
data in a acceptable frame rate.
So, once again, is there a way to load all my files with time step
information into memory at one time?
Thanks very much for any of your comment.

It sounds like the geometry cache for the animation would do the trick.  Open the Animation Inspector (View -> Animation Inspector) and scroll to its bottom.  Turn on the Cache Geometry flag and make sure that the Cache limit is large enough to hold all the polygonal geometry over all time steps.

Incidentally, these options should be moving to the application settings soon (bug #5768).

This works if the point is nearby. If i click e.g. in the middle of a 
triangle of medium size (unstructured mesh) it does not select a point. 
The problem is: exploring a solution i am not interested in the points 
but in the flow field and so normally i do not show the points but a 
e.g. a cut with a scalar. There i would like to get information about 
this scalar ...

The case has about 20e6 points and there is only a cut visible. 
Rendering the clicked point it takes about 5 secs ...

Hi, I am writing a custom reader for paraview to read my own data file which
paraview hasn't have.
I have known that the most important method is RequestInformation and
RequestData, and I just want to write a reader that can output the data type
of StructuredPoints with Scalar and some vectors.I have already use :
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
                 0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[2]-1);
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),
                 0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[2]-1);
and:outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(), ar, 3);
outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), origin, 3);
and how can I read the scalar data just like the file-format describes:
SCALAR dataName dataType numComp
LOOKUP_TABLE tableName
s0
s1
s2
...
s(n-1)

which method or function can I use to read the s0,s1,...,s(n-1) into the
variable and set to the outInfo.
Thanks so much!

Subject: [Paraview] plot point over time - how to use it?
Message-ID: <216591.10369.qm@web35306.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear PV experts:

I loaded a transient dataset into paraview (3.4.0).? This is 3D unstrucutred mesh.? 

Is there any tutorial that shows how to "select a point using a mouse"?? Then, plot that point over time?

I know how to select a whole bunch of cells ("select cell through selection"), but, never know how to select just a point using the mouse.

Thanks!

All of the select mechanisms work the same with the plot over time filter.  Simply do a "select points on" selection (the toolbar icon has a triangle with red points surrounded by a dotted box and a mouse cursor on it) and apply it to the plot filter in the same way you used the other selection.

Alternatively you could open the spreadsheet view, view the point data, click the row corresponding to the point you want to plot over time (this will select that point), and add the filter as you normally would.

Select points find vertices, select cells find cells, I believe you
are trying to find data at a specific location within a cell, which is
not necessarily on a vertex.

Try the probe location filter. Activate it, then press p with the
mouse on the point you are interested in, then click accept. This
filter does not need additional render passes like selection does, so
it should be fast.

If you need to process the data you've identified further, you can
manually make a location type selection out of the selected coordinate
(there may be automatic ways to convert that I am not aware of) in the
selection view.

Message-ID: <8258ab8d0903190744u66a0afa0x2ca196500365f461@mail.gmail.com>

How can I construct a "simple" contour plot scaled nicely (like the
bar and line plots in Paraview) similar to
http://qwt.sourceforge.net/spectrogramscreenshots.html ?

I have simple rectilinear data - 3 columns 24x365 (x,y) and a third
column of data to provide the contours.

I have imported data through the SQLTable reader plugin and to a
vtkTable with 4 data arrays (my data and an id column).
I then ran through a TableToStructuredPoints filter so that the
contour filter could be applied.

When the contour filter is applied, I get a skewed contour that I
cannot resize to fit nicely into a window.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Steve

Hi Mark,

This is now fixed on CVS head. Note that the time step slider is gone.
You have to use the global time settings. Loading an MFIX file and
hitting play should work.

Hi,

How can i obtain or access the interactor which moves the camera or the
object in the paraview render window? I want to be able to access it so i
can use vrpn and move the object. I have tried earlier retrieving the render
window and creating a vtkrenderWindowInteractor (plus adding a trackball to
it), however this creates another render window (which is not paraview's)
and i need is paraview render window.

Thanks for the reply.? Now I can select the point.? But, I then select "plot selection over time" filter, I did not get any plot.? The spread sheet view showed that there is no point in the "plot selection over time" row.? I am not sure why that is.? Also, PV did not ask why field variable I am ploting.? I am missing something.

Any suggestion?

All of the select mechanisms work the same with the plot over time filter.? Simply do a "select points on" selection (the toolbar icon has a triangle with red points surrounded by a dotted box and a mouse cursor on it) and apply it to the plot filter in the same way you used the other selection.

Alternatively you could open the spreadsheet view, view the point data, click the row corresponding to the point you want to plot over time (this will select that point), and add the filter as you normally would.

Subject: [Paraview] plot point over time - how to use it?

Dear PV experts:

I loaded a transient dataset into paraview (3.4.0).? This is 3D unstrucutred mesh.

Is there any tutorial that shows how to "select a point using a mouse"?? Then, plot that point over time?

I know how to select a whole bunch of cells ("select cell through selection"), but, never know how to select just a point using the mouse.

Thanks!

Pei

Hi, Ken,

Now I am able to plot selection over time, but, only if I select "cell", not point.? 

Thanks!

Pei

Hi, Ken,

Thanks for the reply.? Now I can select the point.? But, I then select "plot selection over time" filter, I did not get any plot.? The spread sheet view showed that there is no point in the "plot selection over time" row.? I am not sure why that is.? Also, PV did not ask why field variable I am ploting.? I am missing something.

Any suggestion?

Pei

All of the select mechanisms work the same with the plot over time filter.? Simply do a "select points on" selection (the toolbar icon has a triangle with red points surrounded by a dotted box and a mouse cursor on it) and apply it to the plot filter in the same way you used the other selection.

Alternatively you could open the spreadsheet view, view the point data, click the row corresponding to the point you want to plot over time (this will select that point), and add the filter as you normally would.

Is the data associated with the points or the cells? It may be the
case that your data is cell centered, so when you plot a point over
time there is nothing to plot.

Look at the arrays on the information tab of the object inspector. A
cube icon means the array is associated with the cells, a circle means
the array is associated with the points.

Subject: [Paraview] load several vtk files - transient dataset.
Message-ID: <890591.76733.qm@web35307.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear PV experts:

Sorry to bother you guys about this.

I have a list of vtk files, something like:

a_0.vtk
a_60.vtk
a_360.vtk
a_660.vtk
a_960.vtk

The numbers about is in seconds from OpenFOAM simulation.? I load the files into paraview-3.4.0.? I am able to to animation and plot transient data.? However, the time step indicates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of the real time.

I wrote a pvd file like:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep="0" group="" part="0" file="a_0.vtk">
<DataSet timestep="60" group="" part="0" file="a_60.vtk">
<DataSet timestep="360" group="" part="0" file="a_360.vtk">
<DataSet timestep="660" group="" part="0" file="a_660.vtk">
<DataSet timestep="960" group="" part="0" file="a_960.vtk">
</Collection>
</VTKFile>
?
but got vtkPVDReader error.
?
Can you shed some light on this?? How to get time stamp read into PV correctly?
?
Pei

Maybe I'm being dense, but if you already retrieved the render window, why not just call GetInteractor()?

Hi,

How can i obtain or access the interactor which moves the camera or the object in the paraview render window? I want to be able to access it so i can use vrpn and move the object. I have tried earlier retrieving the render window and creating a vtkrenderWindowInteractor (plus adding a trackball to it), however this creates another render window (which is not paraview's) and i need is paraview render window.


Thanks

What you are using is not quite right.  First, it sounds like you really want to create a vtkImageData.  This data holds a 1D, 2D, or 3D grid of points with origin and uniform spacing on each axis.  Thus, you would inherit from vtkImageAlgorithm and cast your output to vtkImageData.

Second, the only thing you directly set in the output information is the WHOLE_EXTENT().  You do this in RequestInformation so that the downstream pipeline can make decisions about what to load before the data is actually loaded.  So, the first line you have below is correct, assuming you put it in RequestInformation.

Now, you don't set UPDATE_EXTENT, you get it.  Someone downstream will set this the region of data in which it wants you to load.  You don't actually have to get this directly from the output information; you can get it from the output object.  So in RequestData, you would have code like this:

 vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::GetData(outInfo);
  int *extent = output->GetUpdateExtent();

Now you can set the actual extent, spacing, origin, and data itself directly into the data object.

 output->SetExtent(extent);
  output->SetOrigin(origin);
  output->SetSpacing(ar);

You can then set the data either by allocating and getting scalar data through the vtkImageData or by adding data to the image data's point data structure (retrieved with GetPointData()).  More details are in The VTK User's Guide.

I have known that the most important method is RequestInformation and RequestData, and I just want to write a reader that can output the data type of StructuredPoints with Scalar and some vectors.I have already use :
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
                 0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[2]-1);

and:outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(), ar, 3);
outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), origin, 3);
and how can I read the scalar data just like the file-format describes:
SCALAR dataName dataType numComp
LOOKUP_TABLE tableName
s0
s1
s2
...
s(n-1)

which method or function can I use to read the s0,s1,...,s(n-1) into the variable and set to the outInfo.
Thanks so much!

Unfortunately, that feature is not implemented in ParaView yet.  It is something that I am planning to add before ParaView 3.6.  Attached is a plugin that defines a new view that allows you to color front and back faces differently.  I'm not sure if it compiles against Paraview 3.4 but it definitely works with a recent CVS checkout.  To use it (after compiling, of course), load the plugin, delete the 3D view and then create the special Front/Back Render View.  After you do that, you will see that the there is a section in the Display panel that allows you to change the Backface Style.  If you try it out, please give some feedback on the UI, which I'm not too proud of.

If all that sounds like too much work, you might want to try the "Normal Glyphs" filter.  It basically places an arrow pointing out of the front face of cells.  It was added to perform the same check you are trying to do.

Hi Guys,

I am new to paraview.

It seems that paraview doesn't support this format since when i opened it, there is a dialog asking me to select the responsive of the file.
I can't find the hdr format in the dialog.
How to properly open the .hdr image file in paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] Standalone vs client-server mandelbrot source
Message-ID: <C0620EBD-934E-401E-BEE4-E7EAFF85D881@lanl.gov>

Hi all,

I have written a custom paraview reader which populates a 3D  
vtkImageData and one of my users tried it with a 3D problem where the  
second dimension was of size = 1.   When I tried this with standalone  
ParaView_3.4.0 it seemed to work correctly by making a 2D image in  
the lower window of a split screen while the upper window left  
blank.  When I tried this with a client-server 3.4.0 paraview crashes  
saying

ERROR: In /Users/paraview/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Filtering/ 
vtkExecutive.cxx, line 757
vtkUpdateSuppressorPipeline (0x38f20e70): Algorithm

ERROR: In /Users/paraview/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Filters/ 
vtkImageSliceMapper.cxx, line 109

I was advised to try the Source->Mandelbrot because my reader should  
operate the same way, but I find that mandelbrot runs with standalone  
but crashes the same way with client-server.

Is this a paraview problem and if so, is there a workaround so that I  
can try to get my custom reader fixed?

Thanks.

First of all, what is a .hdr format? Is it related to HDF5? If so, HDF5 is
not natively supported by ParaView. But you can write a small piece of Xdmf
file describing and pointing to the data in your (supposed) HDF5 file.

I am not sure if HDR here refers to High Dynamic Range. There is such an
emerging high-fidelity image file format (*.HDR) used to store / encode
original image data (e.g., in 'double' format to record ray tracing or
radiosity results without quantization) whose range (max / min, usually over
10^7 or even more) is beyond the regular displayable range (after some kind
of quantization).

Hi David,

tried this way: theoretically it works, but its a bit laborious:

-) Activate the filter
-) "p" + mouse
-) Apply
-) Spreadsheet + select source

And: i found no possibility to select a new point with the current 
filter - so i have to start a new one. Further on, i clicking apply i 
have an update of "PointerPolyDataMapper", which takes a (short) time.

So overall, it would be nice if i can use it that way:

-) Activate new Probe-Filter + Spreadsheet
-) "p" + Mouse - every time clicking, automatic update of the spreadsheet

Best regards,

     Stefan

Hi,

I met the hdr format a while ago. It was with the MRIcro software. The hdr
file goes together with an .ima file, that have the same roles than in .mha
/ .raw file couples.
hdr = header = mha or mhd
ima = data = raw

What I cannot remember is the read mode of a hdr file. Binary or ascii ? If
this is ascii, you should translate it easily in mha style.

'hope this helps

Unfortunately, there is no way of doing this with .vtk files at the
moment. If you convert your files to the XML based format, you can use
the pvd file. I suggest reporting a feature request for pvd -> vtk at
http://paraview.org/Bug.

You might also try using foamToEnsightParts or foamToEnsight.
Then you could also edit/remove unwanted time-steps from the .case file, and the time values (in the .case file) are certain to be correct.
If you have a constant mesh, the Ensight format will also save some file space too.

Hi folks,

Does anybody know if there's a (step-by-step) tutorial explaining how the
particle tracing filter works? Just wondering to animate particles
travelling in the streamlines for a flow past around a circular cilinder
problem...

BTW, It would be great putting a hint in the "Input" and "Source" fields of
the filter. They sounds a bit enigmatic...

Thanks for any help

Hi,

I am trying to do mostly the same thing as Rafael (eventually build
and deploy my own build of ParaView onto our university cluster), and
having a similar problem.

I tried to build a 32bit binary of unmodified ParaView 3.4.0 (as a
first trial to build my own modified ParaView) using Windows XP SP3
pro, VS2008SP1 pro edition, Qt 4.3.5 opensource edition, CMake 2.6.3
and NSIS installer 2.44. The compilation and running INSTALL and
PACKAGE targets both went fine, but when I try to run the binaries on
another machine I always get an error, regardless of the packaging
targets (INSTALL or PACKAGE):

(the original message is in Japanese, but should translate as follows)
"The Side-by-Side configuration information contains errors. This
application has failed to start because the application configuration
is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem."

What I noticed is that the package created by running the INSTALL
target contains msvc[mpr]90.dll and Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest while
running the PACKAGE target does not, but the resulting errors are the
same. Also, I read around
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Packaging_With_CPack
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374224(VS.85).aspx
and their relevant pages without significant success so far.

The question is, what are the missing steps to create a win32 package
of unmodified ParaView 3.4 that works out of the box using VS2008,
like the one distributed from the ParaView site?

Thanks,
Takuya

Split the 3D view and create a spreadsheet view. Then turn on show
only selected cells. Make sure you are looking at either cell or point
centered data, whichever one you've associated the Score and Distance
arrays with.

Alternatively, open the Selection Inspector, scroll down to the
bottom, click to the cell/point labels tab, turn them on and select
the Score or Distance array. This will show them in the 3D view.

I've traced the problem back to a recent change to Utilities/Xdmf2/vtk.

I've backed out of the change so that we may build ParaView until it is fixed.

Hi folks,

Does anybody know if there's a (step-by-step) tutorial explaining how the particle tracing filter works? Just wondering to animate particles travelling in the streamlines for a flow past around a circular cilinder problem...

BTW, It would be great putting a hint in the "Input" and "Source" fields of the filter. They sounds a bit enigmatic...

Thanks for any help

Renato.

Message-ID: <458892.22306.qm@web110103.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

thanks, Berk, for your answer. As you corrected me, I've compiled my plugin under the same Qt version of the ParaView distro which is in the website. Now, it is built under the following environment:

plugin:
Operating System: Windows Vista Business - SP1Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition 8.0.50727.867no pythonQt 4.3.5 open source version

ParaView of Kitware's site:

paraview-3.4.0-win32-x86.exe:
 Built on Windows XP Professional Version 2002 (Service Pack 3) 
 Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition 8.0.50727.762
 python 2.5.2
 Qt 4.3.5 open source version
But is still doesn't work ! I got another machine that never saw ParaView before, installed it, and tryied to load the plugin. Then I get a message like "The file "blabla.dll" is not a valid Qt plugin. 

I'm wondering if the problem is the slight difference between the visual studio versions. Or maybe the OS. What do you think ? 

Regards,
Rafael March.

This is not true. The binaries we distribute use shared libraries and
it is possible to build plugins that can be run with them. You have to
match the compilers and Qt version we use. On the download page
, there is a link to a wiki page that describes those.

You need to use cpack like we do to make binary distributions. You
should probably check out the cpack documentation first. I believe the
CMake book talks about it so does this page:
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Packaging_With_CPack. You will have to
install the nullsoft install system if you want to distribute self
installing packages. Then you have to change the install rules of
ParaView such that you plugin is installed with ParaView. This is
somewhat complicated. We are working on making it simpler.

Is you plugin proprietary? We have plans to create methods for
researchers to contribute plugins that we maintain and build as part
of our release process.

Hi group,

I tried creating some surface streamlines as described in the wiki.
Process seemed to work but was extremly slow for me so I could not wait it.
I have large CFD models imported as ensight (~ 20 Million cells).
Paraview run for about five hours without an result for surface
streamlines from 50 seed points. I don't really know if this is normal?

Okay, I found a hacky solution. If anyone is interested, it was a
problem specific to VS2008SP1 as discussed at a CMake list thread:
http://www.mail-archive.com/cmake at cmake.org/msg15910.html

In short, the quickest workaround is to hand-edit
Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest file under the installation directory to
change the version number string 30729.1 to 21022.8.

Hi paraview developers,

   I am trying to compile the cvs version of paraview using VC2005 under
Vista 64 bit. I am using QT-4.4.3. When I run
the cmake configure, there is a warning said "WARNING: Qt Assistant is
required by ParaView. Set QT_ASSISTANT_EXECUTABLE before continuing".
However, I have set the variable QT_ASSISTANT_EXECUTABLE to the correct
location "C:/QT/QT4_win64/bin/assistant.exe". It seems that the cmake does
not recognize this. I am wondering if there is a small bug.

Thanks,

I'm new in using paraview for visualisation and I need some help for scaling or transforming surfaceplots independently from axes and boxes. The data about X, Y and Z are from different dimensions, thats why I have to transform or scale it, but the axes should show the real values and should not also be scaled.

Thank you for help.

Subject: [Paraview] inconsistent UPDATE_TIME_STEPS with multi-port reader
Message-ID: <E05ABC9A7FBFB942B70D7533AF5BE68D02A3E0BA@augexmsg001.euro.corp.dir>

I'm noticing some very odd behaviour when using the OpenFOAM
library-based reader (the one that is part of OpenFOAM, not the one
shipped with VTK).

The reader uses SetNumberOfOutputPorts(2), with port 0 corresponding to
normal cell-based volume/point data and port 1 corresponding to any
Lagrangian data such as sprays or particles, etc.

In the initialization, both ports are set with identical values for
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS() and
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE().

Message-ID: <c9adba420903230346r2d2bd826sdc5fa21f97158477@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like make the tree view use all the available space in the
properties tab for the Extact Block filter.  At the moment this is split
50/50 with the checkbox.  Is there an easy way to do this?  Or could someone
point me in the direction for the file that I will need to be editing in
order to change this?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Hi,

I've just updated CVS and I like the new line chart view :)

Just one minor bug.  If you use points to plot X vs Y and then switch to a
3D view and then back it will reset the X-Axis component to Distance.

Regards,
Paul

If I am not mistaken, that happening because we use a custom subclass,
pqTreeWidget for the tree. I'd look at pqTreeWidget and it's
size-related code sections.

Apply the "Transform" filter to your data to transform it. However,
also turn on the visibility of your original data source i.e input to
the transform filter, switch the representation type to outline and
then show cube axes etc. on that original data.

The data about X, Y and Z are from different dimensions, thats why I have to transform or scale it, but the axes should show the real values and should not also be scaled.

Subject: [Paraview] using netcdf in paraview
Message-ID: <C7E072CF3978724EBC105AB65235207E01A955D9@XMBIL102.northgrum.com>


Hi there. I'm trying to read netcdf data into paraview, but am having lots of issues. I was following these directions (from here: http://www.cscs.ch/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=132):

Please build ParaView using the CMake advanced option PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES set to CSCSNetCDF rerun configure and set PARAVIEW_USE_CSCSNetCDF to ON, then rerun configure and enter the name of the directory where the source has been extracted.
Build paraview and the netCDF reader should be embedded.
Building as a vtk module is supported, documentation will be provided as soon as possible. (Some changes have recently been made which may break the existing build, these will be fixed shortly).

But when we make Paraview, it's not finding a bunch of files (vtkMultiGroupDataInformation.h, vtkMultiGroupDataSet.h, vtkMultiGroupSetAlgorithm.h). 

Any advice on how to make this work? Or maybe a better way to read in netcdf files?

Thanks,
Katie

I've tried modifying sizeHint (adding extra number of rows for default and
just returning a huge QSize) for pqTreeWidget.  I've also tried setting the
sizePolicy to MinimumExpanding but still no luck.  It doesn't seem to be
effecting the size at all.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Yeah, I don't expect perfectly debugged code in the CVS head ;)  I just
thought I would let you know!

BTW would it be easy to add a checkbox to fix the aspect ratio in the XY
plot?

CVS users,

how does one set the FileName of a

tex = servermanager.rendering.ImageTexture(SourceProcess=16)
tex.FileName="/tmp/foobar.jpg"

?

I am getting an error while setting the FileName. The code used to work
under 3.4

thanks for any hint

I'm trying to change the diffusive and specular properties of the material in Paraview (3.4.0).  I have one of the .xml files from the wiki (SmoothPlastic for example), but when I am unable to browse for the material in the display->style->Material section of the object inspector.  Is there another way to apply material properties?

Thanks,

Thanks a lot, my plugin is working quite nice.
One question remains: how do I get the GUI to
take non-default values for Sliders for example?
More concrete: I have got a file on disk, parsed
its metainfo and now I want to put some of it
in the GUI to allow subdomain selection.
The paraview book mentions the SimpleInformationHelper
but does neither explain how it used nor how specific
variables are set with it, for example Slider min-max...

Thanks for the suggestion.

I actually have Qt-4.5 in the proper PATH, still I get this error:

The procedure entry point
?fillRect at QPainter@@QAEXABVQRectF@@ABVQColor@@@Z could not be located
in the dynamic link library QtGui4.dll.

Many thanks,

It is a QTreeWidget that is created in the createWidgets function in
pqNamedObject.cxx.  The spacing is occurring because the final row in the
layout is given a stretch factor.  This is useful if you only have widgets
that do not stretch well (such as a line edit).  I have added a flag that is
checked before applying this stretch factor to the last row.  I have only
changed the COMPOSITE_TREE widget where I set the stretch to 2 and then
unset the flag.  Below is the patch:

Hi,

As Berk corrected me, I've
compiled my plugin under the same Qt version of the ParaView distro
which is in the website. Now, it is built under the following
environment:

plugin:
Operating System: Windows Vista Business - SP1Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition 8.0.50727.867no pythonQt 4.3.5 open source version

ParaView of Kitware's site:

paraview-3.4.0-win32-x86.exe:
 Built on Windows XP Professional Version 2002 (Service Pack 3) 
 Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition 8.0.50727.762
 python 2.5.2
 Qt 4.3.5 open source version
But is still doesn't work ! I got another machine that never
saw ParaView before, installed it, and tryied to load the plugin. Then
I get a message like "The file "blabla.dll" is not a valid Qt plugin. 

I'm wondering if the problem is the slight difference between the visual studio versions. Or maybe the OS. What can be wrong ? Why I can't load my plugin with the ParaView binaries provided in the website ? 

Regards,
Rafael March.

Hi Rafael,

I'm not sure if this helps, but I noticed one thing while I was
solving a DLL problem about which I reported recently.

If you run the Qt assitant binary included in
paraview-3.4.0-win32-x86.exe (you may have to add a .exe suffix since
it is simply named "assistant") and select Help->About Qt, a dialog
appears saying "This program uses Qt ... version 4.3.3." Hence my
doubt is that it in fact is Qt 4.3.3 that was used to build the
Kitware's package.

p.s. You may also want to make sure you are doing a Release (not
Debug) build.

Regards,
Takuya

Utkarsh has just updated CVS to fix the bug:
  Qt/Components/pqDisplayProxyEditor.cxx -> 1.74
  Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMTwoDRenderViewProxy.cxx -> 1.4
Please try your plugin again and see if that works better now.

Hey Jean,

This has got to be a bug with ImageTexture. I can't get this FileName  
set, either.

Another example like sources.VectorText with a String VectorProperty  
(.Text) still works fine in CVS.

I'm stumped, but I'll let you know if I come across anything.

Also, if I try to access:

tex.GetProperty('FileName').GetElement(0)

I get a "Bus error".

This is related to the fact that it thinks that "This property  
requires 0 values"

Hi,

However I got the error "Qt4.3.0 or greater not found. Please check the

I'm sure qmake is located at c:/qt-win-opensource-src-4.5.0/bin/ .

Thank you for the explanation, but maybe I described the problem not exactly. 
I did not want to plot the surface of  the transformed data apart from the outline 
and the axes of the original data. I will to get a nonproportional plot. The bounds
of the data are X(0...3000) Y(0...250) Z(20...31) and this should be plotted in a cube
with the same length of each edge with axes labeled of the original data. With the
"Transform" filter I did many trials but without success.

The data about X, Y and Z are from different dimensions, thats why I have to transform or scale it, but the axes should show the real values and should not also be scaled.

Hi,

I don't know if this possible. Maybe with the calculator : what about if you
give as point data the original point coordinate, and then apply the
transform ? PointData should not be modified. This is a brief idea : I even
don't know how to set the axes to plot the point data instead of the
geometry...

Good luck !

Qt 4.4 or Qt 4.5 are not "officially" supported versions for ParaView  
3.4. If you search the archives there are solutions to allow the  
compilation with Qt 4.4 or 4.5.

Finally done!

I have one Qt-4.5.0 version and everything in correct path.

But the problem was there were multiple QtGui4.dll used by other
applications. With previous Qt version there was no problem. Now I just
copied QtGui4.dll and QtCore4.dll from Qt-4.5.0 to \paraview\bin\release
folder, that works fine.

Many thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Attaching a custom object panel to a filter.
Message-ID: <BA69CD90DB4FFA4DBF516E41B272B9A31DC2D1@ntxboimbx34.micron.com>

Hello List,

I have downloaded the ParaView-3.4.0 source and have a good build.

I have a custom reader and a custom object panel for the reader, and all is working well.

I also have a custom filter to operate on the reader's output, and it too is working well.

Last, I have a custom object panel for the filter; it inherits, for now, from pqNamedObjectPanel.
I can build it, (generate the .so) and load it into paraview (it is in the Plugin Manager / Local Plugins list).
But my plugin's object panel is not being called.  I get paraview's auto generated panel instead.  My panel's constructor is not getting called.

I found a similar post from 7/2008, but no resolution...

<http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-July/008787.html>

The filter's xml file, the CMakeLists.txt, and panel source code are below.  Anyone have a hint what I am missing or did wrong?

Thanks, Chris

I have neglected the netCDF code for the last year or so and it doesn't 
load with current paraview cvs. I will try to look at it in April. It 
ought to be easy to fix, but nobody ever offers to help and I'm too busy 
right now. I started making changes to simplify things in the reader a 
few months back, but haven't finished.

I notice recently that in the main paraview CVS some netCDF support is 
appearing. Perhaps it's worth asking on the main paraview list. [pause, 
I'll cc the paraview list and see what response this generates]

Hi,

I wrote a plugin that reads in NetCDF files, I used my external build of
NetCDF directly (works fine)... Do you need to use the ParaView NetCDF ?

Subject: [Paraview] How to construct "Standard" 2d contour plots

Unless I am misunderstanding your question, you should be able to
change the scaling of the result one of two ways:

1. from the display page using the Transformation settings (Scale)
2. using the transform filter

(1) changes how the data is rendered. (2) actually changes the point
coordinates.

Also, you don't have to use the contour filter to achieve the effect
in the second image. You can simply color by that variable using the
toolbar or the display page.

I hope that this answers your question.

Can you try adding an include for stdlib.h on top of XdmfDataDesc.h?
Something like:

#include <stdlib.h>

Please let me know if this works.

Hmmm. It sounds like there is version mismatch between ParaView and
the plugin. We deprecated those classes not long ago. Are you using
cvs ParaView?

I'll take a look soon. I am accumulating all the Python issues to deal
with all together before the release.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems in loading plugin
In-Reply-To: <603288.54827.qm@web110104.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>
References: <603288.54827.qm@web110104.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Here's a few things to check:

Check your qconfig.h file in your Qt build to see if the QT_BUILD_KEY 
contains the whole "8.0.50727.867" version for the compiler.
If so, then that's going to prevent it from working anyways.  The 
QT_BUILD_KEY must be the same as what Kitware had when they built ParaView.

Can you double check the dll to see if it really is a Qt plugin?
 From cmd.exe  :  dumpbin /exports blabla.dll
should give you a qt_plugin_instance exported symbol, which is the entry 
point for a Qt plugin.
The paraview plugin macros should make the entry point for you, but you 
could double check it.

The Qt plugin cache might have some details about the plugin such as the 
previously mentioned build key.
<http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/plugins-howto.html#the-plugin-cache>
Maybe you'll find a discrepancy.  You could try deleting the cache.

You also can't mix debug plugins with release paraview.

And what version of cmake are you using?  I hope you have a recent 
enough one where FindQt4.cmake sets -DQT_NO_DEBUG correctly for a 
release build of your plugin (another way to check is if your plugin 
cache says its a debug plugin when you actually built a release plugin), 
or you can put a workaround for that in your code.

Hi Berk,


It works up to a point.
It seems that there are some issues with calling hdf5 1.8 
so I had to add some add_definition in the CmakeLists.txt
Anyhow I have send an email to the xdmf list and I hope I will compile and 
they will get enough info to submit a correct version to the cvs.

regards,

Alin

Subject: [Paraview] particle tracking
Message-ID: <49C93CA5.9080004@yahoo.de>

Hi Berk, Jean,

Is this something more than a few users would want?
Yes I would b e very interested, Jeans workaround only works for 
streamlines calculated either "forwards" or backwards" but not "both"

Jean, how do you exactly do please?
-Then iso-contour the streamline object with the scalar field 
"IntegrationTime". Use a single threshold. (Contour filter?)
-Then animate the threshold value. Use Mode=Sequence, get a ramp between 
minimum time and maximun time. (How?)
-Use Glyphs (small spheres or arrows) attached to the iso-valued 
contours and they will "animate" their position along the streamlines. 
(How?)

Thanks BastiL

Hi Katie,

My plugin would be useless to you as it uses the NetCDF data storage format
but the way the data is stored is completely different to any meteorological
data type storage.
What I was suggesting is to write your own reader and use your own install
of your NetCDF library.

I'm just curious to know if anyone has ever tried to write a simple (Euler

Rafael,

I am going to assume that, you have all the compiler version/qt
version stuff sorted out, if you don't what I suggest won't make a
difference.

I recall having a similar issue. To work around I had to add my
plugin's bin directory (where it and all of its .dll dependencies
reside) ?to the PATH. When you load ?a dll on windows *all* of its
dependencies must be found, either in the applications run directory
(in this case that's the ParaView.exe location) or in the PATH. This
all has to do with the way Windows resolves shared library
dependencies. Your plugin won't work unless all of the dependencies
are in the PATH or the same folder as ParaView.exe. In the 3.6 release
we are adding the plugin's bin directory to the search space
during/prior plugin load behind the scenes to get around these type of
issues.

There is a free dependency walker tool that is useful to determine if
there are any dependencies that you don't know of that may be causing
your issues.

...and the link is http://www.dependencywalker.com/

As Burlen suggested, dependency walker can be useful for debugging dll
issues.? Try looking at your plugin with dependency walker, and it may
also be helpful to look at paraview.exe.

I encountered a similar issue to this when working on the Avogadro
Windows build. There is an alternate solution to this problem - if you
disable manifests for plugins then they do not need to resolve their
dependencies. The solution I found for Avogadro was to add this to our
CMakeLists.txt,

if (MSVC)
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} /MANIFEST:NO")
endif(MSVC)

As our plugins are built as modules this worked perfectly, Avogadro can
load its Qt based plugins from directories that do not contain
additional DLLs and we do not need to modify the environment. All
reports from users indicate that this approach works well.

If I am building paraview in addition to my plugins (which in the long
run works out better) then I use the technique where you use the
"PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE" then point that towards your project
that has ${project_name}ParaViewImport.cmake file. This way all your
plugins are deposited in the paraview build directory and will get
installed when you do a "make install". Then you can simply bundle up
the build directory and put that on another computer. Has always
worked for me so I am hoping that still works in the future.

Hi Berk,

Here is the answer that I got from John on the xdmf list.
This is after some header problems were solved plus the hdf5 1.8 version 
problem solved too,

Now the problem seem to be related with some casting of uint64. Anyhow it 
looks like me related with the problem that Mike Jackson fixed last summer in 
June.

I will not have time to follow John's advice until next week.

regards,

Alin

Hi,

the problem still exists. It seems not possible to scale only for display an let the 
annotation (Show cube axes) on unscaled values (the original values), which
are not transformed. If I use the transform filter I manipulate the real data an then
of course the annotation uses also the transformed values. I only will swage the
surface for the display and screenshots, but the axes annotations should show the
real values. Is this not possible? I use no geometry. The data are temperatures in Z,
height in y and time in X.

The data about X, Y and Z are from different dimensions, thats why I have to transform or scale it, but the axes should show the real values and should not also be scaled.

Is there a particular reason why you are using hdf5 1.8? Things would
probably go smoother if you used 1.6.X.

Hi Berk,

Personally I do not use the xdmf and I am interested only in the molecular 
plots.

The 1.8 version is the one that came default on my opensuse 11.1 box. 
In the face of the issues may be a good idea to bundle, as an option, a 
version that is known to work with paraview.

I try to compile paraview with all plugins as we intend here at ICHEC to offer 
it to the users as a complement/replacement of their visualization tools.

regards,

Alin

Hopefully, I understand this correctly now. Just go to the "Display
tab". If you scroll lower, you'll see a transformation section. Apply
the scale there. The scale will be applied to both the geometry as
well as the annotation, while the annotation will keep on showing
original data values.

This is the problem, when I use the transformation section on the
"Display tab" the scale will be applied to both, the geometry and 
the annotation (with "Show cube axes") but I see on the "Information
tab" the original values on the Bounds section. And this values should 
be used for the annotation not the transformed values, which are 
used for display. If I want the scale for both I can use the transform filter and manipulate the data directly but that is not what I want.

Alin

Paraview is bundled with a version of hdf5 that is known to work. But 
you turned it off, by setting

PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=ON

turn this back off.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating Append Attributes filter using python
Message-ID: <700943.12646.qm@web25906.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi all,



Could anyone advise me how to create an Append Attributes filter using pvpython?



Paraview documentation refers to Group Parts filter which, I believe, is obsolete in version 3.4.0.


My purpose is to merge multiple scalar/vector data sets sharing the same geometry. The data sets are loaded using PVDReader.

Thanks,
tpk

There seems to be a bug, if the transform was applied from the display
tab, the cube-axes should still have been showing the original data
bounds. Please feel free to add a bug report at
www.paraview.org/Bug

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Hi Mr. Oshima,

Thanks a lot for your help. I was trying, without success, to do this for a week, and just now I realized what was wrong !

First of all, I was trying to load my plugin having compiled it in debug mode, not release. When I changed this, I could load it without problems, but the Qt GUI was quite weird. Then, as you said, I compiled ParaView with Qt 4.3.3 (instead of Qt 4.3.5, as the Wiki indicates) and pointed my plugin to THIS distribution. I managed to compile it, and now it runs pretty well with the ParaView version distributed by the website. 

ParaView developers, this may be an error in the Wiki. Is the version in the "Downloads" section of the website REALLY compiled with Qt 4.3.5 ? 

Regards,
Rafael March.

Hi Rafael,

I'm not sure if this helps, but I noticed one thing while I was
solving a DLL problem about which I reported recently.

If you run the Qt assitant binary included in
paraview-3.4.0-win32-x86.exe (you may have to add a .exe suffix since
it is simply named "assistant") and select Help->About Qt, a dialog
appears saying "This program uses Qt ... version 4.3.3." Hence my
doubt is that it in fact is Qt 4.3.3 that was used to build the
Kitware's package.

p.s. You may also want to make sure you are doing a Release (not
Debug) build.

Takuya

Martha (+put back on paraview list for reference and google)

My Bad. One of the changes I made to the netCDF code was to handle 
series of files (one file per process, or one per timestep) using 
another class in vtkCSCSCommon
Best thing is check out all of it from here...
https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/
and use the cmakelists in the root pv3-plugins folder.
you need CSCSCommomn and netCDF enabled.

Fix the netCDF reader and send me the patches please :)

Rafael, nice to hear your plugin now works :)

Indeed, I'm interested in the real Qt version used for the Kitware's
win32-x86 package too, since the weird GUI that Rafael reported is
quite what one will see in case of Qt version mismatch.

Hi Guys,

By the way I just tried to load her data using the new VisIt database 
bridge and it worked! Does the CSCS plugin you guys have been talking 
about support multiple meshes in the same file? Just curious, cause I 
had to write a custom panel in PV to get that stuff working.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating Append Attributes filter using python

Hello,

It looks like you can just give the AppendAttributes filter a list of  
inputs:

==================================
from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect()

sph1 = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
elev = servermanager.filters.ElevationFilter(Input=sph1)

sph2 = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
ids = servermanager.filters.GenerateIdScalars(Input=sph2)

app = servermanager.filters.AppendAttributes()
app.Input = [elev,ids]

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(app, view)

rep.ColorAttributeType = 0  # point data
rep.ColorArrayName = 'Ids'  # color by Ids

view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
==================================

You can have an arbitrary number of meshes in the nedCDF file - but only 
one is exported (by default).

Part of the work I was doing recently was to add SIL support to the 
reader so that the GUI panel would display it all, and allow the user to 
select multiple meshes for export. The reader by default generates 
multiblock - but only the first block (biggest rather, decided by size) 
is actually exported. Once I've finished with it, each selected variable 
would be exported as a separate grid. The core code should handle 1-5 
dimensions (considering a vector field stored as a separate dimension, 
which between you and me is annoying).

The reader got messy because I was trying to support different 
conventions, so it's very hard to follow what's doing what. the ability 
to support associated variables for dimensions and stuff really messed 
it up, and different conventions use different systems for the grid 
variables etc.
Some data use time as a separate dimension, other multiple files etc etc....

Thanks for the prompt answer, Eric.
That seems to work nicely.

Hello,
It looks like you can just give the AppendAttributes filter a list of inputs:
==================================from paraview import servermanager?servermanager.Connect()
sph1 = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()?elev = servermanager.filters.ElevationFilter(Input=sph1)?
sph2 = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()?ids = servermanager.filters.GenerateIdScalars(Input=sph2)
app = servermanager.filters.AppendAttributes()app.Input = [elev,ids]
view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()?rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(app, view)?
rep.ColorAttributeType = 0 ?# point data?rep.ColorArrayName = 'Ids' ?# color by Ids?
view.ResetCamera()view.StillRender()?==================================

Hi all,

 Paraview documentation refers to Group Parts filter which, I believe, is obsolete in version 3.4.0.
 
My purpose is to merge multiple scalar/vector data sets sharing the same geometry. The data sets are loaded using PVDReader.

Thanks,
tpk

CVS users,

I have PV cvs compiled in full (i.e. PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI = ON) on one
cluster. No problem anywhere.

if I do another compilation (same cluster, same tools, same compiler)
but with PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI = OFF, I get these errors. Is the
"representations" stuff somehow missing if we compile without GUI?:

Message-ID: <49CB7E13.4010706@inf.ethz.ch>

Hello,

I try to read in hdf5 files with the xdmf reader. The read in of the
mesh works. But I have some problems with the attributes.

I have the following two hdf datasets:

      DATASET "Displacements" {
         DATATYPE  H5T_COMPOUND {
            H5T_STD_I32LE "Node";
            H5T_ARRAY { [3] H5T_IEEE_F64LE } "Ux Uy Uz";
         }
         DATASPACE  SIMPLE { ( 2609611, 1 ) / ( 2609611, 1 ) }
      DATASET "Stress" {
         DATATYPE  H5T_IEEE_F64LEH5T_COMPOUND
         DATASPACE  SIMPLE { ( 1633014, 7 ) / ( 1633014, 7 ) }

How do I read in the three floats from the Displacements. The problem
is, that the floats are in a H5T_COMPOUND.

Jean,

I've just committed a fix for this issue. Let me know if it does not
work. The new charting representations/views have Qt dependencies.
Those needed to be disabled from the server manager XML as well when
Qt support was not enabled.

Subject: [Paraview] Two follow-up questions on readers
Message-ID: <49CB8296.2030905@tp1.rub.de>

Hello,

I've got two more questions on reader plugins in ParaView.
1) How do I populate GUI-Elements with data read from a file.
    The ParaView book mentions InformationHelpers but does
    not explain their usage.
2) Can I use custom files - which I provide a reader for - in
    pvd-Collection-type XML-files. If yes, how do I do that,
    the naive idea of simply supplying the filename ends in a
    SEG-Fault.
If anyone could point me in the right direction or provide an
example?

Hi Stefan,

Try this:

- load dataset
- apply probe location
- create spreadsheet
- go to settings and turn on 'Auto Apply'
- change the probe location using 'p'

Does that work? What is the performance like?

Is there anyway to plot different time steps when using multiple views?

I tried to load the dataset twice assigning each dataset loaded to the
different views but I think that ParaView uses the same time step for all of
its views.

Renato,

Currently there's no way to plot different timesteps in different
views directly. An round-about way is to use the "Temporal Shift
Scale" filter to shift the time for showing data in the second view
such that the same global "time" maps to different timesteps in
different views.

What about using the Comparative View setup. You can plot a different
time-step for each view.

Hi, everyone!
I am writing a custom reader to read my own file which VTK does not support!
The output type of my file is vtkImageData, and each point has 3~5 type of
scalar. Now I have written
the reader like below, I just do not know how to add the scalar value to the
output object! Please check my code and point what's wrong with my code!
1. set the extent using WHOLE_EXTENT in RequestInformation() like below:

       outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
                 0,dim[0]-1,0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[2]-1);

2.set the origin and the extent and spacing in RequestData() like below:

   vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
    vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::GetDateFormat(outInfo);
    int *extent = output->GetUpdateExtent();
     output->SetExtent(extent);
     output->SetOrigin(origin);
      output->SetSpacing(ar);

And now, I want to add some scalar data to the output object.

I wrote my code like this:
vtkIntArray *castkey = vtkIntArray::New();
    castkey->SetName("casting_type");
    for (int i=0; i<dim[0]; i++)
    {
        for (int j=0;j<dim[1]; j++)
        {
            for (int k=0; k<dim[2]; k++)
            {
                int idx = i*dim[2]*dim[1]+j*dim[2]+k;
                castkey->InsertNextValue(sgnfile.GetData()[idx]);
            }
        }
    }

    output->AddArray(castkey);

note:GetData() returns the scalar value of the point idx.
So I was wonder what I did is right or wrong !
Please give me some suggestion!
Thank you so much!

I will commit the work next week, along with a Wiki describing how to 
build/configure the dependencies. For planning purposes plan on late 
next week.

Subject: [Paraview] Weird cellNormals
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0903260835q6050faddvd9cc16d916cf8321@mail.gmail.com>

With this file ( http://engineeringnotes.net/BunnyBlend.vtp), I can color
the cells by cellNormals, but I cannot apply glyph arrows using cellNormals.
Why is that / how can I change it so that I can glyph the normals?

Thanks,

If you are using the CVS root anyway, I just checked in some netCDF readers.  So hopefully you will now no longer need to do anything special.

You can add more fields by simply adding them to the point data of the output data object.

 output->GetPointData()->AddArray(pressure);

Make sure that you set a name for the arrays (using the SetName method of vtkDataArray).  That is how ParaView/VTK differentiates the fields.

Hi, thanks so much for your help!
I have changed my code just like what you said.
Now, I should add more than one type scalar like pressure, vol1, vol2, vol3 and so on.
So, how can I add these scalars into my output Data?
I have already read these scalars into some variables like m_pressure[numPts], m_vol1[numPts],m_vol[numPts] and m_vol3[numPts], and how can I add these variables into my output Data?
Thanks so much!

2009/3/20 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov>
What you are using is not quite right.  First, it sounds like you really want to create a vtkImageData.  This data holds a 1D, 2D, or 3D grid of points with origin and uniform spacing on each axis.  Thus, you would inherit from vtkImageAlgorithm and cast your output to vtkImageData.

Second, the only thing you directly set in the output information is the WHOLE_EXTENT().  You do this in RequestInformation so that the downstream pipeline can make decisions about what to load before the data is actually loaded.  So, the first line you have below is correct, assuming you put it in RequestInformation.

Now, you don't set UPDATE_EXTENT, you get it.  Someone downstream will set this the region of data in which it wants you to load.  You don't actually have to get this directly from the output information; you can get it from the output object.  So in RequestData, you would have code like this:

 vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::GetData(outInfo);
  int *extent = output->GetUpdateExtent();

Now you can set the actual extent, spacing, origin, and data itself directly into the data object.

 output->SetExtent(extent);
  output->SetOrigin(origin);
  output->SetSpacing(ar);

You can then set the data either by allocating and getting scalar data through the vtkImageData or by adding data to the image data's point data structure (retrieved with GetPointData()).  More details are in The VTK User's Guide.

Hi, I am writing a custom reader for paraview to read my own data file which paraview hasn't have.
I have known that the most important method is RequestInformation and RequestData, and I just want to write a reader that can output the data type of StructuredPoints with Scalar and some vectors.I have already use :
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
                 0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[2]-1);
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),
                 0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[2]-1);
and:outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(), ar, 3);
outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), origin, 3);
and how can I read the scalar data just like the file-format describes:
SCALAR dataName dataType numComp
LOOKUP_TABLE tableName
s0
s1
s2
...
s(n-1)

which method or function can I use to read the s0,s1,...,s(n-1) into the variable and set to the outInfo.
Thanks so much!

Utkarsh,

You're the expert on server manager XML.  Can you explain how to set a range domain that depends on something else (like an information property)?

The paraview book mentions the SimpleInformationHelper
but does neither explain how it used nor how specific
variables are set with it, for example Slider min-max...

I think this is one of the features that never got re-implemented after the major overhaul for the 3.0 release.  There is not a lot of call for this feature, so it has been a low priority.

Hey David,

You can do it if you apply the "Generate Surface Normals" filter. That  
gives you point data "Normals" that can be glyphed.

Maybe someone else that is more well versed in VTK data structures can  
chime in on why "cellNormals" shows up in the color combo-box but is  
not really considered to be a real point or cell data attribute (i.e.  
doesn't show up in the Information pane as a Data Array).

Message-ID: <E1BD088683EF744ABFB0ED62370BEB8B0F7157A0@ERD-ML4ERD.erd.ds.usace.army.mil>

folks,

hopefully i missed something that's already out there; but this has me
scraatching my head.

what i'm doing is simple enough.
took a Rectilinear Grid (aaa.vtr) and did a  Threshold using one of the cell
arrays.

then since i'm gonna use this later i save it out as a vtu.

when i try to read this file back into pv i get the following error:

ERROR: In
/viz/home/stephens/Kitware/ParaView/ParaView_cvs_350/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLU
nstructuredDataReader.cxx, line 653

vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0x2274930): Cannot read cell connectivity from
Cells in piece 0 because the "connectivity" array is not long enough.


using a pv checked out a few weeks ago.

i replicated the process (read, threshold, write) in a vtkpython script using
vtk checked out yesterday (v5.5), te outpt vtu file still has the same
problem.


any one ever see this before?

This looks like the CMakeLists.txt is wrong such that the

My guess is that / is confusing cmake on windows. Try using \ instead

I believe the issue is that the glyph by cell data because the glyphs are placed on the points rather than the cells.  Thus, all cell data is removed from the vectors list.  Try running the cell centers filter and then apply the glyphs to that.  Alternatively you can run the point to cell data filter, but that will modify the data.

Message-ID: <97d9bd670903261531x76ba2fd2y1e69959a533f8943@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have a vtkRectilinearGrid - I would like to use the
vtkXMLPRectilinearGridWriter to write the output of data into several
pieces.  In order to do this, I do the following

writer->SetInput(grid);
writer->SetNumberOfPieces(5);
writer->Write();

What this seems to be doing is writing a myfile.pvtr correctly and defines
extents of 5 files and even writes out the names of all pieces, for example
myfile_0.vtr ... myfile_4.vtr.

Howerver, there is only one vtr file actually gets written out
(myfile_0.vtr) which contains the other 4 files as piece extents within this
file, rather than in 5 separate files as specified in the .pvtr file.  Do I
need to use MPI to write the 5 files? or am I doing this incorrectly?

Regards,

Message-ID: <779dabeb0903261757k33408896p393ac2f15c51d36a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering whether there are any options that allow some
interactive editing of mesh objects in paraview? Is this a capability
that can be included in the existing pipeline structure or is it
completely outside the design. My reason for thinking about paraview
for this application is that the meshes represent objects in 3D
images, and seeing the image while editing the mesh helps a lot.
Paraview can display a mesh and the image together,  which seems like
a reasonable starting point. Any other suggestions? So far the tools
with the right mesh manipulation facilities seem to be animation based
(blender) or CAD oriented (meshlab).

Thanks

Hi everyone.
I want to use a new mapper which isn't exist in Paraview. I saw the wiki
page at "http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo". It seems to me that
adding a new mapper requires to add a new representation. Considering that
adding a new representation to paraview is complex and still in progress,
before I dig into it, I just wanna make sure if there is any other easier
way to add a new mapper.
Thanks.

Hi Richard,

This point has been discussed in the paraview mailing list: find the message
with subject "[Paraview] Mesh edition / modification with paraview".

I would like to add that VTK way of processing (pipelining) makes difficult
the editing process. However, it would be great to have such tool to edit
mesh according to volume slice images. You mentionned Blender: this is a
very good mesh editing software. I imagined, but have no time to code, a
plug-in for blender that allows a volume data to be loaded. Since there
exists a vtk/blender python script, it could be a solution...

Best regards,

Jerome

Here's a snippet of the XML that makes it possible for a domain to
depend on an information property whose values are obtained from  the
server.

      <DoubleVectorProperty name="StartThetaInfo"
        command="GetStartThetaRange"
        information_only="1"
        number_of_elements="2"
        default_values="1 1024">
       <SimpleDoubleInformationHelper />
      </DoubleVectorProperty>

      <DoubleVectorProperty
         name="StartTheta"
         command="SetStartTheta"
         information_property="StartThetaInfo"
         number_of_elements="1"
         animateable="1"
         default_values="0" >
        <DoubleRangeDomain name="range" >
          <RequiredProperties>
              <Property name="StartThetaInfo" function="RangeInfo"/>
          </RequiredProperties>
        </DoubleRangeDomain>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>

The key is to merely refer to the information property as
"RequiredProperties" for the domain.

Can you elaborate a  bit more on the type of "data" that you want to
be displayed in the GUI elements? Also, are you planning on writing a
custom panel for the reader?

PVD does not support arbitrary file formats in the collection. It
certainly would be nice feature, however I am not sure it's going to
be fairly easy to implement. Feel free to add a feature request at
http://www.paraview.org/Bug

Plugins for the representation pipeline (including mappers) is a
feature that's still missing in ParaView. Given that there has been
considerable traffic on the mailing list requesting these features, we
will try to support them as soon as possible. However, since we are
gearing up for the 3.6 release already, I don't think we can have this
done in time for the next release.

By default, your vtkXMLPRectilinearGridWriter sets the EndPiece to 0
(because it does not know any better on initialization). Here is what
you need to do to achieve fully distributed writing.

int N = 5;
vtkXMLPRectilinearGridWriter piw = vtkXMLPRectilinearGridWriter::New();
piw->SetInput(grid);
piw->SetFileName("/pathtofilename/file.pvti");
piw->SetNumberOfPieces(N);
piw->SetStartPiece(0);
piw->SetEndPiece(N-1);
piw->WriteSummaryFileOn();
piw->Write()

When I try to turn on Transparency for a large mesh, I am getting this

has to be killed).

Can anyone suggest a workaround or other quick fix that might help?
(I also get memory error problems, but this error is very common).

Biao,

If you are of the highly experimental type, you can look at the source
code in the streaming plugin. In that we've made a plugin for a new
view, with new representations and new strategies. The process was not
exactly trivial but parts of the code you be pulled out and adapted
for your purposes.

hth,

Subject: [Paraview] extract surface of multiblock mesh
Message-ID: <92BC5D1D-1130-4426-AE23-98B9C2DD736C@usace.army.mil>

Hi,

I would like to extract the surface mesh of a 3D tetrahedral mesh and  
clip off one boundary to see what is inside. This is to visualize a  
flow simulation around an object inside a tank.  The tetrahedral mesh  
is partitioned into 512 subdomains so if you look in the information  
viewer you see
Multiblock-DataSet
	Block 0
		0: UnstructredGrid
		...
		511: UnstructuredGrid

So far I've tried MergeBlocks->ExtractSurface->FeatureEdges->Clip and  
various permutations that I've seen in previous posts and the wiki,  
but I always end up with the  surfaces on the interior of the tank as  
if it still sees each subdomain as a closed surface.  I'm sure people  
do this all the time, but I can't seem to get it right. I'm wondering  
if I've written the data incorrectly so there is no simple way for  
paraview to eliminate internal processor boundaries from the domain.

Chris

Hi Everyone:
  I can compile the solution successfully when I build the plugin.  But I can't generate the dll document about the plugin. There is a warning when I configure the CMakerlists.txt of the plugin with CMake. The warning is :
   CMake is forcing CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to "D:/Program/Microsoft Visual Studio 8/VC/bin/cl.exe" to match that imported from VTK. This is required because C++ project must use the same compiler. If this message appears for more than one imported project, you have conficting C++ compilers and will have to re-build one of those projects. Was set to cl.
   If I don't press Cancel, there will be a errer :Paraview plugin are disabled. Please build ParaView with shared libraries.
   I didn't get this proplem before. Can you tell me how to solve the problem.
   Thank you very much. 
Jackie Chan...

Don't worry about the warning. CMake is just making sure that the
plugin is compatible with your paraview libraries.

The error means that you are trying to build a plugin against a
paraview binary that was built with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS off.That is not
possible. Plugins are shared libraries that paraview loads at runtime.
Reconfigure your paraview build to use shared libs, build paraview,
then build your plugin again.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0903291301w50c662b7w4dafe37c6738982a@mail.gmail.com>

Is there anyway to get normals on only 1 side of this surface?
http://engineeringnotes.net/Scene.vtp

If you glyph the normals, you'll see they point in both directions. I tried
all of the options in "extract surface normals", but none of them did it.

Thanks,

David

Hi Zhigao,

If you are writing a reader or filter that returns a multi-block data set
you can name a block with the following:


MULTI_BLOCK_DATA_SET->GetMetaData(BLOCK_NUMBER)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"PUT_NAME_HERE");

If you are just using ParaView you can use the "Extract Block" filter and
select the blocks you are interested in.   In the pipeline browser you can
change the name from "ExtractBlock1" to something more meaningful.

Regards,
Paul

Hi Chris,

Use the "Clean to Grid" filter to merge all the duplicate points before
extracting the surface.  So,

    MergeBlocks->Clean to Grid->ExtractSurface->FeatureEdges->Clip

Hi,

ok, this is what wanted to now. I suppose this implies, that my
plugin has to expose a member function of the signature

void GetThetaStartRange(int lower, int upper);

and sets its arguments to the correct values.

As far as "enumerating files' goes, ParaView does indeed group files
together based on some patterns irrespective of the file extensions.
So it should work fine for *.custom files. One advantage of using a
collection file (such as pvd) over just a raw file series is that it's
possible to specify time values of each timestep. If that's not
important, then I'd look at how the xml for "LegacyVTKFileReader" is
written in Servers/ServerManager/Resources/reader.xml if your reader
doesn't already support reading series of files.

The signature should me more like:

vtkGetVector2Macro(StartThetaRange, double);

with:
double StartThetaRange[2];

Have you tried applying "Normal Glyphs" filter? I am not sure if that
filter is available in 3.4, but it is in the CVS version.

Hey David,

Are you sure you don't have a bunch of duplicate points? If you run  
the "Clean" (vtkCleanPolyData) filter to merge coincident points, it  
looks more like there are only normals on one side or the other for  
each point (but they're not all on the same side of the surface).

InsertNextValue will work just fine so long as you are careful about inserting all the components for each tuple.  Most of the time I would recommend using InsertNextTupleValue instead.  However, in either case before filling the array I recommend calling Allocate first so that the memory will already be allocated.  This will make InsertNextValue more efficient because it will not have to reallocate the array.  Alternatively, you can call SetNumberOfComponents and then SetNumberOfTuples and then call SetTupleValue.  The choice between the two approaches is based on how you are using them and your own coding style.

Thank you !
As you described, I can add more than one type of scalars by AddArray(type_name), and the ParaView will distinguish them by
the names I set to them. I've got it.
There is one more question. I use pressure->InsertNextValue(pressure[idx]) to add saclar value to each point . I do not know whether this method is right or there is another method to add the scalar value to each point !
Thanks so much!

You can add more fields by simply adding them to the point data of the output data object.

 output->GetPointData()->AddArray(pressure);

Make sure that you set a name for the arrays (using the SetName method of vtkDataArray).  That is how ParaView/VTK differentiates the fields.

Hi, thanks so much for your help!
I have changed my code just like what you said.
Now, I should add more than one type scalar like pressure, vol1, vol2, vol3 and so on.
So, how can I add these scalars into my output Data?
I have already read these scalars into some variables like m_pressure[numPts], m_vol1[numPts],m_vol[numPts] and m_vol3[numPts], and how can I add these variables into my output Data?
Thanks so much!

What you are using is not quite right.  First, it sounds like you really want to create a vtkImageData.  This data holds a 1D, 2D, or 3D grid of points with origin and uniform spacing on each axis.  Thus, you would inherit from vtkImageAlgorithm and cast your output to vtkImageData.

Second, the only thing you directly set in the output information is the WHOLE_EXTENT().  You do this in RequestInformation so that the downstream pipeline can make decisions about what to load before the data is actually loaded.  So, the first line you have below is correct, assuming you put it in RequestInformation.

Now, you don't set UPDATE_EXTENT, you get it.  Someone downstream will set this the region of data in which it wants you to load.  You don't actually have to get this directly from the output information; you can get it from the output object.  So in RequestData, you would have code like this:

 vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::GetData(outInfo);
  int *extent = output->GetUpdateExtent();

Now you can set the actual extent, spacing, origin, and data itself directly into the data object.

 output->SetExtent(extent);
  output->SetOrigin(origin);
  output->SetSpacing(ar);

You can then set the data either by allocating and getting scalar data through the vtkImageData or by adding data to the image data's point data structure (retrieved with GetPointData()).  More details are in The VTK User's Guide.

Hi, I am writing a custom reader for paraview to read my own data file which paraview hasn't have.
I have known that the most important method is RequestInformation and RequestData, and I just want to write a reader that can output the data type of StructuredPoints with Scalar and some vectors.I have already use :
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
                 0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[1]-1,0,dim[2]-1);
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),

and:outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(), ar, 3);
outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), origin, 3);
and how can I read the scalar data just like the file-format describes:
SCALAR dataName dataType numComp
LOOKUP_TABLE tableName
s0
s1
s2
...
s(n-1)

which method or function can I use to read the s0,s1,...,s(n-1) into the variable and set to the outInfo.
Thanks so much!

I've never seen that before.  My blind guess is that for some reason the spatial bounds of the data are not being computed correctly.

If your point data had global ids, that would probably skip the section of code giving the warning.  Whether that would stop the actual crash, I don't know.

You may want to be clipping the surface, not the feature edges (which should be just lines where the mesh bends sharply).

MergeBlocks->Clean to Grid->ExtractSurface->Clip

Hi,

I would like to extract the surface mesh of a 3D tetrahedral mesh and clip off one boundary to see what is inside. This is to visualize a flow simulation around an object inside a tank.  The tetrahedral mesh is partitioned into 512 subdomains so if you look in the information viewer you see
Multiblock-DataSet
        Block 0
                0: UnstructredGrid
                ...
                511: UnstructuredGrid

So far I've tried MergeBlocks->ExtractSurface->FeatureEdges->Clip and various permutations that I've seen in previous posts and the wiki, but I always end up with the  surfaces on the interior of the tank as if it still sees each subdomain as a closed surface.  I'm sure people do this all the time, but I can't seem to get it right. I'm wondering if I've written the data incorrectly so there is no simple way for paraview to eliminate internal processor boundaries from the domain.

Chris

In fact, it seems to me that ParaView does the best it can. Your
unstructured mesh is partitioned in 512 pieces and [presumably], you did
not specify ghost-cells at the partition boundaries. Without
ghost-cells, ParaView has no information to help decide whether an
outside face looks towards the outside world, or to another partition. I
don't think any combination of filters would help you. Removing
duplicate points may only remove duplicate fake boundaries, but these
fake boundaries must be removed all together.

I use two methods to achieve what you want. Ghost-cells, or another
multi-piece object containing the different boundary types (solid,
symmetries, inflow, outflow, etc) stored as vtkPolyData. These are read
in from the models on disk.

Eric, you were right - I ran clean and that made each point appear to only
have one normal. However, as you said, they still aren't all on the same
side of the surface. Is there no way to make them all point "out"?

Thanks,

Thanks for  the help. I also tried suggestions from Paul, Ken, and  
Berk, but it does seem that I'm stuck right now unless I provide  
ParaView with more information. Since streamlines are computed  
correctly on the current multiblock mesh I just generated the mesh on  
a single processor and used ExtractSurface->Clip on that mesh to  
visualize the geometry around the streamlines from the multiblock grid.

On the first method: Each of my UnstructuredGrids in the Multiblock  
Grid is a subdomain in an overlapping decomposition of the domain.  
Each of the subdomains has several elements of overlap (the layer of  
ghost cells is more than one element thick).  Presumably the  
streamline generation works now on the multiblock grid because the  
overlap is loaded into ParaView. Is there a way I can just set a cell- 
centered attributed to identify the ghost cells so that surface  
extraction and volume visualization will work too?  Currently volume  
visualization of the multiblock grid shows only a single subdomain and  
volume visualization after MergeBlocks shows the whole domain but with  
overlap regions being more opaque.

On your other method, we have both the external boundary mesh and a  
pre-mesh polygonal representation of the boundaries available in the  
simulator. You are suggesting that I just dump one of those to a valid  
ParaView format as well, is that correct?

Message-ID: <E1BD088683EF744ABFB0ED62370BEB8B0F7F6645@ERD-ML4ERD.erd.ds.usace.army.mil>

in the "for what it's worth" file:

is it just me or does the "Resample with Dataset" filter in paraview have the
"Input" & "Source" items backwards from the vtkProbe documentation.

looking at the Resources/filters.xml it looks backwards there too.

the "Input" is tied to the SetSource command and the "Source" is tied to the
SetInput command.

also if anyone is still reading, why not label these with something actually
descriptive
as "Input" and "Source" map to very similar things in most people's heads.

how about:

"Probe Geometry" and "DataSet to probe"

Yes I think you are right. I've been working with this, and it does seem to
be backwards...

      Thanks, Paul...The name part has been done according to your suggestion... The other question still remains:
       
 
      The scenario is that: I have a reader which reads a multiple block data. Each of the data block is a unstructured grid. After i load the data and press the Apply button. The meshes are displayed in the view window which is not what i want. I just want the reader to store the data and a subsequent filter will be used to retrieve the data block by block and display them. The grid needs to be constructed in the reader since all corresponding functions are in the reader. The filter knows nothing about these. Another option is "eyeball" icon in the pipeline browser, is it possible to "turn off" by default? 
     
      What should I do? Setting the block name is for the filter to display the options that the user can choose. Is this the right way to do it?

      Thanks in advance.

Regards,
zhigao

Hi Zhigao,

If you are writing a reader or filter that returns a multi-block data set
you can name a block with the following:


MULTI_BLOCK_DATA_SET->GetMetaData(BLOCK_NUMBER)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"PUT_NAME_HERE");

If you are just using ParaView you can use the "Extract Block" filter and
select the blocks you are interested in.   In the pipeline browser you can
change the name from "ExtractBlock1" to something more meaningful.

Regards,
Paul

Zhigao,

Are you creating your own reader?  If so, why not combine the actual reader and subsequent filter into a single "meta" reader class.  That way ParaView can read in the data and apply the block extraction all in one step.  It should make the user interface easier to use and gets around the problem in question.

Message-ID: <c2f8aa50903310540u2bcbfebewf4b34266da82f8a5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

  Given that there is currently the ability within VTK to export RIB,
how do I enable it if I were to build paraview from source?

Subject: [Paraview] VTK XML Binary Output
Message-ID: <94F73CF1F23B43C096CCE910A36EC616@dm105>

Hello,

I am currently trying to write my own quick output routine to generate a 
binary file using C++. I am currently trying to avoid having to use the vtk 
libraries because I only need a very basic output that doesn't change much. 
I so far have the ASCII output working no problem but I can't get the binary 
working.

I am using file.write() function to output the binary data and that seems to 
be working no problem and when used in a legacy format application it works 
perfectly except that the data is LittleEndian instead of BigEndian. That's 
why I have moved to BigEndian because I don't want to have to make the 
output routine for the data anymore complicated that file.write.

I started using the xml format and considering my output is raw binary and 
not base64 I changed it to be in the AppendedData section instead of 
DataArray. It still isn't working right, I get the following error when I 
try to load in ParaView:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx, line 349
vtkXMLImageDataReader (0ADEC7F8): Error reading extent 0 422 0 242 0 1 from 
piece 0


ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 537
vtkXMLImageDataReader (0ADEC7F8): Cannot read cell data array "pressure" 
from PointData in piece 0.  The data array in the element may be too short.

The format of my output file is as follows:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<ImageData WholeExtent="0 422 0 242 0 1" Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 1">
<Piece Extent="0 422 0 242 0 1">
<PointData>
</PointData>
<CellData Scalars="pressure">
<DataArray type="Float32" Name="pressure" format="appended" offset="0"/>
</CellData>
</Piece>
</ImageData>
<AppendedData encoding="raw">
_BINARYDATA
</AppendedData>
</VTKFile>

Note following an error message I have added an _ at the start of the binary 
data. Is this required?

One final thing, when using appended data, how do you calculate what the 
offset should be?

Thanks
David

The first argument, sz, is the size of the array.  It should equal the number of components times the number of tuples.  The second argument, extSize, can be ignored.  It is the amount of entries that should be added to the array every time a larger one needs to be allocated.  If you make the array big enough to start with, then this parameter will never be used.

I see Allocate method has two parameters, one is the vtkIdType sz, and the other one is vtkIdType extSize. I want to know what are they representing. I know that the extSize may be the number of points in the array. But, what about the first one? And can I use InsertValue instead of InsertNextValue if I call Allocate first?
Thank you  so much!

2009/3/30 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov>
InsertNextValue will work just fine so long as you are careful about inserting all the components for each tuple.  Most of the time I would recommend using InsertNextTupleValue instead.  However, in either case before filling the array I recommend calling Allocate first so that the memory will already be allocated.  This will make InsertNextValue more efficient because it will not have to reallocate the array.  Alternatively, you can call SetNumberOfComponents and then SetNumberOfTuples and then call SetTupleValue.  The choice between the two approaches is based on how you are using them and your own coding style.

As you described, I can add more than one type of scalars by AddArray(type_name), and the ParaView will distinguish them by
the names I set to them. I've got it.
There is one more question. I use pressure->InsertNextValue(pressure[idx]) to add saclar value to each point . I do not know whether this method is right or there is another method to add the scalar value to each point !
Thanks so much!

You can add more fields by simply adding them to the point data of the output data object.

 output->GetPointData()->AddArray(pressure);

Make sure that you set a name for the arrays (using the SetName method of vtkDataArray).  That is how ParaView/VTK differentiates the fields.

What you are using is not quite right.  First, it sounds like you really want to create a vtkImageData.  This data holds a 1D, 2D, or 3D grid of points with origin and uniform spacing on each axis.  Thus, you would inherit from vtkImageAlgorithm and cast your output to vtkImageData.

Second, the only thing you directly set in the output information is the WHOLE_EXTENT().  You do this in RequestInformation so that the downstream pipeline can make decisions about what to load before the data is actually loaded.  So, the first line you have below is correct, assuming you put it in RequestInformation.

Now, you don't set UPDATE_EXTENT, you get it.  Someone downstream will set this the region of data in which it wants you to load.  You don't actually have to get this directly from the output information; you can get it from the output object.  So in RequestData, you would have code like this:

 vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::GetData(outInfo);
  int *extent = output->GetUpdateExtent();

Now you can set the actual extent, spacing, origin, and data itself directly into the data object.

 output->SetExtent(extent);
  output->SetOrigin(origin);
  output->SetSpacing(ar);

You can then set the data either by allocating and getting scalar data through the vtkImageData or by adding data to the image data's point data structure (retrieved with GetPointData()).  More details are in The VTK User's Guide.

I assume you are referring to the Doxygen of the classes located at http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.2/html/.  There is some trickery in the vtkDataArray classes like vtkDoubleArray and vtkIntArray to make them seem like they inherit directly from vtkDataArray when in fact they really inherit from vtkDataArrayTemplate.  The Allocate method is in vtkDataArrayTemplate and is also available in vtkDoubleArray/vtkIntArray regardless of what the documentation tells you.

InsertNextValue is really just a convienience method that is the equivalent of calling InsertValue with an index at the end of the array.  Thus, in your example below the two will behave the same.  However, if you are preallocating the data and computing indices anyway, I personally prefer the following code for readability, although there should be no real impact to performance.

 vtkIntArray *castkey = vtkIntArray::New();
  castkey->SetName("cast_type");
  castkey->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
  castkey->SetNumberOfTuples(numPts);
  for (int i = 0; i < L; i++)
    {
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++)
      {
      for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)
        {
        int idx = i*M*N+j*N+k;
        castkey->SetTupleValue(idx, &(sgn.GetData()[idx]));
        }
      }
    }
  output->GetPointData()->AddArray(castkey);
  castkey->Delete(); // Does not really delete, just decrement reference count.

Message-ID: <f4795db30903310845h1c07fb3r68be3f62a7ddf971@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

It has been a while since I have been using paraview for the last time and
it looks quite different now.

I just tried loading a set of image volumes in mhd/raw format. My files are
named:

d1.mhd
d2.mhd
d3.mhd

and so on.

I thought that way I could load time resolved data and for a set of vtk
files it works just fine .

Is it possible to do it with the mhd files as well? If yes, what is my
mistake, because I always only get the first file loaded.


  Thanks in advance,

    Thomas

Message-ID: <a080431a0903311003q5a86b648rfc0aa3a7e17085cd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all

     I just start to learn Paraview and use this tool to display some 3D
images. The version I use is 3.2.1.

    Now I meet a problem: After loading a 3D labeled image, I try to use the
threshold filter to display the labeled region with different color. If the
"all scalar" option is selected, the regions can be displayed in different
color, but seems to be a litter smaller. If the "All scalar" is not
selected, the regions are just displayed in the same color. My question is:
how to display the regions with different color in the non "all scalar"
mode?

   So could anyone help me?


   Thanks.

    I am using ParaView to edit VTK files I generated from another software. The VTK is reconstructed from parallel CT images. What I need to do is to erase those features (bones, lungs etc) I don't want.

    The problem is that ParaView crashes when I select a portion of the 3D object before I can delete the portion. The message window is always covered  by the microsoft 'send error report' window and I can not get the message out. The Output Messages from the ParaView are:

(I'm cc'ing back to the ParaView mailing list so others can see and comment.)

OK.  I'm able to replicate the problem by creating a large data set with the Wavelet source.  What I suspect is happening is that ParaView is generating a wireframe representation of the selected cells.  The wireframe is taking up a lot of memory (quite possibly more than the original data).  ParaView should try to avoid this, so I have submitted a bug:

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=8827

However, even if this bug were fixed, I suspect you will still run into inevitable memory crashes.  There are a couple of issues.  First, any time a filter does a topology change, for example by removing some cells, the filter must create a new data object to represent the new topology.  Thus, you will need to have enough memory to hold the original and the modified data at the same time.  The second issue is that if you remove some arbitrary cells from a structured data, the resulting mesh must be represented with an unstructured data type.  Unstructured data needs to have explicit topology defined, which takes many times more memory than its structured counterpart.  Thus, the "reduced" mesh could easily take up more memory.

I recommend finding another way to look at a specific potion of your data.  One way is to use volume rendering and try to set the uninteresting cells to have a zero opacity.  Another way is to try to extract polygonal surfaces in the area you want to see.  The slice and contour filters are often good at this.  For more information on what filters you should and shouldn't use on large data, take a look at the section on "Avoiding Data Explosion" in the SC08 ParaView tutorial, which is posted on the ParaView Wiki.

Ken,
     Thanks for your help. As I said, my data files are pretty big. One is 26MB and another one is 129MB. How do I send or upload the files?
     The steps to cause crashing is simply:
1. Install ParaView;
2. Launch ParaView;
3. File-> Open, to open the VTK file;
4. At left bottom portion, click 'Apply', and at the right side, a 3D object is shown. I can use the mouse to drag and rotate.
5. Go to Edit->Select Cells Through, then I will drag a square on the 3D object to select the portion I want to erase.
6. Crash happened with the incomplete error message.

Thanks,

Ryan

Hi Thorsten,

That's really helpful. I don't quite know how to write out the number of bits as a char? If you could explain a way of how to do that it would be greatly appreciated. 

Also, how do I calculate what value goes in for the offset? I had a look at a couple of output files from paraview and it wasnt obvious how it was calculated.

Thanks
David

Hello,

the solution might be to append your data as

< DataArray ... format="appended">
</DataArray>
< AppendedData encoding="raw">
_NNNNData 
</AppendedData>
where you should replace NNNN with a four 
byte integer containing the number of bytes 
in the data array as 4 chars.
Setting the encoding to "raw" tells ParaView, that
the data is simply a stream of bytes rather than 
base64 encoded.
If you want to write Image I can supply a small
writer project for 2D data.

  Hello,

  I am currently trying to write my own quick output routine to generate a 
  binary file using C++. I am currently trying to avoid having to use the vtk 
  libraries because I only need a very basic output that doesn't change much. 
  I so far have the ASCII output working no problem but I can't get the binary 
  working.

  I am using file.write() function to output the binary data and that seems to 
  be working no problem and when used in a legacy format application it works 
  perfectly except that the data is LittleEndian instead of BigEndian. That's 
  why I have moved to BigEndian because I don't want to have to make the 
  output routine for the data anymore complicated that file.write.

  I started using the xml format and considering my output is raw binary and 
  not base64 I changed it to be in the AppendedData section instead of 
  DataArray. It still isn't working right, I get the following error when I 
  try to load in ParaView:

  ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx, line 349
  vtkXMLImageDataReader (0ADEC7F8): Error reading extent 0 422 0 242 0 1 from 
  piece 0


  ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 537
  vtkXMLImageDataReader (0ADEC7F8): Cannot read cell data array "pressure" 
  from PointData in piece 0.  The data array in the element may be too short.

  The format of my output file is as follows:

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <ImageData WholeExtent="0 422 0 242 0 1" Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 1">
  <Piece Extent="0 422 0 242 0 1">
  <PointData>
  </PointData>
  <CellData Scalars="pressure">
  <DataArray type="Float32" Name="pressure" format="appended" offset="0"/>
  </CellData>
  </Piece>
  </ImageData>
  <AppendedData encoding="raw">
  _BINARYDATA
  </AppendedData>
  </VTKFile>

  Note following an error message I have added an _ at the start of the binary 
  data. Is this required?

  One final thing, when using appended data, how do you calculate what the 
  offset should be?

  Thanks
  David

Hi, Ken
        Thanks for your reply.
         
        Yes, i am using my own reader. Currently all the blocks are constructed in the reader. And all the blocks are display in the view after pressing the Apply button. But the user would only expect to see one block each time. If i combine reader and filter together, i would have to open the data several times to see all different blocks(they need to compare with each other) which is not the way i want. Currently i have two options. Option one is that: reader stores all the data and subsequent filter retrieves block by block and construct the mesh accordingly. Option Two: The reader stores all data and constructed all the meshes but make them invisible to the user. Subsequent filter will retrieve block by block and display them. 
  
        But neither way i do not know how to do it? Or it has the third or even more options?

Regards,
zhigao

Zhigao,

Are you creating your own reader?  If so, why not combine the actual reader and subsequent filter into a single "meta" reader class.  That way ParaView can read in the data and apply the block extraction all in one step.  It should make the user interface easier to use and gets around the problem in question.

     Thanks, Paul...The name part has been done according to your suggestion... The other question still remains:


      The scenario is that: I have a reader which reads a multiple block data. Each of the data block is a unstructured grid. After i load the data and press the Apply button. The meshes are displayed in the view window which is not what i want. I just want the reader to store the data and a subsequent filter will be used to retrieve the data block by block and display them. The grid needs to be constructed in the reader since all corresponding functions are in the reader. The filter knows nothing about these. Another option is "eyeball" icon in the pipeline browser, is it possible to "turn off" by default?

      What should I do? Setting the block name is for the filter to display the options that the user can choose. Is this the right way to do it?

      Thanks in advance.

zhigao

Hi Zhigao,

If you are writing a reader or filter that returns a multi-block data set
you can name a block with the following:


MULTI_BLOCK_DATA_SET->GetMetaData(BLOCK_NUMBER)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"PUT_NAME_HERE");

If you are just using ParaView you can use the "Extract Block" filter and
select the blocks you are interested in.   In the pipeline browser you can
change the name from "ExtractBlock1" to something more meaningful.

Regards,
Paul
