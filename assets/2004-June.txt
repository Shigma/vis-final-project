Hi Koichiro,

I've had the same problem with paraview 1.2.1.
It is due to old X11 header provided with Solaris 8.

The easiest way to bypass the error is to set the environement variables :
CXXFLAGS=-fpermissive
CCFLAGS=-fpermissive

Then this error becomes a warning and everything goes fine.

Another solution is to download a patch from sun (http://www.sunsolve.com)
that fixes the 'old' X11 headers.

Best regards,

-- Julien

 Can we make paraview with /usr/openwin ?
 Or do we have to use the latest X11 ?

I really appreciate your reply.

 The "-fpermissive" option is effective.
 I can compile and execute paraview-1.4.2 on Solaris8 today!
 Wonderfull!

just the information to build the model no more? Thanks for any help.

I have no solution, just wanted to say that I am facing the same problem
with animations and VTK-files (have not tried with Paraview format). The
slowness seem to be related to the number of time steps, as 150 time
steps gives much faster time increments than say 350. 
I am however thankful that it works at all in 1.4.2. Previously you
could not, at least to my knowledge, create animations with over 100
time steps.

So does anyone have anythoughts on this?  I just tried setting my

I am afraid you can't do that with current ParaView. However, I think
that it is a good idea and we should add something similar to
<Library name=""> or modify it to load Tcl shared libraries on the
client side (note that the ClientServer wrapped libraries have to be
loaded only on the server side).

Hi Berk, hi everyone,

Actually, I am writing vtk filters and a ParaView widgets.

My widget vtkPVMy3DWidget inherits from vtkPV3DWidget.
When it creates all the Tk widgets in the Property panel of the notebook, I
need to call first this->Script("package require vtkmy3dwidgets") before
creating a button with a callback command that is a member of
vtkPVMy3DWidget. Otherwise the callback generates an error when I press the
button.

My class is wrapped in Tcl but this wrapping is not loaded automatically.
 
A better question would be "Is there a way in PV 1.4.2 to load the Tcl
wrapping of an external library when loading the Client/Server wrapped
library?".


Anyway, I am not at all stuck with it, I just wanted to know if there was a
more elegant way to load my TCL wrapped library.

All I get when I try to use Paraview 1.4 is a white screen where my data 
should be displayed. I do a cut through a 3D data set. It generates a 
colorbar with endpoints matching the data but the display doesn't match 
the colorbar. When I turn contours on they look right. But the display 
itself  just gives is  a white plane when I do the cut. Before the cut 
the is just a box.

It looks like the property value is covering other things. I can change 
the color from white by changing the action color when I switch to property.

  I'm using hdf5 data. I tried transforming it to vtk but it didn't make 
a difference.

Message-ID: <20040605201546.1D07.SUZ@mito.ssd.ssg.fujitsu.com>

Hello All..

 I am looking for the way to operate Paraview by script interactively.

 Paraview has a batch option, but it's not interactive.
 If the "interactive operation by script" is realized , for example,
we can operate Paraview from CGI(web).

 If there were good ideas, please tell me..
 Best regards.

 I found an idea.

 Paraview (--batch) reads a .pvb file and evaluate it's all lines by
Tcl_EvalFile().
 (GUI/Client/vtkPVApplication.cxx line 1436, GUI/Widgets/vtkKWApplication.cxx line 1321)

 Apply following process instead of this and interactive operation is
realized.
  1) reads a script from stdin.
  2) evaluate the script by Tcl_Eval().
     (call Tcl_Eval() every reading a special line for example "###".)

 Thanks all.

the colorbar. When I turn contours on they look right. But the display

Message-ID: <16F54D8E44BBEE4BBBDB5EFB3AEEB86D01B6F850@es06snlnt.sandia.gov>

Hi,

I'm trying to compile ParaView on a 64-bit SGI, and I'm running into
problems with the Tcl/Tk libraries. When I try to build ParaView, I get the
following error:

ld64: FATAL   12 : Expecting 64-bit objects:
/Build/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/libtcl8.4.a is 32-bit.

I have BUILD_SHARED_LIBS turned on, am using cc and CC as compilers, and am
passing the -64 option for 64 bit compiling to the compiler and linker. It
seems like I need to pass a 64 bit flag to the Tcl configure scripts, but I
couldn't find anything in the cmake configuration about that.

Any help would be appreciated,

Thanks,
Dave Karelitz

So given just the points and values it will do what i am thinking? 
 Right now i have just paraview installed, do i need to install VTK as 
well and then use it to generate the vtk file from my input?

There is no need to install VTK. This is all built-in (in the paraview 
executable).

You will need to create a vtk compatible input file from your data. Go 
file->open data and see what formats it supports. You will need to use a 
cell based format.

Message-ID: <QAG06771@awe.co.uk>

Hi,

When compiling v1.4.2 using gcc v2.96 I get errors because there are return
statements a function that has no return type. The function concerned is:

void pvTestDriver::CollectConfiguredOptions()
{
...
  return -1;
...
}

If I alter the return type to int instead of void (in files
/GUI/Client/pvTestDriver.h and /GUI/Client/pvTestDriver.cxx) Paraview
compiles.

Is anyone aware of this problem and is my solution a 'safe' thing to do?

Regards
Rupert.

The program seems to be a test driver to be used in combination with 
Dart (automated testing) so paraview should operate fine without it.

Still seems to be a bug though ...

YOu seem to know alot about what you are talking about so let me show 
you what i am working with and you can give me some ideas maybe:
I have this program that outputs data and the followoing format:
ITEM: NUMBER OF CELLS
1380
ITEM: CELLS
111 0 0 0 -1 0.75 0.75 0
112 0 0 0.75 -1 0.75 1.5 0
113 0 0.75 0.75 -1 1.5 1.5 0
114 0 0.75 0 -1 1.5 0.75 0
115 0 0 0 0 0.75 0.75 1
116 0 0 0.75 0 0.75 1.5 1

.....TO the number of cells, one line per cell

ITEM: NUMBER OF POINTS
1914
ITEM: POINTS
0 0 0 -1 -3
1 0 0.75 -1 -3
2 0.75 0.75 -1 -2.66927
3 0.75 0 -1 -3
4 0 0 0 -2
5 0 0.75 0 -2
6 0.75 0.75 0 -2
7 0.75 0 0 -2
8 0 1.5 -1 -2.87228
....

THe cells are formated like the following:
<id> < procid > < xmin> < xmax > <ymin> <ymax> <zmin><zmax>
and the points like:
<id><x><y><z><level set value>


Any idea on how when give this data, produce a vtk file that paraview 
will read and generate the iso-surfaces and make the 3d model?  Thank 
you for your help or input.

Aha. I assumed the level set values were on the cell vertices.

They are not? Or are they and is just the ordering different? Can you 
output/calculate the level set values at the cell vertices?

This goes a bit beyond my knowledge but
- maybe vtk can do interpolation from points (level set) to another set 
of points (cell vertices)

- in which case you would need to write your points + level set data to 
one file, and your geometry to another and find the vtk filter that does 
that for you.

- do you know which cell your level set point is in. In which case you 
might output your level set data as cell_data on an unstructured grid 
and use paraview to interpolate to the vertices. This will ofcourse 
loose you some accuracy (interpolation usually assumes the cell data is 
located at the cell centre)

- maybe you can construct the surface directly from the point. I.e. 
triangulate the points. vtk has a triangulation routine but I am not 
sure it is mapped through into Paraview.

Message-ID: <5629C3F943FB7F42BF6DBB5DAAC56102135207@mucse204.muc.infineon.com>

Hi all,

as far a I understand it is possible to compile vtk, tcl/tk, and
paraview on MaxOS X (10.3.4)...? However, I'm not a very experienced
programmer or terminal-geek - and that is an understatement. Wouldn't it
be possible to provide a paraview version as binary also for MacOS X,
just as for Windows, Linux, etc.? It really would make life easier for
us billions of Mac users out there... ;-)  
And if for some reason it's unpractical to do so, can anybody help me in
getting paraview up & running on my mac? Thanks a lot in advance!

Georg Icking-Konert

Well, in ParaView I noticed that the point color array is not loaded
and points have all the same color (white).
So, my question is:  Is not yet implemented Wrl PointSet coloring in
ParaView ?

Second Question: Is just implemented the Extrusion Wrl node ?
That because I have a ParaView crash loading a simple Extrusion Wrl.

Third: How is possible to export to Wrl from ParaView ?  It needed
to set menus or other ?


Very Best Regards

Roberto,
Make sure the point data attribute array you create in your reader has a 
name.  ParaView ignores any array without a name.

Henry,
You will have to write a reader that uses a point locator to merge the 
points and the cell vertices.

Hi,

regarding the third question, is it possible to export VRML
from ParaView, and if, how? That would interest me, too?!

Hello,

Does anyone know how to change the color of the text for the 
'orientation axes'? (the coord system display in the bottom left)

The problem is that if I change the background colour to white I also 
lose the axis names ('x', 'y', 'z') since they are white by default.

Regards,

Mattijs

Hi Mattijs,

There is not currently a way to do this, but it should not be difficult to 
add this functionality.  I'll look into it.

Subject: [Paraview] Loading binary Ensight data form Paraview
Message-ID: <40D6EB4E.5020509@imft.fr>

Dear All;

I am a really beginner in using ParaView.
I use a Fortran solver which generates binary Ensiht6 data. Paraview 
reads *.case file but doesn't read geometry file and result files. If I 
use ascii files, there is no problem.
Is it possible to read binary ensight file generated by Fortran solver 
using ensight reader of paraview?
Does anyone know how to do this and could give me an example of Fortran 
program doing this?

Best Regards,

Herve NEAU

Dear paraview users,

I have a question about gl2ps. I changed the paraview compilation 
options to compile vtk with gl2ps. Now I would like to be able to use 
that from paraview. Anyone knows how to?

- I saw there is a vtkGL2PSExporter.cxx exporting module so I assume I 
have to use that. Is there a way of writing an xml wrapper to put into 
the paraview filters? I tried grepping for a reference to any other 
vtkExporter module in paraview but couldn't find one.

Regards,

Mattijs

I have got legacy VTK files with point and cell data on polygons. In 
1.4.2 I can visualize both point and cell data ok but if I use the cvs 
version (from 16/6/4) I cannot visualize the cell data (point data is ok).

Attached is a small test file which should have the same behaviour. Look 
at field 'p' which should be both in point and in cell format.

(my cvs version was compiled with gl2ps support switched on but I don't 
expect that to mess up the standard rendering)

Anyone any ideas? Known 'feature'?

Regards,

Mattijs

Mattijs,

This is a bug.  I confirmed that ParaView does not color by vector cell 
attributes properly.  You can get around this by using the array calculator 
to generate a one component cell attribute which will color properly.

Charles.

Dear paraview developers,

I have the same problem using a scalar cell attribute.

(I would not care too much about a vector cell attribute since as you 
said you can work around it)

Regards,

Mattijs

p.s. some positive feedback as well: I am really enjoying paraview! None 
of the weirdness / inconsistencies of some other postprocessors.

Subject: [Paraview] cell data on polygonal cells
Message-ID: <4EB6E1738CC2E940BAD2EFBFBF5A38F101C3B227@OREADE.ipsn.fr>


Hi,

A few month ago I had some problems displaying cell scalars: it was because
the checkbox "Use triangle strip" was checked.
Using "Immediate Mode Rendering" made things work well.

Maybe it will help...

Dear paraview developers,

I have the same problem using a scalar cell attribute.

(I would not care too much about a vector cell attribute since as you 
said you can work around it)

Regards,

Mattijs

p.s. some positive feedback as well: I am really enjoying paraview! None 
of the weirdness / inconsistencies of some other postprocessors.

Is there a way to make the resolution of the Iso-surface generation, 
higher, as in better quality.  So that it is not just flat planes, but 
some curved surfaces as well?
Thank you

The "resolution" of an iso-surface is entirely dependent on the cell
(element) size of the input. The iso-surface filter will generate one
polygon per each appropriate cell. There are a few ways of making this
iso-surface look smoother.
1. Use normals. In some cases, the iso-surface filter will generate
normals. In cases it doesn't, you can use the "Normals Generation"
filter. The result this filter produces is not as nice as what the
contour filter can do but it's better than nothing.
2. Use subdivision (and normals). Try loop subdivision and normals
generation.

Hi,
 
I may be able to help you a little bit. First, you have to let paraview
know that 
you want to use the vtkDelaunay2D or 3D filter. This is done permanently
(there are 
some instances in the mailing list where people talk about this) for
example 
by creating a xml-file with the content (below) in a directory called
e.g. "extensions"
in your paraview installation directory. Then you have to point the
environment
variable PV_INTERFACE_PATH to that file location. If you only want to
use this
filter sporadically, then I think it is enough to "import package" the
xml-file.
This should make the filter available in paraview (given the right data
format, I think).
I am not sure what the structure of your VRML point cloud is, I use
polydata such as this example
 
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Example data
ASCII 
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 1000 float
11.71441 -0.29446 -0.06840
11.51223 -0.26540 -0.00054
11.31058 -0.24298 0.00603
11.10758 -0.28167 0.00724
10.90453 -0.27109 0.00207
.....
 
 
and it works fine for me. If you consult the vtk description of the
Delaunay filter, that might help.
You can then play around with the parameters in the usual way.
Alternatively, I sometimes use MayaVi, where you simply enter
vtkDelaunay2D in the 
UserDefined Filter window pop-up. Worth trying. 
 
Hope that helps.
 
Axel

Of course, there is a way to activate the saving of PVD files in ASCII mode in ParaView.

But...  how ?

Somebody can help me to set it, so I can read coordinate (and other) of objects from the

Thank you in advance

Subject: [Paraview] Problems Creating a Reader
Message-ID: <20040625154941.15992.qmail@web60104.mail.yahoo.com>

Needless to say, I am a new Paraview/Vtk user.  I am
trying to create my own reader in C++ that I can plug
into Paraview.  When I try to import the reader, I get
an error saying that the _Initialize function cannot
be found in the library.  From what I've seen on the
mailing list, I believe that I need to add
client-server wrappings.  How is this best done?  I am
using Paraview 1.4.2 on Redhat Linux.

Does anyone have an example CMakeLists.txt that I can
use to create the reader and an xml file that I can
use to load the reader?

Any other tips are welcome.
