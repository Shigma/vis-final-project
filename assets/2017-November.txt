Subject: [Paraview] basal surfaces to 3D volume
Message-ID: <CAHhX17ftNe7CKa7w7eOiWj5QNRsh4ZYrjwXCGhNgL9tqNQbq1g@mail.gmail.com>

Alright, bare with me...

I have a series of 3D surfaces that represent the base of specific,
discrete, layers in a 3D volume. I have a top surface which bounds the
volume.  Specifically, I'm trying to create a 3D model of a mountain. The
top surface defines the topography, and all those basal surfaces define the
bottoms of specific rock-units.

I can load all these into paraview (they're just individual netcdf files
now), and visualize the separate surfaces.

What I want to do is to, for each basal surface, interpolate this unit
vertically-upward until it reaches the next overlying surface. So I can go
from a series of surfaces to an actual populated 3D structured/unstructured
grid.

I could do this by brute force in python, (interpolating all planes as
points into a 3D volume then, starting at the base of the model, looping
through each cell in the volume and extending it upwards) but was curious
if there might be a more elegant way (either in paraview or VTK).

Did that make any sense?

To whom it may concern,

     I hope you are well. My name is Zhenlin Pei. Now I want to plot structural evolution in circle via Paraview 5.4.1 64-bit.

     I have a question about visualization in Paraview. I find your contact information online: https://www.paraview.org/services/


  1.  Paraview can open the file time_phi_50_Square.vtk whose shape is square. But Paraview has stopped working when I try to open the file time_phi_50_Circle.vtk whose shape is circle.
  2.  Actually, I apply Vim diff to check the difference between the 2 files. The difference between 2 files are the coordinates and number of points, one file is for shape square, the other file is for shape circle. Value in LOOKUP_TABLE is the same: 0.5.
  3.  I apply Excel to plot the shape based on the coordinates from time_phi_50_Circle.vtk.
  4.  Please refer to the captures below or onedrive online (including the full *.vtk files): https://1drv.ms/f/s!AJ_QiTly3Pr5gWY
  5.  Can you help me to find the reason or solution, please?



Thank you very much.

Hi Pei,

It is very likely that your circle.vtk file is an invalid/corrupt VTK
file.  That reader doesn't always handle bad files gracefully and often
when you have a crash reading a .vtk file it means that the file itself is
bad.  Can you share the file with the mailing list?  Maybe someone will
have time to debug through and find out why it is crashing (aka what part
of the file is bad).

Hi Shawn,

     Thank you for your reply. I shared the *.vtk files from OneDrive in the previous message: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AJ_QiTly3Pr5gWY<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2F1drv.ms%2Ff%2Fs!AJ_QiTly3Pr5gWY&data=02%7C01%7Cpei%40knights.ucf.edu%7C61770355b499405469e108d5215dfb79%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C636451609893834739&sdata=atHTsRMxm1zyr%2FoB90u39BRJk8VJawxVd%2BZA1cyiKA8%3D&reserved=0>. Actually, I tried to attached the full *.vtk files to the message, but I received the auto message, please refer to the capture below.
     How do I share the *.vtk via mailing list directly, please? It is my first time to use Paraview mailing list. I try to familiar with the skills asap. Thank you very much.

Utkarsh,

So apparenly that limit is so low that a 32KB screenshot will trigger it.
I think something is messed up with the list.

Pei,

Here is the screenshot I was trying to send:

Subject: [Paraview] quantifying overlap between two volumes
Message-ID: <2ebe1d42f4aa4f9586fe2a2aca5dcc94@ICTS-S-EXMBX17.luna.kuleuven.be>

To whom it may concern,

I just started working with Paraview for making 3D-images of the brain. More specifically, I want to quantify the overlap between the brain activation there is for some fMRI-task (one .vtk file) and some coordinates I have (separate .vtk files). Does anyone can advise how to start with this? I've been searching on the internet but I cannot find a clear answer to this question.

Many many thanks in advance!

Best
Klara Schevenels

Klara--

Have you tried to load both one.vtk and separate.vtk into a single 
render window? ParaView is quite capable of doing this.? If the 
"reference file" separate.vtk image needs to be shifted, the transform 
filter will let you re-position the image.

Hope this helps.

Hi there, I would like to include some additional information about the parameters that I'm using in my simulation in the file, I thought that the  Information tag was useful in this scenario. but when I try to use them Paraview crashes. is there any other technique that I could use? I already try <!-- --> for comments but Paraview will crash anyway.


Thank you very much for your help

Hi Shawn,

     Thank you for your reply. Now I have one more question besides the issue ?stop working?. I don?t know why the circle has some ?sawtooth edge? ?

I loaded your file in the a ParaView build from a few weeks ago (I had it on hand).  It didn't crash for me, but I don't think your file is correct, and I wouldn't be surprised if I just got lucky.  I'm attaching a screenshot of what it looked like.

My recommendation would be to make a much smaller file and make sure you have the exporting to VTK working right before going back to your large dataset.

Hi Pei,
It is very likely that your circle.vtk file is an invalid/corrupt VTK file.  That reader doesn't always handle bad files gracefully and often when you have a crash reading a .vtk file it means that the file itself is bad.  Can you share the file with the mailing list?  Maybe someone will have time to debug through and find out why it is crashing (aka what part of the file is bad).

  1.  Paraview can open the file time_phi_50_Square.vtk whose shape is square. But Paraview has stopped working when I try to open the file time_phi_50_Circle.vtk whose shape is circle.
  2.  Actually, I apply Vim diff to check the difference between the 2 files. The difference between 2 files are the coordinates and number of points, one file is for shape square, the other file is for shape circle. Value in LOOKUP_TABLE is the same: 0.5.
  3.  I apply Excel to plot the shape based on the coordinates from time_phi_50_Circle.vtk.
  4.  Please refer to the captures below or onedrive online (including the full *.vtk files): https://1drv.ms/f/s!AJ_QiTly3Pr5gWY<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2F1drv.ms%2Ff%2Fs!AJ_QiTly3Pr5gWY&data=02%7C01%7Cpei%40knights.ucf.edu%7C61770355b499405469e108d5215dfb79%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C636451609893834739&sdata=atHTsRMxm1zyr%2FoB90u39BRJk8VJawxVd%2BZA1cyiKA8%3D&reserved=0>
  5.  Can you help me to find the reason or solution, please?



Thank you very much.

Hello,


I'm trying to run the following example

https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode-MOVED-/blob/master/PythonFullExample/cpscript.py


on MacOs sierra using Paraview 5.4.1, I'm getting the following error


File "cpstate.py", line 1, in <module>
    from paraview.simple import *
ImportError: No module named paraview.simple


I tried doing the following:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1.app/Contents/bin

But that did not fix it, are there are other paths I should include? or anyway to get around this error?

Thanks!

Really sorry but this dropped off my radar. Thanks for raising an issue and
sharing this code snippet below.

Utkarsh,

Again, thanks again for the comment and sorry for missing the email. I am
checking my filter rules as this didn't get through to my inbox.

Your insight was quite right: it's all down to drivers. I've been working on
PV with EGL since then and I can get it all work under Ubuntu POWER8 NVIDIA
driver but not under RHEL. There seems to be a packaging problem in RHEL where
presumably an older or flawed version of EGL is shipped. I've been promised a
fix soon so I am waiting for this.

I've got access to two clusters with K80s and P100s and my intention is to run
EGL enabled PV on both of them. X-less config is ideal as I could make any node
act as a PV server. I'll keep you posted.

Message-ID: <DB3PR08MB0107436FE38410E742EA4FCE975D0@DB3PR08MB0107.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,


I built paraview 5.4 from the repo https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/Documentation/dev/git/download.md on MacOS Sierra


I'm trying to run the PythonFullExample downloaded from here     https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/tree/master/Examples/Catalyst/PythonFullExample


I run it as the following:


export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/Users/a/ParaView/paraview_build/lib

export PYTHONPATH=/Users/a/ParaView/paraview_build/lib/site-packages


/Users/a/ParaView/paraview_build/bin/pvpython fedriver.py cpscript.py

I connect to Catalyst, then I get an error 'Must use ParaView v4.2 or greater'

Any guide on how to solve this?

Hi Sam,

Thanks again for your answer! I included a printscreen of an image I have been working on to clear things up. The purple regions are brain activations for a fMRI-task and are all combined into one vtk file. The coordinates are the spheres in different colors and each have their own vtk file.

Enjoy your weekend!

Best,
Klara

Klara--

I am sure there are several ways to do this, unfortunately you will need to supply the list with more information about the nature of the datum set.

If your two *.vtk files have matching points (same number and same coordinates) you can use the Append Data filter to combine the two datum sets. However the two datum sets will have to have different variable names for the POINT values. Use either a text editor on one of the *.vtk files to change the variable name, or use the Calculator filter to rename the variables from one of the *.vtk datum sets before you use the Append Data filter.

With the merged datum sets, you can then use the Calculator filter to computer the difference in the two values and give the difference a new name.

Hope this helps.

Hi Sam

Thank you very much for your response! I loaded all of the files in the same window, so the visualization is quite good. But I'd like to become a quantification of how much overlap there is between the reference activation and the coordinates I have (like a % or something).
You think you have any ideas on that?

Have you tried to load both one.vtk and separate.vtk into a single render window? ParaView is quite capable of doing this.  If the "reference file" separate.vtk image needs to be shifted, the transform filter will let you re-position the image.

Hope this helps.

I just started working with Paraview for making 3D-images of the brain. More specifically, I want to quantify the overlap between the brain activation there is for some fMRI-task (one .vtk file) and some coordinates I have (separate .vtk files). Does anyone can advise how to start with this? I've been searching on the internet but I cannot find a clear answer to this question.

Many many thanks in advance!

Klara--

If you want to get all of this information into one datum set so that 
you can use PV's Calculator filter, one possibility is use the PV's 
Resample With Dataset. (I am not a heavy user of this filter, but I 
tried it once and it work like a charm.) It would be best if you 
consulted the on-line? documentation (at least easily accessed in PV 
version 5.2.0 by F1), PDF page 93. If you use a fairly fine background 
mesh, it should serve your needs. You may have to use the Group Datasets 
filter first?

You might consider using a ParaView *.pvd file (pvd is short for 
'ParaView Data'). It should make your file handling a little easier. I 
have attached a sample *.pvd file that could make the task easier. 
However, your individual VTK files will have to have an XML-format for 
this to work.

Subject: [Paraview] quantifying overlap between two volumes
Message-ID: <BN3PR0701MB16873A07CD63F92AD3DB73F19F500@BN3PR0701MB1687.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Klara,

I have an idea but it's pretty rough - see what you can make of it.

Assume the MRI volume is highly refined - let's use this as the base mesh - I think for this both the MRI and the circles have to be volume meshed, not just surfaces.

Take your purple regions and assign a Point variable of MRI and assign a value of 1

For each of your circles, assign a Point variable - let's assign a variable of "circle" and assign a value of 1 - n, where n is number of circles

Now use Resample with Dataset using one of your meshed spheres as input and MRI as source - now you have a MRI cloud that has some elements with a circle value of 0 and some with a circle value of 1 (for circle #1).    Threshold on circle value between .5 and 1 and you will get a subset of elements in circle 1 that are enclosed by the MRI cloud.  Calculate the volume in the python calculator.   Compare to volume of entire sphere (they all look like the same size, so you probably know total volume of sphere).    This gives you % of circle that is inclosed by MRI cloud.

I haven't tried it but you can probably combine all the circles and the MRI cloud using resample - maybe try Group Datasets on the spheres first.   You could then get volume of MRI cloud with circle > 0 and compare to total volume of MRI cloud if you wanted that percentage.

Part I don't know at all is how to volume mesh these parts if you have them only as surfaces.

Not a polished answer, but food for thought.

Hope this helps
Dennis

Hi Ken,

I I can load a bunch of .nrrd volume scans into ParaView as one unit. But
when I play the animation, the animation only stays at the first volume and
would not proceed.

The reason may be that the files do not have time step information. In the
"information" tab, the "Time" table of my 4d stack is empty.

Is there an easy way to fix this? I used ImageJ to create those images.

It looks like the NRRD reader does not support time series. I wrote up a bug (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17820), but in the mean time you could try a different image format. You could try either raw or tiff format.

Hi,

Thank you very much for your reply. It seems that I would have to deal with the input data once again.

Is there a way for the surface to be modified in such way that you have stated? Would you suggested starting to look at vtk/CGAL codes or something similar?

First before answering your question, let me alert you to an easier way to load your data into ParaView. First, name your files with numbers just before the extension (e.g. left_ventricle_00.stl, left_ventricle_01.stl, left_ventricle_02.stl, etc.). Then just load this file series as one unit (they will be grouped in the ParaView file browser) and ParaView will automatically animate them; no need to add them manually with the Animation View.

Now the bad news. I don't think the Temporal Interpolator is going to work with your data. The Temporal Interpolator needs a way to register where a point in one time step goes to in the next time step. It does this in a very simplistic way by assuming the topology is consistent across time steps. That is, each data set has the exact same triangles listed in the same order connected the same way but at different positions. The surface from your segmentation is surely not of this nature.

2) I am not very sure about this. After using text editor to open the mesh file I can say that they are not... Is there anyway to change this?

Hi,

I'm not able to reproduce this issue on my Linux machine. Can you verify
that the GUI version of ParaView that you're running is also v5.4? That's
the only thing I can think of right now that could be causing the issue.

All,

Anyone know how this works?

I have an element variable called "Volume",  I tried:
sum_per_block(Volume) and
sum_per_block("Volume")  and
sum_per_block(inputs[0].CellData['Volume'])

And all I got was errors.    How should this work - and where will the results be - will each element in a block get the total volume for that block as a variable?

Thanks for any hints.

Ken,

Unfortunately neither raw or tiff format works. ParaView would crash from
reading 4d tiff formats.For raw format, I couldn't get the volume to be
displayed correctly, and the z-spacing does not work for raw files.

I have 200 stacks. One way seems would work for me is to write a Python
script and read each of the stack and set their visibility at different
frames individually.

Subject: [Paraview] Gaussian resampling
Message-ID: <D6263FF3.B355%carterl1@mskcc.org>

Hi,

I have an image volume I'd like to convolve with a Gaussian function, and I have a particular value for sigma that I need to use.

I'm using the Gaussian resampling filter to do this, and it seems to work well; however, the editable parameters for this filter are not well defined - in particular, the "splat radius" , the "Gaussian exponential factor", and the "scale factor".

Suppose my sampling volume is 56x116x39 voxels, and the voxel dimensions are x=y=z=1mm.  If I want to blur the image with a Gaussian point spread function of sigma=1.5mm, what would I enter for "splat radius", "exponential factor", and "scale factor"?

Any help would be most appreciated!

Best,
Luke

Hi All,



I?d like to insert the freestream velocity stamp in a Python annotation on
one of the animations I?m rendering (transient analysis ? U varies
throughout the run).

I can?t find help on the syntax, specifically on how to insert a variable
(U at a point) in the middle of a string of text, and the syntax for
special characters.



Thanks for your help,

I have tried running mpiexec -n 4 pvserver -display :0.0

Thanking you in advance.

Since I only found instructions for Linux, is it possible to build for

Message-ID: <DEA101B66315B941B487EAE03CFFF443515CC6A2@V-EXC-C02.DIRECTORY.INTRA>

Hello,

I have a 3-dimensional unstructured grid containing points with vector, tensor and scalar data. I would like to cut this dataset with a plane of my choice and then select all points that occur within this plane. Kind of like a cross section.

I've already been fooling around with the "clip" filter and this does cut the dataset with a plane of my choice. However I don't know how to go from there to actually selecting just the points that occur within that rectangle.

Eventually I would like to achieve this using the vtk python library.

Could anyone provide some guidance?

Thanks

Quentin,

Try this:


  *   Example:  Plot Total Vertical force (REACTZ_901+REACTZ_902) in animation
     *   Form is "Label %g" %(expression)
        *   Label is:    "Vertical Force: %g"   where %g is format and will be replaced by value of expression
        *   Expression is:  %(REACTZ_901[t_index]+REACTZ_902[t_index])  where t_index is for current time only
        *   See next slide

Subject: [Paraview] About the SC17.5.5.preview binaries...
Message-ID: <CANjZAi9J8eFpwj-v1LVrGEVR_0d5gSkLNsLbR-KncqivuiOaug@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

As Utkarsh pointed out on Oct 23'rd "ParaView Release Roadmap", we decided
to push the 5.5 ParaView release from just before IEEE SC17 out to the
Spring of 2018.
Still there are a lot of good things already in master that we want to show
off at SC that we'd like to draw your attention to. So we decided to put
these current master binaries up on the download page as a technology
preview of what's coming in 5.5.

* The OSPRay path tracing capability and the accompanying Light Inspector
panel are pretty nice if I do say so myself.
* The separate color maps option that makes it easy to have multiple color
lookup tables for the same named array (on different representations of
views for example) is quite handy in certain situations and frequently
requested by users.
* We moved Tools->Python Shell to View->Python Shell and made it a dockable
widget.
* The nvpipe image compressor option does a great job at speeding up server
to client image delivery from nvpipe enabled servers.
* The Cell Size filter is another very handy little addition as are the new
Gradient Filter options.
* The revamped zoom to box camera interaction is much more predictable than
before.

There is a lot more that I am omitting for brevity but the point is that
there are a lot of good things to look forward to when 5.5 comes out in the
Spring. So please do give the 5.5 technology preview binaries a whirl and
let us know what you think of them via the mailing list and or issue
tracker. That will help a lot as we finish up even more features and work
to make the current ones even better.

thanks,

Message-ID: <029001d358d1$53bf6e20$fb3e4a60$@gmail.com>

Hello all

 

I recently switch to Paraview 5.4.1. It used to work well for a week. Then,
every time I start Paraview, it only shows a part of the rendering window
(as shown in the attached figure). I already un-install and re-install
Paraview. But the problem persists. So how can I do to fix this? 

 

Thank you very much

I'm guessing your view size is locked in your settings. If that's the case
you can change that by going to Tools and uncheck either "Lock View Size"
or "Lock View Size Custom..."

That sounds like a bug to me. `sum_per_block` should work as you
expect `sum_per_block(Volume)`. Let me see what's going on.

Hello. If I get it right, the "Crincle slice" option of the Slice filter
may be useful for you. Further clipping by coordinates is available with

Subject: [Paraview] steps to add class with ClientServer and Python wrapping
Message-ID: <CAPN39MWtgSW7nj45Wq9vRFQs-zN1reKpjPFXxCMXyT7=37fdrA@mail.gmail.com>

Heya,
I'd like to add some custom classes to paraview that should also be
accessible through proxies on the client side. And a Python interface is
also needed.

I found that the classes that should be wrapped need to be listed in a few
different CMakeLists.txt files in the paraview sources, and again in the
scripts that take care of generating the wrappers. But I must have missed
more, as I am getting more and more errors the more I try to fix.

Which steps do I have to follow to implement a new class with wrapping?
Thank you
Kolja

Where are you adding your classes? If you add them to one of the "modules"
e.g. ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Default, you'd only need to add them to the
CMakeLists.txt and they'd get wrapped. You'll then need to add a XML config
for the proxy e.g
in ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/filters.xml. That
should be it.

Another option is to add a new module. You can also add a new "module". See
`ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Points/`. You can have the source directory
external to your ParaView source, and in your build simply set
`PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_MODULE_ROOTS` CMake cache variable in your ParaView
build to include the directory containing your new module's dir. You will
need to manually enable the module in CMakeLists.txt as well as ParaView
wont' enable it by default.

Thanks, I was missing those details about the modules system. I'll try your
suggestions.
Is the modules system documented somewhere? I don't remember reading
anything about it in the ParaView Guide.

I'd suggesting starting simple and just adding to existing modules in
ParaView. Once you are familiar with the CMake code, you can experiment
with adding separate modules.

Thanks Dennis. That works great. Any chance there is a list of the useable
variables?



aAlso, Any good resource for special characters that we can insert in the
string (e.g. infiniti sign)?

Quentin,



Try this:



   - Example:  Plot Total Vertical force (REACTZ_901+REACTZ_902) in
   animation
      - Form is ?Label %g? %(expression)
         - Label is:    ?Vertical Force: %g?   where %g is format and will
         be replaced by value of expression
         - Expression is:  %(REACTZ_901[t_index]+REACTZ_902[t_index])
         where t_index is for current time only
         - See next slide

Subject: [Paraview]  Create SliderWidget in Python Shell
Message-ID: <CAC9e6H2wBmZ-miO5L_3s-qnBLYGV4fUPspQCk6hFPUSF74=aWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to add a slider widget to a RenderView in Paraview using
python scripting. I already managed to create a new window containing a
slider widget (vtkSliderWidget). I'm wondering how to add the Slider Widget
to an existing RenderView inside Paraview. If I understood it correctly, I
need references to Paraview?s RenderWindow and RenderWindowInteractor in
order to connect the slider to Paraview?s current RenderView. I know that I
can get the RenderView itself using GetRenderView(). Is there a way to get
the RenderWindow und Interactor the RenderView is associated with?

I'd be grateful if anyone could help.

Quentin,

Glad that helped.   I think any Cell, Point or Field variable is available if you select the corresponding Array Association.   I don?t know what special characters are allowed, maybe someone else can chime in here.

Hi,

I have a cartesian structured grid made of two sub-domains and a two snap
shots in a time that I would like to read in Paraview. The data and grid
files are stored in HDF5 file and I use a XDMF file to read them in a
Paraview. The XDMF files looks like this:

Message-ID: <939D83FF-5E3C-4F9F-9C9E-DADF1FDFA019@mgh.harvard.edu>

Hi Everyone,

I?m a newbie in Paraview and would like to show a 2D map of a 3D shear stress value in a curved coronary artery and I have no idea where to start!  I have attached a similar graph in a paper and my goal is to reproduce a similar graph. Here, they have used arch angle (theta) in the y axis and the curve length or centerline length in the x axis. Any help will be appreciated.

Thank you very much!

Subject: [Paraview] TimerEvents not fired while dragging mouse in
	vtkRenderWindow
Message-ID: <CAPN39MUVpzGRyJCAZ0nMNi4Txih51Nd8weQ2UuLSfzse96T0Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Heya,
I paste some code below, which displays an empty vtkRenderWindow with an
interactor. The interactor fires a TimerEvent every 100ms as printed by the
Observer.
The problem: when I press a mouse button in the vtkRenderWindow, the
TimerEvents stop to be reported, although I need to process data
periodically in my application as a reaction to those TimerEvents.

Why are no TimerEvents fired when a button is pressed, and how can I change
this behaviour?
Thank you
Kolja

import vtk

class Observer(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.cnt=0
  def __call__(self,caller,evt):
    self.cnt+=1
    print "count %d %s" % (self.cnt,evt)

ren1 = vtk.vtkRenderer()
ren1.SetBackground(0.1, 0.2, 0.4)

renWin = vtk.vtkRenderWindow()
renWin.AddRenderer(ren1)
renWin.SetSize(300, 300)

iren = vtk.vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
iren.SetRenderWindow(renWin)

style = vtk.vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera()
iren.SetInteractorStyle(style)

iren.Initialize()
observer=Observer()
iren.AddObserver(vtk.vtkCommand.TimerEvent,observer)
iren.AddObserver(vtk.vtkCommand.MouseMoveEvent,observer)
iren.AddObserver(vtk.vtkCommand.InteractionEvent,observer)
iren.CreateRepeatingTimer(100)
iren.Start()

Hi,
If you set your PYTHONPATH and PATH environment variables correctly, you'll
be good. This wiki gives some pointers on how to do it:

What are the magic cmake switches, for superbuild, that are used to build a non MPI, Mesa version of pvbatch?  Where is this documented?

Thanks,

Alan,

pvbatch and pvpython are both built as long as PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON is
turned ON in its CMake.

So for the superbuild, it is just requires to enable Python.
For Mesa, you are supposed to enable Mesa (only supported on Linux for
sure).
To summarize:
  $ cmake -DENABLE_python=ON -DENABLE_mpi=OFF -DENABLE_mesa=ON *<OTHER
OPTIONS>* ../paraview-superbuild

Do you encounter any issue with such kind of setup?

Best,
Joachim

Hello,

Could you provide more details on the issue you described?
 - What version of ParaView are you using?
 - Which version of the ParaView XMDF reader do you use (2 or 3)?
Providing a data sample with an example of the tag you are trying to add
could be very helpful too.

Nikos,

It looks like you are using the Xdmf2 based reader.
Did you give a chance to the one based on Xdmf3?
What version of ParaView are you using?
Can you provide a full dataset we could use to reproduce the issue?

 calculation
Message-ID: <1F3AD11B-D687-4132-8E46-75442FF1FA89@sandia.gov>

Parastou,

Your question involves a rather complex and domain-specific visualization technique. I?m not sure I totally understand what your data look like, but I assume you have something like a 3D volume of sampled data such as CT scans that contain what can be identified as arterial tubes. I don?t know much about your problem domain, but it sounds like you are referring to a ?Curved Planar Reformation? technique, which I?ve read about in papers like this one by Michelle Borkin: https://vcglab.org/gvi-files/borkin-InfoVis2011_camera-ready.pdf.

Curved Planar Reformation is a complex, multi-step process that involves identifying where the arteries are, extracting the centerline around the tubes, taking slices along the center line, and finding the arterial wall from there. Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge ParaView does not contain an implementation of this process (unless someone else on the mailing list chimes in).

My advice would be to contact the authors of the aforementioned paper or one of the others describing Curved Planar Reformation and ask them about the implementation. Perhaps they will have some software examples that can work.

I suspect that to get this to work in ParaView you will have to introduce your own implementation of Curved Planar Reformation. If you want to pursue this route, you could implement it as a VTK filter and expose it as a ParaView plugin or cram the code into a programmable filter.

Hi Everyone,

I?m a newbie in Paraview and would like to show a 2D map of a 3D shear stress value in a curved coronary artery and I have no idea where to start!  I have attached a similar graph in a paper and my goal is to reproduce a similar graph. Here, they have used arch angle (theta) in the y axis and the curve length or centerline length in the x axis. Any help will be appreciated.

Thank you very much!

Hi all,


I have a file with NaN values in almost every column and row. The integer numbers represent which points should be connected by lines, therefor I can not replace NaN with zeros because it will interpret it as Point with ID 0.

Is there any way I can replace this NaNs with something which paraview reads as blanks?

Thank you!

Hi

ParaView understand NaN correctly as blanks.
If you are reading a .csv file, the correct string that is interpreted as
NaN is "nan" without the quotes.

I am using a vtk poly data file, which when I load in paraview, it gives me error (paraview just stops working). I was thinking it is because of my NaN values.

pvpython is the non-MPI version of pvbatch. The superbuild docs could
probably be improved here. Currently, the mention is:

    ParaView supports multiple rendering engines including `egl`,
    `mesa`, `osmesa`, and `qt5`. All of these are incompatible with each
    other. If none of these are chosen, a UI-less ParaView will be built
    (basically just `pvpython`). On Windows and macOS, only the `qt5`
    rendering engine is available.

Hi Mathieu,

Sadly I can not import the whole file, but here is an example:


LINES 4 13

2 0 1 NaN

3 1 2 3

2 3 4 NaN

2 4 5 NaN


I make the vtk file in matlab by extracting the information from a .dat file. Originally, instead of NaN there are zeros, but I just need blanks without changing the shape of the matrix, which is why I use NaN, but it gives me error in paraview.


I hope it explains what I mean. Thank you!

Ben,
I believe this is a change from the past.  Here is what I desire ? how do I get it?

I want to run pv(pythonScript).  I want it to produce output.  I want it to run off screen, not showing on the console display or current display.  This is especially important on classified systems.  MPI is not available.

Not too long ago, my understanding was this was pvbatch.  pvpython used either the console display or current display as it?s rendering space.  This does not catch my needs.

Doina,

vtk files support Nan?s in general. (I just tried it. It worked fine.) However, you are trying to introduce NaN?s in a list of integer connections, which is just wrong on many levels. However, I do not see why you need NaN at all. The LINES connectivity list allows you to vary the length of the line chain.

It looks like you can solve your problem by simply not writing out the NaN?s in the fill. In the example you sent us, I presume that you mean to have 4 line cells with 2, 3, 2, and 2 vertices, respectively. The following should be the correct representation of that:

LINES 4 13
2 0 1
3 1 2 3
2 3 4
2 4 5

Hi!

Yes, I of course understand your point. There is a bit of a problem though: In reality, this file is much more bigger and deleting the NaNs by hand is not an option (also I am trying to make it all happen automatically). If I ask matlab to delete the zeros from my file, the shape of the matrix will change, so the only solution I found so far is to replace the zeros by NaNs in matlab, which gives me error in paraview, for the reason you, Moreland, explained.

So my question would be again, is it possible to replace it with anything else?

Thank you!

Doina,



vtk files support Nan?s in general. (I just tried it. It worked fine.) However, you are trying to introduce NaN?s in a list of integer connections, which is just wrong on many levels. However, I do not see why you need NaN at all. The LINES connectivity list allows you to vary the length of the line chain.



It looks like you can solve your problem by simply not writing out the NaN?s in the fill. In the example you sent us, I presume that you mean to have 4 line cells with 2, 3, 2, and 2 vertices, respectively. The following should be the correct representation of that:



LINES 4 13

2 0 1

3 1 2 3

2 3 4

2 4 5

Hi Mathieu,

Sadly I can not import the whole file, but here is an example:



LINES 4 13

2 0 1 NaN

3 1 2 3

2 3 4 NaN

2 4 5 NaN



I make the vtk file in matlab by extracting the information from a .dat file. Originally, instead of NaN there are zeros, but I just need blanks without changing the shape of the matrix, which is why I use NaN, but it gives me error in paraview.



I hope it explains what I mean. Thank you!

ParaView understand NaN correctly as blanks.

If you are reading a .csv file, the correct string that is interpreted as NaN is "nan" without the quotes.

I have a file with NaN values in almost every column and row. The integer numbers represent which points should be connected by lines, therefor I can not replace NaN with zeros because it will interpret it as Point with ID 0.

Is there any way I can replace this NaNs with something which paraview reads as blanks?

Thank you!

Dear Utkarsh,
sorry for the delay. Thank you very much for your help.
With minor changes the code seems working very well. However the lines:

# load all available point and cell arrays.
reader.PointArrayStatus.SelectAll()
reader.CellArrayStatus.SelectAll()

seems to usefull if not followed by the "Apply" command. As I noticed, the
two lines only check the relevant chekboxes. How can I simulate the
"Apply" button?

Also, what does

display.RescaleTransferFunctionToDataRange()

really do?

Last but not least, do you know a way to also export the chromatic scale
(legend) associated to each ContourPlot? I can't do it even manually.

Best regards

Claudio

P.S. Here attached the files you sent me.

Subject: [Paraview] surface construction with holes
Message-ID: <0dad796b-1f35-b1c4-a0f2-45079eb2f86f@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am trying to create surface for a poly data (see attached figure). In 
this case, if i use Delaunay2D filter, it creates surface but it also 
fills the holes. So, i just wonder that is it possible to create surface 
for it without filling holes. You could also find a simple dataset as

Doina,

I wasn?t trying to suggest removing all the NaN values by hand. I was saying that the file is being written incorrectly, and you need to change the way you are saving it. The simplest way should be to change the Matlab script that writes the file in the first place. I appreciate that the matrix you are storing the data in Matlab has to be dense, but why do you have to write every entry of the matrix into the file? Write a for loop over the dimensions of the matrix and conditionally write a number if it is not NaN.

If for whatever reason you cannot do that (maybe you are using someone else?s Matlab file writing script and don?t want to or can?t change it), then you could probably automatically remove all the NaN?s with a script after the fact. For example, you should be able to use sed to remove all instances of the string NaN from the file. (This, of course, runs the danger of removing a NaN from elsewhere in the file that you want.)

Subject: [Paraview] surface construction with holes
Message-ID: <7A88BEB2-7128-416F-A7F7-BF1F0D5CEE28@sandia.gov>

Ufuk,

The short answer is, no. You cannot keep the Delaunay2D filter from filling holes.

The mathematical description of Delaunay triangulation fills in all the space in the convex hull of the points. The question about having the Delaunay triangulation keeping open space that is supposed to be empty comes up frequently on this list. However, generally identifying what should not be filled is not easy to describe, especially in a general sense. When you ask me about the ?hole? in your data, I, as a human, can immediately identify what you mean. But can you describe it in such a way that it can be easily picked out by a computer? I cannot. And even if we did come up with something, there is a good chance it would fail for holes of other shapes.

That said, you might be able to resolve the problem by removing the triangles over the hole after you create the surface. I note that what you mean by a hole is a region where points are spread out, so we could start by removing big triangles. You can identify triangle size using the Mesh Quality filter. Add the Mesh Quality filter and change Triangle Quality Measure to Area. After you run that, use the threshold filter to remove all triangles with a ?quality? (actually area) greater than 0.01.

That removes some of the triangles in the holes, but not all of them. You will also see that the remaining triangles are skinny ones that stretch across cords of the circular hole. So, we could also remove skinny triangles. Run the Mesh Quality filter again on the output, this time setting the Triangle Quality Measure to Radius Ratio. Then use the Threshold filter again to remove triangles greater than a value somewhere in the range of 5 to 15. You might notice at this point that it is getting difficult to specify values that work well around the holes along the sides. Low values start removing valid triangles on the sides. High values leave some of the holes covered. This is what I meant by it being difficult to describe the holes to a computer.

An alternate approach is to select the triangles over the wholes, invert the selection, and then extract the selection. You could also do that to the result of the procedure I just gave you.

One final note. You are using Delaunay 2D on a set of data that is 3D. I presume you are aware that Delaunay 2D is actually projecting all of your points onto a plane and finding a triangulation there. It is not finding a surface in 3D. The only way to find the true 3D surface (in ParaView) would be to do a Delaunay 3D and then extract the external faces.

-Ken

All,

I'm trying to retrieve the block names for blocks in an Exodus multi-block dataset.     There is a weird block_ID, block_number thing which I don't understand and can't get past.

Imagine I have many blocks in my dataset but I only load 2

   Block_ID         block_number(displayed in Spreadsheet)
          4                    5                               - this is actually 4th block in file
      101                 25                                - this is actually 24th block in file

I am looping through blocks and getting block_names using this routine:

    def get_block_name(block):
       #
       # Get block ID - indexed from 1
       block_id=block.FieldData.GetArray('ElementBlockIds')

       #
       # Element Block data is in DataBlock(0) of composite database
       ElementBlocks=output.GetBlock(0)
       #
       # meta indexed from 0 (use block_id-1)
       block_meta=ElementBlocks.GetMetaData(block_id-1)
       block_name=block_meta.Get(vtk.vtkCompositeDataSet.NAME())
       return block_name


Note that block.FieldData.GetArray('ElementBlockIds') returns 5 for the first block
I then need to call block_meta.Get(vtk.vtkCompositeDataSet.NAME()) with 4 to get the correct name

Now with the second block, block.FieldData.GetArray('ElementBlockIds') returns 101,
I then call block_meta.Get(vtk.vtkCompositeDataSet.NAME()) with 100 and get an error of "NoneType object has no attribute 'Get'
It seems clear that I need a function which will return 25 for the second block (instead of 101) so that I can call NAME() with 24.

So, how do I get it to return the block number instead of the block ID

NOTE,  the first block is a hex block, while the 2nd block is a quad block - I'm suspicious that this is the real issue, but here all quad blocks are > 100 by convention.

Summary - block name works for contiguously numbered hex blocks but discontinuously numbered quad blocks don't work.

Thanks for any help.

Joachim,
I have also sent my question to the vtkusers mailing list after you have
suggested it. Unfortunately more than half of the questions sent to
vtkusers are never answered, although my impression is that they are
formulated better than most questions on the paraview list in general.

So, I'll appreciate if somebody has an idea how to continue receiving
TimerEvents from a vtkRenderWindowInteractor while a mouse button is
pressed.
By the way, I observed this problem with the Paraview version of VTK
(Paraview 5.4.1).

Hi Mathieu,

I was able to hack something together that worked well enough. I ended up copying vtkParticleTracerBase to a new vtkParticleTracerBaseWithSink class. Then I duplicated the minimal amount of seed-related code I could get away with to be used with the sinks, e.g. GetSeedSources -> GetSinkSources, etc. The actual check against the sink radius happens in IntegrateParticle.

For some reason, it crashes if the sinks are read from a .pvd time series, but works fine if they?re a legacy VTK file series. It also doesn?t behave quite right when reinjection is turned on. Reinjection appears to happen after IntegrateParticles? (I admit the program flow for this is confusing me) So for one timestep some particles might be within the sinks? effective radii.

Hello
Regarding the Programmable Filter, you are right, there is no way to specify it upstream,
 you would need to keep a list of previously deleted particle that should stay deleted, definitelly not a great solution.
Regarding the inheritance, you are right as well, but keep in mind that ParaView is Open Source and you can contribute to the code of the vtkParticleStreamer if you want
and add some kind of check in the base class that you could redefine in your class if you want.
Regarding the plugin loading problem, are you trying to load the plugin in the paraview release (not good) or in the paraview you build the plugin with (good).
If this part is ok, then i would suggest first trying the examples plugins in ParaView source. You will find correctly written CMakeLists and you can work your way up from there.
"paraview/Examples/Plugins/Filter" seems a good starting point. Just copy the folder somewhere, build it and check it can be loaded in ParaView.

Let me know if you run into any troubles.

Best,

Hi Mathieu,

Thanks for the suggestions. I tried having a Programmable Filter take the PolyData input, do the check, and write new PolyData output, and that kind of worked, except that particles could reappear after being deleted. That a particle was deleted wasn?t being sent back upstream to the Particle Tracer, upstream state changes aren?t supported as I understand it.

I tried making a plugin by deriving from vtkParticleTracerBase and overriding RequestData() and IntegrateParticles(), however, that doesn?t work because they accesses private members of vtkParticleTracerBase.

I also tried copying vtkParticleTracerBase to a new class and hacking on it directly, but I?m getting link errors when I try to load the plugin, like

undefined symbol: _Z34vtkParticleTracerWithSinkBase_Init_P26vtkClientServerInterpreter

(I was able to hack directly on vtkParticleTracerBase.cxx in the ParaView src tree and it worked as expected, but I would rather get a plugin working.)


-          When making a plugin based on an abstract VTK class, does something need to change in the CMakeLists.txt? I?m just guessing that?s where my issue with the link error is?

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Accessing particles generated by ParticleTracer

Hello
Simplest way to go would be to add a Python Programmable Filter after the particle tracer, that process each point and does not copy it when it is too far from an arbitrary point.
This would work, even with paraview release, but will not be so most efficient implementation.
Harder way to go would be to copy(or inherit) the ParticleTracer as a new vtk filter and associated xml proxy plugin. And add a radius check in the code, probably in vtkParticleTracerBase::RequestData:1188

            // if the particle is sent, remove it from the list
-            if (this->SendParticleToAnotherProcess(info,previous,this->OutputPointData))
+            if (this->SendParticleToAnotherProcess(info,previous,this->OutputPointData) || !yourRadiusTest(point2))
            {
              this->ParticleHistories.erase(it);
              particle_good = false;
             }

much more efficient but you will need to know C++ and how to compile ParaView and a ParaView plugin.

Hi Mathieu,

The full science context is, this is a simulation of a binary black hole system. The way the solver works, the black hole locations aren?t actually in the mesh, they?re stored as separate coordinates with an associated radius. The black holes orbit each other during the simulation, creating turbulence in the plasma (and magnetic field). I made a few videos of particles being advected by the plasma velocity. This was basically just the mesh, a seed source, and a Particle Tracer filter. This works fine, except that particles which get within the radius of each black hole end up coagulating and behaving non-physically. If I understand the scientist right, in the simulation itself, they are able to handle this somehow correctly, but that behavior doesn?t get translated to what?s saved in the mesh.

That?s part 1. Part 2 of the vis, and this works, is that the plasma advected particles are used as seeds for streamlines through the magnetic field -- though there are streamlines coming out of non-physically correct particles.

What I?d like is to be able to check of each of the actual particle locations vs the black hole locations and radii and if they?re within that radii, delete them (or hide them, make them transparent, whatever.)  I was hoping this was something I could do with a programmable filter, but I?m open to any suggestions, including hacking on VTK source.

Hi ParaView,

Is it possible to get at the individual particles generated by ParticleTracer? I?ve been handed a mesh with a velocity field and an implied particle sink. I?d like to delete any particles that wander within a certain radius of that sink. My thought was if I could get at the array holding the particles I could check each distance and delete as necessary.

Thanks,

Is there a file extension that can be used to get directly to the Xdmf3

Hi all,
I had a person come up to my demonstration at SC, and ask if ParaView can read Mili files?  I believe Rich Cook worked on a Mili reader about 4 or 5 years ago.

So, can ParaView read a Mili file?

Hi again!

So I gave that a shot Berk (starting the server and client separatly), but
it still fails (although now I can see the output). It seems like each
thread is trying to operate on the data, but some of the threads have no
data.

E.g. if I do;

from paraview.numpy_support import vtk_to_numpy

import vtkCommonDataModelPython

import numpy as np

from scipy.optimize import curve_fit



if type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid and
type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkPolyData:

    g = 0

    p = 1

elif type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkUnstructuredGrid and
type(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)) is
vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkPolyData:

    g = 1

    p = 0

else:

    print('ERROR')

    return


# import the grid

Vs = inputs[g].PointData['Vs']

depth = inputs[g].PointData['depth']

z = inputs[0].PointData['z']


# setup output

output.PointData.append(Vs, 'Vs')

output.PointData.append(depth, 'depth')

output.PointData.append(z, 'z')


# import the profile

Vs_profile = inputs[p].PointData['Vs']

depth_profile = inputs[p].PointData['depth']


print(depth_profile)



I get;

When I try and run subsequent operations on the variable (like
np.isnan(depth_profile)) it returns errors for the first 13 empty threads
and vaild results for the 14th thread, but then pseudo-crashes.

E.g. (same code as above but now with)

nanx = np.argwhere(np.isnan(depth_profile))


output;

TypeError: ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types, and the inputs
could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting
rule ''safe''

So any idea on how to explicitly only make it only consider the valid
thread? Or any other idea how to fix this? Once again, it works perfectly
on serial, so is just an issue with how PV, myself, and the programmable
filter are interacting with MPI.

Alan,

There is a Mili reader (*.m *.mili) support through the Visit bridge (see
visit_readers.xml).
However, this reader depends on the Mili library and is not compiled by
default - the CMake variable
VISIT_BUILD_READER_Mili has to be turned ON explicitly.
May be Robert Maynard or Sebastien Jourdain will be able to give more
details on it...

Best,
Joachim

Mili is something that came from LLNL and although it will work using visit
bridge, visit itself had a plan to improve the support. Here is the link
https://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Mili_Support_Overhaul

I did not follow up or know the current status.

Hi Ufuk,

vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter with programmable filter detects holes
in your data although they are somewhat inaccurate. As Ken mentioned,
it would fail for other shapes with holes. But I think it is a little
funny approach.
----
import vtk

pdi = self.GetInput()
pdo = self.GetOutput()

surf = vtk.vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter()
surf.SetInputData(pdi)
surf.SetSampleSpacing(0.02)

cf = vtk.vtkContourFilter()
cf.SetInputConnection(surf.GetOutputPort())
cf.SetValue(0, 0.0)

reverse = vtk.vtkReverseSense()
reverse.SetInputConnection(cf.GetOutputPort())
reverse.ReverseCellsOn()
reverse.ReverseNormalsOn()
reverse.Update()

pdo.ShallowCopy(reverse.GetOutput())
----

Thanks

The question about having the Delaunay triangulation keeping open space that is supposed to be empty comes up frequently on this list. However, generally identifying what should not be filled is not easy to describe, especially in a general sense. When you ask me about the ?hole? in your data, I, as a human, can immediately identify what you mean. But can you describe it in such a way that it can be easily picked out by a computer? I cannot. And even if we did come up with something, there is a good chance it would fail for holes of other shapes.

> That said, you might be able to resolve the problem by removing the triangles over the hole after you create the surface. I note that what you mean by a hole is a region where points are spread out, so we could start by removing big triangles. You can identify triangle size using the Mesh Quality filter. Add the Mesh Quality filter and change Triangle Quality Measure to Area. After you run that, use the threshold filter to remove all triangles with a ?quality? (actually area) greater than 0.01.
>
> That removes some of the triangles in the holes, but not all of them. You will also see that the remaining triangles are skinny ones that stretch across cords of the circular hole. So, we could also remove skinny triangles. Run the Mesh Quality filter again on the output, this time setting the Triangle Quality Measure to Radius Ratio. Then use the Threshold filter again to remove triangles greater than a value somewhere in the range of 5 to 15. You might notice at this point that it is getting difficult to specify values that work well around the holes along the sides. Low values start removing valid triangles on the sides. High values leave some of the holes covered. This is what I meant by it being difficult to describe the holes to a computer.
>

>
> One final note. You are using Delaunay 2D on a set of data that is 3D. I presume you are aware that Delaunay 2D is actually projecting all of your points onto a plane and finding a triangulation there. It is not finding a surface in 3D. The only way to find the true 3D surface (in ParaView) would be to do a Delaunay 3D and then extract the external faces.

Hi,

Thanks for your suggestion. Actually the data is coming from one of my 
colleges and it belongs to Fermi Surfaces (x, y, and z coordinates for 
constant energy) generated by a code and we would like to generate an 
animation for surfaces that belongs to multiple energy levels for a 
teaching purposes. Anyway, i test it with the data it is better but it 
has some artifacts with simple shapes. For example, the attached plot 
a.png belongs to a almost sphere shape but in this case it has some 
artificial planes in the surface. For the data with holes it gives 
relatively good result with some minor artifacts. I also tested Ken's 
way. If i apply Delaunay 3D to the shape the result is very poor and it 
is hard to fix the artifacts with Mesh Quality filter. On the other 
hand, if i clip the shape to two symmetric ones and apply? Delaunay 2D 
to each of one along with Mesh Quality and Threshold filters as Ken 
described. The results are better (see c.png and d.png). Still it has 
artifacts that i don't know how could i fix. I am also considering to 
write data using unstructured mesh if it is possible but i have to try 
it. Anyway, thanks to both of you for your help.

Best Regards,

--ufuk

I note that what you mean by a hole is a region where points are spread out, so we could start by removing big triangles. You can identify triangle size using the Mesh Quality filter. Add the Mesh Quality filter and change Triangle Quality Measure to Area. After you run that, use the threshold filter to remove all triangles with a ?quality? (actually area) greater than 0.01.

So, we could also remove skinny triangles. Run the Mesh Quality filter again on the output, this time setting the Triangle Quality Measure to Radius Ratio. Then use the Threshold filter again to remove triangles greater than a value somewhere in the range of 5 to 15. You might notice at this point that it is getting difficult to specify values that work well around the holes along the sides. Low values start removing valid triangles on the sides. High values leave some of the holes covered. This is what I meant by it being difficult to describe the holes to a computer.

The only way to find the true 3D surface (in ParaView) would be to do a Delaunay 3D and then extract the external faces.

Yeah, it seems I was mistaken. pvbatch is not conditional on MPI. If the
superbuild is built with mesa and Python and without MPI, pvbatch should
be there. I've filed an MR to fix the packaging/install step in the
superbuild:

Subject: [Paraview] Exodus multiblock dataset block numbers vs block
Message-ID: <BN3PR0701MB1687738B072F7D440FFE4E3E9F290@BN3PR0701MB1687.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

All,

Okay, maybe not the clearest email I've ever written!

See the attached image:  Here I have loaded a single block out of a multi-block dataset.

It is the 24th block in the dataset.
It was assigned the block_ID 101 at creation (we separate different blocks into different number ranges)
So, it is shown in the Spreadsheet view as Block Number 25 (24+1)

However, I need the Block_Name of this block.   The block name is stored under:
Input.GetBlock(0).GetMetaData(23).Get(vtk.vtkCompositeDataSet.NAME())       (23=24-1)

In order to retrieve the name, I need to find the Block Number 25 (and subtract 2 from it).

I have been unable to find this block_number.    I can't count blocks to find out the block_number, because my Programmable filter only has this 1 block in it.

So, does anyone know where this "Block Number" is stored?    I'm wishing at this point that the Exodus reader had stored the block names in a dictionary with BlockID (ObjectID) as the key - then I could find  the name.

Any clues on how to determine the Block Number?

Thanks
Dennis

Hi Dennis,

I can answer part of your question.  The block number is the index in a
pre-order traversal of the tree of blocks in the dataset.  The root is
element 0, its first child is 1, that block's first child (or if none, the
root's second child) is 2 and so on.  Your blocks with data are likely two
levels down since your index has that offset (and your code backs this up
since you are asking for the metadata of a child of the root's block 0).

HTH,
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] OpenGL inside VMWare virtual machine
Message-ID: <1510758597.3584.12.camel@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I know that I cannot go for any performance record with this setup, but
having both systems available without reboot has advantages if it is
about testing some new development. WOULD have - if it fully worked! So
far it looks like I am "almost there" - however not knowing whether the
last 10 meters will be feasible at all...

This is my setup:

Main system: Opensuse Linux "Leap" 42.3, with Paraview reporting the
following in the About dialog:
OpenGL Vendor: Intel Open Source Technology Center
OpenGL Version: 3.3 (Core Profile) Mesa 17.0.5
OpenGL Renderer: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ivybridge Mobile

On this system Paraview (latest version, self compiled) runs just fine.

Guest system inside VMWare Player version 14: Windows 10, with Paraview
reporting the following:
OpenGL Vendor: VMware, Inc.
OpenGL Version: 3.3 (Core Profile) Mesa 11.2.0 (git-b9d3786)
OpenGL Renderer: Gallium 0.4 on SVGA3D; build: RELEASE; LLVM;

Here Paraview immediately complains on startup, reporting the following
in the message output dialog: see below.

For me the version numbers look ok (OpenGL 3.3 is more than 3.2, and
Mesa 11.2.0 is more than 10.6.5), but there is some "fineprint" about
shader capabilities that are going a bit above my understanding...

Anybody able to help with this?

Any possibility to "cheat" somehow? Note that I am certainly not going
to render billions of data in this configuration!

Or should I abandon this tricky setup altogether?

Thanks and regards,
Cornelis

Hello,

1) Is it possible to read/import GoCAD file *.ts (triangulated surfaces)
using ParaView, with a possibility to further read its data in ascii
format, or convert to a 3D function of space point (x,y,z)?

2) The same question about Earth Vision grid and the respective files

using ParaView?

Thank you,

Shawn,

I grok the origin of the non-intuitive, better omitted than displayed, highly confusing, should be replaced with block names, block numbers.    However, in my Programmable filter I just have a single block and I need the index into the block name ? I?m not sure it exists anywhere that I can access.

This could  be a PV Qt interaction. Try setting MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2
in your environment

Basically there is a bug in Qt on windows where it refuses to see the 3.2
context from Mesa because it is not a compatibility context.

What do you mean by "file info"? File name? Size of the file? Data arrays
in the file?

Hi,

I mean how to get the file name info such as "Sout_1012.pvtu",
"Sout_1013.pvtu". Currently I can only read the timestep info such as
"+1.98800000e+03".

Many thanks.

I do not think that GoCAR ASCII (ts) files are directly readable in
ParaView. Although there is a reader in this repo
http://paraviewgeo.objectivity.ca/documentation/user-manual/supported-formats
that
you could bring into ParaView / VTK. If that is the case, we would be happy
to help bringing in the reader in VTK / ParaView.

thanks

Alan,

You should be able to run

pvpython --force-offscreen-rendering script.py

and no render window will appear. The help for --force-offscreen-rendering
says:

  "If supported by the build and platform, create headless (offscreen)
render windows for rendering results."

I believe this should work on linux systems, but you should try it out on
the system on which you want to force offscreen rendering just to be sure
before using it to produce classified images.

pvbatch running the same script will indeed not pop up a render window even
without the --force-offscreen-rendering option.

Let us know how it goes,
Cory

the actual code location is here:

Let us know if you decide to bring in this code into VTK / ParaView as we
will be very interested in it as well.

Thanks for the hint: I will definitely try this!

Only one question: you write environment which sounds like an environment
variable, but maybe you mean a variable ti be set in the CMake
configuration!?!

Subject: [Paraview] Animation .avi output not working in v5.4.1,

Anyone else seeing this?

I'm getting the same msg I was getting in v4.4 (but in v4.4 it still produced a useable animation).


[avi @ 0x8ec35c0] Using AVStream.codec.time_base as a timebase hint to the muxer is deprecated. Set AVStream.time_base instead.
[avi @ 0x8ec35c0] Encoder did not produce proper pts, making some up.

Thank you Aashish,

But the link you provided includes:

   - GoCad ASCII Files (*.gp, *.ts, *.pl, *.vs, *.vts, *.vo, *.sg)

(see Bottom of Supported Readers).
Does it mean GoCAD files are doable already? Or, something still needs to
be added to Paraview, to read them?

the code I pointed to is based on a older version of the VTK and ParaView
and needs to be ported to newer VTK and ParaView. I do not expect it will
be lot of work but some work and we can help you over the email if needed.

Thanks

The file names are embedded in the same XML element as the time step:

<DataSet timestep="+1.98800000e+03"  part="001" file="Sout_1012.pvtu"/>

But I'll be that's not how you want to access them.

Next question: From where do you want to access the file names? A Python
script? In the UI?

Actually, what I want to do is using python script to read *pvd file first
to get the name info of *pvtu files. Then use the *pvtu file name to read
through all of them one by one to extract the info I want. I'm not sure if
there is a better way to realize this.

Many thanks.

Question not any more relevant: setting an environment variable before
starting paraview does indeed the trick: it works now indeed as
expected!

Thanks and regards,

with the gpu_shader4 extension is not supported by your graphics
driver but is required for the new OpenGL rendering backend.
Please update your OpenGL driver. If you are using Mesa please
make sure you have version 10.6.5 or later and make sure your
driver in Mesa supports OpenGL 3.2.

Message-ID: <CAALFRAgVOBFkaerh=nSikgXrbMSYCFp-hYVqcArh6wHjHDrVeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone.
Is there a way to see Delft 3D output in ParaView. Delft 3D produces its
outout in  NFIES compliant (*.dat) format. Any plugin to directly view
these files. Or any way to convert these files into NetCDF for viewing in
ParaView.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

On startup, Qt makes a context without a profile. Mesa gives it the best
compatibility profile it can: 2.0. Qt then interprets this as the
highest OpenGL version available and clamps all requests to this
version. The entire behavior is mystifying to me, but the issue has been
filed here:

	plugin
Message-ID: <47802689-16b3-8195-47d7-ea1d5e4183b3@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


Based on AcceleratedAlgorithms.xml I created an XML-PV plugin to make use of
vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes 
(https://github.com/romangrothausmann/ParaView_XML-plugins/blob/1574430ce/vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes.xml). 
It basically works as expected, but does not yield any point/cell arrays in its 
result, that I would need for coloring of e.g. the different labels (i.e. 
ComputeScalars). I found a post that said that PV only lists arrays that have a 
name, but as far as I understand, vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes does name its output 
arrays.
What else could be missing in the XML-code?

Many thanks for any help or hints.
Roman

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF file with multiple temporal collections
Message-ID: <8ccae8e8-caf7-8110-4840-97ec4b70d9a4@inria.fr>

Hello all,

I'm trying to generate a valid (at least, well-read by paraview) XDMF 
file. It represents a single topology/geometry, with multiple scalars, 
varying over time.

I've attached the file I'm trying to read with paraview. It behaves 
almost as I want, but oddly enough, only with scalars tagged as 
"partial" by paraview.

One of the scalars "animation", the first one in the XDMF file, is 
completely buggy, possibly with values from other scalars.

Is there something wrong with my XDMF file or is this a bug in paraview?

Thanks for your help,

-- Nicolas

Does anyone have a very small dataset that is structured meshes, that use multiple material volume fractions?

Also, are we missing a functionality processing these datsets?  In other words, do we need a filter that will contour over many material volume fractions within the same filter?

Thanks,

Dennis,
I believe that the first line isn?t important.
I believe that the second line is fatal.  This is what we were seeing with 5.4.0, that I thought we fixed.  Mind passing me directions to replicate (including size of the viewport, when shown in the Save Animation window, whether this is a custom build, the OS, and a dataset?  If I can replicate, I will write it up.

Otherwise, you write it up, I will mark appropriately?

OK, this ? sort of  ? worked.  I was able to use the Kitware download (Yay!).  I called pvbatch (surprisingly, it was built by Kitware for Linux), and then used flags --mesa-llvm and --use-offscreen-rendering.  I believe --use-offscreen-rendering will be replaced in the future by --force-offscreen-rendering in PV 5.5.0.

Thanks Cory, and everyone else that chimed in.

Alan,

You should be able to run

pvpython --force-offscreen-rendering script.py

and no render window will appear. The help for --force-offscreen-rendering says:

  "If supported by the build and platform, create headless (offscreen) render windows for rendering results."

I believe this should work on linux systems, but you should try it out on the system on which you want to force offscreen rendering just to be sure before using it to produce classified images.

pvbatch running the same script will indeed not pop up a render window even without the --force-offscreen-rendering option.

Let us know how it goes,
Cory

Ben,
I believe this is a change from the past.  Here is what I desire ? how do I get it?

I want to run pv(pythonScript).  I want it to produce output.  I want it to run off screen, not showing on the console display or current display.  This is especially important on classified systems.  MPI is not available.

Not too long ago, my understanding was this was pvbatch.  pvpython used either the console display or current display as it?s rendering space.  This does not catch my needs.

    pvpython is the non-MPI version of pvbatch. The superbuild docs could
    probably be improved here. Currently, the mention is:

        ParaView supports multiple rendering engines including `egl`,
        `mesa`, `osmesa`, and `qt5`. All of these are incompatible with each
        other. If none of these are chosen, a UI-less ParaView will be built
        (basically just `pvpython`). On Windows and macOS, only the `qt5`
        rendering engine is available.

Message-ID: <CAMd10VZMpzORRnwvGeBeVrnQG5YX4DLrs7k1fXD6oitrqVgk1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using Anaconda python 2.7 to call paraview python library on RedHat
Linux, every time I run "from paraview.simple import *" or '"from vtk
import *", I will get a "Segmentation fault" error. Can anybody tell me
what's wrong, and can you share your python path setup in .bashre file?

My .bashrc file is like this:

# add paraview
export
PATH=$PATH:/lclscratch/ProgramFiles/ParaView-5.4.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/bin/
# add paraview python to PYTHONPATH
export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/lclscratch/ProgramFiles/ParaView-5.4.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/
export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/lclscratch/ProgramFiles/ParaView-5.4.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-5.4

Thank you very much.

Message-ID: <CAJbx2R4ZaHsec=hDzszMT2du16LF-wjvZhJ+cqpQiOR9z4oocA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to help one of our users (HPC center) use ParaView to work
with their wind tunnel data.  They have a large number of time samples
(60,000) from a series of surfaces with from a small number of sample
points (64).

The sample points are irregular but structured as they are laid out to
be more dense in areas that should see more differences (i.e., at best
you could say it was a non-uniform grid with several of the points not
used).

What file format should this data be put in to import into ParaView?

The VTK legacy formats and XML description formats seem painful to use
with this number of timesteps and I believe (please correct if wrong)
that the NetCDF wants a regular grid.

Thanks!  -Tyson

Anyone else seeing this?

I?m getting the same msg I was getting in v4.4 (but in v4.4 it still produced a useable animation).

Great catch ? avi opens with VLC, not with Windoze Media Player

A bit more detail.  I also received the garbage that Dennis did.  When running Rendering Settings as use offscreen memory, all was well.  When running use off screen memory off, I got all of this verbiage.  But, my .avi?s were good.

Dennis ? try opening your .avi?s with VLC.  Does that work?

Here is the verbiage:

Kitware ? any ideas?  Doesn?t the Kitware binaries use an internal .avi codec?

Dennis ? note that this is SuperComputing week.  Kitware has been running a sparse staff at work.

p.s. ? Kitware booth rocked.  The immersive 3d demo was awesome!

I tried, and cannot replicate.  I am on Redhat also.  Are you using your own builds, or Kitware binaries?  I am using 5.4.1 Kitware binaries, local server.  If not, try Kitware binaries?

Tyson,

You won't get a common answer, but here is my $00.02. The EnSight format 
has a nice feature that every variable has its own file. So, each 
'sample point' will have its own file. The file names can be as you 
want, numeric or alphabetic. The EnSight format has a geometry file, but 
if you want to use single vertex cells it won't become very large.? If 
you want to be a little more graphical, you could use 64 4-node quads 
with their respective coordinate positions. Additionally, you could add 
a relatively coarse mesh of the structure. (ParaView has a Filter that 
will take a point set (your 64 single-point cells) and construct a 
triangular mesh to provide some geometry.

The EnSight format uses a meta-file (aka *.case file) that references 
all of the files in the datum set, example attached. It will be some 
work the first time around, but well worth it in my opinion.

(I use this file-format myself for million-element 3-D meshes for 
transient dynamic simulations. I would not leave home without it.)

Alan,

Great catch ? avi opens with VLC, not with Windoze Media Player

A bit more detail.  I also received the garbage that Dennis did.  When running Rendering Settings as use offscreen memory, all was well.  When running use off screen memory off, I got all of this verbiage.  But, my .avi?s were good.

Dennis ? try opening your .avi?s with VLC.  Does that work?

Here is the verbiage:
[avi @ 0x79d2760] Using AVStream.codec.time_base as a timebase hint to the muxer is deprecated. Set AVStream.time_base instead.

Dennis,
I believe that the first line isn?t important.
I believe that the second line is fatal.  This is what we were seeing with 5.4.0, that I thought we fixed.  Mind passing me directions to replicate (including size of the viewport, when shown in the Save Animation window, whether this is a custom build, the OS, and a dataset?  If I can replicate, I will write it up.

Otherwise, you write it up, I will mark appropriately?

I have not had luck with anaconda and utilizing paraview python tools. The problems comes from compilation options. To run the paraview modules the python you are using needs to be compiled with the option --enable-unicode set at compile time. The python that ships with Anaconda does not come with this. Specifically, I think that for ParaView versions > 5 you need to enable universal character set 4 for everything to work. I use PV 4.4 with a self built python 2.7.13 and the only compile option -enable-Unicode and it works great.

Hi all!

I am still learning the use of paraview and I have got to such a question: How to show in a vtk input file the degrees of freedom of elements? Some of the beams have 6 degrees of freedom, some of the other elements...less or nothing at all. IS there any possibility?

Thank you a lot in advance!

Doina--


At the risk of underestimating ParaView's functionalities, I can tell 
you what will work. For displaying geometry,? PV only needs Point (aka 
nodal point) x,y,z-coordinates, a Cell (aka Finite Element, ...)? type? 
and for each Cell an n-tuple of Point "array locations", for example, 
EnSight-format::{1,2,4,3,7,8,} or VTK-format::{0,1,3,2,6,7}.


The VTK format uses C-language 'array offsets' for Cell connectivity 
n-tuples. The EnSight format uses FORTRAN-language array locations for 
Finite Element connectivity n-tuples. It is just the way it is.


Variables are either located at Points or in Cells (conceptually Cell 
centers). The arrays supplied for variables must span all of the Points 
or all of the Cells. (I do not know how to use or about the 
acceptability of "partially" specified variable datum sets.) For Points 
with 6-DOFs versus 3-DOFs, if you want to see the three rotational DOFs, 
use POINT DATA arrays and fill in the Phi-x, Phi-y, Phi-z values using 
zeros for at those Points without a rotation.


If you want to visually display a 2-node, 6-DOF beam's geometry (a 
curved beam or a deformed beam) , one solution is too use a VTK Cell 
type 'VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE = 21'? for the beam. This will require you to 
add-on-the-fly to the simulation results a beam center-Point with 
x,y,z-coordinates and displacements for the beam's center Point using 
the beam's interpolation functions. (PV has a Warp Filter that will let 
you then scale up the deflections for visualization purposes.)


Should you have access to source code for the simulations, I can supply 
FORTRAN language routines that write VTK ASCII-formatted simulation 
results. (My personal preference is the EnSight format.)

Hello everyone,

I have some scalar data on the surface of a circle and I want to plot it on
the circle, something similar to the attached images (like a pressure map

Hi Kenichiro,

I tested your programmable filter again with higher resolution dataset 
and the result is much much better. I just want to tahank to you for 
your help and also let you know about the latest result (see attached 
plot, f png). I also tested Delaunay filter but in this case i clipped 
shape to two half and apply Delaunay2D each one of them and also 
threshold filters. You can see the result in plot e.png. It also 
improved but Programmable one seems better solution. Anyway, thanks again.

Best Regards,

The question about having the Delaunay triangulation keeping open space that is supposed to be empty comes up frequently on this list. However, generally identifying what should not be filled is not easy to describe, especially in a general sense. When you ask me about the ?hole? in your data, I, as a human, can immediately identify what you mean. But can you describe it in such a way that it can be easily picked out by a computer? I cannot. And even if we did come up with something, there is a good chance it would fail for holes of other shapes.

I note that what you mean by a hole is a region where points are spread out, so we could start by removing big triangles. You can identify triangle size using the Mesh Quality filter. Add the Mesh Quality filter and change Triangle Quality Measure to Area. After you run that, use the threshold filter to remove all triangles with a ?quality? (actually area) greater than 0.01.

So, we could also remove skinny triangles. Run the Mesh Quality filter again on the output, this time setting the Triangle Quality Measure to Radius Ratio. Then use the Threshold filter again to remove triangles greater than a value somewhere in the range of 5 to 15. You might notice at this point that it is getting difficult to specify values that work well around the holes along the sides. Low values start removing valid triangles on the sides. High values leave some of the holes covered. This is what I meant by it being difficult to describe the holes to a computer.

I presume you are aware that Delaunay 2D is actually projecting all of your points onto a plane and finding a triangulation there. It is not finding a surface in 3D. The only way to find the true 3D surface (in ParaView) would be to do a Delaunay 3D and then extract the external faces.

This syntax isn't clear to me:

--disable-xdisplay-test
---ssh -N -f -L15801:localhost:15801 though internal connection-->
Where are you trying to run ssh on to open up this second (between login
and compute) tunnel?

---
ERROR: In /HOME/pp569/soft/ParaView-v5.4.1/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx,
line 206
vtkServerSocket (0x20e9c20): Socket error in call to bind. Address already
in use.

Indicates that pvserver is trying to grab a socket that some other process
owns. You might be competing with one of your other pvserver processes
(from an earlier run or perhaps a misconfigured non-mpi pvserver task
running on the same node from this srun invocation) or possibly your ssh
tunnel process.

---

Forward connections from desktop to login to compute are harder to setup in
most cases because in general you don't know what compute node (and
sometimes login node) you will get.

---

I recommend using something simple like netcat to send and receive messages
across each tunnel. If you can type on one side and see the text on the
other, then paraview should be able to use the connection.

Please let us know how it goes. We would love to see ParaView running on
Tianhe-2!

What kind of visualizations are they looking to do? It may be a good idea
to treat time differently here given that it is the most dense dimensions.
I am thinking of some sort of tabular format that can then be used with
filtering to extract a time step. Potentially, even a database may work
depending on what the end visualization product will be.

Yes, the network environment in TianHe-2 is weird.

However, the problem can be solved manually by set ssh port forwarding like
this:

1. start pvserver on cn123 in direct connection mode and let it listen to
port 11111
2. manually modify the local port forward in my PC as: -L11111:<internal ip
of cn123>:11111
3. use paraview gui in my PC to connect to localhost:11111

I think it makes sense.

I am thinking of some sort of tabular format that can then be used with filtering to extract a time step. Potentially, even a database may work depending on what the end visualization product will be.

My understanding is they want to start by making a movie of the recorded pressure values interpolated (as some color ramp) across the structure surface and as this is what they are currently doing with their MATLAB code.

I ultimately expect they may come up with something else once they get the data in though and are able to play around with it (enabling playing around with it being a big part of why they are wanting to get it into ParaView).

While the local expert, I've only really go very very basic experience so far (all I've really done is work through the various tutorials and teach them in workshops), so I'm interested in any advice.

Compared to the tutorials, the strange thing about this data is the large number of time steps, that it is spatially irregular and sparse, and that it doesn't fully define the underlying object geometry (i.e., the geometry of the surface extends out past the last sample points due to each measurement point requiring drilling holes for measurement taps in the physical object).

Currently I'm think, if we can come up with a decent way of importing the data as a point set, of

https://blog.kitware.com/dataset-resampling-filters/

1. import the sample data as a point data set
2. use the point volume interpolate (or resample to image?) to create a mesh from it
3. use the re-sample with dataset to put that onto the actual physical geometery
4. save animation to get the desired movie

Is there a better way to do this?  Should I try and create some sort of irregular grid out of the sample data to avoid step 2?

Thanks!  -Tyson

Not yet.

You could add one by editing the appropriate "ReaderFactory extensions"...
line of ParaviewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resource/proxies_xdmf3.xml

It might be that the reader doesn't like or want that both of your times
are 0.0.
...
<Time TimeType="Single" Value="0.0"/>
...
<Time TimeType="Single" Value="0.0"/>
...
but your third case doesn't fit that hypothesis.

Otherwise your file looks ok at first glance. I'ld have to debug the reader

Subject: [Paraview] boolean mesh filtering
Message-ID: <1e1ec2c71dd2479d97a487f5a4258161@ES03AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I have a need to do a Boolean intersection of two unstructured multiblock datasets.  It so happens in this case that the underlying element sets are polygonal meshes, so in this particular case I could also do what I want with a Boolean intersection of two polygonal meshes.  To be (hopefully) redundant, I have two meshes which share some points and cells and each of which have other points and cells which are not shared.  I would like a new mesh which consists of all the points and cells that are in both of these meshes.  I need this to work properly in parallel.

I know enough to create a python-based filter (python programmable filter) to create this operation, but are there already existing Boolean mesh operations, and if not would those be a useful thing to add?

Hello,

I am looking for a way to display a volume that is not covered by mesh
(its located somewhere in the middle of mesh).

By default such volumes (without mesh) are shown as empty area, and
meshed area is shown as solid.

I need to reverse the solid and empty areas, so that non-meshed volume
is shown as solid, and meshed volume as empty.

Mesh is in 3D.

Is there a way to do this?

Thank you very much.

Best,

Sergey

Hi Samuel,


Thank you for your reply.

I have different frequencies, 50 in total. If I use FIELD POINT DATA and then for arrayname 1 and so on, I use the Freq1, Freq2... then for 6Dofs, I use vectors in x,y,z for translation and Phi-x,Phi-y, Phi-z for rotation.... would it make sense in paraview? I can hopefully then wrap by vectors using the data for each frequency.


Thank you! I hope I was clear.

Doina--


At the risk of underestimating ParaView's functionalities, I can tell you what will work. For displaying geometry,  PV only needs Point (aka nodal point) x,y,z-coordinates, a Cell (aka Finite Element, ...)  type  and for each Cell an n-tuple of Point "array locations", for example, EnSight-format::{1,2,4,3,7,8,} or VTK-format::{0,1,3,2,6,7}.


The VTK format uses C-language 'array offsets' for Cell connectivity n-tuples. The EnSight format uses FORTRAN-language array locations for Finite Element connectivity n-tuples. It is just the way it is.


Variables are either located at Points or in Cells (conceptually Cell centers). The arrays supplied for variables must span all of the Points or all of the Cells. (I do not know how to use or about the acceptability of "partially" specified variable datum sets.) For Points with 6-DOFs versus 3-DOFs, if you want to see the three rotational DOFs, use POINT DATA arrays and fill in the Phi-x, Phi-y, Phi-z values using zeros for at those Points without a rotation.


If you want to visually display a 2-node, 6-DOF beam's geometry (a curved beam or a deformed beam) , one solution is too use a VTK Cell type 'VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE = 21'  for the beam. This will require you to add-on-the-fly to the simulation results a beam center-Point with x,y,z-coordinates and displacements for the beam's center Point using the beam's interpolation functions. (PV has a Warp Filter that will let you then scale up the deflections for visualization purposes.)


Should you have access to source code for the simulations, I can supply FORTRAN language routines that write VTK ASCII-formatted simulation results. (My personal preference is the EnSight format.)

Hi all!

I am still learning the use of paraview and I have got to such a question: How to show in a vtk input file the degrees of freedom of elements? Some of the beams have 6 degrees of freedom, some of the other elements...less or nothing at all. IS there any possibility?

Thank you a lot in advance!

Following the example in the wiki (https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Drop_down_list_with_values_from_input_arrays) I can add a dropdown to my xml plugin to grab an array to process with a programmable filter.  But I want to process two arrays.  How can I do this?  It's obviously related to the "idx" parameter of SetInputArrayToProcess in vtkAlgorithm but I can't figure out how to make the paraview GUI cooperate.

Doina--


In what follows, I will skip talking about a 3-nod quadratic line as a 
way to display a cured beam or a deformed beam. (I live in a world of 
large deformation simulations and I like to display that type of behavior.)


The concept of FIELD (aka GLOBAL) simulation results, for example, 
results that come from or related to overall behavior like total Kinetic 
Energy (KE), are well supported by the Exodus-II format and are absent 
from the EnSight format and the VTK format for simulation results. I 
will confine my comments to what I have to offer to just POINT data and 
CELL data.


It is convenient to divide simulation results into three categories for 
virtually all of the data formats that PV can read.

(1) GEOMETRY data

(2) POINT data

(3) CELL data


The following is the VTK-XML ASCII format. (See the attached file 
'resultsvtk.f')


(1) GEOMETRY. ParaView is quite happy with just GEOMETRY data.(It is a 
nice way to start when one is trying to write a datum set for ParaView. 
ParaView will display an object with only the geometry data.)


(1a) Write the entire Point inventory from 1 to n where n = number of 
nodal points? in terms of coordinate 3-tuples [(x1,y1,z1,), ...,(xn,yn,zn)]


(1b) Write the entire Cell inventory of connectivity n-tuples (as array 
offsets!)

(1c) Write the 'starting location' for the n-tuples in (1b)

(1d) Write the VTK cell-type values for the n-tuples in (1b)


ParaView now has everything it needs to display your geometry.


(2) Write POINT data information.

(2a) In the case of 'mode shapes,' write the mode's displacement 
3-tuples (aka Vectors, name="Mode1")

[(UxM1,UyM1,UzM1),...,(UxMn,UyMn,UzMn)]

(2b) Repeat with name="Mode2", and so fourth (aka/und so weiter/)


ParaView now has the enough information to animate the mode shapes. 
Instructions are here

( https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2017-October/041077.html 
) for producing animations of the mode shapes.


Hope this helps.

Introduction. ParaView comes with plethora of functionality bundled in: several readers, multitude of filters, quite a few different types of views etc.

Subject: [Paraview] Python programmable filter to process results over time
Message-ID: <BN1PR09MB02442B6B89C075A3CD14014BB8230@BN1PR09MB0244.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

I'm trying to make a programmable filter to do some post-processing that involves accumulating data from multiple time steps.


This isn't really what I'm trying to do but as an example of something that would get me most of the way there say I want to sum up the values of a field over a range of time steps and then display that cumulative sum as a field itself.


My googling seems to indicate this is now possible with the programmable filter but hasn't turned up any simple example of how to do it.  Does someone have such an example or can someone point me in the right direction on how to do this (if it's indeed possible)?


Thanks,


Mark

Subject: [Paraview] POINT_GAUSSIAN
Message-ID: <CAGRS4a6W=TxJd=HiXJ6JKwvjfFD-yQH6HRXMWcsMcFam_kSazg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Users,

I am working on particle simulations and using different size of particles.
I am using paraview 5.1.0 for visualization with point gaussian. As point
gaussian  doesn't work like glyps, it has option like wrt density, radius
etc. Initially It was okay with paraview 5.1.0 but now i am not getting
other options (screen shot is attached). I downloaded again same paraview
but same issue. I want to visualize actual size of particles, if no option
is available it makes all particles of same size irrespective of their
input radius. I tired with other versions of paraview (above 5.0) but
problem is not solved yet. It behaves just like 3D Glyphs.

Tell me how do I sort this issue?

With regards,
Govind

Subject: [Paraview] Disable automatic mesh warping
Message-ID: <CAJC7CwaYXcVfbMvYu2h2S=XA=MuOPTsZ09R_VrCRy2N6cs89-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working in a reduced unit system where the computed strain fields are
around order 1. I could write postprocessors to rescale before
visualization but that would increase my computational time.

Is there a way to turn off the automatic warping that ParaView performs on
disp_k (k =x, y, z) fields?

I tried to use the WarpByVector filter with scale of 0.1 or smaller and
that did not seem to work properly. I should mention I'm on version 5.0 (my
favorite for a variety of reasons), so maybe the this WarpByVector issue is
resolved in newer versions.

Thanks,
John

Doina--


In what follows, I will skip talking about a 3-nod quadratic line as a way to display a cured beam or a deformed beam. (I live in a world of large deformation simulations and I like to display that type of behavior.)


The concept of FIELD (aka GLOBAL) simulation results, for example, results that come from or related to overall behavior like total Kinetic Energy (KE), are well supported by the Exodus-II format and are absent from the EnSight format and the VTK format for simulation results. I will confine my comments to what I have to offer to just POINT data and CELL data.


It is convenient to divide simulation results into three categories for virtually all of the data formats that PV can read.

(1) GEOMETRY data

(2) POINT data

(3) CELL data


The following is the VTK-XML ASCII format. (See the attached file 'resultsvtk.f')


(1) GEOMETRY. ParaView is quite happy with just GEOMETRY data.(It is a nice way to start when one is trying to write a datum set for ParaView. ParaView will display an object with only the geometry data.)


(1a) Write the entire Point inventory from 1 to n where n = number of nodal points  in terms of coordinate 3-tuples [(x1,y1,z1,), ...,(xn,yn,zn)]


(1b) Write the entire Cell inventory of connectivity n-tuples (as array offsets!)

(1c) Write the 'starting location' for the n-tuples in (1b)

(1d) Write the VTK cell-type values for the n-tuples in (1b)


ParaView now has everything it needs to display your geometry.


(2) Write POINT data information.

(2a) In the case of 'mode shapes,' write the mode's displacement 3-tuples (aka Vectors, name="Mode1")

[(UxM1,UyM1,UzM1),...,(UxMn,UyMn,UzMn)]

(2b) Repeat with name="Mode2", and so fourth (aka und so weiter)


ParaView now has the enough information to animate the mode shapes. Instructions are here

( https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2017-October/041077.html ) for producing animations of the mode shapes.


Hope this helps.

Hi Samuel,


Thank you for your reply.

I have different frequencies, 50 in total. If I use FIELD POINT DATA and then for arrayname 1 and so on, I use the Freq1, Freq2... then for 6Dofs, I use vectors in x,y,z for translation and Phi-x,Phi-y, Phi-z for rotation.... would it make sense in paraview? I can hopefully then warp by vectors using the data for each frequency.


Thank you! I hope I was clear.

Doina--


At the risk of underestimating ParaView's functionalities, I can tell you what will work. For displaying geometry,  PV only needs Point (aka nodal point) x,y,z-coordinates, a Cell (aka Finite Element, ...)  type  and for each Cell an n-tuple of Point "array locations", for example, EnSight-format::{1,2,4,3,7,8,} or VTK-format::{0,1,3,2,6,7}.


The VTK format uses C-language 'array offsets' for Cell connectivity n-tuples. The EnSight format uses FORTRAN-language array locations for Finite Element connectivity n-tuples. It is just the way it is.


Variables are either located at Points or in Cells (conceptually Cell centers). The arrays supplied for variables must span all of the Points or all of the Cells. (I do not know how to use or about the acceptability of "partially" specified variable datum sets.) For Points with 6-DOFs versus 3-DOFs, if you want to see the three rotational DOFs, use POINT DATA arrays and fill in the Phi-x, Phi-y, Phi-z values using zeros for at those Points without a rotation.


If you want to visually display a 2-node, 6-DOF beam's geometry (a curved beam or a deformed beam) , one solution is too use a VTK Cell type 'VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE = 21'  for the beam. This will require you to add-on-the-fly to the simulation results a beam center-Point with x,y,z-coordinates and displacements for the beam's center Point using the beam's interpolation functions. (PV has a Warp Filter that will let you then scale up the deflections for visualization purposes.)


Should you have access to source code for the simulations, I can supply FORTRAN language routines that write VTK ASCII-formatted simulation results. (My personal preference is the EnSight format.)

Hi all!

I am still learning the use of paraview and I have got to such a question: How to show in a vtk input file the degrees of freedom of elements? Some of the beams have 6 degrees of freedom, some of the other elements...less or nothing at all. IS there any possibility?

Thank you a lot in advance!

Hello.
Sorry for being so slow, got lots of work with reports...
Just tried Mandelbrot filter applied to a slice. With defaults, it created
a kind of fractal rotated and translated relative to original slice. Should
I use some particular settings to just resample? Also, tried Wavelet and
Gaussian resample. These filters create volumes being appliet to the slice
so it seems that they doesnt fit my needs. Any suggestions? Is there some
simple filter to resample arbitrary surface in ParaView.
Thanks for your attention. (Now I use Mask Points with the same problem of
un-even point distribution, the best results are with Random sampling +
randomised ID strides, but without limiting the maximum number of points;
instead of this limit I preview points with glyphs and then feed these
point to the Stream tracer with custom source)

Subject: [Paraview] Defining DataItem attribute "Dimensions" as an element
	is not working
Message-ID: <CAFZvBKhj-mMrrg6X9THoOMa40tSA1b45sty6PgFeyCp4u6aV9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I am new to XML and therefore I am killing myself with making XDMF files
working. I have a (working) XDMF that contains a <Geometry> looking like:

<Geometry GeometryType="VXVYVZ">
  <DataItem ItemType="Uniform" Name="Y" Format="HDF" NumberType="Float"
Precision="8" Dimensions="200">
      grid.h5:/x_grid
  </DataItem>
...
</Geometry>

I am a bit annoyed by the static definition of the attribute "Dimensions",
that I would naively define as an element:

<Geometry GeometryType="VXVYVZ">
  <DataItem ItemType="Uniform" Name="Y" Format="HDF" NumberType="Float"
Precision="8">
      <Dimensions> 200 </Dimensions>
      grid.h5:/x_grid
  </DataItem>
...
</Geometry>

such that, later on, I could use an <Information> to import the value from
an external source, and use an XPath to define the element Dimensions.
However, Paraview does not like this second version, giving me errors like:

ERROR: In
/home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/Xdmf2/vtkXdmfReader.cxx,
line 409
vtkXdmfReader (0x36249d0): Failed to read data.

Now, I am new to XML, so I could have misunderstood the relation between
attributes and elements.
Would you please advise me about this issue? Or, do you know a better
strategy to dynamically import geometries?

Many thanks,

Marco

John,

Sam?s advice is sound, but I am curious where your data is coming from. ParaView usually does not automatically apply displacements by warping. The only exception I know of is the Exodus II reader, and in that case you can turn off the warping by unchecking the Apply Displacements checkbox.

Otherwise, it might be that the displacements are already applied in your data file. In which case Sam?s suggestion for undoing them with a negative warp should do the trick.

Hello,

In my server-side class "vtkCustom" I have a method
void vtkCustom::SetData(int i){

}


On the client side, I create a proxy to a vtkCustom object, register an
observer and set the "Data" property, which should invoke eventid=1999:
...
custom=pxm.NewProxy("myextensions","Custom")
pxm.RegisterProxy("myextensions","Custom",custom)

def fun(obj,event):
  print "CALLBACK",obj,event

custom.AddObserver(1999,fun)
vtk.vtkSMPropertyHelper(custom.GetProperty("Data")).Set(42)
...

The observer function "fun" on the client is never invoked, although the
server-side invokes that event. I'm misunderstanding some concept of
Paraviews event mechanism for sure. Can you help me correct my steps?

This is not a use-case supported in ParaView. We don't forward events from
server to client.

Hi All,

Can someone please recommend me version of Paraview that can work with
OpenGL version 4.1.0? In order to address this myself, I have been
downloading and testing older versions. I went down to paraview version
5.0.

Updating the graphic driver is one of the solutions and it works but doing
that unfortunately creates issues with two monitors I attach to my laptop
PC. So I would like to stick with this OpenGL version please.

If somebody can help me identify the compatible version that would be a
great help. I also attached the error I receive when I start paraview.

Oh, well, but how is Catalyst forwarding new time step information from
server to client?
Time step updates can occur at any time. Which event mechanism notifies the
client?
Thanks

All versions of paraview should work with OpenGL 4.1 so that error message
is really odd. Given that updating the driver fixes the issue, it could be
a driver bug. How old is the driver that is working with your other monitor?

Message-ID: <81A18720EB4BBA489B6552676D14533C67C5738B@chimbx4.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi all,

Can anyone tell me how to see the deformed shape? Right now, I can use wrap filter to magnify the displacement. But if I the magnified factor is too small, I can't see the small deformation. However, if I use much a bigger factor, the deformation will be too big that the mesh elements will have some overlap. So I wander which filter I can use to see the deformation directly.

Best,
Teng

Hi  Andrew,

Would you try to apply the set of filters with Smooth, Subdivide and
Mask Points to a slice surface? The smoothing process helps to secure
an evenly distribution of points on a slice.

Thanks

Hello, Kenichiro Yoshimi, and thanks for your help.
I tried the Smooth filter just now. It works, but it seems to be not
appropriate with very irregular point distributions. Things look only a bit
better with it.
I also tried this filter after Mask Points with Random sampling +
Randomized ID strides that generates more even distribution than initial
seed. But the Smooth filter tells that, in this case, it has "nothing to
smooth".
Mask points filter works being applied after the Smooth (with default 20
iterations) but it's not better than just Mask Point on initial slice with
Random Sampling + Randomized ID strides.
The way that look simple is just to create glyphs with Uniform spatial
distribution option and to apply the Streamlines to these glyphs as source
points. But here is an another "snake in the grass": although there is an
appropriate number of glyphs when I visualize them, the Streamline filter
tries to draw lines from every point of initial slice, not from "glyphed"
points.
So I still stay with Mask Points + Random sampling + Randomized ID strides.

Teng--

In my experience, using the WARP filter with a scale value of 1.0 on the 
displacement vector will give the actual distorted mesh at the time 
step, or load step being examined by ParaView.

If you are seeing "mesh overlaps" with the WARP filter as described 
above, then it is likely one of several conditions:

(1) The simulation datum set already contains the deformed mesh at each 
time/state-of-loading. (Check with whomever wrote the results output 
routine in your software.)

(2) The loads specified are larger than the structure can properly support,

(3) The simulation software may contain contact (aka sliding interface) 
capability that is not being used or improperly specified,

(4) ....

Hi Sam,

Thanks for your reply. Please find the attached picture in which I use scale 10. I think not only the e44 is too big, but also the blue region is out of boundary. Could you please tell me why?

Best,
Teng

Teng--

In my experience, using the WARP filter with a scale value of 1.0 on the displacement vector will give the actual distorted mesh at the time step, or load step being examined by ParaView.

If you are seeing "mesh overlaps" with the WARP filter as described above, then it is likely one of several conditions:

(1) The simulation datum set already contains the deformed mesh at each time/state-of-loading. (Check with whomever wrote the results output routine in your software.)

(2) The loads specified are larger than the structure can properly support,

(3) The simulation software may contain contact (aka sliding interface) capability that is not being used or improperly specified,

(4) ....

Hi all,

Can anyone tell me how to see the deformed shape? Right now, I can use wrap filter to magnify the displacement. But if I the magnified factor is too small, I can't see the small deformation. However, if I use much a bigger factor, the deformation will be too big that the mesh elements will have some overlap. So I wander which filter I can use to see the deformation directly.

Can anybody answer my question?
When Catalyst receives the next timestep update from some simulation every
few seconds or minutes, it sends its data to the pvserver process. The
pvserver somehow notifies the Paraview client, which will display the new
data.
If Utkarsh's comment is correct that no events can be forwarded from server
to client, then how does Paraview know that it should display the next
timestep?

I need to implement a very similar use case, for which a better
understanding of the communication between the Catalyst session, the
pvserver and the Paraview client is of high importance.
Thanks
Kolja

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Simple Superquadric
Message-ID: <1511472281059.30002@utwente.nl>

Dear Paraview users,


I am trying to use paraview simple via python shell.


Is it possible to pass superquadric source as a glyph?


For example:


ParticleGlyph = Glyph(Input=ParticleData_,GlyphType='Superquadric')


I am aware of the TensorGlyph, but it does not have access to properties such as PhiRoundness or ThetaRoundess.?


Any help would be great.

Deepak

Rephrasing my question:


Attached a tensorsTest.vtu file which contains


"positions"


"axesScales", "phiAndTheta" and orientationTensors.


So, how do I set superquadric glyph over this input data?


I would like to use something like


ParticleGlyph = Glyph(Input=ParticleData_,GlyphType='Superquadric')

Any help would be great
Deepak?

Hello

you could use Glyph with custom source, but your superquadrics will not get
parametarized the way you want.
There is no direct way to do that, it could be done with a rather
complicated programmable python filter, wich would
create the superquadric and configurate them for each of your tensors.


Best,

Mathieu Westphal

Thank you again for your help, Utkarsh!

Your solution worked but it flicks a lot because of the gimbal lock, but I
believe I could not get rid of that. Right?

Subject: [Paraview] SWKey: Way to Enlarge Upper Left Display Panel Icons for
 Picking Points and Cells?
Message-ID: <00d9266c-741b-6451-fe49-0dc64a8d871f@bresnan.net>

Hi,

I am using PV V5.4.1 64bit on MS Windows 7 Pro.

My display has a resolution 2560 x 1440. I have located the 
Edit>Settings...>Tab:General and selected the 'Override Font option.' I 
moved it from 8 to 9. Nice! For my eyes, it is a big improvement.

However, when it comes to the Upper-Left display panel icons for Picking 
Points and Cells, I either need to use the pop-up hint for the buttons 
or get at least within 12 inches of the screen with my bi-focal 
eyeglasses to see clearly the icon representing the button's function. 
(By the way, the icons are excellent representations of the button 
function.)

Is there a way to enlarge this particular button bar to obtain slightly 
larger icons?

Thanks in advance for the bother,

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView: Qt runtime errors
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQsFwFDabfiKJ-RHM0547FpJN452XaGB8MmU1BHdeujWWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm experiencing one strange situation with some of my ParaView plugin
exporters. When I create the scene, go to File->Export Scene, select output
filename and file-format, push OK and then it creates output file, but it
also reports some QT runtime errors in Output Window:

QWindowsWindow::setGeometry: Unable to set geometry 229x100+1024+492 on
QWindgetWindow/'QDialogClassWindow'. Resulting Geometry: 229x99+1025+592
(frame: 8, 31, 8, 8, custom margin: 0, 0, 0, 0, minimum size: 178x99,
maximum size: 16777215x16777215).

I get this error 2 times reported.

I first noticed this on my custom build, but, when I tried Kitware's
binaries (the latest one: ParaView-5.4.1-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit), I
also got these errors. Here is list of my steps:

1. Create Sphere source and apply Elevation Filter onto it,
2. File->Export, select WEBGL Files (*.webgl) file type and push OK button.

I tested on Windows 10 Pro x64, but, also, have confirmation it occurs
under Windows 7 x64. Btw, it also occurs on ParaView v5.4.0.

Does anyone have any idea?

Best regards,
Nenad.

Message-ID: <CAGetX-GUjtWWMNxD9K+YWkfsouhk1jWGL_E_0N8qVbNAqdLSoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm looking for some help with this question: https://stackoverflow.com/ques
tions/47465192/camera-rotation-animation

I've copied the text here for your convenience:

I have simulated a rotating cube filled with particles by moving the
gravity vector rather than changing all of the geometry. I want to use the
ParaView animation tools to rotate the camera to keep the gravity vector
pointing down so it all looks right. When moving the camera (not
animations) I would use the rotate 90 degrees tools.

How would I achieve this effect for an animation?

Many thanks,
Elijah Andrews

Hi Eman,

The Warp By Scalar filter will warp a geometry, such as a circle, according
to a scalar field at each point in the geometry. The geometry must have a
Normals array set for this to work.

The Glyph filter can draw arrows scaled according to the scalar value at
your circular geometry.

HTH,
Cory

There isn't anything in ParaView to view empty volumes. At some stage, the
volume you are talking about needs to be represented by a grid or mesh for
it to be visualized with ParaView. If you can generate a volumetric mesh
outside of ParaView, then you could use all the visualization techniques in
ParaView that apply to volume meshes. As a post-processing application,
ParaView has essentially no built-in functions for generating volume meshes.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Segfault with simple C++ filter derived from
 vtkMultiTimeStepAlgorithm
Message-ID: <BY2PR09MB02484787DCC094423ED1B70DB8250@BY2PR09MB0248.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

In my ongoing quest to get a filter to process multiple time steps worth of data into a single result field I've attempted to derive a C++ vtk filter from vtkMultiTimeStepAlgorithm.  However, the attached simple example  segfaults out when I try to apply it in paraview.  All it should do is a shallow copy of input to output for now.  I don't have much luck getting a stacktrace from paraview but it appears to be bombing at:


Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
getIconType (this=0x4109120)
    at /home/messner/Downloads/ParaView-v5.4.1/Qt/Components/pqPipelineModel.cxx:232
232            return this->getIconType(source->getOutputPort(0))



Can someone please help or point me to a minimal working example of a vtkMultiTimeStepAlgorithm filter?


Thanks,


Mark

Understand.  My monitor resolution (i.e., retinas) behind my just discovered, early cataracts, isn't getting better either.  But, you would be surprised how many people complained about the font size of text in 5.3'ish.  Thus, the bug report on text size, and the bug report on icon size.

By the way, I discovered that one of my problems in Linux land was that anti-aliased fonts were not on.  Just use a zoom tool if you are interested in finding if you have the issue.  After a bit of googling, I got it to work.  Greatly helped the fonts - but they still needed the ability to scale.

Mark,

You're simply missing a call to `this->SetNumberOfOutputPorts(1)` in
your constructor. That will get past the segfault.

Besides that, look at `vtkTemporalArrayOperatorFilter` as an example
for how to overload `RequestDataObject` to create correct output
dataset type, `RequestInformation` to determine which timesteps are
available, and `RequestUpdateExtent` to request a set of timesteps.

Subject: [Paraview] Misleading facts about Catalyst
Message-ID: <CAPN39MWfiiEpmMfaUbngJg-xEcBXfmuPWfow05-YVCGYp4FP9w@mail.gmail.com>

Heya,
I'd need some more reliable input on the Catalyst design.

Last week I asked how the server side can notify the client of recent
changes. Utkarsh wrote this wouldn't be supported by Paraview. After I
clarified that exactly this is happening during a Catalyst Live simulation,
the discussion was mute. I am still hoping for an answer how to notify the
client of any changes that might happen on the server side for example as a
result of some network activity.

Another example, some days before, I was wondering why Catalyst datasets of
considerable size take so long from the Insitu side to the Live
Visualization side, given that the Catalyst User Guide gives the impression
that everything is designed for high throughput. Someone insisted that
everything is transported through MPI until I mentioned that Paraview is
not designed for a dynamically added MPI communicator. Only then it was
explained that Catalyst data exchange is going through TCP...

The Catalyst development seems increasingly problematic. Have the Catalyst
developers left Kitware, or what is going on? We are trying to work on
improved solutions, but with the recent quality of comments we can't see
this happening.
Thank you
Kolja

Catalyst live-session is managed this custom engineering from both the
client and the server side. Hence it's not a mechanism that arbitrary
filters can use to communicate events from server to client. If you're
interested in how Catalyst live sessions manages this, start by
looking at vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxy and vtkLiveInsituLink classes.
Following the code path for NEXT_TIMESTEP_AVAILABLE might be helpeful.

I've responded to the thread. Please note that Thursday-Sunday was a
holiday in the US, hence mailing list responses were expected to be
slow.

While I am not sure which conversation you're referring to or whom you
were having that conversation, it's believable that there was
confusion between which data transfers you were referring to. All
communication between filters in a Catalyst in situ session is via
MPI. Only when you start doing "live" is when you encounter TCP. With
Live, currently the data transfer between the insitu ranks and the
"pvserver" ranks used for visualization is via TCP. Live support, in
my mind, is still in the early life cycle and needs more development
for production use.

Catalyst is indeed being actively developed and maintained. While we
try our best, responding to every mailing list inquiry can be quite
difficult. We do offer consulting services [1] if you want to work
Catalyst development team directly.

Hope that helps.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Displaying volume outside of mesh as solid

Sergey,

What Cory said is true that ParaView cannot directly render empty spaces. However, you might be able to get something close enough with the backface styling rendering controls. These controls let you render surfaces whose ?outside? is facing you different than surfaces whose ?inside? is facing you. They are an advanced property under ?Display? in the properties panel. The easiest way to get to them is to type ?backface? in the search box on the properties panel (as shown in the attached screenshot).

Try changing the ?Backface Representation? to ?Cull Frontface?. That tells ParaView to not render any part of the surface where the outside is facing to you. That should remove the outer surface in the front and instead show the inner surface that should be facing your hollow volume. The attached screenshot shows me using this to show a sphere clipped out of the center of a grid. You will note that you also see the back faces of the larger grids. That is inevitable. There is no way for ParaView to know the difference between the faces of your mesh that are on the interior hollow region and those that are on the external empty space.

(Note, that if ?Cull Frontface? does not seem to show anything different, try ?Cull Backface?. That might work if your surfaces are for some reason inward facing. That shouldn?t be the case, though, when ParaView is rendering the surface of a volume.)

I hope that helps.

-Ken

There isn't anything in ParaView to view empty volumes. At some stage, the volume you are talking about needs to be represented by a grid or mesh for it to be visualized with ParaView. If you can generate a volumetric mesh outside of ParaView, then you could use all the visualization techniques in ParaView that apply to volume meshes. As a post-processing application, ParaView has essentially no built-in functions for generating volume meshes.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hello,

I am looking for a way to display a volume that is not covered by mesh
(its located somewhere in the middle of mesh).

By default such volumes (without mesh) are shown as empty area, and
meshed area is shown as solid.

I need to reverse the solid and empty areas, so that non-meshed volume
is shown as solid, and meshed volume as empty.

Mesh is in 3D.

Is there a way to do this?

Thank you very much.

Afraid not. One potential work around would be you build the
transformation matrix and set that on the camera. You can build the
matrix yourself by changing the order of rotations.

Alan,

It would be possible to expose the boolean operations filter in ParaView
without much trouble. However, that filter is limited to
polydata-to-polydata intersection (a plus for Jeff's application), and
works best when the geometries overlap but do not share faces (a minus for
Jeff's application). For Jeff's needs, I don't think it would be that
useful.

Thanks,
Cory

Thanks, that was a very helpful reference to vtkTemporalArrayOperatorFilter.

Mark,

You're simply missing a call to `this->SetNumberOfOutputPorts(1)` in
your constructor. That will get past the segfault.

Besides that, look at `vtkTemporalArrayOperatorFilter` as an example
for how to overload `RequestDataObject` to create correct output
dataset type, `RequestInformation` to determine which timesteps are
available, and `RequestUpdateExtent` to request a set of timesteps.

Ok, vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxy::NextTimestepAvailable calls PushUpdatedState,
again pushing from client to server. I pasted the code below for
convenience.
I don't get it, where the communication in the opposite direction is
initiated. I have tried before, but the RMI and Qt signals+events usage
makes it impossible to follow the sequence of procedure calls.

  211 void vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxy::NextTimestepAvailable(vtkIdType
timeStep)  212 {  213   this->TimeStep = timeStep;  214   // Mark all
extract producer proxies as dirty.  215
vtkInternals::ExtractProxiesType::iterator iter;  216   for (iter =
this->Internals->ExtractProxies.begin();  217        iter !=
this->Internals->ExtractProxies.end(); ++iter)  218   {  219
iter->second->MarkModified(iter->second.GetPointer());  220   }  221
222   this->PushUpdatedState();  223   224
this->InvokeEvent(vtkCommand::UpdateEvent);  225 }  226   227
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 228 void vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxy::PushUpdatedState()  229 {  230
if (this->StateDirty)  231   {  232
vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxyDebugMacro(<< "Push new state to server.");
233     // push new state.  234     vtkPVXMLElement* root =
this->InsituProxyManager->SaveXMLState();  235     std::ostringstream
data;  236     root->PrintXML(data, vtkIndent());  237
root->Delete();  238   239     vtkClientServerStream stream;  240
stream << vtkClientServerStream::Invoke << VTKOBJECT(this) <<
"UpdateInsituXMLState"  241            << data.str().c_str() <<
vtkClientServerStream::End;  242
vtkSMLiveInsituLinkProxyDebugMacro(<< "Push new state to

Dear All 

I'm new in Paraview community. 

For a while, I'm thinking in developping my own template in order to
post-process results in Paraview, from my finite element solvers
(mechanical and thermal ones). 

>From an ascii file containing all the data (mesh informations and
nodal/element results), I'm thinking in writing (python) routines in VTK
format I guess. 

One can find a lot of information's on internet, but are ther some
specific docs/tools/class and so on on it? 

Thanks for any feedback

Paul,

Welcome to the community!

If your data is not in one of the large number of formats ParaView
already supports, using Python to read an map to VTK data model sounds
like a reasonable strategy. The "Programmable Source" would be the way
to go. The ParaView Guide has examples that should help you get
started.

Message-ID: <CAM-GEcQU1+grhCZPzpYsZR23ZKRikU2odVyV=EFOZx8vDWLruw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have animated particles which are imported from point data (x,y,z). I
want to add a particle trace, but I am not sure what to put for the 'seed'.
I am not using a vector field, but rather just a list of particle positions
that updates over time. How can I just add a trace to each particle in the
list?

Thanks,
Alex

Alex,

I think here the filter "Temporal Particles to Pathlines" should do the
trick.

Subject: [Paraview] post-process of CFL3D result with surfaces in paraview?
Message-ID: <CAMkQf0vGBokzpFmUHZNH9=nVjvoat1We=VdVWcrMc73yZyTb_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi paraviewers,

I am using paraview to render results in CFL3D, which is in Plot3D format,
including `abc.xyz` grid file and `abc.q` solution file. Besides, I have a
boundary condition file `abc.xyz.fvbnd` in FieldView 1.3 format which was
generated by grid pre-processor.

My problem is: How to extract the surface of the aircraft?

Because the Plot3D format is a multi-block curvilinear grid. When I use
`Extract Surface` filter, it will extract the block interfaces. My current
solution to combine blocks by `Merge Blocks` filter. Then I can extract the
surfaces, including the outer boundary and the inner aircraft walls. After
that, I need to clip the farfield and keep the aircraft walls. Is there a
better solution?

However, what I need to do is to evaluate the force on specific parts. So I
need to use the information from the boundary condition file
`abc.xyz.fvbnd` which indicates ranges of indexes in curvilinear grid as
wall of certain parts. My problem is how to use it to generate several
surfaces in paraview for rendering and integration.


p.s. I am using paraview 5.4.1. The grid consists of farfield outer
boundary and several aircraft parts' wall inner boundaries.

Hi Roman,

I guess we should add some SetName() calls in the code of
vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes.
Feel free to submit a merge request with this very small change.

In the meanwhile, what about adding a Programmable Filter on the output of
this filter and do something like:

inputpds = self.GetInput().GetPointData().GetScalars()

if inputpds != None:

  inputpds.SetName("PointScalars")


inputcds = self.GetInput().GetCellData().GetScalars()

if inputcds != None:

  inputcds.SetName("CellScalars")



Do not forget to check the "Copy Arrays" option for sure.

Best,

Joachim

Subject: [Paraview] Assemble Variables into Tensor
Message-ID: <CAD7F-KQJWfUJFbafAymhUOCXiphcgadaBu9nm1UBCma2+iP-Yg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have a vtk Polygonal Mesh with six separate arrays (sigma_xx, sigma_yy,
sigma_zz, sigma_xy, sigma_yz, sigma_xz). I'd like to assemble these into a
tensor so that I may apply the Tensor Glyph filter.

After reading that the paraview.simple.TensorGlyph
<https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.TensorGlyph.html>
expects
a symmetric tensor with the order XX, YY, ZZ, XY, YZ, XZ, I tried to
assemble the six separate arrays into a single array with the Python
Calculator, but have been unsuccessful.

I've tried a variety of approaches, including:

*Expression:* np.array([sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_zz, sigma_xy, sigma_yz,
sigma_xz])
*Array Association:* Point Data

I can make a vector of the normal stresses using the "make_vector" function
from paraview.vtk.numpy_interface.algorithms, but there is no "make_tensor"
function to assemble both normal and shear stresses into a single symmetric
tensor.

Any guidance would be most appreciated.
Many thanks,
Nick Richmond

Nick,

You can use the *Programmable Filter* instead with something like the
following script as the *Script*:


from paraview.vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa

import numpy

def make_tensor(xx,yy,zz, xy, yz, xz):

  t = numpy.vstack([xx,yy,zz,xy, yz, xz]).transpose().view(dsa.VTKArray)

  t.DataSet = xx.DataSet

  t.Association = xx.Association

  return t


xx = inputs[0].PointData["sigma_xx"]

yy = inputs[0].PointData["sigma_yy"]

zz = inputs[0].PointData["sigma_zz"]

xy = inputs[0].PointData["sigma_xy"]

yz = inputs[0].PointData["sigma_yz"]

xz = inputs[0].PointData["sigma_xz"]

output.PointData.append(make_tensor(xx,yy,zz,xy,yz,xz), "tensor")

A few months back there was a suggestion on the mailing list that you 
can apparently write a single vtk geometry and then use something like 
"map data" to load the new, updated fields (perhaps Ken posted it? - 
don't know any other details).

I agree that these vtk format limitations can be quite frustrating and 
cause quite a bit of data bloat on the disk. For these situations, I 
would normally resort to using EnSight format. This gives you full 
separation of geometry and data, with moving or non-moving geometries 
etc. EnSight does support a server-of-servers data format, which makes 
it possible to a sub-case for each process and then load them together, 
but I've never used it. Instead we have the master process write a 
single file and stream the geometry and fields information across.
The additional overhead of moving data across the network is offset by 
the fact that the filer only has a single process writing to it.

If it helps, you can take a look at the foamToEnsight utility for a 
quick overview: https://develop.openfoam.com
The harder bits are located under src/conversion/ensight/mesh/, 
src/conversion/ensight/output/, src/conversion/ensight/part/

If you find another possibility, please let us know since it will be of 
interest for other people too.

Cheers,

Thanks, I see it now - I missed it because it wasn't in the "Temporal" tab.

When I apply this filter, however, I get an error about a missing
DATA_TIME_STEPS information key. Is this something I can specify or does it
have to be in the raw data somehow?

Thanks,
Alex

Alex,

Could you specify how is your data split over time? Do you have one file
per timestep? How do you load your data with ParaView?

Yes, I have one file per timestep and each file is a list of points, X, Y,
Z, C with one point per line. I am loading it with the 'Point3D' input.
Thanks!

Hi Utkarsh,

Using the script you wrote with the Programmable Filter does the job
nicely! Thanks so much for going above and beyond to help me assemble the
arrays into a tensor. Programmable Filter never occurred to me and I am now
looking forward to exploring Chapter 13 of the Paraview Guide to see what
else I can do with it.

Many thanks,
Nick Richmond

Hello,


I am new to Paraview and C++ coming from a mostly mathematics background. I am emailing to get resources or help on writing binary XML VTK files from C++.


I have finally succeeded in using the ASCII XML VTK format for a 2D rectilinear CFD application. My ".pvtr" file is shown below.


How can I write this file and my other XML VTK files in binary from C++? Do I need a special C++ library?


filename: PVTK0000.pvtr

Subject: [Paraview] post-process of CFL3D result with surfaces in

Hi Cheng,

You can specify the i-j-k min/max indices in a structured grid dataset
to extract curviliner grid as wall using the vtkExtractGrid filter
through Programmable. Specifically, after adding Programmable Filter
and Changing the output type to vtkPolyDatat, there is something like
the following as Script:
-----
import vtk

mdi = self.GetInput()
sdo = self.GetOutput()
append = vtk.vtkAppendPolyData()

blockNo = 0
sg = mdi.GetBlock(blockNo)
ext = list(sg.GetExtent())
print ext

ext[0] = 0
ext[1] = 0
extractor = vtk.vtkExtractGrid()
extractor.SetInputData(sg)
extractor.SetVOI(ext)

surface0 = vtk.vtkGeometryFilter()
surface0.SetInputConnection(extractor.GetOutputPort())
surface0.Update()
append.AddInputData(surface0.GetOutput())

ext = list(sg.GetExtent())
ext[2] = 0
ext[3] = 0
extractor.SetVOI(ext)
extractor.Modified()
surface1 = vtk.vtkGeometryFilter()
surface1.SetInputConnection(extractor.GetOutputPort())
surface1.Update()
append.AddInputData(surface1.GetOutput())

append.Update()

sdo.ShallowCopy(append.GetOutput())
-----

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] unable to RGB voxel from tiff/jpeg slice to volume
Message-ID: <MWHPR17MB1120940F68AE170B8F02F92CD0390@MWHPR17MB1120.namprd17.prod.outlook.com>

grabbed frames from a standard youtube color video via ffmpeg
used something like $    ./imageSeriesToVolume -sz 1.0 -o test.vtk -i input*.jpeg
loaded test.vtk in paraview 5.0.1 and also paraview 5.4.1
on information tab i see:   scalars  unsigned char [33,239]

"Map Scalars"  on or off I get no RGB colored voxels, of course, because there is only one datum of type unsigned char.

Where are the other two scalars?!?

The important part you will ask me is here:

 91   io->SetFileName (filenames[0].c_str());
 92   io->ReadImageInformation();
 93
 94   if (io->GetNumberOfDimensions()==2) {
 95
 96     typedef itk::Image<unsigned char, 3>      ImageType;
 97     typedef itk::ImageSeriesReader<ImageType> SeriesReaderType;
 98
 99
100     SeriesReaderType::Pointer reader = SeriesReaderType::New();
101     std::cout << "Adding:\n";
102     for (unsigned int i=0; i<filenames.size(); i++)
103     {
104       std::cout << filenames[i] << std::endl;
105       reader->AddFileName ( filenames[i].c_str() );
106     }
107

Looks pretty standard, but no 3 scalar datums for an RGB voxel for non-false-colored volume.
It is perported to work, and all other examples i see are none different from the code i used to generate a .vtk file.


I cannot use IsoVolume If I load the jpegs directly in paraview,  but I can get RGB color voxels.
The GOAL is to use IsoVolume on a volume of RGB points from frames from a video sequence.
I have tried on and off for MANY YEARS to figure this out...    (its for an art project, metalcasting &3d Printing)

Joe,

This is more of a question for the ITK discussion forum [1], but I'll
give you a potential solution here.

The problem is that

typedef itk::Image<unsigned char, 3>      ImageType;

declares a 3-dimensional scalar-valued image, not a 3-component (RGB)
2-dimensional image. To declare an RGB ITK image, try this:

typedef itk::RGBPixel< unsigned char > RGBPixelType;
typedef itk::Image< RGBPixelType, 3 > ImageType;

I hope that helps.

Cory
