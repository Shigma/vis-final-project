Subject: [Paraview] paraview in client/server mode
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0408061136010.2025@terra.mcs.anl.gov>


Hello all,

My apologies if this question has been previously asked and answered. 
I did a brief search of the archive of the mailing list, but didn't find 
anything.

I have been able to successfully run ParaView in client/server mode, 
starting the server on a set of linux nodes, and connecting to it via a 
client running from a remote desktop machine.  In my experience, once a 
client connects to the server, the server will exit when the client 
disconnects.  My question is, is there any way to change this behavior?  
What I would like to be able to do is run ParaView as a service.  That is, 
start up ParaView in server mode, allow a client to connect to it.  When 
that client is done using the server for whatever computation/rendering it 
needs, allow the client to disconnect, but keep the server running.  I 
would then like to be able to connect to that same server from a different 
client, running on a different desktop.  The two client sessions would be 
completely independant of each other.  Is there currently a way to invoke 
this type of behavior in the server?

thanks for your help,
joe.

Subject: [Paraview] cmake is making bad decisions on our compiler
Message-ID: <200408092028.i79KSoGT014140@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hi folks;
  We're trying to compile ParaView on our Compaq Alpha Tru64 platform using 
Compaq's cxx and cc compilers rather than GNU, and I've noticed that the cmake 
process seems to be making some incorrect inferences.  So far, I have found 
that it is incorrectly setting VTK_OSTREAM_SUPPORTS_LONG_LONG and 
VTK_ISTREAM_SUPPORTS_LONG_LONG to false, even though the tests in HDF5Tests.c 
seem to produce the correct result.  Also, H5_HAVE_ATTRIBUTE in H5pubconf.h is 
being inappropriately set to 1, even though the test for that in HDF5Tests.c 
seems to fail appropriately.
  Is there any way I can debug this further?  I hate to just modify the 
created .h files and carry on, knowing they will be overwritten with incorrect 
values the next time I run cmake.  Is there any test I can perform on cmake to 
verify that *it* has built correctly on this machine?

Thanks,
-Joel

Look at the test results reported in CMakeError.log and CMakeOutput.log 
at the top of the build tree.  One of those files should have the output 
from the try-compile used to check for long long support in the streams. 
  The content of the output should tell you why the wrong result is 
being determined.

The generated build system automatically re-runs CMake when files are 
modified in order to rebuild dependencies.  This will also cause the .h 
to be overwritten.

If you are building CMake yourself then you can just go to the build 
tree and run "bin/ctest" or "make test" to run its tests.

The root cause of this problem seems to be that I was trying to use ccmake to 
change my choice of compiler.  Apparently some configuration options get 
frozen in the first time cmake does a 'configure', and that must happen before 
ccmake can change the compiler.  The result is that those options are always 
frozen in based on the default compiler, which in our case is gnu.  If the 
options are different from those required with the desired compiler, well, 
tough noogies on you.

One solution is to always specify the compilers by setting the CXX and CC 
environment variables before starting up ccmake for the first time.  I was 
able to solve my problem by deleting everything back down to an empty binary 
tree, setting those environment variables, and then doing ccmake.  (Thanks, 
Bill!)

I tried to import the following vts file into paraview-1.4.2

This works fine on a Linux box, but with IRIX 6.5 I got the
following message and no visualization of the contents:

Several major MIPSpro compiler versions were released with a buggy 
streams library.  A huge amount of work has been put into tracking down 
these bugs and putting work-arounds in VTK.  This may be yet another 
such problem.

What is your compiler version (output of CC -version)?

Also, please go to the top level of the build tree.  There should be 
files called CMakeError.log and CMakeCache.txt.  Please send me the 
CMakeError.log via private email (no need to clutter the list) along 
with the output of running

  grep EOF_RESULT CMakeCache.txt

in that directory.

Thanks,
-Brad

I have built with MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.3.1.2m,
but we have also have MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.41 installed
on one of our machines.
Some people told me, that V7.41 is much better,
so I will make a new build with the newer version.

Subject: [Paraview] More cmake issues on Compaq Alpha OSF1
Message-ID: <200408240025.i7O0PEbu017593@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hi folks;
  I'm building ParaView on a Compaq Alpha under OSF1 using MPI and OSMesa.  My 
settings for the various CMAKE MESA lines are:

OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR /usr/local/packages/paraview/Mesa/include
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY /usr/local/packages/paraview/Mesa/lib/libGL.a
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY /usr/local/packages/paraview/Mesa/lib/libGLU.a
OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR /usr/local/packages/paraview/Mesa/include
OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR /usr/local/packages/paraview/Mesa/include
OSMESA_LIBRARY /usr/local/packages/paraview/Mesa/lib/libOSMesa.a

Unfortunately my make is failing because cmake constructs Makefiles for which 
the command line places -lGL before -lOSMesa.  libOSMesa refers to entry 
points in libGL not needed elsewhere, and the linker is too stupid to look 
backwards up its lib list to resolve the missing entry points.  I'm able to 
work around the problem by manually editing the Makefiles to swap the order of 
the libs.  This is happening in the VTK/whatever/Testing/Cxx directories, 
where 'whatever' is  Graphics, Imaging, Rendering, Hybrid, or Parallel.  There 
may be other directories as well, but Parallel is as far as my build has made 
it.

Thanks,
-Joel

Usually, you get this message when some other program is already using 
that port. Perhaps another instance of ParaView is using the port? If 
not, you might run "netstat -nlp" as root (Linux) to see if some other 
program is occupying the port.
