Subject: [Paraview] What is wrong with translation?
Message-ID: <BAY2-F164QHtMFaukyC000001cc@hotmail.com>

When you translate either left/right (x) or up/down (y), the object seems to 
rotate around you as if it were on a curved screen.  To observe make your 
window widescreen (say 1280 X 512) and drag an object form left to right and 
watch it distort.  This also happens in regular square resolution but is 
less noticeable.

Does anyone know why? or how to fix it?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Bug tracker
Message-ID: <1057161726.6350.876.camel@andoria>

Hello All,

Because of recent problems with missed and forgotten bug reports,
we decided to set up a publicly-accessible bug tracker for our projects.
The bug tracking software we use is phpBugTracker
(http://phpbt.sourceforge.net/), which seems to be powerful enough for
our use, but still simple enough for users.

In order to enter a bug, you will have to create a new account. Doing so
will produce a password (which will be emailed to you), which you can
then use to login and enter bugs.

The bug tracker is available at: http://public.kitware.com/Bug and
also from the dashboard page for each project that uses the bug tracker.
(Please follow the BUGS link from the dashboards.)

Thank you.

        Andy Cedilnik

Terry,

This effect is caused by perspective.  There are two ways to translate the 
view.  ParaView rotates the camera.  The other option is to translate the 
camera.  Both will have distortion because of perspective.

The reason you see the distortion more with a wide screen is because VTK 
uses the window height as the view angle (30 degrees by default).  With a 
wide aspect ratio, the width view angle becomes large, and you get a fish 
eye lens effect.  You have two options.  First, you can turn parallel 
projection (view menu-3D View Properties-General tab) on.  With no 
perspective, you will see no distortion.  To minimize distortion, you can 
make the view angle of the camera smaller (closer to parallel 
projection).  Unfortunately, there is no user interface in ParaView to 
modify the view angle.  You can see how a smaller view angle changes 
ParaView by using the command prompt (Window menu).  Type:

[Ren1 GetActiveCamera] SetViewAngle 10

Charles.

Subject: [Paraview] Tcl Compiling Error in ParaView CVS
Message-ID: <20030711.122107.6091.2942@webmail13.lax.untd.com>

Hello,

I am trying to compile the cvs version of Paraview checked out today. While not able to install htmlhelp because I don't have the adminstration right on my machine (winXP, latest stable cygwin), I still use the generated makefile by CMake to see if it works. Anyways, I got the following errors when Tcl was being compiled:

$ make
Building dependencies. cmake.depends...
cmake.depends is up-to-date
Building Utility maketcl...
/usr/local/ParaViewComplete/tcl8.3.2/generic/tclClock.c: In function `FormatCloc
k':

ssignment
make[2]: *** [tclClock.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [maketcl] Error 2
make: *** [default_target] Error 2

The errors are referring to the assignment of the variable "timezone". I bet it won't matter to comment those two lines out, but I still would like to know if there's a better way to correct the errors. Thanks for any help!

Best wishes,

Daniel

Although VTK can be built using Cygwin, ParaView doe not build
with Cygwin at the moment. On Windows, we only support Visual Studio 6
and 7.

Hello,

(Thanks Berk for your previous reply!)

In VTK website there are man pages for those who want a quick reference to the VTK classes. I am hoping something similar can be done for ParaView. Does the BUILD_DOCUMENTATION option in ParaView's CMakeLists do that? I haven't been able to build one yet so I wish someone could let me know.

Thanks!

Hello,

I notice that ParaView doesn't yet to have pickers that you can use 
with your mouse to select objects in the scene without doing so
via the selection window or select menu. A problem may arise with 
the window/menu approach if you have a huge number of objects, or 
you don't even know which name correspsonds to which object. Is this 
going to be a feature? Thanks for letting me know.

This is a feature we will implement in future. The
only reason we haven't done so far is that it is not that
straightforward to do in parallel.

Not exactly. There is a User's Guide but it is not comprehensive enough.
I am almost done writing a Quick Start Guide. I think the two cover
enough to get someone started. We will improve the documentation
with time.

I have an extremely elementary question.  What is the right way to feed

temperature, pressure and velocity fields, all defined on the same mesh. 
I'd like to look at these as a function of time.  How do I do that?  I've

Hello,
            I installed Paraview Latest release(0.6) on Windows NT. I loaded
one of the demo files(blow.vtk). Passed it through linear subdivision
filter. now when I try to totate, pan or zoom the object deforms and it
remains so until the mouse is released. I had similar problem with one of
the .stl file too. Is it the problem with VTK binaries or Paraview. I am
using VTK 4.2(I got the binaries from standard download). Any suggestions
will be of great help.

Thanks and Regards

This is a feature. When the model displayed has too many polygons,
ParaView renders a smaller model during interaction. This is called
LOD (level of detail) and is used to keep the rendering rates high.
The threshold number of polygons for LODs can be adjusted by
selecting View, 3D View Properties, switching to the General tab
and using the LOD threshold slider. Moving it all the way to the
left should do the trick in your case. You can also adjust the quality
of the LOD model with the LOD resolution slider. The algorithm used
to generate the LOD is called Quadric Clustering in case you are
interested.

Hi Robert,

Sorry for the delay in my response. ParaView 0.6 did not have
any support for transient data other than using the animation
editor together with Tcl scripts. We have introduced time support
since then and it will be available in ParaView 1.0 (alpha
release coming in about a week). However, we have just started
on this and it is still in its infancy. Currently, ParaView 
recognizes time in a few file formats mainly ParaView and
EnSight. File series are also supported in most formats. Currently,
it is possible to specify fixed mesh with transient attributes
only in EnSight files. In every other supported format, you have
the duplicate the geometry even if it remains the same. We will
address this issue in the coming releases. Once 1.0 is out, I
can give you more hints on how you can deal with transient data.

Berk,
	This really does the trick. How do I bring in the same effect in my vtk
application? should I use vtkLODActor instead of vtkActor?(may be with
vtkOutlineFilter to get high rendering rates). Let me have your views.

Thanks for the information.  If I understand correctly, my best bet in
the short term is to write one file per time step.  That file should
contain the mesh data and any desired data fields.  I am generating my
own files, so I can choose whatever format is best.  I'd prefer to use
an XML format, but sounds like Ensight is the most useful right now.

My mesh isn't changing, so whenever the transient data support becomes
available I can use it.

Have I got that right?

thanks,
-robert

ParaView has its own logic to handle LODs. You can achieve
similar results using the LOD actor in VTK. Refer to the
online documentation or the VTK User's Guide for details.

Message-ID: <20030717.121240.754.341521@webmail06.lax.untd.com>

Hello,

This is probably a dumb question, but as I am currently in the processs 
of writing a source module, I wonder if it is necessary to write a set 
of macro functions for each member attribute. Or can I just write my 
own setXXX/getXXX functions? In fact, I am curious how the modules work:
When Parview users change the attributes of a source, does Paraview 
call the corresponding setMacro functions and call the Execute/Update
function upon clicking "Accept"? 

And I am also curious if the XML definitions for the modules are 
available online, or could anyone kindly point out the files in the 
src that contains such info?

Thanks for your help!

Best wishes,

Daniel

Hi Daniel,

ParaView just calls tcl method something like:

("%s Set%s %d", source->GetTclName(), method, value);

So, if your source is vtkSphereSource vtkTemp634 and your method is
ThetaResolution, then the call will look like this:

vtkTemp634 SetThetaResolution 100

That means you do not have to use set/get macros. That said, make sure
that things will get wrapped (no //BTX//ETX) and that the arguments are
in the right format:

set macro creates:

virtual void SetMethod(type value);

get macro creates:

virtual type GetMethod();

What do you mean by XML definitions for the modules?

Hi Andy,


Thanks for your explanation. Sorry, I meant DTD or Schema when saying 
XML definitions for the module interfaces. I would like to learn, 
for example, how to provide 3-by-3 entries that correspond to a 
tensor. Coz from my initial study of the module interfaces, I have 
to specify length=9 in VectorEntry, but its seems the result would be 
a line of 9 entries which I don't desire. I guess to achieve that I 
may need to provide three vector entries. But my understanding is 
still shallow, so I appreciate if anyone could kindly point me to 
the resources. Thanks!

Best wishes,

Daniel

Hi Daniel,

I do not think there is a 3x3 vector entry. You could look at
vtkPVVectorEntry and write one. Also, if possible, you could add
interface to your class which will allow specifying tensor in
components. Also, we probably should add a way for vector to wrap lines.
Maybe SetNumberOfEntriesInLine?

About DTD, there is none. One of the problems is that things like
VectorEntry etc are used to create widgets, so if you add new widget you
can use it right away.

Shyam,

Your deformation is probably the decimated model being used for a level of 
detail (LOD).  A simplified model is substituted for the high-resolution 
model to make interaction more responsive.  In version 0.6 this behavior 
can be reduced by changing the LOD threshold in the 3D View Properties page 
(under the View menu).  Move the slider all the way to the left.  In the 
1.0 release (binaries will be available soon), the LOD can be turned off 
completely.

Charles.

Message-ID: <20030718.093042.506.457868@webmail03.lax.untd.com>

Hello,

I was trying to create a new source derived 
from vtkUnstructuredGridSource. The idea is to supply a hexahedron 
cell with its 8 points. However, in order to render it, 
I was wondering if it is necessary to generate an array of normals 
and then call

output->GetPointData()->SetNormals(Normals);

If yes, then it seems I will run into some trouble, coz I can only
supply 8 normals, one for each point. Assuming vertex lighting,
the normal specified may not be correct at all. I am guessing this
is why in other sources, like cube, polygonal cells are used instead,
such that each point has 3 normals. 

Thanks for any corrections and help!

Best wishes,

Daniel

Hello,

The following example Ensight Gold Data (and others with similar
casefiles) causes ParaView CVS (as of jul 16) to segfault on a SuSE 8.2
system, while ParaView 0.6 (compiled when the System was yet SuSE 8.1)
and Ensight 7.4 or 7.6 read it fine. I tested both with a debug compile
with static libraries and a regular compile with shared librairies.
I also ran the same test on a Red Hat 7.2 based system, with the same
results.

The problem seems to be linked to the case file, as if I remove
the references to variables, the geometry reads fine (though only the
first part is read, while the geometry contains one volume part
and one surface element part, and Paraview 0.6 reads both).

Thanks and Regards. Great work so far !

I tested the same case file on my Red Hat 7.3 compile (CVS July 18) and
on my Windows compile. Both crash with a seg fault.

Message-ID: <20030721.083842.16315.891596@webmail02.lax.untd.com>

Hello all,

In ParaView I did the following:

Create a box
Reflect it on Zmax and Ymax planes
Group all of them (GroupPart)
Glyph the GroupPart 

However, it turns out the the glyphs only appear on the box,
not the reflections, while I notice all the normals at each point.
In my mind, glyphs should appear in every point of the grouped object.
Does anyone know what I did wrong? Thanks for your help!

Best wishes,

Daniel

It shouldn't be hard to write such a VTK filter or to
change the existing reflection filter to do it. It would
require some VTK knowledge however.

There was a bug. I fixed it. You have to get the 1.0 release
branch to get the fix (add -r ParaView-1-0 to your update/checkout).
Make sure that you update VTK as well as ParaView. The fix
should make it to the main CVS tree in the next few days.

 ?
Message-ID: <20030721.134137.487.109356@webmail14.lax.untd.com>

Hello,

After building an unstructuredGrid I would like to save it as a 
readable vtu file. Unfortunately the current XMLUnstructuredGridWriter
ParaView uses set the ZlibDataCompressor and Appended on. After 
some search, I still wonder which source file(s) I should look at to 
turn such options off. Any help and suggestions are appreciated! 
Thank you!

Best wishes,

Hello,

I guess the place to go is WriteVTKFile in vtkPVWindow.cxx, and call 
the writer->SetDateModeMethod(...). However, I have no idea what 
the argument should be in order to set the data mode to be ASCII, as
I can't find the options anywhere. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Thank you!

My best guess is that you need to edit vtkXMLWriter.cxx in your VTK/IO
directory and change line 66 from

  this->DataMode = vtkXMLWriter::Appended;
to
  this->DataMode = vtkXMLWriter::Ascii;

Recompile and you're done. I tried it and it works for me.

The problem is then that it is ASCII mode for *all* file writes. Too bad
there isn't a way to turn the flag on/off from the ParaView command
prompt.

Any better idea?

Hi Jean,

Long time ago I added a bug report/feature request entry for better file
dialog. We have one now, but is only used for client/server mode.

If we would have a better file dialog, we could do things during loading
and saving of files. Then reader and writer modules could specify
special actions. In your case, the VTK XML writer would have a checkbox
for ascii / binary.

Unfortunately there is a lot of things on the list, so this is on the
back burner.

				Andy

Hello,

Hi Jean, thanks for your hint =) It works very well.
And I am just curious what are the new features that ParaView will
have soon. Are the ParaView developers willing to give us a sneak
preview? =) Or can we find such info somewhere online?

Thank you!

Best wishes,

Daniel

Content-Type: text/plain;

I am using the latest CVS for ParaView Complete.

 

In vtkPVData.cxx function: UpdataActorControlResolutions

change lines 2820/2821:

      half = 0.5 * pow(10, ceil(oneh));

      res = (oneh > log10(half) ? half : pow(10, floor(oneh)));

 

to:

      half = 0.5 * pow((float)10, ceil(oneh));

      res = (oneh > log10(half) ? half : pow((float)10, floor(oneh)));

 

The following code in H5private.h line 212:

 

#ifndef H5_HAVE_FUNCTION

#   define __FUNCTION__  "NoFunctionName"

#endif

 

generates the following warning:

 

C:\vtk\ParaView\Utilities\hdf5\H5private.h(212) : warning C4117:

 macro name '__FUNCTION__' is reserved, '#define' ignored

 

Apparently __FUNCTION__ is reserved in MSVC7.1

 

It is probably better not to use double or single underscores at the
start of names. Compilers seem to reserve these. I have been caught by
this before!

__FUNCTION__ is definitely a Microsoft-Specific predefined macro and,
from the documentation, it is "Valid only within a function and returns
the undecorated name of the enclosing function (as a string).
__FUNCTION__ is not expanded if you use the /EP or /P compiler option."

 

Thanks

    Andrew

Hi Andrew,

I did not spend a lot of time cmakifying hdf5, so there are some
problems. It does however seem to work on all platforms we do testing.

I will look at the pow stuff.

Message-ID: <OFF4ADC68F.5C7FD52D-ONC1256D71.0041D1AD@grundfos.com>

Hi

I am trying to import data files written in NASA's PLOT3D file format into
Paraview 1.0, but so far with no luck.

Since I am not sure that I write the PLOT3D in the correct format, I would
be happy if someone could provide me with a few sample PLOT3D files
(formatted if available, else unformated/binary), which they have
successfully imported into Paraview.

Regards,

Nicholas

Look at

and
http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/plot3d.html

ParaView should be able to read all PLOT3D files described in
these sites (except unstructured, ParaView does not read unstructured
PLOT3D files). Make sure that you have all the reader options
set correctly. If you do not specify the right settings in the
reader, ParaView won't be able to read the file.
I recommend using binary PLOT3D files since the error checking
is much more robust in that case.

Hello Nicholas,

There are two different standarts for the PLOT3D format. The first one is
that readable by the vtkPLOT3DReader. This format includes, as defined in
the standart,  a well defined set of variables. The other PLOT3D format
consist of three files instead of two. These files are  *.xyz(grid)
*.nam(non-standart function names) and *.q file containing the solution
file. It's my experience that the vtkPLOT3DReader can't read files of the
second type.

mvh. Ulfar Fridjonsson

Subject: [Paraview] Corner Annotation
Message-ID: <3F27D85C.7B154203@cscs.ch>

Hello

I have not been able to figure out how to simply set a CornerAnnotation
which can be updated during an Animation, for example, going thru an
EnSight TimeSet, I'd like to use $pvTime to update my text string, with
a time-dependent value..., as in 

timestep = 1
timestep = 2
etc...

Additionally, it would be great to have better control of the screen
position (x, y pixels) of the 4 annotations. Any hints, or does the
automatic font size control prevent us from positioning a label where we
want it?

Thanks for the tips.
Jean

Hi Jean,

There was already feature request for this. I am not sure if it is in
the bug tracker or not, but it should be done at some point.

You can do it already though. Use Script action in the animation menu
and do something like:

[ [ [$Application GetMainWindow] GetMainView ] GetCornerAnnotation ]
SetCornerText "timestep = $globalPVTime"

And make sure the visibility is on.

Hello,

Does anyone happen to use vtkXdmfDataSetWriter? If yes, could you 
kindly let me know if my module entry is correct:

<Writer input="vtkUnstructuredGrid"

        extension=".xdmf"

The module was loaded and as I tried to save an unstructured grid as
an xdmf file the following errors were produced:

There was a VTK Error in file: /home/danielgo/ParaViewComplete/ParaView/Widgets/vtkKWApplication.cxx (407)

Hi Daniel,

I never tried Xdmf writer, but from your message I suspect the API is
wrong. I will look into that.

Hi Daniel,

Update the CVS of Xdmf and ParaView. There is a vtkXdmfWriter there
which seems to be working.

Hi Andy,

While compiling the CVS version, I just want to let you know I added
FileName Set/Get Macro and a Write method which calls the writer's
WriteXXX methods and a ofstream:

int vtkXdmfDataSetWriter::Write( void )
{
ofstream outfile (this->GetFileName());
this->WriteHead();   // Not implemented yet
this->WriteGrid();
this->WriteAttributes();  
this->WriteTail();   // Not implemented yet
outfile.write(this->Internals->XMLStream->str(), this->Internals->XMLStream->pcount());

return(1);
} 

It seems working pretty fine, except I still have to figure out 
what WriteXXX to call and in what order. It also seems the WriteHead 
and WriteTail are not yet fully done. And I will let you know if the 
CVS version works for me.

Thanks you! 

Best wishes,

Daniel

Hi Daniel,

Check Xdmf CVS and you will see vtkXdmfWriter (not
vtkXdmfDataSetWriter). That one works in most cases. Let me know if you
have any issues.
