Subject: [Paraview] Lookup table bug for the filter following a volume
	representation
Message-ID: <BANLkTimJWhpeo+e=jbtF+fdxK0XmSX=uug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I submitted a bug related to Lookup table here :
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12180

Basically, if you select a 'Volume' representation for a filter and plug
another filter, the new representation lookup table freezes to a default
red-to-purple scale.
Can anyboy tell me if this is reproducible elsewhere than on my system
(Linux, NVidia, PV-3.11.1 git-master)?

Thanks a lot
Jerome

Hi Jonathan, It looks like we missed installing lapack in the binary and the
machines we tested on likely already had it installed in the system. I'll
look into slipping the missing .so into the binary shortly.

Volume rendering can be confusing. Make sure you are setting the
lookup table and the scalar opacity function proxies on the
representation correctly. Easiest way to figure this out is to mimic
the action in ParaView and save out a Python trace or state or XML
state and inspect it to identify all related proxies

Looks like there's some issue with vtkQuadricClustering for this
dataset. Looks like cell #2856 doesn't have any points and that's what
confusing the filter. While we investigate that, you can disable use
of quadric clustering by unchecking the "LOD THreshold" in the Setting
dialog, Render View page.

Hi Philipp,

You need to check the "Compute Normals" box on the properties panel of the
contour filter.  Alternatively, you can apply the "Generate Surface Normals"
to any polydata dataset to enable correct Gouraud shading.

Thanks!
The "Compute Normals" is checked in the contour filter after the  
CleanToGrid filter, however the Gouraud shading does not work. But using  
an additional "Generate Surface Normals" then does the trick, at least  
partially. The contours look nicer than without Gouraud shading,  
obviously, but the best result (and also the cheapest one, I will use it  
on large data sets) would still be obtained when directly doing a contour  
on the original rectilinear data without transforming it to unstructured.

Thus, I was wondering whether I should submit the present case also as a  
bug report, as I guess also other people might need coloured isosurfaces  
when running MPI?

Best regards,
Philipp

Subject: [Paraview] independent colorbar range in different views of same
	session?
Message-ID: <191A2C40-1DFB-4AA4-908B-A621A38A308A@mimectl>

Hello,

I am a ParaView newbie trying to visualize two different types of time-varying data (let's say density and pressure) for the same analysis in two separate views of the same session of ParaView. 

I have set up the two views, where view 1 has the pressure data turned on and view 2 has the density data turned on. I made a colorbar for each view, and have changed the colorbar title to pressure for view 1 and density for view 2. (To make these colorbars, I first clicked on the pressure data in the pipeline browser, then clicked on view 1, then created the colorbar for pressure; then I clicked on the density data in the pipeline browser, then clicked on view 2, then created the colorbar for density).

However, when I try to change the scale of each colorbar so that it only spans its data, then the colorbar for the other data is automatically changed. Does anyone know how to set the colorbar ranges independently for each view (say 1e5-2e7 Pa for pressure, in view 1, and 1-1000 g/cc for density, in view 2)?

Thanks,
Emily

Hello Emily,

ParaView tries to use the same color transfer function for each
variable in all views to ensure that one perceives the same value
wherever they see a particular color. I expect this is what is
happening here. What you might do then to get around this behavior is
to create a copy of your array and color by that array in one view or
the other.

The simplest way I can thing to do that is to use the calculator
filter.  First choose either point or cell alignment to find the array
you want, then set the calculator expression to be simply the name of
the array you are making a copy of. Optionally set the output name if
you don't want the copy to be called "RESULT". Lastly choose the new
array as the one to color by in one of the two views.

Hey,

David, Emily seems to be describing that she already has two different attributes, so I'm suspecting that somehow she's mistakenly coloring by the same attribute in both views... 

Emily, as David is saying, (at least my understanding of) what you're wanting should be the default behavior. Make sure that when you click on each view the "color by" combo box changes which attribute it's listing, and that each colormap has "Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range" checked in the colormap editor.

Attached is a screen shot that I made "right out of the box" with all default settings, just having the surface colored by different attributes in different windows, and choosing an alternative to the blue-white-red colormap for Elevation.

If you're still having trouble, maybe let us know which version of ParaView you're using, and on which platform, and whether you built it yourself.

-Eric

Hah Eric so there! :)

The calculator filter will do what you want. There are probably better
ways but the calculator will only take a minute to try.

Thanks guys! The calculator filter does work.

Kudos to both Eric and David for making me understand the actual problem I was having, and then for giving me a solution.

Cheers,
Emily

Hah Eric so there! :)

The calculator filter will do what you want. There are probably better
ways but the calculator will only take a minute to try.

Subject: [Paraview] OSMesa Desired GL includes not used
Message-ID: <4E0E3AFC.6010402@ohio.edu>

When I build ParaView with OSMesa only GL/gl.h is not found.

My build of mesa is installed in /home/kevin/mesa_osmesa.

The system mesa headers are not installed.

At the end of this e-mail, is the tail of the output of a verbose
build There is no -I/home/kevin/mesa_osmesa to be found.

If I install the system mesa-libGL-devel package ( required for
qt-devel which I need for my mesa-xlib build ) the build
succedes, so Paraview is not using the gl.h associated with the
OSMesa library.

Subject: [Paraview] Weird boost error during ccmake
Message-ID: <4FF1FAB9-B51B-48D4-89BA-5A904E20E06C@llnl.gov>

I got this error.  I hope it's obvious why I think it's weird.  I'm building against boost 1.46.  Or thought I was.  This message seems to imply it's looking at the system boost in /usr/include/boost

 Your system is using an outdated version of Boost (1.33.1, found in
 /nfs/tmp2/rcook/ParaView/3.10/build/boost_1_46_1).  Some of the graph
 processing filters require version 1.36.0 or later to build on 64-bit
 platforms.

Thanks Pat,

that is what I get:

cd /opt/paraview/3.10.1/
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/paraview-3.10.1 lib/paraview-3.10.1/paraview

bash: lib/paraview-3.10.1/paraview: No such file or directory

I guess the path was wrong and you meant:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/paraview-3.10 lib/paraview-3.10/paraview

lib/paraview-3.10/paraview: symbol lookup error:

or

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/paraview-3.10:lib/paraview-3.10/paraview

So none of them worked and I ran the debug commands:

ldd: lib/paraview-3.10.1/paraview: No such file or directory


and (I guess you meant that):

What is wrong here is that all the qt-stuff is linked against the qt
living in /usr/lib64/ which is the wrong qt (Qt version 4.3.5 in
/usr/lib64). The right one is in /opt/qt/4.6.2. Therefore, I defined
"QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE /opt/qt/4.6.2/bin/qmake".
This worked for all versions up to 3.8.1. How can I avoid this wrong
linking?

And finally:

nm --demangle lib/paraview-3.10/libQtNetwork.so.4 | grep
QNetworkAccessManager

nm: 'lib/paraview-3.10/libQtNetwork.so.4': No such file


There is no libQtNetwork.so.4 in my paraview install directory for
3.10.1 whereas 3.8.1 has this. I guess this is a consequence of the
wrong linking?

Thanks Bastian

I had a similar problem on Ubuntu 11.04, if that helps, where the
reason turned out to be cmake failing to find X11 due to the new
system locations. Check if you HAVE_OSMESA in the cache, if yes, trace
it up, for me it was find X11. In any case, you do not want to install
libosmesa to only defer the problem.

Message-ID: <1309712113.6785.32.camel@F-UB>

Hello,

i wanted to plot some streamlines from unsorted point-data. Maybe my
filter-pipline is interesting for other users. If desired I or somebody
else can add it to the wiki (http://paraview.org/Wiki/Custom_Filters ).
So my pipeline:

I read my point data with the h5part-plugin-reader. Then I use the
calculator to create a vector. Next I use the delauny-filter to create
an unstructured grid from my unsorted point data. And at last i use the
stream-tracer.

regards

Subject: [Paraview] Extension to pq3DWidget
Message-ID: <82A6681F0CAFC84287B0E2664CE9682C013C3BD0@GLKMS2114.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi,
 
I need to extend the pq3DWidget class by adding another type of widget
(like the "Spline" widget already present).  Looking at the ParaView
source code, the pq3DWidget method createWidgets() initially cycles
through all the interfaces loaded as plugins, which are found using the
command 
 
QList<pq3DWidgetInterface*> interfaces =
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getPluginManager()->findInterfaces<pq3DWi
dgetInterface*>();
 
My question is, how do I add interfaces of type pq3DWidgetInterface, so
that I can implement my own 3D Widget subclass?  Is there a CMake macro
to do this?  Can anyone point me towards a relevant example?
 
Thanks,
 
Michael

Hi Pratik,

Have you tried to use pvserver with the option "--use-offscreen-rendering" ?
This solved the similar problem in my case.

I think offscreen rendering not depends on the display resolution.

I'm adding a toolbar to paraview tha add some filters to the pipeline

so that I cant call it's apply() slot.

does anybody know if the object inspector widget is a child or a descendant?

Hi Guys,

the image reduction is not working with the Applet when the applet is
not allowed to execute some JavaScript code.
This usually happen only on Mac when the browser used is not Safari.
Is it the case ?

Thanks,

Seb

to find an object that can be cast to pqObjectInspectorWidget returns a NULL

Hi,

No, the browser that we use is Chrome (on Linux) or Firefox (on Windows).
The ParaviewServer is deployed on our cluster, accessed through a ssh 
tunnel but I don't think it's the problem. No?

There;s a cmake-macro that does that for you (refer to
ParaViewSource/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake for details). The usage is
similar to other plugin macros.

# Creates implementation for a pq3DWidgetInterface to add new 3D widgets to
# ParaView.
# ADD_3DWIDGET(OUTIFACES OUTSRCS
#   CLASS_NAME <pq3DWidget subclass being added>
#   WIDGET_TYPE <string identifying the 3DWidget typically used in the <Hints/>
#               for the proxy when specifying the PropertyGroup.

Hum,

if the JavaScript renderer successfully reduce the image size by 2
when interacting then your problem do not come from your cluster/ssh
config. Moreover, do you face the same issue with our demo server ?
(http://paraviewweb.kitware.com/)
The only problem that I see and that I'm aware of is the communication
between the applet and the browser.
I always wanted to avoid it as it is not fully reliable on all the
platform and use some direct networking communication but didn't had
time yet to handle it.

I'll see what I can do...

Seb

Hi,
 
It does not seem to be possible to display text annotations on top of 2D
Render Views.  Am I missing something?  If not I think this would be a
very useful feature.
 
Many thanks,

mainwindow.

I have built a Toolbar plugin in paraview with a button that applies
extractblock filter to a multiblock dataset
so as to get all the blocks seperately in different objects in the pipeline
browser.

I achieve getting the number of blocks from the selected multiblock but I
don't
want to push apply button for each filter that has been created

so I think about going trough the Qt hierarchy and calling the apply slot of
the object inspector
 to have something like auto-apply but only for that button

great thanks

papa

Create a pqAutoApplyReaction and set autoApply on and than set if off once
the multiblocks are created.

Pat, all

I tried once more with taking the qt 4.6.2. into LD_LIBRARY_PATH (build
third party software off). I still get the same error.

How to debug further?

Okay, so going back, a couple of emails ago, you said your paraview is
linking against wrong Qt right? Is that fixed or still the case? If
that issue is still there, then let's fix that first.

Using the latest cmake, if you set the qmake correctly, it should
work. However, if CMakeCache.txt is still referrring wrong Qt, then in
an empty directory, create an empty CMakeCache.txt with the
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE set to the correct one and reconfigure ParaView.
That should ensure that cmake uses the right Qt from the get-go.

Let's leave PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES on for now. And
don't worry about setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH before "make install".
Let's not do install at all. Let's stick with build paraview and make
sure it's using the right QT.

ldd ./bin/paraview should point to the correct Qt libraries.

Subject: [Paraview] unexpected usage of ghost sets for geometry and topology
	with XDMF reader
Message-ID: <CAOVFbFjAB8EuL87vH-DU-kLP7S8=pjW2VWB1pw1YJMXeoCkBYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using XDMF for storing results of parallel unstructured finite
element computations. I worked with some of the developers for the
XDMF reader on getting proper display of the overlapping (ghost)
entities a while back, but it doesn't seem like those changes were
really merged into the trunk. Paraview 3.10 still doesn't appear to
eliminate duplicate points and cells quite the way I would expect it
to. Is there anybody still working on that functionality that could
help me get some changes permanently made to paraview? I can supply
data sets of various complexity (quad,tri,hex,tet, (bi-)quadratic,
dynamic, etc) in a dropbox folder and am am willing to change the way
we're organizing the information in XDMF (though if my memory serves,
we had a patched paraview that worked fine with our current
representation).

Thanks,
Chris

Chris,

Do you any additional info about the patches that you are referring
to? Did they make it into Xdmf repo, but just haven't made it into
ParaView yet?

Chris,

I was able to locate the conversation/patch you are referring to. If
there's a sample dataset that you can share that I can use for
testing, I'd like to add a dashboard test for this so that we don't
break this functionality in the future.

Utkarsh,

Thanks a lot. I'm putting together a good data set to use as a test
and will put it on a server later tonight or tomorrow.

Subject: [Paraview] Histogram Question
Message-ID: <CALoAP+1=Do2YaL9Z_20_P2Png+Fx8ib=WCHoNXb4jFcxf8Wt7g@mail.gmail.com>

I apologize in advance if the answer to this question is obvious, but I
wasn't able to find the answer in any forums on the web.

I have imported a time series of data structured points vtk files into
paraview.  I wish to make a movie of a histogram of the data in time.
 However, there is a subset of points that I wish to exclude.  These points
have a value of lets say, -10, while all other points are in the data range
0-45.

I can't figure out how to exclude these points from the histogram.  Setting
a custom bin range (0-45) just seems to bundle all of the points that are
less then 0 into the bin centered near 0.  I can eventually eliminate them
from the plot if I change the x axis range to 5-45, but then I am losing
some valuable data.

Is this possible in paraview?

Thanks.

Ari Adland

Hi,

I may be a bit persistent about this and may be complicating things
more, but went on to port VisIt Shapefile database reader as a
ParaView plugin via VisItBridge

https://gitorious.org/avtshapefilefileformat_plugin

because I wanted to examine as much options as possible.

So now we have three options: ParaViewGeo (LGPL), vtkGDALVectorReader
(MIT License), and the VisIt reader (BSD License). Each of the three
turned out to have its strengths, to illustrate I took a screenshot:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7352393/ShapefileReadersScreenshot.png

where the two above are represented in Surface and the two below are
in Surface With Edges. Observations are

* ParaViewGeo and vtkGDALVectorReader represent polygons in lines,
  whereas the VisIt reader in polygons, propably due to difference in
  philosophy in handling polygons with holes, which is not supported
  natively in VTK. VisIt reader is characteristic in this point
  because it offers an option to tessellate polygons using the OpenGL
  tessellator.

* The VisIt reader with tessellation and vtkGDALVectorReader allows
  field values to be loaded as well.

For our own particular purpose vtkGDALVectorReader turned out to be
best suited, but for others other readers might be better. Either way,
I am really looking forward to seeing one (or more) of them included
in ParaView/VTK.

Hi Takuya,

First of all thank you so much for testing and improving
vtkGDALVectorReader and for this nice comparison..

Yes, vtkGDALVectorReader does not support polygons and hence
tessellation  because holes are not supported natively in VTK.  User
could run other filters on top of the output of vtkGDALVectorReader (I
can't remember the name of the filter but I think it was
vtkTriangleFilter ) to produce polygons.

Glad to hear that. I will try to get vtkGDALVectorReader into VTK
sometime soon.

Thanks again.

Hi all,

Does the current binary release work in crystal eyes stereo?
If so is the command paraview  --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes" ?

Thanks

Hi,

Crystal Eye support is built into the current binary release. You will need
run paraview with the following command arguments:

--stereo --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes"

You will also have to make sure your video card supports quad buffering and
has it enabled.

Does the latest version of ParaView support multi-touch input via Windows 7 or any other way?
Thanks,

This is interesting. I was also wondering if the ParaView Mac version
would support the multi-touch gestures of the trackpad. It will be
really useful.

Thanks

Hi,
Currently ParaView doesn't support multi-touch input. I would start by
reading http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qtouchevent.html.

You can add support by extending pqRenderViewBase or
QVTKInteractorAdaptor to convert the touch events to current mouse
events.

If you want the ability to change what a touch event does, You might
want to look at extending the vtkCommands to include common touch
events like swipe, pinch, rotate and then making a custom interactor
just for touch events.

Hi,

I have no issue using crystal eyes in Windows 7 64 with the 3.10.1
release binary.

My command option is:
paraview.exe --stereo --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes"

Add my Nvidia Control panel information has stereo enabled and stereo
display mode to Generic active stereo. See my attached image.

Utkarsh,

thanks for your help. I have no problem running paraview out of the
build directory and

ldd ./bin/paraview

points to the correct QT libraries.
However, after a make install I cannot start the installed paraview and

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/paraview-3.10 ldd lib/paraview-3.10/paraview

points to the wrong (system) QT library now. SO I guess there goes
somthing wrong doing make install?

Regards Bastian

Ok. Let's do one step at a time though. I find it much easier to debug
issues remotely that way.

Next step, do make install into a /tmp/ParaViewInstall directory.
You'll have to ensure that the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to point to
/tmp/ParaViewInstall.
Once the install happens, execute the following and post the result.

> tree /tmp/ParaViewInstall  > /tmp/dir_structure.txt

Subject: [Paraview] How do you set LIC parameters in a python trace script?
Message-ID: <4E14C5C5.6040303@lbl.gov>

Hi,

I am able to use a script written from python trace to render a LIC but 
when I try to change any of the LIC parameters also from python trace I 
get attribute errors (below). In the python shell launched from PV a dir 
shows these attributes, however dir run from in the script shows they 
are missing. How do I get the LIC attributes to be seen in a python script?

Thanks
Burlen

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test4.py", line 60, in <module>
     DataRepresentation2.LICNumberOfSteps = 12
   File 
"/work/ext/ParaView/PV3-3.10.0/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 207, in __setattr__
     "to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute LICNumberOfSteps does not exist.  This class 
does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to 
typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.

Burlen,

Are you sure the plugin is loaded?

Yep, it's loaded using the LoadPlugin function along with our reader 
plugin.  PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG=1 verified it. If I don't change any of the LIC 
attributes the script runs and I get a LIC successfully rendered.

What I just now noticed is that if the LIC plugin gets loaded before 
other plugins the problem goes away! So something about loading other 
plugins after the LIC makes LIC's attributes disapear. I sent a script 
that illustrates by loading the SLAC tools plugin. If you swap the loads 
the script will run.

Michael,

No - Paraview won't display text on top of a 2D rendered view.  This sounds like very useful functionality - I wrote up a feature request in the bug tracker.

Thanks,

Alan

Hi,

It does not seem to be possible to display text annotations on top of 2D Render Views.  Am I missing something?  If not I think this would be a very useful feature.

Many thanks,

Michael

Subject: [Paraview] Ongoing Work to Release Unused Memory from Pipeline
Message-ID: <B7D1DC98-8B74-4982-9D44-B2B1A97D776D@bluequartz.net>

Is there any ongoing or upcoming work in ParaView to have some sort of option to dispose of unused memory from filters that are higher up in the pipeline? We are thinking of basing our Materials Science based software package on VTK and then make the filters available in ParaView but our data sets are already pushing the memory limits of "PCs". Having multiple copies of the data in memory would just make a bad situation worse for us. I know if I write my own pipeline in VTK I can manually dispose of memory from each pipeline step. Just wandering if this type of capability is going to be exposed in someway in an upcoming version of ParaView.

Thanks

Hi Rich,

It looks like your VisItBridge submodule is not up to date, so could
you run the following commands in the root of your source directory
for me and return me the results?

git fetch origin --prune
git checkout master
git pull --rebase
git submodule update
git status

Subject: [Paraview]  pqAutoApplyReaction
Message-ID: <CAK5MA4E50EjsPZH7Tk0ZzpQzNzjAdbf_vs3Ruf9O70-dgyVcwA@mail.gmail.com>

I have built a Toolbar plugin in paraview with a button that applies
extractblock filter to a multiblock dataset
so as to get all the blocks seperately in different objects in the pipeline
browser.

I achieve getting the number of blocks from the selected multiblock but I
don't
want to push apply button for each filter that has been created

so got suggested about creating a pqAutoApplyReaction object and setting
auto-apply to true, creating my filters
and setting it back to false.

pqAutoApplyReaction * autoapply=new pqAutoApplyReaction();
gives me an error:
ASSERT: "parentObject != NULL"

and:
pqAutoApplyReaction * autoapply=new pqAutoApplyReaction(a);
where "a" is a QAction* attribute of my GUI class
gives me an error:
libGUIMyToolBar.so: undefined symbol:
_ZN19pqAutoApplyReaction12setAutoApplyEb

do I have to put a specific object in pqAutoApplyReaction constructor?

Hi papa,

The problem is that we forgot to implement the static method
setAutoApply(bool)! If you could create a bug report I will fix this
issue. For now you can call the static method:

pqObjectInspectorWidget::setAutoAccept(bool);

which does the same thing as the reaction but doesn't save the state
in your settings file.

Hi Tomislav,

Are you aware of vtk polyhedron support
(http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Polyhedron_Support)? Instead of
manipulating the polydata structure yourself, you can insert the
polyhedrons into an vtkUnstructuredGrid and then save the unstructured
grid using vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter. There are some examples in
Graphics/TestPolyhedron0(1).cxx.

Thanks.

Mike,

There are currently no such plans in the near future, at the least.
But that's definitely something we should start thinking about more
seriously as we start dealing with larger and larger datasets.

Subject: [Paraview] Interesting bug when using windbladereader and multiple
	time steps
Message-ID: <1310087607.73718.YahooMailClassic@web36508.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've noticed a bug when using the windbladereader; the portion of the code that reads the blade file is one timestep behind the code that reads the field.? For instance, if one is at timestep i, the field data will correspond with timestep "i" but the blade data will correspond with the last timestep chosen.? When a data set is opened initially both the blade and field items are set to the initial timestep.? After one starts changing the timestep, the bug makes an appearance. 

In the code, the blade and field specify their timesteps (individually) based on the bladeInfo and fieldInfo objects, respectively.? These info objects are related to the outputVector of requestInformation -- I wonder if this is some kind of pipeline issue?

Thanks,
Sohail

I'll take a look at it.  I may need a time dependent data set if I can't
figure it out though.

to some extent.

Having multiple copies of the data in memory would just make a bad situation worse for us. I know if I write my own pipeline in VTK I can manually dispose of memory from each pipeline step. Just wandering if this type of capability is going to be exposed in someway in an upcoming version of ParaView.

I believe that data set went you (related to the updates I made for the wind blade reader)...the one with ten timesteps, should do the trick. ?Do you still have it?

I don't know if it applies to your pipelines, but each time I write an XML
ServerManager to expose a VTK filter in ParaView, I add a ckeckbox for the
vtkAlgorithm's function "ReleaseDataFlag" :

        <IntVectorProperty
                           name="ReleaseDataFlag"
                           command="SetReleaseDataFlag"
                           number_of_elements="1"
                           default_values="0"
                           animateable="0">
            <BooleanDomain name="boolean"/>
            <Documentation>
                  Turn release data flag on or off for all output
ports.
            </Documentation>
         </IntVectorProperty>

Obviously, it implies that the filters with RealeaseDataFlag set to true
will reexecute at each update, even it they are not marked as modified.
You can find such examples in my github repo that exposes VTK native filters
to ParaView: http://github.com/jeromevelut/Peavip . All the
vtkImageAlgorithm derived filter propose this option.

Message-ID: <CAK5MA4GTO-5Sv4qsiYZr-zYrsaHp6p4aigwZSK1R8-81cK16Nw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all
I have built a Toolbar plugin in paraview with a button that applies
extractblock filter to a multiblock dataset
so as to get all the blocks seperately in different objects in the pipeline
browser.

I achieve getting the number of blocks from the selected multiblock but I
don't know how to set the block indice
of an extract block filter after having it buit.

*
vtkSMProperty* property= [the pqPipelineSource resulting from
createFilter]->GetProperty("BlockIndices");

vtkSMIntVectorProperty * indices=
vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(property);

*but *"indices->GetNumberOfElements();" *returns 0 while the
compositeTreeWidget displays the blocks' hierarchy.

how can I modify a vtkSMProperty within the code?

thanks in advance!

assuming you're inside a pqSomething class and have access to all the usual pqSMAdaptor stuff. From raw servermanager stuff it'd look different

Subject: [Paraview] Remove Input Connections
Message-ID: <201107081658.56896.jorge.pena.pastor@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have being trying to remove an input from a filter with multi-inputs without 
succes.

My filter.xml is as follows:

 <SourceProxy name="MyFilter" class="vtkMyFilter" label="MyFilter">
     <InputProperty
        name="Input"
		port_index="0"
		immediate_update="1"
		command="AddInputConnection"
		repeatable="1"
		>
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
             <Group name="sources"/>
             <Group name="filters"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
             <DataType value="vtkDataImage"/>
           </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>
</SourceProxy>

I add connections in my code using vtkSMInputProperty:

vtkSMProperty* p  = pipelineSource_myFilter->getProxy()->GetProperty("Input");
vtkSMInputProperty *inputProp = vtkSMInputProperty::SafeDownCast(p);
 
inputProp->AddInputConnection(pipelineSource_input->getProxy(),0);


What I had tried so far is:

1) to add a RemoveInputConnection in the xml file, but I get the following 
runtime error:
vtkProcessModule (0x8f4030): Object type: vtkMyFilter, could not find requested 
method: "RemoveInputConnection"

2) to add a fake port, and then redirect AddInputConnections calls to that 
port to RemoveInputConnection method withthe normal port
This method works in which concers to vtkMyFilter, but the pqPipeline is not 
updated properly...So I get the following error when I try to remove 
pipelineSource_input: Cannot remove source with consumers.

Please, can you help me to understand which is the proper way to deal with 
adding/removing multiple inputs of a filter in Paraview based applications?

Thanks in advance!

Ok, I'm able to replicate the bug.  The test file I have (
http://vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTKLargeData.git;a=tree;f=Data/WindBladeReader;h=3459e8ded59eb05796e922d90200bd4e83231df0;hb=HEAD)
only has 2 time steps so I may need another set of files from you with more
time steps.

Playing around with the reader in ParaView, I think it may be worse than you
realize.  Only the time information for the field is getting updated
properly and if you go back in time steps, the blade time step either still
increases or stays the same if it has hit the last time step.  I need to
talk to our temporal pipeline expert to figure out the proper behavior.  One
question though -- is there a reason that the reader doesn't return a
multiblock with the 3 grids in it instead of having 3 separate output
ports?  I'm thinking that if the output was changed to a multiblock then
these time issues would go away.

Thank you for looking into this. I only modified the windbladereader to handle a slight format change, so my knowledge here is a bit limited (in regards to its original design) but I'll help out when necessary.? From what I see there are two outputs (one field, one blade).? I guess the nice thing about having a separate output for the blade is that I can render it separately from the field. 

I can send you a data set with more timesteps (similar to what you are using now, actually), problem is my DSL connection has a poor upload.? Would three or four timesteps do?

Ok, I'm able to replicate the bug.? The test file I have (http://vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTKLargeData.git;a=tree;f=Data/WindBladeReader;h=3459e8ded59eb05796e922d90200bd4e83231df0;hb=HEAD) only has 2 time steps so I may need another set of files from you with more time steps.



Playing around with the reader in ParaView, I think it may be worse than you realize.? Only the time information for the field is getting updated properly and if you go back in time steps, the blade time step either still increases or stays the same if it has hit the last time step.? I need to talk to our temporal pipeline expert to figure out the proper behavior.? One question though -- is there a reason that the reader doesn't return a multiblock with the 3 grids in it instead of having 3 separate output ports?? I'm thinking that if the output was changed to a multiblock then these time issues would go away.?

 Hi,

Thank you for your time to read this. I want to ask how to display values
with colors on a 3D surface..

In my case, I have a byu surface. For each point of the surface, I have a
t-value on it. I want to display the t-value on the surface using different
colors. How can I do this?  I read the manuscript and searched, but it
doesn't seem to help me...
Thank you very much.

Jidan

Hello all, I'm sorry to post this, I've tried to find the answers myself but I'm afraid I need some remedial help.  I've been looking at the wiki pages and done a search here with MarkMail, but I'm afraid I need even more step by step instructions than I can find anywhere.
 
My goal is to use Paraview to render a .vtk file inside a webpage so that others can view it and rotate it.  I found http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_JavaScript_Introduction and I'm trying to get the header part set up.  I've downloaded TomCat and got that to run as localhost:8080, but I'm not sure how to obtain the PWService.war and pw-config.properties files.  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Building gives instructions for Unix but I'm running Windows XP.
 
I'm not even sure I'm in the right place but my google searches sent me to cmake.org instead of paraview.org.  I'm afraid the instructions on http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install lose me completely.  I've been trying to build Paraview with CMake thinking that was where those files would come from, but I'm getting errors generating it.  Honestly, I'm not even sure I'm on the right track at all.
 
Can someone please walk me through the process?
 
Thank you so much,
 
Tom

Hi Tom,

You started well in the sense that the main page of ParaViewWeb is here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb

Although, setting up a web server that use ParaView to generate
interactive 3D content requires to build the tools and most of its
dependency. On Unix type platform (Linux, Mac, ...) those steps are
easy to reproduce which is not the case on window if you never did it
before. Moreover, no-one (that I know of) ever deployed a ParaViewWeb
server on windows.
So you should consider ParaViewWeb as Unix only (server side).

If you managed to find a Linux or a Mac for your server, you will
first need to compile ParaView. I guess you should find enough
documentation on the web on how to do it. Once you achieved that, the
experience you gained during that process should help you
understanding what is written in the ParaViewWeb building page. If you
build ParaView, don't bother with the GUI and Qt part as it is not
needed for ParaViewWeb, just disable them at configuration time using
CMake.

If you need some explanation on how to build ParaView on Linux, then
post another email on the mailing list, some other community member
may be able to help.

Dear all,

How do you handle the change of the center of rotation for the view when
using the full screen mode ?
Is there any magic shortcut that does the job of the "pick center" button ?

Thanks,

Sorry, there's no such shortcut. Youll have to switch out of fill screen mode.

Try applying the Threshold filter to remove all points outside your range of interest and then apply the histogram filter to the result of the threshold filter.

You might want to double check the version.hpp file in
/nfs/tmp2/rcook/ParaView/3.10/build/boost_1_46_1/boost to ensure it is
setting the correct version number, as the Boost find module uses that
file to compute the version. I have,

#define BOOST_VERSION 104601

The parts of the version number are extracted from this line. If you
want to send me the CMakeCache.txt off-list I can take a look for any
peculiarities, but the file is processed from the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR
variable that is sent as part of the error message.

That's why I thought it peculiar.  
I have the same thing  (note I've renamed a directory from 3.10 to 3.11): 

rcook at edge83 (blockbuster): grep BOOST_LIB_VERSION /nfs/tmp2/rcook/ParaView/3.11/build/boost_1_46_1/boost/version.hpp 
//  BOOST_LIB_VERSION must be defined to be the same as BOOST_VERSION
#define BOOST_LIB_VERSION "1_46_1"

rcook at edge83 (blockbuster): grep 'define BOOST_VERSION' /nfs/tmp2/rcook/ParaView/3.11/build/boost_1_46_1/boost/version.hpp 
#define BOOST_VERSION_HPP
#define BOOST_VERSION 104601


And yet I get: 

 Your system is using an outdated version of Boost (1.33.1, found in
 /nfs/tmp2/rcook/ParaView/3.11/build/boost_1_46_1).  Some of the graph
 processing filters require version 1.36.0 or later to build on 64-bit
 platforms.

 The system will still compile but those filters will be disabled.  Please see
 ParaView3/VTK/Infovis/CMakeLists.txt for more information.

If you look in your CMakeCache.txt do you see a Boost_VERSION variable
set in there? That can override what is in the actual header.

Try this:
Add an attribute clean_command="RemoveAllInputs" to the Input property. (look at the XML for Append filter in filters.xml ).

I already did that.

The point is that my algorithm can work in an incremental way, so I had to add some supporting data structures to manage new connections when previous were removed by the RemoveAllInputs command.

Thanks anyway.

Subject: [Paraview] Interesting bug when using windbladereader and
	multiple time steps

Hi,

There is actually another bug (which may or may not be related) which did not happen before with ParaView 3.8.0 but appears with the release branch of the ParaView that I am using.? If I load a wind data set after connecting to 2-process localhost (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), the gradient of unstructured grid appears greyed out in the filters menu so I can't use that (which is necessary for me).

If I run "mpirun -np 1 pvserver," this is not an issue. It's only an issue with 2 processes or above.? This doesn't happen if I load in a *foam file (i.e. openFOAM file); only with .wind and the most up-to-date release version of ParaView as opposed to 3.8.0.

3 or 4 time steps should be fine.

Thanks,

Thank you for looking into this. I only modified the windbladereader to handle a slight format change, so my knowledge here is a bit limited (in regards to its original design) but I'll help out when necessary.? From what I see there are two outputs (one field, one blade).? I guess the nice thing about having a separate output for the blade is that I can render it separately from the field. 


I can send you a data set with more timesteps (similar to what you are using now, actually), problem is my DSL connection has a poor upload.? Would three or four timesteps do?

Ok, I'm able to replicate the bug.? The test file I have (http://vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTKLargeData.git;a=tree;f=Data/WindBladeReader;h=3459e8ded59eb05796e922d90200bd4e83231df0;hb=HEAD) only has 2 time steps so I may need another set of files from you with more time steps.




Playing around with the reader in ParaView, I think it may be worse than you realize.? Only the time information for the field is getting updated properly and if you go back in time steps, the blade time step either still increases or stays the same if it has hit the last time step.? I need to talk to our temporal pipeline expert to figure out the proper behavior.? One question though -- is there a reason that the reader doesn't return a multiblock with the 3 grids in it instead of having 3 separate output ports?? I'm thinking that if the output was changed to a multiblock then these time issues would go away.?

I'll take a look at it.? I may need a time dependent data set if I can't figure it out though.

Hi,




I've noticed a bug when using the windbladereader; the portion of the code that reads the blade file is one timestep behind the code that reads the field.? For instance, if one is at timestep i, the field data will correspond with timestep "i" but the blade data will correspond with the last timestep chosen.? When a data set is opened initially both the blade and field items are set to the initial timestep.? After one starts changing the timestep, the bug makes an appearance. 






In the code, the blade and field specify their timesteps (individually) based on the bladeInfo and fieldInfo objects, respectively.? These info objects are related to the outputVector of requestInformation -- I wonder if this is some kind of pipeline issue?






Thanks,
Sohail

Is this a fresh build tree? Is it possible that it is picking up a
system Boost first time around? You could delete this entry and re-run
CMake, but it looks like a caching issue to me (I am guessing you have
1.33.1 somewhere, and it gets picked up on the first CMake
invocation).

Hope that helps.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview custom application and plugin loading problem
Message-ID: <1310454596.40834.YahooMailRC@web132203.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I use Paraview 3.10 (32 bits) on Windows and Linux and i have developped a 
custom paraview application and also some customs plugins.
Using Paraview, I can use my customs plugins but in my custom application I 
can't load them.  I have put them in a Plugins directory which is near the 
executable.
When using paraview 3.9 I could load my plugins but not with paraview 3.10.
I have found that I can use the PV_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable (in a bat 
and a sh  file) (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Loading_Plugins). 

Some plugins are loaded but not all of them !
So what is the solutions in order to that all my plugins are loaded by my custom 
application.

Thank you.

Or maybe "right click -> set center" would be better ?

Are they listed when you go to the plugin manager? (from menu "Tools->Manage

 I have it working for me by setting PV_PLUGIN_PATH (on both windows and
linux)

I don't have the plugin manager in my custom application. But in paraview 
plugins are well listed and are correctly loaded.
Using PV_PLUGIN_PATH  one plugin is not loaded. Furthermore before I only had a 
plugins directory and they were automaticly loaded.

I have tried using OPTIONAL_PLUGINS in my custom application CMakeLists.txt 
file. All my plugins are loaded but I have to set them at the same level of the 
executable. But I would like to have them in the plugins directory.

Thank you.

You could try using a debugging, set a breakpoint in
"vtkPVPluginLoader::LoadPluginsFromPath" and step though.

Other things to check would be to make sure you add "REQUIRED_PLUGINS" in
the CMakeLists.txt for any dependent plugins required.  Also, add any
required libraries to "TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES" and make sure they are all in
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running your app.

Paul

Hi,

If you do not use the default pqParaViewBehaviors, then verify that you 
are not missing one of the behaviors used by ParaView (they are listed in 
the sources in the pqParaViewBehavior constructor). Look for all 
pq*Plugin* behaviors in particular.

[Paraview] Re : Paraview custom application and plugin loading  problem






I don't have the plugin manager in my custom application. But in paraview 
plugins are well listed and are correctly loaded.
Using PV_PLUGIN_PATH  one plugin is not loaded. Furthermore before I only 
had a plugins directory and they were automaticly loaded.

I have tried using OPTIONAL_PLUGINS in my custom application 
CMakeLists.txt file. All my plugins are loaded but I have to set them at 
the same level of the executable. But I would like to have them in the 
plugins directory.

Thank you.

Are they listed when you go to the plugin manager? (from menu 
"Tools->Manage Plugins")  If so, can you expand the tree view to see why 
they didn't load?  I have it working for me by setting PV_PLUGIN_PATH (on 
both windows and linux)

So what is the solutions in order to that all my plugins are loaded by my

Hi Luca,

I guess you are talking about the PWApp which is a sample application
of ParaViewWeb therefore is not really what ParaViewWeb can or can not
do. But the limitation that you see in the upload form was just made
to illustrate that is possible to filter. In fact in the configuration
file you can set as many file extension as you want as well as the
size limit or time to live.

So yes, you can upload state files, but you won't be able to load them
inside PWApp like that. You will need to customize the servlet that
take care of the upload and instead of writing the file in the
pw.gwt-app.data directory use the pw.gwt-app.states directory for
.pvsm files. Unfortunately not all the state files will be supported
by the PWApp as PWApp expect a very specific pipeline naming.

Although, I don't know if you are aware or not of the PWStates
application that allow you to create Ad-hoc web application based on a
ParaView state file.

Hope this help,

Seb

I can'f find LoadPluginsFromPath in my 3.10.1 version (the last release). 
Is it in the dev branch ?

You could try using a debugging, set a breakpoint in 
"vtkPVPluginLoader::LoadPluginsFromPath" and step though.

Other things to check would be to make sure you add "REQUIRED_PLUGINS" in the 
CMakeLists.txt for any dependent plugins required.  Also, add any required 
libraries to "TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES" and make sure they are all in the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running your app.

Paul

After talking to Berk and Utkarsh, I think the proper solution is to use the
time request for the requesting port for both the blade and the field
ports.  This will keep everything in sync.

*Hi Utkarsh,

I just wanted to modify the BlockIndices property of the extract filter on
the fly.
  Since in the source code it is linked to a vtkstd::Set attribute in the
extractblock class,
I was trying to create a set vtkSet and put it in a vtkSMProperty so that I
just had to
call getProperty method and set the property pointer to the @ of my created
vtkSMProperty.
but with help from John Biddiscomb I got the way to do it.
It's something like:

QList<QVariant> blocks;*

*      vtkPVCompositeDataInformation *pvcdi = out->GetDataInformation()->
GetCompositeDataInformation();*

*      QList<QVariant> blocks;*

*      int N = pvcdi->GetNumberOfChildren();*

*      for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {*

*        if (...) blocks.append(i+1);*

*      }*

*      pqSMAdaptor::setMultipleElementProperty(*

*        this-> Pipeline->GetProperty("BlockIndices"), blocks);  *

*      this->Pipeline->UpdateProperty("BlockIndices");*

Great thanks for the interest you gave to my request!

Regards

Papa

Also try setting the environment variable PV_DEBUG_PLUGIN
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Developer_Info#PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG).
ParaView wil start dumping information to the command line about
plugins it tries to load and their load status, error messgages etc,.

Subject: [Paraview] Plot Maximum Value over Time
Message-ID: <20110712081639.AJB04513@riddler.int.colorado.edu>

Hi, I was wondering if you could give me some advice:

I extracted some points from a clip plane with the extract data selection feature 
and we want to plot the maximum value (speed in this case) of these points over 
time.  

The extract data selection filter shows the upper and lower bounds, but we just 
need a way to plot the upper bound (i.e. maximum) over time.  I've looked online 
at spreadsheet view, but can't seem to get a definite answer.  Do you know how 
to do this?

Thank you

Hi Seb,
ok... I tried with PWStates... My pvsm file was created with python... 
and it recalls some paraview commands. As indicated in user's guide, I 
created a new application, but when I load it nothing appears... can you 
suggest a more detailed PWStates user's guide? thank you.

When you load your state inside the regular ParaView (Qt client), do
you see something ?

If your state use a file, and if that file do not have the same path
between the computer where the state has been generated and the
server, you will need to update the path and make sure that the file
is available on the server.

This "state update" is dynamically possible with the PWStates
application. If you edit your application, you are able to change the
path of the state file, although you still need to have that data file
on the server.

Subject: [Paraview] Plot Maximum Value over Time
In-Reply-To: <20110712081639.AJB04513@riddler.int.colorado.edu>
Message-ID: <CA41CA67.77AA%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The following is inelegant, but should work.  First, run the "Descriptive
Statistics" filter on whatever data you want to plot the maximum.  From
your description, it sounds like it would be the output of an extract
selection filter.  In the object inspector, select only the variable you
are interested in (in your case speed).

The descriptive statistics filter has two outputs, the "Statistical Model"
and the "Assessed Data." You are interested in the Statistical Model.
When you apply the descriptive statistics filter, ParaView will add two
spreadsheet views, one if which is showing the statistical model.  It
should show a table with one row that describes the name of your variable
and the statistics computed from it (maximum being one of them).  Click
that row to select it.

With that row selected, create a "Plot Selection Over Time" filter.  In
the resulting plot, turn off all series except "Maximum".

Note that in the future we hope to integrate these descriptive statistics
with the "Find Data" dialog so that you can just directly select the
maximum value and plot that selection.

Paul,

Yes, your reader still has to check what process it is and then do t he reading only on that process.

Subject: [Paraview] Representations in 3.10.1
Message-ID: <4E1C905E.4090507@us.army.mil>

I was trying to do the Representations Example for 3.10.1 however it 
failed to run. I grabbed the latest from the git repo and tried that 
example and it seems to work. However, when I attempt to use it, I 
receive an error:

'vtkGeometryRepresentation.cxx, line 455 vtkMySpecialRepresentation 
(0x5851500): Invalid type: 1'

What I was doing was creating a cube source and switching to the Special 
Mapper in the drop down. From my understanding it was just going to use 
what the Surface Representation used.

I was also wondering if you can use multiple mappers per representation. 
For instance I have a MultiBlockDataSet containing 3 blocks (Polydata 
for Points, Polydata for Tubes, Polydata for a Plane). So I was 
wondering if it is possible to have a single Representation use 
different mappers for each block. I would like to map a specific color 
set to the tubes and also an image to the plane.

Is this possible?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

Hi,
I asked a while ago for the possibility to expose BlendMode (MIP is one of
the BlendMode) in rendering proxies and I was granted :
   http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-October/014157.html

http://paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=commit;h=3a07a88345910d5605e042287391e6623af9deb5

By grep-ing current sources, I found that BlendMode is exposed for
GPUVolumeRayCastMapper and FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper. However, I don't
know how easily you can toggle the BlendMode from python shell...

Deleting that variable from the CMakeCache.txt file solved the warning.  Thanks!

Cool. I wasn't aware of this :).

To change the blend mode from Python shell, all you do is following
(with the source being volume rendering active in the pipeline
browser):

SetDisplayProperties(BlendMode="MaximumIntensity")

Macro-ized !

Richard, just add the attached py files as new macros and you will be able
to switch between MIP, MinIP and Composite (the defaut one) volume
rendering.
These macros are more than minimalist (2 lines) : they can be easily
extended to check the current representation and toggle to volume
automatically.
I hope it will be helpful for you

Sweet. That's neat. We need to start thinking of a mechanism to
share/distribute macros now :).

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView macros (was: Further questions regarding 4D
	dataset)
Message-ID: <CABd2RpT+Jt16SNJ9ar5zOYnDhnUCDie2pwsEx4MOmwZYjRU9gQ@mail.gmail.com>

I put these macros in my Peavip lib : http://github.com/jeromevelut/Peavip
It was initially devoted to expose VTK native filters in ParaView, but I
think that it makes sense to put also ParaView python macros.

It could be a solution to use such a repo to share macros. What do you
think?

Subject: [Paraview] Filter time step range
Message-ID: <8A32BB9C-4312-4E03-867C-F0527CAFD1B4@xgm.de>

Hello,

is it possible to limit the range of time steps paraview is working on? For example a filter that narrows the range from time step 100 to 1000 and all subsequent filters will just see and operate on this time range?

Thanks,

Florian

I've also tried running the example within ParaView's built examples and 
receive the same error. It looks like when SetRepresentation() is trying 
to set the mapper, it doesn't exist by the new name. Thus it goes to the 
error message. Any idea if this is something I'm doing wrong or a bug?

I'm pretty sure I have a proper fix for this now.  It's pretty deep into the
pipeline with multiple output ports and temporal information but pretty
interesting in what it's doing.  The gerrit page is
http://review.source.kitware.com/#change,2066 if you want to look at the
changes.

I'm not sure why this isn't working for you.  I just tried it on my machine
with 2 processes and was able to use the gradient of unstructured grid
filter on the field grid.  Can you try it out with the current development
version of paraview to see if you can reproduce it there?

Subject: [Paraview] Displaying a flat polygon with multiple vertices
Message-ID: <CABDpjTko3FMh5ayNC0kXPCQq7aj8ZoZYCkCydwVGCwMSKHgfUg@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a polygon with many vertices using vtkPolygon, then put it in
a vtkPolyData, and then saved it as a vtp file (attached). When I open it in
Paraview, it looks very "broken" (seems like backfaces are showing, things
are overlapping that shouldn't be, etc). If I run the TriangleFilter on it,
it looks fine. Is there something wrong with how I created the data? Or is
Paraview just not able to handle displaying something like this?

Thanks,

David

Hi David,

I think that the issue is that the polygon you constructed is not 
convex. Figure 19-20 in VTK users guide is misleading because the 
example of VTK_POLYGON shows a non-convex polygon which as you found out 
doesn't work.

I'd like to expand on Burlen's answer, which is correct.  VTK sort of handles concave polygons and sort of doesn't.  In particular, it does not render them correctly because the polygons are send directly to the OpenGL rendering system, which in turn does not handle them.  It would be possible for VTK to handle this correctly, but it would be inefficient in the common case where polygons are convex.

In general, filters should handle concave polygons correctly.  For example, run your polygon through the Triangulate filter.  It will be properly triangulated and will then render correctly.

This issue has shown up on the ParaView and VTK mailing lists before.  For a lengthy discussion, see this email thread:

There is actually another bug (which may or may not be related) which did not happen before with ParaView 3.8.0 but appears with the release branch of the ParaView that I am using.? If I load a wind data set after connecting to 2-process localhost (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), the gradient of unstructured grid appears greyed out in the filters menu so I can't use that (which is necessary for me).


If I run "mpirun -np 1 pvserver," this is not an issue. It's only an issue with 2 processes or above.? This doesn't happen if I load in a *foam file (i.e. openFOAM file); only with .wind and the most up-to-date release version of ParaView as opposed to 3.8.0.

Ok, I'm able to replicate the bug.? The test file I have (http://vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTKLargeData.git;a=tree;f=Data/WindBladeReader;h=3459e8ded59eb05796e922d90200bd4e83231df0;hb=HEAD) only has 2 time steps so I may need another set of files from you with more time steps.





Playing around with the reader in ParaView, I think it may be worse than you realize.? Only the time information for the field is getting updated properly and if you go back in time steps, the blade time step either still increases or stays the same if it has hit the last time step.? I need to talk to our temporal pipeline expert to figure out the proper behavior.? One question though -- is there a reason that the reader doesn't return a multiblock with the 3 grids in it instead of having 3 separate output ports?? I'm thinking that if the output was changed to a multiblock then these time issues would go away.?

Sorry. I committed something last night and am trying to fix it now.

Just go back to 
c278cf6710e19efb123941a90b1f77c198c5e16e

git reset --hard c278cf6710e19efb123941a90b1f77c198c5e16e
and I'll email you when I fix the probe stuff properly

The example hasn't been updated.  The subtype is now text, e.g.

<RepresentationType subproxy="MySpecialRepresentation"
        text="Special Mapper" subtype="Surface" />

Message-ID: <CAE-Q4T7KV+F_9DTZi2OwaVEt_nKCciCEXyET8Cn-WH40YfvGoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Is it not possible to connect paraview servers and clinets of
different versions? That will make it quite useless, since I don't
control what can or can't be installled on many places, where I run my
simulations.

If it is possible, can someone please guide me though the process.

Hi,

That is correct the client and server versions of ParaView currently
must be identical for a connection to be made.

Hi,
Thanks for this.

I'm not sure I'm doing things correctly. I can add the macros, leading
to buttons and menu items appearing, but selecting them doesn't appear
to do anything. I haven't used macros in paraview before, so I'm not
sure how to select what they actually get applied to. I am testing
with an image volume, or two image volumes.

Hi

I know it's a newbie question but I really don't know how to display it on the surface..Could anyone help to answer my question?

Thank you.

Hi,

Thank you for your time to read this. I want to ask how to display values with colors on a 3D surface..

In my case, I have a byu surface. For each point of the surface, I have a t-value on it. I want to display the t-value on the surface using different colors. How can I do this?  I read the manuscript and searched, but it doesn't seem to help me...
Thank you very much.

Richard,
These steps make the MIP available by me :
- open ParaView
- Add MIP.py as macro ( menubar "Macros" -> "Add new macro"). as you noted,
it adds a button in the toolbar
- Open a volume (or add a volume source, eg Wavelet) and click on "Apply"
- Change the representation to Volume ("Object inspector" panel -> "Display"
tab -> "Style" frame -> "Representation" combobox -> "Volume"). You may want
to choose GPU rendering : "Volume Mapper" -> GPU
- Click on the newly added MIP button. Normally, it should change the volume
representation to MIP one.

If you want to go back to the usual volume rendering, do the same with the
Composite.py macro.

Thanks,
I think there are problems with the paraview installation I'm using.
Trying to track it down now.

Subject: [Paraview] Memory problems
Message-ID: <CAKsPKwkiqZK+O1kKdHoxixQRENmyS5iqS483D=kX3+VSigeWKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm just wondering if anyone else is also having memory problems with PV
3.10.1 64bit on linux? It happens that when I use PV for a a couple of days
and I leave it open, for some reason it keeps consuming memory and not
releasing it even after deleting the objects in the pipeline viewer. Another
issue is when I zoom into a surface plot and PV starts just using so much
resources that eventually I have to kill the process. I have witnessed about
%40-50 on 8GB machine for a relatively small dataset (~ 300 MB) and all I
was doing was just surface plot of some quantity.

I don't remember any such problem with PV 3.6 and 3.8 before.

Hi Mohammad,

I have recently seen leaks when processing many time steps using LIC 
rep, where the memory usage grows with each time step processed. This 
leak was either caused or exaggerated by having display lists on. 
Turning display lists off allowed me to process the 500 time steps. 
Unfortunately without display lists it's not interactive (5-10 min per 
render) so I switched to using pvbatch scripts. I reported this issue. 
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12251 I don't know if that is 
the same leak you have experienced as I was using the LIC representation.

I have also had problems with the surface rep and seen similar behavior 
to what you describe with the surface represenation memory usage grows 
drastically (for 300 MB vector field consumption peaked around 8GB) and 
PV takes a looooong time to render. 9 times out of 10 ParaView crashes 
after this due to segfault not OOM condition. For me slice rep works far 
better rendering the same data very quickly. I filed a bug report 
earlier this week about this crash. 
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12357. I tried 3.8.1 and had the 
same issue.

Hi,

You will need to pull from mater and rerun The SetupForDevelopment
script in your ParaView tree. Than you should move into your VTK
directory and run "git fetch pvvtk --prune". After these steps you can
do "git submodule update --init" and everything will be up to date.

I think I fixed this server side as well. Apparently on Friday I missed one
vtk branch to merge from pv-next to pv-master. My apologies, this is a new
process for everyone and we're still working out the kinks.

Dear Sebastien,

hello, long time no see. Thanks to your kind advices, I could get some
war files in the Tomcat directory.

But I try to execute samples, I see the page correctly,  but not the 3D
content of the view.

I check FAQ http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb/FAQ and follow the
chekpoint as written, but I can't see the 3D content of the view now.

I also check log file in the Tomcat directory named "pw-out-?????",
those files say as following,

-------------------------------------------------

JMS Initialized in 0.631006 seconds
sessionID : 98307
logLevel : ERROR
Processing Engine Initialized in 1.77516 seconds

Processing engine is started !

--------------------------------------------------

The Web service seems to work normally. And I can't understand
what is wrong.
So... please let me know how can I fix this problem.

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Is there a reason why vtkPlotEdges is only available for ParaView and not
for VTK? Is it possible to add it to the VTK distribution?

Thanks,

Adriano,

Please feel free to add that to the bug tracker. I don't think there's
any reason why those classes cannot be moved to VTK.

Hi Kasumi,

Could you be more precise on what you done from the FAQ and what did you get ?

1) Did you try to execute manually the PWServer executable based on
the path that is set inside TOMCAT_ROOT/lib/pw-config.properties. Did
it crash ?

2) Did you forget to start activemq ?

3) Is there any X running on your linux computer ?

4) Which user is running tomcat ?

Thanks,

Seb

Adriano,

Dear  Sebastien,
hello, thank you for reply. I will respond to your questions as follows.

> 1) Did you try to execute manually the PWServer executable
> based on the path that is set inside
> TOMCAT_ROOT/lib/pw-config.properties. Did it crash ?

Yes I did. And it didn't crash.

> 2) Did you forget to start activemq ?

No, I started activemq.

> 3) Is there any X running on your linux computer ?

Yes there is X on my computer.

> 4) Which user is running tomcat ?

The user is "root(=super user)"... Is this user wrong?

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Hi Katsumi,

running applications like that as root is bad, but this won't affect
the capability of the software to run.
So just to sum up and make sure I get what you are saying.

As root, in your home directory (/root/) you did un-tar a tomcat
package where you deployed the ParaViewWeb applications. Is that
correct ?
Then can you send me (offlist if you want) the catalina.out file that
is inside TOMCAT_HOME/logs directory.

Thanks,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Structured Grid Extent trouble
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450991C9636@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

I have a parallel source which generates Structured Grids.



When each process generates its piece, I am very careful to ensure that the WholExtent is correct (in this case 0,31, 0,31, 0,31) and individual pices are within this extent. I have replaced the PieceToExtentTranslator in the pipeline with a kind of TableExtentTranslator. I don't believe that is the cause of my trouble, but when downstream filters consume the data and they in turn are updated, I get messages like this. (image embedded). the update extent is not within the whole extent.

The Whole Extent has been set to the piece extent. But I can't find where this is happening. Somewhere in the pipeline, my WholeExtent is being Replaced with the piece extent.



I can avoid these annoying messages by setting

outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UNRESTRICTED_UPDATE_EXTENT(), 1);

which stops the pipeline displaying errors and all behaves properly, but I'd like to stop this happening at all.



Can anyone tell me where the WholeExtent is being reset in the pipeline (or a good place to look). I'm flummoxed.



thanks



JB

>What is your pipeline?

H5Part->ParticlePartitionFilter->                   -> SPHProbeFilter(2 input)
                               ->SamplingGridFilter-^

The probefilter takes 2 inputs, one is the partitioned particles, the other is the sampling grid.
The partitionfilter replaces the extent translator with a PieceToBounds translator which maps piece number to 3D regions (from the spatial decomposition), the sampling grid filter creates a rectilinear grid, but divides its output by piece based on the 3D region which it gets from the ExtentTranslator supplied on the input, the grid is therefore created on the same process that the particles exist on. When the SPHprobeFilter does its probing, the particles(+ghosts particles) on process N are available and so are the probe sampling points - this differs from the standard probe filter because we don't duplicate the probe locations on each process or anything (if we had some arbitrary probe locations from another dataset, then I'd need to add a RepartitionFilter which redistributes the probe geometry based on the PieceToBounds Translator so that the probe locations were on the right process).
Anyway, I think I've located the problem. It was in the SPHProbeFilter which has to compute its extents correctly (from the 2nd input which ho,ds the probe geometry) and I had left in one SetWholeExtent call by accident from testing which had the piece extents and not the correct WholeExtent. I don't know how I missed it before, but things seem to be working now.
One new problem :
When I resample the data using the SPH kernel, I can generate a slice, or a volume: slices are great, but when I contour a volume, I am getting errors from vtkMath, "Unable to factor linear system" - now it's possible that there are slight discontinuities across process boundaries (if the ghost region is smaller than the kernel support radius) - do you know what reason might cause the error? (I wouldn't expect the contour filter to fail, just produce extra artefacts).

Thanks if you got this far!

Dear  Sebastien,

hello, I will explain the environment. I installed Tomcat in /usr/local and
built ParaViewWeb in /root. ( Both operations are done as "root" ).
And I copied war files in Tomcat directory following the manual.

> Then can you send me (offlist if you want) the catalina.out
> file that is inside TOMCAT_HOME/logs directory.

Thank you very much for your kind support. I will attach log files.

Best regards,

Katsumi SEKIDO

Hello all,

can a stream tracer filter be applied on an unstructured data?
I tried to apply it on a vtkImageData and it worked perfectly,
but I can't see any output when I try to apply the filter on .cosmo file
(which is vtkUnstructuredGrid).

Thank you,
Ula

if the .cosmo is just particle data, then no. You need finite volume cells to trace the velocity field through. If it's a normal mesh, then it should work

Hi Katsumi,

Just for my knowledge, what kind of Linux distribution are you using ?
I'm getting confused about the /usr/local location.
Did you untar the package yourself or did you used the system package manager ?

Then several comments, based on what I can understand from what you said.

1) Based on the log file, it seems that you try to start tomcat while
it was already running. You should make sure that it is stop before
starting it. Here is a good tip.

## Make sure tomcat is not running anymore
> ps aux | grep tomcat | grep java
## if any process found, just kill them "gently" by executing
> kill the-correct-process-id

2) In one of my previous question you half replied to it.

>> 3) Is there any X running on your linux computer ?
> Yes there is X on my computer.

The "running" word is very important, in fact, tomcat has to be
started by a user that has a X context defined. Otherwise you will
need to follow those instructions:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_with_system_tomcat_package

3) So what user is running tomcat ? tomcat6, root ? From where ? A
terminal from X or ssh ?

4) As you are doing all of this as root, please make sure you know
what you are doing. Otherwise, you can simply create a "paraviewweb"
user and do everything inside its home directory. The only thing is
that you will have to make sure that no other tomcat is running on the
computer otherwise you will still have this exception
"java.net.BindException: Address already in use <null>:8080"

Hope this give you enough points to look into.

Seb

I upgraded what I was doing to 3.11.1 from the git repo and made a patch to
turn off Xdmf. It works for what I need. To turn off Xdmf from building just
set PARAVIEW_BUILD_Xdmf (which will be in advanced, defaults to ON) to OFF.
I uploaded the patch to the bug report.

Subject: [Paraview] console output changed with AutoMPI
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450991F58A7@MBX20.d.ethz.ch>

I added console output to my paraview on windows using

#ifdef WIN32
 AllocConsole();
 freopen("conin$", "r", stdin);
 freopen("conout$", "w", stdout);
 freopen("conout$", "w", stderr);
#endif

so that I could put 
	std::cout <<"Here " << processed << std::endl;
type messages in the code and see them without having to use the annoying log window. (this has worked ok for years).

Since using the new AutoMPI feature, I notice that std::cout is no longer visible after the connection is made.
Note that if I manually start pvservers - I still see output as before.

What's different about using the server dialog to create a connection, and the AutoMPI connection. How can I make the internal autoMPI connection also pipe output to the console?

Does anyone know?

thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Reader Plugin,
	PARAVIEW_EXTRA_INSTALL_RULES_FILE and cpack
Message-ID: <4E297CBA.20203@ec-nantes.fr>

hello everybody

I built ParaView from git-release brach. (on a mac 10.6.8, QT carbon, 64bit)
And I built also a reader plugin in a separate build tree (with 
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN....).

Now I am trying (fighting) to do the right packe for distribution. I 
like to put my plugin inside the .dmg.

Soo I used the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_INSTALL_RULES_FILE variable in the 
paraview configuration:
(PARAVIEW_EXTRA_INSTALL_RULES_FILE = /my/plugin/installrules.txt)

the installrules.txt file contains:
INSTALL(FILES /plugin/build/dir/libmyreader.dylib DESTINATION 
${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} COMPONENT RuntimeLibraries)
INSTALL(FILES /plugin/source/dir/myreader.h DESTINATION 
${PV_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR} COMPONENT Development)

(eof)

but after the :

cpack -G DragNDrop --config 
/paraview/build/dir/Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewViewConfig.cmake

the plugin files are not in the dmg file!!!!!

I can live with  the plugin not inside the dmg image, but how can I 
clean the RPATH  of my plugin so I can distribute it ????

Thank

Subject: [Paraview] Visualizing large data set of 2-d+time point data
Message-ID: <CA4DD35F.1FD8%jtmurphy@anl.gov>

Hello,

I am working with some simulation models that generate large data sets that I would like to visualize using ParaView. The simulation consists of very large numbers of elements called 'agents', each having a number of invariant attributes and a location in 2-D space that varies through time (discrete time steps). Conceptually the data are then:

Agents' Descriptions:
AgentID    Type   ExtendedType NetworkMembership  Etc? (other attributes TBD)
Agent 1         1           5                         17                                 x..
Agent2          2           7                         14                                 x..
?



Agents' Locations:
AgentID   Time      X         Y
Agent1        1       100      100
Agent2        1       100      90
Agent1        2       100.3   100.5
Agent2        2       99.8       90.2
?


As the simulation progresses the agents move in relation to one another; this movement is what I need to visualize. I also need to be able to restrict the view and/or color the agents by type, extended type, and network membership, as well as other attributes I continue to develop.

I am very open to suggestions about how to visualize this, but I have two specific approaches in mind. In the first ('A'), all the data are displayed at once; time is used as the 3rd dimension, so the motion of agents in 2-D space plays out along the z axis. In the second ('B'), a 2-D view is all that is needed, but the agents' motion through time is animated.

I have been able to achieve both of these already, but only with some difficulty; I am wondering if there is a better way to do each one. I have a number of questions that I hope you can help me with.

For reference, the approach I am using now is:

- Data are written from the simulation in a CSV file with columns = AgentId, Time, X, Y, Z, Type, ExtendedType, (other?);

- If 'A' is to be used, all data are written to a single file; if 'B', data are written to files with numeric designations

- ParaView can open the file(s) and import the data; if 'B', the multiple files are considered time series

- I apply the 'Table To Points' filter; if 'A' I use X = X, Y = Y, and Z = Time; if 'B', I use X = X, Y = Y, and Z = Z; 'Z' in my data set is a dummy column that has zero as its only value.

- The results of the Table To Points filter can be displayed. I can select agents' color by 'Type' or 'Extended Type'. For option 'A' I scale the Z-axis to by some multiplier, so that z-values are proportionally large compared to x and y values (Z is generally 1 - 1,000, while x and y are on the order of 0 ? 10,000; the image is clearer when 'Z' is stretched and the points begin to appear as a long tube).

My questions are:

I) To do the first approach requires all of the data to be loaded as a single file; the second relies on the data being broken into multiple files named xx.1, xx.2, etc., with each file representing a timestep. I would like to know if there is a way to load the data in one format but arrive at either or both visualizations. (This saves me from having to output two sets of files for a given simulation.)

II) Currently I also save, and load, the data as a 'flat file' in CSV format. One implication of this is that all of the agent attributes are reproduced in each line of the data output, so:

AgentID   Time      X         Y            Type   ExtendedType
Agent1        1       100      100             1              5
Agent2        1       100      90               2              7
Agent1        2       100.3   100.5        1              5
Agent2        2       99.8       90.2         2              7

This means that the 'attribute' information, which does not vary through time, nevertheless is duplicated for every instance of an agent's row in the data. I'm more familiar with databases, so an approach where I can put the attributes in one table and 'join' them as need would be nice; is one available in ParaView?

III) My current strategy is to load the data from a CSV file and then use the 'Table To Points' filter to convert to data that ParaView can represent. For approach 'B' this expects a Z value, so I have a dummy column in my data set for "Z", the value of which is always zero. (For approach A, of course, the Z axis is 'Time'). After this the only depiction I can render is 3-D, even though I only need 2-D. This seems inelegant and I'd like to avoid it; is this possible?

IV) In approach 'A', each row of the data has an agent ID; this makes it theoretically possible to follow one agent's path through time. However, the approach that I am using now treats each row of the data set as a separate point of data, independent of all the others. I would like to create something that shows the tracks of individual agent's through time- perhaps drawing a line from the agent's location at t 1 to t 2, etc. Is this possible?

V) Finally, I will not be able to use a CSV format as the file sizes grow larger. I would like to use a format amenable to high-performance computing and parallel file writing; HDF5 and NetCDF are two options that seem readily available and workable. However, my understanding is that each of these defines a file format that can be specialized to accommodate different data structures. I also believe that ParaView can read HDF5 and NetCDF files, but I'm not clear if it is only able to read certain common data structures written in them- such as 'HDF5 Image files'- rather than being able to read any HDF5 file and accommodate whatever data structure it contains. Is there some standard file format that I should use? Or will I need to develop a special-purpose structure to store my data in, say, an HDF5 file, and possibly develop a custom paraview reader to accommodate it? Or is XDMF what is needed?

I am new to ParaView and to large-scale visualization; if there are existing ways to do what I need, please help me by directing me to them. It may be that I don't know the correct vocabulary for finding the right data structures and procedures that I need- I believe the data I'm working with are termed 'particle data'? Any clarification or help is very much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
John

 Hi.
I am new to the list, so please forgive me if this subject has already
been dealt with.
I have been using Paraview for a few months on my Windows 7 (64 bit)
desktop machine with no problems (except for the usual user errors!).
After a Windows security update this past Tuesday (7/19), PV asked
for, (and I granted) a firewall exception. However, now I get the
following errors after loading a local vtk legacy dataset, one that had no
problems before Tuesday:
ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\source\Servers\Common\vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 66
vtkServerConnection (000000000AB56900): Server Connection Closed!

More details:

Since this problem started, when I start PV, it pops up a window
titled: c:\Program Files (x86)\Paraview 3.10.1\bin\mpiexec.exe
but this window is blank, and I usually close it. Next I attempt to
load a old state file that I've been working with that sets up views
for my data set, using 'recent files'. I am then prompted with a
window titled 'fix paths in state file' that has a LegacyVTK reader
dialog box that points correctly to my data location. I click OK, and
then a Windows error message "Paraview has stopped working". Crash.

If I leave the mpiexec window open, load the same state file the same
way, get the same 'fix paths' message, and say OK, PV opens the state
file, loads the data and seems to run OK until I close the mpiexec.exe
window. Then I get
ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\source\Servers\Common\vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 66
vtkServerConnection (000000000AC69DC0): Server Connection Closed!

I don't see any other error messages from the server, but I don't know
where to look.
PV continues to run, but the previous data view is now blank, and
reapplying filters shows me nothing.

Should I just live with a blank mpiexec window hanging around?

Subject: [Paraview] plugin (pv-meshless) compilation issue
Message-ID: <CA+FWw2yVtieTJy-FOeYiOx7phhr+X53k9jEEdbBjOULPZDC+Rg@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to compile a plugin (pv-meshless in this case) but am
running into what I think is a Paraview related issue.

I have just pulled the most recent git master and rebuilt Paraview,
but now as I go to rebuild the associated plugins I get this output:

[Lots more output]

I took a look and indeed I do not have
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.h, while I have a number of related
files (eg. vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx.o) within my Paraview
source directory.

Is there something I can do when building Paraview to ensure that this
file is present, or gets generated?

Many thanks.

I, IV) I recommend just using the time-based format (format B for now) and
use the particle pathlines filter to create a trace of each particle over
time.  You can tell the particle pathlines filter to create a path over
the whole time or constrain it to some region of time.  The latter is very
helpful for animating particles over time and getting a better feel for
the movement.

II) Most file formats do not allow you to pick and choose which fields
vary over time and which are constant.  That's not to say it's impossible
(or even difficult), but it's just not a use case most formats have
considered.

III) I agree that it is inelegant.  I added a request for a fix to
ParaView uservoice:
http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/2067739-tabl
e-to-x-filters-should-support-2d-data.  Go vote for it!

V) There are several formats you can choose from.  You could use the
binary forms of the VTK legacy or XML-based formats.  If you want to scale
up to bigger sizes, you could use the Exodus II format
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii), which is well supported in
ParaView.  You could also use the XDMF file format, which is based on
HDF5, but I know less about it.

I've updated the master branch of pv-meshless to point to the 3.11 branch which you will need if you are using kitware head/master. Master was still on the release-3.10 branch - which builds against paraview release 3.10

Please try again.

Subject: [Paraview] plugin (pv-meshless) compilation issue

I am trying to compile a plugin (pv-meshless in this case) but am
running into what I think is a Paraview related issue.

I have just pulled the most recent git master and rebuilt Paraview,
but now as I go to rebuild the associated plugins I get this output:

[Lots more output]

I took a look and indeed I do not have
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.h, while I have a number of related
files (eg. vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx.o) within my Paraview
source directory.

Is there something I can do when building Paraview to ensure that this
file is present, or gets generated?

Many thanks.

Message-ID: <CA52D73B.2198%jtmurphy@anl.gov>

Ken,

Thanks very much for this.

Over the weekend, armed with your advice and after some more digging on my
own, I have pursued a solution involving xdmf. It is working pretty well
in small tests. The main advantage is that I believe I will be able-
pending a bit more progress- to output the simulation data into a single
HDF5 file with limited redundancy (invariant attribute data only once, for
example), and to have multiple different xdmf schemas for different views
of the data (such as my 'A' and 'B' views).

I am slightly concerned about scaling- so far I have only used this on
test data of 80 points for ten time steps, but my actual data may reach
10^7 agents with 10K timesteps- but otherwise it seems like it will be a
very effective solution to my problem.

I will follow the link and vote for the suggestion re: 2-D table-to-points.


Again, thanks for your help,
John

Subject: [Paraview] Applying Texture with Plugin
Message-ID: <4E2D86E5.3000802@us.army.mil>

I am trying to make a simple plugin to automatically apply a texture to 
a plane source. I am looking at this code for reference: 
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Visualization/TextureMapPlane

So far I have figured out that I need to use a custom representation, 
but I have not figure out where to place the code. By using 
vtkMySpecialRepresentation as a base, I added a RequestData() which does 
the following:

[code]
if(inputVector[0]->GetNumberOfInformationObjects()==1)
    {
        vtkDataObject* inputData = 
vtkDataObject::GetData(inputVector[0], 0);
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkPlaneSource> ps =
            vtkPlaneSource::SafeDownCast(inputData);
        if(ps != NULL)
        {
            ps->SetCenter(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
            ps->SetNormal(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

            vtkSmartPointer<vtkTextureMapToPlane> tp =
                vtkSmartPointer<vtkTextureMapToPlane>::New();
            tp->SetInput(ps->GetOutput());

            this->Mapper->SetInputConnection(tp->GetOutputPort());
        }
    }
    return this->Superclass::RequestData(info, inputVector, outVector);
[/code]

I then added AddToView() with the following:

[code] 
 vtkPVRenderView* rview = vtkPVRenderView::SafeDownCast(view);
  if (rview)
  {
    imgReader->SetFileName("/share/panneton/Desktop/blue.png");
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkTexture> texture =
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkTexture>::New();
    texture->SetInput(imgReader->GetOutput());

    this->Actor->SetMapper(this->Mapper);
    this->Actor->SetTexture(texture);
    rview->GetRenderer()->AddActor(this->Actor);
    rview->GetRenderer()->SetBackground(.1, .2, .3);
  }
  return this->Superclass::AddToView(view);
[/code]

This however does not seem to work. Am I going about this wrong?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

Subject: [Paraview] best strategy for multi-block data?
Message-ID: <CAAAXsxT-Ev7PfHHiS5NEb-UVzvY911CoekxZsVYThikNnwLhRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am currently using the multiblock dataset (vtm file) format to have
multiple unstructured regions (vtu files).  Not all of the fields are
available in all of the regions.  When I try to use a calculator to
calculate a field, I am getting errors for fields which don't exist in
each region.

So when I try to calculate E = Electric_Field_x * iHat +
Electric_Field_y *jHat, it complains about missing Acceptors.

What is the best possible way to avoid these problems?  Is there a
preferred file format?  The whole reason I selected the multiblock
format, was so that I don't have to store all the fields on all
regions.

This is paraview 3.3. for Ubuntu Linux

I think the best way to proceed would be to use the extract blocks filter to
extract all of the blocks that have the desired fields for your calculator.
You may want to group the unstructured grids with the same field data into a
vtkMultiPieceDataSet to make it easier to extract the blocks that you want.

Subject: [Paraview] Possible issue with velocity interpolator class
Message-ID: <1311632332.85101.YahooMailNeo@web36504.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've been developer a vortex core tracer, which is basically a customized version of vtkStreamTracer. ?I use the interpolation code quite heavily in the class, in this test case I use the point interpolator (i.e. vtkInterpolatedVelocityField class).

Now in one part of the code, I've noticed that doing two calls to the interpolator's FunctionValues for a bad boundary point produces strange results. ?After the first call to FunctionValues I obtain a valid cell (using GetCell) and after the second call I get a NULL cell. ?The second call is correct because the point in question's y coordinate is -0.0012773338068285955, which outside of the data set's 0-boundary.

Anyway, I will look into this further to see what's up; I was wondering if anybody has ideas.

Thank you,
Sohail Shafii

Subject: [Paraview] xorg configuration to use pvserver with multi gpus on
	one node
Message-ID: <20110726065707.M34056@cines.fr>

  Hello,

  we try to make parallel visu with pvserver on nodes with multi gpus. To make a 
remote display we use the vglrun package.

  All their use of paraview seems to use only the first gpu (the one on the 
display :0.0). The others gpus (on :0.1 :0.2 and :0.3) don't make anything. We 
can see that only the memory of the first is fill, the others stay empty.

  Is there something special to make in the xorg to use all the gpus with 
pvserver ?

  Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview python option "Show Plane" for slices
Message-ID: <4E2EBDBE.4050702@math.uni-dortmund.de>

Hello,

I am trying to make screenshots with a python script, in principal it 
works, but just one detail is not working how I would like it to be.
I applied a Slice filter with type 'Plane' to my input and I want to 
take a screenshot of the slice. In the GUI (in the Properties tab of the 
slice ) there is a check box "Show Plane"  that controls the visibility 
of the Slice plane. When I want to take my screenshot I would like to 
turn off the visibility of the slice plane, so that only the data slice 
is shown. In the GUI I would do that by simply unchecking the check box 
"Show Plane". I could not find out how to do that in python. Python 
shows me the following properties of the slice:

 >>>for prop in cutplane1:
...        prop.GetXMLLabel()

'Slice Offset Values'
'Slice Type'
'Input'
'Input Bounds'

So I guess the 'Show Plane' option is not a property, so how can I 
disable it in python?

Thank you!
Raphael

Do you had ever experience the same problem? Or do you know another

I am able to set the color of the plane without an issue by using:

[code]
this->Actor->SetMapper(this->Mapper);
this->Property->SetColor(.8, .4, .2);
this->Actor->SetProperty(this->Property);
rview->GetRenderer()->AddActor(this->Actor);
rview->GetRenderer()->SetBackground(.1, .2, .3);
[/code]

So somehow, the texture is not loading properly. Does anyone know what 
is wrong here?

Thanks,
Brian

Thank you that worked.  Is there a document available for the
multi-block format?  I remember when I implemented in this on the
past, I relied exclusively on email correspondence in order to get my
output writer correct.

Thanks

 Dear Paraview users,  

I decided to update my machine to Lion and discovered, the hard way, that Paraview is not working under 10.7. The problem is that the openmpi library is not install by the system, nor by Xcode. Paraview generates an error that it can't find /usr/lib/libmpi_cxx.dylib. I compiled openmpi and installed to /usr/local/ and generated a symbolic link in /usr/lib to the above mentioned library, still Paraview generates an error saying it can't find some symbols.

Has anybody been able to run Paraview under Lion? Any advice would be welcome.

Greetings,

andres

I get the chance. The only alternatives would be to build ParaView yourself

Message-ID: <1311719389.16436.YahooMailNeo@web36506.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Right now the field and blade data are separate for the wind blade reader (as expected). ?I was wondering if, after creating a python filter below the blade object in the pipeline, I could somehow access the field data? ?I'm guessing not based on some experimenting.

I need to do this because I have to correlate points on the blade to the same areas in the field to calculate certain quantities (which requires interpolated field values). ?If the python route is not possible then I can just make changes in vtkWindBladeReader instead.

It may be easiest just to link to the VTK libraries and create
vtkDataObjects and then use the vtkXMLMultiBlockDataWriter.

Subject: [Paraview] pythoncalculator with mpirun fails
Message-ID: <CAN_ffbiT11FrmD_+ncTctfvvvjsQDzSbdyHhMSSVkqGMj=thZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraviewer developers

Thanks for the new 3.10.1 release: finally I can get my python batch files
run in parallel including the text labels!

I have one small problem related with a parallel run of a python batch
script when pythonCalculator is included

I have added the script below this email and added to the attachment as
pycalc.py

If I run the script with

pvbatch pycalc.py
everything is fine

also

pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering pycalc.py
works fine

Even

mpirun -np 1 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering pycalc.py

runs like a charm

However, if I do:

mpirun -np 2 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering pycalc.py

It crashed and I got a whole bunch of error messages

starting with
Process id: 1 >> Warning: In
/tmp/openfoam_build/ParaView-3.10.1/VTK/Parallel/vtkSochetController, line
50
vtkSocketCrontroller (-xd4a51f0): Already initialized
...
Error: Cannot find command function for "vtkProcessModeule""

If I change in the script the PythonCalcuator for the normal calculator by
substituting the lines with Calc for

Calc=Calculator()
Calc.Function='U_Z'

Everything runs fine, even for the mpirun -np 2

In other words: the combination of mpirun on multiple processors with
PythonCalculator does not seem to  work

I have added the scripts and the error message in the tar ball attachment.
Hopefully can shed some light on this, as the PythonCalculator would be very
handy to use in script, also when I am running parallel

Thanks in advance!

Regards

Eelco

Hi Emily,

I reverted some changes to vtkAVIWriter so that this will use the old MSVC
codec which has been problematic for some, but the change hasn't been part
of a binary release yet. If you use ParaView 3.8 you should be able to save
as avi. Alternatively, 3.10.1 is attempting to use a better codec called
CVID. If you install one of the various codec packages on the internet
containing cvid that might also solve your problem, assuming you can install
software on your machine.

My data writer is already written.  It writes binary data to an
unstructured mesh file using zlib compression and base64 encoded data.
 It would not be very easy to rewrite it using the vtk libraries.  My
writers would be a lot easier to maintain with documentation of the
file format.

Juan

David,
I downloaded and installed the basic and 64-bit codecs from the site you referenced below:
http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm

It seems that this basic version should include Cinepak, which has the codec CVID:
http://www.codecguide.com/klcp_ability_comparison.htm

However, even with these installed (and my machine restarted), I still get the same error when trying to save an animation using ParaView 3.10.1. However, I did verify that I was able to save an animation using the same data as visualized in ParaView 3.8.1.

Any other suggestions (besides using ParaView 3.8.1 when I need to save animations)?

Thanks,
Emily

Subject: [Paraview] Using threshold and warp by scalar
Message-ID: <CA562819.143F%nuclearbologna@gmail.com>

I am trying to use warp by scalar and threshold filters on tiff and png
files. However, they are grayed out and not usable. Does anyone know if
there are specific inputs need? I got it to work with a different png file,
but others do not work.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Threshold requires scalars to threshold within, and tiff has RGBA data
in it which ParaView thinks of as a vector (for the most part). You
could use the calculator to compute a magnitude of that or pull out
individual components and then the threshold filter will be available.
Alternatively, in 3.10.2 you can turn on the auto convert properties
preference and ParaView will do something similar for you.

The warp isn't available for the same reason and another. Besides
lacking scalars to warp on, tiff files are read in as regularly
structured image data, in which the point locations are not allowed to
move around (if they were it wouldn't be regularly structured). So you
also got to convert to an unstructured type to make it possible to
move the points, after which the warp filter will be available. The
tetrahedralize filter will do that for you, and the threshold filter
does that for you as a side effect too.

Thanks. That helped the png images (for the most part). I am still having
trouble with the tiff image.

Message-ID: <4E30FDAB.2090105@in.tum.de>

Hello ,
i am currently working as a graduate student on a project for N:M 
redistribution in my university and i plan to use the coprocessing 
library for this. Our system consists of a vis. cluster(some 
workstations + tiled screen display)  and a bluegene machine for the 
simulation. We have a c++ code. Is is possible to work with coprocessing 
library on the bluegene cluster? Do you have some additional materials 
(technical stuff about the N:M realization)?
Regards,
A.Atanas

One thought that comes to mind is the Resample with DataSet filter,
which is a filter which has the effect of merging pipeline branches
together.

Set the Input to be the field and the Source to be the blade and the
result will be a copy of the blade with the data values of the field
sampled onto the points of the blade.

Thank you for the suggestions. ?Since the data sets were on separate ports, here's what I did: I did a re-sample with data set to map the input (field) to the source (blade). ?But the blade cell data items were missing in the result, so I then did a Group data set with the result of the mapping and the blade. ?This means that I do not have to make any changes in the vtkWindBladeReader code.

Hi,

I've built and run coprocessing on a BlueGene P.  There are some scripts
available at https://github.com/patmarion/ParaViewAutoBuild/branches for
building it on the P.  You probably want the ibmbgp-pv-3.10.1 branch from
that.  From there, edit build_options.sh and change this line to indicate
the directory where you want to do all the building:
  base=/ccs/proj/tur013/marionp/gccbuild
Then just run "./auto_build.sh do_cross" *
*

I'm pretty sure that it's been built on the Q as well but I haven't done
that myself.  If you look at the SC10 coprocessing tutorial (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/5/52/SC10_tutorial_full.pptx) there are some
instructions there for cross-compiling starting at slide 72.  That may help.

As for going from N to M processes, Pat Marion knows much more about that
than I do so hopefully once you have it built he can help you out with that.

Likewise, if you run through the process using Python Trace up to the point
before you try to save the animation and post it, maybe that will show
something.

I am using Mac OS X, paraview 3.81 and 3.10.1 (problem in both). I have a
simple png file using calculator, threshold, and warpbyscalar. Then, I did a
simple camera shift animation and went to save animation. I chose the
parameters (1080x720, 6sec., 10fps,60 frames, avi) and the animation
started. It works fine until the animation finishes, then the program
crashes.

Subject: [Paraview] PYTHONPATH paraview modules WindowsXP64bit
Message-ID: <20110729141348.DBP32007@expms4.cites.uiuc.edu>

Paraview folks,
   I am building an application in Python and I'm hoping to use paraview's python 
scripting abilities to generate plots from the data it produces automatically without 
user intervention. The code must be able to just import paraview modules and use 
them to produce the plots. I am currently using WindowsXP 64 bit but we have plans 
to port to other OS's after this works. I have downloaded and installed the ParaView-
3.10.1-Win64-x86.exe from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html 
. However, typing into the regular Python interpereter (or my source) :

import paraview.simple
import paraview

all produce the error
ImportError: No module named paraview

I added a windows system environment variable called PYTHONPATH with value 
PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 3.10.1\bin;C:\Program Files 
(x86)\ParaView 3.10.1\lib\paraview-3.10

But it still does not work, still produces the same errors. All the examples I could find 
online are for linux/mac so I'm stuck. I also tried adding to PATH or PYTHON_PATH 
but the problem persists.
What must I change so my Python codes can import and use paraview modules?

Hi,

I just built off the master branch (commit 4f0d9672) and I noticed XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON was no longer an option. 

It appears it was set to INTERNAL in commit 7ac1f751, which was due to the conversation in the mailing list (http://markmail.org/message/gapnf4reuazdtfcn), although I'm not sure if it was made INTERNAL and ON prior to trying to release and just turned to OFF at last minute because of the problems.  

Is fixing the CPack issue high on the priority list so the binaries will ship with the XDMF python wrapper? If not, can we revert to the XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON option as advanced and not INTERNAL?

Thanks,

Tim

David and Eric,

Thanks for the advice. Your responses have definitely helped me get closer to actually defining the problem more precisely. 

Here's some more background:
Although I am working with two different attributes from the same analysis (pressure and fluidID), the exodusii converter that I'm using (written by someone else) only operates on one attribute at a time and defaults to calling this attribute "resX" in the *.exo file. So I run the converter twice on my data, once to get the pressure.exo file and once to get the fluidID.exo file, but yet both files have a common name, "resX," for the data attribute that I'm interested in.

In ParaView, I am coloring both views by "resX", even though in view 1, "resX" represents pressure and in view 2, "resX" represents fluidID. See attached screenshot.

So without having to get the exodusii converter fixed, is there a way to change the data name in ParaView from resX to something else, say "pressure", so that I can color my two views by a different variable, which should probably fix my problem with the independent colorbar scales?

Thanks!

-Emily

Hey,

David, Emily seems to be describing that she already has two different attributes, so I'm suspecting that somehow she's mistakenly coloring by the same attribute in both views... 

Emily, as David is saying, (at least my understanding of) what you're wanting should be the default behavior. Make sure that when you click on each view the "color by" combo box changes which attribute it's listing, and that each colormap has "Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range" checked in the colormap editor.

Attached is a screen shot that I made "right out of the box" with all default settings, just having the surface colored by different attributes in different windows, and choosing an alternative to the blue-white-red colormap for Elevation.

If you're still having trouble, maybe let us know which version of ParaView you're using, and on which platform, and whether you built it yourself.
