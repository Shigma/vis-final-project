Thank you for your reply.

Do you know of any plans to update Dump.py to the new servermanager python
interface?

Regards,
Sylvester

The Dump.py script was designed using the old python interface to paraview.
3.2 introduced the new servermanager python interface, and nobody has
developed a new Dump.py that works with it.

Ken Moorland fixed the rendering error. The way it works now is that at each 
update the depth of the near and far points in the scene are found and used to 
set the near and far clip planes. These values also control how the scene is 
mapped to the Z buffer so that the buffer's limited resolution (32 bits, I 
think) are optimally utilized.

Previously the nearest and furthest points from all updates since ParaView was 
started were used. That could mean that the scene was mapped to only a few 
planes in the Z buffer resulting in depth aliasing.

I only saw the problem in client-server mode and the fix was in 
vtkSMRenderViewProxy.cxx. My guess is that client rendering is different.

The crashes still occur so that will be reposted as a new issue.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.2.1 Server Crashes When Select COR
Message-ID: <47543AC7.9030703@psc.edu>

When operating in client-server mode, and the server is rendering, the server 
crashes when I try to set the center-of-rotation. This does not occur when 
rendering on the client.

To reproduce the problem I load a vtu file and display its outer surface.
When I try to set the center-of-rotation to a point on the surface the server 
crashes.

Select cells and cells/through works whether the client or the server is 
rendering. Selecting points fails no matter who is rendering with the message

===
In /usr/local/packages/paraview/3.2/src/VTK/Rendering/vtkLabeledDataMapper.cxx, 
line 289

The server includes the patch by Ken Moorland concerning the way the clip 
planes are set.

Subject: [Paraview] Stereo Rendering Support in Windows Paraview
Message-ID: <4754444A.7090103@lncc.br>

Hello Paraview Developers and Users,

We are making some tests with stereo rendering in Paraview on Windows 
SO. Many people wrote the mailing list complaining that stereo mode was 
not working in Windows. Actually the default stereo mode for windows is 
Cristal Eyes which is a active rendering type not visible by naked eye, 
but the stereo support is working fine.

In order to change the stereo visualization mode in Windows the 
following must be made:

edit the file:
paraview-xx/VTK/Rendering/vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow.cxx line 67

this->StereoType = VTK_STEREO_RED_BLUE; // you can change to other 
stereo modes here


Happy stereo visualization :-)

What are your plans for the dump tool?

If you are looking for an introduction to writing python scripts for
paraview, I recommend reading the servermanager pdf. This can be found at: *
paraview*.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/*Servermanager*2.pdf

If you want something like state saving / loading from python, both of those
options are now aviable with the commands LoadState  / SaveState. Reading
the servermanager.py (found in Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping) will show you
some to of abilities plus it has some great examples.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF reads as Multi-group Dataset
Message-ID: <CF0683B3-1D85-48C3-9E6D-780ACE434D65@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I realize that Xdmf support is in transition, but I'm having trouble  
using the current implementation. (My data is in HDF5 format, so Xdmf  
is the most natural for getting it into ParaView.)

1. Any Xdmf file that can be read by ParaView (3.2.1 or 3.3) doesn't  
keep its intended data "Type" -- it's listed in the Information tab as  
"Multi-group Dataset". This can be reproduced by loading in a *.vti or  
*.vtu file, then save it as *.xmf and then re-read it. Is this a known  
issue? Any ideas for a workaround, even if it's just until Xdmf 2.0  
comes online?  (One resultant problem I'm having is that if I want to  
read in Xdmf and then save as a native VTK XML format, only the VTK  
Multi Group Files (*.vtm) format is listed.)

2. Some of my data are particles, which I used to read in as an  
Unstructured Grid by using the Xdmf PolyVertex topology. Since these  
points are not really connected in any way, (up through ParaView  
3.0.2) I used to start my *.xmf files like this, using just PolyVertex  
and NodesPerElement:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" [
<!ENTITY HeavyCellData "test_lucas_hdf_cells.h5">
]>

<Xdmf>
   <Domain Name="test_lucas">
     <Grid Name="Cells">
       <Topology
          Type="PolyVertex"
          NodesPerElement="1001">
       </Topology>
       .....

Maybe this isn't the correct way to do it, but ParaView used to read  
it okay, and now it crashes when trying to read this type of file.  
 From what I can tell (looking at *.vtu files saved as *.xmf from PV  
3.2.1 or 3.3), PV seems to need a "Connections" data structure within  
the Topology definition (which just says each node is connected to the  
next one, 0->1, 1->2, etc.):

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" [
<!ENTITY HeavyCellData "test_lucas_hdf_cells.h5">
]>

<Xdmf>
   <Domain Name="test_lucas">
     <Grid Name="Cells">
       <Topology  Type="POLYVERTEX"
          Dimensions="1">
         <DataStructure
            DataType="Int"
            Dimensions="1 1001"
            Format="HDF">
            &HeavyCellData;:/simulation1/experiment1/environment1/ 
snapshots/s0/Cells/Connections
         </DataStructure>
       </Topology>
       .....

Is there any way to get ParaView to load an Xdmf unstructured grid  
which doesn't have this Connections data defined? (It's just a bit of  
a pain since this data isn't part of our natural simulation output,  
and to get the data to load into PV I have to generate this extra  
Connections array afterwards.)

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Kent,

I wasn't able to reproduce the problem with the center of rotation. Can 
you verify that the Servers/Filter/vtkPVDesktopDeliveryServer.h has the 
following defined:

   // Description:
   // Capture Z buffer from render window on end render. Works only when
   // ParallelRenderManager is 0.
   vtkSetMacro(CaptureZBuffer, int);
   vtkGetMacro(CaptureZBuffer, int);

My mistake - I was using the 3.2 server when I meant to use the 3.2.1 server. 
The client is 3.2.1. Using the right server there is no problem.

This looks like an issue with using qt3 assistant to read the docs

I modified the Example in ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/GUIObjectPanel to use 
pqLoadedFormObjectPanel.  You can have a look at that example.

Robert,

My plan was to use the output of the dump tool as a basis for python script
that would create PNG's from several views, cutplanes, etc.

I've read Servermanager2.pdf and also looked through servermanager.py, but
they don't say anything about creating cutplanes. Information on how to
set/specify the cutfunction would be highly appreciated!

Thank you for your help.

Regards,
Sylvester

What are your plans for the dump tool?

If you are looking for an introduction to writing python scripts for
paraview, I recommend reading the servermanager pdf. This can be found at:
paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf

If you want something like state saving / loading from python, both of those
options are now aviable with the commands LoadState  / SaveState. Reading
the servermanager.py (found in Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping) will show you
some to of abilities plus it has some great examples.

Hi all,

I have written a small library, in pure fortran 90/95 with 
only one non-standard instruction for binary file 
handling, to Input/Output VTK data. I think that this code 
may be useful for fortran programmers: I hope that the 
library give you a simple API to write (and soon as 
possible to read) VTK data file without mixing fortran 
with C++ or python.

I wrote a poor user guide, but I think that is enough to 
use the library. As soon as I have the time I update the 
user guide and the all the files associated to the library 
(makefile, examples, compiled packages ...). At the moment 
I made a very poor webpage with the source code of the 
library and the user guide. There is also a simple example 
of the library usage. The web page is:

http://stefano.zaghi.googlepages.com/lib_vtk_io

from this site you can download the source code and the 
userguide. Unlucke the comments in the code is in italian. 
As soon as possible I will translate them in english.

The library is distribuited under GPL and I will very 
happy if it will be useful for any other me...

Send me all comments, in particular critics and 
suggestions...

See you soon

Stefano

PS thank to Renato E. for his help. This library is a 
collection of his tips. And thank to all paraview/vtk 
programmers for their support on this mailing list.

The problem was really in an old file. I had Emacs.ad resource file in 
.kde/share/apps/kdisplay/app-defaults/ which contained

#define FOREGROUND gray100
#define BACKGROUND black

leading to the following message during paraview start-up:

QColor::setNamedColor: Unknown color name 'gray100'

Apparently this stopped setting the other colors.

thanks again,

Berk can correct me if I am wrong, but that is a limitation of
Paraview. Once an atomic dataset is put into a composite data set, it
can't be pulled out back into the atomic dataset's type. We hope to
have it fixed for the upcoming 3.4 release. The new XDMF reader, which
I hope to have ready in a week or two, will produce atomic datasets
when there is only a single grid in the file.

This sounds like a bug in the new XDMF library. You might want to ping
the xdmf mailing list (xdmf@lists.kitware.com) to see if any one is
aware of the issue, has a workaround or is working on a solution.
Perhaps the ARL group knows more than I.

attach it to a bug report.  I must admit that I haven't filed a bug

Sounds Great. What type of plugins can I put in there? Things that  
add custom GUIS? Custom Readers/Writers? Do you happen to have a  
sample project to go with the code?

I would assume that you can put any plugin in there.  I am using it for 
readers and filters, but I don't see why you couldn't do custom GUI's 
assuming that you use the Qt GUI process outlined in the wiki. 
Essentially, my modification is no different than:
(1) using the Plugin Manager to load plugins
(2) setting PV_PLUGIN_PATH to a directory and placing plugins there.

It requires that you set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when you run cmake and 
then do a make install.  Any .so plugin file you place in 
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/plugins will be loaded as if it were in 
PV_PLUGIN_PATH.  Does that help?

Message-ID: <47577556.70708@cora.nwra.com>

I've been updating the paraview package for Fedora development to 3.2.1 
and have had work around some issues.  The biggest is installing 
pqClient.adp and Documentation into /usr/bin.  I've moved this to 
/usr/share/paraview as required by the FHS and Fedora guidelines, but 
this was a pain to do.  I ended up having to patch Client/MainWindow.cxx 
to point to /usr/share/paraview/pqClient.adp.  I could have set 
PARAVIEW_HELP, but the problem there is when someone installs paraview 
they must then get a new shell or log out and back in to get it set.

I would really appreciate it if the location of these files could be 
changed at build time.

Thanks!

Can anyone give any guidance for coding the cell picking?

i.e. from the clicked() slot of a QPushButton to activate the picking ->

It sounds like the issue you are trying to address with the new XDMF  
reader is at the root of my problem -- XDMF files containing a single  
grid are being read in to ParaView as a Multi-group dataset. Right now  
I can't get any XDMF file to read in as a pure type.

Thanks for letting me know about the XDMF mailing list. I hadn't seen  
any reference to that before.

Reading through the XDMF v. 2.0 Model & Format page again, I noticed  
the sentence: "For unstructured topologies the Topology element must  
contain a DataItem that defines the connectivity." This doesn't make  
sense (to me :) for Polyvertex topologies, which they define as "a  
group of unconnected points". I'll see if anyone can give me more  
insight on that, or suggest a workaround.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Eric,

Eventhough I'm a Terp fan .....

The DataItem under Topology allows for XDMF to use part
of the total Geometry. For example if your Geometry specified
100 points your PolyVertex Topology might only use 10 of them.

What "should" happen is that if there is no "DataItem" under
Topology, XDMF generates a "default" one. So if you have 5 points
it would generate "0 1 2 3 4". This seems to be busted at
the moment. I'm looking into it now. I'll get back to you
once I figure out what is happening.

Does ParaView 3.2.1 use the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE any more?  
In previous versions (PV 2.6.x) I would set this to my reader/writer/ 
filter projects and directly build my code into the ParaView  
Compilation. Is this still possible? From reading the wiki it seems  
that you have to build ParaView first, then create the plugins?

otherwise the plugin directory will be either dangling alongside the  
ParaView.app or buried in the .app package structure.

It is still supported.

Thanks. Turns out I had a mismatch in my pvsm and gui xml files.  
Things are working much better now.

I am developing on Linux, AIX (just barely), and eventually on Windows. 
  I assume on OS X, that the PV directory structure is similar, so I 
guess the plugin directory would go along with ParaView.app, sort of 
(actually the .app would be in bin/ and plugins/ would be in the same 
directory alongside bin/).

Anyway, the idea is for the administrator (whomever installed PV in this 
case) to be able to simply place common plugins in that directory. 
Individual users can still load their own plugins via Plugin Manager or 
by setting the PV_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.

It should be possible to select some default directory for users based 
on each platform, the one you recommended for OS X, perhaps 
~/.config/ParaView for most other Unices, and similarly in the user's 
Application Data directory in Windows.  It's not a bad idea, but I'm on 
the fence about it because I don't think we should try to search every 
possible combination of directories when PV_PLUGIN_PATH is available for 
use.  The question is where to draw the line.

Clint is likely going to replace my code with something a little more 
generic (based on the location of the executable as provided by argv[0] 
instead of the install path).  He might also have a good idea about 
something for user directories.

A nice discussion of colormaps at

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Default_Color_Map

is no longer publicly viewable. Instead the wiki asks that I create an account.

But clicking on "create account" just takes me back to the login screen. 
Nothing I do creates a new account.

Is this the way it is supposed to work?

Clint,

Thanks but those Wiki pages don't answer 2 important questions. I assume 
references to "GUI xml" and "client xml" are equivalent.

1) Where does all the information shown in the "Extend" example go, that gives 
the name of the C++ class and describes the GUI? The example from "Plugin" 
(which you provided in your message, below) doesn't show any of that.

2) What if the custom module is a filter not a reader?

TIA

Nowhere.  That is a Paraview 2.6 thing.

ParaView3 generates the GUI automatically.  If the generated GUI isn't what 
you want, you have to write a plugin.  The GUI/client xml I gave below is to 
tell the file dialogs what file extensions go with what readers.

Then you don't have any GUI side xml or code at all.

Would it be possible to update those wiki pages so that each section  
states if it is relevant to ParaView 2 or 3 or Both? I would do it  
but I just have no idea.

The generated GUI cannot possibly know the labels, defaults and other 
particulars that are best for the GUI so I guess I'll have to write a plugin.

How do I do that and build the code into paraview during compilation? Loading 
things at every execution seems less reliable and could be difficult on 
parallel systems with no shared disk.

Would I still use PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE?

Actually, all of this is encoded into the server manager xml so there
is no need to write a plugin. Very few of the built-in filters have
custom gui, most use automatically generated panels. If you look at
the server manager xml, you will see default values, ranges (through
domains) and things to help the gui such as labels, hints etc...

Great discussion! But I'm still missing something when I try to add my custom 
filter "cloud". Using the automatic GUI generation and 
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE the make process marches along until this:

======
[ 75%] Building CXX object 
Servers/ServerManager/CMakeFiles/vtkPVServerManager.dir/vtkSMApplication.o
.../Servers/ServerManager/vtkParaViewIncludeModulesToSMApplication.h: In member 
function ?void vtkSMApplication::Initialize()?:
.../Servers/ServerManager/vtkParaViewIncludeModulesToSMApplication.h:39: error: 
?vtkSMDefaultModulescloudSMGetInterfaces? was not declared in this scope
======

In CMakeCache.txt it seems the flags to add my filter "cloud" are appropriate:

======
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES:STRING=cloud
PARAVIEW_USE_cloud:BOOL=ON
cloud_SOURCE_DIR:PATH=/home/eschenbe/PV/Kits/Cloud
======

And in the cloud directory the file cloudParaViewImport.cmake seems correct:

======
SET (cloud_SRCS
   ${cloud_SOURCE_DIR}/vtkCloud.cxx
   )

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${cloud_SOURCE_DIR})
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${cloud_SOURCE_DIR}/..)

PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES("${cloud_SRCS}")

PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES("${cloud_SOURCE_DIR}/cloudSM.xml"
======

The file cloudSM.xml is the same as was used with 2.6.1. Any ideas what went wrong?

Go to build directory, find all (cxx) files with 'generated' in the file 
name. delete them. rerun cmake, configure and generate. then try Again. 
Fixed?

Like Berk said, you probably don't need to, and most ParaView builtin 
filters/sources are auto-generated at run time.  So you probably don't need 
to make a GUI plugin.

Client/GUI side plugins aren't deployed on parallel systems, just on the 
client machines.  You could even use PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE to build 
your server side code into ParaView, and have it work with GUI plugins on the 
client side.

If you want, you can.  Here's the new wiki page I said I'd make.

Subject: [Paraview] Saving slice data - a general query
Message-ID: <20071210220555.918781C0008A@mwinf3419.me.freeserve.com>

Hello

I am still learning the software and have downloaded some datasets to 
explore the functionality of Paraview. I have tested a 4D 
(volumetric) dataset, and can generate slices through the volume at 
any angle etc. However, I would like to be able to save the data from 
the slice as an XYZ format file (e.g. CSV) and the option of CSV is 
in the list although it never seems to do anything except generate a 
1kb file with a header line of X:points, Y:points, Z:points and no 
actual data. How can I extract the data from the slice as I would 
like to contour the data and post-process it through other applications?

As an aside, if I have have xyz data for several layers and want to 
generate a volume of data, can this be done through Paraview?

Thanks

Lester

Thanks, John, that fixed things. And by looking at the server xml for supplied 
modules I've modified the automatic GUI enough to get by.

Hello everybody,

I exported and I am using 3D vector exported from GRASS as VTK in

vector data (points) and 2D vectors (elevations). Is it possible somehow 
to import them into Paraview.

Many thanks

I've given this issue some serious consideration myself.  Actually, I
took it a step further and classified my options as follows: (1) static
linking, (2) dynamic linking (shared objects), (3) run-time-loaded
plugins.  They each have advantages and disadvantages.  Using
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE falls under (1) or (2) (depending upon
whether you specify shared objects in CMake).  Here's what I've learned:

I originally started out statically linking everything.  It's simple to
run.  No LD_LIBRARY_PATH's or plugin paths, etc.  But if you run it in
parallel on a single (multi-cpu/multi-core) node it takes up more
memory.  Keep in mind that each executable will load ALL of PV and VTK,
which can get big.  Also, if you change one of your custom plugins, you
have to recompile (though it doesn't take nearly as long as the first
time) and reinstall everything.

Option 2 (shared objects) takes care of the memory problem (the .so's
get loaded once per node and all execs share them), but you still have
to recompile.  You may get away with just swapping out the
.so(.dll/.dylib) files sometimes, but if you change the interface
there's stuff that gets generated by XML files that also usually needs
to be swapped out.  It's safest to just reinstall everything.

Recently, I've been using option 3, the run-time plugins.  If you're are
constantly adding to your plugins, it's very easy to just swap out the
.so files.  Also, you build each plugin separately (not as part of
ParaView's build process), so it's quick and clean.

Shared disks shouldn't be required on a cluster.  Since you must have
the executable installed on each node anyway, you should just be able to
put copies of the plugins in the same directory structure as the
executables.  You'll have to be careful to make sure the .so files on
each node all match each other.

That is a great summary. One additional consideration is whether you are 
preparing things for others to use. They may not always setup things so 
plugins load as needed; then, Option 2 has some advantages. I find that 
merely running "make" after a change is easy and quick enough that 
Option 2 is also easiest.

Am I correct that you still cannot use custom filters to "glue" two
filters together?  For instance, if I want to have two clip filters,
both at 90 degrees from each other, cut out a corner of a dataset, is it
possible to create a custom filter with the output of the first clip
going into the input of the second clip?

Also, I wonder if this is bug  number

Thanks,

Actually, I've had that same problem, that is, users that don't remember 
how to load plugins.  That was why I had posted that patch to 
automatically load plugins from the installed plugins directory.  I'm 
hoping some form of it it ends up in 3.2.2.

Hi Alan,

The example you mention is indeed supported (was supported with older 
Custom filter implementation and also with the recently revamped one). 
Simply create the clip filters as you want (with output of one going 
into another), then with both selected, go to the 'create custom filter' 
  menu option.

The bug 4442 is slightly different, in this case the two clips have the 
same input, not output of one going to the input of another. This case 
is still not supported, although is do-able using the extra pass through 
filter as mentioned in the report itselg.

That's good advice, except that the box implicit function is not yet
supported in ParaView 3.  It is a deliverable for 3.4.

Scott, 

I will not comment on the custom filters, but I would like to mention
that clipping twice will use a lot of memory - you might be better off
to use a vtkBox implicit function to clip in one pass (invert/insideout
the box function and align it so a corner overlaps your data). (Caveat,
there may not be a handy paraview wrapper for the box function so you
might have to do it yourself)

JB




Am I correct that you still cannot use custom filters to "glue" two
filters together?  For instance, if I want to have two clip filters,
both at 90 degrees from each other, cut out a corner of a dataset, is it
possible to create a custom filter with the output of the first clip
going into the input of the second clip?

Also, I wonder if this is bug  number
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=4442

Thanks,

Message-ID: <475EBD85.1040603@psc.edu>

ParaView 3.2.1 has a very annoying blinking thing along the bottom. I think it 
is supposed to be a progress bar but 99% of the time it is useless. It does 
something several times a second as I rotate an object.

Is there a way to turn it off?

Using the notes at

I've successfully added two custom readers to 3.2.1. However my custom filter 
does not show up in the pulldown menu for filters. All 3 are assigned to

   PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE

and the "USE" and "ON" CMake options for all 3 are set. The debugger can find 
the constructor for the custom filter. Is there anything needed to add the name 
of the custom filter to the filter menu?

The Tools->Manage Plugins menu is empty.

Are your custom filters in the "filters" group in your server manager xml?
<ProxyGroup name="filters">

And your server manager xml for the filters was added to the build using
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES?

The problem might be that your xml Input line looks like:
<InputProperty name="Input" command="SetInput">

When all my custom ones are using:
<InputProperty name="Input" command="SetInputConnection">

Also your CMakeLists looks odd I generally use a format somthing like this
PROJECT(Cloud)
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})


ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(CloudSMPlugin "1.0"
            SERVER_MANAGER_XML Cloud.xml
            SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkCloud.cxx

#SOURCES can be used to reference other cxx files your server manager

I'll try that. This filter is being ported from 2.6.1.

I'm not making a plugin but building the filter into PV as it is compiled. I 
think the format you suggest is for plugins.

I see now why it isn't showing up.  At startup, the entries in the filters 
menu are the ones listed in 
ParaView3/Qt/Components/Resources/XML/ParaViewFilters.xml.
If any new ones are introduced after startup, they are added, which is why it 
works with plugins.

To get it in there, try this...
=== cloudGUI.xml ===
<ParaViewFilters>
  <Filter name="Cloud" />
</ParaViewFilters>
================

Then add this in your cloudParaViewImport.cmake file.
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES("${cloud_SOURCE_DIR}/cloudGUI.xml")

Hmm.. I wish that wasn't necessary.

For fun, if you want to make your own menu category, you could do
<ParaViewFilters>
  <Category name="CloudFilters" menu_label="&amp;CloudFilters">
    <Filter name="Cloud"/>
  </Category>
  <Filter name="Cloud" />
</ParaViewFilters>

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.2.1 for Fedora
Message-ID: <47603121.4090203@cora.nwra.com>

There are ParaView 3.2.1 packages for Fedora in the updates-testing 
repositories for Fedora 7 and Fedora 8.  I would appreciate any feedback 
about their usefulness.  You can do:

yum --enablerepo=updates-testing install paraview

to test it out.  There is also a version compiled with OpenMPI called 
"paraview-mpi".

Comments can be made here:

In the mean time, the turn off option is to stick a piece of tape over
that part of your monitor.

Thanks, Clint. Unfortunately there still seems to be something wrong. I've 
attached the most relevant files. No errors or warnings during make but the 
following is printed when ParaView starts and the new filter is not available:

======
Failed to parse  ":/ParaViewResources/cloudGUI.xml"
Failed to parse  ":/ParaViewResources/cloudGUI.xml"
Failed to load  ":/ParaViewResources/cloudGUI.xml"
Failed to load  ":/ParaViewResources/cloudGUI.xml"
======

The actual path to that xml file is /home/eschenbe/PV/Kits/Cloud/cloudGUI.xml .

Suggestions?

Your files work for me.  "Failed to parse" means there's a syntax error in the 
xml file.  But I don't see one in the file you gave.

Subject: [Paraview] Manually set UGrid point IDs for time-series plotting?
Message-ID: <EF02C78F-FC66-4ED6-936B-A2310D535EAA@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I'm wondering if there is any way of manually setting point ID values  
within a vtkUnstructuredGrid? (I'm using Python to populate a UGrid  
from HDF5 data and then writing to *.vtu and *.pvd files for multiple  
time steps.)

I'm visualizing a time series of points diffusing in a space, where  
some particles appear and disappear over time. This presents a problem  
when I want to plot with Extract Points Over Time, because the point  
"index" that ParaView sees isn't consistent (doesn't correspond to a  
single particle) over the whole time series.

I have a scalar array of IDs associated with the point data, which I  
successfully use with John Biddiscombe's Temporal Trails Filter (since  
it has an option for using a scalar array for ID), but I don't know  
how to use that same info for XY plotting.

I see that the ExodusII reader puts some global ID info into a  
vtkModelMetadata object and packs it into the UGrid field data. (Then,  
I'm guessing that the Extract Points Over Time might be able to sense  
this and "un-grey" the Use Global Ids check box...?) Is there any  
other way (besides using a vtkExodusIIReader) to do the equivalent  
process, such that the info will be viewable by the plotting routines?

Thanks a lot,
-Eric

Clint,

There really was an error (a missing "<"). I had fixed it; erased two files in 
the build tree; and ran "make". Its my guess that the make files failed to see 
the change in the xml file. The two files I erased were

    /Qt/Components/moc_pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel.cxx
    /Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMGeneratedModules.h

because they had "Generated" in their name. Can you suggest other files to 
erase to force it to use the corrected xml file?

Thanks!

Hello,

vtkDataSetAttributes::SetGlobalIds(vtkDataArray*da) will flag the
array of ids as "the ids" and then the plot over time filters will be
able to use them instead of using the index into the cell/point
arrays.

Hey Dave,

Thanks for the answer -- I hadn't seen that one before.

That would solve it, but the SetGlobalIds method (for vtkPointData or  
vtkDataSetAttributes) doesn't seem to be available in the Python  
wrappers.

Does anyone know how to set the global Id attribute from Python?

Thanks,
-Eric

It's a laugh 'innit! I know there's something wrong with the cmake stuff 
because having to always touch/delete files in the build tree to force 
the correct menus to appear, but I've never had the time to actually fix 
it. Disclaimer : If this is not the trouble, then please disregard the

Hi ,

Maybe just deactivating the immediate mode will help you (if you can fit 
your data on the GPU), the painter will stop sending progress events each 
time it refreshes the screen.

Edit->settings 
        Render View menu, 
                unselect Use Immediate Mode Rendering

That did it; thanks! The new module won't connect as it should but that may be 
another problem.

Hello Everyone,

I want to create custom filters for Paraview using GLSL shaders. I have

LoadMaterial method) but I really don't know how to plug this in a 
paraview filter... How can I access to the property of an object ?  Do 
I  really have to write a filter in such a situation ?

Thanks for your answers...

Hello Dinesh,

 From what I understand, you can't use a .pvd file with Xdmf -- only  
with VTK XML files (.vtu, .vti, .vtp, etc). Right now, ParaView  
support for Xdmf is still in transition (from Xdmf v.1 to v.2). Here  
is a summary from a recent reply to me by Dave DeMarle:

> The transition is not yet complete, but we (Kitware and ARL) are

So, if you want to animate Xdmf files, you will have to follow the  
instructions in "Making custom readers work with file series" in the  
ParaView Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series Wiki entry. (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series 
) If you want to animate using PVD files, you will have to convert  
your files to XML-based VTK format.

Here is an example of a PVD file in case it's helpful:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"  
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
	<Collection>
		<DataSet timestep="0.00" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0000.vti"/>
		<DataSet timestep="0.25" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0010.vti"/>
		<DataSet timestep="0.50" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0020.vti"/>
		<DataSet timestep="0.75" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0030.vti"/>
		<DataSet timestep="1.00" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0040.vti"/>
		<DataSet timestep="1.25" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0050.vti"/>
		<DataSet timestep="1.50" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0060.vti"/>
		<DataSet timestep="1.75" group="" part="0"  
file="Fig3_cells_0070.vti"/>
	</Collection>
</VTKFile>

Good luck,

Hello everyone,

I regularly apply the same set of filters with very slight parameter modifications to similar data sets of the ever same format. Everytime I have to build about the same filter pipeline. I would like to automate that using the Python Shell. I would like to load a script into the python shell which does all these steps for me. I already have a script which adds and configures all the filters, but I still have to open the data files manually, because:

# My Python Code:
# - Loading EnSight Data -
pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
readerP = pm.NewProxy("sources","ensight")
readerP.GetProperty("CaseFileName").SetElement(0, "SomeEnsightCaseFile.case")
readerP.UpdateVTKObjects()
pm.RegisterProxy("sources","fluid",readerP) # THIS METHOD FAILS, stating "Failed to locate server for newly registered proxy ("sources", "fluid")"
# - Filter configuration -
# ...

Does anyone have an idea what causes this error and how it could be solved? Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Which version of paraview are you using? You may be using the older
python interface with a newer paraview. Look here for details:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:pvpython (follow the link to the
servermanager module documentation at the top).

Alexander,

Every proxy needs to know which server connection it is to be created on 
(it may be the connection to the builtin server). This is a moot point 
currently since ParaView supports only one server at a time, however it 
provides for future possibilities. Now, when you create a proxy using 
NewProxy, the connection id needs to be set on the proxy. This can be 
done as:

readerP = pm.NewProxy("sources", "ensight");
readerP.SetConnectionID(servermanager.ActiveConnection.ID)

alternatively, you can use the recommended API for creating proxies via 
python i.e.

readerP = servermanager.sources.ensight()

This should set the connection id correctly.

Now coming back to your use-case. In case where you have  fixed pipeline 
that you want to use over and over again, we now have what we call 
"Custom Filters". It's a composite filter consisting of a subpipeline. 
One can expose certain parameters from the internal filters which the 
user can explicitly change on each application of the filter. This 
functionality is under development and currently available in the CVS 
version.

Hey Dinesh,

If your data is a regular grid in all dimensions (2 or 3DCORECTMESH in  
Xdmf) then .vti format would be appropriate.

Earlier this week I wrote a Python script which grabs data from an  
HDF5 file (sim output from my collaborators) and writes .vtu files for  
unstructured grids and .vti files for the image data. Since it was my  
first Python program, I'm not sure how nice it is, but it works. It's  
also not very generic -- I needed a fast solution for a presentation  
next week, so it's very tailored to my application and HDF5 file  
structure. With these caveats, if you'd like to look at it as an  
example, I can send it to you.

Otherwise, I don't know of any converters out there. Maybe someone  
else has done this in a more general and elegant way.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hi Alexander,

Hi,

Hopefully this question is not too basic, but here goes:

I have a sequence of huge mesh files (400000+) degrees of freedom, 10000 
elements and would like to render a movie using paraview.
I have saved the files as euler_out_{timestep}.vtk, and can render the 
animation, it just takes a long time.

Unfortunately, the only way I know how to make a movie is to have 
paraview render each image to my computer screen--if a window goes in 
front of the image, it ruins the movie.  I would like to be able to 
start an animation, leave for the evening, and come back to a movie.
Or work on other things while the movie is being made in the background.

I guess one way is to figure out how to disable my screen saver, etc.. 
and render over night, but I was wondering if it is possible to have 
paraview render completely offline/offscreen (perhaps even on a 
different computer)...

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
-David N.

You could build a version of ParaView using Mesa then create your movie using 
that version's pvbatch. I'm sure there are many details to overcome but it 
seems that is the basic approach you need.

Which version of paraview are you using? For a while, ParaView has
been using offscreen rendering to capture images, as long as your
OpenGL driver supports offscreen rendering. Which platform are you on?

Hi Berk,

I have version 3.2.0.
I also have a version 2.6.2 sitting around.  Actually, on this version I 
recompiled the source, changing a line (I forget where--it was on the 
message board a while back) that allowed me to create images using 
offline rendering (before saving an image would crash paraview).

Ah, that explains it :-) So, here is the problem:
* The offscreen rendering implementation in your driver is buggy and
it causes a crash. So, I told you to comment out the line that enables
it.
* You want offscreen rendering.

Are you using Linux/Unix?

David,
I just checked with the Kitware 3.2.1 version from the www.paraview.org
site, and it uses off screen rendering - at least on my machine.
Windows XP.

If you recompile, use the VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON flag.

Subject: [Paraview] Why Are PVD Files Limited to VTK/XML?
Message-ID: <4762F778.5060207@psc.edu>

Most of the work of reading a PVD file is done in vtkXMLCollectionReader.cxx. 
It has a list of string pairs, "ReaderList", that in 3.2.1 includes 14 readers.

One of these is selected using the input file's extension then an instance of 
the reader is created with vtkInstantiator::CreateInstance. I think any reader 
could be instantiated this way.

It seems therefore that the PVD reader could be extended to most readers. 
Currently all readers are a subclass of vtkXMLReader but that doesn't seem to 
be necessary (though convenient).

Better yet, the code from "Open Data" could be applied to each file mentioned 
in the PVD file so that all readers and their "CanReadFile" methods are used. 
Seems elegant and useful.

Opinions?

I suggest compiling a paraview with Mesa enabling
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA for doing this. Make sure that you do not
comment out the line that enables offscreen rendering for this build.
You can then save animation either as usual using the GUI or save the
state and load it from a python script to generate the animation in
batch.

If you can run pvserver on your powerful desktop and connect to it with 
the paraview client running on the laptop, then there's another option 
for you to save animation overnight without the laptop connected:

Note that in this configuration you are no longer forwarding X to your 
laptop using "ssh -X". With the client connected to the server on your 
desktop, set up your scene. Now when you go to the save animation 
dialog, the "Disconnect before saving animation" check box should be 
enabled. When checked, the client disconnects from  the server before 
saving of the animation begins. After the client has disconnected, the 
server still continues running until it has finished saving out the 
animation.

Hi Berk, Alan, Utkarsh,

Thanks for the help.  I have a lot of learning to do.  I have been using 
very vanilla paraview up to this point, but it sounds like I need to 
learn more about the scripting and server/client approaches.

Berk-- I starting working with the python and got as far as viewing a 
saved state.  I shall have to try and learn to run an animation from 
this angle...

Utkarsh---I will try this approach.

Subject: [Paraview] F1-Help-Menue-Error using ParaView on a LiveCD
Message-ID: <4763B3A4.3030607@online.de>

Hi list members,

I'm trying to build a LiveCD (Debian Etch) with Paraview 3.2.1 on it.
The program starts and works on this LiveCD without any problem. Only
when I try to start the help menue (F1 or Help>Help) I get the error
message:

Help error
Couldn't find pqClient.adp.
Try setting the PARAVIEW_HELP environment variable which points to that
file.

File permissions of the whole program-directory are set to "rw(x)" for
all. The owner of this directory and the user of the program are the
same. So wrong file/dir permissions can't IMHO be the reason.

When I start the help menue manually with
"$ paraview-3.2-1-Linux-x86/bin/assistant -profile
paraview-3.2-1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/pqClient.adp"
the help menue appears without problems.

Even if I run the command
"$ chown -R <myuser>:<mygroup> paraview-3.2-1-Linux-x86"
before I start paraview there are no problems with the help menue.
But this is a bad idea on a LiveCD because the result of this command
costs over 100MByte of RAM.

Can anyone help me to solve this problem?

Regards,
Sebastian

Thanks for these examples! Actually I am looking for Cut

Did you figure out the problems with the cut filter yet?

Subject: [Paraview] All objects get clipped by plane when state reloaded
Message-ID: <WorldClient-F200712172229.AA29440006@wbmpl.com.au>

Hi,

In PV3.2 when I "save state" and reload the state, an invisible plane
seems to clip all viewable objects (not only data objects, but guides and
everything else as well).  When the objects are created from data
originally, there is no clipping, it only appears after state reload.  The
clipping plane is parallel to the viewing plane, and located between the
object and the viewing plane.  It becomes obvious when you start rotating
data objects.  I can provide more info on request.  Could the pvsm file be
activating some normally dormant functionality or is this a bug?  I have
the problem in a few month old cvs version, and just downloaded the 3.2
x86_64em binary and replicated the problem.

>   
I've done this.  What I did was:

- open the xml file as a binary file:
open(unit=vtu,file=vtufile,status='replace',form='binary')

- write the file headers, e.g.:
write(vtu) '<?xml version="1.0"?>',lf
write(vtu) '<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" 
byte_order="LittleEndian">',lf   
write(vtu) '  <UnstructuredGrid>',lf

etc., where lf=char(10) (line feed).

You can write the rest of the main part of the file in a similar way 
(except when referring to the appended data- see below).

- write the data out in raw binary at the end of the file:

<AppendedData encoding="raw">

then write an underscore character ('_') at the start of the data.  For 
each data array, write the size of the array in bytes at the start (as a 
4-byte integer), then the data itself, making sure the variables have 
the correct types to match what you have specified in the main part of 
the file (e.g. if you have specified '<DataArray type="Float32"' then 
the variable you write out to the appended data must be a 4-byte real.)  
Write '</AppendedData>' at the end, just before '</VTKFile>'.

- when you refer to data arrays in the main part of the file, use 
'format="appended"' and specify the offset in bytes to the relevant 
piece of appended data.  For example for the first data array you can 
say 'format="appended" offset="0"' because it's at the start of the 
appended data.

Hope this helps.  Using raw binary encoding, as I have done, means the 
files probably aren't very platform-independent or strictly valid xml.  
It would be better to use Base64 encoding or similar, but I couldn't 
figure out how to do that easily.

Message-ID: <82f4f6180712172159y4a4c6bcdv21a866884b1a91a5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
 I am trying to run Paraview 3.2.1 in client server mode. So here is
my setup, I have a cluster
of workstations n[1-3]. I launch the client on n1 and reverse connect
to my servers on n2 and n3.
I am running the client like this
$[n1] mpirun <...other MPI options...> paraview -s=n2 -s=n3
and server like this
$[n2] mpirun <...other MPI options...> pvserver -rc --client-host=n1
-tdx=2 -tdy=1
and
$[n3] mpirun <...other MPI options...> pvserver -rc --client-host=n1
-tdx=2 -tdy=1
but paraview connects only to n3 but not to n2.
I figured out from the list and corresponding with Weiguang that by creating a
servers.pvsc file in .config/ParaView/servers.pvsc and adding
<Servers>
  <Server name="builtin" resource="builtin:">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="n2" resource="csrc://n2:11111">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
  <Server name="n3" resource="csrc://n3:11111">
    <ManualStartup/>
  </Server>
</Servers>

I can't get the client to connect, when I remove the
--server=<nodename> line on the client, it does not
read the above file and does not connect. I have to manually say
file->connect and connect to a selected
server, but once I connect to one of them, it drops the connection
another server. Has the ability to
connect to multiple servers been disabled in 3.2.1 ?
I want to run one client and multiple servers to have a multi-tiled display.

Manju

Message-ID: <7676194844carpasvi@uv.es>

Hi,

I think that maybe I found a bug Paraview 3.x. It is a stupid thing:

If this line in my vtu file is used, everything works fine and the file
is properly plotted:

<DataArray type="Float64" Name="H" format="ascii" NumberOfComponents="1">

However, if I want to name the data with the absolute value such as:

<DataArray type="Float64" Name="|H|" format="ascii" NumberOfComponents="1">

The data is not plotted.

It seems that the "|" is not taken properly. Version 2.x of Paraview
accepted this.

Regards,

Carlos

So far you have been pretty vague about what mechanism you are trying to accomplish.  How are you trying to access the vtkProperty?  With python scripting?  In a plugin?  In a custom client?  As part of the custom filter?

Yes you're right Ken, I apologize for my lack of precision. In fact I'm 
new with Paraview so I'm exploring different approches for the moment...
I want to access the vtkProperty (or vtkActor) as part of a custom 
filter, because I need to compute things using a shader, but I also have 
to integrate functions in the classic filter way... (as part of the 
RequestData method for example). I think directly using the vtkProperty 
is a good (easy?) way to use shaders in paraview but maybe I'm totally 
wrong... So if someone can at least guide me in my futur investigations, 
it should be great.

Thanks.

I'm not sure if you really mean a custom filter (which is simply a collection of filters that behaves like a single filter) or a programmable filter (which is a filter that executes a python script to manipulate the data), but either way you cannot access vtkProperty.  In ParaView, just as in VTK, a filter does not have direct access to vtkProperty or any other rendering parameters.

A lookmark may be closer to what you want.  Lookmarks save a subset of the state relating to some section of the pipeline, including rendering parameters stored in vtkProperty.  However, this still doesn't get you to what you want to do, because ParaView 3 does not expose shader functionality.

In the move from ParaView 2 to ParaView 3, we lost the ability to add shaders to objects because (1) this feature is a low priority for most users and (2) the implementation did not seem to cover many of the use cases interested users had.

Unfortunately, I can think of no easy way to enable shaders in ParaView 3.  You would either have to add the functionality to the ParaView code or create a plugin that defined a new view that supported shaders.

Problem 1: Do not use mpirun with the paraview executable.  The ParaView
client is a serial application and should not be launched with mpirun.

Problem 2: Only launch the server with one mpirun command.  Use the -np
argument to mpirun to specify how many processes you want the server to
run in (in your case, probably 2).  If your MPI environment it set up
right, mpirun will automatically launch it on n2 and n3.  If not, either
change your MPI configuration or provide a machines file to mpirun to
specify on which hosts to run on.  The instructions for doing that vary
based on MPI implementations and installations.  Talk to your system
administrators for more information.

Two additional hints.

Set the "byte_order" to BigEndian if the machine writing the file is big endian.

The offset to an array in the appended binary area must be the size of previous 
appended arrays AND that 4-byte integer in front of each appended array. 
Example: if the first array is 10,000 bytes the offset to the second is 10,004.

Subject: [Paraview] Building Paraview Plugin on Windows
Message-ID: <47684425.3070103@mcs.anl.gov>


I'm trying to build a Paraview plugin on Windows using Visual Studio 
.NET 2003.  I've built GPL Qt (qt-win-opensource-src-4.2.3), and built 
Paraview against it.  I then try to build my plugin (which has built 
fine on OSX and Linux), and all seems fine until the final link step, 
when I get:

moc_StreamingToolBarActions.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external 
symbol "__declspec(dllimport) public: static struct QMetaObject const 
pqRenderView::staticMetaObject" 
(__imp_?staticMetaObject@pqRenderView@@2UQMetaObject@@B)

My plugin uses pqRenderView, so may be implicated in the problem.  Am I 
missing a step in configuring the plugin to bring in this missing 
definition? 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Tom Uram

Can you check the Visual Studio project to see if it is linking with 
pqCore.lib?

Subject: [Paraview] Loading netCDF files in Paraview
Message-ID: <19496476.891751198057148556.JavaMail.www@wwinf3107>

Hello

I was wondering if it is possible to convert to or from netCDF format to VTK? I use the Windows version of Paraview (v3.2.1) The netCDF format is a fundamental part of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and widely used in geophysics, so it would be useful to be able to load up single or multiple netCDF grids into VTK for use in volume rendering and generation of isosurfaces.

Hopefully there are some ideas on this aspect. Ideally I am looking for a precompiled windows converter that would do the job, or perhaps this could be built in to the next release of Paraview (big hint).

Thanks

Lester

Thanks for the answer.

In fact I'm working directly with the c++ sources of Paraview, so I try 
to implement shaders using and creating new c++ classes/custom 
filters... I now understand the fact that a vtkProperty can't be 
directly accessed by a custom filter, but I'm pretty sure there's a way 
to access actors present in the scene, in order to set the shader I 
want... (I have already seen it working, but using a dirty trick in the 
paraview code, and I would like to implement it as part of a plugin or 
new functionality). Maybe creating a specific display panel with a 
"shader" property exposed to users...

you could use GRASS GIS (www.grass.itc.it) for a workaround:

Import the netCDF data into GRASS using v.in.ogr and export it to VTK by using v.out.vtk (or r3.out.vtk)

Since shaders were at one time available in ParaView, there are probably still remnants in the server manager that allow you to set shaders through proxy objects.  Perhaps the original implementer of the shader GUI in ParaView 2.6 could speak up.  I think that was Utkarsh, but I'm not sure.

Hi all
Thanks for the info on this problem. Hopefully the next release will incorporate the available code and give a stable functionality for NetCDF files. Confusingly, in GMT the files are name.GRD which is also the same extension as used by Surfer (a different format)! The best situation would be to have Paraview be able to load and save to NetCDF format, so that if you slice a volume you could then read the data in GMT or, if converted, in Surfer for example.
Have not yet found a stand-alone windows program that can convert NetCDF to VTK (and back again) so this is definitely something that would be most welcome in Paraview. I have VTK too but it's a steep learning curve!
I think that I can just create XYZ data and load that in using the Comma Separated Value (CSV) format, although how that would work to build up a lattice strucure for volume calculations I'm not sure - still learning!
Thanks
Lester

First of, you simply cannot use shaders with 3.2. I've just committed
changes to Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml and
Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMSurfaceRepresentationProxy.cxx that now
provide access to the "Material" property on the representations.

This property can be used to the set the name of the xml material file
to be loaded. The file must be present on the client side, it will be
uploaded to the servers automatically.

Note that this property is on representations. Here's an example python 
code to load a material on a representation:

from paraview.servermanager import *
Connect("localhost")
src = sources.SphereSource()
view = CreateRenderView()
repr =CreateRepresentation(src, view)
repr.Material = "/tmp/Materials/GLSLTwisted.xml"
view.StillRender()

Subject: [Paraview] Error in MultiBlockPLOT3DReader
Message-ID: <47692BCE.3030308@onera.fr>

Hello,

I discovered Paraview 3.2.1 recently, Nice software.

I am using the MultibockPLOT3DReader for my data and I have found an 
error when reading Fortran Unformatted Plot3D files, that is reading 
with the options "Binary File", "Multi Grid" and "Has Byte Count" set 
on: when reading MultiGrid files with 5 grids, I have found that 
Paraview computed wrong min and max values of density, momentum 
components and stagnation energy. In particular, the min value of 
density was set to zero, athough I knew it should be 0.5857 for my data, 
and computing other Plot3d functions failed.

My Fortran Unformatted PLOT3D files were tested without problem in 
Fieldview, so I don't think they are corrupted. And also, I have 
verified with a C program that the true min and max values were not the 
values computed by Paraview. But all became OK in Paraview after I 
converted my data in pure Binary files without Byte Count, so the 
problem in Paraview is really when reading Fortran Unformatted PLOT3D 
files that require "Binary File", "Multi Grid" and "Has Byte Count" to 
be set on together.

I looked at the source and I have found that the MultiBlockPLOT3DReader 
skips the four leading "Byte Count" bytes before reading all density, 
momentum and stagnation energy values in a single record, but it does 
not skip again the trailing "Byte Count" bytes after reading the data 
record as it should do! That does not matter if you have a single grid 
file, but when you have several grids, data are shifted in the arrays 
each you read a new grid. The problems is only when reading the "q" file 
in the loop on i from 0 to numBlocks starting at line 943 in the file 
"vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader.cxx". I think that you should add 
"this->SkipByteCount(qFp)" at the end of the loop just after line 1059.

I hope that developers can check if I am right, and maybe include the 
corrected reader in a future Paraview release?

Best regards.

Then I'm not sure what the problem is.
What about a manual rebuild of moc_StreamingToolBarActions.obj?

Subject: [Paraview] paraview latest versions and MFIX
Message-ID: <69b558fe0712191025g42392d54lb360a98fe26048e3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Group,
I have been using paraview version 2.6 to visualize the MFIX data. I
did some upgrades to the g++ libraries, and probably some more
libraries that I do not remember, and ever since then paraview has
stopped working on my machine. So I downloaded and installed the newer
versions (3.0.2, 3.2.0, 3.2.1) and found out that none of them
includes the reader for MFIX data. Can someone tell me a workaround
this problem as it is very urgent for me to get paraview running
smoothly on my Linux box in order to visualize the MFIX data.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Rahul

Seems like a dependency issue. Which version of cmake and paraview are
you using?

Berk/Orion,
I see the same thing on of our clusters.  A rebuild (not from scratch)
always fixes it.  But, the point, it is repeatable.

This was a problem in VTK/Examples/CMakeLists.txt. It needed explicit
dependencies on vtkInfovis and vtkViews, which were missing until I just
committed the fix. This should not happen again after your next cvs update.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.2.1 Crashes When Showing UInt8 Vector
Message-ID: <47697EA5.5080705@psc.edu>

A vti file using a vector of 3 UInt8 per cell loads and displays fine in 2.6.1 
and loads correctly in 3.2.1 (on the Information tab everything is correct). 
But in 3.2.1 when I change "Color by" from "Solid Color" to the vector paraview 
crashes.

The UInt8 vector is the color of the cell. Once it is selected I can uncheck 
"Map Scalars" to see the color.

The debugger traceback is
    _nv000130gl
    libGLcore.so
    libvtkRendering.so.pv3.2
    ??

ParaView 3.2.1 from source
g++ 4.1.2
cmake 2.4.6
Fedora Core 6
Pentium 4

My vti file is 16kb and I can send it to anyone who wants to take a look.

TIA!

The patch below will enable the MFIX reader. I will commit this in the
near future. I need to make some fixes to the MFIX reader to allow
time animation.

Message-ID: <1198151612.3339.10.camel@augpc-erdw-geo-hpx-dock-2074.ethz.ch>

Hi all

I compiled paraview today with these obtions: 

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ON
VTK_USE_RPATH ON

but when I try to run it I get the error: 
paraview: error while loading shared libraries: libpqComponents.so:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This file lies in the
folder /usr/local/lib/paraview-3.3/libpqComponents.so and during make
install it is also linked: 

Linking CXX shared library
CMakeFiles/CMakeRelink.dir/libpqComponents.so

How can I solve this problem? Any help is appreciated. I am using Suse
10.3 and python 2.5.

Cheerz, 
Corinne

Subject: [Paraview] vtkStringArray Properties
Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0712200645p776b0eeegd4980222fa2bc7ee@mail.gmail.com>

I have written some python code, for object creation using the python
programmable source. One of the properties I am adding to the object is a
cell based vtkStringArray.
The issue is that I am facing two issues, one is that I am unable to
threshold the vtkStringArray, since the following line always returns null:
   vtkDataArray *inScalars = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0,inputVector);

and secondly, if I try to save or load an object with a vtkStringArray
property in windows, I crash paraview.

Does anybody know if this a bug inside paraview, or should I be using some
form of Char Array, etc

Hi Kent,

We can't reproduce this on OS X and Linux. You said 2.6.1 displays
this dataset fine. Are you running it on the same machine? The only
difference in rendering between 2.6 and 3.2 is that 2.6 does not use
display lists by default and 3.2 does. Can you go to Preferences ->
Render VIew and turn on Use Immediate Mode Rendering? Does that make
a difference? Are you doing anything other than simply loading and
rendering this object?

The fact that you cannot threshold with string array is expected. The
fact that it crashes is a bug :-) Is there a dataset you can provide
as an example?

Shared objects can be found only if they are in a standard location (such as 
/usr/lib) or in locations listed in the environment variable for this. For 
example, try setting

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH usr/local/lib/paraview-3.3

and see if things work better.

Turn VTK_USE_RPATH OFF.  Doing a make install with it ON is not supported.

Yes, both 2.6.1 and 3.2.1 are on the same machine.

Test: change setings; load data; change from solid color to color by varaible.

Immediate=on Strips=on => crashes
Immediate=on Strips=off => works
Immediate=off Strips=on => crashes
Immediate=off Strips=off => works

The results are the same for 2.6.1 and 3.2.1 except that the last case cannot 
be selected in 2.6.1.

Changing from a case that works to one that usually causes a crash does NOT 
cause a crash if the change is made while the object is still displayed. Thus 
the desired case must be set before loading and displaying the data.

Ah, I can reproduce it with this information. I was hoping to be able
to say it is a driver bug :-) I will enter a bug report. For now, I
suggest turning of triangle strips.

Hey Dave,

I have now been able to successfully use the SetGlobalIds() method for  
my vtkUnstructuredGrid PointData, but there seem to be some issues  
with reading the *.vtu files into ParaView properly.

ParaView recognizes that there are Global Ids set (the Use Global Ids  
check box becomes available in both the Plot Point Over Time and the  
Selection Inspector), but they don't seem to be valid for some reason.  
For example, when points are selected, the Selection Inspector shows  
the Index for the points, but if you check Use Global Ids the list  
goes blank (and plotting using these Global Ids doesn't work, and in  
the Selection Inspector if you try to uncheck Use Global Ids, ParaView  
crashes).

ExodusII files seem to work fine in all these cases, but not VTK XML  
Unstructured Grids. If I save either box.ex2 or can.ex2 as a vtu file,  
then reload it, PV behaves just like with my data. (In case it helps,  
I noticed that the global IDs' Data Type are listed for ex2 files as  
"idtype", while they are listed as "int" for an unstructured grid  
loaded from a vtu file.)

Any clues as to where the problem might lie (me, VTK, ParaView...)?

Thanks,
-Eric

Sounds like a bug in the vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader. Perhaps it  was
not updated to use vtkIdTypes. I will try to reproduce the bug and
look into it.

You are absolutely right. I have been working on the plot3d reader for
some other project and discovered the same issue. Once I am done with
my changes, I will incorporate them back to the paraview repository.
It may not make into a 3.2 patch release but should make into the 3.4
release. I am also working on plot3d file series (for time support)
and reading (multi-block) plot3d files in parallel.

Subject: [Paraview] os x crash when laptop changes screen
Message-ID: <be6d1720712212202g2bf97cd7ga445c5f1d2eaa1fd@mail.gmail.com>

I have a MacBook Pro and have been working my way through the paraview
tutorial. At work I connect the laptop to a 30" screen and paraview
runs fine. When I disconnect from the 30" screen and launch paraview
at home, it becomes unstable. It will instantly crash if I try to
"Open" from either the menu and the tool bar button. There are some
other minor screen-size related issues as well.

Is there a configure file or some setting I need to twiddle when I
switch screens like this?

Subject: [Paraview] Tensor glyph visualization
Message-ID: <82f536810712251121oabcd556q145ab383727d954b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is it possible to visualize VTK tensor data in Paraview? If not, is
this something which is planned to be included in the future releases?

I found this post
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-March/004774.html,
but no development...

Thanks

Hello.

The tube filter has a "Vary radius" option to vary the radius of the tubes by 
either a scalar or a vector. How can I select the array to use to vary 
radius?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Error with vti file, endianness?
Message-ID: <B775370B-B114-4865-B079-3F566F0B55EF@ed.ac.uk>

Hi folks,

I'm using a .pvd file (first url) to load .vti files, one of which is  
given below (second url).

http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~cwarren/vtk/Utsi_1000_fs27.pvd
http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~cwarren/vtk/Utsi_1000_fs27_snap01.vti

The vti files were written on a little endian machine but when viewing  
them I'm getting the following error message from PV 3.2.1 on Mac OS X  
PPC.

ERROR: In /Users/davidcole/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/IO/ 
vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx, line 314
vtkXMLImageDataReader (0xe65dba0): Error reading extent 50 160 50 135  
50 52 from piece 0


ERROR: In /Users/davidcole/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/IO/ 
vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 497
vtkXMLImageDataReader (0xe65dba0): Cannot read point data array "E- 
field" from PointData in piece 0.  The data array in the element may  
be too short.

I pretty sure my files are constructed correctly.

Any thoughts most appreciated.

They are probably not, because trying to read them on a little-endian 
machine gives the same error.

> Any thoughts most appreciated.

I have not yet found a working example for this XML stuff with appended 
raw binary data. The other none-working example I'm aware of is this:

http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/intranet/it-service/applications/paraview/paraview-demo-files/vox8_binary_appended_raw.vtu

I suggest to use base64 encoded binary data. This works fine for me.

Subject: [Paraview] compile Qt-4.3.3, please help!
Message-ID: <307587.34924.qm@web35313.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I would like to compile paraview-3.2.1 from source for CFD data visualization.  I am using 64 bit OpenSuSE 10.2.  It has Qt-4.2.1 installed.  I am not able to update it to the latest version.  Hence, I downloaded qt-X11-opensource-src-4.3.3.tar.gz and installed it to its default directory.  Then, export PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.3.3/bin:$PATH.  However, when I issued cmake in paraview, I got complains from paraview that, I have qt-4.2.1 and at least qt-4.2.3 is required.  How do I get paraview to recognize the new qt-4.3.3 I installed?  Thanks!

Peiying

Make sure that qmake for Qt 4.3.3 is in your path BEFORE that of 4.2.1
and re-run cmake. I recommend cleaning all of your build tree first.

I would suggest get the sources of qt-x11-opensource-src-4.2.3, and install it in you home directory. Leave the system-wide installation of qt-4.3.3 as it is. This is my personal experience that ParaView compiles only with qt-4.2.3. Once qt is properly installed in your home directory, run ccmake and point to qt-4.2.3 where ever qt is required.
