Subject: [Paraview] newbie: OpenFOAM reader, empty view window
Message-ID: <1225545552.3709.22.camel@marija.kucnaMreza>

Hello,

    I'm a complete newbie here, so excuse my questions:

How do I make OpenFOAM reader read the entire case, and so fill the
timeStep property list, so I can animate later on?

Also, when reading a .vtk file, my view window shows nothing(just black
background) when I call for StillRender(). I then write the file in .png
format, the window then appears only briefly (I barely noticed) and when
i call StillRender(), data appears in the view. I'm battling with it for
a while now, i've gone over the scripting part of the book,and still
don't know what is wrong.


I'm running OpenSUSE 11, 32 bit and Paraview 3-3-cvs that came with the
OpenFOAM installation. I've built it with python support. 




Thank You,


Tomislav Maric

Subject: [Paraview] zoom to data
Message-ID: <1225552706.3709.29.camel@marija.kucnaMreza>

Hello,

I'm browsing through servermanager.CreateRenderView().GetActiveCamera()
methods, and I have a question: is it possible somehow to set the active
camera properties so that all of the data is within vtk view window, but
without loading a paraview state file? When I work in Paraview GUI
frontend, there is a button "zoom to data" under the display tab in the
object inspector. Is there a proxy for that button, that applies on the
view from servermanager.CreateRenderView? I'm having problems
visualising my data, because I'ts far away and under a strange angle at
the start, so i have to combine pitch, distance, position and other
methods to get it displayed.

Thank you,

Tomislav Maric

Hi Peter,

thank you so much for the help, it got me on the way, but I still have
some questions.

Here's what i've tried: 

    I didn't set wireframe, points , etc, and ResetCamera and
StillRender give me a black screen. I took your advice and did this:

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

camera = view.GetActiveCamera()

and then i played arround with camera.SetPosition() and camera.Zoom(),
and without setting the wireframe or anything else, I got the picture of
my data. Now I'm really puzzled. Why doesn't ResetCamera place my data
within the display window in the first place? 

And one other thing worries me: if I make any view change via the camera
object (i.e. camera.SetPosition(x,y,t)), any call to StillRender()
brings back the black screen. Still, if I save my data like this:

view.WriteImage ('pathNameOfMyData','vtkPNGWriter'), and afterwards call
StillRender() my data's back on the view window. 

Does it matter if I'm reading .vtk data from stand alone python
interpreter linked correctly to work with paraview modules?


Regards,
Tomislav

Subject: [Paraview] automated animation in python
Message-ID: <1225567352.3709.50.camel@marija.kucnaMreza>

Hello everyone,

   I wrote a script that automates animation of large .vtk data sets
that are distributed in timestep directories. When i wrote the script i
had to open .vtk data with LegacyVTKFileReader, and it's FileNames
attribute is a string representing pathname for a given file in .vtk
format. What i would like to know is: how can I open gzipped files with
LegacyVTKFileReader? My script now gunzip's files, and gives FileNames
proper string values, but because of that is horribly slow. Is it
possible for LegacyVTKFileReader to be overloaded so he takes python
file object? Python's gzip.open is much faster, and returns python file
instance...

Message-ID: <3b6093ef0811011254r2532088aw4181b33b17cd1082@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I was able to compile paraview with the USE_VTK_GL2PS (as far as I can
tell) module activated (paraview 3.4) in order to save data in .eps
format.  Unfortunately I'm quite stuck on how to implement this from a
python script.  I can easily save it to a png via:

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
-- some code --
view.WriteImage("test.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 1)

I've tried:
view.WriteImage("test.eps", "vtkGL2PSExporter", 1)
with various permutations and I get:
ERROR: In /home/peter/lib/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMRenderViewProxy.cxx,
line 1131 vtkSMRenderViewProxy (0x7fe8a82704d0): Object is not a
vtkImageWriter: vtkGL2PSExporter 20008.

I assume this means that the WriteImage method is not what I'm looking
for but I can't seem to find the appropriate call to do so.  I've
looked at the source code and documentation at
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGL2PSExporter.html but
have not been able to do anything productive with it.

Any help on how to export image data from paraview using python would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Peter

Dear all,

I am trying to write my first plugin reader and trying to follow the
examples on the wiki.
I am stuck with annoying syntax error, which I can't seem to understand
where its coming from - can some one tell me where I am going wrong please?

Here is my top bit of the header file, where the error is being generated

class VTK_EXPORT myFancyReader : public vtMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm {
    public:
        static myFancyReader* New();
};
#endif

apparently there is a syntax error at the line where it begins with class -
when its trying to generate myFancyReaderClientServer.cxx

My CMakeLists.txt is
    ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyReader "1.0"
               SERVER_MANAGER_XML readers.xml
               GUI_RESOURCES pqReader.qrc
               SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES myFancyReader.cxx
               )

Thanks very much,
Rakesh

I believe the wrapper code that generates the ClientServer bindings
requires that your class name start with vtk. Try changing it to
vtkMyFancyReader.

If you already have the ascii VTK file, you can convert it to binary
by loading it in ParaView and saving it out as binary format. It is
pretty easy to automate this using Python. Let me know if you need an
example.

This is not true. If you using appended binary format, you do not need
the base64 encoding. You can write it raw binary. The only trick is
that the XML section stores position attributes that point to the
binary section. This requires a bit of book keeping when writing. For
more documentation on the XML format see:

http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_XML_Formats

For those that are willing to like VTK, we have bindings for C and
Fortran to write the XML based file formats.

Also, there is this fortran library:
http://stefano.zaghi.googlepages.com/lib_vtk_io. I haven't used it but
it look promising.

Hi David,

The python code to achieve what you want should look like:

pm        = servermanager.ProxyManager()
mha_slice = pm.GetProxy("sources","mha_slice")
mha_slice.CutFunction[0].Normal = [1, 0, 0]

assuming that mha_slice is a Cut (slice) filter. I found a bug that
causes this to not work. I will fix it. For now, try this:

pm        = servermanager.ProxyManager()
mha_slice = pm.GetProxy("sources","mha_slice")
mha_slice.CutFunction[0].SMProxy.GetProperty("Normal").SetElement(0, 1)
mha_slice.CutFunction[0].SMProxy.GetProperty("Normal").SetElement(0, 0)
mha_slice.CutFunction[0].SMProxy.GetProperty("Normal").SetElement(0, 0)
servermanager.GetRenderView().StillRender()

PS: StillRender() is roughly equivalent to Apply

Hi Berk
 
Thanks for the information. With the help of yourself and others on the mailing list I have now got my large data "cube" into Paraview. Like all things new, it always helps to have the advice of experts on the methodology; so many thanks to all who have helped :)
 
Saving to binary format is useful and saves on space too!
 
One point I am not clear on is that I can generate the surface view and set the scalar to display density, as a cube, slice or clipped body, but when I try the volume option it shows nothing.
 
# vtk DataFile Version 3.0vtk outputASCIIDATASET STRUCTURED_POINTSDIMENSIONS 151 151 101SPACING 200 -200 -100ORIGIN 291024 2055975 0POINT_DATA 2302901SCALARS density doubleLOOKUP_TABLE default2.32.32.3 etc
 
I also tried the clean_to_grid filter and although the file size goes up, there was still nothing on the volume view, and in fact caused Paraview 3.4.0 to crash.
 
Thanks

Can you post a small example for us to look at? You can use the subset
filter to reduce the size of your dataset.

Thanks - that was one of them annoying errors !

I would like vtkMyFancyReader to create an instance of another class, say
myReader.h which doesn't extend from a vtkClass - how would I create this
class?

Can i add myReader.cxx as SOURCE in the CMake below?

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyFancyReader "1.0"
             SERVER_MANAGER_XML readers.xml
             SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyFancyReader.cxx
             SOURCES vtkReader.cxx
               GUI_RESOURCES pqReader.qrc
               )

This compiles, but is this the write way to go?  My confusion is that,
myReader.h also need reside on the server ( i assume?), but I don't think I
need to extend it from a vtkClass as I don't any functionalities from it -

What I do need is be able to do the following in vtkMyFancyReader.cxx

myReader reader = new myReader();
reader.doSomething();

what is the correct way to go about it?

Thanks,
Rakesh

I use the technique of compiling my sources into paraview as I build  
ParaView so I do something like:


   MESSAGE (STATUS "Compiling PVDislocation into Paraview 3.x")
   #-- Invoke this Macro to add the sources to paraview and
   #-- wrap them for the client server
   PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES ("${PVDislocation_WRAPPED_SRCS}")

   #-- Invoke this macro to include non-wrapped sources in the build
   PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SOURCES("${PVDislocation_SRCS}")
   # -- Add the Server Manager XML
   # Place the package configuration file into the build tree.
   CONFIGURE_FILE(${PVDislocation_SOURCE_DIR}/PV3-xml/$ 
{MODULE_NAME}_Filters_GUI.xml
                  ${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}/${MODULE_NAME}_Filters.xml  
@ONLY IMMEDIATE)

   CONFIGURE_FILE(${PVDislocation_SOURCE_DIR}/PV3-xml/$ 
{MODULE_NAME}_GUI.xml
                  ${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}/${MODULE_NAME}.xml @ONLY  
IMMEDIATE)

   # Place the package configuration file into the build tree.
   CONFIGURE_FILE(${PVDislocation_SOURCE_DIR}/PV3-xml/$ 
{MODULE_NAME}_PVSM.xml
                  ${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}/${MODULE_NAME}.pvsm @ONLY  
IMMEDIATE)

   # -- Add the Server Manager XML
   PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES(${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}/$ 
{MODULE_NAME}.pvsm)
   # -- Add the Client side xml
   PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES("${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}/$ 
{MODULE_NAME}.xml")
   PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES("${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}/$ 
{MODULE_NAME}_Filters.xml")

So you need something similar in your CMakeLists.txt file

Hmm, sounds far too complicated !

Would it be a crime just to extend from a VTK class instead but not make any
use of the methods within the superclass?

I was wondering if I could do something similar to the example shown on the
wiki
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_Examples

That aside, what is the meaning of VTK_EXPORT in the definition below?

class VTK_EXPORT vtkMyFancyReader : public vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm

I also see VTK_FILTERING_EXPORT

Rakesh

Hi Berk
 
Thanks for the interest in this problem. I have done a smaller sub-set, and even this does not work with the volume view which seems a bit odd as all other views work in 3.4.0
 
It's not a big issue but would be interested to know if there is anything odd in the input data causing it. I do know that when I was testing the data with 2 or 3 layers it was working but the full data comprises 101 layers. The full data cube is about 800kb when saved in binary format.
 
For background, the data were output from a Fortran program that converts seismic velocity to density, for use in forward calculation of gravity. The data is a "cube" of data XYZ of 30 x 30 x 10 km, with XY spacing 200m and Z spacing 100m (0 to 10 km depth).
 
All other options that I needed with the data are fine, like slice, clip and probing (line or point). As a separate check I tried the data in VisIt 1.10 and the volume option again came up blank so I suspect a peculiarity with the data. As I mentioned previously, changing the data to a grid made no difference as far as the volume view was concerned.
 
Hopefully the experts will be able to see if there is a problem.
 
Thanks

Yes, and it is only the case with one of my plugins. My general remark 
would be plugging should be more verbose to allow debugging...

with regards,

Subject: [Paraview] problems assigning vector data in xdmf-file
Message-ID: <BAY122-W10BE0CA88DEEFEE752E0E7BC1D0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m trying to assign vector attribute data to my grid, that?s what I put in my .xmf-File:

<Attribute Name="XmYm" Type="Vector" Center="Node">
<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="41525 3" Format="HDF">
c2d-T100-8r_00001.h5:/Curvilinear/xm_ym
</DataItem>
</Attribute>

(Before that I specify my grid and that works, I tested it without the attribute data)

in my .h5 file the data is a 41525 array, i.e. 41525 rows and 3 columns specifying the x,y,z coordinate, and the values are correct. 

trying to load it into paraview, paraview says:
ERROR: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\Filtering\vtkDataSet.cxx, line 399
vtkStructuredGrid (05B65380): Point array XmYm with 3 components, only has 13841 tuples but there are 41525 points



ERROR: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\Filtering\vtkExecutive.cxx, line 757
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (05EF6A30): Algorithm vtkPVGeometryFilter(05ECEF48) returned failure for request: vtkInformation (05F71348)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 80061

  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA
  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1
  KEYS_TO_COPY: UPDATE_BLOCKS
  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0
  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
I don?t know why it says that there are just 13841 tuples. in my .h5 file there are 41525, looking at it with the hdfviewer. 

Does anyone know what?s the problem here?

thx,
NH

Natalie,

"Type" in the Attribute should be "AttributeType" .... but that is not 
the problem.

For some reason it's not seeing the second dimension in
the HDF5 file (i.e. it sees it as rank=1 not rank=2) Notice
41525 / 3 = 13841.

Just for giggles try :

h5ls -vr c2d-T100-8r_00001.h5/Curvilinear/xm_ym

If it shows dims = 41525 instead of 41525 x 3 that's
the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkGL2PSExporter issues
Message-ID: <3b6093ef0811030856n1f5a33f1l99cdaf32230d0abf@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've managed to get paraview to write out eps data via the python
interface using the vtkGL2PSExporter.  But now I appear to have some
other issues.

1.  The files are very large.  If I turn the Compress option on they
are small but then I am unable to read them.  Any thoughts?

2.  The quality is not particularly good.  I've tried playing with all
the options that the vtkGL2PSExporter has but none of them seem to
generate a high quality picture.  (I'm doing a 2D contour plot and the
resulting eps image is quite pixelly).  Anyone know how to fix this?

3.  My black contours show up.  My gray contours show up.  But if I do
a gray scale, even though the contours show up nicely in the rendering
window, they are not present in the eps image.  (Although I'm pretty
sure they do get written to the eps file since it is approx 5MB, which
is quite large for a blank image).  Is there a way for me to set the
color scale in the exporter so everything shows up?

If anyone has experienced similar issues and has some thoughts or
suggestions, I would be very interested to hear them.

Thanks,
Peter.

Subject: [Paraview] Building a plugin that works with Mac binary distribution
Message-ID: <C5348AA4.302C%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Does anyone have experience building a plugin on Mac that will work with the
binary distribution of ParaView?  I tried getting the 3.4.0 source,
compiling with the same dependent libraries as listed on the Wiki, and then
compiling my plugin against that, but it did not work.

I think the issue is with getting the libraries to link.  If I compile
ParaView with rpath off, the plugin fails to load with an unhelpful error
saying that it is not a valid Qt plugin.  If I compile ParaView with rpath
on, then the libraries get hard coded against my build.  If I try to load
the plugin on my machine, I get an error about Qt objects being in different
threads, which I think is because the plugin is using a different set of
Qt/VTK/ParaView libraries then the application.  I suspect it would not load
at all on another machine.

How do you get the libraries to resolve correctly?

I can only say I was very pleased with gl2ps results, but from a custom 
vtk code, not PV.

Thanks for your reply.  I was able to accomplish what I needed using
the vtkPostScriptWriter.  Perhaps it's better integrated with the PV
source than gl2ps?

Funny, I was betting how long it would take before someone asked just  
these same questions.

The short answer is, Yes, it _could_ be done.

The long answer is, well, long..

In order to compile/link against the binary distribution you need to  
first have the exact same Xcode version that Kitware's Qt and ParaView  
were compiled with.

Next you need all the headers from ParaView (which I am not sure if  
those are included in the binary distribution or not).

Next you will need to have a project where when you compile your  
plugin against all the libraries that are within the binary  
distribution.

If you compile your plugin as a MODULE and NOT SHARED then you should  
be good to go at this point. You will need to copy your plugin to the  
ParaView 3.4.0.app/Contents/Plugins directory and see if it loads.


What would be nice is if there were some cmake files included with the  
binary distribution that allowed all this. As of yet, there isn't  
anything like this so you are into brand new territory.

I'm happy to say that I got this working, although with slightly different
instructions than Mike suggests below.  I already had matched up the Xcode
and Qt for my build of ParaView.  The way I got it to work was to compile my
plugin and copy that to the bin directory of my ParaView build.  I then ran
"make install" on ParaView.  The make install target converts all of the
library links from executables and libraries within ParaView to paths
relative to the executables.  Because I copied my plugin to be with the rest
of the ParaView libraries, the appropriate library directory mangling was
applied to it as well.

Although this works, the process is a little, uh, awkward.  Would the
library type (MODULE vs. SHARED) clear up the difference?  I am simply using
the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro to create the library.  It looks like it is
creating a SHARED library.  Should that be set to MODULE instead?

-Ken

Message-ID: <49104F2B.5050008@itis.ethz.ch>

Configuring with cmake, is it possible - other than hacking - to use 
Release builds for VTK or PV *and* Debug mode for my own stuff? On linux 
I can easily do that (with different CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE's), but on Windows 
it seems in order to debug my own stuff I have to compile the whole VTK 
/ PV in debug mode, which I dont need/want - this is particularly 
annoying with PV long compilation times. Selecting
'Debug' as the build mode looks for libraries in bin\Debug. 
Unfortunately, just copying is not smart enough - I get mysterious 
crashes tracing back nowhere.

Thanks for any hints,
Dominik

If you want to debug things with the Microsoft compiler on Windows, you have
to build *everything* loaded into the process as a "Debug" configuration. It
is worth the extra time taken to do this. Otherwise, you will simply have
mysteries on your hands and you will spend countless hours pulling your hair
out trying to figure out why something is crashing when there is clearly
nothing wrong with the source code...

Mismatches between Debug and Release are just simply not a good idea with
the Microsoft compiler. (Because the Debug/Release variants of the runtime
libraries have different structures associated with memory allocations and
allocating in one while deallocating in the other frequently leads to
disaster...)

HTH,
David

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering large datasets using offscreen rendering...
Message-ID: <49107691.1010209@nacad.ufrj.br>


Folks, I need some tips for rendering a large dataset using offscreen 
rendering in a SGI Altix-ICE.

Basically, I have a 40 million tetrahedra mesh partitioned in 128 cpus. 
The result is stored in Xdmf format (15 time steps) and I can 
successfully load the datasets in ParaView 3.4.0 and do basic things  
like plot the result in isosurfaces or colorize the model with a scalar 
field. The problem begins to happen when I try to change the model 
opacity. PV takes forever before crashing MPI.

I guess that the problem with opacity is due to the compositing order 
but I can't figure out a way to use it. I already tried to disable 
ordered compositing but it hasn't helped so much.

Any idea would be appreciated. Thanks,

Renato.

Actually, I just need it for one function. Thanks for the hint!

Thanks a lot, no I never have on Windows. On linux I used to have 
debugging problems with both the optimization AND debugging, with the 
stack pointer leading into bushes, so I guess on Windows it will not be 
better... will it?

OK, now it works! The newly-generated vtk files contains now an extra part

POINT_DATA 5000
SCALARS Result double
LOOKUP_TABLE default
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

where 1 is the value I gave to the calculator filter.
I can then load the new vtk file, apply the gliph filter, set scale
mode to "scalar", tick the edit box and set 1 as the value, then
visualization is correct.

Well, I cannot comment on Povray's inner workings. But to me the
situation looks different: I am telling povray (or any other code at
that regard) that in physical position (x1,y1,z1) I want a sphere with
physical diameter 1 and in position (x2,y2,z2) another sphere always
with diameter 1. If the distance between the two sphere
[sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 + (z1-z2)^2))] is equal to one, the two
spheres must touch, if larger they cannot and if smaller than 1 they
overlap. How that is showed and rescaled on screen is not my business,
but the fact that spheres overlap/do not overlap is fixed by their
radius and their coordinates. I do not need (nor want) to provide
povray with any extra info about what the sphere stands for.
Thanks a lot for the very appreciated help.
Kind Regards

You can't mix debug/release builds because they link to different 
runtime libs.

However, you can disable optimization in your release build. This gets 
you proper debugging in your code while everything else is fast (and not 
debuggable...)

I often do this on a file-to-file basis using #pragma optimize("", off) 
when I need debug a singular function in release. Doing it for the 
entire project is perhaps what you're looking for?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView/Xdmf bad memory usage
Message-ID: <4910BA9E.3050700@nacad.ufrj.br>


There's something wrong with memory allocation employed by ParaView 
(3.4.0) OR Xdmf library. When I load a temporal collection of spatial 
collections it seems that ParaView (or Xdmf) is trying to allocate 
memory for all time steps at once as it were a multiblock of 
multiblocks. My guess is that each time step should be loaded when 
required AND after unloading the previous time step in order to release 
some memory. Is there any workaround for this problem or it was really 
designed to work in this way?

Regards

Renato.

p.s.: I can provide a large dataset (40M tets/128 cpus/15 time steps) 
for debugging purposes.

I am not an expert on this issue, but it seems like you'd have to buy
the commercial license to the qt gui libraries.

As I thought, this is getting quite complicated.

Ideally, I would like to distribute just plugins, but have seen way too 
many discussions on the list how to do it right and robust, so am 
considering just a whole build for simplicity.

Question is: do I need a commercial QT license. But I seem to get the 
answer: no, as long as I do not use it myself and only rely on PV whose 
source I reference.

Thanks,
Dominik

I believe this is correct. If you are not writing any Qt related code, 
then you are fine.

I think as long as Dominik supplies the source code he can release it  
all under the GPL and do his own builds with his own plugins, Qt or not.

Now, If Dominik can NOT release his source code for his plugins then I  
believe he must use the commercial Qt license.

A related distinction is that if you want to commit code to the vtk or  
paraview repositories that has Qt code in it then you MUST have a  
commercial Qt license otherwise you can submit a patch to the bug  
reporter and someone that has a Qt Commercial license can commit your  
patch to the cvs repository.

As always, I am NOT a lawyer, consult one if you feel you need more  
clarification. This is not legal advice.. don't hold me liable for  
anything, blah, blah blah..

No. He does not have to release it under the GPL if he is not 
deriving/writing Qt code (he can do if he wants). plugins which do not 
include Qt specific stuff do not have to be GPL

Renato,

You are correct, it should only load one iteration, not all at once.
Could you please try to load the geometry only (no scalars) and see
what happens.


Thanks
Jerry

Yes. I _meant_ Qt based plugins but the fingers forgot to type that  
part. I believe you are correct.

Subject: [Paraview] [Xdmf] ParaView/Xdmf bad memory usage

Hi Jerry,

We've made a memory track for one of the nodes (each node has 8 cores 
and 2GB/core = 16MB/node)

- Temporal collection (all time steps) of spatial collection. Just the 
geometry:
Mem:  16,342,696k total,  1,877,788k used, 14,464,908k free

-  Spatial collection  for the *latest time step*. Just the geometry:
Mem:  16,342,696k total,  2,256,284k used, 14,086,412k free,

- Spatial collection for the *latest time step*. Geometry plus results 
(velocity vector, pressure, temperature)
Mem:  16,342,696k total,  2,554,156k used, 13,788,540k free,

- Temporal collection (all time steps) of spatial collection. Geometry 
plus results (velocity vector, pressure, temperature)
Mem:  16,342,696k total,  3,550,232k used, 12,792,464k free. Not so bad, 
BUT, If I hit the button to skip to the next time step, the memory 
starts to disappear and the system hangs out. Catastrophically since our 
Altix-ICE nodes are diskless and when they run out of memory they simply 
shutdown freezing the ParaView section as well as (I'm afraid to 
say....) the whole machine. Yes, the entire computing nodes of our 
Altix-ICE system goes down because ParaView :o(. This case made us call 
SGI to understand how a system that should be robust has crashed so 
badly just because one application.

NOTE: I loaded and unloaded files in the same ParaView session.

This was the latest memory screen that we were able to get before 
freezing the system:
Mem:  16,342,696k total, 16,261,440k used,    81,256k free,        0k 
buffers
Swap:    49,144k total,    49,144k used,        0k free,    22,604k cached

Would you like the dataset to test? Do you have patience to download 
12GB? Maybe 2 time steps would be enough...

Regards

Renato.

Yes, it is annoyingly complicated. Here is my understanding of the whole thing:

* The binaries we are distributing are under GPL since I use the
GPL'ed version of Qt to make binaries (due to popular demand). We can
do this because we also freely distribute the ParaView source under a
compatible license.

* The source is distributed under BSD. This is OK because we use the
commercial version of Qt to develop it.

* It is OK for us to accept small code/patches developed with GPL'ed
version of Qt.

* You can build plugins that depend on only ParaView libraries and not
Qt under any license you want.

* You can distribute these plugins under any license you want.

* What happens when someone loads those plugins from the ParaView
binaries we distribute is not clear to me. However, there is no way
for this to have any impact on the license under which you distribute
your plugin. That would be like saying if I load a Windows codec in a
GPL'ed application, that codec becomes GPL'ed. I am sure Microsoft
would object to that :-)

* If you are developing plugins that depend on Qt, they either have to
be GPL'ed or you have to have a commercial Qt license.

In summary, I would

* not but a Qt license if I am distributing VTK/server manager only plugins
* buy a Qt license I am distributing plugins that include and link against Qt

One comment:

The GPL license says that you have to provide the source under GPL to
those you distribute binaries. If you are developing a
plugin/extension for in-house use using GPL'ed Qt, you do _not_ have
to distribute your source to the outside world. Trolltech has never
been clear on this issue. They say that if you are developing
commercial tools, you have to have the commercial license. This is
only true when it comes to distribution. It does not apply to in-house
tools.

Actually that was never clear to me in GPL in general. If I develop 
something for in-house use only then there is nobody to give my code to. 
But the code is potentially employed for commercial purposes (including 
generation of income) so it IS being used as a commercial tool, only not 
distributed.

<sigh/>

You are distributing the code to yourself. Make sure you distribute  
the source code to yourself to be in compliance with GPL.  ;-)

There is a common misconception here ... the GPL does not make any 
distinction between commercial / non-commercial usage.  The only thing 
that matters when you're dealing with the GPL is distribution: if you 
distribute your derived work (outside your company), you must do so 
using a GPL-compatible license.  If you don't distribute, you don't have 
to do anything.

Cheers,
Tim

Subject: [Paraview] OverView focus on OS X
Message-ID: <74CA2DF6-E90B-4487-9EC3-C6380708EC4E@cs.duke.edu>

Hey All,

I've been playing with the new OverView infovis app (ParaView CVS on  
OS X 10.5.5), and I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this:  
when the OverView.app is running, I can't get any other application to  
keep focus -- i.e. when I have OverView running, and I try to click on  
any other application window, that other app pops forward for a  
second, but then OverView is shoved back as the "top" application and  
I can't really do anything in any other program until I quit OverView.  
(ParaView runs normally, and OverView itself seems to be functioning  
fine.)

Any ideas how to stop this, or am I the only one seeing this strange  
behavior?

Thanks,
-Eric

What are you using for rendering? The system OpenGL or Mesa? If it is
Mesa, is it the very latest version? Also, what happens when you try
something simple on 2 processors? Can you get a stack trace?

Subject: [Paraview] problem starting the pvserver
Message-ID: <5d94b8ee0811060032tee122dapd27bae4cde49ac81@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

i managed to compile the paraview 3.4.0 in both a 64bit dual core machine
and a 32bit quad core machine.
having trouble starting the pvserver when linking 2 machines. Below are the
konsole lines..

*yewyong at frodo:~/installer/ParaView-3.4.0_build/bin>

everything looks good when there is no linking of 2 machines. (this is the
64bit dual core machine)
but,

i can't start the pvserver when involving 2 machines.
192.168.0.16 = 64bit dual core
192.168.0.10 = 32bit quad core

Anyone faced this before?
Thanks in advance for helping.

Hi Berk,

I'm using Mesa 6.5.3. It's not the latest one because it was the first 
that I got success in compiling on this machine. Regarding GL and GLUT, 
I'm setting everything to Mesa as you can see bellow:

 OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR               
/sw/shared/x86_64/Mesa/6.5.3/include                                           

 OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY                
/sw/shared/x86_64/Mesa/6.5.3/lib64/libGL.so                                    

 OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY               
/sw/shared/x86_64/Mesa/6.5.3/lib64/libGLU.so                                   

 OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR         
/sw/shared/x86_64/Mesa/6.5.3/include                                           

 OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR               
/sw/shared/x86_64/Mesa/6.5.3/include                                           

 OSMESA_LIBRARY                   
/sw/shared/x86_64/Mesa/6.5.3/lib64/libOSMesa.so                                


I've been successfully using PV in smaller cases running in 2, 4 and 8 
processors. In fact, It was my first attempt in a larger dataset.

There's something that could explain what is happening. I noted that 
when I load the Xdmf temporal collection the system runs out of memory 
(I've sent another message explaining it). It seems that there's 
something wrong with Xdmf memory allocation. I don't know... just a 
suspicious... . Jerry is taking a look.

I am a bit confused by your question.  Are you saying the first example works and the second does not?  I am also confused by what you are trying to set up.  Are you trying to run the server on one of your machines and the client on the other, or are you trying to run a parallel server using both machines?

In the second example, it looks like your OpenMPI install is messed up.  In the 4th line (1st error), it complains about not finding orted, which is a daemon that the OpenMPI version of mpirun uses to launch processes.  It does not look like pvserver is being run at all.

I cannot claim to have a lot of experience in setting up MPI installs, especially ones on heterogeneous nodes like you are setting up.  My advice would be to first make sure that you can launch a job "locally" on each machine, then try to launch a job only one the opposite computer (i.e. launch only on the 32 bit machine from the 64 bit machine and vice versa), and then finally launch a single job on both.

I think Ken is correct.  It would appear that you don't have your  
bash environment set up correctly.  You need to have in your .profile  
or .bashrc or .something that is read when OpenMPI launches your job,  
the path to the mpi bin directory.
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set to your OpenMPI lib directory.   
You can test that the PATH component is  set correctly for your type  
of login by running a command like:
ssh 192.168.0.16 which mpirun
The LD_LIBRARY_PATH will become obvious once your pvserver executable  
is actually launched.
(The man page for bash on your system should explain what order the  
dot files are read in for interactive and non interactive shells...)

At the very very end of this mail I'm pasting the show output of a  
very (very) old openmpi environment modules ...
Hope this helps,
-John.

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython -> extracting timesteps
Message-ID: <E8D9B14E-FF3B-4C1B-9E6E-AD658F4D3CF3@videotron.ca>

Good afternoon,

I've been playing with pvpython this week and I always have this issue  
when using the time steps :

tsteps    = reader.TimestepValues #No problem here
view.ViewTime = tsteps[i]		#Gives me an error :

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "post.py", line 73, in <module>
     view.ViewTime = tsteps[i]
   File "/data-cfd01/software/ParaView/src/build_Python2.5/Utilities/ 
VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", line 1514, in setProperty
     return self.SetPropertyWithName(propName, value)
   File "/data-cfd01/software/ParaView/src/build_Python2.5/Utilities/

VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", line 394, in SetData
     self.SMProperty.SetElement(i, self.ConvertValue(values[i]))
TypeError: a float is required


It's impossible to extract each number from the array  tsteps - any  
idea ?

Thanks !

Hi Pierre-Olivier,

If you look at the python examples on the wiki
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting
you'll notice there are two notations used for the extraction of a
timestep. One is the notation you used and another is

scene.StartTime = reader.TimestepValues.GetData()[0]

at around the bottom of the page. As far as I tried only the latter
works for the cvs head. Hope someone update the wiki and clarify it...

Message-ID: <f21f65590811062331s47547fageada23d3280cf11e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, everyone,

I often use Paraview for visualization of medical object geometry models
and do some filtering. But I noticed that Paraview does not offer many
parameters setup by user, like VTK filters. For example,
SmoothPolyDataFilter,
it can be used like
    vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter *smoother = vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter::New();
    smoother->SetInput(surface->GetOutput());

    smoother->SetRelaxationFactor(0.1);
    smoother->SetFeatureAngle(60);
    smoother->FeatureEdgeSmoothingOff();
    smoother->BoundarySmoothingOff();

    smoother->SetNumberOfIterations(50);
    smoother->SetConvergence(0);

Paraview 3.4.0 only display "Number of Iterations" and "Convergence" for
user to setup. This often does not provide good effect like the C++ one.

Another example is
vtkDecimatePro *decimate = vtkDecimatePro::New();
    decimate->SetInput(smoother->GetOutput());

    decimate->SplittingOff();
    decimate->SetErrorIsAbsolute(5);
    decimate->SetDegree(10);
    decimate->SetMaximumError(0.005);

    decimate->SetTargetReduction(0.8);
    decimate->PreserveTopologyOn();
    decimate->SetFeatureAngle(30);
    decimate->BoundaryVertexDeletionOff();


Corresponding filter in Paraview 3.4.0 only have following options to setup:
   Target Reduction, Preserve Topology, Feature Angle and BoundVertex
Deletion.

I know that too much options may confuse user. I wonder if there are some
setup to
use more options. Or should I revise ParaView source code to recompile a
binary one.

Thank you very much!

Best,
Fucang

Sorry for the confusion. i'll try to explain more on my situation.
the first example show that the pvserver is "launchable" when it only
involves one machine as the pvserver.
i could connect to it using any binary version of  paraview client from any
machine.

at the second example, i'm trying to run a parallel server using 2 machines.

added the mpi bin directory PATH in my bashrc file and came out with
following konsole lines:


> *yewyong at vrc1:~/installer/ParaView-3.4.0_build/bin> mpirun -hostfile
> ../../openmpi-1.2.8_build/etc/quadcore_frodo -np 6 ./pvserver

> connect() failed with errno=110*

then the machine just fails to give any response.
when pressed with "control c" the following shows:

 Any ideas what going on?

thanks,

Can you ssh to the other machine without a password? It looks like
that may be the problem... You probably have to setup a private/public
key pair.

You can of course modify the paraview source and recompile.
Specifically what you would do is edit the XML element that defines
the proxy for that filter in Servers/ServerManager/filter.xml in order
to add additional property definitions to let paraview expose those
missing filter methods.

An alternative way to do it is to write a plugin, consisting of a
small CMakeLists.txt file and a small XML file and recompile only
that. The XML file makes an alternative proxy for the same filter.

The benefit of the second option is quicker compile time and better
isolation of the modifications you are making to ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Strange instability
Message-ID: <49149120.8020607@lanl.gov>

I downloaded and installed paraview-3.4.0 for Mac 10.5+ and have been 
using it without issue for the past month.  However, today it has 
stopped loading datasets....

Here is an example of a dataset that fails.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <ImageData WholeExtent="0 8 0 8 0 0"   Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 0">
    <Piece Extent="0 8 0 8 0 0">
      <CellData Scalars="ID">
        <DataArray Name="ID" type="Int32" format="ascii">
1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 5 4 4 4 1 1 1 5 5 5 4 4 2 2 5 5 
5 5 5 3 2 2 2 5 5 5 3 3 2 2 2 2 5 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3
        </DataArray>
      </CellData>
    </Piece>
  </ImageData>
</VTKFile>

When I switch to the representation to "Surface" and the label to "ID" 
it crashes the application. Both 3D and 2D datasets of this type fail 
without error when I attempt to switch to "Surface" and "ID".

I deleted the previous paraview binary and installed a new one today 
without any success. I am guessing that there is a temporary file 
somewhere that I need to delete.

Thanks

Steve

p.s. I am new to debugging paraview issues and I did not find a search 
on the mailing list so I apologize in advance if this is a common 
problem with a common fix.

Try running with the -rc argument to prevent it from trying your
application preferences, or move .config/ParaView into a temp
directory.

Unless I remember it wrong, there is also a way of simply loading the
server manager xml instead of a plugin.

Sure enough, according to the paraview plugins wiki you don't even
need the CMakeLists.txt (and thus to compile). Just write the XML file
that defines your new proxy and use the plugin manager to load it.

cool,
Dave

Hi Fucang,

After you get this working, with our help, we should work together to
write a wiki page that describes how more filter parameters can be
exposed in ParaView. Last week, I had the idea of starting a series of
recipes pages for the ParaView community to share knowledge. This
would be a good start.

Message-ID: <97d9bd670811090856of7ca738wb05fcdc8f9785624@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I am in the process of compiling Paraview and run into some difficulties !

I have PV-3.4 up and running on my work station (Ubuntu) with out any
problems, however the issue is when using the MPI libraries,
here at work they use PGI compilers to compile MPICH2.

I am at the moment, compiling PV using gcc - in order to link against the
PGI compiled MPI library, I need to link a couple of extra libraries,
other than libmpich.so

Can you please tell me, where and how I need to add these extra libraries
into CMakeLists.txt in paraview?

Thanks,

Rakesh

ps: I have tried compiling MPICH using gcc and then compiling Paraview -
this works fine- but at work I need to be able to use the PGI compiled MPI
libs !

You may link as many libraries as you need. You don't need to edit the 
CMakeList.txt. What you need to do is add the MPI libraries while you are 
configuring with with ccmake. You'll find only two places to add libraries I 
believe they are MPI_LIBRARY and MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY. If you only want to link 
two libraries use these. Otherwise you can add as many as you need to either 
of these variables separated by semicolons.  The entries in my CMakeCache.txt 
look like this :

MPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.2.4-gcc/libmpi_cxx.so
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:STRING=/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.2.4-gcc/libmpi.so;/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.2.4-gcc/libopen-rte.so;/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.2.4-gcc/libopen-pal.so;/usr/lib64/libdl.so;/usr/lib64/libnsl.so;/usr/lib64/libutil.so;/usr/lib64/libm.so;/usr/lib64/libdl.so

Hi!

Hello Natalie,

I don't know if this will be helpful (since you already have all of  
those XMF files), but the standard way of doing the time animation  
with Xdmf and ParaView is to have all of the time steps in one XMF  
file as a "temporal collection". Each time step in the file could  
refer to a separate HDF5 file for its data. There are ways of enabling  
animation for a series of files using a time-unaware reader in  
ParaView, but I think it would be easier to write a script to combine  
all of your XMF files together into the time-aware format that is  
supported by Xdmf.

I'll put an example below.

Subject: [Paraview] Resample DataSet
Message-ID: <49188353.1010309@ara.co.uk>

Hi,

I'm trying to interpolate a pressure field from one grid to another and 
then compute the difference between the original pressure field and the 
interpolated one.
So if I have :
grid1, data1
grid2, data2

I want to
1. interpolate data1 onto grid2
2.  compute data2-data1

I try to use the Resample Dataset filter which seems to work for step 1, 
but then I no longer have access to data2! Am I doing something wrong , 
or do I need to code up the filter so that it copies the data associated 
with grid2 ?
If anyone has done something similar in the past  -- please help :) !

Jacques

Yes I am doing something similar. What does it mean 'no longer have

Subject: [Paraview] Lookmarks with sources in them?
Message-ID: <8D0773E2-EC8F-4141-BAC3-778BDF2BE67B@cora.nwra.com>

Has anyone figured out how to make a lookmark with a pipeline that  
contains
more than one source.
For example I have a number of movies to make with different data sets.
I have been able to make lookmarks so that I can load a pvd file,
and then view the lookmark, thus making the varies filters I need.
But if I add an Annotate Time source or a Text Source to my pipeline  
and then try to make a lookmark
it doesn't work. Either PV, crashes after applying the lookmark or I  
get the error:
"There are not enough existing sources or filters in the pipeline to  
accomodate this lookmark."

Any ideas?

Thanks...

Renato,

I believe I have found and fixed the problem.
Under certain conditions, only the first spatial collection
was being marked as being parallel so when you try to
access the second timestep, all nodes were trying to read
all the data ... and that's bad!!

I checked in a fix but am still testing. Check out the
new vtkXdmfReader.cxx and see if it works for you. I'll
try several other cases.

Subject: [Paraview] unexpected behavior w/ "Load State" command
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.0.82.0811101513100.906@thebes.cs.utah.edu>

I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if I'm just misusing the tools. Please 
advise.  To duplicate what I'm seeing:

(1) Start with a blank scene. Create a simple object (e.g. Sources -> 
Cone, and Apply).
(3) Save it as a .pvsm file (File -> Save State)
(4) Exit ParaView, and restart it.
(5) Create another simple object (e.g. Sources -> Disk, and Apply).
(6) On the Display tab, click "Set Solid Color" and pick a color for the 
disk.
(7) Restore the previous file (File -> Load State). The disk disappears. 
(8) No problem, we simply make the both objects visible by clicking the 
"eye" icon in the Pipeline Browser.

(9) Now for the unexpected part (for me, anyway): When the disk object 
reappears, it has lost its color, and is rendered about twice as large 
as before.

Is this how it's supposed to work?  Thank you for any insight you could 
offer!

Hi!

This might be a stupid question.. but I have now such a .xmf file with the temporal collection, but how do I play it? I load it into paraview, and then I press the "play" button above, but I can?t see anything moving..

thx,
NH

Hello Natalie,
I don't know if this will be helpful (since you already have all of those XMF files), but the standard way of doing the time animation with Xdmf and ParaView is to have all of the time steps in one XMF file as a "temporal collection". Each time step in the file could refer to a separate HDF5 file for its data. There are ways of enabling animation for a series of files using a time-unaware reader in ParaView, but I think it would be easier to write a script to combine all of your XMF files together into the time-aware format that is supported by Xdmf.
I'll put an example below.-Eric

Geoff,

When one sets up display properties from the Display tab, these 
properties apply to the way that data is shown in the current active 
view. When state file is loaded, all current views are destroyed and new 
views, as specified in the state file, are created and only those 
objects that were visible in the state file remain visible. Since new 
views are created (and old ones destroyed) all the changes you made to 
the Display tab are lost.

Actually, there's even talk of deleting all existing objects before 
loading state. If that's done then you'd even loose the disc source.

That should be all you need to do. Check if the Information tab of the
Object Inspector panel for the reader shows any time steps. If the
Time section, at the bottom of the page, has no index and value pairs
in it, then paraview doesn't recognize that the data is time varying.
If that is the case you might want to post you xmf file to the list
and perhaps someone can see what is wrong.

Hey Dan,

I also have trouble applying any lookmark which contains multiple  
sources. In my case I might have two data sets (unstructured grids)  
which are each glyphed differently. When I try to apply the lookmark,  
even to the same two data sets which have been loaded at a different  
time, ParaView lets me assign each source in the lookmark to one of  
the data sets but then crashes before it displays anything in the  
render window.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to track it any further yet, but  
I've been curious, too, whether anyone else has been able to get a  
multiple-source lookmark to work.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Geoff,

I just added a feature request for the color loss issue.  It's not specifically wrong, but I can see how it can be annoying.

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=8081

As with respect to the "large" disk, this is caused simply by the fact that the disk is larger than the cone.  ParaView resizes the window whenever an object is made visible when no other objects are made visible.  When you loaded the new state, the smaller cone was made visible first, which caused the window to resize to its bounds.  When the disk is made visible, it looks larger because the camera is zoomed in.  It would be really annoying to have the camera reset every time you made an object visible.  (Trust me, we tried it.)

-Ken

Hi,

Just a quick question, related somewhat to lookmarks. Is it possible to 
have only a camera position stored in a lookmark ? Also is it possible 
to save the scalar bar settings through a lookmark ?

Hi Dominik,

What I mean is that if I load :
grid1, data1
grid2, data2
and
interpolate data1 onto grid2
Then data2 is no longer in the list of variables (see attached picture),
and I can't use the calculator to do data2-data1

The calculator filter assumes the same number of points, whereas this is 
not the case. Note that x1-x2 is undefined if size(x1) != size(x2).
Better way to go is to compare bulk values e.g. integrated pressure over 
some distinc region or 2D intersection plots along some line.

The number of points should be the same since I interpolate the data 
from one grid onto the other grid first before doing the difference.

Subject: [Paraview] Lookmarks with sources in them?

Hey again,

In fact, I'm having trouble creating a lookmark with even a single  
source plus a glyph filter. When the lookmark is applied to a new data  
set, the source shows up in the Glyph Type combo box.

To reproduce:
Generate a point source with 100 pts, radius 10 (show pt on, pt 0,0,0).
Apply a sphere glyph (radius 1, no orient, scale mode none, scale  
factor 1, no mask or random).
Save a lookmark.
Disconnect to clear data.
Generate a new point source.
Apply lookmark.

The point source shows up in the Glyph Type box so the new data is  
10000 pts with a 100 pt source at each of the 100 pts. I've also seen  
it happen with my real data where the Glyph Type shows up as Xdmf  
Reader...

Let me know if anyone has any ideas,
-Eric

If you look at the vtkProbeFilter code, you can see that the source 
dataset (the geometry onto which you are sampling the input dataset), 
does not pass its scalars through the filter. I think that when it was 
written, it was assumed that probing of the data would occur onto some 
new geometry and the comparison you want to make wasn't imagined at the 
time. The original scalars are lost.

You should be able to add a PassData(blah blah) at the appropriate place 
in the probe filter code and the original scalars will appear alongside 
the new ones.

I would do this for you, but my version of the probe filter is modified 
somewhat and I don't want to mess about with the necessary 
merge/diff/conflicts.

If I have time later in the week (when I'm stuck on a train!) I'll have 
a go at it for you.

Message-ID: <97d9bd670811111305v62d03554ie6490f10e8f544a2@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I have PV-3.4 setup and running thanks to your help - I want to roll this
out to users and would like to set up the client/server connections using
some default settings - I found some xml in my
$HOME/.configure/paraview which describes the settings for server
connections.

Can some one tell me, how I can make this available system wide?  How can I
tell PV to look in some particular directory for client/server settings when
it starts up, so that all the user has to do is click on a particular
connection and connect to the server for necessary visualisation.

Thanks very much for your help in advance.

Rakesh

Apologies guys,

It looks like, it looks in one of the following 3 directories

   - ParaView executable directory
   - $HOME/.config/ParaView/
   - /usr/share/ParaView

Dear users,

Can we some how get around having to specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Qt, once we
have built paraview to get it up and running?

I remember vaguely being able to use -WI -rpath in make files to do some
thing similar, is there anyway to specify this within CMake when we build
Paraview?

yes, it is possible, there should be a cmake option, I dont recall 
exactly, something with RPATH in name.

Set the cmake option VTK_USE_RPATH to ON and then rebuild ParaView.

Ken, Utkarsh,

Thank you for your responses.  In reference to Utkarsh's comment near the 
end of his note: I think it would be a good idea to automatically 
delete existing objects before loading state, although I can see the logic 
of the current approach as well.  Maybe this could be toggled via a 
Preferences option?

ParaView resizes the window whenever an object is made visible when no other objects are made visible.  When you loaded the new state, the smaller cone was made visible first, which caused the window to resize to its bounds.  When the disk is made visible, it looks larger because the camera is zoomed in.  It would be really annoying to have the camera reset every time you made an object visible.  (Trust me, we tried it.)

Alternatively, you can use the programmable filter to merge arrays
from the output of the probe and the original dataset. Select both
datasets, apply programmable filter and use a script like:

i0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
i1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
o = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
o.GetPointData().AddArray(i0.GetPointData().GetArray("RTData"))
o.GetPointData().AddArray(i1.GetPointData().GetArray("Elevation"))

where the RTData and Elevation should be data1 and data2. Then you can
use the calculator. In the not so far future, you should be able to do
something like

output.PointData += inputs[0].PointData["RTData"] -
inputs[1].PointData["Elevation"]

in the programmable filter. We are working on it...

Hey Natalie,

I stripped your .xmf file down to two time steps and generated random  
data in two hdf5 files, and both ParaView 3.4 and CVS recognize this  
as a time series on my machine.

When cleaning up the .xmf file (that I had copied and pasted out of my  
mail viewer) it seemed like there were a mixture of different  
indentation characters. I don't know if that could do it -- maybe the  
xml parser doesn't deal with it well...?

Here is a link to a zip file with the three files I used so you can  
try it on your system:

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Transient Fluent Data
Message-ID: <B8DBEFF020CB436DB0911994BEA8256B@college.tcd.ie>

Hello,

I am trying to use Paraview to postprocess transient results from Fluent. I
am new to paraview and I have so far only used it for steady data with
little or no problems.

I am exporting the data as EnSight Case Gold files, and so Fluent writes a
case file(actually outputs as .encas but cam simply change to .case or when
opening choose files of *.*) along with .geo and other variable files. When
it is just a steady simulation ParaView reads the files with no problem
however when it is transient data it gives the following error.


ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx, line 389
vtkGenericEnSightReader (0DAE5380): Unable to open file:
C:\Workingfiles\motion\Anj\NewFolder\/C:\Workingfiles\motion\Anj\NewFolder\1
25_m-0001.geo


Warning: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx, line 390
vtkGenericEnSightReader (0DAE5380): Assuming binary file.


However the case still appears in the pipeline browser though no operations
can be carried out on it.


The only other option for transient data is to read in the data for each
time step. However paraview doesn't seem to link together the timesteps, is
there any way of forcing to link them.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Weird, it should work... I've already loaded transient geometries in PV 
in the past...

Have you tried to change the byte order (little/big endian)?

Cheers

I don't even get as far as choosing byte order, as soon as I try to open the
case file I get the errors. 
All I can tell from errors is it is having trouble reading the .geo file. 

If I export a single timestep from Fluent I am able to load it fine.

If I look at the .geo files it appears that the transient one is simply the
single timestep ones appended to each other with 'begin time step' and 'end
time step' between each.

Remove the absolute paths, put the case file in the same directory of 
the other files (geo, scl, vec, etc...) and try again.

By the way, your case file doesn't seem to be transient. It should have 
wildcards to specify file name patterns.

Here are some possible changes:

FORMAT
type:    ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model:    125_m-****.geo

3.00000e-002

Other possibilities:

1. Try loading just the geometry for the 1st time step (by hand editing 
your case files --> I guess Fluent does not know Ensight format so well...)
2. Try to load just the transient geometry before trying all the scalar 
and vector results
3. Finally, try to load the entire dataset.

# in Ensight format is considere a comment, so, you can put "#" to do 
the tests suggested above.

Subject: [Paraview] OSEHC 2009 Call for Demonstrations and Participation
Message-ID: <491B3C62.1080600@it-science-center.de>

Dear open source in health care developer/user,

please find below our call for demonstrations of the "Open Source in 
European Health Care
(OSEHC) 2009"  workshop. This gives you the opportunity to present your 
work or your use
case to an interested international audience, find new collaborators and 
potential users of your
software. By taking part in the workshop you may also actively influence 
the framework we
are trying to set up to pave the road for Open Source in European Health 
Care.
Although the focus is on Europe, submissions from non-Europeans are very 
welcome and
we are eager to learn from your experience and to find ways for future 
collaborations. We are
also interested in projects that are currently mainly focused on other 
regions or countries like
the USA or Canada to find a common ground where we can share work 
despite differences
in the health care systems.
You may find more information about the conference under the following 
link: http://www.biostec.org
Information about the OSEHC workshop is available here: 
http://www.biostec.org/OSEHC.html

Authors of accepted abstracts may profit from the early bird 
registration fee.
If your demo submission is accepted, please contact the HEALTHINF 
secretariat before registering.
Please help us in making the OSEHC workshop a high quality and 
successful event.
Hope to see you all in Porto in January 209.

Best wishes,
Thomas Karopka
OSEHC workshop chair

= Call for Demonstrations =

The Open Source in European Health Care Workshop (OSEHC) is calling for
submissions of demonstrations and use cases of open source software in 
health care.

Interested parties should submit a brief description of their proposed
demonstration via email to the workshop chairs until 1st of December 
2008.  Proposals should be 1 page in length at maximum,
include a title, description of system to be demonstrated, main results, 
novelty and significance of the work, any related publications,
estimated space requirements for the demonstration and whether internet 
access is needed. Please include the name, address,
email address, phone and fax numbers for all co-authors on the 
submmitted work.

Software may be presented live or via a poster explaining the software
and the background. Additionally you may submit a use case where an open 
source system or algorithm might be useful to resolve an existing
problem in health care. The demonstrations will take place in parallel 
with the poster sessions at the HealthInf 2009 conference.

Important dates:
Deadline for proposals:     1st of December 2008
Notification of authors:    10th of December 2008

Kind regards,
Thomas Karopka

I did as suggested

If I type paraview in my bin directory without turning on the VTK_USE_RPATH
flag - it complains that it can't find qt libs.
As you suggested, if I turn on the RPATH flag then I can run Paraview OK
from

/home/rakesh/Downloads/Kitware/ParaView-3.4.0/linux/bin

when I do make install, my libs are built under
/home/rakesh/MyLibraries/Kitware/Paraview/3.4.0

and then go into bin directory and run paraview, I get the following error
 error while loading shared libraries: libpqComponents.so: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory

Can some one please tell me what I am missing here?  I know I can add the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH - but for all sorts of reasons and conflicts with other
system libs,  I would prefer not to take this route.

Thanks,

Rakesh

I also notice that when "Load State" is invoked, the undo/redo stack is 
cleared.  Is that a result of the current views being destroyed? 
(mentioned by Utkarsh, below)

Hi Berk,

I am trying out your suggestion of merging arrays :

input0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
input1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
output.GetPointData().AddArray(input0.GetPointData().GetArray("pressure1"))
output.GetPointData().AddArray(input1.GetPointData().GetArray("pressure2"))

but I get the following error message :

  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 4, in RequestData
AttributeError: GetPointData

I also tried just using the programmable filter on one source and with the
following code, and  I get the same error :

input0=self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
input0.GetPointData()

I am using version 3.4.0

I have got a problem with very large data, bounding box is [0, 0, 0] [
15e18, 15e18, 15e18]

The Clip and Cutter filters (when created via the GUI) cause a seg fault.

ParaView itself is capable of cutting the data with the following Python
script

/cut.Input = reader
cut.Input = servermanager.OutputPort(reader, 0)

plane1 = servermanager.implicit_functions.Plane()
plane1.Normal = [1,0,0]
plane1.Origin = [7.5e18, 7.5e18, 7.5e18]
cut.CutFunction = plane1

view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
repCut = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(cut, view)/

If the same operation is done via the GUI, ParaView crashes immediately.
Are the developpers aware of that?

They are multi-block datasets from Ensight Reader.
Is there another way of dealing with this then ?

Programmable filter can still be made to work. Do the datasets have
multiple parts? I am not sure how resampling would work with multiple
parts. It is impossible to guess which parts map to which parts...

Here is what I am doing at the moment.
-Load geometry 1
-Extract wing block

-Load geometry 2
-Extract wing block

Then use the resample filter with wing1 as input and wing2 as source
(this works)

The last bit is missing (that is merging the data from wing2 with the
resampled data)

On loading state we purposefully clear the undo stack since loading 
state is a complex operation and undoing that is not possible.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkSelection
Message-ID: <491C3E73.3050808@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi,

I am trying to use the selection mechanism. Somethings are a bit unclear 
to me:


I would like to do something like is implemented in Paraview. In Point 
selection mode I would like to select all points in a rectangular area. 
In cell selection I would like to select all cells.

  1. I have figured out that I need to use the vtkAreaPicker and the 
vtkInteractorStyleRubberBandPick classes.

  2. It seems I then need to extract cells AND points with the 
vtkExtractSelectedFrustum object (vtkAreaPicker::GetFrustum()).

  3. Finally, I would need to either pass the points or the cells, 
depending on the mode. It seems vtkSelection can help at this stage. I 
still need to figure out how.


Is this approach correct? Is the main importance of vtkSelection to 
select cells or points in a unified generic way? Or is there another use 
for it? The description is quite difficult to understand.

Does anybody want to share an example doing something similar, or point 
me to the relevant code in paraview?

Thanks a lot

Bryn

Jacques,

Couple of ways to solve your problem:

* Solution One:
If you don't want to deal with the fact that your data is a 
vtkMultiblockDataSet, apply the "Merge Blocks" filter after each of the 
"Extract Block" filters and then connect to the "Programmable Filter" to 
to the output from the "Merge Blocks" and then your current script 
should work just fine. The "Merge Blocks" will convert the 
vtkMultiBlockDataSet to a vtkUnstructuredGrid on which your script is 
applicable.

* Solution Two:
input0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
input1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

input0Block0 = input0.GetBlock(0)
input1Block0 = input1.GetBlock(0)

output.CopyStructure(input0)
outputBlock0 = input0Block0.NewInstance()
outputBlock0.CopyStructure(input0Block0)
output.SetBlock(0, outputBlock0)

outputBlock0.GetPointData().AddArray(input0Block0.GetPointData().GetArray("pressure1"))
outputBlock0.GetPointData().AddArray(input1Block0.GetPointData().GetArray("pressure2"))

The above script will work if you are extracting a single block using 
the Extract Block filter. If you want to merge arrays for all the blocks 
in the input you'll have to iterate over the datasets in the 
vtkMultiblockDataset. Take a look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter#Dealing_with_Composite_Datasets

Hi David,

I?m trying to install the paraview bundle in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX but am not
having any luck. If  I set DESTDIR it just prepends that to
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX for the stuff the goes in lib,bin,... and trys to put
the bundle in DESTDIR/Applications. What I would like is to put the
paraview.app in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX along with the standard
lib/bin/include  setup. This is how Cmake.app gets installed. If I just try
to run ?make install? with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set, it trys  to put the
bundle in /Applications, which doesn?t seem right to me. Is there an easy
way to make everything get installed in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX?

Thanks,
Chris

Do you want to select the points/cells on the near (visible) surface
only? Or those and all the ones that are behind too?

You might not need to use AreaPicker. It's job is to pick entire
Props, you seem more interested in cells and points on a particular
prop. VisibleCellSelector can determine props on its own if you want
it to, and the FrustumExtractor could be reapplied to all the props in
the scene if you don't end up using AreaPicker to narrow down the
list.

The InteractorStyle is useful for giving the user a rubber band to
draw on the screen with, so you might as well use that part.
Converting that 2D rectangle into a 3D rectangle is only needed if you
are selecting through. The AreaPicker can help with that if you need
it.

That should work, assuming you are interested in selecting through.

Sorry about the description. Suggestions for improvement are always
welcome. You can also log in and edit the wiki page.

This is how I describe it:

vtkSelection is a way of generically identifying a subset of something else.
vtkExtractSelection is a filter that takes in a vtkDataSet and a
vtkSelection and produces the a new vtkDataSet containing only the
particular parts of the original dataset that correspond to the
selection.

Selecting through is easy, just make up a vtkSelection that knows the
frustum in 3D space you are interested in, and run it and the input
dataset through the extraction filter.

Selecting on is similar, you make up a vtkSelection that contains a
list of the cells or points you want taken out, and then run it and
the dataset through the extraction filter. The hard part about
selecting on is making up the list. That is where the
vtkVisibleCellSelector (and Utkarsh's new and improved class) helps.
They create the list by running the RenderWindow through a couple of
specialized render passes in the back buffer, and using the rendered
pixel colors to figure out that cells/points were drawn inside the
"selected" 2D rectangle on the window.

Take a look at TestExtraction first to investigate what Selections and
Extraction are and how to use them,

Then take a look at TestAreaSelections to see how to use them to grab
things that the user identifies behind the rubber band.

Thanks a lot Utkarsh !

It works. I was almost there, but I couldn't figure out a way to expose the
available interface for each object!
Where am I supposed to look to figure out that CopyStructure(), and
NewInstance(), SetBlock() etc ... are functions available ?

Kind regards,
Jacques Papper

There is probably a python way to get help more easily, but one way to
figure it out is to look at the VTK doxygen documentation for
vtkDataObject and it's subclasses, and realize that all (or almost
all) of the public C++ methods are wrapped into python and therefore
available to use.

cheers,
Dave

Indeed the VTK online doxygen is very useful. Is there any way in python of
getting the name of the class of the object I'm dealing with ? That way I
can find the class documentation in the Doxygen ?
Thanks again,
Jacques

I need to select through (i.e. non-visible). So I could use the 
AreaPicker to calculate the Frustum and pass it to the 
vtkExtractSelectedFrustum object in order to select the points or cells?

So vtkExtractSelectedFrustum knows the Frustum, how do I setup the 
vtkSelection object?

My guess is:

   selection->SetContentType(vtkSelection::FRUSTUM);
   if(mode==POINTS)
     selection->SetFieldType(vtkSelection::POINT);
   else
     selection->SetFieldType(vtkSelection::CELL);

But what about the SetSelectionList? Is this where I need to set the 
parameters of the Frustum (again)?, or will vtkExtractSelectedFrustum 
ignore this list, since it already knows the Frustum?

I have looked at these tests, and the java example 
Examples/Infovis/Java/Focus.java.

There are, however, many different combinations of 
vtkSelection::SetContentType, vtkSelection::SetFieldType and it is not 
clear how the SelectionList must be created for each situation, or if it 
must be set at all.


Thanks,

Bryn

Look carefully at TestExtraction.cxx, it sets up a selection of each
type in turn.
For instance:
  sel->Clear();
  ext->PreserveTopologyOff();
  sel->GetProperties()->Set(
    vtkSelection::CONTENT_TYPE(), vtkSelection::FRUSTUM);
  vtkDoubleArray *frustcorners = vtkDoubleArray::New();
  frustcorners->SetNumberOfComponents(4);
  frustcorners->SetNumberOfTuples(8);
  //a small frustum within the 3 lower left (-X,-Y) cells
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(0,  0.1, 0.1,  3.1, 0.0);
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(1,  0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0);
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(2,  0.1,  0.9,  3.1, 0.0);
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(3,  0.1,  0.9, 0.1, 0.0);
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(4,  0.9, 0.1,  3.1, 0.0);
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(5,  0.9, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0);
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(6,  0.9,  0.9,  3.1, 0.0);
  frustcorners->SetTuple4(7,  0.9,  0.9, 0.1, 0.0);
  sel->SetSelectionList(frustcorners);
  frustcorners->Delete();

I think you can get the points from AreaPicker::GetClipPoints().

Message-ID: <d0767b160811131607k7347111el939d5415654982ce@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I am kind of new to Paraview. Hope this question isn't a stupid one.
I can access to a shared-memory SGI Altix 4700 supercomputer. It has 6 GPUs
and 64 cpus. I have successfully installed the latest version of
paraview(3.4.0) on it.
To my understanding, if I ssh to the supercomputer and type the following
command, I can use one GPU to do the rendering job in the server end:
DISPLAY=:0.0 mpirun -np 1 ./pvserver
The problem comes if I want to use multiple GPUs to render a large data, say
Image data from CT(about 1G) in real-time. How can I do it? Do I need to
manually assgin other GPUs(:0.1, for instance) to cpus? On cluster, I know
it's not a problem coz each cpu has its own gpu.

I also have tried to use multiple CPUs at the server end, for example:
DISPLAY=:0.0 mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver
However, the rendering results aren't correct in this case. No matter what
data I opened, the rendering results were always some garbages(lots of dots
with different color).  The garbages appeared roughly where the data should
be. I have no idea about the reason for this. My client end is a windows
machine and the server is a linux supercomputer. Could that be a problem or
I simply can't use one GPU for multiple CPUs?

I have tried to get paraview work on the supercomputer for a very long time,
and I got really frustrated. Any of your help would be highly appreciated!

Subject: [Paraview] Display number of cells over time
Message-ID: <491D7F65.9090909@math.uni-dortmund.de>

Hi all,

I've got a time series of unstructured grid files. Besides the 
visualization of a scalar variable I would like to display some 
statistical data. In particular, I would like to display the number of 
elements over time (animation).

My problem is as follows: I failed to display the number of cells as 
data array. Surely, I "see" the number of cells (and nodes) in the 
Statistics View and the Information tab of the Object Inspector. As an 
intermediate solution I would like to display the number of elements as 
text field (cf. Annotate Time). Ideally, the numbers of elements for 
all(!) time steps are displayed as xy-plot (number of elements vs. time) 
which develops in time. That is, the first unstructured grid file leads 
to a single value #nel0 at time 0. The K-th unstructured grid file 
yields K values #nel0..#nelK at times 0..K

I tried paraview 3.4.0 official release and 3.5.0 top-of cvs build.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards
Matthias

I have tried via the Python interface. This works fine for me:

px = servermanager.ProxyManager()

view = servermanager.GetRenderView()

label = servermanager.sources.TextSource()

# here you must get the right data. I assumed "reader" was the source of
your data

label.Text = "# of cells: %d" %
reader.GetDataInformation().GetNumberOfCells()

labelRep = servermanager.filters.TextSourceRepresentation(Input=label)

view.Representations.append(labelRep)
view.StillRender()


getting the right handle on your dataset is left as an exercise, since
it is application dependent

Subject: [Paraview] problems with vtu format
Message-ID: <op.ukl7cwzrsllp63@laptop-dell.guest.ws.tn.tudelft.nl>

Hello everybody
I've been trying to write down a routine to export the results from my cfd  
code in paraview format
I've been able to work with vtk format but wher I try to write in vtu  
(xml) format paraview 3.4.0 read the file without giving any errors, the  
log shows a correct number of cells and points and a listing of all the  
variables but simply NOTHING appear in the workspace
The same behaviour appears both on win and linux machines

Can anyone help me guess what's wrong with this file?
what should appear is a simple cube made of hexaedrals with different  
dimensions (as a matter of fact they are clustered near the "walls")

As it's quite long (almost 1000 points) I won't stick it in this message,  
I'm trying to zip and attach it; if attachments are not allowed (it's not  
clear from the ML web page) I've uploaded it on rapidshare (max 10  
downloads allowed)
http://rs367.rapidshare.com/files/163719862/chan1_180.vtu
If not let me just know how to show this file...
Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <8e0b87a90811140831s10f47ff8v95615bc4db8ba4f4@mail.gmail.com>

In Paraview (any version),  is there a preset filter that appends
scalar attributes to form a vector attiribute?
If not how, if at all, can I write one using the programmable filter?

thanks,
Levent

Use the calculator filter.

For the expression:
scalar1*iHat + scalar2*jHat + scalar3*kHat

Hello,
I would like to know if it is possible to plot - with Paraview - such a

The first column is the x and the second is the y.

Could you help?

Thanks,

Yes.

Look at the first python source example on this wiki page:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.

You will have to adapt it to suit your format, changing it to skip
over lines starting with "%", using white space as a delimiter instead
of "," and to give each VTK coordinate an Z value of 0.0.

cheers,

I was able to achieve it using the Calculator filter and save my 
particular expression as a custom filter. This did not unfortunately 
work for transient data :(

Samuele,

You have to use CVS paraview. This feature is not available in 3.4.
With CVS ParaView, you should split the view and create a new XY plot 
view and then turn on the visibility for this reader in that view.

Hey Giovanni,

Based on a quick look at the file (with ParaView 3.4, OS X) it seems  
that all of the point coordinates that make up your cells are located  
at coordinate (0.16666667, 0.0, 0.2281278). So, you can only see  
anything if you change the representation to "Points", where you can  
see a single point. You can see that the data is in there if you do a  
"Cell Data to Point Data" filter and then glyph that with arrows. I'll  
attach a screenshot.

Hope this helps,
-Eric

Just a question about the cvs Paraview: I have followed this
installation guide:

What should I do, now?

I don't know!

Thanks for help,

3.5 means cvs or current development version. You must download and
build from source to get that. Follow the instructions on the paraview
download page for checking out the source.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem reading EnSight Gold binary file in ParaView3.2.1
Message-ID: <20081115060814.55491.qmail@f5mail-236-237.rediffmail.com>

I have written two C subroutines for writing EnSight Gold ASCII and
EnSight Gold Binary files for a simple 2D unstructured grid. I have
followed the procedure given in EnSight8.2 User manual for writing the
files.

The EnSight ASCII files works fine on both EnSight8.2 and
ParaView3.2.1. However the EnSight Gold binary files works fine only
on EnSight8.2 but fails to open on ParaView3.2.1. I have checked my
EnSight Gold binary file through the "ens_checker" program that comes
with EnSight for verifying the integrity of the EnSight Gold files.
The ens_checker shows that the files are written correctly and should
not have any problem.

Can some one please verify my EnSight files and the subroutines.

I have attached a .zip file for EnSight files. The output of
ens_checker program and my C subroutine which writes the files with
this mail.

Any help in this matter will be very helpful.
Thanks in advance.

Have you tried to change the byte order? I opened your binary files 
without any problem in PV 3.4.0.

Thank you both
that's exactely what happens when you cut&paste part of your code writing  
a new routine :(

I'd like to ask another thing, now that my parallel vtu format works

Is it possible to store different variables in different files?
above all: is it possible to store the mesh in files that are separated  
 from datas (like fluent does with cas and dat files)?

for example:
file #1: mesh with point coordinates and cell connectivity
file #2: velocity
file #3: pressure
file #4: temperature
... and so on?

thanks in advance

Subject: [Paraview] How to use Paraview to visualize large volume data
 in real-time on shared-memory supercomputer?
In-Reply-To: <d0767b160811131607k7347111el939d5415654982ce@mail.gmail.com>

Aaron,

You're on the right track.  In order to use ParaView on a shared memory
machine, you need to run pvserver with mpirun.  It might seem weird to use a
distributed memory program on a shared memory machine, but some basic tests
we have done suggest that it is actually a pretty efficient way of running
the program.

I think the rendering issues you are seeing are that all of the processes
are using the same GPU.  Not only is this inefficient, but the rendering
windows are probably stomping on each other's memory, giving you the invalid
results.

To launch multiple processes using different GPU's, you need to tell the
different processes to use different X windows displays.  That basically
means that you will need to instruct mpirun to run different commands for
different processes.  How you do this tends to be dependent on the MPI
implementation you are using, and each implementation often has multiple
ways to do it.  For our OpemMPI version of mpirun, I use something like
this:

mpirun -np 1 ./pvserver -display :0.0 : -np 1 ./pvserver -display :0.1

I don't know how to do it with MPICH, but I know there is a way to do it.

Matthias,

There is no direct way to do this.  This is the first time I have heard a
request like this.  However, I have thought of a way to do what you want
without writing any code.  It's a real hack and a bit painful, but it works.

First, run you data through the histogram filter.  Make the bin count be 1.
The variable you select does not matter except to get a count of either
points (for point variables) or cells (for cell variables).  The result
should be a histogram with exactly one bin.  The bin count will be equal to
either the number of points or the number of cells.

Now, open a spreadsheet view.  Change the attribute combo box to be "Cell
Data".  There should be one row.  Select that row, then choose the "Plot
Selection Over Time" filter.  Click the "Copy Active Selection" button and
Apply.  You should get the plot that you are looking for.

What do you mean did not work for transient data?  Do you mean that when you
change time steps the output of the calculator filter is not changing
appropriately?

Exactly - it was not time-aware and was not updating.

Hi everybody,
im using paraview to view and obtain some informations from points
cloud, obtained with LIDAR. These points cloud are non-structured data
in the form x,y,z,I. I is the reflectance value that the Laser Scanner
measured for every point. 
How can i view the proprieties of a selected point? I would like to view
x, y and z coordinates for a selected point.
Another question... is there a tool for measure the distance between two
selected points??

Thank you!

Are we talking about the calculator filter specifically or reading the
transient data in general?  I just use ParaView 3.4 to load a time varying
data set, added a calculator filter that turned scalars to vectors and ran
it through time.  The data updated just fine.

Could you give more specifics on your data?  If you could post your data,
that would be helpful.

I wonder up to what point what you are looking for is not closer to
Paraview-meshless than paraview ?

Hmmm. I checked again and it works now... But I am sure it did not some 
time back. So either I was screwing something with my own reader or the 
thing got fixed meanwhile. Sorry for a foggy conclusion.

I could read it into PV 3.4.0 without any problems. Make sure you use
"little endian" byte order. Regards.

Hello,
I toggled to ON the Build Doc item in the ccmake configuration but the doc has not been built and if I clic a question mark in the properties section, I get a message 'The page could not be found - file:///usr/local/ParaView-3.4.0/bin/Documentation/SurfaceVectors.html'. I have Doxygen installed and properly detected, DOCUMENTATION_HTML_HELP is ON. I do not have gnuplot but I suppose it is not required. So what is wrong?

Hello,
I would like to slice a 3D dataset with vector data attached to points but I would like to keep only the tangential part of the vectors, so as to compute streamlines lying on the plane then. If I use the slice tool, I can extract a place but with 3D vectors, which means that if I compute streamlines I get nothing because the is-in-domain test make the integration stooping immediatly (at least I suppose this is the reason). So I need to create a 2D vector field from a 3D one. Any advice?

Ok so I think I have succeeded with the following pipeline: bluntfin.vts -> Slice -> SurfaceVectors -> Glyph
which shows vectors colinear to the plane.
Now I have a problem with placing the seed points since my place has an arbitrary orientation so it is not easy to determine the line extrema coordinates to obtain a line contained in the plane. Is it a simple way to cope with this issue?

Hi,
You could try using the custom source streamtracer and use the plane as the
input. That will release streamlines form all the points in the plane.
If this is not what you want you can calculate points on your plane using
the normal vector coordinates and the center coordinates...

A simpler solution might be to change the seed type from Point Source to Line Source.  By default, the line should be embedded in the slice you created.

Good morning,

I'm experiencing some problems when building the latest cvs version :

[ 48%] Building CXX object VTK/Infovis/Testing/Cxx/CMakeFiles/ 
TestParallelRandomStatistics.dir/TestParallelRandomStatistics.o
...ParaView3/VTK/Infovis/Testing/Cxx/TestParallelRandomStatistics.cxx:

worst conversion for the first is better than the worst conversion for  
the second:

...

Any idea ?

Best regards,

Fred,
After you do a "make", try typing "make HTML_Documentation".

A few tips for using the point source to seed streamlines on a planar dataset:

* Set the radius of the seeds to 0
* Set the number of seeds to 1
* Use the 'p' button inside the 3D window to place the point on a
visible surface. Only works when the 3D widget is visible

For line source, you can use 'p' twice to place the two end points.

Unfortunately no. The EnSight format allows you to do that however.

CMake strips RPATH during installation. The only way to achieve what
you want without hacking CMake files is to copy your Qt libraries in
the same directory as ParaView libraries, something like
lib/paraview-3.4/

Message-ID: <1226943696.6448.3.camel@SamIam>

Dear friends,
I'd like to install the CVS...
I have tried to follow the "build and installation guide" @
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install but I've found
it impossible to install everything.
I have problem with Qt...

In fact I have Qt-4.3 instead of Qt-4.0...
Do you think that creating a symbolic link could be a good idea?

In this case, which is the symbolic link that I should create??? I mean,
which are the right files I need???

Thanks for help,
Samuele.

One simple way would be to change the file CMakeLists.txt like:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-July/008737.html

OR

to change that file to accept the version you mentioned.

Just a fast and pretty urgent question...
I've succeeded in compiling and generating the CVS Paraview.
Now I'm going to install is. Shoud I remove the old version, first???

Thanks a lot,

I have both paraview 3.4 and CVS version, of course in separate folders. I
think you should be able to install independently. When you are generating
the codes using cmake, you better use different folder. Then you can run
different versions simultaneously.

Hi,

I want to superpose two files, one with a wireframe representation and
the other with a surface rep. I want the wireframe to be in the
background and use the surface to cover up part of the wireframe. But
the wireframe always seems to show up. Any suggestions?

Thanks,

If I understood you correctly, you can't do what you want using the clip 
filter to remove the part of the data that is superposing the surface.

Hi,
I want to get the data of a XY-plot as a CVS file (results from a "Plot
Selection over Time"). 
"Save data" results in an empty file (only with the headers). The export
function is not possible. 
Is it a bug or a missing function? Or do I make something wrong? I use
ParaView 3.4.0.

I don't know if I totally understand what the question is (an image might help), but it sounds like parts of the wireframe object are coincident to the surface object (that is, they occupy the same space).  If so, chances are you are getting z-fighting; you probably see parts of the wireframe hidden and parts showing through.

There is no easy answer to this problem.  If you are only going to be viewing the object from a certain direction, you can use a transform to shift the wireframe slightly away from the viewer (or equivalently shift the surface toward the viewer).

I guess the transform filter is an easy option. I am attaching the
desired result I obtained from PV in Mac OS X. (version 3.4). However
the linux binary version did not work for me. In the linux version of
PV, the wireframe behind the colored plot is no longer hidden and
comes to the forefront.

Thanks for the transform option though, it will probably work.

Subject: [Paraview] Extension from Plugin-Reader does not apper - QT 4.4
	issue?
Message-ID: <4923D4B0.8080302@web.de>

Hi,

I want to write a Reader for Paraview (I guess a plugin is better than
directly
hacking into the Paraview source).

As I have to base on an vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm I cloned the
vtkGAMBITReader
as it was the shortest (Only change of name, no functionality yet).
I follwed the Plugin-HowTO and with the help of the XML files
in the examples section and was able to compile a plugin. The
extension I use is .h5
(but we do not want to use the HDF5 reader but our own stuff).
SYSTEM_HDF5 is disabled.

When I load the Plugin no .h5 extension appears in the file open dialog.

I have several (starters) questions:

* Shall the extension appear there?
* I use OpenSuse 11.0 64bit with QT 4.4 - Paraview compiles nice after
commenting
  the WARNING() in the cmake file.
  - Can this be the reason for the problem?
  - What actually is the QT 4.4 issue? It compiles ...
* When I load a plugin again, is it reloaded?
* Is vtkGAMBITReader a good start? I found no appropriate extension in
file open.

I just started with the mailing list and did not find something
appropriate yet.

Thanks a lot,

Fabian

P.S.: I have no experience with ParaView yet (we have first to read
our data :))

Please note that I've just uploaded the accompanying animations. they 
are rather large, clocking in almost 200MB (which is why I didn't 
previously put them on the wiki). The upload is still progressing as I 
type this email, so alternative links from my own ftp are here
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/IEEE2008/TimeAnimations.zip
(125MB, main animations for ppt)

and
Francis turbine particle tracing example, thanks to VaTech Hydro for the 
large dataset and for permitting the distribution of the video
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/cti/CTI-II-Francis-Turbine-Video-small.avi 
(60MB)
The same animation at higher quality encoding is here (250MB)
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/cti/CTI-II-Francis-Turbine-Video.avi

I generally use the Xvid codec, so you should have this installed to 
view most of the avi files.

There are not quite enough details here to say exactly what your problem might be.  Rather, I will try to answer your specific questions.

* The extension(s) you specify in the Reader tag of your GUI_RESOURCE_FILES (along with the file description) should show up in the file types combo box of the open file dialog.  Your extension will be at the bottom.  Repeats are OK (with caveats), so the extensions should show up regardless).
* I don't think there is anything wrong with your configuration so long as you are building ParaView and the plugin with the same configuration.
* I'm not sure what happens when you "reload" a plugin.  However, I just realized that I accidentally set up one of my reader plugins to be loaded into my ParaView twice on startup for about a week now, and it has worked fine.  In any case, if your plugin is properly loaded, it will show up in the Manage Plugins/Extensions dialog box.  If it is there, there should be no reason to need to load it again.
* I'm not familiar with the vtkGAMBITReader or the details of your format, it it sounds like a good enough place to start.  In any case, the choice should have no impact on whether you see the reader in the plugin show up in ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Extension from Plugin-Reader does not apper - QT 4.4 issue?

Hi,

I want to write a Reader for Paraview (I guess a plugin is better than
directly
hacking into the Paraview source).

As I have to base on an vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm I cloned the
vtkGAMBITReader
as it was the shortest (Only change of name, no functionality yet).
I follwed the Plugin-HowTO and with the help of the XML files
in the examples section and was able to compile a plugin. The
extension I use is .h5
(but we do not want to use the HDF5 reader but our own stuff).
SYSTEM_HDF5 is disabled.

When I load the Plugin no .h5 extension appears in the file open dialog.

I have several (starters) questions:

* Shall the extension appear there?
* I use OpenSuse 11.0 64bit with QT 4.4 - Paraview compiles nice after
commenting
  the WARNING() in the cmake file.
  - Can this be the reason for the problem?
  - What actually is the QT 4.4 issue? It compiles ...
* When I load a plugin again, is it reloaded?
* Is vtkGAMBITReader a good start? I found no appropriate extension in
file open.

I just started with the mailing list and did not find something
appropriate yet.

Thanks a lot,

Fabian

P.S.: I have no experience with ParaView yet (we have first to read
our data :))

Hello,

I am looking for a way to save a proxy properties and 
restore it later.
The only way I found is by saving and restoring the state 
using:
virtual vtkPVXMLElement* SaveState(vtkPVXMLElement* root);
virtual int LoadState(vtkPVXMLElement* element, 
vtkSMStateLoaderBase* loader);

I don't want to use LoadState because this method create a 
new proxy. I just want to restore all properties to the 
existing proxy.
There is also a method called Copy (void Copy(vtkSMProxy* 
src), this method will copy all src properties to another 
proxy:

//copying properties to tempProxy
tempProxy->Copy(src0,vtkSMProxy::COPY_PROXY_PROPERTY_VALUES_BY_CLONING);

I tried to change some display properties in Paraview and 
then restore using:
src->Copy(tempProxy0,vtkSMProxy::COPY_PROXY_PROPERTY_VALUES_BY_CLONING);
src->UpdateVTKObjects();

but nothing is restored ! why? Is there any other way to 
do that?
(suppose that I have only on source)

Thank you

Thanks, worked perfectly.
A last question.
1-How could I integrate the pressure in the span direction and plot it 
vs the x-coordinate or arc-length (z=span direction)?
2-The circle is a slice of the extracted cylindrical surface. How can I 
plot pressure vs x or the arc-length?
When I try, the only choice is "line source." In other words, I want 
something similar to plot over line but line being the arc-length.
Thanks,
Stephen

Nehme,

What properties are you changing/trying to restore? Is "tempProxy" of 
the same type as "src"?

A last question.
1-How could I integrate the pressure in the span direction and plot it
vs the x-coordinate or arc-length (z=span direction)?
2-The circle in the attached figure is a z-slice of the extracted 
cylindrical surface for the pressure. How can I
plot pressure vs x or the arc-length?
When I try, the only choice is "line source." In other words, I want
something similar to plot over line but line being the arc-length.

tempProxy is just a proxy I created using:
vtkSMProxy tempProxy = vtkSMProxy::New();

I am trying to save/restore all the object properties 
displayed in the object inspector.

Actually, you don't need to do that to extract the interior cylinder (see next
answer)

> 2-How do I extract the cylinder surface?

Just combine the "extract surfaces" and " clip" filters.

I hope it helps you.

Here's one way of doing it:

vtkSMProxyManager* pxm = vtkSMObject::GetProxyManager();
vtkSMProxy *tempProxy = pxm->NewProxy(
   src->GetXMLGroup(),
   src->GetXMLName());
tempProxy->Copy(src);

....
src->Copy(tempProxy);

Thank you Utkarsh !

it works but I have some problems like:
- after restoring the proxy, changing some display 
properties in Paraview has no effect (like color ...)
- only the display properties are saved/restored. 
(variables in object inspector "properties" tab are not 
restored)

It's probably the way that I'm casting the source proxy 
and some staff like that.

I'll try to solve these problems and let you know.

thank you !

Hello,

I'm also facing a related problem when I save/restore vtkSMProxy's. The 
proxy ID is stored in the XML file. So when I reload the proxies, the 
StateLoader attempts to recreate the proxy with the same ID as before. 
But because I'm running a new ParaView session, sometimes the saved ID 
has already been reserved by another object in the current session, 
causing a collision.

When this happens, ParaView aborts inside the function:
vtkClientServerInterpreter::ProcessCommandAssign(const vtkClientServerStream& css, int midx)
The error message is "Attempt to assign existing ID".

Has anyone else ever dealt with this before?  Is there a known workaround? 
Am I completely off base?

Thank you!
--Geoff

Subject: [Paraview] PVPython where is PiecewiseFunction
Message-ID: <1227114860.18934.11.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I'm trying to make a ParaView python script to do some volume rendering.

I can load my data, set the representation to volume rendering, and set
the color scale the way I want, but I can't figure out how to set the
opacity.

I found rep.ScalarOpacityFunction, but what do I set it to?

I created a simple ParaView session with a volume rendering. Poking
around there I found that there is a PiecewiseFunction that I think is
created.

How do I make a PiecewiseFunction?

What state loader are you using? If you use vtkSMPQStateLoader or 
subclass it should not try to reassing IDs.

I'm using vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader, which is the state loader used by 
pqUndoStack.  My proxies are encapsulated within vtkUndoSet objects when 
they are saved/restored.

UndoRedo states are not meant to loaded across different sessions. If 
loaded in the same session such ID conflicts should not occur.

For saving the object inspector properties you'll have to save/restore 
the state for the source proxy (and not merely it's representation proxy).

Hi again,

I did save and restore the source proxy and 
representations and it's working.
All display properties are saved/restored perfectly, but 
after restoring, changing "color" or "Style" properties 
from the object inspector has no effect. Other properties 
like "visible" or "Transformation" works !

after restoring I called:
vtkSMObject::GetProxyManager()->UpdateRegisteredProxiesInOrder();

but it didn't solve the problem.

Ah I think I know the problem. vtkSMProxy::Copy() copies all properties 
even those on the sub proxies. A representation is a complex beast with 
several internal subproxies which are linked up internally. You actually 
  simply want to save/restore the exposed properties so I'd do something 
like follows:

void Copy(vtkSMProxy* src, vtkSMProxy* dest)
{
vtkSMPropertyIterator* iter = dest->NewPropertyIterator();
for (iter->Begin(); !iter->IsAtEnd(); iter->Next())
   {
   vtkSMProperty* destProp = iter->GetProperty();
   vtkSMProperty* srcProp = src->GetProperty(iter->GetKey());
   if (destProp && srcProp)
     {
     destProp->Copy(srcProp);
     }
   }
iter->Delete();
}

Use the above Copy instead of vtkSMProxy::Copy().

thanks for your help.

I found that if i compile Qt with "-release" option, and then compile
pv-3.4.0 as normal, I don't need to add qt libs to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

All,
    I have an application which requires the vtkGaussianSplatter 
filter.  I'm assuming I will need to write a plugin for Paraview to add 
this VTK filter, is this correct?

Thanks in advance,

John

Yes, but the plugin in this case consists only of the XML file which
defines the proxy that tells ParaView about the filter.
Write that and then load it with via the plugin manager dialog.

cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Saving one data array into one file
Message-ID: <20a72bf00811191724h72f51311q9c75cc8a94393c6e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have an image data that has been generated with multiple data arrays
based on the 'Append Attributes' filter.  e.g., a data array a is
generated by b+c.  When saving this sort of data, all the arrays
contained (e.g., arrays a, b, and c) are saved into one file.  I'd
like to know how to save just one array (e.g., array a) into one file.

I'd appreciate any comments.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] need help to compile on opensolaris
Message-ID: <49253665.5060800@cmi.univ-mrs.fr>

hello all,
i'm trying to compile paraview-3.4.0, and compile failed here:

"/export/home/henry/projects/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx", 

line 267: Error: The function "glXGetProcAddressARB" must have a prototype.
"/export/home/henry/projects/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx", 

line 267: Error: Using static_cast to convert from int to extern "C"
void(*)() not allowed.

what i see is that vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx contains:
return
static_cast<vtkOpenGLExtensionManagerFunctionPointer>(glXGetProcAddressARB(reinterpret_cast<const 

GLubyte *>(fname)));

and my GL/glx.h contains:
typedef void (*__GLXextFuncPtr)(void);
extern __GLXextFuncPtr glXGetProcAddressARB (const GLubyte *);

i suppose the problem is that compiler considers the above declaration 
different?
I'm not a C++ dev, i just need to compile paraview. If someone can help,

thanks in advance,

gerard

Subject: [Paraview] plot over line
Message-ID: <49253C18.3020802@sophia.inria.fr>

How does one "plot over line" if the line is curved in x,y,z?
I would like to plot pressure over a curved line in a x-y plane.

I tried:
1-using the calculator to compute the arc length but the plot options 
remain lines in x or y or z (no arc length is added).
2-I tried exporting, I get the x,y, z coordinates to process outside of 
PV but the pressure does not get written.
Any ideas?
Stephen

Subject: [Paraview] filter for xdmf-file
Message-ID: <BAY122-W2061BB3948AA5F85C27F85BC0C0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
 
Since I?m working now with xdmf-files I need to make my filter work with it too ;-) 
I have noticed that a few filters which using vtk-functions work with the xdmf file as well, so I started off making my filter as a subclass of vtkDataSetAlgorithm. 
If the input is a rectilinear grid, I cast the input to it and it works fine, the key here is that I have the function vtkRectilinearGrid::GetDimensions(int data[3]).
I need something similar for my xdmf file, is there any function I can use to get the dimensions of my datafile? as the dimensions are specified in the .xmf as well as in the .h5 file, there must be something to get it.. (at least I hope so). 
 
thx for advice,
Natalie Happenhofer

I am curious why you need to work at the xdmf level? The purpose of
the reader is to read the data written in the particular file format
off of the disk and fill in VTK's internal data structures. After the
reader, no filter needs to know that the file was initially in xdmf
format.

Subject: [Paraview] Why does this programmable source not work outside the
	paraview GUI
Message-ID: <45a794ec-40cd-41f4-af1b-4b67d04c7c8a@hmc-hub02.he.businessgateway.co.za>

Hi All,

 

Why does this piece of code containing a programmable source not work
OUTSIDE the paraview GUI?

 

a) When the source is changed to ConeSource() it works (see Label 1 in the
code below).

 

b) Also when the Script content is pasted inside the paraview GUI scripting
editor, it does work - so the script contents itself is ok.

 

When the code is run directly from a python command line only an empty
graphis window is displayed - as if the script part is faulty.

 

Thanks in advance,

Louis

 

HERE IS THE EXAMPLE:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

from paraview import servermanager

connection = servermanager.Connect()

pgsrc=servermanager.sources.ProgrammableSource()

 

 

pgsrc.GetProperty("Script").SetElement(0, """

 

import vtk

pts=vtk.vtkPoints() 

pts.Initialize()

pts.InsertNextPoint(0,0,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(1,0,.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(2,1,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(3,3,0.)

 

cel=vtk.vtkCellArray() 

cel.Initialize()

cel.InsertNextCell(4) # number of points

cel.InsertCellPoint(0)

cel.InsertCellPoint(1)

cel.InsertCellPoint(2)

cel.InsertCellPoint(3)

 

output = self.GetOutput()

output.SetPoints(pts)

output.SetStrips(cel)

 

""")

 

 

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

 

# This programmable source pgsrc does not display

rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(pgsrc,view)

 

# Label 1: This source do display

#coneSource = servermanager.sources.ConeSource()

#rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(coneSource,view)

 

 

view.StillRender()

view.ResetCamera()

view.StillRender()

Message-ID: <b318c3fd0811200816i2849c03ctef6a340b5cde736b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm having some problem with Paraview.
I have a bubble growing and detaching from a surface...it is a very
simple problem, I can plot the surface of the bubble making a contour
filter where is constant the value of the phase...in this way I can
see the shape of the bubble...
What I'd like to do is to plot the value of some parameter (as the
pressure of the temperature) along this contour.
I'd like to do something like the filter command "Plot Over Line" but
the problem is that I don't have a line but a contour of a bubble whit
a shape that changes during the growth.

Thanks a lot!

Sergio

Hey Everyone

I first off would like to say that I am not an engineer but have always been
fascinated with CFD's with respect to airflow around aircraft. I just
downloaded Paraview and finding tutorials on how to build and run a
simulation is very difficult. I did manage to start and connect to the
localhost server ie. my computer. But I can not figure out how to start a
simulation with streamlines around a simple sphere constructed using the
sources menu. and I am not sure exactly how to construct and aircraft or
even a wing in paraview. I know that you can import many datatypes but I do
not recognize any of them because I am so new to this.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Are you trying to use paraview to generate a geometry and run a CFD
simulation on it?  I'm afraid paraview is a visualization package, not
a CFD package.  If you're looking for a CFD package you could try
OpenFoam as it is open source, or you could roll your own if you've
got lots of time.

Peter.

Hello,

ParaView isn't really meant to make simulations. Its purpose is to
display and analyze the results of simulations produced by some other
computational package.

If anyone on  the list can recommend some open tools that are good for
learning about CFD computation, please chime in.

cheers,

That's what I was beginning to suspect. I have looked into OpenFoam but have
had trouble because I am on a Vista 32 machine and know very little about
linux, I tried Cygwin as well as andLinux but I do not know linux command
structure well enough to be effective at any level.

I am surprised at how many open source CFD's programs like Open Foam are
linux based but on some level it is not surprising considering how much
hassle windows is....maybe its time to partition and install linux?

Thank you very much for the help.

Hello,

Instead of saving a copy of a proxy, I'm trying to use 
lookMarkModel state to get the exposed properties and 
restore it to servermanager proxies.
I'm trying to do something like that:

vtkSMProxyManager* pxm = vtkSMObject::GetProxyManager();
vtkSMProxy *smProxy;

1- convert the stored lookmark state from a qstring to a 
vtkPVXMLElement:

   vtkPVXMLParser *parser = vtkPVXMLParser::New();
   parser->Parse(lookMarkState.toAscii().data());
   vtkPVXMLElement *stateElement = 
parser->GetRootElement();
   if(!stateElement)
     {
     qDebug() << "Could not parse lookmark's state.";
     parser->Delete();
     return;
     }

2- now from this state I want to copy the exposed 
properties:
for (?? xmlProxy in stateElement ??)
{
   smProxy = pxm->GetProxy(??xmlProxy groupeName??, 
??xmlProxyName??);
   vtkSMPropertyIterator* iter = 
smProxy->NewPropertyIterator();

   for(iter->Begin(); !iter->IsAtEnd(); iter->Next())
   {
     vtkSMProperty* smProp = iter->GetProperty();
     vtkSMProperty* xmlProp = 
??xmlProxy->GetProperty(iter->GetKey())from??
     if (destProp && srcProp)
{
destProp->Copy(srcProp);
}
    }
    iter->Delete();
  }

how can I do that ?

thanks !

Hi, Paraview group:

I created a cylinder in PV.  I need to move it to a new location.  But, default only has 2 decimal places, but, I need it to be precise to 3 decimal places.  Is there a way to achieve this?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <e7ddbec60811210220w6d2ff4f7y97be6e72370a2808@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to select a single point, change its 3D coordinates and
re-render it?
We are building 3D maps by hand and sometimes the coordinates of
points go awry so we need to adjust them.

What I am hoping to do is to convert our files to vtp files, feed them
into ParaView and then hand edit any points that are wrong. The point
here is that ParaView is really good at visualisation so any errors
are readily apparent.

Thanks for any information,
Andrew

Subject: [Paraview] Got programmable filter to work outside PV GUI - but
	still not programmable source
Message-ID: <c0181552-11ac-4826-bbed-7f810738c778@hmc-hub01.he.businessgateway.co.za>

Hi 

 

I got programmable filter to work outside the paraview GUI - but still not
the programmable source; See the example below - if you want to try out the
programmable source, just set ptr = pgsrc instead of ptr = pgflt - see
below.

 

I am still puzzled why the programmable source does not work. It works
within the paraview GUI - but not outside. To see how it works within the
paraview GUI do the following:

Open paraview

Create a programmable source

Copy the script part below into the GUI editor

Click apply

.

 

 

Regards,

Louis

 

 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

 

from paraview import servermanager

connection = servermanager.Connect()

#

pgsrc = servermanager.sources.ProgrammableSource()

pgflt = servermanager.filters.ProgrammableFilter()

#

#ptr = pgsrc

ptr = pgflt

#

ptr.GetProperty("Script").SetElement(0, """

import vtk

pts=vtk.vtkPoints() 

pts.Initialize()

pts.InsertNextPoint(0,0,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(1,0,.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(2,1,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(3,3,0.)

 

cel=vtk.vtkCellArray() 

cel.Initialize()

cel.InsertNextCell(4) # number of points

cel.InsertCellPoint(0)

cel.InsertCellPoint(1)

cel.InsertCellPoint(2)

cel.InsertCellPoint(3)

 

output = self.GetOutput()

output.SetPoints(pts)

output.SetStrips(cel)

""")

 

pgflt.Input = pgsrc

 

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(ptr,view)

 

view.StillRender()

view.ResetCamera()

view.StillRender()

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.4 cross-compilation (Cray XT4) :  pvserver
Message-ID: <4926C128.9050501@nag.co.uk>

Dear all,
I have cross compiled Paraview 3.4 on a Cay XT4 machine following mostly 
the instructions on page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Compiling_ParaView3_for_Cray_supercomputers
Firstly I tested pvbatch using the coloredSphere.py I found on the page 
above , which seems to have worked fine.

I have also installed on the login node the paraview GUI and I was 
trying to set up paraview and pvserver to work together.
It seems though that pvserver that runs on the computed nodes is trying 
to open IP sockets to establish communication with the login node.
CNL (the operating system on the compute node) supports sockets but  is 
not configured  to open  ports (while opening a port on the computing 
node from a server  running on the login node is possible)
Is there any way round this as far as the configuration of pvserver is 
concerned?

Thanks

Not automatically. You could do it with a lot of effort via selection
and the programmable filter and the spreadsheet view.

The process would be:

Split the view top to bottom and make a spreadsheet view. Show the
data's selected point values in the spreadsheet view.

Insert a programmable filter, make it shallow copy through the point
and cell associated attribute data.

Split the 3D view again, now right to left, and make the original data
visible in one view and the filter's output in the other. Link the
cameras.

Select a vertex in the original. It's index and coordinates will be
shown in the spreadsheet view.

At a line to the end of the python filters program and change that
particular point's coordinates in the output data.

Repeat the last two steps, adding to the program each time.

Message-ID: <97d9bd670811210704g39c5d948p24de5ef506911cb2@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to use the default_server.pvsc file to load up profiles,
which are site specifi rather than user specific - as explained in the
wiki page, this can be done by adding default_server.pvsc file to the
bin directory.  I got this to work without any problem.

However, duing compilation, I specified an INSTALL_PREFIX, if I now
copy the above file to this bin directory (this gets created when
doing make install), paraview loads up ok, but it shows nothing in the
server dialog box.  It looks like, I need to copy some more files
across. Does anyone know which files its looking for?

Can some one please give me some pointers on how to solve this problem?

Thanks,
Rakesh

ps : I am running PV-3.4.0 on Linux

References: <E010DA68-0014-4040-A12E-57728904823D@cs.duke.edu>
Message-ID: <4AE5C330-00FD-43D8-83B2-CCE3BF214CF4@cs.duke.edu>

Hey,

Sorry for the long email, but I find this problem difficult to  
describe succinctly...

In February I was trying to use multiple Temporal Shift Scale filters  
as input to a Python Programmable Filter to do on-the-fly point  
velocity calculations (for diffusing particles in my simulation  
output). There were troubles with the pipeline updating properly, and  
Ken Moreland came up with a nice self-contained test case and filed  
the bug 6307:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6307

which was listed in August as "fixed" because the test case seemed to  
work now. But, I don't think this is really resolved yet.

If you load in the TimeShiftTest2.pvsm state file, the animation seems  
to play correctly, but I think that's a red herring. If you turn off  
the visibility of the TemporalShiftScale filters, you can see that no  
boxes move until after t=1.0, whereas if the temporal filters are  
turned on, and the group filter is turned off, one box moves and then  
the other.

I don't know if this helps, but if you look at the Output printed by  
the Python filter in TimeShiftTest1.pvsm, you can see that the  
temporal data sets have the correct time, but the ImageData within  
them doesn't match.
......

All of this is much more clear to me when I load in a simple data set  
with one point moving in time (attached Xdmf data set -- I'll also  
attach a link to a state file which sets this pipeline up, but you'll  
have to change the path for the data file in the state file manually  
if you want to use it).

The pipeline is: Load data. Add a Temporal Shift Scale with (post)  
shift=0. Add another TSS off the original data set with (post) shift =  
1. Highlight both TSSs and route into a Python Programmable Filter  
with Unstructured Grid output and this script:

in0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
ds0 = in0.GetTimeStep(0)
in1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
ds1 = in1.GetTimeStep(0)
print 'in1 t = %.1f' % in1.GetInformation().Get(in1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
print 'ds1 t = %.1f' % ds1.GetInformation().Get(ds1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
print 'in0 t = %.1f' % in0.GetInformation().Get(in0.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
print 'ds0 t = %.1f' % ds0.GetInformation().Get(ds0.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
out1 = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
out1.ShallowCopy(ds0)
print 'out1 t = %.1f' %  
out1.GetInformation().Get(out1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)

When I animate this (PV CVS or 3.4, OS X 10.5.5), with the TSSs on and  
the PPF off, I see the expected: two points, one following the other.  
When the TSSs are off and the PPF is on, only one point shows up.  
Also, the behavior is different if the animation is stepped backwards  
rather than forwards. And, the printed Output times from the PPF show  
one of the ImageData sets time doesn't match its temporal host.

As in Ken's example, this works very similarly with a Group filter in  
place of the PPF.

This still seems very confusing, and I hope someone will have some clue!

Thanks,
-Eric

Pei,
Are you running ParaView 3.4?  I can put in more than 2 decimal places in the cylinder center.  Another way to place the cylinder in another location is to use the transform filter.  It also will allow any number of decimal places.

This has already been fixed on the trunk.  Thus, you should see the fix in the next version of ParaView, which will probably be coming out this winter.

Hello,
I've a data ( velocity fields, x,y,z for each node )from the simulation and i need to load it in paraview to visulaise the flow field. i converted the data as .csv from excel  and when i read it from paraview, i am not able to load the data , getting an error. It just reads the first column only (xvelocity). I am not sure is there a specific way to load the data. It would be a great help  if any one could suggest me. 

Thanks

What is the error you are getting? What version of ParaView are you using?

Hi!
I?m writing a new filter called vtkDataCalculator, which should add/subtract/multiply/ divide the point data arrays of two datasets. 
Having written now a very simple version which just adds the point data, I try to build it as a Plugin and I get the error

Linking Cxx Shared Library ...\bin\libDataCalculator.dll
Creating library file: ..\bin\libDataCalculator.dll.a
CMakeFiles\DataCalculator.dir\vtkDataCalculator.obj: In function 'ZN17vtkDataCalculator3NewEv':
C:/ParaviewSource/ParaView3/Plugins/vtkDataCalculator.h:14 undefined reference to 'vtable for vtkDataCalculator'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status 


I believe that I miss to specify a Macro, I just put 

vtkTypeMacro(vtkDataCalculator,vtkDataSetAlgorithm);

in my Headerfile. 

If there is a Macro missing, does anyone know, which one?
And if it?s something else .. what?s wrong?

thx for help,
Natalie

Subject: [Paraview] Why does this programmable source not work outside
 the	paraview GUI

The answer is simple: you are missing the UpdateVTKObjects() call to 
'apply' the change to the property.

If you going to use ...GetProperty("..").SetElement(...) API then after 
the property has been set, one must call proxy.UpdateVTKObjects().

so in your example:
...
pgsrc.GetProperty("Script").SetElement(0, """ ... """)
pgsrc.UpdateVTKObjects()

Alternatively  you can simply do:
pgsrc.Script = """....."

and then you don't have to worry about calling UpdateVTKObjects().

Make sure your header and cxx files look something like follows:

vtkDataCalulator.h -----

#include "vtkDataSetAlgorithm.h"

class VTK_EXPORT vtkDataCalculator : public vtkDataSetAlgorithm
{
public:
   static vtkDataCalculator* New();
   vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkDataCalculator, vtkDataSetAlgorithm);
...
};
------------------------------------

vtkDataCalculator.cxx-----------------

#include "vtkDataCalculator.h"
#include "vtkObjectFactory.h"

vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkDataCalculator);
vtkCxxRevisionMacro(vtkDataCalculator, "$Revision$");

....

Subject: [Paraview] How to view the multiple slices on a volumn rendered

Message-ID: <5C8B36E84189A7448899153B272EFBBC08BD20AD@0668-its-exmp01.us.saic.com>

I have a volume rendered 3D cube (uniform rectilinear grid data), which
is rendered by loading the data into the Paraview and applying a
"threshold filter" on it. Now I apply a "slice filter" on this volume
rendered 3D cube. However, in order to see that 2D plane cut by the
"slice", I have to click at the "apply button" wherever I place the
"slice" on the 3D cube. 
Is it possible that I can see the 2D plane cut by the "slice" as I move
the "slice" on the 3D cube?

Thanks!

The answer is simple: you are missing the UpdateVTKObjects() call to
'apply' the change to the property.

If you going to use ...GetProperty("..").SetElement(...) API then after
the property has been set, one must call proxy.UpdateVTKObjects().

so in your example:
...
pgsrc.GetProperty("Script").SetElement(0, """ ... """)
pgsrc.UpdateVTKObjects()

Alternatively  you can simply do:
pgsrc.Script = """....."

and then you don't have to worry about calling UpdateVTKObjects().

I am trying to copy proxy properties from xml state. the 
folowing code work well for "sources" proxies. It works 
also for "representations" proxies, but Instead of copying 
properties to the existing representation, it create 
another representation and I got this error:
"vtkSMStateLoader (0A075FD0): No root is defined. Cannot 
locate proxy element with id 74"
In Paraview I got two representations for the same source.
Here is my code:
void pqPowerView::loadProxyFromState(vtkPVXMLElement 
*stateElement,
																		 vtkSMProxy *smProxy )
{
	vtkSMProxyManager* pxm = vtkSMObject::GetProxyManager();
	vtkSMStateLoader *myLoader = vtkSMStateLoader::New();
	vtkPVXMLElement* collectionElement = 
vtkPVXMLElement::New();

	unsigned int numElems = 
stateElement->GetNumberOfNestedElements();
   unsigned int i=0;

   for (i=0; i<numElems; i++)
   {
     vtkPVXMLElement* currentElement = 
stateElement->GetNestedElement(i);
     if (currentElement->GetName() &&
       strcmp(currentElement->GetName(), "Proxy") == 0)
     {
			currentElement->AddNestedElement(collectionElement);
			if(QString(currentElement->GetAttribute("group")) == 
smProxy->GetXMLGroup()
				&& QString(currentElement->GetAttribute("id")) == 
QString(smProxy->GetSelfIDAsString()) )
			{
				vtkSMProxy *newProxy = 
pxm->NewProxy(smProxy->GetXMLGroup(), 
smProxy->GetXMLName());
				newProxy->LoadState(currentElement, myLoader);
				this->copyProxy(newProxy,smProxy);	

				if(!smProxy)
					qDebug() << "proxy not loaded";
			}
		}			
	}
}


void pqPowerView::copyProxy(vtkSMProxy* src, vtkSMProxy* 
dest)
{
	vtkSMPropertyIterator* iter = 
dest->NewPropertyIterator();
	for (iter->Begin(); !iter->IsAtEnd(); iter->Next())
		 {
		 vtkSMProperty* destProp = iter->GetProperty();
		 vtkSMProperty* srcProp = 
src->GetProperty(iter->GetKey());
		 if (destProp && srcProp)
			 {
			 destProp->Copy(srcProp);
			 }
		 }
	iter->Delete();
}

can you please tell me what am doing wrong ?

the goal is to restore the exposed properties for the xml 
state.

Hi, Alan,

Thanks for the reply.  I believe that I am using paraview 3.3.  This is integrated into OpenFOAM, so, I will not be able to upgrade to paraview 3.4.  I did try pv 3.4 on another computer and it worked.  But, I cannot upgrade (I do not know how) to pv 3.4 for OpenFOAM.

Pei

Pei,
Are you running ParaView 3.4?  I can put in more than 
2 decimal places in the cylinder center.  Another way to place the cylinder 
in another location is to use the transform filter.  It also will allow any 
number of decimal places.
 
Alan

Hi, Paraview group:

I created a cylinder in PV.  I need to move 
it to a new location.  But, default only has 2 decimal places, but, I need 
it to be precise to 3 decimal places.  Is there a way to achieve 
this?

Thanks!

Pei

Hey it works! Your instructions are great.

I set up a sphere and followed your instructions. The programmable
filter I used is this:

#pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pd = vtk.vtkPolyData()
pd =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
coord = pd.GetPoint(0) # (0,0,0.5)
x, y, z = coord[:3]
x = 0
y = 0
z = 0.7
#print x, y, z
pd.GetPoints().SetPoint(0, x, y, z)


I rarely use python so I am not very good at it.

The question I have is that with this current setup the point is
modified in both windows. Is it possible to just modify the point in
the output window?

As you can see I don't fully understand the input/output process of
the ProgrammableFilter.

Thanks for any help.

I have attached the .pvsm file as a zipped file.


Regards
  Andrew

Hi,
Thanks for your response.
>>  I am getting this error:

i have first three columns are node positions and the next
three columns are corresponding x,y,z velocity vectors. I am not sure
which format i should use it to load the data  for flow visualization.
Thanks

Hello,

After loading Paraview state, paraview regenerate proxies 
selfID, how can I restore the same selfID's ?

Subject: [Paraview] filter with multiple input
Message-ID: <BAY122-W13C346F9C34924A3AFE361BC090@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m trying to write a filter with multiple input. Just for trying out, I want to add the scalar attribute data of two datasets (both should have the same structure) and have as an output  one dataset with the same structure and the  the  added scalar data of the two input  datasets. 
The header vtkDataCalculator.h looks like this:

#ifndef __vtkDataCalculator_h
#define __vtkDataCalculator_h

#include "vtkDataSetAlgorithm.h"

class VTK_EXPORT vtkDataCalculator: public vtkDataSetAlgorithm
{ public:
  static vtkDataCalculator *New();

  vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkDataCalculator,vtkDataSetAlgorithm);
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

protected:
    vtkDataCalculator(){};
    ~vtkDataCalculator(){};

    //virtual int FillInputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation* info);
    virtual int RequestData(vtkInformation *, vtkInformationVector **, vtkInformationVector *);
};
#endif


the vtkDataCalculator.cxx file:
#include "vtkDataCalculator.h"
#include "vtkDataSet.h"
#include "vtkDataArray.h"
#include "vtkObjectFactory.h"
#include "vtkPointData.h"
#include "vtkDoubleArray.h"
#include "vtkAlgorithm.h"
#include "vtkSmartPointer.h"
#include "vtkInformation.h"
#include "vtkInformationVector.h"

vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkDataCalculator);
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
vtkCxxRevisionMacro(vtkDataCalculator,"$Revision$");
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkDataCalculator::PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent)
{
    this->Superclass::PrintSelf(os,indent);
}

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------


int vtkDataCalculator::RequestData(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
                                      vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
                                      vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{   
 // int numOfInputs = inputVector -> GetNumberOfInformationObjects();
 // if(numOfInputs != 2) vtkErrorMacro("Number of Inputs not equal 2");
//Get the input and the output
  vtkDataSet* input1 = vtkDataSet::GetData(inputVector[0]);
  vtkDataSet* input2 = vtkDataSet::GetData(inputVector[1]);
  vtkDataSet* output = vtkDataSet::GetData(outputVector);

  //check if the same number of points
  int numOfTuples1 = input1 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(0) -> GetNumberOfTuples();
  int numOfTuples2 = input2 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(0) -> GetNumberOfTuples();

  vtkDoubleArray *scalars1 = vtkDoubleArray::New();
  input1 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(0) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples1,0,0,scalars1);
  
  vtkDoubleArray *scalars2 = vtkDoubleArray::New();
  input2 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(0) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples2,0,0,scalars2);

  vtkDoubleArray *summe = vtkDoubleArray::New();
  summe -> SetNumberOfComponents(1);
  summe -> SetNumberOfTuples(numOfTuples1);

  if(numOfTuples1 != numOfTuples2) {vtkErrorMacro("different Number of Tuples");
                                    return 0;
                                    }
  else { for(int index = 0; index < numOfTuples1; index++)
            { summe -> SetValue(index, (scalars1 -> GetValue(index)) + (scalars2 -> GetValue(index)));
            }
            
         output -> CopyStructure(input1);
         summe -> SetName("Summe");
         output -> GetPointData() -> AddArray(summe);
         output -> GetPointData() -> SetActiveScalars("Summe");
         output -> Squeeze();
         return 1;
        }
}


and now the corresponding ServerManager.xml file:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
<ProxyGroup name="filters">
<SourceProxy name="DataCalculator" class="vtkDataCalculator" label="Data Calculator">
<Documentation>
This filter adds the point data of their scalar attributes. The dimensions must coincide.
</Documentation>

<InputProperty name="Input" command="AddInputConnection" clean_command="RemoveAllInputs" multiple_input="1">
<ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
<Group name="sources"/>
<Group name="filters"/>
</ProxyGroupDomain>

<DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
<DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
</DataTypeDomain>

</InputProperty>
</SourceProxy>

</ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>


Well, that?s my first try.. Paraview shuts down when I try to apply the filter, debugging I get the information that there is something wrong with the input (small wonder ;-) ). But it can also be the case that I just don?t know how to give two datasets to the filter, meaning that to apply the filter, I opened two files, so I had two of those "eye"-icons in paraview?s pipeline browser displayed and hoped that Paraview would recognize those datasets as the input to the filter. 

Thx for any piece of advice,
Natalie

Hi Natalie,

There are problems with your filter code that accesses the inputs. You
are accessing information objects from multiple input ports when it
looks like you want to be looking at multiple input connections from
the same input port. Look at vtkAppendFilter or
vtkAppendPolyDataFilter for code that deals with multiple input
connections. From the description you are giving it looks like a
multiple input port filter might also solve your use-case. Look at
vtkProbeFilter or vtkStreamTracer for code for writing multiple input
port filters (looking at the xmls for the corresponding filters in
ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml should help you with writing the
xmls for each of the case).

The "eye" only control the visibility. It does not affect whether that
source becomes an input to a newly created filter. Only items
"selected" in the pipeline browser become the input. You can select
multiple sources by using "Ctrl" or "Shift" key when selecting in the
pipeline browser.

You cannot. It;s risky to try to reuse the same IDs since they might
have been used by some other object/proxy. You can make the state
loader not clear the proxies it created while loading the state (call
vtkSMStateLoader::LoadState() with keep_proxies=1) then you can use
NewProxy(int) to obtain the proxies created associated with the
SelfIDs in the state file.

Hello!
I want to post-process the discrete phase matter from Fluent, does anyone
have experience on it.

In particular which format for discrete phase (trajectories of particles) is
compatible with paraview?

Thank you!

Hey paraview comunity,

I have a problem, and I think you can show me the path to solve it.

I've programmed a plugin which has a custom Object Panel. In this panel, I can select in a QComboBox an integer number, from 0 to 6. Suppose now that I have an unstructured grid, whose cells contain a scalar data field. What I want to do is, when a specific integer is selected, the cells which have this number associated as scalar data have their edges "highlighted". By highlighted I mean coloured in green, pink, red, or any different color. 

ParaView colors my model according to the number associated with each cell. I want to have this colors preserved. What I want to do is exactly what Selection Inspector does, when I choose to select by Threshold.

Any suggestions ?

Thanks y'all,
Rafael March.

Thank you utkarsh for your response,

If the names of proxies can be duplicated, and the Id's 
are regenerated after loading the state, how to re locate 
the proxies then ?

Hey Rafael,

Okay this is a bit advanced (and hacky at the same time -- in ParaView 
design object inspector panels are never meant to affect the active 
selection), but you can give it a try for your plugin.

In your custom object, when the user changes the 'index' you can set up 
a ("sources", "ThresholdSelectionSource") proxy instance (create a new 
one if needed) and set it as the selection input to the proxy the panel 
is showing (vtkSMSourceProxy::SetSelectionInput). You can look at 
pqSelectionInspectorPanel::select to see how the a new selection source 
may be created.

Thanks for the reply, Utkarsh !
?
Yeah, that's a possibility ! I'll try to do this way !

But I think what I need is even simpler as changing the active selection: I need only to change only the colors ! I mean, if I had a method vtkCell::setColor(int,int,int), for instance, it would be exactly what I need ! :)
?
Thanks y'all,

  Hi

  I have a group of points in the ZoY plane. I want to display them as a

  If they were in any other plane a Delaunay2D, using "best fitting plane" 
would work (at least, has been working) but for this plane nothing shows

  Any ideas?

Hi

I have been looking for an example, which would help me understand how  
I can get some information about a dataset and display it in a GUI  
element (e.g. in a QLabel).

E.g. as an example, I would like to have a panel or some other gui  
element, which displays certain values which it gets from a data set  
(e.g. number of lines in a polydata, or total volume of a unstructured  
grid, or ...)

Can you please suggest how I could achieve this?

Thanks,
Bryn

paraview load state use :

so to test if keep_proxies works, I just added 1 to:
spLoader->LoadState(rootElement, 1);

after loading the state and saving again:
<Proxy group="sources" type="CubeSource" id="86" 
servers="1">
became:
<Proxy group="sources" type="CubeSource" id="92" 
servers="1">

that mean keep_proxies is not working ?

Message-ID: <d0767b160811241033q21be16d7p6edfb7051758ea2c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.
I have tested paraview on a builtin server and a localhost server(run
pvserver and connect client to it on the same computer). It seems to me that
the builtin server is much faster than localhost server. Since the computer
is the same, i am wondering if the localhost server have to readback all the
data in GPU and transfer these data to client in order to be displayed? On
the other hand, for the builtin server, the data in GPU is displayed
directly(no readback). Could you please explain why the localhost is slower
than builtin?
Thanks very much!

"id" is never preserved no matter what you do with keep_proxies. 
keep_proxies is only a means to access the newly created using the same 
old ids from the state loader.

The builtin server lives inside the same process as the client. All
communication between server and client takes place via pointers and
vtk class methods are directly called.

"Localhost" ie, running pvserver on the same machine as the client and
connecting to it consists of two separate processes. It is slower
because both processes compete for CPU cycles and memory space more
importantly, because communication between the two takes place via TCP
sockets.

Thanks for your reply.
I have another question though. You said the two processes communicated via
TCP sockets. What do they actually transfer? The final rendered image? The
vtk class methods calls? Or both?
I also have tested the pvserver on a remote computer, and I connected to the
server with 100 M network. I am wondering if the network speed is good
enough for paraveiw? In other words, no huge display delay because of
network?
Thanks.

It depends on the settings.

* vtk class method names and arguments to data processing filters
(clip, slice, contour, surface generation) are always sent from the
client to the server whenever a filter parameter changes.

* If the resulting geometry is smaller than the
settings->remote->server->remote render threshold, than the geometry
is sent back (on each filter parameter change, NOT on every camera
setting change) to the client and rendered locally.

* If the geometry is larger than that, then the image is rendered by
the server and the pixels are sent back every frame.

* If the visible geometry is small enough that the client can render
it interactively, than a 100M connection shouldn't be any problem.

Hi Ricardo Reis:

    As you know, pqFileDialog is a sub-class of QDialog. In fact QDialog
takes a set of 'SIMILAR' files as something like a folder and groups these
files together, which are then shown, instead of being filtered out, in the
'Load State' file dialog. By 'SIMILAR', such files have the same file name
(and certainly the same file extension) EXCEPT FOR the DIGIT-based suffixes.
Here are some examples:

    (1) Image00.bmp and Image01.bmp are SIMILAR.
    (2) Image00.bmp and Image999.bmp are SIMILAR --- the suffixes may be of
different lengths.
    (3) Image.bmp and Image00.bmp are NOT SIMILAR --- because the former
file name does not contain a digit-based suffix.
    (4) Image00.bmp and Imagexx are NOT SIMILAR.

    Such a grouping mechanism (applicable to only SIMILAR files) provided by
pqFileDialog (and originally QDialog) is desired in that it avoids a
possibly long list of SIMILAR files in the preview (the long list is
expandable only per the user's click --- this is desirable) when "All
Files(*)" is used.

    In a word, what was reported might not be a bug. Instead it is just a
useful feature. If there are no any SIMILAR files in a directory, the
mis-filter 'problem'' will not occur. Should file dialog mis-filtering occur
again with a directory that contains no any SIMILAR files, please let me
know.

    Thanks.

 When doing "load state"

 and having in the "Files of type" selected "Paraview state file (*.pvsm)"

 instead of just showing up the files ending with .pvsm

 all files are shown.

 I'm using paraview compile from cvs right now.

In-Reply-To: <4926C128.9050501@nag.co.uk>
Message-ID: <C5506F39.5031%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Someone who actually did the technical work can correct me, but I believe the the current version of the Cray XT port was done against the Cray XT3 running catamount.  Catamount does not support sockets, so all the socket code and anything relying on it was disabled.  Thus, the first step is to turn the sockets back on.  It sounds like you have already done that.

Not having used a Cray XT4, I cannot profess to understand all the technical details.  It sounds like all you may need to do is establish a "reverse connection."  That is, the client will listen on a port and the server will connect back to it.  To set up a reverse connection, simply make a client connection with a reverse connection type and launch pvserver with the -rc flag and the appropriate --client-host flag.

Dear all,
I have cross compiled Paraview 3.4 on a Cay XT4 machine following mostly
the instructions on page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Compiling_ParaView3_for_Cray_supercomputers
Firstly I tested pvbatch using the coloredSphere.py I found on the page
above , which seems to have worked fine.

I have also installed on the login node the paraview GUI and I was
trying to set up paraview and pvserver to work together.
It seems though that pvserver that runs on the computed nodes is trying
to open IP sockets to establish communication with the login node.
CNL (the operating system on the compute node) supports sockets but  is
not configured  to open  ports (while opening a port on the computing
node from a server  running on the login node is possible)
Is there any way round this as far as the configuration of pvserver is
concerned?

Thanks

Weicheng,

The "Auto Accept" option mostly does what you want.  Open up the ParaView options dialog box (Edit -> Settings or ParaView -> Preferences on Mac), go to the General page and click on the Auto Accept checkbox.  Once you turn this on, you will never have to hit Apply; all changes get applied as soon as you make it.  This change is system wide, it will happen for any reader, source, or filter, not just the slice filter.  Also, slice filter will only update once you let go of the 3D widget; it will not continuously change as you move it around.

Another option you might be interested in is the slice offset values option in the slice filter.  The slice filter allows you to place multiple slices at once.  Just scroll to the bottom of the object inspector and add a new range of slice offset values.

Yet another option you might be interested in is the ability to animate the slice plane.  Open the animation view (View -> Animation View) and add a track for the Slice Offset Values parameter of the slice filter.  The default values will animate the slice plane along the normal direction of the slice widget.

A straightforward way of implementing this would be to add a custom view via a plugin.  The Plugin HowTo Wiki page describes how to make a plugin with a custom view in it.  The implementation to get the data you need to display in the view is up to you.

To be honest, I have never understood the behavior of the "best fitting plane" for the Delaunay2D filter.  I would be tempted to fix it, but there could be a reason for its implementation.

This is a bit of a hack, but you can get around the problem by first applying the transform filter to rotate the data by 90 degrees around the Y axis to align it with the X-Y plane.

  Any ideas?

Let me put it this way: all files (*.case, *.scl, *.vec) show up, besides 
the *.pvsm which were the only files I expected. If you want I can make a 
film or take a printscreen for you to see. If there is any other info that 
can be helpful let me know.

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple temporal shifts still not working right

Nuts.  I guess it wasn't fixed after all.  I submitted a new bug report with your new description.

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=8156

Note that I think I found a workaround using the temporal cache filter.  (Details in the bug report.)

Hey,

Sorry for the long email, but I find this problem difficult to
describe succinctly...

In February I was trying to use multiple Temporal Shift Scale filters
as input to a Python Programmable Filter to do on-the-fly point
velocity calculations (for diffusing particles in my simulation
output). There were troubles with the pipeline updating properly, and
Ken Moreland came up with a nice self-contained test case and filed
the bug 6307:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6307

which was listed in August as "fixed" because the test case seemed to
work now. But, I don't think this is really resolved yet.

If you load in the TimeShiftTest2.pvsm state file, the animation seems
to play correctly, but I think that's a red herring. If you turn off
the visibility of the TemporalShiftScale filters, you can see that no
boxes move until after t=1.0, whereas if the temporal filters are
turned on, and the group filter is turned off, one box moves and then
the other.

I don't know if this helps, but if you look at the Output printed by
the Python filter in TimeShiftTest1.pvsm, you can see that the
temporal data sets have the correct time, but the ImageData within
them doesn't match.
......

All of this is much more clear to me when I load in a simple data set
with one point moving in time (attached Xdmf data set -- I'll also
attach a link to a state file which sets this pipeline up, but you'll
have to change the path for the data file in the state file manually
if you want to use it).

The pipeline is: Load data. Add a Temporal Shift Scale with (post)
shift=0. Add another TSS off the original data set with (post) shift =
1. Highlight both TSSs and route into a Python Programmable Filter
with Unstructured Grid output and this script:

in0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
ds0 = in0.GetTimeStep(0)
in1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
ds1 = in1.GetTimeStep(0)
print 'in1 t = %.1f' % in1.GetInformation().Get(in1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
print 'ds1 t = %.1f' % ds1.GetInformation().Get(ds1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
print 'in0 t = %.1f' % in0.GetInformation().Get(in0.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
print 'ds0 t = %.1f' % ds0.GetInformation().Get(ds0.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
out1 = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
out1.ShallowCopy(ds0)
print 'out1 t = %.1f' %
out1.GetInformation().Get(out1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)

When I animate this (PV CVS or 3.4, OS X 10.5.5), with the TSSs on and
the PPF off, I see the expected: two points, one following the other.
When the TSSs are off and the PPF is on, only one point shows up.
Also, the behavior is different if the animation is stepped backwards
rather than forwards. And, the printed Output times from the PPF show
one of the ImageData sets time doesn't match its temporal host.

As in Ken's example, this works very similarly with a Group filter in
place of the PPF.

This still seems very confusing, and I hope someone will have some clue!

Thanks,
-Eric

paraview for image data volume rendering? Does these algorithms use GPU at
all?
Thanks!

Ricardo,

You are correct, it is a bug. From what I could see, not all files will show up besides *.pvsm ones (for instance, .exo does not show up in the list).  This makes the problem pretty confusing.  I wrote up bug number 8159.

Zhanping, if this is incorrect, please just resolve the bug and I can take a further look at it.

Thanks,

Alan

Message-ID: <506583.44838.qm@web36202.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi there,

I just upgraded my paraview from 3.10 to 3.40. Immediately I found that the same data was not colored correctly with the new version. It turned out that in the Display Tab, Rescale to Data Range button actually does nothing. If I clicked on Edit Color Map.., I found that the maximum of data range is always 1 (minimum always 0), no matter what the real range is. I can of course uncheck Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range, and set the range using Rescale Range button by hand. However, I think this is not what it is supposed to be.  I tried both the Linux-64bit binary found online and my own build on an ubuntu box and they have the same problem.  Please let me know if it is indeed a bug or just something I didn't get right. Thanks a lot.

Thanks a lot.
Shi

Subject: [Paraview] Extra Plugins at Build time
Message-ID: <492BB071.7030400@cscs.ch>

I used to use the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES, to compile code for 
inclusion along with paraview, now I use plugins, but I'd like to build 
paraview once - and have my plugins compiled at the same time as 
paraview, and placed in the same binary directory (for inexpert users 
who regard building them separately as challenging). I looked at the 
wiki, but couldn't find an equivalent which might be named something like
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_PLUGIN_BUILD_PATH
and would allow me to add N plugins at compile time and have them all 
done together.
does such a functionality already exist? If not, I'll add it. (Other 
name suggestions welcome for plugin path string)

It uses at least the FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper. ( It may use others as

Subject: [Paraview] Specifying a NULL scalar array in custom filter
Message-ID: <492C02EB.5010005@cscs.ch>

I think I've asked this before and the answer was "can't be done"
but I'm not sure ...so...

If I need the user to enter a scalar array which is one of the existing 
point data arrays - or NONE - is there a way of doing it with xml domain 
magic?

thanks

One way would be to write a domain which is a array list domain subclass 
that provides the "array" NONE as an option.

The code can be viewed from the following web address:

http://www.bluequartz.net/viewvc/CTMD/PVRoboMet

(It is a slow CVS server so give it some time..)

I'll try to summarize what you will need to do.

SERVER SIDE:
    Within your filter/reader that you want to get information about  
you will need to implement all the Get* methods of the values that you  
want information about. For example in the file src/Readers/ 
vtkH5RoboMetReader.h you will see methods such as

vtkTypeInt32 GetCurrentMosaicWidth();
vtkTypeInt32 GetCurrentMosaicHeight();

Once you have those implemented you will next need to add some XML to  
the Server Manager XML file (pv3_xml/PVRoboMet_PVSM.xml in my code base)

To expose those 2 properties from above we need to add the following  
xml (Assuming you already have a complete Server Manager XML file  
working..)

<IntVectorProperty name="CurrentMosaicWidth"
                    command="GetCurrentMosaicWidth"
		   number_of_elements="1"
                    default_values="0"
                    information_only="1"  >
                 <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
</IntVectorProperty>

<IntVectorProperty name="CurrentMosaicHeight"
                    command="GetCurrentMosaicHeight"
                    number_of_elements="1"
                    default_values="0"
                    information_only="1"  >
                 <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
</IntVectorProperty>

That is all for the SERVER SIDE of things. Now for the Client Side of  
things.

Take a look in the src/PV3ClientPlugin folder for the source.

In the pqH5RoboMetReaderPanel class you will see that I inherit from  
pqLoadedFormObjectPanel. There may be other ways to do this but I used  
this class. I then created my GUI QtPanel inside of QtDesigner placing  
my QLabels into my design. Name all the QLabels appropriately for your  
case.
   Some of the details of the class can be seen in the .cpp file. In  
the constructor of the class I get pointers to all the QLabels that I  
want to set the value for.
MosaicWidth = qFindChild<QLabel*>(this, "MosaicWidth");
MosaicHeight = qFindChild<QLabel*>(this, "MosaicHeight");

Note the value in the double quotes in the arguments is the "Object  
Name" that you gave to your label in QtDesigner.

You need to implement the updateInformationAndDomains() methods from  
the super class to actually get the information from the server side:

void pqH5RoboMetReaderPanel::updateInformationAndDomains()
{
   pqLoadedFormObjectPanel::updateInformationAndDomains();
   updateIntValue(this->MosaicWidth, "CurrentMosaicWidth", 0);
   updateIntValue(this->MosaicHeight, "CurrentMosaicHeight", 0);
}

and I implemented this method:

void pqH5RoboMetReaderPanel::updateIntValue(QLabel* qLabel,
					    QString property,
                                             qint32 index)
{
   vtkSMProperty* smProperty = this->proxy()- 
 >GetProperty(property.toAscii());
   if (NULL == smProperty)
   {
     std::string msg = "SMProperty [int] was NULL for ";
     msg.append(property.toAscii() );
     DebugTrace(<< msg.c_str() );
   }
   vtkSMIntVectorProperty* dvp =  
vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(smProperty);
   int value = dvp->GetElement(index);
   qLabel->setText(QString::number(value));
}

That should get you going enough. Let me know if you have any  
questions. I guess this might be a good one to put on the Wiki as a  
tutorial.

Shi,

I have not run into this, nor have I heard of anyone else who has.  Could you tell us more about your data or, better yet, send us an example?

One thing that has changed with the rescale range feature recently is that the range is now computed based on the values that appear throughout an entire volume, not just what appears on the surface.  Thus, if you are rendering a volume of data with 1 in the middle but with the surface only having up to 0.01, the range is still going to be up to 1.  Check the ranges in the Information panel.  The scalar bar range should agree with that.  If you don't know where the upper values are located, try using the threshold filter to find them.

Hi there,

I just upgraded my paraview from 3.10 to 3.40. Immediately I found that the same data was not colored correctly with the new version. It turned out that in the Display Tab, Rescale to Data Range button actually does nothing. If I clicked on Edit Color Map.., I found that the maximum of data range is always 1 (minimum always 0), no matter what the real range is. I can of course uncheck Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range, and set the range using Rescale Range button by hand. However, I think this is not what it is supposed to be.  I tried both the Linux-64bit binary found online and my own build on an ubuntu box and they have the same problem.  Please let me know if it is indeed a bug or just something I didn't get right. Thanks a lot.

Thanks a lot.

Hello, I had a similar problem in which was looking to plot the pressure on
the surface of a tube in a flow.
The way I did it was to 
Extract Block -> Connectivity -> Scatter plot.
The only problem with this was that it plotted starting at 120 degrees and
also I have the pressure over top and bottom overlaying each other, kind of
like it is plotted against x instead of along surface. It is also possible
to plot along a contour by selecting the points along a contour and
extracting selection and scatter plot. Note, I have so far been looking only
at 2D sets of data but I am sure can be used for 3D by taking a slice.

If I didn't include the Connectivity when extracting block it still plotted
however it jumped around the circle, which I think may be something to do
with my original mesh.

So I haven't quite got it doing what I want and look forward to when plots
along curved lines are available, if anyone else has any advice it would be
welcome.

Just to say it is also possible to open new viewer window with spreadsheet
and select extarcted selection or contour from drop down and then save this
as a .csv file which can easily be read plenty of other programs such as
Matlab for further data analysis.

Hey Ken,

Thanks a lot for looking into this -- I'm sure it was a pleasure to  
see it pop up again! :)

Your workaround using the temporal cache filter seems to work as long  
as I do the grouping in the "correct" order. If I first click on the  
shift(0) filter, and then command-click to also select the shift(1)  
filter and then group the data sets, stepping forward in time only  
shows one point, but then backwards in time shows the correct thing:  
two points trailing each other. If I select the shift(1) first and  
then the shift(0), stepping forwards in time works, but not backwards.  
(Although, I still get a "stutter" sometimes where on the second click  
forwards after applying the group filter the points collapse for one  
step...)

If I select in the "wrong" order, but increase the size of the caches  
(up from the original 2), I can get the points to look right for one  
or two steps forwards sometimes. They always look right going forward  
if I've just stepped backwards through that time range so the data is  
in the caches.

So, temporal caching fixes it if the filters are selected in the  
"right" order for the order in which the time is going to be stepped...

Thanks,
-Eric

Nope.  I still can't replicate the problem.  I downloaded the binary you specify, loaded the data set you sent, and it set the range fine.

I notice from the image you sent that the color bar does not have the default colors.  Are you sure that you are actually using the version of ParaView you downloaded as opposed to another version that might be in your path?  Earlier versions of ParaView used that rainbow scalar bar as a default.  Either that or you have been playing with color scale editor dialog box.  In that case, you may have accidently changed the range without realizing it.

Hi Ken,

Thank you. I have attached my sample data file and a screenshot taken under paraview-3.4.0 under 64bit Linux.
Just now I tried the Windows version and it seems to be working fine. So I guess this is a problem only found in the Linux version. By looking at the range for the variable Rank in the information panel, we can see it is [3,3] however the color displays only for range [0,1].
Please let me know if you can reproduce this problem on Linux. The binary I used is paraview-3.4.0-Linux-x86_64.

Thanks a lot.

Re: [Paraview] Bug in Color Scale Shi,

I have not run into this, nor have I heard of anyone else who has.  Could you tell us more about your data or, better yet, send us an example?

One thing that has changed with the rescale range feature recently is that the range is now computed based on the values that appear throughout an entire volume, not just what appears on the surface.  Thus, if you are rendering a volume of data with 1 in the middle but with the surface only having up to 0.01, the range is still going to be up to 1.  Check the ranges in the Information panel.  The scalar bar range should agree with that.  If you don't know where the upper values are located, try using the threshold filter to find them.

Hi there,

If I clicked on Edit Color Map.., I found that the maximum of data range is always 1 (minimum always 0), no matter what the real range is. I can of course uncheck Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range, and set the range using Rescale Range button by hand. However, I think this is not what it is supposed to be.

Hey Ken,

Thanks a lot for looking into this -- I'm sure it was a pleasure to see it pop up again! :)

Your workaround using the temporal cache filter seems to work as long as I do the grouping in the "correct" order. If I first click on the shift(0) filter, and then command-click to also select the shift(1) filter and then group the data sets, stepping forward in time only shows one point, but then backwards in time shows the correct thing: two points trailing each other. If I select the shift(1) first and then the shift(0), stepping forwards in time works, but not backwards. (Although, I still get a "stutter" sometimes where on the second click forwards after applying the group filter the points collapse for one step...)

If I select in the "wrong" order, but increase the size of the caches (up from the original 2), I can get the points to look right for one or two steps forwards sometimes. They always look right going forward if I've just stepped backwards through that time range so the data is in the caches.

So, temporal caching fixes it if the filters are selected in the "right" order for the order in which the time is going to be stepped...

Thanks,
-Eric

Hey,

 Sorry for the long email, but I find this problem difficult to
 describe succinctly...

 In February I was trying to use multiple Temporal Shift Scale filters
 as input to a Python Programmable Filter to do on-the-fly point
 velocity calculations (for diffusing particles in my simulation
 output). There were troubles with the pipeline updating properly, and
 Ken Moreland came up with a nice self-contained test case and filed
 the bug 6307:

 http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6307

 which was listed in August as "fixed" because the test case seemed to
 work now. But, I don't think this is really resolved yet.

 If you load in the TimeShiftTest2.pvsm state file, the animation seems
 to play correctly, but I think that's a red herring. If you turn off
 the visibility of the TemporalShiftScale filters, you can see that no
 boxes move until after t=1.0, whereas if the temporal filters are
 turned on, and the group filter is turned off, one box moves and then
 the other.

 I don't know if this helps, but if you look at the Output printed by
 the Python filter in TimeShiftTest1.pvsm, you can see that the
 temporal data sets have the correct time, but the ImageData within
 them doesn't match.
 ......

 All of this is much more clear to me when I load in a simple data set
 with one point moving in time (attached Xdmf data set -- I'll also
 attach a link to a state file which sets this pipeline up, but you'll
 have to change the path for the data file in the state file manually
 if you want to use it).

 The pipeline is: Load data. Add a Temporal Shift Scale with (post)
 shift=0. Add another TSS off the original data set with (post) shift =
 1. Highlight both TSSs and route into a Python Programmable Filter
 with Unstructured Grid output and this script:

 in0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
 ds0 = in0.GetTimeStep(0)
 in1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
 ds1 = in1.GetTimeStep(0)
 print 'in1 t = %.1f' % in1.GetInformation().Get(in1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
 print 'ds1 t = %.1f' % ds1.GetInformation().Get(ds1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
 print 'in0 t = %.1f' % in0.GetInformation().Get(in0.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
 print 'ds0 t = %.1f' % ds0.GetInformation().Get(ds0.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)
 out1 = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
 out1.ShallowCopy(ds0)
 print 'out1 t = %.1f' %
 out1.GetInformation().Get(out1.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)

 When I animate this (PV CVS or 3.4, OS X 10.5.5), with the TSSs on and
 the PPF off, I see the expected: two points, one following the other.
 When the TSSs are off and the PPF is on, only one point shows up.
 Also, the behavior is different if the animation is stepped backwards
 rather than forwards. And, the printed Output times from the PPF show
 one of the ImageData sets time doesn't match its temporal host.

 As in Ken's example, this works very similarly with a Group filter in
 place of the PPF.

 This still seems very confusing, and I hope someone will have some clue!

 Thanks,
 -Eric

Thank you Ken.
This is really strange then. I just downloaded the 32-bit version for Linux and had the same problems. It sounds like a problem of my linux box.

By the way, I did change the color map to HSV earlier but I am sure I didn't change anything else. And the new 32bit binary, I didn't do anything to it and still get the [0,1] range.  I guess I have to use some other machines to see the problems.

Thank you for your quick response and I will keep you updated on my findings.

Message-ID: <b0a936c00811260001o9655091w2f3faa26aab9ed81@mail.gmail.com>

I am new to vtk. I have a script like this:

from paraview import vtk

# Create axes
axes = vtk.vtkCubeAxesActor2D()
....
...
...

But I cannot access vtkCubeAxesActor2D(). Any help would greatly be
appreciated.

Thanks

Hi Alan and Ricardo:

   I repeated the procedure described in the bug report (#8159). What I can
see is "multicomb_..vts", which can be expanded, if further clicked, to
multicomb_0.vts, multicomb_1.vts, and multicomb_2.vts. As I explained
earlier, this scheme of showing grouped SIMILAR (please refer to a previous
e-mail to find the 'definition' of SIMILAR) files as something like an
expandable 'folder' might be desired. This scheme can provide a preview
functionality while avoiding the appearance of a long list of files. I
checked the printscreen image that Ricardo uploaded, but it is too small to
be seen clearly enough. It seems that the files shown in the screenshot
image are just grouped similar files, besides some folders.

  Ricardo: do you mind sending me a bigger screenshot image so that I can
recognize what files, unless grouped similar files or folders, are really
there?

  Thanks.

No, sorry, it escaped me (thread view can be tricky)

Rotating the points won't do it. I need that plane in a 3D context (ie, I 
need to see it's relative orientation to the other 3D structures around 
it), not just looking at it (2D wise).

  What I can do, for this particular plane, is to write a structure grid 
for it, then it will display ok. But what I would like to do is would be 
to have the same treatment (write the same kind of files) for all planes. 
I'll try to make some screenshots so I can better explain this.

  many thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] import of camera path
Message-ID: <op.uk9qlrz3gsn1o4@chris-pc.uct.ac.za>

Hi there,

I'm trying to animate some large PLY-meshes in Paraview. In principle it  
works, but the animation tools provided are a bit difficult to use in this  
case.
I'm looking for a solution to setup a camera-path in a 3D-modelling  
environment and using it in Paraview. VRML seems to be able to store  
camera positions per keyframe, but Paraview doesn't import that  
information. Also, my scripting knowledge is not sufficient to write a  
script to import the camera positions at a specific keyframe from a list.  
Are there any other formats, which work better? Or has anybody got some  
tips, how to script something like that?

Any help is being much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
-Chris

Hi

I want to generate and display data in the paraview GUI, all from the python shell tool. The vtk data is not generated from a reader or from inside a programmable source, but directly inside the paraview GUI shell environment. I now want to connect the input of a filter to this polyData. Are there any interfacing functions to do this: Here is my example script in which the comments describe what I am trying to do.

Thanks in advance,
Louis


# Here is the vtk data generated directly in the GUI python shell:

import vtk

pts=vtk.vtkPoints()

pts.Initialize()

pts.InsertNextPoint(0,0,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(1,0,.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(2,1,0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(3,3,0.)



cel=vtk.vtkCellArray()

cel.Initialize()

cel.InsertNextCell(4) # number of points

cel.InsertCellPoint(0)

cel.InsertCellPoint(1)

cel.InsertCellPoint(2)

cel.InsertCellPoint(3)



pdata=vtk.vtkPolyData()

pdata.SetPoints(pts)

pdata.SetPolys(cel)



# Here I am setting up a pipline and registering the proxies

pxm=servermanager.ProxyManager()



# Create our programmable filter and set its program ...

#========================================================

filter = servermanager.filters.ProgrammableFilter()

filter.GetProperty("Script").SetElement(0, """

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

output.DeepCopy(input)

""")



# Connect the polyData output to

# the programmable filter input ...



# Here is where I need a link between the filter and my polyData

# The following obviously does not work...



filter.Input = pData

#filter.Input.SetData(polyData)



pxm.RegisterProxy("sources", "my programmable filter", filter)



view = pxm.GetProxy("views", "RenderView1")

rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(filter, view)

pxm.RegisterProxy("representations", "myrep1", rep)

Thanks. I subclassed vtkSMArrayListDomain and made 
vtkSMArrayListNoneDomain. I only needed to add one line to set the 
"None" String. However, I decided this was a waste of a class and didn't 
let me customize the string, so I wanted to try adding an atttribute to 
ArrayListDomain so we could just re-use the existing class with an extra 
tag.

I have added "none_string" as an attribute and it can be used like this

        <ArrayListDomain name="array_list"
                         attribute_type="Scalars"
                         none_string="No Total Pressure Array"
                         input_domain_name="tp_array">
          <RequiredProperties>
            <Property name="Input" function="Input"/>
          </RequiredProperties>
        </ArrayListDomain>

So now the array selection pops up and there is an additional entry 
which is "No Total Pressure Array" in this case. This string is passed 
to the filter, and since the array does not exist in the Point/Cell 
Field data, the filter ignores it.

Shall I commit this to CVS ?

extract surface -> connectivity filter -> threshold filter + slice in z

I forgot an important element in the procedure. I have a table entry 
that assigns a number to all vertices, each surface has a non-zero 
value. The interior values are 0. The cylinder surface value was -3. 
Therefore when I clicked threshold with min/max values of -3, all the 
other surfaces disappeared and the cylinder surface remained. Then slice 
in z produced the attached figure.
Hope this is more clear.

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to figure out a way of driving my post-processing through a
python script.
What I want to do is have a standard set of views that I can load through
python (without having to reload the data every time) and output pictures
for each of them.
 - different camera positions
 - different scalars plotted (and different scalar bars)
Is using the lookmarks the best way ?
If it is, how do I load lookmarks through python ?

Subject: [Paraview] File Format for Particles
Message-ID: <489128.700.qm@web36205.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi there,

I am doing a simulation of fluid-particle interactions, in which I generate a lot of data for particles. I am looking for the efficient file format to store my particle information for visualization with paraview. For example, is there a file format that allows me to store all the particle information at a given time in a single ascii file, which looks like
#1-id 2-radius 3-rho_p 4-fixed 5-x 6-y 7-z 8-u 9-v 10-z 11-w1 12-w2 13-w3 14-alpha 15-theta 17-phi
0 0.500000 1.200000 0 2.077176 2.678227 8.649375 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
1 0.500000 0.800 0 2.728281 0.873571 6.806029 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
...

I guess for the purpuse of visualization, we need radius, rho_p(for color), x,y and z at least. The rotation information would be nice to have but is considered optional at this stage. 

I am thinking to save different time results in different files to make the loading efficient in terms of memory since I have a lot of particles here. Then we can produce animation using time control. I guess we could use VTK formats but that has lots of redundant information.

I saw some very early discussion on a similar topic in the forum but didn't get the conclusive answer. I would appreciate some advice for the current version of paraview.

Thank you very much.

I have a 2D vector field, I draw some streamlines in it and...the streamlines are not in the place but rather parallel to it but at some distance.
The file is very small so if someone need to see it, let me know.

Hi Shi,

Saving such amounts of data in ascii format is not going to be 
efficient. We just accepted this fact, otherwise we should go to binary 
formats.

In our group we have discrete particle simulations, and we export vtk 
files (xml format -- an unstructured grid to be precise) that contains 
all the particle data. I have included an example of such a file below. 
You write the point positions of the particles first, followed by data 
concerning the movement of the particle, the diameter and other stuff 
like rotation, temperature, etc... I don't see what you mean by 
redundant data. When you load this file into Paraview choose the glyph 
option, choose 'sphere', set 'radius' to 1 (it is initially set to 0.5), 
scale mode to 'scalar' and scale factor to 1. You can then draw the 
particles. You can color them by velocity, temperature, rotation or 
whatever you included in the file, or you can choose to show arrows 
(another glyph) to display the particle movement.
For the flow field, which is calculated on a structured grid, you can 
use another file format, e.g. rectilinear grid. In all cases the 
kitware/vtk file formats documentation is going to be useful.

All,

I modified a script that Robert Maynard posted back in 2007 for saving and
loading states.
I haven't thoroughly tested it yet, but it seems to work fine for me.
Basically it saves only the properties of the RenderView but not the
Representations property.
This has for effect that you only save the camera / lightings etc settings
without having to worry about what sources your viewing or representations
are associated to your view.
I find it very useful to automate post-processing were you use a standard
set of cam positions.

Also for those who have problems with cPickle, just use pickle instead...

Thought I'd give this back to the community - let me know if you are using
it, I will probably build some more on top of this.

Hi Shi,

Yes, for large amounts of data you should use the binary (not ascii) 
formats. It is very simple to switch between ascii/binary. In the writer 
classes (e.g. vtkPolyDataWriter) you can usually call the function 
SetFileTypeToBinary() or SetFileTypeToASCII().


An unstructured grid can of course be used to visualize your data in 
paraview. Since you not have cells (tetrahedra, hexahedra, etc.) a 
vtkPolyData data structure and associated file type might be better, 
since it uses slightly less storage and if you add the points as "Verts" 
Paraview will automatically display them using glyphs (sphere,arrow,..)

File formats are described here:
http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf

extract surface -> connectivity filter -> threshold filter + slice in z

I forgot an important element in the procedure. I have a table entry
that assigns a number to all vertices, each surface has a non-zero
value. The interior values are 0. The cylinder surface value was -3.
Therefore when I clicked threshold with min/max values of -3, all the
other surfaces disappeared and the cylinder surface remained. Then slice
in z produced the attached figure.
Hope this is more clear.

I added Scatter plot

extract surface -> connectivity filter -> threshold filter + slice in z
   > Scatter plot

To get the attached figure, but I do not know what the x-axis is, looks
like degrees.
Stephen

Hi Shi, Ken, and all,

A user of my reader reported exactly the same problem about the auto
scaling on ParaView 3.5.0. He told me that after applying Rescale to
Data Range to scalar attributes the range is always set to [0, 1],
even though the data actually has a range of e.g. [87200, 87250].

He also provided me with one of the datasets that caused the problem
but so far I am not able to reproduce the problem (tested with the CVS
head on Windows and Linux 32bit). I kind of suspected an uninitialized
variable somewhere and tried a valgrind test but it didn't tell me
anything meaningful either.

Hence, I'm interested in under what exact condition this problem would
occur...? Did anyone else encounter the problem, and if so, is it 100%
reproducible?

Here is the latest version that I have worked on. It has some exceptions
built in because of problems we had when transferring the pickle files
across machines ( windows sizes, stereo settings).

Subject: [Paraview] comparing z= constant planes
Message-ID: <49300C30.6020208@sophia.inria.fr>

I have to parallel planes offset by a constant z. I slice twice to get 
the two planes, z1 and z2 (z2= z1+ conste).
I would like to overlay the wire frames (remove the z-offset from plane 
z2), how does one do this?

Thank you Bryn and Ivo.

I agree binary format is more efficient. But I am reluctant to do that because of the issue of portability. I may run the code on both Linux clusters and IBM machines. My earlier experience shows me that the binary files on the two system are not compatible, i.e., I cannot load the data generated on a IBM machine  on a Linux system. Does the little/big endian parameter  solve this problem in paraview? 
Thanks.

Shi

Legacy VTK files store data always in big endian so there is no 
compatibility problem. With XML you probably can specify.

Subject: [Paraview] redundant information  in the VTK XML file format
Message-ID: <868859.38305.qm@web36201.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi there,

I have been using the VTK XML unstructured grid format (pvtu and vtu) for my fluid dynamics simulations. It worked fairly well with paraview but I think it stores a lot of redundant information and I am wondering if there is a way to simplify it.

1. My grid is fixed once created. I am dumping velocity and pressure field at many steps but in each vtu file, I have to have the same grid information such as vertex positions, cell connectivity, offset and cell type.  What I would love to have is to dump the grid at the beginning of the simulation and then only dump the field of velocity and pressure at later time steps. To make it work, we need a way to include the grid information stored in another file, just like the #include statement in C++ or \input in Latex.

2. All my cells are of the same type (10-vertex Tetrahedron in my case). So the "types" are the same constant 10 and "offsets" are constant increments. What is now in my file are long lists of these boring numbering for each cell, which I would love to have a way to get rid of. 

I would appreciate any help.
Thanks.

Shi

Hi All,

Does anybody happen to know which software can generate computational
Schlieren image file? Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] beginner: dissapearing data in render view window
Message-ID: <1227983833.6486.28.camel@localhost>

Hello,

    I'm still having problems with dissapearing data in my RenderView
window.

I run the same thing in my stand alone python interpreter as well as in
pvpython, and I encounter the same problem.

Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Jun  6 2008, 23:32:27) 
[GCC 4.3.1 20080507 (prerelease) [gcc-4_3-branch revision 135036]] on
linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from paraview import servermanager
>>> connection = servermanager.Connect()
>>> sph = servermanager.sources.SphereSource()
>>> shrinkMe = servermanager.filters.ShrinkFilter(Input=sph)
>>> view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
>>> rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(shrinkMe,view)
vtkSphereSource : [ ...........]
vtkShrinkFilter : [ ...........]
>>> view.StillRender()
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
vtkPVGeometryFilter : [ ...........]
vtkPVGeometryFilter : [ ...........]
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]

    This gives me nicely shrink - filtered sphere, with my ViewSize = 
[100,100] and ViewPosition = [0,0], appearing on my screen.

    Then I click with my mouse on the console of the standalone
interpreter or the pvpython console, thus placing my RenderView vtk
window in the background on my desktop.


After that I write in the python console:

>>> view.ViewSize
Property name= ViewSize value = [400, 400]
>>> view.ViewSize = [600,600]
>>> view.ResetCamera()
>>> view.StillRender()
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]

and this should change my rendering view window size, reset the camera
and render it on my screen. Nothing happens. 

I click on the vtk window in order to bring it to foreground, and i see
that the view window size has changed, but everything is black. 

I decide to save the image, so i execute:

>>> view.WriteImage('notAgain.png','vtkPNGWriter')
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
0

and something appears only for a fraction of a second. 
When I try to render the view again,

>>> view.StillRender()
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
>>> 


IT RENDERS FINE .

I am really new at all this, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong: I'm
following the book and the tutorials word by word. I really need help
with this, since I would like to use the scripting capability of
Paraview to automate animation process of simulation results on a large
cluster for my student project.

I thought I didn't update the visualisation pipeline, but from what I've
read in the Paraview Guide book, it updates automatically when rendering
occurs.

I'm running 32 bit OpenSUSE and Paraview3-3-cvs that came with OpenFOAM
1.5 installation.

Thank You.

Subject: [Paraview] Error on opening python shell in Paraview 3.4.0
Message-ID: <49320D5F.70204@web.de>

Two questions:

1. I get the following error as I open the python shell in Paraview 3.4.0

Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Feb 21 2008, 13:11:45) [MSC v.1310 32 bit 
(Intel)] on win32
 >>> from paraview import servermanager
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
   File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 
3.4.0\lib\paraview-3.4\paraview\servermanager.py", line 43, in <module>
     import re, os, new, exceptions, sys, vtk
   File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 
3.4.0\lib\paraview-3.4\paraview\vtk.py", line 9, in <module>
     from vtkCommonPython import *
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

What's gone wrong?


2. With which servermanager source should VTP files be read? I've tried 
XMLPPolyDataReader but it didn't work i.e. 
servermanager.sources.XMLPPolyDataReader(...)

Thanks,

Is there a way of turning parts of a PVD file on or off? (in cases of 
clutter)

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] beginner: paraview python scripting, camera orientation
Message-ID: <1228067478.10665.8.camel@localhost>

Hello,


    I've noticed that if I make an active camera object

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

camera = view.GetActiveCamera(),

there is a method camera.GetOrientation(), and even
camera.GetOrientationWXYZ, but no SetOrientation(), or
SetOrientationWXYZ(), or even camera.Orientation proxy Class attribute.
My question is: if I'm viewing result data from simulating a physical
process, is there a way to set the camera angles via its orientation
regarding the coordinate axes? The physical process is important,
because I can take direction of the gravity, or other vector (initial
velociy) from some outside file and use it to set camera orientation. Is
there a way to do this and still have all the data displayed within the
RenderingView(Window)?

Thank You,


Tomislav

Subject: [Paraview] vtkTree file problem with Paraview
Message-ID: <553AC7FB9C524A84AF2C384128324F1F@deis1a9cd2755a>

Dear all,

I'm developing an application using InfoVis package distributed with VTK.
With my application I succesfully generate and visualize some vtkTree files using vtkTreeWriter and setting the extension of the file to vtk (ex. MyTree.vtk).

Now I'd like to use paraview/overview (3.5.0) package in order to open the vtkTree files generated with my application.
I sucessufully compiled all paraview/overview pakage, I included all the plug in...but when I try to open my vtkTree files it give me an error.
It says it cant recognize the data type TREE.

Is it normal?..May it's becouse the vtkTreeReader is not included in the package?...

I also tryed to create a plug in for vtkTreeReader....

Here is the code:
----------------------
CMAKELIST
----------------------
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(vtkTreeReader "1.0" 
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML vtkTreeReader.xml
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES vtkTreeReaderGUI.xml)

-------------------------------------
vtkTreeReader.xml

------------------------------------
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
   <SourceProxy name="vtkTreeReader" 
                class="vtkTreeReader"
                label="VTK Tree reader">
     <Documentation
       short_help="Read a VTK Tree file."
       long_help="Read a VTK Tree file.">
       Read a VTK Tree file The default file extension is .vtk.
     </Documentation>
     <StringVectorProperty
        name="FileName"
        animateable="0"
        command="SetFileName"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <FileListDomain name="files"/>
        <Documentation>
          This property specifies the file name for the VTK TREE reader.
        </Documentation>
     </StringVectorProperty>
   <!-- End VTKTreeReader -->
   </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

-------------------------------------
vtkTreeReaderGUI.xml
------------------------------------
<ParaViewReaders>
  <Reader name="TreeReader" extensions="vtk" file_description="VTK Trees">
  </Reader>
</ParaViewReaders>



It sucessfully complile but when i try to open the file it give me the same error. The vtkTree file extension is also not present in the list of file type supported.
Any Idea?
I tryed to open the file also with overview but it  happen the same.

Thank you

Matteo
