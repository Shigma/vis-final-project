Subject: [Paraview] Compiling ParaView on MacOSX10.2
Message-ID: <3DEF9EFD.3020709@mac.com>

I managed to build a CMakeCache.txt file that shows ParaView where all 
the OSX libraries are (copied most of it from the CMakeCache.txt file I 
used successfully with VTK) but when making I get the error message:

/Develop/ParaView/Widgets/vtkKWView.cxx: In member function `int
    vtkKWView::ShouldIAbort()':
/Develop/ParaView/Widgets/vtkKWView.cxx:366: `XSync' undeclared (first 
use this
    function)
/Develop/ParaView/Widgets/vtkKWView.cxx:366: (Each undeclared identifier is
    reported only once for each function it appears in.)
/Develop/ParaView/Widgets/vtkKWView.cxx:367: `XCheckIfEvent' undeclared 
(first
    use this function)
make[3]: *** [vtkKWView.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [default_target] Error 2
make[1]: *** [default_target_Widgets] Error 2
make: *** [default_target] Error 2

I know that XSync and XCheckIfEvent are X-windows calls, but I've put 
the X windows library inclusions into the CMakeCache.txt file as:

//X11 extra flags.
CMAKE_X_CFLAGS:STRING= -I/usr/X11R6/include

//Libraries and options used in X11 programs.
CMAKE_X_LIBS:STRING=' -lSM -lICE  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lXext '

so I don't know why vtkKWView.cxx can't find them.  I even tried pasting 
them into the Makefile in the Widgets directory to no avail.  Does 
anyone have any info that could help me with this?  Thanks in advance.

Hi,
	Does anyone know where I can get hold of a definition of the
parallel file formats used by paraview/VTK?
	Also I was wanting to add the functionality of a stereoscopic
display to paraview, can anyone comment on how straight forward this may, or
may not, be?

Many thanks

We are working on it. It will be out with or before the next User's
Guide, probably in a few weeks. It will be on the web.

Depends. On a single processor (and assuming that VTK support the
stereo mode you are interested in), it would require a few lines of
change. It is also easy when running in parallel and using collect
(rendering locally on the first process). However, running in parallel
and using sort-last compositing, it would be a lot tougher. I think the
z-buffer is handled differently when in stereo mode and the compositing
code has to be made aware of this.

We have never built ParaView on Mac OS X so I have little experience.
It sounds like ParaView is not getting the X related flags from VTK.
Did you build VTK using X or Quartz ? Can you describe in detail
how you configured/built VTK and ParaView and send your cache files ?

This is the problem. ParaView does not compile or work well with Quartz
(yet) because:

1. Tcl/Tk for native OS X is not there yet. There are still things that
behave differently than on X or Windows or things that don't work at
all,
2. We had no time/resources to make the necessary changes to the
ParaView source

If you have X installed and working on your Mac, you can build VTK
and ParaView with X and then ParaView should work ok. I think there has
been discussions on the VTK mailing list on how to do it.

Hi,

I'm just starting out with ParaView but haven't got very far.

My platform is an SGI Onyx running IRIX v.6.5 and I'm using the SGI
compilers.

I've downloaded and compiled the 'complete' distribution and have now got
a (32-bit) binary called ParaView in my ParaViewComplete06/bin directory.

I haven't managed to find any instructions on what I do with this so I
tried just executing it and simply got a "Killed" message.  The syslog
reveals:

Dec 12 16:53:53 5E:bezier login[5827348]: Created Job Container -
0x4edd0000000050 bf
Dec 12 16:55:30 1A:bezier unix: |$(0x6dd)ALERT:

badvaddr 0x1458 9948
Dec 12 16:55:30 6A:bezier unix: Process has been
killed to prevent infinite loop

I'd be grateful for any suggestions as to where I might be going wrong.

Many thanks,

Andrew.

A few questions:

1. Have you tried the binary distribution ?
2. Are you using a special environment to launch ParaView ? The errors
you posted look very unfamiliar

Any information you can give about your environment would help.

I have now. It launches OK but I've had it seg. fault on me a couple of
times as I try and learn how to use it. (e.g. launch Paraview, click the
'calculator icon' and then click the 'cut plane' icon).

> 2. Are you using a special environment to launch ParaView ? The errors

Nope, as far as I know my environment is quite standard.  I've tried
launching Paraview without any of the personalisation that normally
happens when I log in to the machine in question and I got the same error.

> Any information you can give about your environment would help.

Right, I'm using the tcsh on IRIX 6.5.17f.  I'm using the SGI compilers:

MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.3.1.3m

for both c++ and c compilation.

Let me know it there's anything else that would be useful.

Thanks,

Andrew..

If you added a reader, the source menu will not change. The readers
do not appear in the sources menu but in the open file dialog. Try
adding some dummy source and see if it appears in the sources menu.
If it does, then your reader configuration is being parsed too and
the extension should be one of the options in the open dialog.

Yeah, this is a known problem. We didn't have time to fix before
the release. Normally, those buttons should not be active when there
is no dataset selected and stop you from clicking them unless you
created a source or read a file. This is already fixed and will
not happen in the next release.

I don't understand what is happening. ParaView 0.6 was built on various
SGIs and as far as I know you are the first one to run into this 
problem. I recommend sticking with the binary release for now.

Hi May, 

ParaView natively does not support HDF5 formats. We are working on
adding HDF5 file support though. Do you have an example HDF5 file that
you would like to explore?

Currently you need to use a file translator (hdf5 to vtk). The open
