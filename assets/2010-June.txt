Subject: [Paraview] Enabling vtkSplineFilter in ParaView
Message-ID: <AANLkTinxXF8NddPL6eIz3PUuj4IFe2Y-BYhK8uwyzPsU@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was able to enable the vtkSplineFilter in ParaView-3.7 with the
attached ServerManager XML. But with the current 3.9, I am having a
segfault after the filter updates. Here is the WinXP32 call stack
after the segfault :

 	ntdll.dll!7c91120e()

 	00e08ac8()	

Note that I also get this segfault in Fedora 12.

I certainly missed something in the XML that was not fatal with the
previous PV version. Please, could someone take a look at my XML, try
it and tell if this is reproducible?

Thanks a lot!

Hi Biddiscombe,

I do a similar thing. But I use a Qt thread instead of a timer. The thread
controls the entire progress. I define a iteration steps in the thread,
e.g.,1024. In each iteration, the thread triggers the slot accept() method
(in ParaView3/Qt/Components/pqObjectInspectorWidget), in which the pipeline
is forced to update, then the source will call its RequestData() method and
invoke the simulation program to get the data. Maybe it is more appropriate
to let the simulation the control the entire progress, that is, when one
step simulation is done, then it will notify the ParaView to do the
corresponding rendering stuff. I just do it in the reverse way, because it
is easier to implement.

========================

//the added thread class

pqSimulationThread::pqSimulationThread(pqObjectInspectorWidget* _gui){
this->gui=_gui;
connect(this,SIGNAL(oneStepSimulationFinished()),this->gui,SLOT(accept()));
}

pqSimulationThread::~pqSimulationThread(){
}

void pqSimulationThread::run(){

for(int i=0;i<NUM_ITERATION;i++){
emit this->oneStepSimulationFinished();

//for synchronization
mutex.lock();
renderringFinishedCondatin.wait(&mutex);
mutex.unlock();
}
}

=======================

// in the method accept() of pqObjectInspectorWidget

//force the pipeline to update
// i add a property to the source
//and any filters used will need this property too

source->pqProxy::setModifiedState(pqProxy::MODIFIED);
vtkSMSourceProxy * vp  = vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(source->getProxy());
vp->InvokeCommand("FakePropertyForUpdate");

=======================

Then do some other little changes it will work with the simulation program.
I hope this can be of some help.

By the way, I hate the added property "FakePropertyForUpdate" , but I do not
know how to remove it . I have tried many other methods to force the
pipeline to update but got nothing good. And I also want to change the logic
to be more natural, that is, let the simulation program to control the whole
progress. I appreciate any help from anybody.

Thanks.

Hi again !

I tried to replace the SplineFilter with a ProgrammableFilter
containing the following script :

input = self.GetInput()
splineFilter = vtk.vtkSplineFilter()
splineFilter.SetInput( input )
splineFilter.SetSubdivideToLength()
splineFilter.SetLength( 1 )
splineFilter.Update( )
self.GetOutput().DeepCopy(splineFilter.GetOutput())

This way, I am able to get a spline-based resampling. It means that my
XML description contains an error, but I cannot find it.

Hi,
The error related to command prompt was removed.
But now during building I am getting 80% of the projects as failed with
many types of errors.

Please could you give me the exact link (other than the wiki page for
build and install) to build it from scratch again.
The specifications of my computer are:
Windows XP.

For building and installation required softwares in my computer:
Qt version 4.6.2/Qt SDK by Nokia v2010.02.1 (open source)
Cmake 2.6-patch 4
MPICH2
Python version 2.6.5
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Version 8.0.50727.42

I had many problems when configuring the source in Cmake mainly with what
parameters to change and to what value should i change them to.

Please help me out as I have wasted many hours in just building the
software on my system without any success.

One doubt: Pleae could you tell me that can I add programmble filters in
the .exe version of paraview 3.8.0.

Thank you in advance

Regards
Rhushabh Bhandari

The Wiki page pretty much covers all that's necessary to build the
software. You'll have to be a bit more elaborate than "many types of
errors" before we can offer some concrete help. Are you using Qt
binaries downloaded from Nokia's website? As mentioned on their
download page, Nokia's binaries are built using MinGW and cannot be
used with Visual Studio builds. You need to build Qt from source using
visual studio.

Yes, you can add python programmable filters in the .exe version of ParaView.

Correction: the SDK Nokia distributes is MinGW based, but they have
libraries for VS 2008 also. For VS 2005, however you'll have to build
Qt from source.

Subject: [Paraview] Finite-size voxels and Point vs. Cell Centered Image Data
Message-ID: <4B0FD1AF-42A1-4BD5-8510-770A95F1F6F1@ucalgary.ca>

What is the standard way to represent image data in VTK/ParaView, where the image data is intended to represent finite sized voxels?  Here the 3D image data represent values at the centre of voxels (or presumably some sort of weighted value centred on the voxel centre).

This may seem like a trivial question, however I am unable to obtain the behaviour that seems most appropriate.  For example, suppose I want to display all voxels in a (3D) image that exceed a certain threshold value.  The obvious thing to do seems to be to save the data in a VTK .vti file and then use the Theshold filter in ParaView.  The Threshold filter will display Cells, or not display Cells, depending on the threshold.  But Cells of a vtkDataObject are hexagons connecting the points, not hexagons centred on the points.  (There is an option "All Scalars" for the Threshold filter which determines how the cell value is calculated from the neighbouring point values, but it has no effect on the location of the cell.)

One possibility may be that we are storing the image data incorrectly in the .vti file.  Right now we have are generating the data as vtkImageSource with Scalar Point Data.  Perhaps it would be more logical to generate and save this as vtkImageSource with Scalar Cell Data, and indeed the ParaView documentation seems to imply this (see http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/XMLImageDataReader.html ).  However, vtkImageSource does not seem to be intended to be used in this way.  In the vtkImageData implementation, all the methods that access "scalar" data do not check for the existence of Scalars for Cell Data, but instead always access the Point Data Scalars, like this:

  vtkDataArray *scalars = this->GetPointData()->GetScalars();

Or to present this another way, consider the trivial example of a single voxel.  We would like to have this represented as a finite size box, but the data is inherently a single value.  Here is some example VTK python code that attempts to generate a single voxel:

  image = vtk.vtkImageData()
  image.SetScalarTypeToInt()
  image.SetSpacing (1, 1, 1)
  image.SetOrigin (0, 0, 0)
  image.SetDimensions (1, 1, 1)
  image.SetScalarComponentFromFloat (0,0,0,0,10)
  print image.GetBounds()

The output for the bounds is:

(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

This is not necessarily incorrect in the right context.  One example of such a context might be the case where the image data represent discrete samples taken at distinct points in space.  However it does seem inappropriate for data meant to represent voxels as small volume elements (e.g. most medical images), where we would like a single voxel to have finite real-space bounds and be displayed as such.  I have again the feeling that vtkImageData is not the appropriate object to use to represent voxel data, but I don't know what the correct alternative would be (something with scalar cell data presumably).

As an aside, if you save the above image object with vtkXMLImageDataWriter, the file can't even be opened in ParaView 3.18.0, as the following error occurs:

ERROR: In /Users/eric/source/ParaView-3.8.0/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 286
vtkTexturePainter (0x11de86350): Incorrect dimensionality.

However, a vtkImageData object with 2x2x2 dimensions can be opened and will display (using for example the Threshold filter) as a 1x1x1 box in ParaView.

Any insight would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Eric

Hello,

in vtkImageData, "Dimension" is the number of points along each axis,
not the number of cells along each axis. If you want one voxel, then
you need 2x2x2 points.
Note that using GetDimension() is OK but SetDimension() is only here
for backward compatibility, use SetExtent() instead:

image->SetExtent(0,1,0,1,0,1);

Hi,

I have seen this error mostly relating to a plugin being loaded on the 
client side but not the server side. It looks like 
vtk1DTransferFunctionFilter, is part of a PointSprite plugin. You could 
check the tools->plugin manager dialog to see if the client and server 
have the same plugins loaded?

It would also be helpful to know what type of file have you tried to open?

good luck
Burlen

Message-ID: <4C055B98.30604@yahoo.de>

 Thanks Eric, all,

but this does not seem to work at all. My loop looks something like this:

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
if input.IsA("vtkMultiBlockDataSet"):
    iter = input.NewIterator()
    iter.UnRegister(None)
    iter.InitTraversal()
    i=1
    while not iter.IsDoneWithTraversal():
        curInput = iter.GetCurrentDataObject()
        curInformation = curInput.GetInformation()
        print i
        print iter.GetCurrentMetaData()
        # This is where I want to query for the current name, line does
not work....
        print iter.GetCurrentMetaData().Get(iter.GetCurrentMetaData.NAME)
        i=i+1
        iter.GoToNextItem();

The output of print iter.GetCurrentMetaData() looks like this:

vtkInformation (0x3808f00)
Debug: Off
Modified Time: 269417
Reference Count: 2
Registered Events: (none)
DONT_PRUNE: 1
NAME: my_given_name

I want to work wit the "NAME" attribute ('my_given_name in this case)
but I don't know how...?

Francois,

Thank you for the reply.

Using 2x2x2 points for one voxel is fine in principle.  The difficulty is, you can't really conveniently (as far as I can tell) use a vtkImageData object for this purpose.  Because now of course our scalar image data needs to be associated with cells, not to points.  But vtkImageData in many cases only deals with the scalar data attached to the PointData.  For example, this is from vtkImageData.cxx :

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This method returns a pointer to the origin of the vtkImageData.
void *vtkImageData::GetScalarPointer()
{
  if (this->PointData->GetScalars() == NULL)
    {
    vtkDebugMacro("Allocating scalars in ImageData");
    this->AllocateScalars();
    }
  return this->PointData->GetScalars()->GetVoidPointer(0);
}

Notice that is method just grabs the Scalars from PointData, and other methods of vtkImageData are similar, so if you want to store the scalars in CellData, which is necessary represent voxels, it is quite difficult.

Eric

Hi Eric,
> Because now of course our scalar image data needs to be associated with cells, not to points.  But vtkImageData in many cases only deals with the scalar data attached to the PointData.
Could you use the concept of a dual grid? In other words make your vis 
grid node centered with the nodes located on the cell centers of your 
computational grid? Your arrays end up in PointData that way with no 
interpolations required.

Burlen,

I assume by dual grid you mean creating two vtkImageData objects, which both contain pointers (properly registered and reference counted) to the same vtkDataArray object, but in one case, as the Scalars for the CellData, and in the other case as the Scalars for the PointsData.  This might work, although it does seem unnecessarily complicated for "storing voxels as volume elements" which would seem to be a common usage.  And I'm not sure it answers all the questions such as, how would you write the data to a file?  If you want it accurately rendered in ParaView, it needs to be stored with CellData Scalars, but that could be problematic if you (or someone else) wants to read it and process it with VTK again.

Also there seems to be no guarantee that vtkImageData won't clobber your CellData Scalars when you're not looking.  Consider the following method copied from vtkImageData.cxx .  I have no idea when this might be called, but notice that PointData Scalars will survive it, while CellData Scalars won't.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Graphics filters reallocate every execute.  Image filters try to reuse
// the scalars.
void vtkImageData::PrepareForNewData()
{
  // free everything but the scalars
  vtkDataArray *scalars = this->GetPointData()->GetScalars();
  if (scalars)
    {
    scalars->Register(this);
    }
  this->Initialize();
  if (scalars)
    {
    this->GetPointData()->SetScalars(scalars);
    scalars->UnRegister(this);
    }
}

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling error with 3.8.0
Message-ID: <BAY148-w520077CD1D370E9A609DBB2EF0@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I have downloaded the 3.8 release source from the download page and I try to compile it on Mac OS X Leopard, using the classic cmake porcedure that has been successful with the 3.6.2 but I get a surprising error:

[ 34%] Building CXX object VTK/VolumeRendering/CMakeFiles/vtkVolumeRenderingPython.dir/vtkVolumeRenderingPythonInit.cxx.o
Linking CXX shared module ../../bin/libvtkVolumeRenderingPython.so
[ 34%] Built target vtkVolumeRenderingPython

  Reason: image not found

make: *** [all] Error 2
Macintosh-3:ParaView3_BUILD$ find . -name "*libvtksys*"
./bin/libvtksys.dylib
./bin/libvtksys.pv3.8.dylib

So the required library is available in ./bin, which should be included in the path to search for librairies, but it does not work.
What should I do to solve this issue?

Turn VTK_USE_RPATH to ON or export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to your bin dir.

Hi,

I tried to load gzipped NRRD file in Paraview, but it can't recognize the
image saying that

Is there a way to load 'gzipped' image files? I need it to save my local

Thanks in advance,

Hi Eric,
> I assume by dual grid you mean creating two vtkImageData objects
No. I mean to suggest place the nodes of the vis grid (your 
vtkImageData) at the cell centers of the computation grid (what you have 
on disk). When you do this, you no longer have cell data, instead you 
have point data, which is what vtk needs.

I am attaching an illustration from an 2d cell centered AMR grid, but 
the idea is the same for 3D cell centered data on a uniform grid. See 
figs a and d.

This might work, although it does seem unnecessarily complicated for "storing voxels as volume elements" which would seem to be a common usage.  And I'm not sure it answers all the questions such as, how would you write the data to a file?  If you want it accurately rendered in ParaView, it needs to be stored with CellData Scalars, but that could be problematic if you (or someone else) wants to read it and process it with VTK again.

I have no idea when this might be called, but notice that PointData Scalars will survive it, while CellData Scalars won't.

Turn VTK_USE_RPATH to ON or export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to your bin dir.

So the required library is available in ./bin, which should be included in the path to search for librairies, but it does not work.
What should I do to solve this issue?

Hi,

I've just tried building against v3.8 of paraview and I am getting a load
error for some remote plugins.  It complains about an undefined symbol -
"vtkPVGUIPluginInterface".  Is anyone else experiencing this?  I'm running
the linux version.

Message-ID: <SNT123-W15196FC782A31514774A45BCD00@phx.gbl>


Hi!

It seems that the Plot Over Line filter is buggy in 3.8.0 - I built ParaView from source and applying the Plot Over Line filter to a 2D dataset, I get the following error message:

X Error: GLXUnsupportedPrivateRequest 156
  Extension:    149 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 16 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x570

Apart from that, it does plot something and it seems to be correct, but the display resolution is really low. 

Do you know what could be causing this?

thx
Natalie

Have tried clean building your plugin? Can you post the CMakeLists.txt
for your plugin?

Did you by any chance turn the cmake variable: VTK_USE_VIEWS off? If
so, it must be ON.

Burlen,

I think that's the way to go.  However, it is still necessary to use scalars on CellData to get correct rendering.  Actually, for most filters, CellData scalars vtkImageData does work correctly.  However, it is easy to convert from PointData scalars data to CellData scalars, and since the underlying array of data is the same, there is no loss of efficiency (just some loss of programming clarity) .  This is the approach I've gone with.  Here's an example (single pixel, just to be as simple as possible).

// Create point-centered vtkImageData (single-pixel)
vtkImageData* imageAsPointCentered = vtkImageData::New();
imageAsPointCentered->SetScalarTypeToInt();
imageAsPointCentered->SetSpacing (1, 1, 1);
imageAsPointCentered->SetOrigin (0, 0, 0);
imageAsPointCentered->SetDimensions (1, 1, 1);  // SetExtent would be better
imageAsPointCentered->SetScalarComponentFromFloat (0,0,0,0,10);

// Do something with the point-centered vtkImageData here.

// Time to render, make a cell-centered vtkImageData of the same data.
vtkImageData* imageAsCellCentered = vtkImageData::New();
imageAsCellCentered->SetSpacing (1, 1, 1);
imageAsCellCentered->SetOrigin (-0.5,-0.5, -0.5);
imageAsCellCentered->SetDimensions (2, 2, 2);
imageAsCellCentered->GetCellData()->SetScalars (imageAsPointCentered->GetPointData()->GetScalars());

// Now render imageAsCellCentered / save to open in ParaView, etc...

cheers,
Eric

This might work, although it does seem unnecessarily complicated for "storing voxels as volume elements" which would seem to be a common usage.  And I'm not sure it answers all the questions such as, how would you write the data to a file?  If you want it accurately rendered in ParaView, it needs to be stored with CellData Scalars, but that could be problematic if you (or someone else) wants to read it and process it with VTK again.

I am not sure what you mean by really low. I wrote a lot of the code for the
new 2D charts in ParaView 3.8.0. Could you send me an email off list with a
screenshot demonstrating what you mean?

The output from glxinfo and a little more information about the distro you
are using, and your graphics card/driver would help.

Thanks,

Utkarsh,

I can make my plugins work by adding pqComponents to the
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES.  Should this be necessary?

Paul

Ah...the problem is due to the fact that ${OUTSRCS} was passed in as
SOURCES and not GUI_SOURCES. Actually, any Qt based classes should be
passed in as GUI_SOURCES. So try the following:

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MeshCutter "1.0"
                    GUI_INTERFACES ${OUTIFACES}
                    SERVER_MANAGER_XML MeshCutterSM.xml
                    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMeshCutter.cxx
vtkAxialRadial.cxx vtkTheta.cxx vtkRadius.cxx vtkRadiusSource.cxx
vtkRadiusRepresentation.cxx vtkRadiusWidget.cxx
                    GUI_SOURCES pqRadiusWidget.cxx ${MOC_SRCS}
${OUTSRCS} ${UIC_SRCS})

What specifically isn't correct when rendering with point vs cell data? 
As far as I know both approach are equally valid and produce correct 
results.

This is the approach I've gone with.  Here's an example (single pixel, just to be as simple as possible).

Hi!

It seems that the Plot Over Line filter is buggy in 3.8.0 - I built ParaView from source and applying the Plot Over Line filter to a 2D dataset, I get the following error message:

X Error: GLXUnsupportedPrivateRequest 156
  Extension:    149 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 16 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x570

Apart from that, it does plot something and it seems to be correct, but the display resolution is really low.

I am not sure what you mean by really low. I wrote a lot of the code for the new 2D charts in ParaView 3.8.0. Could you send me an email off list with a screenshot demonstrating what you mean?

Do you know what could be causing this?

The output from glxinfo and a little more information about the distro you are using, and your graphics card/driver would help.

Thanks,

Marcus

Burlen,

Yes, both are correct.  But they render differently, so depending on the context, you either want definitely one or the other.

Again, the simplest example is a single voxel.  If you put the scalar data array (which in this example is a single value) on the Points, you have 1x1x1 Points, and zero cells, and bounds of (0,0,0,0,0,0) .  (So nothing is rendered.)  If you put the data array (which a single value) in the Cells, you have 2x2x2 Points (but still a single Scalar value, and no Point coordinates are actually stored in vtkImageData, so it's not actually "bigger"), and one cell, and bounds of (-0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5,-0.5,-0.5).  Of course the exact bounds will depend on the origin and spacing.  For the purposes of "voxel as volume element", the latter is better, since one voxel should have, and be displayed as having, a finite volume.

cheers,
Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Creating vtkTable with programmable filter
Message-ID: <999820.96747.qm@web24202.mail.ird.yahoo.com>



I have a progammable filter that produces a Python list. I want to
write this list into a vtkTable, make this the output of the
programmableFilter and show it after execution.

Writing data into table works this way (output of the programmable
filter needs to be avtkTable in GUI):

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
# VTK arrays for columns
name = vtk.vtkStringArray()
name.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
name.SetNumberOfTuples(len(results))
name.SetName("Component Name")

# fill it with data from Python-List here (skipped)

output.AddColumn(name)

Problems:

	* Table is not shown after filter but has to be opened up manually
by the user
	* Additional Error message (however, everything looks fine):
ERROR: In /../vtkExecutive.cxx, line 757
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x2b98f3c0): Algorithm
vtkPVGeometryFilter(0x2b96fe20) returned failure for request:

  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)

Any hints? Thanks Bastian

I have trouble with the vistrails-Plugin in 3.8.0


	* To compile it I needed to rename the variable "linux" since this name
seems to be reserved....
	* Afterwards I can load the shared object file but paraview hangs
afterwards and the output windows tells me that it is trying to connect
to a vistrails server repeatingling.
Am I doning somthing wrong?

Dear all,

I fill very surprised that *nobody* has to resample some data inside
ParaView. Several threads deal with enabling some VTK filters in
ParaView that actually change the extent of the input image (just as
vtkImageResample), but when the output extent is higher that input,
there is a strange behaviour. Sorry for being lazy: the problem was
described in the following threads.
   http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-May/017309.html

Please, tell me if I am doing something wrong in the XML, if I am
stupid, if this is a known limitation of ParaView, if I am not sending
to the right mailing list, if [put your own proposition].

Thanks for all, and best regards.

Hi Bastian,

The Vistrails plugin attempts to launch the Vistrails application when
loaded. If you want to build your own version of the plugin then you will

Subject: [Paraview] Checkboxes missing in Object Inspector
Message-ID: <201006022306.03732.bart.vanstratum@wur.nl>

Hi,

I installed ParaView 3.8.0 this afternoon as a tool to plot 3D output fields of a meteorological model and I'm having some problems with the Object Inspector. I'm trying to plot some fields of a a NetCDF file which works fine on another system that I have access to (Arch Linux with ParaView 3.6.2), but on my own system (OpenSUSE 11.2, KDE 4.3, ParaView 3.8.0) the checkboxes for each variable are missing (see: http://files.vanstratum.com/ParaView_checkboxes.png). I've been struggling with this for quite a while, but can't seem to get it fixed. 

Is this a known problem, or am I doing something wrong?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Bart van Stratum

Another one:

    /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Xdmf/libvtkXdmfPython.so

is installed on a 64-bit machine instead of in /usr/lib64/...

Sorry, that one is okay. Not that pvbatch-real (and others) is installed in 
/usr/lib64/paraview/ as requested, just not paraview-real.  Looks like an 
issue of some kind with add_executable_with_forwarding2?

ParaView-3.8.0/CMake/ParaViewBranding.cmake:
   add_executable_with_forwarding2(pv_exe_suffix
                  "${PARAVIEW_LIBRARY_DIRS}"
                  "../${PARAVIEW_INSTALL_LIB_DIR}"
                  "${BPC_INSTALL_LIB_DIR}"
                  ${BPC_NAME} WIN32 ${MAKE_BUNDLE}
                  ${BPC_NAME}_main.cxx
                  ${exe_icon}
                  ${apple_bundle_sources}
                  ${qt_menu_nib_sources}
                  ${EXE_SRCS}
                  )

ParaView-3.8.0/ParaViewConfig.cmake.in:
# The locations/prefixes where this version of ParaView would be installed.
SET (PARAVIEW_INSTALL_LIB_DIR "@PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR@")

Perhaps this isn't getting evaluated in the correct order?

Hi All,
I am building ParaView 3.8.0 from source on a Windows7 64bit machine

I ran into a lot of compilation errors regarding redefinitions in

I have made sure before every #include <windows.h> there is #include 
<WinSock2.h>. But that did not mitigate the problem. Can anyone help 
please? Thanks a lot.

Joohwi,

I'm afraid that when I recently implemented that NRRD reader, I only implemented a subset that read raw image files.  I did not use the NRRD library because it does not support parallel file reads, which is something that I need to do.  Rather, the current implementation simply reads NNRD header files and passes that information to the raw image reader code.

To implement an NRRD reader that reads the gzipped image files, the easiest path would be to implement a new reader that used the NRRD library.  This reader would necessarily be nonparallel, and therefore restrictive in other ways.

-------------------------------------------
There are several issues in this simple log:
-First the install procedure for the QT libraries doesn't seem to respect the 
DESTDIR variables.
-Second why the heck do you want to have a copy of the QT libraries provided 
by the system inside the paraview library folder? It was not needed by 
paraview 3.6.x and if it is needed now, it means something is seriously 
broken.

Hi Francois,

I apologize for the errors. In 3.8 we reorganized alot of the logic for
building ParaView. Previously the install rules for Qt where only run when
making a redistributable binary of ParaView for our users to download from
our webpage. Now they always get run.

A quick fix for this would be to edit Line 103 of
Applications\ParaView\CMakeLists.txt and set _install_qt_libs to OFF.

SET(_install_qt_libs OFF)

We will find a better solution tomorrow. I am assuming your are just setting
DESTDIR and running 'make install'?

That's odd. Try running paraview with  "-dr" command line option. Does
that help?

I just realised that the last few lines about sqldrivers are actually copies
from qt-sql. Your fix will get rid of these too.
What are the requirements of the paraview QT4 client in terms of sql?
Does it rely on any particular sql implementation? 
On gentoo a user can choose which backend they want to install individually.
What happens if qt-sql is not present at all?

Hi Utkarsh,

unfortunately that didn't work. 
I just realized that ParaView 3.8.0 is based on a newer version of QT (4.6.2, I have 4.5.3 installed), perhaps that is causing the problem. I'll try to install a newer version this evening, see if that works.

	PointSpriteDemo
Message-ID: <201006031853.52438.f.r.bissey@massey.ac.nz>

Hi again,

I have the following in my log while preparing the gentoo package
for paraview:
-- Installing: /media/anthill/portage/sci-
visualization/paraview-3.8.0/image/usr/lib/paraview-3.8/libPointSprite_Graphics.so
-- Installing: /media/anthill/portage/sci-
visualization/paraview-3.8.0/image/media/anthill/portage/sci-
visualization/paraview-3.8.0/work/ParaView-3.8.0_build/Plugins/PointSprite/PointSpriteDemo
-- Installing: /media/anthill/portage/sci-
visualization/paraview-3.8.0/image/usr/lib/paraview-3.8/libPointSprite_Plugin.so

PointSpriteDemo is the only one with that behaviour out of the stuff I checked
so far.
Also, it is an example and I have turned examples off (BUILD_EXAMPLES OFF) but
this particular one is always on, from "Plugins/PointSprite/CMakeList.txt":

set(PointSpritePlugin_BUILD_EXAMPLES ON CACHE BOOL "Build the example.")
if(PointSpritePlugin_BUILD_EXAMPLES)
    add_subdirectory(Examples)
endif(PointSpritePlugin_BUILD_EXAMPLES)

This is not consistent, if I turn off examples at the top level I expect them 
to be all off.

I select the x-axis with with

point 2 = 25
the plot is correct but when I save data (csv)
And plot the csv data, the xmin is 0 and not 0.5
This feature worked correctly in 3.4.0 for example.
Any ideas as to the problem?

Hello,
Did anybody try to compile PV with MinGW?
I already spent a couple of hours trying to cope with this error, without any success.
It seems that the required option "--enable-auto-import" is not forwarded to the linker, although I put it everywhere that makes sense in the cmake configuration file.
I don't know is this is a PV, a CMake or a MinGW issue.
Any help?

Thanks Dave,

I got them from here:

http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/ParaView_Plugin

The source code also contains a version of vistrails. Ok and there it stands: I have to copy this vistrails Installation to the Paraview Plugins Directory. I will try this out, missed that.

Are there reasons why it is hiden so good? It has been presented in "The Source" 1/2010, so I expected it to be official?

Thanks Bastian

Betreff: Re: [Paraview] WG: Problems with vistrails-Plugin in 3.8.0

Hi Bastian,

The Vistrails plugin attempts to launch the Vistrails application when loaded. If you want to build your own version of the plugin then you will also need to build the Vistrails application. I believe these are the latest instructions: http://vistrails.org/index.php/Building_From_Source

I am curious where you got the plugin source code? I don't think I included it in any of the ParaView source tar files?

Subject: [Paraview] Why does paraview want to install its own duplicate

ParaView doesn't directly need sql. QtHelp uses the sql for the help
(the help that pops up when you hit F1). So long as Qt can find and
use SQL, I think ParaView should be fine.

Good catch. I've committed a fix to the master. Dave can you move it
to the release branch as well.
Attached is the patch.

commit 07ba5364f3ab16d33e7ae7c67f64c4b25e2de11f
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>

    Paraview clients were ignoring set install path.

    The ParaView custom clients were not passing the PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR to the
    build_paraview_client macro. As a consequence it was doing the
default thing.
    Fixed that.

What you need to do is create a new resource (qrc) file with your icon
and then refer to the qrc in your ui file. Look at the CMakeLists.txt
in Qt/Core or Qt/Components to see how to compile a qrc file.

Stephen,
What do you mean by "select the x-axis"? Are you setting the Point 1
and Point 2 x-coordinates on the "Plot Over Line" fiter  or is that
the range for the x-axis on the line plot (set using the view settings
dialog)? I am assuming you mean the former. In that case, when the CSV
is loaded back in, by default the plot uses arc-length as the x-axis
for the line plot. Go to the display tab and choose the x-axis to be
"Points:0" and you'll see that the xmin is 0.5.

Okay, this is cherry-picked onto the release branch as well.

Jerome,

You may want to look at VTK/Hybrid/vtkImageDataLIC2D.cxx to see how it
plays tricks with the extent-translator to generate images with larger
extent when magnification > 1.

PV 3.8.0 is ok, I miscounted the number of columns when making a gnuplot 
(I plotted col 16 in the csv file when I should have plotted col 17).
Thanks,
Stephen
p.s.
I still do not know how to write only the columns I want and not all 20 
in the csv file which is the default.

Sorry for the delay, but I was finally able to track the issue. I
suspect it has anything to do with Mac OS. It's just coincidental. The
issue is that the array names in your pvts file does not match the
arrays that are actualy present in the vts files. pvts is meant to
simply provide meta-data for the vts files, so it is required that the
arrays and other meta-data match up.

Hope that helps.

I was able to reproduce this. The difference was I believe you are
starting the python shell before creating the custom filter, while I
was doing it after :). I'll take a look -- have an idea why.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for your tips. I will take a look around this class. Though I have
a question: This is a VTK class, and I don't have problem in stand-alone
VTK applications. If I have to change something in VTK classes, it means
that I will have duplicated filters, the native VTK ones and the modified
of mine... Don't you think there something on ParaView-side to do?

Thanks again and best regards,
Jerome

Jerome,

The VTK class has the trick to override the extent-translator which is
what does-what-it-does in ParaView. ParaView by default overrides the
extent translator with vtkPVExtentTranslator which uses the original
data exetent information for partitioning and that's what messes such
fancy pipelines up. The filer can explicitly override ParaView's
behavior. So to answer, no, there's nothing on ParaView side that
needs to be added to support changing of extents it is in the
pipeline.

I've extended the example under
ParaView/Examples/CustomApplication/Spreadsheet to demonstrate how to
change the application icon. Attached is a patch with relevant code
that was added for the same.

----------------------------------------------------
commit 27e71a8d56adc2ec44a93296c68ab2a2d66460a6

    Demonstrates how to add a main-window icon.

    Also demonstrates how to add custom resources to a custom application.

Message-ID: <AANLkTin-CVOFEc34mMjoBuMof9-l9YNZZyarNkqLQue1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview developers and users,

I am getting this error when I tried to open up a .vtu file:

ERROR: In
/Users/kitware/ParaViewReleases/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLUnstructuredDataReader.cxx,
line 522
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0x1df060e0): Cannot read points array from
Points in piece 0.  The data array in the element may be too short.

The file is quite small. It comes from a mesh with more than one zone, and
this is one of the zones, since I wanted to isolate the various regions... I
checked that the file format is correct. What can be a possible reason for
this error and how can I fix it?

Thanks,
Karen

Dear all, I fixed it myself. Don't worry... I had a CellData instead of
PointData, so not everywhere is covered...

Hi!!



I am using ParaView 2.4 (compiled) in OpenSuse 11.0 without errors. When I
update for OpenSuse 11.1 ParaView compiles without problems but does not
start. I catch the error message below. The same error happend with others
recent linux distributions.

Is there any way to fix it? I`ve heard something about some fix or patch the
tcl/tk but I don't know how make it.

Anybody could help me? I would appreciate any help.

Fine!
Thanks a lot for your explanations. Then I will work on that.
Do you mind if I go on this thread for eventual misunderstandings?

Utkarsh,

clear up a doubt for me please: Does it mean that if I want to use
vtkImageConstantPad filter in ParaView, I only have two solutions
that are
1) to write vtkPVImageConstantPad that uses the extent translator
correctly,
2) to submit a patch to the VTK developers that modifies the current
implementation

Thanks again!

Jerome

Hello,

I would like to use the vtkByteSwap function in a c++ script.
I compiled Paraview myseld, so is there a way to use the VTK librairie that
is included in paraview ?

Which file do I have to include in ordre to can use the vtkByteSwap
functions ?

Thanks for help.

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A194AAA92132B@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>


I am creating grids with node-based data about ionization states. So, for different elements from the Periodic Table of Elements, I may have several states. For example:

Hydrogen has two 2 states, Helium has 3, Iron has 15. 

The data are stored as vtkDoubleArrays with tuples of numbers. The Number of Components is equal to the number of ionization states.

My problem is in the GUI.

Any array with number of components less or equal to 3 can be colored by Magnitude, or by component, where the components are labelled X, Y, Z. However, in this chemistry problem, the components are not spatial dimensions, they have nothing to do with XYZ.
Any array with number of components greater than 3, can be colored by component labelled from 0 to N-1, which the correct way we think of when calling elements and their ionization states.

Is there a way to enforce this labelling from 0 to N-1, instead of the spatial-centric notation _X, _Y,_Z?

The problem shows up elsewhere. Using the Calculator, I get a long list of labels, some of them indexed by _[XYZ], some of them indexed by _{012345678910]. We would much prefer an homogeneous labelling.

A much improved GUI for the Contour module would be the ability to directly choose a component from a multi-component data array, without having to resort to the Calculator. is this in the plan?

Hi Jean,

In the current paraview master, you can name each components of and array. 
You have a new method vtkAbstractArray::SetComponentName() for this.
If set, those component names appear in place of the traditionnal X, Y et 
and Z suffixes.
So you may have to modify your reader to use this new interface.

As for the possibility to create an isosurface using a given component, it 
is planned for this summer, by implementing the notion of "pre-filters" 
which will adapt the input of a filter to fit the filter requirement.
More exactly what is planned for now is to automatically extract a given 
component for scalar-based filters, and project cell to point for the 
isosurface (with a warning that some interpolation is used).

Best,
Stephane

Hi Jean,

If set, those component names appear in place of the traditionnal X, Y et and Z suffixes.
-----------------

thanks Stephane,

the method SetComponentName is exactly what I needed. The Coloring menu now perfectly shows each component labelled, for example, H_0 and H_1 for Hydrogen.

However, it has a side effect which is worse than the previous state. The Calculator, now shows all labels with a double underscore as in H_H_0, H_H_1 for Hydrogen.
I suspect that other filters which decompose array names with the underscore postfix would have the same problem. I am guessing Calculator is not aware that the components are already named. 

Comments?

After tracing the code, I found that the segfault occurs when ParaView attempts
to sort the DataArray by alphabetic order.

After update the SplineFilter, ParaView tries to create a new representation
(pqDisplayPolicy). For this matter, pqObjectBuilder set the default
property for this
new representation (pqObjectBuilder.cxx, line 513).
etc, etc... Here is the call stack before the sort function that
causes the segfault :

The guilty line is
   vtkPVDataSetAttributesInformation.cxx, line 194
I put a breakpoint here.

the array to sort has the value :
   ({arrayIndx=0 arrayName=0x00000000 <Ptr> incorrect },{arrayIndx=1
arrayName=0x13c8d198 "vtkOriginalPointIds" })
the null pointer for the first array is problematic for the
alphabetical sorting. Thus I tried to simply skip this instruction.
The execution stop one more time at this breakpoint, but now the array
value *concerning the spline filter* is:
   ({arrayIndx=0 arrayName=0x10b21618 "Texture Coordinates"
},{arrayIndx=1 arrayName=0x114d37a0 "vtkOriginalPointIds" })

Then I removed the breakpoint: execution went on and the spline is
correctly computed. However, the information panel does not show the
DataArray !!

I hope that someone can help me to enable the vtkSplineFilter in
ParaView. Recall: my XML file was working with ParaView-3.7.

Thanks a lot, and best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Write and read a vtk file (in python)
Message-ID: <4C08F329.2070400@c-s.fr>

Hello,

I try to write and read a vtk (legacy) file, and I have two problems :

1) reading :
------------

from a vtkStructuredGrid object, I use a vtkStructuredGridWriter to 
create a vtk file, and I have the following problem :
when I launch the script in Paraview, the format of floating points is 
not good (I obtain for example 33,1632 instead of 33.1632). So, the file 
created is not readable by Paraview. If I launch the script directly in 
a terminal, it works fine. Perhaps because the version of vtk module is 
not the same ?
If I use the binary format I have not this problem.

2) writing :
------------

  I would like to read my vtk files from the python shell, with 
OpenDataFile(), but It didn't succeed and I have the following message 
(with a file which can be read in paraview using menu open of course :-) :


/home/plumecoq/tmp/ParaView/flow_1_0075.vtk

     "to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute FileName does not exist.  This class does not 
allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use 
add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.


any ideas ? I try to use LegacyVTKFileReader instead, but I have also 
some problems.

I use a re-compile version of Paraview 3.8, under Linux (Fedora 10 - 64 
bits)

thanks for your help.

I suspect that you named the array "H", and the components "H_0", "H_1" 
etc... right?
With the current logic, you should instead name the array "H", and the 
components "0", "1" etc

The name presented in the calculator is given by the aggregation of the 
array name and component name : ArrayName_CompName

Hi Jean,

In the current paraview master, you can name each components of and array. 
You have a new method vtkAbstractArray::SetComponentName() for this.
If set, those component names appear in place of the traditionnal X, Y et 
and Z suffixes.
-----------------

thanks Stephane,

the method SetComponentName is exactly what I needed. The Coloring menu 
now perfectly shows each component labelled, for example, H_0 and H_1 for 
Hydrogen.

However, it has a side effect which is worse than the previous state. The 
Calculator, now shows all labels with a double underscore as in H_H_0, 
H_H_1 for Hydrogen.
I suspect that other filters which decompose array names with the 
underscore postfix would have the same problem. I am guessing Calculator 
is not aware that the components are already named. 

Comments?

Hi Jerome,

> 2) to submit a patch to the VTK developers that modifies the current
> implementation

This is harder than you think. The current implementation is "broken"
for a good reason. I'll try to explain.

ParaView is first and foremost designed
for distributed memory parallel computing. Its main mode of operation
is data parallel: each process loads a subset of the whole mesh and
filters it, for the most part, in an embarrassingly parallel fashion. One of
the main bottlenecks (actually, THE main bottleneck) of distributed parallel
processing is IO. We want to minimize IO whenever possible. This
desire conflicts with the way structured data pipeline works by default.
The structured pipeline aims to always keep data load balanced. For
example, if I load a mesh, then extract a subset (with extract VOI) and
then contour it, the default VTK implementation will try to first split the
whole mesh into n (where n is the number of pieces) and then try to
split the output of extract VOI into n. Depending on what extract VOI
is extracting, the second partitioning may be different than the first,
causing processes to reload different parts of data.

To avoid this problem, ParaView uses a custom extent translator. However,
this extent translator was not designed with all image filters in mind.
Hence the problem you are seeing.

If you are running only in serial mode, the problem is easy to solve.
Change the ParaView code to use its extent translator only when running
in parallel. However, if you are running in parallel, you cannot do this.

I am working on making some changes to the VTK pipeline that will
hopefully address this issue in the future.

Hi Jean,

The calculator filter appends the component names to the array name on
purpose. That reason is that if you had two different vectors that had
component names in common you would be able to identify them.

That is correct Stephane. Naming the components "0", "1" etc will give you
the names you are expecting in  the calculator display and the color
legened.

Hi Eduardo,

Is there any reason why you are using such an old version of ParaView?
I am afraid that we no longer support ParaView 2. Maybe someone in this
list will be able to help you but you are much more likely to get support
if you move to a later version.

Best,

This seems to be related to the way the LOCALE is set on your system. It is
probably set to French in one case and English in the other. Does anybody know
if we can force LOCALE to English in the ParaView application or the reader?

Unless I am mistaken, you give the filename directly to OpenDataFile(),
without FileName=.

Berk, Utkarsh,

Thanks a lot for your kind explanation. For now, my way of using
ParaView is almost serial-and-client-only. BUT my wish is to bring the
power of ParaView, regarding the parallelization, to the medical imaging
community. I want to make *no* modification to the original source code
of external lib, thus having an easy-to-maintain software package.

Conclusion is: Looking forward to testing your pipeline enhancements!

Deep thanks
Jerome

There was a bug in OpenDataFile() that was fixed a few days ago (May
26) that is causing that "AttributeError: Attribute FileName does not
exist". Attached is a patch for the same.

Indeed, forcing the locale where the PV application runs under to C
was what I proposed a while ago, which failed to draw attention:
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-August/013278.html

I'd really appreciate if the PV developers reconsider this.

Jerome,

I've committed a fix. The problem was that vtkSplineFilter was not
naming all arrays in produced in its output. Attached is a patch.

commit 52e308acb8265e019db973197e1a4c857f58e8d4
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>

    vtkSplineFilter not naming tcoords array. Fixed that.

Subject: [Paraview] Particle tracer: output particle coordinates for every
 time step to file?
Message-ID: <4C090B5C.4030002@kth.se>

Hi!

I am looking for a way to output the 3D particle coordinates computed by
the particle tracer to a file for every time step.

The particle tracer has this option "Enable Particle Writing", but
giving a filename and checking the box gave no result. I thought this
might be the feature I am looking for, but I couldn't find any
documentation (apart from the interface).

Does it do what I want? And if so, how? And if not, is there another way
to get the coordinates (potentially using the python interface?)

I am grateful for any hints and tips,
Florian

Any idea if python will respect that call too?

It did work for the OpenFOAM reader on the Python console as well
under es_AR.UTF-8 (which I know had been affected by the problem) on
Ubuntu 10.04. Thanks for the fast fix!

Hi, i'm using Paraview 3.8.0 reading VTK data (produced by foamToVTK script
from OpenFOAM data) but i have to problem:
1) If i change legend location it appears always on top right position

2) Calculator doesn't recognize Euler's number e. It gives me this error

ERROR: In

Thanks in advance

1) Color legend works for me.  I assume you mean change the location of the color legend?
2) Please write this up as a bug.  As a trivial work around, exp(1) seems to work.

I don't think changing the SDK that Visual Studio is using is supported. VS
2008 uses the 6.0A SDK. If you want to use the 7.1 SDK then you probably
need to use VS 2010. I suspect there are configuration checks that CMake
assumes if VS 2008 then use SDK 6.0A conventions.

That said, ParaView should compile fine with Visual Stodio 2008 or 2010
using the appropriate SDK.

Hi Berk,

Thanks for the reply but I can not migrate to newer versions of
Paraview. Paraview
2.4 was used as the basis for the development of another project and would
be good not to have to rewrite our code for newer versions and using the QT.

I will continue seeking a solution ....

It should now affect all paraview executables.

commit cd1b14208b79b8c7773c4bbc10eaf25c680b65c5
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 4 13:51:23 2010 -0400

    setlocale to avoid locale related numeric issues.

    This now affects all executables, not merely Qt-based ones.

Hi Dave,
I tried it with both 6.0A and 7.1 SDK by running a tool coming with the

Not sure if this helps, but I don't have any SDK's explicitly installed at all on my machine.  I am  64 bit windows 7, using the MSVC 2008 (9.0) compiler.  I also looked in my path settings, and no SDK is to be found.  Maybe try uninstalling the SDK, be sure to remove the SDK references in your path settings (and other environment settings), cmake and recompile from scratch?

Hi Dave,
I tried it with both 6.0A and 7.1 SDK by running a tool coming with the SDK. But the compilation problem stays.

Best,

I don't think changing the SDK that Visual Studio is using is supported. VS 2008 uses the 6.0A SDK. If you want to use the 7.1 SDK then you probably need to use VS 2010. I suspect there are configuration checks that CMake assumes if VS 2008 then use SDK 6.0A conventions.

That said, ParaView should compile fine with Visual Stodio 2008 or 2010 using the appropriate SDK.

I have made sure before every #include <windows.h> there is #include <WinSock2.h>. But that did not mitigate the problem. Can anyone help please? Thanks a lot.

Hi,

I'm not sure how the enable particle writing works in that filter.  I would
just use either the VTK legacy writer or VTK Polydata file writer and check
"Write all timesteps as file-series.".  You'll get a series of files from
that.

Bastian,

I've committed a fix to git/master. the spreadsheet view should now
show up by default.

Subject: [Paraview] Handling visualization of absent data in paraview
Message-ID: <AANLkTinEuE56ariIEl2N6_Q5UNDnYZMdQAmn5movWDt9@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Lately I have been facing a problem building a visualization where
part of the point or cell data is missing. An example might clarify
the situation. Suppose I would like to visualize a result (e.g.
stress/strain) of a composite layered material. Since in general, the
number of layers will vary throughout a model, for some cells where
only 6 layers exist, visualization of data for layer 10 obviously
yields no results. My question is how to handle these regions of the
model where no data exists in Paraview? What I could think of is using
a color outside the active color spectrum for marking absence of data.
But what "value" should be given to this absent data in the input
file? Something like "NaN"?

Kind regards,

Marco Nawijn

Hi Alan,
I did what you suggested. It did not mitigate the problem.
I am wondering whether there is something in the CMake step that I 
mis-configured. Any suggestions that I can try?
Thanks  a lot.

Best,

Hi All,
I even disabled "CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS" and used "CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS". 
That makes no difference to my problem.

My build works OK on Windows 7 64 MSVC2008.
 
A very handy tool for debugging what bits get pulled into a build is
Sysinternals Processor Monitor (previously Filemon)
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062.aspx
 
You can filter on file paths/names and very quickly see where MSVC pokes
around to find things like header files etc.

Maybe try uninstalling the SDK, be sure to remove the SDK references in your
path settings (and other environment settings), cmake and recompile from
scratch?

Hi Dave,
I tried it with both 6.0A and 7.1 SDK by running a tool coming with the SDK.
But the compilation problem stays.

That said, ParaView should compile fine with Visual Stodio 2008 or 2010
using the appropriate SDK.

Hey J?r?me,

Yes, you can use the Python Programmable Source as a reader. There are some examples on these two pages, in case you haven't seen them:

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython & numpy

Good Morning,

At this time, when I want to use the numpy library with pvpython, I build
using the same version of python than pvpython.

Is there an easier way ? Especially : is it possible to build new libraries
directly with pvpython ?

When I try, I have this error :

Hi,

Thank you, that works, but gives me lots of data I don't actually need.
I would rather have something more concise.

Is anybody more familiar with the particle tracer and can tell what this
particle writing is supposed to do and how to get it to work?

I added the particle writing as a "stub" so that the user can define his own writing class. 
simply create a writer sub-classed from vtkAbstractParticleWriter
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkAbstractParticleWriter.html override the WriteData function, and add it to your build, then set it manually in the constructor of the temporal stream tracer (or other suitable place using SetParticleWriter)

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.8.0 mesh modification
Message-ID: <4C0D0509.4060904@sophia.inria.fr>

I have a mesh, I would like to refine it in a region (for example the 
wake behind a cylinder or a sphere).

I can refine the mesh using PV (sub divide).
Questions:
1- How can I choose a region where I want to subdivide?
2- Once subdivided, how do I save the new mesh?
3- What formats are available?
Stephen
p.s.
Can one create a mesh using PV?

Subject: [Paraview] Custom External Libraries built with ParaView
Message-ID: <E3E14A51-75CA-4851-A18B-F0F2AA7A229E@ucalgary.ca>

I'm having some linking issues building our custom external libraries into ParaView.

The background is, we have the following:
1. a custom library (vtkskiIO) , and
2. some ParaView plugins that use classes out of vtkskiIO .

These can be built, loaded and run successfully when they are built not with with ParaView, but against an already-built ParaView source tree.  In this case they are loaded after launching ParaView with the Plugin manager.

We would like now to build them along with ParaView itself, following roughly these instructions: http://paraview.org/Wiki/Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time#Build_Code_As_Part_Of_ParaView .  This will make it easier for our users, as we can just distribute ParaView with our extensions built in.

We have a single external module CMake file, "vtkskiPluginsParaViewImport.cmake" which we specify with the CMake variable PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE .  It builds our vtkskiIO library, and informs ParaView about it as follows (this seems the most likely command that I found in ParaViewCommon.cmake):

  PARAVIEW_LINK_LIBRARIES(vtkskiIO)

The plugins themselves are then built with PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES, PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES and PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES .

The library does build correctly within the ParaView binary directory, however, we then run into this error:

Linking CXX shared library ../../bin/libvtkPVFilters.dylib
Undefined symbols:
  "vtkAIMReader::New()", referenced from:
      vtkSmartPointer<vtkAIMReader>::New()        in vtkAIMReaderPlugin.cxx.o
ld: symbol(s) not found

It appears that we need somehow to specify that vtkPVFilters should link against out libvtkskiIO (without actually going in and modifying any CMake files within ParaView itself).  Apparently, PARAVIEW_LINK_LIBRARIES is not sufficient for this purpose.  Any suggestions?

Eric

Thanks Michael.  That did it - well 90% of it.  The other 10% was also adding a PARAVIEW_FILTERS_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES command to specify the directory with .h files for our plugins.

Hi,

i have used the binaries of PV 3.8.0 (RC2) on an Linux 64bit workstation 
(OpenSuse 11.2). Trying to use the surface-LIC PV crashes - find the 
output attached.

Is this a problem with the graphics card? I have an Nvidia FX1400 and 
the driver is v256.25 ...

Best regards and thank you in advance,

Hey J?r?me,

If you're doing this from the Python Shell within ParaView, then it looks like the correct attribute is ps.ScriptRequestInformation

Another solution would be to save your programmable source as a "custom filter", and then load it back in to Python when you need it. I'd be curious to hear if there is a more streamlined way to do this now -- the method from a year and a half ago was detailed by Berk here: 

http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg01990.html

but I know there has been a lot of refinement of the interface since then.

Good luck,
-Eric

Hello,

I see "Internal error" in the log returned by the driver. So yes it is
an nVidia driver bug.

256.25 is a beta driver. The latest beta driver is 256.29. Try it first:
http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=122606


If you still have this issue, please report it to nVidia regarding
their Linux driver.
Here are the instructions:

Hi All,
I have trouble building 3.8.0 from source on Win7 64bit + MSVC2010. Here 
are a couple of the errors to report.

Error    27    error C2668: 'pow' : ambiguous call to overloaded

I added "libcmt" to the ignored default library list to project Xdmf and 
resolved the last 3 errors. But still it will be great for the dev. team 
to fix in the CMake configuration step. Would you please suggest some 
steps I should take? Thanks a lot.

Hi All,
I have following errors on project "pqApplicationComponents".

It seems like the Qt .ui files are not added into the project. Could you

A: MSVC2010 Ultimate. I have a lot of compilation problems, e.g. 
redefinition in ws2def.h and winsock2.h, when I use MSVC2008, even after 
uninstalling and reinstalling MSVC2008 and Microsoft SDK7.1 twice. Thus 
I was quite skeptical what gonna happen with MSVC2010. It turned out I 
went a lot further with MSVC2010.

Please let me know what else you need.

Subject: [Paraview] How to have the spreadsheet view
Message-ID: <AANLkTimmRmII9TFoCt63CaA6hmNpz7cComchOC0OCZpz@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am writing an Amelet-HDF format plugin reader in paraview (you can see the
code in the following link http://code.google.com/p/amelet-hdf/).
The plugin reads three kinds of data:
 * mesh
 * data on mesh
 * data

When the plugin reads mesh and data on mesh, the results is displayed in the
3D view (it is ok). But when the plugin read data values, I would like that
paraview show me the spreadsheet view. How can I do that in my plugin ?

Best regards,
Didier Roiss?

This method:

  pqDisplayPolicy::getPreferredViewType(pqOutputPort* opPort,
    bool update_pipeline)

governs what view type is initially created for any given source/reader/filter.

For instance, if your plugin produces vtkTables when you read data
values in, then the spreadsheet view should be created.

Additionally, if you have separate readers for the 3 kinds of data you
mention, you can use <Hints /> to indicate that the result of that
reader should be shown in  a spreadsheet view.

Look at "CSVReader" proxy xml in
ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/reader.xml

<SourceProxy ...>
    <Hints>
        <!-- View can be used to specify the preferred view for the proxy -->
        <View type="SpreadSheetView" />
     </Hints>
</SourceProxy>

Utkarsh,
 
Regarding the hints, how do you get the output of a custom C++ filter to be
presented in a specific view such as spreadsheet or histogram, rather than
the default view?

Additionally, if you have separate readers for the 3 kinds of data you
mention, you can use <Hints /> to indicate that the result of that
reader should be shown in  a spreadsheet view.

Look at "CSVReader" proxy xml in
ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/reader.xml

<SourceProxy ...>
   <Hints>
       <!-- View can be used to specify the preferred view for the proxy -->
       <View type="SpreadSheetView" />
    </Hints>
</SourceProxy>

You have to specify the <Hints /> for the filter in the XML. The
"type" is the name of the view proxy to create.

Hello,

I 'd like to import some data (geometry+scalar field+vector field) under the
Ensight format.
So far, I've manage to import the geometry of my model and the scalar field
at each node but I've some problem to get the vector field. Does anybody
knows what is the format of the variable file for a vector per node field?

Thank you

Message-ID: <AANLkTin3KBLRxz7I5BaXABgVtQnbRY4CMRmChZk7LTEa@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I had a rather quick  question. I am working with adaptive meshes and would
like to import them into paraview. So far I have been able to that with
unstructured datasets and .vtk files. The problem is that whenever I use
slice filter to see a cross-section of mesh, it triangulates the dataset and
I see triangles instead of blocks (I'm using Cartesian AMR). I was wondering
if this can be solved by using multiblock datasets and .vtm format. If so,
can anyone please lead me to a good tutorial on .vtm format? It seems I
cannot find a good one.

Thanks,
Mohammad

Hi,

I have tracked down the problem to be an issue with CMake and Windows 7
which you can track at http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=10808. A
workaround is to explicitly set CMake and Visual Studio to run as
administrator. If you choose to use this work around you will need to delete
your ParaView build directory.

To explicitly set an application to run as administrator:

   1. Right-click the application, and then click Properties
   2. Click the Compatibility tab
   3. Check Run this program as an administrator

Hi,

I would like to find the location of the currently running python
plugin macro.  This is so I can do an import of a library that lives
in a directory relative to the directory where all my paraview plugins
live.  Is this possible?

In a normal python programme sys.argv[0] can help me, but ofcourse
that just points to the paraview binary in this case.  os.getcwd() is
no use.  The info is known to paraview (for instance it is in
~/.config/ParaView/ParaView3.8.0.ini file under the [PythonMacros]
section - but I really don't want to go trolling through that file).

I have quite a few plugins, and I want to do the correct thing by
breaking some of the shared functionality out into a module.

Thanks for any help

Matt

You can combine different data sets into a multiblock data set in paraview
with the Group DataSets filter to test out what you want to do without
having to write out your data as a multiblock data set.  To add more data
sets to the Group DataSet filter right click on the filte rin the pipeline
browser and choose "change input..." .  The with the control button pressed,
select the other filters you want to be grouped together.

Thanks Favre,

I am using my own code that creates Cartesian AMR based on Octree
data-structure. Just one question though, what do you mean by "sources" ?
Are you talking about specific example package from FLASH and Enzo or
ParaView demos?

Thanks

I'm afraid there isn't a way to get the name of the python file that is
currently executing.  Paraview reads the contents for the file into a string
and passes the string to the interpreter, so python has no association
between the string and the file.  As a feature request, I think it would be
reasonable to have paraview set the __file__ variable to be the name of the
file before executing it.

Hi Pat,

Thank you for your quick response.

Yes setting the __file__ variable would be great.

Is there a formal way to do a feature request?  From googling, I see
people have just posted requests to this list.  Is that good enough?
If so, could we please have this has a feature request?

If it is worth your time, perhaps you could point me to were I should
start looking and perhaps I might be able to figure out how to
implement the feature myself.

Thank you

Matt Wilkins

Hi Matt, this patch should do it-

--- a/Qt/Python/pqPythonDialog.cxx
+++ b/Qt/Python/pqPythonDialog.cxx
@@ -163,8 +163,8 @@ void pqPythonDialog::runScript(const QStringList& files)
     QFile file(files[i]);
     if(file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly))
       {
-      this->Implementation->Ui.shellWidget->executeScript(
-        file.readAll().data());
+      this->runString(QString("__file__ = \"%1\"").arg(files[i]));
+      this->runString(file.readAll().data());
       }
     else
       {


Due to the extra call to runString(), the paraview python shell will display
a new prompt twice.  I'd like to fix that before committing it to paraview.

Hello,

I also would like to make a ProgrammableSource with a 
vtkMultiBlockDataSet as output type (*). It seems that the correction 
indicated below doesn't appear in the version 3.8.0 of ParaView.

do you know in which version this change will be integrate ?

does a patch exist ?

thanks.

J?r?me

(*) in fact, if I put the OutputDataSetType to 13, it takes 0 (the value 
default : vtkPolyData), but it seems to work...

Hi Robert,
I just explicitly did what you suggested: running CMake as 
administrator. It does not help. I was logging in with an administrator 
level account when I was running CMake.
Any other suggestions? It seems pqApplicationComponents project misses a 
couple of .ui files, i.e. pyLinksManager.ui, pqPliginDialog.ui, and 
pqMultiViewFrameMenu.ui. I added them to the project's resource folder. 
That does not have any effect.

Best,
x

Subject: [Paraview] Fwd: Parallel Projection and zoom
Message-ID: <4C1132EC.4020902@yahoo.de>

Dear all,

I am very happy that 3.8.0 now has the option to save/load view. Very
helpful. However when using parallel projection the parameter to control
zooming is:

    * Not shown in the Adjust Camera GUI
    * Not saved with the views

The only way I have so far is to query it from Python:

>>>
view=GetRenderView()

>>>
view.CameraParallelScale

2.7270467698171603

However this is not so straight-forward. I also done't know how to
modify it from within python. I can do
view.CameraParallelScale=1 and the value is changed but the view is not....

Regards Bastian

Is it possible you just need to call Render() to update the view?  It works
for me from python, if I enable parallel projection and adjust the scale-

view.CameraParallelProjection = 1
view.CameraParallelScale = 1.0
Render()

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Projection and zoom
Message-ID: <4C114DCD.2070606@yahoo.de>

Thanks Pat,

that works. Honestly it is not my aim to use Python every time I want to
change/query a zome factor. Would it be possible to:

    * add it to the GUI
    * Save it together with the views?

Thanks.

Bastian

What about the double expansion of DESTDIR? The bug only mention respecting

Hi,

Is it possible, in the following script (that is a part of a xml plugin
file), to assume that DebutNomMai is a string ?

<StringVectorProperty
       name="DebutNomMai"
       command="SetParameter"
       number_of_elements="2"
       default_values_delimiter=";"
       default_values="DebutNomMai;'tata'">
     </StringVectorProperty>

Sorry, I don't think I understand the question. It's a string vector
property, so DebutNomMai specified in default_values is indeed a
string -- right?

default_values="DebutNomMai;* '*tata*'* "

I don't think so.

When I don't put the quote marks around "tata", an error occurs.
---> tata is not defined.

The command is "SetParameter", and the filter try to execute
DebutNomMai = tata

... Or I misunderstand something ?

If I am understanding you correctly the filter that you wrote has a  
parameter named "DebutNomMai" and you want to set that value to  
"tata" (or something else the user selects).

If this is the case then you need to add the following to your filter  
class:

     vtkSetStringMacro( DebutNomMai )
     vtkGetStringMacro( DebutNomMai )

Then the xml will look like this:

<StringVectorProperty
         name="DebutNomMai"
         command="SetDebutNomMai"
         number_of_elements="1"
         default_values_delimiter=""
         default_values="tata">
       </StringVectorProperty>

That should work.

Subject: [Paraview] Python/C++ Plugins with Paraview 3.8.0
Message-ID: <4C15D808.7010108@googlemail.com>

Hi,

  I understand that with Paraview 3.8, there is no longer a need to 
build plugins as part of building paraview i.e. Paraview as shipped at 
version 3.8.0 onwards have all the required development libraries and 
headers.

  Can someone point me to the documentation on how to leverage this new 
libraries and headers?

Regards

That's it !

And what you purpose should work well, but I would like to do a simple
plugin, that doesn't need to compile Paraview, and could work with the
paraview executables.

My xml file looks like this :
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">

  <!-- server manager xml for a python script that read a v3d file.
       the auto generated panel for this exposes everything more than we
want so
       a custom panel would be good -->
    <SourceProxy name="ReaderV3D" class="vtkPythonProgrammableFilter"
                 label="ReaderV3D">
      <Documentation
         long_help=""
         short_help="">
      </Documentation>

      <!-- data set type -->
      <IntVectorProperty
        name="OutputDataSetType"
        command="SetOutputDataSetType"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="13">
        <!-- value of 13 means MultiBlockDataSet -- Thanks Utkarsh !-->
      </IntVectorProperty>

      <!-- the script -->
     <StringVectorProperty
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="import pyturbo; &#xa;pdo =
self.GetOutput();&#xa;exec 'Simu = pyturbo.%s'%(NomSimulation)&#xa;data =
pyturbo.MultiBlocFromV3D(Simu, [DebutNomMai, FinNomMai], [DebutNomAero,
FinNomAero], NumerosBlocs);&#xa;&#xa;pdo.DeepCopy(data);&#xa;">
     </StringVectorProperty>

     <!-- python script references a variable "NomSimulation"
          we expose this as a property allowing the user to set it -->
     <StringVectorProperty
       name="NomSimulation"
       command="SetParameter"
       number_of_elements="2"
       default_values_delimiter=";"
       default_values="NomSimulation;'s'">
     </StringVectorProperty>

................ etc.

There isn't a  simple xml command that's looks like
StringVectorProperty/SetParameter, but returning a character, isn't it ?

Hi Nicholas,

You can accomplish this with the new development install versions of
ParaView that include the necessary libraries and headers. One caveat is
that you need to install/build your own matching Qt (4.6.2).

I put in a request for the links to be added to the download page but I see
they are not there. Let me ping the webpage person again and I will get back
to you. In the mean time you can get the files from
http://paraview.org/files/v3.8/. The packages are called
ParaView-Development-3.8.0-*

Hi,

Miguel Fosas send an other patch assigne to the related bug
http://www.itk.org/Bug/view.php?id=10775#c20932

Instead of "XdmfConstString Value=0;", he moves the variable in the
case-section.

Greetings
Jens

Hi All, I have applied the new fix to Xdmf in
commit cd802a3e4c0c13b4697518363535562f758a6d48 and updated ParaView to
point to the latest Xdmf. Let me know if there are more problems.

Would be great to get an idea of performance, as well as cleaning up the
licensing issues were it to be used. We are working on other experimental
code internally to combine VTK render windows and QGraphicsView too, I know
Clinton Stimpson has been exploring some of the possibilities here.

Thanks,

Marcus

Turn off VTK_USE_N_WAY_ARRAYS. VS 2003's compiler can't handle the templates
used in the Variants and N-Way arrays.

Subject: [Paraview] reading timeseries with XDMFReader?
Message-ID: <F208C10EED02964CB3F9014E661F55024F1A2E58FC@EXWA-MBX01.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi folks,

I'm trying to open a timeserie collection of hdf5 files in PV (3.8-RC2) and it doesn't seem to work for me...

I first tried opening a timeserie (XDMF...xmf) 'by hand'. It seems ok, but when I try to use the VCR controls the renderer is still rendering the same scene.

Also, I had a look at the trace created when opening timeseries and compared the XDMFReader property encoding with other VTK Readers.

+ the XDMFReader FileName property has only one argument (not the list I expected):
- XDMF_00 = XDMFReader( FileName='C:\\%PATH%\\XDMF.00001.xmf' )
+ and for comparison, the  XMLPartitionedStructuredGridReader encode an array with the list of files with similar extensions present in the directory:
- fields_0000 = XMLPartitionedStructuredGridReader( FileName=['C:\\%PATH%\\fields.00000.pvts', C:\\%PATH%\\fields.00001.pvts'] )

The user doco (http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/XdmfReader.html) describes the FileName property value has to be a single file name. Is there a way to change this so one could load hdf5 timeseries?
i.e. don't get an error message when trying: XDMF_00 = XDMFReader( FileName=['C:\\%PATH%\\XDMF.00001.xmf', 'C:\\%PATH%\\XDMF.000010.xmf'] )

Otherwise, is there any known workaround available?

Cheers

Gilly

I am not sure it is where it was meant to go but I applied this patch to make
it respect DESTDIR and finally land in "/usr/bin" under linux.
I didn't do a complete analysis of what goes wrong with ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}
and just replaced it by ${PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR}.

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf.py install is scanning my /usr recursively and try
	to bytecompile anything in .py
Message-ID: <201006152207.28162.f.r.bissey@massey.ac.nz>

Hi,

A problem that I encountered while packaging paraview-3.8.0.
Here is a build log extract:
-- Installing: /media/anthill/portage/sci-
visualization/paraview-3.8.0/image/usr/lib/python2.6/site-
packages/Xdmf/__init__.py

So two points: first it doesn't respect DESTDIR - in the end bytecompiling is
the responsibility of the package manager so I disabled that completely.

Second it all come from this bit in Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/CMakeList.txt 
(lines 505-507):
  # Compile Byte Code
  INSTALL(CODE "EXECUTE_PROCESS(COMMAND ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} 
${Xdmf_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/CompileXdmfByteCode.py 
    ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_PY_DIR})")

It turns out that we scan /usr which is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX because
XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_PY_DIR is never defined. I suspect the intent
was to define it earlier and to use it to set XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR
as we can see earlier in the same file (lines 472):
  SET(XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR 
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}${XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR}/Xdmf)

Which I think may have been meant:
  SET(XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR 
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}${XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_PY_DIR}/Xdmf)

--------------
If we don't care about DESTDIR replacing  
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_PY_DIR}
in line 507 by:
${XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR}
will look in the right place.

Hey Gilly,

Xdmf works by putting the whole time series description in a single file. The details of the model and XMF file format can be found here:

http://xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format

All of the specifications are there, but I'm not sure there's a nice example of what they call a "temporal collection". (You can also do multi-block datasets with "spatial collection" or do combinations like "temporal collection of spatial collections".) There are many ways to indicate the time, so take a look at that page, but here's one example of three time steps of an unstructured grid:

========
<Xdmf>
	<Domain Name="MSI">
		<Grid Name="CellsTime" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">

Subject: [Paraview] Difference between Custom filter & Programmable Filter
Message-ID: <AANLkTinmuefRB8_jXP1WbUzzHrjVsKHXBAomaqAjmVmf@mail.gmail.com>

A new newbie question, but more theoretical than practical :

What is the difference between a custom filter, and a programmable filter ?
(user point of view)
What type of use should be reserved to one or the other ?

And finally..... When creating a new custom filter from a python
programmable filter, one of the available properties of the programmable
filter is called "parameters".
Can we use it and how.. ? And can't find any documentation on this.

Many thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Hierachy in ParaView : VTK Multiblock file format ?
Message-ID: <14788429.76621.1276612392781.JavaMail.www@wwinf8215>

Hello,

I am a french student : I apologize for my poor English.

I use ParaView to visualize results from? a lighting software, I'm a beginner in ParaView. I would like to create a hierarchy in the dataset (to hide / show one building ; show results only on the ground and so on). How can I manage this ?

- Can I use multiblock dataset file format (.vtm .vtmb ...) ? Where can I find any documentation about these file formats ? Does I have to use VTK to create these files ?
- What is the purpose of a block ? As example : with a multiblock dataset, I would like to have one block with physical data (radiosity, daylight factor..), other blocks without physical data (only geometry) ; or display some buildings with a color etc. I want to have only one file with all this information.

Thank you for your answer,
Yours faithfully,

paul barr?re

Then, here is my problem :
When I load an xml plugin, and its .bqrc file, check autoload, close
paraview and reopen it, the plugin is not auto-loaded.... I have to load it
again manually.
No message is displayed.

Is there some "save configuration" to do before closing ?

It doesn't seem to work neither.

When I use the 'Save Screenshot' feature in PV 3.8, the background colour
gradient 'doubles'. On my screen, I have a smooth colour gradient from the
top of the window to the bottom, but the screenshot has two tiles of the
gradient (see attachment). This only occurs when I turn off the "Save only
Selected View" to have multiple windows in my screenshot. Does anyone know
why this is happening?

Paraview 3.8.0 on Fedora 12. I'm new to PV and Linux in general - please
keep in mind for any responses.

Thanks,

Phil

Hi Aur?lien,

I am the one that submitted the bug. It describes a problem I had with
autoloading an "autostart"-style plug-in. Nobody was able to reproduce
this bug.

What you describe here is another problem that I also encounter:
Checking auto-load for XML-based plugin (such as enabling a VTK filter
without building a cxx plugin) does not work. I talked about that in
the thread entitled "Auto-load plugin failed".

I forgot to talk about the XML autoload failure in the bug report,
that's why it hasn't been tested... I will submit another one.

Hi,

Thanks for have doing this. That's quite boring to have to reload manually
the plugin each time I open paraview.

To avoid this, we can indeed ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN while building.

If this can help other people, I join what I've made for this purpose, with
the CMakeFile.
This is a Reader, that use the PythonProgrammableFilter and a python module
called "pyturbo", read the files and returned a vtkMultiBlockDataSet.
The interface is done with qt4. And the CMakeFile was completed to take care
of the .qrc and .ui files.

Regards,

Aur?lien

Hi Paul,

What you want to do with MultiBlockDataSet is not yet implemented.
(show/hide some parts, like in Catia maybe ?)
I think I have read some feature request on this, but I can't find it again.

In my opinion, you should work with simple Block, that you group with the
filter "Group Datasets", when you want to do the same action for several
blocks.

As example : with a multiblock dataset, I would like to have one block with
> physical data (radiosity, daylight factor..), other blocks without physical
> data (only geometry)
>
----> You can do this, and build a MultiBlock with Block that didn't contain
the same data.
Paraview will only say "partial" when you will display a data that is not on
all the blocks. I don't think it will try to interpolate the quantity on the
blocks where it is not.

Regards,

Aur?lien

Very interesting :).  That's definitely a bug. I've added that to the

Hi Francois,

I am a little bit confused by your email. Just to be clear, is this the
change you are proposing?

 SET( XdmfGzipSource
   gzstream
@@ -504,7 +504,7 @@ IF(XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON)

   # Compile Byte Code
   INSTALL(CODE "EXECUTE_PROCESS(COMMAND ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}

+    ${XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR})")

 ENDIF(XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON)

Let me know and I will gladly commit the fix.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.8.0 averaging variables along multiple span lines
Message-ID: <4C18F6C5.9030702@sophia.inria.fr>

I have a cylindrical mesh and would like to average the variables in the 
z-direction (span direction) for each x,y value (or theta=constant).
Can this be done in ParaView 3.8.0?
Hope my question is clear,
Stephen
p.s.
Presently I do a slice in the z-direction followed by a "plot over 
sorted lines" to get the surface pressure coefficient.

Stephen,

By averaging, are you trying to compute the lift/drag forces? If so, do the
following:

1) Generate Surface Normals (requires vtkPolyData as input, so you may have
to use Extract Surface first)
2) Multiply it by your pressure variable using the Calculator.
3) You can then integrate up using Integrate Variables to get the pressure
force in the x, y, and z directions (this includes the face area).

If you are doing this for a 2D line, make sure to do items 1) and 2) first
before taking your slice and applying 3). 

Cheers,

Adriano

Hi,

I am writing a Python plugin, and I want to popup a custom dialog.
For simple dialogs I have found:

   import PyQt4.QtGui
   l = PyQt4.QtGui.QInputDialog.getText(wid, 'Slice', 'Length')

to work fine.  But I need more complicate dialogs.  I just can't get
the signals/slots to work.  Yes I have read

   http://paraview.markmail.org/message/6h767kpak5dcoqwt

(thanks Pat), otherwise surely I would not have made it this far!

Here is my plugin, and any time I uncomment either of the connect
lines, paraview (built from git about a week ago) just hangs.  Without
those lines, the dialog doesn't work of course; I can cancel it with
the window decorator, but that is it.

Thank you for any help, this is beyond me, just reading the definition
of callback_wrapper makes my head hurt, I hope it doesn't hurt yours
;-)

Matt

def callback_wrapper(func):
   v = paraview.vtk.vtkObject()
   def wrap(*args, **kwargs):
      v._args = args

      v.Modified()
   def callback(o, e): func(*v._args, **v._kwargs)
   v.AddObserver("ModifiedEvent", callback) 
   return wrap

   def __init__(self, *args):

      buttonBox = QDialogButtonBox()
      okButton = buttonBox.addButton(buttonBox.Ok)
      cancelButton = buttonBox.addButton(buttonBox.Cancel)

      label0 = QLabel("Foo", self)
      self.le0 = le0 = QLineEdit(self)

      label1 = QLabel("Bar", self)
      self.le1 = le1 = QLineEdit(self)

      # either of these lines cause paraview to lock up
      #QObject.connect(okButton, SIGNAL("clicked()"), self, acceptfoo)
      #QObject.connect(cancelButton, SIGNAL("clicked()"), self.rejectfoo)

      layout = QGridLayout()
      layout.addWidget(label0, 0, 0)
      layout.addWidget(le0, 0, 1)
      layout.addWidget(label1, 1, 0)

Hi,

So at the very end of that email that you linked, I mentioned the problem
that paraview hangs when it encounters a runtime error, instead of reporting
the error.  I haven't had the chance to investigate the problem, but it's
really annoying!

Anyway, I think your problem is just a few typos... try adding:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *


at the top.  Also, you had commas instead of periods in two places:

foo,input1  --> foo.input1
self, acceptfoo  --> self.acceptfoo


I debugged the problems by running your script in regular python.  I
commented out the callback_wrapper and then just added:

import sys
app = QApplication(sys.argv)

before the main script begins.  Doing it this way made it easy to spot the
typos.

Hi,

I hang my head in shame, I really should have thrown my code into a
nonparaview test app.  I will do that in future.

Pat you simply are the best!  Thank you so much.

The business about self.acceptfoo vs self, acceptfoo arises from my
lack of understanding about the slots/signals in Qt.  I've seen stuff
like:

   QObject.connect(a, SIGNAL("clicked()"), a, SLOT("quit()"))

which indicate you put target object, then the slot, but also stuff
like:

   QObject.connect(a, SIGNAL("clicked()"), self.rejectfoo)

which I guess you use when the target of the signal is not a Qt SLOT
as such.

Anyway, I am very thankful to you Pat, and this list in general.

Matt

Subject: [Paraview] Threshold
Message-ID: <AANLkTimmg7OkXKkWSQDKONDhJ8lkiknYvZ_KiNuWVJkP@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I had a question about threshold filter. I am working on complex geometries
and the way I represent them is to use a level set function. Now when I want
to see solid part of domain, I just use the threshold filter on the level
set function and ask for wherever it is positive. The problem that I have
right now is that threshold filter kinda creates a rasterized bject right at
the solid-fluid interface. Is there any way you can have a rather smooth
shape at the interface?

Thanks,
Mohammad

Try using the contour filter instead.

Thanks Ken,

I have tried that. The problem is that contour gives exactly the opposite
surface. That may sound a bit confusing, so let me explain. Suppose I have a
cube, and I exclude a sphere from it. Now what I want to see is the parts of
the cube that are outside the sphere. However, if I plot the zero contour of
my level set, it just draws the sphere which is exactly the opposite of what
I'm interested in!

In that case, try the clip filter and set the clip function.  If you still get the wrong surface, invert it with the Inside Out toggle.

In the next version of ParaView there will be an "Iso Volume" filter that will look like the threshold filter but create interpolated cuts between two isosurfaces (or the mesh boundary).

Thanks Alan and Ken,

That's exactly what I was looking for -- never knew we have the ability to
clip by scalars :).

That "IsoVolume" idea is also pretty awesome. Looking forward to use it in
future. Thanks again

Subject: [Paraview] Interpolation query
Message-ID: <AANLkTilTR8gfZ1Ym5ZS-wMjrWZzARaCkz_I-jbkvGPek@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am using Paraview 3.8.0 on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). I load a .vtk file
with an evenly spaced 2D mesh (Structured Points) and associated scalars.

Paraview loads it correctly, but the interpolation is rather gross: in a 2D
view, I can see all the cells of my mesh. It would seem that Paraview
computes the color map in each cell and does not interpolate between cells.
As a result, I see a 2D pattern with a "grid texture" effect. I have also
tried to tick the "Interpolate Scalars" box in the Display menu, to no
avail. In the "style" submenu, the "Representation" and "Interpolation"
selectors are greyed out.

However, if I use "Clean to grid", Paraview does the interpolation, but the
image loses brightness as well.

Is there any way of using interpolation without passing via Clean to Grid?

Thanks in advance.

Daniele

Hi,

The Animation view, or comparative view inspector, only accept values.
(integers & floats)
I think it would be great to can change a property of a filter that is a
string (as the file name of a reader for example...).
What to you mean about that ?

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A194D306D40AF@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

I have a singleton vtkObject, but multiple paraview panels and other items use it via proxies which are created independently.

I'd like changes in any one to be propagated to all, but need to connect the underlying vtkObject modified event to the proxies - the proxy doesn't seem to do this automatically. Is there a way to achive this? (is it possible to use a singleton SMproxy? that'd solve the problem I'm sure).

Secondly : I have a custom panel for the object, when I instantiate a filter with a proxyproperty
      <ProxyProperty name="SPHManager"
                     command="SetSPHManager">
        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
          <Group name="meshless_helpers"/>
        </ProxyGroupDomain>
        <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
          <Proxy group="meshless_helpers"
                 name="SPHManager" />
        </ProxyListDomain>
      </ProxyProperty>

it doesn't call the plugin to to try to create the panel. It works ok, for a panel that represents a whole filter. And it works for a panel for a widget (proxy property), but it doesn't work for an arbitrary proxyproperty. Is there a way to make it work?

thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] exporting VRML files with python script
Message-ID: <AANLkTilfJY__f2SE88X0Ewp1P-IwNkdRNKh5RAJE0aoy@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am a new user of Paraview and I'm quite interested in using Python script
for Paraview

My goal is to import VTK series files, apply a contour to all of them and
finally export the contours in VRML format. This is my first script :

#--------------------------------------------------
from paraview.simple import *

reader = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKReader()
reader.FileNames = [ "/.../1.vtk" , "/.../2.vtk" ]
reader.UpdatePipeline()

SetActiveSource(reader)

aContour = Contour(Input = reader)
aContour.ContourBy = "alpha1"
aContour.Isosurfaces = [0.5]

Show(aContour)
Render()

#from this point it doesn't work
exporters = servermanager.createModule("exporters")
VRMLExporter = servermanager.exporters.VRMLExporter( ? , FileName=
"/.../output_1.vrml ")
#--------------------------------------------------

Can anyone help me, I'm totally lost with the export part ? (but if you see
others problems please tell me!)

Regards,

Yann

Utkarsh will probably say there is a better way to do it, but in the
mean time take a look at how that pattern is implemented for the
streaming applications.

There I used a singleton to store system wide options where things
like the number of render passes and the state of debug flags. Long
ago that state was right in the vtkPVProcessModule, but I eventually
moved it out of there and did it this more convoluted way so a not to
pollute the main application with streaming specific code.

See:
Applications/AdaptiveParaView/Plugin/
vtkAdaptiveOptions - the 'singleton', for which one exists on all
processes and all have identical contents
vtkSMAdaptiveOptionsProxy - the servermanager access to the above
pqGlobalAdaptiveViewOptions - one place in the GUI where the use can
change the contents
all over in that directory - code that uses the values in the singleton

Message-ID: <5854FDA00393484CB9B0FC10AF03E9B2165AC5@naeanrfkez04v.nadsusea.nads.navy.mil>

I would like to be able to read MILI files generated by ParaDyn into ParaView.  I've heard that the VisIt readers (including a MILI reader) are being brought into ParaView.  If so, what is the estimated completion date for this?  Is there a workaround now?

Thanks,
Alan Luton

Dave,

Thanks, I see the adaptive options stuff. You are manually creating the SMAdaptiveoptionsProxy - which is ok if you have a custom panels - I do for one window, but the others are autogenerated, and I want them to pick up the same proxy (and custom panel for the sub proxy) - I tried creating a singleton proxy but can't make it work and on plugin load it instantiates one, then when I try to use it in a filter - the connection Id changes when instantated the second time and paraview gives me grief.

to try to explain better ...

you have 
<AdaptiveOptionsProxy name="AdaptiveOptions" class="vtkAdaptiveOptions">
...
</AdaptiveOptionsProxy>

which is nice, it instantiates a vtkSMAdaptiveOptions which is a custom SMProxy. All is well, but when I try to use this as a sub proxy on a filter. Paraview ain't happy

    <SourceProxy name="Annoyingfilter" class="vtkAnnoyingFilter">
      <SubProxy>
        < AdaptiveOptionsProxy 
		name = blah blah
This bit ain't working in here.	
        </ AdaptiveOptionsProxy >
      </SubProxy>

I can't make it use my custom proxy as a filter param sub proxy (or use my panel either)

any ideas?

JB

Further to my last message. I see that you've overridden the getProxy in the SMAdaptiveOptionsProxy class. This is good. They can all reuse the same underlying proxy. I tried using a singleton SMproxy itself - I see your way is better - no connection ID problem.

Now I just need to get the filter to take one as a param...

Thanks for the clues. I think I'm getting close.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug: Paraview 3.8.0 - Animation View - "Use Current"
	trouble
Message-ID: <25DD4D945C98C74FA0655C84DB6B849D811D3128D2@GRPANDEX01.mail.erm55.com>

Hello,

I'm using Paraview Ver.3.8.0 on Windows Vista 64-bit. In the Animation View, I added a Camera using the "Interpolate camera locations" option. When I click on the Key Frame Interpolation window to choose the locations, I clicked "Use Current" for a start and end position. Trouble is, the Position and Focal Point values appear to be limited to a maximum of 10,000. When I examine my location using "Adjust Camera" I see the locations I'm interested in are much greater than 10,000 (or less than -10,000). When I run the animation, the camera moves away from my subject matter. I tried using a 32-bit install on a 32-bit Vista machine and had the same problem.

Any help would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Render windows when running parallel pvserver on
	localhost
Message-ID: <AANLkTinuctzQa7sjDB7OhzrPIJrGxDuJW7qP-RHwjH2o@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm wondering if there are any ways to start pvserver in parallel on
localhost without the rendering windows popping up on my screen.  I
understand the render windows need to be created for each of the processors,
but is there a way to send them somewhere else or to a background so they
won't pop up everytime the screen refreshes?  Right now, I can't really work
with it because the windows keep popping up.

Currently I'm running paraview 3.6.2 on Linux RHEL5.  My command to start
pvserver is really simple at the moment.  It's just: mpirun -np 4
/nfs/dana/.../bin/pvserver

Thanks,

One option is to compile with OSMesa and then use
--use-offscreen-rendering command line option for the pvserver.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server talks about
how to compile with OSMesa

That's indeed a  bug. I've added a bug report. It should be fixed by
the next release.

OK. It doesn't work. I misread/understood the Adaptiveoption::getProxy() stuff..

Another question instead :
in vtkSMProxy, suppose I attached to vtkObject::ModifiedEvent and tell the proxy to update all values from the vtkObject - which call will tell the proxy that all values need to be reloaded (MarkAllPropertiesAsModified will push them to vtkObject, but I don't see one for pulling).

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with the Plot Over Line Filter in PV 3.8.0
Message-ID: <SNT123-W37C7E67DDEB64A9FC98EA2BCDF0@phx.gbl>







Hi!

Well, I'm using Windows XP, my graphics card is the Intel 82945G Express Chipset Family. 

The ParaView I'm using is located on a remote computer with Gentoo Linux, kernel version 2.6.31-gentoo-r6. I'm connecting via Putty, using the X11 from Cygwin_NT 5.1. 

Applying the Plot-Over-Line Filter, I get the errors

X Error: GLXUnsupportedPrivateRequest 156
  Extension:    149 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 16 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x570
X Error: GLXUnsupportedPrivateRequest 156
  Extension:    149 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 16 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x570
X Error: BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation) 1
  Extension:    149 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 179 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x570

-) If I try to use the PlotOverLine Filter in PV 3.8.0 directly on the Linux machine, it works fine. 
-) Using the same data and the PlovOverLine of PV 3.6.2 it works fine with the X-Window. 

I've checked the configuration of the X11 -variables in CMake, it seems to be ok (the same configuration as for PV 3.6.2).

Does anyone have an idea what's going wrong?

Thanks,
Natalie

Hi!

It seems that the Plot Over Line filter is buggy in 3.8.0 - I built ParaView from source and applying the Plot Over Line filter to a 2D dataset, I get the following error message:

X Error: GLXUnsupportedPrivateRequest 156


  Extension:    149 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 16 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x570

Apart from that, it does plot something and it seems to be correct, but the display resolution is really low. 



I am not sure what you mean by really low. I wrote a lot of the code for the new 2D charts in ParaView 3.8.0. Could you send me an email off list with a screenshot demonstrating what you mean?


Do you know what could be causing this?

The output from glxinfo and a little more information about the distro you are using, and your graphics card/driver would help.


Thanks,
Marcus

Subject: [Paraview] vtkGL2PSExporter usage from within Paraview's python
	shell
Message-ID: <4C1A3DEB.2010901@duke.edu>

  Hello,

I am trying to figure out how to save a visualization in Paraview 
directly to ps/eps format.

I have compiled from source paraview 3.6 with the configuration option 
VTK_USE_GL2PS set to ON.

There are many hits in the mailing list archives regarding trying to use 
vtkGL2PSExporter to achieve this but I couldn't find anything that I 
could make work.

I know that I can just use WriteImage("test.eps", 
Writer="vtkPostScriptWriter") in the python shell to get what I am 
asking for.

However, I wonder if GL2PS could provide a better looking eps file, and 
having spent a couple of hours on this, I would really like to get to 
the bottom of this.

I have looked at the vtkGL2PSExporter class reference at 
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGL2PSExporter.html and from 
there followed the vtkGL2PSExporter (Tests) link which provides examples 
of unit testing that is done on the class. One example is actually 
titled "test vector EPS output"

However, even after doing a: from paraview import vtk in the python 
shell, when I try to follow the test example and do exp = 
vtk.vtkGL2PSExporter() I get the following error:

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'vtkGL2PSExporter'


Can anyone shine any light on how to actually utilize the 
vtkGL2PSExporter in Paraview to export an .eps, my impression is that it 
has to be done in the Python Shell, and I am not very familiar with Python.

Thank You,
Marcin Sliwowski

Is the data point or cell aligned?

The slice view does not interpolate point centered values across cells
like the 3D view does by design. Feel free to add a feature request to
the bug tracker if you want to add a mode that allows it to do so.

If the data is cell aligned, no views will do interpolation of
values/color within a cell. In a 3D view you can use the cell data to
point data filter and then color by the point aligned array if you
want that effect, but you will see averaging effects that are probably
similar to what you see with clean to grid.

Hello Marcin,

Your question may have already been answered here:
http://markmail.org/message/zd2nwsztxl4xwbhm.

However I think the last time I tried this was in 3.4 so things may have
changed.  In my experience the vtkPostScript writer does a better job
although it has been quite a while since I've tried gl2ps.

Good luck,
Peter.

Hi,

VisIt reader support is provided through the VisItDatabaseBridge plugin.
Currently the plugin does not support the MILI format but we are
investigating support.

  Hello Peter,

I was king of hoping you would reply, I actually saw that post and your 
method of instantiating an object on vtkGL2PSExporter does work after I 
do a from paraview.vtk import *

from paraview.vtk import *
exp = vtkInstantiator.CreateInstance("vtkGL2PSExporter")

I have tried exp.Write() but I get an error indicating: 
vtkGL2PSExporter: No render windows provided

Then I did a couple of stabs in the dark with vtk.vtkRenderWindow() to 
try an get a Render Window object but with no success, I get attribute 
errors that I think are coming from me mixing up namespaces. I am doing 
the import line above and from vtk import *, I wonder if that is messing 
me up. I am going to read up on Python to get to the bottom of this, but 
a quick hint is also appreciated.

Thanks,
Marcin

Hi,

If you look at paraview's vtk/__init__.py, you'll see:

    from libvtkRenderingPython import vtkCamera

So that is why vtk.vtkGL2PSExporter() doesn't work- the complete
vtkRendering kit has not been imported.  You could do this:

from libvtkRenderingPython import vtkGL2PSExporter
exporter = vtkGL2PSExporter()

or

import libvtkRenderingPython as vtkrendering
exporter = vtkrendering.vtkGL2PSExporter()

If you are running this in the paraview gui, you can get the local render
window (vtkRenderWindow) by calling:

view = GetActiveView().GetRenderWindow()


You should understand that you are working directly with vtk objects here.
The paraview way to handle this is to write a proxy xml definition for the
GL2PS exporter.  You can see an example by searching for VRMLExporter in
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/utilities.xml   Then your script might be
something like:

exporters = servermanager.createModule("exporters")
exp = exporters.GL2PSExporter(FileName="/tmp/foo.ps")
exp.View = GetActiveView()
exp.Write()

  Pat,

Thanks for the explanation on the proper import and how to get at the 
local render window. With your help I was able to do what I wanted.

I'm not a Paraview user, but I am supporting someone that is and he 
needed a way to get good looking .ps files out of Paraview. So after 
some initial reading I thought I would write a plugin, then I stumbled 
across using the python shell. Then I figured working with vtk objects 
directly through the shell might be the quickest way to get it done.

I might now look into writing the proxy xml definition as you suggested.

Once I follow the example that you pointed me to, does Paraview need to 
be recompiled once I put my new proxy xml definition in place and if so 
do I need to stick it in a specific place, such as the utilities.xml you 
pointed out? Or can my xml be sort of be loaded dynamically through 
Paraview's plugin manager as long as I build Paraview with shared libs on?

Thanks Again for Your Help,
Marcin

The charts in 3.8.0 use OpenGL to render, whereas the charts in 3.6.2 were
using Qt to render. Could you open a bug report with these details, if you
send me the bug report number I will assign it to myself.

The charts in 3.8.0 are a new implementation, rendering things in a very
different way. I am assuming the 3D widgets in ParaView are still working
normally? I will look into this, it is possible an extension that was
detected server side is being used client side (or similar). I have a laptop
and a desktop with the Intel chipset - I will see if I can reproduce the
failure.

Thanks,

Marcus

Hi,
I wonder how I can change the label of a filter in the pipeline

You can use "RenameSource".

Thanks Utkarsh!

I just found the file Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py,
in which this function is defined. Is there a more convenient
documentation (such as the nightly doxygen) somewhere?

Subject: [Paraview] pvd file and parallel running
Message-ID: <375280.81896.qm@web24908.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to make a Paraview Visualisation with a parallel processors run. I dividied my surface grid in 4 different parts and each one will run in a different processor. I create *.pvd files containing the data of the corresponding timestep and the dates from each partition. Like the following (for the first timestep):

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep="1.00" part="001" file="out1-1.vtk"/>
<DataSet timestep="1.00" part="002" file="out1-2.vtk"/>
<DataSet timestep="1.00" part="003" file="out1-3.vtk"/>
<DataSet timestep="1.00" part="004" file="out1-4.vtk"/>
</Collection>
</VTKFile>

The problem is that when I try to apply the file Paraview closes directly, like it would not be able to open such file. What's wrong? Could be that it can not be files with the same timestep in a *.pvd file? If that's the case, how I can open different datafiles for the same timestep ?

Thanx

Llapis

A PVD file cannot point to legacy vtk files. It requires XML-based vtk
files (vtp, vtu, vti etc. not vtk).

Subject: [Paraview] white legend using vtkGL2PSExporter
Message-ID: <8AB69A08-378C-4C6F-B34A-4FEF7A9E94CA@duke.edu>

Hello,

I am using paraview 3.6 compiled with VTK_GL2PS_ON.

When I uncheck "Interpolate Colors" in Object Inspector for the object I want to plot, I am able to generate colored high quality eps images using the following command in the python shell:

from libvtkRenderingPython import vtkGL2PSExporter
exporter = vtkGL2PSExporter()
exporter.SetFileFormatToPS()
exporter.SetFilePrefix("testImage")
view = GetActiveView().GetRenderWindow()
exporter.SetRenderWindow(view)
exporter.Write()

However, the legend is colored white.  My guess is that I am still interpolating colors for the legend and I do not know how to specify not to do it?

Thanks a lot for your help!

-Martin

Hi Martin,

No, it's not due to colors still being interpolated. I tracked the very
issue down myself a year ago or so. What you are seeing happens since

commit 8fe6d5fa88c7ecbb1420776850f176690b504c71
Author: Ken Moreland <kmorel at sandia.gov>
Date:   Tue Nov 25 09:28:25 2008 -0500

  ENH: add tickmarks to scalar bar widget (and other improvements).  BUG
#6217.

The problem is that along with the bug fix the legend is now realized as
an overlay texture. That's something GL2PS does not handle properly. I
don't recall all the details any more, especially not the class, but I
think I tracked it further down to an early exit of kind if-overlay- or
if-texture-then-return in a render call during the export. Anyway, it
comes down to VTK/Rendering/vtkGL2PSExporter.cxx not being able to
handle the legend properly, hence the legend is stripped off all colors.

I'm using a pre-November 2008 version of
Servers/Filters/vtkPVScalarBarActor.{h,cxx} ever since, ParaView does
compile smoothly with it ever since and the legend is colorful in
vectorgraphics Postscript exports ever since. So, even though you're
using 3.6 and not git master, it should be feasible to simply revert
mentioned commit to solve the issue.

Hope that helps.

Sven

I am going to go with yes even though I can't give the recipe from
the top of my head.

It should be a matter of using the plot over line filter and then
whatever statistics filter does mean. I know that there is at least
one.

Subject: [Paraview] openGL ERROR with chart views
Message-ID: <4C1F1EED.5010605@sirehna.com>

Hi,

Using paraview 3.8.0 on windows 32 bits, raise me the following error 
when opening a new chart window :

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\Rendering\vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx, line 
358

vtkOpenGLExtensionManager (241D2150): Extension GL_VERSION_1_5 could not 
be loaded.



My graphic card is ATI radeon xpress 1150 series


This makes the paraview gui slower when interacting with the chart (even 
with the error, the chart is visible anyway). Is there any solution to 
avoid this error.

Thanks.

Hi Dave,

Sorry for the delay. I now believe there may be a better fix respecting
DESTDIR as the python modules of vtk don't exhibit this problem.
I have to look it up a little bit further.

Phil/Jereme,

FYI, this has now been fixed in "master" and will make it into 3.8.1 release.

Here's the VTK commit for the change:

Subject: [Paraview] core dump from pvserver on Fedora linux with nvidia
	195.36.24
Message-ID: <4C1FBA2F.6080505@phy.duke.edu>

Hello,

We are seeing pvserver crash when it tries to access nvidia hardware. 
I've see this on both Fedora 12 and 13 with nvidia driver 195.36.24 
installed from rpmfusion. Running with "--use-offscreen-rendering" works.

The crash happens after a window named "Visualiztion Toolkit - OpenGL" 
comes up on the pvserver system. More technical details are in this bug 
report:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=606473

Any suggestions would be welcomed!

Thanks,
Jimmy Dorff

It should be a matter of using the plot over line filter and then
whatever statistics filter does mean. I know that there is at least
one.

Subject: [Paraview] Qt Creator as IDE for ParaView
Message-ID: <835828E6B553451B89D70AECD8CE6254@notebook>

Hi All,

I am planning on setting up Qt Creator as my cross platform IDE for things
like ParaView. 

I am wondering if anyone else has tried this and if they were successful?

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview]  What is planned about Antialiasing?
Message-ID: <4C20CAD0.40308@onera.fr>

Hello,

On this mailing list  (AntiAliasing, Aug 2009), Pat Marion said that the 
only way to get antialiasing was to recompile PV with MultiSamples 
enabled, and Utkarsh Ayachit said that it should be an option in the 
Settings menu.
Actually, PV 3.8.0 seems to have no Antialiasing option in the Setting 
menu, and it always gives ugly "saw tooth" pictures if some object sides 
are almost horizontal or almost vertical (PV 3.8.0 on Windows or Linux, 
both with NVIDIA graphic card).
A workaround is to check the option "Override Application Setting" in 
the NVIDIA control panel ant it gives pretty pictures. But using "Save 
Screenshot" in the PV "File" menu saves an image without antialiasing! I 
tried to save a PNG image and I did not see any antialiasing option.The 
workaround to save a picture with antialiasing is to make a capture of 
the PV window using the "Print Scrn" key on the keyboard... and to crop 
the picture with some other imaging software to remove menu panels.
So what are the plans about setting antialiasing in future PV releases?

Best regards

Message-ID: <4C20DAD5.3060609@onera.fr>

Hello.

Bug with Text sources in PV 3.8.0.
When inserting annotations (menu "Sources/Text") on a 3D window, the 
default text location is lower left corner of the window. Moving 
annotations on the 3D window, then saving the state file (pvsm). When 
reading the state file, all text fields are always at the default lower 
left corner location.

Subject: [Paraview] Indication of delay between interactive and still render?
Message-ID: <C8463A57.16EFF%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I just got a chance to try out the new feature that pauses for 2 seconds between the last interactive render and the still render to give you a chance to make further movements (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10232).  Totally cool.

One thing I noticed though is that there is no indication of an intentional pause.  Is there a subtle way to let the user know when the interface is pausing and when it is busy rendering?  Or is it fine the way it is?

Hi Richard,

See http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=8789 and
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10521

It's fixed in git master, not yet pushed to the release branch for PV 3.8.1, though.

Subject: [Paraview] PV & multiple video cards
Message-ID: <4C20FAFB.9020003@gmail.com>

Hi,

currently we suggest users rely on details particular to specific MPI 
implementations 
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#Multiple_GPUs_Per_Node) 
to set up PV server on clusters with multiple graphics cards per node. 
It seems to me that this reliance on non standard implementation details 
isn't necessary for the most common case and it can introduce some 
complication to get PV running on various installations.

There is something simple that we could do to make users life easier. 
ParaView could handle a common configuration of multiple graphics cards 
seamlessly with very little effort via an additional command line option.

Two common ways to address multiple video devices in X11 via the DISPLAY 
variable are, 1) by server id (":[server].0") or 2) by screen id 
(":0.[screen]").  It depends on how X11 is setup, but I think the latter 
is the most common.

If the user were to tell PV how many video devices are available on each 
node via the following command line variable, PV could assign rendering 
contexts cyclically across the available devices by setting the DISPLAY 
variable for the user.

--number-of-gpu-per-host=N

as each server starts he will make the computation to set the DISPLAY 
variable so that render contexts are cycled across the available devices.

For example, something like the folowing could be added to 
Filters/vtkPVMain.cxx

if (numGpuPerHost)
  {
  int screenId=LocalProcId%numGpuPerHost
  setenv("DISPALY=:0.%i",screenId)
  }

This would conflict with the "-display" option, if both are present PV 
would exit and print some error message.

Do you guys think this would be a reasonable approach to handle a common 
use case?

Hi,

I realized that my suggestion relies on processes being assigned in a 
particular order. So something slightly more complicated would need to 
be done to determine the number of processes running on each host. Still 
it would be pretty simple way to make folks lives easier. Let me know 
what you think.

Can you run pvserver under gdb and give us a stack trace? Also, is X
configured to allow the user running pvserver to create a window?

I think this is a good suggestion.  I don't think the fact that it relies on processes being assigned in a particular order is a big deal.  The default allocation is usually to place contiguous ranks in the same node anyway.  The tiled display options also have heavy reliance on the order in which processes are assigned, and I don't recall complaints about that.

The only change I would suggest is to not have an option named --number-of-gpu-per-host change the display parameter.  The option name should reflect the fact that it is going to override the display environment variable.  Offhand, I cannot think of a single option name that reflects both the fact that you are changing the display and providing the number of screen ids to use.  Perhaps you would have two options, the --number-of-gpu-per-host as you described and a something like --set-display-server-id-by-process-id.  Since one does not make sense without the other, you could give an error if one is used independently.

Yes, in this case the pvserver user is on the local GUI console and has 
full X11 access.

Are you able to run any other OpenGL based application such as
glxgears or something?

By the way, if we wanted to go all the way on this, we would also
support Windows. I was told that there is an nvidia-specific function
that controls the GPU a context uses. I believe that it is this:

http://developer.download.nvidia.com/opengl/specs/WGL_nv_gpu_affinity.txt

I have no idea if ATI supports this.

Yes, glxgears runs fine. I'll send glxinfo results out in a bit.

So yes, glxgears runs very well. A Quadro FX 4800 is overkill 
for that ;)

I've attached the glxinfo from one of these systems.

Thanks,

When I add a camera (orbit) to the animation view, it seems to pick an
orientation (not the current view) and then orbits around and returns
to the same point. Is there a way to make it start the orbit at the
current view?

Thanks,

That would be cleanest solution, but Nvidia provides it only for Windows and only for Quadro cards.

Hi,

I would like to create a spreadsheet view from within a python plugin.
I have methods like CreateRenderView() and CreateXYPlotView(), but I
cannot find a CreateSpreadSheetView().

Is there a workaround?  Like creating a RenderView() then converting
it into a spreadsheetview?

I tried the Tracing stuff, but the code it output created a black 3D
renderview.

Thanks for any help

Matt

Sorry it's not in the formal api right now, but you can do it with:

paraview.simple._create_view("SpreadSheetView")

Subject: [Paraview] Cropping 2D patterns
Message-ID: <AANLkTikei4vhEf2C6bEnbV0VQDB-QK1CjFLvBslFtkUz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have to produce figures of a rather large number of patterns on a square.
At the moment I load .vtk files into a 2D View. When I save the screenshots
in .png, though, the patterns are embedded in their background color.

Is there any way to make sure that the pattern is cropped, so that in the
final .png file does not contain the background?

As of now, I can only think of "Zoom to box", but I would try something else
if possible, given that:

1) there are really a lot of patterns to draw
2) Zoom to box is not accurate (unless I am able somehow to specify the box
coordinates numerically)
3) Zoom to box seems to fit (and eventually distort) the pattern to the
current window, which may be not square.

Best.
Daniele

Subject: [Paraview] mean over... direction?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikMRloescLGPrtcroMrUfhArqm5rjrfX5bAIM4U@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I'm wondering if it's possible with Paraview to mean a field "over a
direction" so that, given a mesh that for example has a 2D shape that have
been extruded in z-direction, the variables of the field will be averaged in
z
Thanks in advance,

Hi again, 
thanks for the response. Now my question is how can i create
a script which tells PARAVIEW to open a certain number of vtk files at
once and visualize them all together? 

Thanx one more time

Dear All,

When using the contour filter, is it possible to display labels beside each
contour line that shows its magnitude?

Message-ID: <C84781AB.16FAB%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I have two comments.  First, I think Burlen's original idea should be implemented before and potentially added independently of the Windows solution.  Setting the display screen based on process id is pretty trivial.  In my experience, solutions involving OpenGL extensions tend to be harder to implement than you think and fraught with difficulties to support.

Second, I'm disheartened by how labyrinthine it is to control which GPU an OpenGL context uses.  I'll refrain from starting a Windows rant (and for what it's worth, I understand Mac is just as bad).  Instead, I'd like to point out that Kitware has been working with Microsoft's HPC development to support visualization, and perhaps they could encourage Microsoft to provide a better solution.  After all, HPC visualization is not really supported if you cannot make use of every GPU available.

After Francois comments I thought VTK might attempt to hide the cross 
platform/ vendor/ device complexity for us inside 
vtkRenderWindow::SetGPUAffinity(...). Or some such method.

OK. I wouldn't be surprised if you already had coded this and committed 
given its triviality, if not is this something I can commit?

Subject: [Paraview] How to compile and use ParaView 3.8.0 on Windows XP
Message-ID: <AANLkTilOtbYx7ih4_mqPB2x1qZwwaouINzzJGvgy4iBj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Ken, hi all.
I read http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Build_ParaViewbut
I need more information about compiling and using ParView 3.8.0 on a
workstation with windows XP and a single GPU shared amongst the cores:

1) should I install Qt >= 4.5.0? How can I compile it?

2) should I install MS-MPI? where can I find it?

3) on linux I use a command similar to: "mpirun -np 2 pvserver --display:
0.0 --use-offscreen-rendering" to run pvserver in parallel, but on windows I
have these questions:
   - how can I run pvserver in parallel?
   - how can I/should I specify to share the single GPU amongst the cores?
on linux I use the paramenter "--display: 0.0" as explained in:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#Sharing_GPUs_Amongst_Processes

Thank you very much

1. You want to use 4.6.x. You can install Qt from the nokia website if your
compiler matches the one they used to build with (VS 2008). Or you can build
it yourself.

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp-vs2008

<http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp-vs2008>2. MS-MPI or MPICH2 should
both work fine. MS-MPI is here:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=13644DCD-4022-4BBC-B18F-1C9E9461D5BD&displaylang=en

<http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=13644DCD-4022-4BBC-B18F-1C9E9461D5BD&displaylang=en>MPICH2
is here:

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/

<http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/>3. you run pvserver the
exact same way but the command is typically called mpiexec. I don't think
you need to specify any display options to share the GPU on the local host.

You have to write each file individually. However, you can do it just
a few lines without copy-pasting as follows:

exporters = servermanager.createModule("exporters")
vrml = exporters.VRMLExporter()

for d in range(3):
  vrml.FileName = "/tmp/%d.vrml" % d
  vrml.View = GetActiveView()
  vrml.Write()

If you just want to install ParaView on your windows machine there is a
ms-mpi paraview installer available at
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html.  As far as I know all
you need to do is also install ms-mpi on your machine and you should be set
for running paraview in parallel.

That is really a good point. The more I use it, the more I realize
this is absolutely essential. But how ? :). What could serve as a good
indication?

I am afraid not. This is not an easy filter to write for most mesh types.

1. Different colors on the border surrounding the pane (but this  
competes with the red/blue indicating which pane is "Active")
2. An LED-like glyph in the pane's title bar?
3. A small overlay in one corner of the pane? (Ken's favorite: a pie  
chart showing either time remaining before a still render or time  
spent waiting for a still render to finish. :-)

You should be able to open the CMakeLists.txt in the ParaView source
directory, choose a build directory and then run cmake. After that I often
run cmake-gui in the build directory and get everything set up the way I
want it.

On the whole it works very well, and I mainly go back to vim to edit CMake
files. I would like to add some  syntax highlighting for CMake so I don't
need to do that either. You can alter the build options and pass -j8 (or
whatever is appropriate), and change the binary to ParaView.

They also just released Qt Creator 2, and I highly recommend the upgrade.

Thanks,

Marcus

No, the paraview client works OK. The server doesn't crash if started 
with the "--use-offscreen-rendering" option.

I don't think I've tried running standalone on the systems with the high 
end graphics cards... I can try that tomorrow.

All are good suggestions but won't it confuse people into thinking
that paraview is busy doing something which may result in people
waiting to interact until the overlay disappears which till have
totally reverse effect :).

Subject: [Paraview] "Rescale to Data Range" fails
Message-ID: <AANLkTilUnVTYE5Ww_cowbFf1XHEu0-NSdiy2VA59LRZX@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just tried the following using ParaView 3.8.0:
  1. Sources->Wavelet->Apply
  2. Object Inspector: Dispaly tab->Representation: Wireframe -> Color
by: RTData
But "Data Range" displays [0, 1] inspite of  [37.3531, 276.829] and
"Rescale to Data Range" button does't work.  Is this a ParaView bug?

Thanks,
yoshimi

Well, then we'll have to come up with some subtle psychological twist to let people know. Perhaps the overlay could be of a prone person who, after 2 seconds, stands up and performs calisthenics until the still render is complete. ;-)

Or more seriously, the overlay could be present during all interactive rendering and just start "counting down" (I still prefer a clock-like wedge to a countdown, especially given that it's a short 2-second interval) when the mouse is released. That way the overlay's presence indicates interactive rendering, a modified form would indicate the still rendering is being performed, and its absence indicates that the image is a completed still rendering.

Subject: [Paraview] [paraview] paraview workflow management capabilities
Message-ID: <AANLkTinTQSLyfgtnx8WiFrIhopLDwa2LVQpzeFtEFp8j@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaView user,

Maybe someone could shed some light on this topic.


I would like to know if the "pipeline browser" of ParaView offers some
"advanced workflow management".

Basically, if one wants to loop over a sequence of "filters", or
conditionally execute some, all of this in bath mode, is this possible
through some configurations in the pipeline?

I am actually thinking to this because the python script filter gives access
to a very wide range of tools, and the ergonomy of ParaView and its
miscellaneous solutions:
- the pipeline and filter configuration,
- interaction with the viewers (2D, 3D, spreadsheet...)
- distributed computations
are very good, and such features are susually the ones we find in other
workflow management solutions.

This would then have been nice to be able benefit from it for more complex
workflow management

I thank you in advance for any advices.

Regards,

Pierre

Message-ID: <5861C625258167499D051F0CE1D0FE4B031CF43C@GLKMS2104.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi All,
 
I'm looking for a way to put custom filters generated within paraview
(as cpd files) into my own categories in the filters menu.  Reading
this:
 
http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg02907.html it seems
it can be done but I can't find any examples.  Could someone post the
changes that have to be made to cpd files to make them ServerManager XML
files?  I then assume you create an accompanying xfilterGUI.xml and run
them through cmake to produce a xfilter.so file which you then read in
with Manage Plugins?
 
Many Thanks,
 
Duncan

This seems to work properly for me for my 3.9 build.  You'll have to give
information to figure out the problem (e.g. paraview version, os, etc.).

Hey Duncan,

I'll attach an example directory which contains a cpd file from a custom filter I defined to just glyph with spheres. It's marked in the servermanager xml file and in the cpd file that you just copy and paste the CompoundSourceProxy section from the cpd file and add it inside the ProxyGroup section of the xml. You then add a name="..." and optionally a label="..." to the CompoundSourceProxy line. The rest of it is just like described in 

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_Categories_to_the_Filters_Menu

and the section on adding icons. You create a build directory, and point ccmake to a ParaView build directory and it will create a library which can be loaded in ParaView with Manage Plugins, as you said.

The servermanager XML itself with the custom filter pasted in can just be loaded, too, if you want your custom filter as a plugin but don't need the new filters menu category. In principle, the wiki seems to suggest that the GUI xml for the menu item and an icon qrc file can both be compiled together using Qt's rcc to allow the custom menu item and icon along with the servermanager XML to be loaded into ParaView without needing to build the plugin against ParaView, but I've never been able to figure that part out...

Anyway, here's the example. Good luck,
-Eric

Can you try running paraview as follows and see if the problem goes away?

./paraview -dr

Subject: [Paraview] Indication of delay between interactive and still
 render?
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTinh-n-oSvakIP9Fb4OKklr6k_6MFlngVY5M4maq@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C84A505C.321C%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I actually think 3 is a good idea, too.  Except you may want to put it in the pane's title bar.  I also like 2, but I would augment it such that the LED starts out bright and then dims.  It's timed so that the LED is all the way dim the render starts.  It has the same effect as a spinning thing or progress bar, but would probably be less distracting.

A nice feature might also be that when you click the whatever-it-is, the render starts immediately.  A tooltip that could be active even when the whatever-it-is is not doing anything could be helpful in explaining what it is for.

1. Different colors on the border surrounding the pane (but this competes with the red/blue indicating which pane is "Active")
2. An LED-like glyph in the pane's title bar?
3. A small overlay in one corner of the pane? (Ken's favorite: a pie chart showing either time remaining before a still render or time spent waiting for a still render to finish. :-)

One thing I noticed though is that there is no indication of an intentional
pause.  Is there a subtle way to let the user know when the interface is
pausing and when it is busy rendering?  Or is it fine the way it is?

I have my own reader for AMR data which produces only PointData, no CellData.

When doing Contour (with a recent CVS version), I get errors like this, and then a crash:

ERROR: In /local/data/jfavre/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkAMRDualGridHelper.cxx, line 727
vtkAMRDualGridHelper (0x2abe6e0): Could not find the data type size.

Can the Grid Helper not handle PointData only?

Subject: [Paraview] Modifying pipeline browser of Paraview
Message-ID: <AANLkTinzY1JW4XIS1eq5imkWfOpB_iW3kI_Jm9n_7P1T@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to modify the paraview pipeline browser in a Qt-based custom
visualization applications using ParaView's Parallel Visualization framework
(Version 3.8.0). For example I want to modify it to show only the data
charged without any filter representation. In order to setup the context
menu for the *pipeline* browser I have added this line in the constructor
for QMainWindow:
------
pqParaViewMenuBuilders::buildPipelineBrowserContextMenu(
    *this->Internals->pipelineBrowser);
------
Any help would be most appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Remove opengl window while saving images from Python
	script
Message-ID: <AANLkTikxI4nWIePpEMLc-LkGy_7KNcYQSlS5R7cwq1bo@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to generate png images from a pvd file using python.
However, when I do this, several windows are opened and closed quickly ...
(which is really annoying for my application),

Is anybody know a way to get rid of these windows ???

I am using paraview 3.8

I tried already the : view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = False
parameter but it doesn't really help!

Here is my python code:

Best Regards,

Laurent

def generatePNGFileFromParaview(inFile, outFile):
    # Instantiate a Paraview VTU reader
    reader = OpenDataFile(inFile)
    # Parameter stored in ini file
    min_val = 300
    max_val = 1922.35
    ScalarBarTitle = "Temperature"
    ColorArrayName = 't'
    PictureTitle = "Temperature"
    Magnification=1  # PNG Zoom factor

    lt = MakeBlueToRedLT(max_val, min_val)

    bar = CreateScalarBar(LookupTable=lt, Title=ScalarBarTitle)
    bar.LabelColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    bar.TitleColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    bar.LabelFontSize = 12
    bar.AspectRatio   = 15.0
    bar.AutomaticLabelFormat = 0

    Show()
    Render()

    view = GetActiveView()
    view.Background = [1,1,1]  # White

    view.ViewSize = [800, 600] # Size in pixel of the output

    # I tried to set this value to True or False, but the opengl
windows are still opened
    view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = False


    ResetCamera(view)

    dp = GetDisplayProperties()
    dp.ColorArrayName = ColorArrayName

    rep = GetRepresentation()
    rep.LookupTable = lt

    view.Representations.append(bar)

    # Add text for load
    text = Text()
    text.Text = PictureTitle

    repr = Show(text)
    repr.Color    = [0,0,0]
    repr.FontSize = 12

    Render()
    WriteImage('stage1.png', Magnification=2)

    Delete(rep)
    Delete(view)
    Delete(reader)

The -dr option is to disable the registry.  It is used to store default
settings which on my ubuntu machine gets stored in the ~/.config/ParaView/
directory.  If you rename/remove the files in that directory the problem
should go away (those files will be regenerated the next time you run
paraview without the -dr flag).  Let me know if that doesn't work.

Hi,

 

I recently set up a visualization server, running several processors. I
am able to connect my client machines to this server and use all
processors without any problems. 

 

Can Paraview be used with multiple processors in a stand-alone mode? How
would I set this up?

 

Thanks

Jean,

I developed "vtkAMRDualGridHelper" and the AMR filters that use it
specifically for CTH and FLASH files.  They be not process point data yet.
If my plans work out, I will extend the filters to be more general later
this year.

Charles.

WAIT! WAIT!  Once you find your config file, please send us a copy before you delete it.  That way we can take a look and try to figure out what went wrong.

Not really. You can always run the pvserver on the same machine in
parallel and then connect with the client to the pvserver on
localhost.

I find the following lines in the ParaView3.8.0.ini:
---------------------------------------------
  <Property name=\"VectorComponent\" id=\"449.VectorComponent\"
number_of_elements=\"1\">\n
    <Element index=\"0\" value=\"4\"/>\n
    <Domain name=\"range\" id=\"449.VectorComponent.range\">\n
      <Min index=\"0\" value=\"0\"/>\n
      <Max index=\"0\" value=\"0\"/>\n
    </Domain>\n
  </Property>\n
---------------------------------------------
I change the following and the problem goes away.
  <Element index=\"0\" value=\"4\"/>\n
----->
  <Element index=\"0\" value=\"0\"/>\n

Please try steps to reproduce the problem:
 1. Sources -> Sphere -> Apply
 2. Object Inspector: Display: Color by: Normals: Z
 3. Edit Color Map -> Make Default -> Close
 4. File -> Exit
After that, "Rescale to Data Range" doesn't work with scalar data.

Subject: [Paraview] crashes in loading vtu in pvserver/client mode
Message-ID: <4C29A2DC.20100@scconsultants.com>

Hello ,

for many versions we faced regular crashes when loading a vtu in 
client/server mode. The same problem remains with V3.8.0

error message from putty(openSSH terminal)
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
Password:

                                                            ERROR: In

                 vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0xb0d4f0): Cannot read 
cell data array "EpsXX(1/s)" from PointData in piece 0.  The data array 
in the element may be too short.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

1/ generally, the problem occurs on vectors data
2/ the vtu loading works fine when loading locally
3/ the same problem occurs whith differents pvservers installations
4/ the server is a linux based and we use the pre-compiled versions from 
http://www.paraview.org

thanks for any support in this critical issue for us.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualizations works converted to python code
Message-ID: <b9b2b27214eb8e778426472aec6b0cc0.squirrel@webmail.iitk.ac.in>

Hi,
I am working on a set of images and have to carry out many filters and
changes in the color schemes before taking a snapshot of it.
Can we get our work converted into python code? ...
or is the work stored into some python file when we work already?
so that we can only change the input file name and run the code on the
python shell
As our work has been completed already ,so this would be very helpful to
run it on multiple files.

One more doubt : how do we use the exported color scheme in paraview from
python shell ?

Thank You in advance

Hi Carolyn,

I was able to finally track down a machine with this compiler, reproduce and
fix it last night. I apologize for the delay. That machine now submits a
nightly dashboard to VTK so we know right away when it breaks.

ParaView supports tracing your actions into Python as your are doing
them in the GUI as well as save the current state in a python script.

Hi,

But when execute this code, do you have an 'opengl vtk window' automatically
opened ?

Is it possible to get rid of this window ?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF writing problem
Message-ID: <4C2A0F1A.6040807@icp.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hello programmers,

I'm new to this list, I'm not sure I'm asking in the right place, but
I'll try to ask and I hope I'll get the answer I'm looking for :) .

I have an HDF5 file which is an array of 8-bit double 3D array of
pressure values for a sample I have, the size of this array is
320x304x304. I'm trying to read this file to (visualise it in) Paraview,
and I heard that I have to write an XDMF file for that. So I started
reading about it, but the final result I got was not pleasing. I
attached with this e-mail the XDMF file I wrote for this purpose
(reading my data.h5 file).

Could someone please tell me what's wrong in my XDMF?

Thank you, any efforts are highly appreciated.

Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering a sub-class of vtkImageData in paraview
Message-ID: <517CA7C1B1D645499358F065FAF2CCDE034C6EBA@GLKMS2103.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi,
 
I have written a sub-class of vtkImageData that holds additional
information for processing the data further down the pipeline.  When a
filter outputs my sub-class, Paraview gives the message "Cannot show the
data in the current view although the view reported that it can show the
data."
 
How do I tell Paraview that it should render my sub-class in the same
way as a vtkImageData object.

John

Hello Samer,

You may need to explain a bit more what you mean by "the final result I got was not pleasing". 

It looks like there may be a problem in that you are defining 320x304x304 points for your grid, but you also are stating that the same number of Pressure attributes exist, centered on the cells. If you really have that many pressure values, you should probably put them as Center="Node", otherwise there should be one less value in each direction, as the cells will be implicitly defined between the points.

(Also, you probably already know this, but if your grid has a constant spacing in each direction you can either use 3DRectMesh or 3DCoRectMesh topology and not have to specify the XYZ positions of the points.)

If changing cell centered to point centered doesn't help, just explain a little more about what's not working and we'll try to help more. There is also an Xdmf mailing list, but this is an okay place to post for now if you're trying to load your data into ParaView.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Problems building 3.8.0 for 64-bit Mac
Message-ID: <AANLkTimfzogMguvLHf_4PZon7TF-oEcSGQjICOsN97s4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I just downloaded the 3.8.0 source and am trying to compile a 64-bit
version on Mac OS 10.5. During the build of the pqWidgets target, this
error occurs:

.../ParaView-3.8.0/Qt/Widgets/pqProgressBarHelper.cxx:37: error: type
'class QObject' is not a direct base of 'pqProgressBarHelper'

There seems to be an error in the source. Here's the class declaration
in pqProgressBarHelper.h:

#ifdef Q_WS_MAC
class pqProgressBarHelper : public QWidget
#else
class pqProgressBarHelper : public QObject
#endif

But then in the constructor in pqProgressBarHelper.cxx is this:

pqProgressBarHelper::pqProgressBarHelper(pqProgressBar* p)
: QObject(p), Progress(p)
{
}

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Ben

If you look at Qt/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt, around line #79, it doesn't
add pqProgressBarHelper.cxx as a source to compile on macs, instead it
uses pqProgressBarHelper.mm. Now the question why isn't that happening
in your case.  Try adding the following;

message( "Q_WS_MAC == ${Q_WS_MAC}")

What does that print out when you run cmake?

It just prints out:
Q_WS_MAC ==

I'm not sure what is responsible for setting that variable; I've only
ever seen it used in C++ source as a preprocessor define, not in CMake
source.

Thanks,
Ben

Hi Ben, can you send us your CMakeCache.txt in the root of your build tree.

I know this is a fairly old email but I no longer get a seg fault with
3.8.0.  I'm not sure who fixed the bug but thank you.

This would probably require changing the ParaView code in a few places. I
suspect that we have things like

if (classname == "vtkImageData")

all over the place. However, there may be a better solution. Can you explain
what additional information you are storing in this subclass?

Thanks Berk,
 
I need to store the viewpoint from which the image was created.
Originally, I was storing this information in the "Information" member
of vtkDataObject and that worked correctly.  I have now got a set of
images calculated from different viewpoints stored in a
vtkMultiBlockDatset.  I want to process these images using plug-in
filters that are not composite dataset aware and then re-combine the
images using the viewpoint information.  The problem is that the
"vtkCompositeDataPipeline::ExecuteSimpleAlgorithmForBlock" method does a
shallow copy of the output from the plug-in and the viewpoint
information is lost.  My idea was to use a sub-class of vtkImageData and
override the ShallowCopy method to preserve the viewpoint information.
This, however, leads to the problem of how to render the sub-class in
Paraview.
 
Any suggestions on how to resolve these problems would be gratefully
received.
 
Regards,
John

*** WARNING *** This message has originated outside your organisation,
either from an external partner or the Global Internet. Keep this in
mind if you answer this message. This would probably require changing
the ParaView code in a few places. I suspect that we have things like 

if (classname == "vtkImageData")

all over the place. However, there may be a better solution. Can you
explain what additional information you are storing in this subclass?

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF writing problem
Message-ID: <2cd6195956e755a5bc42dc5c34df7f6b.squirrel@www.ica1.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hello Eric,

Thank you for your answer. Actually what I mean with not pleasing, is that
the program is crashing a lot, giving this message in the terminal.

XDMF Error in
/build/buildd/paraview-3.4.0/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfValuesHDF.cxx line
77 (Can't Open Dataset data.h5:/X)
XDMF Error in
/build/buildd/paraview-3.4.0/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfDataItem.cxx line
498 (Reading Values Failed)
XDMF Error in
/build/buildd/paraview-3.4.0/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfGrid.cxx line 607
(Error in Update() of Geometry)
Segmentation fault

I'm aware that my data does not contain XYZ information, it only contains
pressure data, but when I remove the XYZ information from my XDMF I get a
null shape in paraview (of course, because there won't be a geometry
then), and the "volume" preview is wouldn't be available, only surface and
some other useless choices, and they all give empty views. Therefore I'm
not sure how I can tell the program that those pressures correspond to a
grid.

Starting from the very beginning, I got this file "data.h5" from someone
telling me that it's the output of some analysis for pressure. I need to
visualise this file to understand the type before I do the analysis on my
sample. I used the program hdfview to view its contents, and I found that
it's a 3D matrix of 8-byte doubles, every double contains a pressure, and
the dimensions of this matrix is 320x304x304, and this is the only
information I have.

The size of the file is 225 MB, which is equal to: 8*304*304*320 bytes. In
other words the data file does not contain any other information about the
coordinates.

I wrote this XDMF file while I don't really understand what I'm doing,
it's just the first step, so I don't know anything like different mesh(s)
and so on.

I expected to get a 3D view for my samples with different colours per
pressure, isn't this what I should get?

Now the question, does it suffice to state only the pressure information
in the XDMF file without coordinates? and what should paraview show me for
such data? is it colour per voxel as I expected? is what I'm doing the
right way to visualise this data?

For convenience, I uploaded the data file to Megaupload, please find it at

http://www.megaupload.com/?d=F8M6XU4D

Thank you, I really appreciate the time you're using for this.

Best regards,
Samer

hi again, 

thanks for the response. So i understand i have to create a file contraining this information (reffering to my files) to open it later directly with Paraview. Which type of file should be? because i tried many files and still not work. Paraview ask me to chose a reader to open it. Maybe I should know also which reader. Here is the information contained in the file to be open.

from paraview.simple import *

reader1 = OpenDataFile(?out1-1.vtk?)
reader2 = OpenDataFile("out1-2.vtk")
reader3 = OpenDataFile(?out1-3.vtk?)
reader4 = OpenDataFile("out1-4.vtk")

Show(reader1)
Show(reader2)
Show(reader3)
Show(reader4)

Render()

Oh, I see. I was about to write that we should change ShallowCopy() to copy
the Information but I realized that this would have some really bad side
effects. We use Information to store some pipeline meta-data and we don't
want those copied. The easiest way to get around this is to store the
meta-data in FieldData. FieldData arrays should always be copied.

Hey Samer,

You had the right idea, looking at the HDF5 file with hdfview, but since the file doesn't contain any coordinate information, you will want to use one of the regular grid meshes where you set the origin and spacing of the mesh in each direction and then the positions of the nodes are implicitly defined. I can't tell if the grid spacing is buried somewhere in the metadata for your file, but there's a lot of into there, so it might be.

Besides the model and format page (http://xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format), if you download the Xdmf source code there are a lot of examples of .xmf files in [xdmf_src]/Examples/Data.

Following is a .xmf file that works for me and a screenshot from ParaView.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] PV on Windows with VS requirements
Message-ID: <BAY148-w143084E0E4FFBD3D547693B2CC0@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I want to to be able to develop plugins for PV on Windows XP.
This requires that I compile PV (vs using pre-compiled binaries), right?
So I need Qt for VS but VS is only supported by Qt through commercial versions, which means that I need to build a commercial version of Qt to be able to have a development version of PV, am I still right?

You can either build Qt yourself or download their pre-built Qt. Both use
the LGPL license. It needs to match your version of VS though. For 4.6.3 you
need to use Visual Studio 2008 if you use their binaries. Otherwise you will
need to build it yourself.

But their pre-built version is, by default, built on MinGW (at least those that is listed in their GPL download page).And using the version attached to the link below implies having VS2008, while only VS2010 is now available (someone here reported compatibility issues between VS2008 and VS2010, that is Microsoft lol).If you can tell me where to find VS2008, it may help me.

Are you talking about where to get Visual Studio 2008 Express? You can
download it from here:

http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2008-Visual-CPP

That should match the VS 2008 Qt on the nokia website.

Subject: [Paraview] VTK Visualization Window hangs when using pvpython.exe
	window
Message-ID: <AANLkTikIjvSmQX7rbnh3Hp37FOWUnwZ3roE4Y-rBtaFC@mail.gmail.com>

I am new to both Python and Paraview...

In a Windows environment, Paraview 3.8, I want to be able to plot 3d images
in a separate paraview window (not using the paraview GUI). When using the
pvpython.exe Python window and the following commands:

import os
import paraview
from paraview.simple import *
from paraview.servermanager import *
Connect()
sph=Sphere()
elev=Elevation(sph)
Show(elev)
Render()

This creates a new window and renders a sphere, but the window locks up and
I get an hourglass whenever the mouse pointer is inside the plot window. The
only way to get rid of the plot is to kill my pvpython.exe window.

When I use the same commands from the Python command window provided by the
GUI, these commands work fine.

How can I make the pvpython.exe separate window work like the GUI/Python
command window?

Thanks,

Ted Thompson

Berk,
 
Tried your suggestion and stored the viewpoint information in the
FieldData.  This works correctly even when the data is a block in a
MultiBlockDataset.

of vtkDataObject and that worked correctly.  I have now got a set of
images calculated from different viewpoints stored in a
vtkMultiBlockDatset.  I want to process these images using plug-in
filters that are not composite dataset aware and then re-combine the
images using the viewpoint information.  The problem is that the
"vtkCompositeDataPipeline::ExecuteSimpleAlgorithmForBlock" method does a
shallow copy of the output from the plug-in and the viewpoint
information is lost.  My idea was to use a sub-class of vtkImageData and
override the ShallowCopy method to preserve the viewpoint information.
This, however, leads to the problem of how to render the sub-class in
Paraview.
	 
	Any suggestions on how to resolve these problems would be
gratefully received.

Keep this in mind if you answer this message. This would probably
require changing the ParaView code in a few places. I suspect that we
have things like 

	if (classname == "vtkImageData")

	all over the place. However, there may be a better solution. Can
you explain what additional information you are storing in this
subclass?

		Hi,
		 
		I have written a sub-class of vtkImageData that holds
additional information for processing the data further down the
pipeline.  When a filter outputs my sub-class, Paraview gives the
message "Cannot show the data in the current view although the view
reported that it can show the data."
		 
		How do I tell Paraview that it should render my
sub-class in the same way as a vtkImageData object.

I get the following error when calling "from libvtkRendering.so import
vtkMapper":

     ImportError: dynamic modules does not define init function

Can anyone see what I am doing wrong?

I'm on linux with an up-to-date development version.

Thanks in advance,
Paul

PS I'm having problems with contour lines showing through the surface.
 Commenting out the lines (199 & 200) in vtkProcessModule.cxx but this is
for a user who has an existing version...

Hello Eric,

Man... I'm really unable to express my gratitude for your help! you just
gave me what I exactly needed, the first step into XDMF. I'm really
grateful! now I can learn more by manipulating that file :-) .

Thank you again, and wish you the best.

Sincerest regards,
Samer

It should be:

from libvtkRenderingPython import vtkMapper

This should work, but if it does not then you may need to set your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directory with the .so.

For Windows it would be:

   from vtkRenderingPython import vtkMapper

Subject: [Paraview] Graphic window disappears using: pvpython sphere.py
Message-ID: <AANLkTiksqt0CnzguUo69LDIFizg96NyaZGNPBds_AAgG@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to draw 3D graphics using the pvpython shell. The following file
is named sphere.py

-----------------------
import os
import paraview
from paraview.simple import *
from paraview.servermanager import *
Connect()
sph=Sphere()
Show(sph)
Render()
-------------------

I execute the following command from a DOS cmd window:

pvpython sphere.py

These commands appear to work and a window is created showing the sphere but
it immediately goes away. Do I need some type of wait command in the script?
When I execute these commands interactively in the pvpython window the
window locks up. When I execute them, minus the Connect() in the Paraview
GUI provided Python window they work fine.

I want a separate graphics window with no GUI shown.

What am I missing here?

Unfortunately, pvpython does not support render window interaction.  But you
can make it work with a extra scripting:

from paraview.simple import *

# Create a view
view = CreateRenderView()

# Initialize a new interactor
from libvtkRenderingPython import *
iren = vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
iren.SetInteractorStyle(vtkInteractorStyleTrackball())
iren.SetRenderWindow(view.GetRenderWindow())
iren.Initialize()

# Build pipeline
Sphere()
Show()
Render()

# Start interaction
iren.Start()


In interactive pvpython, you can go to the window and hit 'q' to give focus
back to the command line, then call iren.Start() again to give focus back to
the window.

A few more notes-

If you use the script I just posted, make sure the interactor is initialized
before the first call to render- it must be initialized before the opengl
window is created.

In the current version of paraview, it is not necessary to call Connect(),
this is done automatically when paraview.simple is imported.

It's not a good idea to include the line:  'from paraview.servermanager
import *'.  You should just access servermanager methods via the sermanager
namespace that is created when you import paraview.simple *.

Subject: [Paraview] Open a bit image with Paraview
Message-ID: <5bec7b452beba1d3d8e73eed1bf8e226.squirrel@www.ica1.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hello guys,

I have a binary image that consists of bits, every bit indicates to a
pixel (or voxel) in my 3D image. The file is nothing special, it's simply
a contiguous file format I write as an output in a C++ program, I mean
it's not HDF or something common.
Is it possible to view this image in Paraview without being converted to
byte for every pixel? I mean is there a way that I could write an XML or
XDMF script that tells paraview how to view it?
I succeeded in viewing the image, but after converting every bit to a
byte, which means that the image is now 8 times bigger in size! this is
not effective at all I guess.

I would appreciate an example very much.

Thank you

Regards,
Samer
