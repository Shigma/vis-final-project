Subject: [Paraview] PV2.6 Crashes
Message-ID: <b02264720702010727k2fd2e361pbc8a77ffc2225bf7@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using the released PV2.6 and seeing some strange crashes.

I'm using the Windows Version you guys compiled for the pvclient, and
running the PVServer on a linux Cluster.  I compiled the server myself with
OSMesa (6.4.2) & MPI (OpenMPI 1.1.1-1)support, and i'm running it on
multiple processors (the number doesn't matter).  When I compiled it, I
seeded CMake with the following cache:

Problem #1:
If I load an ImageData dataset (VTI) and then attempt to use the Clip filter
on it, it crashes every time.  Also, I get no ghost cells so when I extract
an isosurface the process boundaries are clearly visible.  I place the Clip
Filter at roughly 45-degrees (eyeballed, not much precision) so that it
gives me the lower-left half of the data, and when it crashes I get a trace
like the following:

*** End of error message ***

If I load the same ImageData Dataset & apply the D3 filter, then attempt to
use the Clip filter, it works.  I have alot of rendering artifacts (I think
due to the Structured->Unstructured conversion) and it takes ALOT of memory,
but it works.

Problem #2:
I find myself having to toggle the "Immediate Mode" option after pretty much
every filter to maintain performance.  It seems to be dropping back to
slower (safer?) methods every time I make a significant rendering change,
and if I simply toggle the Immediate Mode  On & then back off, my
performance improves 10-fold.  Anyone else experiencing this?

thanks Kent for the hint. I was able to finish the compilation and have
been testing happily with our 4-cpu Woodcrest nodes.
using mpich2-1.0.5 compiled with Intel9.1 compilers.

First of all, that's a warning, not an error.  It should not be
preventing HDF from compiling.  Unless you are an HDF developer or the
HDF library is giving you runtime problems, I would ignore it.

Now here is the explanation.  The warning is telling you that the
expression 
"INTERNAL ERROR" && 0 always evaluates to 0.  This is often indicative
of a bug, since if the programmer wanted to use 0, he or she would
usually just type 0.  Instead, the programmer may have made a mistake in
typing in the expression.

In this case, the actual code is correct.  The programmer is clearly
forcing assert to abort the program by passing an expression that
evaluates to 0.  However, assert is a special case macro that also
captures the format of the expression before evaluation and report that
before aborting the program.  The programmer wants to have assert report
"INTERNAL ERROR" rather than just 0.

*** End of error message *** 


If I load the same ImageData Dataset & apply the D3 filter, then attempt
to use the Clip filter, it works.  I have alot of rendering artifacts (I
think due to the Structured->Unstructured conversion) and it takes ALOT
of memory, but it works. 

Problem #2:
I find myself having to toggle the "Immediate Mode" option after pretty
much every filter to maintain performance.  It seems to be dropping back
to slower (safer?) methods every time I make a significant rendering
change, and if I simply toggle the Immediate Mode  On & then back off,
my performance improves 10-fold.  Anyone else experiencing this?

Message-ID: <0MKp2t-1HClZM2ynG-0007HA@mrelay.perfora.net>

Hello,

 

I heard back from Trolltech today about Qt.  I told them that since I was
building a commercial, in-house application that I didn't need to get the
commercial version of Qt.  Anne (see below) disagreed with me.  She said
that in-house, or out of house doesn't matter.  It is whether or not we
would post the source to our changes back to the open source community.

 

Can someone please clarify the implications of GPL?  If I extend Paraview to
invoke our commercial applications via a custom .dll, I could make Paraview
extensions available, but I wouldn't make the custom .dll available.  Is
this complying with GPL?  We wouldn't be reselling the SW - only using it
in-house.

 

We will be adding enhancements to itkSnap and Paraview at least, if not vtk
and itk.  And we would be able to post those to the open source community as
long as we can have some custom .dlls which we don't share.

 

Do I understand this correctly?  If we did want to sell an app that depends
on vtk .dlls, other than keeping the copy left in place, am I free to do
this?

 

- Bonnie

Hi Bonnie,

 

It was nice speaking with you earlier today.  Thank you for taking my call.

 

 

As I was mentioning, Trolltech offers dual licensing model for Qt. Depending
on type of application that you're building, you need either open source
license or commercial one. 

 

You can get detailed licensing info on our web site, here
http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/licenses/licensing/licensingoverview

 

To sum up, as a rule of a thumb:

 

a)       If you call into Qt's API - you need a license. 

b)       If you want to use Qt Open Source Edition, you must comply with
GPL, which among other things, states that you must contribute all your
source code to the open source community.

c)       If you are building proprietary software - you need to start
development with Qt commercial license. You can't start developing
proprietary software using Qt Open Source license. 

 

It would help if you can provide me with more details about your project and
how exactly you're using Qt and Paraview. Based on what you told me so far,
it sounds like you guys do need Qt commercial license.

 

 

And, finally, our pricing info can be found here
http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/licenses/pricing 

 

Since you are saying you will only need Qt for GUI part, you need Qt Desktop
Light Edition.  1 license with 1 platform support is $1,990.

 

 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and also let me
know how wee proceed. 

 

P.S. Also, as an FYI - you might want to check with Paraview to see whether
you can build proprietary software using Paraview's application. 

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Anne Tsirfa,

Hi Bonnie,

although I'm no lawyer, I had to deal with a similar problem some years ago. Don't take this too seriously, this is only my point of view based on my experience with similar issues. I definitely suggest to ask some GPL guru on this for a final statement.

Anne it absolutely right in stating that you have to publish your code under a GPL license when using the open source license of Qt. But be also aware of the fact that you only need to share the source code when distributing your binaries. Since you're developing an in-house project, you're not sharing your binary versions, which in turn means that you don't have to publish your source code in the open.

> It is whether or not we would post the source to our changes back to the open source community.

In fact, this is not what the GPL states. It only states that you have to distribute your source code along with your binary version. 

> Can someone please clarify theimplications of GPL?  If I extend Paraview to invoke our commercial applications via a custom .dll, I could make Paraview extensions available, butI wouldn?t make the custom .dll available.  Is this complying withGPL?  We wouldn?t be reselling the SW ? only using it in-house.

This is not complying with the GPL.  As soon as you make paraview dependent on your in-house modules, you need to share these. The only way to prevent this is to implement loose coupling, e.g. making a GPLed plugin interface for paraview which you could use in-house for your own plugins that you won't distribute. Using dynamic linking is not enough.

> We will be adding enhancements to itkSnapand Paraview at least, if not vtk and itk.  And we would be able to postthose to the open source community as long as we can have some custom .dllswhich we don?t share.

I cannot see what this has to do with the actual problem. Are those additions to itkSNAP and Paraview equivalent to your own in-house modules? Are these used by your in-house modules?

> Do I understand this correctly?  Ifwe did want to sell an app that depends on vtk .dlls, other than keeping thecopy left in place, am I free to do this?

Yes, VTK, like ITK, is licensed under a BSD-Style license which does not restrict any commercial and/or close-source distribution of your application.

Hi Paraviewers!

I'm implementing a filter as a plugin and would like to make the VECTOR

always empty (also if data should be available).

Did I get something wrong? Thanks very much for your help!

Hi Patrick,

In the GUI XML for your filter, does the InputMenu menu XML tag have an 
id entry in it where id="im"? For example, see the bolded section in the 
below XML code.

<InputMenu trace_name="Input" property="Input"
           *id="im"*
           label="Input"
           help="Set the input to this filter."
           input_name="Input"/>

The InputMenu and the ArrayMenu have to be linked together like this for 
the VectorMenu to know where to get its list of vectors from.

As they like to say at Groklaw, IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer), but the GPL 
does allow in-house modification of source code without releasing to the 
public.  This question is explicitly answered on the GPL FAQ, at:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic

I'll paste it here for convenience:
---------------------------------------------------------
Does the GPL require that source code of modified versions be posted to 
the public?

     The GPL does not require you to release your modified version. You 
are free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever 
releasing them. This applies to organizations (including companies), 
too; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally 
without ever releasing it outside the organization.

     But if you release the modified version to the public in some way, 
the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the 
program's users, under the GPL.

     Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in 
certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to 
release it is up to you.

Also, you can and should find the appropriate clause within the GPL 
itself.  I don't recall exactly where, but it is in there.

When you say "extend ParaView" it isn't clear to me whether you plan on 
writing code that uses Qt or not.
Do you mean some dlls will not use Qt, and your custom one will?

Does anyone have experience connecting Paraview to a live data feed?  The

every so often.  In lieu of file i/o, I was wondering about a socket
connection perhaps and wondering if there's a straightforward way in
Paraview to do this.

Hi Folks,

I would like to bring some clarification to the ParaView 3 licensing. First
of all, ALL of ParaView 3 is released under  BSD-style licenses.

However, some of the components of ParaView 3 depend on Qt. Qt is released
under a collection of licenses:
http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/licenses/licensing. The developers of
ParaView 3 all have the commercial Qt license. To be able to keep the
BSD-style license of ParaView 3, developers cannot contribute (major) code
developed using the GPL'ed version of Qt TO THE GUI COMPONENTS of ParaView.
This is explained in more detail here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_and_Qt_licensing. I want to stress
that the restriction above is only limited to a portion of ParaView. Read on
for more information.

ParaView 3 has several components.  The following list includes the
directories these components are in. The ones marked with a * depend on Qt,
others do not.

- VTK (ParaView3/VTK)
- VTK extensions (ParaView3/Servers/Filters)
- Server manager (ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager)
- Python support
- Utilities (ParaView3/Utilities)
* Qt extensions* (ParaView3/Qt)
* Applications* (ParaView3/Applications)
(Everything not listed above do _not_ depend on Qt.)

You can develop code that depends on everything but those marked with a *
without worrying about Qt licensing issues. This means that you can develop
code that uses VTK, the Server Manager and the Python engine without
depending on Qt. Furthermore, once we release it, the plugin architecture
will allow you to develop VTK plugins. The user interface for those plugins
will be automatically generated. Therefore, the only time you have to worry
about Qt licensing issues is when you want to write truly customized user
interface components or build a new Qt-based application. In those
situations, follow the guidelines listed here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_and_Qt_licensing

If you choose to use the GPL'ed version of Qt to do GUI development, make
sure that you carefully read the GPL license:
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html. There are also some very useful
messages in this thread.

If you are developing new VTK algorithms, you do not have to worry about any
of this.

If you are developing a combination of the two, I recommend clearly
separating the GUI components from the VTK components.

I hope this helps.

Hello Randy,

We are working on the facility to allow ParaView's server to receive
data updates and notify the user interface about these updates.

Currently this is in early stages of development, but your input would
be appreciated. If you want to direct the development, please add your
content to the following Wiki page:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_Live_Data

Thank you.

Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 2.4.4 Clean Build crashing on Cut Filter
Message-ID: <F791129B5217E1419339F7BAEAAB4E17A93DE4@denver>

Environment: XP SP2, CMake 2.4.3, VS 2005 Pro. Paraview Source 2.4.4
 
I am trying to build Paraview 2.4.4 from source and after everything compiles I am getting multiple errors when I launch paraview.exe.
The first error is:
 File: C:\Applications\VS2005\VC\include\algorithm
 Line: 4093
Expression: sequence not ordered
 
So I click Ignore a bunch of times... 
 
The GUI eventually shows up. I create a "Sphere Source" and then attempt to apply a "Cut" filter to it and I get the following:
 
File: C:\Applications\VS2005\VC\include\vector
Line: 756
Expression: vector subscript out of range
 
Now I guess I could post the stack trace but in instead here is what I have done to attempt to remedy this:
   I installed the service pack 1 for VS 2005
   I moved aside all the MSYS/MinGW other stuff that I had installed thinking maybe the compiler was getting something out of the MinGW include directory instead of the VS/include directory. 
   Restarted a half-a-dozen times. 
   Cleaned and rebuilt paraview from fresh source a few times. Each time the errors are not going away. I know ParaView is supposed to build clean from source, especially on windows so I figure either something is messed up in my environment or something else. 
 
Could some kind windows guy help me out? Has anyone ever seen this? Do I have to clean my system again and reinstall everything?
 
Thanks for any help

PS.. I might try PV 2.6 if I can free up enough space on my drive.

Berk, Sean, and Hendrik, thanks for the answers!

It sounds like the plug-in interface is exactly what I would want for our application.  We make custom surgical guides for total knee replacement surgery by processing MRI data.  These guides would only be made inhouse, and I want to use a slightly customized Paraview for viewing results.  So for us the GUI part is a small part.  

Do you have any idea when that will that be ready in Paraview III?

Clint,

I was envisioning a customized Paraview that depended on a proprietary .dll.  And as Hendrick pointed out, that would violate GPL.  So I think the plugins are really what we want.

Hi all,

I just wanted you to inform, that I found the problem: I had a syntax
error in the xml file that was not reported by ParaView.
Instead of:
class="vtkPointSet"/>
I had written:
class="vtkPointSet">

took me some hours to find out :D

thx again, and may this help some other people.

Hi,

 I don't know CMake but I think there is a small bug is the 
CMakeList.txt of Paraview (cvs' version). If I try to run 
ccmake in the source directory I have an error message which 
ask my to try again in another directory. If I do so I still
receive the same message because a CMakeCache.txt file still
exists in the source directory. I expected to solve the 
poblem this way, but no :

I have been using ParaView 2.6 and 2.9 on Linux, OS X and Window XP without
any serious stability problems. Does it crash at startup or when you are
doing anything specific?

Both 2.6 and 2.9 crash after some short activity. 2.9 unpredictably
(would open some files), 2.6 on most of my VTK files 2.4 opens without
problems. Where should I look?

The first thing to do would be to try to find a reproducible case when it
crashes. If that doesn't work, try running a debug build in a debugger
trying to get a stack trace. I will run in valgrind to see if I can catch
anything.

It crashes on all my files so it's pretty reproducible. I tried running
it under gdb but seems PV was not compiled with -g:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xb3ce71f2 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0xb3ce71f2 in ?? ()
#1  0xb5bf6d1c in ?? ()
#2  0x0809cb60 in ?? ()
#3  0x00000000 in ?? ()

I don't want to compile 2.6 due to GUI compilaiton problems. I will try
to build 2.9 in debug version and post the gdb results.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkDEMReader - DEM files rendered in 2D in Paraview
Message-ID: <b3d71aa40702061500yccf1e11pda8bce71f1092ff3@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to view DEM(Digital Elevation Model) files in Paraview 2.6. but
it is being rendered as 2D and the elevation is being represented as color
on the plane surface. So basically the  z-coordinate is being used to map it
by color. I looked over the code for quite some time but was unable to
pinpoint where exactly the class vtkDEMReader was reading the z-coord from
the data file.

I would like to be able to render a DEM file in 3D. Any help on how the
reader works will be appreciated. Has anyone ever tried modifying the class
this way?

Thanks,

Bikash

I am not familiar with DEM files, but I am pretty sure that the file is
being read in as a 2D image, which is probably the right thing to do, and 2D
images are represented in ParaView as flat, colored planes, which is also
the right thing to do.  Reading this 2.5D data as 3D polygons would ruin
your ability to perform many filtering operations that might be useful.

You can reconstruct the 3D features by applying a couple of filters to your
data.  First, apply the ?Extract Surface? filter to convert the image to
polygons that can be freely manipulated in 3-space.  The run the result
through the ?Warp (scalar)? filter.  You will probably have to play with the
?Scale factor? option to get the height to look as you expect.

I have compiled PV 2.9 alpha with -g (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE debug) which I
confirmed by make VERBOSE=1. I run PV in gdb, it crashes on a file load,
with NO stack:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
Cannot remove breakpoints because program is no longer writable.
It might be running in another process.
Further execution is probably impossible.
0xb1d511f0 in ?? ()

(gdb) bt
#0  0xb1d511f0 in ?? ()
#1  0xb4c2ad1c in ?? ()
#2  0x08095048 in ?? ()
#3  0x00000000 in ?? ()

My guess is I should use debug versions of QT and VTK too, but I didnt
see such configure options..?

Thanks a million Ken! Works great. I have been breaking my head for quite
some time trying to read it as 3D polygons.

Message-ID: <64AE34BF-E5D4-4DF4-9FE2-D12F69CB3469@imts.us>

I was trying to recompile my ParaView modules and I get the error:

/Users/mjackson/Task_4/Workspace/PVDislocation/ 
vtkPrdsDislocationReader.cpp:80: error: 'UPDATE_TIME_INDEX' is not a  
member of 'vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline'

The offending line is:
   outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_INDEX 
(), this->GetTimeStep() );

This used to work in ParaView 2.4.4 and I vaguely remember that time  
support was being changed in PV 2.6. Could someone explain what I  
should be using now?

I have written a custom ParaView reader module for our file format. I  
need Time Support and I was successfully using this code in PV 2.4.

Thanks

The VTK Wiki has some notes on this:
	http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Time_Support#Design
It's a good overview of the changes, but not a detailed programming
guide.

Mike, The time handling has changed a bit recently. TIME_INDEX is no 
longer supported (partly because you may have 100 time steps of data 
with step number 34 missing, if step 35 is requested, do they want the 
35th of the data you actually have, or the 35th of the data you would 
have if the steps were all present). Instead, use a time value which is 
real and represents the actual time.(this also allows source which can 
produce a continuum of time values to be accessed)

To get things right, try this

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In RequestInformation, make sure you export the steps you can produce 
(often just 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.....etc)

  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),
               &this->TimeStepValues[0], this->TimeStepValues.size());

    where you may have std::vector<double> TimeStepValues - with the 
values pushed back when the file is opened

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In RequestData, check to see which time step was requested, this usually 
will be set in the GUI via SetTimeStep, but might be passed into the 
filter from downstream, if another filter is requesting data from a 
particular step

  this->ActualTimeStep = this->TimeStep; // set by the gui, but we will 
override this if the pipeline requested another

  if (outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS()))
    {
    double requestedTimeValue = 
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0];
    // this is overkill, I use it to ensure that if a time value which 
is slightly out is requested
    // then the correct one is fetched
    this->ActualTimeStep = vtkstd::find_if(
      this->TimeStepValues.begin(),
      this->TimeStepValues.end(),
      vtkstd::bind2nd( WithinTolerance( ), requestedTimeValue ))
      - this->TimeStepValues.begin();
    this->ActualTimeStep = this->ActualTimeStep + this->TimeStepRange[0];
    doOutput->GetInformation()->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS(), 
&requestedTimeValue, 1);
    CSCSOutputMacro(<<"Got a timestep request from downstream t= " << 
requestedTimeValue << " Step : " << this->ActualTimeStep);
    }
  else
    {
    double timevalue[1];
    timevalue[0] = 
this->TimeStepValues[this->ActualTimeStep-this->TimeStepRange[0]];
    CSCSOutputMacro(<<"Using manually set t= " << timevalue[0] << " Step 
: " << this->ActualTimeStep);
    doOutput->GetInformation()->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS(), 
&timevalue[0], 1);
    }

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
note that

class WithinTolerance: public std::binary_function<double, double, bool>
{
public:
    result_type operator()(first_argument_type a, second_argument_type 
b) const
    {
      bool result = (fabs(a-b)<=(a*1E-6));
      return (result_type)result;
    }
};

if you want to see a filter that uses the above code and works well, 
look here
https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/vtkOpenDX/
for my openDX reader which is the most simple one I've made that uses 
the above code.

There should be some sort of stack even if Qt and VTK are not compiled with
debug. However, I am confused, how can paraview be compiled debug and VTK
not?
I am guessing whatever is causing the crash is corrupting the stack also.
Can you try to run in valgrind? I believe valgrind is a debian package also
so getting it should be easy. Once you get it, simply run valgrind

Subject: [Paraview] python in Paraview III
Message-ID: <20070207150633.GS9510@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

 I compile the last version of Paraview III with Python shell.
I run the Python shell here is what I did and get :

Python 2.4.4c1 (#1, Oct 11 2006, 21:48:21) 
[GCC 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-13ubuntu5)] on linux2
>>> import os
>>> dir(os)
>>> import paraview
>>> c=paraview.connect()
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 1, in ?
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'connect'
>>> dir(paraview)
>>> 

It seems I can load paraview but it does nothing.

Can someone explain me my mistake ?

Olivier.

Yet another typo in my reply. :)
"paraview.Connect()" instead of "paraview.Connect" or "paraview.connect()"

I fixed problem #1 below. It will be in the next patch. If you are building
your own binaries, the fix is in the CVS 2.6 branch. I did not experience
problem #2. I will try to reproduce it today. Did anyone run into a similar
problem?

Hi,

I'm seeing the same problem.  However, if I install paraview-2.4.4  
using fink (paraview.2.4.4-1001) I don't see this bug.  FWIW, my  
default gcc version is:

i686-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build  
5367)

Thanks for the code. I downloaded your OpenDX reader to get an idea  
of the context. I have updated my code and things seem to work now.  
The only problem that I am having is the "Time Step" slider is not  
correctly updated when I open my file, it always defaults to 0->100  
timesteps, regardless of what is in the file.

   In my client side xml I have the following:

	<Module name="PrdsDislocationReader"
           root_name="PrdsDislocationReader"
           output="vtkUnstructuredGrid"
           module_type="Reader"
           extensions=".dat .disl"
           file_description="Paradis Dislocation Data">

     <Source class="vtkPrdsDislocationReader"/>

     <Scale property="TimeStep"
            label="Time step"
            trace_name="TimeStep"
            keeps_timesteps="1"
            help="Set the current timestep."/>
	</Module>

and in my server manager file I have:

	<SourceProxy name="PrdsDislocationReader"  
class="vtkPrdsDislocationReader">
      <StringVectorProperty
         name="FileName"
         command="SetFileName"
         number_of_elements="1">
         <StringListDomain name="files"/>
      </StringVectorProperty>

      <IntVectorProperty
         name="TimeStep"
         command="SetTimeStep"
         number_of_elements="1"
         animateable="1"
         default_values="0"
         information_property="TimestepValues">

        <IntRangeDomain name="range">
           <RequiredProperties>
              <Property name="TimeStepRangeInfo" function="Range"/>
           </RequiredProperties>
        </IntRangeDomain>
      </IntVectorProperty>

      <IntVectorProperty
         name="TimeStepRangeInfo"
         command="GetTimeStepRange"
         information_only="1">
         <SimpleIntInformationHelper/>
      </IntVectorProperty>



      <DoubleVectorProperty
         name="TimestepValues"
         information_only="1">
         <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>
    <!-- End ParadisReader -->
    </SourceProxy>

I have tried to mimic the ExodusReader code where I can but nothing  
seems to work. Does anyone have any ideas what I need to set/over- 
ride or implement? Maybe something from the superclass  
(vtkPolyDataAlgorithm) maybe?

Thanks for any help

I cannot reproduce this. I tried the binaries on multiple GNU/Linux boxes
(Debian, Red Hat 32 and 64 bit) with different OpenGL drivers (Mesa and
multiple version of nVidia) and on Windows. Also, the output of valgrind
that you posted seems to point to some OpenGL driver issues.

I had this too.

I think it's because the binaries are compiled for ppc, not intel

For regular OS X apps, Rosetta kicks in to open ppc binaries, but I  
don't think that happens in X11 apps

For what it's wort, the Paraview III binaries are compiled for intel  
and they work fine

I can reproduce this. The binaries are for ppc. I will post intel binaries
as soon as I have some time.

Mike

make sure you also set

    this->TimeStepRange[0] = 0;
    this->TimeStepRange[1] = t>0 ? this->TimeStepValues.size()-1 : 0;

as the paraview gui will query GetTimeStepRange to find how many steps are there if this is missing, then the number of steps will be wrong. 

Wasn't there a similar post about only seeing 100 steps recently?

thanks, it was the problem.

I have corrected these typos on the man wiki page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:pvpython

BTW, to see a value I need to use print :

>>> a=2
>>> a
>>> print a
2
>>>

This is not the usual behaviour of Python. There is
the same problem with the result of functions :

>>> import os
>>> dir(os)
>>> print dir(os)
['EX_CANTCREAT', 'EX_CONFIG', 'EX_DATAERR', 'EX_IOERR', 'EX_NOHOST',
'EX_NOINPUT', 
...
>>>

Maybe it is something wrong with me, but if not, I suggest to 
warn users about this special feature in the wiki page.

Yep,
    In RequestInformation, I am setting the values; Is that the  
proper place to set them? If I do it in RequestData then it is  
probably too late. I have the range set from 0 to 1 in the  
constructor of my class.


That post was by me.. I have never been able to fix the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] LSDynaReader interfering with my own reader
Message-ID: <9FC09C21-85EC-44BC-AC46-90DFA0CD18FD@imts.us>

I have a custom reader that reads files with an extension of ".disl".  
I have my own reader for these files which worked fine under PV  
2.4.4. I am now updating for PV 2.6 and when I run ParaView and  
select my file for reading I get the following dumped to the console.

ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: /Users/Shared/ 
OpenSource/ParaView-2.6.0/VTK/Hybrid/vtkLSDynaReader.cxx (2473)

Then my reader kicks in and reads the file just fine. I looked for  
the obvious that the LSDynaReader was also using the ".disl"  
extension but from what I can tell it is not. Anyone have any ideas  
on this?

I have renamed the dri kernel module and PV 2.9 works, only unusably
slow. So the error is in combination PV-dri. The problem is not there
with version 2.4 nor with the latest VTK.

Also note that the GL error about the missing config file is always with
me, also with PV 2.4, and never did any harm. Is also there with my
usual VTK GL applications.

Subject: [Paraview] UPDATE_TIME_INDEX not part of Paraview 2.6

Are the time steps set to 100 at some point before they get set to the 
correct number?  I've seen problems in the vtkCSCSNetCDF reader for PV 
2.4.4 (haven't tried it with other readers or versions yet) such that 
when the timesteps are set once, they can't be changed later.

For example, in vtkCSCSNetCDF, if it originally detects a single file 
with one time step and you add the wildcards to locate more files with 
additional time steps, I can't make it change it from 1 time step. 
However, if I modify the reader to notice the other files initially and 
set the correct number of time steps the first time, that works fine.

Since the above work-around has gotten me by, I haven't mentioned it 
until now.  Also, I thought it may not be an issue in 2.6.  Am I (we) 
doing something wrong, or is this a bug?

The odd part is if I click the "Play" button to animate through the  
timesteps then the slider gets updated to the proper number of  
timesteps.

So for example I have a data file with 77 timesteps. If I open the  
file in paraview, the timestep slider will be set to 0 with a max of  
100 enabling me to select timesteps that are beyond what is in the  
file. Now if I click the "play" button, then the max value of the  
Time Step slider is set to 77. Odd.

Not sure this is a bug but more of "I am just missing something" as  
the timestep thing seems to work for the Exodus reader..

The messages should not be output... they are coming from
LSDyna's CanReadFile() method. I thought I had disabled
them but I'll look into it again. If it is reading your
file, then LSDyna's CanReadFile is returning the correct
value.

The problem is that LSDyna's output files don't have an
extension (they are named d3plot, d3plot01, ...) and
ParaView requires either a matching extension or (if you
put always_try_can_read="1" in the Module tag of the GUI
XML file) for CanReadFile to return true.

I have a custom reader that reads files with an extension of ".disl".  
I have my own reader for these files which worked fine under PV

Then my reader kicks in and reads the file just fine. I looked for

on this?

Subject: [Paraview] Deformation Field Scaling
Message-ID: <e4fafd990702071234sc667250hff196c70fd1368e0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Does the isosurface generation generate in an absolute, 1:1 scale according
to the data?  And does the glyph generator generate deformation fields in an
absolute, 1:1 scale according to the data given?

The deformation fields I get for the deformations of an image don't seem to
match up to the geometry of the image, even when the scale factor of the
glyph generation is set to 1.  That is to say, I expect the glyphs/arrows at
any particular point to extend exactly from the before deformation image to
the corresponding point on the after deformation image (e.g glyph should
span exactly between a corner of a box and the corresponding corner on the
box after a deformation, and not be longer or shorter than that).  The data
given to the glyph generator, resulting from an image registration algorithm
in ITK, is correct, and has been tested to have minimal error.

Or does glyph generation not work this way?


Thank you,
Kevin

So,
    basically there is a bug where the LSDyna is outputting when it  
shouldn't.

Also this kinda sucks because say I am reading lots and lots of  
files, I have to deal with the overhead of failed read attempts by  
the LSDynaReader for every file? That seems like a problem to me.

Is it possible to add extensions to the LSDyna Files?

No, but as I said in my previous message, I will make sure
that CanReadFile doesn't print any error messages.
The proper way to avoid CanReadFile being called on
a large number of files is to have your reader placed
at the top of the list of all readers, rather than the
bottom. That seems like the proper behavior anyway, allowing
people to override the default set of readers shipped with
ParaView even where filename extensions conflict.

You're missing one thing I think
  <Module name="MySuperDooperReader"
          class="vtkPVAdvancedReaderModule"
adding the class="vtkPVAdvancedReaderModule" tells paraview to display 
the information before calling read data - this is usually used to allow 
you to select scalars before loading the first time step - in our case 
it forces an extra round of ExecuteInformation which should reset your 
time scroller (fingers crossed)

JB - apologies if you already did this, I just skimmed through your XML

Message-ID: <F791129B5217E1419339F7BAEAAB4E17A93DE6@denver>

I am trying to build ParaView 2.6 with Visual Studio 2003.Net and while everything builds just fine, the "Install" target does not do anything. Typically this used to copy all the needed files into the install location that was entered in the CmakeSetup program. Now nothing..

Anyone ever seen this? am I doing something wrong? 
 
Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Confused of offscreen rendering, mangled mesa, 
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702081602100.13855@hal>

Hi paraview/VTK experts,

I was working on building/running Paraview on a cluster without graphics 
card a while ago, and now I want to resume the unfinished task...

I have some questions related to the above-mentioned task:

(1) Mesa is a pure software implementation of OpenGL standard. Is Mesa the 
only choice for offscreen rendering?

(2) If I want to build and run Paraview on a computing cluster, any node 
of which doesn't have graphics card installed, do I have to build Paraview 
with mangled Mesa? If the cluster doesn't have any other OpenGL lib 
installed, then do I have to "mangle" Mesa?

(3) If I build Paraview with mangled Mesa, can I see rendering from 
Paraview or is it offscreen exclusive?

Thank you in advance.

Weiguang

Hi Weiguang,

Please see the following thread from the vtkusers list: 
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtkusers/2007-January/088857.html. 
Part of the discussion also appeared on the ParaView and vtk-developers 
lists.

If the only version of GL on your cluster is Mesa, then you can set your 
OpenGL-related CMake variables to point to the appropriate counterpart 
in Mesa. The reason you'd want to use mangled Mesa is if from the same 
build, sometimes you'd want to use OpenGL and other times you'd want to 
use Mesa. It doesn't sound like that's the case for you.

Yes.  Click the second toolbar button from the right.  It should be a
circular arrow with nothing inside it.  The tooltip says "Hide the
center of rotation to the center of current data set," which, now that I
read it for probably the first time, doesn't make much more sense than
the tooltip.

I must confess a bit of embarrassment at the simplicity of that.
However, I must also say that I have asked several paraview users as
well as bought and searched the manual in search of an answer before
resorting to asking the mailing list.

Yes, that is the center-of-rotation crosshair. There are 4 buttons on 
the right side of the 2.4.4 toolbar that manages the COR including one 
that turns its display off. If you don't see these buttons turn on 
Window->Toolbars->Camera. This might have changed in the beta versions 
of ParaView III. It always helps to mention the version in use when one 
posts a question.

I finally have all my new modules compiling and running under Windows XP. How do I go about creating a distribution package for Paraview? I am building PV 2.6 currently with Visual Studio 2003 .Net
 
The "install" project in the Paraview.sln file doesn't seem to do anything so I assume that there is another way.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug in Paraview 2.6 VS2003 Generation
Message-ID: <F791129B5217E1419339F7BAEAAB4E17A93DE8@denver>

I think there is a bug in the PV 2.6 CmakeLists. Let me explain. I am using VS 2003 .Net and the project file (.sln) generated for PV 2.6 does not complete when you build the "install" project. Nothing is ever copied into the install location.
   just for a sanity check, I rebuilt PV 2.4.4 from a clean source tree with a from scratch VS2003 solution file generated from CMakeSetup. I then built the "install" target and this completed successfully by copying all the installation files into the designated installation location (C:\Program Files\ParaView).
 
 has anyone else seen this and/or could some one verify this? Or is this already known and fixed in CVS?
 
Thanks for any Help

The functionality is covered in the ParaView book (v. 2.4, page 61 near 
the bottom of the page), but you would probably have to know the 
crosshairs are called "center of rotation" to find it.

Subject: [Paraview] Render Window Missing - Paraview 2.4
Message-ID: <b3d71aa40702090659u25d31090l4d7ac0519252f3dd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I just downloaded the paraview 2.4 source from the website and built it on a
Linux machine. When I run Paraview now, I dont see the render window -
neither a separate render window nor the normal integrated one.

I have 2.6 on the machine and it works fine.

Has anyone else come across something like this? All functions, filters work
fine. Just that I cant see anything.


thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel anomoly
Message-ID: <45CCA1E0.1040101@inl.gov>

Hi,

I have built ParaView 2.4.4 enabling mpi and offscreen rendering to be 
used on some of our servers.  I am seeing some an anomoly in the command 
line of the resulting processes when I do a ps. 

I initially start pvclient -rc.  I then runn pvserver with the following 
command line:
    mpirun -np 2 /home/galbja/paraview-2.4.4-bin/bin/pvserver -rc 
--use-offscreen-rendering

Everything connects and the GUI comes up.  But when I do a ps on the 
server, here is what I see (cleaned out a bit so it is readable):
10535 19740  1 09:20 pts/2    00:00:00 /bin/sh mpirun -np 2 
paraview-2.4.4-bin/bin/pvserver -rc --use-offscreen-rendering

paraview-2.4.4-bin/bin/pvserver-real smclinux 14663   4amslave 
-p4yourname smclinux -p4rmrank 1

My question is this.  On the last two lines, the "-p4amslave" argments 
have been changed to "4amslave" somewhere along the line.

When I open a file and accept it, the head node appears to be doing most 
if not all the work.  The "slave" process isn't doing squat.  It renders 
but it appears to be that the parallel capabilities aren't being used. 

Where have I gone awry?  This is happening on our cluster, and on a 
dual-quadcore machine.  When I run on our smp machine, everything is 
fine - but it is using a different (SGI) mpi implementation.  Everything 
else is using mpich.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Jim

Can you try a sample mpi program? I think mpich comes with cpi. The fact
that ssh is escaping the arguments looks strange.

Weird. I used mpich 1.2 in the past and never saw this. I recommend trying
mpich2 configured with mpd. Since that doesn't use ssh for connection, you
won't see this problem. I believe mpich1 can also be configured to use mpd.

I meant 2.4.4. Sorry about that. I am running FC6 and tried "ldd ./paraview"
with the results below:

linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0x00cf3000)

I dont think it is connecting to shared objects from 2.6. I built 2.4.4 with
some of my custom filters and classes which work fine in 2.6. I also
downloaded the binaries from the website to see if there was a compile
problem but same result.

I had 2.6 running with a separate render window using the
PV_SEPARATE_RENDER_WINDOW variable. I set that to zero to try and solve the
issue but same result again.

Hi,

I was wondering how I could get rid of the separate render window in PV2.6.
I tried setting the environment variable PV_SEPARATE_RENDER_WINDOW=0 but
still get the detached render window.

Im running paraview on a fedora core 6.

Thanks

"unset" the variable. ParaView merely checks for the existance of that 
variable and not it's value.
use:
unset PV_SEPARATE_RENDER_WINDOW

Problem Fixed. The issue was paraview 2.4.4 not being able to render a
separate window. "unset" the PV_SEPARATE_RENDER_WINDOW and it works.

I don't know if this will help. I'm working with 2.4.4 on a Redhat 
Enterprise SMP system.

I'm using mpich 1.2.7p1, the ch_p4 "device", and ssh instead of rsh. 
This device generates some extra processes for communication (they show 
up as using 0 CPU time) so one sees at least twice as many processes as 
expected.

I am using an almost trival bash script, server.job, that does a few 
things then executes

    pvserver $@ -rc --client-host=www.client.edu

The additional arguments passed to the script by mpich go in at the "$@" 
and must come first. Mpich includes a few parameters that are position 
dependent and the mpich code (linked to pvserver) can't find its 
arguments if they are not where they are expected. Using this script, 
unfortunately, will make the following a little bit harder to follow.

For this test I ran

    $ mpirun -np 2 server.job

Here is the information I get from ps. Each item includes the CPU time 
followed by the command and its arguments. There were alse a few copies 
of ssh involved that I didn't list. I've edited the text a little:

    www.server.edu is the SMP server
    www.client.edu is my workstation running the client
    "/me" is my working directory
    "/paraview" is the path to pvserver

This is the primary instance of the job run by mpirun:
0.0
/bin/bash
/me/server.job -p4pg /me/PI7282 -p4wd /home/me

This is the first instance of pvserver:
0.7
/paraview/pvserver
-p4pg /me/PI7282 -p4wd /me -rc --client-host=www.client.edu

This is probably the I/O process for the first pvserver:
0.0
/paraview/pvserver
-p4pg /me/PI7282 -p4wd /me -rc --client-host=www.client.edu

It looks like this is used to fire off the second instance:
0.0
ssh
www.server.edu -l eschenbe -n /me/server.job www.server.edu 33413
\-p4amslave \-p4yourname www.server.edu \-p4rmrank 1

The second instance first runs my default shell, tcsh:
0.0
tcsh
-c /me/server.job www.server.edu 33413 \-p4amslave \-p4yourname
www.server.edu \-p4rmrank 1

This looks like the second instance of the job:
0.0
/bin/bash
/me/server.job www.server.edu 33413 -p4amslave -p4yourname
www.server.edu -p4rmrank 1

Finally, the second instance of pvserver:
0.7
/paraview/pvserver
www.server.edu 33413 4amslave -p4yourname www.server.edu
-p4rmrank 1 -rc --client-host=www.client.edu

And the communication process for the second pvserver:
0.0
/paraview/pvserver
www.server.edu 33413 4amslave -p4yourname www.server.edu
-p4rmrank 1 -rc --client-host=www.client.edu

It works fine as it is but changing MPICH to use "shmem" and skipping 
server.job might reduce the number of processes a little.

Hi Kent,

Thanks for the information.  I had no idea the command line arguments 
that mpich adds were position dependent.  Is that written down 
somewhere, hopefully somewhere outside your head??

After looking at your listings, it looks like you are having some of the 
same anomolies I was seeing.  The ssh command used to create the second 
pvserver has the following command line parameters added by mpich: 
"\-p4amslave \-p4yourname www.server.edu \-p4rmrank 1".  When you look 
at the actual command line for 33413, it shows the command line 
arguments as: "4amslave -p4yourname www.server.edu -p4rmrank 1".  For 
some reason the leading "-p" is being stripped off the -p4amslave 
argument.  Not sure if this is a problem but something I noticed.

I tried creating a startup script like the one you described.  It did 
insert the mpich arguments ahead of mine (complete with the missing -p 
ahead of the 4amslave arg):
    /home/galbja/paraview-2.4.4-bin/bin/pvserver-real smclinux 16390   
4amslave -p4yourname smclinux -p4rmrank 1 -rc --use-offscreen-rendering
but when I open a data file and accept it, it still looks like only the 
first server is doing any work.  When I run the same scenario on our 
large smp box (using SGI mpi), the four processes all take about 100% of 
their cpus for a period.  I don't see this on my cluster or dual-quad 
system using mpich.  I'm not convinced the server processes know what is 
going on and who is supposed to be doing what...

Any more ideas??  What to look at??

Thanks again for all your help

Jim

Hey folks,

I have written a very simple test VTK xml file and am reading it into  
Paraview (2.4.4). The problem is that Paraview is not reporting the  
data range correctly. Here is the file...

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="BigEndian">
<ImageData WholeExtent="0 1 0 1 0 1" Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 1">
<Piece Extent="0 1 0 1 0 1">
<PointData Scalars="material">
<DataArray type="UInt8" Name="material" format="binary">
bAQIAAwAAAAA=
</DataArray>
</PointData>
</Piece>
</ImageData>
</VTKFile>

I am writing 8 scalars [1 2 0 3 0 0 0 0], but Paraview is reporting  
unsigned chars range 0 - 12.

Any advice would be most appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Turn off Backlighting
Message-ID: <FD337DE9-3685-463E-AC63-061C69446A09@imts.us>

Is there a way to turn off back lighting in Paraview? Basically if I  
am looking at the "back" of a triangle I want it to show up black, or  
another color? Could I write a filter to do this?

Thanks

Hey folks,

I have written a very simple test VTK xml file and am reading it into  
Paraview (2.4.4). The problem is that Paraview is not reporting the  
data range correctly. Here is the file...

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="BigEndian">
<ImageData WholeExtent="0 1 0 1 0 1" Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 1">
<Piece Extent="0 1 0 1 0 1">
<PointData Scalars="material">
<DataArray type="UInt8" Name="material" format="binary">
bAQIAAwAAAAA=
</DataArray>
</PointData>
</Piece>
</ImageData>
</VTKFile>

I am writing 8 scalars [1 2 0 3 0 0 0 0], but Paraview is reporting  
unsigned chars range 0 - 12.

Any advice would be most appreciated.

Craig

Hi,
I'm using Paraview 3 HEAD branch in windows xp vc++2005sp1.
Paraview crashes, if the whole window is chosen In selection mode.
A cause is because objProxy is set to NULL in vtkSMSelectionProxy::FillSources.
Is it right that GetProxyFromPropID returns NULL?

Hi all,

As usual, a simple snapshot is better than a long description ;-)

Any suggestion ?

Subject: [Paraview] Two Sided Lighting
Message-ID: <322A71C6-D093-427C-89C2-C30DC802168D@imts.us>

If I write a "filter" for Paraview, is there a base class that I can  
derive from so that I can get access to the "vtkRenderer"? I would  
like create a "filter" to toggle two sided lighting on and off? or is  
there another way to achieve this effect?
    Basically I have a very complex surface mesh where the parts that  
intersect the bounding box are not sealed off, thus allowing one to  
"see" into the interior of the mesh. By turning off two sided  
lighting, these areas show up as black, or any other color I would  
like. I have my own simple vtk based viewer where I did this so I  
know all the plumbing is there, I just have no idea how to actually  
get to it in ParaView?
     I guess I could just modify ParaView to always have two sided  
lighting off, but I would rather have a toggle button.

THanks for any help or pointers.

There is no easy way to do what you want in ParaView.  Filters have no
access to the vtkRenderer in which they will be rendering.  There are a
number of complications implementing this, one if which is that in
general there is no guarantee that the filter object and the renderer
object are even on the same computer.

To access the TwoSidedLighting parameter in the renderer, I think you
are going to have to hack up ParaView.  The easiest way to do this is to
simply change the default for the TwoSidedLighting ivar in vtkRenderer
to 0.  Then all rendering will be one sided.  The next easiest thing is
to expose the TwoSidedLighting parameter in the Renderer proxy and add a
checkbox to the GUI to turn it on and off.  Things get much more
complicated from there.

An alternative to using filters or hacking up ParaView is to use shaders
to do what you want.  Shaders let you completely override the behavior
of the graphics card, so you can implement whatever rendering method you
want.  Furthermore, starting with ParaView 2.6 you can load in your own
shaders without any modifications to the ParaView code.  If you are
interested in using shaders, there is a short description of them in the
latest Kitware Source newsletter
(http://www.kitware.com/products/newsletter/kitware_quarterly1113.pdf)
written by Utkarsh Ayachit.  There is also some other information on the
Kitware Wiki (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VTKShaders).

There are some issues with using shaders, however.  The shaders will
only work if you are using graphics hardware or software that has
programmable architecture and the drivers allow you to access them.  If
you bought your graphics card in the last couple years, it is probably
supported.  Another issue is that writing shaders tend to be a bit
slower than using the standard pipeline, although the latest round of
graphics cards seem to have less of a problem in this area.  A pragmatic
issue is that shaders are all-or-nothing.  If you make one, you have to
write the algorithm for all the geometric and/or fragment processing.
That can be a lot of work if you just want to disable two sided
lighting.

I chose to hack up ParaView. I did the following:

vtkSMRenderModuleProxy.cxx
     In Function void vtkSMRenderModuleProxy::CreateVTKObjects(int  
numObjects)
       Just before the closing brace of the function add the following:
       this->GetRenderer()->TwoSidedLightingOff();

This basically does what I want. I would actually rather add a toggle  
button into the UI, like in the 3D view properties pane. I am using  
PV 2.6 and on OS X 10.4.8 Intel (MacBook Pro). Could you give me a  
hint on where to look to add a button? Do I modify an XML file in the  
GUI or Server sectiosn?

I left my ParaView Book at work but if I can get started when I get  
to work after all the snow falls I can probably finish up.

Thanks for the help

Subject: [Paraview] Python interface differences between ParaView 2.6 and
	ParaView III
Message-ID: <d3d4ab920702130946g5c4a65f4j8af589002ef9f03e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

recently I have tested my Python script with ParaView 3 executive. The
script has been developed with Python interface of ParaView 2.6.

So far, I have noticed several changes in the interface (from 2.6 to 2.9) :
1) I was in need to explicitly specify render interactor style (there
is no longer a default one).
2) UpdateDataInformation method is no longer part of the vtkSMSourceProxy.
3) I am getting "RenderModuleHelper not set" error from vtkSMLODDisplayProxy.

At this point I have stopped my experiments and decided to post my question.

Is now the right time to migrate to the ParaView 3?

I guess there is several more things different. So it will cost me not
negligible effort to accommodate my code to the changes. I am
concerned about the amount of modification most likely to happen in
the near future in the server manager part (and its python interface)
of ParaView 3.

Any hints will be appreciated as they will help me to plan my work better.

Thanks,
Milan

I'm not the expert, but I think the correct thing to do is add a
TwoSidedLighting property to the Renderer proxy in rendering.xml and
then expose that property in the Renderer subproxy of the
SimpleRenderModule proxy (also defined in rendering.xml).  Then you can
modify vtkPVRenderView.cxx to create an option in the GUI and pass that
to the exposed property in the render module.  Use the "Use parallel
projection" option as example.

I would wait a few months until the release of 3.0. We are likely to make
changes to the python interface.

I'm seeing "C ose" instead of "Close".  Is that normal for your desktop?
And it appears to be your own build of ParaView 3.
What version of Qt did you build with?
As for the python shell, what does this font look the same in xfontsel?

Good idea! I don't expect to have the opportunity to do that anytime 
soon; perhaps you or someone else could upgrade the mesh quality class 
and implement the Python checks in C++. One issue: large meshes make 
take a while since every vertex and triangle are compared to every other.

Hi Milan,

I am actually interested in using python together with paraview too;
unfortunately I was not able to run any small python example until
now (by the way, the only example I found was the small example for
version III on the wiki).I looks like that I have to compile
paraview for using python; at least I could not find it in the
latest snapshot an in  2.6. Do you have any hints about using python
together with paraview? Maybe, you got some small understandable
examples?
Would be nice!
Fabian

Hi Fabian,

you are right, you have to switch on the ParaView embed Python
support. It is the PARAVIEW_WRAP_PYTHON cmake constant (in PV 2.6).
Then it is necessary to use the pvpython.exe as the python
interpreter. The wiki example should work ;-)

Good luck!
Milan.

Do data arrays for inline binary data have to start with a 'b' char  
before the actual data. I'm still having trouble getting anything  
apart from ascii data to work correctly with Paraview!

Subject: [Paraview] PV3 build on freebsd box...
Message-ID: <45D46F50.3030705@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to build ParaView3 (2.9.8) on my freebsd box.
(Clinton said to me that it was ready to download).

I have successfully built Qt 4.2.2 and cmake 2.4.6.

(I failed to build PV3 on my debian box, because, from what Clinton 
says, it has only Qt 4.2.1 (and cmake 2.4.4)).

But when I run cmake to configure PV3, it complains about something 
missing related to Qt4 and X11
if I understand right:

 QT_X11_QMAKESPEC_LIBRARY         
QT_X11_QMAKESPEC_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND

QT_X11_so_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND                                      
 
What does it mean ?

In fact, the QT_X11_* look very strange to me (not, been, has ???), no ?

What's wrong ?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Looks like the Qt installation isn't correct.
So qmake is returning the error "QMAKESPEC has not been set, so 
configuration cannot be deduced" when CMake asks qmake which X11 
libraries Qt depends on.

The inline binary data are pure base64 encoded with no special prefix. 
However there are more values stored than just the raw scalar data.  You 
can look in the VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataParser.cxx source file at the method 
vtkXMLDataParser::ReadUncompressedData to see how uncompressed binary 
data are read.

First a 32-bit unsigned integer value is read that specifies the length 
of the rest of the data in bytes.  Note that the DataStream member 
abstracts the view of the base64 encoding so the length is in unencoded 
bytes.  In your case the value should be 8 since there are 8 unsigned 
char values.

Message-ID: <8b3894bc0702160538i7a4b804ds292817fb4c250cd1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List;

I'm a bit overwhelmed by the shear volume of different formats Paraview can
display...

I want to represent a bunch of 4D arrays (x, y, z, alpha) with unit (1x1x1)
cubes (I *have* to use cubes). Each cube represents a 3D coordinate in space
*and* it has an alpha value for transparency (0 = invisisble, 1 = solid).
It's actually the same array that changes with each iteration of a program,
some of the cubes (3D points) disappear and re-appear with each iteration.

I'd like to know:
(1) Is it possible to save this as a single file and view it as an
animation?
(2) If yes, what file format should I use?
(3) Is there perhaps another approach?

I'd really appreciate any help, Google was not my friend today.

Regards,
WH

Message-ID: <d71426460702161107o222c2371rb0e2fa38d96be9d7@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I had a complete working filter in Paraview 2.5 that took in two inputs:
Input (vtkDataSet) and Source (vtkMultiGroupDataSet). In porting the code
over to work in 2.6 I stumber across the following error:

Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file:
/root/paraview-2.6/VTK/Filtering/vtkExecutive.cxx
(688)
 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0xe992e18): Algorithm

  Request: REQUEST_DATA
  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0
  GROUP: 0
  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1
  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
  INDEX: 0
ErrorMessage end

The error is repeated for each group of the multigroup dataset input, with
the GROUP: value incrementing.

Does anyone know of any possible changes through versions, or any other
reason why this error would be occuring?
I have included the pvsm and xml files below.

Thank You in advance

It looks like your algorithm is returning 0 from RequestData. Can you verify
if this is the case?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView III February Snapshot
Message-ID: <45d654b0702161156i6b4cba60jf67f0a52e9cbfdd1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I posted the January snapshot of ParaView III. The download links and
announcements for all snapshots cam be found at: http://paraview
.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

This snapshot includes binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (intel only,
I will start posting ppc binaries again next month). The source can be
obtained through CVS.

Here are some the things we have been working on:

* Animation support: ParaView 3 has now an animation panel very similar to
ParaView 2. There is not track editor at this point.
* Improved time support: We are working on integrating recent time-support
changes in the VTK pipeline to ParaView. You will notice that some of the
readers no longer have a time step property. This is because the time
editing capabilities are moving to the animation panel.
* Improved python support including client-side delivery. The python API is
evolving very rapidly, once it matures, we will post documentation.
* Property and camera linking. This is a very cool feature. Check the wiki
for documentation.

What is coming next month:

* Lookmark support
* Much improved 2D plotting support
* Volume rendering interface
* Improved color map editor
* Plugins

On another note, ParaView 3 now requires Qt 4.2.2 to build.

There is still very little documentation. Look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III to get more information on the new
features. We will continue adding more documentation to this page as we
progress. We started working on Qt assistant based online documentation. It
will be available soon.

Have fun.

Subject: [Paraview] CMake Changed Path to Library
Message-ID: <45D9D2D2.70700@psc.edu>

I had accidentally set one of the cmake parameters to 
/mydir/libMesaGL.so. This file didn't exist; I had meant to enter 
/mydir/libGL.so.

However, there was a very old file at /usr/lib/libMesaGL.so. Instead of 
saying "file not found" cmake merrily linked to this old file.

Is this a bug or a feature? Does cmake ignore the path to a library?

Details:
   cmake 2.0.6
   SuSe SLES8
   2 Itanium2 IA-64 processors per node, 32 nodes

Kent,

	Could you please try again (in a new directory) to build with CMake 2.4.6.
	I believe this issue was fixed. The link was done with -lMesaGL and 
-L/mydir so depending on the order of the link directory the linker 
would not pick the correct library.

Again, you'll need to start in an empty directory.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20070220095855.033addb0@pop.ncsa.uiuc.edu>

Hello paraviewers,

I have a question about default directories in paraview 2.4. I am running 
in client server
mode. I notice that when I run the server (pvserver) as myself the default 
directory
for opening files is my home directory on the server. This makes sense but for
reasons that I will not elaborate on I would like to be able to specify a 
different
directory as the default. That is when I first try to read a file I would 
like the menu to
open to directory /foo/paraview instead of /home/semeraro. Is there an 
environment
variable I can set to make this happen? Is it even possible without 
altering the source?

Regards,
Dave Semeraro

Message-ID: <29D70E39-F7A2-4351-A2E2-3194D338F42B@gmail.com>

I would like to confirm a bug that I think I found. I am working with  
Time Data and this is what happens.

Open a new data set that has 100 time steps. Move the slider to show  
time step 50. The render window updates just fine. Now, click the  
"Play" button from the Animation tool bar located at the bottom of  
the Render Window. The animation starts from Timestep 0. Is this a  
bug or intended behavior?

Thanks

The animation uses the values set in the keyframes, not the current 
value for the timestep. If you want your animation to begin with 
timestep 50, you should go the Animation panel and edit the first 
keyframe from "TimeStep" for the appropriate reader and change it to 50.

So this is intended behavior. Huh.  I was using it to quickly scan  
through my data file to find something interesting, then wanted to  
start the animation from where I stopped scanning. All without having  
to touch the key frame deal. Just seems counter-intuitive to me but  
sometimes my brain isn't thinking like everyone else's.

Subject: [Paraview] Rotational Extrusion
Message-ID: <22c30b9e0702201109te70a2bfs7ecee2886ae382b5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to use paraview 2.6 to look at some CFD data for on supersonic
nozzle that has the flow field aligned with the X-axis. Since my problem is
axisymmetric I analyzed only a small portion of the nozzle's circumference (
3.5 deg.). I wish to use the rotational extrusion filter to rotate resulting
data about the X-axis so I can get the "complete 3D" nozzle picture. It
looks like the default rotation axis is the Z-axis. Is there anyway to
rotate the surface along the X-axis rather than the Z-axis? If not, would it
be possible to respecify paraview's  X,Y,Z orientation axis? -> then I would
be able to use the rotational filter the way I want...

Thanks,
Bruno F.

Hi Bruno,

There is not a way to specify which axis the rotational extrusion filter 
should use. However, you could first apply a transform filter, and 
change your dataset's orientation such that the original X axis becomes 
the new Z axis. Then applying the rotational extrusion filter should do 
what you're looking for.

Subject: [Paraview] LOOKUP_TABLE: Transparency problem
Message-ID: <8b3894bc0702210436g220cee3rea6103ea4df0631d@mail.gmail.com>

List;

I have a simple VTK legacy file which contains one voxel of type 11 (it's a
cube). I have defined my own lookup table, and specified the rgba (0.0 0.0
1.0 0.5) values. When I view this in the latest ParaView (Linux), it seems
as though the transparency only works form one side of the voxel, three
adjacent faces of the voxel remain opaque, I cannot see through them.

If I define a cube source, and set the opacity inside ParaView, I get the
expected behaviour, i.e., the whole cube is transparent.

Is this related to the lookup table, or is it a ParaView setting? I'm not
attaching pic's as they'll probably get scrubbed.

Message-ID: <b3d71aa40702210800g79db1708y460cc514d1cf57f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to bring in the vtkBMPReader into paraview but am not sure how
to go about it. I know how to enable an existing vtk class as a filter in
paraview.

I was wondering how the xml and pvsm files would be written for a reader
since readers usually dont have a GUI. Am I supposed to add this reader as a
filter and take the bmp file as an input or is there any other way to do
it??

Also, after reading the bmp file, does vtkBMPReader generate a vtkImageData
output?

Thanks

I checked xml files and code for other readers, which all seem to have a
GetFileName() which isnt there in vtkBMPReader. How do I provide input to
this reader?

Any help will be really appreciated. Thanks.

Hi Bikash,

That method is available for vtkBMPReader. It is implemented in 
vtkImageReader2, which is the superclass of vtkBMPReader's direct 
superclass, vtkImageReader.

Hey folks,

I can't get the CellData to display in Paraview for the second piece

having multiple pieces?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] large elevation data file
Message-ID: <45DC9E3E.9030304@psu.edu>

Hi,

I have a LIDAR data file that is too large to load in ParaView.  I 
define it as a vtk file with the header

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
elevation
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 6060 6060 1
ORIGIN 0 0 0
SPACING 1 1 1
POINT_DATA 36723600
SCALARS elevation float 1
LOOKUP_TABLE default

ParaView blows up with an error vtkFloatArray: Unable to allocate xxx 
elements.

Should I partition the data file somehow to work with ParaView, or did I 
define the header info wrong?
Any ideas welcome.

Message-ID: <b3d71aa40702211214o2f495c4cuec735f99d561c2a8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I was wondering what blanking a structured grid with an image means?? Is it
something like draping an image on a structured grid??

Also, I tried to intergrate the vtkBlankStructuredGridWithImage class into
paraview but it is giving me the error below. The filter takes in two inputs
- an unstructured grid and the image to use for blanking(vtkImageData). From
the class reference I found that GetBlankingInput() is the method to get the
blanking image. I have also copied my .pvsm and .xml files here.

I think I am making a mistake in calling the multiple inputs. Can anyone
help me identify the error?

Thanks

Are you running under Windows or Linux?  I have had many "large" vtk data
sets that crash ParaView on a Windows system because it cannot allocate the
memory.  These same vtk data sets load correctly under Linux.  I was able to
get a simple dataset based on your description to load under Linux.  The
same dataset would not load in ParaView under Windows.  The reason that this
occurs is the default windows version of ParaView is 32-bit.  32-bit memory
addressing under Windows is slightly less than 2 GB.  According to "top" on
Linux, ParaView is running at 2GB.  (FYI: My Windows machine is running
Windows XP 64-bit and has 8 GB of RAM.)

Message-ID: <web-134665792@infinito.it>

Has someone successfully generated a .vtu file (vtk 
unstructured file in xml sintax and binary format) by a 
fortran code?
XML ascii format has been successfully used but the binary 
one dosen't work...
I tried "unformatted" fortran file with either sequential 
access or direct access, but it doesn't work. I also tried 
either LittleEndian or BigEndian.
Any tips are welcome.
Thank you very much!

Paul,

Thanks for your response. Actually I got the data from someone running 
windows who was using a VTK script to down sample it by a factor of 4 to 
get it to load.
I am using a 64-bit Linux box with 6 GB of ram that will load the data 
file in ParaView but crashes if I try to apply a filter. I tried to run 
on a cluster in client/server
mode but was unable to load the data because of the file size (unable to 
allocate xxx float error) . The whole data set will not load at all in 
VTK (64-bit build).
It just seems to big to work with as a single file so should I break it 
into smaller files for ParaView, and would that fix the (unable to 
allocate xxx float error)?

Jack,

It seems like your entire file is about 140 MB. Is that correct? On a 
system with several GB of memory it seems like that would not be a 
problem. Of course PV's use of memory may not be optimum.

We've looked at files with PV that are 10 GB on Linux/Unix systems. If 
you like contact me offline about sending the file here and I can do a 
simple test (read, contour, etc.).

Message-ID: <b3d71aa40702220808m1fa0127dqfc1bbb6ab41a1de@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

When I bring in an image file into paraview, it loses most of its colors. I
enabled the vtkBMPReader class to bring in a bmp file, but the image is not
being displayed properly. I am guessing that paraview is using 256 color
mode to display those images.

Any way to fix this?

thanks

I didn't tried with VTU files but I succed with Ensight files.
It should be the same problem

Did you tried to write your data  with FORM='BINARY' which is the 'C 
Binary'.
This form is only available on Windows OS.
It is the first step in coding before writing with FORM='UNFORMATTED', 
ACCESS='DIRECT'
When you you write your data with a direct acces, do you write all your 
data in one times ?

Message-ID: <b3d71aa40702220931g14f5b371h865197f927943632@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I added the vtkTIFFReader class to paraview and tried to open tiff files. It
worked fine for smaller files of arnd 5-6mb but when i tried opening a .tif
file of size 65mb, paraview crashed with the errror below:

ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: /root/Project/ParaView-
2.6-Source/VTK/Common/vtkDataArrayTemplate.txx (266)
 vtkIdTypeArray (0xd83f980): Unable to allocate 184320470 elements of size 8
bytes.
ErrorMessage end

I read jack's post about being unable to open large elevation files. What
might be the issue here? I'm running Paraview 2.6 on a fedora core 6 machine
with 3GB ram.

thanks,

Trying to allocate that many elements at 8 bytes each takes  
1,474,563,760 bytes or 1.4 GB. If ParaView was compiled for 32 bit  
then you may have reached its limit. I know on my own OS X machine  
with when ParaView gets much above 1GB of used RAM I should start  
praying..

I don't pretend to know anything about memory management under any of  
the Operating Systems. In my naive world, even in 32 bit mode there  
should be at minimum about 2GB of Memory available, or 4GB if the  
memory pointer that is used is and unsigned 32 bit integer. That is  
in my own little world where I understand things. In the real world  
it doesn't work that way. Maybe someone can explain it to us.

I still can't get CellData for more than one piece to diaply using  
UnstructuredGrid in Paraview with the XML format. However, it works  
with the legacy format. I would still prefer to use the xml format,  
so any suggestions are most welcome. This is the legacy file that  
works, and below it the xml file that doesn't.

The "Piece" elements are meant for multiple pieces of *geometry*.  They
are meant for streaming computation to reduce memory usage.  All the
pieces have to have the same set of data arrays.

Can anyone please tell me why the TIFF reader allocates 8 bytes to each
element?? This is resulting in very slow rendering of TIFF files and the
inability to open larger ones.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20070223134956.034c1be8@pop.ncsa.uiuc.edu>


Hello,

I am having a strange problem I cant seem to diagnose. I have a 5 node Rocks
cluster, 4 tiles and one head node. I am running paraview in client server 
mode.
Everything works fine running the server on the tiles and the client on the 
head except
when the first node in the hostfile is tile -1-1, the last node in the 
cluster. In that
situation the client hangs in the splash screen.

The odd bit is that the cluster is stable and homogeneous. I can kill the 
server and
the node does not freeze or crash. The system is happy as a clam as long as
tile-1-1 does not have to be mpi rank 0 and talk to the client. It doesnt 
seem to be
a network problem because the client connects to the server on tile-1-1 as 
verified by
the client connected message. It just seems to stop communicating. Anyone else
ever have this problem? I would suspect a hardware problem except for the 
fact that
everything runs fine when tile-1-1 is not the first node in the cluster.

Regards,
Dave

Subject: [Paraview] VRML2.0 error
Message-ID: <45E1E8F8.7070704@psc.edu>

Hello,

I have a VRML 2.0 file that I am trying to open with Paraview 2.6, and 
when I attempt to do so, all I get is a blank set of axis, and constant  
beeping when I try to rotate it.  The error logs keep repeating the 
following message continually:

There was a VTK Error in file: C: dev ParaView26 VTK Filtering 
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx (718)
 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0E14CCC0): Input port 0 of algorithm 
vtkVRMLSource(0E14C3D8) has 0 connections but is not optional.

I at first thought that the error could be in an error prone data file, 
but after having opened it with a number of other VRML capable graphics 
programs, I believe there is a some sort of bug or programming error in 
Paraview.   

If there is someone out there that has any information on this, or any 
advice on how to more effectively debug this, I would really appreciate 
the help.

Thanks,
Shawn

This is indeed a bug. I committed a fix to the ParaView repository. If you
are building from cvs, you can update the 2.6 branch and get the fix.
Otherwise, we will release 2.6.1 relatively soon (a few weeks probably).

Message-ID: <22c30b9e0702261012q3a543aa3j38add1379984cd31@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,
I have some 3D structured  data for an irregularly shaped object (ie, full
of curves). I'd like to create a 2-D line plot for some cell centered scalar
variables along a curvilinear segment of my mesh, say I = 1:IMAX, J =1, K=1
.Would it be possible to create a 2-D line plot of the scalars along the
this curvilinear segment  using ParaView?

Thanks,
Bruno Fletcher

Subject: [Paraview] Error message : what does it mean
Message-ID: <45E432F4.4010403@cscs.ch>

"ICET,0:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree."

I assume that the source and dest windows are of different sizes, and so 
paraview can't composite.
If this is so, then what's causing it? and how can I fix it.

I'm running ParaView 2.6 "blind"-by which I mean I'm logging onto a 
system remotely and can't see the displays themselves. I suspect 
something is awry with the screen/DISPLAY or something.

There are 4 machines/graphics cards, but I am getting the output as 
shown in the image. Only 1/4 of the data seems to be collected on the 
client (which is a dumb X server and I don't want it to render anything).

Any ideas of what I'm doing wrong?

thanks

I've found a number of requests for this, but no solution.

Is there an easy way to do this? (or even a hard way?)

John,

The Ice error message could probably be a bit more detailed....

In general ParaView/IceT can handle different sized windows on the
servers/client just fine.. The thing that it can't handle is when the
servers have different screen sizes from the other servers...

So...

Server 1: 1280x1024
Server 2: 1280x1024
Server 3: 1280x1024
Server 4: 1024x768   <---- No good... :)

I would go and check all the screen sizes of your server nodes and make
sure they match up....

Message-ID: <b3d71aa40702270819q39dfeaecx72420eb9b602147e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have a .vtk datafile which has structured grid data. I am trying to add a
property "scalars" to it in paraview so that I can choose to color the
object using that. I can see the data array "scalars" in the infornation tab
for the object but not the in the "color by" option in the display tab

I was able to to that using an unstructured grid datafile.

The datafile is copied below.

I guess you should try

for (k=0;k<z;k++)
 for (j=0;j<y;j++)
  for (i=0;i<x;i++)

instead of

for (i=0;i<x;i++)
 for (j=0;j<y;j++)
  for (k=0;k<z;k++)

Message-ID: <45E4E847.4070106@tufts.edu>

to all,

hi.  im trying to run ParaView 2.6 on an intel mac pro running 10.4.  im 
VERY new to a unix environment, so please bear with me.

after downloading the paraview 2.6 intel precompiled binaries, i attempt 
to launch paraview from the console (using ./paraview in the /bin 
directory).

i immediately get this message:

    ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed
    TK_Init error: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable

i have tried running paraview on a powerpc g4 and i got the exact same 
error message, so im pretty sure its something really stupid that im 
messing up.

any suggestions???

thanks,
jared

Hi,

Can anyone tell me if paraview currently supports autosegmentation?(from biological images) 

Thanks,

Thanks. I've passed this on and am waiting to see if the problem is 
resolved. I'm guessing that since everything else works fine, that this 
will do the trick.

Subject: [Paraview] Z Buffer Problem in Client-Server
Message-ID: <45E5B95B.8090801@psc.edu>

A small update has been made to ParaView bug #4368: it can be observed 
without using a special test file.

In client-server mode display just a sphere - no orientation axes, no 
center-of-rotation crosshairs. With "composition" on zoom in, so the 
sphere is behind you, then out till it is a dot, then back to the 
original size. 3 problems appear:

1) The Z-buffer-like problem where far triangles are shown in front of 
near triangles.

2) Picking a point on the surface for the new center of rotation gets 
the Z wrong (the point will be much closer than the picked point).

3) Zoom via the right mouse button becomes so fast it is hard to control.

Turn off composition (i.e., render on the client) and the problems go 
away. All this is with PV 2.4.4 on Linux.

The "real" test case consists of a complex network of arteries where the 
back side of many arteries are shown instead of the near side. We wish 
to "fly" around to look at special phenomena and, after a while, see the 
same problems observed using the sphere.

Has anyone else seen these problems?

hey again,

so, to follow up on my previous email, i have also tried to build 
paraview directly from the source code (following the wiki's 
instructions and making the necessary adjustments to ccmake options such 
as adding WI,-search_paths_first to the listed linkers)

the make of the program appears to work fine

afterwards, i try to run ./paraview (from the /bin directory) and i get 
the same error messages as when i was trying to run the pre-compiled 
binaries:

    ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed
    TK_Init error: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable


very frustrating.....i could use some help!!

Subject: [Paraview] Opening/exporting transient Ensight files
Message-ID: <20070228181622.605AB7279D@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hy everybody,

I wonder know if anyone have already tried to use PV to convert files. As
the newest versions of PV do not have full support for Ensight files, I was
thinking about writing a batch script (or something similar) to open Ensight
files and export them in PVD (or any other vtk-like-format). I tried it in
PV 2.2.1 but PV only saved the last time step (even notifying that it would
be saving all the transient data). 

I still keep using PV 2.2.1 since it was the last version which has support
to "append datasets" and "clean to grid" filters. I was intending to open my
pieces of parallel model (several case files each one pointing to other
transient data), append and clean everything in PV 2.2.1 and export the
resulting dataset in other more well supported format. Is it feasible?

Thanks for any help

Ps.: Just a question for Kitware developers:

- As VTK/PV file formats are XML based, why is there a zillion of different
file extensions (pvd, vtp, vtu, vti, vtr, vtm)? The kind of the stored data
should be included in a XML field of a general purposed file extension.

Message-ID: <8b3894bc0702281158w7e70384fn88b3f6fdab36b858@mail.gmail.com>

List;

I've come across 'odd' behaviour when objects are
transparent: An object with an alpha value < 1.0 can hide another
transparent. The file below contains two cubes, blue and green. The blue
cube is visible through the green cube, but not vice versa (if you rotate).
Also, if I set the blue cube's alpha value (in the lookup table) to 0.0, it
completely hides the green one, I would've expected to see the green cube
since the blue one is transparent (?)

The only way to get around this is to set the opacity value to anything <
1.00 in the Object Inspector (Display/Style), then it works, which is
probably OK, but it's freaking me out... This is for ParaView 2.6 and alpha
3.

Is this the intended behaviour? If not, what gives?

If so, then the *TCL_LIBRARY* environment variable needs to be set.

This is expected behavior in ParaView 2.6.  It is because we are
z-buffer depth sorting.  The correct thing to do is to draw all items in
the order of back to front.  This code that implements this is currently
expected to be in ParaView 2.6.1, which should be out in a month or so.

Message-ID: <763E0356-3F46-4BFA-9672-DBCB55530372@mcs.anl.gov>

When I run ParaView 2.6.0 in pvclient/pvserver mode the LOD doesn't  
seem to kick in until I change the LOD value.  Each time a load a new  
data set, or apply a filter to one that is already loaded, it doesn't  
automatically switch into LOD mode while interacting.  Once I change  
the LOD value I start getting decimated geometry, and it works as  
expected, but it initially always does full-res rendering.  This is  
true even if the LOD value is set to a low value before the data is  
loaded; it does full-res rendering.  When I then increase the LOD  
value the decimated geometry is calculated and displayed while  
interacting.  I don't see this behavior using the standalone paraview  
application, only in pvclient/pvserver mode.

Has anyone else run into this problem?

Thanks,
joe.

Paul,

Thanks for the reply.  The error message i am getting is only:

    ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed
    TK_Init error: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable

There is no mention of the tcl_library.  Should i try to set that 
variable anyway???  How do i go about doing this?

Thanks again for any help

Paul,

My fault for not being more specific.  I am using an intel mac (10.4.8), 
using a bash shell and the computer is local.

It looks like i hadnt set my DISPLAY env. variable.  When i typed in

/    echo $DISPLAY/

i was given an empty line (guessing that this wasnt set already).  I 
went ahead an then set the variable to the local dispaly
/   
    export DISPLAY=:0.0

/Then, i tried again to launch paraview.  This time, i was greeted with 
a new error message.

    /Paraview error: InitializeTcl failed
    Tk_Init error: this isn't a Tk applicationcouldn't connect to 
display ":0.0"

/(i left /applicationcouldn't /as one word, since this is how the error 
was displayed). 

More info (compiled from previous posts).  I have tried running paraview 
(2.6) from the precompiled binary.  I get the same message.  I have also 
tried running paraview (2.6) on a powerpc (using the powerpc precompiled 
binary).  Again, same error messages.

Any more ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] Question about custom interfaces within Paraview
Message-ID: <45E5FEF3.2000807@leeds.ac.uk>

Hi,
I'm writing for some general advice about Paraview for a particular 
application I have in mind. I wish to write a simplified interface that 
early stage university students can use to bring in CFD datasets and 
explore these using paraview. The idea is that instead of giving 
students free reign over the tools within paraview to explore the 
datasets, they will be lead through a number of exercises to help them 
understand the physics of the flow simulations. Since this is targeted 
at 1st year students I don't want them to get caught up in intricacies 
of CFD (that comes later) - rather focus on the physics of the flow. I 
believe there's a real educational driver for this.  I'm looking at a 
variety of options but my questions are these:
1. Is it possible to build simplified interfaces within Paraview ?
2. Is it possible to script in basic functions so that students can dial 
in (say) Reynolds number using a slider bar and get Paraview  to load in 
the right datasets ?
3. How hard is something like this to a mathematically competent 
engineer with experience of programming in a variety of languages / cfd 
codes etc. etc. (OK and how long is string).

I realise this is mighty vague but from the enthusiasm from a whole 
range of colleagues and the offers of people to provide all sorts of 
exciting data sets its something I'd really like to have a shot at!.

Many thanks, Nik

ParaView version 2.6 (via CVS this morning) still crashes on my Fedora 
Core 5 (Pentium 4) system when reading this wrl file. The first part of 
the traceback:

#0  0x0959f69b in vtkVRMLImporter::exitField ()
#1  0x095a2342 in yyparse ()
#2  0x095a27f6 in vtkVRMLImporter::ImportBegin ()

#4  0x08e86125 in vtkVRMLSource::RequestData ()
#5  0x0a3b34d4 in vtkExecutive::CallAlgorithm ()

VTK 5.0.2 also crashes at about the same place. However, the file 
displays without problems in freewrl.

The wrl file was produced by someone else by an application with which I 
am not familar. Is the VRML importer robust enough for any error in the 
wrl file? Is there an application out there that can verify the 
integrity of the wrl file?

Thanks!

Should it be related to a somewhat similar issue, answered by B. Geveci,
on 22.11.2006 (thread "Transparent Surfaces Mottled") ?

In fact, it seems that this issue is not specific to paraview, but to VTK,
because others viewers using VTK have the same issue. Right ?

to all,

ok, so everything is working fine now.  this is probably an embarrassing 
mistake (due to my inexperience with unix).

i didnt realize that paraview needed to be run from the x11 terminal.  i 
had been trying to launch it from the normal terminal window.

once i realized this very stupid mistake, everything works great!!

thanks for all the suggestions that were sent
