Subject: [Paraview] cmake errors
Message-ID: <45E6F821.30004@cora.nwra.com>

Trying to build MPI version of paraview 2.6.0 with cmake 2.4.6, get lots 
of errors like:

CMake Error: Error in cmake code at
/builddir/build/BUILD/ParaView-2.6.0/Utilities/IceT/doc/man/CMakeLists.txt:48:
ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET called with invalid target name 
"man3/icetBoundingBoxd.3".  Target names may not contain a slash.  Use 
ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate files.  Set CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY 
to 2.2 or lower to skip this check.
Current CMake stack: 
/builddir/build/BUILD/ParaView-2.6.0/Utilities/IceT/doc/man/CMakeLists.txt

I filed a bug against 2.4.4 
(http://paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=4206&pos=2) back in December.

(Looks like 2.6 needs to get added to the bug tracker).

Gah, it's this stuff that stuff that really drives me crazy about cmake. 
  Otherwise I really like it, but this "run it twice to fix things" is 
just voodoo.

Thanks.

I observe the same erroneous behavior.  I took the liberty of submitted
a bug report (#4522).

Subject: [Paraview] pv 2.6.0: LOD in client server mode

 

When I run ParaView 2.6.0 in pvclient/pvserver mode the LOD doesn't seem
to kick in until I change the LOD value.  Each time a load a new data
set, or apply a filter to one that is already loaded, it doesn't
automatically switch into LOD mode while interacting.  Once I change the
LOD value I start getting decimated geometry, and it works as expected,
but it initially always does full-res rendering.  This is true even if
the LOD value is set to a low value before the data is loaded; it does
full-res rendering.  When I then increase the LOD value the decimated
geometry is calculated and displayed while interacting.  I don't see
this behavior using the standalone paraview application, only in
pvclient/pvserver mode.

 

Has anyone else run into this problem?

 

Thanks,

joe.

Although I haven't asked this specific question, I would assume that this transparency fix should migrate into PV3.  Due to schedule, I am not sure if it will make the 3.0 release.

Should it be related to a somewhat similar issue, answered by B. Geveci, on 22.11.2006 (thread "Transparent Surfaces Mottled") ?

In fact, it seems that this issue is not specific to paraview, but to VTK, because others viewers using VTK have the same issue. Right ?

Cheers,

The best thing would probably be for you to describe the data and how
it's laid out in the file. What type of data is it? Is it image data? Is
it point data? Is it polygonal data? What type of data do you have at
each position in space, scalar, vector, matrix? When you consider all of
the types of data that ParaView is meant to work with there really isn't
a simple text file.

Also ParaView and VTK can only handle 3 spacial dimensions. You can
always write a program to look at any three dimensions as space, pick
one for time, one for color, one for transparency, one for some sort of
glyph, .... I get N-D nightmares! 

ITK is made to work with N-D data.

There is a reader ( the particle reader ) that works for one fairly
common type of text file, that is points with scalar values like this:

x1 y1 z1 v1
x2 y2 z2 v2
x3 y3 z3 v3
.
.
.

or even :

x1 y1 z1 v1 x2 y2 z2 v2 x3 y3 z3 v3 . . .

Hi Nik,

There is no easy answer to your questions :-) We are working on structuring
paraview 3 such that building custom application easier. Furthermore, we are
working on providing most of the functionality through python such that you
can easily do anything from scripting paraview to creating a completely
custom app using something like Tkinter or PyQt. However, the main
difficulty is going to be climbing up the learning curve. Currently, there
is very little documentation on how paraview can be customized other than
some example apps and the documentation of the source code itself. I would
think that learning enough of the code base to build a custom app would
require quite a bit of dedication and at least several weeks if not months
of experimentation.

However, there is hope :-) There are several features in paraview that
allows customization without building a custom app:

* Modules - these allows exposing the interface of pipeline elements in a
way defined by xml configuration files. Once complete, they will also allow
custom user elements based on Qt
* Lookmarks
* Custom filters

I would start experimenting with paraview 3 but hold off any major effort
until it is actually release (later this spring).

It is a bug. It is reporting the wrong output type. If you bring up
the statistics view (which reports the right type), you will see that
the output is multi-group.

Hello,

Quick question. I was wondering about the scaling ability of paraview. I 
have only run it
on a couple of dozen processors. I was wondering what is the largest number 
of processors
paraview has been run on. Also, what are the sizes of some of the largest 
datasets that have
been analyzed? Any volunteers?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Slow Render
Message-ID: <45EC9CA9.8060700@ucar.edu>

Hi,

I am running Linux, Fedora core 6.  I am experiencing painfully slow 
refresh of the display, especially the file menus, checkboxes, etc... 
when using paraview. I am able to run other 3d programs with great 
(fast) results.  The problem seems to have something to do with the 
graphics widgets paraview uses for display, rather than anything related 
to the 3d.  Has anyone experienced this, or does anyone have a 
suggestion for something to try?
Thanks in advance,
David

Hello to everybody!

I'm testing the 2.6 version of paraview and the new fluent data loader.
The mesh is correctly visualized, but the other datas are not correct:
i.e. the temperature varies in a unphysichal range of -278 to 773 K,
while in the original data varies between 298 to 773 K.

Any ideas?

Thanks to everybody for the attention.

This is expected behavior in ParaView 2.6.  It is because we are
z-buffer depth sorting.  The correct thing to do is to draw all items in
the order of back to front.  This code that implements this is currently
expected to be in ParaView 2.6.1, which should be out in a month or so.

Subject: [Paraview] Error: Transparent objects actually solid?


List;

I've come across 'odd' behaviour when objects are transparent: An object
with an alpha value < 1.0 can hide another transparent. The file below
contains two cubes, blue and green. The blue cube is visible through the
green cube, but not vice versa (if you rotate). Also, if I set the blue
cube's alpha value (in the lookup table) to 0.0, it completely hides the
green one, I would've expected to see the green cube since the blue one
is transparent (?)

The only way to get around this is to set the opacity value to anything
< 1.00 in the Object Inspector (Display/Style), then it works, which is
probably OK, but it's freaking me out... This is for ParaView 2.6 and
alpha 3.

Is this the intended behaviour? If not, what gives?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView III March Snapshot
Message-ID: <45EDEBC3.9050804@gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

Berk has posted the March snapshot of ParaView III. The download links 
and announcements for all snapshots can be found at: 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

This snapshot includes binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (intel 
only). The source can be obtained through CVS.

Here are some the things we have been working on:

* Support for Plugins: ParaView 3 provides a much more powerful plugin 
support than that provided by ParaView 2. Examples are provided along 
with the source (in ParaView3/Examples/Plugins). Detailed documentation 
is available at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo
* Extended Animation support: ParaView 3 now makes it possible to 
animate Camera, Cut/Clip planes etc. There is no track editor at this point.
* Selection: We are working on improving the selection mechanism. 
Currently users can select cells/points by ids, location, or thresholds. 
Surface as well as frustum selections through the data are now possible.
* Plotting: Plot views are now a part of the main view. Splitting a view 
no longer creates a 3D render view by default. User can change the view 
type by right clicking on the view's title bar. Any 1D rectilinear grid 
data can now be plotted either as a XY line plot or a Bar chart.
* Improved dialog for editing color lookup tables.
* Xdmf Reader: Support for reading Xdmf files has now been enabled.

What is coming next month:

* More selection enahancements.
* Fixes/improvements to the Undo/Redo framework.
* Volume rendering interface
* Improved color map editor

On another note, ParaView 3 now requires Qt 4.2.2 to build.

There is still very little documentation. Look at 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III to get more information on the 
new features. We will continue adding more documentation to this page as 
we progress. We started working on Qt assistant based online 
documentation. It will be available soon.

Have fun.

Utkarsh.

See the http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo for how to make plugins to 
add your own readers, filters and other stuff.

Also, to get you started if you want, I threw together a little something.
I attached is some XML for creating vtkParametricFunctionSource objects in 
ParaView3.
The XML gives ParaView3 the ability to choose between vtkParametricBoy, 
vtkParametricConicSpiral, and vtkParametricEllipsoid.  The march snapshot of 
ParaView3 doesn't add this source to the sources menu, but I was able to get 
it in with a toolbar plugin almost identical to the example in the wiki.

in time for the initial 3.0 release.

TITAN2D for simulation of mass-flow (landslides, lahars etc) over 
natural terrains. So far we have been using tecplot for visualization. 
But we want to move towards HDF5 data format. I wanted to know if 
someone has an experience in using HDF5 data in Paraview. I would also 
like to know, how is the multiprocessor performance?

regards

Subject: [Paraview] Xyz files - wrong reader
Message-ID: <040DF00BF960A24897B5B3EFBE63FE8A03672681@ES20SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I have a user that wants to open up an XMol .xyz format file.  It keeps
being opened by the wrong reader - the Plot3d reader.  I have tried to
force the reader, using the Open file/ "Files of type" pulldown,
selecting the "XMol Molecule Files" and I still get the wrong reader.
Is there a fix for this?  Is this a bug?

Thanks,

Alan Scott

I am the original contributor. At this point, I would say don't bother. 
Once loaded, you will be disappointed with what ParaVview can offer for 
*molecular* visualization.
I would instead encourage you to look at another open-source 
contribution we have recently developed, and that is completely 
dedicated to molecular sciences. And if it matters, *yes*, there's VTK 
technology under the hood. :-)

give it a try:

Hi all,

I am experiencing the same problem with Probing filter as I did few
month ago with the Glyphing filter. See
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-November/004080.html.

For example:
RTSource(Wavelet)->GroupDataSets->GroupDataSets->Probe

Will there be someone to take care of this?

Thank you,
Milan.

I am experiencing the same problem too with a filter I wrote similar to
probe. It crashes when using datasets that are groups of a group.

Hi Bikash,

It might be worthy for you to have look at the Glyph filter and find
the way Berk fixed the same problem.

Cheers,
Milan.

Hi all,

I have a large structured grid dataset (6060x6060) that has an elevation 
data point associated with  point.  I want to covert the
data ParaView thinks is image data to a 3D elevation model. I assume 
this has come up before and I have tried the logical filters
like elevation:)  has anybody done this?

The elevation filter actually does something completely different.

You need to run your data through two filters: first "Extract Surface"
and then "Warp Scalars".

Hi Jack,

The elevation filter won't do that, but yes it has come up before. 
Here's what you should try.

First convert your data from image data to an unstructured data type 
(e.g., use the Clean to Grid filter to convert to unstructured grid). 
Then apply the Warp (scalar) filter, which defaults to warping along the 
Z axis to create your elevation model.

You need to run the dataset through the "Clean to Grid" filter first. This
merges points and converts to unstructured grid. Then use the "Warp(Scalar)"
filter to get the elevation. You might have to change the scalefactor to get
the desired elevation.

Message-ID: <A655D762-57AC-43AA-B96F-82F29DB616E0@onera.fr>

With Fortran 2003, it is now possible to write generic C binary files.


To illustrate, I join 2 files for those who would be interested into  
writing binary ensight directly from fortran. In the exemple it is is  
'BIG_ENDIAN' but you can also choose 'LITTLE_ENDEAN' .

This one is not as easy as glyph. Probe in general does not support
multiblock. Please add a feature request for it. I am guessing this
will be put off until after ParaView 3.

Is this the distribution you downloaded from the web? It looks like it
is missing the Infovis directory.

Yes, I downloaded it yesterday. I also just found the missing file in 
<src>/VTK/Infovis. There are actually many missing files. My workaround:

    cp Src2.6.0/VTK/Infovis/*.h PV/Utilities/VTKClientServer/Infovis/

It looks like cmake failed to reference the Infovis directory.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] using kw(vtktemp??) in scripts
Message-ID: <017a01c764f0$daf90530$90eb0f90$@ufrj.br>

Hi folks,

Doesn anyone could tell me how those kw(vtktemp) variables are created in PV
scripts? I'd like to use it to create a script but I have no clue how to do
it. Basically the script must do something like:

- Open some datasets;
- Apply a filter;
- Save the output dataset created by the filter.

I can already open the datasets and save them (including the transient
data), but I don't know how to select and pass them to the filter since I
don't know which kw(vtktemp) I have to refer. 

I've been doing like the following pseudo-code

#
# Loading files
#
for {set i 0} {$i < $NumberOfProcesses } {incr i} {
    set mytmp <--- point to the file to be read
    ...
    ...
}

#
# Applying the filter
#
$kw(vtkTemp1078) SetSelectState $mytmp 1  <--- HERE IS MY PROBLEM SINCE I
CAN ONLY SELECT THE LAST $mytmp


#
# Saving the resulting file
#
for {set i 1} {$i < NumberOfTimeSteps} {incr i} {
    $kw(vtkTemp2) WriteVTKFile $FullPath 0
    ...
    ...
}

Thanks for any help.

Hi Kent,

Which source distribution did you download? They look OK.

I downloaded ParaView-2.6.0.tar.gz.

This sounds like a make problem so I checked again - "make" on my system 
is GNU make 3.80. CMakeCache.txt also shows it is using that version.

I would guess that, if I haven't lost my mind, the problem is in one of 
those files that tells cmake what to do. Have you run cmake and make? If 
that works for you let me know and I'll start again with a fresh download.

Thanks!

Hi,

I am using a filter as a server plug-in in paraview3 but the problem is that
I have to load the plugin each time I run paraview. Is there a way to
automatically load plugins when paraview starts? Does the environment
variable PV_INTERFACE_PATH have any significance in paraview3?


Thanks,

Message-ID: <b3d71aa40703131232x6c06eb11k9ed0997997bbc4a7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is when I use the "Show Color Bar" option in Paraview3 , and set the
color map to "Use scalar range from data" . If I increase the range of the
scalars, the color bar updates accordingly but when I decrease the scalar
range it does not update.

The problem becomes very evident if the data has large scalar range say
1-100 and then I change the data to a smaller range say 1-10. The cells with
values 1-10 get colored with the pretty much the same color since the larger
color map is being used.

There is not a way to automatically load plugins at start up in the March

Subject: [Paraview] How can ICE-T composite translucent rendered images
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0703131614210.28377@hal>

Hello,

I was reading an article, saying that ICE_T implements sort-last 
compositing algorithm. Then, I wonder how ICE-T (used by Paraview) 
composite semi-transparent images coming from nodes that do volume 
rendering? Does Paraview have another compositing mechanism?

Many thanks,

In the case of volume rendering or translucent polygons, ParaView
redistributes the data to ensure a proper visibility ordering and then
IceT performs an ordered compositing.  We've recently published a paper
on how it all works:

Volume Rendering in ParaView." In Visualization and Data Analysis 2007,

Message-ID: <b3d71aa40703140828k5cee5e72xa352990e41f28eb8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I modified the linesource class to create a source object and tried adding
it as a plugin in PV3. The problem is that it does not show up in the
Sources menu when I try to load the plugin.

I changed the ProxyGroup from "sources" to "filters" to verify if there was
something wrong with the code and it did show up in the filters menu! Is
there a different way to add objects to the source menu in PV3??

Thanks,

Bikash

The sources menu isn't currently extendable like the filters menu is.
We can have that fixed for the next release.
Another option for now is to add a toolbar button that creates your source.

Hi Kent,

I remembered earlier today that when I built ParaView 2.6.0 on Linux and 
Mac, I turned off VTK_USE_INFOVIS in CMake. I don't remember now what 
the problem was, but this might have been it. See if you can build 
ParaView if you set this variable to OFF.

This is very weird. I can see the file in the tarball under
VTK/InfoVis. Are you sure the file is missing? Or is it a cmake
configuration error where the right directory is not searched for
includes?

That's right, Berk. My understanding of this problem has evolved but 
I've kept the same subject so its tied to related posts. There is no 
missing file.

As I note in my most recent message it is "not looking in the right 
directory". I think you are right, it is a cmake configuration error.

I'll try Amy's suggestion from 1:08 pm today.

Thanks!
Kent

Subject: [Paraview] Can pvserver run without X server?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0703141300510.524@hal>

Hello,

Has anyone run Paraview in client/server mode where the pvserver run on a 
computer (or cluster) without X server running? It seems to me that DRI 
can let an application access video hardware directly without going 
through X server.

Thanks in advance.

Berk,
  I can also create this error.  I believe that I fixed it by turning
infovis off, which I don't need.  Do you need me to look at it?

I think the answer is no. When composite is off the client does the 
rendering and the graphics card has to be at the client. When composite 
is on the server does the rendering but it only works through OpenGL or 
through Mesa which emulates OpenGL.

I think both must reach the graphics card through the X server. In other 
words, the X server "owns" the graphics card and manages all access to it.

The last system I know of that would do what you wanted was from SGI 
using their GL language, the precursor to OpenGL.

You should be able to use the OSMesa library to open a software-emulated
OpenGL context without connecting to an X host.  If you compile with the
OSMesa library and then use the offscreen command line option on the
client, then you can render and composite on the server without an X
host there.

We have been doing that for years with ParaView 2.X.  If it does not
work with ParaView 3, that would be a bug.

Thanks for the instant responses.

I've already built Paraview with OSMesa and run it with offscreen 
rendering option on a cluster without X.

However, I want Paraview do the rendering using GPU rather CPU as 
rendering with GPU is about 10-20 times faster than with CPU. If DRI has 
been adapted to provide OpenGL acceleration without an X Server running 
(ref http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure), then 
it is possible (theoretically at least) to avoid X server and at the same 
time enjoy video hardware acceleration. Am I right?

Amy, your change cured the problem. Perhaps a little fix in the 2.6.0 
distribution is needed!

Very interesting! It looks like you are right.

The important question is whether ParaView and/or VTK must make 
additional calls to use the DRI approach - is there a need to call, for 
example, something like "DRI_Initialize"? If so you'll need to figure 
out where to put those new calls.

How do you come to have a system with a graphics card but no X server?

Hi Kent,

I cannot answer your first question as I am new to DRI too. For your 
second question, we have quite a few computing clusters purchased with 
Sharcnet funding (www.sharcnet.ca). These clusters don't run X as their 
main usage is "pure computation" --- scientific simulations and analysis, 
etc. However, graphics card is installed in each node of the clusters, and 
is not exploited at all. We were wondering if we could turn the "computing 
cluster" into "rendering cluster"...... That's why I'm so interested in 
DRI.

Thank you for your thought.

I am trying to reproduce this problem without any luck. I just
downloaded 2.6.0 and compiled out of the box. I only changed to shared
library build. On Linux, cmake 2.4.6, gcc 4.1.2. It must have
something to do with cmake settings. What am I missing?

Subject: [Paraview] Compile of 2.6.0 Fails on Tru64
Message-ID: <45F84304.8090306@psc.edu>

There seems to be a problem defining ios routines under Tru64.

Sorry for the long message but I wanted to include all the 
information that might be useful. If you don't use Tru64 you 
probably don't want to read this!

======  Case 1

Set:
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING
    =-std gnu -pthread -verbose
The error:
    src/Servers/Filters/vtkSpyPlotReader.cxx, line 1172:
    class "ios" has no member "binary"

======  Case 2

Set:
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING
    =-std gnu -D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM -pthread -verbose
The error:
    cxx: Error: /usr/local/packages/paraview/2.6.0/src ...
    ... /Servers/Common/vtkCommandOptions.cxx, line 35:
    "ostream" is ambiguous (ambiguousname)
    vtkCxxRevisionMacro( ... );
    ^

======  Suspicious Difference

Before stopping at the above error the file 
vtkClientConnection.cxx compiled just fine (its in the same 
directory). Both use the macro vtkCxxRevisionMacro. So why 
did the macro work in one place but not the other?

The main difference is that the routine that failed includes 
vtksys/SystemTools.hxx which includes vtksys/ios/iosfwd 
which does some things with the io definitions and 
namespaces. It looks like ostream might be defined in more 
than one namespace hence the ambiguity.

======  System Settings

uname -a:
OSF1 rachel.psc.edu V5.1 2650 alpha

Compiler:
Compaq C++ V6.5-014 for Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.1B (Rev. 2650)
Compiler Driver V6.5-014 (cxx) cxx Driver

This seems relevant: the file 
<build>/VTK/Utilities/vtksys/Configure.hxx contains these 
lines (along with many others):

#define vtksys_IOS_USE_ANSI 0
#define vtksys_IOS_USE_SSTREAM 0
#define vtksys_IOS_USE_STRSTREAM_H 1
#define vtksys_IOS_USE_STRSTREA_H 0
# define KWSYS_IOS_USE_ANSI vtksys_IOS_USE_ANSI
# define KWSYS_IOS_USE_SSTREAM vtksys_IOS_USE_SSTREAM
# define KWSYS_IOS_USE_STRSTREAM_H ...
    ... vtksys_IOS_USE_STRSTREAM_H
# define KWSYS_IOS_USE_STRSTREA_H vtksys_IOS_USE_STRSTREA_H

It might take me a couple of weeks to figure out how all 
these interact! Can anyone suggest a few settings to try?

TIA!

Hy Marcio,

 

In my case, I?m only trying to load several Ensight files (one for each
parallel process), append everything and save them in some VTK format. After

working fine this script is tooooooooooooo slow.

append, clean and save in vtk?s format)

Hi, Renato. What exactly do you need? I think last year I had to write a
similar script:
::slice a geometry with 200 cut objects
::for each extract the time evolution of pressure in a probe line
::save each pressure history to a separated file file 

If you need something like this tell me and I can send you the scripts.

Cheers

Hi folks,

Doesn anyone could tell me how those kw(vtktemp) variables are created in PV

scripts? I'd like to use it to create a script but I have no clue how to do
it. Basically the script must do something like:

- Open some datasets;
- Apply a filter;
- Save the output dataset created by the filter. 

I can already open the datasets and save them (including the transient
data), but I don't know how to select and pass them to the filter since I
don't know which kw(vtktemp) I have to refer.

I've been doing like the following pseudo-code 

#
# Loading files
#
for {set i 0} {$i < $NumberOfProcesses } {incr i} {
    set mytmp <--- point to the file to be read
    ...
    ...
}

#
# Applying the filter
#
$kw(vtkTemp1078) SetSelectState $mytmp 1  <--- HERE IS MY PROBLEM SINCE I 
CAN ONLY SELECT THE LAST $mytmp


#
# Saving the resulting file
#
for {set i 1} {$i < NumberOfTimeSteps} {incr i} {
    $kw(vtkTemp2) WriteVTKFile $FullPath 0
    ...
    ...
}

Thanks for any help.

Completely ignore kw(vtkTempXXX) stuff (crap). That is just a
convenient way of referring to objects when writing state. The
commands that open a file or create a filter return a reference to the
object you can use.

For example:

# assign the main window to a variable for convenience
set mainWindow [$Application GetMainWindow]

# apply the elevation filter to the current object
# myElevationFilter will point to the filter afterwards
set myElevationFilter [$mainWindow CreatePVSource ElevationFilter]
$myElevationFilter AcceptCallback

....

# make the elevation filter current
$mainWindow SetCurrentPVSourceCallback $myElevationFilter

Properties are obtained in a similar way:
set imageSource [$mainWindow CreatePVSource ImageMandelbrotSource]
set extent [$imageSource GetPVWidget {Extent}]
$extent SetValue 0 25 0 25 0 25
$imageSource AcceptCallback

Scripting in 3.0 will be a walk in the park compared to this stuff :-)

OK, at least I am not going crazy. I managed to reproduce it. If you
run cmake a second time (or do a make rebuild_cache or use ccmake and
change something), the problem goes away. So it only happens if you
run cmake once and compile. There must be something wrong in the order
of things. I will take a look.

Kevin
  OK, I confess I'm still stuck. All I'm wanting to do is read an ascii file
in the form x(n), y(n), z(n), a1(n), a2(n), . . .  Where xyz are spatial and
an are other attributes for colorizing or other viz tricks.
  I really don't know where to go with the c++ VTK code you sent me (being
new to this, and not even having the VTK documentation).
  I looked at the particle viewer web page you sent me to, which also left
me ice cold -- not knowing what to do. Namely, how do I get the vtk particle
reader to work from ParaView?
  I've been roughly through the ParaView book and see where you bring in a
package, so, how do I get this simple package? I also see the ParaView XML
for reading in files, but, then don't I need a reader for those files? Back
to the beginning!
  It seems I must be missing something. There's gotta be something dumb for
simply structured ASCII, namely, something to use with import package. My
files are not that huge (yet) and I was hoping to go up the learning curve a
bit later.
  Or am I just nuts and have to plow through VTK first.

The C++/vtk code I sent you reads any 4 columns of a file like yours,
and then writes it out as a vtp file you can read with paraview.

Just pick 4 of your columns and put them into one file :

	awk < your_file.txt '{print $x, $y, $z, $v}' > new_file.csv

The paraview CSV reader should be able to read this file.

I have had a customer request to "slow down" the animation in  
Paraview (Vers 2.4 or 2.6). Right now it seems that ParaView is just  
rendering as fast as it can. Is there somewhere that I can hack into  
the code and put in a timer for the rendering loop?

Thanks

Why not use the real time mode? Then you can control the duration of
the animation accurately.

Huh.. I never took a look at that setting. Well Don't I feel like an  
Idiot. I guess this proves that you learn something new everyday.

Thanks for the heads up.

You are welcome. I am happy that I could say "oh, we already support
that!" instead of suggesting a hack :-)

Thanks for he help. I think I see where my afternoon is going. Sorry but I'm
a vtk/ParaView neophite and simultaneously in a teriffic HURRY. This is the
modern industrial guy disease wait, wait, wait NOW!!! So I have been looking
for quick fixes. There is a lot of documentation to plow through. I saw the
XML .pvd stuff in the ParaView book, but don't even have the vtk book, hopng
to avoid it for now. I'm just integrating in my mind how these things work
together.

Kevin and List, 
  Just a comment for the ParaView and vtk list: as a total newcomer to this
code but not to statistics or scientific visualization (though inactive for
a number of years), I'm pretty surprised that a simple ascii column (or
ordered n-tuple) reader was not put in here long ago! That threw me off, as
I just expected it to be available with zero effort. These days, it is
possible to do fairly sophisticated work even in what used to be junk tools.
For example, in Excel, generating tens of thousands of points, and needing
something much better than what Excel or similar programs provide for actual
analysis. It might be wise to expand the user community to those working in
such ways. I have a custom-written MPI beast of a simulator, yet, the
results are just ascii dumped as files, because to us, speed of construction
trumps all.
  thanks again for your help.

Hi, I have a time series and I am using paraview to animate it. I am using a 
legacy vtk unstructured grid(or poly data depending on pre vis processing) 
for each time step. How can I add an annotation with the file name used in 
the current frame??

is there some way to do it using a tcl statement??

Message-ID: <a7479ce00703200137s669ca3a2u241872aa5b97036c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am working on visualization for 3D CFD problems. The code gives me
velocity and vorticity components, and I am trying to extract "important"
features from the flow field.

Does anybody know if vortex core extraction methods are available for
ParaView? I am thinking to do something like the so-called lambda-2 method,
but other methods are ok as well...

Thanks a lot for your help,

Dear All,
 
Very new to this.  Want to know what the best format to work with would
be if I wanted to view meshless cfd data, i.e. it is just points in 3D
with flow field data??  Is this possible in paraview?  If so any
pointers would be useful.

Can you be more specific? I built and tested those binaries on a
MacPro without any problems. Can you describe under which conditions
the crash occurs? At startup? When doing something specific? Can you
describe your system? (OS X version, hardware configuration: CPU,
graphics card etc.)

not sure about "best". Minimally you could glyph the points with some arrows 
to indicate flow direction and magnitude(assuming you have vector data). I'm 
guessing thats going to be a mess though. For other visualizations such as 
stream lines you will want to generate geometry for your dataset. Delaunay 
filter is one way to do this but it's often prohibitively slow on 3d data. 
so. you most likely want to write your data out with the cells and grid 
structure in the first place. If you do that (so that your data sets have 
both point data and cells) all the filters in paraview will work for you.

Is your mesh structured or unstructured?
What kind of output file is your CFD program generating (plot3d,
Fluent,...)?

Subject: [Paraview] praview developers help on annotation during animation
Message-ID: <200703201448.19254.burlen@apollo.sr.unh.edu>

I am generating an annimation using the legacy reader. In each frame of the 
animation I would like to be able to show the file name in the annotation. 
And hopefully use the tcl interpreter to extract and format some information 
about the current time. Since the anotation entry boxes process tcl scripts 
it should be possible, hopefully. After reading sources I found that:

[[[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource] GetTimeStepWidget] 
GetValue]

does show the file name, of the current frame but does not change as a result 
of the animation control but only as a result of a change in the reader 
control. The question is how to make this update with the animation??

I traced through the sources all the way to vtkAnimationScene which isnt 
apparently in the sources.... hmmmm stuck here. PLease help. what source file 
should I be looking at for the actual code that acesses the reader during the 
animation??

Locally I have pv2.2 x86_64 sources and on another box i have pv2.4. are newer 
releases of pv coming with more annotation features built in??

I guess you are talking about file format on disk.
I recommend the use of the EnSight Gold format. I have written an API 
for C++ and FORTRAN which you can link into your code to write the case 
file, the geometry files, the scalar fields and the vector fields. It is 
efficient (writes in binary). Support transient data. Tested with pgcc6, 
gcc 4.1, f77, pgf90
We have the code embedded in at least two SPH applications.

The files created are readable by EnSight and ParaView.

drop me a mail if you are interested,
Jean

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 2.6 and Chromium issues
Message-ID: <460101F5020000C20000680D@co.mgn.netl.doe.gov>

I have encountered 2 problems when running Paraview 2.6 on Chromium.

1) While running paraview 2.6 on chromium with any conf file (crdemo.conf for example), I open a dataset.  When I hit accept in paraview, a second Chromium rendering window opens over the original chromium rendering window.  This issue shouldnt be with the conf file because I tried it with 2.4.4 and it works as expected.

2) This issue occurs with bothh 2.4.4 and 2.6 but not with 2.2.1.  When running a tilesort conf and choosing cell to point the colors for scalars become incorrect.  That is all "color by" values appear shades of green and black.  and this is only exhibited when running tilesort not locally (such as crdemo), and doesnt happen in 2.2.1.

So I am resigned to running 2.2.1 for the time being.  Is anyone else experiencing this?

I am running SuSE 10.2.

Thanks,
Terry

We never use Chromium because the native tile display support in
ParaView usually works a heck-of-a-lot better than the tilesort spu in
Chromium, so I cannot address your issues directly.

I do know however that at one point the coloring of point data was
changed to using vertex colors to using texture mapping (to get a better
interpolation of the scalars).  I don't remember exactly when that
change occurred, but around the time 2.4 was released (and you started
seeing these problems) sounds about right.  You can turn off this
behavior by going to the "Display" tab and clicking the "Interpolate
Colors" checkbox to on.  If that solves the problem, then the issue is
probably with Chromium not handling the texture mapping correctly.

I know where that 2nd window comes from. In 2.6, there is a code that
temporarily opens a 2nd window to test for OpenGL  extensions. It
comes and goes quite fast so it may not be noticeable when running
standalone. In client/server mode, it pops on the server side so you
never see it. There is no way to get rid of that, other than hacking
paraview. We fixed this issue in paraview 3.

If that's the case, you may be able to configure
Chromium to ignore the additional windows using
the ignore_window_list application parameter (see
http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/configapp.html
for more details).

Here's what I do.

//Path to a file.
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/include/openmpi;/usr/include/openmpi/openmpi

Under what situation does this problem arise?

I only ask because I've compiled PV2.4 & 2.6 numerous times with OpenMPI
support, and never had this kind of problem.

If I set it to /usr/include/openmpi, I get
..../VTK/Parallel/vtkCompositer.cxx:25:
/usr/include/openmpi/mpi.h:1757:33: error: ompi/mpi/cxx/mpicxx.h: No such file 
or directory

Which is why I add /usr/include/openmpi/openmpi to the include path.

I'm use MPI as is from the linux distro.

Thanks; that doesn't work. CMake doesn't complain but the result is as 
if the second directory is never added to the compile command.

As Clint pointed it out, the correct was of doing this is listing the
directories separated by ; (semi-colon):

MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/include/openmpi;/usr/include/openmpi/openmpi

Kevin
  I'm all over these books but can't find a reference to .csv files. (I know
that format exists). My paraview (2.6.0, for darwin, used on X-windows
running under OS X) does not recognize in its browser the .csv file I
created. The browser drop down menu has no mention of .csv, and every reader
I try on it exits ParaView with a string of errors.
  Is the darwin version somehow different?
  So I have been trying to use the legacy vtk file format. So far, that is
not working either, but at least the file is recognized in the browser, and
there's a legacy reader I can see in the browser. Maybe I have a bad
character somewhere.
  Still confused.

Hmm, all it does for me right now is dump a backtrace. That's not good.
I used to be able to select "all files *.*" from the list of readers,
and select my file. At this point ParaView would tell me that it doesn't
know how to open *.txt files, and present me with a second list of
readers. I'd select the "Coma Separated Values *.csv" reader, and in
would come my file.

Do you have VTK at all? Did you try the VTK program I sent you that does
exactly what you want?

I just got the vtk book, but haven't loaded the software yet. That and
trying your c++ code are next.
  I never got as far as comma separated values in ParaView -- that didn't
show up as an option. I tried some different readers as dumb potshots, but
all I got was those backtraces and an exit. That's why I was wondering if
the darwin (unix/Mac OS X) version is different. I know csv is prevalent on
Windows, but I thought all this stuff was cross-platform.
  Anyway I'm still flabberghasted that a simple text read is causing me this
much pain. It sure looks like the legacy .vtk ought to work, so why I got a
backtrace and exit from that I don't know. I could be doing that wrong.
  thanks for your help.

I get the same results as Kevin on Fedora Core 5 (Pentium 4) 
and ParaView 2.6.0. It just crashes after selecting 
test.csv. It seems to try to use the LS-Dyna reader.

There doesn't seem to be a csv reader in VTK 5.0.2. I just 
looked through the online class directory for those with 
"CSV" or "Reader" in the name.

It is cross platform. I get the same backtrace in linux.

There is no such thing as a simple text file. You want a multi column
text file loaded as points. Somebody else will want a text file to
represent an image, another person will want unstructured grids. The
number of possibilities are just mind blowing.

> It sure looks like the legacy .vtk ought to work, 

Only if you convert your data to this format. Try to create a small
pointset in paraview and save it in legacy vtk ascii format and take a
look at the file.

I didn't say so before but I see the LS-Dyna message too.

I don't think there ever was a special csv reader, I suspect that it
used the particle reader.

Message-ID: <0DB084BE537971419DC376EF0CD07840024773@glkms2122>


Hi,
 
To follow-up my previous post on "Viewing meshless [CFD] data", thought
I'd rephrase it.  Is there anybody out there using a) paraview and b)
using it to view there [meshless] SPH simulations???  If this is being
done then it means there must be a way forward for my meshless CFD
simulations?
 
To clarify, as there seemed to be a slight confusion last time, the
simulation method is meshless - there is no grid - that's kind of the
point (excuse the pun).  So the posts that asked me if it were a
unstructured or a structured simulation - it's an arbitrary cloud of
points where the solution data is stored - nothing more. And absolutely
no defined connectivity...
 
Hope this will help clarify my question,
 
Cheers,
 
Andy

We're using Paraview to visualise 
lagrangian data. The data is still 
generated by a mesh-tracking CFD code 
though and written in the 'legacy' .vtk 
format.

The lagrangian data is just a cloud of 
points each with some properties 
(velocity, mass, diameter etc.). We 
usually 'glyph' them as spheres where 
the diameter and/or colour are used to 
visualise the properties.

This is sounding promising, but I wanted to use the work "SPH" to try to
give an indication of what I was doing.  In fact these are just Euler
calcs, but instead of using FDM, FVM, or FEM, I'm using a meshless
method.  I'm not familiar enough with paraview (kind of why I'm checking
first) to understand some of the tech points people are making.  

Are people saying that basically I can only view streamlines, and vector
type plots?  Or are they saying that they've found a way to read in
meshless data but plot pressure fields, isosurfaces etc???

Getting a bit lost, but important to me that I make this distinction of
what I'm after. Basically I would want to view the full range of typical
CFD like scalar/vector plots surfaces, but without providing the mesh...

Is this too much...

Cheers,
Andy

If you read in meshless data, you'll get a load of points. You can 
triangulate this and then use a contour filter to get plots of pressure 
etc. But frequently the triangulation will produce meshes in regions 
where you don't want it to. There's also a splat filter for volume 
sampling the data, but it's expensive.

If you want something more sophisticated (ie specific), the contact me 
off list and I'll add it to my list of "features" that people using 
meshless data are interested in.

Ah, well, there's the rub.You want a meshy-like plot without the mesh. 
Above comment holds.

Parker, 

first of all I'd like to say that I'm not familiar with SPH, however I have
a friend that was working with DEM (same thing... a meshless method).
Sometime ago we were looking for information about how visualize his results
(he used to visualize using Ensight and representing the particles as points
-- beautiful results but toooooooooo slow) when we started to "converge" in
the same direction. It seems that there is a technique called "splatting"
used for representing the particles as fluids. It extracts the boundary
particles and create a surface linking them. Since I'm not a visualization
guy, I guess other folk here in this f?rum (or in the VTK's f?rum) could
clarify how this technique works (if I'm not wrong about what I found on the
net) and if PV (or VTK) has or will have such feature in the future.

Hope it helps in anything 

(Just trying to help... ;o)

Getting a bit lost, but important to me that I make this distinction of
what I'm after. Basically I would want to view the full range of typical
CFD like scalar/vector plots surfaces, but without providing the mesh...

Is this too much...

Cheers,
Andy

  Thanks for digging into this. As a new user I thought I was nuts.
  so, it seems to me there needs to be a simple text n-tuple reader. Maybe
the community thinks the legacy vtk file structure is enough. I'm still
working on that . . . But my first try failed. I THOUGHT I was following the
format in the vtk book (brand new, about v 5.0). Seems simple enough, but
that, too, crashed. I could still be making an error, and so will try again
today. (ugh, too much messing around.) it would be great if somebody has a
simple n-tuple ASCII file that WORKS that I could examine.

Hello,

When trying ctest on Paraview III I get a large number of errors. A lot of the
errors seem to come from missing data that the tests are looking for. Where can
I get this data so I can get a more realistic result from ctest.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView/CMake On Tru64
Message-ID: <46043989.9090203@psc.edu>

I've needed to set several parameters in CMakeCache.txt to 
get 2.6.0 to compile on a Tru64 system (version 5.1):

VTK_USE_EXECUTIVES:BOOL=OFF
VTK_USE_VIDEO_FOR_WINDOWS:BOOL=OFF
PARAVIEW_USE_ANSI_STDLIB:BOOL=ON
KWSYS_IOS_HAVE_STD_COMPILED:INTERNAL=TRUE

These don't show up in ccmake (I don't know about cmake -i) 
so CMakeCache.txt must be edited manually.

Have other users of Tru64 had the same experience? If so 
perhaps these should be added to cmake's rules for Tru64, or 
at least's paraview's rules.

Subject: [Paraview] CMake Producing Bad CXX Flags
Message-ID: <46043F3A.2010401@psc.edu>

A compile of 2.6.0 with MPI is failing because it is using 
"mpi.h" from /usr/include instead of the place I tell it. 
Here is the relevant line from my CMakeCache.txt:

MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=-I/usr/local/packages/
    mpich-1.2.7p1/ch_p4/include;/usr/local/packages/
    mpich-1.2.7p1/ch_p4/include/mpi2c++

The above is actually one line. I had CMake generate verbose 
  make files and found where CMake is producing a bad string 
for cxx's flags:

/usr/bin/g++
    ...
    -I/usr/local/packages/mesa/6.5.2/gnu/include
    -I/usr/local/packages/paraview/2.6.0/src/
=>    Servers/Filters/-I/usr/local/packages/
       mpich-1.2.7p1/ch_p4/include
    -I/usr/local/packages/mpich-1.2.7p1/ch_p4/
       include/mpi2c++
    ...
    /usr/local/packages/paraview/2.6.0/src/Servers/
       Filters/vtkPVMain.cxx

The above is actually one line with some material removed at 
the "...". Each "-I" is preceeded by a blank except on the 
line where I added "=>". I suspect the C++ preprocessor 
ignored that "-I" and so looked elsewhere for mpi.h.

I could find nothing like this in the paraview or cmake bug 
lists but did find a report of the same problem from 
9/7/2006 (Brad King replied that he could not duplicate the 
problem):

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/cmake/2006-September/010999.html

My system:
    x86_64 processors
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS release 4
    CMake 2.4.3 and 2.4.6
    g++ 3.4.6

Suggestions? TIA!

I am confused as to why there is a -I in the beginning of the
variable. The MPI_INCLUDE_PATH variable is simply a path not a flag
and therefore should not have a -I in it. It should look like:
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/packages/
    mpich-1.2.7p1/ch_p4/include;/usr/local/packages/
     mpich-1.2.7p1/ch_p4/include/mpi2c++

It is not surprising that cmake is producing a bad flag with -I in there.

  Show stopper is right. I just spent a bunch of time on the .vtk legacy to
find out that there are several fields required, not just a list of points.
Weird thing, in the vtk book, the set of fields shown in the description of
the UNSTRUCTURED_GRID definition is different from the example below it.
It's also weird because when it shows the data are float, well, those look
like integers to me. I get the ugly feeling I have to read a lot of this
book just to interpret the examples. Ugh, not too helpful.
  Thanks for the link, I'll check it out.

You found the problem! The generated flags now look good. Too bad cmake 
doesn't provide better diagnostics.

Hi All,

I am new to ParaView, and there is a feature quite common in other packages
that I cannot find... I have a 3D simulation of a flow around a wing; then I
create a cut on the wing, and I'd like to plot, say, the pressure on the
profile defined by this section of the wing. That is, to produce a X-Y plot
for a quantity defined on the profile. Is it possible to this within
ParaView? The probe seems to work on points or lines, while in this case the
"line" is given by the section of the wing.

Thanks for your help,
-Marzio

My ParaView tutorial is temporarily unavailable but I've 
attached a page from it where I show a very simple file in 
the VTK legacy format. It plus the document on VTK formats

    http://public.kitware.com/VTK/pdf/file-formats.pdf

should get you started. If you create a program that 
converts csv files to a VTK format please consider letting 
us all have a copy!

My example defines only 1-tuple scalars, for points and 
cells. Change the last number on the "SCALARS" lines from 1 
to N for n-tuple scalars. If you have 3-tuple scalars, and 
want it treated a vector, you should probably switch to the 
"VECTORS" keyword. You could leave out either the 
"POINT_DATA" section and/or the "CELL_DATA" section.

I have worked with enough of our users to know that what 
seems obvious to me can be a show stopper. Please ask!

Message-ID: <d3d4ab920703260726o62d6ac42n906b88909926d456@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to offer a small (and my first) contribution to the
ParaView 2.6 source code. It is a tensor glyph made available via
server manager. I am using the filter via Python interface and it
seems working fine.

There is also a little enhancement in the vtkTensorGlyph filter
itself. It is now supporting a COLOR_BY_EIGENORDER coloring mode. In
this mode a scalar value 1.0 is assigned to a glyph representing max
principal, 0.5 with mid principal and 0.0 with min principal
eigenvector.

The vtkPVTensorGlyphFilter is nearly a one to one copy of the
vtkPVGlyphFilter. It seems sufficient as there is very little
difference in the interfaces of vtkGlyph and vtkTensorGlyph.

Please, let me know if there is any interest in such contribution and
what should be done to make it more useful and easier to integrate
with ParaView source code. (By another words: is this the standard
practice to contribute?)

Thanks,
Milan.

// .NAME vtkTensorGlyph - scale and orient glyph(s) according to tensor eigenvalues and eigenvectors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTensorGlyph is a filter that copies a geometric representation
// (specified as polygonal data) to every input point. The geometric
// representation, or glyph, can be scaled and/or rotated according to
// the tensor at the input point. Scaling and rotation is controlled
// by the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of the tensor as follows. For each
// tensor, the eigenvalues (and associated eigenvectors) are sorted to
// determine the major, medium, and minor eigenvalues/eigenvectors.
//
// If the boolean variable ThreeGlyphs is not set the major eigenvalue 
// scales the glyph in the x-direction, the medium in the y-direction, 
// and the minor in the  z-direction. Then, the glyph is rotated so 
// that the glyph's local x-axis lies along the major eigenvector, 
// y-axis along the medium eigenvector, and z-axis along the minor. 
//
// If the boolean variable ThreeGlyphs is set three glyphs are produced, 
// each of them oriented along an eigenvector and scaled according to the 
// corresponding eigenvector.
//
// If the boolean variable Symmetric is set each glyph is mirrored (2 or 6 
// glyphs will be produced)
//
// The x-axis of the source glyph will correspond to the eigenvector 
// on output. Point (0,0,0) in the source will be placed in the data point.
// Variable Length will normally correspond to the distance from the 
// origin to the tip of the source glyph along the x-axis, 
// but can be changed to produce other results when Symmetric is on,
// e.g. glyphs that do not touch or that overlap.
//
// Please note that when Symmetric is false it will generally be better 
// to place the source glyph from (-0.5,0,0) to (0.5,0,0), i.e. centred
// at the origin. When symmetric is true the placement from (0,0,0) to
// (1,0,0) will generally be more convenient.
//
// A scale factor is provided to control the amount of scaling. Also, you 
// can turn off scaling completely if desired. The boolean variable 
// ClampScaling controls the maximum scaling (in conjunction with
// MaxScaleFactor.) This is useful in certain applications where 
// singularities or large order of magnitude differences exist in 
// the eigenvalues.
//
// If the boolean variable ColorGlyphs is set to true the glyphs are
// colored.  The glyphs can be colored using the input scalars
// (SetColorModeToScalars), which is the default, or colored using the
// eigenvalues (SetColorModeToEigenvalues).
//
// Another instance variable, ExtractEigenvalues, has been provided to
// control extraction of eigenvalues/eigenvectors. If this boolean is
// false, then eigenvalues/eigenvectors are not extracted, and the
// columns of the tensor are taken as the eigenvectors (the norm of
// column, always positive, is the eigenvalue).  This allows
// additional capability over the vtkGlyph3D object. That is, the
// glyph can be oriented in three directions instead of one.

Subject: [Paraview] Arbitrary Polyhedral
Message-ID: <0DB084BE537971419DC376EF0CD07840024786@glkms2122>


Hi,
 
Bet this has been covered/done to death, but I need to ask, sorry.  We
have a cut-cell code, our solver can handle, and has been able to for a
number of years, arbitrary polyhedral, i.e. cells with arbitrary numbers
of faces, and are not known cells types.  Recently we meshed something
where one of the cells had 108 faces defining it.  Now, whether this is
desirable is for another time, but can paraview read in meshes and
solution data which have arbitrary numbers of faces defining the cells??
If it can, what file format is recommended??
 
If not, then is this on the horizon (version III), or will it never be?
 
Apologies, I know this will cover old ground for most people,
 
Andy

Hi Milan,

We welcome contributions :-) However, I have to admit that, in the
past, there were times when I sucked at integrating them due to lack
of time. Tensor glyph sounds like a great addition. I would suggest
adding it to paraview 3. ParaView 3.2 would be the best candidate
since we are getting close to branching for ParaView 3.0.

Hi Berk,

thanks for the answer. OK, I will wait then for ParaView 3. When I
switch to it, I will resend the contribution.

I do understand that taking care of numerous small updates can be
sometimes as time consuming as creating them on your own ;-)

Cheers,
Milan.

I was looking at a 2D array of about 6000x6000 values and

after a minute the server printing the following then crashed:

It looks like PV was trying to send something big instead of 
multiple smaller pieces. Does it check for the maximum MPI

Hello,

You can read cells as VTK convex point sets (I have a Patch
for ParaView to read EnSight nfaced cells as such element types,
submitted a while ago to PV's bugtracker). This is quite
memory intensive: a test on a 500 000 polyhedral cell
mesh led to some 12 million internal tetrahdra for
ParaView 2.6, using some 2 Gb memory (not leaving enough
memory for subsequent operations on a 32bit Linux system),
while the same mesh handled much better under Ensight
(but even EnSight tends to be less stable using
meshes wih general polygons or polyhedra than with
regular meshes.

With smaller meshes, ParaView + patch works quite well,
though you may observe some "false" internal boundaries
between polyhedra and regular elements, which dissapear
when the mesh is tetrahedralized.

The most faces I have encountered in practice for polyhedra
is around 50, resulting from merging non-conforming meshes,
splitting faces along their intersections. Our code
is EDF's Code_Saturne CFD code (now under GPL).

I remember reading on this list that CD Adapco's Star-CCM uses
VTK as a base for their viewer (and use polyhedral meshes) but
that they keep their modifications to VTK for polyhedra to
themselves.

Subject: [Paraview] Scripts, keyframes, and stored camera positions
Message-ID: <0MKoyl-1HWMEa3flL-0007hV@mrelay.perfora.net>

I am trying to write a script that will save off a series of views of data
as .jpg files.

 

I tried a keyframe for this, and that would work very well, except for the
fact that it doesn't preserve the camera view when it saves the frames off.
Instead it zooms in so far that I can't see anything but a few very close
polygons.

 

So then I tried the stored camera positions.  And again, it lets me save the
orientations, but when I click on a camera position, it zooms in way too
far.  If the first thing I do after pressing one of the stored camera
positions is to scroll out, it does seem to have the objects in the proper
orientation.

 

Is there a way other than Alt-PrintScreen to get a view of the not just the
view pane of Paraview, but of the display pane for a selected object which
shows the translation, scale, orientation, origin, and opacity?

 

I read in this list how to access the currently selected object, but is
there a way to select the first item in the selection window, and then the
next item or second item?  

 

 

- Bonnie

You don't mention your version of PV or your OS so I am just 
guessing that you are using 2.6.0 on Linux.

There is a fix for the VRML reader in the CVS version of 
2.6.0 that was described a week or two on this list. It will 
be in the archives. With that I could read VRML with no errors.

I found that there is another bug where the reader ignores 
the "transform" command. Not all VRML files use that command 
and so that may not be important for you. It produced no 
error - just didn't do the transform.

Christophe--

I am not an expert on ParaView internals, but I have had similar 
troubles, particularly, on MS Windows O/S. (I have also had similar 
troubles on Linux.)  When your memory footprint exceeds 2GB, Windows 
will kill your job. Linux is likely more graceful and precludes memory 
requests when they go beyond a certain limit.

My work around is to only load the cell and nodal data that is essential 
for the display I want to animate, keep the number of isosurfaces to a 
minimum, and limit the complexity of the display. I know this is hard to 
do given what ParaView offers.

My data set for which this technique works is 850,000 tetrahedrons and a 
101 time steps in an EnSight binary-formatted file-set.

Hey folks,

I have a couple of simple questions about Lookup tables, I'm not  
really understanding to well from the documentation. BTW I'm directly  
constructing my VTK files in legacy binary format using Matlab.  
Anyway, say I specify 2 rgba values in my lookup table, does Paraview  
interpret this as end points of a range and interpolate my data  
values (int scalars in this case) between these endpoints? Also if I  
want, for example, all data with value 1 to be red, and all data with  
value 2 to be blue, how to I achieve this? I sense I'm not getting  
something extremely simple!

Thanks,

Craig

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView scripting tutorial
Message-ID: <45d654b0703290643h10cc8694p787c6fcaddce2fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

There has been several questions about the scripting interface of
ParaView in the past. Hopefully the following excerpt from a message
to a Kitware support customer will answer some of those questions:

--- begin quote

The Tcl scripting in ParaView is limited to the GUI objects. You
cannot access underlying VTK objects directly through Tcl scripting.
What you need to do is to get the Tcl object for the appropriate GUI
object. To do this, start with the application singleton. You can
access this object using the $Application variable. To read about the
full API of this class, look at the doxygen documentation for
vtkPVApplication and vtkKWApplication here:
http://www.paraview.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html

>From the application, you can get the main window with:
set mainWindow [$Application GetMainWindow]
(of class vtkPVWindow, inherits from vtkKWWindow)

You can also get the main view (the 3D view widget and associated
controls) with:
set mainView [$Application GetMainView]
(of class vtkPVRenderView, inherits from vtkKWView)

The main window stores pointers to all sources and filters. The GUI
elements for these objects are of type vtkPVSource. These are stored
in different groups. The group that stores the source and filters
created by the user is called Groups. You can get a collection of all
vtkPVSources in the group with:
set sourceList [$mainWindow GetSourceList Sources]

This returns an object of type vtkPVSourceCollection that inherits
from vtkCollection. You can get objects from it using
$sourceList GetNumberOfItems
$sourceList GetItemAsObject <index here>

GetItemAsObject will return a vtkPVSource. Once you have a
vtkPVSource, you can get to it's GUI object that controls the Display
tab with:
$pvSource GetPVOutput

This will return a vtkPVDisplayGUI. Look at the doxygen documentation
for vtkPVDisplayGUI to find the methods that control the actor.

You can also change the parameters of the source/filter using the
vtkPVSource object. Each property of the vtkPVSource object is
controlled by a vtkPVWidget. You can object the widget objects using
the GetPVWidget method:
$pvSource GetPVWidget <widget name>

The widget name needed for this method can be found by examining
Filters.xml in ParaView/GUI/Client/Resources in the ParaView source.
The name is determined by the trace_name attribute in the XML.

This is a just a short tutorial but should get you started. I will
also post this message to the ParaView mailing list so that other can
benefit from it.

-- end quote

Please note that this interface will become legacy once ParaView 3 is
release. ParaView 3 scripting API is completely different (and the
main scripting language is python although we can add tcl and java
support without too much effort in the future).

Batch scripts made in 2.4.4 contained a line like

===
set pvTemp114 [$proxyManager NewProxy animation

===

and then, near the bottom, a line like

===
$pvTemp4 WriteImage {pics.png} vtkPNGWriter

To instead create an animation the second line would be 
replaced with something like

===
$pvTemp114 SaveImages pics jpg 1920 1080 5 90
===

When I edit scripts from 2.6.0 in the same way many of the 
messages in the batch log file are the same but then there 
is an error:

===
Returned Error on line 409:
    Object named: vtkTemp115, could not find requested
    method: SaveImages
    or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
===

The only place "SaveImages" appears in the batch file is 
line 430. Did something change? Has anyone been able to make 
animations in batch with this version?

Hello,

I`m trying to plot .vtr data with ParaView.  Everytime i got the same  
error message, which i don`t understand.  There is a problem in  
myCellData part, the grid only doesnt deliver problems.

# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file:  
/home/amy/ParaViewReleaseRoot/ParaView-2.6.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkExecutive.cxx

  vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x904eda0): Algorithm

   Request: REQUEST_INFORMATION

   FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
ErrorMessage end

So I simplified my data artificially.  This is the file I`m trying to plot.
If anybody knows whats wrong, please let me know.

thanks in advance,
Peter

Are there any plans for adding a CGNS (CFD General Notation System)
file reader into paraview anytime soon?

Thanks,
Bruno

I too would like to know the answer, I saw this question at least  
twice but no answer.

Thanks,
Antoine.

vtkSMAnimationSceneProxy::SaveImages gained an argument from 
2.4.4 to 2.6.0 ("dont..."):

   int SaveImages(const char* fileRoot, const char* ext,
     int width, int height, double framerate, int quality,
     bool dont_update_write_framerate=false);

Things fail unless I add "0" to the end of the SaveImages 
call in the batch script.

I guess the default is lost during the conversion to TCL. Is 
this conversion documented? Even if one understands the C++ 
world I've found it difficult to do many things in the 
batch/TCL world.

Would such a document be irrelevant after the Big Update?

Message-ID: <FC452BBB53F2D24BA08F1FB64F68A5E08E2E40@exchange1.tacc.utexas.edu>

Hello,

I would like to use a logarithmic color scale for values of my dataset that range from 0 to 10^9.  Is there a way to this in Paraview?

Thank you,

Karla

Easiest way in ParaView 2.x is to compute the log of that variable in
the Calculator, and then map that... not great but works...

Subject: [Paraview] oil reservoir-type data?
Message-ID: <000001c773d2$b0910950$11b31bf0$@edu>

Just thought I'd take a shot at asking this list if anyone knows of
publicly-available oil reservoir-type datasets?  The closer I could think of
would be the Vis06 contest data - the southern CA earthquake sim data.

Thanks, Randy
