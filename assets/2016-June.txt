Subject: [Paraview] Calculater Bug or am I just with stupid?
Message-ID: <CAKrZ8yezLZx1X0q1OyyqHNGrUUcSNn=vui2A2pwE3=FGkHmVFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I have a problem I cannot figure out:

1 -> read in VTR file (Rectiliniear Grid)
2 -> apply "cell data to point data" filter
3 -> apply "calculator" on it, that selects only the Z component. Call
it "M_Z" (result array name).
4 -> apply "gradientofunstructureddataset" on the calc. with Scalar
Array set to "M_Z".

Works perfectly in the GUI.

Now I code it in a macro and I do it like that (after the celldatatopointdata):

# create a new 'Calculator'
Mz = Calculator(Input=cellDatatoPointData1)
Mz.ResultArrayName = 'M_Z'
Mz.Function = 'M_Z'
RenameSource('Mz', Mz)



# create a new 'Gradient Of Unstructured DataSet'
grad_Mz = GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet(Input=Mz)
grad_Mz.ScalarArray = ['POINTS', 'M_Z']
grad_Mz.ResultArrayName = 'grad_Mz'
RenameSource('grad_Mz', grad_Mz)

No matter what I do, I always get the wrong Scalar Array selected in
the GUI when I start the macro. When I then correct it in the GUI ->
works.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Richard

This system is still running 10.9 and is scheduled for a 10.11 upgrade in the near-term ? presumably the warning message will go away with 10.11 ??.

Richard,
   You will get this warning/error message on any OS X machine using ATI/AMD graphics hardware running OS X 10.10 or earlier. OS X 10.11 corrected an OpenGL driver issue that this error is reporting. It is down in the VTK stack. I do not know if we should be worried or not about the warning/error.

I have the following message from one of my local ParaView users:

Following is the message I am getting with the Paraview 5 client on the Mac. It appears to work in spite of this warning.

Warning: In /Users/kitware/buildbot-slave/paraview-bigmac-osx-shared-release_opengl2_osx10_7_qt4_superbuild/build/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper.cxx, line 2856
vtkCompositeMapperHelper (0x7fbc4b0e7800): VTK is working around a bug in Apple-AMD hardware related to gl_PrimitiveID.  This may cause significant memory and performance impacts. Your hardware has been identified as vendor ATI Technologies Inc. with renderer of ATI Radeon HD 5770 OpenGL Engine and version 4.1 ATI-1.24.39

About this Mac has the following information about my system:
Graphics  ATI Radeon HD 5770 1024 MB


The user does not see this error running ParaView 4.x.x ? so ? presumably this warning message is related to OpenGL2 running on an older graphics card???    Is this something we should be worried about in the short-term?  I?m not sure how much longer this older Mac will be in service ? but will we run in to issues with OpenGL2 which will preclude it from working on these older systems?

Not unless the upgrade includes a driver upgrade for the graphics
hardware to one of the white-listed graphics drivers. I know this
because my Mac with 10.11 complained, but it didn't exhibit the buggy
behavior, so I added it's hardware to the white list.

Ken, could we test for the Apple bug dynamically in VTK or in ParaView
in any easy way?

Thanks,
Cory

The code has been updated in VTK as of a month or two ago. But PV is using
an older version of the code. I doubt the new code would warn on your
system Cory, but until PV releases a new version (or build PV master) it
will continue to use the old code.

We definitely can dynamically test for it, that is basically what the
appleBug test does. To be safe with it I think on apple systems it would
cause a window to pop up briefly while it tests it. (offscreen might not
match onscreen)

Utkarsh,

If I subclass vtkSIProperty how do I register it so that it can be seen in the xml configuration file of my plugin ?

Andrzej,

Here's a possible approach:

Add a "information_only" property to the proxy to retrieve the values for  max_distance computed by the filter. You can create a custom SIProperty [1] subclass to support arbitrary API to get the values from your filter and communicate that to the SMProperty. Your widget that can explicitly monitor this property to update view of "current values" as appropriate.

What I am not sure if whether the information_property will get updates every time the filter re-executes, e.g. when time changes. If it doesn't, we may have to explicitly monitor the vtkCommand::UpdateDataEvent fired by the proxy and call
vtkSMProxy::UpdatePropertyInformation() explicitly.

For each contour (slice) we would like to compute a scalar value, say max distance between two points in the contour and output the values to the scalar list widget. Of course we also would like to modify the distances and send it back to the filters. These values will be used to update the output of the filter.

So, we are continuing to have issues with 5.0.1 and OpenGL2.      I have
recompiled the server-side to use OpenGL2, and it works fine if when I run
ParaView 5.0.1 from my Mac.     However, if I run ParaView 5.0.1 from my
Linux box,  I?m still getting failures.   Looks like 5.0.1 on my Linux box
(RHEL6) is also built with OpenGL2, but there are apparently additional
issues?????     Here?s some of the output from the error log on the SERVER
side.    What?s generating these GL_Version info messages?      I?m using
the same exact server-side job launching whether I?m running the client on
my Mac or Linux machine - so it would seem that maybe something?s wrong on
the Linux client?????

Utkarsh - thanks for info.    Recompiling the server-side with OpenGL2
resolved the problem!

The binaries distributed by paraview.org are indeed OpenGL2. The title
bar for ParaView 5.0.1 says "(Legacy Rendering Backend)" when using
"OpenGL". Given the error, I think your server is not built with
OpenGL2, despite your intention. Can you check your CMakeCache.txt on
the server build to confirm?

Rick,

Are you by any change using local rendering on your Mac and remote
rendering on your linux client box?

DOH!  The render threshold values were set differently on the Mac and
Linux systems.   As soon as I forced the Mac to use distributed rendering,
it failed with the same error messages.    So do we have a build issue on
the HPC-side?      We have rebuilt with OpenGL2 enabled, but it seems like
it?s not picking up the correct Mesa libs????    Presumably we?re using
the Superbuild and it should be building using the Mesa that?s part of the
Superbuild????

Is there an issue in the SuperBuild?   I just did a quick look through the
Superbuild source, and it looks like the file version.cmake is wanting to
use MesaLib-7.11.2 ?..

Already up-to-date.

Rick,

Are you by any change using local rendering on your Mac and remote
rendering on your linux client box?

Rick,

The superbuild isn't updated yet to build newer Mesa. Mesa now needs
LLVM etc and hence it's a little tricky. I believe Chuck is working on
getting that working. In the mean time, here's a docker file we use to
build mesa verions:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/mesa-builds/tree/master

That will show what options to use to build mesa appropriately.

Is any introduction available, how vtkSMServerManager, vtkSMSessions,
vtkProxies etc. are set up to interact with a pvserver or with a custom
server application?
I am not talking about short demos that show how to create and display a
sphere using pvpython. What I am looking for is a book chapter or similar
explaining the principles behind vtkSMSessions, vtkProcies etc.

Does anybody remember, which of the VTK or ITK or Paraview books included
such chapters?

+1 for that. I'm very interested to know if there's such book or document.

When I started developing a plug-in for ParaView I found this 
presentation 
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/a/a1/ParaViewVis08_CustomizingParaView.ppt> 
almost by accident. Maybe it can help you. Apparently it was used in a 
conference/workshop (VIS08?) to describe briefly the proxy system, and 
refers to the "Paraview Guide, Version 3, section 18.6, and chapter 19 
for details (see slide 30). Unfortunately the version 3 of the Guide I 
couldn't find.

So there is much more to be done than adding

-DPARAVIEW_RENDERING_BACKEND:STRING=OpenGL2
-DVTK_RENDERING_BACKEND:STRING="OpenGL2"



to the cmake flags?

Rick,

The superbuild isn't updated yet to build newer Mesa. Mesa now needs
LLVM etc and hence it's a little tricky. I believe Chuck is working on
getting that working. In the mean time, here's a docker file we use to
build mesa verions:

Caution-https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/mesa-builds/tree/master

That will show what options to use to build mesa appropriately.

As far as ParaView is concerned, no there's not much more to it.
However if your OpenGL implementation doesn't support OpenGL 3.2
(released in 2009), then alas there's more work to get ParaView
working which could include building a newer version of Mesa. Not sure
if you have seen this blog [1], but that talks about how I got Mesa to
build with appropriate OpenGL renderer enabled. Things have gotten a
little better since then and the Docker script encapsulates that. The
moral of the story is get latest Mesa version and build it with
LLVM/Gallum support.

Alas, there's nothing up-to-date. I've been meaning to write a blog
series covering various aspect of ParaView internals, but it's hard to
find some downtime to get that going. I'll try to see if I can find
the old PDF for the ParaView Guide v3 and share the old chapter
(although obsolete, but basic design may still be relevant). The
ParaView developers Wiki
(http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/index.php/Main_Page) has a few
articles that we wrote with coming up with the design for some of the
core components. The implementations generally differ slightly from
the design and may have names/APIs changed since, but nonetheless may
be helpful in understanding how things came about. Specifically,

Our current issues seem to be related to our osmesa build for the HPC_side
servers.       The Superbuild is building 7.11.2 - you are suggesting that
we need to *manually* build a different version of Mesa and somehow link
in that new version of Mesa in to the Superbuild?     We rely exclusively
on the Superbuild for compiling ParaView across 20 different HPC systems -
so stepping outside of the super build paradigm isn?t necessarily obvious
to me!    8-)

Message-ID: <VI1PR06MB1101B2781F5FA2D5494C79B9C7580@VI1PR06MB1101.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,


I running a fresh install of kubuntu 16.04 xenial xerus on a desktop computer with 2 x 14 cpu's. I've downloaded ParaView-5.0.1-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit binary release (from paraview.org), and I use the binaries in the "bin" subfolder.


When I run in client-server mode on the computer, i.e. using localhost and socket 11111, I experience "random" crashes of pvserver. I start servers like this:


mpirun.mpich -np 14 <path to>/ParaView-5.0.1-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering


Then in the client many things are working. However, when I use the Contour-filter after playing a few time step (from an ExodusII-file) a small pop-up appears saying "The server side has disconnected". In the terminal I can see different errors. Sometimes it says:

Bus error (signal 7)


other times is it something with:


Unsupported cell type


(I think it comes from void vtkGenericCell::SetCellType(int cellType) )


Does anybody know how to fix these issues? I would be really happy if someone knows a solution.


Christian

Ah okay. Give me a few days to sort it out. The end goal is indeed to
have superbuild build the right versions of Mesa. Do you only  care
about OSMesa or also Mesa with X support?

Subject: [Paraview] visualize traced particles
Message-ID: <1464881196894.57602@sth.kth.se>

Dear Paraview community,


in an external program, I've traced particles inside a 3D(+time) flow field and extracted each particles spatial position (x,y,z) in time.


I have this data saved in an ascii-output where each particle position (with time) is simply written out.


Now to my question: is there any convenient way of visualizing these pathlines in paraview? Can I load and look at that kind of data in a direct way? Or can you even visualize how the particle progresses in space over time?


Thanks for your help.


/David

Utkarsh - thanks - in the mean time, we're going to try to build Mesa 11.1 (?) outside of ParaView and link it in and see how far we can get!   8-)    But it would certainly be cleaner to use the Superbuild when you get that updated with the proper Mesa build!

Utkarsh,

I am running ParaView 5.0.1 connecting to a remote ParaView 5.0.1 server built with osmesa

And I have rebuild osmesa from both
Mesa 11.1.2 and Mesa 11.2.2 using

./configure \
    --disable-xvmc \
    --disable-glx \
    --disable-dri \
    --with-dri-drivers= \
    --with-gallium-drivers=swrast \
    --enable-texture-float \
    --disable-egl \
    --enable-shared \
    --with-egl-platforms= \
    --enable-gallium-osmesa \
    --enable-gallium-llvm=yes \
    --prefix=<install prefix>

And I have tried replacing the library

lib/paraview-5.0/libOSMesa.so.7

and they are both still giving the same error

paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx line 587 vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow GL Version 2.1 with the gpu_shader4 extension is not supported by your graphics driver, but is required for the new OpenGL rendering  backend. Please update your OpenGL driver.
If you are using Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.5 and make sure your  driver support OpenGL 3.2

Any suggestions?

Utkarsh - thanks - in the mean time, we're going to try to build Mesa 11.1 (?) outside of ParaView and link it in and see how far we can get!   8-)    But it would certainly be cleaner to use the Superbuild when you get that updated with the proper Mesa build!

Utkarsh,

I was wondering how to hack the superbuild for ParaView to use my newly built versions of osmesa

Swapping out the shared libraries does not seem to work, so perhaps a static link is occurring somewhere in the build process of ParaView If I just drop in my newly built version of osmesa in the superbuild build directory, replacing the current version of osmesa and then delete the source, build and install versions of ParaView in the superbuild directory forcing a recompile of all of ParaView 5.0.1 proper, would you expect that to work? Or am I missing something?

The version of libOSMesa in the superbuild is libOSMesa.so.7 while the new versions I am building are libOSMesa.so.8, I made symbolic link with libOSMesa.so.7 -> LibOSMesa.so.8 Which paraview seems to find but still produces the same error complaining of GL Version 2.1

Thanks,

Joe

Utkarsh,

I am running ParaView 5.0.1 connecting to a remote ParaView 5.0.1 server built with osmesa

And I have rebuild osmesa from both
Mesa 11.1.2 and Mesa 11.2.2 using

./configure \
    --disable-xvmc \
    --disable-glx \
    --disable-dri \
    --with-dri-drivers= \
    --with-gallium-drivers=swrast \
    --enable-texture-float \
    --disable-egl \
    --enable-shared \
    --with-egl-platforms= \
    --enable-gallium-osmesa \
    --enable-gallium-llvm=yes \
    --prefix=<install prefix>

And I have tried replacing the library

lib/paraview-5.0/libOSMesa.so.7

with both libOSMesa.so from 11.1.2 and 11.2.2

and they are both still giving the same error

paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx line 587 vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow GL Version 2.1 with the gpu_shader4 extension is not supported by your graphics driver, but is required for the new OpenGL rendering  backend. Please update your OpenGL driver.
If you are using Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.5 and make sure your  driver support OpenGL 3.2

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Simply swapping the libraries won't work. Mesa 11.2 [1] added new API
OSMesaCreateContextAttribs() which is needed to create correct OpenGL
context.  The API is used at compile time if appropriate osmesa.h is
being used.

You can try to update Projects/unix/osmesa.cmake in the superbuild
source to use the configure arguments you used, and also change
versions.cmake in the same repo to point to change the osmesa source
tar ball to be 11.2. Now the superbuid will build 11.2 instead and it
should then have the new API available.

No, you don't need to recompile ParaView.

Dear Utkarsh,
if those topics have been available in the Paraview Guide v3 and removed in
the new guide, this would explain why I couldn't find the explanations in
any of the recent editions although I went through them several times to
check.

You would do me (and many others) a huge favor if you could share the
missing chapter even if the details are outdated with respect to the newest
Paraview software version.

Thank you
Peter

Would it be sufficient to change the cmake flags OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR and
OSMESA_LIBRARY in CMakeCache file to point to the external build of Mesa
11.x.x?

Simply swapping the libraries won't work. Mesa 11.2 [1] added new API
OSMesaCreateContextAttribs() which is needed to create correct OpenGL
context.  The API is used at compile time if appropriate osmesa.h is
being used.

You can try to update Projects/unix/osmesa.cmake in the superbuild
source to use the configure arguments you used, and also change
versions.cmake in the same repo to point to change the osmesa source
tar ball to be 11.2. Now the superbuid will build 11.2 instead and it
should then have the new API available.

Pretty much (and setting a few other vars to empty including
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY etc, see the arguments to add_extra_cmake_args()
call in https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/blob/master/Projects/unix/osmesa.cmake)

Note, you need 11.2 or newer for the correct OSMesa API. Otherwise you
can use the attached patch to patch 11.1 or older.

Those are errors reported when paraVIew cannot connect to the Xserver.
Try any other tool that needs X, e.g. gvim, glxgears, all will fail
the same way. See this:

Subject: [Paraview] antialiasing in export scene, vector graphics,
	font selection
Message-ID: <CAJ7aB-JBeLg0R0TW2rsYGZWc9qCvq_h9NQtTUShG=Jv-9YrGmQ@mail.gmail.com>

New here after ditching tecplot, I've run into a few questions in trying to
get publication-quality (for LaTeX) graphic exports:


1) Assuming "export scene" is the preferred way to output images, how do I
get anti-aliasing of the produced image? I see no option for it. Failing
that -- if I choose to not rasterize the image, I'm losing some color
information whereas the save screenshot function correctly outputs the
color (see attached figures).

2) In the color legend font properties, only Arial, Courier, and Times are
available. Is there a way to use some other font from my system?

Any other tips/references on getting high quality exports would be greatly
appreciated.

Really nice topics to discuss, Mark. I have the same questions about image
anti-aliasing and font selection features that are missing (or maybe I
don't know how to reach them).

Hope to have some light shed on this issue. Thank you!

Message-ID: <CAMGPr0Ua9hfxqcGsdqZ=d2+4kX=a1bthb0_bRQNtcR0T_huxNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Is there a way to use python VTK functions and classes in paraview?  I'm
using paraview through paraviewweb and I've created an RPC that I can call
from the client to run paraview python code:

@exportRpc("my.test.rpc")
    def myTestRPCFunction(self):
        return 0

I would like to create, inside this RPC, a plane with a texture applied.
Searching the mailing list I found this thread,

https://cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-April/020848.html

were someone's trying to accomplish this from a reader written in C++, but
I would really like to do something like that inside my RPC, is that
possible?

Thank you!
Rodrigo

The raster-format exports tend to just grab the image directly from the
OpenGL framebuffer, but unfortunately anti-aliased rendering is not
currently enabled in ParaView as it interferes with some of the other
rendering passes. There is some work-in-progress on adding DPI options to
paraview exports that will help with this issue in a future release.

I'm not sure what's going on with the color in the vector export. The GL2PS
library used to generate the vector graphics files is somewhat fickle with
some coloring methods, you may be able to play with the rendering settings
to get that to come out right. I know that, for instance, the "Interpolate
Colors Before Mapping" option will often cause issues.

Right now your best bet for getting an anti-aliased export from ParaView is
to emulate SSAA by making a screenshot with a custom resolution. By setting
the resolution in File > Save Screenshot to a larger resolution than your
desired image size and then shrinking the image externally you should get a
smoother result.

This is currently not possible in ParaView. There is support for custom
fonts in VTK (the library that drives ParaView's rendering), but it has not
been exposed in ParaView.

Hope this helps,
Dave

Utkarsh,

I have rebuilt osmesa using mesa 11.2.2 but
it ParaView rebuilt with the new version is giving
me the same error as before, complaining that the
GL version 2.1 with gpu_shader4 extension is not
Supported.

I think I know  why  this is occurring and I wondered if you
could confirm this for me.

I configured mesa with these parameters

./configure \
    --disable-xvmc \
    --disable-glx \
    --disable-dri \
    --with-dri-drivers= \
    --with-gallium-drivers=swrast \
    --enable-texture-float \
    --disable-egl \
    --with-egl-platforms= \
    --enable-gallium-osmesa \
    --enable-gallium-llvm=yes \
    --prefix=<install prefix>

but, I did not have a version of llvm available
and the configure script then set

Llvm = no

>From my reading of this webpage

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

It seems that without gallium-llvm,
the version of OpenGL built reverts to an older version,
which I believe is why I am still getting the error.

Would you agree with this?

Thanks,

Joe

Dear Utkarsh,
thank you for your offer to search the old ParaView Guide v3 client-server
programming chapter. May I ask whether your search has been successful?
Even a scan of the pages from the relevant chapter would be nice, if you
are authorized to share it.

I have read all your links, and they are great to get an idea about the
changes that are going on. However, I would need a well structured
book-chapter which builds the story from the basic requirements to a full,
simple application. The information in the links is so spread that
everything seems to depend on everything else, and nowhere is it clear what
are ideas for the future, what is under current development, and what has
been deprecated again.
I would really like to read again the chapter from ParaView Guide v3, which
I remember gave me perfect insight into Paraview years ago. Even if it is
rather out of date, it would give me a solid basis to better understand the
current developments.

Peter

Here's a MR for update superbuild that builds OSMesa 11.2.2. I've only
updated OSMesa. I'll tackle mesa-glx next.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkSMCollaborationManager::FollowUser(id) doesn't update
	view
Message-ID: <CAAUk9C4oh6fOkvh_yfaaXD4x6yoXe+--YiWfHL62oBmg-k3UQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have attached a short custom client example which I would like to always
show the same perspective as a ParaView session connected to the same
pvserver.

However, although this example renders once the objects that are available
in the ParaView session, it does not update itself when the camera is
changed in ParaView, despite of the line
"collaboration->FollowUser(collaboration->GetMasterId());" (see attached
code).

Apparently I am missing one important step, maybe register the view with
some proxymanager, call some *::AddObserver(...) or something similar? I
don't know and couldn't find out after several attempts to understand
ParaView with the help of a debugger.

As a side note: collaboration in the other direction runs successfully. If
I choose ParaView to follow this custom client by double-clicking on the
eye symbol in the collaboration panel, then the ParaView view always
displays the same perspective as the custom client.

Which are the missing steps to have the client update its view, when the
(master) ParaView camera changes?

Steps to reproduce:
+ compile attached main.cxx
+ run "pvserver --multi-clients &"
+ run "paraview --server-url=cs://localhost:11111 &"
+ create a simple pipeline in paraview
+ run "./main" -> same pipeline as in paraview is rendered in custom client
+ interact with view in ParaView -> client view does not update although it
is expected to follow the master

See pqServer::processServerNotification() [1]. You'll need to call
vtkNetworkAccessManager::ProcessEvents(..) "on idle" to process events
being received from the other client.

Here's a MR for update superbuild that builds OSMesa 11.2.2. I've only
updated OSMesa. I'll tackle mesa-glx next.

That's not the case. It should be compatible, so long are you're
building 5.0.1 on the server side too.

I used the same job launching scripts that I use for all of the previous
versions, including the broken attempts at 5.0.1 OSMesa builds  which were
able to connect and launch (and eventually fail).

We did indeed build 5.0.1 (with your updates) and the connect_id is the
same on both ends ?..

Thanks for the reply, but vtkNetworkAccessManager::ProcessEvents() is
already called in the attached example every 100ms repeatedly until it
returns false.
See my code at Callback::Execute(). The Timer Callback is started towards
the end of main.cxx, where it says "Callback *timer=Callback::New();" and
the following lines.

If you run the example as described, you'll see that actually a number of
messages are processed (their number is being logged). But I don't know how
I can print the content of the received vtkSMMessages for debugging
purposes. And I don't know what else to do so that the custom client's
camera will be affected.

Can you attach your CMakeCache.txt please? Also, try this:

On server side:
./pvserver --version

On client side:
./paraview --version

What do they say?

Michal,

Maybe I did not correctly understand your question but if you want to
access point coordinates in the Calculator, they are available through the
(pseudo) scalar variables coordsX, coordsY and coordsZ - you will find them
in the Scalars list button.

If the slice stays fixed relative to the bounding box of the moving object,
try a python calculator to calculate the normalized local coordinates, than
apply isocontour on them.

In theory, you can do this using a Python animation cue too... let me
see how that can be put together.

State file attached. It uses can.ex2.

The crux is in the Python Animation Cue script:

def start_cue(self): pass

def tick(self):
  ts = self.GetClockTime()
  from paraview import simple as pvs
  clip = pvs.FindSource("Clip1")
  ip = clip.Input
  ip.UpdatePipeline(ts)
  bds = ip.GetDataInformation().GetBounds()
  center = [ (bds[0] + bds[1]) / 2.0,
             (bds[2] + bds[3]) / 2.0,
             (bds[4] + bds[5]) / 2.0 ]
  clip.ClipType.Origin = center

def end_cue(self): pass

David,

Sure, this is possible. To view pathlines, you'll need to either write
a kind of file reader, probably a python Programmable Source, or
convert your file into a format ParaView can read, such as an XML
polydata file. The pathlines can be stored as vtkPolyLine cells in a
vtkPolyData.

If you just want to view the particles, you can likely read the file
directly using the CSV reader. Assuming your data is in the format

x y z t

the file will be read as a table. You'll need to convert the table to
points using the Table to Points filter. Choose the X, Y, and Z
columns for your data. The time column will be added as a variable
associated with the point.

HTH,
Cory

Hi, 
I found out how  to get my coordinates. I used a programmable filter to get my inputs and calculate the mean. I would like to be able to add that value to the properties that appear when you use the manager link (mode : property link). 
My objective is to be able to link my custom property which will show my mean result to a different filter ( slide for eg). So that I could link Clip->Plane->Origin  to ProgrammableFIlter->CustomValue
Is this possible ?

Dear Utkarsh,
may I ask you to check again, which step is missing for following another
user's view using collaboration? It is definitely not the missing
ProcessEvents call. This problem is a real show-stopper for my batch
visualization system.

Unfortunately this is documented nowhere, and the comments in the header
files are not sufficient for me to reproduce how the event observation
mechanism is set up in ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] use pv-meshless
Message-ID: <CANO2j4Pmi=MLAp0nMi9XBUwcouvCSJ2y8keEbtAeHnNcZZwrJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am looking for a possible way to render simulation results by SPH (a
Lagrange method). To to be more specifically, I want to project SPH results
onto a pre-defined regular mesh. It seems that one plugin of paraview ---
pv-meshless support such functionality. So
1) What kind of data storage format does pv-meshless support, does it
support h5part?
2) Is there any detailed documentation about how to install and use
pv-meshless?

Best!

My advice is that you use the new features of ParaView master branch.

it includes new SPH interpolators under the Category "Filters->Point Interpolation". You have the choice to sample you rPSH points onto a high resolution 1D line, a 2D cutting plane, or a 3D volume.

Thank you Jean,
Sounds like it is exactly the feature I was looking for,
When you talk about master branch, are you mean the master branch of
paraview on github?
As I was using binary version of paraview, I am not sure where is the best
source to get the most recent stable release of paraview. Could you give me
any recommendation?

Best!

Message-ID: <CA+c1-+_vAFaHPwmpcY3z8wPciHQ8CiV8+ek9iEDy3XEEw1v-rw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear users,

I would like to use PyQt4 with Paraview. I have installed Paraview from
pre-compiled binaries. When I am using pvpython, I cannot use PyQt4 since
this is not installed. Is there any chance that I could install PyQt4 with
pvpython? Otherwise, does any of you know how to configure Paraview's
python version to that of my Anaconda?

Thanks a lot, Giorgino.

Subject: [Paraview] Questions to stream tracer
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E050F48DFB9@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I want to visualize an electric field (calculated with Elmer). The data are in a vtu file. When I use the Stream Tracer filter to visualize the field, the stream lines extend well beyond the simulated region. Is there a way to make them end at the border of the simulated region? Since they do not have the same length, I cannot use the settings for maximum length or maximum number of steps to control that.
Another question: can I use a complex line as seed? If I integrate in both directions, I get artifacts, I think due to the fact that the field is zero in a part of the simulated region.

Thanks for helpful hints and/or a pointer to documentation (didn't find the answer in the help).

Matthias

Hi!

Can't run anything from bin:

$ ./paraview
ParaView-5.1.0-RC1-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-5.1/paraview: 
error while loading shared libraries: libmpich.so.3: cannot open shared 
object file: No such file or directory

I have libmpich.so in the system (Debian testing), so I symlinked to it, 
but it didn't help -- after a series of new symlinks:
1. libmpich.so.3 -> libmpich.so
2. libopa.so.1 -> libopa.so
3. libmpl.so.1 -> libmpl.so
4. ??? -> libembree.so.2

I stopped at last step because can't find any package with libembree...

Roger that. I've getting a new build. I switched to using a new build
machine -- looks like that was premature. I'll upload binaries from
the old build machine once they are available.

That did the trick, thank you very much! I would have never found the
problem.

One more question out of curiosity: isn't it quite ineffient, if clients
continuously invoke vtkNetworkAccessManager::ProcessEvents?()? For smooth
interaction this has to happen at least 10 times per second, which causes a
lot of network traffic by polling the server again and again,  especially
if more than one client connects to the same server.
Isn't it possible to react on incoming server events by registering a
callback that does the same server event processing only when a new event
has occurred? I mean, all of VTK and ParaView is event based, why not the
server message processing?

ProcessEvents() doesn't poll the server. It only "select"s on the
socket to see if the server sent any new messages to the client.

Subject: [Paraview] Loading xdmf files fails in Paraview
Message-ID: <CA+pdR5gyc=98JMOirXkEF0_f8oR3QHY3DNhr8Qr3iJWZJKvumw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use Paraview with xdmf files which I've generated in a python
script (both the xml light data and the hdf5 heavy data). Initially I was
working with Paraview-4.0.1 which I could install from apt and loaded the
data fine. Recently I downloaded Paraview-5.0.1, which fails to load the
xdmf file in a variety of ways. If I try to load the dataset with the Xdmf3
Reader, I get the following error:

    'Content' not found in itemProperties in XdmfArray::populateItem
    Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
    exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
    reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'XdmfError'
      what():  'Content' not found in itemProperties in
XdmfArray::populateItem
    Aborted (core dumped)

If I try to load with the Xdmf Reader, Paraview segfaults. I found the same
set of problems with Paraview-4.4.1.

How do I correct the lack of content in the xdmfarry? What does that even
mean? (I don't recall there being a content tag necessary in the xdmf
specification). I can post the xml and hdf5 files if necessary.

I would file a bug, but the bug tracker isn't accepting new users at the
moment.

thanks

Content in Xdmf's context is the data that XdmfArray contains. In XML this is the data between the XML tags.

For the Array:
<DataItem DataType="Int" Dimensions="2" Format="HDF" Precision="4">output.h5:Data6</DataItem>

The "Content" is "output.h5:Data6" which is then parsed into an HDF5 reference.

The term "Content" is a carryover from the XML parser that Xdmf uses.

Ok, that doesn't sound as bad as I expected. But still, is it necessary to
"poll" the socket, checking its "select" method?
I am not familiar with the details of socket communication, but I expect it
should be possible that the socket invokes some callback when a message
arrives? Or does some of the VTK design contradict such socket callbacks?

I found that it is always problematic performance-wise if more than a few
timers are running on one cpu.

Looks like your linux distribution's libc++ is too old for the binary.

What linux distribution are you on?

Hi,

I am trying to install a plugin to paraview called parastro :

https://github.com/corbett/parastro

when I ccmake it  I am getting an error of :

 CMake Error at /usr/lib/cmake/paraview/ParaViewTargets.cmake:1498
(message):
   The imported target "ProcessShader" references the file

      "/usr/bin/vtkProcessShader"

   but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:

   * The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

   * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

   * The installation package was faulty and contained

      "/usr/lib/cmake/paraview/ParaViewTargets.cmake"

   but not all the files it references.

 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   /usr/lib/cmake/paraview/ParaViewConfig.cmake:36 (include)
   CMakeLists.txt:6 (FIND_PACKAGE)

I already have installed paraview-dev and libvtk5-dev packages but still
the error persists . I am using a 32 bit machine with linux-mint .

Please help,

Thanks in advance.

Hi Cory,

thanks for the helpful info.

As an initial test step, I loaded the traced particles as a csv table and converted the spatial coordinates to data points (as you suggested). I can then see time as a variable in the scroll list gui, also enabling me to see different time points as different colors (i.e. with differently annoted values), as seen in the attachment.

What I would like to is to select a given time points and see where my particles are at that time. I thought that would be easily achievable with a "Threshold" filter, but even though I can see that the time data range spans (in this case) [0.478, 0.522], whenever I threshold within that time (e.g. [min, max]: [0.478, 0.5]) all my particles disappear. Do you know why that is? Or is there another way I could do to select a specified time step?

I've also added the actual csv-file if that helps.

Thansk for all suggestions,

/David

David,

Sure, this is possible. To view pathlines, you'll need to either write
a kind of file reader, probably a python Programmable Source, or
convert your file into a format ParaView can read, such as an XML
polydata file. The pathlines can be stored as vtkPolyLine cells in a
vtkPolyData.

If you just want to view the particles, you can likely read the file
directly using the CSV reader. Assuming your data is in the format

x y z t

the file will be read as a table. You'll need to convert the table to
points using the Table to Points filter. Choose the X, Y, and Z
columns for your data. The time column will be added as a variable
associated with the point.

David,

It is subtle, but the reason is that the Threshold filter works only
on data with cells, not directly on points. The typical solution is to
apply the Glyph filter, then the Threshold filter.

There really should be a Threshold Points filter in ParaView because
this comes up time and time again.

Thanks,
Cory

Right. Good to know. Using your work-around method seem to work.

Subject: [Paraview] Forcing update on view
Message-ID: <5DF928D22AC3AC4B964903E98F2E54515B59F2DA@sooty3.win.ara>

Hi, 

I have a snippet code which I wrote to allow me to save multiple plot images to files. I do it by changing property checkboxes of Composite Data Set Index property. I can change their status programmatically but the view is not being updated. When I change them manually in the UI the view knows about their status change and plots only the content I select. I tried to force the update with UpdateVTkObjects() of available properties plus explicitly calling render()/forceRender() of the view but with no success.  Every file I create has multiple plot curves in it instead of one.

Andrzej

	pqDataRepresentation *repr = source->getRepresentation( view );
	auto chartRepresentationProxy = repr->getProxy();
	vtkSMPropertyHelper helper( repr->getProxy(), "CompositeDataSetIndex" );

	vtkSMProperty *property = chartRepresentationProxy->GetProperty( "CompositeDataSetIndex" );
	if ( property ) {

		auto VectorProperty = vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast( property );
		if ( VectorProperty ) {

			const auto numElements = VectorProperty->GetNumberOfElements();
			int elements[ numElements ];
			std::copy( VectorProperty->GetElements(), VectorProperty->GetElements() + numElements, elements );
			for ( auto i = 0 ; i != numElements ; ++i ) {
				VectorProperty->SetElement( elements[ i ], 0 );
			}

			for ( auto i = 0 ; i != numElements ; ++i ) {
				VectorProperty->SetElement( elements[ i ], 1 );

				source->getSourceProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				view->getViewProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				view->getViewProxy()->Update();
				repr = source->getRepresentation( view );
				repr->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				repr->renderView( true );
				property->GetParent()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				view->cancelPendingRenders();
				view->forceRender();

				std::stringstream ssFileName;
				std::string ext , newName2;
				std::string::size_type dot_pos = newName.rfind( '.' );
				if ( dot_pos != std::string::npos ) {
					ext = newName.substr( dot_pos );
					newName2 = newName.substr( 0, dot_pos );
				}
				ssFileName << newName2 << "_" << i + 1 << ext;
				view->writeImage( ssFileName.str().c_str(), size, quality );
				VectorProperty->SetElement( elements[ i ], 0 );
			}

			VectorProperty->SetElements( elements );
		}
	}

Hi Richard,

This is slightly off-topic, but I have been using a similar approach
(tikz/tex + png images) to include plots from python/matplotlib in my
LaTeX documents. For this I can just recommend the matplotlib2tikz
package [1].

Using VTK/ParaView, I have had some attempts to set the render window
size and camera in python scripts, but could not yet figure out how
to extract the information on the data/viewport extend.


> a) Did anyone encounter the same issue and is willing to share a

My VTK and ParaView scripts are based on information I gathered from two
mailing list discussions, see [2,3]. My scripts are probably not much of
help, but I can dig them out if you are interested.


> b) If not, is there a way to extract the Viewport extent in a python

That's the missing piece in the puzzle I couldn't quite figure out yet,
but I would also be interested in this. The code in discussion [2] has
some examples on coordinate transforms in VTK, but I didn't have the
time to look deeper into this.


Cheers,
Armin

It turned out that the operating system on my machine does not have the
library: GLIBCXX_3.4.15. And the linux system on my machine does not allow
me upgrading the library to GLIBCXX_3.4.15.
Is there any other way that I can still use the new version of paraview
without GLIBCXX_3.4.15? I only want to use the SPH interpolation feature of
the new paraview.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] display boundaries of 2D geometry
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E050F48E2CA@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

is there a way to display the boundaries (edges) of a 2D geometry? I have converted my mesh to vtu using Elmergrid, so I have the IDs of bodies (=surfaces in 2D) and boundaries (edges) in a vtu file. Can I just display the edges having the same ID? The extract edges filter does not help.  What else could I try?

Thank you for a helpful hint,

Matthias

Matthias,

I'm not sure I fully understand exactly what you are trying to do, but
I will try to make a suggestion anyway. If the edges have a cell data
array giving the ID, you should be able to use the Threshold filter to
extract the edges associated with a particular body ID. Just set the
threshold values to the ID you want to see.

Hope that helps,
Cory

I missed the question regarding the problem I describe. Is there a way to programmatically display the content of CompositeDataSetIndex property depending on status of the checkbox widgets I change through vector properties? 

Andrzej

Hi, 

I have a snippet code which I wrote to allow me to save multiple plot images to files. I do it by changing property checkboxes of Composite Data Set Index property. I can change their status programmatically but the view is not being updated. When I change them manually in the UI the view knows about their status change and plots only the content I select. I tried to force the update with UpdateVTkObjects() of available properties plus explicitly calling render()/forceRender() of the view but with no success.  Every file I create has multiple plot curves in it instead of one.

Andrzej

	pqDataRepresentation *repr = source->getRepresentation( view );
	auto chartRepresentationProxy = repr->getProxy();

	vtkSMProperty *property = chartRepresentationProxy->GetProperty( "CompositeDataSetIndex" );
	if ( property ) {

		auto VectorProperty = vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast( property );
		if ( VectorProperty ) {

			const auto numElements = VectorProperty->GetNumberOfElements();
			int elements[ numElements ];
			std::copy( VectorProperty->GetElements(), VectorProperty->GetElements() + numElements, elements );
			for ( auto i = 0 ; i != numElements ; ++i ) {
				VectorProperty->SetElement( elements[ i ], 0 );
			}

			for ( auto i = 0 ; i != numElements ; ++i ) {
				VectorProperty->SetElement( elements[ i ], 1 );

				source->getSourceProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				view->getViewProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				view->getViewProxy()->Update();
				repr = source->getRepresentation( view );
				repr->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				repr->renderView( true );
				property->GetParent()->UpdateVTKObjects();
				view->cancelPendingRenders();
				view->forceRender();

				std::stringstream ssFileName;
				std::string ext , newName2;
				std::string::size_type dot_pos = newName.rfind( '.' );
				if ( dot_pos != std::string::npos ) {
					ext = newName.substr( dot_pos );
					newName2 = newName.substr( 0, dot_pos );
				}
				ssFileName << newName2 << "_" << i + 1 << ext;
				view->writeImage( ssFileName.str().c_str(), size, quality );
				VectorProperty->SetElement( elements[ i ], 0 );
			}

			VectorProperty->SetElements( elements );
		}
	}

Hi Cory,

this helped indeed, thank you.
I  load the mesh.vtu file and apply the Threshold filter on the GeometryID, and display that together with my simulation results. That works fine.
If I want to display several parts selectively, I can use several Thresholds, which is a bit clumsy.
It would be nice to be able to get a list of all GeometryIDs, and to check those which I want displayed. Do you know if there is a way to do that? Or on a more general basis: are there other, more elegant ways to display a geometry in ParaView?

Thanks again,

Matthias

Hi Michele and Ken,

I'm also dealing with dataset that contain polyhedral cells. More
precisely my grids are generated using a "cutcell" approach where an
initially fully hexahedral mesh is refined in the main region of
interest. While most cells will be again hexahedral after the
refinement, the cells on the coarse side of the interface are of general
polyhderal shape. I assume Michele has a very similar approach, though
my data stem from CFD simulation using OpenFOAM.

The OpenFOAM reader in ParaView has an option to decompose polyhedral
cells into standard shapes (mostly pyramids in my case). For instance,
my original dataset has about 10.9M hexahedral and 147k polyhedral
cells. When reading the dataset in ParaView and decomposing the
polyhedral cells, I get in total 12.7M cells, i.e. approximately 1.7M
more than in the original dataset due to the decomposition.
Applying the tetrahedralize filter to the original dataset leads to
67.4M cells and the memory usage more than doubles. (The numbers are
listed below.)

I also experience a slowdown when I do not decompose the polyhedral
cells for the usual post-processing/visualization tasks.
However, I should note that for instance volume rendering of my dataset
with decomposed polyhedral cells is still painfully slow using ParaView
5.0.1 on my laptop (Intel i7-4800MQ 2.70GHz/ NVIDIA Quadro K2100M).
ParaView appears to spend the most of the time with something called
"OpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper".

I'm not sure which readers, other than the OpenFOAM reader, support the
decomposition of polyhedral cells, but the approach should work for any
unstructured dataset. So it might be worth considering to implement this
on a more general level, rather than in a specific reader.

Best regards,
Armin

Hi Matthais,

People typically use multi-block data sets for this purpose. ParaView
has a multi-block inspector that enables you change the visibility of
the blocks in a data set. If you make each surface a block, then you
can show/hide each at will.

HTH,
Cory

Matthias,

An approach that works well for me is to exploit the "Part" feature in 
either the VTK-formats or the EnSight format.

The "Part" construct in the VTK XML-format looks to me to have 
originated based on the need to combine for ParaView a set of results 
generated from individual CPU's. It can also be used for an assembly of 
parts. In my case, material domains are used to define the "Parts." The 
PV Extract Block filter displays the user's part names and can be used 
to display any combination of "Parts."

Again in my case, it is important to know that point-sets, and element 
edge-sets  and face-sets at time(0.0) are properly defined. At 
time(0.0), a mesh-by-material, point-sets, edge-sets, and face-sets (aka 
side-sets) are generated, all based on the "Part" construct, for the 
express purpose of visualizing these in ParaView before a simulation is run.

The key to doing this is to understand that each "Part" needs to be a 
complete, standalone, displayable graphics object.

Should you or your staff be interested in exploring this approach, a set 
of FORTRAN language routines can be provided.

Hi Cory,

thank you for the hint.
However, I don't know how to make a mesh generated by Salom? a multi-block dataset. Could you tell me more or give me a pointer on where I can find that out?

Thanks,

Matthias

Alas, I don't know much about Salom?. If no one here replies, you
might have better luck on the Salom? forum:

Chathuri,

I'm not really sure what you mean by adding slice thickness. Slices
are always infinitesimally thin planes in ParaView.

Do you mean setting the spacing between image slices? If so, you
should be able to do that with the Transform filter, which lets you
specify a different scale in X, Y, and Z. I am assuming your slices
are read in with spacing of 1 x 1 x 1 (no units specified). You should
be able to scale to whatever units you wish to use with your knowledge
of both the X and Y spacing in each slice and the Z spacing between
slices.

HTH,
Cory

This is a "symbol version". It basically means that your libstdc++ is
too old for the build we created. What Linux distribution and version
are you using?

Thank you so much for your response Cory.
Well, you're correct, i am referring to the spacing.
When i use the Transform Filter (units in mm) and apply it to the model,
the Paraview crashes (Paraview stops working and close the program by
itself). Do you know what could be the error?
What am i doing wrong here? I am clueless..
Your suggestions are welcome.
Thank you .

I am not sure I follow what you're doing, but here are a few things to note.

1. vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects() is called to push changes done to a
property. Thus, only needs to be called on the proxy whose properties
you're changing. Thus, if you are chaning "CompositeDataSetIIndex"
property on the chartRepresentationProxy, you only need to call
UpdateVTKObjects() on it.
2. pqView::forceRender() cancels pending renders, so you don't have to
do that explicitly.
3. When CompositeDataSetIndex property is changed and successfully
pushed, vtkChartRepresentation::AddCompositeDataSetIndex() should be
called. Try putting a breakpoint there to ensure it's getting called
when you're expecting it to happen.

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

I can change their status programmatically but the view is not being updated. When I change them manually in the UI the view knows about their status change and plots only the content I select. I tried to force the update with UpdateVTkObjects() of available properties plus explicitly calling render()/forceRender() of the view but with no success.  Every file I create has multiple plot curves in it instead of one.

Yes, you just need to import the appropriate module in python.
e.g.

 @exportRpc("my.test.rpc")
    def myTestRPCFunction(self):

        from paraview.vtk.vtkIOImage import vtkImageReader2Factory
        reader = vtkImageReader2Factory.CreateImageReader(filename)

        from paraview.vtk.vtkFiltersTexture import vtkTextureMapToPlane
        texturePlane.SetInputConnection(reader.GetOutputPort())

        ....

        return 0

Hello,

When running ParaViewWeb on a Mac, a pvpython window entitled
'Visualization Toolkit - Cocoa #1' pops up on start-up. This window
displays the exact same output as the Visualizer in the browser, but there
is no way to interact with it directly.  If I quit out of this window, the
entire application fails. I am wondering what launches this window, and why
is it necessary? Is there any way to launch ParaViewWeb without having this
extra window pop up?

Thanks,
Vince

Hi Vince,

This is expected.  Essentially ParaViewWeb allows you to remotely view the
ParaView output with your browser.  If you launched the Visualizer without
pointing a browser at it and then went to another computer and pointed a
browser at the first computer, you would see the ParaViewWeb output.  The
window would still pop up on the computer running ParaViewWeb.  Essentially
the problem is that ParaView needs an OpenGL context to do its rendering
and on most operating systems this requires a window.  So it creates a
window to get the OpenGL context and uses onscreen OpenGL.

You can change it to use offscreen rendering by finding where it creates
its render view and setting view.UseOffscreenRendering = 1.  But you still
get a window that pops up (it is just a blank window now).  I'll let you
know if I figure out how to get rid of the window altogether.

I suspect you are running out of memory with the Transform Filter.

Another approach would be to use a Programmable Filter and just change
the spacing information of the image data. Try this Python in the
Script property of the Programmable Filter:

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()
output.ShallowCopy(input)
output.SetSpacing(xSpacing, ySpacing, zSpacing)

That should do the trick.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Cory,

Thank you so much for your response. Really appreciate it.

Well, i used the Programmable Filter and gave the spacing in mm.
(i am suppose to get a 3D model), unfortunately i am getting a straight
line (pls see the attachment).

Earlier i was using the Calculator filter and i only could see slices.
My intention is to obtain a model with one smooth surface  (if there is an
approach to smooth the transitions of the slices that would do my job
:)....)

Kindly give me a hint.

Warm regards,
Chathuri Gunasekera.

Yes, all these timer loops in paraview are annoying. There is no platform
independent solution for registering callbacks on sockets, but for each
supported OS a clean solution exists, which you could implement. So, it is
doable, but requires more effort than what is usually put into paraview.
Additionally you wouldn't probably want a callback after each received
byte, but rather after each complete message. This is not possible in a
generic way with the present message construction.

You seem to be stuck with similar problems as I was. You may want to
consider Visit as an alternative. Visit has an active user and developer
community so that there are more than two people on the mailing lists who
can answer questions like yours. Most of Visit has evolved over the last
few years rather than the "don't touch if not necessary" long history of
paraview, so that it has a much more modern design. These are some of the
reasons why my supervisor convinced me to favour Visit even after I was
half way through my project.

Chaturi,

I'm still not clear on what your input is. Are you loading a series of
2D images? Is that working? What kind of data set do you get after
loading (look under the Information tab under Type:)? Do you see just
one slice when the data is loaded or an outline of a 3D box?

Please provide step-by-step what you are doing in ParaView up to the
point you want to specify the spacing between slices. Links to
pictures of what you are seeing are often helpful as well.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Comparison of Visit and ParaView development
Message-ID: <CAJZHu4RT7dek6wuyEWDDOL85m4kk58gnP8mgdM2-W2knZs7NgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ParaView programmers,
I would like to have some opinions on the suitability of either ParaView or
Visit for large scalable visualization applications. When I had the first
contact to visualization more than 5 years ago, Visit was not quite
scalable and ParaView seemed the only open source alternative.
Now I am trying to get into some serious developments, and although most
papers in the field still cite ParaView as their development framework,
there seems to be no active developers community except for two or three
kitware employees. Questions on this list are at the most basic level, and
nobody seems to be able to answer, who isn't working for kitware.
My impression is that ParaView has grown so complicated over the years that
it is no longer usable as a framework for parallel visualization
development. Only the ParaView application itself is still frequently used.
On the other hand, Visit seems to have overtaken ParaView in all aspects.
Most important is the high quality documentation and very active community,
scalability is now as good as ParaView, and collaborative web visualization
is coming rapidly.

What is your opinion? Are there any points, where ParaView is clearly
advantageous over Visit? Or is it used by most people only out of
convenience, because they have always worked with ParaView?
Given the horribly out of date books on ParaView and parallel VTK
development, web documentation mixing three major versions without stating
which version is referred to, and the dead development discussions I don't
see any possibility of learning ParaView programming today. Which material
do you use for tutorials and documentation?

Thank you
Sven

I am going to limit my responses to technical parts. It's too early in
the morning for anything else :).

> Yes, all these timer loops in paraview are annoying.

I am not sure there "many" timer loops in ParaView. Please feel free
to elaborate. Even this collaboration timer comes into play only when
connected to a collaboration enabled session. Also, not collaboration
support is one of those advanced, not often used features and hence
the road is expected to be bumpy.

Having the event loop calling select on the socket is a fairly common
practice esp. in single threaded applications.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualization of strata in ParaView
Message-ID: <576159CE.7010609@tirebiter.org>

Before starting, I should state that I'm a complete noob to ParaView, 
having only worked with it for a couple of weeks, so if this is a FAQ, I 
will be humbly abashed if pointed to somewhere rather obvious.

I have a dataset which is somewhat different than those which I believe 
are normally visualized with ParaView.  It is of geological strata and 
the samples are of discrete layers, rather than samples of some 
continuous function.  Furthermore, there are missing data or void regions.

I would like to display cross sections of these data showing the layers 
without color interpolation.  Is there a way to tell ParaView to display 
the colors in a step function rather than as a "continuous tone?"

Also, is there a way to tell ParaView to display the missing data as 
completely transparent -- in other words, setting the NaN color to 
having an opacity of zero?

Thanks for your attention and helpful RTFMs.

Regards.

I will leave it to the community to address some of these concerns since I
am obviously biased.

However, Sven made some misguided and unfair statements and I would like to
address those.

Books: Utkarsh & the ParaView community have put a lot of effort in
developing a User's Guide for ParaView, which is excellent. This is a
community developed effort, which is maintained very regularly and is
available in print and download form in addition to the LaTeX source code.
Yes, this is focused on users rather than developers but the same would be
true for any visualization tool out there. In addition, we are in the
process of open sourcing both VTK books, something which will take some
effort because they need to be converted from Framemaker to LaTeX. The goal
is to combine them in some way and open the development to the community.
In addition, ParaView will soon leverage VTK-m for shared-memory parallel
processing (http://m.vtk.org/) and we are developing two open source books
for that.

Community: First of all, ParaView is a natural extension of VTK. Therefore,
a lot of development happens at VTK level. I encourage everyone to take a
look at the archives of the VTK mailing lists including the developer list.
You will find a very vibrant community that goes well beyond Kitware there.
In fact, we are a minority on those lists very often. There are well over
50 developers who have contributed to VTK over the last few years, from
academia, industry and government. Almost all algorithmic work is done in
VTK. It is true that most of the ParaView application is developed by folks
at Kitware. Only a few folks from the ParaView development team regularly
responds to the mailing lists (kudos to them). Our team is now 43 people
about 20 of whom are focused on VTK and ParaView development.

Applications: There are a number of ParaView based applications out there,
clearly demonstrating ParaView as a viable application platform. Not
counting VTK based applications because there are too many of those to list
here.

* Tomviz: http://www.tomviz.org/
* CMB: http://www.computationalmodelbuilder.org/
* VeloView: http://www.paraview.org/veloview/
* Mantid 3D viewer: http://www.mantidproject.org/

In addition to a number of commercial cloud based platforms based on
ParaViewWeb such as SimScale (https://www.simscale.com/). Some of these are
developed at Kitware but some of the have been almost entirely developed
without very little help from us.

Features: There are a lot of huge features that are making their way into
ParaView. To be fair, these will also make their way into VisIt because
they come from VTK so these are really not differentiators between the two.
The two major ones are the new rendering engine including the use of much
more modern OpenGL features with huge performance increase and a focus on
next generation architectures such as GPUs and Xeon Phis though the
development of VTK-m. In addition, we have a strong focus on in situ
analysis through the development of Catalyst, which I would argue is the
premier in situ library with lots of advanced features not available
anywhere else. Something we demonstrated working very well on 1 million MPI
ranks on the Argonne Blue Gene (Mira). Other more research focused areas
such as Cinema (http://cinemascience.org/) are being pushed in
VTK/ParaView/Catalyst quite heavily right now. All of these focus on
exascale computing, which is US Department of Energy push right now.

Issues with ParaView as a development platform:

* It is true that our developer documentation is lacking. ParaView as a
development platform has never been the main driver so making it more
accessible to the larger community is something that has not been pushed as
much as we would like. Not true for VTK though.

* The ParaView code architecture is fairly complicated. This is because it
has evolved to address the needs of various kinds of applications. A much
broader set of needs that tools like VisIt tend to focus on. This is
because our community targets more than HPC Visualization, which were the
original drivers for both VisIt and ParaView. The kind of applications I
listed above is a good demonstration of this.

I believe that the main differentiator between ParaView and other vis tools
out there is the broad functionality _and_ the code quality. Having the two
together is really tough but our community managed this with a heavy
emphasis on code review and code testing. I strongly recommend that folks
look at the software processes used to develop VTK & ParaView as well as
the huge amount of testing (both test quantity and platform coverage) that
we do before every single commit in addition to nightly. There is a very
good overlap between the CMake, CTest & CDash communities and the
VTK/ParaView development communities and there is very good reason behind
this.

Best,
-berk

Hi Samuel,

thank you! So there is a way to do what I want provided that the mesh data are converted similar to the files you sent me. Good to know.
It would probably require some coding from my side to implement that solution for my workflow, i.e. teach Salom? and/or Elmer to convert the mesh into that multi-file format. Since I am short in time at the moment, I will live with the threshold filter solution Cory proposed.

Thank you again,

Matthias

Matthias,

Here is a time(0.0) mesh datum set that you or your staff can use in PV 5.0.0 to see how PV's Extract Block filter works. Take a look at the ASCII-formatted file fmavto.mesh.pvd; it is a "mother file" that tells ParaView about all of the *.vtu files. (Also, the *.vtu can be loaded individually if you like.)

However, I don't know how to make a mesh generated by Salom? a multi-block dataset. Could you tell me more or give me a pointer on where I can find that out?

Hi Matthais,



People typically use multi-block data sets for this purpose. ParaView has a

multi-block inspector that enables you change the visibility of the blocks in a

data set. If you make each surface a block, then you can show/hide each at

will.

Hi Cory,



this helped indeed, thank you.

I  load the mesh.vtu file and apply the Threshold filter on the GeometryID,

and display that together with my simulation results. That works fine.

If I want to display several parts selectively, I can use several Thresholds,

which is a bit clumsy.

It would be nice to be able to get a list of all GeometryIDs, and to check

those which I want displayed. Do you know if there is a way to do that? Or on

a more general basis: are there other, more elegant ways to display a

geometry in ParaView?



Thanks again,



Matthias

Matthias,



I'm not sure I fully understand exactly what you are trying to do,

but I will try to make a suggestion anyway. If the edges have a cell

data array giving the ID, you should be able to use the Threshold

filter to extract the edges associated with a particular body ID.

Just set the threshold values to the ID you want to see.



Hope that helps,

Cory

Hi,







is there a way to display the boundaries (edges) of a 2D geometry?

I have converted my mesh to vtu using Elmergrid, so I have the IDs

of bodies (=surfaces in 2D) and boundaries (edges) in a vtu file.

Can I just display the edges having the same ID? The extract edges filter

does not help.

What

else could I try?







Thank you for a helpful hint,







Matthias

Subject: [Paraview] Plot csv over time
Message-ID: <0B5B1BD3-5DFE-4454-98B5-C8744B75D7C1@sandia.gov>

Hello,

I was wondering if there is a way to plot csv data over time? Specifically, I would like to read into an active Paraview session that already has some exodus results loaded a csv file (this I can already do). This csv file came from the same simulation as the exodus data. I?d like to then plot the csv results over time such that the green vertical line shows up denoting time as a video plays. 

I?ve found I can use ?plot data? for the csv data and I can indeed plot time vs. variable but the green vertical line doesn?t appear. My theory is that the vertical time marker only appears when plotting something over time with the appropriate filter. Any idea how to get the time marker to appear in the plot? 

Thanks, Ryan Jamison

Hello,
short question, probably with an easy answer:

Why is the vtkSMRepresentationProxy, created for a vtkSMSourceProxy of a
SphereSource not rendered in the attached c++ code?

I guess I am missing a step which adds the representation to the view. But
how?

I don't find anything constructive in your answer. If you think paraview
sucks, I don't care if you discuss it in your own thread. But I am of a
different opinion and I prefer positive discussions, so please stop it here.

You're missing "adding the representation to the view" part, typically
done using vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering::Show.

See this example:

Thanks!
Just found out that another solution is to set the view's "Representations"
property to repr and the representation's "Input" property to sphere. I'll
try yours as well, it looks much simpler.

The green line appears with the X axis is set to a data array named
"Time". See the attached state file. You'll can.ex2 (included in
ParaView Example Data) and the attached csv file to load the state.

granted, most of those who committed between v5.0.0 and v5.1.0.rc1 were
from kitware, but 10x more than 3 active developers.

Questions on this list are at the most basic level, and nobody seems to be

Try paraview-developers list for paraview development questions.

We would of course like for all questions to be answered and we can
certainly do a better job at it but the fact is that everyone is of course
very busy. Kitware of course offers paid support if you need a guarantee
that your questions will be answered.

Both VisIt and ParaView are very good - and free! If you watch them both
long enough, over time you will see that at any given point one is better
at some things than the other, and that over time the specific things
(stability, HPC installation base, scalability, ease of use, documentation,
applicability to scientific domain X, etc) change as they both improve,

I leave the opinion about what is currently better about each tool to those
who know them both better than I.

I will agree that people use ParaView mostly out of convenience. But the
same thing goes for VisIt. Same thing goes for operating systems and text
editors for that matter. Once you invest the time to become an expert at
something, you are naturally loathe to bear with the frustration of
starting over.

We should certainly do a better job at documenting ParaView. We really
really do want to increase the developer pool.

But alas, good developing training material takes a lot of time to put
together and there aren't all that many people who want and need  advanced
ParaView material. The people who know a lot are always very busy trying to
making it better at X and don't have a lot of time to help other people
learn to know a lot.

The best way to learn is looking at the code, studying the on-line and in
source examples, asking politely on the mailing list, and taking the time
to get over the learning curve.

I think Berk answered well from a technical and custom applications viewpoint.  Although not your primary question, I thought I would add just a few words regarding ParaView from a user?s perspective.

Here at Sandia National Laboratories, we have seen amazing growth of ParaView usage over the last decade.  Last year we had over 330 users.  Last month alone we had 161 individual users (not counting support or developers).  ParaView is used for projects ranging from toys (learning how to use ParaView with the can.exo dataset) to huge (a 100 million cell, 2048 file dataset with 204 timesteps).  It is being used on everything from interplanetary space probe research to visualizing wind turbines to climate change.  Catalyst is also part of ParaView development, and Catalyst is making a huge impact here at Sandia.

Regarding documentation, ParaView has come a long way in the last few years with regards to user documentation, and I would argue is now similar to commercial packages.  Further, the website has all of this information easily available.  The next version of ParaView (5.1) features an updated Help menu, providing easy access to the ParaView guide, and two full tutorials (the Supercomputing tutorial and the Sandia tutorial).

You mention that Kitware appears to be the most active at answering the paraview.org list, and this is true.  I believe this is primarily because Kitware is by far the most knowledgeable, not because they are the only ones on the list.  Thus, you tend to hear from them first.

Regarding your primary question ? VisIt vs ParaView, I have no opinions, since I don?t know VisIt.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Comparison of Visit and ParaView development

I will leave it to the community to address some of these concerns since I am obviously biased.

However, Sven made some misguided and unfair statements and I would like to address those.

Books: Utkarsh & the ParaView community have put a lot of effort in developing a User's Guide for ParaView, which is excellent. This is a community developed effort, which is maintained very regularly and is available in print and download form in addition to the LaTeX source code. Yes, this is focused on users rather than developers but the same would be true for any visualization tool out there. In addition, we are in the process of open sourcing both VTK books, something which will take some effort because they need to be converted from Framemaker to LaTeX. The goal is to combine them in some way and open the development to the community. In addition, ParaView will soon leverage VTK-m for shared-memory parallel processing (http://m.vtk.org/) and we are developing two open source books for that.

Community: First of all, ParaView is a natural extension of VTK. Therefore, a lot of development happens at VTK level. I encourage everyone to take a look at the archives of the VTK mailing lists including the developer list. You will find a very vibrant community that goes well beyond Kitware there. In fact, we are a minority on those lists very often. There are well over 50 developers who have contributed to VTK over the last few years, from academia, industry and government. Almost all algorithmic work is done in VTK. It is true that most of the ParaView application is developed by folks at Kitware. Only a few folks from the ParaView development team regularly responds to the mailing lists (kudos to them). Our team is now 43 people about 20 of whom are focused on VTK and ParaView development.

Applications: There are a number of ParaView based applications out there, clearly demonstrating ParaView as a viable application platform. Not counting VTK based applications because there are too many of those to list here.

* Tomviz: http://www.tomviz.org/
* CMB: http://www.computationalmodelbuilder.org/
* VeloView: http://www.paraview.org/veloview/
* Mantid 3D viewer: http://www.mantidproject.org/

In addition to a number of commercial cloud based platforms based on ParaViewWeb such as SimScale (https://www.simscale.com/). Some of these are developed at Kitware but some of the have been almost entirely developed without very little help from us.

Features: There are a lot of huge features that are making their way into ParaView. To be fair, these will also make their way into VisIt because they come from VTK so these are really not differentiators between the two. The two major ones are the new rendering engine including the use of much more modern OpenGL features with huge performance increase and a focus on next generation architectures such as GPUs and Xeon Phis though the development of VTK-m. In addition, we have a strong focus on in situ analysis through the development of Catalyst, which I would argue is the premier in situ library with lots of advanced features not available anywhere else. Something we demonstrated working very well on 1 million MPI ranks on the Argonne Blue Gene (Mira). Other more research focused areas such as Cinema (http://cinemascience.org/) are being pushed in VTK/ParaView/Catalyst quite heavily right now. All of these focus on exascale computing, which is US Department of Energy push right now.

Issues with ParaView as a development platform:

* It is true that our developer documentation is lacking. ParaView as a development platform has never been the main driver so making it more accessible to the larger community is something that has not been pushed as much as we would like. Not true for VTK though.

* The ParaView code architecture is fairly complicated. This is because it has evolved to address the needs of various kinds of applications. A much broader set of needs that tools like VisIt tend to focus on. This is because our community targets more than HPC Visualization, which were the original drivers for both VisIt and ParaView. The kind of applications I listed above is a good demonstration of this.

I believe that the main differentiator between ParaView and other vis tools out there is the broad functionality _and_ the code quality. Having the two together is really tough but our community managed this with a heavy emphasis on code review and code testing. I strongly recommend that folks look at the software processes used to develop VTK & ParaView as well as the huge amount of testing (both test quantity and platform coverage) that we do before every single commit in addition to nightly. There is a very good overlap between the CMake, CTest & CDash communities and the VTK/ParaView development communities and there is very good reason behind this.

Best,

Dear ParaView programmers,
I would like to have some opinions on the suitability of either ParaView or Visit for large scalable visualization applications. When I had the first contact to visualization more than 5 years ago, Visit was not quite scalable and ParaView seemed the only open source alternative.
Now I am trying to get into some serious developments, and although most papers in the field still cite ParaView as their development framework, there seems to be no active developers community except for two or three kitware employees. Questions on this list are at the most basic level, and nobody seems to be able to answer, who isn't working for kitware.
My impression is that ParaView has grown so complicated over the years that it is no longer usable as a framework for parallel visualization development. Only the ParaView application itself is still frequently used.
On the other hand, Visit seems to have overtaken ParaView in all aspects. Most important is the high quality documentation and very active community, scalability is now as good as ParaView, and collaborative web visualization is coming rapidly.
What is your opinion? Are there any points, where ParaView is clearly advantageous over Visit? Or is it used by most people only out of convenience, because they have always worked with ParaView?
Given the horribly out of date books on ParaView and parallel VTK development, web documentation mixing three major versions without stating which version is referred to, and the dead development discussions I don't see any possibility of learning ParaView programming today. Which material do you use for tutorials and documentation?
Thank you
Sven

Welcome to ParaView Steve,

Everybody was a noob when they first tried to use ParaView, but the more 
you use ParaView, the smarter it gets.

Now, to your question about displaying a geological stratigraphy in 
ParaView, assuming that you have surfaces (of some sort, but preferably 
cell boundaries) at the material interfaces and that you have cells 
containing a datum item that is a number from a monotone sequence, the 
following is a possibility:

(1) Load and display your mesh in ParaView. ("Load and display" is an 
overloaded phrase, that is, you need to have a 2-D or 3-D geometric grid 
of points and cells that is in a file format that ParaView can read.)

(2) Select the cell-variable "Material-Number" (or whatever name you 
supplied with the material data for the cells like MatID, MatNo, ...) 
For void or unknown material regions you can have two choices, a real 
low number (say, -999) and a real high number (say, 999)

(3) The default color bar will appear along with a panel named Color Map 
Editor. Button number #2 allows you to set the lower and upper color 
range values you want to use. Below the color map you have the option of 
selecting a color for below range data and a color for above-range data.

(4) As a last step, button #6 (a yellow folder icon overlaid with a red 
heart) lets you select the color bar you prefer. In your case, go to the 
very bottom of the Preset Color Scales where you will find a color scale 
named "blot" (The blot color scale is a set of, for want of a better 
word, distinct colors.) It is a historic color scale that was widely 
used in the early days of 2-D contour plotting where the contour levels 
were at the color boundaries.

Historically, if more than 7 contours were used, the color sequence 
repeated. I don't know what ParaView will do if you have more than six 
distinct geologic layers.

I could easily imagine that you could outgrow the above approach, but 
maybe it will help to get you started with ParaView.

Enjoy,

Thanks for the information. I think I almost got it but still have a question. I?m not able to plot the time vs. some other variable from the csv file.

In the ?Display (QuartileChartRepresentation)? I can select the ?X Array Name? to be any of the variables from the csv file, including time. When I select time, the green vertical time marker appears (this is good). The one thing that does not happen is that the ?Series Parameters? do not list any of the variables from the csv file. All that is listed are variables from the can.ex2. How can I plot two variables from the csv file?

I?ve included an image of what I?m seeing?

Thanks, Ryan

Hello,

I was wondering if there is a way to plot csv data over time? Specifically, I would like to read into an active Paraview session that already has some exodus results loaded a csv file (this I can already do). This csv file came from the same simulation as the exodus data. I?d like to then plot the csv results over time such that the green vertical line shows up denoting time as a video plays.

I?ve found I can use ?plot data? for the csv data and I can indeed plot time vs. variable but the green vertical line doesn?t appear. My theory is that the vertical time marker only appears when plotting something over time with the appropriate filter. Any idea how to get the time marker to appear in the plot?

Thanks, Ryan Jamison

I use both VisIt and ParaView at NCSA regularly, depending upon what the teams I support are already using. If I have a free hand I generally pick ParaView because (1) I learned VTK first and it?s very straightforward to mentally map a VTK vis pipeline to ParaView and (2) I find the ParaView GUI more intuitive, which is not to be underestimated. Now that VisItBridge is available, I?m even able to get away with mixed projects (though those are rendering projects, not dev projects).

Both scale well in my experience and have for years. I?d like to hear more about what VisIt wasn?t able to scale in the past.

For in situ I have developed with both VisIt?s libsim2 and Catalyst and find Catalyst much easier. With libsim2, it seemed more like that the simulation code had to be shoehorned into VisIt, but maybe that?s been improved since I looked into it.

Both codebases are non-trivial. If you?re planning on developing in the primary codebase as opposed to writing plugins/operators/filters, I don?t think one would be markedly easier than the other.

The python API for ParaView is much more pythonic, IMO.

The downloadable VisIt user manual is for 1.5 and from 2005. Looking at the history in the developer wiki, some of the wiki pages are from 2008, so it?s not clear that its documentation is more up to date.

I don?t mean to bash VisIt, VisIt has some nice features: setting up interactive remote client-server jobs is a snap, the color map editor for volume rendering has easy to use Gaussian opacity transfer functions, you can do some interesting things with queries, etc.

I?ve found both mailing lists to be professional and responsive. I certainly don?t have any complaints about Kitware answering many of the questions, Alan is right, they know more! ?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Re: Comparison of Visit and ParaView development

I think Berk answered well from a technical and custom applications viewpoint.  Although not your primary question, I thought I would add just a few words regarding ParaView from a user?s perspective.

Here at Sandia National Laboratories, we have seen amazing growth of ParaView usage over the last decade.  Last year we had over 330 users.  Last month alone we had 161 individual users (not counting support or developers).  ParaView is used for projects ranging from toys (learning how to use ParaView with the can.exo dataset) to huge (a 100 million cell, 2048 file dataset with 204 timesteps).  It is being used on everything from interplanetary space probe research to visualizing wind turbines to climate change.  Catalyst is also part of ParaView development, and Catalyst is making a huge impact here at Sandia.

Other more research focused areas such as Cinema (http://cinemascience.org/<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__cinemascience.org_&d=CwMGaQ&c=8hUWFZcy2Z-Za5rBPlktOQ&r=lLjWQse1m7sIE-wZm9lCGeCv45WZDxzY072HGbCi4Mg&m=Fk9FzrSbKPDpKCfLSdae3u20A7v10NbTnDTf9cgUpsQ&s=tQ1IQkvZg4OA-e-tH9n6SgrrSPZxDOo9BLO51ADVS0M&e=>) are being pushed in VTK/ParaView/Catalyst quite heavily right now. All of these focus on exascale computing, which is US Department of Energy push right now.

Issues with ParaView as a development platform:

* It is true that our developer documentation is lacking. ParaView as a development platform has never been the main driver so making it more accessible to the larger community is something that has not been pushed as much as we would like. Not true for VTK though.

* The ParaView code architecture is fairly complicated. This is because it has evolved to address the needs of various kinds of applications. A much broader set of needs that tools like VisIt tend to focus on. This is because our community targets more than HPC Visualization, which were the original drivers for both VisIt and ParaView. The kind of applications I listed above is a good demonstration of this.

I believe that the main differentiator between ParaView and other vis tools out there is the broad functionality _and_ the code quality. Having the two together is really tough but our community managed this with a heavy emphasis on code review and code testing. I strongly recommend that folks look at the software processes used to develop VTK & ParaView as well as the huge amount of testing (both test quantity and platform coverage) that we do before every single commit in addition to nightly. There is a very good overlap between the CMake, CTest & CDash communities and the VTK/ParaView development communities and there is very good reason behind this.

Dear ParaView programmers,
I would like to have some opinions on the suitability of either ParaView or Visit for large scalable visualization applications. When I had the first contact to visualization more than 5 years ago, Visit was not quite scalable and ParaView seemed the only open source alternative.
Now I am trying to get into some serious developments, and although most papers in the field still cite ParaView as their development framework, there seems to be no active developers community except for two or three kitware employees. Questions on this list are at the most basic level, and nobody seems to be able to answer, who isn't working for kitware.
My impression is that ParaView has grown so complicated over the years that it is no longer usable as a framework for parallel visualization development. Only the ParaView application itself is still frequently used.
On the other hand, Visit seems to have overtaken ParaView in all aspects. Most important is the high quality documentation and very active community, scalability is now as good as ParaView, and collaborative web visualization is coming rapidly.
What is your opinion? Are there any points, where ParaView is clearly advantageous over Visit? Or is it used by most people only out of convenience, because they have always worked with ParaView?
Given the horribly out of date books on ParaView and parallel VTK development, web documentation mixing three major versions without stating which version is referred to, and the dead development discussions I don't see any possibility of learning ParaView programming today. Which material do you use for tutorials and documentation?
Thank you
Sven

Subject: [Paraview] Questions on Paraview with 3D vector fields
Message-ID: <57620A8A.4000908@gmail.com>

Hello All:

I'm working with 3D vector fields (2 of them in the same space) and want 
to do a fly through, set the center to be one of the arrow glyphs, and 
do some calculations on both fields using the calculator. I can't seem 
to do any of these. Any ideas?

It looks like the center selection was designed to work with polymeshes. 
The arrow glyphs just can't be selected. Is there any way to fake out 
Paraview and place something that the selector can see?

I saw fly through mentioned on some forum but no solution. I can place a 
line into my space. Is there some way to use the line as a camera path? 
I'm really interested in fly throughs in the program, not watching them 
as a movie. There's just too many things to change to make it a movie 
and not take forever to make/look at them.

The calculator looks like it only hooks up to one vector field at a 
time. Is there some object linking trick or running one field through an 
intermediate calculation that would make both fields visible to the 
calculator?

Any help appreciated.

-J

Slightly off-topic (not fully about ParaView vs VisIt), but I always 
wondered about the development process of VTK/ParaView with respect to 
bug reports. There seem to be a huge number of reported bugs for 
ParaView (and a few for VTK), ranging from crashes to incorrect 
functionality to feature requests. Over the years I have entered more 
than two dozen myself, but was always surprised about the lack of 
response, especially when reporting things that were easily reproducible 
and/or crasher bugs (e.g. VTK #10528, ParaView #15291, ParaView #15944, 
ParaView #13802).

Now, I understand that what's not working for me might not be important 
to others, so, of course, assigning priorty and doing actual fixes for 
reports is done by the developer community. A second "handicap" in this 
respect is undoubtedly the fact that KitWare is a business and so has 
different priorities than a bunch of hackers working mostly in their 
spare time on their pet project.

But basically anything reported these days immediately gets status 
"backlog" and I would guesstimate getting a response to a report only 
about 25% of the time. I report bugs quite often for other open-source 
projects (and try to enter concise reports with a testcase), but with 
ParaView/VTK I get the feeling it's not worth the trouble, which is a 
shame. Actually getting back on topic: the one or two times I reported a 
bug in VisIt I got a reply and fix quickly!

Furthermore, ParaView seems quite easy to segfault and it happens even 
with moderately complex pipelines and modest datasets. Parallel volume 
rendering has been broken for ages (or is it fixed these days? Can't 
tell, ParaView #13801 did not get any replies). Some examples shown on 
the wiki cause Python errors (e.g. #15291, #12796). And so on.

So the comment above about code quality making ParaView stand out from 
other visualization tools is a bit a stretch in my opinion. I would 
certainly not call ParaView "stable". In fact, in the introductory 
scivis courses we teach with ParaView we always warn people that crashes 
are to be expected regularly and even during the course assignments they 
sometimes happen.

The development process as mentioned by Berk is indeed impressive, but 
seems mostly focused on preventing regressions in existing 
functionality. This is a worthy goal in itself, but is only one half of 
the story when it comes to guaranteeing code quality. The things that 
aren't working (see bug reports) are maybe not getting the attention 
they deserve, but are apparently things folks run into when using 
ParaView, so they signal something real.

After the stuff above I wanted to finish on a less critical note :) I 
prefer using ParaView over VisIt mostly because of being able to build a 
pipeline and prefer ParaView's nice single-window GUI over VisIt's 
a-window-here-a-window-there-a-window-everywhere approach. They are both 
good and useful tools and are work-horses for scivis tasks. Whenever I 
get a request from an HPC user which one to use I recommend ParaView, as 
it is easier to get into for basic scivis work.

Regards,
Paul

Hi Mandar,

I'm not 100% sure, but I suspect that what is going on is this:  ParaView
5.0 was updated to require a much newer version of OpenGL, so your graphics
hardware and/or drivers may need to be updated.  In 5.0.0, this causes a
crash like this since trying to create the OpenGL context fails.  One of
the fixes in ParaView 5.0.1 was that it checks your OpenGL version first
and if ParaView can't run with that version it gives you a nice error
message.  I would recommend trying with 5.0.1 to see if this is indeed the
problem.  Then if it is, you will need to figure out how to get your
computer to supports an OpenGL version >= 3.2 or build ParaView from source
with the older OpenGL1 rendering backend.

HTH,
Shawn

Bugs often get prioritized by several of the customers/community
members that drive the development of ParaView. While several others
get fixed as developers notice them. As you said, bug trackers does
accumulate several reports. Hence it's good to make some noise on the
mailing list to get some attention when you report a bug, for example.
While we do endeavour to monitor the bug tracker, in practice it's
hard to stay on top of it and things can easily slip down the cracks.
For example, I don't think I ever even saw the bugs you mention.
Several were indeed easily answerable.

Sure, Kitware is a business, but not most of us here are driven by the
open source ideals and everything that it brings -- community, greater
good etc. etc. Many of us do respond in our spare or personal time
just because we enjoy it -- when we could very easily be simply
catching up on the latest Game of Thrones gossip :). Of course, life
is always less than ideal and deadlines and requirements of ongoing
projects often dictate how things get prioritized, but that doesn't
mean we are any less driven. At the same time, these are community
projects. Community members using ParaView and developing with it are
encouraged to take over bugs, ask for assistance on how to track them,
as needed. Everyone will only be glad to help. We've even made it
easier with Gitlab to get community changes reviewed and tested and
merged. There have been a few new folks contributing since that
happened -- kudos to them -- but just looking at the kinds of
questions we answer on the mailing list, there are clearly a lot more
people with the know how out there who just don't contribute back.

> But basically anything reported these days immediately gets status "backlog"

"backlog" is just the default state.

There have been quite a few recent announcements that went into
revamping the volume rendering code.

Please do report issues with information on how to reproduce them. The
whole team including members from outside Kitware, like Alan Scott
from Sandia and others work tirelessly to keep things stable. But
note, ParaView is also constantly pushing the envelope. There are
always a hoard of new features being added to support new usecases.
That does mean more opportunities to make mistakes. Thankfully,
several community members already help out a lot with testing and
making sure things continue to work, so the picture is really not that
bleak. There are community members ensuring things build and deploy on
esoteric HPC systems we don't have access to, there are folks
deploying on various linux distributions and working with us to
address any issues, the list goes on and on!

The moral of the story is: just speak up and grab someone's attention,
and if that fails, just grab your coding toolbox and dive in -- how
bad can it be :)!

Try ParaView 4.4. If that works than it's indeed an OpenGL driver issue.
You may have to update your drivers.

Subject: [Paraview] Can a collaborative client share a pipeline without
	creating a view itself?
Message-ID: <CAAUk9C7zY8P25QWDeZdcCA7Vx18uiBBe_+_LbyepsFt8FUQaGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again,
I have a follow-up question concerning my attempts to create a
collaborative standalone client. The attached example connects to a
pvserver running on localhost (with --multi-clients option) and creates a
SphereSource together with its representation. Depending on whether
"USEVIEW" is defined or undefined in the beginning, also a RenderView is
created and shows the sphere.

The plan is that other clients can pick up and display the created
pipeline. Unfortunately this doesn't work if the example code doesn't
create a RenderView by itself. Maybe my understanding is wrong, but isn't
it sufficient if a client creates sources and their representations so that
other clients can display these in their views? Moreover, the behaviour
depends on the order in which the example client and the ParaView client
are started.

This is a more structured summary of the different test "modes":

If I compile the example with "USEVIEW" defined in the beginning,
a) Starting in the order pvserver->example->ParaView, ParaView reports
"This code may not work in multi-clients mode. Could not locate server on
which the source is being added." and shows the sphere in the renderer, but
not in the pipeline panel.
b) Starting in the order pvserver->ParaView->example, everything works as
expected.

If I undefine "USEVIEW" in the beginning, it is not quite running as
expected:
c) Starting in the order pvserver->example->ParaView, ParaView reports
"Could not locate server on which the source is being added." and shows
nothing.
d) Starting in the order pvserver->ParaView->example, ParaView shows "Sph1"
in the pipeline panel, but nothing in the renderer.

Why does the Sphere not show up in ParaView's pipeline panel in case a)?
Why does the Sphere show up in ParaView's pipeline panel, but not in the
renderer in case d)?
And what does "This code may not work in multi-clients mode" and "Could not
locate server on which the source is being added" exactly wnat to tell me?

If you could share any answers to one or more of these questions or suggest
what else to try, it'll be highly appreciated.

Peter

Paul,
I looked at a few of the bugs listed below.  

I replicated 15944, this would impact my users.  It's on Sandia's list.  

13802 works correctly on 5.0.1.  Note that you are creating 2.6 billion cells, and from what I can tell, you are running out of memory on your server side.  I was able to get this to work with 8 nodes of a cluster.  Try running the View/ Memory Inspector, it will tell you how much pressure you are putting on your memory.

Slightly off-topic (not fully about ParaView vs VisIt), but I always wondered about the development process of VTK/ParaView with respect to bug reports. There seem to be a huge number of reported bugs for ParaView (and a few for VTK), ranging from crashes to incorrect functionality to feature requests. Over the years I have entered more than two dozen myself, but was always surprised about the lack of response, especially when reporting things that were easily reproducible and/or crasher bugs (e.g. VTK #10528, ParaView #15291, ParaView #15944, ParaView #13802).

Now, I understand that what's not working for me might not be important to others, so, of course, assigning priorty and doing actual fixes for reports is done by the developer community. A second "handicap" in this respect is undoubtedly the fact that KitWare is a business and so has different priorities than a bunch of hackers working mostly in their spare time on their pet project.

But basically anything reported these days immediately gets status "backlog" and I would guesstimate getting a response to a report only about 25% of the time. I report bugs quite often for other open-source projects (and try to enter concise reports with a testcase), but with ParaView/VTK I get the feeling it's not worth the trouble, which is a shame. Actually getting back on topic: the one or two times I reported a bug in VisIt I got a reply and fix quickly!

Furthermore, ParaView seems quite easy to segfault and it happens even with moderately complex pipelines and modest datasets. Parallel volume rendering has been broken for ages (or is it fixed these days? Can't tell, ParaView #13801 did not get any replies). Some examples shown on the wiki cause Python errors (e.g. #15291, #12796). And so on.

So the comment above about code quality making ParaView stand out from other visualization tools is a bit a stretch in my opinion. I would certainly not call ParaView "stable". In fact, in the introductory scivis courses we teach with ParaView we always warn people that crashes are to be expected regularly and even during the course assignments they sometimes happen.

The development process as mentioned by Berk is indeed impressive, but seems mostly focused on preventing regressions in existing functionality. This is a worthy goal in itself, but is only one half of the story when it comes to guaranteeing code quality. The things that aren't working (see bug reports) are maybe not getting the attention they deserve, but are apparently things folks run into when using ParaView, so they signal something real.

After the stuff above I wanted to finish on a less critical note :) I prefer using ParaView over VisIt mostly because of being able to build a pipeline and prefer ParaView's nice single-window GUI over VisIt's a-window-here-a-window-there-a-window-everywhere approach. They are both good and useful tools and are work-horses for scivis tasks. Whenever I get a request from an HPC user which one to use I recommend ParaView, as it is easier to get into for basic scivis work.

Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <CAE32kpWJMW+bGzf5=83KLBiOZKRv=7Zyw+4xLKp-DzopcYqctA@mail.gmail.com>

Visualization Showcase
------------------------------

Important Dates:
February 16, 2016: *Submissions open*
July 31, 2016: *Submissions deadline*
September 1, 2016: *Notifications sent*
------------------------------

*A new format for 2016!*

SC16?s Visualization and Data Analytics Showcase Program provides a forum
for the year?s most instrumental movies in HPC. This year, there will be
both a live display throughout the conference so that attendees can
experience and enjoy the latest in science and engineering HPC results
expressed through state-of-the-art visualization technologies, and a
session at SC16 dedicated to the best of the submissions.

Selected entries will be displayed live in a museum/art gallery format and
six finalists will compete for the Best Visualization Award, with each
finalist presenting his or her movie in a 15-minute presentation.

Movies are judged based on how their movie illuminates science, by the
quality of the movie, and for innovations in the process used for creating
the movie.

The six finalist submissions will appear as short papers on the SC16
webpage and archive.

*Review and selection process:*

Submissions need to include a movie (up to 250MB in size) and a short paper
(up to 4 pages including references). The short paper should describe the
scientific story conveyed by the movie, how the visualization helps
scientific discovery, and the ?state-of-the-practice? information (
ieeevis.org)information behind making the movie.

Each submission will be peer reviewed by the Visualization and Data
Analytics Showcase Committee. Criteria for review include:

   - How effective is the visual communication of the data?
   - How relevant to the HPC community is the visualization?
   - What is the impact of the science story and how well is it told?
   - What visualization techniques were necessary to create the movie?

Finally, submissions should support SC16?s overall theme ?HPC matters.?

Subject: [Paraview] Can a collaborative client share a pipeline without

Peter,

In ParaView's collaboration support there's the notion of a master and
everyone else. The first client that connects to the pvserver is the
"master" by default. The master is the only one that should create new
proxies. This doesn't preclude the other clients from not creating new
proxies, but if they do, things start acting funny. Also all client
have exactly the same views as the proxy. They can be showing a
different camera, but not have different number of views or types of
views etc.

There seems to be a bug where the ParaView client has trouble loading
existing state from another client. It seems to work as expected if
the "master" starts creating sphere etc. after the other client has
connected.

Same issue as (a).

In this case your non-master example has created a view which is not supported.

A bug in loading initial collaboration state.

You're showing sphere in a view not known to master.

> And what does "This code may not work in multi-clients mode" and "Could not

Proxies are being created before the session was "ready for use". Like
I said, collaboration isn't being used actively in production so such
issues are expected. Since I don't have active projects funding this,
I will try to track down the bug exposed by (a) and give you a fix
over the weekend if I can.

You're actually seeing all the variables in this file :). The quartile view
adds special meaning to variables prefixed by min/max/q1 etc. Just close
this view and instead show the output in a LineChartView. You'll see all
the columns in the CSV individually.

Message-ID: <CADPbR1iTP010aEp5MMWgfn_QV9eTh0Xsktw_vegskSf7d5uDig@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm using Paraview v5.0.1 to visualize some geophysical data, but I'm
running into a rendering issue. When I zoom in to my data sets, data in the
background randomly jumps in front of cross-sections in the foreground.
Here's a video link showing an example of this issue:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVSPfuS-OVM


Do you encounter the same issue with my data files? Here is a sample of two
of my lines here. They are legacy Paraview v2.0 VTK in ASCII format using
the POLYDATA type.
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9e7iyajk29kxwt3/AACix63qx9ali632d9uFjE6ta?dl=0

Any suggestions on how to fix this problem are most welcome. You can reach
me at craig.christensen at ucalgary.ca .

Thanks,

I'm running into a similar issue.

I have three cross sections, along the three major axes, and they do not 
seem to occlude one another as one would expect.

I've turned on depth peeling and have experimented with setting the 
maximum number of peels to no avail.

I know this is a classic OpenGL depth sorting issue since I've run into 
myself back when I was coding such things.

I've updated my nVidia drivers to what passes for the Latest and 
Greatest for Ubuntu Linux and I have a fairly recent graphics card 
(Quadro K2000D).  I'll be happy to supply any other system information I 
can if it'll help.

Is there something else I need to switch on in order to get ParaView to 
operate in the "expected" manner?

Thanx.

Steve,

I worry it sounds a bit like a bug.

Can you provide us with a toy dataset (or non-toy, if necessary) that replicates the issue?  Also, really, really good directions (+Y, roll mouse wheel in 4 times)?

I've updated my nVidia drivers to what passes for the Latest and Greatest for Ubuntu Linux and I have a fairly recent graphics card (Quadro K2000D).  I'll be happy to supply any other system information I can if it'll help.

Is there something else I need to switch on in order to get ParaView to operate in the "expected" manner?

Thanx.

Subject: [Paraview] python calculator confusion
Message-ID: <a0b8b0d7cdce467d8feeb8279009ab25@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I'm trying to figure out the volume of each cell of a dataset.  I am trying to use the Python Calculator.  However, frankly, the data doesn't make sense.  So, I tried something really, really simple.  And things still aren't making sense.  Here is what I did:


*         ParaView 5.0.1, local server, Linux.

*         Sources/ Wavelet.  Change extents to go from 0 to 10 for X, Y and Z.  So, each cell has a volume of 1, there are 1000 cells, total volume of 1000.

*         Python Calculator.

o   Expression: volume(inputs[0])

o   Result: 31.62



Any idea what this volume is?  Why isn't it 1 or 1000, and how do I get a correct volume?



Thanks,



Alan

Here's what I found:

1. Make sure you set "Array Association" on "Python Calculator" to "Cell Data".
2. The volume() code internally uses vtkCellQuality filter. Now, when
I debugged into it, I see that is doesn;t support voxel cell types --
the cells produced by vtkImageData. Now is there are reason for that,
I don't know. I will have to dig deeper, but just stating things I see
here. For cases where it doesn't know support the cell type, the
filter just puts out -1. And the "result" I am getting is indeed just
-1 for all cells.
3. If I instead apply the Tetrahedralize filter before apply Python
Calculator, I get the right cell volume since the filter seems to
support tets, triangle, triangle strip, quad, and hexahedron. Why only
these -- I'll need to check with original developers as I don't know.

So the question is what is type of dataset you're originally trying to
use. Is it unstructured grid with the above listed cell types? If yes,
the Python Calculator should work. If not, we need another solution.
As far as I can tell there's no filter that computes volume for any
kind of cell.

Yes, that is an artifact of using the verdict library to compute volume. The cell quality filter is being used to compute a "quality" metric that is rarely used as a primary indicator of mesh quality, so this is not really the intended use of the filter. The cell quality of axis aligned boxes is not usually of interest to anyone, so when writing the quality filter I did not consider that cell type... only those types directly supported by verdict. While volume can be obtained for other types by tetrahedralizing and summing, that does not work for other metrics like Frobenius norm. Many element shapes do not have well-characterized quality metrics.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Forcing update on view

I am not sure I follow what you're doing, but here are a few things to note.

1. vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects() is called to push changes done to a property. Thus, only needs to be called on the proxy whose properties you're changing. Thus, if you are chaning "CompositeDataSetIIndex"
property on the chartRepresentationProxy, you only need to call
UpdateVTKObjects() on it.
2. pqView::forceRender() cancels pending renders, so you don't have to do that explicitly.
3. When CompositeDataSetIndex property is changed and successfully pushed, vtkChartRepresentation::AddCompositeDataSetIndex() should be called. Try putting a breakpoint there to ensure it's getting called when you're expecting it to happen.

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

I can change their status programmatically but the view is not being updated. When I change them manually in the UI the view knows about their status change and plots only the content I select. I tried to force the update with UpdateVTkObjects() of available properties plus explicitly calling render()/forceRender() of the view but with no success.  Every file I create has multiple plot curves in it instead of one.

Hi All,

I was working on the issue recently and i am very close to having
prototype code but i had some difficulties in initialization of the
co-processing component with coprocessorinitializewithpython call. In my
case, two model components and adaptor have its own processing source (or
MPI_COMM_WORLD). For example, MPI processor 0, 1, 2, 3 are used by 1st
model, 4, 5, 6, 7 are used by 2nd model code and 8, 9, 10, 11 is used by
adaptor. The code basically handles transferring the grid information and
data to adaptor. So, the problem is that if i try to call my custom
coprocessorinitializewithpython call in adaptor (only in 8, 9, 10, 11)
then it hangs in g_coprocessor->Initialize(); (see code at the end of the
mail) step but if i call coprocessorinitializewithpython in the main code
that uses all the available processor (between 0 and 11) and it runs
without any problem. It seems that there is a restriction in the ParaView
side (expecially vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() that can be found in
CoProcessing/Catalyst/vtkCPProcessor.cxx) but i am not sure. Do you have
any suggestion about that? Do you think that is it possible to fix it
easily. Of corse the adaptor code could use all the processor but it is
better to have its own dedicated resource that might have GPU support in
those specific servers or processors. I am relatively new to VTK and it
might be difficult for me to fix it and i need your guidance to start.

Best Regards,

--ufuk

Dear Utkarsh,
thank you for these very clear explanations and for offering to fix the
issue with loading the initial collaboration state. Although I had
understood that data sources can only be created by the master, it wasn't
obvious to me that the same holds for views. I think I have a better
understanding now.

Concerning the master-slave differentiation I will have some questions in
the near future. Maybe you can quickly answer some thoughts on this topic
so that I don't follow the wrong path. I would like to implement "real"
collaboration where the master can allow selected clients to change the
rendering pipeline themselves. I don't see a contradiction why noone
besides the master should modify the pipeline if the state is properly
synchronized among all participants, do you?
I can imagine two or three options how to achieve this more open
collaboration without changing too much of the paraview design:
1) Let the master promote any slave to "temporary" master on request and
expect the temporary master to promote the original master again after
finishing the pipeline modification. Pro: easy implementation, Con:
problematic if original master is not promoted again for any reason.
2) Let the master modify the pipeline on behalf of slave requests. Slaves
would stream their requests to the master who actually performs the
requested changes. Pro: clean solution, Con: more complex implementation
3) Weaken the master-slave differentiation in a way that every participant
gets certain rights for modifications. Con: probably too many side effects
Can you recommend ad hoc, whether any of the approaches sound reasonable or
something similar is maybe already implemented?

Finally, I believe that I will have to dive into message passing between
paraview clients, soon. Not exactly talking about MPI, but rather in the
style of the collaboration messages that ParaView sends around, although I
am not familiar with any of the details. I would need something like "Hey
Master, please add this source X to the pipeline, append filter Y. And
notify me when you're done."
Do you happen to remember some blog post, tutorial or documentation that
gives any introduction how this can be done using ParaView classes?

Thanks a lot
Peter

Folks,

The bad news: I can reproduce this in ParaView 5.0.1 on a Mac given
the data files Craig shared.

The good news: I cannot reproduce it in my development version of
ParaView 5.1 RC1. Mind downloading that version of ParaView and giving
it a shot? I would guess there might have been a rendering bug in the
OpenGL2 backend in VTK that has since been fixed.

Thanks,
Cory

Has anyone tested OpenGL1 vs. OpenGL2 backends on master?

It may be an issue with the recent changes to depth peeling. OpenGL1 will
still use the old implementation, OpenGL2 (not on mesa) will use the new
version.

With regard to OpenGL1 vs OpenGL2 backends ? I think that there?s an issue with 5.0.1 where the frontend/backend need to be compiled using the same OpenGL ?.. so if you want to jump back to OpenGL1 on the backend, you?ll need a similarly configured frontend ??

This could also be related to the age-old "tiny bounds at far away
locations" issue with OpenGL precision. Looks like your data bounds
are a few 100 units in each dimension while located at (6.0e5, 6.0e6,
2e3). Try using the "Transform" filter to move the data closer to the
origin. Does that overcome the issue?

FWIW, I too cannot reproduce the issue with 5.1.0-RC1 on my Mac
(10.11) as Cory said. I can try on a Linux box later today.

Hi Ufuk,

I can think of two potential fixes:

   - Use the vtkCPProcessor:: Initialize(vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm&
   comm) method to initialize each process with the proper MPI communicator.
   Note that vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm is defined in
   vtkMPICommunicator.cxx. A similar example to this is available in the
   Examples/Catalyst/MPISubCommunicatorExample directory.
   - Call vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() on all processes with your global
   communicator and then create a vtkMPIController partitioned the way you
   want and set that to be the "global" communicator through
   vtkMPIController::SetGlobalController().

Please let us know if either of these methods work for you.

Also, what code are you working on and is it a publicly available code? If
you show your implementation I may have some in-depth suggestions for
improvements.

Best,

Andy

Ah, I see it now! Thank you very much! I still have much to learn about how Paraview works.

You're actually seeing all the variables in this file :). The quartile view adds special meaning to variables prefixed by min/max/q1 etc. Just close this view and instead show the output in a LineChartView. You'll see all the columns in the CSV individually.

Thanks for the information. I think I almost got it but still have a question. I?m not able to plot the time vs. some other variable from the csv file.

In the ?Display (QuartileChartRepresentation)? I can select the ?X Array Name? to be any of the variables from the csv file, including time. When I select time, the green vertical time marker appears (this is good). The one thing that does not happen is that the ?Series Parameters? do not list any of the variables from the csv file. All that is listed are variables from the can.ex2. How can I plot two variables from the csv file?

I?ve included an image of what I?m seeing?

Thanks, Ryan

Hello,

I was wondering if there is a way to plot csv data over time? Specifically, I would like to read into an active Paraview session that already has some exodus results loaded a csv file (this I can already do). This csv file came from the same simulation as the exodus data. I?d like to then plot the csv results over time such that the green vertical line shows up denoting time as a video plays.

I?ve found I can use ?plot data? for the csv data and I can indeed plot time vs. variable but the green vertical line doesn?t appear. My theory is that the vertical time marker only appears when plotting something over time with the appropriate filter. Any idea how to get the time marker to appear in the plot?

Thanks, Ryan Jamison

Subject: [Paraview] syntax for "global variables" for a dataset
Message-ID: <CAGgSO3jwfkdLSGHJs8d3a0mDaUoTMGCRwThT68Hy8OWD1of2YQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have seen references to the following statement in a Paraview tutorial
from University of Houston:
"Data sets sometimes capture information in ?global" variables that apply
to an entire dataset rather than a single point or cell."

If this is indeed true can someone please share example syntax of how one
would manually specify a set of global variables in a .pvd or .vtu xml file
(not programmatically via a VTK function call)  that are not contained
within an enclosing PointData or CellData element.
(I am not talking about GlobalNodeIDs or GlobalElementIDs but rather to
field data that apply to all points and arrays of an entire dataset).
I am aware of the "Plot Global Variables Over Time" filter but that seems
to apply to field values that persist over many timesteps, not field data
that are common to all points and cells.

many thanks....

Wow, you?re an animal.  Good job.

I'm working back from a amr cth problem.  Basically, my user is trying to do data analysis on a volume of hot gas.  He ran the simulation, and the simulation and ParaView are telling him different things.  So, I took the Dave's Small CTH dataset, which starts as a smashed sphere.  I can guess the diameter, thus can guess the radius, thus can guess the volume.  And, when I used the python calculator on that, once again, I got bad results.  From there, I backed up to Wavelet, hoping for some sanity.  

I will rerun my test, remembering to set Cell Data.   Good point, I bet I messed up.

Seems to me that even more than supporting all or at least most cell types, we need to never provide wrong data.  We can coordinate off line to get this fixed.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] python calculator confusion

Here's what I found:

1. Make sure you set "Array Association" on "Python Calculator" to "Cell Data".
2. The volume() code internally uses vtkCellQuality filter. Now, when I debugged into it, I see that is doesn;t support voxel cell types -- the cells produced by vtkImageData. Now is there are reason for that, I don't know. I will have to dig deeper, but just stating things I see here. For cases where it doesn't know support the cell type, the filter just puts out -1. And the "result" I am getting is indeed just
-1 for all cells.
3. If I instead apply the Tetrahedralize filter before apply Python Calculator, I get the right cell volume since the filter seems to support tets, triangle, triangle strip, quad, and hexahedron. Why only these -- I'll need to check with original developers as I don't know.

So the question is what is type of dataset you're originally trying to use. Is it unstructured grid with the above listed cell types? If yes, the Python Calculator should work. If not, we need another solution.
As far as I can tell there's no filter that computes volume for any kind of cell.

Hi all,

Utkarsh's suggestion to transform the dataset closer to the origin using a
translation seems to have worked for me. I was working in UTM coordinates,
so I was working about 6,000 km away from the origin of the coordinate
system. Thanks for your help, Utkarsh!

All the best,
Craig

A followup on this issue.

I uninstalled the 5.0.1 version as distributed on the download site and 
reinstalled the Ubuntu version found in the distro repository and the 
problem went away.  This version gives a "warning" in its titlebar 
"Legacy Rendering Backend."

As luck would have it, an associate of mine installed the 5.0.1 Windows 
version at the ParaView download site and it exhibits the same bad behavior.

It looks to me as if the newer version, *without* the "Legacy Rendering 
Backend" does not do proper polygon sorting such that scenes are 
rendered back to front so that objects properly occlude one another.

Just for grins, I'm going to download and test the 5.0.0 version, just 
to see if it's equally borked.

Following up my own post, 5.0.0 exhibits the same behavior.

Cells in CTH take up some amount of volume (in 3D), meaning that there is no single [X,Y,Z] coordinate to give. Perhaps your user is looking for the [X,Y,Z] at the center of the cell, in which case the Cell Centers filter will do just that.

Perhaps they have been writing client-side scripts to get at the metadata but now want access to the full dataset?

Hi Andy,

I used first approach and fix the issue using following customised
coprocessorinitializewithpython function. In this case, i converted type
of communicator coming from Fortran to C using MPI_Comm_f2c call. Now, the
code works without any problem. Thanks for your kindly help.

extern "C" void my_coprocessorinitializewithpython_(int *fcomm, const
char* pythonScriptName, const char strarr[][255], int *size) {
  if (pythonScriptName != NULL) {
    if (!g_coprocessor) {
      g_coprocessor = vtkCPProcessor::New();
      MPI_Comm handle = MPI_Comm_f2c(*fcomm);
      vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm *Comm = new
vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm(&handle);
      g_coprocessor->Initialize(*Comm);
      vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline> pipeline =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline>::New();
      pipeline->Initialize(pythonScriptName);
      g_coprocessor->AddPipeline(pipeline);
      //pipeline->FastDelete();
    }

    if (!g_coprocessorData) {
      g_coprocessorData = vtkCPDataDescription::New();
      // must be input port for all model components and for all dimensions
      for (int i = 0; i < *size; i++) {
        g_coprocessorData->AddInput(strarr[i]);
        std::cout << "adding input port [" << i << "] = " << strarr[i] <<
std::endl;
      }
    }
  }
}

Hi, all

when I started a remote server(./pvserver), it failed with the ERRORs

Then I tried to use a reverse connection, but it still didn't work like
below. Is there anyone who knows what happened on my remote connection ?
Thanks in advance!
BTW, I used the paraview binary installer:
ParaView-5.0.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz on both
sides(client/server).

Hi Hengxing,
which commands did you run precisely on which machine? Did you check that
port 11111 is available on the server for the client or, in the case of the
reverse connection, available on the client for the server?

when I started a remote server(./pvserver), it failed with the ERRORs

The errors with vtkClientSocket seem like a problem of a client, was is
really pvserver, which failed with those messages?

Peter,

ParaView already supports changing the master. A "master" can make any
other connected process the new master. Once that happens the new
master can start changing pipelines etc.

Try running both the client and server with --cslog=<filename> and
tail those files. You'll see a log for messages being sent between
client and server.

Just adding it to the plugin under SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES in
add_paraview_plugin will do the trick.

Hi all,

Thanks for all the replies and sudden bug report action ;-)

I haven't had the time to check the bugs that got updated, will try to 
do that soon.

There seem to be a huge number of reported bugs for ParaView (and a few for VTK), ranging from crashes to incorrect functionality to feature requests. Over the years I have entered more than two dozen myself, but was always surprised about the lack of response, especially when reporting things that were easily reproducible and/or crasher bugs (e.g. VTK #10528, ParaView #15291, ParaView #15944, ParaView #13802).

A second "handicap" in this respect is undoubtedly the fact that KitWare is a business and so has different priorities than a bunch of hackers working mostly in their spare time on their pet project.

I report bugs quite often for other open-source projects (and try to enter concise reports with a testcase), but with ParaView/VTK I get the feeling it's not worth the trouble, which is a shame. Actually getting back on topic: the one or two times I reported a bug in VisIt I got a reply and fix quickly!
>
> Furthermore, ParaView seems quite easy to segfault and it happens even with moderately complex pipelines and modest datasets. Parallel volume rendering has been broken for ages (or is it fixed these days? Can't tell, ParaView #13801 did not get any replies). Some examples shown on the wiki cause Python errors (e.g. #15291, #12796). And so on.
>
> So the comment above about code quality making ParaView stand out from other visualization tools is a bit a stretch in my opinion. I would certainly not call ParaView "stable". In fact, in the introductory scivis courses we teach with ParaView we always warn people that crashes are to be expected regularly and even during the course assignments they sometimes happen.
>
> The development process as mentioned by Berk is indeed impressive, but seems mostly focused on preventing regressions in existing functionality. This is a worthy goal in itself, but is only one half of the story when it comes to guaranteeing code quality. The things that aren't working (see bug reports) are maybe not getting the attention they deserve, but are apparently things folks run into when using ParaView, so they signal something real.
>
> After the stuff above I wanted to finish on a less critical note :) I prefer using ParaView over VisIt mostly because of being able to build a pipeline and prefer ParaView's nice single-window GUI over VisIt's a-window-here-a-window-there-a-window-everywhere approach. They are both good and useful tools and are work-horses for scivis tasks. Whenever I get a request from an HPC user which one to use I recommend ParaView, as it is easier to get into for basic scivis work.

Dear Utkarsh,
to have some basis for this discussion, I'd like to mention that my
knowledge on the collaboration functionality is limited to what is shown in
http://vimeo.com/34480656 and to the class reference
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/classvtkSMCollaborationManager.html.
Everything else I am trying to understand by debugging. Or does additional
documentation (design documents, message exchange protocols, ...) exist?

So, although the concept of promoting different clients as master is
obvious from the video above, something more is needed to allow any slave
to change the pipeline automatically by permission of the master: the slave
(S) must request to be promoted as master to the current master (M), M must
promote S as master, S operates on the pipeline, and S must promote M as
master again.
After some thoughts, my suggested option 2) may be easier and more secure:
S would send its intended operations to M, and M executes them. Here, the
question is whether I have to invent a new streaming language to encode
pipeline changes that S wants to send to M? Or can S just build the
pipeline as intended and use some available serialization to send this
pipeline state to M?

Any of the options requires some additional messages to be send between
slaves and master. This is what I am trying to figure out. The --cslog
options looks very useful, but a short overview which classes are involved
in sending custom messages including an encoded pipeline state would be
even more helpful.

Thanks
Peter

Sorry my friend. Nothing more than what I previously mentioned on the

(My knowledge on how several of these things is quite rusty  -- so
bear with me). I'd suggest look at pqCollaborationManager and see how
it implements chat messages. You should be able to extend that concept
to add support for custom messages.

Why not make M aware of the code that needs to be executed and then
just trigger those through higher level messages from S? This is like
your first option, but you're only sending coarse messages eg. "Do
Action1" etc to M.

Follow the code path  from  pqCollaborationManager::onChatMessage().
It calls pqServer::sendToOtherClients(...) with a vtkSMMessage object
created.

Well, I see that I'll need some more debug sessions to get this solved.

>Why not make M aware of the code that needs to be executed and then

Yes, this would be my option 2). "Make M aware of the code" means that I
need some interpreted language that I send from S to M. (I would probably
not use a separate message to execute the transmitted code, but rather
execute it as soon as it has completely arrived. But this is a minor
detail.)

What I don't understand is why only the master is allowed to add sources
etc. My attempts run fine if I start ParaView as master and then add
sources through my custom (slave) clients. Is the missing thread safety in
VTK the problem, so that I could run into synchronization issues if several
clients request changes on the server "at the same time"? (If so, I'd
suggest that the server rejects messages which are not originating from the
master.)

There is this one remaining problem that ParaView seems not to initialize
correctly if a different master has set up a pipeline earlier. Did you have
a chance to look into this issue? I might also file a bug report, if you
prefer.

Thanks
Peter

Hi Paul,

This is very valid criticism. As I read it, there are two parts to the
issue.

> How bugs are handled.

You are absolutely right that we have done a poor job responding to
community bug reports and fixes. Both on VTK & ParaView bug trackers but
especially on the ParaView side. We have been having some discussions on
how to address this. Part of the solution is going to be on the tool side.
We will move away from the Mantis bug tracker to the Gitlab bug tracker and
setup some processes to maintain the bug list more easily. We will also
expire bugs more quickly to manage the list in a reasonable way. The other
part is to change our attitude towards community bugs (as opposed to bugs
Kitware is funded to fix). We have always had resources to go after a
modest amount of such bugs but culturally it has not been a priority.
Utkarsh and I will work on ways of addressing this. More on this in the
near future...

> Stability of ParaView.

I don't (fully) agree with your assessment here. ParaView is very stable,
within a particular expanding feature set that the community actively
supports. Two issues here: 1. It is hard to define what this feature set
is, 2. ParaView is open ended so it supports a much larger feature set out
of box. We support a large community that uses ParaView day-to-day for
their production work and we have clear evidence (feedback) that ParaView
has grown very stable. These folks usually leverage a small subset of what
can be done with ParaView - the same feature set provided by many other vis
tools. If you go beyond this set, you venture into areas that are not
tested for all different combinations and because of the previous issue of
how we address (don't) community bugs, issues are not always addressed
here. We will work at doing better addressing bugs here but it will never
be perfect. We will never be able to gracefully handle input files that are
out of spec for example. This is probably the #1 reason ParaView crashes.
Nor will we able to handle all cases where ParaView runs out of memory (for
example because someone converted a regular grid to an unstructured grid
through clipping). It is simply not possible to provide an open-ended tool,
which is a light layer on top of VTK, and support stability of every
infinite combination. Let's not even get started with what one can do using
Python :-)

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] Transparent background in python scripts
Message-ID: <576813D4.8090804@gmail.com>

Hi!

How can I save screenshots with a transparent (alpha channel based)
background from a python script?

Currently, I'm using this command to save screenshots:
> SaveScreenshot('image.png', magnification=3, view=renderView)
But this does not write the alpha channel information.


Using "File/ Save Screenshot" in the Paraview GUI, the screenshots
have the alpha channel information saved correctly when I setting "Edit/
Settings/ General/ Transparent Background".

I'm using ParaView 5.0.1 on a 64bit Linux workstation with the latest
Nvidia driver (367.27).

Hi,

Glad to hear that this is working for you and thanks for sharing how you
did it! This is definitely a corner case that few Catalyst users/developers
will ever care about so I'm glad that the Catalyst API is flexible enough
to handle this.

Subject: [Paraview] Questions on Paraview with 3D vector fields
Message-ID: <1ebea75c3aae498dbb95b1f927407aff@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Jim,

It looks like you are asking two questions.

The first question is about using the glyph filter. I'm not sure what the confusion is. The arrow glyph filter works equal well with polygons and polyhedral. I have no trouble loading in a 3D dataset with 3D cells and cell-centered data. I just select the arrow glyph and everything works fine. In short, I cannot replicate what your issue is. Perhaps you can give more information.

As far as a fly through, yes it is possible in ParaView although, admittingly, the controls are not very good. To add a camera path, first open the Animation View (View -> Animation View). Then add a track to the Animation View for "Camera, Follow Path". After that, double click the track to bring up the keyframes dialog. From there you can double click "Path..." to get yet another dialog box to edit the path. Click "Camera Position" and then click back to the main ParaView window to edit the camera path.

-Ken

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Questions on Paraview with 3D vector fields

Hello All:

I'm working with 3D vector fields (2 of them in the same space) and want to do a fly through, set the center to be one of the arrow glyphs, and do some calculations on both fields using the calculator. I can't seem to do any of these. Any ideas?

It looks like the center selection was designed to work with polymeshes. 
The arrow glyphs just can't be selected. Is there any way to fake out Paraview and place something that the selector can see?

I saw fly through mentioned on some forum but no solution. I can place a line into my space. Is there some way to use the line as a camera path? 
I'm really interested in fly throughs in the program, not watching them as a movie. There's just too many things to change to make it a movie and not take forever to make/look at them.

The calculator looks like it only hooks up to one vector field at a time. Is there some object linking trick or running one field through an intermediate calculation that would make both fields visible to the calculator?

Any help appreciated.

-J

Hi folks,

We are planning a ParaView bug hackathon on July 13. Going forward, we
would like this to be a monthly event during which the community comes
together to address bugs reported to the tracker. It will be an all day
event that we will host physically at Kitware Headquarters in Clifton Park,
NY as well as online via Google Hangout. All are welcome to attend as long
as they know the code base enough to fix bugs.

Any questions? Comments? Any potential issue with the date?

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Minor bug in OPENFOAM filter
Message-ID: <AM4PR08MB1188876E7BD0171D10755DF88B2B0@AM4PR08MB1188.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

We have come across a minor but annoying bug in the Paraview OPENFOAM reader.

The component of the Paraview OPENFOAM parser that reads boundary conditions has been set up to always expect another number where a scalar is encountered in the following configuration:

(1.111 ###

when you follow a bracket-scalar with another bracket like this

(1.111 (

an exception is thrown and the field is not loaded. However, if the leading number is an integer, then it copes fine:

(1 (###

So it simply doesn't parse a scalar followed by a bracket. Most of such instances are not relevant to the display of data as they concern table inputs for time varying vector boundary conditions. The current workaround is to always use integers in interpolation input tables, but obviously this is not ideal. To reproduce the issue, simply add the following entry to any boundary condition for any volumetric field:

RandomEntry table (1.1 ( 1 2 3));

It will result in an "Error reading line XXX ... " output and the field that the entry was added to will not be loaded. If you change it to:

RandomEntry table (1 ( 1 2 3));

Then it works fine. I can provide a small case that reproduces the issue if the above is not clear.

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Table to structured grid problem
Message-ID: <CAE3taFBz2Yfwyqg6N5NjAiJzFuXd3nJMTNZUyym9nCd2qbgY7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have tried to generate a structured grid from a csv file comprising
51 layers with X and Y as Long and Lat respectively.

(1) Load CSV file
(2) Filter -> TableToStructuredGrid
set dimensions:
x = 0 - 115
y = 0 - 50
z = 0 - 50

This all works fine, but the plot is skewed oddly in the gridding, as
in the outline view does not show a nice regular shaped outline but
rather a jagged edge, almost like it is trying to join points on the
front and back faces (see test picture).

TableTo Points worked fine and all points were placed correctly.

Paraview 5.0.0 64-bit Windows

Any ideas what might be going on? I never had this problem before and
the CSV file is fine.

Thanks
Lester

Lester,

What are the dimensions of the grid in the table? Are they 116x51x51 or 115x50x50?

The extent that you set in the TableToStructuredGrid filter uses inclusive indices. That means they should go from 0 to one less than the size of the dimension. So if your grid is 115x50x50, then the extent should be set as
X = 0 - 114
Y = 0 - 49
Z = 0 - 49

Jim,

I think I'm pretty confused about what you are trying to do. I don't know what you mean by "pick center on one of the glyphs." Can you back up and describe in detail how you are setting up your visualization. What you use to read the data, what filters you apply, how you set up the display, and the interactions you are doing.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Questions on Paraview with 3D vector fields

Ken:

I'm loading the vectors from a file (raw data format, 3 floats). I extract subset and make glyphs from that. When I try to pick center on one of the glyphs, I get the following message: "vtkSMRenderViewProxy
(0000000000056914B0): Snapping to the surface is not available therefore the camera focal point will be used to determine the depth of the picking."  This is the only reason I want to select a glyph. I've tried the point selection options that I can find.

I'm afraid animation is non-existent for my case. I have custom .vtp files that contain lines. I want to move the camera along that path. 
When I double click on the camera track I can see that it has the basics, a path and a focus (thanks for that, by the way), but I don't see a way to get my data into the camera track. It doesn't even look like there is a cut and paste option. I can write custom files for this sort of thing, but I just don't know how to get things to interact with my path data.

I have a similar problem with data display; I want to turn on vector glyphs around my path, but this line (I think Paraview considers it a point set) doesn't seem to be a first class object... there isn't a way to calculate using a line and a vector field or even two vector fields for that matter. It's starting to look like I have to learn to program yet another environment.

Thanks for any help you can give.

Dear Paraview developers,
congratulations to the 5.1 release and thanks for your hard work!

I currently try to package it for openSuse and I stumbled upon the
required CMake version. What's the reason for this harsh requirement?
Wouldn't be 3.0 or similar be sufficient?
Currently all stable releases are excluded. I hope you can reduce the
required version for 5.1.1.

Please see this discussion in the paraview-developers mailing list
archive that gives reasons for updating the required version of CMake
to 3.5:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview-developers/2016-April/004229.html

Based on that discussion, loosening the requirement to CMake 3.0 does
not appear to be feasible. The latest version of CMake in openSUSE to
my perhaps na?ve eye appears to be 3.3.2:

https://software.opensuse.org/package/cmake

I'm not sure we can go back that far - is there a chance you can try
building ParaView with CMake 3.3.2? You need only modify the
cmake_minimum_required command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file.

- Cory

Hi Cory,
thanks for link to the developer mailing list discussion. I think CMake 3.3 is better then
3.5, because at least the last Leap 42.1 release provides that.
I patched ParaView to require CMake 3.0 and it builds fine. I will package ParaView 5.1
that way and hope you reduce the requirement to CMake 3.3 for the next time.

CMake 3.0 helped to clean some code paths, nothing really complicated. You have
to check whether you can get other improvements from newer CMake version by
copying the relevant parts and calling that instead of the built-in functions.
So 3.0 might be feasible and reasonable.

Bye
Christoph

Dear Utkarsh,
can you give a quick update whether the suggested bug fix is likely to be
solved:

Otherwise I'll have to find a workaround like having my client queue all
pipeline commands until ParaView has connected and only then execute them
so that ParaView can follow the correct pipeline state.

Hi Ken,

The data dimensions are: 116 x 51 x 51 (xyz), so the model extent was set to:
X = 0 - 115, Y = 0 - 50, Z = 0 -50
These extents work fine and no errors assciated with the input, and no
missing nodes. The model comprises 51 layers and each is 116 x 51 and
all have the total 5916.

Not sure what is going on because loading as points is fine.

[Paraview] XML plugin syntax for FileChooser.



Hi,



I would like to create a custom programmable python filter  to write some
calculation results in a file.

I?ve tried to use the following XML plugin syntax to define a FileChooser
button and help the user select the path of the output file :

<StringVectorProperty
  label="Path"
  command="SetParameter"
  name="QFileName"
  initial_string="QFileName"
  number_of_elements="1"
  panel_visibility="default">
  <FileListDomain name="files" />
  <Documentation>Path of the output file</Documentation>
  <Hints>
    <FileChooser extensions="inp" file_description="APDL input file" />
  </Hints>
</StringVectorProperty>

This create a text field with an associated file chooser button as I wanted.

But it seems that I can only select existing files.

Is-there a way to tell Paraview that this path is an output path and not an
input path ?

Best regards,

As a quick note, each layer is ordered bottom left to top right. The
region is defined as:
west = 117, East = 128.5, South = -11, North = -6

Subject: [Paraview] Automatically updating time variable dataset
Message-ID: <CAOyh2eYmdc2UmjC-aCvLYSk4UGQARJbQgkP5Orc7qmPjniibJQ@mail.gmail.com>

A question to the specialists:
Can Paraview refresh its view automatically when a dataset updates its
state?

A plugin starts a background thread that calculates new dataset values
periodically. Each time a calculation step is finished, all filters and
views connected to the generated dataset should be updated. (Something
similar is done in a live catalyst connection. But catalyst has a serious
drawback for large datasets. It runs in a separate process, so that the
datasets cannot be in shared memory, but have to be transferred, requiring
redundant storage space and wasted network bandwidth.) Although paraview is
said to be not thread safe, it should't be problematic as long as access to
VTK classes is limited to the main thread. The difficult question is, how
can paraview be notified that a plugin has updated its output while the
main thread only waits for GUI or network events when idle?

Any ideas or recommendations?
Conny

Hello

A work around would be to declare two (fake) timestep in your reader and
play the animation in loop in paraview.

Think I sorted it by reordering the data:
sort(z) -> sort(y) -> sort(x) (in Excel)
Gives the volume rendered properly. So is there a specific ordering
scheme to follow?

Lester,

Yes, in structured grids in VTK the x dimension changes fastest, then y, then z.

Subject: [Paraview]  Minor bug in OPENFOAM import filter
Message-ID: <AM4PR08MB1188BAC0AF0C79B9A3D3BC9B8B2C0@AM4PR08MB1188.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

We have come across a minor, but annoying bug in the Paraview OPENFOAM reader.

The component of the Paraview OPENFOAM parser that reads boundary conditions has been set up to always expect another number where a scalar is encountered in the following configuration:

(1.111 ###

when you follow a bracket-scalar with another bracket like this

(1.111 (

an exception is thrown and the field is not loaded. However, if the leading number is an integer, then it copes fine:

(1 (###

So it simply doesn't parse a scalar followed by a bracket. Most of such instances are not relevant to the display of data as they concern table inputs for time varying vector boundary conditions. The current workaround is to always use integers in interpolation input tables, but obviously this is not ideal. To reproduce the issue, simply add the following entry to any boundary condition for any volumetric field:

RandomEntry table (1.1 ( 1 2 3));

It will result in an "Error reading line XXX ... " output and the field that the entry was added to will not be loaded. If you change it to:

RandomEntry table (1 ( 1 2 3));

Then it works fine. I can provide a small case that reproduces the issue if the above is not clear.

Best regards,

Eugene de Villiers

Hi Eugene,

I'll take a look at this. I'm not terribly familiar with openfoam files, so
if you could send me that small example to reproduce the bug I'd appreciate
it :)

Thanks,

Hi Eugene and all,

Sorry for not giving a concrete solution but just a comment. The
current reader handles the complex OpenFOAM format without a priori
knowledge of exact format of a specific dictionary entry. With further
growing complexity and format extensions made over OpenFOAM versions,
there can always be such a problem especially when reading entries
required by certain types of boundary conditions. Either implementing
such knowledge or skipping the entire dictionary entries other than
the "value" entries in the boudaryFields could be an idea though.

Ah! No, the current implementation doesn't support that, but if you
want to extend the code to do so and push a merge-request on ParaView
(d) -- which would be awesome -- here are a few pointers:

1. Extend pqFileChooserWidget (a) to add support for non-existing files.
2. Extend pqStringVectorPropertyWidget to (b) add support for new
attribute on the <FileChooser /> hint to support non-exisiting files
and if and when it's present, tell pqFileChooseWidget  using the API
added in 1.
3. Update PropertyHints.md (c) to document the new hint attribute added in 2.

Thanks

Hi Dave,

Sure thing. Attached find a small case. Just load the ?case.foam? file from inside the directory once you have uncompressed it. You will see the error pop up (I am running Paraview 5.0.0).

Thanks for your help,

Eugene

Perhaps I'm just missing it but I can't find any documentation for the 
Map Projection filter.

It looks as if it's producing a Mercator projection but I wouldn't swear 
to it.

Also, is there any way when using it to retain the latitude/longitude 
values for the axes?

Any guidance would be appreciated.

Thanx.

Hi Takuya!

The problem is that not all boundaries have "value" entries. zeroGradient, fixedGradient, symmetry, empty - none have values. It is a frustrating inconsistency for 3rd-party interfaces, but that's the way it is unfortunately. 

If you want a reasonable and straight-forward solution, I would say check for a "value" entry and if you don't find it assume zero gradient. From our side it is much easier to modify boundaries to write value fields than to change the reader to deal with exceptions and new formats. The "value" entry format is also well defined (i.e. there are only two permutations), so it is easier to support. 

I know nothing about the parser, but I should note that it is entirely possible that multiple "value" keywords might exist in a boundary at different levels of the input structure. It is important that only the first value entry on the base level of the boundary condition is actually identified as the face value correlated "value" entry. So some kind of interpretation of OPENFOAM syntax would be required - a simple pattern-match won't work.

Eugene

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 5.0.1 - Registering new view
Message-ID: <5DF928D22AC3AC4B964903E98F2E54515B5A7C2D@sooty3.win.ara>

Hi

I am trying to figure out how can I register a new view under a name different  than the default "YXYChartView" which replaces the default representation in Paraview,  but I am either getting the  assertion failure "ASSERT: "pqPreferredView" in file /spare/Andrzej/packages/ParaView-5.0-source/Qt/ApplicationComponents/pqApplyBehavior.cxx, line 277" when 
do things like this 

	<ProxyGroup name="views">
		<ContextViewProxy base_proxygroup="internal_views"
			base_proxyname="ARAXYChartViewBase4Axes" class="ARAPVXYChartViewClass"
			name="ARAXYChartView" label=" My  Line Chart View" processes="client|renderserver|dataserver"
			representation_name="ARAXYChartRepresentation" post_creation="SetChartTypeToLine">
		</ContextViewProxy>		
	</ProxyGroup>

or more specifically like this

	<ProxyGroup name="views">
		<ContextViewProxy base_proxygroup="internal_views"
			base_proxyname="XYChartViewBase4Axes" class="vtkPVXYChartViewClass"
			name="ARAXYChartView" label=" My  Line Chart View" processes="client|renderserver|dataserver"
			representation_name="XYChartRepresentation" post_creation="SetChartTypeToLine">
		</ContextViewProxy>		
	</ProxyGroup>

and then

	<ProxyGroup name="filters">
		<SourceProxy class="vtkPassThrough" label="ARA Plot Data"
			name="ARAPlotAttributes">
			<InputProperty command="SetInputConnection" name="Input">
				<ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
					<Group name="sources" />
					<Group name="filters" />
				</ProxyGroupDomain>
				<DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
					<DataType value="vtkDataObject" />
				</DataTypeDomain>
				<Documentation>The input.</Documentation>
			</InputProperty>
			<Hints>
				<ShowInMenu category="ARA Extensions" show_in_toolbar="0" />
				<View type="ARAXYChartView" />
				<Plotable />
			</Hints>
		</SourceProxy>
	</ProxyGroup>

Is there a way to register a new view at all ?

Thank you,

Andrzej

Should there be a tag for v5.1.0 for the Superbuild?    I was looking at
the Superbuild wiki and I should be able to checkout the Superbuild using
a new tag - unless those instructions are now obsolete?

This is not practical. We have tried this before. The data are updated in a
background thread, so that data to be displayed are always available
without any delay. The continuous redrawing uses 100% cpu. Even with a
refresh rate reduced to 20 updates per second (sleep commands) cpu usage is
still 70%. Slower refresh rates cause unwanted effects for calculations
that vary quickly. This load is predominantly caused by the communication
overhead and almost independent of the actual rendering work (tested with a
50x50 pixel window and single triangle dataset).

Does anybody have a real solution how a background thread can wake up the
main thread when data has changed? A continuous trigger from the GUI wastes
too many resources. An event based mechanism is needed.

I think the easiest way to check this would be to set the minimum to 3.3
and run against 3.5 to see if any POLICY warnings are triggered for the
way openSUSE builds ParaView. If they are, the old version is probably
silently doing something wrong.

You just need to tell ParaView which pqView subclass to create for
your view proxy e.g. if pqContextView class would work for your case,
then you'd add something like the following in your CMakeList.txt

add_pqproxy(OUTIFACES OUTSRCS
   TYPE pqContextView
   XML_GROUP views
   XML_NAME ARAXYChartView)

I just did exactly that, no warning from CMake occurs. So we can assume
everything would be fine with CMake 3.3. Should I create an according
Github merge request?

On behalf of a colleague of mine working with ParaView 4.3.1

 

Hello,


I am using an algorithm doing calculation on points and their neighbours and
I find the results of those points locators to be strange. To test it I made
a simple algorithm counting how many neighbours each point has.
When I create a plane and set its x and y resolution to 100 each, all points
should have the same number of neighbours except on the sides. However
vtkPointLocator, vtkKdTreePointLocator and vtkOctreePointLocator do not find
the same number of neighbours for each point.

Here is the algorithm that I use to get the number of neighbors each points
has :
import vtk

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
nb_pts = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()

# Point locator
loc = vtk.vtkPointLocator()
#loc = vtk.vtkOctreePointLocator()
#loc = vtk. vtkKdTreePointLocator()

loc.SetDataSet(pdi)
loc.BuildLocator()

pts = pdi.GetPoints()

neighbours = vtk.vtkTypeInt64Array()
neighbours.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
neighbours.SetNumberOfTuples(nb_pts)
neighbours.SetName('neighbours')

for k in range(nb_pts):

    xp = pdi.GetPoint(k)

    id_list = vtk.vtkIdList()

    loc.FindPointsWithinRadius(0.01,xp,id_list)
    loc.Update()

    N = id_list.GetNumberOfIds()
    neighbours.InsertTuple1(k,N)


self.GetOutput().GetPointData().AddArray(neighbours)

 

You will find attached sample picture describing the result I get with each
point locator.

thank you very much

Message-ID: <82b57ab76af748eeba6c5f91a1cbc743@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

The problem you are facing is with the precision of floating point numbers. The way you are setting up your problem is that the points are exactly 0.01 units away from each other. When you ask the point locator for all points within a radius of 0.01, then what happens when a point is exactly 0.01 units away from the center? That depends on what happens in the limited precision of your computer's floating point values. Sometimes it will be 0.01 + epsilon, in which case the point will be considered inside the radius. Sometimes it will be 0.01 - epsilon, in which case the point will be considered outside the radius. This is a well known issue with floating point numbers. There are lots of resources describing it. A quick Google search gave this article: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html.

Anyway, the simple solution is to increase the radius in FindPointsWithinRadius by a small amount. Changing the line to:

    loc.FindPointsWithinRadius(0.01,xp,id_list)

fixes the problem for all point locators.

BTW, although perhaps convenient, using a point locator to find neighbors is not the most robust way to do it. It would be safer to use the find neighbor facilities of the different vtkDataSet classes.

Utkarsh, et al.,

There is a problem with missing cell variables in v5.1.

To replicate it load bake.e.    In v4.4 and v5.0.1, there are 3 cell variables, Object IDs, Global Element IDs, and processor_id, which can be loaded from the file.

In v5.1, there are only 2 cell variables available for loading,  Object IDs, and Global Element IDs.

In my case I have ~60 cell variables which are missing and only Object IDs and Global Element IDs are available to load.

This makes v5.1 unusable for us.

Could not reproduce this (see attached image). Can you try running with "-dr"?

Message-ID: <CAGgSO3jX7Lnkz5yiHWJCQK8dPKLEQ-V9A2BzGKKWU6F3NcMkiA@mail.gmail.com>

on my paraview 5.0.1 64-bit on Windows-7
(from precompiled distribution at paraview.org)

What is the reason that I get the following errors when instantiating a
Python Calculator filter on a single input of type UnstructuredGrid:

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 4, in <module>

File "C:\Program
Files\ParaView\lib\paraview-5.0\site-packages\paraview\calculator.py", line
102, in execute

File "C:\Program

74, in compute

retVal = eval(expression, globals(), mylocals)

File "<string>", line 0

^

SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing


What is being parsed?   The filter input is an internal paraview data set.
The input was active at the time the filter was instantiated.  The error
occurs as soon as the filter is selected and added to the pipeline.
I can attach the input dataset if requested.
Thanks.

I can import (raw binary) a 3D file (1178x1202x1000x1float), extract a 
subset and display it using sphere glyphs where the spheres are too 
large. However, when I set the scale mode to scalar and 1, the program 
displays nothing. The display area is just background color. I can't 
turn anything on or off. If I delete everything and then retry without 
the scaling, I still see nothing.

This looks like some sort of workspace corruption.  It looks like a bug 
to me.

Sure, sounds like a plan.

@Utkarsh, any foreseeable problems reducing the CMake required version to 3.3?

@Ben, I assume all the dashboard machines are running CMake 3.5. Do
you think we should downgrade one to CMake 3.3?

Dean,

Do you have "Auto Apply" on? This may be leading to the problem - this
filter is added to the pipeline and the Apply button is effectively
pressed right away while the Python Calculator expression is empty.
Having "Auto Apply" on, I can reproduce the error message you get.

Can you try disabling "Auto Apply" and report how that goes? We really
should handle the empty expression better for this very case.

Thanks,
Cory

Thank you for the patch. There is still something missing. If I modify the
custom client such that it adds an object every half second or so, then
first start this clients and then ParaView after a few seconds, ParaView
misses one of the objects. ParaView finds those objects that are added
before ParaView starts and those that are added later. But during ParaView
startup one of the objects is lost.
I'll see if I can make this reproducible and send a code example in the
next days.

You just need to tell ParaView which pqView subclass to create for your view proxy e.g. if pqContextView class would work for your case, then you'd add something like the following in your CMakeList.txt

add_pqproxy(OUTIFACES OUTSRCS
   TYPE pqContextView
   XML_GROUP views
   XML_NAME ARAXYChartView)

Hi all,

I use ParaView 5.1.0 version installed from a binary file
ParaView-5.1.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit.exe. Unfortunately, this version's
"ParaView Online Help" launched by clicking on Question mark button is not
available because
the opened window is blank. This problem did not occur with 5.0.1 version.

I think we'll want 3.5 in the (hopefully) near future, so if
distributions don't have a new enough CMake, they can patch it down to
3.3 in the meantime. A comment might be worthwhile.

Though I question the distro update policies surrounding where ParaView
is aggressively pushed forward when CMake isn't. CMake is *much* better
with its backwards compatibility, but I guess it's down to maintainer
style to some extent.

I was actually going to upgrade them to 3.6's rc today to test it out.

Can you let me know how it goes?  I just pulled the latest versions of 
Paraview & cmake and want to build under VS2015. I'm going to work on it 
over the weekend. If you're doing the same, I could use any 
configuration tricks you discover.

Utkarsh - I?ve having trouble getting a build using 5.1 ?.   I?m running a
?make install? and it seems to be looking for install/lib/paraview-5.1 but
what actually exists in the build directory is install/lib/paraview-5.0  ?
not sure if my superbuild is hosed or if there?s something wrong deep in
one of the configuration files.

Hi Ben,
I don't think it is a good idea to ask for the latest version. Only developers like us have
a current version of CMake installed. From already released distributions nobody
provides CMake 3.5.

Sorry, there is a misunderstanding. We provide packages for already released
distributions. We cannot change the CMake version shipped with them. By
requesting a too recent version, there won't be updated versions of
ParaView for users of released openSuses any more.
I know they can download the binaries you provide or get a more recent
CMake and compile it themselves. You have to weight your inconveniences
against the ones of your users.

Bye
Christoph

Utkarsh - I?ve having trouble getting a build using 5.1 ?.   I?m running a
?make install? and it seems to be looking for install/lib/paraview-5.1 but what actually exists in the build directory is install/lib/paraview-5.0  ? not sure if my superbuild is hosed or if there?s something wrong deep in one of the configuration files.

Just make sure you check out the latest superbuild (or the release
branch). It has all the fixes needed to ensure the internal harcoded
version is set to 5.1.0

My thought here is that building ParaView is much harder than CMake, so
it's not a super high barrier to require a custom-built CMake to build a
custom ParaView build.

Ah, so this is more like a PPA? Yeah, I guess overriding the CMake from
those wouldn't be a great thing to recommend.

Talking with Utkarsh, we can move the version down since that's our
actual minimum version. However, if things get added to ParaView's build
that require newer CMake support, bumping the minimum version would not
be a huge blocker.

I thought we had a VS2015 dashboard, but I see it is just VS2013
(thinking back, probably because there isn't a Qt4 build against 2015 on
that machine). They're not that different for setup though. I'll look at
getting the other Windows machine onto the dashboard setup here today.

I don't expect any issues, but if you find any, feel free to email the
list or open issues.

Thanks,

Hello,

In Paraview 5.1.0 with OpenGL2, I have black slices throughout the model when opacity is on in parallel mode (see attached picture). When switching depth peeling off, the black slices disappear but the image gets blurred and some pixels glow with random colours. I can't reproduce it with 5.0.0, my NVidia driver is 361.42. Does anyone else experience similar behaviour?

Is there a version with the "Legacy" rendering backend available?  I 
find that it does a better job with rendering, including the depth 
sorting issues I've discussed here previously.

I don't notice any significant difference in performance between the 
OpenGL2 version and the putative Legacy version.

Interesting, I haven't seen this before. Does it happen for all depth
peeled transparent rendering, or just certain scenes? If it's only certain
scenes, can you provide a state file or details on the scene?

Also, which OS is this?

Thanks,

It doesn?t happen all the time, I suppose you need a fairly large surface dataset. I managed to reproduce the problem on a wavelet source (attached state file), try increasing the number of elements if you do not see any artifacts. I have bult Paraview from source on OpenSuse 13.1 but also cross-checked with the Linux binaries from Paraview.org and had same issues. There was no problem with the osmesa-llvm flavor though.

Thanks -- I've loaded this up and can reproduce the error. The error occurs
in vtkFoamEntryValue::ReadList, which contains the following comment:

// general-purpose list reader - guess the type of the list and read

// it. only supports ascii format and assumes the preceding '(' has

// already been thrown away.  the reader supports nested list with

// variable lengths (e. g. `((token token) (token token token)).'

// also *supports compound of tokens and lists (e. g. `((token token)*

// *token)') only if a list comes as the first value.*


So the list (1.1 (1 2 3)) is being parsed as a list, and our reader
only supports lists

containing mixed tokens / lists if the lists precede the tokens. And
indeed, changing

file to read ((1 2 3) 1.1) will eliminate the error. The current
parser assumes that the

remainder of the list will also be scalars and attempts to read them
in -- then it

chokes when it encounters a '(' instead of another scalar.


Again, I'm not familiar with the openFOAM format, but would writing
the list with the

nested list first be feasible on your end? I'm not sure if this is a
format restriction or

an implementation detail of our reader.


Alternatively, I saw some discussion around skipping every entry in
boundaryField

specifications other than 'value'. This would likely be quite easy to
implement. My

only question is, would it break anything for the visualization?

I couldn't reproduce this here on arch linux with a newer nVidia driver
(367.27), so I'm suspicious that this is a driver bug that's affecting the
new depth peeling implementation.

Since you're building from source, can you try editing
VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderer.cxx, and change line 322

if (dualDepthPeelingSupported)

to

if (false)

in DeviceRenderTranslucentPolygonalGeometry, recompile using the OpenGL2
backend, and let me know if the issue goes away? I suspect it will since
both the OpenGL1 backend and OpenGL2 mesa/llvm do not use the new code.

I'll put together a patch to force the older peeling implementation via an
environment variable to make the work-around easier to apply.

Patch is here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1589

By the way, are you running paraview with remote rendering via pvserver? I
was just made aware of a similar issue with remote rendering and depth
peeling.

Dear Kenneth, thank you for your answer. Here is the message from my
colleague.

Bertrand

 

Hello, I am the colleague using ParaView 4.3.1!

 

First of all, thank you for your response, it has explained a lot of results
since I tend to forget about computer and floating point.

 

Unfortunately the physics behind my algorithm forces me to look for all the
neighbors inside a sphere of each point of my unstructured grid.

 

My curiosity has pushed me to look how the FindPointsWithinRadius function
works and I have seen that it does an inferior or equal comparison. Isn't
the equal part the source of inconsistent return values? 

I have read a more straightforward  <http://floating-point-gui.de/> website
about floating point number :  <http://floating-point-gui.de/>
http://floating-point-gui.de/  which I hope offer good information.

The page about  <http://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/> comparison
offer a way to check if two numbers are equal that seems to be accurate, I
have tried to implement it in the FindPointsWithinRadius function of
vtkPointLocator but I am not proficient at c++, vtk and your coding
guidelines, see attachment.

 

I am not sure if it is vtk responsibility to find out how to deal with those
case but I find the solution interesting.

 

Thank you!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Find points within radius

 

The problem you are facing is with the precision of floating point numbers.
The way you are setting up your problem is that the points are exactly 0.01
units away from each other. When you ask the point locator for all points
within a radius of 0.01, then what happens when a point is exactly 0.01
units away from the center? That depends on what happens in the limited
precision of your computer?s floating point values. Sometimes it will be
0.01 + epsilon, in which case the point will be considered inside the
radius. Sometimes it will be 0.01 ? epsilon, in which case the point will be
considered outside the radius. This is a well known issue with floating
point numbers. There are lots of resources describing it. A quick Google
search gave this article:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html.

 

Anyway, the simple solution is to increase the radius in
FindPointsWithinRadius by a small amount. Changing the line to:

 

    loc.FindPointsWithinRadius(0.01,xp,id_list)

 

fixes the problem for all point locators.

 

BTW, although perhaps convenient, using a point locator to find neighbors is
not the most robust way to do it. It would be safer to use the find neighbor
facilities of the different vtkDataSet classes.

On behalf of a colleague of mine working with ParaView 4.3.1

 

Hello,


I am using an algorithm doing calculation on points and their neighbours and
I find the results of those points locators to be strange. To test it I made
a simple algorithm counting how many neighbours each point has.
When I create a plane and set its x and y resolution to 100 each, all points
should have the same number of neighbours except on the sides. However
vtkPointLocator, vtkKdTreePointLocator and vtkOctreePointLocator do not find
the same number of neighbours for each point.

Here is the algorithm that I use to get the number of neighbors each points
has :
import vtk

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
nb_pts = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()

# Point locator
loc = vtk.vtkPointLocator()
#loc = vtk.vtkOctreePointLocator()
#loc = vtk. vtkKdTreePointLocator()

loc.SetDataSet(pdi)
loc.BuildLocator()

pts = pdi.GetPoints()

neighbours = vtk.vtkTypeInt64Array()
neighbours.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
neighbours.SetNumberOfTuples(nb_pts)
neighbours.SetName('neighbours')

for k in range(nb_pts):

    xp = pdi.GetPoint(k)

    id_list = vtk.vtkIdList()

    loc.FindPointsWithinRadius(0.01,xp,id_list)
    loc.Update()

    N = id_list.GetNumberOfIds()
    neighbours.InsertTuple1(k,N)


self.GetOutput().GetPointData().AddArray(neighbours)

 

You will find attached sample picture describing the result I get with each
point locator.

thank you very much

Subject: [Paraview] error when trying to hide a sphere in a python script....
Message-ID: <1466819526927.35021@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,


I am writing a python script to do some analysis on magnetic field lines, and I am trying to generate some images for a sanity check.


The first image I have attached is the type of image I am trying to produce (verification_(5.25,0,0).png).


The second image is generated in the same script.  The red and blue spheres that correspond to the ones in the first image should have been hidden, but when I try to hide them, I get the error:

(verification_(-5.25,0,0).png)

ERROR: In /Users/jjm390/src/Paraview/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Rendering/vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering.cxx, line 409
vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering (0x7fca9e4cd180): Invalid producer (0x7fca9e4e12f0) or outputPort (0)


When the final render to screen is done, the spheres are all gone, but they do not get hidden when the image is generated.

The script I wrote is attached.  Note, if you need the entire project to help figure out why it isn't working, I can share it individually.  This is the script that generates the images.

?I would appreciate any help people might be able to offer!  I am running ParaView 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.11.5.

Thanks,
Josh Murphy

It would be better if other entries like "gradient" (for Neumann-type
boundary conditions) can also be taken into account.  However it needs
a lot of work (we need to add a logic to calculate the distance from
the adjacent cell center to the boundary face etc.).  I think for now
we need to live with skipping every entry other than "value".

If I remember correctly, the reader already has a check for a "value"
entry and if not found it assumes zero gradient.

I am sure that the reader already does this as well.

It would be better if other entries like "gradient" (for Neumann-type boundary conditions) can also be taken into account.  However it needs a lot of work (we need to add a logic to calculate the distance from the adjacent cell center to the boundary face etc.).  I think for now we need to live with skipping every entry other than "value".

If I remember correctly, the reader already has a check for a "value"
entry and if not found it assumes zero gradient.

I am sure that the reader already does this as well.

Josh,

Can you narrow down the error to specific pv.Hide() call? The  error
is popping up due to something calling the Hide with arguments that
have not been setup properly. Let's isolate that and we can then trace
backwards from there. If you want to send me the reset of the code +
data, feel free to do that off line.

Is there any way that ParaView could be coded to give a better, more
helpful diagnostic than a core dump when a memory allocation fails?

In fact, could ParaView be coded to use an anonymous memory mapped file
allocation if the standard malloc() fails.  While this would result in
possibly degraded performance, at least one could get some sort of 
visualization done.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <1993301348.39398155.1467015285186.JavaMail.zimbra@inria.fr>

The mesh is 3D unstructured about a 3D cylinder. I would like to extract the surface of the cylinder. 

I have experience extracting surfaces with another code where the surfaces are defined by a variable (-3= cylinder surface). 
I do it like this: 
1-select extract surface 
2-select conductivity 
3-select threshold (choose -3 which corresponds to the cylinder surface). 

but I am using a code where the cylinder surface is NOT a predefined variable. 
How do I do I extract the surface? 
Hope my question is clear, 
Stephen

Switching to the old peeling implementation did the trick, no more issues and yes I am using remote rendering via pvserver.

It doesn?t happen all the time, I suppose you need a fairly large surface dataset. I managed to reproduce the problem on a wavelet source (attached state file), try increasing the number of elements if you do not see any artifacts. I have bult Paraview from source on OpenSuse 13.1 but also cross-checked with the Linux binaries from Paraview.org and had same issues. There was no problem with the osmesa-llvm flavor though.

I couldn't reproduce this here on arch linux with a newer nVidia driver (367.27), so I'm suspicious that this is a driver bug that's affecting the new depth peeling implementation.

Since you're building from source, can you try editing VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderer.cxx, and change line 322

if (dualDepthPeelingSupported)

to

if (false)

in DeviceRenderTranslucentPolygonalGeometry, recompile using the OpenGL2 backend, and let me know if the issue goes away? I suspect it will since both the OpenGL1 backend and OpenGL2 mesa/llvm do not use the new code.

I'll put together a patch to force the older peeling implementation via an environment variable to make the work-around easier to apply.

Patch is here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1589

By the way, are you running paraview with remote rendering via pvserver? I was just made aware of a similar issue with remote rendering and depth peeling.

I just tried on a node with an updated nvidia driver (367.27, latest for 
the specific model of GPU used) and get the same error on the server 
side with 5.0.1.

Trying 5.1.0 (binary from paraview.org for both client and server) and I 
no longer get the error and PV seems work fine in client-server mode.

This might or might not be related, but while retesting

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x30b0eb0): VTK is designed to work with OpenGL

The supported OpenGL version is 4.2.0, so I don't understand why the 
context is not 3.2 compatible:

Paul,

Can you try this:
1. Connect to pvserver started with  --use-offscreen-rendering
2. From Edit | Settings, Render View tab, set "Remote Render
Threshold" to 0.  Accept the change using OK.
3. Interact with render view.

Do you get the same segfault? If so, it's independent of what you're
rendering, but just the fact that remote rendering kicks in. We can
then debug further.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkPythonProgrammableFilter,
 could not find requested method: "SetCellArrayStatus" ?
Message-ID: <CAGgSO3hssYTAHt_qQ1GuRY37S9jOhsLNMuXJ=pjiw5fAav1R0A@mail.gmail.com>

Fellas,  can someone please point me to examples (current as of v5.0.1) of
how a PythonProgrammableFilter accesses the values of properties entered
via a DropDownList on the filter's Properties panel....

I have written a Python programmable filter which extracts user-specified
field arrays from user-specified blocks of multiple (MultiBlock) input
datasets.  I use this to perfrom statistical analysis of values from many
different simulatyions.
The filter works fine when the field array names and block numbers are
hardcoded in the script.
.
Then I used Pat Marion's python_filter_generator.py to wrap the filter in
XML and allow these values to be entered via TextBoxes in the Properties
panel.   That also works fine.  The property TextBoxes are accessible to
the Python script and I can retrieve the user-entered values.

Then I attempted to change the field array input widget from a textbox to a
DropDownList of cell arrays with checkboxes for selection, following the
example in http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Drop_down_list.
The DropDownList does appear correctly, populated correctly, along with
checkboxes for selecting items from the list.  However when I hit Apply I
get the following error:

I looked at the examples in
ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/readers.xml
as suggested, but nowhere do I see examples of how a Python script accesses
the user's selections (only examples of the XML code is shown, not the
Python scripts).  I also perused the site-packages subdirectory of my
installation, but those are all compiled Python and of no help.

I'm sure if I just see some Python code examples I can get this working.  I
have attached my filter if that helps...
many thanks for your help.

Attached a fixed version. I've also change the "Script" to just print
the value for sFields which is a array of selected array names. You'll
need to update your code accordingly. Note, if the user selected
nothing then sFields will not be defined. So you may want to handle
that in your code as well.

Hello,

Paraview crashes everytime I try to import a point cloud (.PLY) file.The
same problem occurs when it is a .PLY file exported from Paraview. Any idea
on how to solve that problem?

Hello,

On what kind of input does the "interpolating point cloud" does work?
I imported a VRML point cloud and even extracted the points of interest,
but the interpolation tools are grayed out and cannot be used.

As soon as I set the threshold to 0 the warning about the OpenGL 3.2 
context pops up (but no segfault in this case).

I tried a very minimal example that creates a 3.2 context (using SDL) 
and that fails as well, so maybe something strange is going in with our 
nvidia driver installation. I'll see if I can do some more tests.

Hello,

I am experiencing an error when running ParaView 5.1.0 using VGL

When starting ParaView 5.1.0 I get the following warnings

[VGL] WARNING: The OpenGL rendering context obtained on X display
[VGL]    :0.0 is indirect, which may cause performance to suffer.
[VGL]    If :0.0 is a local X display, then the framebuffer device
[VGL]    permissions may be set incorrectly.

And then ParaView 5.1.0 seg faults.

ParaView 5.0.1 when run under VGL does not produce the same
warnings and works just fine.

Is their some new requirement for VGL support that ParaView 5.1.0 has
over version 5.0.1?

Thanks,

Joe

No segfault just means that the scene didn't attempt to rendering
something that needed newer OpenGL.

Dear Utkarsh,
I tried to reproduce the error as described in my previous email, but
haven't been able to until now, don't know what happend. The attached code
attaches to a pvserver at localhost:11111 and adds a sphere every half
second. Unfortunately it crashes as soon as I connect ParaView to the same
server.
I guess I'll have to give up programming ParaView and work the old way,
writing VTK files and loading them in ParaView. It is way too complicated.

Peter

The "Point Interpolation" filters need a scalar array to be present on
the dataset.

It's difficult to say for sure. It might be out in the next patch release,
but it might have to wait for the next major/minor release. The openFOAM
reader is a complicated bit of code, I'm still investigating the best way
to go about implementing this. I'll update this thread once I know more.

I know this is thread is already a couple of weeks old, but I was curious if you ever figured out how to set the NaN color to have an opacity of zero? I?ve been wanting to something very similar.

Good news -- I found an easy fix. Instead of failing outright when

(scalar (scalar scalar))

is found because the internal data structures can't handle nested lists
following scalar data, I patched the reader to simply read the nested list,
discard it, print a warning, and continue reading the file.

You'll still see a warning pop up in paraview, but the file should still
read successfully as long as the unsupported list does not appear in a
field used for visualization.

The patch is here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1598

If this is agreeable to everyone, we'll get it merged and incorporated into
a future release.

Dear Paraview Developer,

When using the Glyph function to rend point sets, it may skip some 
points, as shown below

This happens either in steady case or a unsteady case. In the latter, 
Glyph works at first and then disappear afterward.

The .vtp file for generating the above point set has been attached in 
this email.

Thank you very much for taking time to read this email.

Try outputting a glyph every point.  On the Properties tab, under Masking, Glyph Mode, change this to off.

I know this is thread is already a couple of weeks old, but I was curious if you ever figured out how to set the NaN color to have an opacity of zero? I?ve been wanting to something very similar.

Subject: [Paraview] Animating trajectories of points
Message-ID: <CAJ62sAqggjtqBjmhVHbm_o8eW8QDoanTL+5HC9rphHMLx=mY+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is my first time using ParaView and I am trying to get an animation of
a trajectory of points. I have the data stored in separate csv files (one
file for each time step). When I upload the data into ParaView, it is all
grouped together and I can do it all at once. I am able to use the filter
Table to Points to see the outcome of all the points together. What i am
looking to do, however, is to animate a trajectory of the points over time.

Do you know how I should approach doing this? I assumed that i would be
able to click "play" and it would work once I uploaded the data, however,
this does not seem to be doing anything.

Thank you very much in advance!

This is what I have so far:

I got bitten by the default masking settings a couple of times as well. 
Maybe change the default to not do masking when the number of input 
points is low, like 10000?

Hi Dave,

I tested the patch by simply replacing the two modified files and the new peeling worked with parallel rendering. I noticed, however, that I cannot load any state files saved before the patch application (or even from previous versions), Paraview segfaulted each time. I did not investigate the matter any further but perhaps you could double check that there is no backward compatibility issue with older state files that do have opacity information. In addition the peeling, regardless whether it?s the old or new implementation, takes significantly more time with parallel rendering than in the serial mode. Although, it?s expectable, the overhead is suspiciously high, I tried on 8 processes and a geometry which, in serial mode can be made opaque dynamically with no visible delay, took 34 seconds to be rendered. Most of the overhead comes from parallel distribution for compositing.

Regards,
Lukasz

It doesn?t happen all the time, I suppose you need a fairly large surface dataset. I managed to reproduce the problem on a wavelet source (attached state file), try increasing the number of elements if you do not see any artifacts. I have bult Paraview from source on OpenSuse 13.1 but also cross-checked with the Linux binaries from Paraview.org and had same issues. There was no problem with the osmesa-llvm flavor though.

I couldn't reproduce this here on arch linux with a newer nVidia driver (367.27), so I'm suspicious that this is a driver bug that's affecting the new depth peeling implementation.

Since you're building from source, can you try editing VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderer.cxx, and change line 322

if (dualDepthPeelingSupported)

to

if (false)

in DeviceRenderTranslucentPolygonalGeometry, recompile using the OpenGL2 backend, and let me know if the issue goes away? I suspect it will since both the OpenGL1 backend and OpenGL2 mesa/llvm do not use the new code.

I'll put together a patch to force the older peeling implementation via an environment variable to make the work-around easier to apply.

Patch is here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1589

By the way, are you running paraview with remote rendering via pvserver? I was just made aware of a similar issue with remote rendering and depth peeling.

Thanks Samuel, 
The clip function does what I want. 
The steps that I used are: 
1-select extract surface 
2-select conductivity 
3-clip (to remove the x-right face) 
4-clip (to remove the x-left face) 
5-clip (to remove the y-top face) 
6-clip (to remove the y-bottom face) 
7-slice (to get the 2D circle)

Does not ParaView's Extract Surface filter give what you are looking to obtain? 

The result of the Extract Surface filter can also be trimmed visa the Clip filter.

I have experience extracting surfaces with another code where the surfaces are defined by a variable (-3= cylinder surface). 
I do it like this: 
1-select extract surface 
2-select conductivity 
3-select threshold (choose -3 which corresponds to the cylinder surface). 

but I am using a code where the cylinder surface is NOT a predefined variable. 
How do I do I extract the surface? 
Hope my question is clear,

Hi Takuya, David,

That would be perfect. What kind of timeline are we looking at to see this in a release version?

It's difficult to say for sure. It might be out in the next patch release, but it might have to wait for the next major/minor release. The openFOAM reader is a complicated bit of code, I'm still investigating the best way to go about implementing this. I'll update this thread once I know more.

Good news -- I found an easy fix. Instead of failing outright when

(scalar (scalar scalar))

is found because the internal data structures can't handle nested lists following scalar data, I patched the reader to simply read the nested list, discard it, print a warning, and continue reading the file.

You'll still see a warning pop up in paraview, but the file should still read successfully as long as the unsupported list does not appear in a field used for visualization.

The patch is here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1598

If this is agreeable to everyone, we'll get it merged and incorporated into a future release.

Subject: [Paraview] "X Error: BadMatch" when loading state file with OpenGL2
 rendering on Fedora 18
Message-ID: <CAKtnqfkY0YdddPhrDWOphR21tWwFRhzNVyDtLfEnZQfS6n1s5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have an issue when loading state files on Fedora 18 with Paraview
compiled with the new OpenGL2 rendering backend, while there is no
error with the legacy OpenGL backend. Steps to reproduce the issue:

- Create a cylinder
- File/Save state: cylinder.pvsm
- File/Load state: load cylinder.pvsm

=> Paraview freezes. In the terminal, there is the error:

X Error: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes) 8
  Major opcode: 1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Resource id:  0x3000104

This error is not reproduced in Fedora 20.

When loading more complex state file, there are more errors:


X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3
  Major opcode: 3 (X_GetWindowAttributes)
  Resource id:  0x3000111
X Error: GLXBadDrawable 169

Is there a way to change the colour of the box selection in the clip filter? If someone is working with a white background then clipping by a box is difficult as you can't see the box bounds. It's not a showstopper, but perhaps could be integrated into the colour palette.

It seems that it is not possible to clip or extract cells from a 2D slice by means of a box selector. This approach works with the sphere or cylinder clipping but the box selection fails to extracted anything. Most likely because of the third dimension of the box is missing. To reproduce, create a plane source with 10 x10 cells and the select theclip filter, then set clip type to box, scale the box down and hit apply. Do the same with a sphere clip type.

The changes only affected shader code in the rendering engine, this
shouldn't make any difference in the ParaView state. Do they still segfault
in master without patching the files for the opacity fix?

Was it 34 seconds for the initial frame, or for every frame? If the dataset
is large a longer first render would be expected as the data propagates.

Message-ID: <CADHSJjAGJmma5MENXXpNdkD44Hd-9sShbLhfCfADPq2o9kH70w@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

Since there we a couple of crucial issues reported after the 5.1.0
release, we are planning on putting out a 5.1.1 patch release.

Currently, this will include the following fixes:

1. Address issues with depth peeling not working as expected in
client-server mode.
2. Address issues with ExodisIIReader not loading certain variables.
3. Address issue with nested lists in OpenFOAM
4. Address issue with "?" button not working in ParaView binaries.

Is there anything else that's can qualify as critical that should go
in this patch release? Note the 5.2.0 release in planned for SC16 i.e.
Oct/Nov.

If there's nothing else, I think we have fixes for almost all of
these, so we can put the release out early next week.

Message-ID: <0f977f7fe46343829f8070c39d05b6df@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Janessa,

ParaView should be able to read in a series of csv files as a time series. I just verified that when I have a sequence of csv files, ParaView treats it as a time series and plays through them.

For whatever reason, the image you originally attached to the email did not come through to me, so I cannot see exactly what you are doing. One problem could be that the names of the csv files have to follow a numbering convention so that ParaView knows to treat them as a sequence. Simply having them with sequential number names should do the trick (e.g. points1.csv, points2.csv, points3.csv, etc.). If ParaView understands the numbering convention, then the files should be grouped together in the file browser.

Hi,

This is my first time using ParaView and I am trying to get an animation of a trajectory of points. I have the data stored in separate csv files (one file for each time step). When I upload the data into ParaView, it is all grouped together and I can do it all at once. I am able to use the filter Table to Points to see the outcome of all the points together. What i am looking to do, however, is to animate a trajectory of the points over time.

Do you know how I should approach doing this? I assumed that i would be able to click "play" and it would work once I uploaded the data, however, this does not seem to be doing anything.

Thank you very much in advance!

This is what I have so far:

That is odd behavior. Can you take a look at the csv files in a text editor? It looks like maybe all the data got appended to output1.csv, and the rest of the files are empty.

Thank you for your response. I managed to upload the sequence of files. They are named in the numeric fashion you mentioned (output1.csv, output2.csv, output3.csv, etc). When I add a filter "Table to Points" on the spreadsheet, I get the results in the image I attached to the email. What I am trying to do is to get an animation of the trajectory of the points, such that I can see the points being plotted over time.

Currently when I click play, everything goes blank. If you look at the second attached image, you will see the time is 13 of 150000 at the top of the screen. How can I fix this so I can get the animation of the points over time?

Thank you very much in advance!

Janessa,

ParaView should be able to read in a series of csv files as a time series. I just verified that when I have a sequence of csv files, ParaView treats it as a time series and plays through them.

For whatever reason, the image you originally attached to the email did not come through to me, so I cannot see exactly what you are doing. One problem could be that the names of the csv files have to follow a numbering convention so that ParaView knows to treat them as a sequence. Simply having them with sequential number names should do the trick (e.g. points1.csv, points2.csv, points3.csv, etc.). If ParaView understands the numbering convention, then the files should be grouped together in the file browser.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Animating trajectories of points

Hi,

This is my first time using ParaView and I am trying to get an animation of a trajectory of points. I have the data stored in separate csv files (one file for each time step). When I upload the data into ParaView, it is all grouped together and I can do it all at once. I am able to use the filter Table to Points to see the outcome of all the points together. What i am looking to do, however, is to animate a trajectory of the points over time.

Do you know how I should approach doing this? I assumed that i would be able to click "play" and it would work once I uploaded the data, however, this does not seem to be doing anything.

Thank you very much in advance!

This is what I have so far:

This was written up here: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14843.  No, there is no way to change it.

Since it makes the white color palette unusable, I put it on the todo list.

Is there a way to change the colour of the box selection in the clip filter? If someone is working with a white background then clipping by a box is difficult as you can't see the box bounds. It's not a showstopper, but perhaps could be integrated into the colour palette.

Message-ID: <CAGgSO3gAtUdEPW4e4wWjPtpQQkPLjH1WdygnJ+Nfgdxzgw=nBw@mail.gmail.com>

When I view field data in a spreadsheet view the Row IDs are numerically
ordered correctly (i.e. 1-9, followed by 10-19, followed by 20-29, ...) etc.

When I  then apply a Transpose Table filter, the row numbers become the
columns but they are ordered alphabetically (i.e. 1, 10, 11, 12, ..., 2,
20, 21, 22, ..., 3, 30, 31...).  I cannot see a property that preserves
numeric ordering when transposing a table using the Transpose Table
filter.  Is this possible?

thanks...

Subject: [Paraview] sum of a variable over all cells of one timestep
Message-ID: <66377404782e45978cb70770712c1cd6@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I am trying to find the sum of a variable for all cells at one timestep.  It's ending up being surprisingly hard.  This is in parallel on dozens of servers, with hundreds of input files.  The Integrate Variable filter doesn't work, because it multiplies by cell volume.  At Ken's suggestion, I tried the Descriptive Statistics filter, and am totally confused what is there.  The first column is Process Id - does mean I get statistics for each processor, rather than for the whole dataset?  Then I see Cardinality, M2, M3, M4, which mean nothing to me.

Is there a way to turn off the cell volume multiply with the Integrate variables filter?  Or, is there a way to use the Descriptive Statistics filter?  Or, is there another, easier way to just sum up a variable?

Thanks,

Alan

Try using the Python calculator. Make sure you set the "Array
Association" to "Cell Data" and then enter the expression sum(ARRAY).
Example for can.ex2, I can do "sum(EQPS)".

Subject: [Paraview] Python script not working after updating to 5.1
Message-ID: <D39AB831.2A37F%Heather.Sheldon@csiro.au>

I have just updated from Paraview 4.3.1 to 5.1.0 and am having trouble with a Python script that no longer works correctly.

The attached script cycles through exodus files in a given directory, and for each file plots a surface plot of GlobalElementId overlain with a threshold plot of 2 other cell variables (one after the other), producing a screenshot of each image. This was working just fine with v4.3.1, but when I run it in 5.1.0 it fails to plot  GlobalElementId except for the first file, and fails to show the scalar color bar for any of the files. What has gone wrong?

Regards.
Heather

Message-ID: <5269c2588321423ca7117304f81ab262@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I'm trying to build ParaView for the first time in many years on a Windows machine with Visual Studio (using the ninja build program), and I am running into the following linker error. It appears that the link command for paraview.exe is failing because the symbol WinMain is not defined. (I am listing the verbose error below at the end if this email for reference.)

The ParaView GUI should be a "windows" program (vs. a "console" program), so defining WinMain sounds like the right thing. But I do not see where WinMain is defined in the code. Looking at the paraview_main.cxx source file that is generated, sure enough it defines main instead of WinMain. Am I missing something when configuring the build?

Try building without Ninja?  If that also fails, I could try a build of my own.  Haven't done so in 6 months, but it seems to work.

By the way, what version of Visual Studio?

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Symbol WinMain missing when compiling with Visual Studio

I'm trying to build ParaView for the first time in many years on a Windows machine with Visual Studio (using the ninja build program), and I am running into the following linker error. It appears that the link command for paraview.exe is failing because the symbol WinMain is not defined. (I am listing the verbose error below at the end if this email for reference.)

The ParaView GUI should be a "windows" program (vs. a "console" program), so defining WinMain sounds like the right thing. But I do not see where WinMain is defined in the code. Looking at the paraview_main.cxx source file that is generated, sure enough it defines main instead of WinMain. Am I missing something when configuring the build?

Subject: [Paraview] Animating trajectories of points
Message-ID: <025d4329fc2448d8b74681436d830e13@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Janessa,

Whether or not you need a separate file for each time step depends on how time is represented in the file format. For csv files, the only way to represent time is through a sequence of files, so you will always need those 150,000 (unless you create your own reader or filter that adds a time-based convention to the file).

Most of the simplest text-based file formats I can think of also use a separate file for each time step (such as legacy VTK, XML-based VTK, PVD). I?m pretty sure XDMF (http://www.xdmf.org/) can support your data over all time steps in a single file, but you would have to write it out using the HDF5 library. The Exodus II file format can also support your data (as long as the number of points remains constant), but it also requires using an associated library.

Thank you for your assistance, Ken. I was able to get it to run. An issue I see is that my animation requires 150,000 files. Is there a way to combine the data into a single file and run an animation over time?

Thank you,
Janessa

That is odd behavior. Can you take a look at the csv files in a text editor? It looks like maybe all the data got appended to output1.csv, and the rest of the files are empty.

Hi Ken,

Thank you for your response. I managed to upload the sequence of files. They are named in the numeric fashion you mentioned (output1.csv, output2.csv, output3.csv, etc). When I add a filter "Table to Points" on the spreadsheet, I get the results in the image I attached to the email. What I am trying to do is to get an animation of the trajectory of the points, such that I can see the points being plotted over time.

Currently when I click play, everything goes blank. If you look at the second attached image, you will see the time is 13 of 150000 at the top of the screen. How can I fix this so I can get the animation of the points over time?

Thank you very much in advance!

Janessa,

ParaView should be able to read in a series of csv files as a time series. I just verified that when I have a sequence of csv files, ParaView treats it as a time series and plays through them.

For whatever reason, the image you originally attached to the email did not come through to me, so I cannot see exactly what you are doing. One problem could be that the names of the csv files have to follow a numbering convention so that ParaView knows to treat them as a sequence. Simply having them with sequential number names should do the trick (e.g. points1.csv, points2.csv, points3.csv, etc.). If ParaView understands the numbering convention, then the files should be grouped together in the file browser.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Animating trajectories of points

Hi,

This is my first time using ParaView and I am trying to get an animation of a trajectory of points. I have the data stored in separate csv files (one file for each time step). When I upload the data into ParaView, it is all grouped together and I can do it all at once. I am able to use the filter Table to Points to see the outcome of all the points together. What i am looking to do, however, is to animate a trajectory of the points over time.

Do you know how I should approach doing this? I assumed that i would be able to click "play" and it would work once I uploaded the data, however, this does not seem to be doing anything.

Thank you very much in advance!

This is what I have so far:

Ben, do you have any insight? I remember this was something to do with
CMake and Qt.

FWIW, our dashboards to test with ninja so that's not the issue.

Sure.  Attached are a dataset and the ParaView saveset.

There's not much needed to replicate.  The view in the save set pretty 
much exemplify the problem.  The three planes intersect and they are not 
occluded in the expected manner.

Thanks for looking at this.

Subject: [Paraview] Surface Streamlines
Message-ID: <8F022B11FBA69944857353AB6A65527618067672@MBX112.d.ethz.ch>

Hello everybody

I observed a problem with surface streamlines in ParaView 4.4. It can be reproduced with the attached files.

The case has a flat geometry in the XZ plane and a velocity distribution without Y-component. Using the filter 'Stream Tracer with Custom Source' gives me very nice results. Unfortunately, the streamlines look bad as soon as I activate the option 'Surface Streamlines'. I would expect more or less the same results as everything is in the same plane. Adjusting the settings didn't help. The standard 'Stream Tracer' filter is also affected.

The conclusion is that the option doesn't work reliably in certain cases. It can be avoided in cases with the plane perpendicular to an axis (by removing the corresponding velocity component with the calculator) but not for planes with arbitrary positions.

Best regards
David

Subject: [Paraview] Bug with Opacity
Message-ID: <DB3PR06MB188C37E33B8D7783A40C20FC2570@DB3PR06MB188.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Version: Paraview 5.0.1

I have found a bug when rendering points with opacity. All the data for the render is stored in a single vtp file, but as this file is generated from the raw data outputted by my simulator, the points are ordered based on the processor with outputted the data. This has resulted in artefacts associated with the boundaries between the processor regions. When I take the identical data, but randomise the order of the points the artefacts disappear, which means that is not due the underlying data. In the attached image the LHS picture has the points randomised in terms of their order and on the LHS it is ordered based on the processors that created it (otherwise exactly the same number of points containing exactly the same set of data). The opacity in these plots was set to 0.05.

I can't easily attach the input files as altogether they are nearly a Gigabyte is size (images each contain a few million points), but can upload them if required.

Regards,
Stephen
