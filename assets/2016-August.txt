Hello,

 

For several months now I have had a serious issue with a Paraview Python script causing an enormous slowdown in the performance of Paraview as it executes. I have tried the old-fashioned method of peppering timing statements everywhere in the python script, but it is very tedious and hasn?t led me to the source of the issue. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to run a Paraview python script through a more advanced software profiler i.e. has anyone profiled the performance of Paraview as it executes a python script? And if so, what tools did you use?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi Chris,

I am using valgrind & callgrind and visualize with kcachegrind and use the RelWithDebInfo for cmake as a compromise for speed of execution and useful output.

I have a bash script valgrind_callgrind in my PATH with:
#!/bin/bash
valgrind -v --numcallers=50 --trace-children=yes --tool=callgrind --collect-jumps=yes --dump-instr=yes --dump-line=yes --collect-systime=yes ?$@?
and call that like
valgrind_callgrind ./paraview  or valgrind_callgrind script.py.

You?ll get several callgrind.out.xxxxx for each process started. You can also profile Paraview python code and parallel runs, if you start pvserver with above command. kcachegrind is then used to look at each of these files.

Callgrind execution is quite slow, but it helped me a lot.

Cheers,
Axel

Message-ID: <45a32035c76c490381910fa709cca79b@MAR190n2.marin.local>

Hi,

Recently I started upgrading our co-processing code to the latest paraview/VTK version. After having to modify our mapped data array classes to support the new *TypedTuple API, I run into the problem that these mapped data arrays are read-only. In the past this was no problem, but now I get errors because the pipeline tries to modify the read-only data arrays.

Parts of the stack-trace include this:

/libvtkCommonDataModel-pv5.1.so.1 : vtkDataSetAttributes::InternalCopyAllocate(vtkDataSetAttributes*, int, long long, long long, int)+0x1d2
/libvtkFiltersGeometry-pv5.1.so.1 : vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::UnstructuredGridExecute(vtkDataSet*, vtkPolyData*)+0x4b7
/libvtkFiltersGeometry-pv5.1.so.1 : vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::RequestData(vtkInformation*, vtkInformationVector**, vtkInformationVector*)+0x107

And this

/lib/libvtkCommonDataModel-pv5.1.so.1 : vtkDataSetAttributes::CopyData(vtkDataSetAttributes*, long long, long long)+0x6a
/lib/libvtkFiltersGeometry-pv5.1.so.1 : vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::UnstructuredGridExecute(vtkDataSet*, vtkPolyData*)+0x173f
/lib/libvtkFiltersGeometry-pv5.1.so.1 : vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::RequestData(vtkInformation*, vtkInformationVector**, vtkInformationVector*)+0x107

I could really use some guidance on how to modify our co-processing code to make use of the new paraview/VTK version and API.
I have to say I am somewhat surprised to see this go wrong all of a sudden.

Thanks and best wishes,

For what it's worth, the problem was caused by the (in this case ill-advised) new use of vtkTemplateTypeMacro, instead of using vtkTypeTemplate<>.
It appears that for classes that inherit from vtkMappedDataArray you need to use this

template <class Scalar>
class MyMapped : public vtkMappedDataArray<Scalar>
{
  vtkAbstractTemplateTypeMacro(MyMapped, vtkMappedDataArray<Scalar>); // don't use vtkTemplateTypeMacro
  vtkMappedDataArrayNewInstanceMacro(MyMapped);
}

Dear Cory, dear all,
sorry for not getting back to this topic earlier. Your solution works
perfectly for the described problem. When I create e.g. a SphereSource and
attach the TestProperty filter with its NPoints property, this property is
initialized with the correct number of points in the sphere.

However, I have another requirement which is that the property should also
be updated, when the input changes. I thought the same mechanism for
initializing the property would also take care of updating the property
upon modified input.

If I modify the SphereSource from above by changing the ThetaResolution or
PhiResolution, then vtkTestProperty::RequestInformation is called as
expected, and the included print statements show the new number of points,
but the NPoints property won't reflect this new value. Do you know of
another short trick, how to fix this? You mentioned that you found the need
for a domain element in the ParaView source code. Where exactly? If I
understand what prevented the property initialization, I might be able to
find out what prevents the update.

The complete filter sources, updated to include your corrections, are
attached.

Thank you
Corinna

 submission deadline - August 15, 2016
Message-ID: <CAE32kpXo1Vs4ZrJejTzOWwzmUVms8Mr+ZWy5gyQUPSkkmEQpnA@mail.gmail.com>

Due to multiple requests, we have extended the deadline to August 15,
2016Visualization
Showcase
------------------------------

Important Dates:
February 16, 2016: *Submissions open*
August 15, 2016: *Submissions deadline*
September 1, 2016: *Notifications sent*
------------------------------

*A new format for 2016!*

SC16?s Visualization and Data Analytics Showcase Program provides a forum
for the year?s most instrumental movies in HPC. This year, there will be
both a live display throughout the conference so that attendees can
experience and enjoy the latest in science and engineering HPC results
expressed through state-of-the-art visualization technologies, and a
session at SC16 dedicated to the best of the submissions.

Selected entries will be displayed live in a museum/art gallery format and
six finalists will compete for the Best Visualization Award, with each
finalist presenting his or her movie in a 15-minute presentation.

Movies are judged based on how their movie illuminates science, by the
quality of the movie, and for innovations in the process used for creating
the movie.

The six finalist submissions will appear as short papers on the SC16
webpage and archive.

*Review and selection process:*

Submissions need to include a movie (up to 250MB in size) and a short paper
(up to 4 pages including references). The short paper should describe the
scientific story conveyed by the movie, how the visualization helps
scientific discovery, and the ?state-of-the-practice? information (
ieeevis.org)information behind making the movie.

Each submission will be peer reviewed by the Visualization and Data
Analytics Showcase Committee. Criteria for review include:

   - How effective is the visual communication of the data?
   - How relevant to the HPC community is the visualization?
   - What is the impact of the science story and how well is it told?
   - What visualization techniques were necessary to create the movie?

Finally, submissions should support SC16?s overall theme ?HPC matters.?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Call for Participation: ISAV 2016
=========================

ISAV2016: In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis
and Visualization

In cooperation with SIGHPC and held in conjunction with SC16: The
International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking,
Storage and Analysis, Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.

Full-day Sunday November 13th, 2016

ISAV 2016 Web Site: http://vis.lbl.gov/Events/ISAV-2016/

Workshop Theme
------------------------

The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ
analysis and visualization is  due to several factors. First is an I/O
cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while  being
generated, without first storing to a file system. Second is the
potential for increased  accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of
transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse
temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available
resources, CPU?s and accelerators, in the computation of analysis
products.

The workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners
from industry, academia, and government laboratories developing,
applying, and deploying in situ methods in extreme-scale, high
performance computing. The goal is to present research findings,
lessons learned, and insights related to developing and applying in
situ methods and infrastructure across a range of science and
engineering applications in HPC environments; to discuss topics like
opportunities presented by new architectures, existing infrastructure
needs, requirements, and gaps, and experiences to foster and enable in
situ analysis and visualization; to serve as a ?center of gravity? for
researchers, practitioners, and users/consumers of in situ methods and
infrastructure in the HPC space.

Participation/Call for Papers and Oral Presentations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We invite two types of submissions to ISAV 2016: (1) short, 4-page
papers that present research results, that identify opportunities or
challenges, and that present case studies/best practices for in situ
methods/infrastructure in the areas of data management, analysis and
visualization; (2) lightning presentation submission, consisting of a
1- or 2-page submission, for a brief oral presentation at the
workshop. Short papers will appear in the workshop proceedings and
will be invited to give an oral presentation of 15 to 20 minutes;
lightning round submissions that are invited to present at the
workshop will have author names and titles included as part of the
proceedings. Submissions of both types are welcome that fall within
one or more areas of interest, as follows:

Sorry not without hacking a bit.

Thoughts about how to go about it:

You can configure a ParaView build to have just one or the other, in which
case the choice goes away.

Change the .xdmf file extension to something like .xdmf2 or .xdmf3 and then
register the extension to just one of the readers.

Extend vtkXdmf*Reader::CanReadFile to check for some version attribute near
the top of the file and return no if the file is meant for the other reader.

Hello,

Please see attached state file that demonstrates possible bug when using
Hover Points to query data on a mesh.

Sweep the cursor over the top plane (with Hover Points On) and points from
both planes are highlighted and the data is randomly shown for either plane.

I'm using Paraview 5.1 on Windows 7 64bit.

Sorry if this isn't the place for such posts. I haven't been here for a
while.

Thanks, Bob

Hi Chris,

 

I am using valgrind & callgrind and visualize with kcachegrind and use the RelWithDebInfo for cmake as a compromise for speed of execution and useful output.

 

I have a bash script valgrind_callgrind in my PATH with:

#!/bin/bash 

valgrind -v --numcallers=50 --trace-children=yes --tool=callgrind --collect-jumps=yes --dump-instr=yes --dump-line=yes --collect-systime=yes ?$@?

and call that like

valgrind_callgrind ./paraview  or valgrind_callgrind script.py.

 

You?ll get several callgrind.out.xxxxx for each process started. You can also profile Paraview python code and parallel runs, if you start pvserver with above command. kcachegrind is then used to look at each of these files.

 

Callgrind execution is quite slow, but it helped me a lot.

 

Cheers,

Axel

Hello,

 

For several months now I have had a serious issue with a Paraview Python script causing an enormous slowdown in the performance of Paraview as it executes. I have tried the old-fashioned method of peppering timing statements everywhere in the python script, but it is very tedious and hasn?t led me to the source of the issue. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to run a Paraview python script through a more advanced software profiler i.e. has anyone profiled the performance of Paraview as it executes a python script? And if so, what tools did you use?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi T.J.

 

I?m having trouble finding the ?include? directory in both the ParaView source as well as the build directory. I used the command below, which was modeled after your suggestion in the quoted email below, to see what path is given for the include directory.

ParaView_build/bin/paraview-config --include --python vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkPVServerManagerRendering vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer

The output of the command above is:? -I/home/neal/software/ParaView_build/include/paraview-5.1

The problem that I?m having is that there is no such directory in my ParaView_build directory. Is there a special CMAKE flag that I need to use in order to have an include directory added to the build directory? 

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi Christopher,

 

I?m pretty sure the ?library keywords? are what ParaView refers to as ?modules?. These are defined within ParaView?s CMakeFile.txt-s as `vtk_module(###)`. If you are building a Catalyst plugin, you will probably get most of what you need by querying the vtkPVCatalyst module for its dependencies. As for the header files, I think paraview-config only gives the include directory (`paraview-config --include`). Putting this in your makefile should be sufficient for linking against ParaView.

 

Sincerely,

T.J.

Also, your example provides the method for obtaining the library list to link to. Is there a way to get the list of header files to include with the ?I flag in a Makefile?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Procedure for compiling Catalyst

 

Hi Chris,

 

I believe that you can link against ParaView from a standard Makefile by using the `paraview-config` executable that gets built when building ParaView. An example of how to do this is something like this:

 

ifeq "$(USE_PARAVIEW)" "true"
            PARAVIEW_CONFIG = $(PARAVIEW)/bin/paraview-config
            LIBS += $(shell $(PARAVIEW_CONFIG) --libs --python vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkPVServerManagerRendering vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer) -lparaview -Lparaview_catalyst/Adaptor-build -lMPASAdaptor
endif

I should mention, it is much easier to use CMake ;)

T.J.

Thanks T.J. Your suggestions has resolved the VTK issue. I did not know that it was a submodule. I just learned that submodules exist from this actually haha.

I see that the examples for Catalyst are under the Paraview source tree. I was able to get Paraview to build with Catalyst. I compiled the examples using
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH~/software/ParaView_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON  ~/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/



That seems to build all of the examples without throwing any errors.  Now if I have a small C++ code that I have written that I want to try and link with the Catalyst headers and library files, is there a way to figure out what the command that was used to build the example cases was so that I can copy it? Reading the makefiles that are generated by cmake hasn?t been too helpful for me i.e. I can?t find the ?L and ?I sections of the compile statement that pulls the libraries and headers together.



The end-game for me is to be able to write an adaptor for a simulation code to allow it to utilize the Catalyst functions. This code uses a standard make process, and so I would like to try and avoid having to re-cast the entire build process to cmake.


Thank you,

Chris

Hi Chris,

 

VTK is a submodule under VTK, so try the following:

 

git clone https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git

git submodule init

git submodule update

?the rest of the build process.

 

Hope this helps!

The concept of the editions is that the subset of interest differs based on the desired in situ processing and linking your simulation code to all of ParaView Catalyst can take up a significant amount of memory. Hopefully the blog post at https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-catalyst-editions-what-are-they/ may clear up your confusion.

Best,

Andy

My understanding is that the Catalyst editions can be compiled separately from Paraview i.e. I do not need to have a version of Paraview compiled in order to compile a Catalyst edition. Is this correct?

Thank you,

Hi Chris,

You can get the Catalyst editions source code at http://www.paraview.org/download/ by just selecting Catalyst editions for Type of Download. If you're just getting started though I would recommend doing a build of ParaView without the GUI. Yes this will require learning a bit of CMake (see instructions for building ParaView at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install) but it will likely be smoother for you for understanding Catalyst's capabilities. Also, it's much easier to link a simulation code with Catalyst through CMake than specifying all of the include directories and libraries. When you're looking for a lean build of Catalyst on an HPC machine then I'd suggest going the edition route (the editions help avoid cross-compilation issues on HPC machines too).

Best,

Andy

Hi All,

 

I?m interesting in trying to compile Paraview Catalyst. I understand that there are ?Editions? of the Catalyst library that vary in the amount of functions that are included from the Paraview library. That?s about the extent of my knowledge about the actual source for the Catalyst library. The documentation that I have found for compiling Catalyst is a bit dated(~3 years old), and I haven?t been able to locate an up-to-date set of documents that detail the compilation procedure for building Catalyst.  If I want Catalyst, must I first have a version of Paraview built from scratch on my system? The best documentation that I have found for building Paraview is (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Download_ParaView_Source_Code), and I?m having trouble getting Paraview to build from the instructions(I?ve never used cmake before).

Has anyone who has successfully built the Catalyst library or knows about the process lend me any tips about how I should approach building Catalyst?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

This was a case of ?User Error: Replace User?. I forgot to do the ?make install? step to generate the include directory /facepalm.

One last issue that I am having with the compilation process for Catalyst is in the final ?make install? stage. It is trying to place the files in one of my root directories. I would like it to put the files in my Catalyst_build directory. I know how to specify the install directory from the cmake command line, but Catalyst uses a shell script to execute the cmake command.

For example, I run the command shown below from within my ?Catalyst_build? directory. The argument to the cmake.sh script is the location of the source. How would I go about setting the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to be my ?Catalyst_build? directory?

./../Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials/cmake.sh ../Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials

Hi T.J.

 

I?m having trouble finding the ?include? directory in both the ParaView source as well as the build directory. I used the command below, which was modeled after your suggestion in the quoted email below, to see what path is given for the include directory.

ParaView_build/bin/paraview-config --include --python vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkPVServerManagerRendering vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer

The output of the command above is:  -I/home/neal/software/ParaView_build/include/paraview-5.1

The problem that I?m having is that there is no such directory in my ParaView_build directory. Is there a special CMAKE flag that I need to use in order to have an include directory added to the build directory? 

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi Christopher,

 

I?m pretty sure the ?library keywords? are what ParaView refers to as ?modules?. These are defined within ParaView?s CMakeFile.txt-s as `vtk_module(###)`. If you are building a Catalyst plugin, you will probably get most of what you need by querying the vtkPVCatalyst module for its dependencies. As for the header files, I think paraview-config only gives the include directory (`paraview-config --include`). Putting this in your makefile should be sufficient for linking against ParaView.

 

Sincerely,

T.J.

Thank you T.J! I think I understand what the paraview-config does(and it?s awesome). How would I know which library keywords(vtkPVPythonCatalyst, vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer,etc) that I need to specify? Is there a list maintained somewhere of the available options?  Also, your example provides the method for obtaining the library list to link to. Is there a way to get the list of header files to include with the ?I flag in a Makefile?

Thank you,

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Procedure for compiling Catalyst

 

Hi Chris,

 

I believe that you can link against ParaView from a standard Makefile by using the `paraview-config` executable that gets built when building ParaView. An example of how to do this is something like this:

 

ifeq "$(USE_PARAVIEW)" "true"
            PARAVIEW_CONFIG = $(PARAVIEW)/bin/paraview-config
            LIBS += $(shell $(PARAVIEW_CONFIG) --libs --python vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkPVServerManagerRendering vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer) -lparaview -Lparaview_catalyst/Adaptor-build -lMPASAdaptor
endif

I should mention, it is much easier to use CMake ;)

 

Sincerely,

T.J.

Thanks T.J. Your suggestions has resolved the VTK issue. I did not know that it was a submodule. I just learned that submodules exist from this actually haha.

I see that the examples for Catalyst are under the Paraview source tree. I was able to get Paraview to build with Catalyst. I compiled the examples using
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH~/software/ParaView_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON  ~/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/




That seems to build all of the examples without throwing any errors.  Now if I have a small C++ code that I have written that I want to try and link with the Catalyst headers and library files, is there a way to figure out what the command that was used to build the example cases was so that I can copy it? Reading the makefiles that are generated by cmake hasn?t been too helpful for me i.e. I can?t find the ?L and ?I sections of the compile statement that pulls the libraries and headers together.




The end-game for me is to be able to write an adaptor for a simulation code to allow it to utilize the Catalyst functions. This code uses a standard make process, and so I would like to try and avoid having to re-cast the entire build process to cmake.


Thank you,

Chris

Hi Chris,

 

VTK is a submodule under VTK, so try the following:

 

git clone https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git

git submodule init

git submodule update

?the rest of the build process.

 

Hope this helps!

Hi All,

 

I?m seeing something strange when I try to compile ParaView 5.1 from the source. I execute the following commands to compile ParaView:

 

git clone https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git

*Go into cloned ParaView directory*

git submodule init

git submodule update

mkdir ParaView_build? *not inside the ParaView source directory, somewhere else*

cd ParaView_build

(note the last 2 items are paths to the build directory and the source, respectively)

 

make

make install



Everything up to ?make? looks to work just fine. Now, there is a file called ?vtkHashSource-pv5.1? that is located in the /bin directory of the ParaView build. When I type ?make install?, I get the following error:

 

CMake Error at VTK/Utilities/HashSource/cmake_install.cmake:46 (file):

? file INSTALL cannot find

? "/home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1".

? VTK/cmake_install.cmake:420 (include)

? cmake_install.cmake:117 (include)

 

Makefile:94: recipe for target 'install' failed

make: *** [install] Error 1

 

 

I looked and it has moved or deleted the ?vtkHashSource-pv5.1? file that was originally in the ParaView/bin directory! I?m sure of it because I copied the file to a temp directory and it disappears every time I put it in the ParaView/bin and type ?make install?. 

Has anyone had this problem?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Subject: [Paraview] Save Animation Bug (possibly)
Message-ID: <CA+yet-5aNry=h5B+44kTRs7-grjPaj0uKyqP16O9S8OYVwxQTA@mail.gmail.com>

I will try to make this short:

-Running Paraview 5.1.0 on Windows
-Layout with vertically split view port; toggled view port borders off
-View port border width thickness is set to 0 pixels
-Save screenshot generates an image of the layout without a border present
-Save animation generates an image of the layout with a black border
present where the split in the view port would have been.

I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it would be great if the images
generated from save screenshot and save animation were the same (without
the view port border).

Thanks,
Clayton

Hi,

After getting help from the list, i finished the initial implementation 
of the code but in this case i have a strange experience with Catalyst. 
The prototype code is working with allinputsgridwriter.py script and 
could write multi-piece dataset in VTK format without any problem. In 
this case, the code also handles four different input ports to get data 
in different grid structure and dimensions (2d/3d).

The main problem is that if i try to use the same code to output a png 
file after creating iso-surface from single 3d field (141x115x14 = 
227K), it is hanging. In this case, if i check the utilization of the 
processors (on Linux, Centos 7.1,

they seems normal because the co-processing component only works on a 
subset of the resource (8 processor, has utilization around 99 percent).

So, the GPU is not overloaded in this case. I tested the code with two 
different version of ParaView (5.0.0 and 5.1.0). The results are same 
for both cases even if i create the co-processing Python scripts with 
same version of the ParaView that is used to compile the code. I also 
tried to use 2d field (141x115) but the result is also same and the code 
is still hanging. The different machine (MacOS+ParaView 5.0.0) works 
without problem. There might be a issue of Linux or installation but i 
am not sure and it was working before. Is there any flag or tool that 
allows to analyze Paraview deeply to find the source of the problem.

Hi Chris,

Yes, the way you call it is what I am using (if that was a question). Likewise, for parallel runs I start pvserver with
mpiexec -np 4 valgrind_callgrind pvserver and get 4 log files, one for each mpi execution. I have not tried pvbatch, but the logic should be similar.

Regards,
Axel

Thank you Axel!

If I wanted to run the script through pvpython would I structure the command to be:

valgrind_callgrind pvpython script.py

Thank you,

Hi Chris,

I am using valgrind & callgrind and visualize with kcachegrind and use the RelWithDebInfo for cmake as a compromise for speed of execution and useful output.

I have a bash script valgrind_callgrind in my PATH with:
#!/bin/bash
valgrind -v --numcallers=50 --trace-children=yes --tool=callgrind --collect-jumps=yes --dump-instr=yes --dump-line=yes --collect-systime=yes ?$@?
and call that like
valgrind_callgrind ./paraview  or valgrind_callgrind script.py.

You?ll get several callgrind.out.xxxxx for each process started. You can also profile Paraview python code and parallel runs, if you start pvserver with above command. kcachegrind is then used to look at each of these files.

Callgrind execution is quite slow, but it helped me a lot.

Cheers,
Axel

Subject: [Paraview] Profiling Paraview

Hello,

For several months now I have had a serious issue with a Paraview Python script causing an enormous slowdown in the performance of Paraview as it executes. I have tried the old-fashioned method of peppering timing statements everywhere in the python script, but it is very tedious and hasn?t led me to the source of the issue. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to run a Paraview python script through a more advanced software profiler i.e. has anyone profiled the performance of Paraview as it executes a python script? And if so, what tools did you use?

Thank you,
Chris Neal

This looks like the front faces of the surface have been culled. In the
properties tab, enable advanced properties (the gear button) and locate the
"Backface representation" setting. It's usually set to "Follow Frontface",
but "Cull Frontface" will give results like you're seeing.

Does changing this value help?

Can you share your Python script? Another thought is that your Python
script was added to each process instead of the subset of processes that
are supposed to do the calculation on it. For example, the Python script
that is supposed to generate the image should only be added through a
vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline on those 8 processes.

Clayton,

I could not reproduce this. What was the size of the images you're
saving? I wonder if that matters.

That's odd. Trying to see if I can reproduce this with your command
line. I'll report back once the build is done.

Subject: [Paraview] Surface LIC contrast enhancement invalid range
Message-ID: <CA+yV-vBpTaPFOA0hgJOcLuAoCpkdiiYsgaM+-Q7CGgnQ9K2i+g@mail.gmail.com>

A colleague of mine is having an issue using Surface LIC in ParaView 4.4:


I am having issues while running a Python script in batch mode on a server
with software rendering. While rendering a surface LIC image I receive the
following error message:

ERROR: In /ParaView/VTK/Rendering/LIC/vtkSurfaceLICPainter.cxx, line 3076
vtkPSurfaceLICPainter (0x5f0a3040): 6: Invalid  range 1e+38, -1e+38 for
color contrast enhancement

The resulting image writes out but appears "dark". The interesting item
here is that this only occurs on some images and not all of them. From
image to image the only thing that I am changing is the position of a Slice.

Any insight here would be great, I am out of ideas.


We would like to switch to using ParaView 5.1.x but as far as we know
surface LIC is not working in parallel yet.

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your help. You can find the Python script as attachment. BTW,
the "coprocessorinitializewithpython" method is called by subset of
processors that are supposed to do co-processing. I think that the usage
of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline is correct in this case. It is weird but it
works under Mac OS and allinputsgridwriter.py script works on both Linux
and Mac OS.

extern "C" void coprocessorinitializewithpython_(int *fcomm, const char*
pythonScriptName, const char strarr[][255], int *size) {
  if (pythonScriptName != NULL) {
    if (!g_coprocessor) {
      g_coprocessor = vtkCPProcessor::New();
      MPI_Comm handle = MPI_Comm_f2c(*fcomm);
      vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm *Comm = new
vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm(&handle);
      g_coprocessor->Initialize(*Comm);
      vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline> pipeline =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline>::New();
      pipeline->Initialize(pythonScriptName);
      g_coprocessor->AddPipeline(pipeline);
      //pipeline->FastDelete();
    }

    if (!g_coprocessorData) {
      g_coprocessorData = vtkCPDataDescription::New();
      // must be input port for all model components and for all dimensions
      for (int i = 0; i < *size; i++) {
        g_coprocessorData->AddInput(strarr[i]);
        std::cout << "adding input port [" << i << "] = " << strarr[i] <<
std::endl;
      }
    }
  }
}

Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch hangs when enabling OSPRay
Message-ID: <CA+G-nc7xeiXVJ-=dtkb=Te=OPrUOmjbCd7PEVUFRzUThmFbm4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've compiled Paraview 5.1 with multithreaded mpi and ospray (with OpenMP)
support using the next  modules:

  1) gcc/4.8.2            5) xalt/0.5.3           9) szip/2.1
 13) boost/1.61.0
  2) openmpi/1.8.4_mtm    6) DefApps             10) hdf5/1.8.11
14) libtool/2.4.2
  3) PE-gnu/4.8.2-1.8.4   7) qt4/4.8.5           11) mxml/2.9
 15) git/1.8.0.2
  4) lustredu/1.4         8) python/2.7.9        12) adios/1.9.0
16) cmake/3.5.2


and wrote a python script that loads a  vtu file  and renders it as glyph
particles.

When running pvbatch in one node it works fine, I can visualize and save
images. However, when running pvbatch with mpi the script just hangs in the
line  that enables OSPRay:

oSPRayRendered3DView1.EnableOSPRay = 1


I am using the next mpi  commands with no success:

mpirun -npernode 16 pvbatch  --mpi --use-offscreen-rendering myscript
inputfile.vtu outputimage.png

mpirun -np 13 --map-by ppr:1:socket:pe=16 pvbatch  --mpi
--use-offscreen-rendering myscript inputfile.vtu outputimage.png


I did a simpler script that does the following:

#### import the simple module from the paraview
from paraview.simple import *
#### disable automatic camera reset on 'Show'
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

# set active view
SetActiveView(None)
CreateLayout('Layout #1')

# Create a new 'Render View'
print "Creating render view"
renderView1 = CreateView('RenderView')
renderView1.ViewSize = [11520, 3240]
renderView1.CameraPosition = [0.0, 0.0, 6.69]
renderView1.CameraFocalPoint = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
renderView1.CameraViewUp = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
renderView1.CameraViewAngle = 30.0
renderView1.CameraParallelScale = 1.73
renderView1.Background = [0.32, 0.34, 0.43]
print "Before Enabling OSPRay"
renderView1.EnableOSPRay = 1
print "After Enabling OSPRay"
renderView1.Shadows = 1
renderView1.AmbientSamples = 4
renderView1.SamplesPerPixel = 8
renderView1.MaxFrames = 1
renderView1.LightScale = 1.0

print "Done!"


#### saving camera placements for all active views

# current camera placement for renderView1
renderView1.CameraPosition = [148.48492741767512, 106.10239872416838,
-28480.984448300518]
renderView1.CameraFocalPoint = [137.62326776804608, 95.85538889348155,
-28593.41405565134]
renderView1.CameraViewUp = [-0.529722197084864, 0.8477698001026378,
-0.02609137691878691]
renderView1.CameraParallelScale = 19159.165918040744



but it  never reaches the print "After Enabling OSPRay" line



Any advice will be appreciated,

Surface LIC is now supported with 5.1.2 . Can you try it out and let
us know if you see the same issue?

Thanks,

That is very odd. I use arch linux as well and don't see this here.

I'm suspecting a graphics driver issue at this point. Try running paraview
with the "--mesa-llvm" command line argument and see if it fares better.
That will force paraview to use a software-based OpenGL implementation and
bypass the GPU and system OpenGL drivers.

You may also want to try the slightly newer 5.1.2 release here:

Thank you David, I tried with Mesa and the result is the same. I'm gonna
try the newer release, but I suspect it won't solve the issue.

Any information that I can export and that can help figure out the root of
the problem?

The only other thing I can think of is that it might be an issue with
the new depth peeling code, which is used to blend layers of
translucent geometry. However, from the look of the screenshots, it
appears that all of the geometry is opaque, in which case depth
peeling wouldn't be used.

Still, you can try setting the environment variable
"VTK_USE_LEGACY_DEPTH_PEELING" to force the older depth peeling code.
This was added for 5.1.2, so you'll need to test that on the new
release.

Other than that...I'm out of ideas, unfortunately. Maybe try an older
4.x version of paraview?

Maybe someone else will have some idea what may be happening. It
appears that the depth test has been reversed on these builds somehow.

Subject: [Paraview] Slicing a sphere based on longitudes and latitudes
Message-ID: <CAE3taFAQQ9r-5OFpAcb-iBwGJm4xYxNrM6wEGOJ7uot9OMx2qA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Quick query, but is there an easy way to slice a spherical Earth model
based on longitude and latitude while keeping the origin at the
centre?

What I am looking to do is slice along a fixed longitude or latitude, e.g.

Longitude slice at 150 degrees; Latitude slice at -30 degrees.

Based on the use of a Great circle definition with the origin at
0,0,0. The data are stored based on the Earth radii. The reference
frame (XYZ) orients with the axes  Z (+/- 90), X( 0,180) and Y(-90,90)
- overlaying a coastline vector goes in the right place.

I can see where the values have to be entered using the origin/normal
but not entirely sure about the formula to use. Hopefully someone can
give a quick pointer on this?

Thanks
Lester

Message-ID: <59904e1aec7a4fa6a750aa489cd4c160@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Lester,

This is pretty straightforward problem in geometry. As I give you the answer, I am assuming that your sphere is centered at the origin (as you said), the axis that runs through the north/south pole is along the Z axis, and the prime meridian (0 degrees longitude) is in the positive X direction.

Making a slice along latitude is simply a slice by a plane parallel to the x-y plane offset by the Cartesian location of the latitude coordinate. The parameters of the latitude slice plane are:

    Origin: [0, 0, sin lat]
    Normal: [0, 0, 1]

Note here that "lat" is the latitude measured in degrees with positive values for north and negative values for south.

A slice along longitude can be thought of as the X-Z plane rotated about the Z axis by longitude degrees. You can do that by setting the X and Y of the normal of this plane to the sin and cos, respectively, of the longitude angle.

    Origin: [0, 0, 0]
    Normal: [sin lon, cos lon, 0]

Here "lon" is the longitude measured in degrees with positive values for west and negative values for east.

You should note that this longitude slice plane will give you a full circle, which technically gives you both the longitude you asked for plus the longitude 180 degrees away. If you just want the semicircle for a single longitude line, you can clip away the half you do not want. You can do this with the clip filter (NOT the slice filter) with the plane set as:

    Origin: [0, 0, 0]
    Normal: [cos lon, -sin lon, 0]

As you do this calculations, be careful about degrees/radians conversions. Longitude/latitude is classically given in degrees and minutes whereas lots of computer trigonometry functions (including those in ParaView) perform sin and cos with radians. Also, if your sphere is oriented differently than I described, you will have to make corrections to these functions.

-Ken

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot access information from second input array in a
	XML custom filter
Message-ID: <CAEhu9hBX8R=P_=rUZd3z0So7PPwX5kgTa6aaLg_NJFbLT3-Z3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm trying to create a custom filter (using vtkPythonProgrammableFilter)
that allows the user to specify two input arrays (the XML file is
attached).  As a guide, I mimicked the XML specifications for the Glyphs
filter in the filters.xml file.  The filter appears as it should, but I
can't seem to access the information for the second data array:

Request Data code:

    print 'ArrayInfo1'
    print self.GetInputArrayInformation(0)
    print 'ArrayInfo2'
    print self.GetInputArrayInformation(1)

Console output (after generating a sphere):

ArrayInfo1

vtkInformation (0000000015E2FD30)

Debug: Off

Modified Time: 866729

Reference Count: 2

Registered Events: (none)

INPUT_PORT: 0

INPUT_CONNECTION: 0

FIELD_ASSOCIATION: 0

FIELD_NAME: Normals



ArrayInfo2

vtkInformation (0000000015E47D80)

Debug: Off

Modified Time: 868190

Reference Count: 2

Registered Events: (none)

No matter how I change the second array, there is no FIELD_NAME or
FIELD_ASSOCIATION associated with it.  Am I accessing it incorrectly?  Did
I prescribe it incorrectly in the XML file?

Thanks,
Evan Kao

Hi Chris,

Are you trying to build from a Catalyst edition or directly from the full
ParaView source? I want to make sure that we're going in the proper
direction when trying to fix this problem.

Thanks,
Andy

For the case outlined in this email chain, it is the ParaView source. I?m currently using Paraview5.2.? I have also had the same trouble with: Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials, with the symbolic link ad-hoc solution working with this case as well.

Hi Chris,

Are you trying to build from a Catalyst edition or directly from the full ParaView source? I want to make sure that we're going in the proper direction when trying to fix this problem.

Thanks,

Andy

I tried it again with cmake 3.5.1 and I see the same error.

-- Up-to-date: /home/neal/software/ParaView5.2/build/lib/cmake/paraview-5.1/Modules/vtkUtilitiesHashSource.cmake
CMake Error at VTK/Utilities/HashSource/cmake_install.cmake:46 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot find
  "/home/neal/software/ParaView5.2/build/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  VTK/cmake_install.cmake:148 (include)
  cmake_install.cmake:117 (include)

I did find a way around the issue by creating a ?tempbin? directory and copying the binaries into that directory and then making a symbolic link from the ?bin? to the binaries in the ?tempbin?.

The code that the make install is failing on(VTK/Utilities/HashSource/cmake_install.cmake:46 ) has the following part that is leading to the error:

if(NOT CMAKE_INSTALL_COMPONENT OR "${CMAKE_INSTALL_COMPONENT}" STREQUAL "RuntimeLibraries")
  if(EXISTS "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1" AND
     NOT IS_SYMLINK "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1")
    file(RPATH_CHECK
         FILE "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1"
         RPATH "")
  endif()
  file(INSTALL DESTINATION "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin" TYPE EXECUTABLE FILES "/home/neal/software/ParaView5.2/build/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1")
  if(EXISTS "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1" AND
     NOT IS_SYMLINK "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1")
    file(RPATH_CHANGE
         FILE "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1"
         OLD_RPATH "/home/neal/software/ParaView5.2/build/lib:"
         NEW_RPATH "")
    if(CMAKE_INSTALL_DO_STRIP)
      execute_process(COMMAND "/usr/bin/strip" "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1")
    endif()
  endif()
endif()


There?s a if statement that checks to see if the executable is symbolic, and if it is it skips the following operation, which I believe is the source of my issue:

file(RPATH_CHANGE
         FILE "$ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/vtkHashSource-pv5.1"
         OLD_RPATH "/home/neal/software/ParaView5.2/build/lib:"
         NEW_RPATH "")

Hi David,

I downloaded all 4.x.x releases and everything works as expected. I
downloaded ParaView 5.0.1 and ParaView 5.1.2, both give me the following
error message about the driver:

libGL error: unable to load driver: i965_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: i965
libGL error: unable to load driver: i965_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: i965
libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Based on that outcome, I confirm that this is a bug introduced somewhere in
between the 4.x.x and 5.x.x releases. How can we go and investigate this
further? I can print more information about my system in case it is needed.

-J?lio

Dear All

I?m trying to import paraview.simple from python and I get this error message:

'/usr/local/lib/paraview-5.1:/usr/local/lib/paraview-5.1/site-packages?

The intention of importing the modules of paraview to python instead of pvpython is that the simulation script needs to be run under virtualenv. 
If there are alternatives ways to get over it, it would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Regards

Are those drivers installed correctly? Looks like they're provided by
the intel-dri and mesa packages on archlinux:

$ pkgfile i965_dri.so
extra/intel-dri
$ pkgfile swrast_dri.so
extra/mesa

Those errors, and that the 5.x releases are working on other archlinux
installs, make me think this is a configuration issue with this
specific machine. The X log file /var/log/Xorg.0.log may have some
clues if there's a problem initializing the driver support needed for
the newer paraview. I'm not convinced this is a bug in ParaView just
yet -- the 5.x versions require different OpenGL contexts than the 4.x
versions, so it may be that something is not quite right for the newer
contexts.

Have you tried building from source and setting VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND
to OpenGL (instead of OpenGL2) in cmake? That would build paraview
with the older backend used by the 4.x line, and might work better for
you.

The only other idea that comes to mind would be to grab the
development branch from git and use 'git bisect' to identify the
commit that introduced the functionality that's failing on this
installation:

Getting the sources from git:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/Documentation/dev/git/develop.md

Git bisect:

Hope this helps,
Dave

Hi,

I have an animation in ParaView with 1440 timesteps. Additionally, I 
have about 500 particles/points which I would like to combine with this 
animation. The particles are also animated over time but not over the 
entire length of the animation. The lifetime of a typical particle is 
about 60 to 500 timesteps, and of course they all start at different 
times. ;-) At the moment I have all data stored as CSV time series, but 
doing everything using CSV is not only alot of work, but might also be 
too much for ParaView. Therefore, I am looking for a smarter way to 
store, load and animate my particles. Anybody any idea how to do it? Any 
help is much appreciated!

Thanks and Cheers...
Niklas

Hey Utkarsh,

I have tried various resolutions: 640 X 480 in animation view yielded a
huge border; 1030 X 820 yielded a smaller border. 'Multi-view image border
width' is set to 0 in settings. If I set the 'Multi-view image border' to a
value and set the color to non-black (red for instance), I end up with the
same black line that splits the view port, but with red lines on either
side of the black line where the view port split is. I have also tried
various file formats: tif, png, jpg, and the avi option.

This problem disappears when I use 'Savescreenshot', but I am unable to
create an animation.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Clayton

I am still having trouble reproducing this issue and hence don't have
any thing to suggest. Let's try this:

1. Open ParaVIew. From to Tools menu, check "Lock View Size"
2. File | Save Animation, set resolution to 600x300. Save as pngs.

Do you still see the border?

If not, can you create a state file with no dataset at all with which
you can reprouce the issue? Hopefully that sheds some light on the
issue.

Thanks
Utkarsh

Hey Utkarsh,

I ended up with the same problem. However, I started deleting components
from the pipeline to see if that had any impact. I deleted the .stl files I
had loaded in that I was using to better define the geometry. I ran Save
Animation with the default settings as before and my problem disappeared. I
exited Paraview without saving the state file, reloaded the state file that
had my .stl files, and when I ran Save Animation again the problem was no
longer there.

I'm not really sure what solved it, but it seems to be working now. I have
been playing with this for a week or so and for it to just start working is
a bit puzzling.
Thank you for your help.

Cheers,
Clayton

Dear all,
I have had problems to export a scene in pdf in Paravis 5.0 of the Salome-7.8.0.The scenario is: when I load a file with some results in a timestep I am able to see all my results normally.
              
https://mega.nz/#!Z1EgCJbC!-UFNy_yDMRUpYTj6ihr9rtE3Xtv5KgancOoqctFGhTE
Then I position my study in a timestep and export the results in pdf format using that configuration:
              
https://mega.nz/#!NgUkFDIB!V0SCj4PqCtryE0nv_E0bSD74K5jqZS_dudV5hxlI2Ow
The result is a picture with only the geometry without any colors.
         
    https://mega.nz/#!wlMRWC6S!RJQrAbLHcflmdNS4eVtxLK7CdVKe7oF_4cQVvsYjjN8 

The resulting pdf: https://mega.nz/#!5g1lwThI!HFXiK-vFRr_eMtSUWdgkwfKfdRdp_sNYBJlR2bMZ8NMI don't know what is happening, but I really wish to extract my results in vector format.Can anyone help with this?I thank you in advance.

This is a known limitation of the GL2PS library used to generate the pdf
files. The geometry colors are rendered using textures, and textures are
not recognized by the export library.

The best solution available would be to use the "Rasterize 3D geometry"
option. The geometry will no longer be stored as vectors, but the text/etc
will still be.

HTH,
Dave

Hi Daniel, I've had similar issues in trying to get high quality
publication-worthy plots out of paraview of late. I've been meaning to
write up my hack method for getting something satisfactory, but I'll
summarize it here. I had problems with the "rasterize 3d image" setting --
some things were outright rendering incorrectly (wrong colors, missing
elements), and additionally apparently there's no anti-aliasing output.

My wishlist:
- vector graphic output (not possible).
- TeX / raw text output for any text fields so LaTeX publications render it
in the appropriate font / math.

Since neither vector output or anti-aliased high resolution raster images
are available, and the rasterized-graphic-vector-text formats seem to give
lousy images, my hybrid process is like this:

1) Save screenshot: Export image as a rasterized png at high resolution
(say 16x desired resolution), but remove any text / colorbar legends.
1a) optional: Shrink this image using some interpolating resizing algorithm
(AFAIK this is essentially FSAA anti-aliasing).
2) Export scene: Export a second file as SVG with rasterized image. This
ends up giving you an svg file with plaintext, but also with an embedded
PNG in 64 bit code.
3) Replace the embedded PNG in the SVG with your high quality image from
(1). You can either convert your original PNG to bytecode and embed that
directly in the SVG, or you can make a hyperlink to the PNG file. The
former is recommended so that you have only one self-contained image file
and don't have to worry about the link breaking.


You can automate this process with some shell scripts to make it relatively
painless.

Dear Cory,
I wonder, if you still have an idea how to implement a filter that
initializes its properties from upstream objects and updates these
properties when those objects change.
Isn't the whole ParaView designed such that changes are propagated along
the pipeline? Why is it so complicated to render propagated changes in the
filter parameters visible?


Thank you
Corinna

Hi Corinna,

Utkarsh addressed the updating of properties in his earlier response
about the directionality of property changes in ParaView:

"
2. ParaView's properties are not bi-directional. They are only
intended to be set on the UI side and pushed to the VTK side. There
are of course exceptions to this, and you can add what's called a
"information_only" property that instead reads a value from the VTK
side and provides it on the "client" side, but for such properties,
often there's no UI. They are instead, used to define the "domain" for
the property which controls things like range for the slider, for
example.
"

So, in short, ParaView is not really designed to do this. However, it
may be possible to define a custom panel for your NPoints property
that, when clicked, updates the property value to the current scalar
range. For example, there is a custom panel widget in the Threshold
filter that lets you update the ranges based on the range of the
currently selected scalar array. You would need this kind of custom
panel widget for your NPoints property. The only catch is you would
need to update the value manually, or perhaps you could use a QTimer
to periodically refresh the value.

HTH,
Cory

On my laptop, the command pkgfile doesn't find any repo for the drivers
i965_dri.so and swrast_dri.so.

*This is what I have installed from the list of open-source drivers:*

extra/xf86-video-fbdev 0.4.4-5 (xorg-drivers xorg) [installed]
    X.org framebuffer video driver

extra/xf86-video-intel 1:2.99.917+691+ga77397a-1 (xorg-drivers xorg)
[installed]
    X.org Intel i810/i830/i915/945G/G965+ video drivers

extra/xf86-video-vesa 2.3.4-2 (xorg-drivers xorg) [installed]
    X.org vesa video driver

*This is the relevant section of my /var/log/Xorg.0.log:*

According to the Arch Linux documentation (
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xorg#Driver_installation), the Intel
driver has priority over the others, is it being picked up in the log?

I updated ParaView from AUR, could you confirm that 5.x.x releases are
working with Arch? I only have another machine with Ubuntu to test on.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for the info, that all worked fine. Sorry bit of a late response.

On a similar theme, is it easy to make a great circle slice (with the
origin at 000) that plots through two long-lat points? I'm guessing
that this scenario would be a rotation about x, y and z ?

Thanks
Lester

Hello dear users,

I'm currently developing some filters (compiled into a custom plugin) under a custom version of Paraview.
The different filters are (supposed to be) displayed in a category in the menu "Filters".
On a Ubuntu 14.04 64bits computer they are not displayed (2 out of 3 still findable/applicable by crtl-space), and on a Kubuntu 16.04 64bits computer they are in their category (all findable/applicable).
They both have the same Paraview version (5.1.0) and have the same sources.
The filters are displayed in the category while under Paraview (both PC), but then going under the custom version they are not shown (Ubuntu, while they are shown under Kubuntu PC).
Does anybody have a clue on how to make those filters appear?

Regards,


Zack

Never mind. If someone else needs to do similar things, have a closer 
look at the vtkParticleReader class:
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkParticleReader.html

Just wrote a Matlab script that transforms all my data into a particle 
time series, which can be opened in ParaView, even with additional 
scalars assigned. Afterwards, I applied the filter 
TemporalParticlesToPathlines and the animation looks pretty cool.

Cheers,
Niklas

I'm afraid this is going beyond my ability to help, I'm not terribly
familiar with these details. But it does look to me like the drivers
are loaded correctly in the log.

I updated my arch box yesterday, and can confirm the the 5.x branches
are working correctly, both using the proprietary nVidia drivers and
the bundled mesa-llvm implementation. I don't have an intel card to
test on, but the mesa-llvm test rules out the hardware driver.

The only thing left I can think of would be to bisect the source, but
that can be a very time consuming process. If you locate the commit
that's causing the error, perhaps it would shed some light on what's
happening.

I'm out of ideas at this point -- maybe someone else will have some suggestions?

Good luck,
Dave

Subject: [Paraview] Face-centered variables
Message-ID: <201608091358.u79DwIeN029790@msw1.awe.co.uk>

Good afternoon ParaView users,

Is there a method for plotting face-centered variables within ParaView?

The variable appears in the Variables list of the Properties panel but I can't find a way to plot it.

Any ideas?

Kind regards,
Jim

Jim,

By plot, do you mean coloring the faces by the face-centered values mapped
through a color map? And by face-centered, do you mean each face has one
data value?

If I have your meaning right, that is indeed possible - you should be able
to choose your variable in the "Color By" combo box. Here, I have selected
a "cell" data variable named "Ids". You should see a cube icon as shown by
your face-centered data variable.

Hi Jim,

In ParaView there is only field values associated with points and cells. If
by face data you mean data associated with 2D cells then Cory's email is
the correct one. If by face values you mean field data associated with a
face of a 3D cell, ParaView does not currently support that. If it's the
latter, maybe if you describe your data layout a bit more in-depth we can
find some workaround for you.

Cheers,
Andy

Can you try removing relevant configuration files from your
~/.config/* directory and see? We've had similar issues with config
files messing with the menus in the past. I wonder if you're running
into that. Running your app with "-dr" command line argument should
have the same effect.

Hello dear users,

While working on glyphes (pipeline), I noticed there was 2 properties menus 1 named "Glyph type" and the other "Glyph source".
Since I don't find anything on "Glyph source" and it doesn't seem to modify the glyph, does anybody know the difference between those two properties?

Regards,

Along the same lines, is this possible with prebuilt binaries on OS X? I
have tried including

export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python"
export
PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk"
export
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Library

but have not been able to make it work

"Glyph Source"  is a group title. All properties under that header
until the the next group header or a separator affect the "Gylph
Source". "Glyph Type" allows you to pick the type of glyph source. The
rest of the properties in that group update based on the chosen glyph
type.

Attached is a script from an older email. The 5.1.* uses Python 2.7,
so you'll need to update the script accordingly. I haven't tested it
(as I don't have my Mac here), but it should give you some hints.

Hi Andy, Cory,

Your advice pointed me in the right direction. I originally thought that the variable was face-centered, but it was actually a variable on  a side set (which wasn?t loaded by default). When I finally realised I had to load the set (hidden in the advanced properties), the variable appeared in the ?Color By? combo box, as promised :-)

Apologies for the confusion!

Many thanks for your help.

Kind regards,
Jim

If I have your meaning right, that is indeed possible - you should be able to choose your variable in the "Color By" combo box. Here, I have selected a "cell" data variable named "Ids". You should see a cube icon as shown by your face-centered data variable.

Is there a method for plotting face-centered variables within ParaView?

The variable appears in the Variables list of the Properties panel but I can?t find a way to plot it.

Any ideas?

Thanks Utkarsh. Two issues:

1- Looks like I have to use OS X provided python (2.7)? Using any other
python results in

Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread

2- using system python I get some unresolved symbol issue with MPI.

Traceback (most recent call last):

Any idea why that happens? I have open-mpi installed system-wide

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Build python dependency
Message-ID: <BLU180-W75BB601E3C6428CFA102F5AD1C0@phx.gbl>

Hi, 
I am building ParaView from source. When we test my release version on a different system, we can't use any feature that uses python : trace, python shell ... 

I installed your binary version and I saw that you provided the python27.DLL and a Lib folder which seem to be the one from python27 installation directory. So I copy pasted python27.dll  and Lib folder into my release folder. When I use this release folder on a different computer, Paraview is still crashing when we try to use  the trace feature which use python. 

Could someone tell me what's the correct way of deploying python with ParaView.  If only there was some python tool like windeployqt.exe which is provided by qt.
thanks

Hi Cory,
that's fine, I have some experience developing Qt UIs. But there is one
difficulty with ParaView: I couldn't find any examples or documentation how
to extend the existing widgets? Where do I plug in the additional elements,
is it possible in some xml plugin description, or do I have to hard code it
into the ParaView sources?

The manual update is fine, although not perfect. Ideally I would like to
let the user choose once whether update is automatic or manual. Since the
manual update button of the Threshold filter changes its color when the
filter input is modified, I assume that I should be able to use the event
that triggers the color change to trigger the update of the displayed
property instead.

Thank you
Corinna

Hi David,

Thank you for your attention. All your comments were really helpful and we
definitely narrowed the location of the bug further. Given that 5.x.x works
well in your Arch Linux, we are for sure talking about driver-related
issues. I don't know to what extent these drivers are being used, but I
will let you know if I figure out something else.

The fact that 4.x.x works on the same machine also confirms that this is a
bug in the way ParaView is manipulating these drivers?

If anyone else has other suggestions besides the bisection of the source
code, which is something I don't have the time to do right now, please let
us know.

Best,
-J?lio

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst - missing some basic filters
Message-ID: <196a3a15d073457cb6c156b051ecd99f@MAR190n2.marin.local>

Hi,

Today I have built the most recent and most complete Catalyst edition (?Catalyst-v5.1.2-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials-Extras-Rendering-Base?). I find that I am missing some basic filters however. For example CellDatatoPointData and ExtractBlock are not available. Is there a way to enable specific filters somehow (maybe in CMake)?

Other filters that are missing that I would like to use are

*AnnotateTimeFilter
*GenerateSurfaceNormals
LinearExtrusion
*MaskPoints
NormalGlyphs
*Reflect
*StreamTracer
StreamTracerWithCustomSource
SurfaceVectors
*Tesselate
*Tetrahedralize
*Triangulate
*TriangleStrips
*Tube

Most of these (with *) I find quite basic and I really wonder why these are not available by default in Catalyst.

Thanks and best wishes,


Menno Deij ? van Rijswijk

Subject: [Paraview] Problem to save screenshot in VERY HIGH resolution
Message-ID: <CAPJ5paX5gqiZwbhVTBEa2YZr5AhWQRbyvdc1a+BJU2vc+n1P3w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to save one screenshot with a very high resolution.

I try to run in several different machines and configurations but I had
always the same problem.

Some black rectangular blocks appears in the figure.

I'm sending an exemple, one figure and the python code that generate this
figure...

Someone had some ideia why I have this problem?

Looks like the relative path specification has change which may make
this tricky. Ben, can you take  a look please? Thanks

That's indeed a bug. I've reported it here:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=16813
We will have it looked into for the next release.

Subject: [Paraview] a lot of Generic Warning for vtkBuffer in PV5.1
Message-ID: <7f6b211b39e643d2b09a21fcea5ff1fa@U-MYKONOS2.dif.dam.intra.cea.fr>

Hello,

When running ParaView 5.1 in debug with DEBUG_LEAKS=ON, I have several times the following message :
Generic Warning: In .../vtkDebugLeaks.cxx, line 285:
  Deleting unknown object: vtkBuffer

When I close PV, there are a lot of vtkBuffer<ScalarT> instances still around.

The configuration used for PV compilation :
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
BUILD_TESTING=OFF
VTK_ALL_NEW_OBJECT_FACTORY=ON
VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS=ON
VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL # or OpenGL2
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON
PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=ON
Module_vtkFiltersSelection=ON
PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_SurfaceLIC=ON
PARAVIEW_AUTOLOAD_PLUGIN_SurfaceLIC=ON
VTK_Group_ParaViewQt=ON
VTK_Group_Views=ON

Does anyone have an idea ?

Thank you,

Claire

It looks like the vtkDebugLeaks reference manager is getting confused
by the class template. It appears that vtkBuffer is being registered
as 'vtkBuffer<ScalarT>' and unregistered as 'vtkBuffer'.

The good news is that you can likely ignore these for now -- they
aren't actually leaking, but the object tracker is getting confused.
I'll see about fixing this soon.

Thanks for the report!

fyi, a common way to encounter
> Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
is when cmake's find Python modules mix two version of Python. this 
happen if you have two installs, one in a system location and one else 
where with interpreter in the path. You can identify it in the cmake 
cache. bug reports on this are found in the cmake Mantis tracker. The 
most informative is here <https://cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=14809> and 
in new bug tracker here 
<https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/14809>. I've resorted to 
using python-config in cmake to work around, but this requires the 
environment to have the desired python in the path, ld lib path, dyld 
lib path and pkg config path.

not a URL_MD5 value for mesa-12.0.0 in the versions.cmake file.   So I
manually added a URL_MD5 entry to versions.cmake and it now works correctly

Subject: [Paraview] Integral variables and plot over time
Message-ID: <1470894939107.9564@student.lut.fi>

Hello,


I am trying to calculate total mass of a particle phase in a system and also the mass flow of particle phase trough a boundary. For example I define a new variable "mass" in calculator, which is the volume fraction times the density, to get the mass in the system I use integrate variables. When I use the filter integrate variables, it integrates every variable. How can I select just the one I defined in calculator as "mass"? Then I use plot over time and I want to plot just the integrated value of "mass". How can just one variable be selected for plot over time from the integrate variables table? Now I can only select the row, which has every variable integrated.


Best regards,

Simo

Subject: [Paraview] Slicing a sphere based on longitudes and latitudes
Message-ID: <8fe91b5d01f742d7841815271a716195@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Lester,

Once again, this problem can be solved with some basic geometry. Basically you want to slice by a plane that goes through the origin (0, 0, 0) and the two points defined by the 2 lat/lon coordiantes. Finding the plane that goes through 3 non-collinear points is straightforward (in Cartesian space).

The first step would be to convert your two lat/lon points to Cartesian coordinate (X,Y,Z).

Once you have that, you can define the slice plane by an origin point (0, 0, 0 works just fine) and a normal (perpendicular) vector. The normal can be computed by taking the cross product of the vectors going from the origin to these two points. Just plug that into the normal for the slice plane and you are good to go.

If you need more information on finding the plane defined by three points, there are many resources on the web to do so. Here is one descriptive video I found with a simple Google search: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qYJfKG-3l8. There are many others. Most of these instructions find the plane equation, but the plane equation is constructed with the point and normal, which are all you need in ParaView.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for the info, that all worked fine. Sorry bit of a late response.

On a similar theme, is it easy to make a great circle slice (with the origin at 000) that plots through two long-lat points? I'm guessing that this scenario would be a rotation about x, y and z ?

Thanks
Lester

Hi ParaView users/developers,

In my works, I need to use ParaView remotely, over the Internet.
Displaying the GUI and the images and accepting a selection become very
slow.  Is there a light-wright version of ParaView (even with lower
resolution)?  Or, if it is possible, how to configure ParaView so it can be
easier to use over the Internet?  Thank you.

I am currently trying the superbuild process. I usually pass pass /m:4 to my msbuild to get 4 msbuild instance. When I used to build paraview (not superbuild), the cpu utilization during the build was always at maximum but with superbuild it is always around 20%.

Do I also need to pass /MP parameter to enable multi-processor build ?

Subject: [Paraview] load plugin through python scripts
Message-ID: <CANO2j4PoFv6RQQdJHt4Nkt89ati_D4W5AKi1fmrj-RmsyHOZuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to write a python scripts to "visualize" simulation results.

I need load a plugin through GUI of paraview before opening data. If I
first load plugin in the GUI and then run my python scripts through
Paraview GUI -> tools ->python shell, it works well.
To load plugin in python scrips. I use the trace tool of paraview found
that the function to load plugin is:
LoadPlugin('/rohit1/data/users/zhixuanc/Soft/ParaView-4.3.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.3/libH5PartReader.so',
remote=False).

Instead of load plugin manually through GUI, I put this command at the very
beginning of the existing python scripts and run the scripts through
Paraview GUI -> tools ->python shell. But I got an error message and it
does not work:

Plot[plotname] = H5PartReader(FileName=maindirectory+subdirectory+name)

NameError: global name 'H5PartReader' is not defined

But when I go to Paraview GUI -> tools -> Manage Plugins, it shows that the
required plugin is loaded.

I am not sure what's wrong and how to fix this issue.

Could anybody give me any advice on it?

ParaViewWeb - Visualizer is meant for that. Although, selection is not
implemented currently.

http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/applications/

But that version of Visualizer require ParaView/master.

Otherwise an older version of Visualizer is provided along with ParaView
binaries (except for Windows).
You can find documentation on it here:

You seem to have a very old node and npm.

The npm package is here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pvw-visualizer

Maybe the service was down?

BTW, if you plan to run ParaView in a VM, the rendering performance will be
pretty low unless you properly setup the VM to use a GPU with the proper
drivers.

Here is one descriptive video I found with a simple Google search: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qYJfKG-3l8. There are many others. Most of these instructions find the plane equation, but the plane equation is constructed with the point and normal, which are all you need in ParaView.

Hi Fan,

at work we are using paraview remotely efficiently by two ways:

- from a cluster: launching pvserver (using mpi for large datasets) and 
connecting from a laptop/desktop paraview session. This requires very 
small network bandwith (tested from my home via ADSL for a 1024? 
dataset) but should require additional work to go through firewall via a 
ssh tunnel.

- from a fat node (many cores, huge memory and high end graphic board) 
with vnc (for remote display). The fat node run vncserver 
(tigervnc-server) and vncviewer is launched on the laptop/desktop. There 
are options for easy tunnelling via ssh. This also requires very few 
network bandwidth and use the remote hardware rendering of the fat node 
(AMD in our case or Nvidia+virtualGL). You can launch a basic paraview 
session or a pvserver/paraview session to run pvserver with MPI on 
several cores.
More simple to set up and to use.

Hope this could help you.

Patrick

Hi,
I have 2 questions for paraview web (pv web visualizer).

1. Can I activate mouse wheel for zooming?
2. I have wrong values (0) at the legend when webgl is enabled. Can you 
give me a hint where to look at the code for a bugfix?

I'm installing Qt 4.8.1 but the only option seems to be x86 and for Visual

Subject: [Paraview] How about developing a Paraview forum
Message-ID: <CA+yQjJWK=YxY4sy1PgHYrvnEpydyqvnek9ZLC1pzdYwfbzPfdA@mail.gmail.com>

Mailing lists are horrible. Is it 1990? Time to upgrade.

A forum in the form of question and answer such as http://stackoverflow.com/
would be good and a good place to start looking is this page that answered
the question of good open source question and answer forums:
https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-open-source-question-and-answer-web-platform-like-Stack-Overflow

Another good example to model after is what they are doing at Unity3d they
actually use a forum in the traditional sense and then a question and
answer forum plus other methods to control info for the community:
http://forum.unity3d.com/

Subject: [Paraview] Custom widget integration in Paraview
Message-ID: <CAOyh2ebB7D3hCEDrZW6DG13oOZQY3fkhr1F0CJfy3VbTpQvDLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am looking for a possibility how to integrate a custom widget into the
ParaView UI. (It is basically a text widget displaying properties of a
custom filter. In addition to the standard property widgets I have to
modify the widget's notification system. But these are implementation
details, and all I need to know from you at the moment, how I can add a
simple textfield into the UI.)

I found the ADD_3DWIDGET macro in ParaviewPlugins.cmake and a few
unanswered threads discussing whether this macro serves the purpose. It
seems like it does. But there is no documentation or example how to proceed.

Does somebody have a code snippet or a link to a description that explains
how to define custom widgets either in a plugin or hardcoded into Paraview?
Either using ADD_3DWIDGET or any other solution?

Thank you
Corinna

To use Qt5, you have to set the PARAVIEW_QT_VERSION variable to 5 (it still
defaults to 4, which is why cmake is complaining).  Note that some things
may be buggy when building against Qt5, I don't know the full list of
current issues, just that there are some.  Also note that you have to
specify the location of Qt5 differently to CMake.  CMake doesn't use the
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable for Qt5, instead it uses Qt5_DIR.  This should
point to .../lib/cmake/Qt5 inside your Qt5 install.

HTH,
Shawn

I haven't been able to reproduce this, but think I may have found the issue.

Open VTK/Common/Core/vtkBuffer.h, and change line 32 from

  vtkTypeMacro(vtkBuffer, vtkObject)

to

  vtkTemplateTypeMacro(vtkBuffer, vtkObject)

recompile, and see if that fixes the warnings. If that works for you,
I'll push this into the next release.

BTW, what operating system are you on? I'm curious about why these
issues haven't been popping up elsewhere...

Thanks,
Dave

Oops, I sent that too quickly -- the vtkBuffer.h line should actually be:

   vtkTemplateTypeMacro(vtkBuffer<ScalarTypeT>, vtkObject)

with the template argument.

1) Yes, the client code should send the proper event to the server. But
that event might not be properly handle by the ParaView backend while it is
for VTK.

Look at ${pv_src}/Web/Python/paraview/web/protocols.py
 #ParaViewWebMouseHandler
vs ${pv_src}/VTK/Web/Python/vtk/web/protocols.py
#vtkWebMouseHandler

it seems the paraview one is missing:

      if event.has_key("scroll"):
            pvevent.SetScroll(event["scroll"])

Just add it to your paraview python file.

2) The WebGL viewer is fairly limited so I don't see much thing that can be
done to fix it. But we are working on a version of VTK on the client that
will allow to have very similar rendering results between the server and
the client.
Once VTK.js start supporting scalar bars, we'll start migrating the code to
use VTK.js for local rendering.
Otherwise, you can always try to fix the code, but first make sure the
server is also properly sending the range of your scalar for building that
scalar bar before trying to fix the client code.

you need to provide your globals to LoadPlugin, so it can add H5PartReader into
the main scope.
Otherwise, you will need to use the full path which should be something
along that

servermanager.sources.H5PartReader


def LoadPlugin(filename, remote=True, ns=None):

    """Loads a ParaView plugin and updates this module with new constructors

    if any. The remote argument (default to True) is to specify whether

    the plugin will be loaded on client (remote=False) or on server
(remote=True).

    If you loaded the simple module with from paraview.simple import *,

    make sure to pass globals() as an argument::


        LoadPlugin("myplugin", False, globals()) # to load on client

        LoadPlugin("myplugin", True, globals())  # to load on server

        LoadPlugin("myplugin", ns=globals())     # to load on server


    Otherwise, the new functions will not appear in the global namespace."""

Hi,

This is the classic 80% / 20% software problem where 80% of the users only
use 20% of the capabilities but each 20% is significantly different.

As for creating your own Catalyst edition, that is definitely possible.
There's some information at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Generating_Catalyst_Source_Tree on how to
create your own source tree. There is a bit more detailed information in
the Catalyst Users Guide (
http://www.paraview.org/files/catalyst/docs/ParaViewCatalystUsersGuide_v2.pdf)
in Chapter 4.

The recommended way of doing this is by starting off with editions (you can
use more than one of the existing editions when creating your customized
edition) and then adding in your own after that. That way you don't have to
worry about all of the details for things like Python or rendering.

Best,
Andy

Corinna,

Does this example help?

paraview/Examples/Plugins/PropertyWidgets

Basically, you define a custom Qt widget for a property and in the
proxy XML tell ParaView to use the custom widget for the property with
the "panel_widget" attribute.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] load plugin through python scripts

The problem is still not solved.
I added ns=globals() and tried both remote=False and remote=True. Neither
of them works. The same error message persist: Plot[plotname] =
H5PartReader(FileName=maindirectory+subdirectory+name)
NameError: global name 'H5PartReader' is not defined

2) I also tried to replace H5PartReader  with
servermanager.sources.H5PartReader.
It still does not work. This time, there is no error message but the data
was not load successfully and there is some ?Output Message?:

Some proxy is added as input but was not registered with Proxy Manager.
This is not recommended.

Subject: [Paraview] Specify value for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when compiling
	Catalyst?
Message-ID: <A488D51A-A4AC-43B3-AA40-646C32B871B6@snumerics.com>

Hi All,

 

I was wondering what the appropriate way to specify a value for the cmake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is when compiling a Catalyst edition.? The editions make use of a cmake.sh script, and I?ve just been manually adding the variable to that file because I can?t quite figure out how to tell the script to also use a value for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX that I pass to it.

Does anyone have experience with doing this? I ask because I always want to change the install directory to be a different location than the default location in the root directory that Catalyst usually tries to install in.


Thank you,

Chris Neal

Message-ID: <CAJZHu4Ro1Wf1AnCiOvt2ONs26L_VA=E8atc822d782N1ycx6rQ@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering, if ParaviewWeb takes security concerns serious. Studying
the server code, I found no measures against access to files outside of the
specified --data-dir, against XSS or injection of arbitrary code in analogy
to SQL injection.

Would you consider ParaviewWeb secure when the server is open to anybody in
the internet, or is its purpose only to be run within intranets behind a
firewall? Assuming that ParaviewWeb has not undergone any security audits,
are there any commercial alternatives?

Thank you
Sven

Have you or anyone successfully built and installed on Win7 64 with Visual
Studio 2015? I always get errors when building or opening the paraview.exe.
For Qt the 4.x versions seem to have only x86 installs but I installed 4.8
anyway. When trying Qt 5.7 I get a failed build with 3 errors and over 350
warnings. Also noted that in Cmake configure it would still reference Qt 4
even after setting Qt5_DIR Qt5Core_DIR Qt5Widgets_DIR  etc and changing all
paths to proper reference directories. The only fix was to uninstall Qt 4
but I was able to get a build with no errors when it was using both Qt 4 &
5 strangely but when opening paraview,exe the 'system error' message was
Qt5Widgets.dll does not exist. It does though and is in "C:\Program Files
(x86)\Qt\5.7\msvc2015_64\bin\" so I tried to manually change that in any
Cmake config file I could find but nothing worked out. I've tried hundreds
of things over the past three days and read and followed the wiki many
times and I'm coming to the conclusion no one is using Win 64 which seems
strange to me but I guess everyone is using Unix.

you need python in the path for QT 5 to build for windows. specifically python with bz2 module.... both running configure and nmake

the next problem you will encounter after getting past the QT 5 which I am still stuck is to build python. Python 3 will compile with vs2015 express, python 2.x will not. c++ time zone related variables changes. But I am not able to compile pv with python 3.....  I even tried to fix the time zone related compile but end up with linking error at the very end.

because of this, i think win7 or win10 pv will only work with vs2013 express.....

When I read in Plot3D function files my variables are named Function0, Function1, etc. I can rename them with the calculator filter, but doing this each time gets tedious. I was wondering if there was a way to point paraview to a text file containing the correct names during the read so that they would automatically come in with the correct names.

Thanks,

Just to add what I know that there is already on the Internet regarding 
ParaView related forums:

 1. There are two forums at CFD-Online's Forums (CFD = Computational
    Fluid Dynamics) for discussions about ParaView:
     1. http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-paraview/ - oriented
        towards issues directly related to using ParaView with OpenFOAM
     2. http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/paraview/ - oriented towards
        general questions about using ParaView
 2. stackoverflow.com already has several questions there:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/paraview
 3. The Computational Science group has a few questions there as well:
    http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/search?q=paraview
 4. StackExchange should be open to the creation of new groups:
    http://stackexchange.com/


That being said, there is an advantage to the mailing list (although I 
have trouble with it myself, because I'm more familiar with forums): we 
don't need to sign-in to a website to answer to questions.

Either way, StackExchange is a group endeavour, so it can be open by 
anyone to start a group for it! Problem is having enough people joining it.

Yes, this looks like the information I need. Though I haven't found the

Message-ID: <CA+yQjJUE44FiijAk5rU6+5PboQoTWBgQCq0yVK4LkYLYHbLRRw@mail.gmail.com>

I can not find a FEA tool that can import not only CAD models but the whole
assembly WITH constraints/joints. I don't think Paraview can but do you
think (or has any attempted) it would be possible to link Paraview with the
geometry kernel/geometric constraint solver of the originating CAD modeler
eg. Solidworks, Creo, Fusion360 etc. The methods are exposed apparently as
I have emailed those companies but I never see anyone actually do it in an
open source tool. I have found a couple of commercial apps that can do it
but of course they are not saying how they did it or any help and I'm
pretty sure because of their price point they are licensing the kernels eg
Parasolid. I did find a Matlab based program that actually could so I know
it to be possible without having to license the kernel/solver but you need
to have the CAD program installed and maybe opened. If you know of a FEA
open source tool that can I would love to know or ANY tool that can. Any
help would be great thanks

I have disabled all firewalls and set xhost to disable access control, but to no avail.
Starting paraview with x-forwarding works, however this can't work on multiple rendering displays, I assume.

With superbuild, I'd strongly recommend using Ninja instead of the VS
IDE. Ninja should also ensure that CPU utilization is maximum.

Mega Mind,

I have a project that is using ParaView with Qt 5.7 on Windows.  Of course
we use VS 2013 still, so that may be the difference.  It still sounds like
you forgot to set the PARAVIEW_QT_VERSION to 5.  If this is 4 (the
default), the CMake scripts will ignore Qt5.  I think it may be smart
enough to default to 5 when there is no Qt4 preset which may be why that
build worked.  Our build machine has both Qt4 and Qt5 installed and it
works fine.  Still, I don't know if anyone has tried Qt5 + VS 2015....
Anyway, your runtime error with the dll not found?  That is a Windows
thing.  Not found means it is not in the PATH environment variable's list
of folders.  Windows doesn't bake into the executable the paths to its
runtime dependencies.  Linux and OSX do, which is why you can typically run
things from a build tree there without any problems.  But to run it from
Windows, you will need to add the Qt5 dll's directory to your PATH or move
it to the same directory as the executable which needs it.

Simon,

The ParaView Superbuild uses a precompiled python 2.7 that was built with
VS 2008.  Python 2.x doesn't support any newer versions (maybe 2010, but
we've never used that version of python).  Since the API we link against is
pure C, there are no ABI issues with using this prebuilt version.  You
should be able to look in the superbuild and find the path for the zip file
with the prebuilt python and download/use that one.  I know Python 3 is
supported in VTK, but I'm not sure it is fully supported in ParaView yet.

HTH,
Shawn

Dear Michael,

Even though this doesn't exist, it would be relatively easy to add. This
would be through this reader:

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPlot3DMetaReader.html

I suggest that you create a feature request on the VTK issue tracker:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues

Hopefully, someone will pick it up during the next VTK or ParaView
hackathon.

Best,

Hi,
I'm currently using qt 5.6 with vs 2015 and python 2.7 and everything is building correctly. I still didn't try QT 5.7.  On Windows, you need to make sure your PATH are set correctly. Verify that your CMake PATH isn't set before your qt or else your ParaView executable will find some qt dll in the CMake folder. 
DLL not found - > http://www.dependencywalker.com/  This will help you track down your problems.

Have you or anyone successfully built and installed on Win7 64 with Visual Studio 2015? I always get errors when building or opening the paraview.exe. For Qt the 4.x versions seem to have only x86 installs but I installed 4.8 anyway. When trying
 Qt 5.7 I get a failed build with 3 errors and over 350 warnings. Also noted that in Cmake configure it would still reference Qt 4 even after setting Qt5_DIR Qt5Core_DIR Qt5Widgets_DIR  etc and changing all paths to proper reference directories. The only fix
 was to uninstall Qt 4 but I was able to get a build with no errors when it was using both Qt 4 & 5 strangely but when opening paraview,exe the 'system error' message was Qt5Widgets.dll does not exist. It does though and is in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Qt\5.7\msvc2015_64\bin\"
 so I tried to manually change that in any Cmake config file I could find but nothing worked out. I've tried hundreds of things over the past three days and read and followed the wiki many times and I'm coming to the conclusion no one is using Win 64 which
 seems strange to me but I guess everyone is using Unix.

Hey guys,

 

I don?t know if it helps, but the way that I?ve been able to get around the issue is to:

1.) Make a directory in the ParaView build directory called ?tempbin?
2.) Copy all binaries from the ParaView ?bin? directory into ?tempbin?

3.) Delete all files in ?bin?
4.) Create symbolic links to all files in the ?tempbin? directory so that the ?bin? directory is full of symbolic links
5.) Re-do ?make?? ?( it?s just what I had to do in order to get it to work)
6.) do ?make install?

Now all of the header files and things are moved to the correct locations and the make install process doesn?t result in binaries being removed from the ?bin? directory.? It?s a bit of a headscratcher, but I guess this fix results in that IF block that checks for symbolic links status not being executed in file: VTK/Utilities/HashSource/cmake_install.cmake:46

Best regards,
Chris Neal

For the case outlined in this email chain, it is the ParaView source. I?m currently using Paraview5.2.  I have also had the same trouble with: Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials, with the symbolic link ad-hoc solution working with this case as well.

Hi Chris,

Are you trying to build from a Catalyst edition or directly from the full ParaView source? I want to make sure that we're going in the proper direction when trying to fix this problem.

Thanks,

Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Specify value for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when
 compiling Catalyst?

Hi Utkarsh,

I have one more question related to the Catalyst edition. I have compiled the ?Essentials? build. I used the command below(for reference) to configure the edition, and everything seems to work out.

./../Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials/cmake.sh -CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES:BOOL=ON ../Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials

I?m trying to compile the Catalyst examples that are located in the original ParaView source tree using the Catalyst edition. I used the following command to configure the examples:

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON /home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/

cmake does not complain when I configure with the command above. But when I type ?make? I see an error that a header file cannot be located. It?s a header file that I know for a fact is located in the ?Essentials? build directory under ?/include/paraview-5.1. 

I tried using the -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=[path to ?/include/paraview-5.1] , but cmake tells me that the manually specified variable was not used.  The full line that I?m trying to use to configure the examples is:

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build/include/paraview-5.1 /home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/

Am I not specifying the include path correctly?

Thank you,
Chris Neal

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb security

Hi Sven,

We do take security seriously.  Several actions have been made to make the
exposed protocols more secured.
It is true, that legacy protocol like ParaViewWebPipelineManager does not
check for code injection. But that protocol is deprecated and will be
removed for the next ParaView release (5.2).

In the current ParaViewWebProxyManager we do check that the user is allowed
to create the given requested proxy.

@exportRpc("pv.proxy.manager.create")
    def create(self, functionName, parentId):
        """
        Creates a new filter/source proxy as a child of the specified
        parent proxy.  Returns the proxy state for the newly created
        proxy as a JSON object.
        """
        name = self.validate(functionName)

        if not name:
            return { 'success': False,
                     'reason': '"' + functionName + '" was not valid and
could not be evaluated' }

       [...]

Regarding the access outside of the --data-dir we are preventing the user
from listing any file outside of that directory

        if not currentPath.startswith(normBase):
            print "### CAUTION =========================================="
            print " Attempt to get to another root path ###"
            print "  => Requested:", relativeDir
            print "  => BaseDir:", normBase
            print "  => Computed path:", currentPath
            print "### CAUTION =========================================="
            currentPath = normBase

Although, it is true that we are not guarding the "open" function which is
a mistake and it will be address right away.

Regarding your question, ParaViewWeb tend to be deployed on secured
environments (intranet and/or behind firewalls) but could be deployed on
the internet if specific actions are taking care. The authentication should
be delegated to your infrastructure and your infrastructure should be
responsible of launching the ParaView process under the user privilege. Our
Python launcher is provided as an example and for quick demos in a secured
environment but can not be considered secured. Since we delegate the
launching and the authentication to your infrastructure, you should also
provide a mechanism to share in a secure way the secret key that was used
to launch your application. The goal of that secret key is to prevent any
user that could have guessed your session ID (endpoint URL) to connect to
your dedicated WebSocket.

Then, after that, we are assuming some kind of user responsibility as we
seems to trust them enough to use server side resources. Specially as they
can still bring down the machine by filling up the memory and/or using all
the CPU via complex geometry/pipeline processing. In which case, it will be
fairly hard to prevent such behavior.

Regarding your last question, we do not provide any commercial alternative
but we provide support which could be used to improve our current Open
source solutions to match your expectations or create new products which

I am not sure I totally understand by a ?private pipeline,? but I think you mean that you have a pipeline that you set up in ParaView over and over again and you would like to add a button or something to ParaView to automatically create this pipeline with one click.

The short answer is, yes. There are many ways to customize ParaView. The easiest way is to add a macro based on a Python script. There are a pair of exercises in The ParaView Tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) that demonstrate how to do this.

Chris,

I suspect there's a bug in the "install development files" for a
Catalyst edition. Can you try pointing the ParaView_DIR for the
Catalyst Examples to the Catalyst build directory instead? Does that
work?

I?m not sure I understand 100% what you?re asking me to do. Do you want me to copy the Catalyst examples directory from my ParaView source tree into my Catalyst ?Essentials? edition source tree and then run the configure command?

Or do you want me to point the ParaView build for the DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable?

Hi Utkarsh,

I pointed to my ParaView_build directory and the examples compile without any errors.

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/neal/software/ParaView_build -DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON /home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/

Hope this helps,
Chris Neal

Chris,

Cool. There's indeed a bug in the install rules. I'll have to it
fixed. BTW, I am assuming /home/neal/software/ParaView_build is the
direcotory where you build the Catalyst edition, is that correct?

Subject: [Paraview] Private pipeline
Message-ID: <DUB402-EAS411E79EFF4FB453E485E24A8120@phx.gbl>

If I'm working in multiple layouts my pipeline browser becomes a list of thousands of loosely coupled objects. I wish each layout had own ?custom? pipeline browser, is it possible to make it as part of plug-in?

I am not sure I totally understand by a ?private pipeline,? but I think you mean that you have a pipeline that you set up in ParaView over and over again and you would like to add a button or something to ParaView to automatically create this pipeline with one click.

The short answer is, yes. There are many ways to customize ParaView. The easiest way is to add a macro based on a Python script. There are a pair of exercises in The ParaView Tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) that demonstrate how to do this.

The catalyst edition was built at: /home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build

/home/neal/software/ParaView_build is where I built a version of Paraview with Catalyst, development files, and no gui.

    Cool. There's indeed a bug in the install rules. I'll have to it
    fixed. BTW, I am assuming /home/neal/software/ParaView_build is the
    direcotory where you build the Catalyst edition, is that correct?

Wow! Thousands of objects in your pipeline browser? You must have some scripts to generate all those objects (or spend hours each time setting up your pipelines).

There is no way in to get the pipeline browser to group sections of the pipeline or show subsections of it. It is conceivable to create your own version of a pipeline browser that showed subsets of the pipeline like you want and put that in your own plugin, but it would be a fairly difficult programming project.

You might consider simpler alternatives. Rather than create thousands of objects in your pipeline browser, perhaps you can create custom filters that encapsulate (and hide) lots of filters inside it. Implementing filters in VTK/ParaView using several other filters internally is pretty common. It is much easier to create a plugin with a custom filter than to make a plugin with a custom pipeline browser. You could also consider using the Custom Filter feature (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Custom_Filters). It allows you to create a metafilter from a collection of other filters in the ParaView GUI. It is easier than making a plugin, but has more limited functionality.

In that case, try the following instead from a clean directory to
build the examples using the Catalyst edition.

cmake -DParaView_DIR:PATH=/home/neal/software/Catalyst/Catalyst-v5.1.0-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials_build
-DBUILD_FORTRAN_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON
/home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/

When I try that command I see the following after I type ?make?:

/home/neal/software/ParaView/Examples/Catalyst/CxxOverlappingAMRExample/FEAdaptor.cxx:4:23: fatal error: vtkAMRBox.h: No such file or directory
 #include <vtkAMRBox.h>
                       ^
compilation terminated.

It seems like it just can?t find the include directory in the Catalyst edition.

Hey guys,

Just a bump in case anyone who can answer my question missed this.
Basically, is it possible to specify two input array drop down menus in a
Custom Filter XML file and get the array information from both?  I can get
two drop down menus in the Properties panel, but can only get information
from one of them.

Thanks,
Evan Kao

See the attached plugin XML. You just need to specify the array index
as default_values other it  gets initialized to 0.

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst example pops up render window when running
Message-ID: <153DB747-8B3B-452A-8AB7-C58F37BA49C9@snumerics.com>

Hi,

 

I?m trying to run an example case for Catalyst to test my build. The case that I?m interested in is the ?CxxFullExample?.? There is a SampleScripts directory that comes with the example. It seems to run fine. I used Paraview 5.1 to open the .vtu output file from the example and generated a new catalyst script that outputs .png images of a view that I created. 

 

When I try to run the example with my newly created script I get errors about: 
ERROR: In /home/neal/software/ParaView5.2/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 481

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x3234210): bad X server connection. DISPLAY=[SN-HPC-0:14212] *** Process received signal ***

Which, if I run the example in a terminal connected to the computer, I see that the script that Paraview created opens up a window on screen and displays my view. I didn?t check any boxes or options during the catalyst script creation process that requested an on-screen rendering. I?m at a loss for why this is happening. How can I request that views be saved to a file without having to be shown directly on the screen?

I?m using Paraview 5.2 on OpenSUSE 13.2.

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Subject: [Paraview] Feasibility of and documentation on implementing a
	Paraview Client.
Message-ID: <DUB408-EAS7704B95E007CFD307AA823F5120@phx.gbl>

Hi,

 

For various reasons I aim to replace the standard client of paraview and use
the data and rendering servers as is. As such I need to implement the client
that communicates with the servers. I have been unable to find any
documentation on this and I would appreciate pointers to any documentation
of protocols and APIs that are used. 

 

The reason for why I am doing this is because I am trying to utilize the
power of Paraview and VTK inside another system. The problem is that my VTK
program that acts as a light renderer does not work inside the system
because it can not obtain an OpenGL context. As such I wish to remove the
rendering from the system and instead communicate like the design already
permits.

 

What I need it only for the data and rendered frames to be available on the
client and for the client to update important info such as the camera
transform and transfer functions.

 

Thank you for any help you can provide.

 

Yours,

Magnus Elden

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview with osmesa cmake issue
Message-ID: <0DDD6DD3-BFF1-4328-ACB9-46882380D37F@snumerics.com>

Hi,

I?m trying to compile a version of Paraview that uses osmesa. I downloaded the ParaView soruce, and I?m following the directions from: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

 

The tutorial gives a sample bash script for compiling with mesa. The only trouble that I?m having is that I don?t quite understand how to write a cmake shell script. I gave it a shot and it thinks my build directory is my source directory. I thought I passed the correct cmake variable to tell cmake where my source is and where my build directory are, but it can?t understand what I have provided. Below is the shell script that I?m trying to execute. Things above the space are my usual build options and things below are for Mesa. It can?t seem to understand those first 2 lines under ?cmake?.

Any thoughts on what could be causing this issue?

Hi Chris,

What are you passing in for $*?  CMake, when run in a directory without a
CMakeCache file interprets the current directory as the build directory and
its last (non -ed) argument as the source directory.

HTH,
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] Merging two datasets
Message-ID: <D3D7AA22.6B76%salazardetro1@llnl.gov>

Hello,

I have two data sets that share the same mesh and are both cell data. I want to put them together in a single dataset so I can extract a selection of cells given a criteria from one of the original datasets and then apply a filter to the other dataset. I tried doing GroupDataSet, but it doesn?t correctly plot one of the datasets. In the selection of the coloring I can see ?partial? next to the original dataset?s name. How can we do this?

Thanks
Miguel

Not sure if this would work, but how about just moving the variables from one dataset to the other?  This is done with the Append Attributes filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Merging two datasets

Hello,

I have two data sets that share the same mesh and are both cell data. I want to put them together in a single dataset so I can extract a selection of cells given a criteria from one of the original datasets and then apply a filter to the other dataset. I tried doing GroupDataSet, but it doesn't correctly plot one of the datasets. In the selection of the coloring I can see "partial" next to the original dataset's name. How can we do this?

Thanks
Miguel

You should elaborate on the "various reasons". All that you described is
done by the paraview application, connected to a remove pvserver. You can
extend or reduce paraview's functionality (
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_Custom_Applications).

Apart from the wiki, you can only search the web for discussions of similar
topics or read the Paraview Guide (book).

I think you should explain why you don't want to use the paraview
application as your client.

Hi,

 

I think you should explain why you don't want to use the paraview application as your client.

 

I am using the Unreal Engine 4 for my project and I want to use the power of Paraview to read and render scientific volume data. I tried writing a small program using the VTK library, but I was unable to get it to work due to the program complaining about not being able to find/create an OpenGL context. As such I am forced to separate the rendering and the Unreal program. Having the client and the servers separated is something that Paraview supports natively and as such I do not imagine that it should be more difficult than to implement a code only client that my UE4 program uses to interface with the Paraview servers. 

 

As you can see, I am unable to use the paraview application because I will be using another application. Since UE4 has no real support for volume data or scientific visualization I am left between a choice of implementing everything that Paraview already has or writing a new client that handles the translation between my UE4 program and the Paraview server. 

The former option will force me to spend a lot of time implementing an inferior version of parts of Paraview and the latter require me to create a client that is able to communicate properly with the servers. I would argue that the latter is less work if good documentation and specifications are to be found. Further, I would think that the project can scale much more effectively if I am able to utilize the Paraview servers.

 

I hope to feed the paraview servers with user made updates and then feed the resulting render back to the UE4 application in order to present it to the user.

 

Yours, 

Magnus Elden

Sorry, my Paraview experience is too limited and my Unreal knowledge is
zero, so that I won't be able to give you anything else than some ideas.
First of all, Paraview cannot compete with game engines in terms of
rendering speed, because the data structures are more complicated.
Still, if you write your own "Paraview client", you'll end up with the
original paraview application reduced to only the 3d view widget. You could
suppress its output and grab the image data.
I guess you have already considered fixing the OpenGL setup. If you are
running on a headless cluster, you could install the osmesa implementation.
But without a thorough understanding of how you are interfacing with the
Unreal engine in detail and what data type and sizes and frame rates you
expect, I cannot suggest anything else than following the wiki on custom
Paraview applications. I am sure, others on this list will help.

Hi Magnus,

I don't know much about getting ParaView to work in the client-server mode
you describe and less about the Unreal engine, but if you are willing to
sacrifice a little bit of rendering speed would be to build VTK with OSMesa
and let it do software rendering rather than requiring a hardware context
(which it can't seem to get due to some interference with Unreal).  I just
thought I would point out the option, you can try it and decide if you
think the rendering speed hit is too much.

HTH,
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] Question about colorize a link-path between particles
	with a scalar
Message-ID: <F8E9D246-7F08-404A-956D-44F425BBA840@coria.fr>

Dear all,

I am trying to visualise the path of one particle with the line colored by a scalar. But I don?t really know how to do that.
For example, I want to visualize the evolution of the temperature along the path of my particle.
I have a data file with point coordinates (each line represents its evolution in time) and some scalars (like temperature, diameter) as input.
"x", "y", "z", "scalar1", "scalar2"
0, 0, 0, 300, 12.5
0, 12, 7, 302, 35.4
...

What I had already done is to convert my data into Table Of Points. Then, I used this Programmable Filter to connect the points :

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
pdo.Allocate()
for i in range(0, numPoints-1):
    points = [i, i+1]
    # VTK_LINE is 3
    pdo.InsertNextCell(3, 2, points)


I have found, on the Paraview Wiki, a way to give a unique color for the line that link all the coordinates :

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
pdo.Allocate()

colors = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
colors.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
colors.SetName("Colors")
 
for i in range(0, numPoints-1):
    points = [i, i+1]
    # VTK_LINE is 3
    pdo.InsertNextCell(3, 2, points)
    colors.InsertNextTuple3(255,0,0)
 
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(colors)
del colors


Do you have any idea how I can do that (with a Programmable Filter or not) ?

Thank you in advance.

Does the Append Attributes filter do what you want? That combines the fields of the two data sets into one.

Mega Mind,

I have a project that is using ParaView with Qt 5.7 on Windows.  Of course we use VS 2013 still, so that may be the difference.  It still sounds like you forgot to set the PARAVIEW_QT_VERSION to 5.  If this is 4 (the default), the CMake scripts will ignore Qt5.  I think it may be smart enough to default to 5 when there is no Qt4 preset which may be why that build worked.  Our build machine has both Qt4 and Qt5 installed and it works fine.  Still, I don't know if anyone has tried Qt5 + VS 2015....  Anyway, your runtime error with the dll not found?  That is a Windows thing.  Not found means it is not in the PATH environment variable's list of folders.  Windows doesn't bake into the executable the paths to its runtime dependencies.  Linux and OSX do, which is why you can typically run things from a build tree there without any problems.  But to run it from Windows, you will need to add the Qt5 dll's directory to your PATH or move it to the same directory as the executable which needs it.

Simon,

The ParaView Superbuild uses a precompiled python 2.7 that was built with VS 2008.  Python 2.x doesn't support any newer versions (maybe 2010, but we've never used that version of python).  Since the API we link against is pure C, there are no ABI issues with using this prebuilt version.  You should be able to look in the superbuild and find the path for the zip file with the prebuilt python and download/use that one.  I know Python 3 is supported in VTK, but I'm not sure it is fully supported in ParaView yet.

HTH,
Shawn

Have you or anyone successfully built and installed on Win7 64 with Visual Studio 2015? I always get errors when building or opening the paraview.exe. For Qt the 4.x versions seem to have only x86 installs but I installed 4.8 anyway. When trying Qt 5.7 I get a failed build with 3 errors and over 350 warnings. Also noted that in Cmake configure it would still reference Qt 4 even after setting Qt5_DIR Qt5Core_DIR Qt5Widgets_DIR  etc and changing all paths to proper reference directories. The only fix was to uninstall Qt 4 but I was able to get a build with no errors when it was using both Qt 4 & 5 strangely but when opening paraview,exe the 'system error' message was Qt5Widgets.dll does not exist. It does though and is in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Qt\5.7\msvc2015_64\bin\" so I tried to manually change that in any Cmake config file I could find but nothing worked out. I've tried hundreds of things over the past three days and read and followed the wiki many times and I'm coming to the conclusion no one is using Win 64 which seems strange to me but I guess everyone is using Unix.

Note that some things may be buggy when building against Qt5, I don't know the full list of current issues, just that there are some.  Also note that you have to specify the location of Qt5 differently to CMake.  CMake doesn't use the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable for Qt5, instead it uses Qt5_DIR.  This should point to .../lib/cmake/Qt5 inside your Qt5 install.

Hi Chris,

What are you passing in for $*?  CMake, when run in a directory without a CMakeCache file interprets the current directory as the build directory and its last (non -ed) argument as the source directory.

HTH,

Hi,

I?m trying to compile a version of Paraview that uses osmesa. I downloaded the ParaView soruce, and I?m following the directions from: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

 

The tutorial gives a sample bash script for compiling with mesa. The only trouble that I?m having is that I don?t quite understand how to write a cmake shell script. I gave it a shot and it thinks my build directory is my source directory. I thought I passed the correct cmake variable to tell cmake where my source is and where my build directory are, but it can?t understand what I have provided. Below is the shell script that I?m trying to execute. Things above the space are my usual build options and things below are for Mesa. It can?t seem to understand those first 2 lines under ?cmake?.

I did some further testing, but can't find anything obviously wrong with 
our setup w.r.t OpenGL versions. I do notice that window setup in SDL2 
fails due to the XRandR support finding no outputs configured on the 
graphics cards (there's nothing connected as these are cluster nodes). 
GLFW3 reports "X11: RandR monitor support seems broken", but initializes 
and renders (on :0.0) anyway when requesting a 3.2 context. Does 
ParaView, or VTK, use XRandR to get a valid window on which an OpenGL 
context is created? Could this be a reason I see the 3.2 context 
creation failure?

Regards,
Paul

Hi,

Can a plugin (a pvserver plugin I guess)  access the rendered pixels ?

A long time ago, we had to modify one of the base VTK class to access rendered pixel (a la ?glReadPixels?) and recompile the whole thing.
It would be nice to do that in a plugin...

I tried writing a small program using the VTK library, but I was unable to get it to work due to the program complaining about not being able to find/create an OpenGL context. As such I am forced to separate the rendering and the Unreal program. Having the client and the servers separated is something that Paraview supports natively and as such I do not imagine that it should be more difficult than to implement a code only client that my UE4 program uses to interface with the Paraview servers.

Since UE4 has no real support for volume data or scientific visualization I am left between a choice of implementing everything that Paraview already has or writing a new client that handles the translation between my UE4 program and the Paraview server.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualizing data in vtkOverlappingAMR format
Message-ID: <57B4A9F4.2060304@uw.edu>

Hello all,

Our group are trying to use Paraview to visualize output from our code 
(http://www.clawpack.org/). I wrote a python script to convert our 
output to 2D _*vtkOverlappingAMR*_ format. This format follows the 
template given by an example in the VTK (not Paraview) source code: 
vtk/Examples/AMR/Cxx/Generate2DAMRDataSetWithPulse.cxx

But when I use Paraview to open a single vtk file, it get crashed 
occasionally with "Segmentation fault (core dumped)". The even more 
weird thing is that if you click on "apply" fast enough after open the 
vtk file, it is very likely to crash. But if you do these operations in 
Paraview slower, it will probably be fine and everything get visualized 
normally.

Thanks!

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst example on dynamic producer setup
Message-ID: <57B4B5F8.70806@cineca.it>

Hi everybody: we are starting instrumenting one Fortran simulation code 
with Paraview catalyst.
We have started from the fortran full example as our grid is basically a 
3d rectilinear grid that we are currently
handling like imagedata.
Our code has a quite high number of scalar fields ( 50 ) and a single 
velocity field.
If we use a single input and a single data producer with all the field 
inside, the Paraview client slows down, probably due to memory usage or 
transfer.
For visualization we would just need the vector field and one or two of 
the scalar fields.
It would really good to be able to dinamically ( possibly each time 
step) being able to select which of the available scalar variable pass 
as scalar field.
In the examples the c++ adaptor code add fields in a fixed way. We would 
like to pass information from python ( and maybe from Paraview GUI ) to 
the adaptor code to dynamically change it's behaviour.

Is it at all possible? any hints or better example code.

Sorry if dumb question, I' m a newbie in this

Thanks in advance.

Hi
How to run a python scripts on a cluster node. I am expecting to submit my

The command that I currently using in my job submit scripts (slurm script)

pvbatch myscripts.py

I guess ParaView is missing more code on the server side. ;-)
This time, it will be in the C++.


${ParaView-src}/VTK/Web/Core/vtkWebApplication.cxx =>
vtkPVWebApplication::HandleInteractionEvent

vs

${ParaView-src}/Web/Core/vtkPVWebApplication.cxx =>
vtkWebApplication::HandleInteractionEvent

The VTK one has:

  // Handle scroll action if any
  if(event->GetScroll()) {
    iren->SetEventInformation(0, 0, ctrlKey, shiftKey, event->GetKeyCode(),
0);
    iren->MouseMoveEvent();
    iren->RightButtonPressEvent();
    iren->SetEventInformation(0, event->GetScroll()*10, ctrlKey, shiftKey,
event->GetKeyCode(), 0);
    iren->MouseMoveEvent();
    iren->RightButtonReleaseEvent();
    this->Internals->ImageCache[view].NeedsRender = true;
    return true;
  }

If you got it working, could you submit a pull request on our gitlab and
assign it to me so those fix could be part of PV 5.2?

Thanks,

Seb

shouldn't work scroll wheel in vtk.js? e.g. here 
https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/examples/HttpSceneLoader.html
I have to compile the whole sources? I use pv of salome meca. I hope it 
isn't to complicated and cpu intensive.

vtk.js interaction does not currently implement zooming. So the current
behavior is expected.

What are you trying to do with vtk.js and salome? vtk.js has not been
released yet and is a pure JavaScript/client library.

Hi,

This is possible but at this point requires custom coding the Python script
to specify which fields are needed. This should be done during the
RequestDataDescription() call. You can use vtkCPInputDataDescription's
IsFieldNeeded() and IsFieldPointData() methods to specify what's needed in
the Python script and then create the requested VTK data arrays in the
adaptor after that. There are plans to allow the GUI script generation to
specify which data arrays are needed but no concrete date (likely over a
year unless there's significant support for the development effort) for
when that functionality will be available.

Cheers,
Andy

Thank's for the prompt replay, we do not mind custom code the scripts, 
It would be good to have usage code examples
or pointers to open source projects that are using Catalyst in such a way.

Any hints will be really appreciated.

Best regards
Luigi

I'll see if I can find an example online. In the meantime, another option
would be to pass in all arrays and then use the Pass Arrays filter to
select the ones you want. If you're using VTK's zero-copy functionality for
the vtkDataArrays this should be a very efficient way to do what you want.

Best,
Andy

Message-ID: <e20b56b0e1cf4688896905ab2e327a87@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

A new feature of ParaView 5.1.2 is a Getting Started Guide.  This can be found on the startup screen and also in the new and improved Help menu.  Any feedback from the community?  Will this Getting Started Guide be helpful for new users?  Did we miss anything?  Too much information, or too little?

Also, did we miss anything important in the new Help menu?

Thanks as always,

Alan Scott

Subject: [Paraview] PythonQt plugin build error
Message-ID: <DUB402-EAS3544008C799DBBB3965D1BEA8150@phx.gbl>

Hi,
I have a problem with PythonQt plugin building:

c:\users\buildsystem\desktop\paraview-build\plugins\pythonqtplugin\pqPluginDecorators.h(129): error C2039: 'getWidget': is not a member of 'pqRenderViewBase'
c:\users\buildsystem\desktop\paraview-src\qt\core\pqRenderViewBase.h(43): note: see declaration of 'pqRenderViewBase'

I guess getWidget method from wrapped_methods.txt, should I remove it?

>From class today, you said you would be able to look into how to take a profile of a dataset by entering x,y,z coordinates to get data from nearest cell or node (e.g. if you want a boundary layer profile by sampling velocity in a vertical direction from a wall at a certain x location in the streamwise direction - assume 2D and flow is traveling in the +x direction and +y is away from the wall where the "wall" is at y=0).

Hello

I would like to move the Glyph3D Representation to a Plugin.
We had several user complain about that, one (new user) can often get mixed
up between Glyph3D Representation and Glyph Filter.

I already have a MR ready for review, i you would like to manage this
differently
eg : keeping the representation class in ParaView or using a cmake var
instead, please do so.

Thanks, we have tried to follow your previous suggestion but were not 
able to find a place in python where to set the information regarding 
which fields to add.

Any example of passing info from python to c++ or fortran adaptors would 
be of great value for us.


Your other suggestion for Pass Arrays filter requires that we use VTK's 
zero-copy.

according to
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/tree/master/Examples/Catalyst/Readme

there seems two ways of re-using simulation memory:
CxxMappedDataArrayExample and
CxxSOADataArrayExample

Which one is better?


Thanks in advance

Ken,

we should not try to use <ctrl> as it won't be possible to trigger it on OS
X as it will be understood as a "Right click" and will bring the popup menu.

But that's great to have that feature.

Hi Thomas,

If you have the ability to view/edit the source code that is generating the output binary file, then I would suggest that you take a look at the vtk manual that describes the data formats. It discusses how to write the data in the vtk format such that the output is either cell data or point data.? VTK data format guide: http://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf

 

If it is a black box, then perhaps you can look into using the filter ?Cell Data To Point Data?. This may yield something helpful, although it is just an interpolation from the cell centers to the cell vertices(If I understand correctly).

Best regards,

Chris Neal

Subject: [Paraview] ImageData extent overlapping within MPI Catalyst pipeline
Message-ID: <57B7450E.1040508@cineca.it>

We are newbie in Catalyst, trying to instrument two CFD MPI simulation 
codes that both have 3d  regular grid
  as it' s data structure. We have followed the fortran example and used 
ImageData for both codes.
The two code are different in the distribution of the memory among 
processors:
one is a differential one who keep overlapping extents among processors: 
this gave no problems.
The other does not have any overlapping as it using 2d fft decomposition.
The imagedata extents of each processor do not overlap as there is no 
need of "ghost" cells.
This result in a strange bug in filter slicing:
If the slicing is done in the paraview client ( the whole field is 
passed to client) and we slice there, slice is ok.
If the slicing is done in the catalyst pipeline, the slice has gaps.

As one difference is the overlapping of each processor extent, is it 
REQUIRED that there is some overlapping of
PointData extents?

Thanks in advance for any help

Best

Luigi

Message-ID: <985C4BC3-C078-4136-8E77-139C1E0C3EAB@snumerics.com>

Hi,

 

I?m playing around with different builds of ParaView(all with catalyst enabled). I?m not using a Catalyst edition because of some build issues that I was having with cmake. One thing that I wanted to understand is:? If I compile a version of ParaView with Catalyst enabled, but GUI disabled, will I still be able to run a Catalyst example that outputs images?

Or would I need to figure out how to compile ParaView with OSMESA?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

OSMesa is only needed if your simulation run environment doesn't have
access to an X server. X is needed to create an OpenGL context.
Without X, OSMesa is one of the ways to create that OpenGL context
necessary for rendering.

Hi Chris,
Catalyst uses the exact same rendering infrastructure as the rest of
ParaView so you if you can render with pvpython and pvserver then you can
render with Catalyst in the same configuration.  If you don't use OSMesa
and instead use "regular" GL then you'll just need to have an X server
available and it's associated plumbing set up for Catalyst to be able to
render.  The nice part about OSMesa builds are that you don't need to deal
with X at all, but then you don't have access to the GPU so your render
performance is significantly reduced.  That may be fine though if your
pipeline is heavily compute-bound instead of render-bound, as is often the
case.  If you want to bypass the X server but still use your GPU, another
option is to enable EGL (warning, still bit experimental).  Currently, it
only works on NVidia GPUs with a very current driver but you get the libGL
benefit of GPU accelerated rendering with the libOSMesa benefit of not
dealing with an X server.

Either way, all three configurations for ParaView will work with Catalyst:
libGL (gpu w/ X, default), libOSMesa (cpu w/o X), and EGL (gpu w/o X).

Thanks for the insight guys,


So if someone is running a Catalyst instrumented code that is compiled on a supercomputer with thousands of back-end nodes, can they link to a ParaView build or a Catalyst Edition and expect the code to work? Do back-end nodes have X servers available to them?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Luigi,

For an image data distributed across multiple ranks with no ghost
cell, there still exists a single point overlap for the points. The
points along the shared boundary are expected to be duplicated among
ranks.  I am thinking your 3D regular grid should be mapped as
cell-data rather than point data. Thus when creating the image, try
setting the point extents as 1+cell-extents and then pass your data to
the cell data arrays rather than point data.

e.g.

int cell_exts[6] = { local domain exts };
int point_exts[6] = { cell_exts[0] , cell_exts[1] + 1,
                                cell_exts[2], cel_exts[3] + 1,
                                cell_exts[4], cel_exts[5] + 1};
vtkNew<vtkImageData> data;
data->SetExtent(point_exts);
data->GetCellData()->SetScalars(...<vtkDataArray subclass with 3d grid data> );

It depends.  If the Catalyst or ParaView build your linking against is
configured to use libGL, then yes.  If, instead, it's configured to use
libOSMesa or EGL, then no.

I personally favor the use of XDMF to import raw binary data. This gives the flexibility to import cell-data and/or node-data

the XDMF code most likely to work for your example is the following:

Given your binary data stored in file "rawdata.bin", double-length floating point, with 4x4x5 cells, i.e. a grid of 5x5x6 vertices...

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.2">
  <Domain>
    <Grid Name="3DMesh" GridType="Uniform">
      <Topology TopologyType="3DCORECTMESH" Dimensions="6 5 5"/>
      <Geometry GeometryType="ORIGIN_DXDYDZ">
         <DataItem Name="Origin" NumberType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">0. 0. 0.</DataItem>
         <DataItem Name="Spacing" NumberType="Float" Dimensions="3" Format="XML">1. 1. 1.</DataItem>
      </Geometry>
      <Attribute Name="Temperature" Active="1" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Cell">

Hello everyone,

I found the solution. For people who are interesting, you have just to turn on the checkbox for ? Copy Arrays ? in the Programmable filter.

Hello.

Is it possible to use vtk actors in programmable source(using python not
c++)? I want to handle click events but when I use custom interactor the
scene always freezes.

No, using actors in the Programmable Source is indeed not a supported use-case.

Thanks a lot Utkarsh.

I' d already tried to pass cell data before asking on the list but 
likely did not set up extent correctly.
The obtained slices:
1) had "holes" as with pointdata
2) were "scrambled"
3) were not smooth ( no interpolation inside cells )

With  your extent suggestion  1) and 2) got fixed
In order to have proper interpolation I tried to add a filter of 
celldata to pointdata.

This did not worked properly as seams between different processors is 
still visible.
I tried to add a filter that clip on a value out of range ( to turn 
struct data into unstruct data ) and then the interpolation seem to work 
much better.
We tried this on a small case, I'm bit worried that this approach to 
convert to unstructured data would cause data explosion and would not 
scale well.

Another option would be to add to the c++ or fortran code some mpi calls 
to retrieve the missing border cells, any example for that?


Thanks again

Luigi

We are trying to add stream tracer filter to a catalyst pipeline that 
handle a simulation with an image data

We got "floating invalid" error, even when running on a single core
A similar pipeline is running ok in paraview with the field saved by

We have also tried to use StreamTraceWith CustomSource with same result.

Thanks in advance for any hints, expecially any example of catalyst

Hi,

I want to use paraview web with SSL. As far as I understand I need

I have my own launcher which opens pvpython with a different port for

It might be possible with pvpython, but I've never done it, I've always
used apache to rely on a single opened port and handle the encryption.

If pvpython directly support the wss connection, you can be good. Usually
the setup, that I do is that I have Apache serving only the port 443
(https) for both the static content and the (wss) websocket endpoint. And I
use a mapping file between the Websocket endpoint that get returned by my
launcher and the host/port I should connect to on the backend to establish
the link between the client and the actual ParaViewWeb server instance.

But that does not mean, that's the only way to do it and if you don't mind
having several port open, I don't see why it could not work.

Well, I guess I haven't tried to run the new Visualizer server on a Windows
machine.
But with ParaView 5.2 (yet to be released), we should have a ParaViewWeb
back in the binaries. So we should make sure our Visualizer command line
tool work on that platform as well.
Although, the command line is more for beginners than anything else as it
only simplify the demo usage. In real word deployment, with a launcher, the
true pvpython command line should be used instead.

Here is an example of what you should see in a working environment:

$ Visualizer -d ~/Downloads/

===============================================================================
| Execute:
| $ /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/bin/pvpython
|   -dr
|   /Users/seb/Documents/code/Web2/visualizer/server/pvw-visualizer.py
|   --content
|   /Users/seb/Documents/code/Web2/visualizer/dist
|   --port
|   8080

Subject: [Paraview] pvBatch vs. pvPython question
Message-ID: <9E30654B-0189-4EE4-8EA2-540A506D4402@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,

I am just starting to play with pvbatch, and I am seeing some behavior I do not understand.

When using pvpython, my images are rendering as expected:

[cid:image001.png at 01D1FC80.C1779C70]


However,  when I run the exact same script through pvbatch, I get an image that is not at all as I expected.

[cid:image002.png at 01D1FC80.C1779C70]

Is there some idiosyncrasy with pvbatch that makes the renderings different?  I am attaching my script as well as the output files.

Any help would be welcome!  I am using Paraview 5.1.2 downloaded from the paraview.org website.

Thanks,
Josh

Can you share your Python script? Also, I would suggest using the
gridwriter.py script to see what Catalyst is getting as your data set
input. It may be different than what your normal simulation output is.

Joshua,

Odd, there should be no difference. Can you share the dataset too (feel
free to do it offline)? I can dig in further to see what's going on.

Venke,

That definitely looks like a bug, and I was able to replicate the behavior. Thanks for reporting it. I added the issue to the bug tracker (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/16853).

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Opacity mapping and image texture in ParaView 5.1.2

Hello

I have an issue regarding the "enable opacity mapping for surfaces" (in the Color Map Editor) if the ParaView session contains another object that has an image loaded as texture. The problem occurs in ParaView 5.1.2 but not in earlier versions (tested with 5.0.1. and 4.3.1). I am working on Windows 64bit.

If I want to enable the opacity mapping for surfaces everything works as expected as long as I have no texture image. The behaviour is very strange: if I load a texture image in another object, this seems to be set to the background with the transparent volume cutting a window to see this image. I will include snapshots because I think that my explanation may not be very clear. With no opacity mapping enabled I can see the volume and the plane with the image as expected.

Should I do anything differently in the new ParaView to achieve a transparent volume along with the image texture object or is this "just" a bug? Thank you very much and best regards
Venke

Thanks for the reply.
We can share our python scripts but are not allowed to share the whole 
simulation code.

We are trying to reproduce the error with the fortran example without 
success:
Currently fortran example compute complex data, so we are not exactly in 
the same situation.

We also checked and seems that there are differences in the amount of 
overlapping that is happening:
In Fortran example the different extents of imageData overlaps for just 
one value,
In our code the overlap is greater, would it be a problem?

We will further try to reproduce the problem in a simpler example

Best regards

Luigi

Subject: [Paraview] 5.1.2/OpenGL2 issue
Message-ID: <D3E2149C.2D014%Richard.C.Angelini.CIV@mail.mil>

We are trying to build/run ParaView 5.1.2 on a particular HPC system with
graphics nodes via TurboVNC.     ParaView 5.0.1 build/runs fine in this
configuration.    ParaView 5.1.2 compiles fine (using identical build
configuration used to build 5.0.1) - however the GUI fails at execution.
I?m not sure how to debug it any further.     It *appears* that 5.1.2 is
maybe doing some additional environment querying that might be causing this
failure?


When I try to run 5.1.2, I get this error:

g01 > paraview

The particular message about indirect rendering ? if I run glxinfo,   direct
rendering is set to YES.

I tried to run the launcher as described in the docs. But I am still 
getting errors when running http://localhost/apps/Visualizer/

Firefox console:

-------------------------------

1. when setting sessionManagerURL in html set to 
vtkWeb.properties.sessionManagerURL:

2. when setting sessionManagerURL in html to http://localhost:8080/paraview:

Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at ws://localhost/ws. 
autobahn.min.js:114:0
null Visualizer:42:13
No launcher found.  Attempting to connect using the direct WS url.

So the launcher can't start the pv webserver? But running 
http://localhost:8080/paraview/1 in browser works but says: {"error": 
"No session with id: 1"}

Subject: [Paraview] Building with OSMesa using CMake does not have the the
	correct variables.
Message-ID: <DUB408-EAS1560A61D9E95D2F920F63ACF5EA0@phx.gbl>

I am using the latest PV source as of this date downloaded from the github
repo. I am also using CMake 3.5.2 to build for Visual Studio 2015 on Windows
10.

 

After configuring once I followed the instructions provided here
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#OSMesa_support>
and tried to search for the CMake variable OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR. However, it
does not show up. I only see the QT version of it: QT_QT OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR.
I set the option to build qt gui to off and I set VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA to
true. 

 

Then I tried to look for the libraries libGL and libGLU, but none of those
is to be found inside the OSMesa build directory so I assumed that you are
talking about the standard library files so I left the OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY and
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY variables alone. I set the osmesa library and include
library to osmesa.lib and to <OSMesa SOURCE DIR>/include and NOT the build
directory. The reason why I am doing this is because I was unable to install
using scons. It configures and builds just fine. What am I doing wrong?

 

These are the osmesa variables:

These are the OPENGL variables:

Rick,

I am assuming with is with VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND set to OpenGL2.

Do you know what VirtualGL version is being used?

Yes - this is an OpenGL2 build.

Is this the information on TurboVNC that you?re looking for?

server glx vendor string: VirtualGL
server glx version string: 1.4

No, that's not it. Hopefully someone with more knowledge on this than
me can chime in at some point. I'm told that VirtualGL < 2.3.1 did not
forward the glXCreateContextARB calls we need for creating OpenGL 3.2
context needed by ParaView (OpenGL2 backend).

To update my know how about it in the mean time, I read up a bit on
TightVNC and VGL [1,2]. So, is your setup intended to use VirtualGL?
If so, shouldn't you be running `vglrun paraview`? I believe that's
the [VGL] warning messages are all about, aren't they?

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst example compile error when adding XML output
Message-ID: <979BE14F-081B-4B7D-91B9-1A1FA36F15AC@snumerics.com>

Hi all,

 

I?m playing with the catalyst example ?CxxFullExample?. I can get it to compile and run just fine as it comes packaged with ParaView. I added the following to the ?FEAdaptor.cxx? file:

#include <vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter.h>

 

*in the CoProcess function I added,

 

vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter* writer ;

????? writer->SetFileName("UnstructuredGrid.vtu");

????? writer->SetInputData(VTKGrid);

????? writer->Write();

 

 

When I try to compile like I did before I see the following:

 

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/neal/software/ParaView5.2/build /home/neal/software/Catalyst_examples/CxxFullExample_source/

.

.

~software/Catalyst_examples/CxxFullExample_build> make

Am I missing an additional header that needs to be included beyond the XML writer one?

Thank you,

Hi Daniel,

Which version of Apache are you running?

Did you enabled all the modules?

$ sudo a2enmod vhost_alias
$ sudo a2enmod proxy
$ sudo a2enmod proxy_http
$ sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
$ sudo a2enmod rewrite


For the launcher configuration, do you have a proper "resources" and "apps"
 section?

I'm guessing you are looking at the following documentation pages?

- https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/apache_front_end.html
- https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/python_launcher.html

Once you have the forwarding of the launcher request working, the next part
will be the forwarding of the ws. But we can talk about it when and if you
run into issue about it.

Dave,

Is it possible to do a debug build and see which call is failing?

Chris,

Try changing CMakeLists.txt, changing the `find_package(ParaView .. )`
and `target_link_libraries(..)` as follows:

    find_package(ParaView 4.1 REQUIRED COMPONENTS vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkIOXML)
and
     target_link_libraries(CFullExampleAdaptor vtkPVPythonCatalyst vtkIOXML)

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst issue with pvti output.
Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F684368636D@MBX111.d.ethz.ch>

Hello Catalyst developers

I have my first parallel simulation interfaced with Catalyst live. I use PV 5.1.2

While the live display has all the pieces, with the correct sub-extents, and the renderview shows the full grid without any missing piece, I find that the Parallel Image Data Writer does not correctly write the WholeExtent, using the 0-th piece's extents, instead of the global extent. Correcting the output by hand, enables me to later view the full grid. So, all pieces are correct, I only have a problem with the WholExtent. For example, running on 4 MPI tasks, I get

<VTKFile type="PImageData" version="1.0" byte_order="LittleEndian" header_type="UInt64">
  <PImageData WholeExtent="0 11 0 11 0 0" GhostLevel="0" Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 1">
    <PPointData>
      <PDataArray type="Float64" Name="temperature"/>
    </PPointData>
    <Piece Extent="0 11 0 11 0 0" Source="filename_624_0.vti"/>
    <Piece Extent="0 11 10 21 0 0" Source="filename_624_1.vti"/>
    <Piece Extent="10 21 0 11 0 0" Source="filename_624_2.vti"/>
    <Piece Extent="10 21 10 21 0 0" Source="filename_624_3.vti"/>
  </PImageData>
</VTKFile>


whereas the correct line should be
  <PImageData WholeExtent="0 21 0 21 0 0" GhostLevel="0" Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 1">

is this a know issue?

likewise, eventhough the live paraview renderview shows the full image, when I run my simulation and save screnshots, I only the image output of Task 0.

Is this known? or is it a problem with my own code? I am puzzled by the fact that when connecting live to the simulation, all pieces are at the right places, so I do see a full resolution mesh. Why should the PNG and *pvti files be missing pieces?

Thanks for any tips.

Yes! That is exactly what I was missing. It compiles without any issues now.

Thank you Utkarsh.

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst issue with pvti output.
In-Reply-To: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F684368636D@MBX111.d.ethz.ch>

Hi Jean,

I'm guessing you missed the vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent()
method in your adaptor. Catalyst runs like "pvbatch -sym", i.e. each
process runs the script and we avoid MPI reduce operations to process 0.
This results in process 0 (the process that writes out the meta xml file)
not knowing the whole extent. By using
vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent() it should fix that.

If that's not the case, please let me know and we'll try and figure why
things aren't working properly. Also, please let me know if this fixes the
image output issue. I haven't seen that before and would like to make sure
it's not a bug elsewhere that's causing this.

By the way, with Live does the data set extent show the correct values in
the gui? I don't think I've checked on that and would like to verify that
is correct.

Best,
Andy

#29 0x000000000040853b in main ()

in particular it is failing on

glBlendFuncSeparate where it is being called below

in ParaView-v5.1.2-source\VTK\Rendering\OpenGL2\vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx

void vtkOpenGLRenderWindow::OpenGLInitState()
{
  glDepthFunc( GL_LEQUAL );
  glEnable( GL_DEPTH_TEST );

  // initialize blending for transparency
  glBlendFuncSeparate(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA,
                      GL_ONE,GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
  glEnable(GL_BLEND);

it seems that glBlendFuncSeparate is a function that is being defined as NULL for some reason.

This is occurring in 5.1.0 and 5.1.2 but it is defined properly and works correctly in 5.0.1 for some reason.

Thanks,

Joe

Dave,

Is it possible to do a debug build and see which call is failing?

Does anyone have a link to an example or documentation describing how one can interpret a *.vtu file that is XML ascii? I?m looking at a file that was written for a 2x2x1 group of cells i.e. 4 hexahedral cells, and the connectivity looks like:

 

<Cells>

??????? <DataArray type="Int64" Name="connectivity" format="ascii" RangeMin="0" RangeMax="17">

????????? 0 6 8 2 1 7

????????? 9 3 2 8 10 4

????????? 3 9 11 5 6 12

????????? 14 8 7 13 15 9

????????? 8 14 16 10 9 15

????????? 17 11

??????? </DataArray>

??????? <DataArray type="Int64" Name="offsets" format="ascii" RangeMin="8" RangeMax="32">

????????? 8 16 24 32

??????? </DataArray>

??????? <DataArray type="UInt8" Name="types" format="ascii" RangeMin="12" RangeMax="12">

????????? 12 12 12 12

??????? </DataArray>

????? </Cells>


I can?t seem to understand the connectivity info that is displayed. I would image there should be 8 entries per line for a hexahedral cell.


Any material on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Hi Chris,

I don?t think the line breaks represent discrete cells. If you count them, there are 32 values for the connectivity (4 cells x 8 points).

- apache 2.4.12
- modules are enabled
- launcher.py launches without error, resrouces and apps section are in 
the config file as described in the documentation
are all ports and hostnames right in my configuration files? apache is 
localhost and paraview also

Actually the hostname might be an issue if you have several network card.
Can you try to use the computer IP? Or '0.0.0.0' for the launcher if that
work?

Otherwise I did not spotted any issue in your config.

Hi Chris,

a unstructured grid (without polyhedral cells) is described by three arrays:
1) connectivity: An array storing the point ids of the unique points of
                  all cells.
2) offsets: An array indicating the end position of each cell in the
             connectivity array.
3) types: An array storing the types of each cell.

Regarding your example, from the "types" and "offsets" arrays you can
deduct that you have 4 cells of type "12", i.e. hexahedrons (see [1]).
Now, the offsets array tells you that the first 8 numbers in the
connectivity array are the point ids for the first cell, second number
tells you that the point ids from 9 to 16 are for the second cell and so on.
The line breaks in the connectivity array have no meaning.

HTH,
Armin

Thank you T.J.? 

I think I see now how the information is organized via those ?offsets?. Do you know if there is a function call that can tell it to write the actual connectivity out in full?? If it?s really obscure or would be difficult to find out, then don?t worry about it.

Hi Chris,

 

I don?t think the line breaks represent discrete cells. If you count them, there are 32 values for the connectivity (4 cells x 8 points).

I can?t seem to understand the connectivity info that is displayed. I would image there should be 8 entries per line for a hexahedral cell.


Any material on this would be greatly appreciated.

So, what you are seeing in the .vtu file is the full connectivity. If you would like the cell information in a different format, It may be best to use a vtkCellIterator and run over the vtkUnstructuredData with it. The use of vtkCellIterator is well documented in vtkCellIterator.h, though for some reason the Doxygen version of it appears incomplete.

Thanks T.J.

I was just curious if the output format supported different ways of expressing the connectivity, kind of like there are flags for binary and ascii. I didn?t know if the xml *.vtu supported a classic vtk numbering. From what Armin said it looks like the offset format is the accepted and only form of the *.vtu file.

Hi Chris,

 

I?m not sure I understand. As Armin mentioned:

 

a unstructured grid (without polyhedral cells) is described by three arrays:
1) connectivity: An array storing the point ids of the unique points of
                all cells.
2) offsets: An array indicating the end position of each cell in the

The use of vtkCellIterator is well documented in vtkCellIterator.h, though for some reason the Doxygen version of it appears incomplete.

        <DataArray type="Int64" Name="connectivity" format="ascii" RangeMin="0" RangeMax="17">

          0 6 8 2 1 7

          9 3 2 8 10 4

          3 9 11 5 6 12

          14 8 7 13 15 9

          8 14 16 10 9 15

          17 11

        </DataArray>

        <DataArray type="Int64" Name="offsets" format="ascii" RangeMin="8" RangeMax="32">

          8 16 24 32

        </DataArray>

        <DataArray type="UInt8" Name="types" format="ascii" RangeMin="12" RangeMax="12">

          12 12 12 12

        </DataArray>

      </Cells>


I can?t seem to understand the connectivity info that is displayed. I would image there should be 8 entries per line for a hexahedral cell.


Any material on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Chris Neal

Subject: [Paraview] General Catalyst questions
Message-ID: <9F877232-5513-4773-A95B-C1AA11187D37@snumerics.com>

Hi Catalyst developers,


Our team has recently succeeded in integrating Catalyst into our code (which would not have been possible without all of your help). Now that the details of getting our data into the VTK format via the adaptor are settled, we are running into new questions about how to effectively utilize Catalyst within our code.

One question that I have about Catalyst is: Say my code supports 100 optional variables, and I don?t really want to load every single one of those variables into memory if the user is just asking for contours of pressure and velocity. Is there a way to know what variables are in play within the Catalyst Python scripts that were passed to the code? In other words, is there a way to query what variables will be requested by a set of Catalyst scripts before we take our first timestep so that we can set up some rules for loading only the requested variables into the VTK format?

I also noticed that the Catalyst export state option in ParaView 5.1 appears to be somewhat limited in that it requires me to export either 1.) A live image, 2.) An animation, or 3.) A static screenshot of the current display.? What if I created a pipeline that has a final result of a histogram? Is exporting that histogram data not supported currently in the Catalyst export state option? What about just saving the data to *vtu format without exporting any images? I could put a script together to do this, but I?m thinking about what a user would do if they weren?t well versed in the ParaView python scripting language.


Thank you,
Chris Neal

Look at the discussion at
http://markmail.org/search/?q=paraview+luigi+calori#query:paraview%20luigi%20calori+page:1+mid:i5dxviq6va7simyi+state:results
for the current state of the art for not exporting all variables from the
adaptor.

Catalyst can output data extracts. It's in the Writers menu once you load
the Catalyst Script Generator plugin.

Subject: [Paraview] 3D Widgets
Message-ID: <BLU180-W51D7D63D4FC60909D145AEADEA0@phx.gbl>

Hi,
I am trying to add 3D widgets to my custom filters. I am trying to find some documentation. For eg, let's say I want to add a BoxWidget that will just surround my input data. How do I achieve this?  I am having trouble understanding the process of linking the widget to the filter inside the XML.   
I looked here 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Properties_Panel and ParaViewCore\ServerManager\SMApplication\Resources\3d_widgets.xml 
In 3d_widgets.XML, I see all the possible widgets available to ParaView. What the XML syntax to access them.  
I was looking at the clip filter which is using the Box and a plane ( for the plane clip) and saw that this part of XML is "triggering the process of rendering the BOX with the plane"
<ProxyProperty command="SetClipFunction"                     label="Clip Type"                     name="ClipFunction">        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">          <Group name="implicit_functions" />        </ProxyGroupDomain>        <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">          <Proxy group="implicit_functions"                 name="Plane" />          <Proxy group="implicit_functions"                 name="Box" />          <Proxy group="implicit_functions"                 name="Sphere" />          <Proxy group="implicit_functions"                 name="Cylinder" />          <Proxy group="implicit_functions"                 name="Scalar" />        </ProxyListDomain>  
How do I customize this code, to add a different kind of 3D widgets ?

I had wrong paths in my launcher.config properties.
Now the request gets through and the vtk window opens. But I have still 
the ws error. Firefox console:

Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at ws://localhost/ws. 
autobahn.min.js:114:0
null Visualizer:42:13
Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead. 
jquery-1.8.3.min.js:2:0
No launcher found.  Attempting to connect using the direct WS url. 
vtkweb-all.js:4456:19

--- vtk window opens, then:

I changed sessionManagerURL in my html file to 
vtkWeb.properties.sessionManagerURL instead of 
http://localhost:8080/paraview. Now I get in firefox:

Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead. 
jquery-1.8.3.min.js:2:0
GET
http://localhost/proxy [HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request 16ms]
null Visualizer:42:13
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 
ws://localhost/proxy?sessionId=7d12745c-6a34-11e6-a5dc-0016d4e2bc28. 
autobahn.min.js:114:0
GET
http://localhost/proxy [HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request 2ms]
null

...I think one more thing is needed.

Yes it seems the ws forwarding is not working.

if you cat that file you should see some content with that id and a
host/port that apache should use to connect to the server that is running
paraview.

Otherwise the documentation (link that I previously gave) explain how to
use unix group and setup the appropriate rights to that file so apache can
read while the launcher can write.

Subject: [Paraview] associating table data with a Paraview source?
Message-ID: <787E7423-6F3F-4639-83C1-6A0A00854069@email.arizona.edu>

Hi folks, An ignorant question.  I know Paraview is great for visualizing existing complex data sets, but I have a simple problem wherein I need to create a dataset, and I would like to solve this problem using Paraview, but I am unsure how to do so.

In brief, I have been given point data of radiance values of 3 sensors placed in specific locations around a mesh.  I have no 3D object provided that represents the sensors, no 3d volume; just a spreadsheet of values of sensor readings over time.  For illustrative purposes, it is desired to visualize the sensors as radiant spheres, and animate how the 3 sensor values change over time, by showing the sensor spheres varying in color.

It seems the way to go about this, is create source spheres in Paraview, at the proper locations around the mesh object.  This part is easy!  What is not clear to me, is if there is a way ? and if so, what is it ? to associate my data tables of changing sensor values with the Paraview sphere sources.  Once I import the csv spreadsheet, how can I associate it with an object already in Paraview?   Can someone kindly point me in the right direction, or tell me this cannot be done.  Thank you!

Cynthia

Thank you Andy.

 

We have a unique situation where we would need to know ahead of time what variables are in play with the python scripts. This is due to the way that the simulation code operates (it throws out rules that accumulate all of the attributes that would not be needed before the first iteration is taken). If we can?t tell it which to toss before it starts, then all the variables would be kept.

With that in mind, I read the discussion. I do see the section that you are referring to in the python script. For example in the CxxFullExample case the script feslicescript.py has;


def RequestDataDescription(datadescription):

??? "Callback to populate the request for current timestep"

??? global coprocessor

??? if datadescription.GetForceOutput() == True:

??????? # We are just going to request all fields and meshes from the simulation

??????? # code/adaptor.

??????? for i in range(datadescription.GetNumberOfInputDescriptions()):

??????????? datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).AllFieldsOn()

??????????? datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).GenerateMeshOn()

??????? return

 

??? # setup requests for all inputs based on the requirements of the

??? # pipeline.

??? coprocessor.LoadRequestedData(datadescription)



>From my understanding if I just have a single grid, then datadescription.GetNumberOfInputDescriptions() should return 1.? So if this example required only ?pressure? and ?velocity?, how would I change this function to tell say that the fields that are required are ?pressure? and ?velocity??



Thank you,

Chris Neal

Look at the discussion at http://markmail.org/search/?q=paraview+luigi+calori#query:paraview%20luigi%20calori+page:1+mid:i5dxviq6va7simyi+state:results for the current state of the art for not exporting all variables from the adaptor.

Catalyst can output data extracts. It's in the Writers menu once you load the Catalyst Script Generator plugin.

Hi Catalyst developers,


Our team has recently succeeded in integrating Catalyst into our code (which would not have been possible without all of your help). Now that the details of getting our data into the VTK format via the adaptor are settled, we are running into new questions about how to effectively utilize Catalyst within our code.

One question that I have about Catalyst is: Say my code supports 100 optional variables, and I don?t really want to load every single one of those variables into memory if the user is just asking for contours of pressure and velocity. Is there a way to know what variables are in play within the Catalyst Python scripts that were passed to the code? In other words, is there a way to query what variables will be requested by a set of Catalyst scripts before we take our first timestep so that we can set up some rules for loading only the requested variables into the VTK format?

I also noticed that the Catalyst export state option in ParaView 5.1 appears to be somewhat limited in that it requires me to export either 1.) A live image, 2.) An animation, or 3.) A static screenshot of the current display.  What if I created a pipeline that has a final result of a histogram? Is exporting that histogram data not supported currently in the Catalyst export state option? What about just saving the data to *vtu format without exporting any images? I could put a script together to do this, but I?m thinking about what a user would do if they weren?t well versed in the ParaView python scripting language.


Thank you,
Chris Neal

Looking at your system log you may have some hints on what is going wrong.
(Still leaning toward file system security issue)

The sessionId could still be sent back but if the launcher can not write
that file, then apache could not figure out its mapping.

What linux version are you running it on?

I still have the failed to fetch problem (below).  Is Ubuntu 12.04 (Linux
3.2.0-105-generic) too old?  You said there is an older version of

Hello Andy

The tip about using vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent() was perfect. It fixes the *pvti WholeExtents

The image output issue was instead caused by overlapping graphics windows. I have been testing on my workstation where a separate OpenGL window is opened for each MPI task. Making sure these windows don't overlap fixes the problem.

While running Live, the dataset extents shown are those of Task 0. If I do an Extract, then the Whole Extents are shown. So I do not have an issue with that.

Thanks for the help
Jean

Subject: [Paraview] associating table data with a Paraview source?

hey Cynthia,

if your data is in, or can be converted to, CSV format just open it up, 
and apply the table to points filter, followed by glyph filter. table to 
points you'll need to specify the coordinate arrays and check keep all 
arrays option. in the glyph filter properties you can select a sphere 
glyph and select glyph all points option. this will put a sphere at each 
point and you can scale and color them by any of the arrays.

Subject: [Paraview] Status of BoxLib AMR reader
Message-ID: <CY1PR0701MB2058DA767925F078D7697F619DED0@CY1PR0701MB2058.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,


Our code is moving away from traditional structured grids towards an AMR capability using BoxLib. That means, unfortunately, that all of the development we have done to make our code Paraview and CoProcessing friendly is not usable with the BoxLib file format.


I have seen some information on various websites about using the VisitBridge to add the readers from Visit into Paraview, but when I build with it, the BoxLib reader was not included in the list of formats I could use for files -- even though it is listed online.


Does anybody know what the status is of the reader in PV and if it is usable? Or is there a different format we can try to write out from our code that would be usable? I really don't want to lose the work we've done with PV and I would rather spend time writing code to get things working again for PV than learn to use new software!


Thanks,


Tim

I think this is what you want is similar to "SPHVolumeInterpolator".

I have still a question. How can I pass arguments to that launcher from 
the client? E.g. I want to pass a file or a directory.

Tim,

I am not exactly sure what's the status of the reader, but I can
certainly look it up. Do you have a sample dataset also to test that
it's working (or not)?

You should be able to add any key/pair in your config object that you
submit for connecting to the server.

Then in the launcher config you can use those provided key as argument of
your command line like follow:

var conf = { app: 'visualizer', fileToLoad: './dataset.vtk' }

Launcher

cmd: [
  ..., "--file-to-load", "${fileToLoad}"
]

Hi Utkarsh,


I just checked with the latest head of the git repo and when I compile with the VisitBridge, there are no readers for BoxLib built.


This page lists it as supported: http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/index.php/VisIt_avt_Integration


But then this later one doesn't include it: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge


I have a dataset for you, I will send it off-list.


Thanks,


Tim

Tim,

I am not exactly sure what's the status of the reader, but I can
certainly look it up. Do you have a sample dataset also to test that
it's working (or not)?

I built with Qt 5.7 (build from source) on Ubuntu. That's my primary
development config.

So I tried following these two walk throughs;

https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

but had issues with it not finding the right qt config files.

Did you install Qt5.7 in a similar process to the one described on qt5
install page? I think the newest version I saw in apt was 5.5.

Maybe I need to purge 5.5 from my system....


Thank you as always Utkarsh!

Qt5_DIR:PATH=/home/utkarsh/Software/qt/5.7.0/install/lib/cmake/Qt5

If you're using ParaView 5.*, you may need to specify most (if not
all). With ParaView "master", only setting the Qt5_DIR does the trick.

Subject: [Paraview] Is USE_EXTERNAL_VTK supported with ParaView 5.1.2?
Message-ID: <CAOyh2eYofefe-EF4ifiDimXW_37s1gQAn3M6a08+OkgRm_KtaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to first build and install VTK-7.0.0 and then compile ParaView
5.1.2, which should use the installed VTK-7.0.0 instead of building its own
VTK version. For this purpose I configure ParaView with the
-DUSE_EXTERNAL_VTK=ON option, but I get a bunch of errors.

Before I attach lengthy error logs, I'd like to ask whether this can work
at all? It is not clear from older bug reports, whether USE_EXTERNAL_VTK is
finally supported or whether it is in some buggy, experimental stage since
3 years. If it is supported, are the 5.1.2 and 7.0.0 versions compatible,
or should I try a different combination?

If somebody can confirm that this should work in principle, I'll try to
solve as many compilation problems as possible before I send the remaining
error output for further discussion.

The background of my request is that I need to develop a ParaView plugin
which links a software tool that depends on VTK by itself. I couldn't find
a possibility to link this tool against the VTK which is included in
ParaView. Therefore I am trying to first build VTK, and then link both
ParaView and the software tool with the compiled VTK. I hope this makes
sense.

Thank you
Corinna

Subject: [Paraview] Need help with reload macro
Message-ID: <a6c46236-95e2-b0f8-1678-cbff9c9a1248@gmail.com>

Hello there,

I'm relatively new to Paraview, and I'd love to have an easy way of 
reloading the data and updating the display.  From the list archives, I 
understand there is no ready-made solution for this at the moment.

So I got the idea to use the sequence "Reset session" -> "Load State" 
from the menu, which works like a charm but is a hassle nonetheless.

Next, I tried using this python code as a macro:

   from paraview.simple import *
   from tempfile import *

   t = NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".pvsm", delete=False)
   f = t.name

   SaveState(f)

   s = GetSources()
   for key,val in s.items():
       Delete(val)

   LoadState(f)

This works, sort of, but deleting the sources isn't quite the same as 
resetting the session, for which I haven't been able to find a python 
equivalent.  What it does, however, is to create a new layout each time 
I run the macro, and display a warning "This code may not work in 
multi-clients mode" as well.  It also appears to tie up a lot of memory 
after a few uses, which isn't really that funny.

I also tried adding equivalent lines to delete the views and the 
layouts, but behaviour was the same whatever I did.

So, what do I need to do differently?  What's the closest I could get in 
python to the menu item "Reset session"?

Thanks!

I took a stab at adding the Boxlib reader from the visit source to the VisitBridge internal readers. I managed to get everything to compile and link, Paraview built fine, but I can't seem to figure out how to make Paraview aware the reader exists.


There isn't an option for Boxlib in the dropdown for the file type when I try to open a file, and it doesn't appear as an available reader when I try to select the file -- although all the others from the VisitBridge appear. I missed a configuration file somewhere to make the file loading aware of the reader.


Any suggestions on what I missed? I added a section in the Utilities/VisItBridge/databases/visit_readers.xml file, but that wasn't enough I guess.


Thanks,


Tim

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst causing crash during WriteImages stage
Message-ID: <B1748434-12C2-4B37-B944-FF220FAA2228@snumerics.com>

Hi,

 

I?m running a version of Catalyst that was compiled with ParaView 5.1. I generated a catalyst script using ParaView 5.1 that just performs a clip of the domain and then outputs a .png of the view. I?m seeing an error about a floating point exception. I?ve had success with scripts that strictly just save data to the *vtu format. This is my first script that tries to save a screenshot of the simulation domain.

I went through and put print statements around my code, and the error is in the CoProcess function:

if(Processor->RequestDataDescription(dataDescription.GetPointer())!=0){

????????? dataDescription->GetInputDescriptionByName("input")->SetGrid(VTKGrid) ; 

??????????Processor->CoProcess(dataDescription.GetPointer()) ;

??????? }

 

I took the above from the CxxFullExample Catalyst example.

I only have 1 script, so I peppered print statements around it and saw that the code was crashing in the DoCoProcessing function, specifically during the call to coprocessor.WriteImages(datadescription,rescale_lookuptable=False).

Has anyone had an issue like this before when using Catalyst?

Thank you,

Chris Neal

No, it's not supported and there are no indications that it will any
time soon unless someone from the community takes it up.

You should be able to set your VTK_DIR to ParaViewBuildDir/VTK.

Thank you, I will try if that works. Now that you mention it, I think I
remember that I have been successful in a similar situation quite some time
ago by using the build directory.
However, the problem with this is that I would have to always copy around
the complete build directory between production servers. At the moment I
only install the installation directory on those servers. (The much smaller
installation directory helps to reduce the startup time significantly.) In
the installation directory, "VTKTargets.cmake" is missing, so that other
projects cannot use this as VTK_DIR.
Would it be easy for you to make the ParaView installation directory usable
as VTK_DIR by adding the required cmake files? Or is there a more difficult
problem underneath? The missing VTKTargets.cmake has been discussed several
times in the past with no real solution.

Thank you
Corinna

I looked into it.
Seems that I have to get rid of the vtkweb-loader.js and load the js, 
tpl and css myself.

Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E050F9DE3E6@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I have a (hopefully) simple question: In the contour filter (on a 2D slice of a 3D dataset), I want to visualize contours corresponding to the values I give in the "Isosurfaces" table. But I get also contours corresponding apparently to min and max values of the corresponding data set. How can I suppress those?

Thanks,

Matthias

We can certainly support that use-case. I've reported an issue:

Tim,

Did you also add it to visit_readers.xml [1]? The proxy definition should
also have a  <hints> section like so [2].

Matthias,

You should not get contours for min/max values unless you asked for
them. Note, original input is not hidden when you apply the Contour
filter. Is that what you're seeing?

Hi, just to let you know that I add try something very similar that is building my app (using Feelpp library) using Paraview/VTK instead of plain VTK. 
To do so we made something like this:

ENDIF ()

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView COMPONENTS vtkPVCatalyst NO_MODULE

ENDIF()

# use an external communicator 
set(VTK_HAS_PARALLEL 0) 
if( VTK_MAJOR_VERSION EQUAL 6 OR VTK_MAJOR_VERSION GREATER 6 )

message(STATUS "Found ParaView ${PARAVIEW_VERSION_FULL}/VTK ${VTK_MAJOR_VERSION}.${VTK_MINOR_VERSION}") 
endif() 

# If ParaView was not found we try to find VTK 
if(NOT ParaView_FOUND) 
message(STATUS "ParaView could not be found or is not compatible with Feel++. Looking for VTK...") 
FIND_PACKAGE(VTK QUIET) 
if( VTK_FOUND ) 

.... 

It compiles without any problem. 

On Debian/Testing this won't work with packaged paraview. The package need to be reworked in order to use it for providing vtk. 

It consists mainly in adding some "missing files" into the paraview-dev package. 

I'm trying to fix this 

However I run into a problem regarding paraview and vtk python bindings. 

In a "standard" installation of paraview we end-up with the following directories: 

../site-packages/paraview/vtk 

../site-packages/vtk 

These 2 directories contains the same python files except for the __init__.py files. 

The last directory (vtk) also contains some shared libs. 

Would it be possible to somehow to have only on vtk directory into site-packages? 

This would avoid a clash between python-paraview package and python-vtk6 package.. 

or to use python-vtk6 package to provide ../site-packages/vtk as it's done right now 

(Besides paraview 5.1.2 actually provides vtk7 which is not packaged so far...) 

Any idea or comments to work around this problem 

Best.

Hi Utkarsh,

thanks for replying so quickly. I have realized that in fact I see numerical fluctuations in my simulated data (nonzero electrical field in a normally field free region), so ParaView is not to blame... ;)
My mesh being a bit coarse in some regions of the geometry, the contours have unphysical edges. Is there a chance to get smoother contours?

Thanks again,

Matthias

And another question:

When I apply the contour filtert to a slice and display both, the slide hides aprt oft he contour line. Is there anything I can do to avoid that?

Thank you,

Tim,

It doesn't know what the class is. Multiple things could have gone wrong:
1. is there call to ADD_VISIT_READER() for the new reader?
2. does the case match between the XML's class="" and the name specified in
1?

If it makes it easier, create a MR on the
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/visitbridge repo with your changes, and
I can do the necessary fixes.

Thanks for the quick response, the case didn't match between the two files and that was the issue. I'm able to use the reader to select the file and it sees the names of the variables in it properly, but when I hit Apply it throws:


ERROR: In /data4/PVBoxLibTest/paraview/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkAMRInformation.cxx, line 573
vtkAMRInformation (0x44210f0): Invalid grid description for a vtkUniformGrid


I have a feeling this might get beyond my paraview knowledge to fix.


One potential source of the problem -- what version of Visit are the other readers pulled from? I have the Boxlib files from the latest version, but looking at some of the other readers, they are from older versions.

The latest date I see in the copyright for existing readers is 2013 and looking through the Visit Release notes, the last release in 2013 says it was upgraded to use VTK-6.0.


Is it possible the bridge is based on Visit before that major VTK upgrade and I need to pull the reader code from a version earlier than that?


Thanks for your help. If I can't find something I know how to fix soon, I can create a merge request and see if anybody else can get it the rest of the way.

Tim,

It doesn't know what the class is. Multiple things could have gone wrong:
1. is there call to ADD_VISIT_READER() for the new reader?
2. does the case match between the XML's class="" and the name specified in 1?

If it makes it easier, create a MR on the https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/visitbridge repo with your changes, and I can do the necessary fixes.

Hi Utkarsh,


I just checked with the latest head of the git repo and when I compile with the VisitBridge, there are no readers for BoxLib built.


This page lists it as supported: http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/index.php/VisIt_avt_Integration


But then this later one doesn't include it: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge


I have a dataset for you, I will send it off-list.

I have to throw in the towel on this one for now and get back to some other deadlines... but, I put what I have so far online and created a merge request with information about the error and an example dataset attached.


Hopefully somebody better with VTK than I am can take a look and figure out what I'm missing. I tried comparing the files for Chombo against the original Visit source files to see if any special modifications were required and none are (the only changes are HDF5 related). It looks like the Chombo reader is from Visit 2.7.0 -- the Boxlib files I added are from 2.10.3, but I tried it with the Boxlib reader from Visit 2.7.0 also and it's the same issue.


If anybody has a chance to take a look, I'd appreciate it. Hopefully it's something simple. If not, I'll try to pick it back up in a few days. I apologize for the hacked CMakeLists to link against the library, I will fix it to do it properly once everything else works!

I took a stab at adding the Boxlib reader from the visit source to the VisitBridge internal readers. I managed to get everything to compile and link, Paraview built fine, but I can't seem to figure out how to make Paraview aware the reader exists.


There isn't an option for Boxlib in the dropdown for the file type when I try to open a file, and it doesn't appear as an available reader when I try to select the file -- although all the others from the VisitBridge appear. I missed a configuration file somewhere to make the file loading aware of the reader.


Any suggestions on what I missed? I added a section in the Utilities/VisItBridge/databases/visit_readers.xml file, but that wasn't enough I guess.


Thanks,


Tim

Hi Utkarsh,


I just checked with the latest head of the git repo and when I compile with the VisitBridge, there are no readers for BoxLib built.


This page lists it as supported: http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/index.php/VisIt_avt_Integration


But then this later one doesn't include it: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge


I have a dataset for you, I will send it off-list.


Thanks,


Tim

Tim,

I am not exactly sure what's the status of the reader, but I can
certainly look it up. Do you have a sample dataset also to test that
it's working (or not)?

You'll save many people's frustration by including VTKTargets.cmake in the
"make install" target, thank you.
I found a workaround is to copy VTKTargets.cmake from ParaView's build
directory to the same place as the installed VTKConfig.cmake, and to
replace all occurrences of the build directory by their installation
counterparts.

Thank you
Corinna

Message-ID: <CACDyxREGqktAMVEm5OpeWOba_1aGVoCE-8NMcUSxpntFG1cL=Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have built a ParaView on a parallel machine with:

 1) intel/16.0.3    2) openmpi/1.6.5   3) cmake/3.5.2

And "Classic OSMesa? Mesa-9.2.5 configured with instructions at:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D#Installing_Classic_OSMesa


My problem is a handshake issue and client server connection time I suspect
the hand shake strings are the problem as the server sting is:

ParaView handshake strings are different on the two connecting processes
(Current value: paraview.5.1.renderingbackend.opengl).


And the client string is:

StartFragmentParaView handshake strings are different on the two connecting
processes (Current value: paraview.5.1.renderingbackend.opengl2).


Is it true that I can?t use the classic rendering (old GL) on the backend
with a GL 2 on the client? Is there a workaround or do I have to figure out
how to build a more modern OS Mesa (which might just be a copy/paste from
the aforementioned website?)?


Thanks,

?John.

not yet, but an IFrame is enough for me now. I think I have just to add 
the files added by the loader.

Hello Everyone

I am looking for some help in order to run the catalyst examples found in:
https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode-MOVED-


I've downloaded and compile paraview with Examples flag set to on in ccmake during configuration. But I can't find any binaries in the build directory for the examples in the page above. Is there another flag specifically for catalyst examples? And where will the corresponding binaries by placed in the build directory?

If you could point me to some reference I'll be very glad. Thanks in advance

Miguel,

Can you try:

bounds = myObject.GetDataInformation().GetBounds()

where bounds is an array containing [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax]

Hi,

The examples have been moved into the ParaView source tree at
<source>/Examples/Catalyst. This makes it easier to test the examples and
keep them in sync with the PV source. You can still compile them separately
and individually if you want to.

On my Linux machine, when I build ParaView master (a bit beyond 5.1.2) the
example executables get put in the bin subdirectory of the build directory.
They may not get installed to the install bin directory though if that's
where you're looking for them. If you're looking for them in the build
directory, what gets returned when you search for CxxFullExample? That's
where all of the Catalyst examples should get put.

Best,
Andy

You might also be able to use the url for the iframe to inform the
configuration to use some aditional key/pair.

like http://host/pvw?fileToLoad=disk.vtk

That should work too.

Message-ID: <BLU180-W37780BAA6A94EE9DF8D141ADE00@phx.gbl>

I have a state file which contains multiple filters, some have multiple inputs port. When I load the state file everything load correctly but every filter that uses multiple ports (input) get this error "Input port (1,2,3,4,...) of algorithm "random name" has 0 connection but is not optional. 
If the filter instead uses multiple connections to one port then it gets loaded correctly. 

Can multiple port connection be saved in the state files?

Message-ID: <63B92F57-ED86-4B7E-AB51-08FDDAC37F82@email.arizona.edu>

Hi folks.  Another ignorant question.   (and Thank You to Burlen Loring for his assistance with my last question)
I have created an animation of a time series of some months of several temperature sensors.  It is desired by the end user of this visualization, to show the diurnal cycle as the animation goes by, by changing the background color from blue to through to black as the days so by.  I can use the time values in the data table that contains my sensor data as a variable to determine a color by, but I don?t know what/or if there is, a filter to use to do this readily; that is, as a control of the background color.   If anyone can give me some direction, I?d appreciate it much.

Thank you,
Cynthia

Hi once again,

what's a good way to learn paraview web? I am still struggling a a bit 
with it's architecture. Protocol.py is the entry point? When I want for 
example to change the default background color for all renderers where 
do I have to look? Is this set once or for each renderer?

Another thing I would like to change is that I can open a file from 
client inside a running pv web session so that I can load pv web upfront 
and load files without this long wait time.

best regards
Daniel

All the guides we have written are located here:
http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/

Not sure what you mean by "entry point".  However, that file has many of
the rpc methods that are available to be called from the web client.  You
can also learn a lot by reading through the methods in there to see how we
use Python to control/manage ParaView.

I am not sure whether or not this is something you can set for all
renderers, but you can use the properties panel in the "Visualizer"
application to set the background color.  This a property you will find
under the "View" section.

Not exactly sure what you're asking here, but you can have the client load
a file as soon as the connection is established, as Sebastien mentioned in
a previous thread.

Hope this helps,
Scott

Sadly, I feel there should be A LOT more documentation regarding
ParaviewWeb.

What I found useful to learn how to interact with the Paraview server using
python is the Tracer feature of paraview. It can show what python commands
the interface triggers. I've found that there are some commands that are
not displayed, though. (changing the texture of a source, for instance.
I've yet to discover how to do that via python)

	pvsm file
Message-ID: <CAN4UQ49SAsxoK-pLxYQLAGUa0niPC24QNjLiETJTQB5Lj2C4Ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi community!

In Paraview 4.4.0, 5.1.0, and 5.1.2, I'm having a weird error (I don't know
if other versions are affected as well)... After launching the ParaViewWeb
visualizer script:

./bin/pvpython
./lib/paraview-5.1/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py
--content ./share/paraview-5.1/www --data-dir /PATH_TO_THE_FILES/ --port
8080

Connecting with it (http://localhost:8080/apps/Visualizer/), loading a pvsm
file, and reloading the web page (to close the connection and the
ParaViewWeb visualizer instance), I'm receiving a segmentation fault:

(...)

*Segmentation fault (core dumped)*

However, it is not happening if I manually load the data and reproduce all
the process (In such case it is just logging "Main loop terminated" and
conveniently closing the app)

The half good news are that, in Paraview >= 5.1.0 at least it is ever
terminating (with the segfault), while in Paraview 4.4 it may become hanged
(instead of crashing).

Someone else with the same problem? Any idea to fix that?

Thanks!
Pepe

Dear Christopher,

Yes, the filters 'Cell Data To Point Data' and 'Point Data To Cell Data'
just interpolates from the cell centres to the cell vertices or the other
way round. It doesn?t affect how the data is initially imported.

Thank you for your reply and for pointing out the solution involving the VTK
format. For now, I've chosen to use XDMF, since it is simpler and it is
enough for what I need.

Best regards,

Thomas

Dear Jean,

Thank you for your reply. The solution you suggested involving XDMF has
worked. I just needed to change NumberType, Precision and Endian attributes
to match to my data.

Best regards,
Thomas

We would like to automate the opening of catalyst connection inside

We tried to use tracing but the catalyst opening and port setting was 
not recorded.
Any hint would be appreciated

I don't know if this functionality is supported through the Python API. If
not I don't think it would be too much effort to add it in.

Utkarsh,

The resolution I am using is 1036X824. I have attached an example of both
scenarios. The vertical split in the view port can been seen in the 'Save
Animation' file, but is correctly hidden in the 'Save Screenshot' file.

Cheers,
Clayton

Hi David,

First of all, thank you for sharing this option. It will allow me to
continue with my work partially.

The default option is "Follow Frontface" and that is causing the undesired
effect.

The option "Cull Frontface" has the same undesired effect, whereas the
option "Cull Backface" fixes it.

This fix is however not working when I load two grid files and superimpose
them. In this second attachment I enabled the option "Cull Backface" in
both grids, but you can see that for some reason the box is transparent and
I can see the various pillars defined in the other grid inside of the box.
I tried the same visualization in another computer and this problem doesn't
occur. So I am almost sure it is something related to my laptop, GPU or
Paraview build.


?
Please let me know how can I help solve this issue and if you need any
other information from me.

-J?lio

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with export pdf
Message-ID: <BLU181-W620B62E4054F7AAE0729F5CF1B0@phx.gbl>

Dear all,
I have had problems to export a scene in pdf in Paravis 5.0 of the Salome-7.8.0.The scenario is: when I load a file with some results in a timestep I am able to see all my results normally.
              
https://mega.nz/#!Z1EgCJbC!-UFNy_yDMRUpYTj6ihr9rtE3Xtv5KgancOoqctFGhTE
Then I position my study in a timestep and export the results in pdf format using that configuration:
              
https://mega.nz/#!NgUkFDIB!V0SCj4PqCtryE0nv_E0bSD74K5jqZS_dudV5hxlI2Ow
The result is a picture with only the geometry without any colors.
         
    https://mega.nz/#!wlMRWC6S!RJQrAbLHcflmdNS4eVtxLK7CdVKe7oF_4cQVvsYjjN8 

The resulting pdf is attached.https://mega.nz/#!5g1lwThI!HFXiK-vFRr_eMtSUWdgkwfKfdRdp_sNYBJlR2bMZ8NMI don't know what is happening, but I really wish to extract my results in vector format.Can anyone help with this?I thank you in advance.

Hi,

I'm trying to save one screenshot with a very high resolution.

I try to run in several different machines and configurations but I had
always the same problem.

Some black rectangular strips appears in the figure.

I'm sending an exemple, one figure and the python code that generate this
figure...

Someone had some ideia why I have this problem?
