Subject: [Paraview] problem using 'stream tracer with custom source'

Look at the values for "ReasonForTermination" that are added to the
streamlines.  Here are what the numbers mean:

1: OUT_OF_DOMAIN
2: NOT_INITIALIZED
3: UNEXPECTED_VALUE
4: OUT_OF_LENGTH
5: OUT_OF_STEPS
6: STAGNATION

Paul

We're getting ready for a pre-release of PV 4.0 now so we'll need this
soon. If we need to update to a newer WindBlade file for the test, we can
do that too. You'll have to think though on how to handle backwards
compatibility.

Hi Hang,

I had the same issue, try using the Tetrahedralize filter before the
extracts.

Hi,
Using a reader I would prefer not to edit, x,y,z velocities at vertices are
read as 3 scalars.
How can I group them or create another variable that is the vector
representation of these three?
I would like to create glyphs of the velocity field at the vertices.

I would appreciate any help.
Thanks,

Hi Nick,

You can use the Calculator to create a vector field from your three
scalar fields.

Say your three scalar fields are named X_VELOCITY, Y_VELOCITY, and
Z_VELOCITY. Then in the main text field just above the various
functions/operators, you should enter

(iHat*X_VELOCITY) + (jHat*Y_VELOCITY) + (kHat*Z_VELOCITY)

You can name the output field in the "Result Array Name" text field.

Best,
Cory

Message-ID: <1353583930.2180023.1351801331281.JavaMail.root@mail.gatech.edu>

Hi,

I'm trying to build the code I just pulled on master:

> git branch
* master

> git describe
v3.14.1-2499-g16f07c1

I set VTK_USE_X to OFF:

> grep "USE_X" CMakeCache.txt
VTK_USE_X:BOOL=OFF

but it fails while building with:

Linking CXX shared library ../../../lib/libvtkGUISupportQt-pv3.14.so
CMakeFiles/vtkGUISupportQt.dir/QVTKWidget.cxx.o: In function `QVTKWidget::x11_setup_window()':

make[1]: *** [VTK/GUISupport/Qt/CMakeFiles/vtkGUISupportQt.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

Am I missing something? Why is VTK looking for X if I said not to use it? Does not using X imply QT shouldn't be turned on? If so, should that be enforced in CMake?

Thanks,

Tim

Hi,
Thank you for your reply. This works perfectly.
For those it may help, I had to create a glyph filter of the vector to
visualize the result.
Simply toggling the display options from surface to 3D glyphs does not work
for me.

Cheers,
Nick

Hi Seb,

I think there is  an  issue with the  way Prototyp library construct JSON Vs how PraviewWeb uses it??.
As for some reason when I call  JSON.stringify() in the paraview.js::executeRemote() method, it returns  json object with double quotes around it.
It is a valid JSON structure but paraviewInstance.jsonRpcClient.VisualizationsManager does not support it.

I tried using browser's native toJSON mathod and it worked.
for that in paraview.js  i added :
if(window.Prototype) {
    delete Array.prototype.toJSON;
}

before code : 
var reply_string =
        paraviewInstance.jsonRpcClient.VisualizationsManager.invoke(
            paraviewInstance.sessionId,
            JSON.stringify(JsonRpcObjectBuilder(methodName, methodArguments)));


in function executeRemote( paraviewInstance, methodName, methodArguments ) {..............

and it worked. got clue from here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/710586/json-stringify-bizarreness


Ideally          \"params\":\"[]\"     should work as it is Valid JSON.
where can i find code for  VisualizationsManager.invoke() method so that i can see how is it using input parameters ?

Thanks
Sumit Purohit

Hi Sumit,

the bug seems to be related to the content of that method

/*
 * Helper method used to simplify the construction of JsonRPC objects
 */
function JsonRpcObjectBuilder( methodName, methodArguments ) {
    var args = [];
    if(typeof(methodArguments) != "undefined") {
        if(typeof(methodArguments) != "object") {
            args = [ methodArguments ];
        } else {
            args = methodArguments;
        }
    }
    return {
        id      : 1,
        method  : methodName,
        params  : args
    };
}

inside the file WebServer/PWService/web/js/dev/paraview.js which you
can point to in your testing process instead of its parent compressed
one ParaViewWeb.js. Although, don't forget to add /dev/json2.js and
/dev/jsonrpc.js too when you are using the development version of the
js.

Once you figured out, what need to be done to prevent those extra "
around [] then you can either send me the full paraview.js or just the
diff so I can patch and update the ParaViewWeb repository.

Thanks for your help,

Seb

Hi Sumit,

That's great that you figured that out.That part is handle by jabsorb on
ParaViewWeb server side but you might not be able to do anything about the
way it handle "[]" compare to [].
The jabsorb library automatically try to map some Java class/method to the
given json rpc request that it get.
So it might be easier to just fix the request on the client side the way
you did.

Seb

Yes, you'll need X if QT is enabled. You'll have to turn
off PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI as well. Note, additionally, you'll need to use
OSMesa. Refer to instructions here:

Okay, thanks. I was following the directions at: 

http://paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing 

which do not mention anything about turning off QT-related things.

Yes, you'll need X if QT is enabled. You'll have to turn off PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI as well. Note, additionally, you'll need to use OSMesa. Refer to instructions here: http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

Hi,

Am I missing something? Why is VTK looking for X if I said not to use it? Does not using X imply QT shouldn't be turned on? If so, should that be enforced in CMake? 

Thanks,

I assume you are using the same parameters?  In particular,  did you set
the Maximum Streamline Length to be large enough?  The default is too
small.

I need to sum all the values in a vector of a scalar property.  I've
struggled understanding the documentation for the python calculator and
programmable filter, mainly in how to access the point data that I want to
use.  Any tips will be appreciated.

Hi,

in a programmable Filter do something like this:

  import math
  input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
  output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
  COUNT=input.GetNumberOfPoints()
  pd=input.GetPointData()
  m=0
  v=0
  for i in xrange(COUNT):
   r=pd.GetArray('radius').GetValue(i)
   v=v+((4.0/3.0)*math.pi*r*r*r)
   m=m+pd.GetArray('Mass').GetValue(i)
  outputarray = vtk.vtkStringArray()
  outputarray.SetName("Text")
  outputarray.SetNumberOfTuples(1)
  outputarray.SetValue(0,"N=%d\nV=%1.6f m?\nm=%1.6f kg" % (COUNT,v,m))
  output.GetRowData().AddArray(outputarray)

Attention: if you save this to a state-file change the ? to 3 because it 
will not be escaped and you can not load the state anymore.

best wishes,
Christian

Subject: [Paraview] how to select data for Plot Variables over Time?
Message-ID: <SNT138-W4785DC6DDCB5CF9D7D432D1660@phx.gbl>



Hello,

I'm trying to calculate volumes that I'm generating, how they change over time. To get the volume, I do Polydata -> Gaussian Resampling -> IsoVolume -> Integrate Variables, Cell Data, and the results are pretty good. I want to get this data for every timestep, e.g. in a table that I can export and analyze externally. I tried applying Plot Global Variables Over Time when Integrate Variables is selected, but the resulting dataset has 0 for vtkValidPointMask at every timestep. I tried selecting Integrate Variables in these ways:

- Integrate Variables filter in the pipeline browser
- In Spreadsheet View, going to Integrate Variables -> Cell Data and clicking on the row with the volume info (which is the only row)
- In 3D view, visualizing integrate variables (it's a point) and doing Select Points On or Select Points through, per this post: http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg05757.html (where it apparently worked)

Any advice?

At this point the changes will have to wait, unfortunately. For the past
two weeks I've been involved with a TopoInVis submission so I couldn't get
around to it.  I'll look at it this weekend.  No need to wait for me.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem building from source
In-Reply-To: <CADHSJjBkE0pzZZFY7RcNMb2oL61VtKCPv9gjb_efnf=29YTaMQ@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <1510757905.106663.1351988127882.JavaMail.root@mail.gatech.edu>

Still more problems building... 

I have python wrapping turned on, and it built fine. But I tried to run a programmable filter that uses vtk.vtkExtractGrid() and it says it doesn't exist in the module. 

So I looked through the CMakeCache.txt and Module_vtkFiltersGeneral and Module_vtkFiltersExtraction were both set to INTERNAL and OFF. I couldn't figure out how to make them appear, so on a whim I changed them both to ON and reconfigured and regenerated. This made them appear in the ccmake screen. Then I built and no errors. 

However, vtkExtractGrid() is still not inside the python module vtk. But, in the install tree I have: 

> grep vtkExtractGrid * -R 
Binary file lib/paraview-3.14/vtkFiltersExtractionPython.so matches 
Binary file lib/paraview-3.14/libvtkFiltersParallelImaging-pv3.14.so.1 matches

So I don't know why I don't have access to it from pvpython. 

Any ideas what went wrong?

Yes, you'll need X if QT is enabled. You'll have to turn off PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI as well. Note, additionally, you'll need to use OSMesa. Refer to instructions here: http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

Hi,

I set VTK_USE_X to OFF:

Am I missing something? Why is VTK looking for X if I said not to use it? Does not using X imply QT shouldn't be turned on? If so, should that be enforced in CMake? 

Thanks,

For what it's worth, I can load the filters I needed by doing: 

import vtkFiltersExtractionPython 

which appears to be missing from lib/paraview-3.14/site-packages/paraview/vtk/__init__.py for some reason... I'm not ruling out that I screwed up the build somehow since the Module_vtkFiltersExtraction was OFF and INTERNAL until I changed it.

Still more problems building... 

I have python wrapping turned on, and it built fine. But I tried to run a programmable filter that uses vtk.vtkExtractGrid() and it says it doesn't exist in the module. 

So I looked through the CMakeCache.txt and Module_vtkFiltersGeneral and Module_vtkFiltersExtraction were both set to INTERNAL and OFF. I couldn't figure out how to make them appear, so on a whim I changed them both to ON and reconfigured and regenerated. This made them appear in the ccmake screen. Then I built and no errors. 

However, vtkExtractGrid() is still not inside the python module vtk. But, in the install tree I have: 

> grep vtkExtractGrid * -R 
Binary file lib/paraview-3.14/vtkFiltersExtractionPython.so matches

So I don't know why I don't have access to it from pvpython. 

Any ideas what went wrong?

Message-ID: <CAK1oH6E8kABP1OB=J9mofYddZM76hfmHmyWK=C=8D8n9cYqsqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,



I would like to use netCDF CAM reader in Paraview.

?netCDF CAM reader? needs two files. One is points+field data file and the
other is the connectivity file.

Unfortunately, I don?t know the netCDF data format for ?netCDF CAM
reader?and how to make the connectivity file.

I want to know the file format for netCDF file and connectivity file.

Thank you.



Best regards,

An example of the NetCDF CAM files are available with git at git://
vtk.org/VTKLargeData.git in
VTKLargeData/Data/NetCDF/{CAMReaderConnectivity.nc, CAMReaderPoints.nc}.
This is results from CAM simulations described at
http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/Atmosphere/development/. If you
haven't decided on a specific output file format though you may want to
look consider alternatives.

Subject: [Paraview] Data Partitioning in Paraview
Message-ID: <1352145932.61721.YahooMailNeo@web125901.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have a question about the way Paraview partitions data 
on multiple nodes. It seems to partition the data automatically without 
the user having any control.
I am currently working on a project at 
my university where we are trying to optimize processing time. We want 
to tell Paraview how to split up a large data set unto multiple nodes 
and then run Paraview in parallel (reverse client/server mode) telling 
it that it should use those specific nodes. The goal is to have the 
individual nodes perform their calculation and rendering? with the local
 data fragment that was previously stored there, thus avoiding 
additional delays caused by the nodes having to access the head node 
where the whole data is stored.
?
Is this possible? Is there a way to mandate which nodes to use and 
how Paraview should split up the data among the nodes? Also can Paraview
 tell the individual nodes to work with the locally stored data fragment
 instead of accessing the whole data set at the head node?

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Tom

Has anyone seen this bug, and have any idea how to get around it?  Also, where is the link line created forlibvtkftgl-pv3.14.so?

Thanks,

Hi Johannes,

Sure, this is a good suggestion and we wanted to do this but ran out of
time.

I am not so sure what you are saying here, because currently the grab style
just works on the scene and not on a particular object. Current we don't
perform intersection but you could extend the style to do so.

Seems like a bug. We recently updated the slice style. Hopefully soon we
will be pushing this branch to master.

I see. This particular style is not tested well and was intended for the
testing purposes.

It depends on the style. If a style needs an analog input, it will use it
if configured correctly. Currently we don't have any interactor style that
uses any analog input. if you do have such requirement, we could help you
write one.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Hi All,

By default, all the colour maps in ParaView are continuous between points.
I'd like to have only one colour in between points I set in the XML map, is
this possible?

Message-ID: <6CCDD8FC6578314C902BBF87D511D9D82DE38ED5@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Dear List

I hope it's some silly 'newbie' issue, but I find myself completely unable to read a raw binary data file using the raw binary data file reader. I have saved a data file as 'raw data' from ImageJ to try, and loaded that same file in ImageJ to verify that data is present. I have saved two versions: 8 bit [0-255] binary data and floating point 32-bit data in little-endian format.




Then in Paraview I try to open the file, then select
File prefix : this contains the correct file name it appears to me
C:\Documents and Settings\kny48981\My Documents\Experiments\snail\snail_partial_348x250x348_float32.raw
Data Scalar Type: Float (or Unsigned char for the other version)
Data Byte Order: LittleEndian 
File Dimensionality: 3 
Data Origin 0 0 0 
Data Spacing 1 1 1
Data Extent 0 348
            0 250 
            0 348 
Number of Scalar Components: 1
Scalar Array Name: ImageFile
File Lower Left (ticked) 

Then I select APPLY

I observe an Output Messages dialog box with the following messages in it. I do not understand these messages. I have not, so far as I know, specified any header 


ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkImageReader.cxx, line 184
vtkMPIImageReader (0959F008): File operation failed: 4293783092, ext: 0, 348, 0, 250, 0, 348

vtkMPIImageReader (0959F008): Header size: 4293783092, file ext: 0, 348, 0, 250, 0, 348


Then, I have apparently a dataset of the specified size, the bounding box displayed, but under 'information' 
Data Arrays
ImageFile float [0,0] 

Which  I understand as having no values other than zero???
What did I do wrong??

Thanks
Robert

It looks like the image you are reading has the size 348x250x348. A
definite gotcha in the RAW file reader is that the maximum extent in
x, for example, has to be one less than the size of the image in x.
The same is true for the y and z dimensions.

Hope that helps,
Cory

This is a bit off the question you asked, but you might consider making a
NRRD header file, which is a simple text file that provides the
information you normally have to enter by hand in the raw file reader
(http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/).  I like using NRRD headers so that I
don't have to continually enter this information (that I tend to forget)
every time I load the file, and that don't have that gotcha with the
dimensions/extent indexing that Cory describes.

As an example, a NRRD header file for your file could be called
snail_partial_348x250x348_float32.nhdr and contain the following:

NRRD0004
dimension: 3
sizes: 348 250 348
spacings: 1 1 1
endian: little
type: float (or `unsigned char' for the other version)
encoding: raw
data file: snail_partial_348x250x348_float32.raw

Robert,

I second Ken's suggestion of using the NRRD header. You might even be
able to export NRRD from ImageJ. I know you can export NRRD through
Fiji. I do this regularly.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells
Message-ID: <CAHJ1_RPLxskkD5gr5SroLByE-v_bOUQ5Ob9KHsv56YzaoxkD9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Hope you can help.  I have some code running in parallel, that by other
means I have constructed nprocs worth of vtkRectilinearGrids, one per
process.  Each of which is a valid nprocs-worth of the whole serial mesh,
I've check this and I am happy with that i.e. it's partitioned properly and
nothing is missing.  I need the following information to process my data in
parallel:

1) I would like the local -> global cell mapping between the local rgrid
and the corresponding global single mesh.
2) I would like to know which cells are on processor boundaries for
parallel exchange purposes.
3) I would like all the double arrays per processor to be "expanded" by the
amount of (1 level of) ghost cells such that I can properly do the
computations I want with the ability to exchange only those additional
cells given the local to global mapping.

I have tried from the examples to use the following code, which I call on
every process, each of which has it's own local rgrid as I said.  I do the
following:

 vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter> dd =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter>::New();
  dd->SetInput(rgrid);

 dd->SetController(getVtkController());
  dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToOneRegion();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToAllIntersectingRegions();
 dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
 dd->Update();
  vtkPieceScalars *ps = vtkPieceScalars::New();
 ps->SetInputConnection(dd->GetOutputPort());
 ps->SetScalarModeToCellData();
  vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter *dss = vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::New();
 dss->SetInputConnection(ps->GetOutputPort());

The dd object works fine and writing its contents out on each processor
gives nprocs worth of meshes, each of which look slightly different to the
way I've partitioned them up, but sum to the same serial mesh so I am happy
with that working correctly. But I can't for the life of me figure out how
to obtain local to global cell mappings, allocate ghost cells, or work out
how to exchange data given the above partition info and comms....

Note I have not provided any additional information to "dd" regarding
global cells as per the doxy notes so I assume it went away and computed
it.  I can't figure out how to extract it however.  I also have no idea how
to modify each local processor rgrid to include the ghost cells for that
processor.  Finally given that info, I could exchange between processors to
write to each local processors ghost cells the corresponding "real" cell
data from the neighbouring meshes and continue the code.

Any help really appreciated!

Cheers,
Andy

I have a generalized ArrowGlyph filter which allows for 
independently resizing the arrow shaft thickness, head 
size, etc. It fills this request (and also some of my own):

http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/450560-glyphs-scale-only-the-arrow-length-instead-of-the
(also http://bit.ly/SKAn30)

Can I email it to someone or upload it somewhere and have 
someone else add it to the project? I don't know how, and it's been 
weitten for two years; time for someone else to take it over. 
(It works for me, and apparently I don't have time to learn how to
submit it. Also, I don't have the knowledge to check the code for 
consistency with standard practices, whether/how to include it as
standard in Paraview, an externally-downloadable module, etc., etc.)

Background: I paid JB to write a module for me to generalize the 
Arrow Glyph. It is debugged and working.

Thanks, that NRRD is good to know about as a workaround, though I also used MHD in the past. 

But correctly interpreting the zero-indexed array dimension is a start, I can see some snail shell now

Ideally, the best case would be to have the HDF5 reader to read the HDF5 files that we propose to use to store data in the extremely near future. First I need to just understand what Paraview can really do for our data

Recasting my question: How do I display the current time in a
parametric plot where time is not the x-axis?


Long version:

Samuel, thanks for the reply, but your solution is not the one I am
looking for.  Your plot uses time as the x-axis, and velocity as the
y-axis.  You are plotting
  y(x) = velocity .

Your plot shows the current time by a vertical green line at time t=x.
(See attached image XY-plot-with-time-as-X.png.)

I would like to plot

  y(t) = stress
  x(t) = strain

and show the current time by a dot at (x(t),y(t)). (See attached image
XY-plot-with-current-time-marked.jpg.)

I suppose my dot should be green because it's the equivalent of the
vertical green line that Paraview automatically displays on plots with
timestep as the x-axis.

Does that make sense?

Steps to recreate my image:

- Load a mesh with at least two variables for each node.
- Select one or more nodes.
- Click PlotSelectionOverTime
- Select the new plot and filter.
+ Note that the current time is marked by a vertical green line.
- Under the Display tab, under "X Axis Data",
- click "Use Data Array".
- in the dropdown to the right, select your second variable.
+ Note that the current time is not marked.

Message-ID: <F4420EF66C9C2E459F82C436DABE2F0E3003ECD1@EXMB02.srn.sandia.gov>

I believe vtkDistributedDataFilter will always return with global point ids (a mapping from local point ids to global point ids), although it might pass them if they already exist.  So dd->GetOutput()->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds() should return the array that gives this mapping.

Ghost cells are only created on demand, and this is usually done by pipeline convention.  If you have a filter that needs a layer of ghost cells, it should override the RequestUpdateExtent method to increment the value of UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS from the output information to the input information.  This method would look something like this.

int vtkDistributedDataFilter::RequestUpdateExtent(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS());

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
              numPieces);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
              ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

The operation of the RequestData method should also strip off this layer of ghost cells.  It might be possible to request a layer of ghost cells by setting UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS at the bottom of the pipeline, but I'm not totally sure how to make that work.  It's probably easier (or at least cleaner) to do it from within a filter.

Many thanks for this.

So I need to rethink my design such that I extend from a filter so I can
obtain the ghost cells?  There is no way to obtain them just from dd?

I can't do dd->GetGhostCells(processorNumber)?
or rgrid->AddGhostCells(dd)?

I know I can't do these last two, but that's kind of the thing I was
after....

are there any other ways to do this?  Casting my current work in terms of a
filter is not going to be straight forward, although equally I'll have to
if this is the only way....so other ideas welcome.

Cheers again,
Andy

Another question which I'd forgotten, how do I get to a vtkUnstructuredGrid
per processor from the vtkDistributedDataFilter.

For instance, dd->GetOutput()->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds() doesn't work
as it's a vtkDataObject

Stupid question I'm sure but the doxy notes say this type returns an
unstructured mesh, but I can't seem to get it out?

Also, why exactly do I need the vtkPieceScalars and
vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter again?
If the above can be made to work and return the mapping, what are they
adding in terms of information?

Thanks again,
Andy

You might try something like dd->GetExecutive()->GetOutputInformation(0)->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(), 1) before calling Update (but maybe after calling UpdateInformation).  This might work, but I'm not sure if the value you set will be overridden by the executive later.  Even if it works, there will be plenty of gotchas.  For example, if you update the downstream components, this values is going to get overridden.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells

Many thanks for this.

So I need to rethink my design such that I extend from a filter so I can obtain the ghost cells?  There is no way to obtain them just from dd?

I can't do dd->GetGhostCells(processorNumber)?
or rgrid->AddGhostCells(dd)?

I know I can't do these last two, but that's kind of the thing I was after....

are there any other ways to do this?  Casting my current work in terms of a filter is not going to be straight forward, although equally I'll have to if this is the only way....so other ideas welcome.

Cheers again,
Andy

Ghost cells are only created on demand, and this is usually done by pipeline convention.  If you have a filter that needs a layer of ghost cells, it should override the RequestUpdateExtent method to increment the value of UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS from the output information to the input information.  This method would look something like this.

int vtkDistributedDataFilter::RequestUpdateExtent(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS());

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
              numPieces);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
              ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

The operation of the RequestData method should also strip off this layer of ghost cells.  It might be possible to request a layer of ghost cells by setting UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS at the bottom of the pipeline, but I'm not totally sure how to make that work.  It's probably easier (or at least cleaner) to do it from within a filter.

Hi,

Hope you can help.  I have some code running in parallel, that by other means I have constructed nprocs worth of vtkRectilinearGrids, one per process.  Each of which is a valid nprocs-worth of the whole serial mesh, I've check this and I am happy with that i.e. it's partitioned properly and nothing is missing.  I need the following information to process my data in parallel:

1) I would like the local -> global cell mapping between the local rgrid and the corresponding global single mesh.
2) I would like to know which cells are on processor boundaries for parallel exchange purposes.
3) I would like all the double arrays per processor to be "expanded" by the amount of (1 level of) ghost cells such that I can properly do the computations I want with the ability to exchange only those additional cells given the local to global mapping.

I have tried from the examples to use the following code, which I call on every process, each of which has it's own local rgrid as I said.  I do the following:

 vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter> dd = vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter>::New();
 dd->SetInput(rgrid);

 dd->SetController(getVtkController());
 dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToOneRegion();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToAllIntersectingRegions();
 dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
 dd->Update();
 vtkPieceScalars *ps = vtkPieceScalars::New();
 ps->SetInputConnection(dd->GetOutputPort());
 ps->SetScalarModeToCellData();
 vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter *dss = vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::New();
 dss->SetInputConnection(ps->GetOutputPort());

The dd object works fine and writing its contents out on each processor gives nprocs worth of meshes, each of which look slightly different to the way I've partitioned them up, but sum to the same serial mesh so I am happy with that working correctly. But I can't for the life of me figure out how to obtain local to global cell mappings, allocate ghost cells, or work out how to exchange data given the above partition info and comms....

You should be able to do a vtkUnstructuredGrid::SafeDownCast() to the data to get the unstructured mesh (and access to the point data).

Thanks on both accounts.  Any thoughts why the downcast called after
dd->Update() on distributedDataFilter is a null pointer?  As in, dd is
working perfectly properly, but I don't seem to be able to extract a valid
unstructuredgrid.  For a follow up question I assume
getPointData()->GetGlobalIds() gives the local to global for the mesh
nodes, and I should use getCellData()->GetGlobalIds() to get the local to
global for the cells?  Once I get a valid pointer that is....

Cheers again,
Andy

Message-ID: <50994039.2080404@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi,

I'm working with ParaView 3.98.0-RC1 and I will like to recover the 3.14 
properties and display  panel.
I think is confusing. The properties panel is unique for each filter but 
the display panel can be different, if 2 views are used.

Also normaly I put all the panel in one screen and the view in the other 
screen.
But now I have a very long properties panel that I can't split in two.

Thanks
Felipe.

Perhaps it is outputting a composite data set of some type?  Try running GetClassName() to see what type of data object it really is.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells

Another question which I'd forgotten, how do I get to a vtkUnstructuredGrid per processor from the vtkDistributedDataFilter.

For instance, dd->GetOutput()->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds() doesn't work as it's a vtkDataObject

Stupid question I'm sure but the doxy notes say this type returns an unstructured mesh, but I can't seem to get it out?

Also, why exactly do I need the vtkPieceScalars and vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter again? If the above can be made to work and return the mapping, what are they adding in terms of information?

Thanks again,
Andy

Ghost cells are only created on demand, and this is usually done by pipeline convention.  If you have a filter that needs a layer of ghost cells, it should override the RequestUpdateExtent method to increment the value of UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS from the output information to the input information.  This method would look something like this.

int vtkDistributedDataFilter::RequestUpdateExtent(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS());

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
              numPieces);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
              ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

The operation of the RequestData method should also strip off this layer of ghost cells.  It might be possible to request a layer of ghost cells by setting UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS at the bottom of the pipeline, but I'm not totally sure how to make that work.  It's probably easier (or at least cleaner) to do it from within a filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells

Hi,

Hope you can help.  I have some code running in parallel, that by other means I have constructed nprocs worth of vtkRectilinearGrids, one per process.  Each of which is a valid nprocs-worth of the whole serial mesh, I've check this and I am happy with that i.e. it's partitioned properly and nothing is missing.  I need the following information to process my data in parallel:

1) I would like the local -> global cell mapping between the local rgrid and the corresponding global single mesh.
2) I would like to know which cells are on processor boundaries for parallel exchange purposes.
3) I would like all the double arrays per processor to be "expanded" by the amount of (1 level of) ghost cells such that I can properly do the computations I want with the ability to exchange only those additional cells given the local to global mapping.

I have tried from the examples to use the following code, which I call on every process, each of which has it's own local rgrid as I said.  I do the following:

 vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter> dd = vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter>::New();
 dd->SetInput(rgrid);

 dd->SetController(getVtkController());
 dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToOneRegion();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToAllIntersectingRegions();
 dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
 dd->Update();
 vtkPieceScalars *ps = vtkPieceScalars::New();
 ps->SetInputConnection(dd->GetOutputPort());
 ps->SetScalarModeToCellData();
 vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter *dss = vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::New();
 dss->SetInputConnection(ps->GetOutputPort());

The dd object works fine and writing its contents out on each processor gives nprocs worth of meshes, each of which look slightly different to the way I've partitioned them up, but sum to the same serial mesh so I am happy with that working correctly. But I can't for the life of me figure out how to obtain local to global cell mappings, allocate ghost cells, or work out how to exchange data given the above partition info and comms....

Note I have not provided any additional information to "dd" regarding global cells as per the doxy notes so I assume it went away and computed it.  I can't figure out how to extract it however.  I also have no idea how to modify each local processor rgrid to include the ghost cells for that processor.  Finally given that info, I could exchange between processors to write to each local processors ghost cells the corresponding "real" cell data from the neighbouring meshes and continue the code.

Any help really appreciated!

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Joe,

> By default, all the colour maps in ParaView are continuous between points.  I'd like to have only one colour in between points I set in the XML map, is this possible?

In the current release of ParaView, you can click on the "Edit color map" button in the toolbar and turn on "Use Discrete Colors" in the color editor. By changing the number of colors with the neighboring slider, uniform ranges of scalar values will be assigned a single color.

In an upcoming release, discrete color maps will be available. Discrete colormaps do not interpolate colors; instead they are looked up in a table, so a single large difference in values will not force any small variations to be lumped into a single color band. However, this requires your scalar field to take on a small number of distinct values (32 or fewer); colors are assigned to a single value, not a range.

To map non-uniform ranges of values to a single color each, you really should create a derived, integer-valued variable and use it for coloring -- regardless of whether you use continuous colormaps in the current release or plan to use categorical color maps later. The calculator filter's floor, ceil, and round functions might be worth a try in creating the derived field; if there's not a simple expression to convert each range of interest to an integer, the Python calculator will let you apply a tabular function.

Finally, it *may* also be possible to achieve what you desire with a custom XML color map by placing control points with different colors very close to each other to create a discontinuous color map. This would be difficult to adjust in the color editor should the control points need to be repositioned, but might be the easiest thing to do if the bands are fixed values or fixed fractions of the total range.

	David

Hi,



I'm using paraview version 3.14.1 64-bit on Windows 7. I have an issue that
whenever I set "Use Multi-Core" to on and restart, I get four instances of

with paraview yet, and it doesn't seem to matter how long I wait it
continues to burn). I've tried on several machines all with the same
result.


Any ideas what could be the problem?


Thanks, Ross

So that's working now in terms of the cast, forgot GetOutput() inside the
cast operator!  The returned vtkUGrid is now fully populated and contains
sensible information.

However, both getPointData()->GetGlobalIds()  and
 getCellData()->GetGlobalIds() return null pointers.  Any thoughts?

Also, should I be using CellData since I want the cell global to local
mapping for cells not the nodes, at the moment at least?

Hi David,

Thanks for the reply.  I got the desired effect with the "Use Discrete

I'll look forward to the later release with the discrete maps.

Hmmm. I thought global point IDs were always created. Maybe it only happens when ghost cells are created. Try getting that working first.

As far as global cell IDs are concerned, you are out of luck. vtkDistributedDataFilter does not create them. But they are not all that useful anyway since, unlike points, once you remove the out cells there is no overlap. Usually you can get all the information you want from the ghost level.

If you really need global cell IDs, I'm sure you would have no trouble making them yourself. I would do it before running vtkDistributedDataFilter. Assuming when you first read in your data you have no duplicate cells, just label those on process 0 as 0..N_0, those on process 1 as N_0+1..N_1, and so on.

However, both getPointData()->GetGlobalIds()  and  getCellData()->GetGlobalIds() return null pointers.  Any thoughts?

Also, should I be using CellData since I want the cell global to local mapping for cells not the nodes, at the moment at least?

Thanks on both accounts.  Any thoughts why the downcast called after dd->Update() on distributedDataFilter is a null pointer?  As in, dd is working perfectly properly, but I don't seem to be able to extract a valid unstructuredgrid.  For a follow up question I assume getPointData()->GetGlobalIds() gives the local to global for the mesh nodes, and I should use getCellData()->GetGlobalIds() to get the local to global for the cells?  Once I get a valid pointer that is....

Cheers again,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells

Another question which I'd forgotten, how do I get to a vtkUnstructuredGrid per processor from the vtkDistributedDataFilter.

For instance, dd->GetOutput()->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds() doesn't work as it's a vtkDataObject

Stupid question I'm sure but the doxy notes say this type returns an unstructured mesh, but I can't seem to get it out?

Also, why exactly do I need the vtkPieceScalars and vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter again? If the above can be made to work and return the mapping, what are they adding in terms of information?

Thanks again,
Andy

I believe vtkDistributedDataFilter will always return with global point ids (a mapping from local point ids to global point ids), although it might pass them if they already exist.  So dd->GetOutput()->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds() should return the array that gives this mapping.

Ghost cells are only created on demand, and this is usually done by pipeline convention.  If you have a filter that needs a layer of ghost cells, it should override the RequestUpdateExtent method to increment the value of UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS from the output information to the input information.  This method would look something like this.

int vtkDistributedDataFilter::RequestUpdateExtent(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels =
    outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS());

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
              numPieces);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
              ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

The operation of the RequestData method should also strip off this layer of ghost cells.  It might be possible to request a layer of ghost cells by setting UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS at the bottom of the pipeline, but I'm not totally sure how to make that work.  It's probably easier (or at least cleaner) to do it from within a filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells

Hi,

Hope you can help.  I have some code running in parallel, that by other means I have constructed nprocs worth of vtkRectilinearGrids, one per process.  Each of which is a valid nprocs-worth of the whole serial mesh, I've check this and I am happy with that i.e. it's partitioned properly and nothing is missing.  I need the following information to process my data in parallel:

1) I would like the local -> global cell mapping between the local rgrid and the corresponding global single mesh.
2) I would like to know which cells are on processor boundaries for parallel exchange purposes.
3) I would like all the double arrays per processor to be "expanded" by the amount of (1 level of) ghost cells such that I can properly do the computations I want with the ability to exchange only those additional cells given the local to global mapping.

I have tried from the examples to use the following code, which I call on every process, each of which has it's own local rgrid as I said.  I do the following:

 vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter> dd = vtkSmartPointer<vtkDistributedDataFilter>::New();
 dd->SetInput(rgrid);

 dd->SetController(getVtkController());
 dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToOneRegion();
 //dd->SetBoundaryModeToAssignToAllIntersectingRegions();
 dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
 dd->Update();
 vtkPieceScalars *ps = vtkPieceScalars::New();
 ps->SetInputConnection(dd->GetOutputPort());
 ps->SetScalarModeToCellData();
 vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter *dss = vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::New();
 dss->SetInputConnection(ps->GetOutputPort());

The dd object works fine and writing its contents out on each processor gives nprocs worth of meshes, each of which look slightly different to the way I've partitioned them up, but sum to the same serial mesh so I am happy with that working correctly. But I can't for the life of me figure out how to obtain local to global cell mappings, allocate ghost cells, or work out how to exchange data given the above partition info and comms....

Note I have not provided any additional information to "dd" regarding global cells as per the doxy notes so I assume it went away and computed it.  I can't figure out how to extract it however.  I also have no idea how to modify each local processor rgrid to include the ghost cells for that processor.  Finally given that info, I could exchange between processors to write to each local processors ghost cells the corresponding "real" cell data from the neighbouring meshes and continue the code.

Any help really appreciated!

Cheers,
Andy

Hello,

Since the data is essentially structured (rectilinear grids), I think
the best way to get the global/local mapping is to use extent
information. Specifically, you need the whole extent of the grid and
the global extent of each partition. Then from the global IJK of a
point or cell, and the whole extent you can use methods from
vtkStructuredData to compute the corresponding global linear index for
a point or cell. Do you have extent information?

Also, I have done some work on ghost generation in VTK for structured
(and AMR) data. Unfortunately, currently it doesn't work outside the
box with rectilinear grids. This functionality can still be used to
create ghost layers and exchange the fields (node and/or cell data) on
the grid but, it doesn't communicate the coordindates on the
rectilinear grid. Alternatively, you may be able to converge to a
solution faster if you convert the rectilinear grid to a
vtkStructuredGrid and use vtkPStructuredGridConnectivity or
vtkPStructuredGridGhostDataGenerator to generate ghost layers. There
are tests that illustrate how to use these classes and I can provide
more information if you are interested.

Best,
George

Maybe I just used it wrongly. you mean that the grab style should be attached 
to a renderview property? What I did is to attach the Grab style to a source 
(e.g. Box0.Center). Therefore I assumed  that it would only affect that object.

I'll do that.

Ok. So I'll stick with the master branch...

Ah ok. Then I'll focus on the other styles for now, Manipulating a slice is 
more important for the moment, anyways.

Changing some analog value (like the opacity of an object) or rotating an 
object using a joystick would be great, but I'll come back to you if we really 
need it.

Many thanks for that.  I perform some threshold stuff early on, so
basically I'm working with unstructured grids pretty much from zero.  I
think I need to try to populate the ghost cells using the approach Ken
suggested, but I'm not sure how to do that both from a conceptual point of
view - I'd just be copying Ken's code, but also from the perspective of
fitting into my code design.

There does seem to be some confusion surrounding ghost cells and local to
global cell mappings both in terms of which class computes/owns them and
when and how.  Is that fair? I had assumed that given the massive amount of
work that D3 is doing, it would (must have) computed this info and have
been readily available via get methods, rather than going down the route of
extending the class just to define my own virtual methods....

These things are basic sets of info for parallel computing and I would have
assumed others would have wanted them but there is a lack of usage examples
and posts....not a complaint just surprised given that basically you can't
get going with vtk in parallel unless you use something like D3 for the
type of things I want to do.  i.e. local processing and some exchange over
halos....

It is odd that I also can't get cell local to global out of the box as Ken
said...

Going to have a go with Ken's method and see where I get to.  Are there any
good examples of creating and using ghost cells with unstructured meshes
that you could recommend??

Cheers again,
Andy

Perhaps an easy solution is to append a "GlobalCellID" and
"GlobalNodeID" before thresholding. To the best of my knowledge,
threshold will extract vtkUnstructuredGrid instance from whatever goes
in the input and not automatically retain this type of global
information.

Hope this helps.

Best,
George

Subject: [Paraview] [vtkusers] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells
	- PROGRESS
Message-ID: <CAHJ1_RO_sLMTa1FKUgyfA6kTvShX-=--H8HzKTJVgWXEie8E2A@mail.gmail.com>

So I've added this in an .cpp file and complied it:

vtkStandardNewMacro(MyD3)

MyD3::MyD3()
: vtkDistributedDataFilter()
{
}

void MyD3::PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent)
{
  this->Superclass::PrintSelf(os,indent);
}

int MyD3::RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
      vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
      vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece =
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces =
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels =
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS())
+ 1; //##### New bit, modified from Ken's notes

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(),
piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
numPieces);

inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

And I add this to a .h file:

class MyD3
  : public vtkDistributedDataFilter
{
  vtkTypeMacro(MyD3, vtkDistributedDataFilter);

public:
  static MyD3 *New();
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
  int RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector);
protected:
  MyD3();

private:
  // MyD3(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
  // void operator=(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
};

I then invoke it in parallel 3 way, as I did before, but now using:

  vtkSmartPointer<MyD3> dd = vtkSmartPointer<MyD3>::New();

  // here mesh is a vtkUnstructuredGrid on each processor, obtained from
other (non-vtk) means, but represents a valid and checked subset of the
entire mesh.
  dd->SetInput(mesh);
  dd->SetController(getVtkController());
  dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();  // clipping
  dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
  dd->Update();

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid>
ddUmesh(vtkUnstructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(dd->GetOutput()));

  auto ids = ddUmesh->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds();
  auto cids = ddUmesh->GetCellData()->GetGlobalIds();

########################
Notes:

1) Both ids, and cids remain null, although I now understand from Ken that
cids will always be null as they're not created.
2) Using totalview and stopping the code in parallel 3 way on line 670 of
vtkDistributedDataFilter.cxx, the member this->GhostLevel is always zero
and never executes codes branches dependent on it, however, the above code
successfully increments the ghostLevels to one.
3) So basically moved forward a little bit, but still not working.  Any
thoughts??
4) If I had created the ghost cells, how would I know, is my next question.
 How can I visualise them to check?

Any thoughts really welcome.

Cheers again,
Andy

If it helps, I've installed the latest Qt (4.8.3) before compiling and it
worked fine.

Subject: [Paraview] [vtkusers] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells
 - PROGRESS
In-Reply-To: <CAHJ1_RO_sLMTa1FKUgyfA6kTvShX-=--H8HzKTJVgWXEie8E2A@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <F4420EF66C9C2E459F82C436DABE2F0E30040DF3@EXMB02.srn.sandia.gov>

The instructions I gave were for a downstream filter separate from D3.  If you want to modify D3 itself (which sounds like a reasonable good idea for your purposes) then you will have change the value for UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS that the RequestData reads.  If you want to go with this approach, first blow away your RequestUpdateExtent method.  Let D3 do its regular thing.  Then implement a RequestData method like the following:

int MyD3::RequestData(
  vtkInformation *request,
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int requestedGhostLevel = outInfo->Get(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS());
  outInfo->Set(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
    requestedGhostLevel + 1);

  return this->Superclass::RequestData(request, inputVector, outputVector);
}

I don't know if the executive is going to get upset about you changing UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS in RequestData, but I think it will be all right.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [vtkusers] [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells - PROGRESS

So I've added this in an .cpp file and complied it:

vtkStandardNewMacro(MyD3)

MyD3::MyD3()
: vtkDistributedDataFilter()
{
}

void MyD3::PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent)
{
  this->Superclass::PrintSelf(os,indent);
}

int MyD3::RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
     vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
     vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS()) + 1; //##### New bit, modified from Ken's notes

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), numPieces);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(), ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

And I add this to a .h file:

class MyD3
  : public vtkDistributedDataFilter
{
  vtkTypeMacro(MyD3, vtkDistributedDataFilter);

public:
  static MyD3 *New();
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
  int RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
 vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
 vtkInformationVector *outputVector);
protected:
  MyD3();

private:
  // MyD3(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
  // void operator=(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
};

I then invoke it in parallel 3 way, as I did before, but now using:

  vtkSmartPointer<MyD3> dd = vtkSmartPointer<MyD3>::New();

  // here mesh is a vtkUnstructuredGrid on each processor, obtained from other (non-vtk) means, but represents a valid and checked subset of the entire mesh.
  dd->SetInput(mesh);
  dd->SetController(getVtkController());
  dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();  // clipping
  dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
  dd->Update();

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid> ddUmesh(vtkUnstructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(dd->GetOutput()));

  auto ids = ddUmesh->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds();
  auto cids = ddUmesh->GetCellData()->GetGlobalIds();

########################
Notes:

1) Both ids, and cids remain null, although I now understand from Ken that cids will always be null as they're not created.
2) Using totalview and stopping the code in parallel 3 way on line 670 of vtkDistributedDataFilter.cxx, the member this->GhostLevel is always zero and never executes codes branches dependent on it, however, the above code successfully increments the ghostLevels to one.
3) So basically moved forward a little bit, but still not working.  Any thoughts??
4) If I had created the ghost cells, how would I know, is my next question.  How can I visualise them to check?

Any thoughts really welcome.

Cheers again,
Andy

Perhaps an easy solution is to append a "GlobalCellID" and
"GlobalNodeID" before thresholding. To the best of my knowledge,
threshold will extract vtkUnstructuredGrid instance from whatever goes
in the input and not automatically retain this type of global
information.

Hope this helps.

Best,
George

Ok thanks again for the advice.  Think it's really clear I'm confused
between the "downstream" nomenclature.  Do mean just a class that
constructs or takes a D3 as input that I write from scratch outside of vtk?
Or do you mean something totally different?  Clearly my understanding of
"it was to inherit" was totally wrong.  I would prefer to stick with the
downstream filter if that's more robust.

Could you give me a quick explanation in this context?  In addition could
you point me towards an example of using a downstream filter in this
context?

Sorry again for the confusion,
Andy

Hi Joe,

I don't know of a way offhand, but you might try using Tools->Start Trace and Tools->Stop Trace to load a dataset and import a colormap to color it. That's how I discover Python equivalents for many things in ParaView.

By "downstream" I mean a separate filter that is connected to the output of vtkDistributedDataFilter or further down the output ancestry.  In your original example you had the chain of filters vtkDistributedDataFilter -> vtkPieceScalars -> vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter.  vtkPieceScalars and vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter are "downstream" from vtkDistributedDataFilter in this example.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [vtkusers] [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells - PROGRESS

Ok thanks again for the advice.  Think it's really clear I'm confused between the "downstream" nomenclature.  Do mean just a class that constructs or takes a D3 as input that I write from scratch outside of vtk? Or do you mean something totally different?  Clearly my understanding of "it was to inherit" was totally wrong.  I would prefer to stick with the downstream filter if that's more robust.

Could you give me a quick explanation in this context?  In addition could you point me towards an example of using a downstream filter in this context?

Sorry again for the confusion,
Andy

The instructions I gave were for a downstream filter separate from D3.  If you want to modify D3 itself (which sounds like a reasonable good idea for your purposes) then you will have change the value for UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS that the RequestData reads.  If you want to go with this approach, first blow away your RequestUpdateExtent method.  Let D3 do its regular thing.  Then implement a RequestData method like the following:

int MyD3::RequestData(
  vtkInformation *request,
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int requestedGhostLevel = outInfo->Get(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS());
  outInfo->Set(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
    requestedGhostLevel + 1);

  return this->Superclass::RequestData(request, inputVector, outputVector);
}

I don't know if the executive is going to get upset about you changing UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS in RequestData, but I think it will be all right.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [vtkusers] [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells - PROGRESS

So I've added this in an .cpp file and complied it:

vtkStandardNewMacro(MyD3)

MyD3::MyD3()
: vtkDistributedDataFilter()
{
}

void MyD3::PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent)
{
  this->Superclass::PrintSelf(os,indent);
}

int MyD3::RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
     vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
     vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS()) + 1; //##### New bit, modified from Ken's notes

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), numPieces);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(), ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

And I add this to a .h file:

class MyD3
  : public vtkDistributedDataFilter
{
  vtkTypeMacro(MyD3, vtkDistributedDataFilter);

public:
  static MyD3 *New();
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
  int RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
 vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
 vtkInformationVector *outputVector);
protected:
  MyD3();

private:
  // MyD3(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
  // void operator=(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
};

I then invoke it in parallel 3 way, as I did before, but now using:

  vtkSmartPointer<MyD3> dd = vtkSmartPointer<MyD3>::New();

  // here mesh is a vtkUnstructuredGrid on each processor, obtained from other (non-vtk) means, but represents a valid and checked subset of the entire mesh.
  dd->SetInput(mesh);
  dd->SetController(getVtkController());
  dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();  // clipping
  dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
  dd->Update();

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid> ddUmesh(vtkUnstructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(dd->GetOutput()));

  auto ids = ddUmesh->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds();
  auto cids = ddUmesh->GetCellData()->GetGlobalIds();

########################
Notes:

1) Both ids, and cids remain null, although I now understand from Ken that cids will always be null as they're not created.
2) Using totalview and stopping the code in parallel 3 way on line 670 of vtkDistributedDataFilter.cxx, the member this->GhostLevel is always zero and never executes codes branches dependent on it, however, the above code successfully increments the ghostLevels to one.
3) So basically moved forward a little bit, but still not working.  Any thoughts??
4) If I had created the ghost cells, how would I know, is my next question.  How can I visualise them to check?

Any thoughts really welcome.

Cheers again,
Andy

Perhaps an easy solution is to append a "GlobalCellID" and
"GlobalNodeID" before thresholding. To the best of my knowledge,
threshold will extract vtkUnstructuredGrid instance from whatever goes
in the input and not automatically retain this type of global
information.

Hope this helps.

Best,
George

Hi,

When I do line contours on 2 sided thin shell, I have observed a problem of display :

The line contour on one side of the shell overlaps when looking at the other face.

Is there any turn around ?

Thanks

Folks,

In preparation of the next ParaView release, the ParaView 3.98.0, RC1 is
now available for download (
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php).

We will have a detailed summary for the new features and enhancements in
this release soon. In the mean time, a complete list of features
implemented and bugs fixed in this release can be found on the bug tracker (
http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php).

A couple of caveats about the binaries currently uploaded at this time:
- We are awaiting 32-bit Linux binaries. They will be uploaded within the
next day or so.
- MacOSX binaries currently don't support Mountain Lion (10.8). We're
working on a fix and we will have updated binaries soon. The current
binaries work on Snow Leopard (10.6) and Lion (10.7).

Generally the best place to ask questions is the ParaView mailing list (paraview at paraview.org).

To quickly answer your question, the data partitioning is usually chosen by the reader.  The ParaView/VTK system simply asks the reader to load piece i of n, where i is generally set to the rank of the MPI process.

Things are different for structured grids (i.e. uniform, rectilinear, and curvilinear grids).  It's more complicated due to the way VTK handles these type of extents.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] ParaView Research Project

Hello,

My name is Thomas Fronk and I am a senior at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am currently working on a research project concerning ParaView for the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (ISN). I am unsure if I have the correct contact information with regards to ParaView advice/support and I apologize in advance for any inconveniences.

I have a question about the way ParaView partitions data on multiple nodes. It seems to partition the data automatically without the user having any control.

To give you some background, my research project is to determine whether it is possible to optimize processing time through pre-splitting up a large data set. We want to tell ParaView how to split up a large data set unto multiple nodes and then run ParaView in parallel (reverse client/server mode) telling it that it should use those specific nodes. The goal is to have the individual nodes perform their calculation and rendering  with the local data fragment that was previously stored there, thus avoiding additional delays caused by the nodes having to access the head node where the entire data is stored.

Is this possible? Is there a way to mandate which nodes to use and how ParaView should split up the data among the nodes? Also, can ParaView tell the individual nodes to work with the locally stored data fragment instead of accessing the whole data set at the head node?

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Thomas

For those that forgot to "play along at home" could you fill in the
gap between ParaView 3.14 and 3.98? Seems like a very large jump in
version numbers.

I am sure I just missed something on the list. Going to check the wiki....

Subject: [Paraview] CoProcessing needed fields
Message-ID: <1048243604.135323.1352318263296.JavaMail.root@mail.gatech.edu>

Hi,

I see in the example code for ParaView/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/PhastaAdaptor/PhastaAdaptor.cxx calls like:

  vtkCPInputDataDescription* idd =
    ParaViewCoProcessing::GetCoProcessorData()->GetInputDescriptionByName("input");

  ...

  if(idd->IsFieldNeeded("velocity"))
  {
  ...

The only way IsFieldNeeded returns true is if that name field was added with AddCellField or AddPointField. 

Where does that happen? My intuition says that the python or C++ processing script (generated by exporting state) would have those calls in it for the datasets that are actually used. In other words, if I set up my view in the GUI and I load my data and put a Slice through it and color by "Velocity", I expected the script from Export State to contain a call to AddCellField("Velocity"). At the very least I expected to see calls to add the fields I chose to load when I loaded my sample file to set up the view. 

So is that something that I need to put in the script on my own after it's exported or did I miss something? If I have to put it there myself, is RequestDataDescription the correct place to put that?

Thanks,

Tim

Think of it as 4.0.-1.

The structure is completely different from 3.14, so it isn't 3.16.

However, we don't want to call it 4.0, since we are waiting on one
feature, and because it needs thorough beta testing because so much
has changed.

2.9 was the same idea. That was the last tk based paraview that
existed just before 3.0 came out.

Hmm. Does this mean major code changes for my filters? This seems like
a conversation that I was tracking over the summer? Is there a wiki
page on the major changes?

For the vtk level changes yes:
http://vtkedge.org/Wiki/VTK/Module_Development
and
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/VTK_6_Migration/Overview

For the ParaView level changes, there is none yet.

The release notes for both VTK and ParaView will be useful, once they
are completed.

These are major releases therefore backwards compatibility can be
expected to be more of an issue than usual.

Hi Andy,

I've had a few problems with D3.  The limitation I find is that global node
ids are slow to generate and the point merging (I think) is only performed
in single precision.  Also, remember that everything will be redone each
time the number of ghost levels that are requested changes - this means the
global ids are recalculated, it is repartitioned and then the number of
ghost levels are added.  In some ways it might be better to have D3 split
into 3 filters for the different steps although it would make a long
pipeline.

Btw looking at the docs it seems to suggest that it only creates temporary
arrays for global ids within d3 (although I think in the past I have had
access to the global ids it created):

If you know the name of a global node ID array in the input dataset, set
that name with this method. If you leave it unset, D3 will search the input
data set for certain common names of global node ID arrays. If none is
found, and ghost cells have been requested,* D3 will create a temporary
global node ID array* before acquiring ghost cells. It is also desirable to
have global element IDs. However, if they don't exist D3 can create them
relatively quickly. Set the name of the global element ID array if you have
it. If it is not set, D3 will search for it using common names. If still
not found, D3 will create a temporary array of global element IDs.


My filters now add their own global ids so I don't use d3 for that.

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Undefined symbols when building an example reader plugin
Message-ID: <20121108.111936.171420535.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

With today's git-master, building ParaView/Examples/Plugins/Reader on
OS X 10.6.8, CMake 2.8.10, Qt 4.8.3 fails in the final linking stage
stating:

Undefined symbols:
  "vtkRenderingMatplotlib_AutoInit_Construct()", referenced from:
      __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in MyPNGReader_Plugin.o
      __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in moc_MyPNGReader_Plugin.o
  "vtkRenderingMatplotlib_AutoInit_Destruct()", referenced from:
      ___tcf_7 in MyPNGReader_Plugin.o
      ___tcf_5 in moc_MyPNGReader_Plugin.o
ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [libMyPNGReader.dylib] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/MyPNGReader.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

which is what I also have with my reader plugin. I know there is an
easy workaround of adding vtkRenderingMatplotlib as one of
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES but is this what I have to do?

Hi David,

All you get with that is the RGBPoints=[] (with populated RGB values), but
not showing the actual method to convert the XML file into RGB values.

Hi,

Many thanks.  Based on that can you confirm that I have been making a
mistake then?  I normally call update() on each filter in turn, basically
because I didn't know not to, I presume given what you've said plus the
call stack in totalview that I should only call Update() on the very last
filter in the ancestry/furtherest downstream??

Cheers,
Andy

Hi mate, how goes it?

How do you set the ghost level to be one rather than default zero then?
 Have you written your own "downstream" filter to update the number of
ghost levels?  If so any tips?

"If you know the name of a global node ID array in the input dataset, set
that name with this method"... Which method??  How do I set this?  I could
probably work out the global node and cell numbers and stick them into the
meshes that I pass to D3.  But how do I do that?  What method do I call to
set them, and what name do I give them.... "this method" ain't that helpful
in the docs ;-)

Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Still cannot add to selection with Crtl key
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E0509C0CF@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

in the new binary (3.98.0-RC1, Windows 32 bit), I still cannot add points to the current selection by holding the ctrl key (bug 0013056). Is there a workaround or fix in sight? I use this feature frequently, so I will have to stick with 3.12.0-RC2 until this is fixed (it doesn't work in 3.14 either).

Matthias

Yes. In fact that is the whole basic point of the pipeline is that you can call update just once at the bottom of the pipeline and it will pull all necessary data to get the result.

Calling update on every filter in the pipeline is at best unnecessary. VTK will remember what the last result of each filter execution is, so when you call update at the bottom it will simply reuse previous updates. However, if a filter does something like request ghost cells, then the results from your update on upstream filters becomes invalid and has to be re-executed. Therefore, it is not only convenient to call update once at the bottom, it is generally more efficient.

Hi,

Many thanks.  Based on that can you confirm that I have been making a mistake then?  I normally call update() on each filter in turn, basically because I didn't know not to, I presume given what you've said plus the call stack in totalview that I should only call Update() on the very last filter in the ancestry/furtherest downstream??

Cheers,
Andy

By "downstream" I mean a separate filter that is connected to the output of vtkDistributedDataFilter or further down the output ancestry.  In your original example you had the chain of filters vtkDistributedDataFilter -> vtkPieceScalars -> vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter.  vtkPieceScalars and vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter are "downstream" from vtkDistributedDataFilter in this example.

Ok thanks again for the advice.  Think it's really clear I'm confused between the "downstream" nomenclature.  Do mean just a class that constructs or takes a D3 as input that I write from scratch outside of vtk? Or do you mean something totally different?  Clearly my understanding of "it was to inherit" was totally wrong.  I would prefer to stick with the downstream filter if that's more robust.

Could you give me a quick explanation in this context?  In addition could you point me towards an example of using a downstream filter in this context?

Sorry again for the confusion,
Andy

The instructions I gave were for a downstream filter separate from D3.  If you want to modify D3 itself (which sounds like a reasonable good idea for your purposes) then you will have change the value for UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS that the RequestData reads.  If you want to go with this approach, first blow away your RequestUpdateExtent method.  Let D3 do its regular thing.  Then implement a RequestData method like the following:

int MyD3::RequestData(
  vtkInformation *request,
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int requestedGhostLevel = outInfo->Get(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS());
  outInfo->Set(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(),
    requestedGhostLevel + 1);

  return this->Superclass::RequestData(request, inputVector, outputVector);
}

I don't know if the executive is going to get upset about you changing UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS in RequestData, but I think it will be all right.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [vtkusers] [Paraview] vtkDistributedDataFilter and ghost cells - PROGRESS

So I've added this in an .cpp file and complied it:

vtkStandardNewMacro(MyD3)

MyD3::MyD3()
: vtkDistributedDataFilter()
{
}

void MyD3::PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent)
{
  this->Superclass::PrintSelf(os,indent);
}

int MyD3::RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
     vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
     vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  int piece, numPieces, ghostLevels;

  // We require an extra layer of ghost cells from upstream.

  piece = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER());
  numPieces = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES());
  ghostLevels = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS()) + 1; //##### New bit, modified from Ken's notes

  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), piece);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), numPieces);
  inInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS(), ghostLevels);

  return 1;
}

And I add this to a .h file:

class MyD3
  : public vtkDistributedDataFilter
{
  vtkTypeMacro(MyD3, vtkDistributedDataFilter);

public:
  static MyD3 *New();
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
  int RequestUpdateExtent(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
 vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
 vtkInformationVector *outputVector);
protected:
  MyD3();

private:
  // MyD3(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
  // void operator=(const MyD3&);  // Not implemented.
};

I then invoke it in parallel 3 way, as I did before, but now using:

  vtkSmartPointer<MyD3> dd = vtkSmartPointer<MyD3>::New();

  // here mesh is a vtkUnstructuredGrid on each processor, obtained from other (non-vtk) means, but represents a valid and checked subset of the entire mesh.
  dd->SetInput(mesh);
  dd->SetController(getVtkController());
  dd->SetBoundaryModeToSplitBoundaryCells();  // clipping
  dd->UseMinimalMemoryOff();
  dd->Update();

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid> ddUmesh(vtkUnstructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(dd->GetOutput()));

  auto ids = ddUmesh->GetPointData()->GetGlobalIds();
  auto cids = ddUmesh->GetCellData()->GetGlobalIds();

########################
Notes:

1) Both ids, and cids remain null, although I now understand from Ken that cids will always be null as they're not created.
2) Using totalview and stopping the code in parallel 3 way on line 670 of vtkDistributedDataFilter.cxx, the member this->GhostLevel is always zero and never executes codes branches dependent on it, however, the above code successfully increments the ghostLevels to one.
3) So basically moved forward a little bit, but still not working.  Any thoughts??
4) If I had created the ghost cells, how would I know, is my next question.  How can I visualise them to check?

Any thoughts really welcome.

Cheers again,
Andy

Perhaps an easy solution is to append a "GlobalCellID" and
"GlobalNodeID" before thresholding. To the best of my knowledge,
threshold will extract vtkUnstructuredGrid instance from whatever goes
in the input and not automatically retain this type of global
information.

Hope this helps.

I recommend both. A bug tracker item and an email to the list
referring to the bug entry.

That way it gets noticed immediately (mailing list) and persists if it
can't be resolved in the short term (bug tracker).

Compile does not work for me because when VTK_USE_S?YSTEM_HDF5 is ON and the external HDF5 is built with parallel support, the hdf5 needs to include the mpi directories.

After quite a lot of painful testing (I wanted to do it the right way rather than just manually adding include_directories and link libs to netcdf, xmf, vtkIOAMR  ...)
I discover that
vtk_module(vtkhdf5
  DEPENDS
    vtkzlib
  EXCLUDE_FROM_WRAPPING
  )

But how do I conditionally say (this would only work for a cmake configured hdf5, not an autoconf one, but that's a fair compromise for this I think)

if(VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5)
  if (HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL)
    if (NOT PARAVIEW_USE_MPI)
      MESSAGE(ERROR "System HDF5 uses MPI but PARAVIEW_USE_MPI is ${PARAVIEW_USE_MPI}")
    endif(NOT PARAVIEW_USE_MPI)
#
# In here we need to say conditionally depend on MPI
# But how do I add #include paths to the auto generated
# set(vtkhdf5_SYSTEM_INCLUDES ${MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH})

  endif (HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL)
endif(VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5)

When I add the MPI path to the variable, it is overwritten before it gets to the Xdmf,netCDF, subdirs. I can't find the real place where it is set permanently. Seems like the 3rd party macro needs extra options to pass in dependent paths like this.

Any help appreciated.

Thanks

JB

Message-ID: <CAFFYk1VsDPgqO2C_-W-Dh_eeufhnkRdvA1DW5qec-OpH7VRJBw@mail.gmail.com>

The screenshot posted to http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13630 shows
the correct functionality in 3.14. This same, drag to select multiple,
feature is not working in 3.98. On the surface, very trivial, but uses up a
lot of time on large cases.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.98 Large geometry representation being set to
 surface instead of outline by default
Message-ID: <CAFFYk1WF6Ovu1HNZ=YpKTXxsQ-OEntZB=z0jXZR1ivcTzBZXdA@mail.gmail.com>

In ParaView 3.14, if you load a large dataset, the representation would
automatically be set to "Outline". If the dataset was smaller, or you use
ExtractBlock to get the size down, ParaView selects "Surface" by default.
In 3.98 however, everything is set to "Surface", so if you load a dataset
with a huge flow field, it takes ages to load or crashes.

What I have done is used D3 internally in my reader to partition the data
and always have just 1 ghost level.  This could mean issues if more were
needed but it's not necessary for the usual post-processing tasks of users.

To add global ids just create the array and call SetGlobalIds on your
dataset.

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Running Data from multiple nodes on Paraview
Message-ID: <1352406798.66877.YahooMailNeo@web125903.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone,

I was wondering if it was possible to have paraview access data fragments located on several different computer nodes (while running in parallel) and combine them to form a cohesive data set. Basically you can imagine it as having a house built of legos that I took apart and deposited the lego blocks on various local memory disks on different nodes. Can paraview access the individual pieces of the lego house on the nodes and rebuilt it so that the house looks exactly like the way before I took it apart?

sorry for the symbolism.... not sure if its a good example but I'd appreciate any help or comments!

Thanks!
Tom Taylor?

You can change the outline threshold from "Edit | Settings | Render View"
page, under the "Default Representation" group.

Hi Tim,

This should get set in the RequestDataDescription method in the generated
Python script. When I first did it I thought we'd easily be able to figure
out which fields were needed in order to update all of the required
pipelines and/or views. Unfortunately this isn't trivial in VTK so
basically what happens is that if a writer or view should output it
specifies that all fields should be made available. This is the
"datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).AllFieldsOn()" part of the
generated python script.

Answering your final question, this is something that is done automatically
in the generated script.

Andy, 

Thanks for the answer. 

What I'm doing doesn't use any writers -- I just want the CoProcessor to output images only. So I don't attach a writer, I just export the state and tell it to "Output Rendering Components". My pipeline looks like: 

Load file -> CellDataToPointData -> Slice 

This results in a RequestDataDescription: 

def RequestDataDescription(datadescription): 
"Callback to populate the request for current timestep" 
if datadescription.GetForceOutput() == True: 
for i in range(datadescription.GetNumberOfInputDescriptions()): 
datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).AllFieldsOn() 
datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).GenerateMeshOn() 
return 

for input_name in simulation_input_map.values(): 
LoadRequestedData(datadescription, input_name) 

This means in my case, there are no fields defined inside the datadescription. So when I try to do the IsFieldNeeded() call in my adaptor, it's always false. If I print the number of fields from GetNumberOfFields(), I get 0. 

So my images when they pop out have no data -- the fields don't exist for them to plot. It's just the slice using the default color for the surface. 

I got it to work by making a new variable just under simulation_input_map: 

simulation_cell_fields_needed = {simulation_input_map['rest_00000.xmf']: ["Temperature [K]", "Density [kg/m^3]"]} 
simulation_point_fields_needed = {simulation_input_map['rest_00000.xmf']: []} 

and putting in RequestDataDescription before the loop that calls LoadRequestedData: 

for input_name in simulation_input_map.values(): 
idd = datadescription.GetInputDescriptionByName(input_name) 
for cell_fields in simulation_cell_fields_needed[input_name]: 
idd.AddCellField(cell_fields) 
for point_fields in simulation_point_fields_needed[input_name]: 
idd.AddPointField(point_fields) 

When I do that, it all works. 

Now, I guess my question is this... Where in the exported state script does it say what fields there are in the data? If I do a trace, when I load a file, I get something like: 

REST_00207_xmf.CellArrays = ['APD_mass_fraction', 'APD_reaction_rate', 'AP_mass_fraction', 'AP_reaction_rate', 'BND_mass_fraction', 'BND\ 
_reaction_rate', 'Density [kg/m^3]', 'HybridSwitch', 'N2_mass_fraction', 'PRD_mass_fraction', 'PRD_reaction_rate', 'Pressure [Pa]', 'Subgrid\ 
kinetic energy [m^2/s^2]', 'Temperature [K]', 'Velocity [m/s]', 'iblanks'] 

and I expected something similar in the exported state script. But I don't see anything like that. 

Following the Fortran API, I call the ClearFieldDataFromGrid which may get rid of the fields that Paraview told it the pipeline needs. 

I could be misunderstanding something, I've never used VTK before this little project attempt. I can certainly send my adaptor code and python script if it helps clarify. 

Thanks again, 

Tim

Hi, 

I see in the example code for ParaView/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/PhastaAdaptor/PhastaAdaptor.cxx calls like: 

vtkCPInputDataDescription* idd = 
ParaViewCoProcessing::GetCoProcessorData()->GetInputDescriptionByName("input"); 

... 

if(idd->IsFieldNeeded("velocity")) 
{ 
... 

The only way IsFieldNeeded returns true is if that name field was added with AddCellField or AddPointField. 

Where does that happen? My intuition says that the python or C++ processing script (generated by exporting state) would have those calls in it for the datasets that are actually used. In other words, if I set up my view in the GUI and I load my data and put a Slice through it and color by "Velocity", I expected the script from Export State to contain a call to AddCellField("Velocity").

Ah, I think I see what's going on now. I think it was a bug in the
generated scripts that was causing problems. Were you getting something
like the following in your script:
write_frequencies    = {'input': ['1']}

The bug was that the 1 shouldn't be in quotes. If you take that out do you
start getting the results you expect? If not, can you share your generated
Python script?

That was also a bug that resulted in errors I fixed, it wasn't what is causing this other issue. 

Attached is a tar file with a few files: 

cpScript_orig.py is what comes out of Python, but after I changed the write_frequencies thing to get rid of the quotes. That generates an image where the slice is gray. 

cpScript.py is the one I modified to add the needed fields. This generates an image where the slice is colored by the colormap. This is the PNG file in the tar file. 

coprocessingwrap.cxx is the interface for Fortran. 

ParaviewCoProcessor.hxx/cxx is the class to handle the CP handles. 

This is called from a Fortran code where each time step it calls a function that does: 

CALL ClearData(...) 
CALL CheckTime(...) 

DO blk = 1, numBlocks 
<set a bunch of pointers to Fortran data arrays> 
CALL AddData(...) 
END DO 

CALL CoProcess(...) 

All those functions are in the wrapper C++ code. 

I may be doing something horribly wrong... But it works when I modified the script as you see in cpScript.py. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Ah, I think I see what's going on now. I think it was a bug in the generated scripts that was causing problems. Were you getting something like the following in your script: 
write_frequencies = {'input': ['1']} 

The bug was that the 1 shouldn't be in quotes. If you take that out do you start getting the results you expect? If not, can you share your generated Python script?

Andy, 

Thanks for the answer. 

What I'm doing doesn't use any writers -- I just want the CoProcessor to output images only. So I don't attach a writer, I just export the state and tell it to "Output Rendering Components". My pipeline looks like: 

Load file -> CellDataToPointData -> Slice 

This results in a RequestDataDescription: 

def RequestDataDescription(datadescription): 
"Callback to populate the request for current timestep" 
if datadescription.GetForceOutput() == True: 
for i in range(datadescription.GetNumberOfInputDescriptions()): 
datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).AllFieldsOn() 
datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).GenerateMeshOn() 
return 

for input_name in simulation_input_map.values(): 
LoadRequestedData(datadescription, input_name) 

This means in my case, there are no fields defined inside the datadescription. So when I try to do the IsFieldNeeded() call in my adaptor, it's always false. If I print the number of fields from GetNumberOfFields(), I get 0. 

So my images when they pop out have no data -- the fields don't exist for them to plot. It's just the slice using the default color for the surface. 

I got it to work by making a new variable just under simulation_input_map: 

simulation_cell_fields_needed = {simulation_input_map['rest_00000.xmf']: ["Temperature [K]", "Density [kg/m^3]"]} 
simulation_point_fields_needed = {simulation_input_map['rest_00000.xmf']: []} 

and putting in RequestDataDescription before the loop that calls LoadRequestedData: 

for input_name in simulation_input_map.values(): 
idd = datadescription.GetInputDescriptionByName(input_name) 
for cell_fields in simulation_cell_fields_needed[input_name]: 
idd.AddCellField(cell_fields) 
for point_fields in simulation_point_fields_needed[input_name]: 
idd.AddPointField(point_fields) 

When I do that, it all works. 

Now, I guess my question is this... Where in the exported state script does it say what fields there are in the data? If I do a trace, when I load a file, I get something like: 

REST_00207_xmf.CellArrays = ['APD_mass_fraction', 'APD_reaction_rate', 'AP_mass_fraction', 'AP_reaction_rate', 'BND_mass_fraction', 'BND\ 
_reaction_rate', 'Density [kg/m^3]', 'HybridSwitch', 'N2_mass_fraction', 'PRD_mass_fraction', 'PRD_reaction_rate', 'Pressure [Pa]', 'Subgrid\ 
kinetic energy [m^2/s^2]', 'Temperature [K]', 'Velocity [m/s]', 'iblanks'] 

and I expected something similar in the exported state script. But I don't see anything like that. 

Following the Fortran API, I call the ClearFieldDataFromGrid which may get rid of the fields that Paraview told it the pipeline needs. 

I could be misunderstanding something, I've never used VTK before this little project attempt. I can certainly send my adaptor code and python script if it helps clarify. 

Thanks again, 

Tim

Hi Tim, 

This should get set in the RequestDataDescription method in the generated Python script. When I first did it I thought we'd easily be able to figure out which fields were needed in order to update all of the required pipelines and/or views. Unfortunately this isn't trivial in VTK so basically what happens is that if a writer or view should output it specifies that all fields should be made available. This is the "datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).AllFieldsOn()" part of the generated python script. 

Answering your final question, this is something that is done automatically in the generated script.

Hi, 

I see in the example code for ParaView/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/PhastaAdaptor/PhastaAdaptor.cxx calls like: 

vtkCPInputDataDescription* idd = 
ParaViewCoProcessing::GetCoProcessorData()->GetInputDescriptionByName("input"); 

... 

if(idd->IsFieldNeeded("velocity")) 
{ 
... 

The only way IsFieldNeeded returns true is if that name field was added with AddCellField or AddPointField. 

Where does that happen? My intuition says that the python or C++ processing script (generated by exporting state) would have those calls in it for the datasets that are actually used. In other words, if I set up my view in the GUI and I load my data and put a Slice through it and color by "Velocity", I expected the script from Export State to contain a call to AddCellField("Velocity"). At the very least I expected to see calls to add the fields I chose to load when I loaded my sample file to set up the view. 

So is that something that I need to put in the script on my own after it's exported or did I miss something? If I have to put it there myself, is RequestDataDescription the correct place to put that? 

Thanks, 

Tim

I wonder if we should add a separate option (or something similar) that
allows users to add arbitrary libs and/or include paths) when using
system-anything for that "something" and then users could add any extra
libs specific to the external module they are using.

Yes. I think that's the easiest way. I managed to fudge the include_directories to pick up mpi, but had to manually override the link of individual targets to get the mpi libs linked as well. I will do it by modifying the third party macro instead because in that place I can cleanly insert the extra dependencies and not have to be intrusive elsewhere. Certainly the include directories will work, the libs seem to be handled slightly differently, because there are cmake target dependencies played with and we're adding a dependency to a non target, but I'll work it out.

I'll submit a patch once I'm done.

NB. When I asked about this kind of transitive link/dependency a long time ago on the cmake list it was suggested that when hdf5 is installed, it should actually add a find package MPI in its own cmake config so that any project that uses it is forced to pull in the mpi if it is needed. Ultimately, I think this is correct, but in the meantime, I'll fix the third party macro too

Folks,

In preparation of the next ParaView release, the ParaView 3.98.0, RC1 is now available for download (http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php).

We will have a detailed summary for the new features and enhancements in this release soon. In the mean time, a complete list of features implemented and bugs fixed in this release can be found on the bug tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php).

A couple of caveats about the binaries currently uploaded at this time:
- We are awaiting 32-bit Linux binaries. They will be uploaded within the next day or so.
- MacOSX binaries currently don't support Mountain Lion (10.8). We're working on a fix and we will have updated binaries soon. The current binaries work on Snow Leopard (10.6) and Lion (10.7).

Message-ID: <20D39E8742F50248811FE74E65B0FB80160641@MBX01.tugraz.local>

Dear Madam/Sir,

I am a student at Graz University of Technology starting with Paraview 3.10.1 and came up with a question I can not answer myself. I am using the Filter called 'Mesh Quality' with the 'Scaled Jacobian' option for hexahedral elements. I have some elements which have only six different vertices (instead of eight, which leads to a wedge) and the result is a value like 1e+30. I want to analyze this result, because in general the range for a 'Scaled Jacobian' is between -1 and +1. Can you provide me with the equation how this 'Scaled Jacobian' is evaluated in Paraview?
If the 'Scaled Jacobian' is evaluated with min(Jk/(norm(e1k)*norm(e2k)*norm(e3k))), where eik are the three edge vectors of vertex k and Jk is the Jacobian at vertex k of a hexahedron (this is evaluated for all 8 vertices and then the minimum is takes), we would get a '0/0' at one vertex of a degenerated hexahedron. I would expect to get an error, but instead I think I get extremely high values. But since the 'Scaled Jacobian' should take the minimum of all values in a hexahedron, I am not sure what is going on there.

I have to thank you a thousand times and hope that anyone can help me with my question!

Best wishes,
Fastl Thomas, BSc

Message-ID: <CAHJ1_RM2emdju-HdZroBgnfTw68UftAmhQKj6UY-A-YWtb+igg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I get this error building a fresh clone of 3.14.1 using gcc 4.7.2, vtk
build and works perfectly fine with this compiler so I presume it's a
slight change in ordering that has caused the problem.:

[ 30%] Building CXX object

Seems very simple, just seems to me to be a missing #include <stdint.h>,
fixing it by including said header in the cxx file above, then gives this:

ParaView/VTK/Rendering/vtkFreeTypeTools.cxx: In function ?FT_Error

ParaView/VTK/Rendering/vtkFreeTypeTools.cxx:229:46: error: ?intptr_t? was
not declared in this scope

including this again inside the cxx fixes this too and it seems to go
through fine.  Probably too late for 3.14.1 but might be of use for
3.98....?

Let me know if this was the wrong thing to use?? As I've change my local
copy to reflect the above.

Hi Andrew,

Can you let us know what compiler and operating system you are using?

Also, have you tried with the new ParaView-3.98-RC1 release?

Thanks,
Kyle

As I said, I'm using gcc 4.7.2 built on opensuse 12.1.  Both CMake and VTK
5.10.1 are built with this compiler and are working perfectly properly.
 However, I was using an old build of paraview.  Updating this to reflect
the change in compiler gives the errors noted below.

I will try to kick of 3.98 over the weekend and feed back anything, but
these I would suggest will likely still be a problem.

Cheers

The issue was resolved with VTK commit 87679d716 (which was not
included with ParaView 3.14.1).

It should not occur with ParaView 3.98-RC1, but please let us know if it does.

Hi Fastl,

> .... I am using the Filter called 'Mesh Quality' with the 'Scaled Jacobian' option for hexahedral elements. I have some elements which have only six different vertices (instead of eight, which leads to a wedge) and the result is a value like 1e+30. I want to analyze this result, because in general the range for a 'Scaled Jacobian' is between -1 and +1. Can you provide me with the equation how this 'Scaled Jacobian' is evaluated in Paraview? 

ParaView uses the Verdict mesh quality library to evaluate the scaled Jacobian quality function. The code for this is located here:

  http://vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTK.git;a=blob;f=ThirdParty/verdict/vtkverdict/V_HexMetric.cpp;hb=HEAD#l1526

> ... I would expect to get an error, but instead I think I get extremely high values.

Verdict substitutes a very large number (VERDICT_DBL_MAX) in the place of errors.

	Hope this helps,
	David

Subject: [Paraview] Best way to make a part of a 3D field/VR invisible
Message-ID: <D9578C47-91E4-4969-8B85-67787F76F01C@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a big rectangular 3D field (few GB) sitting on a uniform grid (hdf5+xdmf reader, 3DCORECTMesh topology).
I would like to make a 3D volume rendering but only on a part of it as this scheme tries to show:
/------/
/-----/  |------/
|      l-------/  |
|_______| / 
This helps me to visualize something placed near the center? Unfortunately, a "clip" or an "extract subset" do not help me? 

Actually, I already did this operation but with some tricky operations like putting  the points of interest to zero directly in the hdf5 dataset?
(I did it serially, it took one night?). I am looking for a smarter way to do that?

Does anyone have an idea to do this? If it could also use the parallel feature of PV ;-)

Stephane

PS: this is not my first attempt, for example I tried with a custom filter:

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Pixie files: build 3.14.1 and 3.98.0
Message-ID: <509D3558.8060406@oato.inaf.it>

I already had this problem with Paraview 3.14.1 but I received no answer 
to a first email,
so I tried to investigate on my own since the problem is still present 
in release 3.98.0.

Paraview can not open a Pixie file (it's a HDF5 format included through 
the VisIt Database
Bridge) when the file includes one timestep only: Paraview just hangs 
indefinitely.
Everything works fine when multiple timesteps are contained in the file.

I suspect that the problem is connected to lines 618-634 in
Utilities/VisItBridge/AvtAlgorithms/vtkAvtFileFormatAlgorithm.cxx:

>   //in some case the times and cycles have all zero values.
>   //This is caused by a file reader that generates the time value
>   //once the reader moves to that timestep.
>   //That kind of behaviour is not possible currently in ParaView. Instead
>   //we will force the reader to generate the time values for each timestep
>   //by cycling through everytime step but not requesting any data.
>   if(hasTime && timesteps[0] == timesteps[timesteps.size()-1])
>     {
>     //we have hit a timestep range that needs to be cycled
>     for(int i=0; i < timesteps.size();++i)
>       {
>       this->ActivateTimestep(i);
>       //Nek and other readers don't update the time info intill you
>       //call gettimes.
>       this->AvtFile->FormatGetTimes(timesteps);
>       }
>     }
The condition is true not only when the same value (0?) has been 
assigned to all
the timesteps but also when there is one timestep only (timesteps.size() 
= 1).
Besides these lines were not present in Paraview 3.10/3.12 and these 
releases
were able to open Pixie files containing one timestep only.

Is it possible to fix this problem? That would be highly appreciated.
Regards,
Claudio

Hi!

Thank you for your work! Properties tab is much more convenient now.

Some bugs or smth that I've noticed:
1. Fonts look awful on my Debian testing amd64 (screenshot is attached)
2. After pressing 'Show' button in Color group the error appears "Arguments  to 
pqLookupTableManager::setScalarBarVisibility cannot be null" if no data were 
choosen, but button remains pressed
3. Can't reset view in Line Chart View after moving around with mouse. In 3.14.1 
I can reset view by turning off and on again one of an active line, now it 
doesn't work.. Also, didn't find an option "Specify the axis range".

	filter
Message-ID: <WGhy2_M9Y9ccn9eErr-0H_mJ3_Mt93T7XLQWbctv3tUBclXQ1AJPdA@cipher.nrlssc.navy.mil>

Howdy!  I'm writing a programmable filter that makes changes to a vector 
field based on grid point properties (it's a polar orthographic 
transform using a highly accurate Earth shape model).

This works well.  However, when one changes the time step, it recomputes 
those grid point properties to apply to the vector field.  This is a 
very expensive operation, and is quite unnecessary since the grid 
doesn't change over time.  I'd like to somehow cache the grid point 
property array so that I could simply reuse it if it's already been 
computed.

I thought about storing it as a Field Data array.  However, can one be 
guaranteed that the Field Data from the programmable filter *output* 
will still be in place within the same filter when the pipeline 
re-executes?  If not, is there some other mechanism for a programmable 
filter to retain persistent data across time step changes?

Thanks!
Sean

I can't tell for sure but what are you using as inputName in
ParaViewCoProcessor.cxx? It should be 'input'. Also, how many time steps
have you run? It should output information only every 10th time step.

Can you try running the attached files as "<exe path>/pvbatch
waveletdriver.py cpwaveletrender.py 5" and send me the output? This should
generate 5 images. You should probably update your paraview source too
before doing this as a couple of bugs got fixed that may be required to run
this example.

It is 'input'. I ran for 120 time steps so I got 12 images -- the original export script generated all gray and the modified one generated the correct data. 

I will update the source/rebuild and run your files and let you know. 

Thanks, 

Tim

I can't tell for sure but what are you using as inputName in ParaViewCoProcessor.cxx? It should be 'input'. Also, how many time steps have you run? It should output information only every 10th time step. 

Can you try running the attached files as "<exe path>/pvbatch waveletdriver.py cpwaveletrender.py 5" and send me the output? This should generate 5 images. You should probably update your paraview source too before doing this as a couple of bugs got fixed that may be required to run this example.

That was also a bug that resulted in errors I fixed, it wasn't what is causing this other issue. 

Attached is a tar file with a few files: 

cpScript_orig.py is what comes out of Python, but after I changed the write_frequencies thing to get rid of the quotes. That generates an image where the slice is gray. 

cpScript.py is the one I modified to add the needed fields. This generates an image where the slice is colored by the colormap. This is the PNG file in the tar file. 

coprocessingwrap.cxx is the interface for Fortran. 

ParaviewCoProcessor.hxx/cxx is the class to handle the CP handles. 

This is called from a Fortran code where each time step it calls a function that does: 

CALL ClearData(...) 
CALL CheckTime(...) 

DO blk = 1, numBlocks 
<set a bunch of pointers to Fortran data arrays> 
CALL AddData(...) 
END DO 

CALL CoProcess(...) 

All those functions are in the wrapper C++ code. 

I may be doing something horribly wrong... But it works when I modified the script as you see in cpScript.py. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Subject: Re: [Paraview] CoProcessing needed fields 

Ah, I think I see what's going on now. I think it was a bug in the generated scripts that was causing problems. Were you getting something like the following in your script: 
write_frequencies = {'input': ['1']} 

The bug was that the 1 shouldn't be in quotes. If you take that out do you start getting the results you expect? If not, can you share your generated Python script?

Andy, 

Thanks for the answer. 

What I'm doing doesn't use any writers -- I just want the CoProcessor to output images only. So I don't attach a writer, I just export the state and tell it to "Output Rendering Components". My pipeline looks like: 

Load file -> CellDataToPointData -> Slice 

This results in a RequestDataDescription: 

def RequestDataDescription(datadescription): 
"Callback to populate the request for current timestep" 
if datadescription.GetForceOutput() == True: 
for i in range(datadescription.GetNumberOfInputDescriptions()): 
datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).AllFieldsOn() 
datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).GenerateMeshOn() 
return 

for input_name in simulation_input_map.values(): 
LoadRequestedData(datadescription, input_name) 

This means in my case, there are no fields defined inside the datadescription. So when I try to do the IsFieldNeeded() call in my adaptor, it's always false. If I print the number of fields from GetNumberOfFields(), I get 0. 

So my images when they pop out have no data -- the fields don't exist for them to plot. It's just the slice using the default color for the surface. 

I got it to work by making a new variable just under simulation_input_map: 

simulation_cell_fields_needed = {simulation_input_map['rest_00000.xmf']: ["Temperature [K]", "Density [kg/m^3]"]} 
simulation_point_fields_needed = {simulation_input_map['rest_00000.xmf']: []} 

and putting in RequestDataDescription before the loop that calls LoadRequestedData: 

for input_name in simulation_input_map.values(): 
idd = datadescription.GetInputDescriptionByName(input_name) 
for cell_fields in simulation_cell_fields_needed[input_name]: 
idd.AddCellField(cell_fields) 
for point_fields in simulation_point_fields_needed[input_name]: 
idd.AddPointField(point_fields) 

When I do that, it all works. 

Now, I guess my question is this... Where in the exported state script does it say what fields there are in the data? If I do a trace, when I load a file, I get something like: 

REST_00207_xmf.CellArrays = ['APD_mass_fraction', 'APD_reaction_rate', 'AP_mass_fraction', 'AP_reaction_rate', 'BND_mass_fraction', 'BND\ 
_reaction_rate', 'Density [kg/m^3]', 'HybridSwitch', 'N2_mass_fraction', 'PRD_mass_fraction', 'PRD_reaction_rate', 'Pressure [Pa]', 'Subgrid\ 
kinetic energy [m^2/s^2]', 'Temperature [K]', 'Velocity [m/s]', 'iblanks'] 

and I expected something similar in the exported state script. But I don't see anything like that. 

Following the Fortran API, I call the ClearFieldDataFromGrid which may get rid of the fields that Paraview told it the pipeline needs. 

I could be misunderstanding something, I've never used VTK before this little project attempt. I can certainly send my adaptor code and python script if it helps clarify. 

Thanks again, 

Tim

Hi Tim, 

This should get set in the RequestDataDescription method in the generated Python script. When I first did it I thought we'd easily be able to figure out which fields were needed in order to update all of the required pipelines and/or views. Unfortunately this isn't trivial in VTK so basically what happens is that if a writer or view should output it specifies that all fields should be made available. This is the "datadescription.GetInputDescription(i).AllFieldsOn()" part of the generated python script. 

Answering your final question, this is something that is done automatically in the generated script. 

Andy

Hi, 

I see in the example code for ParaView/CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/PhastaAdaptor/PhastaAdaptor.cxx calls like: 

vtkCPInputDataDescription* idd = 
ParaViewCoProcessing::GetCoProcessorData()->GetInputDescriptionByName("input"); 

... 

if(idd->IsFieldNeeded("velocity")) 
{ 
... 

The only way IsFieldNeeded returns true is if that name field was added with AddCellField or AddPointField. 

Where does that happen? My intuition says that the python or C++ processing script (generated by exporting state) would have those calls in it for the datasets that are actually used. In other words, if I set up my view in the GUI and I load my data and put a Slice through it and color by "Velocity", I expected the script from Export State to contain a call to AddCellField("Velocity"). At the very least I expected to see calls to add the fields I chose to load when I loaded my sample file to set up the view. 

So is that something that I need to put in the script on my own after it's exported or did I miss something? If I have to put it there myself, is RequestDataDescription the correct place to put that? 

Thanks, 

Tim

Hi Gena,

I don't know about the font, but the point 2 is definitely a bug.
Although, for 3, I think this is intended. If you want to Reset the
display, you just need to click on the "Reset Camera" button that we
usually use for 3D view.

Thanks for your feedback,

Seb

Thanks for the tip -- never used this button before, not for 1D nor 3D..

Subject: [Paraview] Problem opening a pvd collection of pvtu files
Message-ID: <B8860E922D60BD47926888B44470FF630CFC0D819B@INSV01088.v2c2.at>

Hello everybody,
I have a problem opening a collection of pvtu/vtu files that I can open as a series (the *.00x.pvtu series).
I have a pvd file that looks like this
----
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"><Collection>
  <DataSet timestep="   1.000E-03" group="" part="0" file="Single_Simple_Cell/dickesmeshout0001.pvtu"/>
  <DataSet timestep="   2.500E-03" group="" part="0" file="Single_Simple_Cell/dickesmeshout0002.pvtu"/>
   ........
  </Collection></VTKFile>                              
-----
I also have the the pvtu and vtu file it relates to. I can open the vtu and pvtu files without problems. I can animate the frames when I open the pvtu series. I only need this pvd file to get the timesteps right.
The pvtu file looks like this:
-----
<VTKFile type="PUnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <PUnstructuredGrid>
    <PPointData Scalars="dadada">
      <PDataArray type="Float64" Name="dadada" NumberOfComponents="1" format="appended"/>
	.........
    </PPointData>
      <PPoints>
        <DataArray type="Float64" NumberOfComponents="3" format="appended"/>
      </PPoints>
    <Piece Source="dickesmeshout0001par0016.vtu"/>
    <Piece Source="dickesmeshout0002par0016.vtu"/>
     .....
  </PUnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

-----
The the vtu file looks like this:
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <UnstructuredGrid>
    <Piece NumberOfPoints="136" NumberOfCells="83">
      <PointData>
        <DataArray type="Float64" Name="dadada" NumberOfComponents="1" format="appended" offset="0"/>
			....
      </PointData>
      <CellData>
      </CellData>
      <Points>
        <DataArray type="Float64" NumberOfComponents="3" format="appended" offset="7644"/>
      </Points>

        <DataArray type="Int32" Name="types" format="appended" offset="13572"/>
      </Cells>
    </Piece>
  </UnstructuredGrid> <AppendedData encoding="raw"> .....
</AppendedData>
</VTKFile>
-----
When I try to open the pvd file I get the following:
-----

ERROR: In C:\DBD\pvs-x32\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\IO\XML\vtkXMLReader.cxx, line 219 vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridReader (0A04BBE8): Error opening file C:\AVLKiste\Cluster/Single_Simple_Cell/dickesmeshout0001.pvtu

I have tried this with version 3.98.0-RC1-2-ge2fcf70 32bit on windows Itried the same on a linux machine version 3.14.1 64 bit And a windows version 3.14.0-rc2 and got similar error messages

NO idea if this is a bug but from what I understood this should work.
Any hint is appreciated
Thanks folks

Subject: [Paraview] Plot probe value over time
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E0509C588@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I would like to plot a value (say, the temperature) at a specific point (coordinates) over time. If there is a node at that point, I can use the Plot Selection over Time Filter. If not, it should be possible to use interpolation. I can use the Probe Location Filter to define a point by its coordinates. But how do I plot the temperature over time at that point? I didn't manage to do that so far, and would be grateful for a helpful hint.

Thanks,

Matthias

Dear Utkarsh,

    thanks for trying to look into it.

    These are some datasets distributed with VisIt to test the Pixie output

blockedhttp://portal.nersc.gov/svn/visit/trunk/data/pixie_test_data.tar.gz

    As you will notice Paraview 3.14 or newer can not open the file 
pixie_expressions.h5,
    while it correctly opens all other files (pixie3d3.h5, ...), where 
the only difference
    between the files is the number of timesteps contained in each of them.

    The following files are written by the code that we develop 
(http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/):

    blockedhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/18683007/data.2tstep.h5
    blockedhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/18683007/data.1tstep.h5

     Paraview 3.14 or newer can open data.2tstep.h5 but hangs when 
trying to open data.1tstep.h5.
     These files contain 2 and 1 timesteps respectively, but their 
structure is exactly the same
     (groups, attributes, datasets, etc etc ...)

     Previous versions of Paraview (down to 3.10) and VisIt (up to the 
current release 2.5.2) can
     correctly open all the files. Therefore I suspect that the problem 
is somewhere in the bridge
     from VisIt to Paraview of the two most recent releases.
     I have always used the pre-compiled binaries for Mac OS X 64-bit Intel.

     Thanks again,
     Claudio

Subject: [Paraview] Specifying line color
Message-ID: <CAKUy6npcZCypZbbCWZF5s7ATSa59y_zjFLvqHBnX8AmrU6Zj6g@mail.gmail.com>

As part of my visualization, I need to show 3d points that have been moved,
i.e each point has an original position and a moved position.
I want to visualize this as a set of lines, where each line connects the
point's original position drawn in red and the moved position drawn in
blue. I can do this by saving a vtk with a set of points, the original
positions AND the moved position, and associate a scalar to each point to
denote whether it is an original position or a moved position. Then I
associate lines with each pair of points.
This almost works for me, the one thing is that I want the line to be
flat-shaded with one color (preferably even a dashed line). But the line
always interpolates the red\blue values of its vertices.
Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way?

Ok, the problem with the wrong perspective was on my side. I simply got my 
rotation matrix wrong...

Great.. good to know. Also, we have branch that has some fixes which make
the grab style work nicely for most of the scenarios. Hopefully this week
or next week we will have that merged into master. There is another branch
from Cory (thanks!) that fixes a crash at initialization that I just
approved.

Thanks

It boils down to coincident topology resolution strategy. Try playing with
the "Coincident Topology Resolution" settings in the Edit | Settings
dialog, under the "Render View" page.

Matthias,

Couldn't you create a "point" selection (either 'Select Points On' or
'Select Points Through') for the probed point itself and then do "Extract
Selection Over Time"?

This seems to work for me on Linux and Mac (the only platforms I could test
on as I am travelling). Have you tried these on anything other than
Windows? I wonder if it's a Windows only problem. I will test on Windows
once I get back later this week.

You can use --use-old-panels command line argument, but we'd like to get
rid of that in future. We expect cleaning up of the new properties panel in
time and hopefully you won't need to use the option anymore :).

Message-ID: <20121113150835.9mx44ws884o0gwc4@webmail.slingshot.co.nz>

Hi,

I am on linux and I tried to configure paraview with VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF on.
It failed miserably even though I have protobuf 2.4.0a installed. The message
was informative once I figured out what the problem was:
CMake Error at VTK/CMake/vtkModuleMacros.cmake:578 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findprotobuf.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "protobuf",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "protobuf" with any
  of the following names:

    protobufConfig.cmake
    protobuf-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "protobuf" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "protobuf_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "protobuf" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  ThirdParty/protobuf/CMakeLists.txt:37 (vtk_module_third_party)


The problem is that linux is case sensitive and cmake (2.8.9 and 2.8.10.1)
install FindProtobuf.cmake. Notice the capital P? I am guessing I will have to
change one of the "protobuf" to "Protobuf" in
ThirdParty/protobuf/CMakeLists.txt.
But one more thing is nagging me. This is happening in the VTK subfolder so
presumably while configuring VTK. Yet I don't see any use of protobuf in VTK,
only in Paraview. So it should really be a Paraview_use_system_protobuf setting
and not be set up in VTK. I could of course be wrong.

Cheers,
Francois

Message-ID: <20121113154544.1e0owsg8o0sgkgo0@webmail.slingshot.co.nz>

Another problem I have now is with system hdf5. I get the following:
Disabling NETCDF4 support since HDF5_HL is missing.

Yet I have hdf5_hl installed and it is detected by cmake as well since
HDF%_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY is defined and pointing to the right thing.
I believe that the cmake testing logic in
VTK/ThirdParty/netcdf/vtknetcdf/CMakeLists.txt
is wrong:
set (USE_NETCDF4 OFF)
if (NOT VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5)
  # using VTK's HDF5, we always build that with HL support.
  set (USE_NETCDF4 ON)
elseif(HDF5_HL_LIBRARY)
  set (USE_NETCDF4 ON)
else()
  message(STATUS "Disabling NETCDF4 support since HDF5_HL is missing.")
endif ()

HDF5_HL_LIBRARY is the wrong variable to test, it should be
HDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY.
The change works for me. By the way any chance to be able to use the system
netcdf  as debian does in its build (and that I shamelessly copied in Gentoo).

I don't suppose we are any closer to being able to compile paraview 
against a separately compiled VTK?

Hi Utkarsh,

I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean. The string "select points" does not figure in the User's Guide. AFAIK I can select a point only if it is a node. But I would like to probe the temperature at a point which is located between nodes, so I need to interpolate. The interpolated temperature should be plotted over time.
So my question: How do I do that?

Thank you for a further explanation,

Matthias

Matthias,

Couldn't you create a "point" selection (either 'Select Points On' or 'Select Points Through') for the probed point itself and then do "Extract Selection Over Time"?

This seems to work for me on Linux and Mac (the only platforms I could test on as I am travelling). Have you tried these on anything other than Windows? I wonder if it's a Windows only problem. I will test on Windows once I get back later this week.

Hi,

in the new binary (3.98.0-RC1, Windows 32 bit), I still cannot add points to the current selection by holding the ctrl key (bug 0013056). Is there a workaround or fix in sight? I use this feature frequently, so I will have to stick with 3.12.0-RC2 until this is fixed (it doesn't work in 3.14 either).

Message-ID: <CAHJ1_RPb7mZLn66w3a+_=e421L9MK_02JL1=LOx1Yb9m03NKPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

So as requested, I built the latest rc against 4.7.2 and that also happens
to be built against qt 4.8.3, and it compiles and installs fine. This is
built against openmpi 1.6.2 with use_mpi on.  However, I have noticed that
when loading multiple files around 20 of them, vtu's in this instance, each
representing a sub part of the domain, after apply is pressed it only opens
the last file in the list.  I had to go through each file, 20 odd and click
apply on each to see them all.  Don't know if this is a known bug, or is a
feature change and I'm now doing it incorrectly, but this does not behave
the same as 3.14.1.... would be nice if you only needed to press apply once
as before.

Hope the info is useful,
Cheers,
Andy

The simplest way to do what you want is to use the "Probe Location"
filter to specify the point in space you want to sample values onto,
then use "Select Points On" to make a selection of that filter's
output. Finally apply "Plot Selection over Time".

Hi,

I can't get it to work.
I have specified a point with "Probe Location", clicked on "Select Points On", and selected the cross generated by "Probe Location". But "Plot Selection Over Time" gives an empty plot. "Extract Selection" doesn't help either. Obviously I am missing something, but what?

Thank you,

Matthias

P.S.: I have tried with both 3.12.0-RC2 and 3.98.0-RC1 under Windows XP (32bit).

I don't know. Works for me using the can.ex2 data set with 3.12 or
3.98 binaries on mac.

Hmmm...
Can anybody on the list confirm that this works under Windows?
If it doesn't, could this be a bug?
Is the can.ex2 dataset available somewhere so that I can exclude that the fault is in my dataset?

Hi Andy,

This is a known bug (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13494) that
I'm working on. It will be fixed for the final 3.98 release.

Takuya,

I have a similar problem with a simple VTK filter plugin and a
representation plugin. Unfortunately, I don't have a better solution
than what you propose, but I just wanted to confirm that this is a new
problem, at least on Mac OS X.

Just a followup:

My plugins build and link against ParaView 3.98-RC1 without error, so
a regression has been introduced since then.

The quick work-around is to link your plugin against
vtkRenderingMatplotlib when python is enabled. We do this for part of
the CoProcessing plugin that comes with ParaView. This is not a good
long term solution IMO, but hopefully someone with a better knowledge
of the modular build system can propose a better solution...

Dav,

The patch you made in commit c369423b81ab182e7af26ed6dec90458ada9b77b
appears to have introduced the error. I'll try to come up with a fix.

can.ex2 (also often renamed can.exo) and disk_out_ref.ex2 (also often renamed disk_out_ref.exo) are two workhorse, very small datasets that are in the ParaView data download.  Go to the ParaView web site, Resources/ Downloads/ Type of Download/ Data, Documents and Tutorials.

can.ex2 has two blocks, and time data.
disk_out_ref.ex2 includes temperature, pressure and a vector field.

Hmmm...
Can anybody on the list confirm that this works under Windows?
If it doesn't, could this be a bug?
Is the can.ex2 dataset available somewhere so that I can exclude that the fault is in my dataset?

A better solution was pointed out to me off-list -- try adding

include(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

and then linking against ${VTK_LIBRARIES}. This should be better in
the long-term.

Utkarsh,
I tried this on Linux, and it works fine.
I tried this windows (master pull from about last Friday, November 10), and it does not work.  Not sure if it is related, but my debug build outputs the following warning:

Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\..\..\src\ParaView3\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 408
Call not supported for the current property type.

Matthias, if you have not already, please write this up as a bug.

This seems to work for me on Linux and Mac (the only platforms I could test on as I am travelling). Have you tried these on anything other than Windows? I wonder if it's a Windows only problem. I will test on Windows once I get back later this week.

Hi,

in the new binary (3.98.0-RC1, Windows 32 bit), I still cannot add points to the current selection by holding the ctrl key (bug 0013056). Is there a workaround or fix in sight? I use this feature frequently, so I will have to stick with 3.12.0-RC2 until this is fixed (it doesn't work in 3.14 either).

I just tried to <Ctrl> select multiple sets of points with the version
of ParaView on Fedora 17.

I was able to select multiple sets of points with the "Select Points On"
button but not with the "Select Points Through" button.

Hi Tim,

Sorry for the slow reply. I'm away at a conference.

It shouldn't matter how the data object was created in the adaptor.

For the life of me, I can't figure out why you're getting this behavior.
You can probably just take out the IsFieldNeeded() check in
coprocessingwrap.cxx. You should be making sure that if flag is set to 0 in
your checktime_() method that the grid and fields aren't reconstructed
anyways and you can skip the call to coprocess_().

I think need to fix this. Plugins should not need to link against anything extra unless they explicitly add dependencies on other modules. 

Cory, temporarily fix the issue as david suggested but we'll have that fixed before the release so you won't have to.

Indeed, only 'select point/cell on' are supported and not select through. I'll give it a more through test once I get back at office later this week.

We are a little closer :), but not all the way there yet. There are placeholders in the top level CMakeLists.txt that make it possible to use system VTK. But when I was writing that code VTK was not yet ready to allow building of external modules. Things have charged since and we can get back to giving that a try, but that'll be after 3.98 is out.

Hi Aashish,

I'm very interested in getting this to work, please point me to the 
right place in the code.

Do you know why the Paraview-own VTK does not support Tdx and does not 
use it ? (the option is there in the cmake but than something is 
missing, because it does not ask for VTK_TDX_INCLUDE_PATH and that's why 
I think compilation breaks)
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/3DConnexion_Devices_Support

I was able to get the TDx TestApp to work with an extern build of VTK 
and hoped it would be straightforward to use ist in Paraview -- but i 
gave up at this point.

Thank you,
Christian

Bug 0013056, exists since 3.14. I am not sure if it worked with 3.12.0, but it definitively works with 3.12.0-RC2, which I am still using for this very reason.

Thanks,

Utkarsh,
I tried this on Linux, and it works fine.
I tried this windows (master pull from about last Friday, November 10), and it does not work.  Not sure if it is related, but my debug build outputs the following warning:

Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\..\..\src\ParaView3\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 408
Call not supported for the current property type.

Matthias, if you have not already, please write this up as a bug.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Still cannot add to selection with Crtl key

This seems to work for me on Linux and Mac (the only platforms I could test on as I am travelling). Have you tried these on anything other than Windows? I wonder if it's a Windows only problem. I will test on Windows once I get back later this week.

Hi,

in the new binary (3.98.0-RC1, Windows 32 bit), I still cannot add points to the current selection by holding the ctrl key (bug 0013056). Is there a workaround or fix in sight? I use this feature frequently, so I will have to stick with 3.12.0-RC2 until this is fixed (it doesn't work in 3.14 either).

Hi,

I have downloaded can.ex2, and still don't get the selection to work.

Procedure (3.12.0-RC2, Windows XP 32 bit):
1. Open dataset
2. Apply
3. Filters-> Probe Location
4. Move mouse to point, hit "p"
5. Apply
6. Click on "Select Points On"
7. Click on point
8. Filters->Plot Selection over Time
9. Apply

Result: an empty plot appears.

Can anyone confirm this, or tell me what I am doing wrong?

Thanks,

Matthias

Hi Franz,

do you mean that you get a non-empty plot with the can.ex2 dataset, using the procedure I described below with additionally setting Interpolation to "flat", using ParaView (which Version?) under Windows?
I have just tried, it does not change anything for me, the plot is still empty.
If you have found a way to get a non-empty plot, could you describe in detail what you are doing?

Thanks,

Matthias

Subject: [Paraview] Open CSV files without csv extension
Message-ID: <3721196.n75oIf7bWL@horus>

Hello,

I have a bunch of files that are (kind of) csv format:

0 0.12
0.5 0.1342
1 1.426
...

They are named with the extension .dat. Is there a way to use the CSV reader 
to open that file? If I try to open I'm only offered three choices of other 
readers.

Thanks,

Florian

Hi everyone, hi Sebastien,
I have a follow-up question about the exporting of X3D files via python. 
I noticed that the X3DExporter (see code below) works fine, but creates 
only ascii- X3D files, not the binary ones (*.X3Db). The binary export 
is available through the GUI, so I'm pretty sure there must a python way 
of doing it. I tried some obvious first guesses (renamed 
exporters.X3DExporter(FileName="foo.x3d") to 
exporters.X3DBinaryExporter(FileName="foo.x3d") for example ) , but 
couldn't find a way to do it. Is there some easy way to export as binary 
x3d, instead of ascii?

Thanks for reading, best regards
Andrea

I tested pv 3.14 on windows and it worked for me.

Try using the spreadsheet view to make sure that:
1) your probe is placed inside the data set and thus outputting something.
2) you have selected the probe's output point

I suspect 2 is the problem. When I went to select the probe's output
before applying the plot over time filter, I turned visibility of the
can data off to make sure I selected it.

In the spreadsheet view you should see the point become highlighted
when you select it in the 3D view, and if you select it directly in
the spreadsheet view you should likewise see it highlighted in the 3D
view.

Hi David,

I have it working now!
It turned out that 1) and 2) were the problems. I have learned that clicking into a 2D geometry (with z=0) for the probe location does not necessarily give a probe which is actually in the 2D body (the probe output was zero because the z coordinate was nonzero - when I manually set it to zero, the probe output becomes nonzero). Furthermore, selecting the probe with the mouse is not always successful, I sometimes have to use the spreadsheet.

Thank you for your help!

Matthias

Nooj,

Feel free to send us a tarball or post it on gitorious or github and we can
take it from there.

Hi all,
   this is probably a silly question, but I can't find the answer. Is
there a way to define a programmable filter in a .py file (besides
copying and pasting it into the "Script" property of the programmable
filter?).

Thank you,
   Marco

Subject: [Paraview] pvtu files
Message-ID: <1352911971.23697.YahooMailNeo@web125905.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to write a .pvtu file so I can run paraview in parallel. My code works and paraview displays the 4 vtu files properly. Now I am trying to modify the <Piece Source="fields-0000-0000.vtu"/> path so that the field-0000-000*.vtu files do not have to be in the same directory as the .pvtu file. I managed to successfully implement the path changes for accessing the .vtu files when they are either one directory up or down

<Piece Source="../fields-0000-0000.vtu"/>??? ## this accesses the file one directory up


<Piece Source="level1/fields-0000-0000.vtu"/> ## this accesses the file in the directory level1 which is within the directory in which the .pvtu file is

My question is how I would have to change the path syntax to be able to access the fields-...-.vtu files in a completely different directory? 


<Piece Source="~/home/tom/fields-0000-0000.vtu"/> ##this syntax doesn't work
<Piece Source="/home/tom/fields-0000-0000.vtu"/> ##this syntax doesn't work either



Can I access the files if they are stored on a different node (while running paraview in parallel)?

<Piece Source="node14:/scratch/tom/fields-0000-0000.vtu"/> ##this syntax doesn't work either...



Thanks!

Hello,

using "git clone --recursive"
it is possible to checkout and build paraview with all 
dependencies/submodules.
is it also possible to have headers, shared libs of all 
paraview+dependencies being installed
to the system from "make install" invoked from the paraview build dir?

I want to use paraview vtk extensions and vtk for implementing in c++.

Thanks in advance.

That's right - too many irons in the fire.  It has been marked as todo.

Bug 0013056, exists since 3.14. I am not sure if it worked with 3.12.0, but it definitively works with 3.12.0-RC2, which I am still using for this very reason.

Thanks,

Utkarsh,
I tried this on Linux, and it works fine.
I tried this windows (master pull from about last Friday, November 10), and it does not work.  Not sure if it is related, but my debug build outputs the following warning:

Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\..\..\src\ParaView3\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 408
Call not supported for the current property type.

Matthias, if you have not already, please write this up as a bug.

This seems to work for me on Linux and Mac (the only platforms I could test on as I am travelling). Have you tried these on anything other than Windows? I wonder if it's a Windows only problem. I will test on Windows once I get back later this week.

Hi,

in the new binary (3.98.0-RC1, Windows 32 bit), I still cannot add points to the current selection by holding the ctrl key (bug 0013056). Is there a workaround or fix in sight? I use this feature frequently, so I will have to stick with 3.12.0-RC2 until this is fixed (it doesn't work in 3.14 either).

Jade,

We need more information before we can properly answer this question.  First, which netCDF reader are you using (there is more than one in ParaView)?  Unless your data is of a particular format, you should be using the "netCDF files generic and CF conventions".

Second, we need to know the information about the variables defined.  What variables are defined, what are their dimensions, and what are their attributes.

I am guessing that you have not properly identified the variable "Time" as a time dimension in your netCDF file (simply naming it "Time" is not sufficient in the CF convention).  To identify it as time, you also need to define a variable named "Time" of dimension "Time" and containing the property "units" that contains a string value defining some time unit (such as "seconds since 1992-10-8 15:15:42.5 -6:00".  The contents of this variable should contain the time stamp for each time slice.  See the documentation for the CF convention (http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.6/cf-conventions.html#time-coordinate) for more details.

-Ken

Hello,

I am trying to get Paraview to represent the cell normals through 3d-arrow
normal glyph filter for the following file. The cell normals should all
appear in the +Z-Direction but the lines I have included are causing
certain normals to be affected. If I remove these lines, the normals are
represented correctly. Is there a way I can include the lines in my data
file but not have them be an input for the normal glyph filter? I have
included a file with the lines and without the lines. By using the default
Normal Glyph filter in Paraview, the arrows should be different. Thank you
for your help

Best,
Dan Levitus

Hi,

Is it possible to use a vtkStripper with the 3.98.0-RC1 on a programmable
filter  ?

If I do :

from paraview import vtk

stripper = vtk.vtkStripper()


I've got :

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'vtkStripper'

With the 3.14, there's no error.
Also, there is much more things when you print an "inspect.getmembers(vtk)"
with the 3.14 release.

Thanks,

Eddy

Hi Eddy,


the reason for that is we are missing a bunch of import in
${PV_SRC}/Wrapping/Python/paraview/vtk/__init__.py


But if you add that line, that will solve your vtk.vtkStripper() call.


from vtkFiltersCorePython import *


I'll push more vtk module into __init__.py so that should be fixed for
the release.


Thanks,


Seb

Sam,

While that would work, my goal is to maintain 1 data file. The two files I
attached are the same except one has lines and one doesn't. I only included
both so it wouldn't be necessary for you to delete the code yourself.
Eventually, there is more I would like to include in this file (node
numbering, cell numbering, tangent and normal vectors on the lines(the
lines are meant to represent crack fronts).

Does this help?

Best,
Dan

*** THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT REGULARLY TESTED YET ****

So there is some support for doing that on linux. When configuring with
Cmake, set your CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX correctly and then turn
on PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES, which is an advanced CMake option.
Then on make install, ParaView will install all headers and dependencies
under the prefix specified. We do plan to support this, but until
dashboards are setup to test this regularly, I am going to call this
support experimental.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for your reply. Yes, I am the "netCDF files generic and CF
conventions" reader.
The file possesses the the variable 'Times':

variables:
        char Times(Time, DateStrLen) ;
                Times:units = "seconds since 2010-11-9 00:00:00+0:00" ;


and the Times variable is a list of datetimes (with slightly different
format to the example on the CF page):
['2012-09-06_00:00:00',
 '2012-09-06_01:00:00',
 '2012-09-06_02:00:00',

Could the problem be that the dimension is named 'Time', and the variable

Yes, having the variable with a different name as the dimension is a problem. If the name is not the same, then the reader will not pick up the variable as a description of the dimension. Another problem is that the Time variable should only have one dimension that is Time. Your variable has a second dimension DateStrLen. This is apparently to store strings describing the time, but based  on your units the contents should be a number counting seconds.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for your reply. Yes, I am the "netCDF files generic and CF conventions" reader.
The file possesses the the variable 'Times':

variables:
        char Times(Time, DateStrLen) ;
                Times:units = "seconds since 2010-11-9 00:00:00+0:00" ;


and the Times variable is a list of datetimes (with slightly different format to the example on the CF page):
['2012-09-06_00:00:00',
 '2012-09-06_01:00:00',

Could the problem be that the dimension is named 'Time', and the variable is named 'Times'?

Jade,

We need more information before we can properly answer this question.  First, which netCDF reader are you using (there is more than one in ParaView)?  Unless your data is of a particular format, you should be using the "netCDF files generic and CF conventions".

Second, we need to know the information about the variables defined.  What variables are defined, what are their dimensions, and what are their attributes.

I am guessing that you have not properly identified the variable "Time" as a time dimension in your netCDF file (simply naming it "Time" is not sufficient in the CF convention).  To identify it as time, you also need to define a variable named "Time" of dimension "Time" and containing the property "units" that contains a string value defining some time unit (such as "seconds since 1992-10-8 15:15:42.5 -6:00".  The contents of this variable should contain the time stamp for each time slice.  See the documentation for the CF convention (http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.6/cf-conventions.html#time-coordinate) for more details.

Hi,

I am seeking advice regarding visualization of weather model output using paraview.
I am only able to view the first frame of my netcdf file. The dimensions are:

netcdf mynetcdffile {
dimensions:
        Time = UNLIMITED ; // (25 currently)
        DateStrLen = 19 ;
        west_east = 329 ;
        south_north = 329 ;
        bottom_top = 50 ;
        bottom_top_stag = 51 ;
        soil_layers_stag = 5 ;
        west_east_stag = 330 ;
        force_layers = 8 ;
        south_north_stag = 330 ;


Thanks in advance,

Jade

This is currently no supported. Looking
at vtkXMLPDataReader::CreatePieceFileName(..), the value of "Source"
attribute is always treated as a being relative to the location of the pvtu
file.

Awesome, thanks!  It was located at
  git://git.cscs.ch/ArrowGlyph.git

it may still be there, I don't know.  I have a tarball at
  http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~nooj/tacc/ArrowGlyph.gitrepo.tgz

I'm trying to push it to
  github.com/nooj/ArrowGlyph

but don't hold your breath.  i don't know how to remove the old
cscs.ch remote origin.  git makes no sense.

Gena,

The fonts issue seem to be resolved on the nightly binaries. Can you give
them a try? http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php (pick
 "Nightly" in the Version combo-box).

Sam,

I feel I should go back an elaborate a little bit. My goal is to create an
arbitrary data file that will represent a crack in a material. This crack
will be modeled as a triangular mesh with the following data defined by the
user:

Nodes (points)
Connectivities (polygons)
Crack Fronts (lines)
Node IDs (Point Data)
Cell IDs (Cell Data)
Cell Normals (Cell Data)
Crack Front Tangent, Binormal, and Normal Vectors (Line data? Point data?
not sure how I am going to be able to go about doing this just yet).

Data for any crack (rectangular, a semi-cylindrical surface, etc.)  should
be able to be placed into this skeleton of a data file and the result
should always appear as the same when opened with Paraview.

Currently I have the nodes, the connectivities, crack fronts, node IDs, and
cell IDs figured out. My question currently is how I can have the cell
normals to be defined in the data file such that I can open it in Paraview,
apply a glyph (arrow) filter and the cell normals appear. Note that each
cell normal is unique and may be in the +z- direction while the adjacent
cell may be -z-direction.

I hope this elaboration helps as I was rushed before in my description of
what I was trying to accomplish.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Best,
Dan Levitus

I've added a bug: http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=13660
It's on it's way (current in git-next).

VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF ON is not supported currently. However if someone
in the community is interested in supporting that and would like us to
integrate patches into ParaView to enable the same, we'll be more than
happy to do it.

Maybe I needed nooj at github, instead of git at github?  I thought maybe it
would work since the repo is created and public...

Now I don't know how to remove or modify the remote.  Here is my
command history:

cozumel:~/www nooj$ cd tacc/ArrowGlyph/

Cool!  My role here is to get this into the public domain so anyone
can do with it what they please.

Is my work done?  If not, what else should I do?

I believe the way to delete a remote is by name not url so it would be: git
remote rm github

Have you verified that your ssh key is working with github?

You can follow steps 4 and 5 on the github generating ssh key page(
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)  to make sure
everything is good.

I haven't.  I deleted all the id_rsa keys and the known_hosts file and
hoped it would go back to password authentication. Same problem.  Then
I tried https, and got something else I don't understand (see below).

I read the note referenced in the error message, and I don't
understand non-fast-forwards.  I want the command that says,
"Obliterate everything that is in remote, and put the local copy into
it."

Better yet, could someone look to see if there happens to be an
updated version at
  git://git.cscs.ch/ArrowGlyph.git
and if so, make it be in github.com/nooj/ArrowGlyph?  I think I made
my github repo public.

"Obliterate everything that is in remote, and put the local copy into it."

The push option that does this is force which can be enabled with -f or
--force. So you would do:
git push -f github master:master

And it works for me just fine for me on Windows too :/. Here is the exact
sequence of actions in a clean paraview

1. Create Sphere
2. Hit Apply
3. Type "s", ParaView enters selection mode (Select Cells On)
4. Click and drag in the 3D view, some cells get selected.
5. Type "s", ParaView enters selection mode again.
6. Press Ctrl and keep it pressed:
   --- With Ctrl pressed, click and drag in 3D view and few more cells will
get selected.
7. Release Ctrl only after click-and-drag operation is complete.

Alan, what was the data that you were trying to select, do you remember? I
cannot reproduce this on Windows with Sphere or disk_out_ref.

Can.ex2.  I just selected cells on the base.  Note that I was testing remote desktop, sometimes that is a factor.

Fred

I've just noticed this thread and I have the original code plus my local repo. I just looked and there are some uncommitted changes. Possibly I made some small tweaks to ensure compatibility with pv3.xx 

Tomorrow I'll check if it works with pv3.98 and push any last tweaks.

Subject: [Paraview] help with a simple script?
Message-ID: <SNT138-W2956705D3039D38826E91AD1510@phx.gbl>



Hello,

I want to write a script that would open a saved state, select one of the objects, and save data from that object as a VTI file series. I can do this with the GUI, but it takes many hours to do this to each file and I have about 60 of them, so a script would be nice since I could loop through the different states. But I can't figure out how to tell PV what I want to render, and I also can't find how to access options like "save time series".

---
from paraview.simple import *
import paraview.vtk.io as vtk_io
servermanager.LoadState("test.pvsm")
o=FindSource("Outer Mesh")               # this is the name of the Gaussian resampling filter
SetActiveSource(o)                       # it shows up if I do Show(o) so I know PV found it

writer = vtk_io.vtkXMLImageDataWriter()
writer.SetInput(o)
# TypeError: argument 1: method requires a VTK object
# how do I specify that I want o as input, and that I want to save it as a file series?

writer.SetFileName("test.vti")
writer.Write()

# delete everything, load another state, repeat
---

I would appreciate any pointers.

Use the Paraview trace feature (http://paraview.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools#Trace) in the GUI when you do it once and save that.

Then it's easy to edit the resulting script to loop over the files you need.

Subject: [Paraview] help with a simple script?



Hello,

I want to write a script that would open a saved state, select one of the objects, and save data from that object as a VTI file series. I can do this with the GUI, but it takes many hours to do this to each file and I have about 60 of them, so a script would be nice since I could loop through the different states. But I can't figure out how to tell PV what I want to render, and I also can't find how to access options like "save time series".

---
from paraview.simple import *
import paraview.vtk.io as vtk_io
servermanager.LoadState("test.pvsm")
o=FindSource("Outer Mesh")               # this is the name of the Gaussian resampling filter
SetActiveSource(o)                       # it shows up if I do Show(o) so I know PV found it

writer = vtk_io.vtkXMLImageDataWriter()
writer.SetInput(o)
# TypeError: argument 1: method requires a VTK object
# how do I specify that I want o as input, and that I want to save it as a file series?

writer.SetFileName("test.vti")
writer.Write()

# delete everything, load another state, repeat
---

I would appreciate any pointers.

Tim,
Thank you. I should've said that I tried that but it didn't work. The "regular" trace gave a bunch of errors when I tried to run it. When I did smtrace.start_trace(CaptureAllProperties=True) , that recorded more stuff, like the parameters that I used in the various filters, and it didn't give any errors when I ran it, but it also didn't save the VTI files, which is my goal.
The trace didn't include any output filenames so, apparently, the saving part doesn't get recorded. The last line in the trace is just Render(). Rendering is a part of the process when doing "Save data", at least when the object is hidden like in my pipeline, so it makes sense that it's last. But the rest of what's involved in "save data" isn't captured by the trace.
Celia

Can't check because it built with glibc 2.14 but my system (debian testing) has 
2.13:
$ ~/ParaView-3.98.0-RC2-Linux-64bit/bin/paraview
~/ParaView-3.98.0-RC2-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-3.98/paraview: /lib/x86_64-linux-
gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by ~/ParaView-3.98.0-
RC2-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-3.98/libvtkpqApplicationComponents-pv3.98.so.1)
...

Is all new versions of PV will be built with glibc 2.14?

cmake 2.8.9, the wiki says that for 3.98rc1 2.8.8+ is suitable. HDF5_DIR
is not set that's a system install in standard location (/usr).
This is what ccmake on paraview 3.98rc1 reports:

 HDF5_z_LIBRARY_RELEASE           /usr/lib64/libz.so



I understand that it is very curious since there are no such variables
as HDF5_hdf5_* in FindHDF5.cmake shipped with cmake. A grep on
paraview's sources suggest that they may originate in the superbuild:
grep -ri hdf5_hdf5 ../ParaView/*
../ParaView/SuperBuild/CMakeLists.txt:
-DHDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${HDF5_LIBRARY}
../ParaView/SuperBuild/CMakeLists.txt:
-DHDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=${HDF5_LIBRARY}
../ParaView/SuperBuild/CMakeLists.txt:
-DHDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${HDF5_HL_LIBRARY}
../ParaView/SuperBuild/CMakeLists.txt:
-DHDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=${HDF5_HL_LIBRARY})

And the relevant piece of code in SuperBuild/CMakeLists.txt is here:
# Build HDF5
list(APPEND HDF5_dependencies zlib szip)
list(APPEND ParaView_dependencies HDF5)
include(External_HDF5)
set(HDF5_ARGS
  -DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=ON
  -DHDF5_DIR:PATH=${HDF5_install}
  -DHDF5_FOUND:BOOL=ON
  -DHDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS:PATH=${HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR}
  -DHDF5_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=${HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR}
  -DHDF5_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=${HDF5_LIBRARY};${HDF5_HL_LIBRARY}
  -DHDF5_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${HDF5_LIBRARY}
  -DHDF5_HL_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${HDF5_HL_LIBRARY}
  -DHDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${HDF5_LIBRARY}
  -DHDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=${HDF5_LIBRARY}
  -DHDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${HDF5_HL_LIBRARY}
  -DHDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=${HDF5_HL_LIBRARY})

Any opinions?

Thanks you,

There's just a python warning in the output messages window but it works
perfectly.

Hi Eddy,

what do you mean by "There's just a python warning in the output messages

What have you done ?

Hi Celia,

if you use the vtkWriter directly without using a proxy you will need to do:

writer.SetInput(o.GetClientSideObject())

But the better way to do that is by following

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Writing_Data_Files_.28ParaView_3.9_or_later.29

And maybe, you might be interested in looking at some other examples here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_recipes

Hope that helps,

Seb

It's current stable, 3.14.1 64-bit
The options I get are;
- ParaDIS Files
- ParaDIS Tecplot Files
- TFT Files

but if it works like you said with the next version I'm perfectly fine with 
that :-)

I mean that I can't find option 'Specify the Axis Range' in the View Settings of 
Line Chart View. I see this option in 3.12.0 and 3.14.1 versions but not in the 
new one.

Subject: [Paraview] How to save the transparency function for volume
 rendering in Paraview 3.14.1?
Message-ID: <3fa56004.22796.13b096051f4.Coremail.weaponfire2005@163.com>

Hi all :
   I used ParaView to volume rendering an image volume data. I found that the "save" button in the "Edit color map" dialog box only save the color value of the transfer function, when reload the function item I saved, the tran transparency function was missed. Is there any way to save both the color and transparency function?
  Thanks very much for your help.

Is the omission of pressing/releasing the Ctrl key in your procedure an
oversight or intentional? Also, can you try with Sphere source -- exactly
how I described. If that works and something else doesn't, at least we'll
have a starting point. Right now, I have not been able to reproduce the
Ctrl key problem (the steps you describe of course fail since I never press
the Ctrl key), nor has anyone who responded to this thread (let's ignore
the 'call not supported' problem, that's a separate one and I will track
that down).

Hi Seb,

The line :

from vtkFiltersCorePython import *

leads to this warning on the output messages window :

<string>:1: SyntaxWarning: import * only allowed at module level

Ah ok,

I was referring to that line inside the ${PV_SRC}/Wrapping/Python/
paraview/vtk/__init__.py

Sorry for the confusion,

Subject: [Paraview] Show custom cube axes annotations
Message-ID: <50A65579.6020609@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi,

I am trying  to understand how the new annotation for the cube axis works.

I don't understand how to define the OrientedBoundingBox FieldData 
variable. (I understand the c++ part, that's easy ;) )
(I'm working with a c++ reader plugin).

What is the relation between the Oriented Bound and the scale and the 
position of the axis.


     Thanks

     Felipe

     

     ps: Paraview 3.98.0-RC2 git version, kubuntu 12.04 64.

I think FindHDF5.cmake needs to be cleaned up. There are occassions
when HDF5_HL_LIBRARY
gets defined  and other occasions when HDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY gets defined.
That's confusing to say the least. I am going to check with the Cmake folks
here and try to figure out what's the right approach.

In the meantime, if simply using HDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY works for you, I can
update the if() block to test for both HDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY or HDF5_HL_LIBRARY.
Does that sound reasonable?

Seb,

Yes! Thank you so much! I thought I'd looked at that wiki page forever, but apparently not enough since I missed that part.

I've another question. I can run everything from the Python shell from the Paraview GUI fine, but if I do the same thing from pvpython, I get lots of errors. (I want to use pvpython so I can Disconnect() after I'm done with a state to get rid of all the stuff, instead of deleting the objects one at a time. Unless there's a reset command that I'm missing?) For example:

from paraview import servermanager
from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.LoadState("test.pvsm")
view = GetActiveView()
view.ViewTime

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'ViewTime'

I don't know if it's not finding the state file and keeping quiet (though I actually used an absolute path when doing this, both from Python shell in PV and from pvpython, so I don't know why) or if it's something else. Thank you,

Celia

Ah! Alas, that's not supported currently. Feel free to add a feature
request to the bug-tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug) and we will try to
address it in the future.

Hi Felipe,

if you check "Use Custom Range" the cube axis will use the oriented bounds
correctly for the labels instead of using the world space coordinate bounds.
This happen by adding new field data providing the min/max for each axis
that should be used for the labels.

Regarding you question the end points of the cube axes will be

Pmin = U*OrientedBounds[0] + V*OrientedBouds[2] + W*OrientedBouds[4]
...
Pmax = U*OrientedBounds[1] + V*OrientedBouds[3] + W*OrientedBouds[5]

Hope that help,

Seb

Oops,

the "Use Custom Range" will use the text field property but this will add
extra information so when you use the QuadView, the QuadView will be able
to know what the slices origin is regarding those arbitrary bounds.

Hope that makes a little bit more sense,

Seb

At long last I can reproduce this issue (yippie!). I'll track it down and
have it fixed.

I've pushed a fix for this. It will be included in the next release
candidate.

I have no problem with the use custom range.

My problem is than I use a home made transform filter to transform my 
data, our data is sometimes degenerated (one axis is very very small), 
so we use the transform filter to increase the size of that dimensions. 
But the problems is that the cube axes does not have the good units any 
more ( so we want to keep the labels of the input by applying the same 
transform)

Until now I can apply only translation and scale, not rotation.

note: in the images the little arrow is the original one.

Thank you. That worked but I still have problems: as soon as the OpenGL window opens to render, it freezes, even if all the objects are hidden. I think I'll have to do it from the Python shell from PV instead. I have just one more question.

When I load a state using LoadState(), that automatically opens a new layout window. If I open the same state file from the GUI, no new window is opened, so I don't think it's a property stored in the state file. If I'm going to loop through 60 state files, I imagine all these windows would become a problem. How do I either close the window, or prevent it from opening in the first place?

Celia

Hi Celia,

I'm not sure to follow what you mean by "it freezes" and "new layout
window".

When you render something from Python, the window is not interactive, so
maybe that's what you call freeze. And you need to manually call Render()
to update its content.
Regarding the layout window, I don't really have a clue what that could be.

So I let you explain a bit more.

Thanks,

Seb

Seb,

When I say that the OpenGL window freezes, I mean the window is unresponsive in that I can't minimize it, and Windows task manager says "Not Responding". There's nothing in the window except for the purple background, even when there should be something, e.g. if I did Show(o) before calling Render(), where o is one of the pipeline objects.

The thing I called layout windows, and I suppose it's really called something else (view layouts?), happens when I run the script from the Python shell that comes with the GUI. I'm referring to the tabs, "Layout #1", "Layout #2", etc. Here:

>>> paraview version 3.14.1, Date: 2012-02-17
from paraview.simple import *
>>> GetLayouts()
{('ViewLayout1', '275'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000010FB4748>}
>>> servermanager.LoadState("testpipeline.pvsm")
>>> GetLayouts()
{('ViewLayout1', '275'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000010FB4748>, ('ViewLayout5', '2353'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000010FB47B8>}
>>> servermanager.LoadState("testpipeline.pvsm")
>>> GetLayouts()
{('ViewLayout1', '275'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000010FB4748>, ('ViewLayout5', '3972'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000012EC3240>, ('ViewLayout5', '2353'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000010FB47B8>}

This happens even if I use an empty state file, i.e. what I get when I open Paraview GUI, save state, save as empty.pvsm. If I load this state from the GUI, it opens in the original layout window, ViewLayout1, without any craziness. If I open it from the shell as above, the first tab splits into 2 views, the right view looks all weird (attached), a new tab opens and the state file is loaded into a second tab. If I load the state file again, then the second tab splits like the first (and if there was any content, it stays on the left hand side), a third tab opens, and the content shows up in the third tab. And so on. The names of these new tabs depend on the state file (above: 1 5 5, it might be 3 1 3 3, or if I use an empty state file, then it's 1 1 1 1), so I don't know what's the deal with that, but as long as I can close them before moving on to the next state file, I don't think it'll cause problems.

Ok,

My idea is simple (http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13583).
We visualizes data with non convectional axes, so we put that  
information (name and units) in the labels. Also we want to be able to  
use the transformation filter to modified the meshes, and we want the  
axis and labels to follow the transformation. So I'm writing a filter  
(vtkTransformWithAxis) that apply the transform to the mesh and to all  
the data that is used for the cube axis.

But I'm not able create correctly the OrientedBoundingBox and the  
three vectors to generate the Non Orthogonal Bounding Box.

So if the input does not have all the data for the axis, it will  
generate the data (vector, OriendedBoundigBox... and so on ) , and  
then apply the transformation filter.

Is that clearer?

Thanks for you time so far.
Felipe

Hi Felipe,

Lets state what we know.
U,V and W are 3 unit vectors that describe which axis should be used by the
cube axis.
OrientedBounds are 6 values describing the bounds of the data using the U,V
and W vectors. [minU, maxU, minV, maxV, minW, maxW]

Then to solve your problem you will have to do the following:

1) Compute Pmin and Pmax as follow

Pmin = U.OrientedBounds[0] + V.OrientedBouds[2] + W.OrientedBouds[4]
Pmax = U.OrientedBounds[1] + V.OrientedBouds[3] + W.OrientedBouds[5]

2) Apply your transform (Rotation, Scale, Translation) to those 2 points

You get P'min and P'max

3) Apply the rotation ONLY to U,V and W (as translation/scale have no
effect on a unit vector)

You get U', V' and W'

4) You resolve the equations

P'min = U'.a + V'.b + W'.c
P'max = U'.d + V'.e + W'.f

And then you get OrientedBounds' = [a,d,b,e,c,f]

And you're done... Do you need anything more ?

Dear ParaView developers,

I just downloaded PV-3.98-RC-Linux-64bit (binary version) and unpacked on OpenSUSE-12.2 64 bit OS.? When I ran paraview, I got the following error:

hsieh at tainan:~/paraview/ParaView-3.98.0-RC1-Linux-64bit/bin> ./paraview
ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/GUISupport/Qt/vtkEventQtSlotConnect.cxx, line 68

Segmentation fault
hsieh at tainan:~/paraview/ParaView-3.98.0-RC1-Linux-64bit/bin>
--------------------------------------------------

Any suggestion?
I think that my QT version is 4.8.1.? Could this be the issue?

Best Regards,

Pei-Ying

Great!
I will wait fort he next release candidate then...

For the records:
The omission of the ctrl key was an oversight, item 6 should read:
6. Press and hold down Ctrl key, click and drag to select more points, release Ctrl key.

BTW, how do I get the sphere source?

Thank you for your help,

Matthias

The same happens when I select cells instead of points.

And it works for me just fine for me on Windows too :/. Here is the exact sequence of actions in a clean paraview

1. Create Sphere
2. Hit Apply
3. Type "s", ParaView enters selection mode (Select Cells On)
4. Click and drag in the 3D view, some cells get selected.
5. Type "s", ParaView enters selection mode again.
6. Press Ctrl and keep it pressed:
   --- With Ctrl pressed, click and drag in 3D view and few more cells will get selected.
7. Release Ctrl only after click-and-drag operation is complete.

Utkarsh,
I tried this on Linux, and it works fine.
I tried this windows (master pull from about last Friday, November 10), and it does not work.  Not sure if it is related, but my debug build outputs the following warning:

Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\..\..\src\ParaView3\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 408
Call not supported for the current property type.

Matthias, if you have not already, please write this up as a bug.

This seems to work for me on Linux and Mac (the only platforms I could test on as I am travelling). Have you tried these on anything other than Windows? I wonder if it's a Windows only problem. I will test on Windows once I get back later this week.

Hi,

in the new binary (3.98.0-RC1, Windows 32 bit), I still cannot add points to the current selection by holding the ctrl key (bug 0013056). Is there a workaround or fix in sight? I use this feature frequently, so I will have to stick with 3.12.0-RC2 until this is fixed (it doesn't work in 3.14 either).

Hi All,

I have a query as mentioned below. I would like to know whether this is 
feasible, if yes, can I get some sample code example. Any inputs in this 
regard are highly appreciated.

The requirement is as follows -

 1. There is a PyQT based application.
 2. The Paraview window is embedded within the QT widget as shown in
    attached image. Note - the attached image is just an illustration,
    not from the actual app
      * This is something similar to embedding activex control
 3. The user inputs are collected through user interface and STL file is
    opened in Paraview viewer programmatically.
 4. User can perform certain activities with STL file within Paraview
    viewer that are supported by Paraview i.e. pan, zoom etc.
 5. The application can perform certain tasks programmatically using
    Paraview functions -
      * Set the location of STL file and the position of STL object is
        updated in viewer
      * Query the position or transformation of objects displayed
      * Handle events generated by Paraview i.e. create slots for
        signals from Paraview
 6. If user selects some objects in Paraview viewer, application should
    be able to detect the selection and get the selection list
 7. In general, the activities that user can perform interactively with
    Paraview, whether same can be done programmatically via PyQT
    application that embeds Paraview? Upto what extent?


Regards,

Indrajit

Subject: [Paraview] (Ordered) Compositing question.
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD2145099081D65F8@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

I have geometry distributed into parallel pieces such that they are non overlapping and therefore compositing should only need to use a back to front sort last frame buffer operation with no redistribution of geometry.

I'm worried that when I turn on transparency, paraview will try to redistribute my data, even though I have already partitioned it nicely for this. I'd like to use ordered sort last compositing at the top level, and use DepthSortPolyData on each node (no depth peeling for now) to ensure I get a true image. What isn't clear to me is if I "disable ordered compositing" if this disables the transfer of geometry AND also disables the ordered compositing necessary for correct transparent blending (I may be confused here about the blend modes used or the term "ordered compositing" as used in the docs).

Is there written down anywhere a complete description of the pipelines used by the various rendering modes so that I can be sure the pipeline is doing what I want. I can create a custom representation which does what I want, but it'll take time and if the existing mechanism support it, I shouldn't need to.

Also, I specifically want to use a transparent lookuptable, does the newer paraview 3.98 have anything to support this. I thought I'd seen a thread about this recently, but cannot find it now.

In summary : For the rendering, I'd like Ordered sort-last compositing, no geometry redistribution, Depth sort of polygons on each node. Transparent lookup table.

What settings should I use :)

Thanks

Hello Utkarsh,

thank you for your reply! So far in only installed shared libs and 
copied headers manually by a bash script, which also worked. But i will 
use the proper mechanism now! Thank you very much!

Subject: [Paraview] Setting the colour/scale palete used for glyphs
Message-ID: <CA+sJ3g5kYwEbsk=f4GyKCU_oEfh8xuEt5THGzfTHz6HnYintNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to write a custom filter  that produces coloured glyphs based
on tensor orientations. Actually colouring the glyphs proved quite easy, I
just added a scalar field  to the points defining the glyph surface.

Now I would like to ensure that field is coloured (by default) using a
specific colour palette. More specifically I want to it to use 2 discrete
colours, rather than the rainbow scale. Is this possible?

Any pointers would be gratefully appreciated.

You can create the sphere source, by selecting "Sphere" from the "Sources"
menu.

You are correct in that if you disable ordered composite it will disabled the distribution and the composite ordering. The problem is that the geometry distribution also creates a k-d tree structure that the compositing uses to determine the visibility order. So it would not be sufficient to simply have geometry that is in non-overlapping pieces. You would also have to provide some meta-structure that could be used to determine an appropriate ordering given a viewpoint. Even if you had that, there is no mechanism to feed that to the compositor in the view. I can't think of any way of doing that that would not be a huge hack.

As far as I know, there is no support for the DepthSortPolyData filter. You would probably have to create a custom representation to support that.

I believe the transparent lookup table for poly data is supported in 3.98, but to be honest I have not yet tried it.

There is fix to be included in next release candidate that could
potentially address this problem (we are seeing segfaults on some linux
platforms during initialization). I'd suggest waiting for the next release
candidate and giving it a try. I don't think it has anything to do with
your installed Qt since ParaView binary packages it's own Qt.

Thanks Ken,

My suspicions are confirmed. I had a poke around with the ordered compositing code (vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor et al) and saw that the BSP cuts from the D3 filter are set to match those from the PKDTree internally. I notice that in the BSPcuts code it says
  // Description:
  //   Initialize the cuts with arrays of information.  This type of
  //   information would be obtained from a graph partitioning software
  //   package like Zoltan.

Do you know if there exists such an example. I am infact partitioning the data using Zoltan and have the exact bounds etc of the partitions, so I can work out what to pass into the BSPcuts  class and could potentially fool the IceT composiining into using my partitions. Can you point me to any crucial function that I must call. Is it sufficient to do a SetCuts on the compositing code - which class do I need to take control of?).

I shall create a custom representation to handle the depth sort. I've done the same some time ago for the point sprite renderer so I'll manage that ok, but I'll need to override the IceT compositing pass too as alluded to above , so any pointers welcome. (Could I somehow subclass on of the painters for the IceT pass and set the cuts to what I've got, then proceed as usual?)

You are correct in that if you disable ordered composite it will disabled the distribution and the composite ordering. The problem is that the geometry distribution also creates a k-d tree structure that the compositing uses to determine the visibility order. So it would not be sufficient to simply have geometry that is in non-overlapping pieces. You would also have to provide some meta-structure that could be used to determine an appropriate ordering given a viewpoint. Even if you had that, there is no mechanism to feed that to the compositor in the view. I can't think of any way of doing that that would not be a huge hack.

As far as I know, there is no support for the DepthSortPolyData filter. You would probably have to create a custom representation to support that.

I believe the transparent lookup table for poly data is supported in 3.98, but to be honest I have not yet tried it.

Also, I specifically want to use a transparent lookuptable, does the newer paraview 3.98 have anything to support this. I thought I'd seen a thread about this recently, but cannot find it now.

In summary : For the rendering, I'd like Ordered sort-last compositing, no geometry redistribution, Depth sort of polygons on each node. Transparent lookup table.

What settings should I use :)

John,

Look at vtkStructuredGridVolumeRepresentation, It passes a
 "ExtentTranslator" to the view. The view uses the extent translator to
build the KdTree. That's one of specifying the cuts. You can indeed provide
a custom extent translator or if need be, that API can be extended to pass
some other data-structure to extract the relevant information for ordered
compositing.

For using opacity with polygonal data, simply go to the lookup table editor
dialog and (in the advanced mode) you'll see a checkbox to "Enable Opacity
Function". Check that and you can specify the opacity function.

You can indeed provide a custom extent translator or if need be, that API can be extended to pass some other data-structure to extract the relevant information for ordered compositing.

That's magic - thanks. I shall see if I can work out how to fudge that for my purposes.

And ...
For using opacity with polygonal data, simply go to the lookup table editor dialog and (in the advanced mode) you'll see a checkbox to "Enable Opacity Function". Check that and you can specify the opacity function.

OK, I actually wanted to apply a (user defined, but at compile time probably) function to the scalars and use that as a per vertex opacity (It will be an equation relating multiple scalar fields together). I'll repurpose some more code from the point sprite plugin as it does something a bit like that with the transfer function stuff. I guess that's actually what the new lookup table code is doing internally with the opacity feature, just mapping it through the LUT rather than a user function. I think when Stephane implemented that part of the point sprite stuff he used a 1D transfer function for the opacity mapping. I'll  sort that out. The hard part will be fooling the composiing methinks.

Thanks to both of you. I'll have more questions later ...

Perfect,

Thanks very much for all the help, I finally succeeded to create the

keep the originals labels.

Jalel,

Ensure that your "Remote Rendering Threshold" is checked and set to 0. The
Remote Rendering Threshold can be accessed from the "Edit |Settings" Dialog
on the Render View | Server page.

Subject: [Paraview] Particle tracer
Message-ID: <CANECNoHOfQqcs7_A0TmpCHxA8PnH8oOBeyKG+bi4H=KKuQj_pg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have found this thread after I tried unsuccessfully to trace pathlines
from a list of vti files using paraview 3.98.0-RC1-2-ge3fcf70 64-bit on
Linux.

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-April/024587.html

I execute the following steps:
1. add the temporal, regular dataset (list of vti files)
2. add a line source for seeds
3. add a ParticleTracer filter with input my regular vector data and seeds
generated by the line.

I only see the starting points, no tracing occurs.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Dan

Hi Felipe,

if you are willing to contribute your changes to VTK and the transform
filter, I'd be pleased to integrate them.

Thanks,

Seb

PS: You can send me a formatted patch if you want.

Not sure what's going on. Is this image with stereo enabled? Can you share
the dataset or reproduce the problem with something already in ParaVIewData
or some ParaView source?

Hi Celia,

I think you found a bug, but I think I have something for you.
The following method should clear the view/layouts.

Seb

$ def clearLayout():
... pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()

... for layout in GetLayouts():

...   pxm.UnRegisterProxy("layouts", layout[0], GetLayouts()[layout])

Yuanxin,
Thanks for your reply,
When I press play, the particles seem to stay in the same place.  However,
they do change color as they are colored by velocity magnitude. Maybe the
velocity is very small and the particles don't move much - I trace only 43
time steps. I will try to trace the particles in an region of higher
velocity tomorrow (is night here in UK). Do I need to apply another filter
to get a pathline?

Thank you,
Dan

You may want to check out the information tab in the gui to see how many
points and cells there are as the particle tracer iterates through the time
series. By default I believe the vti files will assume a time step of 1
between files, which may not be appropriate for your velocity field and
domain size.

Yes. Please try to put the source at the high velocity region.  You can
also use the calculator filter to increase the velocity.

Unlike the previous ParaView,  you don't attach another filter after
ParticleTracer to get path lines/streak lines.  Just use ParticlePath filter
 / StreakLine filter.  You can find a summary these features on page of 11
the Kitware Source July
issue<http://www.kitware.com/media/thesource/jul2012.html>.



Leo

 have recently made a number of changes to the particle tracing.  You can
find a summary on page of 11 the Kitware Source July
issue<http://www.kitware.com/media/thesource/jul2012.html>

I'd suggest waiting for the next release candidate and giving it a try. I don't think it has anything to do with your installed Qt since ParaView binary packages it's own Qt.

Hi Kit,

You can set the number of colors in the lookup table by
+ clicking on the color scale editor button in the toolbar,
+ ensuring that the "Use Discrete Colors" checkbox is ON, and
+ changing the "Resolution" slider to 2.

As long as the field values are uniformly spaced, you can handle more than 2 colors by changing the resolution appropriately (but note that you may wish to use the "Rescale Range" button to keep color band edges from falling on special values).

Thanks David,  ideally I'd like to have something in the plugin so that 
when the user applies the filter and the default display is the 2 color 
option for this object. Rather than them having to go through a series 
of clicks on the GUI inorder to get to the discrete color pallete.

The field values are just +1 and -1, and I would like them to be plotted 
as either black or white accordingly by default.

Leo,
Thanks for the suggestion with the calculator filter. I was able to use it
to increase the velocity and see the particles moving as they should
(ParticleTracer).
Just a small note here, I see an warning when I use the First Frame (0)
button. The warning does not seem to have any ill effects however.


Warning: In
/home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Filters/FlowPaths/vtkParticleTracerBase.cxx,
line 1372

vtkPParticleTracer (0x6a93c50): Can't go backward



I still had no luck with the ParticlePath filter. I follow the same steps
as for the ParticleTracer but the Information box shows me 'Number of
Cells': 0 and 'Number of Points': 7 and no points or traces are displayed.
Do you have any suggestions on what might be wrong with the ParticlePath
filter.

For the StreakLine filter the number of cells is 7 and number of points is
7 which seems correct. However no tracing of streaklines happens either.
Paraview goes very fast through the time steps when I press the Play button
(the same as for the ParticlePath filter). Do you have any suggestions for
the StreakLine filter?

Andy,
Thanks for your reply. For ParticleTracer there are 7 cells and 7 points
which is correct. My problem was that the velocity was too small so the
particles were moved a very small distance. Using a Calculator filter to
increase the velocity (using Leo Liu suggestion) allowed me to see the
particles moved by the filter.

ParticlePath and StreakLine still don't work for me (see my other email to
the list). Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Dan

Utkarsh,

Depth sort painter representation working ok .... But

For my first simple implementation I'll use a D3 filter inside my other source so data is partitioned using the standard filters - and I can access the BSP cuts etc. Can I pass these cuts down the pipeline as some kind of attached information object and then in the ProcessViewRequest of the representation get them and pass them into the compositor. Using the D3 Cuts might be easier than my Zoltan based bounding boxes and for version 1, this'll do.

I'm looking at the code now, and can see that vtkOrderedCompositingInfo expects wholeextents and other stuff about spacing etc. I suppose I should simply invent these numbers based on my whole bounding box and the relative offsets of the individual boxes. Seems a shame to go from the BSP cuts to extents, presumably so that the compositor can then do the reverse. Is this where you said the interface can be improved? (meaning I can pass the bounds directly and bypass the structured-extents ...)

Ta

John,

Look at vtkStructuredGridVolumeRepresentation, It passes a  "ExtentTranslator" to the view. The view uses the extent translator to build the KdTree. That's one of specifying the cuts. You can indeed provide a custom extent translator or if need be, that API can be extended to pass some other data-structure to extract the relevant information for ordered compositing.

For using opacity with polygonal data, simply go to the lookup table editor dialog and (in the advanced mode) you'll see a checkbox to "Enable Opacity Function". Check that and you can specify the opacity function.

Thanks Ken,

My suspicions are confirmed. I had a poke around with the ordered compositing code (vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor et al) and saw that the BSP cuts from the D3 filter are set to match those from the PKDTree internally. I notice that in the BSPcuts code it says
  // Description:
  //   Initialize the cuts with arrays of information.  This type of
  //   information would be obtained from a graph partitioning software
  //   package like Zoltan.

Do you know if there exists such an example. I am infact partitioning the data using Zoltan and have the exact bounds etc of the partitions, so I can work out what to pass into the BSPcuts  class and could potentially fool the IceT composiining into using my partitions. Can you point me to any crucial function that I must call. Is it sufficient to do a SetCuts on the compositing code - which class do I need to take control of?).

I shall create a custom representation to handle the depth sort. I've done the same some time ago for the point sprite renderer so I'll manage that ok, but I'll need to override the IceT compositing pass too as alluded to above , so any pointers welcome. (Could I somehow subclass on of the painters for the IceT pass and set the cuts to what I've got, then proceed as usual?)

Thanks

Subject: Re: [Paraview-developers] (Ordered) Compositing question.

You are correct in that if you disable ordered composite it will disabled the distribution and the composite ordering. The problem is that the geometry distribution also creates a k-d tree structure that the compositing uses to determine the visibility order. So it would not be sufficient to simply have geometry that is in non-overlapping pieces. You would also have to provide some meta-structure that could be used to determine an appropriate ordering given a viewpoint. Even if you had that, there is no mechanism to feed that to the compositor in the view. I can't think of any way of doing that that would not be a huge hack.

As far as I know, there is no support for the DepthSortPolyData filter. You would probably have to create a custom representation to support that.

I believe the transparent lookup table for poly data is supported in 3.98, but to be honest I have not yet tried it.

I have geometry distributed into parallel pieces such that they are non overlapping and therefore compositing should only need to use a back to front sort last frame buffer operation with no redistribution of geometry.

I'm worried that when I turn on transparency, paraview will try to redistribute my data, even though I have already partitioned it nicely for this. I'd like to use ordered sort last compositing at the top level, and use DepthSortPolyData on each node (no depth peeling for now) to ensure I get a true image. What isn't clear to me is if I "disable ordered compositing" if this disables the transfer of geometry AND also disables the ordered compositing necessary for correct transparent blending (I may be confused here about the blend modes used or the term "ordered compositing" as used in the docs).

Is there written down anywhere a complete description of the pipelines used by the various rendering modes so that I can be sure the pipeline is doing what I want. I can create a custom representation which does what I want, but it'll take time and if the existing mechanism support it, I shouldn't need to.

Also, I specifically want to use a transparent lookuptable, does the newer paraview 3.98 have anything to support this. I thought I'd seen a thread about this recently, but cannot find it now.

In summary : For the rendering, I'd like Ordered sort-last compositing, no geometry redistribution, Depth sort of polygons on each node. Transparent lookup table.

What settings should I use :)

Thanks

In-Reply-To: <50AB451C.4040204@googlemail.com>
Message-ID: <F4420EF66C9C2E459F82C436DABE2F0E3005BF84@EXMB02.srn.sandia.gov>

Under certain circumstances ParaView will treat a vector field as colors.
Specifically, IF the field is of type unsigned char with 3 or 4 components
AND IF the field is set as the scalars in the data set, then the values in
that field will be treated directly as colors rather than interpolated in
a color map.(What actually happens is that in this circumstance, ParaView
will turn off the "Map Scalars" display parameter.)


So, I don't think there is any way for your filter to force or suggest a
color map for its scalar values. However, if you instead directly create
the colors you want in the filter, store them in a vtkUnsignedCharArray of
3 or 4 components, then add that array to your data set using SetScalars,
you should get the desired result.

Here is a quick Python script that can be executed in the Programmable
Filter that I wrote up to demonstrate how to do this.  (Try applying it to
the output from the Box source.)


input = self.GetPolyDataInput()
output = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

output.ShallowCopy(input)
numPoints = output.GetNumberOfPoints()

colors = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
colors.SetName("Colors")
colors.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
colors.SetNumberOfTuples(numPoints)

for pointIndex in range(0, numPoints):
    coord = output.GetPoint(pointIndex)
    r = 255 * (coord[0] + 0.5)
    g = 255 * (coord[1] + 0.5)
    b = 255 * (coord[2] + 0.5)
    colors.SetTuple3(pointIndex, r, g, b)

Leo,
Thank you very much. That was the problem.

I am also very happy to see that vtkParticleTracer, vtkParticlePathFilter
and vtkStreaklineFilter now have tests in the nightly build (it was not the
case for
vtkTemporalPathLineFilter in VTK 5.10 release).

Thank you very much for your answers and for the improvements in streamline
tracing.

Best,
Dan

Seb,
Thank you. I'm still having problems. Here's what happens.
If I tack this code on to the end of my script (I didn't make it a function, so just the last 3 lines with the proper indentation), Paraview crashes once it gets to the code. An OpenGL window pops up and nothing's there (it's black), and then Windows says "paraview.exe stopped working".
In the shell - well, I don't actually get to that point in the shell because I can't get to the first (or second, etc) layout in the array from GetLayouts() this way.
>>> paraview version 3.14.1, Date: 2012-02-17
from paraview.simple import *
>>> servermanager.LoadState("empty.pvsm")
>>> layouts=GetLayouts()
>>> print layouts
{('ViewLayout1', '2178'): , ('ViewLayout1', '275'): }
>>> layout=layouts[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
KeyError: 0
So I thought maybe it should be GetLayouts.Values() since that can be indexed (I tried it in the shell). I changed the script to read "for layout in GetLayouts().values():". PV didn't crash but I got "TypeError: 'ViewLayout' object does not support indexing". This has to do with the arguments to UnRegisterProxy() - but I don't know what to do next because I don't know how to read the documentation at this point. (And I don't know what to google, so if anyone has suggestions...?) E.g. it says the syntax is UnRegisterProxy(self, groupname, proxyname, aProxy), but there are only 3 arguments here - pxm.UnRegisterProxy("layouts", layout[0], GetLayouts()[layout]). I also tried Delete(layout) but I got unregistration error.
Celia

Hi Celia,

The weird thing is that you don't have any object in your layout.

{('ViewLayout1', '2178'): >>>HERE<<< , ('ViewLayout1', '275'): >>>HERE<<< }

This create the issue that you are seeing. Although, what you/we try to
solve might not be the real issue.
So I don't really know what is going on when you load your state on your
machine.

Seb

Hi all,


We're testing ParaView 3.98.0 for weeks
and we found no PointSplite Plugin on this version.

Where is it?
Or we can't use it any longer?

PointSprite plugin has issues when VisItBridge is enabled hence it's not
built in that case. You can rebuild ParaView from source without
VisIt-bridge  and the plugin should be available.

Yes, you are right. I succeeded using a new file with a Time variable that
takes only the Time dimension, includes an appropriate units attribute, and
was assigned with an array of doubles:
netcdf new_netcdf_file {
dimensions:
        DateStrLen = 19 ;
        Time = 25 ;
        south_north = 519 ;
        force_layers = 8 ;
        west_east_stag = 424 ;
        bottom_top_stag = 51 ;
        soil_layers_stag = 5 ;
        bottom_top = 50 ;
        west_east = 423 ;
        south_north_stag = 520 ;
variables:
        float T(Time, bottom_top, south_north, west_east) ;
                T:units = "K" ;
        double Time(Time) ;
                Time:units = "seconds since my last coffee" ;
}

Thanks, jade

Seb,

I didn't even notice that. I tried it again, and this time, there's an object, but the end result is the same.

>>> paraview version 3.14.1, Date: 2012-02-17
from paraview.simple import *
>>> servermanager.LoadState("empty.pvsm")
>>> GetLayouts()
{('ViewLayout1', '2178'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x00000000103938D0>, ('ViewLayout1', '275'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000010EE2668>}
>>> layouts=GetLayouts()
>>> print layouts
{('ViewLayout1', '2178'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x00000000103938D0>, ('ViewLayout1', '275'): <paraview.servermanager.ViewLayout object at 0x0000000010EE2668>}
>>> layout=layouts[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 0

And the same problem when I do it with a script with the for loop, "TypeError: 'ViewLayout' object does not support indexing".

Whether this is or isn't a real issue, I suppose you're talking about the extra layout tab that opens when I load a state? Does this mean that you can't replicate it? I tried it on another machine (it = making an empty state file on that machine and then loading it from the shell) and I got exactly the same behavior, the same extra tab and all.

Celia

I've pushed a new branch to:
  https://github.com/demarle/ParaViewAutoBuild.git
with updates to build paraview 3.14.1 on a bluegene P with the xlc compilers

My todo list includes:
1) incorporate the patches that Bruce kindly provided for bluegene Q.
2) meld the cross compilation that ParaViewAutoBuild does with the
modern SuperBuild that we use to make ParaView binaries.
3) setup a dashboard so that we exercise it always

I expect that will be done in time for 4.0 but do not expect it done
in time for 3.98 final.

Thanks!  Any thoughts on when 4.0 might be available?  I know it's a guess, but would it be like 6 months? 
Thank you

No, you can't embed the ParaView GUI inside a PyQt application in that
manner.  But, you could extend the ParaView GUI using PyQt if you generate
SIP bindings fo  the classes in the ParaView/Qt source directory.  I'm not
sure if that has ever been done before.  You can embed objects from the
ParaView ServerManager & VTK libraries, but not the ParaView GUI classes.
The VTK source code contains PyQt4 examples.

Doesn't seem to be working as expected yet. I have found some problems which I'll mention here for general reference.


1)      Setting the ExtentTranslator using the function
vtkPVRenderView::SetOrderedCompositingInformation(inInfo, this, input_bet, whole_extent, origin, spacing); doesn't stop the Redistribution from taking place. I'm still debugging this, but perhaps the pipeline somehow knows that this is not a structured dataset and ignores the information during one phases of the DataDelivery pipeline. (NB. input_bet is bounds extent translator - I'm using my vtkBoundsExtentTranslator but it inherits from the standard ExtentTranslator)


2)      I know that 1) isn't quite true because I can see that the KdTree is being constructed from the extents I supply for each bounding region. There is a nasty bug in here which is that for an unstructured grid, boundary cells are uniquely assigned to each process and this means that the bounding boxes will  slightly overlap as a cell on one process may overlap bounds with another process. This causes the KdTree construction to abort with an error. I can fix this by shrinking the bounds (extents) I pass to the KdTree but this in turn causes some parts of the screen to be not rendered. I haven't quite solved what's going on here. By screen I really mean data, there are empty regions between the data corresponding to the shrunken extents I've used. Seems very odd because the Compositor only needs to know which order to composite. Suspect that IceT is using the bounds to generate regions internally to composite and blanking out the bits it thinks are 'invisible'. Need to find a hack to fix this (IceT option anywhere?). Even though the extents are being used, I don't yet understand why the redistribution is taking place anyway.

3)      Lock Interactive render option does not work, (I'm using 3.98 from last week), used to be able to interact and change rotation several times then after 2 seconds it would do a still render. Not any more. (I'm using 12 core Windows machine for my  debuging).

4)      Changing any options in window setting causes entire rendering pipeline to reexecute.

Utkarsh,

Depth sort painter representation working ok .... But

For my first simple implementation I'll use a D3 filter inside my other source so data is partitioned using the standard filters - and I can access the BSP cuts etc. Can I pass these cuts down the pipeline as some kind of attached information object and then in the ProcessViewRequest of the representation get them and pass them into the compositor. Using the D3 Cuts might be easier than my Zoltan based bounding boxes and for version 1, this'll do.

I'm looking at the code now, and can see that vtkOrderedCompositingInfo expects wholeextents and other stuff about spacing etc. I suppose I should simply invent these numbers based on my whole bounding box and the relative offsets of the individual boxes. Seems a shame to go from the BSP cuts to extents, presumably so that the compositor can then do the reverse. Is this where you said the interface can be improved? (meaning I can pass the bounds directly and bypass the structured-extents ...)

John,

Look at vtkStructuredGridVolumeRepresentation, It passes a  "ExtentTranslator" to the view. The view uses the extent translator to build the KdTree. That's one of specifying the cuts. You can indeed provide a custom extent translator or if need be, that API can be extended to pass some other data-structure to extract the relevant information for ordered compositing.

For using opacity with polygonal data, simply go to the lookup table editor dialog and (in the advanced mode) you'll see a checkbox to "Enable Opacity Function". Check that and you can specify the opacity function.

You are correct in that if you disable ordered composite it will disabled the distribution and the composite ordering. The problem is that the geometry distribution also creates a k-d tree structure that the compositing uses to determine the visibility order. So it would not be sufficient to simply have geometry that is in non-overlapping pieces. You would also have to provide some meta-structure that could be used to determine an appropriate ordering given a viewpoint. Even if you had that, there is no mechanism to feed that to the compositor in the view. I can't think of any way of doing that that would not be a huge hack.

As far as I know, there is no support for the DepthSortPolyData filter. You would probably have to create a custom representation to support that.

I believe the transparent lookup table for poly data is supported in 3.98, but to be honest I have not yet tried it.

1)      Solved by setting
    redistributor->SetPassThrough(item.OrderedCompositingInfo.Translator!=NULL);
So we pass through the data if the translator has been set. This fixes the blank regions which must have been caused by the D3 filter simply dropping cells in the regions which were shrunk, not by IceT as I guessed previously.

Now the redistribution takes place, but the pass through means the time is 0.01s. I'm happy with that. Using the shrunken bounding boxes solves the Kd tree build and if the compositor doesn't know about the blank regions, who cares.

Second problem of redistribution looks like it was the LOD render. Forcing LOD to use outline seems to have solved it. Probably the LOD pipeline is using its own DataRedistribution which was triggering the D3 separately. I only overrode the normal 'still render' pipeline, so I will check to see if overriding the LOD pipeline too solves it. (they should certainly share the redistributed geometry shouldn't they?)

Thanks Utkarsh for putting me on the right track. Fingers crossed I don't find any more problems. First big test here did a full opacity rendering on all 12 cores for 10million triangles about 7s which seems ok for my current needs. Now I'll try with the big data on the cluster :) (closer to a billion triangles I think!)

Subject: RE: [Paraview] [Paraview-developers] (Ordered) Compositing question.

Doesn't seem to be working as expected yet. I have found some problems which I'll mention here for general reference.


1)      Setting the ExtentTranslator using the function
vtkPVRenderView::SetOrderedCompositingInformation(inInfo, this, input_bet, whole_extent, origin, spacing); doesn't stop the Redistribution from taking place. I'm still debugging this, but perhaps the pipeline somehow knows that this is not a structured dataset and ignores the information during one phases of the DataDelivery pipeline. (NB. input_bet is bounds extent translator - I'm using my vtkBoundsExtentTranslator but it inherits from the standard ExtentTranslator)


2)      I know that 1) isn't quite true because I can see that the KdTree is being constructed from the extents I supply for each bounding region. There is a nasty bug in here which is that for an unstructured grid, boundary cells are uniquely assigned to each process and this means that the bounding boxes will  slightly overlap as a cell on one process may overlap bounds with another process. This causes the KdTree construction to abort with an error. I can fix this by shrinking the bounds (extents) I pass to the KdTree but this in turn causes some parts of the screen to be not rendered. I haven't quite solved what's going on here. By screen I really mean data, there are empty regions between the data corresponding to the shrunken extents I've used. Seems very odd because the Compositor only needs to know which order to composite. Suspect that IceT is using the bounds to generate regions internally to composite and blanking out the bits it thinks are 'invisible'. Need to find a hack to fix this (IceT option anywhere?). Even though the extents are being used, I don't yet understand why the redistribution is taking place anyway.

3)      Lock Interactive render option does not work, (I'm using 3.98 from last week), used to be able to interact and change rotation several times then after 2 seconds it would do a still render. Not any more. (I'm using 12 core Windows machine for my  debuging).

4)      Changing any options in window setting causes entire rendering pipeline to reexecute. D3 filter takes 80 seconds to redistribute my not very big dataset, if I open up settings and then click "disable splash screen" or change "lock interactive render" value then refresh the view, Data redistribution is done again thus causing a very long wait and paraview is basically unusable (for larger datasets) if you also consider the non working interactive/still delay feature. No real need to invalidate the entire view when something like this changes.

5)      Error messages are not displayed on windows when using client + pvservers. Any vtkErrorMacro("blah") causes the app to hang, you can find out what the error is by attaching the debugger and viewing the stack trace and inspecting the char* passed to the output text.

6)      App hangs on connection to pvserver if you -use-offscreen-rendering on a windows machine.

Subject: [Paraview] Possible vtkOBBTree bug or weirdness
Message-ID: <CAHJ1_RPUsr_eN3=gYPgZoe89yeHFkZM-TrVxKmBK+Af=96ENdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

So I've been having some problems with vtkOBBTree using the
intersectWithLine method with the following signature:

int IntersectWithLine (double a0[3], double a1[3], double tol, double &t,
double x[3], double pcoords[3], int &subId, vtkIdType &cellId,
vtkGenericCell *cell)

In particular, depending on what I have initialised some of the input
parameters to, which I had assumed and the code and docs indicate their
initial values are not important, with exception of a0, a1, and tol(0,0), I
got different results.  Having looked at the tree, I found that I had
forgotten to set the tolerance, it was undefined in the class and unset.
(might be good if a sensible default got set, this too could be defined as
a bug...)  Anyway, correcting that and setting the tolerance to zero I then
got this:

Percentage Complete: 2Generic Warning: In VTK/Common/vtkMath.cxx, line 736
vtkMath::Jacobi: Error extracting eigenfunctions

A lot.  Looking at the code, the following comment is a bit worrying:

  //// this is NEVER called
  if ( i >= VTK_MAX_ROTATIONS )
    {
    vtkGenericWarningMacro(
       "vtkMath::Jacobi: Error extracting eigenfunctions");
    return 0;
    }

I need a locator that can let me intersect with a line, and given me back:
1) the cell that it intersected with,
2) the location of the intersection.

Also I found in some instances 't' was bigger than one, which I understood
to not be possible.....

Any help, and advice on an alternative intersector that can give me back
the above would be great as my choice of vtkobbtree was almost random....

Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Volume rendering & pvserver
Message-ID: <201211211418.26384.johannes.zarl@jku.at>

Hi,

It seems like there is a bug with rendering volume datasets when being 
connected to a pvserver process.

When I use the builtin: server and load the dataset into paraview, everything 
is rendered correctly. However, when I connect to a server process, only parts 
of the volume data are shown. Objects using surface representation are always 
rendered correctly.

Just now I realised that there is a pattern to display irregularities: the 
bounderies of the rendered parts align with the data-segmentation between the 
process ids.

So I guess there is some kind of communication problem between the pvserver 
processes? If so, how can I find out the cause of this?

Any help appreciated,
  Johannes


P.S.:
The example data I use is the headsq.vti file from the ParaViewTutorialData 
dataset. I currently use ParaView/master 3.14.1-2441-g46cfc4c, and have tested 
this also with paraview 3.14.1 (compiled from source).

The server is started as follows:
mpirun -np 3 \
  --host n001 --host n002 --host n003 \
  --mca btl openib,sm,self \
   -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH -x DISPLAY=:0 \
   pvserver /home/edvz/zing/scratch/vcva/curvedscreen.pvx

The curvedscreen.pvx file is this one:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

Hi Utkarsh,


Thanks for your reply.
The PointSprite Plugin is very useful when we visualize 3D Point Cloud data.
I hope the issue will be fixed.

Setting opacity less than 1 on a ParaView source (cylinder) does not 
change the problem.

Thanks always,

Paraview crashes while executing the loop. I tried it on two computers multiple times.

Then the empty (black) OpenGL window comes up, and Windows says "paraview.exe stopped working". (If, however, I load empty.pvsm from the GUI, everything's dandy. Also, if I don't get rid of the first layout window, I can load another state file.)

Good luck :). BTW, indeed, there's scope for providing improved
interface for SetOrderedCompositingInformation(). I implemented for
the use-cases I had at hand. Just the fact that's it's now easier to
add alternative interfaces for the same is a step in the right
direction (the same would have been very tricky with 3.14). For the
redistribution bug, you must be calling
vtkPVRenderView::MarkAsRedistributable() somewhere in your
representation. Unless a representation says it's data is
"redistributable", the vtkPVDataDeliveryManager won't attempt to
redistribute it. It maybe being set in your superclass. I realized I
didn't add any API to unmark as redistributable. Feel free to add that
(and push a patch back).

Volume rendering of image datasets is currently not supported in CAVE
(aka CurvedScreen) configurations. One hacky way to deal with it is to
convert the data to unstructured grid (using Tetrahedralize filter)
and then volume render that.

Message-ID: <CAFFYk1UfgvQG-n8e1TG8X6z1xti=dT1Cw9JgUAtoLBhX9v0_uA@mail.gmail.com>

It seems to be a valid attribute (CreateXYPlotView.ViewSize), but it's not
having any affect when the image is saved (they all come out in the default
300x300.

For a normal 3D view, this would be GetRenderView.ViewSize = [1200, 800],
for example.  But how is this done whilst in plot view?

Thanks.

Hi Johannes,

Utkarsh is right and what is suggested could work for you. I also remember
someone asking the same question in this mailing list and that person was
able to modify the volume rendering code to make it work in the CAVE. I
have to find the information but I believe that was the case. If you don't
find that email in this list, let us know unless you want to take the route
suggested by Utkarsh.

Thanks,

Hi Eddy,

after talking with Berk, we won't load that module by default and you will
just need to load it yourself in your script.

Did you switch to advanced mode ? The little gear on the top right of the
panel.
In advanced mode, you should get as much settings as before.

Hi Seb,

I have had the same problem and found out that the radius transfer 
function will no longer fetch the min/max value of the given scalar array.
So you have to set it manually:
Radius Mode: Scalar
Radius Array: your ScalarArray
RadiusTransferFunction Enabled [x]
Radius Use Scalar Range: {r_min} {r_max} (you can get this from the 
information tab)

see screenshot for my settings.

@Developers: would it be possible that the PointSpriteFilter get the 
extends from the array like in Version 3.14 ?

I've found another bug:
if the first step of a time-series does not contain any point-data, the 
drop down boxes remain empty even if the second timestep provides data 
for radius, in past versions the PointSprite filter recognized the 
arrays for every following file.

Greez,
Christian

Hi,

I have just installed the latest nightly build 3.98.0-RC3, and the bug is gone (Windows XP 32-bit).

Thank you!

Matthais,

We should have the next release candidate in the next day or two, just waiting for a green dashboard to tag the next release candidate.

For the records: the ctrl-select bug occurs also when I use a sphere source. But it will (hopefully) be fixed in the next release candidate anyway...

Thanks again,

P.S.: Is it already known when we can expect the next release candidate?

You can create the sphere source, by selecting "Sphere" from the "Sources" menu.

For the records:
The omission of the ctrl key was an oversight, item 6 should read:
6. Press and hold down Ctrl key, click and drag to select more points, release Ctrl key.

BTW, how do I get the sphere source?

Thank you for your help,

Is the omission of pressing/releasing the Ctrl key in your procedure an oversight or intentional? Also, can you try with Sphere source -- exactly how I described. If that works and something else doesn't, at least we'll have a starting point. Right now, I have not been able to reproduce the Ctrl key problem (the steps you describe of course fail since I never press the Ctrl key), nor has anyone who responded to this thread (let's ignore the 'call not supported' problem, that's a separate one and I will track that down).

Hi,

my procedure is:


1.       Load can.ex2

2.       Apply

3.       Click "Select Points On"

4.       Click and drag to select some points

5.       Click "Select Points on"

6.       Click and drag to select more points

7.       The previously selected points are not selected any more, only those selected by the 2nd selection. A message window appears saying: "Generic Warning: In C:\DBD\pvs-x32\paraview\src\paraview\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 408
Call not supported for the current property type."

The same happens when I select cells instead of points.

ParaView 3.98.0-RC1-2-ge3fcf70 32-bit, Windows XP.

And it works for me just fine for me on Windows too :/. Here is the exact sequence of actions in a clean paraview

1. Create Sphere
2. Hit Apply
3. Type "s", ParaView enters selection mode (Select Cells On)
4. Click and drag in the 3D view, some cells get selected.
5. Type "s", ParaView enters selection mode again.
6. Press Ctrl and keep it pressed:
   --- With Ctrl pressed, click and drag in 3D view and few more cells will get selected.
7. Release Ctrl only after click-and-drag operation is complete.

Utkarsh,
I tried this on Linux, and it works fine.
I tried this windows (master pull from about last Friday, November 10), and it does not work.  Not sure if it is related, but my debug build outputs the following warning:

Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\..\..\src\ParaView3\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 408
Call not supported for the current property type.

Matthias, if you have not already, please write this up as a bug.

This seems to work for me on Linux and Mac (the only platforms I could test on as I am travelling). Have you tried these on anything other than Windows? I wonder if it's a Windows only problem. I will test on Windows once I get back later this week.

Hi,

in the new binary (3.98.0-RC1, Windows 32 bit), I still cannot add points to the current selection by holding the ctrl key (bug 0013056). Is there a workaround or fix in sight? I use this feature frequently, so I will have to stick with 3.12.0-RC2 until this is fixed (it doesn't work in 3.14 either).

Hello!

 

Does anybody knows how to calculate volume integral result in ParaView? I
have a unstructured mesh with scale energy source. I would like to calculate
the integral energy over the whole mesh. 

If mesh file needed, please reply with your email.

 

Thanks in advance!

Thanks !

I load the date into Integrate Variables, and the date is shown in a table. Then what is the hint for the next step? 
I check the manual for Integrate Variables(http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/IntegrateAttributes.html), but doesn't help.

Subject: [Paraview] Distortion when loading time varying vector field from
 raw binary files using xdmf reader
Message-ID: <50AFAA90.6040707@in.tum.de>

Hi,

I have a time-varying 2D vector field (2D velocities) of the size 256 by 
256 pixels sampled at 294 points in time. Each frame is stored in a raw 
binary file ('uv_0000.raw' to 'uv_0293.raw'). I am using 
'timeseries.xdmf' [1] to load this data into ParaView.

Unfortunately, in ParaView 3.98.0  on both Linux64 [2] and Windows64 
[3], the vector field is displayed heavily distorted.

Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Tobias

Subject: [Paraview] Reader plugins in static builds ignored?
Message-ID: <50AFAFC1.7010205@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi,

I'm seeing that with static builds of ParaView 3.14.1 and git/master reader
plugins can be successfully built along with ParaView, but not actually accessed
from the GUI:

AdiosReader, AnalyzeNIfTIReader, H5PartReader as well as custom readers do get
statically linked into e.g. the paraview binary, but the ParaView GUI (built-in
mode) lists no entries that correspond to the
ServerManagerConfiguration/Hints/ReaderFactory XML in neither the FileOpen
dialog nor the OpenDataWith dialog.

I'm wondering whether this is something confined to my setup, whether the
mentioned reader plugins are missing some initialization code for static builds
or whether this is just an issue not yet documented in the bug tracker.

Thanks,
Sven

Folks,

In preparation of the next ParaView release, the ParaView 3.98.0, RC3 is
now available for download (
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php).

We will have a detailed summary for the new features and enhancements in
this release soon. In the mean time, a complete list of features
implemented and bugs fixed in this release can be found on the bug tracker (
http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php).

A couple of caveats about the binaries currently uploaded at this time:
- MacOSX binaries come in two sets, one for Snow Leopard (10.6) and Lion
(10.7) and the second one for Mountain Lion (10.8).

Hi Utkarsh,

Nice! Your patch indeed fixes the issue. The mentioned reader plugins
and my custom reader plugins are now working for static builds, too.

Thanks a lot for resolving this so quickly.
Sven

Subject: [Paraview] Distortion when loading time varying vector field
 from raw binary files using xdmf reader

Hi again!

Maybe it matters, maybe it doesn't. This is how I am writing those raw 
files using Matlab:

     % in loop over all frames i = 1:294
     f_uv = [filename '_' sprintf('%04d', i-1) '.raw'];
     fid_uv = fopen(fullfile(outdir,f_uv), 'w');
     fwrite(fid_uv, uv, 'float');     % uv is 256 by 256 by 2 matrix
     fclose(fid_uv);

When I do a quiver plot of a frame in Matlab everything seems normal.

I am also very willing to consider other options for getting this time 
series from Matlab into ParaView.

Thanks in advance!

Tobias

Subject: [Paraview] pqPipelineSource::visibilityChanged() not fired when a
 downstream filter changes visibility
Message-ID: <20121125.123404.198841438.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

My custom reader panel (a pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel) hooks the
pqPipelineSource::visibilityChanged() signal of the corresponding
reader proxy. I noticed that the signal used to be fired when a
downstream filter that changes the visibility of the input
(e.g. Slice) is added with PV 3.14.1 (+ earlier versions) and 3.98.0
RC3 when I --use-old-panels, but does not with the new panels of the
RC3 (OS X 10.6.8, Qt 4.8.3, CMake 2.8.10).

I attached a test plugin code to demonstrate the problem (a modified
Examples/Plugins/GUIObjectPanel). Try:
Build the plugin
Start ParaView from a command terminal (with/without --use-old-panels)
Load the plugin
Sources - Cone, Apply
Filters - Slice, Apply

The expected behavior is a "Visibility changed" output on the terminal
when a slice is added because it turns off the visiblity of the cone
source.  It works as expected when ParaView is started with
--use-old-panels but not without the option.

Can anybody give me an insight?

Sorry for delay, Derek..

What do you mean by 'next step'? It's over, no more steps needed. In the table 
volume integrals of your data are presented, one value for each data array.

Hi Aashish,

It seems that the memory consumption with the tetrahedalize filter is quite 
excessive, and probably too high for our usage-scenario (our cluster nodes 
only have 16 GB ram).

I couldn't find the thread you wrote about in the mailing list archives. Do you 
know anything more specific about that thread?

Cheers,
  Johannes

Dear Paraview community,

I meanwhile installed Paraview on 5 computers, but the most important one
refuses ... 
...I have no idea whats wrong ... probably some library missing.

Its a fresh Linux Mint 13 (~Ubuntu 12.04) and I have the Ubuntu .deb 
installed and running .. fine.  
But I need a special version, so I started compiling myself.

I can compile the official sources if i skip the shared libraries. 
But if I put the Plugins on, i got the following break down ...


Linking CXX executable ../../../../../bin/QVTKCxxTests
bin/libQVTK.so.pv3.14: error: undefined reference to
'XGetWindowAttributes'

I must have forgotten the source tarball but if you checkout master that is
the current RC3.

I'll try to upload the source tarball tomorrow.

Subject: [Paraview] Compare two alike datasets
Message-ID: <10340596.SvIugNgW1L@horus>

Hello,

I user Paraview to postprocess openfoam CFD data. A frequent use case is to 
compare two datasets that have minor variations (geometry, mesh, boundary 
condition).

Currently I find myself loading both datasets, splitting the 3D view and 
linking the camera. For processing the data I need to add and configure each 
filter twice to the pipeline, but each filter identically.

Is there a way to apply filters simultaneously two both (all) datasets. I've 
tried a comparative view, but did not found it useful (or did not understand 
entirely). 

Thanks,

Florian

Good catch.

In fact we don't generate that file. Therefore, if you want a 32bit linux
ParaView binary, you will need to get the one with the older libc.

Sorry about that, I update the Web site right away,

Subject: [Paraview] Trace?
Message-ID: <CAM9occhE9=j_EDH64165o9zfSN8LpWX9BYXU9QvHszMAVvMvLg@mail.gmail.com>

I use save/load state to make viewing more efficient: viewing results
during a simulation.

Now I would like to make the results of a filter (say smoothing) avialable
to downstream
simulation steps.

'Trace' looks (looked) promising, but I don't get an option to save the
trace (under Tools)
after starting and stopping the trace.

Does Trace work? If so, what does it take?

I guess the first question might be: "Will Trace let me run in 'batch'?

I haven't seen that problem before.

Do you get the Script Editor window that shows your recorded actions?
If not, what version of ParaView are you using. If so, click on it and
the OS's window manager changes the menu over from the ParaView menu
to the Script Editor's own menu, which has Save in its File menu.

Yes it does work, nothing special should be required.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview projects always rebuilt
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990822243F@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

Since I started using Visual Studio 2012 and paraview 3.98 I've found that projects always rebuild (I don't recall this being a problem with 3.14). Re-making a plugin causes the entire project to rebuild. Editing a single file in a paraview module causes the whole module + all dependencies to rebuild. Client/server wrapping reexecutes when it shouldn't.

There appears to be a bug with visual studio which causes rebuilds when any number of possible problems occur (and I don't pretend to understand them) - including a project having a dependency on a file which is missing - this triggers rebuilds of everything (according to various reports found via googling).

Non paraview projects don't seem to be having this trouble (cmake generated ones I'm talking about) so I can't see cmake being at fault, but possibly paraview is somehow declaring a bad file somewhere in dependencies?

Has anyone else noticed this or had problems of this kind, if so is there a workaround/fix?

Thanks

JB

What I always do, have done forever, and have no idea if it still works, is the following:
cMakeVars = cMakeVars +  '-DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF '

Other than that, I will defer to the build masters at Kitware.

Python is a particularly good glue language.

You can have you scripts/programs call "pvbatch yourscript.py" and/or
call arbitrary scripts/executables from within yourscript.py.

For examples of how to call out from python see:

Caution, from now on, topics that were in next before the gatekeeper
review and that haven't been merged to master will be automatically
removed from next so next will basically be equivalent to master.

The reason is to give any contributor the opportunity to rebase their work
on top of master in order to get a cleaner history or even remove their
branch.
Therefore, from now on, branch that are on stage should be manually
pushed by their owner to next after gatekeeper review. The following
command can be run to do so:

# To push without rebasing your work (don't need to be in git repo)
# -------
$ ssh git at paraview.org stage ParaView merge YOUR_STAGE_BRANCH_NAME


# To rebase your work on top of master
# -------
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b YOUR_STAGE_BRANCH_NAME stage/YOUR_STAGE_BRANCH_NAME
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push stage :YOUR_STAGE_BRANCH_NAME
$ git stage-push
$ git stage-merge

David:

Thanks for the feedback.

I am new to mailing lists: I cc'd paraview at paraview.org on this note - I
hope that covers your
request to keep the discussion on the mailing list.

WRT Trace:

Thank you for the links: I will need to spend time learning how to read the
material . . .

For now, I notice that the .py script (first_stab.py - which is attached)
does not seem to direct
the saving of a .ply file - which was one of the sequence of actions taken
during the Trace.

Is saving/writing a file part of what Trace is to record? (I used Save
Data.)

Thanks,
Tim

Correct.

Add a call to WriteImage(filename.png) to dump an png.

Add this to your reading list:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

And make liberal use of help() and tab completion in the python shell
within the Paraview GUI as you learn.

David:

Thanks. I do indeed have a lot of learning potential.

WRT Trace: You indicate that Trace should record a save action?

I am not sure why Trace (the way I used it) did not record the Save
Data action during my
GUI session.

What should I do to get Trace to record that action?

Regards,
Tim

Sorry that was a misunderstanding on my part. Trace does not record

Subject: [Paraview] VTK-file written by ParaView cannot be read by ParaView
Message-ID: <50B6413C.6070008@tu-braunschweig.de>

Hi,

I have loaded an EnSight file (results from an external code) into 
ParaView, taken a slice from it and saved it in Legacy VTK format. The 
result is a VTK file with multiblock datasets. When I try to load it 
again, ParaView does not recognise the file format and asks me to choose 
a reader. Why does ParaView not know the format of a file, that it has 
written itself?

The written VTK file contains several "CHILDREN" with part of the data 
(I suppose that it is just divided) plus several empty CHILDREN. If I 
put the data of a single CHILD into a seperate file, I can load it into 
ParaView without any problems.
Now, I could manipulate the file "by hand" (or script), so that I get a 
file I can use again in ParaView, but I just do not think, that this is 
the way it is supposed to be. Can somebody help me?

Best regards
Ian

Hi Joe,

Could you explain slightly what you've done so far to install and run the
examples ?
Moreover, are you running tomcat as your user or are you relying on the
system package of your linux box ?
Oh wait, what OS are you trying that out ?

Thanks,

Seb

There is no multi-block legacy format. What file extension did you try to
write ? It should be .vtm by default.

Subject: [Paraview] Animation Resolution Problem
Message-ID: <CAJAZx5CnDp7YshdDDB6OUUQqWOW6JS9P9DUTT0mx8463-B1UbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to export an animation (sequence of pngs) with a specific
size. This seems straightforward to do using the Animation Settings Dialog.
I enter my desired geometry where it says Resolution (pixels), specifically
640 x 720. Once the animation begins saving, however, the output png files
do not have anything close to this resolution, and instead are 2758 ? 1348,
an unusably large size. As far as I can tell, the aspect ratio of the true
output resolution is determined by the current view window, but the
dimensions are rescaled to be much larger. The resolution I specify in the
Animation Settings Dialog apparently has no affect whatsoever.

I would appreciate any suggestion you have about how to overcome this
problem.

I am using Paraview 3.14.1, 64-bit, QT version 4.6.4. on Mac OS 10.7.5

Best Regards,
Ryan Abernathey

Ok, that helps for a possible solution. Thanks!
With

writer = CreateWriter('sol_i=0.vtm')
writer.UpdatePipeline()

I get an XML file, that can be loaded back into ParaView.
---
Still the behaviour I noticed before remains strange.

I used the extension ".vtk". From the GUI, I chose "Save Data", and then 
"Legacy VTK Files(*.vtk)", which should be a valid option, because it is 
explicitly offered. The pvpython commands were

writer = DataSetWriter(slice)
writer.FileName = 'sol_i=0.vtk'
writer.FileType = "Ascii"
writer.UpdatePipeline()

The result of both is the same, i.e. a file with the following structure:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET MULTIBLOCK
CHILDREN 96
CHILD 0
# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 39714 float
...
POLYGONS 77132 308528
...
POINT_DATA 39714
...
ENDCHILD
CHILD 0
# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 219146 float
...
ENDCHILD
CHILD 0
...
ENDCHILD
...

Each part between "CHILD 0" and "ENDCHILD" would be a complete Legacy 
VTK file in itself.
The ParaView version is 3.14.1.

By the way, when I use

writer = CreateWriter('sol_i=0.vtk')

I get the following error message:

ERROR: In [...]\src\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\vtkSMWriterFactory.cxx, 
line 374
vtkSMWriterFactory: No matching writer found for extension: vtk

Is ".vtk" not a valid file extension?

I think this was a known bug that was fixed.  I looked in the bug tracker, and couldn't find it.  Try removing your configuration files - I believe this can cause your problem.

If that doesn't fix it, I just tried remote and local server, making the animation larger and smaller than my window, on Linux.  All succeeded .  This is with the newest, latest, greatest, bestest version of paraView - 3.98.0.  RC3 is currently on the web site.

Similar workaround to the other response:

In the past I've made paraview install libraries into /usr/lib64/paraview with 
-DPV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR:PATH=lib64/paraview, but this appears to no longer work. 
  How can I do this now?

I'm using Alan Scott's trick of

This builds all our packages successfully.

Hi Andy

Awesome, it's not urgent, but will be good to fix.

I saw it on Hopper 
(http://open.cdash.org/testDetails.php?test=167278006&build=2685242) and 
Nautilus(http://open.cdash.org/testDetails.php?test=167254351&build=2684614)

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 3.98rc3 configuration error: CheckFortran.cmake
	missing
Message-ID: <50B73B3B.6020409@slingshot.co.nz>

Hi,

so I am trying to configure 3.98rc3 with cmake-2.8.10.1 and I get
the following error message in ccmake:
 CMake Error at CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors/CMakeLists.txt:2
(include):
   include could not find load file:

     /home/work/fbissey/sandbox/ParaView/SuperBuild/CheckFortran.cmake

I see that all the content of the superbuild folder is now in a separate
tarball. This is fine but should the fortran adaptors depends on
something from the superbuild folder?
Shouldn't something like CMakeDetermineFortranCompiler.cmake
which comes with cmake be used instead? I also don't remember having
this problem in rc1.

Hi Seb,

I've followed this
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_with_system_tomcat_package step by
step, without any obvious issues.  It's being run as my user, so hopefully
isn't a permissions problem.

This is on CentOS 6.1

Thanks for the help,

Christian,

Thanks for getting me started.  And sorry it took me so long to respond.
 I've been moving pretty slow on this project.

Anyway, I've done the following with my script:

import math

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()

points = input.GetPointData()


SurfCvg = 0

for i in xrange(numPoints):

 d = points.GetArray('d').GetValue(i)

 coords = input.GetPoint(i)

 z = coords[3]

 h = 0.00015 - abs(z - 0.00015) - 0.5*d

 H0 = 2*h/d

 if (H0 < 0.002)

  SurfCvg = SurfCvg + 0.25*math.pi*d*d


Theta = SurfCvg/(0.01*0.001)

outputarray = vtk.vtkStringArray()

outputarray.SetName("Surface Coverage")

outputarray.SetNumberOfTuples(1)

outputarray.SetValue(0, "%d" % (Theta))

output.GetRowData().AddArray(outputarray)


First of all, am I getting the z coordinate correctly?  I haven't been able
to find an answer to that in my searching.  Secondly, my end goal is to
plot the value of Theta over time for my dataset.  Do I have the output
stuff done right, and where do I go from there?


Thanks in advance.


-Scott

Is it possible to define the size and the position of the color bar? I would like to compare some pictures of different projects in a presentation and it looks better if the color bar does not jump around.

Hi Burlen,

Did you submit a bug? I couldn't find it if you did.

It looks like both of those dashboards are next so I can have them tested
before merging into master.

Thanks,
Andy

Seb,

Further to this, (if I open in Chrome) I get this error Resource Not Found:
http://localhost:8080/PWService/js/ParaViewWeb.js.  I can confirm that the
file is where it should be and is 775, so should be fine.  If I try and go
to that address, I get 404 from Tomcat:

HTTP Status 404 -

Subject: [Paraview] (no subject)
Message-ID: <CAM9occjLOeRhKR=qYoO1JDcYZSoh+MGVkrBdQaQAkkPvG6scEg@mail.gmail.com>

I am using paraview 3.14 (64 bit, ubuntu 12.04 vm on a MBP).

I am trying to run pvpython to view .py files generated using Trace:

'which' pvpython' yields: /usr/bin/pvpython

'pvpython' yields: Error converting executable file
"/usr/bin/../lib/paraview/pvpython" to real path: No such file or directory

So, /usr/bin/python seems to be looking for /usr/lib/paraview/pvpython

Which is indeed not there.

I uninstalled (purged) and installed 3.14 again. Same thing.

BTW: I did see the notes regarding 3.14.1-2 from ~6 months ago, but cannot
tell which 3.14 binary installer is on the
Paraview download page.

Nevertheless, I downloaded the 3.14 tar-ball.

When I run a .py script generated using trace, an image pops up for a
second, then disappears.

BTW: The same thing happens with 3.98, at least on a companion machine.

What am I missing?

Thanks,
Tim

Hi Francois,

Thanks for the information. I added a bug report in case you want to track
it at http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13693. It should be fixed
shortly.

I'm assuming you're using the coprocessing tools and the fortran interface,
otherwise you can turn that off during configuration.

it looks like pvserver is also impacted, hanging after the gui disconnects.

Thanks Andy,

I am not making use of it right now but I am packaging for Gentoo and I will
install it for general availability on a cluster down here so I need to know
what works what doesn't. Now let's see my build log from last night....

3.14.1, so I just upgraded. Now everything works fine! Many thanks.

vtk is a valid extension but maybe not for the writer factory for some

Subject: [Paraview] How to install into /usr/lib64 with 3.98.0 RC3?

That should work but you can also try with VTK_INSTALL_LIB_DIR.

So where those library being copied then ?

Thanks,

You need to compile ParaView/pvpython with OSMesa.

It seems that the PWService.war is not inside your ${TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps

If it is did you looked at the tomcat logs ?
And you should definitely not start with that
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_with_system_tomcat_package.

Once ParaView builded, the deployment should be basically that

1) download tomcat.tgz
2) tar xvzf tomcat.tgz
3) cp ..../*.war tomcat/webapps
4) cp .../pw-config.properties tomcat/lib
5) tomcat/bin/startup.sh
6) download activemq.tgz
7) tar xvzf activemq.tgz
8) activemq/bin/activemq start
9) connect to http://localhost:8080/PW

After you may run into invalid configuration inside pw-config.properties or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH issue but that's all.

Subject: [Paraview] Need help with programmable filter output
Message-ID: <CAG0uffUVu0myWxqcU1a1fRO34czVJWhroN_+aR9dg34Ff9s70g@mail.gmail.com>

I am attempting to run an analysis on some data which requires summing up
some numbers down to a single value for the whole domain for each time
step.  I'm having trouble figuring out how to get the output and what VTK
classes and functions to use.  Here is what I have so far:

import math

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()

points = input.GetPointData()

SurfCvg = 0

for i in xrange(numPoints):

 d = points.GetArray('d').GetValue(i)

 coords = input.GetPoint(i)

 z = coords[2]

 h = 0.00015 - abs(z - 0.00015) - 0.5*d

 H0 = 2*h/d

 if (H0 < 0.002):

  SurfCvg = SurfCvg + 0.25*math.pi*d*d

Theta = SurfCvg/(0.01*0.001)

outputarray = vtk.vtkFloatArray()

outputarray.SetNumberOfValues(1)

outputarray.SetValue(0, Theta)

output.GetRowData().AddArray(outputarray)


I'm not even sure what to use as the output data set type.  In the end I
need to plot (or export as a table) the value of "Theta" across all my time
steps.  Any guidance would be appreciated.

Output should be vtkTable. By the way, if you have numpy installed, this
could be done much more efficiently and in less code. See

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Programmable_Filter
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Calculator

You may also want to check the numpy documentation.

In general, if your data is medium to large, you want to avoid for loops
over all cells/points in Python.

Sebastien:

Good question:

My goal is to have a script which smooths results between simulation steps
(fortran codes).

I use paraview to view results, and the smoothing filter in paraview seems
to do what I want.

I want to start with a Trace-generated python script, and edit it to write
the vertices and element
info to a file (.ply would be nice) that the next code can read.

So, fortunately for me (in some sense), I decided to upgrade my ubuntu OS
to 12.10. This has
paraview 3.14.1-6build1 on its software list (aptitude).

This version corrected a bug (with pvpython) in the version of paraview
3.14 that I was using.
(I also spent a day trying to get/install other versions. That was not very
successful.)

Now if I import the trace generated py file, it pops up (and stays). Not a
very good image, but it is
a start!

Being new to python and paraview, this is quite a step.

Any suggestions as to how to write vertex/node info would be appreciated.


Thanks,
Tim

The data file I attached to the previous version of this update note was
too large.

I am resending the note with that file removed.

ascii - to no avail.

Any hints?

Aside: When I put in 0 (for ascii) as a third arg. to CreateWriter,
pvpython complained about
having more than 2 arguments. I note that in the paraview users guide,
CreateWriter has
several arguments in some cases. help(CreateWriter) indicates that more
than 2 arguments
can be used:

>>> help(CreateWriter)

Help on function CreateWriter in module paraview.simple:


CreateWriter(filename, proxy=None, **extraArgs)

Creates a writer that can write the data produced by the source proxy in

the given file format (identified by the extension). If no source is

provided, then the active source is used. This doesn't actually write the

data, it simply creates the writer and returns it.

Regards,
Tim

Looks like they are replaced with:
-DVTK_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR
-DVTK_INSTALL_ARCHIVE_DIR
-DVTK_INSTALL_LIBRARY_DIR

which seems to work.

Hi all,

Caution, from now on, topics that were in next before the gatekeeper
review and that haven't been merged to master will be automatically
removed from next so next will basically be equivalent to master.

In an effort to clean up stage please remove any deprecated or dead
branches that belong to you.

Thank you,

Seb

Documentation for the new memory inspector panel can be found here:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Memory_Inspector_Panel

The new panel reports per-process usage and provides some additional 
debugging tools. It should be available in the 3.98 release.
