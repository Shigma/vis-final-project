Hello Mathieu,

I realized it crashes when I add a porperty with a "?" symbol. In fact I
have a XML plugin version of the same Python programmable filter. This XML
file contains a Python variable name with a ? simbol (degrees). When I add
this property it crashes (It is available on the attached file). So the
problem was not with the code itself but with the XML file.


On the other hand, when it did not crashed, I could not find the custom
filter simply because the brand new custom filter was on the Sources list
and not on the alphabetical list of filters (sorry for that !!!)

Sometimes the creation procedure was supposed to be ok (no crashes, no
error messages), and i continue to work until a new error apeared (not
related with this issue). When i open Paraview again,  the filter was not
there . With the "Reset Session" you told me, it works fine. So, It seems
to be a good practice to quit the session without errors in order to avoid
to lost the Custom Filter. created earlier


Finally, the autoload of the Custom Filters works fine, but I realized that
the list of cpd files gets empty after a crash happens during the creation
of the custom filter. If the custom filter procedure succeeds, it works as
intended. However if it crashes, all or some of the existing Filters just
desapear.

Thanks again for your support !

PS : i respond also to the Paraview mail list (somebody may have the same
issues)

Best regards,

Miguel Angel AGUIRRE

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf format with hdf5: nodes and elements labels
Message-ID: <7de56148d75461645ddf0d9cd6645418@free.fr>

Hi All, 

Some time ago I had a look on the capabilities of Paraview and the xdmf
format to postprocess (huge amount of) results coming from Finite
Elements solvers (structural/mechanical engineering) ... I started to
play with the hdf5 libraries and I'm happy with ... 

Unfortunately I did not anticipate the fact that node and elements
numbering are implicit into the xdmf format, aren't they? (I found old
post on the net on that topics, from 2013) 

if so, I'll have to write an intermediate code to renumber nodes and
elements (except if a work around exists); in addition to the work for
that task, the new mesh changes from the original one (in terms of node
& element label to point on), that is not convenient. 

(I'm still wondering when I'll deal with sub-parts ...) 

Are they people still confront to it? has any solution been found? 

Thanks for any feedback 

Paul

This sounds like the same problem as
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/12708 and
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/13679. Basically, the
XML parser can't handle the special characters properly.

Subject: [Paraview] Writer Plugin does not release the handle to the output
 files
Message-ID: <CAHDyfPBC=_V+uS+u=0h5jR5q+Uv2ju2443gRDoWfngaM6e0Bng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am creating a writer plugin for Fluent in ParaView 5.5.0 built under
Windows 10. This plugin aims at writing vtkUnstructuredGrid input out
to a Fluent format file as a 3D mesh.

The plugin is built and loaded into ParaView successfully. But when
Paraview opens the attached input and saves it using this
FluentWriterPlugin, a problem occurs. That is, the plugin does not try
to lock the output files after writing and closing them. So I can not
refer to them until I close the ParaView itself.

The following is my implementation.
https://github.com/Kenichiro-Yoshimi/FluentWriterPlugin

What is going wrong here?

Thanks in advance,
yoshimi

Message-ID: <17954FF4A6EDC447B60CEFADD6DCAE9302776E10@GSVCLU05.ges.ferlan.it>

Dear users,
I need to write in a .csv file some PointData from a slice.
I wrote my point values inside a ?for? cycle thus I would maintain only one .csv file and append each time the new data to this.
For this I have created the following commands in my script:


                # create a new 'Pass Arrays'
                passArrays1 = PassArrays(Input=calculator7)
                UpdatePipeline()

                # Properties modified on passArrays1
                passArrays1.PointDataArrays = ['pressure', 'velocity']
                UpdatePipeline()

                # Create a new 'SpreadSheet View'
                spreadSheetView1 = CreateView('SpreadSheetView')
                spreadSheetView1.ColumnToSort = ''
                spreadSheetView1.BlockSize = 1024L
                # uncomment following to set a specific view size
                # spreadSheetView1.ViewSize = [400, 400]

                # export view
                ExportView('C:/Users/acaffagni/Desktop/ciao.csv', ?a?,view=spreadSheetView1)


Unfortunately, the program stop itself at the ?Properties modified on passArrays1?, without updating the pipeline.
Maybe it exists a more smart way to create this .csv file.

Thanks a lot for the suggestions,
Andrea

Hello Andrea,

Maybe a Programmable Filter would be a better way. I use this approach to
create csv files with data comming from slices:


import csv

#Create an empty csv file with headers:
FilePath = "C:/Users/Miguel Angel AGUIRRE/Desktop/DataOutput.csv"
Headers=["X","Y","Z","PRESSURE","VELOCITY"]
with open(FilePath, 'wb') as csvfile:
        filewriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',')
        filewriter.writerow(Headers)

# Get array data from input:
X = inputs[0].Points[:,0][0]
Y = inputs[0].Points[:,1][0]
Z = inputs[0].Points[:,2][0]
PRESSURE = inputs[0] .GetPointData().GetArray(" PRESSURE ")
VELOCITY  = inputs[0] .GetPointData().GetArray("  VELOCITY  ")


# Add this data to the file (you can use an interation here if you want to
do add info comming from several slices)
FieldData=[X,Y,Z, PRESSURE, VELOCITY ]
with open(FilePath, 'a') as csvfile:
           filewriter = csv.writer(csvfile,lineterminator='\n')
           filewriter.writerow(FieldData)


I hope this will be useful.

Best regards,

Miguel

Subject: [Paraview] Clip a domain using a close surface

Dear users,
I need to write in a .csv file some PointData from a slice.
I wrote my point values inside a ?for? cycle thus I would maintain only one .csv file and append each time the new data to this.
For this I have created the following commands in my script:


                # create a new 'Pass Arrays'
                passArrays1 = PassArrays(Input=calculator7)
                UpdatePipeline()

                # Properties modified on passArrays1
                passArrays1.PointDataArrays = ['pressure', 'velocity']
                UpdatePipeline()

                # Create a new 'SpreadSheet View'
                spreadSheetView1 = CreateView('SpreadSheetView')
                spreadSheetView1.ColumnToSort = ''
                spreadSheetView1.BlockSize = 1024L
                # uncomment following to set a specific view size
                # spreadSheetView1.ViewSize = [400, 400]

                # export view
                ExportView('C:/Users/acaffagni/Desktop/ciao.csv', ?a?,view=spreadSheetView1)


Unfortunately, the program stop itself at the ?Properties modified on passArrays1?, without updating the pipeline.
Maybe it exists a more smart way to create this .csv file.

Thanks a lot for the suggestions,
Andrea

Hi Miguel

When using the Python Programmble Filter, the current directory is the one
you have run ParaView from.
You can use relative directory to this one, if that helps you, but I would
not recommend it.

There is currently no way to have a relative path to the xml plugin
directory in the default values of a xml property.

I would simply recommend to put the content of "MY_PLUGIN.py" in the xml of
your plugin.

Best,

Mathieu Westphal

Subject: [Paraview] generic NetCDFreader support for CellData
Message-ID: <2C101C0C5987C841B9D69F7543CCEFB11EFF3029@WP0045.soliscom.uu.nl>

Hi,

I was wondering whether it is possible to read NetCDF files as CellData.

I have categorial data on Cartesian coordinates that I want to visualize. To be more specific, the data represents lithologies of the subsurface. So 1 = sand, 3 = clay, 5 = rock.
The problem is that my file is automatically interpreted as PointData. To render this PointData, Paraview than consequently interpolates to achieve cell values.
With most variables that is not such a problem, but here it is. If I have sand (1) overlying rock (5), Paraview shows me clay (3).

Also, the information available to me was ambiguous,
-this source says it is probably not possible:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2017-September/040984.html
-this states it is possible return Cell Data information:
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.NetCDFReader.html

I tried converting my data from NetCDF to a .vtr file in Python, but this resulted in more problems than solutions. (Just gave me very glitched rendering).

So I have two questions:
-Is this possible?
-Are there any workarounds you can think of to get my data as CellData in Paraview?

I'm using Paraview v5.4.1 on Windows 7.

Kind regards,
Joeri

Joeri,

You can try the "Point Data to Cell Data" filter, but that averages the
point data and places the results in the cell data. You may wind up with
some incorrect values using that approach.

Better would be to use a "Progammable Filter" to resize the cartesian grid
read by the NetCDF reader and treat the point data as cell data. That is a
bit involved, but not terrible. Set the Script to

dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())


This assumes that the NetCDF reader is producing a vtkImageData (you can
check under the Information panel) which would report the Type: of the data
set as "Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid).

HTH,
Cory

Thank you Cory,

I sense this solution might work. However, the type of my data is ?Rectilinear Grid?, not sure if that increases the complexity (dx = 1000, dy = 1000, dz = 1).
Regardless, the script you provided does not give me output and it also does not throw an error, so I?m left a bit in the dark here.

Subject: [Paraview] Expanding cylinder clip
Message-ID: <1525278287656.13899@sandia.gov>

I have a user that wants to see how quickly water flows out of a commercial water tank, if it has a seam split.  If the tank doesn't change diameter, this is easy - how much water is outside of a cylinder clip.  But, if the tank is expanding (due to damage), is there a way to have the radius of the cylinder clip increase to follow a cell on the tank?


Thanks,


Alan

David,

Thanks very much for that ? that works and works well.   My filter now runs ~15 times faster than it did before I incorporated this.

I?m always impressed by the helpfulness of this board.

This does what you are looking for:

import vtk



# copy entire structure across

self.GetOutputDataObject(0).ShallowCopy(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0))



# use pass arrays to extract a copy with one array of interest

myArrays=vtk.vtkPassArrays()

myArrays.SetInputDataObject(self.GetInputDataObject(0,0))

myArrays.ClearArrays()

myArrays.AddPointDataArray('DISPL')

myArrays.AddCellDataArray('')

myArrays.AddFieldDataArray('')



# use point2cell to operate on the one array we care about

p2c = vtk.vtkPointDataToCellData()

p2c.SetInputConnection(myArrays.GetOutputPort())

p2c.Update()



# iterate over blocks and copy in the result

iter=dsa.MultiCompositeDataIterator([p2c.GetOutputDataObject(0), output])

for  in_block,  output_block in iter:

     output_block.GetCellData().AddArray(in_block.VTKObject.GetCellData().GetArray('DISPL'))

I have not called filters within the Programmable Filter before and I am not getting things hooked up correctly.     My attempt is attached.   Clearly, I do not understand how to hook the output of 1 filter to the input of the next because I?m getting to the end and getting something with no blocks and no cells.

Any hints?

 WARNING - External email; exercise caution.



The pass arrays filter comes to mind.

If creating withing your python programmable filter it will be called vtk.vtkPassArrays then follow that with a vtk.vtkPointDataToCellData.

All,

Well, this list solved my problem so easily (and made me feel slightly less than the sharpest pencil in the box) yesterday, so I thought I?d try again.

I am doing some Python calcs inside a programmable filter and some of the results I want to average from the Points onto the Cells.   But,  I don?t want all my PointData moved over to CellData ? I want to transfer some of them over within my Filter.

Right now I?m looping thru all the elements and finding all their nodes, then averaging them and assigning to the cells.  It is dog slow and is choking off the usefulness of this filter.

Is there anything like vtkPointDataToCellData that lets me specify which quantities to convert ? could I do something tricky like store original list of PointData, make up a new list, then run PointDataToCellData, then restore the list of PointData ??

I realize this may have all sorts of unexpected side effects, so I?m just asking!

Thanks again, this group is great!

Dennis

Ah. From the documentation: "To define a vtkRectilinearGrid
<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRectilinearGrid.html>, you
must specify the dimensions of the data and provide three arrays of values
specifying the coordinates along the x-y-z axes". It should be a similar
script, but you'd have to add an additional X, Y, and Z position at the end
of those coordinate arrays. So your script would look more like:

dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())


# Set coordinates

xCoords = inputs[0].GetXCoordinates().NewInstance()

xCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetXCoordinates())

xCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should a reasonable x value for your
dataset larger than previous max x

output.SetXCoordinates(xCoords)


yCoords = inputs[0].GetYCoordinates().NewInstance()

yCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetYCoordinates())

yCoords.InsertNextValue(1.5) # Should be a reasonable like the x coordinate

output.SetYCoordinates(yCoords)


zCoords = inputs[0].GetZCoordinates().NewInstance()

zCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetZCoordinates())

zCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should be a reasonable like the z coordinate

output.SetZCoordinates(zCoords)


Some extent information also needs to be supplied, but I'm not entirely
clear on how to do that correctly.

A better solution would be to add an option to the reader to take care of
this for you if that is reasonable for your data.

Best,
Cory

The NetCDF Generic/CF reader has an option named ?Output Type? that you can use to force the output to a vtkImageData. Then Cory?s original programmable filter will work, and you won?t have to deal with the coordinates.

xCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should a reasonable x value for your dataset larger than previous max x

output.SetXCoordinates(xCoords)



yCoords = inputs[0].GetYCoordinates().NewInstance()

yCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetYCoordinates())

yCoords.InsertNextValue(1.5) # Should be a reasonable like the x coordinate

output.SetYCoordinates(yCoords)



zCoords = inputs[0].GetZCoordinates().NewInstance()

zCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetZCoordinates())

zCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should be a reasonable like the z coordinate

output.SetZCoordinates(zCoords)


Some extent information also needs to be supplied, but I'm not entirely clear on how to do that correctly.


A better solution would be to add an option to the reader to take care of this for you if that is reasonable for your data.

Best,
Cory


Regardless, the script you provided does not give me output and it also does not throw an error, so I?m left a bit in the dark here.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] generic NetCDFreader support for CellData

Joeri,

You can try the "Point Data to Cell Data" filter, but that averages the point data and places the results in the cell data. You may wind up with some incorrect values using that approach.

Better would be to use a "Progammable Filter" to resize the cartesian grid read by the NetCDF reader and treat the point data as cell data. That is a bit involved, but not terrible. Set the Script to


dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())


This assumes that the NetCDF reader is producing a vtkImageData (you can check under the Information panel) which would report the Type: of the data set as "Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid).

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

I was wondering whether it is possible to read NetCDF files as CellData.

I have categorial data on Cartesian coordinates that I want to visualize. To be more specific, the data represents lithologies of the subsurface. So 1 = sand, 3 = clay, 5 = rock.
The problem is that my file is automatically interpreted as PointData. To render this PointData, Paraview than consequently interpolates to achieve cell values.
With most variables that is not such a problem, but here it is. If I have sand (1) overlying rock (5), Paraview shows me clay (3).

Also, the information available to me was ambiguous,
-this source says it is probably not possible:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2017-September/040984.html
-this states it is possible return Cell Data information:
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.NetCDFReader.html

I tried converting my data from NetCDF to a .vtr file in Python, but this resulted in more problems than solutions. (Just gave me very glitched rendering).

So I have two questions:
-Is this possible?
-Are there any workarounds you can think of to get my data as CellData in Paraview?

I?m using Paraview v5.4.1 on Windows 7.

Kind regards,
Joeri

Alan,

You could try to fit a cylinder to the tank and clip the way you suggest,
but that would be a little bit involved and may not be accurate of the tank
is distorted significantly.

You can potentially used a signed distance function from the tank surface
to compute what is inside vs. outside. Distances from the surface to points
inside the tank will be negative (hence the signed distance), and distances
outside the tank will be positive. There will be some funniness near the
crack, but it shouldn't be to bad. I could do this in a Programmable Filter
using vtkImplicityPolyDataDistance to compute the signed distance from the
tank to points in cells representing the water. The big advantage is you
wouldn't have to do any cylinder fitting and it could accommodate large
deformations to the tank.

Is the tank a vtkPolyData or is it vtkUnstructuredGrid? If it is the
latter, we'd have to extract the inside boundary, otherwise all the
distances will be positive and the above technique won't work. I would have
to think a bit on how to do that.

Cheers,
Cory

Subject: Re: [Paraview] write csv file

Hello Andrea,

Maybe a Programmable Filter would be a better way. I use this approach to create csv files with data comming from slices:


import csv

#Create an empty csv file with headers:
FilePath = "C:/Users/Miguel Angel AGUIRRE/Desktop/DataOutput.csv"
Headers=["X","Y","Z","PRESSURE","VELOCITY"]
with open(FilePath, 'wb') as csvfile:
        filewriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',')
        filewriter.writerow(Headers)

# Get array data from input:
X = inputs[0].Points[:,0][0]
Y = inputs[0].Points[:,1][0]
Z = inputs[0].Points[:,2][0]
PRESSURE = inputs[0] .GetPointData().GetArray(" PRESSURE ")
VELOCITY  = inputs[0] .GetPointData().GetArray("  VELOCITY  ")


# Add this data to the file (you can use an interation here if you want to do add info comming from several slices)
FieldData=[X,Y,Z, PRESSURE, VELOCITY ]
with open(FilePath, 'a') as csvfile:
           filewriter = csv.writer(csvfile,lineterminator='\n')
           filewriter.writerow(FieldData)


I hope this will be useful.

Best regards,

Miguel

Dear users,
I need to write in a .csv file some PointData from a slice.
I wrote my point values inside a ?for? cycle thus I would maintain only one .csv file and append each time the new data to this.
For this I have created the following commands in my script:


                # create a new 'Pass Arrays'
                passArrays1 = PassArrays(Input=calculator7)
                UpdatePipeline()

                # Properties modified on passArrays1
                passArrays1.PointDataArrays = ['pressure', 'velocity']
                UpdatePipeline()

                # Create a new 'SpreadSheet View'
                spreadSheetView1 = CreateView('SpreadSheetView')
                spreadSheetView1.ColumnToSort = ''
                spreadSheetView1.BlockSize = 1024L
                # uncomment following to set a specific view size
                # spreadSheetView1.ViewSize = [400, 400]

                # export view
                ExportView('C:/Users/acaffagni/Desktop/ciao.csv', ?a?,view=spreadSheetView1)


Unfortunately, the program stop itself at the ?Properties modified on passArrays1?, without updating the pipeline.
Maybe it exists a more smart way to create this .csv file.

Thanks a lot for the suggestions,
Andrea

Dear users,
I need to find the absolute minimum value on a slice of a certain scalar (like pressure).
I would get this point using the interpolation in order to avoid the ?sensitivity? to the mesh (in this way, theoretically, if I change the mesh the minimum should always remain at the same point).
For this point I would like to get the three-dimensional position and the value of the scalar in question (pressure and/or velocity), maybe I can use the numpy functions in a programmable filter?

But I have not idea of how use the interpolation?

Thank you Mathieu for your suggestion,
But if I understand correctly with this method I?m able to find only the value on the mesh points.
Thus, if I change the mesh with finer or coarser elements the value and the location that I can find change.
I would like to avoid this behavior, for this reason I would get the minimum value using the interpolated value on the slice.
do you think it's possible to do it? can I manage this with a programmable filter (work from script without gui)?

Best Regards,
Andrea

Subject: [Paraview] isosurfaces & slices, lights/shadows
Message-ID: <5AEAC677.5000102@recom-services.de>

Dear users,

I am having some problem visualizing isosurfaces/contours in combination 
with slices. Usually I switch off all lights to get nice coloring:
/
renderView1.UseLight = 0               # for slices etc.
/
(Output without isosurface attached: temp.jpg)

When I include an isosurface using contour-filter, it looks totally 
'flat', there are no contours or shadows visible.
(Output with ugly isosurface attached: temp-iso-nolight.jpg)

What I tried to do was switch on lighting and include additional lights 
with intensity 0.6 (to prevent getting too dark coloring of the slices).
/
renderView1.UseLight = 1               # for slices etc.
light1 = AddLight(view=renderView1)    # for contour on isosurfaces !!!
light1.Coords    = 'Ambient'           # position-less == camera
light1.Intensity = 0.6                 # dim intensity [0:1]
/
(Output with nice isosurface attached: temp-iso-light-addlight06.jpg).

Still the problem: while I get a nice isosurface and the vertical slice 
is looking okay, the horizontal slices are still darker than the ones in 
the default screenshot (see: temp-iso-light-addlight06.jpg vs temp.jpg).

Is there a way, to turn on/off lights on single objects in my pipeline?
Is it possible to include something like shading directly to the isosurface?
Any other ideas!?

Thanks,

Michael

Thanks everybody for the support,

I followed Ken?s suggestion, which will simplify things, however when I put Cory?s original script in the programmable filter no Data Array can be found in the output. So I sense there is a (small) bug in the script?
I tried changing the last three lines to the oneliner output.GetCellData().SetScalars(inputs[0].GetPointData().GetScalars())
But that did not help.

I have uploaded a small subset of my data here for you to toy around with https://coeri.stackstorage.com/s/0vUfQkVyv2MD3Ml. (Note: It helps for visualization to stretch the z-axis by a factor 3000).
This perhaps helps you with helping me.

The NetCDF Generic/CF reader has an option named ?Output Type? that you can use to force the output to a vtkImageData. Then Cory?s original programmable filter will work, and you won?t have to deal with the coordinates.

Thank you Cory,

I sense this solution might work. However, the type of my data is ?Rectilinear Grid?, not sure if that increases the complexity (dx = 1000, dy = 1000, dz = 1).

Ah. From the documentation: "To define a vtkRectilinearGrid<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRectilinearGrid.html>, you must specify the dimensions of the data and provide three arrays of values specifying the coordinates along the x-y-z axes". It should be a similar script, but you'd have to add an additional X, Y, and Z position at the end of those coordinate arrays. So your script would look more like:

dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())



# Set coordinates

xCoords = inputs[0].GetXCoordinates().NewInstance()

xCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetXCoordinates())

xCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should a reasonable x value for your dataset larger than previous max x

output.SetXCoordinates(xCoords)



yCoords = inputs[0].GetYCoordinates().NewInstance()

yCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetYCoordinates())

yCoords.InsertNextValue(1.5) # Should be a reasonable like the x coordinate

output.SetYCoordinates(yCoords)



zCoords = inputs[0].GetZCoordinates().NewInstance()

zCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetZCoordinates())

zCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should be a reasonable like the z coordinate

output.SetZCoordinates(zCoords)


Some extent information also needs to be supplied, but I'm not entirely clear on how to do that correctly.

A better solution would be to add an option to the reader to take care of this for you if that is reasonable for your data.

Best,
Cory

Regardless, the script you provided does not give me output and it also does not throw an error, so I?m left a bit in the dark here.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] generic NetCDFreader support for CellData

Joeri,

You can try the "Point Data to Cell Data" filter, but that averages the point data and places the results in the cell data. You may wind up with some incorrect values using that approach.

Better would be to use a "Progammable Filter" to resize the cartesian grid read by the NetCDF reader and treat the point data as cell data. That is a bit involved, but not terrible. Set the Script to


dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())


This assumes that the NetCDF reader is producing a vtkImageData (you can check under the Information panel) which would report the Type: of the data set as "Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid).

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

I was wondering whether it is possible to read NetCDF files as CellData.

I have categorial data on Cartesian coordinates that I want to visualize. To be more specific, the data represents lithologies of the subsurface. So 1 = sand, 3 = clay, 5 = rock.
The problem is that my file is automatically interpreted as PointData. To render this PointData, Paraview than consequently interpolates to achieve cell values.
With most variables that is not such a problem, but here it is. If I have sand (1) overlying rock (5), Paraview shows me clay (3).

Also, the information available to me was ambiguous,
-this source says it is probably not possible:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2017-September/040984.html
-this states it is possible return Cell Data information:
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.NetCDFReader.html

I tried converting my data from NetCDF to a .vtr file in Python, but this resulted in more problems than solutions. (Just gave me very glitched rendering).

So I have two questions:
-Is this possible?
-Are there any workarounds you can think of to get my data as CellData in Paraview?

I?m using Paraview v5.4.1 on Windows 7.

Kind regards,
Joeri

We can't yet restrict lights to specific objects.

However you can get the effect you want by turning up the ambient
intensity and turning off the diffuse intensity on the objects you
want to be independent of the light (the slices).

See Ambient and Diffuse sliders in the GUI or from python do something
like the following:
obj = FindSource("Slice1")
rep = GetRepresentation()
rep.Diffuse = 0
rep.Ambient = 1

Indeed, my original script is not quite right. Here is a more robust
version that should copy all point data arrays to cell data arrays:

dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].PointData

outputCd = output.CellData

for array in inputPd:

  print(type(array))

  outputCd.append(array, array.GetName())

I hope that does it. It works in my ParaView 5.5 with the sample data you
provided (thank you for providing that!).

Best regards,
Cory

Andrea,

Are your mesh cells linear (and hence linear interpolation would be used)?
If so, then the minimum will always be at a mesh point. If they are higher
order elements, then indeed the minimum could be somewhere inside a cell.
Others on the list may be able to tell you if there is a way to find this
minimum point in VTK.

Best regards,
Cory

Unfortunately I am using polyhedral/ hexa mesh with higher order scheme, find the minimum on a mesh point is a good start.
But if someone know a programmable filter that, using VTK is able to find the minimum would be a lot useful.
The method would be very robust and not very sensitive to variations in the mesh that may undergo slight variations.
Do you have any ideas for how to use vtk and / or numpy for this purpose?

Andrea

Hi Andrea,
If your are using ParaView, you can obtain this information quite easilly by showing your dataset in a Spreadsheet view and orderinng the data by "Pressure".

Thanks a lot, this works fine.

I always thought the other way round, that I got to keep lights off and 
modify the contour/isofsurface...

Guys,

Just wanted to wrap up loose ends on this.

It turned out the arctan2 call was not the problem ? most of the time was spent averaging the nodal values onto the cells, but a separate thread has enabled me to call vtkPointDataToCellData for selected variables within my Programmable Filter.  The filter is now ~ 15 times faster than before and my users have stopped grumbling (won?t last though!!)

Thanks for all the support!
Dennis

Cory,

No, I?m using numpy.arctan2 ? sorry, always think of it as atan2.

What I?m doing now is:

   # Undeformed Sector Angles (degrees about Y-axis, 0=FP)
   numPts=block.GetNumberOfPoints()
   node_angles=zeros( (numPts,1) )
                           x_undef,y_undef,z_undef=calc_node_undeformed_coords(block)
   node_angles=arctan2(x_undef,z_undef)*180.0/pi
return node_angles

So, I?m not looping, as you suggest.   I am later doing a custom point-data-to-cell-data by looping over millions of cells and finding each cells nodes and averaging them, but I?ve failed to get vtk.vtkPointDataToCellData to work inside my Programmable filter, so I don?t have a good alternative.

I keep meaning to take out the cell angles and see how much that speeds it up, but haven?t done that yet.

Thanks for looking at this.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXT] RE: [EXTERNAL] Calculating cylindrical coordinates

Dennis,

First, do you mean numpy.arctan2? I don't see that numpy.atan2 exists,but math.atan2 exists.

Second, I suspect you are looping over millions of points in Python and are calling numpy.arctan2 on single X, Y values. Looping in Python like that will be very slow. Instead, you can get all your X values into one numpy array and do the same with your Y values, then make a single call to numpy.atan2. Here's an example:


>>> from paraview.simple import *

>>> import numpy

>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> y = [5, 6, 7, 8]

>>> numpy.arctan2(y, x)

array([ 1.37340077, 1.24904577, 1.16590454, 1.10714872])

To get the X and Y arrays, you can use the numpy adapter:


>>> from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa

>>> wrappedData = dsa.WrapDataObject(polydata)

>>> X = wrappedData.Points[:,0]

>>> Y = wrappedData.Points[:,1]

>>> result = numpy.arctan2(Y, X)

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi Dennis,

You can calculate cylindrical coordinates by utilizing vtkCylindricalTransform within the python programmable filter. It is something like below and faster than numpy.

---
import vtk

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()

transform = vtk.vtkCylindricalTransform()

transformFilter = vtk.vtkTransformFilter()
transformFilter.SetInputData(input)
transformFilter.SetTransform(transform.GetInverse())
transformFilter.Update()

output.ShallowCopy(transformFilter.GetOutput())
---

This converts (x,y,z) coordinates to (r,theta,z) coordinates by GetInverse method,
where the angles are calculated by the following equation to change range to [0, 2*pi]:
  theta = pi + atan2(-y, -x).

Alan,

Yes, I am calling it many times at the same angular location, but it?s tough to know you?re at the same angular location without calculating the angle.

Also, C++ is definitely orders of magnitude quicker, but once I have to compile routines into Paravew life gets very complicated.   We barely survived compiling for cluster use and I haven?t written C++ for at least 20 years.

So, if possible, I would like a clever external add-on that wouldn?t require us to re-compile PV everytime we update our version.   I have visions of library errors in my nightmares!

 CAUTION: EXTERNAL email. Please think before clicking on any links or attachments.



Are there places on the cylinder you are calling atan2 with the same inputs, returning the same data, lots of times?  Alternatively, could you calculate this in the simulation, and just add it to the simulation output?  I am speculating that a C++ call to atan2 may be faster than numpy?

All,

If I wanted to run atan2(X,Y) on millions and millions of nodes to calculate cylindrical coordinates, but found that numpy.atan2 in a Programmable Filter was taking 45 minutes to run,   what should I do to make it much faster?

Thanks for any hints

Thank you Cory,

That indeed worked on the toy example, but when I tried it on my full dataset (uploaded here as well) Paraview v5.4.1 had trouble rendering it (only rendered part of the outer sides, when activating coloring).
I think it is not the script now giving issues, but the renderer. As I experience similar issues previously with celldata loaded from a .VTR file (I assumed that that file was corrupted).
It seems to me that when you go beyond a certain amount of cells, Paraview does not render its output properly.

Could you test whether it works for you on v5.5?

I uploaded my full dataset here:
https://coeri.stackstorage.com/s/ztga1yLO8mjD1EO

To visualize data properly:
Put a threshold filter and filter out 0.0 (as that is NoData) by putting minimum on 0.5, furthermore stretch the z direction by a factor 3000.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] generic NetCDFreader support for CellData

Indeed, my original script is not quite right. Here is a more robust version that should copy all point data arrays to cell data arrays:


dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].PointData

outputCd = output.CellData

for array in inputPd:

  print(type(array))

  outputCd.append(array, array.GetName())
I hope that does it. It works in my ParaView 5.5 with the sample data you provided (thank you for providing that!).

Best regards,
Cory

The NetCDF Generic/CF reader has an option named ?Output Type? that you can use to force the output to a vtkImageData. Then Cory?s original programmable filter will work, and you won?t have to deal with the coordinates.

I sense this solution might work. However, the type of my data is ?Rectilinear Grid?, not sure if that increases the complexity (dx = 1000, dy = 1000, dz = 1).

Ah. From the documentation: "To define a vtkRectilinearGrid<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRectilinearGrid.html>, you must specify the dimensions of the data and provide three arrays of values specifying the coordinates along the x-y-z axes". It should be a similar script, but you'd have to add an additional X, Y, and Z position at the end of those coordinate arrays. So your script would look more like:

dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())



# Set coordinates

xCoords = inputs[0].GetXCoordinates().NewInstance()

xCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetXCoordinates())

xCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should a reasonable x value for your dataset larger than previous max x

output.SetXCoordinates(xCoords)



yCoords = inputs[0].GetYCoordinates().NewInstance()

yCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetYCoordinates())

yCoords.InsertNextValue(1.5) # Should be a reasonable like the x coordinate

output.SetYCoordinates(yCoords)



zCoords = inputs[0].GetZCoordinates().NewInstance()

zCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetZCoordinates())

zCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should be a reasonable like the z coordinate

output.SetZCoordinates(zCoords)


Some extent information also needs to be supplied, but I'm not entirely clear on how to do that correctly.

A better solution would be to add an option to the reader to take care of this for you if that is reasonable for your data.

Best,
Cory

Regardless, the script you provided does not give me output and it also does not throw an error, so I?m left a bit in the dark here.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] generic NetCDFreader support for CellData

Joeri,

You can try the "Point Data to Cell Data" filter, but that averages the point data and places the results in the cell data. You may wind up with some incorrect values using that approach.

Better would be to use a "Progammable Filter" to resize the cartesian grid read by the NetCDF reader and treat the point data as cell data. That is a bit involved, but not terrible. Set the Script to


dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())


This assumes that the NetCDF reader is producing a vtkImageData (you can check under the Information panel) which would report the Type: of the data set as "Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid).

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

I was wondering whether it is possible to read NetCDF files as CellData.

I have categorial data on Cartesian coordinates that I want to visualize. To be more specific, the data represents lithologies of the subsurface. So 1 = sand, 3 = clay, 5 = rock.
The problem is that my file is automatically interpreted as PointData. To render this PointData, Paraview than consequently interpolates to achieve cell values.
With most variables that is not such a problem, but here it is. If I have sand (1) overlying rock (5), Paraview shows me clay (3).

Also, the information available to me was ambiguous,
-this source says it is probably not possible:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2017-September/040984.html
-this states it is possible return Cell Data information:
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.NetCDFReader.html

I tried converting my data from NetCDF to a .vtr file in Python, but this resulted in more problems than solutions. (Just gave me very glitched rendering).

So I have two questions:
-Is this possible?
-Are there any workarounds you can think of to get my data as CellData in Paraview?

I?m using Paraview v5.4.1 on Windows 7.

Kind regards,
Joeri

ParaView is regularly used to render data much larger than your full
example, which is around 6 million cells, so unless you are running out of
RAM on your graphics card, I don't think that is it.

I suspect the problem is that the full data is by default read as a
Rectilinear Grid instead of a Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid). Did you
remember to change the Output Type to "Image"? Do that, then create a
Programmable Filter with the script. It works for me:

[image: image.png]

You might be running into a bug with the Programmable Filter that occurs
when the output data type of its input changes. If you change the Output
Type to "Image", make sure you add a new Programmable Filter after applying
your change, otherwise you may run into this bug.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Cory,

I had put OutputType on Image, and afterwards added the Programmable Filter.
[cid:image001.jpg at 01D3E309.A2F59290]

This is what I roughly expect to see (shown is the PointData):
[cid:image002.jpg at 01D3E309.A2F59290]

But this is what I get as CellData:
[cid:image003.jpg at 01D3E309.A2F59290]

I have had similar issues like this before with CellData. I will try at my home computer whether it works there (see if it is not a bad installation I have)
Note: I run Paraview on Windows 7, I have Windows 10 at home.

Thank you Cory,

That indeed worked on the toy example, but when I tried it on my full dataset (uploaded here as well) Paraview v5.4.1 had trouble rendering it (only rendered part of the outer sides, when activating coloring).
I think it is not the script now giving issues, but the renderer. As I experience similar issues previously with celldata loaded from a .VTR file (I assumed that that file was corrupted).
It seems to me that when you go beyond a certain amount of cells, Paraview does not render its output properly.

ParaView is regularly used to render data much larger than your full example, which is around 6 million cells, so unless you are running out of RAM on your graphics card, I don't think that is it.

I suspect the problem is that the full data is by default read as a Rectilinear Grid instead of a Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid). Did you remember to change the Output Type to "Image"? Do that, then create a Programmable Filter with the script. It works for me:

[image.png]
You might be running into a bug with the Programmable Filter that occurs when the output data type of its input changes. If you change the Output Type to "Image", make sure you add a new Programmable Filter after applying your change, otherwise you may run into this bug.

HTH,
Cory


Could you test whether it works for you on v5.5?

I uploaded my full dataset here:
https://coeri.stackstorage.com/s/ztga1yLO8mjD1EO

To visualize data properly:
Put a threshold filter and filter out 0.0 (as that is NoData) by putting minimum on 0.5, furthermore stretch the z direction by a factor 3000.

Indeed, my original script is not quite right. Here is a more robust version that should copy all point data arrays to cell data arrays:


dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].PointData

outputCd = output.CellData

for array in inputPd:

  print(type(array))

  outputCd.append(array, array.GetName())
I hope that does it. It works in my ParaView 5.5 with the sample data you provided (thank you for providing that!).

Best regards,
Cory

Thanks everybody for the support,

I followed Ken?s suggestion, which will simplify things, however when I put Cory?s original script in the programmable filter no Data Array can be found in the output. So I sense there is a (small) bug in the script?
I tried changing the last three lines to the oneliner output.GetCellData().SetScalars(inputs[0].GetPointData().GetScalars())
But that did not help.

I have uploaded a small subset of my data here for you to toy around with https://coeri.stackstorage.com/s/0vUfQkVyv2MD3Ml. (Note: It helps for visualization to stretch the z-axis by a factor 3000).
This perhaps helps you with helping me.

The NetCDF Generic/CF reader has an option named ?Output Type? that you can use to force the output to a vtkImageData. Then Cory?s original programmable filter will work, and you won?t have to deal with the coordinates.

Thank you Cory,

I sense this solution might work. However, the type of my data is ?Rectilinear Grid?, not sure if that increases the complexity (dx = 1000, dy = 1000, dz = 1).

Ah. From the documentation: "To define a vtkRectilinearGrid<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRectilinearGrid.html>, you must specify the dimensions of the data and provide three arrays of values specifying the coordinates along the x-y-z axes". It should be a similar script, but you'd have to add an additional X, Y, and Z position at the end of those coordinate arrays. So your script would look more like:

dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())



# Set coordinates

xCoords = inputs[0].GetXCoordinates().NewInstance()

xCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetXCoordinates())

xCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should a reasonable x value for your dataset larger than previous max x

output.SetXCoordinates(xCoords)



yCoords = inputs[0].GetYCoordinates().NewInstance()

yCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetYCoordinates())

yCoords.InsertNextValue(1.5) # Should be a reasonable like the x coordinate

output.SetYCoordinates(yCoords)



zCoords = inputs[0].GetZCoordinates().NewInstance()

zCoords.DeepCopy(inputs[0].GetZCoordinates())

zCoords.InsertNextValue(1.0) # Should be a reasonable like the z coordinate

output.SetZCoordinates(zCoords)


Some extent information also needs to be supplied, but I'm not entirely clear on how to do that correctly.

A better solution would be to add an option to the reader to take care of this for you if that is reasonable for your data.

Best,
Cory

Regardless, the script you provided does not give me output and it also does not throw an error, so I?m left a bit in the dark here.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] generic NetCDFreader support for CellData

Joeri,

You can try the "Point Data to Cell Data" filter, but that averages the point data and places the results in the cell data. You may wind up with some incorrect values using that approach.

Better would be to use a "Progammable Filter" to resize the cartesian grid read by the NetCDF reader and treat the point data as cell data. That is a bit involved, but not terrible. Set the Script to


dims = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()

output.SetDimensions(dims[0]+1, dims[1]+1, dims[2]+1)

output.SetExtent(ext[0], ext[1]+1, ext[2], ext[3]+1, ext[4], ext[5]+1)

inputPd = inputs[0].GetPointData()

outputCd = output.GetCellData()

outputCd.SetScalars(inputPd.GetScalars())


This assumes that the NetCDF reader is producing a vtkImageData (you can check under the Information panel) which would report the Type: of the data set as "Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid).

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

I was wondering whether it is possible to read NetCDF files as CellData.

I have categorial data on Cartesian coordinates that I want to visualize. To be more specific, the data represents lithologies of the subsurface. So 1 = sand, 3 = clay, 5 = rock.
The problem is that my file is automatically interpreted as PointData. To render this PointData, Paraview than consequently interpolates to achieve cell values.
With most variables that is not such a problem, but here it is. If I have sand (1) overlying rock (5), Paraview shows me clay (3).

Also, the information available to me was ambiguous,
-this source says it is probably not possible:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2017-September/040984.html
-this states it is possible return Cell Data information:
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.NetCDFReader.html

I tried converting my data from NetCDF to a .vtr file in Python, but this resulted in more problems than solutions. (Just gave me very glitched rendering).

So I have two questions:
-Is this possible?
-Are there any workarounds you can think of to get my data as CellData in Paraview?

I?m using Paraview v5.4.1 on Windows 7.

Kind regards,
Joeri

Hi,

I am attempting to get ParaView to run in headless mode for a project that I am working on.  After encountering some GL errors  kitware at kitware.com<mailto:kitware at kitware.com> suggested that we start with the ParaViewSuperbuild project here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild; however, we are now getting this error during the Superbuild 5.5 mesa compilation:
/tmp/cct5QMQS.s: Assembler messages:

Any ideas as to what may be causing this?


The details for the previous attempt (before we started trying the Superbuild) are listed below.  Any advice would be much appreciated:

When attempting to run Paraview 5.5 in headless mode using offscreen rendering, I am getting the following error:

/configure --disable-xvmc --disable-glx --disable-dri --with-dri-drivers= --with-gallium-drivers=swrast --enable-texture-float --disable-egl --enable-gallium-osmesa --enable-gallium-llvm=yes --disable-gbm --prefix=/software/paraview/5.5/mesa
I also built a new version of llvm just to be on the safe side.
>From there I compiled Paraview:
#!/bin/bash
ccmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/software/paraview/5.5/RHEL_NOGLX/ \

Sadly, I still get the same opengl errors when trying to run paraview in headless mode. At this point, im a bit stuck.  My guess is I probably missed an option in my mesa build so im hoping kitware might have some insight

 post-processing
Message-ID: <8c03825224d04612d323bd65d4d9781d@free.fr>

Dear All, 

This email is an echo of a previous one where I noticed that for XDMF
format, Node Id and Element one are not explicitely provided (for
performance issue I guess); writing an interface for renumbering
topology (connectivity), datasets and so on is not a problem by itself
(jus more work), but rather the fact that information's are lost
(information's from the solver based on the original mesh for example). 

Thus I'm having a look to Exodus ii format and how I can use y h5 file
(through netCDF I guess and not directly) ... if I'm right it allows
nodes/elements Id's. 

Compared to Xdmf, does somebody want to share his feedback?
(limitations, implementation, performance, parallelisation, and so on) 

Thanks for any help 

Regards 

Paul

Paul,

My own simulation software allows non-sequential, but unique assignment 
of user-specified ID's for Points and Cells. (It is user friendly, and 
requires and provides a wealth of datum checking to see if the input 
datum set is logically connected.)

For what it is worth, the EnSight format supports user-assigned Point 
and Cell ID's.

HOWEVER, the ParaView EnSight Reader which in all other respects appears 
to be bullet proof and supports arbitrary n-vertex polyhedral finite 
elements that my software uses, simply skips the reading and storing of 
the user-assigned Point and Cell ID's.

(I rely heavily on ParaView for post processing and will continue to? 
write out the Point and Cell ID's to the EnSight-formatted simulation 
datum set in the hope that some day ParaView will accept and make use of 
the Point and Cell ID's. )

A possible solution may be the following for identifying Cells -- my 
software writes out Material Model user-assigned ID's "MatID" as Cell 
data. The software's EnSight Writer uses the EnSight Part-construct to 
create a "graphically displayable object" for each domain based on a 
common value for MatID. The user, planning ahead, can artificially give 
one or more Cells a unique MatID. Then ParaView's Extract Block filter 
allows any combination of material domains to be selected for further 
processing/examination.

The attached image is a two-cell example. (Two independent finite 
elements with different Mat ID's and the same material properties but 
with different large-strain formulations each subjected to the same 
strain loop).

Hello all,

Is there somewhere I can find the list of variables and their values 
that the official binaries are compiled from? I would like to reproduce 
this build as a baseline locally and I can't find this documented 
anywhere obvious.

On that train of thought, is there a detailed instructions on how to 
reproduce the official binary builds somewhere as well?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <9be121500176575c672bb3ed40054bf1@free.fr>

Dear all 

Where can I find the topology cell numbers for the xdmf format,
especially for the finite elements (vertex, line, triangle, quad, hex,
pyra, prism and so on)? If I have the VTK numbers, they are different
from the VTK one. 

In the xdmf website site
(http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format), I can see some of
these numbers, but only for linear elements, and line are missing ...
should I use polyline instead? 

_Nota_: from my understanding, the first column is the type of element,
then the nodes connectivity, right? 

Still digging into the docs, and internet, but nothing obvious so far =>
any helpp will be highly appreciated 

Thanks 

Paul

A,

ParaView won?t recognize a column in a table as time. If you instead write out your data as a series of csv files, ParaView will treat each file as a time step and animate through them. So, if you re-write your data in multiple csv files, things get much easier in ParaView.

If you don?t want to re-write your data, I think you can still do what you want to do by using ParaView?s animation. The basic idea is to add a filter that pulls out the data for one time step, and then animate the parameter.

This will probably be clearer with an example. For this example, let?s assume your csv file has 20 time steps with time values 0, 1, 2,?, 19. The steps you could follow to animate time are as follows:


  1.  Load the csv file, convert them to table to points, and visualize them just as you are so far.
  2.  Add the threshold filter. Set the Minimum parameter to just under the first time value (say -0.5 in the example time steps I gave) and set the Maximum parameter to just over the first time value (say 0.5 in this example). This will extract the points of the first time step.
  3.  Open the Animation View (View -> Animation View).
  4.  Add a track for the Threshold filter for Threshold Range (0) (this corresponds to the Minimum value). Double click the track to open up the Animation Keyframes dialog. Set the first value to just under the first time value (-0.5 in this example), to just under the largest value (18.5 in this example).
  5.  Add a track for the Threshold filter for Threshold Range (1) (this corresponds to the Maximum value). Double click the track to open up the Animation Keyframes dialog. Set the first value to just under the first time value (0.5 in this example), to just under the largest value (19.5 in this example).
  6.  In the Animation View, set the number of frames (No. Frames) to the number of time steps in your data (20 in this example).
  7.  Hit play.

Message-ID: <CAN=4zxV9Yz9BAUQBP8vM=AMX4E-s15kan-KmwkpzPb5e25eyFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am referred to this mailing list by a developer at the 3D Slicer forum. I
installed the Paraview v5.5 (and nightly build of 3D Slicer) and both
suffered from the same display issue, i.e., the interface of the software
looks semi-transparent, please see attached picture (in case the picture
does not show correctly, here is the dropbox link to it:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/1bveei3gjg01svb/bbb.png?dl=0). The developer at
the 3D Slicer forum said it might be a video card driver issue and that I
might get more help here. My computer is a desktop, with only one video
card (GTX1080) and the driver version is 397.64 from the Geforce Experience
software. The operating system is Windows 10 64 bit with latest April
Update installed (I haven't tested Paraview before that...)



It also happens on 3D slicer nightly build (05/02) (in case it does not
show correctly, here is the dropbox link to the picture:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqj5yh0hcj5ma7v/aaa.png?dl=0):


BTW, when I first got Paraview v5.5 installed, it threw an OpenGL driver
error upon launching. Then I updated the video card driver to the latest
one and now the error is gone but the interface still seems
semi-transparent.....

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Best,
Junxi

Junxi,

Does your system also have an Intel video chip that it may be using? If so,
ParaView may not be using your NVIDIA driver. You can check by going to the
Help -> About ParaView menu item. What do the Open GL entries say?

To ensure ParaView is using your NVIDIA card, you can try going to the
NVIDIA control panel. Under 3D Settings in the panel on the left, click on
"Manage 3D settings". On the right side, click on the "Global Settings"
tab. Make sure "High-performance NVIDIA processor" is selected. Apply the
changes, then run ParaView again to see if the problem is resolved.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hello Cory,

Thank you for such a quick reply. I checked the OpenGL entries and it is
indeed using the NVIDIA video card. The OpenGL renderer is listed as
GeForce GTX1080/PCIe/SSE2. I search online and although people say my
i7-6700k processor has a built-in 530 graphics card, I do not see it in the
device manager somehow......

I have also tried the NVIDIA control panel. I did not find the High
performance NVIDIA processer you mentioned in the global settings, but I
did change the OpenGL renderer to GTX1080. However, Paraview still cannot
display correctly after applying the changes (so does the 3D Slicer). I am
wondering if you need any system logs to diagnose this issue and I would be
happy to provide them.

Best,
Junxi

Message-ID: <CAGohjxgd=kYf42wMtr-78zP3LQvMgvzk0UFMLecKzhv2DVd8XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have written some FEM code in Matlab that handles 27-noded 3D
unstructured meshed. It reads all the mesh info, including connectivity
matrix, vertex coordinates , etc. from Cubit/Trelis output in ExodusII
format and gives me a mesh object in Matlab. So after FEM processing and
getting my solution, I would like to use Paraview as a postprocessor. So I
wrote a piece of Matlab code so I can write the connectivity matrix,
coordinates, and unknowns ?u? (in this case displacement in 3D [solving
hyperelasticity]) to a vtk file. The only thing I am not sure what I should
use for the 3D 27-noded is the CELL_TYPE  when I am writing to the vtk
file. Is it 12, 25, or something else?  12 seems to work as Paraview shows
me that it has correct number of nodes from the mesh, but when I ask
Paraview to show the nodes, it only shows the vertices as apposed to nodes
on vertices edges, faces and cells. When I use 25, the mesh does not look
correct. It gets distorted and collapsed. The connectivity looks totally
incorrect. These numbers are based on https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightl
y/html/vtkCellType_8h_source.html

I would appreciate any help.

Thanks

Arash

Okay, thanks for checking. We have encountered a number of issues with
Intel graphics in the last year or so, but driver updates have mainly
resolved most of them. That doesn't seem to be the concern here, though.

That should ensure you are using the GTX1080, but it looks like ParaView
already was using it.

I can't think of any system logs that would help. But there are a couple
things you could try.

1). Install an older version of ParaView and see if that works. If it does,
that will help us narrow down possible reasons for the transparency you are
using. ParaView 4.4 would be a good one to try:
https://www.paraview.org/download/

2). Do you have any add-ons to Windows installed that modify the window
system in some way? If so, try disabling or uninstalling those.

Thanks, and sorry for the trouble.

Subject: [Paraview] control comparative render in python?
Message-ID: <CABrYh3quyT3gQnawGTBaKLVv3paXeqi7CsSM7=gnEswGk5t_wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

I have a paraviewweb application that accepts a bunch of options and
produces a nice visualization supplied by a pvpython server -- thank you
all for the help you've offered so far. Everyone is happy with this, but of
course the problem with that is now they want more.

I want to have two windows, side by side, rendering different views of the
same data, or the same view of two different data sources, side by side,
ideally always with the same camera position. This seems like exactly what
the comparative render view was built for. Unfortunately, I can't find how
to control that view through python. The Trace functionality seems
indifferent to whatever I do on the comparative view inspector window, and
I can't find any more than a mention in the Guide.

What is the python that corresponds to setting the MxN size of the
comparison and how do I assign a render to some given sector of my
comparison? Is there more to it than that?

Thank you,

-Tom

That is indeed a bug. I've reported it as an issue here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18164

> I want to have two windows, side by side, rendering different views of

My hunch is comparative view is not what you want. All you want is simply
two views with linked cameras. Are you able to setup the visualizations you
need in the ParaView Qt client? If so, I can provide you hints on how to
convert that to the corresponding Python script.

> What is the python that corresponds to setting the MxN size of the

the view has a "Dimensions" parameter that you change e.g.
view = CreateComparativeRenderView()
view.Dimensions = [ 3, 1]

> and how do I assign a render to some given sector of my comparison? Is
there more to it than that?

you simple use `Show`. You can't assign a dataset to show in a specific
view, that's not what the comparative view is intended for. You show data
in all views and you vary one or more parameters on the pipelines in the
view using the animation tracks in the comparative panel.

Hi Utkarsh:

I understand, perhaps you're right that comparative render is not what I'm
after. What I want is just to see two different data sets using the same
visualization side by side, with cameras linked as they are with the
comparative view. I can create the visualizations I want in the Qt client
or in python. But apparently I could just use some direction on the best
approach to link the cameras and make the views appear side-by-side.

Thank you,

-Tom

Just FYI, the "Link Camera" dialog that you get by right-clicking in a
window also appears not to log whatever it's doing to the Trace output. But
for the next person who finds this note, there seems to be an
AddCameraLink() function to the paraview 'simple' module, that appears to
work like this:

 view1 = simple.CreateView("myfirstview")
 view2 = simple.CreateView("mysecondview")
 simple.AddCameraLink(view1, view2, "arbitraryNameOfLink")

I assume that the Link Camera dialog invokes this function, though it
doesn't appear in the Trace.

Thank you,

 -Tom

All,

I need some pandas functions for some filters.    Pandas, unfortunately is not a simple library (there is no pands.py) - it needs to be installed into your version of python as a module.    How can I get this in Paraview (hopefully, without compiling from source).    Can I install pandas into the python installation included with the PV download?

Thanks

Dennis

Hello Dennis,

Depending on how you want to use pandas within ParaView, one approach that
could work involves creating a virtual environment and installing pandas
there.  Then a couple of lines of python can make modules installed in that
virtualenv available from pvpython.  See this blog post for more
information:

https://blog.kitware.com/using-pvpython-and-virtualenv/

Hello Cory,

I tried a bunch of different versions and found out that those with Qt5
does not work while those with Qt4 looks fine (i.e., v5.3 and above does
not work, the latest version that works is v5.2.0 with Qt4). It seems that
it has something to do with the Qt5. I am wondering if other users are
experiencing similar issues with Qt5?

As for add-ons, do you have a list of specific add-ons that you are
particularly suspicious of? My desktop has a bunch of software installed
but they are either work-related (e.g., Matlab) or seemingly harmless
(e.g., steam). BTW, I don't have Nahimic sound driver, which I saw other
people reporting messing up with Qt.

Best,
Junxi

Scott,

Interesting idea and I was not aware of any of that.

I should be specific that I need to make an xml Server side plugin for general distribution that needs to call pandas to execute.   So I don?t think I can get everyone here to load up that virtual environment and install pandas.

I think I?m hearing that pandas for everyone is not available unless I compile here with an external python, right?

Thanks
Dennis

Hello Dennis,

Depending on how you want to use pandas within ParaView, one approach that could work involves creating a virtual environment and installing pandas there.  Then a couple of lines of python can make modules installed in that virtualenv available from pvpython.  See this blog post for more information:

https://blog.kitware.com/using-pvpython-and-virtualenv/<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kitware.com%2Fusing-pvpython-and-virtualenv%2F&data=01%7C01%7Cdennis_conklin%40goodyear.com%7Cc0392a7911e348a9ddbf08d5b7639c21%7C939e896692854a9a9f040887efe8aae0%7C0&sdata=uJvHsBJNCGSTeklLNAk5QDZ48Ykdf1bdazrnW851AKw%3D&reserved=0>

Subject: [Paraview] layout question, pvpython
Message-ID: <CABrYh3qp565+bthmSdEsBy2vdyhEHkiWjXFezd49tc__epVe4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

I've become accustomed to throwing around render view objects in pvpython,
swapping them in and out of the view with simple.Show() and simple.Hide().
Now I have to learn about layout objects. Can someone suggest the best way
to think about these? Are they containers into which I can drop one or more
render views and move them around, or are they more like molds into which I
can pour a render view and then use the layout as handles with which to
manipulate the views?

Where can I find a list of the methods of a layout object? Or would it be
better to call it a layout proxy?

Thank you,

 -Tom

Tom,

Alas, there's no layout support in pvpython. There indeed is a layout proxy
(vtkSMLayoutProxy), but they rely on the Qt ParaView components to layout
the windows. The proxy itself is the "model", if you will.  And it works
when you execute the layout related updates in the Python shell in the
ParaView UI.

A clumpsy way to set a window's position in Python is:
> view.GetRenderWindow().SetPosition(x, y)

You can use that to lay out the windows, short of doing something more
elaborate with a GUI library.

Hi Dennis,

I'm not sure I understand precisely what you mean when you say "compile
here with an external python".  Do you mean compiling your plugin (which
would imply not a simple xml plugin), or compiling ParaView?  Even if you
compile ParaView on your end with an external python, I don't see how that
will result in something that will allow you to distribute your plugin as
xml.  You could try to distribute a custom ParaView binary (which includes
your new plugin as well as pandas python modules), but for that you would
normally need to use the ParaView superbuild.  Even then I think you would
have to tweak the superbuild to get the python to include pandas.

Hopefully someone out  there with more knowledge can chime in and provide
some hints or suggestions.  Then maybe we'll find out what you want to do
it quite easy, in which case I'll be excited to learn about it :-)

Cheers,
Scott

p.s.  I'm sure you may have read through this before, but just in case (or
for people who come across this later):

Subject: [Paraview] layout question, pvpython

Alas, indeed. Just as I thought I was starting to understand what's going
on. Was I just misled because there is a trace output that has this in it?

# get layout
layout1 = GetLayoutByName("Layout #1")
# split cell
layout1.SplitHorizontal(0, 0.5)


Without layout support, can I use pvpython to present two render views and
link them with a camera link? Can you suggest what direction might succeed?

You may have suggested this already, but I'm not sure the hint about
view.GetRenderWindow().SetPosition(x, y) is enough for me. I don't really
get how that's a way forward. What are you suggesting I use that function
to do?

Thanks,

 -Tom

Thank you, you're very kind. I'm all about functional workarounds these
days. It leads to another question of course, but that's a ParaViewWeb
question, so I'll make it another post.

Thank you,

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewWeb and multiple windows
Message-ID: <CABrYh3qQZHgrQCHMa3cRZPLqbWdbRdhRoKgnVwKe7bsQPu0eiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

I have a ParaViewWeb application going with a pvpython back end, and it
looks great. I want to show views of multiple datasets in it now. I gather
that the layout() methods are not supported in pvpython, so I have to use
separate windows.

I'm creating the render window on the client with this:

const renderer = VtkRenderer.newInstance({ client: model.pvwClient });

I can certainly create two such renderer objects, but I don't see how to
link the Render on my pvpython server to one or the other of the client's
renderer objects.

I assume I've been using some default behavior where my Show() and Update()
commands get sent to the one renderer, but how do I direct them to one or
the other?

Thank you,

 -Tom

You should set the viewId to the VtkRenderer based on which view from the
server you want to be bound to.
To retrieve the view Id on the server side, just call on the python side.

view.GetGlobalDAsString()

I may have small typo for the method name, but in either case the number
you want is the "GlobalID".

HTH,

Seb

Scott,

I assume that if I compile a ParaView executable with pandas included, then I could distribute my plugin as xml and everyone could access it.    I?m a little unsure but I assume I would also have to recompile the server that we are using on an HPC cluster to include pandas.   I?m beginning to see why adding pandas to ParaView has been delayed a few times.

Hi Dennis,

I'm not sure I understand precisely what you mean when you say "compile here with an external python".  Do you mean compiling your plugin (which would imply not a simple xml plugin), or compiling ParaView?  Even if you compile ParaView on your end with an external python, I don't see how that will result in something that will allow you to distribute your plugin as xml.  You could try to distribute a custom ParaView binary (which includes your new plugin as well as pandas python modules), but for that you would normally need to use the ParaView superbuild.  Even then I think you would have to tweak the superbuild to get the python to include pandas.

Hopefully someone out  there with more knowledge can chime in and provide some hints or suggestions.  Then maybe we'll find out what you want to do it quite easy, in which case I'll be excited to learn about it :-)

Cheers,
Scott

Scott,

Interesting idea and I was not aware of any of that.

I should be specific that I need to make an xml Server side plugin for general distribution that needs to call pandas to execute.   So I don?t think I can get everyone here to load up that virtual environment and install pandas.

I think I?m hearing that pandas for everyone is not available unless I compile here with an external python, right?

Thanks

Hello Dennis,

Depending on how you want to use pandas within ParaView, one approach that could work involves creating a virtual environment and installing pandas there.  Then a couple of lines of python can make modules installed in that virtualenv available from pvpython.  See this blog post for more information:

https://blog.kitware.com/using-pvpython-and-virtualenv/<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kitware.com%2Fusing-pvpython-and-virtualenv%2F&data=01%7C01%7Cdennis_conklin%40goodyear.com%7Cc0392a7911e348a9ddbf08d5b7639c21%7C939e896692854a9a9f040887efe8aae0%7C0&sdata=uJvHsBJNCGSTeklLNAk5QDZ48Ykdf1bdazrnW851AKw%3D&reserved=0>

Hope this helps,
Scott

All,

I need some pandas functions for some filters.    Pandas, unfortunately is not a simple library (there is no pands.py) ? it needs to be installed into your version of python as a module.    How can I get this in Paraview (hopefully, without compiling from source).    Can I install pandas into the python installation included with the PV download?

Thanks

Dennis

Thanks for checking all the versions. We have run into some issues with
Qt5, but I had thought we worked through most of them. This is the first
we've encountered with completely transparent render windows and
translucent UI, hence I was wondering if there was something unique on your
system that modified the graphics environment.

Unfortunately, I do not. We have steam installed on some systems that run
ParaView just fine, so I would be surprised if that were the cause. You
could always try removing steam and seeing if ParaView versions 5.2+ work,
but that may be more than you want to do.

You mentioned you have Matlab installed. I believe Matlab ships with Qt and
it may have put its Qt location in your system PATH environment variable.
Try removing (or modifying) your system PATH environment variable so that
ParaView won't find Matlab's Qt instead of the Qt version ParaView ships
with. Some folks have run into this problem in the past and modifying the
PATH was the solution.

Thanks,
Cory

Hello,
Have the same problems here, 5.2 works fine, 5.5 not.

The proposed remedies don?t work on my machine.

I have windows 7, NVIDIA Quadro K2200 with latest drivers.

Matlab was never installed; in my path I cannot find any reference to Qt (?)

Best regards,
Robert

That should ensure you are using the GTX1080, but it looks like ParaView already was using it.

I can't think of any system logs that would help. But there are a couple things you could try.

1). Install an older version of ParaView and see if that works. If it does, that will help us narrow down possible reasons for the transparency you are using. ParaView 4.4 would be a good one to try: https://www.paraview.org/download/

2). Do you have any add-ons to Windows installed that modify the window system in some way? If so, try disabling or uninstalling those.

Thanks, and sorry for the trouble.

There is probably something silly on my part, but my varied attempts at a

for reasons that are over my head.  A typical result is patched below (for
an offline build on v5.5.0-RC2); the cmake intial cache file is attached,
and its output is also attached.  Other details follow.  (The
paraview-superbuild directory has used: git fetch origin; git checkout
master; git submodule update.)

Is there something obvious that I have done wrong?  Thanks much, B. Kashiwa

I  suspect all these issues relate to QOpenGLWidget related changes to
ParaView. We are working on a update to rework that change, it would be
worth trying out the nightly binaries once those changes get merged in.

FYI the work is happening here:

I installed the Paraview v5.5 (and nightly build of 3D Slicer) and both
suffered from the same display issue, i.e., the interface of the software
looks semi-transparent, please see attached picture (in case the picture
does not show correctly, here is the dropbox link to it:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/1bveei3gjg01svb/bbb.png?dl=0). The developer at
the 3D Slicer forum said it might be a video card driver issue and that I
might get more help here. My computer is a desktop, with only one video
card (GTX1080) and the driver version is 397.64 from the Geforce Experience
software. The operating system is Windows 10 64 bit with latest April
Update installed (I haven't tested Paraview before that...)



> It also happens on 3D slicer nightly build (05/02) (in case it does not

https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqj5yh0hcj5ma7v/aaa.png?dl=0):


> BTW, when I first got Paraview v5.5 installed, it threw an OpenGL driver

one and now the error is gone but the interface still seems

I am not sure. A quick grep through the code in ParaView/VTK doesn't yield
a hit. What's the context in which you encountered this?

I?ve never heard of these files either.  From my user:




I am writing planes of data in parallel with XMLMultiBlockWriter and it is generating *pvtm files.  However, paraview doesn?t seem to support this file format for reading?  I am trying to visualize the results and I can read the individual *vtp files, but it doesn?t accept the parallel file.

Then:


I will try to put something together for you soon.  I am writing this dataset from a slice while running catalyst.  I found a work around by using the MergeBlocks filter on the slice and then dumping that as an unstructured grid via XMLPUnstructuredGridWriter.

Back to me.

?.  I am writing this dataset from a slice while running catalyst.?  So, I figured I would start by asking if this is a Catalyst/ ParaView/ VTK file format (that I had never heard of)...    I have asked user for a dataset.

Thanks,

Alan

Hello Cory,

I checked the system path on my computer and I couldn't find anything
related to Qt. I even tried removing Matlab-related entries but it didn't
work either. Is there anything else that I could try?

Best,
Junxi

The .pvtm is the same as the .vtm file, just a redundant file extension.
Really, the .vtm format is parallel/partition aware where as the other .vt*
extensions have a partitioned .pvt* format.

I'm a bit surprised that PV doesn't associate the .pvtm file with
multiblock datasets. If you try to read in a .pvtm file though you just
need to properly associate it with the XML multiblock data reader.

Thanks Andy.  I?m hearing of numerous issues like thus, trying to wrap my head around same.

Let?s start with a few questions.  Where is the .pvtm file format documented?  Google doesn?t know...  Next, why have two redundant file formats?  One should be deprecated.  Why can Catalyst write this file format?  And last, of course, why can?t ParaView read it?

Hi Alan,

I wouldn't describe it as a redundant file format, just a redundant file
extension (like ExodusII with .e, .ex2, etc.). Actually, looking through
the PV and VTK source code, like Utkarsh did before, there doesn't look to
be anything that refers to .pvtm so maybe I'm just remembering things wrong
here. Looking back though (https://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=10498) it
does seem like at one time we used the .pvtm file extension but maybe that
was by accident though.

As for writing out files from Catalyst, or even from ParaView, a user can
select the writer and specify whatever they want for the file extension.
Maybe that's where the issue arose.

Trying to wrap my head around what you said.  Really basic question ? is .pvtm files a viable file format?  Either it should be supported in ParaView readers, or it should be removed from Catalyst and VTK ? correct?

I wrote up a bug here:  https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18172

Hi Alan,

I wouldn't describe it as a redundant file format, just a redundant file extension (like ExodusII with .e, .ex2, etc.). Actually, looking through the PV and VTK source code, like Utkarsh did before, there doesn't look to be anything that refers to .pvtm so maybe I'm just remembering things wrong here. Looking back though (https://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=10498) it does seem like at one time we used the .pvtm file extension but maybe that was by accident though.

As for writing out files from Catalyst, or even from ParaView, a user can select the writer and specify whatever they want for the file extension. Maybe that's where the issue arose.

Best,
Andy

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Re: pvtm file format

The .pvtm is the same as the .vtm file, just a redundant file extension. Really, the .vtm format is parallel/partition aware where as the other .vt* extensions have a partitioned .pvt* format.
I'm a bit surprised that PV doesn't associate the .pvtm file with multiblock datasets. If you try to read in a .pvtm file though you just need to properly associate it with the XML multiblock data reader.

Message-ID: <A358F623-C91B-4CFE-9079-807462C633CC@sandia.gov>

A common workflow for ParaView is to write out animations as a flipbook ? i.e., write out movies as a series of .jpgs or .pngs.  If a person wants to post process these pictures into .avi?s or .mov?s, what tools do people use?  Further, can these tools deal with the case that .avi?s need X and Ys that are mod 4 == 0, where the raw .png?s can be any X and Y?  Does ParaView need the optional ability to force .png?s or .jpg?s to be written out mod 4 == 0?

ffmeg is your friend on linux. It needs a little figuring things out, but
both resizing images and then converting them to videos is possible.

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst session makes ParaView time-unaware
Message-ID: <CAO_imTusrLHxLNKgK2xvg6AJ1ib3AZwpy+MJdeQQQZ88qKSXgg@mail.gmail.com>

 Can somebody explain this problem:

When I connect ParaView to a Catalyst live session (running "cd
Examples/Catalyst/PythonFullExample; pvpython fedriver.py cpscript.py") and
open a "somedata.pvd" file containing a time series, I cannot scroll
through the time steps in the file, because ParaView time is reset to 0 and
no other time steps are available, even if they were available before
establishing the Catalyst connection. The problem remains even after the
Catalyst session has finished and ParaView has disconnected from Catalyst:  the
VCR controls including the  "Time: 0 | 0 ^v" display are disabled (grey).

I am using ParaView 5.5.0 on Ubuntu 18.04 Linux.
In cpscript.py, I have enabled live visualization:
...
# Enable Live-Visualizaton with ParaView
coprocessor.EnableLiveVisualization(True, 1)

I could understand if ParaView's "time" concept doesn't make sense during a
live visualization. Nonetheless, I'd prefer if the live visualization
forwards its current time to ParaView that should use this time as its
latest timestep. Or ParaView should keep its time steps and let the live
visualization run independent from those time steps.
But in no situation should ParaView keep its time controls disabled even
after it has disconnected from Catalyst.

Can you reproduce this problem? Can it be fixed?

Many thanks,
Jussuf

ParaView does adjust image sizes when saving avis, for example. Not sure if
its needed when saving out images.

ffmeg is your friend on linux. It needs a little figuring things out, but both resizing images and then converting them to videos is possible.

A common workflow for ParaView is to write out animations as a flipbook ? i.e., write out movies as a series of .jpgs or .pngs.  If a person wants to post process these pictures into .avi?s or .mov?s, what tools do people use?  Further, can these tools deal with the case that .avi?s need X and Ys that are mod 4 == 0, where the raw .png?s can be any X and Y?  Does ParaView need the optional ability to force .png?s or .jpg?s to be written out mod 4 == 0?

ParaView or several of the 3.* versions (what Ken's old bug report referred
to) I'd say that .pvtm was never officially or even unofficially a VTK file
format extension used by the XML multiblock reader or writer. I'd say that
.vtm is the one and only XML multiblock data extension and close the issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Centers of rotation with multiple views
Message-ID: <D76BE8CC-0728-48DB-9E9E-7C4B2FFD665D@gmail.com>

I have several (5) 3d cubes which I would like to have rotate in sync, each around its own center. However, when I get one centered, some of the others seem to move off-center at the same time. In the image, the 5th cube is centered, but the first four are off to the left. If I center one of the others, all the cubes move a little, some become centered, others not. In particulate the 5th image (far right) is no longer centered.

Any ideas, thoughts, experiences, etc. would be greatly welcomed.

From my investigation and not being able to find any pvtm in either today's ParaView or several of the 3.* versions (what Ken's old bug report referred to) I'd say that .pvtm was never officially or even unofficially a VTK file format extension used by the XML multiblock reader or writer.

Hi Alan,

I wouldn't describe it as a redundant file format, just a redundant file extension (like ExodusII with .e, .ex2, etc.). Actually, looking through the PV and VTK source code, like Utkarsh did before, there doesn't look to be anything that refers to .pvtm so maybe I'm just remembering things wrong here. Looking back though (https://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=10498) it does seem like at one time we used the .pvtm file extension but maybe that was by accident though.

As for writing out files from Catalyst, or even from ParaView, a user can select the writer and specify whatever they want for the file extension. Maybe that's where the issue arose.

Best,
Andy

The .pvtm is the same as the .vtm file, just a redundant file extension. Really, the .vtm format is parallel/partition aware where as the other .vt* extensions have a partitioned .pvt* format.
I'm a bit surprised that PV doesn't associate the .pvtm file with multiblock datasets. If you try to read in a .pvtm file though you just need to properly associate it with the XML multiblock data reader.

If the user did that, then he/she explicitly set the file extension to be
.pvtm instead of the default .vtm when creating the Catalyst multiblock
dataset writer for the Catalyst script. There is only one XML multiblock
data reader and writer.

When a user adds a writer when making a Catalyst Python script by default
it will have the proper file extension but they are allowed to change that
file extension. The file extension that the user gives the filename doesn't
affect the file format itself (i.e. what writer is used).

Does that make sense?

Eric,

I'd suggest apply either the  "Transform" filter or using the
Transformation properties on the *Display* for all of the datasets to
recenter so that the camera linking will work. Camera linking doesn't
support syncing only rotations.

An example: If I make a PNG writer in the code and set the filename it is
supposed to write to "foo.pgn" it will write a file named "foo.pgn" because
that is what it was programmed to do.  The data in the file will still be
in the PNG format, the filename will just have the wrong extension.  It is
still a PNG file and if I rename it to foo.png, most programs will read it
correctly.  But while the extension is misspelled very few programs (if
any) will read it.

Shawn

ParaView used to also be able to save animations as MJPEG AVI
(.avi) files.

Unfortunately, the version currently in Debian GNU/Linux (unstable and
testing) seems to have a regression and is unable to save .avi files.
See my [bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/892293) on the Debian BTS...

My current workaround is:

 ? save animations as PNG images

 ? convert them with

   $ ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 5 -i input.%04d.png \
            -vcodec mjpeg -pix_fmt yuv420p -q:v 3 output.avi


Please note that ParaView used to save .avi files with pixel format
yuvj422p (until it stopped doing so, because of the above mentioned
regression), but I started to use pixel format yuv420p, to work around
a [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/863663) in GStreamer.
With this pixel format the animation may be correctly played by
GStreamer on GNU/Linux and hence, when embedded in a PDF page, by
pdf-presenter-console on GNU/Linux, as well as by Acrobat Reader DC on
Windows...

If anyone knows any better strategy, comments are welcome!

Francesco,

There was a known bug/feature in the .avi writer in ParaView 5.4.1, where it wrote a version of .avi that was not compatible with the OS X Quicktime player (the OS X default) and the Windows Media player.  This has been corrected in ParaView 5.5.0.  (I just tested them on my MacBook.)

An example: If I make a PNG writer in the code and set the filename it is supposed to write to "foo.pgn" it will write a file named "foo.pgn" because that is what it was programmed to do.  The data in the file will still be in the PNG format, the filename will just have the wrong extension.  It is still a PNG file and if I rename it to foo.png, most programs will read it correctly.  But while the extension is misspelled very few programs (if any) will read it.

If the user did that, then he/she explicitly set the file extension to be .pvtm instead of the default .vtm when creating the Catalyst multiblock dataset writer for the Catalyst script. There is only one XML multiblock data reader and writer.

When a user adds a writer when making a Catalyst Python script by default it will have the proper file extension but they are allowed to change that file extension. The file extension that the user gives the filename doesn't affect the file format itself (i.e. what writer is used).
Does that make sense?

From my investigation and not being able to find any pvtm in either today's ParaView or several of the 3.* versions (what Ken's old bug report referred to) I'd say that .pvtm was never officially or even unofficially a VTK file format extension used by the XML multiblock reader or writer. I'd say that .vtm is the one and only XML multiblock data extension and close the issue.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Re: pvtm file format

Hi Alan,

I wouldn't describe it as a redundant file format, just a redundant file extension (like ExodusII with .e, .ex2, etc.). Actually, looking through the PV and VTK source code, like Utkarsh did before, there doesn't look to be anything that refers to .pvtm so maybe I'm just remembering things wrong here. Looking back though (https://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=10498) it does seem like at one time we used the .pvtm file extension but maybe that was by accident though.

As for writing out files from Catalyst, or even from ParaView, a user can select the writer and specify whatever they want for the file extension. Maybe that's where the issue arose.

Best,
Andy

Let?s start with a few questions.  Where is the .pvtm file format documented?  Google doesn?t know...  Next, why have two redundant file formats?  One should be deprecated.  Why can Catalyst write this file format?  And last, of course, why can?t ParaView read it?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Re: pvtm file format

The .pvtm is the same as the .vtm file, just a redundant file extension. Really, the .vtm format is parallel/partition aware where as the other .vt* extensions have a partitioned .pvt* format.
I'm a bit surprised that PV doesn't associate the .pvtm file with multiblock datasets. If you try to read in a .pvtm file though you just need to properly associate it with the XML multiblock data reader.

No problem. We got where we needed to be eventually -- it would  have gone
faster if I didn't "remember" that the .pvtm isn't a proper VTK file
extension :)

If you happen to be on macOS AND you happen to still have a license for Quicktime 7 Pro, that will also create a movie from the images. You can export in whatever format that Quicktime supports.

    Francesco,
    
    There was a known bug/feature in the .avi writer in ParaView 5.4.1, where it wrote a version of .avi that was not compatible with the OS X Quicktime player (the OS X default) and the Windows Media player.  This has been corrected in ParaView 5.5.0.  (I just tested them on my MacBook.)

        ParaView used to also be able to save animations as MJPEG AVI
        (.avi) files.
        
        Unfortunately, the version currently in Debian GNU/Linux (unstable and
        testing) seems to have a regression and is unable to save .avi files.
        See my [bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/892293) on the Debian BTS...
        
        My current workaround is:
        
         ? save animations as PNG images
        
         ? convert them with
        
           $ ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 5 -i input.%04d.png \
                    -vcodec mjpeg -pix_fmt yuv420p -q:v 3 output.avi
        
        
        Please note that ParaView used to save .avi files with pixel format
        yuvj422p (until it stopped doing so, because of the above mentioned
        regression), but I started to use pixel format yuv420p, to work around
        a [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/863663) in GStreamer.
        With this pixel format the animation may be correctly played by
        GStreamer on GNU/Linux and hence, when embedded in a PDF page, by
        pdf-presenter-console on GNU/Linux, as well as by Acrobat Reader DC on
        Windows...
        
        If anyone knows any better strategy, comments are welcome!

Unfortunately no you still need a GL (osmesa or EGL for headless).

File a feature request on the gitlab issue tracker if you want to attract
attention to that capability. It probably isn't that hard to do and it
would be a good use case.

Message-ID: <CAE=GJrZPsN4dVF83h8YD-Ev-cgMrHbSoW4riaDv2fV70g3F_TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Just finished downloading ParaView version 5.2 in Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Tried to run in parallel by doing:

cd *paraviewFolder/bin *
./mpiexec -n 2 ./pvserver


*No sucess. *

./mpiexec: error while loading shared libraries: libmpl.so.1: cannot open
> shared object file: No such file or directory


After doing some research I added the *paraview/lib* folder to my
LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/pv52/lib/paraview-5.2:/opt/pv52/lib/
cd *paraviewFolder/bin *
./mpiexec -n 2 ./pvserver


*No sucess.*

[mpiexec at leognome] HYDU_create_process (./utils/launch/launch.c:69): execvp
> error on file /home/leo/paraview/pv52/bin/./hydra_pmi_proxy (No such file

> [mpiexec at leognome] main (./ui/mpich/mpiexec.c:405): process manager error

Finally I entered the folder paraviewFolder/*lib/paraview-5.2  *to dig the
problem and found there are another set of
executables(paraview/pvserver/pvpython/etc) there.


cd *paraviewFolder/lib/paraview-5.2*
./mpiexec -n 2 ./pvserver

*Sucessful run.*


*##################################################################*
Then I went to ParaView download page and downloaded the latest version 5.5
In the 5.5 package I did:

cd *paraviewFolder/bin *
./mpiexec -n 2 ./pvserver


*Sucessful run.*

My question is, what happened? Was it supposed to happen? There was
structural directories changes?

Subject: [Paraview] How to 3d print a point representation
Message-ID: <20E70BA3-0A5F-427F-AE2D-E2DA5B602957@sandia.gov>

From a user:

There is an option in ParaView to have a "point" representation of the data as opposed to surface. This creates an interesting view which I typically use as a poor man's volume rendering.  With recent advances in 3D printing I think it would be VERY interesting to attempt to pass this point-like data to a 3D printer where I can then have the points printed into a clear substrate. Is there a way to export these points as geometry which I can then pass off to a 3D printer?

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Hi,

You either need a full color/clear printer or a 3D printing Service Provider.

I would use that technology: http://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/j735-j750

This printer is often used to 3dprint medical models from DICOM and other medical formats.

You could use the Point Volume Interpolator (Gaussian Kernel) to convert your points into voxel.

Hi Stefan,

Have been looking at this a little. Mostly for linux, where support is 
much less. Are you expecting to help with development?

I am still doing development on the plugin so there should be some updates
now and then. But the more the merrier :-) If you find fixes, improvements,
etc then let's get them merged in.

Thanks!

Leo,

With 5.2, use the mpiexec under the `lib/paraview-5.2` instead of the one
under `bin`.

Hi!

By doing that I can only use 2 processes. Using 3 or more my workstation
freezes trying to open the OpenGL contexts.

But I don't know if this happens only for me.

Subject: [Paraview] Error reading legacy VTK-file with Windows Version >5.2.x
Message-ID: <3aab3c55a1b446e2ad8020c567ddd5b7@thi.de>

Hi,

i have here a strange behaviour of the Windows Version of Paraview with Version above 5.2 reading a (legacy) VTK-ASCII file.

With Version 5.5.0 (and also 5.4) i get the following errors:
Generic Warning: In C:\bbd\7cc78367\build\superbuild\paraview\src\VTK\IO\Legacy\vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1436
Error reading ascii data. Possible mismatch of datasize with declaration.

ERROR: In C:\bbd\7cc78367\build\superbuild\paraview\src\VTK\IO\Legacy\vtkUnstructuredGridReader.cxx, line 348
vtkUnstructuredGridReader (0000025018454BA0): Unrecognized keyword: -3.7


Paraview then shows nothing.
Version 5.2.0 Windows works as expected (and maybe any older).

Paraview Version 5.4.0 Linux and macOS Versions 5.4.1 and 5.5.0 work, too.

The VTK-file is generated with OpenFOAM's foamToVTK.

Here are the first lines of an sample file (which creates the mentioned error message): 
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0

2.075 26 3 2.075 26 4 2.075 26 3 3.0375


If necessary i can provide a small full sample (with about 1MB of data).

I've googled around a bit and found only a few (and quite old) messages concerning this error (but I guess with a different background, regarding very small values - I can't see that this is the case here). One lead me to try to change all occurences of the dataType of the POINT type from float to double.
This works and the data can be visualized as expected with all Paraview versions on all platforms.

I just wonder about the different behaviour of the different versions of Paraview on Windows (5.2 vs. 5.4/5.5) and the difference between Paraview Windows and Linux/macOS?

Thanks in adavance.

Michael

Hmm, try passing the `--use-offscreen-rendering` to the pvserver (for 5.5
the option has changed).

It runs with more than 2 processes using --use-offscreen-rendering.

But by passing this argument I wont be using my GPU resources, right?

Subject: [Paraview] 2 different behaviours with using GridType="Collection"
Message-ID: <68f280fdd57344b258774f21d63e74ed@free.fr>

Hi
Dear All 

To build an assembly with its subparts, I use "Collection", but when the
file is imported into Paraview 5.5.0, I've met 2 behaviours:
- using the xmf reader, the hierachy can be seen on the lower left
corner
- whereas using the xmf3 one, nothing appears
(see the screenshots in attachment) 

Am I doing someting wrong in my code? 

Thanks for any suggestion

Subject: [Paraview] OSPRay textures and materials mapping
Message-ID: <DM5PR1501MB2023F01786A203AF6A309CB9FD900@DM5PR1501MB2023.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I tried rendering an .obj file running OSPRay that was exported from PCon Planner Version 7.7 Patch 1. The original file is a .dwg

I used the PathThracer mode. However, attached to the .obj there is an .mtl file containing 50+ materials and 50+ texture (.png) files.

I didn't find an automated way to map all polydata of the .obj with their respective material and texture file and rendering them using OSPRay.

It seems that I have to assign the material and texture to each polydata one-by-one.

Is there a feature that will automatically map the respective textures and materials ?

Here is the link to download the original .dwg file. https://www.easterngraphics.com/pcon/en/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sample_apartment.dwg
You will need to export it to .obj using PCon Planner Version 7.7 Patch 1 with the File/Export/Geometry menu.
I couldn't share the .obj  file since the size is 60mb+

Thank you

Hi,

I tried rendering an .obj file running OSPRay that was exported from PCon Planner Version 7.7 Patch 1. The original file is a .dwg

Hi Jonathan.

Yes you can do that.

1) File->Load OSPRay Materials, switch the file type from "OSPRay Material
Files (*.json)"  to "Wavefront Material FIles (*.mtl)". That will let you
load all of the materials and textures. They should all show up in the
Material list.

2) The OSPRay Material selection (on Display section of Properties Tab
advanced) will have all of the individual materials listed in it + a few
others including "Value Indexed" which is all the way at the bottom. Choose
that it means "use the categorical color lookup table to decide what
material to use for each block and or polygon"

3) Now change the scalar array to color by to "Material Id", a cell aligned
array which has the material index to use for each cell.

4) Make up a categorical lookup table.
   open spreadsheet view, switch to Field Data, look at the Material Names.
   open the color map editor for the "Material Id", click on Interpret
Values As Categories and the color will change from bluewhitered to
extremely YELLOW.
   add annotations, value 0 should be the name of the first entry in the
Material Names array.

Notes:
* I have the trivial script somewhere that I used for the SC17 demo that
makes up the lookup table for you. I'll try and dig that up.
* in general it isn't a 1:1 match between mtl and ospray, in particular
multitextures are not yet implemented
* along those lines, the mtl parser I whipped up
$PVSRC/VTK/Rendering/OSPRay/vtkMaterialLibrary::InternalParseMTL recognizes
a "type" extension outside of mtl that lets you bring in ospray's nice
materials instead of the default OBJMaterial. Glass and Metal are
particularly nice.

At some point I'll get around to making this all automatic. Patches are
welcome in the meantime.

good luck

Nope, you'll indeed be still using your GPU. It only won't see on-screen X

Subject: [Paraview] Unstructured rectilinear mesh vs legacy vtk format
Message-ID: <CABPML2K8fEhkTiJ6+W2mrdptt1wKYDhu_EzFwGjanc85R50Lgw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a cartesian grid on two different codes, one uses the legacy format
to write the data in vtk format where the co-ordinates of equidistant
points in x y and z directions are used and the associated velocity (or any
other state variable) values are written.

Whereas in the code which uses the unstructured dataset the each quadrant
extents are written and the associated cell data is written. Later the idea
is to have adaptive mesh refinement on this.

When I visualise both the files ( lets say for flow through a square duct,
pic attached ) I see a smooth representation that paraview automatically
calculates for the mesh in case of vtk whereas it appears like a
discontinuous data in case of vtu ( i assume vtu does lead to a
discontinuous field) . May I know if there is a smoothing filter which
allows me to interpolate the data onto an equidistant point cloud in all
directions so as to have smooth profile in my postprocessing.

Figure1. vtk flow through a square duct
Figure2 vtu flow through a square duct
Figure3 the velocity profile across the diagonal of the slice ( from vtk )
Figure4 the velocity profile across the diagonal of the slice ( from vtu)

Hi Aniruddha,

I think the reason why the data looks discontinuous is that it is
defined as cell data. So the easiest way is to use "Point Data to Cell
Data" filter to convert from cell data to point data, which is using a
very basic straight averaging.

Best Regards

Is this only a problem on my side, that I cannot step through the times of
a file series after a Catalyst live session has finished?
Looking forward to either positive or negative feedback

Many thanks,

correct.

Subject: [Paraview] questions about Catalyst using scenario
Message-ID: <CAH5ZWKoh1nSVJwLZrRXYRp52WfHQn8o797OOakx+dJ7uRkSNQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone:

I want to integrate Catalyst into my simulation-visualizaion code, but I
have a question about the using scenarios for Catalyst.

According to the instruction of the Catalyst, it could run synchronously
within simulation code, but my simulation is running by multi threads way
and each thread will generate data in specific domain. I hope visualization
program (picture drawing) could be triggered when every domain data is
generated. How could Catalyst know all the data is available in this case
in real time?

BTW, if I want to use batch script to draw the picture for every step, how
could I load the data from Catalyst? (I load data files from disk
previously)

Thanks a lot for your help!

Sincerely,
Zhe

Subject: [Paraview] Resample To Image with Catalyst
Message-ID: <QPP.33OCR.55Ndj08jV1o.1R0kt1@seznam.cz>

Hello,



the code which I am using is instrumented with Catalyst.

I am trying to process simulation data using ResampleToImage filter and then
to store the result on a disk.




In the Python pipeline I have something like:




adaptor_input = coprocessor.CreateProducer(datadescription, 'input')

resample = ResampleToImage(Input=adaptor_input)



resample.UseInputBounds = True


resample.SamplingDimensions = [256, 256, 256]


writer = servermanager.writers.XMLPImageDataWriter(Input=resample)

coprocessor.RegisterWriter(writer, filename='resample_%t.pvti', freq=10)





When I check the results in ParaView, the grid is correct but the data array
appended on it contains only zeros. When I skip the filter and dump directly
the adaptor_input, the data array contains correct values. Could you, 
please, help me to resolve this issue?




Thank you.




Kind regards,

Petr

Hello.
For planes, use the Slice filter. Check the "Crinkle slice" option if you
want to see exact mesh elements. For vector components, select vector and
desired component in top toolbar of ParaView window. Then set scale with
Rescale to custom data range (find this button in the same toolbar).
For isovolumes I use the Threshold filter (it's fast and the volume's
surface is what we need if we just want an isosurface). I recommend to make
the result transparent in some extent to represent the volume better. To
make vector components accessible with the Threshold filter, use Edit -
Settings - Auto Convert Properties (under Data Processing Options section).
As an alternative, you can create the component scalar with the Calculator
filter.

you cannot slice or isosurface a dataset made of poly-vertices, because there is no 3D cell.

your best bet would be to use the Point Interpolation filters (standard points , or SPH points). However, these filters require at least one scalar array attached to the points. Your data only contains a vector-valued array. If you decompose the vector into its 3 components, you would be able to use the Point Interpolators.

Hi David,

I was able to complete all the steps. As you probably know, the step four was tedious.

However I couldn?t get the result I wanted since I couldn?t assign the right textures to the right areas. Is there a mechanism to assign the texture just like we assign materials ?
I guess this is what you mean by ?multi-texture isn?t implemented yet?. I could probably extract all objects using a connectivity filter and then manually assign the textures, but again it is a tedious process for complex objects.

Is there a roadmap as to when the multi-texture could be implemented ? It would be great to have readers that can load texture/Geometry/Materials files such as .obj (.mtl and .png), .fbx and .dwg.

Best regards,

Jonathan Borduas

Hi Jonathan.

Yes you can do that.

1) File->Load OSPRay Materials, switch the file type from "OSPRay Material Files (*.json)"  to "Wavefront Material FIles (*.mtl)". That will let you load all of the materials and textures. They should all show up in the Material list.

2) The OSPRay Material selection (on Display section of Properties Tab advanced) will have all of the individual materials listed in it + a few others including "Value Indexed" which is all the way at the bottom. Choose that it means "use the categorical color lookup table to decide what material to use for each block and or polygon"

3) Now change the scalar array to color by to "Material Id", a cell aligned array which has the material index to use for each cell.

4) Make up a categorical lookup table.
   open spreadsheet view, switch to Field Data, look at the Material Names.
   open the color map editor for the "Material Id", click on Interpret Values As Categories and the color will change from bluewhitered to extremely YELLOW.
   add annotations, value 0 should be the name of the first entry in the Material Names array.

Notes:
* I have the trivial script somewhere that I used for the SC17 demo that makes up the lookup table for you. I'll try and dig that up.
* in general it isn't a 1:1 match between mtl and ospray, in particular multitextures are not yet implemented
* along those lines, the mtl parser I whipped up $PVSRC/VTK/Rendering/OSPRay/vtkMaterialLibrary::InternalParseMTL recognizes a "type" extension outside of mtl that lets you bring in ospray's nice materials instead of the default OBJMaterial. Glass and Metal are particularly nice.

At some point I'll get around to making this all automatic. Patches are welcome in the meantime.

good luck

Hi,

I tried rendering an .obj file running OSPRay that was exported from PCon Planner Version 7.7 Patch 1. The original file is a .dwg

I used the PathThracer mode. However, attached to the .obj there is an .mtl file containing 50+ materials and 50+ texture (.png) files.

I didn?t find an automated way to map all polydata of the .obj with their respective material and texture file and rendering them using OSPRay.

It seems that I have to assign the material and texture to each polydata one-by-one.

Is there a feature that will automatically map the respective textures and materials ?
Here is the link to download the original .dwg file. https://www.easterngraphics.com/pcon/en/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sample_apartment.dwg
You will need to export it to .obj using PCon Planner Version 7.7 Patch 1 with the File/Export/Geometry menu.
I couldn?t share the .obj  file since the size is 60mb+

Thank you

Jonathan Borduas

Better to do it in the code. We read in all of the texture coordinates when
we read the .obj and all of the texture files when we read the .mtl -> we
just aren't using the right set of texture coordinates in all cases yet.
That is most of what I mean by multitexture.

Is there a roadmap as to when the multi-texture could be implemented ?

I'm hoping for 5.6 in a couple of months time. Although this is important

In the meantime, this python programmable filter is a workaround.

And here is a python schell script to make step 4 (create the lookuptable)
automatic.

apartment = FindSource("sample_apartment.obj")

vtklevel = apartment.GetClientSideObject()

lut = GetColorTransferFunction('MaterialIds')

arr = vtklevel.GetOutput().GetFieldData().GetAbstractArray(0)

lut.InterpretValuesAsCategories = 1

ll = []

for x in range(0, arr.GetNumberOfTuples()):

ll.append(str(x))

ll.append(arr.GetValue(x))

Hi Petr,

Could you try adding in the following to your Python script after the
coprocessor.RegisterWriter() line:
writer.DataMode = 'Ascii'

Please let me know if that fixes the issue for you. This isn't the desired
fix but something to at least verify that I can reproduce your issue.

Thanks,
Andy

Dear Paraview users,

Based on the documentation, Delaunay3D will construct a 3D Delaunay 
triangulation from a list of input points if alpha=0. But I did an 
experiment that gave a different result. Here are the steps:
(1) Sources->Point source, and set Number of points to N (I experiment 
with different N=5 and N=20)
(2) Using sphere glyph to display these points
(3) Apply filter "Delaunay 3D" to the points with alpha=0 and display 
the resultant unstructured grid as wireframe.

When N=20, I can see some of the points are ignored in the process of 
Delauney triangulation.
When N=5, The resultant unstructured grid has 3 cells while I think it 
should have only 2 tetrahedra.

Can someone explain it? Thanks a lot.

Weiguang

Hi Will,

Thank you very much for your time. I've tried v5.5 and v5.2. This 
"issue" doesn't seem to have anything to do with the versions.

First of all, I would like to change my words for the N=5 case, where 
there might be 2, 3, or even 4 terahedra depending on the relative 
locations of the 5 points.

However, the question for the N=20 case is still pending one. You can 
see the dangling points if you change the representation from "surface" 
to "wireframe". I basically have similar result as yours. Because the 
point source generates point cloud with random positions of points, you 
will see different results each time you change the parameters of Point 
Source (either number of point or the radius).

Another question: is there another filter that constructs a grid from a 
set of points?

Weiguang,

I just want to clarify something quickly with your question. When you say ?some of the points are ignored in the process of Delauney triangulation? and ?dangling points,? do you mean that you can see some spheres that are inside the rest of the spheres?

I note in your description that you said you are looking at the wireframe of the Delaunay triangulation. The wireframe representation actually only shows the wireframe of the surface. You will not see the edges on the interior of the mesh, so any points that are on the interior will not look connected even if they are.

Instead of showing the wireframe, run the Extract Edges filter (which will show a wireframe of all edges). Does that connect the points like you expect?

Thanks for your reply. Your answer is clear. Now, another question....If i could make 3d cells would I can introduce vectors values in them? Because I  undestood that I could only set escalars.

How could I do the  colormap slices and iso surfaces in case I would have a a 3D cell?

Franco

you cannot slice or isosurface a dataset made of poly-vertices, because there is no 3D cell.

your best bet would be to use the Point Interpolation filters (standard points , or SPH points). However, these filters require at least one scalar array attached to the points. Your data only contains a vector-valued array. If you decompose the vector into its 3 components, you would be able to use the Point Interpolators.

You can probably generate a grid of cells using the Delaunay3D filter. (See another thread on the topic in the last 24 hours). You will get a grid of tetrahedra. Your field data (scalars or vectors) will remain attached to the vertices. You can use the 'Point Data to Cell Data' filter if you want to average data at the cells' centers.

once you have a 3D grid, you can slice and isosurface it and ParaView will give you the option to color the data using either the magnitude of your vector field (the default), or any of its independent component.

Hi Andy,

thank you for your reply. I don't know why, but it does work with setting 
DataMode='Ascii'.
It works also with DataMode='Binary', the only option which does not work 
seems to be now DataMode='Appended'.

Thanks and regards,

Hi Petr,


Could you try adding in the following to your Python script after the 
coprocessor.RegisterWriter() line:
writer.DataMode = 'Ascii'


Please let me know if that fixes the issue for you. This isn't the desired 
fix but something to at least verify that I can reproduce your issue.



Thanks,

Hello,

the code which I am using is instrumented with Catalyst.
I am trying to process simulation data using ResampleToImage filter and then
to store the result on a disk.


In the Python pipeline I have something like:


adaptor_input = coprocessor.CreateProducer(datadescription, 'input')
resample = ResampleToImage(Input=adaptor_input)

resample.UseInputBounds = True

resample.SamplingDimensions = [256, 256, 256]
writer = servermanager.writers.XMLPImageDataWriter(Input=resample)
coprocessor.RegisterWriter(writer, filename='resample_%t.pvti', freq=10)



When I check the results in ParaView, the grid is correct but the data array
appended on it contains only zeros. When I skip the filter and dump directly
the adaptor_input, the data array contains correct values. Could you, 
please, help me to resolve this issue?


Thank you.


Kind regards,

Hi Kenneth,

Sorry for my unclear description of the problem in previous emails. You 
actually explained what happened in the second paragraph of your email. 
Now I do "Extract Edges" and see all the edges. But yesterday I saw some 
internal points have no edges connecting to them (I referred them as 
dangling points) when displaying the Delaunay triangulation grid in 
wireframe, and didn't realize it shows only the wireframe of the 
surface. Thank you for pointing this out. It all makes sense now.

Best,
Weiguang

Venke,

You script to load the textures is indeed fine. The issue with with the
state loading implementation. There indeed is a bug where it doesn't handle
texture sources.

I've reported an issue here:

It seems that ParaView changes all paths in the state file to the specified
directory except for those of the images. Probably this has to do with the
way I import the images to the texture planes: to be able to keep the
texture images saved in a state file, I do the following:

> Maybe this is not the way to go anymore with PV 5.5? The "Search Files

anyone could tell me what I should do in order to have the texture images

Asunto: RE: Colormap cut planes and contour filter in an unstructured grid

Franco

You can probably generate a grid of cells using the Delaunay3D filter. (See another thread on the topic in the last 24 hours). You will get a grid of tetrahedra. Your field data (scalars or vectors) will remain attached to the vertices. You can use the 'Point Data to Cell Data' filter if you want to average data at the cells' centers.

once you have a 3D grid, you can slice and isosurface it and ParaView will give you the option to color the data using either the magnitude of your vector field (the default), or any of its independent component.

Hi,

I run Calculix *MODAL DYNAMIC calculation and obtain a FRD file I convert to VTK with the mmh_ccx2vtk utility.


When I load this VTK in Paraview I obtain a dataset with hundreds [###]-DISP fields, does exist a way to convert these fields in time steps ?

The Find Data filter (under the Edit menu) will do exactly this

suppose you have a dataset with two fields called "A" and "B"

Use Find Data
Create a Selection

Find Cells from "<name of your grid in the pipeline browser>"
Select   "A"    is >= x   # (replace "x" by the numeric value

click on "Run Selection Query"
click on Extract Selection and a new object is created in the pipeline.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you want to do this programmatically (using python), it is a far less obvious to figure out the right syntax, because the calls are not being traced. :-(

Here is the code I would use:

selection=SelectCells()
selection.QueryString="scalar2 >= x"  # (replace "x" by the numeric value
selection.FieldType = 'CELL'
selection.UpdatePipelineInformation()

# create a new 'Extract Selection'
# assuming your input object is called "grid"

mySelection = ExtractSelection(Input=grid, Selection=selection)
mySelection.UpdatePipeline()
Show(mySelection)

Hi,
I tried this. But the created object only contains the A data not the B data.
I have created the data set by "Group Datasets" since A and B come from different files.

Well..."Group Dataset" is another beast. In your original message you said the data was on the same mesh. It is not.

if you follow the ? under "Group Datasets" the Help menu will tell you "Groups multiple datasets to create a multiblock dataset"

So you do not have a single mesh, but you now have a multi-block made of two meshes.

What you want instead is 'Append Attributes'. Select both objects in your pipeline browsers, and append them. You will get a single dataset with the two scalars "A" and "B".


"The Append Attributes filter takes multiple input data sets with the same geometry and merges their point and cell attributes to produce a single output containing all the point and cell attributes of the inputs."


Repeat Selection as in the previous email.

Hi Jean,
Thank you that worked.
Please excuse the confusion, I am new to using paraview and not totally aware how data is managed.
Same mesh referred to the same mesh in the FEM software and therefore matching geometries.

Subject: [Paraview] paraviewweb multiple renderview problem
Message-ID: <CABrYh3omr=puJEG-yTp564M3vCR0BqX1SWr7vCmNdRrZ9vEgOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All:

For a ParaViewWeb application using pvpython as a server, I have two
vtkRenderer objects side-by-side. I have used setViewId() to set the view
IDs of those two objects to correspond to two different RenderView objects
over on the server, with viewIDs retrieved using the GetGlobalIDAsString()
method.

I expected to see the different render views in the two different
vtkRenderers, but unfortunately what I see is always the same visualization
in the two different windows, sometimes one RenderView, sometimes the other.

This is probably too vague a description to diagnose the problem (though
advice is certainly welcome) so I also have these specific questions:

 1. Is the concept of the "active" view of any use in this context, or will
that just get in the way? I've tried experimenting with making one or the
other render view active on the server and it clearly changes the behavior,
but I still wind up with the same view in both vtkRenderer objects.

 2. Are the view IDs supposed to be strings or integers on the client? The
divvy code seems to imply integers, but there is a "Failed to determine the
LookupTable being used." error on the server that seems to be associated
with my choosing to use integers on the client.

 3. How is the MouseHandler code supposed to relate to these two views? It
seems to matter which vtkRenderer window it's clicked in, but which one
moves doesn't seem related to the viewID of the window.

Thank you,

 -Tom

Dear experienced Paraview users,
I wonder how you decide which posts to answer and which to ignore.

My impression is that your decision doesn't depend whether questions are
well expained or whether you can help people a lot with minimal effort from
your side. Instead it seems like you look at the user's name, and if it
originates from a different culture, you tend to prefer other help requests.

Why else do you completely ignore questions for example from  ?? (Zhe),
from myself and a few others?

What can we do to get a little attention?

Many thanks,
Jussuf

Hi Jussuf

I would suggest reading this :
http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

To answer specifically your questions, this is a community managed mailing
list.
If nobody knows the answer for the questions you're asking, or if it takes
too long to investigate the issue, it is likely that nobody will answer.

You can also have professional support for ParaView at kitware.com

Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Dear Mathieu, dear list,
I meant to send another post to the list, asking what was wrong with this
post of mine:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2018-May/042654.html
Accidentally, I only sent it to Mathieu, and he replied that Kitware
doesn't have enough Catalyst experts. Well, one person familiar with
starting a Catalyst session would be enough to check whether this is a
serious bug or a problem on my side. It doesn't take an expert. I got the
impression that Kitware is actively promoting Catalyst as _the_ next big
thing. If such a bug cannot be dealt with by Kitware, I'll rather develop
my own Catalyst replacement than waiting for solutions.

At least, it explains another ignored Catalyst question by Zhe, if Kitware
cannot answer Catalyst related questions.

However, I can't stop wondering whether it's really the content or how well
posed a question is and not the names of the users that ask, which decides
whether they receive an answer or not. I may return to this thread later
with more examples.

Many thanks,
Jussuf

The short answer is no. There is no organized effort to ignore certain
users or respond to only certain questions.

As Mathieu said, this is a community service. Responders are not merely
Kitware employees but also members of the larger ParaView community.
Despite everyone's best efforts, we cannot respond to all queries due to
lack of time. As a result, emails that are a little complex to read, not
clear what the issue could be etc. tend to go unreplied. Sometimes, it's
just timing. For example, if emails show up on holidays, then by the time
people get back to work a new slew of emails take up the inbox and older
emails may get missed.

Also, good way to get members to go the extra mile to help with your
questions is participating in the mailing list yourself. Try responding to
other users' questions, for example.

Despite all this, I am sure emails will still sometimes go unanswered. We
are all human with limited abilities and somethings will slip despite our
best efforts.

Subject: [Paraview] catalyst with parallel rendering
Message-ID: <8da72913-7da8-7cc1-0d61-1d41fd158177@esi-group.com>

For the mailing list, since this must probably be a FAQ (even if I seem 
to find the answer in the usual places).

I would like to have paraview rendering in parallel for a simulation 
with catalyst. For simplicity, I'm fiddling about on a local 
workstation, but would like to generalize later. it should work without 
live visualization enabled, or requiring a GUI to connect.

I'd presume using something like the following

mpirun -np 12 pvserver --server-port=123456 --force-offscreen-rendering

would be setup a parallel rendering session as usual. However, after 
scouring docs there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to connect this 
within catalyst (without a GUI).

The only access point that I seem to find is to define an MPI 
communicator for initializing catalyst after some how (some hand-waving 
here) querying a pvserver connection for its host topology and defining 
an appropriate communicator.

Cheers,

/mark

Dear Utkash,
thanks a lot for filing an issue for my problem with disabled VCR controls.
I have another open question since February:
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2018-February/042028.html I'd
be absolutely happy if you could give a similarly quick reply as you did
for the Catalyst problem. I asked the same question on the developers list,
because I thought it's rather development oriented than a user problem, but
there I am told to be patient since 4 months.

I always simplify my questions to short, minimal examples, that can be
verified or rejected within seconds or minutes. I would be really happy to
contribute to other people's questions on this list. I don't know if you
understand how frustrating it can be, if my only two questions to this list
remain unanswered for weeks and months. It takes days or weeks to find
workarounds for all those ParaView bugs. I would have the time to answer
many, many questions (somewhere below my level of experience, of course) on
this list, if I could expect SOME answer within a week or so like "We are
not interested in this problem" or "Won't fix" or "Yes, this is a bug,
solution may be available in 6 months". But receiving no answer at all
costs all my available time to program some workaraound, although Kitware
might fix the same problem in parallel.

Many thanks,
Jussuf

Hi Tom,

There might be a bug (sometime it happen ;-). If you can provide a tiny
example app with a cone and cube in two views, I might be able to quickly
look at it and even fix the source of the issue.

1) The active view won't help you in your current setup as it is a
convenient way to ignore the view id. But since you need a clear
distinction, you will have to stick to a given view id to prevent mixup.

2) They are supposed to be unique and we know by nature they are a counter
and -1 represent the "active" one. Normally the type should not matter. But
the server usually send it as a string.

3) Normally the mouse handler hold that viewId as well. But if not provided
(-1), it will affect the active view.

HTH,

Seb

Christoph,

While I didn't encounter the lzma link issue myself, since you're using
system zlib etc., shouldn't the LZMA also be set to use system? Try setting
`-DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_LZMA:BOOL=ON`. Maybe same should be done for
`VTK_USE_SYSTEM_LZ4`.

Message-ID: <2B61FBB88A39B549BA8029E6EDC5B4A1249491@MTLWAEXCH005.ca.aero.bombardier.net>

Hi All,

I'm looking into doing some on-line post-processing of simulation data, but I'm having trouble getting Catalyst setup on our system.

Following the instructions here<https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2016-August/037674.html> I downloaded the Paraview source and ran ccmake with BUILD_CATALYST_ADAPTERS set to "on".  It compiles, but returns a message that it did not use BUILD_CATALYST_ADAPTERS, which suggests it's not actually including them in the make file.  I then downloaded a Catalyst source edition that has the functionality we're looking for and attempted ccmake, but this reports the errors

"CMake Error: file [path]/package.json.in does not exist"

And

"No such module "vtkChartsCore" needed by "vtkPVServerManagerApplication".

Particularly the first error has me flummoxed, and I was wondering if anybody with more success could point me in the right direction towards resolving it.

Thanks,
Gregg

If you just wish to get going quickly, you can simply compile and 
install a regular ParaView with PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON 
and use these libraries/headers for your Catalyst-enabled simulation.

Subject: [Paraview] seeking pvpython debugging hints
Message-ID: <CABrYh3oeQ5jcjU_fL3wi0cU8vNSG-FDYcHbaQYah=0ziy8S0MQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:

Does anyone have helpful hints to offer about how to debug errors like
these? Some array of mine is out of range, but I don't know what array it's
talking about, and don't really see how to find out. To my knowledge the
change in my code that triggered this has nothing to do with any array.

My guess is the "Failed to determine the LookupTable" is the result of the
error after it, since it is sort of a common denominator among errors I
see. Does that sound right?

Is there a way to enable more debug information or more verbose error
messages?

Thank you,

 -Tom

Tom,

This generally means that the array you've chosen to color with in the
script is not available in the dataset and hence its failing to determine
the array range.

Hope that helps narrow down the issue.

Hi Utkarsh:

It did help, though I wonder why it couldn't tell me what array was the
problem. The error messages from deep in the bowels of pvpython are pretty
mysterious.

But enough carping -- thank you!

That, I think, should be an easy fix. Please free free to report a quick
issue on the issue tracker. Such things are easier to fix when there are
issues listed as otherwise it's easy to forget.

Dear Mathieu,
I have to use this programmable filter also with Poly Mesh; unfortunately it doesn?t work with this kind of mesh.
Usually, when I clip Poly mesh, it works fine the ?Crinkle clip?.
How I should modify the programmable filter in order to use this for the Poly mesh?

Andrea

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Clip a domain using a close surface

Hi Andrea,
Here is an updated script to clip instead of cutting.
You will recover the volume of your main dataset which is inside the provided surface.
(if your are interested by what is outside, just change the InsideOut value)

import vtk.vtkPVVTKExtensionsDefault as ext



inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )

inpClip = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )

out = self.GetOutput()



clipper = ext.vtkPVMetaClipDataSet()

clipper.SetInputDataObject(inpMain)

clipper.SetInsideOut(True)

clipFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()

clipFunction.SetInput(inpClip)

clipper.SetClipFunction(clipFunction)

clipper.Update()



outData = clipper.GetOutputDataObject(0)

out.DeepCopy(outData)

I've included the state file and a dataset to test with. make sure to set the path to the dataset when loading the state file.
You may also want to take a look into the resample with dataset solution.
Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Thank you Mathieu for your answer,
When I tries your filter I obtain ?an intersection? between the sphere and my domain.
While the result that I would get is a clipped domain, I have included a Statefile for demonstration on what I would get.
Maybe I'm using your filter in a wrong way?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Clip a domain using a close surface

Hi Andrea,
This is achievable using a Programmable Filter, with the following script :

inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )

inpCut = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )

out = self.GetOutput()



cutter = vtk.vtkCutter()

cutter.SetInputDataObject( inpMain )

cutFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()

cutFunction.SetInput( inpCut )

cutter.SetCutFunction( cutFunction )

cutter.Update()



outData = cutter.GetOutputDataObject( 0 )

out.DeepCopy(outData)

(thanks @Yves Roger for providing it here :  https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-April/033903.html)

In case you do not know how to use the programmable filter in this case, I have included a StateFile that demonstrate it.
Notice that we are using an "output data type : vtkPolyData".

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Clip a domain using a close surface

Dear users,
I need to clip a domain with a close surface.
More in details I have a cfd domain with pressure and velocity field, I import a table of point and I create a closed surface using delunay3d filters.
At this stage, I would clip the computational domain using the close surface dividing the cfd domain or in the internal part of the close surface or in the external part.

I have tried using clip with scalars, but I am not able to understand how use it properly.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Andrea

Hello ParaView community,

Following up on our previous discussion about transitioning the ParaView
mailing lists to Discourse, we now have a Discourse instance ready to use
to discuss all things ParaView. You can find it at

https://discourse.paraview.org/

You can sign up for the web site using your Google or GitHub accounts if
you prefer, otherwise you can register with a user name and password.

Please try it out and leave any feedback you might have under the "Site
Feedback" category (https://discourse.paraview.org/c/site-feedback) on the
site.

While we expect the bulk of ParaView-related discussion to transition to
Discourse fairly rapidly in the near term, the current paraview at paraview.org
and paraview-developers at paraview.org mailing lists will remain active until
at least the end of 2018.

See you on discourse.paraview.org!

Dear Utkarsh,
thanks for the hint, adding `-DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_LZMA:BOOL=ON`, it helped.

Now I get another linker error:

[  259s]
/home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/ParaView-v5.5.0/VTK/ThirdParty/libharu/vtklibharu/src/hpdf_page_operator.c:2280:
undefined reference to `sincos'

I found some hints that ParaViews provides a patched version of hpdf,
but I could get it compiled. Any idea?

Thanks a lot!
Christoph

Unfortunately, plots are notoriously hard to get right. Partly, the

And here is a python schell script to make step 4 (create the lookuptable) automatic.

Hi David,

I was able to complete all the steps. As you probably know, the step four was tedious.

However I couldn?t get the result I wanted since I couldn?t assign the right textures to the right areas. Is there a mechanism to assign the texture just like we assign materials ?
I guess this is what you mean by ?multi-texture isn?t implemented yet?. I could probably extract all objects using a connectivity filter and then manually assign the textures, but again it is a tedious process for complex objects.

Better to do it in the code. We read in all of the texture coordinates when we read the .obj and all of the texture files when we read the .mtl -> we just aren't using the right set of texture coordinates in all cases yet. That is most of what I mean by multitexture.

Is there a roadmap as to when the multi-texture could be implemented ?

I'm hoping for 5.6 in a couple of months time. Although this is important it may very well slip because of other priorities.



In the meantime, this python programmable filter is a workaround.


pdi = self.GetInput()

pdo = self.GetOutput()

pdo.ShallowCopy(pdi)



arraynames = []

arrays = {}

for a in range(0,pdi.GetPointData().GetNumberOfArrays()):

  array = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray(a)

  if array.GetNumberOfComponents() != 2:

    continue

  arrname = array.GetName()

  pdo.GetPointData().RemoveArray(arrname)

  arraynames.append(arrname)

  arrays[arrname] = array



tcoords = vtk.vtkFloatArray()

tcoords.SetName("TCoords")

tcoords.SetNumberOfComponents(2)

pdo.GetPointData().SetTCoords(tcoords)

# todo numpy this to make it 100x faster

for p in range(0, pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()):

  tcoord = [0,0]

  for arrname in arrays:

    candidate = arrays[arrname].GetTuple2(p)

    if candidate[0] == -1 and candidate[1] == -1:

      continue

    tcoord = candidate

  tcoords.InsertNextTuple2(tcoord[0],tcoord[1])



It would be great to have readers that can load texture/Geometry/Materials files such as .obj (.mtl and .png), .fbx and .dwg.

Agreed.

Jonathan Borduas

Subject: Re: [Paraview] OSPRay textures and materials mapping

Hi Jonathan.

Yes you can do that.

1) File->Load OSPRay Materials, switch the file type from "OSPRay Material Files (*.json)"  to "Wavefront Material FIles (*.mtl)". That will let you load all of the materials and textures. They should all show up in the Material list.

2) The OSPRay Material selection (on Display section of Properties Tab advanced) will have all of the individual materials listed in it + a few others including "Value Indexed" which is all the way at the bottom. Choose that it means "use the categorical color lookup table to decide what material to use for each block and or polygon"

3) Now change the scalar array to color by to "Material Id", a cell aligned array which has the material index to use for each cell.

4) Make up a categorical lookup table.
   open spreadsheet view, switch to Field Data, look at the Material Names.
   open the color map editor for the "Material Id", click on Interpret Values As Categories and the color will change from bluewhitered to extremely YELLOW.
   add annotations, value 0 should be the name of the first entry in the Material Names array.

Notes:
* I have the trivial script somewhere that I used for the SC17 demo that makes up the lookup table for you. I'll try and dig that up.
* in general it isn't a 1:1 match between mtl and ospray, in particular multitextures are not yet implemented
* along those lines, the mtl parser I whipped up $PVSRC/VTK/Rendering/OSPRay/vtkMaterialLibrary::InternalParseMTL recognizes a "type" extension outside of mtl that lets you bring in ospray's nice materials instead of the default OBJMaterial. Glass and Metal are particularly nice.

At some point I'll get around to making this all automatic. Patches are welcome in the meantime.

good luck

Hi,

I tried rendering an .obj file running OSPRay that was exported from PCon Planner Version 7.7 Patch 1. The original file is a .dwg

I used the PathThracer mode. However, attached to the .obj there is an .mtl file containing 50+ materials and 50+ texture (.png) files.

I didn?t find an automated way to map all polydata of the .obj with their respective material and texture file and rendering them using OSPRay.

It seems that I have to assign the material and texture to each polydata one-by-one.

Is there a feature that will automatically map the respective textures and materials ?
Here is the link to download the original .dwg file. https://www.easterngraphics.com/pcon/en/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sample_apartment.dwg
You will need to export it to .obj using PCon Planner Version 7.7 Patch 1 with the File/Export/Geometry menu.
I couldn?t share the .obj  file since the size is 60mb+

Thank you

Jonathan Borduas

Dear All 

I'm trying to implement "BaseOffset" in my models in order to strat
numbering from 1 rather than 0, but Paraview crashes whatever is the
reader I use (xmf or xmf3): Am I doing something wrong? 

Thanks 

Paul

I'll remove the need for them at some point, but for 5.5 they are helpful.
So yes discourse is a good place for safe keeping.

Message-ID: <17954FF4A6EDC447B60CEFADD6DCAE9302787546@GSVCLU05.ges.ferlan.it>

Dear Users,
I need to find the intersection point between a connectivity surface (portion of a slice) and a stream tracer that runs through this.
I have tried the IntersectFragments it doesn?t work with stream tracer.
Someone of you have some suggestions?
Best regards,
Andrea

Subject: [Paraview] PythonProgrammableFilters Multiple Input Ports
Message-ID: <CAD=kO4tV5LSRpB5KDWAH9V7aon+PY=3G5r3YPC_zzoPTCgvfEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I see an old thread here:
https://paraview.markmail.org/thread/z7cy73444s7fjadk about setting
multiple input ports for python programmable filters but I cannot get this
to work.

I want to declare multiple input ports in a ServerManagerConfiguration XML
plugin but I have been unable to successfully add more than one input port
to the vtkPythonProgrammableFilter.

I see that in
`paraview/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Core/vtkPythonProgrammableFilter.h`
the following is declared:

  /**
   * Set the number of input ports
   * This function is explicitly exposed to enable a
vtkClientServerInterpreter to call it
   */
  void SetNumberOfInputPorts(int numberOfInputPorts) VTK_OVERRIDE
  {
    this->Superclass::SetNumberOfInputPorts(numberOfInputPorts);
  }


This leads me to believe that the functionality is there, but how exactly
would I set the number of input ports from an XML plugin for a Programmable
Filter? I have tried the following with no luck:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
 <ProxyGroup name="filters">
   <SourceProxy
name="TestMuliPort?
class="vtkPythonProgrammableFilter?
label=?TestMuliPort?
post_creation=?SetNumberOfInputPorts"
arguments="2?>
??..


I get the following ERROR:

ERROR: In
/Users/kitware/dashboards/buildbot-slave/8275bd07/build/superbuild/paraview/src/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkPVSessionCore.cxx,
line 371
vtkPVSessionCore (0x60c0000d4510): Object type:
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, could not find requested method:
"SetNumberOfInputPorts"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = vtk_object_pointer {vtkPythonProgrammableFilter
(0x60c0003abde0)}
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetNumberOfInputPorts}



Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Bane
