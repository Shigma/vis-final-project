So if I want to run paraview with MPI, and have a performance increase, 
do I have to have parallel files, or is paraview smart enough to break 
my serial file up and separate over processors?

Message-ID: <40E41782.1070403@nabla.co.uk>

Hello

I am trying to write a reader for my data files. The problem is that my 
data comes from multiple files so I cannot use the existing file readers 
as example. Instead I am using a vtkdataSetSource. It all is starting to 
hang together but I have one problem:

I need to define a time step selector so

In my PVFoamReader.xml I have:

         <Scale variable="TimeStep"
             trace_name="TimeStep"
             type="int"
             label="Time step"
             range="0 1"
             default_value="0"
             display_entry="1"
             display_value="1"
             entry_and_label_on_top="0"
             help="Set the current time step."
             range_source="TimeStepRange" />

which will setup a call to GetTimeStepRange to get the max and min for the
slider.   This required the reader module to have a function of the form

     float GetTimeValueRange();

which is only allowed to return a single float.  How do I set the max 
and min
for the Scale widget using this function?

Regards,

Mattijs

p.s. is there some more documentation on writing reader modules?

you are close to the solution.

Your XML looks good.

your reader should include:

class VTK_IO_EXPORT vtkfoo : public vtk???
{
public:
   vtkSetVector2Macro(TimeStepRange,int);
   vtkGetVector2Macro(TimeStepRange,int);
protected:
   int TimeStepRange[2];
};

and your *.cxx reader source code can do the following during the 
ExecuteInformation phase:

this->SetTimeStepRange(0, this->NbTimeSteps-1);


It works for me. I use PV1.5 nightly.

Cheers

Hello,
     I am interested writing a render module for paraview 1.4. Is there any
documentation on the interface required for this module? I have read various
portions of the user's manual but can't seem to find what I am looking for.
Also, is there a doxygen site for all the paraview source similiar to vtk?
One last question, on the features page it mentions being able to describe
new filters in an XML format and the ability to write added functions for
the paraview interface, is there documentation somewhere for this
functionality? Thanks for the help.

Doug,

I am right in the middle of writing documentation for ParaView render 
modules.  For the moment, the best advice I can give you is to look at the 
"Cave" render module.  It is relatively straight forward 
implementation.  Also,  the top level VTKRenderModule class implements a 
very simple (single process) module that has no levels of details.

The basic objects are:
vtkCaveRenderManager:  This is a VTK class that synchronizes the lights, 
and cameras in all of the processes.  This class also handles compositing 
(but compositing is not needed for the cave module).

vtkPVCaveRenderModule:  This object has methods for creating the render 
windows, renders and managers on all appropriate processes.  It also has 
the main render method and makes global LOD decisions.

vtkPVCaveRenderModuleUI:  This object creates any special user interface 
for controlling parameters for the specific render module.  As currently 
implemented, this class must exist, even if it implements nothing.  The 
name pattern much match the render module object.

vtkPVPartDisplay:  This object handles creating all of the VTK objects that 
are necessary for rendering a VTK data object.  This includes decimation 
filters for creating LODs, geometry filters for creating a polydata 
representation, and re partitioning filters for moving rendering geometry 
around to different processes (used when switching between compositing and 
local rendering on the client).  The render module acts like an object 
factory and creates subclasses of this object as necessary.


What exactly are you going implement in your new module?

Charles.

Could someone please direct me toward where examples of animation

with the other vtk wrappers.  I don't see much email on this in the

Charles,
     Thanks for your detailed response.  I look forward to your more formal
documentation. I would like to explore writing a plugin that would allow
rendering with Performer by using the vtkActorToPF library out of UIUC. I
would like to be able to take advantage of a scene graph and the
functionality of paraview. Do you think this is feasible? Also, are there
doxygen pages created for the vtk classes you mentioned?

I need to open a Wrl file and perform an Elevation coloring from DOS commandLine.

And I need to remain in ParaView viewing.

I tried to use the  "-b" parameter, saving, before a batch script from Paraview.

But, my batch saves a jpg file, and then closes ParaView.

What is the settings to leave the program open ?

Doug,

I believe the cave render module classes I referenced were added after 
1.4.  I just looked at the vtkActorToPF web pages at UIUC.  It would be 
easy enough to create the actor to PF translator object in a subclass of 
vtkPVPartDisplay.  I assume that ParaView would keep its vtkRenderWindow 
for the GUI, and Performer would manage its own rendering and cameras.  I 
do not know enough about Performer to say any more.

Charles.

Charles,
     That is exactly the info I was looking for. I greatly appreciate your
help. I will keep you updated on the progress of the module as I am
working on it. You are correct, I was planning on keeping the gui
render window active. Thanks again for the info.

You don't want to use batch scripts; they are intended for
non-interactive runs. Instead, use the "File->Save Session State" to
save a ParaView script. Then, when you restart ParaView just give the
name of the script you saved on the command line.

OK.   Now I can run ParaView from CommandLine, using pvs file.

What I need to do:

1) Load a WRL file (I create a new Wrl file from my application, with the same name,
but different PointSet geometry inside).

2) Perform automatically an Elevation coloring  (but I need a grey scale only !)

3) Remain in ParaView


I have problems with Elevation filtering, now.  In fact, the "Save Session State"
produces a PVS status specific for  one Wrl file.  Changing the geometry, the
parameters are not correct, and I can have wrong coloring (i.e. only red)  or
wrong centering.
There is a way to do a PVS file generic ?


And, how can I have only grey scale elevation coloring ?

Hi,

I would like to note that for those who want to run ParaView in Caves, but
don't want to use
performer - I've made a similar translator osgVTK for translation to
OpenSceneGraph.

Currently I am implementing a renderer based on this into Paraview - Till
now I've just made
it a Module filter, but this info could become handy ;-)

Cheers,

Michael

Michael,
    After I did the performer one I was going to do the same thing for OSG.
I would be very interested in seeing how your module works. Is it possible I
could get a copy of your source? I would also be interested in your strategy
for implementing the osgVTK into a paraview renderer.

Subject: [Paraview] Animating camera angle
Message-ID: <1089307289.2441.8.camel@orion3>

Hello,

I would really appreciate some assistance with getting some camera
animation scripts written.  Does anyone have some example scripts that
can be shared?  An example would be very helpful at this point.  I'm
still a little confused over what the scripting language actually is and
how it fits into the Paraview/vtk system.  Since tcl/tk is not a
language I'm particularly familiar with I may be asking about something
that is obvious to others - but I haven't been able to track down
examples or details in the FAQ or list archive.

Regards,

John Harrop

Doug,

Attached please find the source for the plugin...

For now it only supports conversion from vtk format to osg and viewing in
Producer.
However, I'm implementing osgVR a  library for doing clustering with OSG and
this will open
up for full clustering support.

My plan is first to finish the clustering (some time during august, as I go
on vacation next week :-)
then changing osgPV use osgVR will just be changing a few lines...

As far as implementing it as a renderer in Paraview I was hoping to find an
example of someone else doing exactly this...
But a module is also kind of OK as a start.

Another issue is of course  interaction with PV from VR, which I haven't
solved either.

How finished is you Performer link ? And on what platforms does it run ?
(mine should work on all from windows to Unix and mac).

Finally a note on osgPV: You need a to download (/CVS) openscenegraph,
openproducer, openthreads and compile to make things compile and run.

Have fun!

Cheers,

Michael

Michael,
	Thanks for all the info. I have just started the performer project
so I have nothing to share yet. I would be glad to share my code as it
progresses as I am interested in the osg paraview stuff. I plan to have the
source for the performer project under lgpl or see if the paraview guys are
interested at all with it. I am going on vacation this week so after that I
will dig into your example. Thanks for all the info and code.

 I should specify not VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA  but VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA .
 I could make with this flag on Linux environment.

 But on Solaris, the following error occurs.

Subject: [Paraview] Pause in batch script
Message-ID: <OF2F956C83.96F9EC69-ONC1256ED1.0044351B@grundfos.com>





Hi,

I would like ParaView to act as visualizer for a transient CFD simulation
'on-the-run', that is ParaView should load results files in Ensgiht format
as soon as they appear in a specified data directory.

For this means I could follow at least two different approaches:
a) write a batch script that calls Paraview once but includes a 'pause'
function waiting for new files to appear before proceeding. How do I
accomplish this file testing _inside_ a *.pvs script?

b) make the file testing outside paraview and then launch a *.pvs script
telling Paraview to update the plot. How do l invoke a *.pvs script on an
_existing_ Paraview session?

Regards,

Nicholas

Message-ID: <20040714190759.A162C21C44@elrond.cab.bau.tu-bs.de>

Hi all,

we are trying to visualize huge binary datafiles with ParaView. Each one
contains just single float values and has at least a size of 2 Gbyte (raw
binary or hdf5). However, a splitting of these files is costly and not very
usefull. Our hardware is theoretically capable of managing these amounts of
data (an Opteron Cluster with 160Gbyte RAM and 96 Processors under SuSE
64Bit and a VR-PC with Windows XP AMD64-Edition and 8Gbyte RAM. Our lack is
a compiler which can build either binaries for Windows64 or SuSE-Linux. On
Linux we already tried: PGI, gcc and Intel compilers - and failed :/
On Windows we are waiting for VS.NET 2005 which should be capable of
building optimized AMD64 code (the install of the May Preview did
unfortunatly fail). My question now: Does anybody has experience with
building binaries on 64Bit platforms? Or, can somebody provide binaries?
Preferably for Windows, but SuSE Linux would help a lot, too. Any help is
greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

kind regards,

Benjamin Ahrenholz

Hi,
I've compiled ParaView on a dual opteron, running SuSE Linux 9.1 x86_64. I can 
send you a compressed tar of the compiled directory, or help you on building 
it. That file tar.bz2 is about 30MB so, if you give me a place I can upload 
it.
Regards,
Ezequiel

P.S. What I have is CVS version of ParaView (08/07/2004) and SuSE 9.1 obtained 
from FTP.

We compiled Paraview on a dual opteron on a SuSE Linux 9.1 x86_64 as 
well. It compiles and runs fine when compiled in 32 bit mode (-m32) but 
we had to dig around in the makefiles to compile/link 64 bit (-m64) and 
then it coredumps somewhere in tcl. So did you manage to make it run in 
64 bit mode?

Regards,

Mattijs

Hi.

The most important thing you need to know is that all ParaView scripts
are Tcl scripts (and support Tk). You can do anything you can do in Tcl
in them. Here is an example .pvs script:

set shouldCont 1
while {1} {
    if { $shouldCont } {
# do something here
        update
    } else {
        break
    }
}

As you can see, this script continuously update the GUI (the update Tk
call) if shouldCont is set to false. This means that while this script
is running, the user will be able to interact with ParaView. To exit
the script, the user has to set shouldCont to 0 in the command prompt.
The simpler thing to do would be to create a pop-up window that has
an exit button. 
Inside the while loop, you can do whatever Tcl allows you to do. You can
check if a file has been modified and update ParaView accordingly, you
can even create a socket connection to some server to communicate. One
word of caution: changing ParaView state while the user is interacting
may lead to instability. For example, modifying a source while the
user is changing parameters might have unexpected side effects.

Hi,

Thanks for your replies. We continue trying to compile with gcc34 (I guess
it was gcc32 we've used, which produced an error of a strange kind) as we
will try the binaries Ezequiel too. Somebody had any success on a windows64
platform?

Hi,
I had some problems with tcl also but I installed also tcl 8.3, and everything 
went fine. The program runs well with my input files (h5 and pdb).
I'm sending attached a file showing the output for 'file *' in the 
paraview/bin directory.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview render servers and X
Message-ID: <200407200104.i6K14Pd5019509@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hi folks;
  I'm trying to set up a strange Paraview client-server configuration in which 
render servers running under MPI use Chromium to draw to the displays of 
separate rendering service machines.  (Yes, I know; I can use mesa to do the 
rendering off-screen on the render server hosts.  Just humor me for a minute). 
 The Paraview render servers all need an X connection to their respective 
rendering service machines, even though they don't run X widgets.  As far as I 
can tell, the X DISPLAY environment variable is only used in 
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow, where it sets up certain window connection bits that 
are then used with glX calls to set up the actual GL rendering context.
  Does a Paraview render server do anything with X other than set up the GL 
context using glX calls?  If not, I can modify vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow to use 
the corresponding Chromium calls to set up the glX context and avoid touching 
the X display per se.  If X is used for something else, like reading back from 
the window or communicating redraw events to the render servers, that approach 
is pretty hopeless and I'll have to figure out some other solution.  Has 
anyone already created a vtkCrOpenGLRenderWindow class which will do this job?
  Sorry to ask such an open-ended question.  Chromium I can handle, but I'm 
very naive about vtk internals.

Thanks,
-Joel

Hello, all

 I ran paraview1.4.3 by mpirun , but following error occured.

----------------------------------------------------------
% mpirun -np 2 /home/suz/paraview143/bin/paraview --server
Waiting for client...
MPI_Recv: invalid tag argument (rank 1, comm 2)
Rank (1, MPI_COMM_WORLD): Call stack within LAM:
Rank (1, MPI_COMM_WORLD):  - MPI_Recv()
Rank (1, MPI_COMM_WORLD):  - main()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the processes started by mpirun has exited with a nonzero exit
code.  This typically indicates that the process finished in error.
If your process did not finish in error, be sure to include a "return
0" or "exit(0)" in your C code before exiting the application.

PID 19998 failed on node n0 with exit status 1.
----------------------------------------------------------

 
 Please tell me how do I run Paraview by MPI?

 I made paraview with the following ccmake flags.

 MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY                /usr/lib/liblam.a
 MPI_INCLUDE_PATH                 /usr/include

 VTK_MPI_NUMPROC_FLAG             -np
 VTK_USE_MPI                      ON


 OS is RedHat 8.0.

 When I made with LAM/MPI, this error occurs.
 But I made with MPI-CH, I can run paraview right.
 I don't know the reason...

 Ccmake's flags are following in the case of MPI-CH.

 MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY                MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
 MPI_INCLUDE_PATH                 /home/suz/local/include

Which version of LAM are you using? LAM in general has better
error reporting than mpich so something that runs fine on mpich
might produce an error on LAM. I will look into this.

Subject: [Paraview] Off screen rendering and software rendering
Message-ID: <040723212719.M1921260@cinq.mito.ssd.ssg.fujitsu.com>

Hello all,

 I've just stuck on some points about "off screen rendering" and
"software rendering" of ParaView.
 Could you tell me?

1. How does the process behave with/without "--use-offscreen-rendering" ?
   Regardless of the option "--use-offscreen-rendering", the server process
   does not have a window. Does "Off Screen Rendering" mean "no windows" ?
   Without "--use-offscreen-rendering", is the rendering processed on a client
  after objects are transfered to client ?

2. What's the difference between 
   ("--use-software-rendering" or "--use-satellite-software")  and
   "--use-offscreen-rendering" options?

 Best Regards.

 I used LAM 6.5.6, because RedHat 8.0 includes it.

 Today, I installed LAM 7.0.6 and made ParaView with this new LAM.
 Then ParaView worked well in parallel.

 Thank you, Berk.

Message-ID: <200407272302.i6RN2DBA000321@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hey folks;
  We've been working through a series of problems building ParaView 1.4.3 on 
our Compaq AlphaServer under OSF1 (aka Tru64 Unix).  The current issue is that 
ProcessXML appears to be quitting about half way through the production of 
Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMGeneratedModules.h .  The last few lines of the 
generated file are:

// Get single string
char* vtkSMDefaultModulesfiltersGetInterfaces()
{
  int len = ( 0
    + strlen(vtkSMDefaultModulesfilters0)
    + strlen(vtkSMDefaultModulesfilters1)
    + strlen(vtkSMDefaultModulesfilters2)

(at which point the file ends without a terminating newline).  
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml is at least superficially 
well-formed.  Is there any known problem with this?  Are there any hidden 
debugging options on ProcessXML?

Thanks,
-Joel

Guys,
	I think I've asked about this *way* back when, but is ParaView GLP? 
If not, what license does it fall under?  The reason I ask is that one 
of our QA guys here at work is asking quite a few questions about it. 
  We're almost to the point of either not using it, or re-submitting a 
lot of paperwork on the validity of the application.

Look at:

http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Copyright.html

It is a BSD type license, which is a lot less restrictive
than GPL.

ParaView's license is less strict than the GPL. See this link off the
main ParaView web page for the exact conditions:

Hi.

I just installed paraview oon my linux PC (RedHat 9) and I am getting the 
following error message -

What does it mean?
What do I have to do to make it work?
Thanks

I think it means that your X-server (Xfree or Xorg I assume) does not 
know the GLX (OpenGL over X?) protocol.

In Xfree you can load the module to implement the glx functionality. In 
my /etc/X11/XF86Config file in the 'Module' section I have

Section "Module"
   Load         "dbe"
   Load         "type1"
   Load         "speedo"
   Load         "freetype"
   Load         "extmod"
   Load         "glx"
   Load         "v4l"
#  Load         "dri"
EndSection

and I assume the glx module implements the GLX protocol. After changing 
this file you probably have to restart the X server.

Regards,

Mattijs

It's possible to download a MacOSX  ParaView  version ?
If yes,  where ?

If not, where it's possible to find documentation to recompile ParaView
sources on MacOSX ?

Hi Roberto,

We do not have a precompiled binary for ParaView on the Mac, so you will 
need to download the source code either from the ParaView web site 
(http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html) or through CVS.  Your version 
of OSX must be at least Panther, and you must be using XWindows.  If you 
have met these conditions, follow the instructions 
(http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Install.html) for building ParaView on a 
unix/linux system.

- Amy

Charles,
      I again have time to look at the render module again. I have looked
through the PVPartDisplay and am not sure where the actortopf translator
would go. Which subclass were you thinking the translator would go in?
