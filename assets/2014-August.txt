Subject: [Paraview] Bad X server connection
Message-ID: <CAAPOYrGSZYYpXn2QwRNp1GhCv=X6KreWSthiUCDXoRMN4eGdow@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using ParaView 4.1.0 RC1 for Linux 64bit. I am connected via ssh and
when I am launching pvserver I get this :

Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://diablo.cerfacs.fr:11111
Accepting connection(s): diablo.cerfacs.fr:11111

Thus, the pvserver seems to work fine.

But when I am trying to connect to the server, I get this error message :


Client connected.
No protocol specified
ERROR: In
/home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,
line 531
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x130d6b0): bad X server connection. DISPLAY=:0

No protocol specified
ERROR: In
/home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,
line 322
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x130d6b0): bad X server connection. DISPLAY=:0

Segmentation fault (core dumped)


I don't know how to fix this because I don't really know where the problem
could come from. I launched a pvserver on an other machine and I could
connect without having this issue so I guess the problem doesn't come from
my client machine.

Do you have any hints about how to solve this ?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Screenshot question
Message-ID: <CAK=nJRSCfjhCd9zfkhSmGUfL9yQSXt_Hme24ZnhXqWxQKR35_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using Python's Tkinter to display a screenshot from Paraview. As part
of the app, I need to "get" some pixel colors in the screenshot. When I get
the screenshot using my own computer's function, the app works correctly.

(Just to be explicit, here's the steps involved:
1. Render the vtk file in Paraview
2. Screenshot the image, save as PNG
3. Convert PNG to PPM using an online tool
4. Display the PPM on a Tkinter Canvas
5. "Get" the RGB value at some pixel in the PPM image)

However, when the screenshot comes from Parview's own method, the RGB
values are always that of the image background - even though I've tested
which image coordinates I'm "getting" the pixel colors.

Do you have an explanation for why the pixels are only registering as the
background image? Or why there's this discrepancy between the two
screenshot methods?

Thanks!
Nikita

Hi all,

I am working on a programmable filter and I want to extract and analyze data generated by an isosurface. I'm having a hard time coming up with generic data to represent what I mean, but I'll try to describe it. 

I run my data and generate an isosurface for a single value. The resulting isosurface generates disconnected/independent blobs in space. I've attached an image of what it looks like. I would like to take each of those independent surfaces and manipulate them (compute volume of each, or maximum cross sectional area, or find a central axis, or delete them based on the computed volume, etc) but I can't figure out how to extract the data I need through VTK. I have the vtkPolyData array as well as the normals array, but I cannot figure out how to use that information to isolate and extract the independent surfaces. 

Does anybody have any suggestions or examples I can look at on how to manipulate the data?

Thanks,

Tim

Hi Tim,

You can try the Connectivity filter to create RegionId point and cell data
arrays to each blob set of cells. From there threshold can be used to pick
out individual blobs. You may need to use the merge blocks filter first
though if you're starting from a multiblock data set. I'm not sure if this
will work in parallel since the Connectivity filter could get
algorithmically complex. If you try it in parallel, I'd be interested in
knowing if it works or not.

Regards,
Andy

Message-ID: <4E5215E5BFF302498EEEE6D65C76C9B6203B03C1@XMBX4.uibk.ac.at>

Hi,
I downloaded and installed paraview via my ubuntu package manager.  I then generated some data with my code using a freshly installed netcdf library. Paraview can read and visualize that data without complaints. However, I now want to make use of the parallel I/O features that the new netcdf-4 (enhanced) data model (sometimes called Common Data Model) proviedes. The thing is that paraview obviously can't read the new file format. Every time I want to read data in the new netcdf4/HDF5 data model I get to a list of readers to choose from. I've been trying to find a solution for that for some while now, but I'm at a total loss, is there a hidden option somewhere? Should I reinstall paraview? I can also promise not to use any nasty HDF5 features in my files like groups or new fancy datatypes (there is creation flag for this NC_CLASSIC_MODEL) i.e. use the old data model but the new format if that helps.
Can you help me with this?
Best

I know how to select a cell manually and plot a quantity in the selection over time.
After that I can find the selection through "Find  Data" menu since "Selection Inspector"  is no more available.

But what if I know exactly the coordinates of a point which I want to select and I do not want to guest where it is visually?
Is it possible?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <608880426.15636.1407136670369.JavaMail.zimbra@stanford.edu>

Hi all,

I have been using File->Export Scene a lot lately to generate EPS/PDF figures.  For all of the figures I've been generating, I've wanted to use the same (non-default, advanced) export settings.  So each time I export a scene, I find myself clicking four or five buttons to get the correct settings, which gets a bit annoying after the tenth or twentieth image.

Of course, this inconvenience isn't too bad, but it would be very cool if there were a way to change the default settings for Export Scene.  Or at least have PV remember/default to the last export settings I used, across different instances of the program?  I looked and did not find a way to do this already - if this is already a feature and I'm just missing something, I would be grateful for anybody to point out the obvious thing I'm missing.  Otherwise, maybe it would be possible to have this considered as a feature request for the next PV release?

Thanks very much!

David

Hi David,

you can also generate a macro that will do it for you. Which will bring
down your interaction to 1 click.

Which version of ParaView does ubuntu provide?

True netcdf4 support first appeared in 3.98 as I recall.

Hi, my paraview is version 4.01 64-bit. I attached a sample file for 
you. It's generated from one of the netcdf example codes modified only 
by the additional creation flag NC_NETCDF4.

Hi David,

We are currently working on making it possible to set custom default
values throughout ParaView, and will target the Export Scene settings
for the ParaView 4.2 release.

For an idea of what this will look like, please see
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/702.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] what if you have two qt-installations?
Message-ID: <53DFD880.7070103@xs4all.nl>

Hello, 

On my system, I have 2 installations of QT5. One is the distribution
that comes with my linux distribution (qt5.1.1.openSuSe 13.1), the other
one is a more recent version (5.3.1), which I downloaded and installed
in a different location.
Using ccmake, setting the QT version to 5, as well as setting
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to qmake of the new location,
I still see that ccmake selects of number of qt5-libraries that belong
to the old SUSE-distribution, (e.g. libQt5Declarative.so, but many more,
in fact).  I can build paraview, though, and it even seems to work
(smoketest), but at program exit it segfaults.

I wonder how I can tell cmake to configure for 1 qt version. Surely, I
don't need to change all the entries by hand?

Thanks in advance
Bertwim

David,

The second JSON should be correct. However, these particular settings
are currently ignored in the Export Options dialog. I'll fix that.

One more thing: I changed the blog post to update the location of this
settings file, which should be
~/.config/ParaView/ParaView-UserSettings.json.

Thanks,
Cory

In the meantime, I followed a link on that blog post to http://kitware.com/blog/home/post/672 , which discusses changing default values by editing ~/.config/ParaView/UserSettings.json .  I looked in the ParaView source at ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/utilities.xml and found the properties that I wanted to change.  So I wrote the following UserSettings.json:

I have the following script for a Paraview Programmable filter:

#      max shear strain:   tau_max
#  These can be used for coloring, Spreadsheet view, formulas, threshold, etc
#
def process_block(block):
   #
   # Global coordinate strains
   # Assume strains loaded in Paraview
   xx = block.CellData['USTRTOTXX']
   yy = block.CellData['USTRTOTYY']
   zz = block.CellData['USTRTOTZZ']
   xy = block.CellData['USTRTOTXY']
   xz = block.CellData['USTRTOTZX']
   yz = block.CellData['USTRTOTYZ']

   for i in range(block.GetNumberOfCells()
      sigma = numpy.array([ [xx[i],xy[i],xz[i]],
                            [xy[i],yy[i],yz[i]],
                            [xz[i],yz[i],zz[i]]
                         ])

      # isotropic strain matrix
      iso = 1.0/3.0*numpy.trace(sigma)*numpy.eye(3)
      # deviatoric strain matrix
      dev = sigma - iso

      #principal strains
      eigvals = list(numpy.linalg.eigvalsh(sigma))
      eigvals.sort()
      eigvals.reverse()
      P1[i] = eigvals[0]
      P2[i] = eigvals[1]
      P3[i] = eigvals[2]
      # max shear
      max_shear[i] = (max(eigvals)-min(eigvals))/2.0

   block.CellData.append(P1,"P1_strain")
   block.CellData.append(P2,"P2_strain")
   block.CellData.append(P3,"P3_strain")
   block.CellData.append(max_shear,"tauMax")


# Loop over blocks in composite (Exodus) data set
for block in output:
   # process each block
   process_block(block)

After running this script, no errors or warnings are issued but the additional quantites (taumax, Px_strain) are not present as element quantities.

Any hints as to what I'm doing wrong.

system install may be first in the linker search path. have you checked? 
If that's it: rm your build, and in addition to QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE, 
prepend & export your qt install paths to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH 
before you run cmake. Each time when you run PV do the same.

Hello,

case, how many man hours would be estimated to develop a Catalyst Bridge and
get it to work in ParaView for a homegrown discrete element method code

needed for visualization is exposed to python? Just a ballpark guess
(min/max would be nice). I want to know how big of a project I am getting

Hi Simon,

I've gone through the process myself and it actually was not that painful, but how long it takes will depend on how familiar you are with VTK already. It's almost trivial if your code's data structures already use VTK. If they don't, then it's a matter of translating your data into the VTK data structures which isn't too bad in Python. 

Our code is in Fortran and is a parallel, finite volume, structured, multi-block code. So in some ways it's a bit easier to define the data structures in VTK as they are structured and I don't need to worry about connectivity. I wrote the wrappers and interface code in less than a week with no prior knowledge of VTK but a very strong desire to make it work :) This was a few years back when the documentation on Catalyst wasn't very mature so it was probably harder than it would have been now. 

I can't be any more specific or give you advice on how long it will take with your code, but it was much easier than I expected it to be when I did it. 

Tim

Hello ParaView,

I've inherited a project that writes plugins for ParaView 3.14.1, serial. While debugging I found out that the constructor for one of this project's file readers is called 3 times when loading a file. I thought this was odd, so I tried setting a break point on vtkUnstructuredGridReader's ctor and discovered that it's called twice. However, a constructor for vtk source plugin that I wrote is only called once, as I would have guessed for the others.

Is it normal for readers to have their constructors called multiple times when loading a file?

Thanks,
Mark

I thought it was twice. The first one ParaView when creates the reader 
to call CanReadFile in its search for potential readers of the file. The 
second one when it builds the pipeline.

Hi Simon,

It can be a fairly wide range to do that. I was able to do it for Chris
Kees' Proteus code in an hour. But he already had VTK data structures
created for his own internal in situ stuff and it was with Python so even
compilation issues were very easy (also, we sat down together to do it so
all of the knowledge was there). I generally try to allocate two weeks to
do that assuming that I'll do a decent amount of the work figuring out the
simulation code on my own as well as waiting some for answers to emails. If
the code isn't "cmakeified" then it also adds a bit of time to it as well.
If you're not that familiar with the simulation code I suggest focusing on
the part of the code that writes out the simulation information (grid and
fields) to files. That generally has all of the information you need to
know in order to create the VTK data structures to represent their data
structures.

Regards,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Meta File (*.mha,
 *.mhd) Import: Is header file transformation matrix used correctly?
Message-ID: <53E0C296.7090300@lnm.mw.tum.de>

Dear community,

while loading Meta Image Files (*.mhd *.mha), I noticed that the local 
coordinate
axes of the resulting array stack are aligned to the global coordinate 
axes,
though I would expect that the given transformation matrix within the 
header
part would lead to an arbitrarily aligned spatial configuration.

After some testing I discovered that changing the given header Offset 
vector
changes also the imported result, but changing the transformation matrix 
did not
influence the result at all.

Is this a bug? Or did I miss a relevant library?

I was testing on a precompiled Paraview v3.98 and a self-compiled (64bit 
Unix, Fedora 16) Paraview v4.1

Thanks for the answer
Andreas

	Format
Message-ID: <CAOKat72gvtSvjnUD7FzZLs=PGwxRcVBSDN50-BuOA83PQ5fXtw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to add vector information to an animation frame which is
in the VTK Legacy file format.

When just including the scalar information, I receive no errors when opening
the animation in paraview.

However, now when I append the vector information to the file, I receive
the following
error:

ERROR: In /build/buildd/paraview-3.10.1/VTK/IO/vtkDataReader.cxx, line 766

vtkPolyDataReader (0x39b5400): Unsupported cell attribute type: 0 for file:
cyl_res20_new/VTK/2D/DC100-material1-boundaryopen-observation10-time1e-09.1.vtk

I must be missing something with defining the data set, but I have followed
through the VTK file format documentation, and I can't see where I am going
wrong!

If you could take a quick look and see if I am missing something obvious I
would be most grateful!

Many Thanks
Hayan

Hi Simon,

I've gone through the process myself and it actually was not that painful, but 
how long it takes will depend on how familiar you are with VTK already. It's 
almost trivial if your code's data structures already use VTK. If they don't, 
then it's a matter of translating your data into the VTK data structures which 
isn't too bad in Python.

Our code is in Fortran and is a parallel, finite volume, structured, 
multi-block code. So in some ways it's a bit easier to define the data 
structures in VTK as they are structured and I don't need to worry about 
connectivity. I wrote the wrappers and interface code in less than a week with 
no prior knowledge of VTK but a very strong desire to make it work :) This was 
a few years back when the documentation on Catalyst wasn't very mature so it 
was probably harder than it would have been now.

I can't be any more specific or give you advice on how long it will take with 
your code, but it was much easier than I expected it to be when I did it.

Tim

Message-ID: <CAAPOYrF7LWwWp3VL+ap2s8wBVS=c_K5oGkQ+YPE5f+XCDC2-dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have written my own reader for ParaView and I am facing with some issues.

My version of ParaView is 4.1 for Windows-64 bit and I didn't build it from
sources.

As the wiki
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Reader>
describes, I wrote a Server Manager XML file.
Then I set the environment flag PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG.

Everything seems to work fine when I load the reader with Plugin Manager as
the output messages dialog box indicates :

***************************************************

Attempting to load
C:\Users\Windows\Documents\Travail\ParaviewProject\VTKReaders\Plugin\TecplotBinaryReader.xml

Loading XML plugin

Plugin instance located successfully. Now loading components from the
plugin instance based on the interfaces it implements.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Plugin Information:

Name : TecplotBinaryReader

Version : 1.0

ReqOnServer : 1

ReqOnClient : 0

ReqPlugins :

ServerManager Plugin : Yes

Python Plugin : No

But when I try to open a file, ParaView crashes and I get the following
error message :

ERROR: In
C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\ParaViewCore\ServerImplementation\Core\vtkSIProxy.cxx,
line 307

What am I doing wrong ?


Thanks in advance for your help.

Burlen's got it right. I am curious why the plugin was only called once.
Maybe there is no CanReadFile() or no file extension collision of something
like that in one case but not the other?

Mark: ProcessRequest() calls RDO(), RI(), and RD() (in that order) only
after paraview creates the instance that it will actually use to read the
file with. All are typically only called once, unless some parameter on the
reader changes. If RD is called more often check to see if image based
extents are mismatched.

Hi Burien, thanks for responding.

I have done you suggested, but to no avail.
Somehow, the path to the executable qmake is not sufficient to determine
all the other QT5 libraries.
Having said that, in one of the by now many attempts to get paraview
configured, I found that indeed the correct QT5 libraries were selected.
That build, however failed (missing symbol, cannot remember which one).
In trying to correct this is, the wrong QT5 libraries were selected by
ccmake. I just cannot figure out how this cmake thing works, or what I
can do to force it.
Any suggestions?

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Subject: [Paraview] file size with xdmf3 writer from trunk (paraview version
 4.1.0-1212-g781aa0e)
Message-ID: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD8225493C9D@umechp9h.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

I would like to convert (using "File->Safe Data" option) some pvtp file into xmf file using the new xdmf file exporter in ParaView trunk. The pvtp files were generated while running in parallel using 8 mpi processes, so I have 8 vtp files for every pvtp file. The pvtp file has a list out all the pieces (vtp files).  I also have 30 time steps for the data so I have 30 of the pvtp files.

When I tried to save it out using xdmf3 writer, the collection of pvtp and vtp files which are a total of  80MB in size grew to 1023MB in h5/xmf format. In another instance, a 817MB pvtp/vtp files grew to 13G when converted to h5/xmf file format.

Is there a compression that I can turn on to reduce the size of the file? Or is it something wrong (option not checked) that I am doing that cause the file size to increase more than 10 times?

thanks
-simon

"ffmpeg" will do this on Linux.

The command looks something like:

I think this may have to be a separate filter since there's quite a bit
involved in order to do this properly. The closest I can think of for doing
this is using the Mesh Quality filter and assuming that the shortest length
of a cell is in the normal direction for cells on the boundary of CFD
meshes. Additionally, I don't know if the Mesh Quality filter works for
prisms either.

Regards,
Andy

I've used Camtasia for this in the past.
http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html

This is not a free piece of software, however I believe that older versions
of the software can be obtained for free.

http://www.techsmith.com/download/oldversions.asp

camstudio (http://camstudio.org/) is an open source alternative too.

Probably a bug and not a case of a missing an option.

Can you share the pvtp and vtp files with me off list? Otherwise, please
advise me as to how to recreate the behavior with standard sources and/or
regression test data sets so I can investigate.

Thanks for trying the new reader and reporting the problem!

Missing a ":" here maybe?

Try some print debugging to see what is really happening.

Also, I recommend using an external editor and copy/pasting the code in or
execfile("yourfile.py")'ing to develop for the programmable filter. It's
QtTextWidget is a tad deficient as an IDE. :)

If not the ":" let us know and we can look further.

In a fresh build of paraview master on a mac, I can read this file without
a problem. When I go to open the file I'm given a choice of "CAM NetCDF
(Unstructured)" or "NetCDF files generic and CF conventions". Choose netcdf
cf and, accept defaults and hit apply and I see the data, curvilinear with
72/91 cells and points and two cell aligned float arrays, pressure and
temperature.

It is possible to turn OFF support for netcdf4 if VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 on
and HDF5_HL is off that will happen. I am guessing that is what is going on
here in ubuntu's ParaView package.

You can:
 try a nightly build from the kitware download site
 ask the ubuntu packager to turn it on in the future
 build paraview yourself from source

hmm, should show up in the output messages window and on the console. Start
paraview from a command line to see the console.

Agreed on the need for an example.

p.s. Please "reply all" to keep the discussion on the list so everyone can
contribute and benefit (or consider a kitware support contract).

Probably a bug and not a case of a missing an option.

Can you share the pvtp and vtp files with me off list? Otherwise, please 
advise me as to how to recreate the behavior with standard sources and/or 
regression test data sets so I can investigate.

Thanks for trying the new reader and reporting the problem!

	Hello,

	I would like to convert (using "File->Safe Data" option) some pvtp file into 
xmf file using the new xdmf file exporter in ParaView trunk. The pvtp files 
were generated while running in parallel using 8 mpi processes, so I have 8 
vtp files for every pvtp file. The pvtp file has a list out all the pieces 
(vtp files).  I also have 30 time steps for the data so I have 30 of the pvtp 
files.

	When I tried to save it out using xdmf3 writer, the collection of pvtp and 
vtp files which are a total of  80MB in size grew to 1023MB in h5/xmf format. 
In another instance, a 817MB pvtp/vtp files grew to 13G when converted to 
h5/xmf file format.

	Is there a compression that I can turn on to reduce the size of the file? Or 
is it something wrong (option not checked) that I am doing that cause the file 
size to increase more than 10 times?

	thanks
	-simon

Dear Axel,

No I haven't. To follow-up on your suggestion, I ran ccmake again to set
this parameter. No CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is in the list!
What I did try -and what did make a difference, was not only prepending
the path to qt5/lib to  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but also ensuring that qt/bin
was first in $PATH.  This indeed has the result that all libQt5
directories found were the correct ones.  Maybe that amounts to the same?

However, Now I have a different compile error:

CMakeFiles/QtTesting.dir/pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer.cxx.o: In
function `pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer::start()':
pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer.cxx:(.text+0x263): undefined reference to
`qt_filedialog_existing_directory_hook'
pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer.cxx:(.text+0x285): undefined reference to
`qt_filedialog_open_filename_hook'
pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer.cxx:(.text+0x2a7): undefined reference to
`qt_filedialog_open_filenames_hook'
pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer.cxx:(.text+0x2b4): undefined reference to
`qt_filedialog_save_filename_hook'
CMakeFiles/QtTesting.dir/pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer.cxx.o: In
function `pqNativeFileDialogEventPlayer::stop()':


etc.

Any ideas?

Hi David,

that helped a lot, thanks very much. I downloaded v4.1 from the paraview 
site and it opens netcdf-4 as you describe.

thanks again

Subject: [Paraview] what if you have two qt-installations?

Dear Bertwim,


good to hear that.

sorry - CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is an environment variable like "PATH" and
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH" to hint install directories to CMake modules.

The compile error still looks like something got mixed - can you try
again with the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH hint?
Did you verify all "advanced" variables set from the FindQt module with
ccmake?


Best,
Axel

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView] Unofficial ParaView 4.1.0 SDK for Windows 32
	and 64-bit
Message-ID: <53E226A9.8070002@bluecape.com.pt>

Greetings to all!

We at blueCAPE have made available an unofficial SDK of ParaView 4.1.0 
for Windows 32 and 64-bit, based on the official SuperBuild and 
respective build options. It's available here: 
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Downloads#ParaView_4.1.0
Instructions on how these packages were built is provided here: 
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes410

According to our tests, it's possible to use this SDK to build plug-ins 
and any other associated applications, which will work with the 
respective official ParaView 4.1.0 builds for Windows. A proof of 
concept we've used is the vtkPOFFReader plug-in which was successfully 
built with these SDK packages: 
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/vtkPOFFReaderBuilds

Note: We roughly used the same development environment as the original 
ParaView 4.1.0 binaries for Windows: 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries - although we've used 
MSVC 2008 C++ Express and did not have a respective FORTRAN compiler 
(which requires the Professional version either way), which is why we 
needed to do some adjustments to build Open-MPI with success.

Furthermore, here's a bit of a back story and the current status of this 
endeavour:

  * Back in January 2012 we at blueCAPE began to try to bring back the
    development installers of ParaView for Windows, which was last
    officially available for ParaView 3.8.1.
  * The overall features available in the development installers we
    created were still missing important files, because we were still
    basing ourselves on the infrastructure that was still remnant from
    ParaView 3.8.1.
  * Nonetheless, we made available our findings and builds for ParaView
    3.12.0, 3.14.0, 3.14.1 and 3.98.0, where the last release we managed
    to build was back in January 2013.
  * ParaView fortunately kept evolving since then. We missed the
    versions 3.98.1 and 4.0.1, due to time constraints on our side and a
    few failed builds.
  * As far as we can see, ParaView 4.1.0 already has a pretty good SDK
    structure which evolved overtime. The official SuperBuild repository
    also already provides many of the necessary features for making the
    SDK releases, at least for the Unix-like environments.
  * This Summer 2014 we at blueCAPE finally managed to get around back
    to trying and adjust the SuperBuild settings to build and deliver a
    ParaView 4.1.0 SDK for Windows and believe we have successfully
    achieved it. The changes have been shared and referenced in the
    following wiki page at our project:
    https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes410
  * In addition to this, after some reviewing and building tests with
    the latest commits on the master branch from the SuperBuild
    repository, we have adapted most of the changes we've developed for
    the SDK build above and have submitted two commits to Kitware
    Gerrit, namely:
      o http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4487/
      o http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4488/
  * We haven't managed to create the NSIS and ZIP packages through
    CMake/CPack, but our main concern has mostly been on having a
    working SDK.

Hopefully this can help bring sooner the ParaView SDK in future versions 
in a more official way... so that we won't have to look into generating 
the NSIS/ZIP packages ourselves, nor build Qt 4.8.6 ;)

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!

Best regards,
Bruno Santos

PS: I haven't sent this email to the ParaView Developers mailing list 
simply because previous emails I've sent on this topic have been to this 
main mailing list.

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED

Hello,

I would like to run some of my VTK python code under ParaView (pvbatch or
pvpython). Where can I find documentation on porting VTK python code to use
ParaView python api? I need to create some VTK object in ParaView. Is there
a shortcut to this (like being able to use VTK python api within ParaView
Python environment)?  Or am I not making sense / asking the wrong question.

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks

It may not be possible to do what you want explicitly. ParaView can be
viewed in some ways a wrapper around VTK filters. You can try the
programmable filter which uses the VTK Python API but is still intended to
operate like a filter (i.e. not modifying the input data sets, etc.).

Hi Simon,

if the VTK work that you are targeting is not parallel, you can directly
run a vtkpython script inside pvpython or pvbatch.
Otherwise Andy is right, you can not mix parallel ParaView and VTK python
code.

Hi Andy,

I think the filter option may not be viable as the VTK code is the part that 
creates the VTK data structure (points - vtk.vtkPoints(), triangles - 
vtk.vtkCellArray, polydata - vtk.vtkPolydata()) using VTK python api.

This is actually related to the catalyst question I asked. Luckily the user's 
code is in python already and Sean Ziegeler mentioned to bypass catalyst and 
just call ParaView using PV Python api (and run the simulation code python 
script using pvbath/pvpython). But the user's code is in VTK python and not 
ParaView python which caused some issue here.

In that regards, are there documentation that I can look up on the comparable 
Python API between VTK and ParaView?

Thanks
-simon

It may not be possible to do what you want explicitly. ParaView can be viewed 
in some ways a wrapper around VTK filters. You can try the programmable filter 
which uses the VTK Python API but is still intended to operate like a filter 
(i.e. not modifying the input data sets, etc.).

Adding to what Andy and Seb said,

"ParaView can be viewed in some ways a wrapper around VTK filters" + that
often exist on remote MPI parallel processes + "."

In Paraview client side scripts (tools->Python Shell or pvpython or
pvbatch) you create python objects that create proxies that create remote
vtk objects somewhere. Which is why it is not typically safe to mix vtk and
paraview python code and do things like modifying the input data sets. See
python trace and the paraview python wiki page to learn about this level of
scripting.

Within the python programmable filter and source, you are running inside
those remote processes. Here the API is pretty much standard python wrapped
VTK. See the wiki page about python programmable filters for starters and
standard vtk documentation to learn details about this secondary level of
scripting.

Hi Simon,

There is more information at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter. The ParaView
Python API is meant for the client side of ParaView while the VTK Python
API is meant for the server side. You can mix and match a bit by using
Fetch() (see http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting for
more details) where you start on the client with the ParaView Python API
and then "fetch" the output from a filter to the client to be able to do
VTK Python API stuff on VTK objects. For big jobs in parallel though this
fetch operation can overwhelm the client with memory use.

Regards,
Andy

Hi Seb,

Thanks. Good point. I have assumed I am dealing with parallel code. Let me 
check up on that.

Basically the whole purpose of this exercise is to have the simulation code 
generate the data and visualize the data in real time (ParaView + catalyst).

If the code is not parallel, maybe we can just skip ParaView completely and 
just use VTK to pop up the window and do the rendering when the data is 
generated?

Or if the code is not parallel, we should change all the VTK python code into 
ParaView python code? And run it with pvpython.

Which option would be the right way to do thing?

Or if the code is parallel, then the only option is to change the VTK code 
into ParaView code?

Thanks
-simon

Hi Simon,


There is more information at 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter. The ParaView Python 
API is meant for the client side of ParaView while the VTK Python API is meant 
for the server side. You can mix and match a bit by using Fetch() (see 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting for more details) where 
you start on the client with the ParaView Python API and then "fetch" the 
output from a filter to the client to be able to do VTK Python API stuff on 
VTK objects. For big jobs in parallel though this fetch operation can 
overwhelm the client with memory use.


Regards,
Andy

	Thanks

	It may not be possible to do what you want explicitly. ParaView can be viewed
	in some ways a wrapper around VTK filters. You can try the programmable 
filter
	which uses the VTK Python API but is still intended to operate like a filter
	(i.e. not modifying the input data sets, etc.).

Hi Simon,

Catalyst is a bit different as well. And Andy could provide more info on
that.

So the answer will greatly depend on which section of the code you are
trying to work on.
- adapter that fill the trivial producer for catalyst
- processing pipeline inside catalyst
- ParaView post-processing for live in-situ visualization

Subject: [Paraview] Tetrahedral Mesh Quality
Message-ID: <1407365783652.88530@kcl.ac.uk>

Hello Community,


I need to evaluate the quality of my tetrahedral mesh for simulations in structural mechanics and want to apply the filter 'Mesh Quality' using the 'Scaled Jacobian' metric. Paraview (4.0.1) calculates the values providing me with a range of [0.1,1.0] and the 'Histrogram' looks like a Gauss distribution with a mean around 0.6. I wanted to find out more about how this metric is calculated for tetrahedral elements and looked up the 'Verdict Library Reference Manual', which states the following:


acceptable range:    [0.500 , 0.707]

normal range:          [-0.707 , 0.707]

full range:                [-dbl_max , dbl_max]


It also states that the 'Scaled Jacobian' for a unit equilateral tetrahedron, in my humble opinion a perfect tetrahedron, is 1. As far as I understand these ranges the full range provides values if some error/problem occurs, the normal range should be the range of mathematically possible values and the acceptable range is where somebody wants his elements to be in. The 'Scaled Jacobian' of a unit equilateral tetrahedron, however, doesn't fall in the acceptable range or even worse, in the normal range. Do I misunderstand the provided ranges? I also tested a equilateral tetrahedron in Paraview and by hand with the 'Scaled Jacobian' metric and I always obtained 1. Thank you for your help!


Best, Thomas

Hi Axel,

setting CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH does not make a difference. The  special
variables left that have a reference to the wrong qt installation are
QT_QT3SUPPORT_LIBRARY and QT3SUPPORT_LIBRARY_RELEASE variables.  Qt5
does no longer provide Qt4 support .

Also QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY and QT_QDBUS and QT_GUI_LIBRARY_  are wrong ....
The correspinding HEADER-varinant are ok, though.
What does this tell me?

Regards,
Bertwim

Message-ID: <CAM3A=6hZmF5xTDVhc5xHJnyhQWeK-1YKHD3R4+LNjucACmfdqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a quick question.
How to plot a point variable over time?

It seems the procedure mentioned in the following mailing list refer to the
previous version of the Paraview.
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-November/026633.html

Thank you for your help in advance.

Warm regards,
Rakesh

Hm, looks like the cleanest way to get it running is to remove default
installations of qt from the system path(s) and to specificity only one
specific installation via environment flags.

(I am suggesting something that can be achieved with a module system,
e.g. on a cluster)

Alternatively you can try to scratch all the advanced flags together
that are still wrong and set them by hand.

Yep, but basically it is still an environment problem.

Axel

Subject: [Paraview] Nightly Downloads for ParaView Lion-Python27 broken
Message-ID: <D008E155.258F4%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The downloads for the nightly Mac OS build of ParaView-Darwin-64bit-Lion-Python27-NIGHTLY.dmg appear to be broken on the paraview.org web page. When I download the file using the "Releases" form, I get what appears to be a 4.1 build instead of the nightly. If I download the file using the "Nightly Builds" form, I get a corrupt or incomplete file.

Both methods of downloading the other nightly Mac OS build seem to work fine.

This is really cool! We should try to integrate the open mpi changes
as those seem really reasonable.


As far as building Qt, this is required for two reasons. The first is
that the Qt 4.8 series only has 32bit official binaries for windows,
and we would need 32 and 64bit. If we moved to Qt 5.X it would be
possible to use the official binaries, as long as moved to VS
2010/2012.

Now the reason that we currently build with VS 2008 is because of hard
requirements in the python build system. I know that people are
investigating a new build system for python that supports VS 2010 /
VS2012.  So if ParaView is ever able to use the new python build
system, and officially moves over to Qt 5.X we should transition to
use the official Qt binaries for windows.

Hi Bruno,

Can I ask why you picked MSVC 2008 C++ Express version over MSVC 2013 C++
Express version to do the compilation? 

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView] Unofficial ParaView 4.1.0 SDK for Windows 32
and 64-bit

Greetings to all!

We at blueCAPE have made available an unofficial SDK of ParaView 4.1.0 for
Windows 32 and 64-bit, based on the official SuperBuild and respective build
options. It's available here:
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Downloads#Par
aView_4.1.0
Instructions on how these packages were built is provided here:
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes410

According to our tests, it's possible to use this SDK to build plug-ins and
any other associated applications, which will work with the respective
official ParaView 4.1.0 builds for Windows. A proof of concept we've used is
the vtkPOFFReader plug-in which was successfully built with these SDK
packages:
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/vtkPOFFReader
Builds

Note: We roughly used the same development environment as the original
ParaView 4.1.0 binaries for Windows:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries - although we've used MSVC
2008 C++ Express and did not have a respective FORTRAN compiler (which
requires the Professional version either way), which is why we needed to do
some adjustments to build Open-MPI with success.

Furthermore, here's a bit of a back story and the current status of this
endeavour:


*	Back in January 2012 we at blueCAPE began to try to bring back the
development installers of ParaView for Windows, which was last officially
available for ParaView 3.8.1.
*	The overall features available in the development installers we
created were still missing important files, because we were still basing
ourselves on the infrastructure that was still remnant from ParaView 3.8.1.
*	Nonetheless, we made available our findings and builds for ParaView
3.12.0, 3.14.0, 3.14.1 and 3.98.0, where the last release we managed to
build was back in January 2013.
	
*	ParaView fortunately kept evolving since then. We missed the
versions 3.98.1 and 4.0.1, due to time constraints on our side and a few
failed builds.
*	As far as we can see, ParaView 4.1.0 already has a pretty good SDK
structure which evolved overtime. The official SuperBuild repository also
already provides many of the necessary features for making the SDK releases,
at least for the Unix-like environments.
*	This Summer 2014 we at blueCAPE finally managed to get around back
to trying and adjust the SuperBuild settings to build and deliver a ParaView
4.1.0 SDK for Windows and believe we have successfully achieved it. The
changes have been shared and referenced in the following wiki page at our
project:
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes410
*	In addition to this, after some reviewing and building tests with
the latest commits on the master branch from the SuperBuild repository, we
have adapted most of the changes we've developed for the SDK build above and
have submitted two commits to Kitware Gerrit, namely:
	

	*	http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4487/
	*	http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4488/

*	We haven't managed to create the NSIS and ZIP packages through
CMake/CPack, but our main concern has mostly been on having a working SDK.

Hopefully this can help bring sooner the ParaView SDK in future versions in
a more official way... so that we won't have to look into generating the
NSIS/ZIP packages ourselves, nor build Qt 4.8.6 ;)

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!

Best regards,
Bruno Santos

PS: I haven't sent this email to the ParaView Developers mailing list simply
because previous emails I've sent on this topic have been to this main

Hi Casey,

I've tried this like in your suggestion:

SetActiveSource(IntegrateVariables1)
DataSetCSVWriter()
FileName="foo_points.csv"
FieldAssociation = "Points"
UpdatePipeline()

and other similar commands but none produced a csv file. Any hints?

Thanks

Do you get any error messages in the python console or output window?

What type of data does your source produce polydata, unstructured grid, etc?

Hi Casey,

I get no error and I read my data with XMLPartitionedUnstructuredGridReader.

I tried this in the binary download of paraview 4.1

>>> s = Sphere()

>>> w = DataSetCSVWriter(s, FileName='/tmp/test.csv',
FieldAssociation='Points')

>>> w.UpdatePipeline()

>>>

and successfully had a file written.

You might try explicitly passing your reader as input to the
DataSetCSVWriter rather than relying on the active source.

I am not familiar with partitioned unstructured grid to know if any
additional steps are needed.

good luck

Hi Casey,

On a somewhat related topic,

>>> s = Sphere()
>>> sum = 2 + 1
>>> w = DataSetCSVWriter(s, FileName='/tmp/test.csv', 
>>> FieldAssociation='Points')
>>> w.UpdatePipeline()

If I want to just write the value of variable sum to a csv file, how would 
that be done?

Thanks
-simon

OpenMPI dropped support for windows some time ago. Would it not make 
sense to use MS MPI?

Greetings Simon,

The reason is simple: because the official builds of ParaView are 
usually done with MSVC 2008: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries
If we didn't use that version, it would lead to conflicts with the 
runtime libraries used by the official ParaView binaries versus the 
plug-ins built using the SDK we've provided.

Best regards,
Bruno

Greetings Robert,

Thanks for the feedback!

Then perhaps I should give it a spin to also SuperBuild with Qt 4.8.6 
and provide the changes/hacks necessary to include the Qt SDK in the 
ParaView SDK...

Which reminds me: can the Python version be bumped up at least from 
2.7.3 to 2.7.8 in the next ParaView version? I haven't reported this as 
a feature request nor Gerrit commit for review, since it's possible that 
there is also some other limitation on your side, possibly regarding 
multi-platform compatibility or the same MSVC version issue?

Best regards,
Bruno

Greetings Bruno,

Thanks. And per Robert, ParaView binaries are done with vs2008 due to Python
build system. I tried to build python 2.7.8 (the very last dependency
library) with vs2013 express but failed miserably (even with what Gerson
Kurz how to list to build python 3.3.4 with Visual Studio 2013). Thankfully
I was able to find the link to download vs2008 express iso.

Thanks

Greetings Simon,

The reason is simple: because the official builds of ParaView are usually
done with MSVC 2008: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries
If we didn't use that version, it would lead to conflicts with the runtime
libraries used by the official ParaView binaries versus the plug-ins built
using the SDK we've provided.

Best regards,
Bruno

Windows 32
	and 64-bit
	
	Greetings to all!
	
	We at blueCAPE have made available an unofficial SDK of ParaView
4.1.0 for
	Windows 32 and 64-bit, based on the official SuperBuild and
respective build
	options. It's available here:
	
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Downloads#Par
	aView_4.1.0
	Instructions on how these packages were built is provided here:
	
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes410
	
	According to our tests, it's possible to use this SDK to build
plug-ins and
	any other associated applications, which will work with the
respective
	official ParaView 4.1.0 builds for Windows. A proof of concept we've
used is
	the vtkPOFFReader plug-in which was successfully built with these
SDK
	packages:
	
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/vtkPOFFReader
	Builds
	
	Note: We roughly used the same development environment as the
original
	ParaView 4.1.0 binaries for Windows:
	http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries - although we've used
MSVC
	2008 C++ Express and did not have a respective FORTRAN compiler
(which
	requires the Professional version either way), which is why we
needed to do
	some adjustments to build Open-MPI with success.
	
	Furthermore, here's a bit of a back story and the current status of
this
	endeavour:
	
	
	*	Back in January 2012 we at blueCAPE began to try to bring
back the
	development installers of ParaView for Windows, which was last
officially
	available for ParaView 3.8.1.
	*	The overall features available in the development installers
we
	created were still missing important files, because we were still
basing
	ourselves on the infrastructure that was still remnant from ParaView
3.8.1.
	*	Nonetheless, we made available our findings and builds for
ParaView
	3.12.0, 3.14.0, 3.14.1 and 3.98.0, where the last release we managed
to
	build was back in January 2013.
		
	*	ParaView fortunately kept evolving since then. We missed the
	versions 3.98.1 and 4.0.1, due to time constraints on our side and a
few
	failed builds.
	*	As far as we can see, ParaView 4.1.0 already has a pretty
good SDK
	structure which evolved overtime. The official SuperBuild repository
also
	already provides many of the necessary features for making the SDK
releases,
	at least for the Unix-like environments.
	*	This Summer 2014 we at blueCAPE finally managed to get
around back
	to trying and adjust the SuperBuild settings to build and deliver a
ParaView
	4.1.0 SDK for Windows and believe we have successfully achieved it.
The
	changes have been shared and referenced in the following wiki page
at our
	project:
	
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes410
	*	In addition to this, after some reviewing and building tests
with
	the latest commits on the master branch from the SuperBuild
repository, we
	have adapted most of the changes we've developed for the SDK build
above and
	have submitted two commits to Kitware Gerrit, namely:
		
	
		*	http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4487/
		*	http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4488/
	
	*	We haven't managed to create the NSIS and ZIP packages
through
	CMake/CPack, but our main concern has mostly been on having a
working SDK.
	
	Hopefully this can help bring sooner the ParaView SDK in future
versions in
	a more official way... so that we won't have to look into generating
the
	NSIS/ZIP packages ourselves, nor build Qt 4.8.6 ;)
	
	If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!
	
	Best regards,
	Bruno Santos
	
	PS: I haven't sent this email to the ParaView Developers mailing
list simply
	because previous emails I've sent on this topic have been to this
main
	mailing list.

Greetings J?r?my,

If you had provided the XML file, it would have been a bit easier to 
diagnose this ourselves.
Nonetheless, it seems to me that the issue is that the class/library 
"vtkPTecplotBinaryReader" is simply not loadable. A bit of searching 
online and in ParaView's source code leads me to believe that only the 
class "vtkTecplotReader" is available for loading through an XML only 
plug-in.

If the class "vtkPTecplotBinaryReader" is a custom library you've 
built/created from source code, then have a look at a recent email I 
sent to this very same mailing list: 
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2014-August/031817.html

Best regards,
Bruno

As far as I can understand/deduce:

 1. The ParaView dev team switched from Open-MPI 1.6.2 backwards to
    1.4.4, precisely because the support was dropped. I guess the 1.4.4
    version provided a more stable'ish working version than 1.6.2.
 2. MS-MPI originated from MPICH2 source code for Windows. And MPICH2 is
    no longer supported on Windows, because MS-MPI is the go-to build of
    MPICH2 for Windows.
 3. Problem is that the source code for the current MS-MPI builds does
    not seem to be publicly available, which might be why ParaView isn't
    linking to it in the first place. Although I vaguely remember a
    ParaView version that was linked to a stub MPI, possibly because of
    that...

I'm not sure about this, Kitware folks could clarify. If ParaView 
developers are picking an MPI implementation, then it should probably be 
MS MPI. It's the only option going forward, as other porjects have 
dropped support some time ago. Using the aging versions of OpenMPI/MPICH 
are going to be problematic as windows platform compilers etc evolves.

Is that really a problem?

Subject: [Paraview] Variable in Calculator Filter in batch script
Message-ID: <CAKf_S2LYd5vNv2rdf=Um_FLJpZZq6Qp3sojv9fqX+1fvpmOcCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to pass a variable name to the Calculator Filter in a batch
script, something like
A=500
Calculator1.Function = 'min(coordsZ,A)'

This gives an error message:
"...Syntax error: expecting a variable name...".

What's the correct form?

Thank you
Denis

I think the following should work:

[CALL FOR PAPERS]

*********************************************************************

CLASP 2014: The 2014 International Workshop on Advances in Cloud Computing
Legislation, Accountability, Security and Privacy

In conjunction with the 7th IEEE/ACM IEEE/ACM International Conference on
Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2014)

Link: https://crow.org.nz/clasp2014.html

*********************************************************************

 

Date: 8-11 December 2014

Location: London, UKB

 

Important dates:

Paper submission due: 24 August 2014 (PST midnight)

Notification of acceptance: 15 September 2014 

Early registration deadline: 29 September 2014

 

Overview

The success of cloud computing hinges on striking an effective balance
between security, trust and privacy concerns. In addition, governments have
to ensure that both domestic and international legislations align with the
evolving challenges resulting from the maturity of cloud computing as a
mainstream IT business model. The nature of a trusted third party (e.g. an
offshore cloud service provider) has also pushed policy making to the
limits. For example, what should institutions consider when they are
employing a cloud service provider, which hosts their data in an offshore
data center? There are many technical and policy aspects relating to this
research area, and in this workshop, we seek to provide a platform for the
engagement and discussion of this interesting, multi-disciplinary topic. We
also welcome emerging innovative concepts and analysis which will shape the
cloud computing landscape from a technical perspective.

 

Topics of Interest

We welcome technical-, policy- and/or legal-oriented submissions related to
(but not limited to) the following:

 

-Cloud accountability 

-Cloud data analytics

-Cloud data governance

-Cloud forensics

-Cloud privacy

-Cloud provenance

-Cloud security (e.g. cryptographic techniques and protocols)

-Cloud trust

-Cloud visualizations

 

We also welcome survey papers as well as novel proposals for a paradigm
shift on one or more of the above topics.

 

For submission details, please refer to the web page (link provided at the
top) for more information.

Subject: [Paraview] Using time in Python script
Message-ID: <CAG+yLxnh8UuXQ=POeET0HwRCjsW4iV5RBuscw5b5bONXO5phpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have data in time that has time points like
{0.02124,0.04248,0.06372,0.08496, etc.}

I wrote a python script to loop through these time points with time
increment of 0.02124 and export as .csv.

----------------------------------------------

for x in range(1, 4):

currentT = x*deltaT
AnimationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()
 RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = currentT
RenderView1.ViewTime = currentT
 RenderView1.CacheKey = currentT
RenderView1.UseCache = 1
RenderView1.UseCache = 0

 SetActiveSource(data)
writer = CreateWriter("output.csv")
 writer.FieldAssociation = "Points"
writer.UpdatePipeline()
del writer

Render()

------------------------------------------

When I played the macro, some time points were not correctly read. (e.g.
 the 4th time point spreadsheet saved data that belong to the 3rd time
point.)

I used "start trace" to see how paraview handles time, and here is what I
caught:

--------------------------------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

AnimationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()
RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = 0.021239999681711197

RenderView1.ViewTime = 0.021239999681711197
RenderView1.CacheKey = 0.021239999681711197
RenderView1.UseCache = 1

AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = 0.042479999363422394

RenderView1.ViewTime = 0.042479999363422394
RenderView1.CacheKey = 0.042479999363422394
RenderView1.UseCache = 1

AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = 0.06372000277042389

RenderView1.ViewTime = 0.06372000277042389
RenderView1.CacheKey = 0.06372000277042389
RenderView1.UseCache = 1

AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = 0.08495999872684479

RenderView1.ViewTime = 0.08495999872684479
RenderView1.CacheKey = 0.08495999872684479
RenderView1.UseCache = 1

RenderView1.UseCache = 0

Render()
--------------------------------------------------------
Then I realized, if I tried to read data at 0.08496, it will read data from
the previous time point instead. If I explicitly specify in my script to
read data at time 0.08495999872684479, then it will read the correct data.

Anyone has any insights?
Thanks in advance!!!

Hi,

I was wondering if it was possible to use the Stream Tracer filter to show
the path of moving objects in a simulation? The objects were created in
Yade and they simply fall to a surface and exhibit buoyancy.

Thanks,

That is correct. That's  precisely why we've stuck with 1.4.4. I spent
a lot of time trying to packing 1.6.* on Windows to no success and
then decided to just stick with 1.4.4.

The problem with using MS-MPI is two fold:
1. I can't remember if its support MPIv2 API. I don't think so, but I
may be wrong.
2. The license (at least when I checked) doesn't allow us to packing
the dlls in our binaries. In other words, we would always have to have
the user manually install using the installer distributed by MS.

Rakesh,

The dataset you included doesn't have any timesteps. Nor I do I see
any variable named "displacement". The only variables available are
"uvw". To plot over time, you select the cells or point that you want
plot over time and the create the "Plot Over Time" filter. That would
show you a plot of the attributes for the selected elements over time.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView can't create the reader

Thank you very much for your answer.

I am sorry for my awful English and I hope you'll understand what I am
writing.

I read the email you sent and I tried to build my reader following the
instructions provided here :
https://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/vtkPOFFReaderBuilds

First of all, I downloaded this archive :
ParaView-4.1.0-win64-complete_dev-r2.exe
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluecfd-sc/files/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/ParaView-4.1.0/ParaView-4.1.0-win64-complete_dev-r2.exe/download>
Then I installed Qt 4.8.2 from here :
https://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/. Finally when I am trying to
configure my reader with the CMake GUI, the QT_MAKE_EXECUTABLE can't be
found even if I select qmake.exe directly from the path.

<http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluecfd-sc/files/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/ParaView-4.1.0/ParaView-4.1.0-win64-complete_dev-r2.exe/download>
In fact I am a beginner and I don't really know how to use CMake. I
modified the CMakeLists.txt that I found here :
http://sourceforge.net/p/of-interfaces/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/vtkPOFFReader/
but I am not sure about what I wrote. My CMakeLists file is joined with
this message.

Besides, I noticed that when I am executing
*qt-win64-opensource-4.8.2-vs2008.exe,
*a dialog box with the following message is opened :

*A installation of Visual Studio 2008 was not found in the registry ,
guessing path...*

In spite of that, the installation seems to work perfectly fine but : I
have Visual C++ Express 2008 on my computer so is it normal to get this
message ?

To finish, I would like to ask you one last question :
Given I didn't develop any GUI feature for my reader, do I still need QT ?

I thank you again for your help.

Hi Utkarsh,

I think it does implement MPI2. At least my codes make heavy use of MPI 
2 and it works fine. However, I'll look into it and report back.

Microsoft's documentation says:

    You may also redistribute this MS-MPI installation package with your
    own applications, to facilitate having an application that can run
    on a stand-alone workstation and easily take advantage of an HPC
    Pack 2012 R2-based cluster. Please refer to the license agreement
    for additional details. 


Sounds like if you use an installer it could handle the dependency.

Additionally, you need to run the installer as admin since it installs
a daemon (I believe). I think it would make sense to put out two
version of Windows binaries (without MPI and with MS MPI) and then
include the MSMPI installer as a part of the installation process,
esp. since no other Windows MPI is officially supported any more.

Something to think about for 4.3, not sure I want to make the plunge
for 4.2 -- but we'll keep the options open :).

Subject: [Paraview] Support for QT5 broken with qt 5.3.X?

Message-ID: <53E9D45C.3020105@xs4all.nl>

Could it be that the support for Qt 5.3.x is broken in Paraview?

When I upgraded from Qt5.2.1 to Qt5.3.1 recompiled paraview, I always
get link errors as described below.
On inspection, I noticed that symbols like

'qt_filedialog_existing_directory_hook' are no longer found in Qt5.3.1, whereas they still are there in Qt5.2.1.
I don't know how how ParaView implicitly uses these symbols, perhaps knows more on this.

Kind Regadds,
Bertwim

David Sansome and JC Fillion-Robin have created a CMake-ified version of Python that will build with other versions of VS:

  https://github.com/davidsansome/python-cmake-buildsystem/

but currently (as of a month ago) it does not support debug builds -- which is something we most probably require before moving ParaView to use it.

First of all, your English looks pretty good!

OK, let's see if I can address all of the issues:

 1. Make sure you downloaded the 3 files that were needed for installing
    Qt 4.8.2, namely the file "qt-win64-opensource-4.8.2-vs2008.exe" and
    the two associated "*.bin" files. The 3 files should be placed in
    the same folder before running the installer.
 2. In CMake, define the variable "QT_MAKE_EXECUTABLE" to use the path
    "C:/Qt/4.8.2_x64/bin/qmake.exe" (adjust accordingly if necessary)
    and then click on "Configure" once again. Hopefully it will now pick
    up everything related to Qt.
     1. Mmm... still regarding this point, if you in fact gave the
        correct path, it might not work properly if the Qt installation
        is somehow incomplete. This happened to me when I tried to
        configure the project with CMake, while I was still midway of
        the installation of Qt.
     2. Furthermore, there was a detail I forgot to write on the wiki
        page, but when using MSVC 2008 Express, by default it does not
        provide the ability to compile 64-bit applications. Instructions
        on how to do so can be found online, for example here:
        https://github.com/enGits/engrid/wiki/Configure-Microsoft-Visual-Studio-2008-Express-to-also-build-for-Windows-x64
     3. And there is yet another import detail: when you configure the
        project in CMake's GUI for the first time, it asks you which
        compiler to use. Make sure you pick "Visual Studio 9 2008
        Win64". If you pick the standard non-Win64, it's natural that
        the 64-bit "qmake.exe" is incompatible with the 32-bit Visual
        Studio build options.
 3. Regarding the files you've provided in attachment:
     1. The XML looks OK. I only have some experience with creating
        these types of XML file, so I'm not yet able to point out any
        major flaws without looking into ParaView's own XML
        filter/reader files. The complete XML file I'm referring to is
        in the folder
        "ParaViewCore\ServerManager\SMApplication\Resources" in
        ParaView's source code.
     2. The "CMakeLists.txt" looks OK as well, but again, I don't have
        enough experience on this. Only by trial and error would I be
        able to see if your file is working properly.
     3. I suggest that you first try building the plug-in
        "vtkPOFFReader", just to confirm if you have a working building
        environment. This way it'll be easier to isolate the origin of
        any problems.
 4. "I have Visual C++ Express 2008 on my computer so is it normal to
    get this message ?"*/
    /*
      * Yes, it's normal. It happens to me as well and it works without
        any problems.
 5. Due to how ParaView was built in this case, I think it's best to use
    Qt 4.8.2 (namely with the respective architecture), just in case. I
    say this because there are a lot of library dependencies that are
    automatically configured and it might get a bit complicated to push
    aside the existing dependencies on Qt.

I hope I didn't miss anything.

Best regards,
Bruno

Message-ID: <4B369AEB-431A-4D49-B379-C1588DE94AB2@uvm.edu>

Hi, 

I'm using paraview 4.1.0-64bit and i'm trying to simply add streamlines from a 3D flow to a slice.  This happens automatically if i start with 2D data but i cannot seem to make it work with 3D data.  I've tried using the surface LIC plugin, but i when i activate it and try to use it as a representation nothing happens, the slice looks like it does without surface LIC.  I changed all the parameters to what should be applicable to my data and still, nothing happens.  Paraview is not even asking if i would like to apply the changes.

The second approach i tried was to use this tutorial:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Custom_Filters

but i'm not even sure how that is stared, is there a more step by step approach where they do this from initial raw data to the final form. I cannot get this to work.    This seems like something that should be pretty straight forward.   

The flow i'm trying to visualize is a 3D convective cell.


thanks for the help,

Hi Ryan,

Try using Surface Vectors filter to remove the out of surface component 
from the vector field, and make sure your seeds are exactly on the surface.

As far as surface lic, are you sure you selected the right vector field? 
If yes, please share the data and I'll see if I can duplicate the issue.

Hi Dennis,

I took a look at the filter to see what might be wrong, but I seem to be
missing a couple of things:

1) Are you using the "Copy Arrays" option of the programmable filter?
Otherwise you will need to reference the input data as well.

2) Where are the P1,P2,P3, etc vectors created?  What type are they?

The below script worked for me if Copy Arrays is enabled.  I used the
can.ex2 example dataset from paraview and ensured the "Object Ids" cell
data was selected in the reader.

for oblock in output:

   oid = oblock.CellData['ObjectId']

   o2 = oid + 10

   oblock.CellData.append(o2, 'newdata')

Hope that helps

I am not aware of any paraview specific way to do that.  You could try the
standard python csv module https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html  or
use numpy savetxt for arrays
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savetxt.html.

Subject: [Paraview] Map scalars, User question
Message-ID: <0bc08bc54d554e389e65536a760a9090@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I have a user that is trying to do the following:


I am trying to do something very similar to what is shown under "Visualizing the Microstructure" at the following site:

http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/Documentation/DREAM3D/tutorialebsdreconstruction.html

I believe they essentially associate IPFColor_Z with red, green, and blue colors in the XDMF file.  Then, they load the file into Paraview and when they disable the "Map Scalars" option, Paraview just displays the proper RGB color for IPFColor_Z.

Is this possible with exodus instead of XDMF?  So far I have been unsuccessful.




Anyone have any ideas?

I have been able to create a .vtk file, with a UInt8 array.  When I turn off Map Scalars, this variable correctly paints from black to white.  But, if I try to create three UInt8's, for RGB, I can't get it to work.  I even tried creating an array in the calculator.

So, I believe the part that concerns ParaView is as follows - how to I create a dataset that  has 0xRRGGBBAA type data, that Paraview will just display as its color?  For instance, if I have 0xff000000, I want to see red.

Ideas?

Thanks,

Alan

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Map scalars, User question

I have a user that is trying to do the following:


I am trying to do something very similar to what is shown under "Visualizing the Microstructure" at the following site:

http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/Documentation/DREAM3D/tutorialebsdreconstruction.html

I believe they essentially associate IPFColor_Z with red, green, and blue colors in the XDMF file.  Then, they load the file into Paraview and when they disable the "Map Scalars" option, Paraview just displays the proper RGB color for IPFColor_Z.

Is this possible with exodus instead of XDMF?  So far I have been unsuccessful.




Anyone have any ideas?

I have been able to create a .vtk file, with a UInt8 array.  When I turn off Map Scalars, this variable correctly paints from black to white.  But, if I try to create three UInt8's, for RGB, I can't get it to work.  I even tried creating an array in the calculator.

So, I believe the part that concerns ParaView is as follows - how to I create a dataset that  has 0xRRGGBBAA type data, that Paraview will just display as its color?  For instance, if I have 0xff000000, I want to see red.

Ideas?

Thanks,

Alan

Ahh, that may be, I wouldn't have noticed it since I have admin on my 
account.

as far as the version of the standard implemented by MS MPI in HPC Pack 
2012 (internal ver 256), it's 2.0. The TestSystemCaps regression test 
has the code to report.

Good to know. I think we'll make the switch at the same time when we
upgrade the VS compiler we're using for the binaries. We are switching
to using CMakified Python soon and then we wouldn't need to use
VS2008. Any thoughts on which is the most common VS compiler? Qt
distributes binaries for 2010, 2012, 2013. I suppose we can pick 2012
:).

?Casey,


I am trying to get back to this among all the other firedrills.


Yes, I am using Copy Arrays


I also tried a simple filter where I just assigned values and that worked as well.


It seems the area that isn't working is:


   for i in range(block.GetNumberOfElements()):
      sigma = numpy.array([ [xx[i],xy[i],xz[i]],
                            [xy[i],yy[i],yz[i]],
                            [xz[i],yz[i],zz[i]]
                         ])

      # isotropic strain matrix
      iso = 1.0/3.0*numpy.trace(sigma)*numpy.eye(3)
      # deviatoric strain matrix
      dev = sigma - iso

      #principal strains
      eigvals = list(numpy.linalg.eigvalsh(sigma))
      eigvals.sort()
      eigvals.reverse()
      P1[i] = eigvals[0]
      P2[i] = eigvals[1]
      P3[i] = eigvals[2]
      # max shear
      max_shear[i] = (max(eigvals)-min(eigvals))/2.0



I wasn't sure if I had to convert to numpy arrays for this to work so I tried

   xx = vtkDataArrayToVTKArray(block.CellData['USTRTOTXX'])
...

to get numpy arrays to use in sigma, but that doesn't work either.

P1,P2 and P3 are not declared anywhere before they are first used - could that be the problem?
?
Also, how do I get debug prints to show up somewhere - I'm not getting any error messages in the console or the Output Window.

thanks

Hi Dennis,

I took a look at the filter to see what might be wrong, but I seem to be missing a couple of things:

1) Are you using the "Copy Arrays" option of the programmable filter? Otherwise you will need to reference the input data as well.

2) Where are the P1,P2,P3, etc vectors created?  What type are they?

The below script worked for me if Copy Arrays is enabled.  I used the can.ex2 example dataset from paraview and ensured the "Object Ids" cell data was selected in the reader.


for oblock in output:

   oid = oblock.CellData['ObjectId']

   o2 = oid + 10

   oblock.CellData.append(o2, 'newdata')

Hope that helps

makes me wonder if the installer could also install python binaries? ;-)

I'm not sure which compiler you should use, I tend to think the newer 
compiler would potentially generate better code, but I don't know if 
there are other factors that you need to consider when creating binaries.

Haha! Me wonders too .. the problem is if the user installed Python in
some location, then he'd need to setup PATH before paraview could run.

I was thinking along the lines that the ParaView installer, could 
leverage the python official installer behind the scenes, but direct it 
into the ParaView specific location...

P.S.


P1, P2, P3 and max_shear are each just scalar numbers (value of Principal strains) - the P1[] is just a value for each element in the block

Hi Dennis,

I took a look at the filter to see what might be wrong, but I seem to be missing a couple of things:

1) Are you using the "Copy Arrays" option of the programmable filter? Otherwise you will need to reference the input data as well.

2) Where are the P1,P2,P3, etc vectors created?  What type are they?

The below script worked for me if Copy Arrays is enabled.  I used the can.ex2 example dataset from paraview and ensured the "Object Ids" cell data was selected in the reader.


for oblock in output:

   oid = oblock.CellData['ObjectId']

   o2 = oid + 10

   oblock.CellData.append(o2, 'newdata')

Hope that helps

I do not think you should need that when you access the cell data as you
are with block.CellData['XX']

Yes that would be a problem when you try to assign an element to an array.
For example try using the python shell in paraview and executing "P1[0] =
2.0".  You should get an error message.  The list should be created prior
to element assignment like

import numpy
P1 = numpy.zeros(1)
P1[0] = 2.0

I have not seen this problem before so I do not have many suggestions.
Solving this first should help you debug the rest.  Have you tried putting
some print statements in the very first lines of the filter?  Maybe try
this in a new programmable filter in case there is a syntax error in the
code and that is obscuring the printouts?  Can you confirm the output
window you are looking at is the one you find in the Tools section of the
menu?

Hope that helps.

Ah! I wonder if that's doable, but it is, yea -- unless that brings

some food for thought on this subject.
VS run time system for VS2010 and earlier has a bug in it that doesn't allow XML flavored files (vtu, vtp, etc) over 4 GB (or was it 2 GB?) to be read correctly.
it has an fseek error.  I think this was reported a while back when I first stumbled on it.

I've HEARD that this was fixed in VS2012/2013 but have not verified it personally.

Good to know. I think we'll make the switch at the same time when we upgrade the VS compiler we're using for the binaries. We are switching to using CMakified Python soon and then we wouldn't need to use VS2008. Any thoughts on which is the most common VS compiler? Qt distributes binaries for 2010, 2012, 2013. I suppose we can pick 2012 :).

I am not aware of any paraview specific way to do that.  You could try the 
standard python csv module https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html  or use 
numpy savetxt for arrays

The fseek/ftell issue has two potential causes.

1. Somebody is using the fseek / ftell function on windows instead of
_fseeki64 / _ftelli64 which are the only way I am aware of seeking
inside files that are larger than 2GB using the C fread functions.

2. You are using std::fstream with VisualStudio 2010 or less, seekg
contains a bug where internally it casts all offsets to signed long
values, which on windows are at most 32bits. This has been fixed in VS
2012. For more information on this bug is, this SO thread is a good
starting spot: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13837810/seekg-cannot-handle-file-of-4294967295-bytes-properly

The only 64 bit Qt 5.x binaries are for VS2013 if you plan on supporting 64 bit paraview by using the prebuilt Qt Binaries. So my vote would be for the newest/latest compiler if possible.

Again, thank you. I am currently facing with some issues configuring MSVC
2008 Express in order to compile 64-bit applications. I will try to fix it.

Best regards,

If we want the newest/latest compiler we need to make sure everything
in the superbuild will compile there too. It would be great to use the
Qt and Python installers though if that was possible, it would even
reduce the build time for our superbuilds. If we can, why not move to
the latest compiler version available?

Subject: [Paraview] Volume focused application for materials STEM tomography
Message-ID: <CAMkPkZX6dEwzqDYfFsLBn7qYxNbb-1pGyv4MnCFJjhKkPcEwRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have been working on a branded ParaView-based application, called
tomviz. The focus is on STEM tomography at atomic resolutions for
materials, but it is also exploring how to make a focused application
that enables visualization and analysis of volumes.

http://www.tomviz.org/

We are developing out the concept of data processing in Python to
enable researchers to easily develop new data analysis,
reconstruction, and transformation techniques leveraging things like
numpy. It was presented at M&M two weeks ago, and we will be adding
some alignment and reconstruction capabilities in the next release.

Thanks,

Marcus

Thanks guys, I had to put this aside for a week. For the ?constructor being called three times case? there?re some things in the backtraces for the first two that might be it.

The first has a call to vtkSMReaderFactory::GetReaders, also, both have calls to CanReadFile, but not from the plugin, from vtkSMReaderFactory. I should be seeing the plugin?s CanReadFile method, right?

Burlen's got it right. I am curious why the plugin was only called once. Maybe there is no CanReadFile() or no file extension collision of something like that in one case but not the other?

Mark: ProcessRequest() calls RDO(), RI(), and RD() (in that order) only after paraview creates the instance that it will actually use to read the file with. All are typically only called once, unless some parameter on the reader changes. If RD is called more often check to see if image based extents are mismatched.

Subject: Reader ctors called multiple times?

Hello ParaView,

I?ve inherited a project that writes plugins for ParaView 3.14.1, serial. While debugging I found out that the constructor for one of this project?s file readers is called 3 times when loading a file. I thought this was odd, so I tried setting a break point on vtkUnstructuredGridReader?s ctor and discovered that it?s called twice. However, a constructor for vtk source plugin that I wrote is only called once, as I would have guessed for the others.

Is it normal for readers to have their constructors called multiple times when loading a file?

Thanks,
Mark

Apologies if this question was already asked. Has anyone successfully run pvbatch using one of the Kitware provided Paraview Windows binaries?

I am using the Paraview 4.1.0 Kitware compiled binary on a Windows 7 64-bit computer. I would like to debug a script using pvbatch, before uploading it to the supercomputer to post-process. The following syntax seems to kind of work, but the 'mpirun' pop-up window closes before I can see whatever output is shown. Trying to run 'pvbatch' without using 'mpirun' results in a bunch of MPI errors even when the '--no-mpi' flag is specified.

Command Syntax:
'C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.1.0\bin\pvbatch.exe' -np 2 'C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.1.0\bin\pvbatch.exe' .\script.py

Thanks,
Keerti

Dear ParaView people,

I have a vector field V defined on some mesh, and I am trying to 
color-code it following the scheme:
- R = |V.x|
- G = |V.y|
- B = |V.z|
Does that make sense? Is there a way to do so? Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAOkDtC8T=eLsb0Q60BxpS6Z7oNx65YyAv7RwBxnOuQsKNVmANg@mail.gmail.com>

The Color Map has Labels on the left and Annotations on the right  and
they can be edited using the "Edit Color Legend Parameters" popup
menu.  The Labels appear in user specified increments, but I they do
not display the max and min values of the range, leaving ugly white
space at the top and bottom of the color bar. Annotations can display
the max and min, but they are on the right side of the color bar,
making the whole color bar mess twice as wide. How can I get the max
and min label values to be displayed on the same side as the labels
and how can I do it on either side of the color bar?

The title text at the top of the colorbar is always right justified.
This forces the user to move the colorbar very far into the image if
the colorbar is put on the right side.  Is there an option for
justification control of the title text?

I am a novice Paraview user and my question pertains to using Paraview
4.1.0 64 bit on a Mac workstation.

Hi Brady,

I think you will be happy to hear that the features you request are
coming in ParaView 4.2. You can get them now by downloading the
Nightly build of ParaView (selectable in the Version menu). Check out
the new "Add Range Labels" and "Title Justification" options.

Thanks,
Cory

I'ld use the python programmable filter.
In the filter:
copy the input across
make a new three component wide unsigned char array and give it a name
iterate over all the points (or cells)
   get the vector for the point (or cell)
   scale and bias each component down to 0..255 and store in the new array
add the new array to the output point (or cell) array container

Hi all,

I'm new to paraview. I try to run pvserver on a cluster. The problem is
that I need to ssh twice to get access to the cluster. To use pvserver I
submit a job on the cluster and then I run pvserver using the command
"mpirun -np 12 pvserver"
then I pick the name and port from terminal and use it in paraview client.
but paraview can't find the pvserver. Is there any way to establish a
connection via these two ssh tunnels?

Thanks in advance,

Why is the writer proxy searched in the filters group? It should be in the writers group right?

Thanks for your help!

Hi,

I will look at this a bit more but I'm wondering if you tried doing the
same with just a full ParaView build and if you did, how did it work?

Regards,
Andy

Andy,

I'll let you look into it, but I suspect it's due to the fact that
catalyst needs to "tell" exactly where the py (and other ParaView
shared libraries) are since the usual mechanism of determine their
locations based on the location of the executable don't apply to
Catalyst.

It does boil down to using reverse connection and setting up recursive
tunnels so that the pvserver and tunnel back to the client. See the
following on the need for portfwd and how it could potentially be
helpful here.

Hi Ehsan,

As Utkarsh says you need to use a reverse connection. I suggest ncat 
<http://nmap.org/ncat/> instead of portfwd because portfwd is a long 
dead project with no support and it's failed to compile on some systems 
I used. Here's a schematic of the setup

[work station]              [  login node    ]      [ compute node ]
[  paraview  ]<-- ssh -R --<[ ncat+ncat-l]<-----[ pvserver -rc ]

in more detail:
in your pvsc on the client
ssh -R ${PORT}:localhost:${PORT} ${LOGIN_HOST} ...

on the login node in a shell script referenced by the client's pvsc:
let LOGIN_PORT=${PORT}+1
ncat -l ${LOGIN_HOST} ${LOGIN_PORT} --sh-exec="ncat localhost $PORT" &
qsub ...

on the compute nodein your batch script
mpirun ... pvserver --reverse-connection --client-host ${LOGIN_HOST} 
--server-port ${LOGIN_PORT} ...

You could skip ncat if you have control over the sshd config, you need 
to enable GatewayPorts.

Subject: [Paraview] Error on server disconnect
Message-ID: <201408181658.s7IGwnVJ013827@msw2.awe.co.uk>

Good afternoon all,

I have built ParaView 4.1.0 using Superbuild. During testing I noticed that if the Server Connection is highlighted in the Pipeline Browser when I click Disconnect, I see four error messages in the Output Messages window like that shown below:

ERROR: In <path>/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkPVSessionCore.cxx, line 832
vtkPVSessionCore (0x666320): No object with global-id: 33157


I do not see these error messages if the server is not highlighted in the Pipeline browser during disconnection.

I am building on Linux using gcc 4.5.2 and mpich2 1.2.1.  I am launching the server on localhost using:
mpirun -n 8 -envall <path-to-pvserver>/pvserver --server-port=11111 --use-offscreen-rendering

I have tested this in 4.0.1 and error messages are not displayed.

Is this a problem with my build? Has anyone else seen this issue? Is this a bug in ParaView?


Kind regards,
Jim

Hi Andy,

thanks for looking into it.

I further noticed that the same error occurs when I use the official Extras-edition (plus Enable-Python). When using the Rendering-Base-Python edition everything works.

Best,
Lars

Thanks Jim - I wrote it up.  It is bug 14950.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Error on server disconnect

Good afternoon all,

I have built ParaView 4.1.0 using Superbuild. During testing I noticed that if the Server Connection is highlighted in the Pipeline Browser when I click Disconnect, I see four error messages in the Output Messages window like that shown below:

ERROR: In <path>/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkPVSessionCore.cxx, line 832
vtkPVSessionCore (0x666320): No object with global-id: 33157


I do not see these error messages if the server is not highlighted in the Pipeline browser during disconnection.

I am building on Linux using gcc 4.5.2 and mpich2 1.2.1.  I am launching the server on localhost using:
mpirun -n 8 -envall <path-to-pvserver>/pvserver --server-port=11111 --use-offscreen-rendering

I have tested this in 4.0.1 and error messages are not displayed.

Is this a problem with my build? Has anyone else seen this issue? Is this a bug in ParaView?


Kind regards,
Jim

Hi Lars,

When you run pvpython can you create the XMLPPolyDataWriter ?

To test this just do:
from paraview.simple import *
w = XMLPPolyDataWriter()

The safest way to test this stuff is to try it with a "normal" ParaView
build with MPI and Python enabled. If you can link and run against this
then it has to do with your edition which you can then check on issues by
using pvpython. We don't do a lot of testing on the generated Catalyst
editions yet so it's possible that something snuck in to them.

Also, what version of ParaView are you using?

Andy

Dear Ehsan,

I use a similar setup as Burlen, tunneling twice over a login node to
our cluster's head node.

It also needs `GatewayPorts clientspecified` in the head node's
sshd_config to work with maximum comfort.
Feel free to check our wiki:

https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/wiki/ParaView

Best,
Axel

Very cool! Thanks for sharing, Axel. It will be nice to link this page
from the Wiki as a reference/example, if that's okay.

Hi Andy,

I can create XMLPPolyDataWriter in pvpython without errors. With a normal ParaView build as well as with the Rendering-Base-Python edition it works but I wanted to have a small custom edition.

I am using the next branch from yesterday (79f7fdc).

Best,
Lars

If you can link and run against this then it has to do with your edition which you can then check on issues by using pvpython. We don't do a lot of testing on the generated Catalyst editions yet so it's possible that something snuck in to them.

I just wont to give a feedback about this problem and how I solved it: I've 
donwloaded and installed  more recent versions:
Mesa-10.2.2 (MesaLib-10.2.2.tar.gz) and ParaView-v4.1.0 
(ParaView-v4.1.0-source.tar.gz)

It has requested an update of llvm on my server:
llvm-devel-3.4-10.el6.x86_64
llvm-libs-3.4-10.el6.x86_64.rpm
llvm-3.4-10.el6.x86_64.rpm

I've build Mesa-10.2.2 with:
./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31" CFLAGS="-O3 -g 
-DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31" --disable-xvmc --disable-glx --disable-dri 
--with-dri-drivers="" --with-gallium-drivers="swrast" --enable-texture-float 
--disable-shared-glapi --disable-egl --with-egl-platforms="" 
--enable-gallium-osmesa --enable-gallium-llvm=yes 
--prefix=/share/apps/osmesa-10-2-2-GCC48
gmake
su
make install

I've build a recent ffmpeg:
tar xvfz ffmpeg-2.3.tar.gz
cd ffmpeg-2.3
./configure --prefix=/share/apps/ffmpeg-2.3-GCC48 --enable-nonfree 
--enable-shared --disable-avx --disable-yasm
make
su
make install

Then I've build ParaView-v4.1.0 with
tar xvfz ParaView-v4.1.0-source.tar.gz
cd ParaView-v4.1.0
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake28 -Wno-dev -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/share/apps/qt4.8.8/bin/qmake \

  -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=-ldl \
  -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-ldl \
  ..
make
su
make install

System is Rocks Cluster 6.1 (Emerald Boa).

Thanks all for your answers on this very strange problem, may be more mesa 
related than Paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] vector in netcdf files
Message-ID: <53F36437.20207@uibk.ac.at>

Hi guys,

it's probably a simple question, but I can't find any information on the 
web (or I don't know where to look for). How do I write (time-dependent) 
data in netcdf-4 such that paraview recognizes it as a vector field. I 
tried to write it in a single 5-dimensional dataset and also tried to 
write the components seperately but I think I am missing the proper 
attribute names or something. With the 5D array paraview tells me that 
there are too many dimensions and I don't know how to tell paraview that 
three scalar datasets are the components of a vector field.
Can you help me?
Best
Matthias

Hi Lars,

When you tried pvpython and creating an XMLPPolyDataWriter, did you do that
with the pvpython that was built with your custom edition? That's what I
meant before even though I didn't state the explicitly.

Is there a reason you're using the next branch for this? In general you
should use the master branch since it is more stable.

Another question, are you linking your code to a developer installed
location of Catalyst or the build location of Catalyst? If you're using the
developer installed location you should try and see if you can use the
build location to see if it works there.

For a full ParaView build and install with developer information I was able
to successfully run a Catalyst example that was linked to the installed
location but maybe there's something missing with the Catalyst editions
that don't install everything as needed.

Regards,
Andy

Hi Andy,

thanks for your efforts!

> When you tried pvpython and creating an XMLPPolyDataWriter, did you do that with the pvpython that was built with your custom edition?

Yes.

I also tried the master branch before.

> Another question, are you linking your code to a developer installed location of Catalyst or the build location of Catalyst? If you're using the developer installed location you should try and see if you can use the build location to see if it works there.

I just used the build location.

> For a full ParaView build and install with developer information I was able to successfully run a Catalyst example that was linked to the installed location but maybe there's something missing with the Catalyst editions that don't install everything as needed.

Yes I know. It is also ok for me do use the full ParaView build. But maybe in the future when I finished the Catalyst stuff it would be nice for other developers to just have to build a small subset of ParaView.

But until then I do not want to waste your time!

Thanks a lot,
Lars

Hi Lars,

Thanks for sticking with this. The Catalyst editions are a bit tricky and
we haven't had enough people testing them out so there's a lot of space for
mistakes so it takes me a bit of effort to try and figure out how to narrow
down where the problem could be. I think I have enough information now to
proceed. I should be able to spend a bit of time on this today.

Thanks,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] vector in netcdf files

Message-ID: <D018E1E1.1AC1E%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Matthias,

There are several netCDF readers. I think the one most relevant to you is
the one that reads the CF convention, which is the most general. This is
listed as "NetCDF files generic and CF conventions".

Unfortunately, it looks like the CF convention does not specify a
mechanism for defining vector fields, so it does not seem directly
supported by the reader. Your best bet for now is to define the components
as separate fields and then using the calculator filter to combine them
into a vector.

Message-ID: <5ab1842e7987447488a62af9334678ac@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Is there a way to get bounding box information via Python? I'd like to determine the min/max extents of different parts via a script.

Thanks,

Alan

One thing to be aware of is the additional overhead of ssh compared to 
something like ncat or portfwd. ssh encrypts/unencrypts it's data which 
adds unnecessary overhead. I ran the 2 ssh tunnel solution at nersc for 
a while on Hopper. The performance was noticeably better with ncat which 
pipes data through untouched. The issue in large part because of the 
heavy loading and heavy network traffic on mom nodes where second tunnel 
ran. this is cray thing, you may not notice the difference between ssh 
and ncat on a typical cluster or if the system is not hammered by 1000's 
of simultaneous users as ours are. Still I think ncat is the best practice.

>From a user:

I'm trying to create a Python script which will loop through a set of Exodus block IDs and will output an image for each block. I started the trace and tried to use the "Zoom to Data" button, but this didn't translate well into the python script - instead I got a discrete camera view, which doesn't lend well to a general script. Is there a command I can pass to zoom to whatever data I'd like?

Thanks,

Alan,

With git/master, it translates to something like this:

renderView1.ResetCamera(-10.0, 10.0, -10.0, 10.0, -10.0, 10.0)

Where the values are indeed the current data bounds. But I think we
can add API to "ZoomTOData" in Python using a data source rather that
current bounds. Feel free to add a bug/feature request.

Although Alpha channel based transparent backgrounds will be announced in Kitware's upcoming release notes, I have an example I just used for testing.  Here is what our new save animation and save screenshot can create.

ParaView master.  Edit/ Settings/ General/ Set whether screenshots use an alpha... should be ON.
I then saved two datasets - can and bake.  One version of bake has had colors reversed.
Using gimp, I then added a world map as the background, and added the two datasets on top.

I see in coprocessing.py it does:
                    if view.IsA("vtkSMRenderViewProxy") == True:
                        view.ResetCamera()
                    elif view.IsA("vtkSMContextViewProxy") == True:
                        view.ResetDisplay()

The first is for standard 2D and 3D views and the second one is for plots.
I'm not sure if this is any more helpful than what Utkarsh said.

Thanks!

Sure, you can link it.
Just tell me if you spot some improvements.

Our stand-alone pvsc file does some more automated and rather "dark
magic" to build the described the tunnels up with one click. Its linked
there too.

Message-ID: <CAOsuPn0yca_gZeY1YS+YZ=D46TSD3irz9F1pT1XgaSpEQP1x0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to use the panel_widget option in the servermanager XML with a
String Array, but whenever I try to do it, it doesn't display anything. So,
I'm wondering how it can be done even though it works with a normal
StringVectorProperty for the default widget. Thank you. The XML and
screenshot is given below.

XML:

<StringVectorProperty
       name="CPOList"
       label="CPOList"
       command="SetCPOList"
       number_of_elements="1"
       panel_visibility="default"
       panel_widget="list">
       <StringListDomain name="array_list">
        <RequiredProperties>
        <Property function="ArrayList"
                name="CPOListInfo"/>
        </RequiredProperties>
        </StringListDomain>
        <Documentation>
          This property specifies the CPO on the UAL Database.
        </Documentation>
     </StringVectorProperty>


     <StringVectorProperty
       name="CPOListInfo"
       label="CPOListInfo"
       command="GetCPOList"
       information_only="1">
        <StringArrayHelper />
     </StringVectorProperty>

I am working on an application which writes a VTP file. We recently did a
huge code merge and now our VTP writer is outputting files which cause
Paraview to crash upon load. I am trying to debug this but it's difficult
since Paraview doesn't give an error message, it just crashes. Does
Paraview write errors out to a log?

This is with Paraview 4.1.0 on Windows 64bit.

Cheers,
Bruce

The best way is to rebuild ParaView in debug mode and then use the
debugger, I'm afraid.

Ok, I haven't had much luck building paraview in the past but will give it
another go. I have uploaded the file that is causing problems here
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4Y0idbHnikgUGRHNElIdjF4N0k&authuser=0>,
if anyone could run this through in debug mode and let me know what the
problem is it would be greatly appreciated.

In the mean time I've attached a VS2013 debugger to the process. It
complains of a divide by zero in vtkOXMLParser. We are using the
vtkZLibDataCompressor compressor, so I can't vouch for the binary data
that's being written, but the XML tags are all essentially the same as
another file which is working.

Cheers,
Bruce

The binary data for "Hydrodynamic Force" is invalid. If you remove the
entry, the segfault goes away.

Hi Alan
It?s from a tarball called "ParaView-v4.1.0-source.tar.gz? which I downloaded a while ago.
I?m not sure if I pulled from a repo at the time, but I don?t think so.
Checksum is

rcook at rzgpu52 (paraview-4.1.0 ): sum ParaView-v4.1.0-source.tar.gz
47281 49278

Hi Alan
It?s from a tarball called "ParaView-v4.1.0-source.tar.gz? which I downloaded a while ago.
I?m not sure if I pulled from a repo at the time, but I don?t think so.
Checksum is

I don?t know.  It is too hard a question to answer as I do not have a snapshot from a time when it built to compare against.
I hope that I can simply answer, ?Why doesn?t this build work as is, given the error I?m seeing??

So, what changed on the system-side?  New GL development libraries, or maybe they were accidentally removed, or something like that?    It's probably not you, your source code or your build script .....

Hi Alan
It?s from a tarball called "ParaView-v4.1.0-source.tar.gz? which I downloaded a while ago.
I?m not sure if I pulled from a repo at the time, but I don?t think so.
Checksum is

rcook at rzgpu52 (paraview-4.1.0 ): sum ParaView-v4.1.0-source.tar.gz
47281 49278

Hello,
I?m seeing this new error on our machines, which is mysterious as I have not changed my build process at all.  Can someone help me spot the source of my woes here?  Thanks!

Rich,

The problem seems to be in
ParaView/VTK/ThirdParty/gl2ps/vtkgl2ps/CMakeLists.txt. To make it
easier, can you post all the files/directories under the following
directory in the build directory? That will have generated makefiles
will help determine the includes, libraries it's linking against.

ParaViewBuild/VTK/ThirdParty/gl2ps/

An "ls" in this directory should look something like this "CMakeFiles
cmake_install.cmake  CTestTestfile.cmake  Makefile  vtkgl2ps
vtk_gl2ps.h"

Thanks, yup, that's what I was looking for indeed.

I was suspecting that vtkgl2ps is not linking against libOSMesa due to
some bug in the CMakeLists.txt. What I confirmed that the vtkgl2ps
library is indeed linking against libOSMesa.so. Now the glGetFloatv
etc. should have indeed been defined in libOSMesa.

Which version of Mesa is this? Mind attaching/sharing the
libOSMesa.so? Let's see if that reveals anything.

Try modeling this on "Point/Cell" array selection properties provided
by readers (in readers.xml). You'd need to use the
ArraySelectionDomain, the StringListDomain won't work.

e.g.
      <StringVectorProperty command="SetPointArrayStatus"
                            element_types="2 0"
                            information_property="PointArrayInfo"
                            label="Point Arrays"
                            name="PointArrayStatus"
                            number_of_elements="0"
                            number_of_elements_per_command="2"
                            repeat_command="1">
        <ArraySelectionDomain name="array_list">
          <RequiredProperties>
            <Property function="ArrayList"
                      name="PointArrayInfo" />
          </RequiredProperties>
        </ArraySelectionDomain>
        <Documentation>This property lists which point-centered arrays to
        read.</Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Dear Utkarsh,

Thank you for the email. I tried modelling it along the example mentioned.
This is the code that I have written but it segfaults for no reason that is
apparent to me.

C++ Code:

ReadUALGrid::ReadUALGrid()
{
  //this->FileName = NULL;
  this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(0);
  this->SetNumberOfOutputPorts(1);
  this->trial=vtkSmartPointer<vtkDataArraySelection>::New();
  this->trial->AddArray("hello");
  this->trial->AddArray("world");
  this->trial->EnableAllArrays();
}


}

vtkDataArraySelection * ReadUALGrid::GetCPOListSelection(){

return this->trial.GetPointer();
}


int ReadUALGrid::GetCPOListArrayStatus(char *name){

return this->trial->GetArraySetting(name);
}

void ReadUALGrid::SetCPOListArrayStatus(const char * name, int status){

        if (status){
                this->trial->EnableArray(name);
        }
        else{
                this->trial->DisableArray(name);
        }


}


int ReadUALGrid::GetNumberOfCPOListArrays(){


return this->trial->GetNumberOfArrays();
}


const char * ReadUALGrid::GetCPOListArrayName(int index){

return this->trial->GetArrayName(index);

}


XML:

<StringVectorProperty
       name="CPOList"
       label="CPOList"
       command="SetCPOListArrayStatus"
       number_of_elements="0"
       number_of_elements_per_command="2"
       element_types="2 0"
       information_property="CPOListArrayStatus"
       panel_visibility="default">
       <ArraySelectionDomain name="array_list">
        <RequiredProperties>
        <Property function="ArrayList"
                name="CPOListArrayStatus"/>
        </RequiredProperties>
        </ArraySelectionDomain>
        <Documentation>
          This property specifies the CPO on the UAL Database.
        </Documentation>
     </StringVectorProperty>


     <StringVectorProperty
       name="CPOListArrayStatus"
       information_only="1">
        <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="CPOList"/>
     </StringVectorProperty>


Any idea where I am making the mistake? Can I initialize a
DataArraySelection that way? Thanks.

Regards,
Girish

I'd suggest looking at in the debugger and the tracking the segfault
down. Not sure where it could be going wrong.

This is the error that is printed out. I dunno what the problem is. I think

Hi Lars,

I was testing this out a bit more and am getting confused again. Can you
send me a copy of your custom edition with everything in it as well as the
command you used to create the Catalyst source?

Thanks,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Dropping Snow Leopard OsX binaries for ParaView
Message-ID: <CADHSJjBhMYcyDuTOpHXy3GUyBs2SNJeE2uoeka=UspQ1DKOsBw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I wanted to get a quick survey if anyone cares if we drop support for
distributing ParaVIew binaries compatible with Snow Leopard. Lion on
wards will still be supported.

There are two OsX binaries for ParaView currently and it can be a
little confusing which one to use and why and hence this change.

Subject: [Paraview] Camera - Interpolate Camera Locations
Message-ID: <CAE=GJrZdKa18wbrkoVuwFDo-WYr0mf6FhHrretc-R9T5g-Nurg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In the animation view, i have added a camera with the Interpolate Camera
Locations mode.

My goal is to create an animation that goes along the X axis but stops at
some points

It has 30 seconds

I have marked the following times {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30}

0 to 5 increasing the position in the X axis

5 to 10 stopped

10 to 15 increasing the position in the X axis

15 to 20 stopped

20 to 25 increasing the position in the X axis

25 to 30 stopped

I tried to stop the camera by putting the same camera values in:

"Position"
"Focal Point"
"View Angle"
"View Up"
"Parallel Scale"

but the camera is not steady, the camera performs a little movement around
the point

How can i stop the camera completely?

Att,
Leonardo Pessanha

When opening a vtk file, resulting from a simulation in 1D and 2D meshes
but in a 3D space (x, y and z coordinates are/can be different from 0).
Paraview doesn't show anything. Only when volumes are defined in the mesh,
results are shown (but these aren't very significant).

The mesh I'm using consists of two parallel surfaces, connected with 1D
lines (2.5 dimensional mesh).

Kind regards,
Nils

Utkarsh - unfortunately, we still have a number of Macs that are still
running 10.6 and are using ParaView.  We'd like to use the pre-built
binaries for the next ParaView release on these machines if possible.  We
currently don't build from source for the Macs, so that could be a real
challenge for us if we needed to start doing that .....    We're pushing
hard to get these 10.6 systems either replaced or upgraded in the near
future, but not soon enough.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Folks,

I wanted to get a quick survey if anyone cares if we drop support for
distributing ParaVIew binaries compatible with Snow Leopard. Lion on
wards will still be supported.

There are two OsX binaries for ParaView currently and it can be a
little confusing which one to use and why and hence this change.

Sounds good, Rick. I'll shelve this proposal for now. We can revisit for 4.3.

I'll look into renaming the OsX binaries to minimize confusion.

Hello,

I am able to load spatially distributed Exodus file ok with ParaView.
However, when I load a temporally distributed Exodus file, I am missing all
the time step. What would be a proper way to load temporally distributed
Exodus file? I just picked the grouping that ParaView has when loading the
files.

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks

Message-ID: <06634bcb906c4de2bf627b49a56ca25e@BN1PR01MB133.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi all,

I have a question regarding the usage of the octree.  Is it possible to create an octree structure for an array  (e.g., an array from a NetCDF file)? >From the Source, I can select octree which creates a "template" octree structure.  I'd like to use the octree structure to reorganize the 3D NetCDF data to make the rendering more efficient. If using octree is not possible, how about using AMR?


Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel volume rendering for multiresolution data
Message-ID: <1408877914655.82993@masonlive.gmu.edu>

Dear all,
I am wondering if Paraview supports parallel volume rendering for multi-resolution data (e.g., AMR, Multiblock).

Here is what I have found so far:
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/index.php/Multi-Resolution_Rendering_with_Overlapping_AMR

"When running in parallel, currently volume rendering for AMR is only supported when client-side rendering is forced i.e. we haven't added support for distributed volume rendering of AMR datasets yet. "

If I want to perform parallel volume rendering for multiresolution data, what is the best solution then?

Thanks,
Jing

Message-ID: <CA+aqC_dS7k+C-15imFdGj6N6cSB=t8ezOLWyPBORfuXz_kAtug@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy,

I am using paraview 4.1.0 64bit on Ubuntu and when I play with the opacity
of overlaid objects I found the behavior is interesting.

Basically I would like to see the sphere through several overlaid planes
(along the normal direction of the planes) , as shown below. I first uses 4
planes.

[image: Inline image 1]

When the sphere has an opacity of 1.0, the effect looks correct, as shown
below

[image: Inline image 2]

But if I lower the sphere opacity for a tiny bit ( like opacity = 0.999 ),
the sphere is not visible at all, as shown below

[image: Inline image 3]

More strangely, when I use 3 planes instead of 4. The behavior looks
normal. I mean when I adjust the sphere opacity I can always see the sphere
unless the opacity is too low.

[image: Inline image 4]

Anyone has similar experience and happens to know why? Thanks!

Yi,


I can explain exactly why this is happening.


ParaView uses a technique called depth peeling to render transparent surfaces. The basic idea is to render multiple times, peeling away the top layer every time. The more peels you do, the more time it takes to render, so ParaView has a limit to the number of peels it will do for a render.


By default, the number of peels is set to 4. That number is somewhat arbitrary but usually works OK. What is happening to you is that because you have 4 planes, you are using all of your peels on those planes. When the sphere is completely opaque, it does not participate in depth peeling and is always rendered. When you add even a little bit of transparency, it becomes part of the depth peeling, and then gets dumped after the 4 planes. When you reduce the number of planes to 3, the depth peeling makes it all the way to the sphere.


You can control the depth of the depth peeling by going to ParaView settings under Rendering -> General. You will see an option named Number of Peels that is set to 4. Increase it to 5 to see the sphere. Increase it to 6 to see the back of the sphere.

Hi Ken,

Thanks a lot for your fascinating answer. In my application of visualizing
multi-floor buildings a higher peel number is necessary. However, I found I
can enable or disable Depth Peeling but not to adjust the Number ( tried
both Ubuntu and Windows )

Should I use the nightly build instead of 4.10? It seems that it is
adjustable on Mac since I found the following figure on wiki,

I just tried the nightly build and now the number of peeling is adjustable.
However, the rendering is not impacted at all. I guess there is a bug that
the number typed here is not actually used in the code.

I verified that it does indeed work with the nightly version. Did you hit
"Apply"/"Ok" on the dialog? Open Python shell and type the following:

>>> v = GetActiveView()
>>> print v.DepthPeeling
>>> print v.MaximumNumberOfPeels

What does that say?

Hi Utkarsh,

It seems that I didn't delete the original Paraview directory before unzip
the nightly build. I redid it and now everything works like a charm. The
print commands return 1 and the No. of peelings I set.

Thank you again!

Yi

Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD214509916BFB287@MBX210.d.ethz.ch>

Dear Catalyst people

I dragged out an old simulation demo I created some time ago and got it working with paraview/catalyst from git master branch - my plan was to test a live visualization of the simulation with the paraview GUI connected to the simulation. I had thought this capability was now possible, but I have not been following development closely and it looks like I was mistaken.

Is it possible to visualize the simulation live - rather than just generate images (which works fine). (I had a quick skim through the user manual, but didn't see this feature mentioned).

Thanks

JB

Hi John,

This live capability is now available and recently has been cleaned up
quite a bit. There are still a couple more small changes that are waiting a
code review process before they go into the master branch. The user's guide
needs an update for a bunch of new information (live, catalyst editions,
zero-copy arrays) that's important for Catalyst. We're also doing some
preliminary testing with a newly developed ADIOS writer for better IO
performance as well.

Getting back to the live viz stuff, when you create a Catalyst Python
script and export it using the wizard you'll have the option to enable live
viz (it's the same wizard page as the screenshot output specification).
Then, while your simulation is running use the Catalyst->Connect option to
connect. There are two tests (pv.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint and
pvcs.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint) that demonstrate the newly implemented live
functionality which now includes the option to set a breakpoint in the
simulation.

If you get a chance to try it out, let me know what you think.

Andy

Thanks for the info, great news that the live stuff is ongoing. My current test uses cxx only, so I didn?t play with the python pipelines and hadn?t noticed the live viz option. I will experiment and get back to you.

I saw a bunch of questions recently about doing GPU based stuff inside catalyst and it is my aim to get my cuda/piston based renderers working in-situ. I?ll let you know how I get on.
If there are commits on branches you think I might want to test, please say.

thanks again

JB

Hi John,

This live capability is now available and recently has been cleaned up quite a bit. There are still a couple more small changes that are waiting a code review process before they go into the master branch. The user's guide needs an update for a bunch of new information (live, catalyst editions, zero-copy arrays) that's important for Catalyst. We're also doing some preliminary testing with a newly developed ADIOS writer for better IO performance as well.
Getting back to the live viz stuff, when you create a Catalyst Python script and export it using the wizard you'll have the option to enable live viz (it's the same wizard page as the screenshot output specification). Then, while your simulation is running use the Catalyst->Connect option to connect. There are two tests (pv.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint and pvcs.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint) that demonstrate the newly implemented live functionality which now includes the option to set a breakpoint in the simulation.
If you get a chance to try it out, let me know what you think.

Andy

Dear Catalyst people

I dragged out an old simulation demo I created some time ago and got it working with paraview/catalyst from git master branch - my plan was to test a live visualization of the simulation with the paraview GUI connected to the simulation. I had thought this capability was now possible, but I have not been following development closely and it looks like I was mistaken.

Is it possible to visualize the simulation live - rather than just generate images (which works fine). (I had a quick skim through the user manual, but didn?t see this feature mentioned).

Thanks

JB

Hi,

I am writing my own plugin but each time I try to add another check box,
the plugin suddenly segfaults. I have no idea why. The XML and C++ code are
attached.

XML:

<IntVectorProperty
         name="FieldLoadStatus"
         command="SetFieldLoadStatus"
         number_of_elements="1"
         default_values="0"
         panel_visibility="default" >
        <BooleanDomain name="bool"/>
        <Documentation>
          The values of this property sets the run number.
        </Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>
C++:

public:
  vtkTypeMacro(ReadUALGrid, vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm);
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

  static ReadUALGrid *New();

  vtkGetMacro(Shot,int)
  vtkSetMacro(Shot,int);

  vtkGetMacro(Run,int);
  vtkSetMacro(Run,int);

  vtkGetMacro(RefRun,int);
  vtkSetMacro(RefRun,int);

  vtkGetMacro(CPOLoad,int);
  vtkSetMacro(CPOLoad,int);

  vtkGetMacro(FieldLoadStatus,int);
  vtkSetMacro(FieldLoadStatus,int);

protected:
  ReadUALGrid();
  ~ReadUALGrid(){}

  int Shot;
  int Run;
  int RefRun;
  int CPOLoad;
  int FieldLoadStatus;

I have no idea why because it worked perfectly for other check boxes. Thank
you.

Regards,
Girish

Girish,

Can you run ParaView with your plugin through a debugger to find out
where it is segfaulting? That will point out where the segfault occurs
which is often a clue to why it is occurring.

Thanks,
Cory

Ah! No, alas. Mind adding a feature request to the bug tracker (

Hi Jing,

So that I understand, does your NetCDF file already contain some sort of
hierarchy or are you after adaptively rendering it by creating the
hierarchy on the fly?

Best,

My guess is that you have a member variable in RealUALGrid called
"User" that is a char *, but you aren't initializing it to NULL in the
constructor. When RealUALGrid::SetUser() is called, it checks whether
the parameter string passed in is the same as the "User" member
variable. Since "User" is initialized to an invalid pointer, you get
the segmentation fault

Hi Berk,
Thanks for your reply. The original Netcdf file is a regular spaced 3D dataset with a lot of filled values.  I plan to reorganize the data with AMR or some other more efficient structures for rendering. I am developing Python functions to resample Netcdf files but I am not sure if this is the right direction.

Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

From the Source, I can select octree which creates a "template" octree structure.  I'd like to use the octree structure to reorganize the 3D NetCDF data to make the rendering more efficient. If using octree is not possible, how about using AMR?

Hi, 

I wanted to add a contour surface, to a contour isosurface, that is linked to my grid.  So it is say, an iso-surface of Pressure  = 0 but it is contour colored by hight in y.  How would i go about doing that. 

thanks,

Ryan,

I'm not sure I understand what you want, but it sounds like you want to
check the box next to "Compute Scalars." If this option is on, the output
of contour will contain all of the scalar fields. From there you can color
by another field or apply a second contour to the surface to get curves.

Hi Ken,

Those are for visualizing data at locations used internally by FE 
solvers. The menu category was added a while back (3.98?) when I fixed a 
couple of bugs reported here on the user list. The filters themselves 
have been around for a while.

Qt 5 isn't officially supported yet. We've started making the changes
and currently have dashboards that build against Qt 5.0/5.2.

You need to call either RenderView1.StillRender() or
RenderView1.Update() to ensure that the view updates all pipelines
shown in it after changing the AnimationTime.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView using Homebrew for OsX
Message-ID: <CADHSJjCquB_cyzPdB+yseXAM3_7oCNF_TzJHA6xZMhu41RECuw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

As an experiment, homebrew build script for ParaView available at

https://github.com/utkarshayachit/paraview-homebrew

Haven't really tested it throughly or added options like building the
SDK (which I think will be very useful) etc.

Figured I'd put it out there, have people test it and then update it
as needed before contributing it to homebrew-science.

Yup. That build looks like it is being updated now. I haven't checked the
other ParaView binary, though.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter works on Slice but not on original
	data set
Message-ID: <CAFtK+evP3VNCanQu8yhT0pLHJi-JpEdDzx5jGBuJX6xhO6sn0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


  My original dataset is an xdmf file that points to some hdf5 files. I
have this piece of code in a programmable filter. It seems to work on a
Slice of the original dataset, but won't work on the dataset as a whole.
The original dataset is cell centered and I then pass it through a
"CellDataToPointData" filter. Could anyone tell me why? I'm running
Paraview 4.1 - 64 bit on a server-client mode with the server using 16
cores. I thought it might be related to the dataset being multiblock or
something (I don't understand this very well). So I tried the piece of code
here

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter#Dealing_with_Composite_Datasets

This also works on the slice.. but not on the whole dataset.


#Programmable filter code below

That is  indeed a thing that's lost currently. I'm planning to add it
back for 4.2.

Message-ID: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD82254AF7F7@umechp9h.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

while compiling the latest ParaView for git (4.1.0-1560-gf37ec5f) - not superbuild, I am not able to make it through all the way if I don't disable ParaView web using  -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB:BOOL=OFF on my cmake line.

Is qt version (I am using qt version 4.8.5) an issue here? If so, what is the qt version that I should be using?  or this is just a temporary state that will eventually go away in the next PV release?

If I turn off ParaView web, what feature will not be available? Will catalyst be affected? I saw a demo once of catalyst via ParaView web.

thanks
-simon

Simon,

What errors are you getting? It is definitely a temporary issue and
will be fixed, however we're not seeing it on the dashboards so would
help to see the errors. Qt version is certainly not the issue. 4.8.5
is indeed supported Disabling Web will not affect catalyst. The
ParaViewWeb+Catalyst demo also is a little independent since the
catalyst part in that case doesn't really need the web components.

I was getting similar errors on a Cray machine. It seemed to be Python
related, if I remember correctly. When I turned off building ParaView Web
it went away. For me it was building without the Qt GUI. My CMake settings
for the build were:

Can you elaborate on what the errors were? We should fix those.

Just out of curiosity, do you try to build ParaView with Python 2.6?

If that's the case, that could make sense as ParaViewWeb require Python 2.7
but I've only saw that error at run time.

Seeing the error could certainly help.

Sorry to have call qt out... I also think it is Python.. I have Python 2.6.6 on my desktop and
Python 2.6.9 on the new crays (lightning) at afrl that I am running the build.

If Python 2.7 is a must, is there a work around? I doubt that they will update python on the crays just because I asked.... :)

but garnet also has Python 2.6.9 and Andy was able to build ok? Andy?

Are you targeting ParaViewWeb server on your Cray? If not, you can safely
disable it.

Otherwise, you may need to build your own Python along ParaView like we do
in our ParaView binaries.

Hi Seb,

Nope. I think we are good to disable ParaViewWeb from the compile for now.

By "building your own Python", do you mean doing the superbuild? I think I am 
doing the superbuild on lightning. I will try again 
with -DUSE_SYSTEM_python=OFF


Thanks

Are you targeting ParaViewWeb server on your Cray? If not, you can safely 
disable it.

Otherwise, you may need to build your own Python along ParaView like we do in 
our ParaView binaries.

	Just out of curiosity, do you try to build ParaView with Python 2.6?

	If that's the case, that could make sense as ParaViewWeb require Python 2.7 
but I've only saw that error at run time.

	Seeing the error could certainly help.

Hi Simon,

You are correct that's what I meant. However, I was wondering if you are
doing a static build of ParaView.
We are investigating that issue and see how we can smooth (automate) that
process.

Thanks,

Seb

FYI: the error I get is for the configuration I emailed with previously was:
[ 99%] Compiling Python package 'web'
Listing /work/acbauer/MainPVDir/build/lib/site-packages/vtk/web ...
Compiling
/work/acbauer/MainPVDir/build/lib/site-packages/vtk/web/testing.py ...

47, 'TestModuleBrowsers = type("Enum", (), {k: i for i, k in

This is for Python v2.6.8 which is the system version on Copper. I was able
to get it to build properly for a similar system (Garnet) with Python
v2.6.9, if that helps out.

Subject: [Paraview] Triangular prismatic cells not supported ?
Message-ID: <CALBJ7LL353ZML8f73kN_OrCz8ibZYjqjVqz+TPKw5B_RY_9NGg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview user's,

I work with an unstructured mesh, composed of tetrahedron, and prisms in
the vicinity of the walls.
I would like to compute the gradient of different quantities.

This doesn't work, and it seems to me that this is due to the triangular
prismatic cells.

Do triangular prismatic cells are supported in Paraview / VTK ?

Regards,

Aur?lien

Hi Seb,

Setting -DUSE_SYSTEM_python=OFF appears to be working now (60% done) since I 
got past the compile error I was having.

I am not doing a static build. Yes Andy kept me in the loop for the static 
build and Rick is running point on that.

Thanks
-simon

Hi Simon,

You are correct that's what I meant. However, I was wondering if you are doing 
a static build of ParaView.
We are investigating that issue and see how we can smooth (automate) that 
process.

Thanks,

Seb

	Hi Seb,

	Nope. I think we are good to disable ParaViewWeb from the compile for now.

	By "building your own Python", do you mean doing the superbuild? I think I am
	doing the superbuild on lightning. I will try again
	with -DUSE_SYSTEM_python=OFF


	Thanks

	Are you targeting ParaViewWeb server on your Cray? If not, you can safely
	disable it.

	Otherwise, you may need to build your own Python along ParaView like we do in
	our ParaView binaries.

	        Just out of curiosity, do you try to build ParaView with Python 2.6?

	        If that's the case, that could make sense as ParaViewWeb require 
Python 2.7
	but I've only saw that error at run time.

	        Seeing the error could certainly help.

Hello,

  I figured out that the input data set is of type vtkImage while the Slice
is type Polygonal. Hence my script seems to work on the Polygonal data set.
This is how you get add a vector array to a Cell based vtkImage dataset.

import numpy as np

from paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter import numpyTovtkDataArray


output = self.GetImageDataOutput()

u = inputs[0].CellData["U"]

d = inputs[0].GetDimensions()

dz = 2048/256.0

uPrime = np.empty([d[2],d[1],d[0],3])

print d

for i in range(d[0]):

     for j in range(d[1]):

          for k in range(d[2]):

                  uPrime[k,j,i] = np.array([0,0,k*dz + 4.0])


uPrime = uPrime.reshape((d[0]*d[1]*d[2],3))

uPrimeVTK = numpyTovtkDataArray(uPrime)

uPrimeVTK.SetName('uPrime')

output.GetCellData().AddArray(uPrimeVTK)

	ExodusII data set?
Message-ID: <CAJC7CwZNRWZMMuCFEopQJZGViBiyY0wbyJ-VcOQ6Rep17-1QZQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm currently trying to do something simple. I have a ElementVariable q in
my .e file.

I read them into the pipeline with

reader = ExodusIIReader(FileName = 'out.e')

I want to use

histogram = Histogram(q,BinCount=30)

but I recieve the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>NameError: name 'q' is not defined

What is going on here?

Thanks

That's not how you use the Python Histogram function. First of all, it doesn't just assume that the first argument is the name of the input array. Second, input arrays are specified with identifiers contained in strings. The Python interpreter thinks q is the Python variable q, not the field name.

Your script should look something like the following.

reader = ExodusIIReader(Filename='out.e')
histogram = Histogram()
histogram.SelectInputArray = 'q'
histogram.BinCount = 30

Try using the stack trace if you are having trouble determining the right Python functions to call.

The problem is arising because your login on the remote server you're
connected to doesn't have access to the X server. Is there an X server
running on that system? If so, do you have access to it? If so, is
your DISPLAY environment setup to point to the right display?

Maybe try running a xserver of your own is possible using xvfb or
vncserver. Alternatively, you can build ParaView using offscreen Mesa
support (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D).

Hope that helps.

The file included as an attachment consists of 255 points. But none of them
are shown in paraview. The grid consists of surfaces (2D) and lines (1D) in
a 3D space.

Nils,

Your problems have nothing to do with the dimensionality of your data. Rather, the problem is that your file does not define any cells, only points. The render view in ParaView shows the cells, which are defined on points, not the points themselves.

To solve your problem, either add cells to your data or use the Glyph filter to create vertex cells. Change the Glyph Type to "2D Glyph", and then the glyph type of the 2D glyph as "Vertex".

-Ken

You have too many values for "current" array. Only 104 values are
expected. Everything starting with line number 386 in  the line is
extra. The reader reads that like and gets a "0" as the "tag" and
hence it gives that error. Attached is the modified version that loads
without the error.

Subject: [Paraview] Potential bug in vtkPolygon normal and area calculations
Message-ID: <CAHJ1_ROUZnjMyuKa_U4s8QwTAF=dJh5DXKcgDL+E4d3AqPSF8g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

This is driving me round the bend. When I have a meshing coming from a
rectilinear source, I get NANs from my normal and face area calculations.
 When all other input meshes are used, i.e. unstructured, the results are
correct. To test this I've written the following test code which makes a
single cell mesh and produces the NANs.  I then demonstrate that by using
the transform classes, with zero rotation, I can then extract the same mesh
back as a structured grid, and the errors disappear.  I can also apply a
non-zero rotation and the errors disappear too.

Note I apply a rotation, zero or otherwise, because my hypothesis having
stepped through 6.1 in the debugger, is that the vtk_pixel cell type (axis
aligned) coming from the rectilinear grid does not play well with the
normal calculation.  But I can't find the bug, only that all entries of the
normal are zero and the rest of the function fails.

Clearly, and more likely, is that I could also not be using the classes
correctly, and if so please let me know??  Hope somebody can find the bug,
I've got nowhere on this after a day of looking.  Again, anything non-axis
aligned and or non vtk_pixel would appear to work as expected.

Help appreciated,

Cheers again,
Andy

Hi all,

I often do something similar when reading data originally from a text
table.  In this case I need to turn 3 arrays into a single 3-component
uchar array for the purpose of RGB coloring.  I found that I can also use
the following python calculator expression to accomplish this goal
(assuming the arrays are named 'R', 'G', 'B' respectively).  This assumes
the values are already scaled between 0-255.

hstack([inputs[0].PointData['R'], inputs[0].PointData['G'],
inputs[0].PointData['B']]).astype(uint8)

FYI: With PV 4.2 you'll need to use make_vector() instead of hstack.

Hi,

I like to change the font of a label in legend in paraview.
I found this nice article for customizing the legend:

http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/578

It does give information about how numbers in legend are formatted.
However, it does not give instruction how to font size for the labels in
legend.

Thanks
