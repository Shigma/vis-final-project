Thanks for your answer David.
It seems that this is the way to go.

However there is a BIG problem/issue.

When I open the spreadsheet view window and click on the eye (in the
pipeline) all the information comes up:
DISPL / STRESSES / COORDINATES / POINT ID
What I am interested in though are the CELL IDs (so that I can select just a
part of my unstructured hexahedral elements).
As you suggested in the tab "Display", I set "Select Attributes to Show >
CELL Data" but then NOTHING appears on the Spreadsheet!

Note that for the nodes, the procedure works fine.
To your information, I am using the precompiled
paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86.tar.gz<http://paraview.org/files/v3.2/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86.tar.gz>version

Any clues why? Am I doing something wrong or is there a bug in the code? I
have tried different VTK-files so I don't think that it is related to my
file format. However, you can download it at
http://www.dqdev.net/ploti0001.vtk

Thanks in advance,
dqdev

I have a problem with setting a Custom Center of rotation. The boxes are only 
three digits so I cannot enter any small number.

Attached a sample file (single cell with small dimensions). Also if I press 
Close (or the return key) it seems to reset the center.

That usually means that there are no cell centered values to choose
from. In that case I am not sure if the element inspector shows any of
the cells.

Another way to do the same thing is to make a surface cell selection,
then open the selection inspector. In that window you can see the ids
of the cells you've selected, delete them from the selection, and add
new ones manually.

cheers,
Dave

Hello David,

thanks for the helpful answer. That was the problem indeed. The cells didn't
have any values (cause there was no need to). I  added at the end of the
file dummy cell-values, and the method works fine! Now I can see the cell
numbers at the spreadsheet and extract the parts I want.
Even though It seems to be a dirty trick around the problem ;)

Thanks again,
dqdev

Subject: [Paraview] Displaying Hierarchical Structure/Components of objects
 displayed in Paraview
Message-ID: <47A4FBB3.1010709@web.de>

Hello,

I'd like to know if Paraview is capable of displaying detailed, 
hierarchical information about the geometric objects that its displaying.

For example, I've created a sample PVD file containing two VTP files, 
and I wonder if its possible to show the two objects that the PVD file 
contains, and furthermore get listings of polygons, lines and vertexes 
in each VTP file, following the structure of the (XML) file.

Thanks,

- Olumide

Also, occasionally I'd like to turn on/off one of the VTP files (or the 
objects its contains). I know the Paraview supports this for PVSM files 
but I'd like to do this with PVD files, because I'd rather not write a 
PVSM file (they're horrendously complicated :-) ).

PS:
In case I do need to write a PVSM file, I'd like to know if there's a 
minimalist version that contains only specific stuff like while Paraview 
defaults to the unset parameters. For example:

<ParaView>
   <ServerManagerState version="3.0.2">
     <ProxyCollection name="sources">
       <Item id="4456" name="Stuff.vtk"/>
       <Item id="4455" name="More_Stuff.vtk"/>
     </ProxyCollection>
   </ServerManagerState>
</ParaView>

I did not carefully follow this thread but it sounds like you are
trying to create streamlines from a set of vertices. VTK/ParaView do
not support this. You have to create a solid mesh from your set of
points. One good way of doing this is to use the Delaunay3D filter. I
can't remember if this is already available in ParaView. If not let me
know and I can enable it.

Try this:

from paraview import servermanager

connection=servermanager.Connect()

reader=servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader(FileNames="/tmp/He.vtk")
linesource = servermanager.sources.LineSource()
linesource.Point1 = [ ... ] # set point 1
linesource.Point2 = [ ... ] # set point 2
linesource.Resolution = ...

prob = servermanager.filters.Probe()
prob.Input = reader
prob.Source = linesource
probe.UpdatePipeline() # this should produce the result


I am leaving the use of the writer as an exercise :-)

Subject: [Paraview] Time shift not snapping correctly to fractional times
Message-ID: <B993F249-1426-4745-B534-224CF431028C@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I've recently been using the Temporal Shift Scale filter with data  
defined as having time steps every 0.1 units. In this situation, time  
does not always increment or "snap" properly to the data's defined  
time steps. (ParaView 3.3 cvs)

Attached is a toy data set consisting of a single point which travels  
around a radius=10 circle in the XY plane over time -- VTK XML  
Unstructured Grid files along with PVD files describing the time. One  
PVD file has time defined in 0.1 unit steps (dt01), the other is the  
same data defining time in 1.0 unit steps (dt1).  Note: To easily get  
the camera view correct, you might want to add a box source with sides  
= 20, viewed in outline mode.

If the pipeline consists of the original data, defined on 0.1 unit  
time steps, plus a Temporal Shift Scale with Shift = 0.1, and both the  
original and time shifted points are being viewed, then when time is  
incremented (say, though pressing the "up arrow" next to the Time  
display) the points should follow each other around the circle with an  
even spacing. Sometimes both points move forward properly, but  
sometimes the forward one pauses and the other "catches up", and  
sometimes the back one pauses and the forward one gets "ahead".  
Annotate Time also does not always increment properly, either.

If you use the PVD file with 1.0 unit time steps, and a TSS filter  
with shift=1.0, then this doesn't  happen.

Is this to be expected with how the time-snapping works with  
fractional time?

Thanks,
-Eric

P.S. Sorry I used the word "cell" in the data set name: the sim output  
I'm really trying to visualize is of biological cells diffusing in  
space. It's really point data on an unstructured grid.

Hey John,

It shows up in your PV Meshless, but not it the regular ParaView CVS  
-- thanks for pointing it out. I'll try it in the former for now, but  
if you could commit it to CVS that would be great.

Thanks a lot for the help,

Subject: [Paraview] Error in Setting the ClipFunction for the Clip Filter
Message-ID: <20080204170516.bp38yp6g0kgkosw4@www.webmail.ucl.ac.uk>

Hi,

This is a newbie question and any help will be much appreciated.

I am using the python interface to Paraview3 on my mac.

I have been unsuccesfully trying to set the ClipFunction property of a Clip
filter object. But I keep getting the error that the SetData function is
expecting two arguments. Please could you advise how the ClipFunction property
can be set via the python interface.

The error I am getting is:
>>> clipFilter1.ClipFunction = "Plane"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in ?
  File

Subject: [Paraview] Temporal shift with Python Programmable Filter
Message-ID: <B5296B68-3DDB-4A86-95F0-F9B5B5587660@cs.duke.edu>

Hey All,

This may seem like an odd question, but I think the answer may help  
clarify a larger problem I'm having...

I'm trying to calculate the velocity vectors for diffusing particles,  
and the way I'm doing it right now is to feed two copies of my  
Unstructured Grid data into the Python Programmable Filter (PPF). The  
first copy has a time shift of 0, and the second one has Shift = 1.  
These are both Temporal Data Sets, and so I've been accessing the  
underlying Unstructured Grids by doing this:

in0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0).GetDataSet(0,0)
in1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1).GetDataSet(0,0)

I force the PPF output to vtkUnstructuredGrid, and I have been making  
the output equivalent to one of the input points like so:

out1 = self.GetOutput()
out1.DeepCopy(in1)

(In the complete calculation I later add a vtkFloatArray to "out1"  
containing the calculated velocity vectors.)

The odd thing I see is that if the output is a copy of the Shift = 0  
point, I can increment time forward and backwards (arrow click on Time  
control) and everything looks fine. If the output is a copy of the  
Shift = 1 point, then on every other click it increments, and on the  
other clicks it doesn't move or change its scalar values. (If Shift =  
-1, then it increments properly backwards, but not forwards.)

Is there some sort of update forcing I should be doing that I'm not?  
Is this an unreliable way of accessing the data from within the  
Temporal Data Sets?

(I seemingly randomly get cases where my calculated velocity vector  
goes to zero and won't snap out of it unless I rebuild the whole  
pipeline from scratch, so I'm hoping I'm just doing something wrong  
here...)

Thanks for the help,
-Eric

Berk,
No, my current version of ParaView doesn't support Delaunay3D filter
(3.2.1). If you could enable it that would be great. I am not sure why
it needs that filter... it seems pretty obvious that a stream from
vectors should be doable.

Thanks for your help,

Alessandro

Subject: [Paraview] ImageAlgorithmm Readers, and Volume of Interest
Message-ID: <79B46863-3A09-4F14-8FF5-21D83472EAF1@gmail.com>

I am trying to write a new reader for PV 3 based on the  
vtkImageAlgorithm class. I have some basics completed but my  
RequestData() method is running multiple times where I don't really  
think it should be. I had this problem last year with another reader  
but I don't think I ever figured out what I was doing wrong.

One of the sticking points I am having trouble getting my head  
wrapped around is how to extract a subvolume from the main volume.  
The size of the vtkImageData is like 10,000 x 10,000 x 300 which will  
cause memory issues. At this point I would just like to render a  
subvolume of data from the main volume. In our RequestInformation()  
method we are setting the WHOLE_EXTENT to the actual volume size (10k  
x 10k x 300).

int vtkH5RoboMetReader::RequestInformation(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed 
(request),
vtkInformationVector **vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
               vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
...
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),  
this->DataExtent, 6 );
...
}


and then in the RequestData() method we are only extracting volume of  
interest:

int vtkH5RoboMetReader::RequestData( vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed 
(request),
                     vtkInformationVector** vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
                     vtkInformationVector* outputVector )
{
vtkImageData *output =
    vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT 
()));
int32 requestedExtent[6];
if(outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))
{
  // Get the requested data extent.
   requestedExtent[0] = 0;
   requestedExtent[1] = 1291;
   requestedExtent[2] = 0;
   requestedExtent[3] = 967;
   requestedExtent[4] = 100;
   requestedExtent[5] = 101;
}

output->SetExtent(requestedExtent);
output->SetOrigin(static_cast<double>(requestedExtent[0]),
                  static_cast<double>(requestedExtent[2]),
                  static_cast<double>(requestedExtent[4]));
output->SetSpacing(this->DataSpacing);
output->SetScalarTypeToUnsignedChar();
output->SetNumberOfScalarComponents(1);
output->AllocateScalars();
//Load data from file

return 1;
}

When I run the test program that renders the subvolume I get the  
RequestData() method being called multiple times. Is there something  
obvious that I am just missing? I tried looking at some of the other  
readers in vtk/paraview but nothing is really jumping out at me.

Thanks for any help

Message-ID: <0C7074DD-EE0C-48C6-8427-C6613C543B06@gmail.com>

I am developing a Custom reader for our data set. I would like to  
have some "information" type widgets and a Region of Interest widget.  
I believe I have the correct XML in my server manager file. When I  
run Paraview and select my data file I get some debug output then  
ParaView crashes. This is with PV 3.2.1 on OS X 10.4.11 using gcc.

The error output is:

not find requested method: "SetVOI"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke

   Argument 5 = int32_value {100}

It might be a problem with the wrapping of the SetVOI method.  What happens if you change int32 to int in the vtkH5RoboMetReader.h header file?

For more details, take a look at the vtkH5RoboMetReaderClientServer.cxx wrapper source created from the header file.  Set a breakpoint in the command function to see what conditions are not being met for matching the SetVOI method.

This is a total guess, but maybe it has something to do with the time value placed in the data set.  Data objects often hold the time value on which they are supposed to be defined.  Maybe when you copy the shifted data, its time value is also shifted.  When you then step the time, the new time now matches the shifted time from the last time update.  Perhaps the pipeline sees the time match and does not update the pipeline.

Yep. that was it. I replaced all the int32 (my own types) with  
vtkTypeInt32 and now the code is correctly being generated.

Thanks for the heads up.

Hey Ken,

That sounds like a reasonable guess. If that's the problem, do you  
know if there's a way to force the update to the correct time? I also  
can't seem to find any way of getting at the data object's time value...

It's just tough for me to figure out how to debug this one, unless  
someone can see something I've obviously left out.

Thanks,
-Eric

Maybe this shows the point you're trying to make? -- I can see that  
when the output of the PPF is a copy of the Shift = 0 point, the PPF  
executes every time I step the time forward or backwards. If the  
output of the PPF is a copy of the Shift = 1 point, then the PPF  
executes every time I step forward, but only executes every other time  
I click the time backwards. (I'm probing this by printing the output  
of GetUpdateTime(), and nothing prints out in the console every other  
time step.)

I'm trying to re-read your idea and see whether I really understand  
it... Are you talking about the data time steps matching, or the  
UpdateTime matching, so the pipeline doesn't know to update itself?

Okay, now it's starting to work both directions -- This is really  
bugging me, because problems seem to start or end for no apparent  
reason... Ugh. Things are reproducible if I've just freshly built the  
pipeline from scratch, but after working with it for a while problems  
come and go.

It must be something about copying the data and how changes get  
propagated up or downstream...

Let me know if you get any more ideas,
-Eric

The data object's time is stored in an information object maintained by the data object with the key vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS().  In C++, you can get this with something like

  data->GetInformation()->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS()).

You might try applying the following patch to vtkTemporalShiftScale.cxx.  It adjusts the time stamp on the internal data objects so that they match the time requested.  I never checked this in because I do not know if it will adversely affect anything else.  If it fixes your problem, we should consider it.

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython crashes with plane cut or clip
Message-ID: <f4b2fcda0802051019g2cae3cd1he8cfc5c6d647aff6@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

first, I would like to say that I am very pleased with pvpython. This is a
great tool for processing unsteady calculation from Fluent!

I think I am not the first one asking the question but pvpython seems to
crash when using the cutfilter on a very simple example.

===
from paraview import servermanager
connection=servermanager.Connect()

cube1 = servermanager.sources.CubeSource(Center=[4.0,3.9,0.0],  XLength=0.1,
YLength=0.1, ZLength=0.1)

plane1 = servermanager.sources.PlaneSource(Origin=[-5.0,3.9,-5.0], Point1=[-
5.0,3.9,5.0], Point2=[5.0,3.9,-5.0], XResolution=10, YResolution=10)

cutfunc = servermanager.filters.Cut()
cutfunc.Input=cube1
cutfunc.CutFunction=plane1
===

The error message is:

===
ERROR: In
/home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1001
vtkProcessModule (0x807b7d0): Object type: vtkCutter, could not find
requested method: "SetCutFunction"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = id_value {11}
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetCutFunction}
  Argument 2 = id_value {8}

ERROR: In
/home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1002
vtkProcessModule (0x807b7d0): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.
Aborted
====

In addition, when using clip filter, a similar error message still remains.

Do you have any clue? Is it a bug or am I doing something wrong?
I am using Paraview 3.2.1 binaries for Linux 32b.

Thank you in advance.

I'll try the patch later this afternoon when I have more time and see  
if that helps.

With your tip I was able to probe the DATA_TIME_STEPS for all the data  
sets, and the result seems a little strange to me -- see if this helps:

e.g.
Shift 0 TemporalDataSet: t = 4.0
Shift 0 UnstructuredGrid: t = 4.0
Shift 1 TemporalDataSet: t = 4.0    <---
Shift 1 UnstructuredGrid: t = 3.0
Output UnstructuredGrid (copy of shift 1 UG): t = 3.0

Should that Shift 1 TemporalDataSet really have t = 4.0 -- shouldn't  
it be t = 3.0 in that case?

Thanks,
-Eric

If you look in the code for vtkTemporalShiftScale, you will see that there is a place in request data where it shifts the time values for the root temporal data set object (starting at about line 110).  The patch I gave you should change the Shift 1 UnstructuredGrid to t = 4.0.

Message-ID: <869959.40232.qm@web32612.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi, I am having problem with making an animation of some cell data. Maybe you could point me in the right direction.
I have 100 legacy vtk files which I read as a time series data. Each of files contains unstructured grid with couple of scalar cell data sets defined. Now I would like to animate one data set over time, i.e. color each frame by the values of given cell data. However when I choose correct 'color by' field in Display tab in Object Inspector and than animate the time series coloring switches to Solid Color for other time frames. Is there a way to choose a data set for all times with some filter or script? I am kind of new to ParaView data flow concept, so in case of script I would appreciate an example. 
Best 

Pawel.

animations were quite easy with 2.6.2. Less easy with 3.2.1. What are 
the basic steps using 3.2.1? My files are written like

Creat .pvd file pointing your file series like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
 <DataSet timestep=" 1 " part="001" file="plot1.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 10 " part="001" file="plot10.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 20 " part="001" file="plot20.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 30 " part="001" file="plot30.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 40 " part="001" file="plot40.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 50 " part="001" file="plot50.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 60 " part="001" file="plot60.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 70 " part="001" file="plot70.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 80 " part="001" file="plot80.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 90 " part="001" file="plot90.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
 <DataSet timestep=" 100 " part="001" file="plot100.vtu" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
</Collection>
</VTKFile>

Then just open .pvd file and hit play button on animation bar.
Good luck!

Thanks, worked the first time. A last question, how do you show th time 
step annotation on the animation?

ParaView has volume rendering.  Is that what you mean?  Just change the representation (second combo box from the left in the second toolbar) to Volume.

Hey Ken,

Well, I applied the patch, and things are a little different (and  
maybe on the right track) but everything doesn't seem quite solved yet.

As you suggested, after the patch the Shift 1 UG shows t = 4.0 in the  
situation below. Can you explain to me why that is desirable?  
Shouldn't the Shift 1 data all have t = 3.0, not 4.0 (because of the  
time shift)? Or, are you trying to tell the system that as far as  
updates are concerned, all data sets are at t = 4.0, even though the  
data in the Shift 1 set is really from one step behind the Shift 0  
data set?

There are still a couple of strange results from probing the  
DATA_TIME_STEPS: First, if we take the example I was showing below,  
when I increment time forwards until everyone has t=4.0, then if I go  
backwards one step in time I get:

Shift 0 TDS:  t = 3.0
Shift 0 UG:  t = 4.0    <----
Shift 1 TDS:  t = 3.0
Shift 1 UG:  t = 3.0
Output UG (copy of shift 1 UG):  t = 3.0

So, when stepping backwards the Shift 0 UG doesn't get decremented  
properly for some reason. (If I stepped back again, everyone would be  
at t = 2.0, except the Shift 0 UG would show t = 3.0) In this case,  
though, when the Output is a (deep) copy of the Shift 1 UG, the points  
seem to move properly as time is incremented forward and backwards.

If the Output is a copy of the Shift 0 UG, though, the problem with  
that lack of decrement can lead to improper point movement. e.g. If I  
set up the same situation as above, incrementing up until everyone is  
at t = 4.0, then step backwards one click, I get:

Shift 0 TDS:  t = 3.0
Shift 0 UG:  t = 4.0    <----
Shift 1 TDS:  t = 3.0
Shift 1 UG:  t = 3.0
Output UG (copy of shift 0 UG):  t = 4.0   <----

Then, if I try to click forwards one time step from there, the  
Programmable Filter doesn't execute, and the Output point doesn't move  
properly on the screen -- presumably because the system thinks t = 4  
already and so it doesn't have to update?

Please let me know if you have any more ideas about what's going on.

Thanks for the help,
-Eric

Hello,
I would have the same request, a reload button would be very  
convenient !

Regards,
Antoine.

So I think I know what is happening here.  When vtkTemporalShiftScale copies data from input to output, it just copies pointers of all the data sets it contains.  Thus, when vtkTemporalShiftScale changes the time step of the unstructured grid, it is also changing the time step for the same object earlier in the pipeline.  This is probably causing problems with the time checking upstream in the pipeline and timesteps elsewhere that also share this data object.

I have attached some more changes to vtkTemporalShiftScale that might fix this problem.  This version iterates over all the multiblock data sets and creates a new copy of the data sets (but still keeping shallow copies of field and connectivity data).  Note that I made these changes against the latest CVS version of ParaView.  I think things might have changed a bit since the 3.2.1 release.

Hey Ken,

This sounds very likely to me as the culprit. It has seemed sometimes  
(but I can't always reproduce it) that some time shift problems appear  
and then lock in (as if the upstream data has changed) and from then  
on things don't work until I rebuild the pipeline from scratch.

I'm working from CVS so I'll try the fixes and let you know how it goes.

Great job -- that seems to have fixed most of it. Thanks!

There's still a little odd behavior at t = 0 and t = end. At t = 0 the  
Shift 0 UG still says t = 1.0, and at t = end the Shift 1 UG still  
says t = end-1...

Thanks again,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] How to display information in ParaView 3
Message-ID: <C24AE824-C3DF-48EF-8547-BB2C0F6618D8@gmail.com>

I am writing a custom reader and I would like to be able to display  
some properties of the data that is about to be read in the left side  
panel in ParaView. I thought the following server manager xml would  
get me there but nothing shows up.

<IntVectorProperty name="DataExtent"
command="GetDataExtent" number_of_elements="6" information_only="1"
default_values="0 1000 0 1000 0 10">
<SimpleIntInformationHelper />
</IntVectorProperty>

<IntVectorProperty name="FramesPerSlice"
command="GetFramesPerSlice" number_of_elements="1" information_only="1"
default_values="0">
<SimpleIntInformationHelper />
</IntVectorProperty>

I do have the "get" methods as listed in my reader? Anything I am  
doing wrong or hopefully, the right way to do this? examples in the  
PV3 source code to look at?

Thanks

Sorry, I was wrong. Under some fluke situation (that has happened  
twice during my testing, but that I can't figure out how to reproduce)  
it all works, but not usually.

Instead of me trying to describe details again, is there any chance  
you can just load my (small toy) data set and see how it works on your  
end? I'm attaching a zip file with a pvsm state file, plus the pvd and  
folder of vtu files for the data. (You'll have to edit the state file  
so that the pvd file path is correct for wherever you unpack  
everything on your system.)

If this isn't convenient for you, tomorrow morning I can get back to  
this and figure out how to describe the current state of affairs.

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView crashes trying to access property of Custom
	Reader
Message-ID: <AFDCA2CE-91A1-4F91-ACF9-F65C89A0A927@gmail.com>

I am writing a custom reader in ParaView 3 and I am getting a crash  
when ParaView goes looking for a method specified in the .pvsm file:

Here is the snippet from the .pvsm file:

       <IntVectorProperty
         name="FramesPerSlice"
         command="GetFramesPerSlice"
         number_of_elements="1"
         update_self="1"
         information_only="1"
         default_values="0">
         <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
       </IntVectorProperty>

Here is the snippet from vtkH5RoboMetReader.h

public:
   vtkGetMacro(FramesPerSlice, int);
   vtkSetMacro(FramesPerSlice, int);

private:
int FramesPerSlice;

Here is the snippet from the generated  
vtkH5RoboMetReaderClientServer.cxx file:
   if (!strcmp("GetFramesPerSlice",method) && msg.GetNumberOfArguments 
(0) == 2)
     {
     int      temp20;
       {
       temp20 = (op)->GetFramesPerSlice();
       resultStream.Reset();
       resultStream << vtkClientServerStream::Reply << temp20 <<  
vtkClientServerStream::End;
       return 1;
       }
     }
   if (!strcmp("SetFramesPerSlice",method) && msg.GetNumberOfArguments 
(0) == 3)
     {
     int      temp0;
     if(msg.GetArgument(0, 2, &temp0))
       {
       op->SetFramesPerSlice(temp0);
       return 1;
       }
     }

And lastly here is the error from ParaView 3.2.1
vtkProcessModule (0x8a5c7f0): Object type: vtkSMSourceProxy, could  
not find requested method: "GetFramesPerSlice"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
   Argument 0 = id_value {83}
   Argument 1 = string_value {GetFramesPerSlice}


ERROR: In /Users/Shared/OpenSource/ParaView3.2.1/Servers/Common/ 
vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1002
vtkProcessModule (0x8a5c7f0): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.


Could someone take pity on me and help me out with the proper way of  
doing this?

You probably want one of these two (the first is a read-only property)

       <IntVectorProperty
         name="FramesPerSlice"
         command="GetFramesPerSlice"
         number_of_elements="1"
         information_only="1">
         <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
       </IntVectorProperty>

or

       <IntVectorProperty
         name="FramesPerSlice"
         command="SetFramesPerSlice"
         number_of_elements="1"
         update_self="1"
         default_values="0">
         <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
       </IntVectorProperty>

ParaView doesn't crash now, but nothing extra shows up in the left  
side pane under the "Properties" tab.

This is on PV 3.2.1 on OS X Intel 10.4.11 using gcc. Just for  
completeness.

Ok, then try this:

        <IntVectorProperty
          name="FramesPerSlice"
          command="SetFramesPerSlice"
          number_of_elements="1"
          default_values="0">
        </IntVectorProperty>

Now I get a "Frames Per Slice" label and associated Text field.  
Except I just want to display some information about the file. This  
will actually "set" the value in the vtkH5RoboMetReader object, which  
is what I don't want.

Is this a bug in PV 3.2.1? or should I be thinking of a custom panel  
at this point?

It wasn't really a bug, but a feature that wasn't asked for.

If you're using ParaView from CVS, you can update your code and try this.
Then you don't have to make your own panel.

        <IntVectorProperty
          name="FramesPerSlice"
          command="GetFramesPerSlice"
          information_only="1">
          <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
        </IntVectorProperty>
     <Hints>
       <Property name="FramesPerSlice" show="1"/>
     </Hints>

Ok. That finally worked. Although it shows a non-editable text field.  
Wouldn't a QLabel be more intuitive to use for this?

Also, in PV 2.6 there was some sort of widget like a "Box" or  
something that you could use to group other widgets together. Is that  
still available?

Thanks for the help.

Hi Julien,
 
You should set your cutplane with something like:
 
implicit_functions = servermanager._createModule("implicit_functions")
plane1 = implicit_functions.Plane()
plane1.Normal = [1, 0, 0]

cutfunc = servermanager.filters.Cut(Input=cube1)
cutfunc.CutFunction = plane1
cutfunc.ContourValues = [1.0,2.5]

Good luck!
 
Sylvester

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython crashes with plane cut or clip


Dear all, 

first, I would like to say that I am very pleased with pvpython. This is a
great tool for processing unsteady calculation from Fluent!

I think I am not the first one asking the question but pvpython seems to
crash when using the cutfilter on a very simple example.

===
from paraview import servermanager
connection=servermanager.Connect()

cube1 = servermanager.sources.CubeSource(Center=[4.0,3.9,0.0],  XLength=0.1,
YLength=0.1, ZLength=0.1)

plane1 = servermanager.sources.PlaneSource(Origin=[-5.0,3.9,-5.0],
Point1=[-5.0,3.9,5.0], Point2=[5.0,3.9,-5.0], XResolution=10,
YResolution=10)

cutfunc = servermanager.filters.Cut()
cutfunc.Input=cube1
cutfunc.CutFunction=plane1
===

The error message is:

===
ERROR: In
/home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1001
vtkProcessModule (0x807b7d0): Object type: vtkCutter, could not find
requested method: "SetCutFunction"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = id_value {11}
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetCutFunction}
  Argument 2 = id_value {8}

ERROR: In
/home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1002
vtkProcessModule (0x807b7d0): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.
Aborted
====

In addition, when using clip filter, a similar error message still remains. 

Do you have any clue? Is it a bug or am I doing something wrong?
I am using Paraview 3.2.1 binaries for Linux 32b.

Thank you in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Errors from pvbatch
Message-ID: <47AB4D9B.2070500@psc.edu>

The state file works fine when I reload it into paraview but produces many 
errors when loaded by pvbatch. Here's the batch program "scaling.py":

===
from paraview.servermanager import *
Connect()
LoadState( "scaling.pvsm" )
view = GetRenderView()
view.StillRender()
view.WriteImage( "scaling.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 10 )
===

The strange thing is that it works and produces the expected image! Here are 
the first few error messages:

===
$ pvbatch scaling.py
ERROR: In VTK/IO/vtkXMLReader.cxx, line 160
vtkPVDReader (0x8d4fd60): File name not specified
ERROR: In Servers/Common/vtkSelfConnection.cxx, line 147

ERROR: In Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMPart.cxx, line 221
vtkSMPart (0x8d569d0): Missing data information.
...
===

I don't see any mention of this in the bug list and I don't remember seeing a 
question about it on this list. Am I doing something fundamentally wrong?

Hey Kent,

For the brief period that I've been using servermanager to load state  
files within Python, I always get a lot of these same sort of errors  
-- I just haven't taken the time to pursue it due to the fact that my  
images/animations always render properly, despite the initial errors.

Message-ID: <B24C39F2-94FC-4487-A14E-211A75636075@gmail.com>

I think I would like to create a custom Object Panel for my Custom  
reader. Been looking through the wiki to get an idea of what I need  
to do and I think I am finding some disconnects.

This is what I would like to do:
    Design my panel in QtDesigner.
    Compile my panel directly into ParaView 3 (NOT a Plugin)
    Compile my custom reader directly into PV 3 (This I can do already)

My custom reader class is "vtkH5RoboMetReader". Couple of questions  
straight out of the gate:

What would my CMakeLists.txt look like? From the examples it would  
seem that all the examples build plugins?

Lets start with that and see where we go from there..

There currently isn't a way to do that without making a plugin.

You can derive from pqLoadedFormObjectPanel, and give it the .ui file you made 
from the QtDesigner.  Any widget that has a name matching the properties in 
the server manager xml will automatically work for you.

Subject: [Paraview] Cuts
Message-ID: <6CDD60864A1CCF49B95D5FF1E63EC79205CBBCBE@UKDEWEB005.uk.rolls-royce.com>

With the work that my users are doing they can work a lot in x-r-theta rather than x-y-z.  I would like to create a filter that will allow the user to perform a cut in x,y,z, r or theta (but while still viewing in x-y-z) and using the mouse to select much like the current cutting filter (just without the rotation).  Could anyone give me any pointers on how to implement this - I'm not sure where in the code that it renders the cutting plane in the current filter.  Any help would be appreciated.

Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <b02264720802080825r6187890dya17ad16bf2b74d15@mail.gmail.com>

I have a program (ezViz) that links against VTK, and I want to update it to
instead link against ParaView, or specifically the VTK that comes with
ParaView (to get the VTK classes that don't come with the standard VTK
distribution like the vtkSpyPlotReader).  But I don't see a
UseVTK.cmakefile anywhere in my compiled ParaView
3.2.1 build. Am I missing something?

If you do a FIND_PACKAGE(VTK) and set VTK_DIR to the VTK subdirectory 
under the paraview build directory, it should work fine.
The UseVTK.cmake file can be included as INCLUDE(${VTK_USE_FILE})

Well, that requires me to keep my build tree again.. Not optimal, but it's
an answer.

Although, stuff like the vtkSpyPlotReader is not in that VTK tree, it's
under "Servers/Filters" of the root ParAView tree.  How can I get access to
these?

I don't quite follow.  I can have one build tree for ParaView (which includes 
a VTK build), and have other projects use that one VTK build inside the 
ParaView build.

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

Then link with the Paraview libraries that have those extra VTK classes you 
need.

Well, I was hoping to purge the source & build directories once the ParaView
build was complete, and just leave the Installed binaries for users.  Then I
could link my app against it as long as I wanted.

Sounds like I have to keep it around for a while..

Thanks for the info tho.

Subject: [Paraview] Can These Options Be Combined in 3.2.1?
Message-ID: <47AC8E66.80901@psc.edu>

Can these options coexist in ParaView 3.2.1?

- MPI
- Python wrapping (to get pvbatch)
- shared libraries (required for Python)
- parallel HDF (seems like a good idea)

On a 64-bit CentOS system "make" fails with this:

[ 24%] Building C object Utilities/hdf5/CMakeFiles/vtkhdf5.dir/H5FDmpio.o
/usr/local/packages/paraview/3.2.1/src/Utilities/hdf5/H5FDmpio.c: In function

plus a few more similar ones.

TIA!

Thanks Berk.

Just one question: is it possible to create a python script imports a 
list of files to Paraview. This would be a convenient alternative to 
writing PVSM file.

Subject: [Paraview] Gridding Problem with VTK Unstructured data file
Message-ID: <c84c3d370802081308g105dc2ddha7b27e3db0d5632f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am having an issue with generating a proper grid, and without a
proper grid ParaView tends to crash when you try to do anything. As
you can see from the images I attached, the problem is caused by a
relatively small number of points. As a new ParaView user, I am hoping
one of the experts can give me some advice.

I am simulating the flow around a cylinder in an unstructured grid
with Cartesian cells. The data I have available is: cell center
co-ordinates, cell dimensions (dx,dy,dz), and pressure and velocity
data at the center of the cell.

I am outputting my data in Partitioned VTK Unstructured format (XML)
with Cell type=11, using a routine I wrote myself. I have included an
image of a portion of my grid to show the problem I am having with
connectivity. At first glance it appears to be a simple problem of one
of the nodes of a cell having the wrong index, but I think the issue
is more complicated. I would have liked to attached my .vtu file for
someone to load in ParaView 3.2.1, but it is ~2MB and too large for
the mailing list.

I have done numerous tests, but I can't find anything that should
cause a problem in my point/node data and cell connectivity/indexing
data. It is possible that the issue has to do with matching node
co-ordinates. For example I need to calculate the 8 nodes for each
cell based on the center of the cell and dimensions. Since I can't
have any of my indexed points repeated, I have to filter the nodes to
make sure common nodes share the same index. I am comparing numbers of
DOUBLE type, so I do my comparison with a relative error. Setting the
error too small or too large can mess up the indexing procedure, but I
don't know of any other way to do it.


Thanks in advance,

Stefan Murphy

Subject: [Paraview] Difference between UPDATE_EXTENT and WHOLE_EXTENT and
	when to set what
Message-ID: <6F408EE2-9173-4F04-A29D-E1CCEA2A1008@gmail.com>

I am _still_ trying to write a custom reader for ParaView. The reader  
reads a bunch of data out of an HDF5 file and into a vtkImageData  
object. The problem is that the actual data set could be 7446 x 8332  
x 125 which is larger than most peoples desktop can handle. The  
problem we are running into is our RequestData method is being called  
multiple times.

Questions: When should I call the following:
outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), this- 
 >DataExtent, 6 );
outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(), this- 
 >VOI, 6 );

and if I do call both, what should I _really_ be setting them to?
Assume DataExtent[6] = {0,7446,0,8332,0,125}
Assume VOI[6] = {0,1292, 0, 968, 0, 100, 102};

Now, in the RequestData() method we are initializing the output to:
requestedExtent[0] = (outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[0];
requestedExtent[1] = (outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[1];
requestedExtent[2] = (outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[2];
requestedExtent[3] = (outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[3];
requestedExtent[4] = (outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[4];
requestedExtent[5] = (outInfo->Get 
(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))[5];
   output->SetScalarType(VTK_TYPE_UINT8);
   output->SetSpacing(this->DataSpacing);
   output->SetOrigin( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
   output->SetDimensions(requestedExtent[1] + 1, requestedExtent[3] +  
1, z + 1);
   output->SetNumberOfScalarComponents( 1);
   output->AllocateScalars();
   output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("RoboMet Voxels");
   output->GetPointData()->SetActiveScalars("RoboMet Voxels");

Is this correct or what am I doing wrong? VOI can be set from the  
ParaView Interface via an auto-generated panel.

Should I make the WHOLE_EXTENT really just the VOI? Problem there is  
that VOI isn't being set until AFTER RequestInformation is being called.

Any help is appreciated.

If I could suggest a two features:

1. A reload menu option -- so that a file thats been changed on disk can 
be reloaded without having to delete and reimport it.

2. Drag and drop reordering of files/entities in the pipeline browser

Thanks,

- Olumide

Yes it is possible to create a script that loads in a list of files or a 
directory of files. I have included a stripped down version of a script 
I wrote that does what you ask.

It supports paths to single files, directories, lists of paths, lists of 
directories. Directory loading will recurse through sup directories.

If you want to add more types of file loading (currently only handles 
.vtk),  add more to the dict  called allowedFiles.

Hello!

Problem is very simple! You specified 1 less that the correct number of
points in
<Piece NumberOfPoints="15479" NumberOfCells="11934"> . It is quite clear!
For the type of your geometry gridding, number of nodes must be even number!
:-)

Just modify this line to
<Piece NumberOfPoints="15480" NumberOfCells="11934">

It works fine and must.

There may have been some logical errors in your writer routine, please
correct that as soon as possible hahaha...

Good luck!

Working with my custom reader I am trying to track down what I think  
is a bug somewhere in the combination of my requestInformation/ 
RequestData methods. When my reader gets loaded, my requestData  
method gets fired multiple times (up to 8 in a row it seems). I was  
wondering what some of the reasons for this might be so that I might  
be able to figure this out.

Thanks for any help

My guess is that somewhere in your RequestData method the algorithm is calling Modified on itself.  The call is probably indirect.  For example, if you are using any of the Set* methods defined by VTK macros, that will indirectly call Modified.

To check this, try printing out the time stamp (this->MTime.GetMTime()) at the beginning and the end of RequestData.  It should be the same.  If not, narrow down where it is changing.

Nope. Inserting a print statement as the first and next to last lines  
in RequestData() says the modified times are the same. My RequestData  
method is being run 6 times in succession.

Could this have something to do with UPDATE_EXTENTS and UPDATE_WHOLE  
extents?

Also, I do see the following 2 debug statements between Each  
Successive RequestData() call:

**----RequestData Ending Modified Time: 64511
Debug: In /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/ 
vtkAlgorithm.h, line 151
vtkH5RoboMetReader (0x1eb63c60): vtkH5RoboMetReader (0x1eb63c60):  
returning AbortExecute of 0


Debug: In /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/ 
vtkAlgorithm.h, line 150
vtkH5RoboMetReader (0x1eb63c60): vtkH5RoboMetReader (0x1eb63c60):  
setting AbortExecute to 0

**--- RequestData Starting      Times=6 Modified Time: 64511


But since the Modified times are the same I am assuming that this  
isn't really the problem?

Subject: [Paraview] Annotate time on XY plots?
Message-ID: <7F00DC9D-707D-4E46-8DBA-FEE15B03BEA7@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

Is there a way (or plans) to make the Annotate Time filter work on 2d  
XY plots?

(I often output animated graphs of our scalar data plotted over a  
line, which works very well, but it would be a lot more helpful if we  
could see what time point the graph is referring to on any given frame.)

Thanks,
-Eric

I am afraid not. The XY plots are done in Qt and the annotate filter
works only in VTK windows.

Subject: [Paraview] Stream tracing
Message-ID: <c84c3d370802110834w5e02a0d7i39345a6c1b049cec@mail.gmail.com>

I'm seeking the help of a ParaView expert again.

I've gone through a couple tutorials on generating stream traces, and
they worked fine, however you can see from the attached image that I
am not able to make any useful traces with my own data.

I have 2 problems. First- I would like to use the line source that can
be seen in my image, however I would like to have more evenly spaced
seeds on the line, since when they are clustered together (as seen) I
get the error: "Coincident points in polyline...can't compute
normals".

Second- I would like the stream traces to traverse the entire domain.
I.E. start at the inlet and either cycle around in the vortex behind
the cylinder, or go to the outlet. Adjusting the "Max.Propagation
LENGTH" does not seem to do anything after a certain value, and the
traces seen in my images are as long as I can get them.

Here is how I generated the image I attached:

1. Imported a VTK Unstructured data file containing 3 scalars in cell
data form: xVelocity, yVelocity, zVelocity.
2. Calculated Velocity vector with the calculator with: xVelocity*iHat
+ yVelocity*jHat + zVelocity*kHat.
3. Used the "Cell to Point Data" filter to obtain point data for Stream Tracer.
4. With CelltoPointData selected, I used the StreamTracer filter, with
the line source.

Any ideas or advice?

Thanks,

I have no idea.  Maybe Berk knows something about the executive that would explain the multiple executions.

The first three definitely work together.  I haven't done anything with parallel HDF myself, but I can think of no reason why it should not work.

MPI_MODE_RDWR is part of MPI 2.  Perhaps your implementation of MPI does not fully support all of the MPI 2 extensions (in particular the MPI I/O functions and definitions).

Thanks! Removing the request for parallel HDF allowed it to work.

You may be happier by upgrading your MPI to something that supports MPI I/O.  Parallel IO can make a big difference.

Message-ID: <60951274-FAAE-4E1D-94FC-919566FFB675@gmail.com>

I was under the impression that I needed to set the UPDATE_EXTENT  
like the following in my RequestInformation() method:

outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(), this- 
 >DataExtent, 6 );

but I think that is a bad assumption for a reader. Is the ParaView  
pipeline actually setting the UPDATE_EXTENT based on what it needs to  
render?

Are you running on parallel? Which paraview version are you using?

The format description at www.xdmf.org is a good start but is difficult to 
follow and might be out of date. For example is the type of topology 
"TopologyType" or "Type"? What is a precision 1 float? The ARL pages have some 
great examples but the text seems to be the same. Suggestions?

No. UPDATE_EXTENT() is set on the input information during
RequestUpdateExtent(). A reader should NOT set UPDATE_EXTENT(). A
reader should set WHOLE_EXTENT() in RequestInformation().

I am running ParaView CVS (From a few nights ago) on OS X 10.4.11  
(intel). Far as I know nothing "parallel" was enabled when I ran cmake.

So I think I finally have this working.

In Request Information() I gather the actual full size extents of the  
data set (7000 x 8000 x 200). In the RequestData() method I get what  
the user actually wants (VOI), create a new vtkImageData based on VOI  
information, load the data into the new vtkImageObject, then do an  
output->ShallowCopy(image); just before the return of the RequestData  
Method. Do you see any drawbacks to using this type of approach?

This seems to work as the RequestData() method is only executing once  
now.

The next thing I have to figure out is how to get some labels that  
tell the user just how large their data set it. Probably have to go  
with a Plugin with a custom Qt Panel at this point as I don't see any  
other way of doing it.

In PV 2.6 there used to be ways to get read only properties from a  
custom filter class and present those to the user. Doesn't seem like  
those facilities are there any more with PV 3.x

Thanks for the heads up.

Just submitted bug 6332.

Reading an xmf file with one grid (structured 128x128x128) and several scalar 
node variables works fine when the strides are all 1. When any stride is set to 
2 the error shown in "Addl Info" is displayed. Changing the stride back to 1 
restores things.

Is the VOI a parameter of the reader? Are you setting the WHOLE_EXTENT() to VOI?

VOI is what the user wants to see.

in RequestInformation we have:
outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), this- 
 >DataExtent, 6 );

where this->DataExtent is the entire 7000 x 8000 x 200 image size.

Then in RequestData() we have the following:

outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), this- 
 >VOI, 6);


Does that help?

That's not good. You should not set WHOLE_EXTENT() in RequestData().
Set it to VOI in RequestInformation(). Otherwise, you will run into
problems sooner or later.

I can do that but I don't think it will work.

In paraview, I have managed to set an auto-generated UI for the VOI.  
Now, the user opens our file, RequestInformation is run (I can put  
some sane defaults for the VOI) and things are ok so far. Now the  
user clicks "Apply" and then SetVOI is called with the values from  
the GUI and then RequestData() is called after that. So where do I  
update WHOLE_EXTENT? Or just take the values from the VOI, create a  
vtkImageObject from that, and then just ShallowCopy to the output  
object?

I'm a bit confused at this point. If our case is NOT a standard use  
case for the pipeline than I guess I can look more seriously into  
developing a full blown Plugin for our data file.

Mike,

I accomplished what you want with one of our custom readers. In my 
opinion the documentation for RequestInformation, RequestData, extents, 
etc. is so poor that it is useless.

At RequestInformation I read enough of the input to get the overall 
input array size; apply the user-selected VOI; and return the desired 
subset as the whole extent. At RequestData I read the rest. I just don't 
bother letting VTK/ParaView manage the selection of the VOI. This has 
worked for 2.6.1 through 3.2.1.

Pretty sure that was where we were going to end up BUT as far as I  
can tell, the order of execution is :
RequestInformation()
SetVOI() // From the GUI in ParaView
RequestData();

So we never really get a chance to get the VOI until RequestData  
fires.. Is that what you have seen?

Just bumping this message because I am going soon to commit a lot of 
changes to xdmf reader/writer etc and if anyeon else is working on the 
code they should be warned.

I'll post a more detailed list (of changes) later today or this week.

John,

Thanks for the warning ... I need to make a change to the reader
so that it can read the XML from a string instead of a file.
I'm adding runtime vis to an MPI app and want to avoid writing
to the filesystem.

I belive it is supposed to work that your SetVOI() method should call modified, which will in turn cause the pipeline to call RequestInformation() on the next update.  Make sure that SetVOI() is actually calling Modified().

Subject: [Paraview] multiple embedded Mesh in vtk/vtu
Message-ID: <47B2F3ED.4000309@scconsultants.com>

Hello ,
has anyone ever tried to bind multiple mesh data (nodes & connectivity) 
together in the same vtu/vtk file so that
data attached to the first mesh could be mapped onto the 2nd one for 
instance.
We are  using unstructured tetreadra elements types.

Thanks to anyone having this experience.

Subject: [Paraview] Xdmf Reader/Writer Changes
Message-ID: <47B2FDE2.2040905@cscs.ch>

Over the last week I've made some changes to the vtk-Xdmf Reader/Writer 
classes. I'd like to commit these changes, but they are potentially a 
cause for discussion so I'll post my lst of changes in the hope someone 
can give constructive/destructive criticism/objections ...apologies if I 
make silly typos in the following as I'm doing it from memory, the basic 
gist of it should be correct.

vtkXdmfWriter
-------------------
1) Added a SetTimeValue method. When set, the writer adds <Time 
value="..."/> to the generated file (grid). The principal reason for 
this addition is to allow
Loop
  read stuff
  SetTimeValue(...)
  writer->Write()
EndLoop

the generated Xdmf file now contains a collection of grids for the data 
you have been writing - see next entry for additional...

2) Added flag AppendGridsToDomain which should be set before the above 
looping procedure. This stops the Xmdf writer from creating a new *.xdmf 
file on each write but instead opens the existing one if present, reads 
the text into a string, appends the new grid and then closes it cleanly. 
Thus allowing multiple grid in the same file.
Also added an extra CollectionType ivar (use "TemporalCollection") and 
writer->CloseCollection() call which lets you write the tail of the file 
after a grid collection has been written.

3) Added a flag InputsArePieces - this allows me to read N blocks 
(typically 64 from 64 processors) one by one, call addinput as follows

writer->setInputsArePieces
writer->setAppendGridsToDomain
writer->SetFullGridSize(x,y,x)
writer->SetCollectionType("TemporalCollection")
loop over time steps
  writer->SetHeavyDataSetName(hdf5 file name generated from prefix + 
time step)
  writer->SetTimeValue()
  loop over blocks
    read block
    writer->AddInput()
  end block loop
  writer->write
end loop time
writer->CloseCollection()

On each write, the blocks are written into the same HDF5 file using the 
dataspace generated from the Extent of the data. I have only implemented 
this for vtkImageData so far. All blocks are written into one hdf5 file 
- and one hdf5 file is created per time step in this scenario.

4) Due to a problem with discovering Extents and wholeExtents (from a 
single piece of data) I posted to the list last week, I have added 
FullGridSize (Vector 3 int) set get macro so that when pieces are added, 
the whole extent is known and the dataspaces can be computed correctly. 
Without this, a piece with extent 0,11,0,11,0,11 does not know if it is 
part of a 0,64,0,64,0,64 or some other original size and the correct 
dataspace cannot be inferred. (assumes vtkImageData currently, c.f. 
discussion about extents of pv list)

5) Bug fix. There was an error in one of the Data copy routines from 
vtkDataArray to Xdmf array which munged variables with vector fields. 
Scalars were ok, but vectors wrong. Fixed it.

The (time/collection/block) additions above for the Writer have allowed 
me to generate one file per time step of contiguous image blocks from a 
simulation dataset which is split into many sub blocks - and overall 
make life much easier for me to process the data on a variety of 
configurations. (by which I mean reading 64 block on 8 processors is ok, 
but on 9, is not so good, and passing ghost info from one block to the 
next is painful, but when stored in a single file, getting the overlap 
cells is easy on any number of processors).

The writer changes should also work if we have parallel writes going to 
the same HDF5 file. We can re-use the data space generation so that all 
pieces are correctly written. The code is actually quite small, but is 
mesy because each time the file is closed and opened between grid 
writes, the dataspace structers are reset in the constructor of the Xdmf 
objects. etc etc...


vtkXdmfReader
-------------------
1) When the reader encounters an Xdmf file with Grid type = 
"TemporalCollection", it reads the time values from each grid and sets 
the TIME_STEPS and TIME_RANGE during UpdateInformation, internally it 
sets its output type to TemporalDataSet, but due to limitations of the 
way these dataset are handled by the executives, it actually exports a 
true vtkImage/vtkUnstructuredGrid/etc during RequestDataObject. This is 
actually the preferred was of handling it since ImageData exported 
downstream can be connected to image filters, whereas TemporalDataset 
can only be connected to composite inputs. The Actual Type of dataset 
created depends on the type of data in the xdmf file. Temporal 
collections of MultiGroup data are supported, but so far untested. The 
data tyope can change between timne steps if necessary, but is also 
untested.
1b) The description above does not preclude being able to generate 
multiple time steps simultaneously, if the UPDATE_TIME_STEPS has been 
set to a vector of values, then we arrange for the executive to place a 
TemporalDataset on the output which we can fill with data during 
RequestDataObject. I will need to double check the order of events 
between passes to ensure that this is possible and we may need to add a 
new Information key to tell the executive that multiple steps can be 
generated. Previously we assumed thata temporal dataset could be output, 
but in practise this confuses the pieplie as a dataobject is allowed to 
be either a dataset or a multigroup dataset and the logic in the 
executive gets confused if the dataobject can switch between all 3 of 
dataset/multigroup/temporal. If you read this and do not understand wht 
I'm talking aboiut, then you don't need to know and can ignore it, but 
Ken Moreland (for one) knows what I mean. Adding an extra key could be a 
solution to this problem. Discussion another day.

2) When Request Data occurs, if UPDATE_TIME_STEPS is set and time steps 
exist, the correct data set is returned for the time requested.
So far only discrete time steps can be stored/retrieved and so it is not 
yet possible to specify a grid that is statice for times between a<b and 
then changes to something else between c<d etc etc. But this will be a 
goal in the future.

3) For convenience, SetTimeStep will allow the user to loop over N time 
steps (in raw vtk style code) and output each successive dataset, but if 
UPDATE_TIME_STEPS is set by the executive (via the paraview GUI for 
example), it will override the manually set TimeStep.

4) Time collection of data in XDMF will all have the same grid name (eg 
zone1 at time 1,2,3,4,5) - this currently breaks the xdmf reader, so I 
renamed the grids with zone1#000 zone#001, the names go into a std::map 
structure, which would break if we used the same grid name each time. I 
suspec that this map could be modified to a list because in practice the 
grid name is not used anywhere else I don't think apart from the GUI 
enable/disable and we could put in another mechanism for checking. So 
currently I broke this but I doubt it matters.

There are probably some other changes, that I will remember after I've 
sent this.

Summary
------------
I have no idea how other people are using vtkXdmfReader/Writer so I 
really have no idea how much my changes will affect others. I doubt it 
will break much and I'll be happy to collaborate on integrating changes.

Time : The implementation I've made for writing multiple time steps out, 
and reading them back is working - but I'm not sure it is how the 
implementation was intended to be from the xdmf list postings made by 
Jerry a week or two back. My implementation allows me to basically write 
T grids one after the other with a single <time value ="blah"> set in 
each grid and no <time values = "list of values"> in the parent grid.

I'll hold off committing anything until I receive feedback. My next task 
will be to ensure that when I read data back from N processors, the Xdmf 
Reader does what it is supposed to do. Currently it does not AFAIK. 
(crashes when I try it, but not debugged anything yet).

Indeed, each of the my routines to set the VOI bounds (one each for the min/max 
in X/Y/Z) calls Modified().

During development I had temporary print statements everywhere and as I 
remember it these routines to set the VOI were called both before and after 
RequestInformation.

John,

Thanks! I have built two versions of ParaView, one serial and one parallel, and 
so will never need to run the parallel version in serial mode. I'll be using 
this on a parallel file system and so reading in parallel should help.

Dear all,

We are currently upgrading our Data Visualization lab from OpenDX to
ParaView. :)  (7 years ago, we made the step from AVS to OpenDX)

I have not been able to get the ParticleTracer going.  I'm
experimenting with the dataset Jean Favre makes available with his LEA
implementanion (I had to make a PVD for this, anybody want it?).  With
this dataset loaded, ParticleTracer remains greyed out.

In the documentation, it says: "This filter operates on any type of
data set, provided it has point-centered vectors."  What exactly does
this mean?  The LEA dataset has a "velocity" vectors component.  In a
single VTI timestep, it has:
<DataArray type="Float32" Name="velocity" NumberOfComponents="3"
format="appended" offset="0"/>

The calculator also seems to think of these as vectors.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for any advice,
Charl

I should have mentioned that I'm using ParaView 3.2.1, built from

Point data means the vectors are given at the points aka nodes aka vertices. 
The alternative is cell data where the vectors are given for the entire cell. 
You might try running your data through the filter that converts cell data to 
point data. Note that such a filter uses averaging and so will change your data 
  a little.

Hi there Kent, thanks for answering!

I should have shown more of the VTI file:
     <PointData Vectors="velocity">
        <DataArray type="Float32" Name="velocity"
NumberOfComponents="3" format="appended" offset="0"           />
      </PointData>

That's very definitely point data.   As far as the ParaView interface
is concerned, it also seems to be point data: when I select this
dataset, the "Cell data to point data" filter is DISABLED and the
"Point data to cell data" is ENABLED.

Any other ideas?

Thanks,
Charl

Are you referring to TemporalStreamTracer? If so what particular 
problems are you having. I'm working on this class at the moment and may 
be in a position to improve/fix things

Are you using raw cpp or the Paraview GUI?

Subject: [Paraview] What part of the pipeline is producing the	request for

Ok, so now I have
RequestInformation()
{
...
outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), this- 
 >VOI, 6 );
...
}

and RequestData() I load the data into a newly created vtkImageData  
object, then shallow copy into the
actual output data object:

vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
vtkImageData* output = vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get 
(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
vtkTypeInt32 error = 1;
vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> imageData =  
vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData>::New();
error = loadDataFromMXAFile(outInfo, imageData, this->VOI);
output->ShallowCopy(imageData);

In paraview from CVS this causes multiple executions of the pipeline.  
Before, where I thought I had "fixed" the issue I was calling:

outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), this- 
 >VOI, 6 );

in RequestData(). Berk said that wasn't a good idea so I removed it.  
So now I am back to square 1 again.

Thanks
Mike

OK. I didn't read all your message.

TemporalStremTracer actually expects a vtkTemporalDataSet as input, but 
the LEA test data is a series of vti files and the generic reader in 
PraaView does not export TIME_RANGE so the executive won't allow it to 
be used as a temporal dataset.

I can make available another test (3D) dataset if it will help

I've made a PVD file (see attached) for the LEA VTI files.  That seems
to assign a timestep to each frame, is that not sufficient?

Thanks for having a look,

In the call to loadDataFromMXAFile, you should be using the value in UPDATE_EXTENT, not VOI.  To review, WHOLE_EXTENT is what the reader reports to the downstream components what data is available (and reporting VOI is an easy way to limit the data to what the user wants).  UPDATE_EXTENT is the part of the data that the downstream components want.  If you return with data that does not match up to UPDATE_EXTENT, the pipeline might execute again trying to get the range of data it asked for.

I understand. Now. my problem. In RequestInformation I read part of  
my file to get what I am assuming should be the "WHOLE_EXTENT", which  
is 7334 x 8448 x 200 as a uint8 vtkImageData object. This is too  
large to fit into memory the machines that this will be run on. I  
placed some auto-generated gui widgets in ParaView for the customer  
to select a VOI. I have used the normal vtk macros for the set/get  
methods for VOI.

So say the customer is only interested in a VOI of 500, 1500, 200,  
1800, 100, 105. Could you lay out what calls should be made in each  
of the RequestInformation and RequestData methods? (just the major  
things we have been talking about, I can fill in the rest). I have  
tried lots of different configurations and the only ones that seem to  
work are the ones that are NOT recommended to do.

If you want the entire vtkH5RoboMetReader.h/cpp, I can send that  
along also.

Thanks
Mike.

Dear Paraview users,

I have just found out about Paraview. I believe it's a great tool if  
you know how to use it. I am trying to create a contour map from an  
X,Y,Z excel file (using raw file or cvs file), just three simple  
columns, but I know the file must include some extra information,  
though I cannot see how to write it. I have the Paraview Guide book  
but I find it quite advanced. Does anyone have a file example for this  
purpose or knows how to create the file? Any advice/help in this  
matter would be highly appreciated.

Thank you very much.

Patty

Unfortunately, the csv reader in ParaView still needs work.  It's not going to be able to do what you want yet.

You might try converting your data into a VTK legacy file.  They support ASCII data, so it's not complicated to convert a csv to one in a text editor.  Details about the file formats can be found in the VTK books or the document at the attached link.

Patty,
I am sure that some folks read data like you mention, but another option is to write in a "paraview smart" file format.  One of the oldies, but goodies, is a vtk file format.  (ParaView stands on top of the VTK toolkit).  One way to see a vtk file is to open ParaView, Sources menu, Sphere, Apply.  Then, File menu, Save Data, change "Files of type" to vtk, name the file, OK, then write it as ASCII.

Pretty good write-ups are available here: http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/intranet/it-service/applications/paraview/vtk-file-formats/

The VTK file formats are defined here: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/5/51/VTK-File-Formats.pdf

Dear Paraview users,

I have just found out about Paraview. I believe it's a great tool if you know how to use it. I am trying to create a contour map from an X,Y,Z excel file (using raw file or cvs file), just three simple columns, but I know the file must include some extra information, though I cannot see how to write it. I have the Paraview Guide book but I find it quite advanced. Does anyone have a file example for this purpose or knows how to create the file? Any advice/help in this matter would be highly appreciated.

Thank you very much.

Patty

In the example you give, you should just report 500, 1500, 200, 1800, 100, 105 in WHOLE_EXTENT and respond to whatever UPDATE_EXTENT the pipeline asks you for.  If you are in serial mode, UPDATE_EXTENT should be set to WHOLE_EXTENT.  On a parallel server, ParaView will automatically break up the WHOLE_EXTENT and set the UPDATE_EXTENT on each process to a different piece.  In either case, just respond to the UPDATE_EXTENT that the pipeline gives you and that should work.

How is this not working?  Are we talking about the multiple calls to RequestData again?  Could it be that you have set the wrong extents information on the output data?

John,

I'm still going thru this to understand the implications. But I think
that some of this needs to be reflected in the XDMF library as opposed
to just being in the reader/writer. For example, if there is a new
GridType="TemporalCollection" it should be in XdmfGrid.[h cxx] so that
it propagates to all other SW.

Maybe instead of GridType="TemporalCollection" we have 
GridType="Collection" and then CollectionType="Temporal | Spatial".
If you needed both you could have a temporal collection of spatial
collections. This would need support in XdmfGrid but be easy to add.

I like it. I actually could have used "collection" but found that in the 
reader having a "temporal collection" removed a whole chunk of logic to 
test if each grid had time information. If the collection has a type 
that can be queried, problem solved.

Thank you so very much. I was able to implement what you wrote and  
now my reader is behaving much better in ParaView. I have put in some  
additional checks to see if either the input file or the VOI has  
changed to cut down on reading information from the file when it  
hasn't changed.

Thanks for everyone sticking with me

I'd like to be a fly on the wall in your office when you start getting 
the infamous "Update extent is not within the Whole Extent" messages 
when you change your VOI!

Then, File menu, Save Data, change "Files of type" to vtk, name the file, OK, then write it as ASCII.

The 1st link above was (*quite*) illuminating for me, would you know of 
any similar which address writing out multi-block structured (IJ & IJK) 
grid & field data ? I am 100% unfamiliar w/ XML files/formatting, so 
links w/ sample files/coding (such as the 1st one above) are extremely 
helpful for me. Thanks in advance.

Any idea what produces those types of errors? I have been testing the  
code pretty heavily this afternoon and all _seems_ to be working  
correctly....

I can go from a VOI of 0, 500, 0, 500, 100, 102 -> 2000, 3000, 1800,  
2500, 106, 108 and there didn't seem to be problem?

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Panel Plugin for Custom Reader
Message-ID: <DE050D05-EF4D-4627-AB19-CFCE6397E4A6@gmail.com>

I would like to write a custom object panel for my custom reader so  
that I can display some information from the file and allow the user  
to do things like select the VOI and such. I read the wiki pages and  
got an idea what where to start. From there I proceeded to look  
through the ParaView source, specifically at the XDMF reader since it  
has a custom panel associated with it. I think I have most of the  
parts in place but the one connection that I am missing is how does  
ParaView know to display the pqXdmfPanel when the user selects an  
Xdmf file?

Thanks

The CMake macro for declaring an object panel generates the code to do that.
ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL(...)

Great that was easy.
   Next Question.  If I want a custom UI panel for a Reader I am
assuming I am going to need both a server and a client plugin?

You'll need both server and client side code in your plugin(s).
You can do it in one or two calls to ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(...),  
depending on your circumstances.

Native VTK and ParaView file formates like vtk legacy files 
have no support for multiblock datasets. However you can try 
VTK-XML multi-block data file format :

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader.html

Or as Berk suggested you can use Plot3D or Ensight file formats 
which have good support for Multi-block datasets.

What would be a good example to look at in order to get an idea of

Mike,

If it is working, then there's no need for me to scare you any more...but...

In the old days the chain of events used to go like this...
You have some data on disk that is {0,3N}, {0,...} big along each axis, 
but you load a VOI that is {0,N} along each axis, all is well, you set 
the whole extent to {0,N} and we are happy. Then the user changes the 
VOI to {N,2N} and the update extent gets set to that - but the whole 
extent is smaller and has not been updated - a call to Request 
Information was needed between you changing the VOI and the update 
extent being set. I suspect this extra call now happens so the WholeExt 
is set after you changed VOI and the UpExt is now inside it.

anyway...if it ain't broke..don't fix it. I have trouble of my own 
convincing this Xdmf reader to load pieces of imagedata in parallel 
properly and set the extents and bounds right. It is loading the pieces 
as expected, but the boxes on screen are only part of the data.....

Subject: [Paraview] Meta Image Save Bug
Message-ID: <1202992731.5835.15.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I think there is a bug that prevents ParaView3 from saving an image in
the meta image format and causes ParaView to exit. All I did was attempt
to save an image from the wavelet source in Meta Image(*.mhd) format.
When I click 'OK' after entering the file name ParaView exits, and I get
the following output:

ERROR: In /home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1008
vtkProcessModule (0x70ce20): Object type: vtkMetaImageWriter, could not find requested method: "SetFileType"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = id_value {321}
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetFileType}
  Argument 2 = int32_value {2}



ERROR: In /home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1009
vtkProcessModule (0x70ce20): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.

This is actually simple to fix. In the filters xml
(Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml), ParticleTracer says it
is expecting a vtkTemporalDataSet input. However, in some cases, the
input may look like a vtkUnstructuredGrid, for example. The input type
for ParticleTracer should be set to vtkDataObject to fix this. I am
attaching a patch. I am not sure this is the best way to fix this in
the main repository so I am not committing it yet.

Thank you for looking into this!

We've already deployed a patched ParaView 3.2.1 (changes to
rendering.xml to enable the activation of shading via the python
interface) to a whole lab of machines.  Is there perhaps any other
work-around that does not involve having to deploy a new build?  Could
we somehow force a cast on the data or something?

Thanks again,
Charl

Berk / Charl

I had a quick play this morning and then got involved with other work so 
didn't fix it. I shall attend to this problem very soon, once I've 
finished off data preparation, I need to use the code right away and I'm 
also planning
1) Optimizing the FindCell stuff to use spatial locators for 
unstructured data
2) Improve and clean up the Cell Cache stuff for static/dynamic meshes
3) Multi-threading the main particle trace so I can use all 4 cpus on 
these quad core processors
4) Doing particle going backwards in time from seed points at the (time) 
end of the data
5) Adding interpolation methods for using particle data as the vector 
field. No cells to do findcell on.
6) Other stuff I can't remember
7) Tidy up and rename class to vtkParticleTracer (even though I prefer 
all the temporal stuff to be vtkTemporalSomething)

Awesome! I feel the same way about (7) but I don't think
vtkTemporalStreamTracer will make sense to users. What about
vtkTemporalParticleTracer?

It's actually a path-line isn't it, at least according to the
documentation?  Why not call it vtkTemporalPathLine?  (although that's
a bit redundant and all)

First of all, I am new on the mailing list, so I am not sure if I should 
reply to you directly. If not , please instruct on the right procedure.
my current need is to be able to load in paraview both an unstructured 
mesh (which contains my usefull data) and a STL representing
a geometric description. My application use level sets with ficticious 
domains and I have no way to represent the geometry than loading separately
the STL. I would like to describe in the same VTU both the computation 
domain and the surface which describe the geometry, and at a secondary
objective be able to map the data attached to my main mesh (pressure, 
temperature...) to my STL surface.

Hope this clarify the application.
thanks in advance

Subject: [Paraview] CMake Parameter Ignored
Message-ID: <47B49431.3050309@psc.edu>

Building ParaView 3.2.1 fails because CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS is ignored. make 
was asked to be verbose and the output from a link is attached. From 
CMakeCache.txt:

CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-Wl,-L/usr/local/packages/mvapich2/lib -Wl,-rpath 
-Wl,/usr/local/packages/mvapich2/lib -Wl,-L/usr/lib64 -Wl,-lrdmacm 
-Wl,-libverbs -Wl,-libumad -Wl,-lpthread -Wl,-lrt

None of those parameters are included in the link. Using cmake 2.4.6 and g++ 
4.1.2 on CentOS 5.

TIA!

I think I am getting my plugin built but I have no idea if it is  
getting loaded in PV. I have PV from CVS built and I launch PV. I go  
to "Manage Plugins" and try to "load" my plugin. After a short wait I  
get an empty dialog box with an "OK" button. But nothing shows in the  
list. I even tried building the "Prism" plugin and got no joy there  
also.
   I am sure I am missing something simple. Might someone be able to  
tell me what is wrong?

Thanks

Message-ID: <b05971d10802142313s740b70f2g266c1146dbb9ec3e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys

I have a paraview userguide versioned 2.4, and i have downloaded the latest,
compiled and build the 3.2.1. The book and the software its quite different,
and I was thinking of using tcl scripting but I could not find any button in
the 3.2.1, it has pyhton shell. Does that mean, I have to download the older
version, or am I missing something, wer can i find the older version of
Paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] Smoothing unstructured grid
Message-ID: <1dfc11660802150144y2be8988fx9e499468da7c85fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I recently switched from MayaVi to Paraview (and I am glad I did).
I have a 3D unstructured grid and everything works perfect in Paraview. I
also managed to solve an 'Extract Cells' problem.

Until a new issue came up. Instead of plotting the facets of my 3D
hexahedral mesh, I would like a smooth surface. In MayaVi I could (and still
can) do that by applying the filter 'PolyDataNormals'. I checked the web and
I found out that in Paraview exists the filter 'Smooth'. However, in my case
it is de-activated (as the filter 'Normals'). Any ideas why? Should I apply
some other filter first in order to activate it?

I appreciate any help,
Dimitris

Subject: [Paraview] pqPythonShell on local server & local client
Message-ID: <iss.9c0ac906.798b.47b574f3.38e5b.df@mailout.lrz-muenchen.de>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to make a toolbar button which will do exactly the same as clicking 'Tools->Python Shell->Run Script'. I have a local server running, with a local client process GUI attached to it. Into that GUI I load a plugin with my toolbar, which has a button for running python scripts. The problem arises when I try to tie a PythonShell (without a PythonShellDialog) to my server. The PythonShell-constructor needs a QWidget*, and I think I should supply it with a pointer at the MainWindow (but I don't know, documentation on this is slim). Pointers at MainWindows can be retrievied through ProcessModuleGUIHelpers, but I can only create a new ProcessModuleGUIHelper, not get the one in charge of my currently running GUI.

I think the significant lines of code are these:

  ProcessModuleGUIHelper* gui = ProcessModuleGUIHelper::New() //Problem: This creates a NEW ParaView-Process instead of connecting to the one that's currently running
  pqPythonShell* py = new pqPythonShell(gui->getMainWindow()); //I'd like to connect a new PythonShell to my process like this


It is strange that a pqPythonShell needs a QWidget* for initialization; This contradicts the seperation of core functionality and GUI.

Can anybode tell me how to properly attach a PythonShell to a (local) server?


Thanks in advance,
Alex

P.S.: The entire source code for my toolbar is as follows:

#ifndef __paToolbar_h
#define __paToolbar_h

#include

{

paToolbar(QObject* p) : QActionGroup(p)
   {
     // Using a Qt icon somehow depicting that there should be another icon there
     QIcon icon = qApp->style()->standardIcon(QStyle::SP_MessageBoxCritical);
     QAction* a = new QAction(icon, "Open & silently run a script in the python shell", this);
     this->addAction(a);
     QObject::connect(this, SIGNAL(triggered(QAction*)), this, SLOT(onAction(QAction*)));
   }

public slots:
void onAction(QAction* a)
   {
     pqServerManagerModel* sm = pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel();
     QList servers = sm->findItems();
     if(servers.size()) // Now I could easly retrieve a pqServer*
       {
	 ProcessModuleGUIHelper* gui = ProcessModuleGUIHelper::New()
	 QWidget* mwnd = gui->GetMainWindow();
	 a->setData(QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(mwnd, "Run script", "","Python Scripts (*.py)"));
	 if(a->data())
	   {

I don't know why I had trouble yesterday, but as Berk says, it should be 
vtkDataObject as input not vtkTemporalDataset - and when I put this in, 
I was able to do particle tracing on a volume (vtkImageData) dataset. 
(Didn't try the LEA one, but it's safe to assume it'll work).

For those that care - vtkTemporalDataset should not generally be 
imported directly by a filter, instead the filter should request 
multiple time steps and let the executive create the temporal wrapper. 
We have one use case (referred to in my xdmf post which causes trouble, 
but we'll fix that eventually).

We switched from Tcl to Python in ParaView 3. If you want to  use Tcl
scripting, you have to download 2.6 which can be found here:
http://paraview.org/files/v2.6/ If you want to use Python scripting,

John,

Did you try what happens if you connect a source that doesn't support
time? I didn't want to commit a fix without checking that. We should
probably add support to paraview to detect a dataset that has time in
it. This is already done for sources/readers and can be expanded to
any algorithm. If you want, post a request in the bug tracker and I'll
look into it in a few weeks.

Berk

Good point. I forgot all about that. We should add a check. The trouble 
is, how does the pv gui know that ParticleTracer needs time? Detecting 
the output is easy becuase the filter already exists and stesp can be 
queried, but the input is only declared in the XML as input <dataobject> 
- do we have to add an XML flag to say Input requirements point vectors, 
dataobject and Time steps?

I'll add the bug/feature request

You have to extract to surface before you can apply any filters that
work on polygonal data. I can't remember the name by heart, probably
something like "Extract Surface" or Geometry...

I think a flag or maybe a new domain is best.

Thanks Berk,

I did work, but not quite...
2 problems actually:
a) I can still see the facets and not just one surface (even though smoother
now)
b) My volume has faces (let's say like a cube). So when you apply 'Smooth'
the edges between these faces get smoothened out. Like in subdivision
surfaces.

In MayaVi the behavior was different. I end up seeing just smooth surfaces,
while all edges stay as they are.
Any ideas?

Sounds like a graphics driver issue. Which system are you on? Which graphics

 pipeline browser is not updated
Message-ID: <4884.71.179.225.195.1203085541.squirrel@webmail.cis.jhu.edu>

Hello,

I have written a subclass of vtkPolyDataAlgorithm, that has a dynamic
number of output ports. When the number of output ports are hard coded
into the constructor the pipeline browser in the paraview application
displays the correct number of output ports. But when the number of output
ports are changed outside the constructor the paraview pipeline browser is
not updated.

How does one force an update the paraview pipeline browser when the number
of output ports has changed, from inside a subclass of
vtkPolyDataAlgorithm outside of the constructor?

Thanks,

-Joe

Hi Joe,

ParaView does not support dynamically adjusting the number of ports.
This is actually strongly discouraged for VTK 5.0 and never. The
"blessed" way of producing variable number of output datasets is to
use a multi-block dataset. Unfortunately, there are certain things you
can't do with multi-block dataset (such as selection and using the
spreadsheet view). We have been working hard on making the multi-block
support better and closing the gap between single datasets and

Subject: [Paraview] pqPythonShell on local server & local client

I don't think you want to give your pqPythonShell the main window, unless 
you're using a QDialog, and pqPythonShell is not a QDialog.
Just pass in NULL as the parent of your pqPythonShell, or another QWidget you 
make yourself.

If you need the GUI Helper, you can do
vtkProcessModule::GetProcessModule()->GetGUIHelper();

Not sure if you received a reply, so here is mine.
* There is a reload function in ParaView 3.2.1 for Exodus files. Scroll down to the bottom of the Exodus reader Properties panel.
* I believe that this has to be built into the reader for each file type.  (Or, there has to be a side effect available, as you list below).  I would not be surprised to see a refresh button appear for CTH soon.  Other than that, I don't know of any plans to add refresh buttons across the board for ParaView.

Hello,
I would have the same request, a reload button would be very convenient !

Hello
I use paraview for a very long time now. It's a great tool.
BUT: why I there's no reload button?
In paraview version <3.x a simple trick could be performed by renaming the "input source file" within paraview twice to gain the reload effect.
In paraview 3.x this is not possible any more.
1. Maybe you can think about that option in near future (I don't think that I and my 10 co-wprkers are the only ones who need such option).
2. Is there any way to reload a file without setting up all the filters again? BTW the "Change input..." option is senseless for this purpose...
Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Error Building PV 3.2.1 with VS2003.net
Message-ID: <43a689850802151327j2bf52bd5y568608e51d50139b@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to build PV 3.2.1 and I am getting the following error:

"This application has failed to start because Xdmf.dll was not found.
Re-installing the application may fix this problem"

I get this when the build is "Creating Documentation for ParaViewWriters"

Is there a solution for this? I am attaching my CMakeCache.txt file.
Generally all is the default EXCEPT I am using my own build of HDF5
(version 1.6.6).

thanks

Ok. I'll reply to myself on this.. I got the following link errors

problem;

Seems that Xdmf could not find one of the xml libraries maybe?

Thanks

Did you ever get past this problem? It could be that you have another
directory of VTK dlls in your PATH (other than the ones built with ParaView)
and the incorrect ones are being loaded.

Or there could be some incorrect (mismatched from one obj to another)
compiler flags somewhere along the way...

Did you do anything funky with CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS or one of its _DEBUG/_RELEASE
variants when you configured...?

David,

Yes, I got around it. It was a mismatch of dll's I am using vs2008 and
vs2005 and I used version of Qt compiled with vs2005. When I compiled a
version of Qt with vs2008 as well and matched it with the paraview vs2008
it worked fine.

Subject: [Paraview] Can not configure PV3 CVS (WinXP, PV 3 CVS)
Message-ID: <43a689850802161257vb90737v853fb2e03572fbd@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to run CMake on the ParaView 3 CVS source tree. CMake
makes it part way through then I get an error about something trying
to set CMAKE_X_LIBS variable and how that is a bad thing. This is on
Windows XP, CMake 2.4.7 and generating VS 2003.Net project files.

I was compiling PV 3.2.1 earlier and didn't seem to have this problem.
Anyone have any idea? I checked out PV from CVS this afternoono.

I was also getting an error that CMake could not delete some of its
temporary files (cmTryCompile.exe). I let those errors go and now I
get this error.

Thanks for any help.

Here is the error message:

CMake Error: An Attempt was made to access a variable: CMAKE_X_LIBS
that has not been defined. Some variables were always defined by CMAKe
in versions prior to 1.6. To Fix thie you might need to set the cache
value of CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY to 1.4 or less. If you are
writing a CMakeList.txt file then you probably need to include a CMake
module to test for the feature this variable defines.

Thanks for any help.

Hi,

  I have been trying to build Paraview3 from the CVS head and keep
getting an error with "pvdataserver".

  The specific linkage error is about "relocation overflow"

  An example of the error is this

/usr/bin/ld: /Users/nicholas/projects/paraview_cvs/build/bin/libXdmf.a(XdmfExprLex.o)
relocation overflow for relocation entry 1 in section
(__TEXT,__StaticInit) (displacement too large)

  Any advice or idea?

Regards

Hi guys


I tried animating in paraview 2.6 and it works fine ( well except setting
the delay stuff ), but anyway, how do I get it to work in paraview 3.2.1, my
files are named "filename800-001.vtp", filename800-002.vtp.... and so on,
should i rite a xml file ? In paraview 2.6, its automatically recognised.

Try turning BUILD_SHARED_LIBS on. We should really make that the default.

Message-ID: <c84c3d370802170912j17cb0715uc8d367cc52abe880@mail.gmail.com>

I had a previous post looking for help with a stream tracing problem.
I sent some data to Berk and he said that my problem lies with my
grid. He said: "I am seeing problems with the way you wrote this mesh.
It looks like you are creating duplicate points or something like
that. The mesh is not "water-tight". When you load it in paraview,
change the representation to wireframe. This is supposed to show only
the external surfaces as wireframe. Instead, it shows a lot of
internal boundaries."

I ditched my VTK output routine and adopted some functions that have
been successfully used to create OpenDX files. With this routine I
shouldn't have any issues with duplicate points, etc. With the new
routine I am having the same problem with my mesh. I am wondering if
my problem could have anything to do with the following:

My grid is cartesian and unstructured (vtk cell type 11). There are 6
sides per cell, but it is possible to have more than 6 neighbouring
cells. I attached a picture to show what I mean. I would think this is
a common thing with unstructured cartesian grids, but I am starting to
scrape the bottom of the barrel here and I am wondering if anyone
thinks this could be a problem.

Has anyone been successful in implementing my type of grid in ParaView before?

You have XML format .vtp files, so following steps should work for you.

1. Creat .pvd file pointing your file series like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep=" 1 " part="001" file="filename1.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 10 " part="001" file="filename2.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 20 " part="001" file="filename3.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 30 " part="001" file="filename4.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 40 " part="001" file="filename5.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 50 " part="001" file="filename6.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 60 " part="001" file="filename7.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 70 " part="001" file="filename8.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 80 " part="001" file="filename9.vtp" name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 90 " part="001" file="filename10.vtp"
name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
<DataSet timestep=" 100 " part="001" file="filename11.vtp"
name="Asmb:FRAME"/>
</Collection>
</VTKFile>

2. Then just open .pvd file and hit play button on animation bar.

However, if you have legacy VTK files, here is the excellent explanation:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series

Good luck!

Hi,

when using paraview 3.2.1 I have problems while reading series of files. 
E.g. when trying to read a file series file_xxx.vtu only the first 
object/file in the series will be read.

The same thing is happening while trying to read an image stack 
image_xxx.png. I need to read the whole stack at once, which was 
perfectly working with older paraview versions (3.0.1).

What I am doing wring?

Thank you for your help,

Message-ID: <iss.bb8178fe.3d97.47b98a21.692f6.47@mailout.lrz-muenchen.de>

Hi Clint,


I'm now retrieving the handle on the main window through the vtkProcessModule. Thanks for the hint!
The QWidget*-argument of the pqPythonShell does, as you said, not tell the shell where to actually execute its scripts. The problem that, no matter what I specify as the constructor argument to pqPythonShell, executing a script with the created object just does nothing on any server. The pqPythonShell seems not to be tied to any server, but I need it to run scripts just like the Tools->Phython Shell-Dialog of the GUI would. Do you know how to make that connection?


Regards,
Alex

Stefan,

The idea of a hexahedron having more than 6 neighbors is not allowed.  The mesh example you gave is one that is not "conforming" (or not consistent depending on your nomenclature).  Many VTK algorithms, including stream tracing, require your mesh to be conforming.  There are multiple problems that occur with non-conforming meshes.  As Berk mentioned, the mesh tends not to be "water-tight."  That is, it is not reasonable to represent 3 collinear points exactly in finite precision numbers.  The edge represented by 2 nodes and the edges with 3 nodes usually do not match up perfectly, leading to "cracks" in the mesh.

The second large problem is that connectivity is ill-defined.  In your example, is the large cell really a neighbor with the two smaller cells?  They do not actually share faces.  The large cell has a face connecting the top and bottom nodes.  The other two cells each have a face with the middle node.  What if you moved that middle node a little to the right?  You would no longer consider these neighbors, right?  That would be a geometric change, not a topological change.  The connectivity should be based entirely on the topology.  Trying to introduce geometric position into the connectivity computations opens a Pandora's box of problems.

In short, VTK does not, and cannot, consider these mismatched faces neighbors.  In the case of the stream tracer, if the stream reaches one of these interfaces, it will assume that the stream left the mesh and terminate that stream.

Thanks a lot for clarifying that for me. I'm glad I know what the
problem is, even though this is going to be a tough one to resolve.

I can only see 2 solutions. The first one would involve combining
cells (and/or splitting cells) to avoid the problem. This would be
very tricky to do, and even if it was possible it would increase
output time and likely data size.

Option 2 is sort of a hail mary. Is there anyway I can output my data
points as the cell center co-ordinates and have ParaView generate a
grid from this?

I have read a few posts about people successfully importing scattered
points, but I'm not sure how to do this, or if I would be able to
incorporate stream tracing.

Hi everyone,

I am finding some problems when trying to convert my three column  
ASCII data (XYZ) into vtk format. I know I have to define poligones  
and normals but I don't really know how. Is there any program that  
converts general raw data files to vtk files? If not, any advice on  
how to get the poligones and normals would be very appreciated. Thank  
you very much in advance for your help.

To be honest, I am not much of a programmer, and I would rather not
get into the guts of ParaView. Also, it would be preferable for me and
my group to use a stable release version of ParaView.

Is there anything I can do with scattered points? Since this is how my
data is stored in my program, it would be very desirable for me.

Is your data just points in space? And you want to show those points  
in ParaView?

I might be inclined to try an unstructured grid with only VTK_VERTEX  
as cell types.

<http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf>  may help you figure out  
what to write. Page 4 explains about the UnstructuredGrid format,  
while there is an example starting at the bottom of page 8.

Does anyone on the list have a plugin for 3D Delaunay triangulation?

Delaunay triangulation is a straightforward (although often slow) way to add connectivity to a collection of points.  VTK has a 3D Delaunay triangulation filter, but it is not exposed in ParaView.  Perhaps it should be.  I think this issue has come up before.

Stefan, you say you are not much of a programmer, but a more ideal solution would be to triangulate (that is, break into tetrahedra) your hexahedra so that the faces match up properly.  You have not described how this mesh is created, but you might have some auxiliary knowledge that makes the meshing problem easier.

Hi,

Is there a way to assign colors based on the sideset ID read from an exodus 
file? Paraview is aware of the sideset IDs, but I can't figure out how to use 
them to color faces. Can this be done?

Thanks,

Kevin Long

I'm not sure how triangulating my mesh will solve my problem of
unconnected nodes - unless all the nodes are connected somehow in the
process?

I can't picture how this would be done in my CFD program, but I am
certainly willing to give the Delaunay 3D filter a shot. I received
the plugin from Jean Favre, but I'm not sure how to install it. The
file types in his .tar file are not listed in the Tools->Manage
Plugins application.

I am assuming that John Biddiscombe's method of modifying the
filters.xml file will involve modifying the open source code and
compiling ParaView? Is the result of the compilation a windows
installer file, or just an application?

the tar file includes all the files necessary to compile the plugin (xml
files + Cmake file). You must untar that file into a directory where you
will compile the plugin

The triangulation, if done properly, will resolve the interface problem by splitting up any face that spans several other faces.  In the attached image I modified your simple example to show a triangulation that would fix the problem.

You need to compile the plugin.  That will create a .dll or .so that you can then load as a plugin.

Just an application, usually.  You might be able to pack everything into an installer file, but do you need to?

Message-ID: <47B9E591.3010409@psc.edu>

I've tried compiling 3.2.1 with HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL on and off. When on the 
XDMF reader just runs and runs, eating CPU time. When off things work well.

The XDMF file uses 8 HDF files and I used 2 processors. Its a CENTOS 5 system 
with MPICH2 from Argonne.

Has anyone else tried "parallel" HDF5?

Ken,

Thanks for the suggestion, however, I tried that. The object gets colored by 
block ID, not side set ID. 

The only thing I've made work so far is to read in only a single side set, 
disabling the reading of everything else. I'd prefer to read the entire data 
set, then somehow color by side set.

Yeah this would be nice.

But a reload button should be an easy one, because there?s no difference
between reloading a file or proceed to the next time step! The only
difference is that the filename is still the same!

So a reload button is nice to have feature..

Not sure if you received a reply, so here is mine.

* There is a reload function in ParaView 3.2.1 for Exodus files. Scroll down
to the bottom of the Exodus reader Properties panel.

* I believe that this has to be built into the reader for each file type.
(Or, there has to be a side effect available, as you list below).  I would
not be surprised to see a refresh button appear for CTH soon.  Other than
that, I don't know of any plans to add refresh buttons across the board for
ParaView.

Hello

I use paraview for a very long time now. It's a great tool.

BUT: why I there's no reload button?

In paraview version <3.x a simple trick could be performed by renaming the
"input source file" within paraview twice to gain the reload effect.

In paraview 3.x this is not possible any more.

1. Maybe you can think about that option in near future (I don't think that
I and my 10 co-wprkers are the only ones who need such option).

2. Is there any way to reload a file without setting up all the filters
again? BTW the "Change input..." option is senseless for this purpose...

Jean,

I've been trying to compile your plugin with CMake, but I am getting the error:

"CMake Error: ParaView_DIR is not set. It must be set to the directory
containing ParaViewConfig.cmake in order to use ParaView."

I have never used CMake before - Do you have the compiled .dll or .so
file for the plugin?

I attached the plugin files in case any CMake users on the list would
like to compile this for me.

The python code is executed on the client side.  Any interaction with a server 
is done with the servermanager module.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:pvpython

Perhaps you're calling pqPythonShell::executeScript with the filename, instead 
of the python code itself?  Unless I see some code, I'm only guessing.

In ParaView CVS, if the XDMF file has a single UniformGrid, the reader
will return the appropriate vtkDataSet type. This was changed post 3.2
release.

the procedure documented on the Wiki assumes prior knowledge of Cmake,
and assumes that you have compiled your own version of ParaView from the
source code distribution.
?
The error above comes up the first time you run cmake while its internal
variables are not set. While using Cmake, you should put in the path to
the directory where you have previoulsy build ParaView. After that, the
configuration can complete, and the Makefile gets generated.
?
Looks however, like you have never done any of this. First step, check
the wiki, compile your own Paraview. Once done with that, you may get to
the second step of adding pluggins.
?

Message-ID: <47BA2DDF.8070807@will.brl.ntt.co.jp>

Hi

I want to write a plugin for Paraview to manipulate the data Paraview
has opened.
It will be mostly ImageData or PolyData but I would like to understand
the general idea how to do it.
Im using C++ so the code i have figured out by now looks like that:

#Getting the active source
pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
pqServerManagerSelection sels = *core->getSelectionModel()->selectedItems();
pqPipelineSource* source = 0;
pqServerManagerModelItem* item = 0;
pqServerManagerSelection::ConstIterator iter = sels.begin();
item = *iter;
source = dynamic_cast<pqPipelineSource*>(item);

#Trying to access the data of the source.
#Here I can access data information only, not raw-data
vtkPVDataInformation*
datainfo=source->getOutputPort(0)->getDataInformation(true);
cout << "PointsNumber " << datainfo->GetNumberOfPoints() << "\n";
cout << "DataClassName " << datainfo->GetDataClassName() << "\n";

It all works but its just data information.
I would like to access a function like GetData or GetDataArray to be
able to read the data contained in the VTK object. To read/write
directly from/to the data array. The problem is that I cant find a
suitable function in any of the classes like pqPipelineSource,
vtkPVDataInformation etc.
What should I do ?

I would be thankful for any help,
Paraview user

You probably want to write a Filter plugin for ParaView. Look on the  
Wiki for more information.

Hi guys



I am trying to compile paraview with ffmpeg, but I keep getting errors. This
is what I have done

a)      I downloaded the ffmpeg_source.tar.gz from the paraview-kitware
website

b)      I ran the following command



./configure --disable-vhook --disable-static --disable-network
--disable-zlib --disable-ffserver --disable-ffplay --disable-decoders
--enable-shared ?prefix=/tmp/ffmpeg_inst



mkdir /tmp/ffmpeg_inst

make install



and



c)      I set these variables as told in the README file



  VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER:BOOL=ON

  FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/tmp/ffmpeg_inst/include/

  FFMPEG_avcodec_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/tmp/ffmpeg_inst/lib/libavcodec.so

  FFMPEG_avformat_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/tmp/ffmpeg_inst/lib/libavformat.so

Thank you for you help. I checked the filter plugin description and the 
examples but I think thats not what I want. At least I cant figure out 
how I can use it to read the raw data through the client. The code I 
posted in the previous mail is already a part of a plugin which shows a 
toolbar with buttons in Paraview client. Clicking on a button should pop 
up a window with the point coordinates of all points of the selected 
source. Thats the aim but now it only shows the number of points and the 
vtk class name "vtkImageData". Since these informations are already on 
the client there must be a simple way to get also all the point 
coordinates/point data of that vtkImageData class. How to do it ?

You're best bet is to step through the code and find out what is going 
wrong. Have you tested a reduced hdf5 parallel app to see if all is ok 
outside of vtk/paraview. I'm waiting for our viz cluster to have GPFS 
installed before playing with the HDF5_PARALLEL options again so I can't 
help just now. Hopefully just a few weeks away......

I am trying to visualise combination of 3D objects and point data. The

visualise point data as different 3D objects? I mean not only colored

My next question is, whether is somewhere on the net a repository of
Paraview filters.

Subject: [Paraview] XYRepresentationPlot
Message-ID: <20080219121437.GA5670@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

The bible (Servermanager2) says:

" Although it is possible to create representations and views directly by
instantiating their class objects, we recommend not doing it. Not all 
views work with all connections types and not all representations work 
with all view types. " 

Ok, how can I do if I want to do a XY plot? All I could see seems to 
be for 3D. I figure I should start with something like that:

plot=servermanager.rendering.XYPlotRepresentation()
plot.SetPropertyWithName('Input',filter)

then I add a view

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

and now I want to do what thu shall no do, using the XYPlotRep to
see my results. How should I link the view to the represention (the
data are in the filter if I'm right)? Can someone help me?

Olivier.

Subject: [Paraview] animated BarChart
Message-ID: <47BACDB5.4040307@gmx.de>

Hello ParaView Users,

Is it possible to modify
View->ObjectInspector->Display(BarChart)->Y-Axis->ArrayName
using View->AnimationView to create an animated BarChart?

Why I need that:
I read my plain CSV-Data (comma-seperated-file), which creates a 1D
rectangle grid. Each column in my file gets added as cell-data-array
with the name "Field0", "Field1" , etc. Each field is an output of a
property at a certain time.

Now I can display this arrays in a BarChart, through the "Display"-Tab
of the Object Inspector. To see how the field changes over time I need
to change the array name.

Does anyone has an idea how to do that... (or how to script it)?

Greetings
Jens

Hi together,
I have a question about the import of AVS files:
Which time dependent AVS-files (of course UCD) can be read from paraview?
I tried the example from the AVS manual
http://www-vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/express/help6.2/help/reference/dvmac/T
ime0060.htm
and it doesn't work. Is it only possible to read AVS files in the binary
format?
Or can I read a set of AVS files (at different times) with 'Load state'?
Thanks for answering!
Martin

ObjectId should contain unique ids for all "objects" (blocks and sets).

On review, I see that blocks and sets can share the same ids.  You might have to load all the blocks in one exodus reader and all the sets in another reader to get unique colors for blocks and sets.  But in the reader with the sets, the sets will be correctly numbered.

If the blocks and sets have different numbering (which is determined by the data in the Exodus file), than this should not be an issue.

Use the glyph filter.

Hi Olivier,

None of the plotting (bar charts, line charts) views are available

Thanks! I can stop to look the web :) 

I've founded something which let me think I can do it with vtk 
library of python. Is it right or should I give up?

Just a guess:

vtkImageData* datainfo = vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get 
(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

VTK has plotting support. You can certainly use vtkpython and run python 
scripts to create plots. ParaView decided to use Qt for plotting rather 
than using VTK's OpenGL based plotting framework. But you can surely use 
vtk and it's python wrappings for plotting by itself, independent of 
ParaView.

As you have discovered, there is no direct access to the actual 
vtkDataObject on the client side. This is because paraview supports 
server configurations in which the data processing server may be in 
another process. In that case one cannot directly access the data on the 
client side, since the data is never delivered in its entirety to the 
client.

I tried to compile some of the plugin examples from ParaView 3 CVS  
and I can not seem to get any of them to load. I checked that the  
plugins are in the proper directory but they do not show up in the  
list of plugins to load? Any one have any ideas?

Hey Mike,

So, do you mean that after compilation is over the new plugin  
libraries are in the build/bin directory, but when you do Tools ->  
Manage Plugins... -> (Local Plugins) Load, they do not show up as  
choices in the file picker?

Correct. I even copied them into the .app package into Contents/ 
Plugins/*" and relaunched ParaView but still nothing is listed. I did  
browse and select the ConePanel plugin and then I just just an empty  
dialog with an "OK" button. This is all on OS X 10.4.11 Intel with  
Xcode 2.5 toolset and CMake 2.4.7.

Hmm...

I've had trouble in the past getting ParaView to auto-load plugins,  
but they've always shown up in the Manage Plugins window, at least...  
The GUIConePanel works okay for me, as well as a couple VTK classes  
I've exposed to ParaView as plugins.

I think my build environment is too different to make a good  
comparison -- OS X 10.5.2 Intel with Xcode 3.0 tools and CMake 2.5 -  
20080215. Sorry I don't have a machine set up with 10.4 any more to  
try it out. There should be someone out there, though, who could at  
least try building the Examples and let you know if it's working for  
them.

I have installed CMake, and Qt 4.3.3 from the file
qt-win-opensource-4.3.3-mingw. MinGW was installed with Qt. I obtained
the source code for ParaView3.2.1.

When I try to run CMake for Visual Studio 9, 2008 it says that Qt is
not found, specifically asking me to check the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE
variable. I set this to C:\Qt\4.3.3\bin, but I get the same error.

Is there anything else I have to do with Qt? I ran "configure
-platform win32-g++" and added C:\Qt\4.3.3\bin to PATH and still get
the same error.

Try to set the path to qmake: C:\Qt\4.3.3\bin\qmake. At least this 
worked for my compilation of Paraview under Linux ..

Not sure on windows but I don't think you can actually mix a MinGW Qt  
with a Visual Studio 9 ParaView. All the code most probably has to be  
from the same compiler.

Also, in the CMakeSetup GUI, there should be an entry for  
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE. Edit the entry to point to your Qt 4 qmake  
executable, C:\Qt\4.3.3\bin\qmake.

You will probably have to recompile Qt with VS 9 first.

Also,
Try removing the very first line:

from the file. the vtk reader probably will not like that line,

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin for TIFF Writer
Message-ID: <47BB13D3.40303@gmx.de>

Hi,

adding Plugins to Paraview works fine for new Filters and Readers, but I 
have problems when trying to add a Writer (vtkTIFFWriter.*).

The SERVER_MANAGER_XML - TiffWriter.xml- "activates" the existing vtk 
class (vtkTIFFWriter). I also wrote the files pqTiffWriter.xml and 
pqTiffWriter.qrc for the GUI.

The Plugin compiles, but when I load image data in Paraview and want to 
save it as .tif file, no plugin appears when calling "Save data". The 
TiffWriter.xml file is defined very similiar to the paraview png writer 
so I don't understand why this is not working.

Thank you for your help.

Enkelejda

Not sure since I always build from source. Point is that you need to  
have BOTH Qt and ParaView built with the SAME compiler. Period.

So.. download the source code version of Qt.
If you want to use Qt versions newer than 4.2.3 with ParaView you  
will need to edit a line in a CmakeLists.txt file that checks for  
that version.

Then build Qt with VS 9
Install Qt
Build PV 3.x

Is it possible to build with MinGW instead of VS? I was successful in
generating a mingw Makefile with CMake, however I'm not sure what

Sorry, nevermind the last. mingw32-make seems to be doing something,
if that doesn't work I will go the VisualStudio route. Thanks.

You loaded both plugins through Tools -> Manage Plugins?
And when you do "save data" you still don't see "tif" in the file types in the 
file dialog?

Do you not get an error when you manually load the plugin?

Do you see your plugins when you open the plugin manager (Tools -> Manage 
Plugins)?
What version of ParaView are you using?

Subject: [Paraview] Warning: ExtractGrid and MultiGroup Datasets
Message-ID: <47BB3B4B.2050603@psc.edu>

Bug 5808 reported on 9/30/2007 that ExtractGrid puts the extracted piece at the 
wrong location. I just discovered that when it is used with a 256-part 
multigroup dataset, where each part is image data, it puts ALL 256 extracted 
pieces at the same location.

One symptom was that the resultant picture seemed to have NxN points but 
"Information" said it had 256xNxN points.

I suggest the priority of this bug be raised. ExtractGrid is an important tool 
for looking at extremely large image datasets but it is currently useless.

Message-ID: <A0AC5C47-8464-40C6-8D84-AFD93B211021@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

With the recent changes to the Xdmf model (time inclusion) and the  
changes John Biddiscombe has been talking about making in VTK to the  
Xdmf reader & writer, have any of these advances been migrated over to  
ParaView CVS yet? (I'm not sure if it's just a matter of copying the  
code into the PV source tree, or if there's a lot more involved...)

Thanks,
-Eric

Check and see if /tmp/ffmpeg_inst has anything in it (and in
particular ffmpeg/avcodec.h).  I am guessing that you forgot to "make"
the ffmpeg library after you did the "configure ..." and before you
did "make install".

The only thing I get when I try to load the plugin is an empty dialog  
box with an "OK" button. I am not seeing anything in any of the  
standard log locations.

Such a solution would be great but I don't understand what you mean by 
"outInfo". Do you mean the "datainfo" of type vtkPVDataInformation* from 
my example ? If so then I cant find there a method "Get" or any other 
with such a functionality.

Subject: [Paraview] Pavaview Scripting: creating objects in Paraview window
 (instead of an external "OpenGL" one)
Message-ID: <47BB7D37.7070607@web.de>

Hello,

I'm gotten my hands on the "Paraview Scripting with Python" doc and I'm 
working though the code examples. It seems to me that the objects that 
are created via the python "commands" are created in an external window 
and not inside Paraview itself (I prefer the latter). Is there a way to 
have objects created by a python script appear in the Paraview window?

Thanks,

- Olumide

Thank you for your reply. I think I shouldn't have used the word 
"directly". What I want is just 'any' access to the point data of the 
opened object. Even if I had to write both server and client plugin and 
send data by properties calls it would be ok. But by now I cant find any 
way to do it.

You can use a ClientDeliveryRepresentation to copy the data from the
server onto the client. See the Fetch module in paraview's python
wrapped client interface for an example.

Yeah, i did that too. I did ./configure, make and the make install. I
would just like to clarify something, where do I set the variables --
in the CMake command prompt or in the cmakecache file, are there any
difference. I modified the variable using the command prompt.

That looks very promising. Thank you. I have still a small problem - in
python it works nice but I cant manage to convert it to C++. The code
from Fetch function looks more or less like this:

gvd=rendering.ClientDeliveryRepresentationBase()
gvd.AddInput(input,"DONTCARE")
gvd.SetReductionType(1) #For me its vtkPolyData
gvd.UpdateVTKObjects()
gvd.Update()
return gvd.GetOutput()

In C++ I converted it into :

vtkSMClientDeliveryRepresentationProxy*
rep=vtkSMClientDeliveryRepresentationProxy::New(); //Thats probably not
right yet
rep->AddInput((vtkSMSourceProxy*)proxy, "DONTCARE");
rep->SetReductionType(1);
rep->UpdateVTKObjects();
rep->Update();
vtkPolyData* test=(vtkPolyData*)(rep->GetOutput());
cout << "ARRAYS " << test->GetPointData()->GetNumberOfArrays() << "\n";

//(proxy is of type vtkSMProxy* and represents the active source which
is of type vtkPolyData)

But it returns 0 as a number of arrays so the data has not been copied I
guess.
I suppose I should derive the ClientDeliveryRepresentation somehow from
gvd=rendering.ClientDeliveryRepresentationBase() but cant find a way to
do it. Im still new in Paraview and I dont understand yet well how the
representation system works.
Could you give me a small hint how to do it ?

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkMultiGroup... not part of ParaView CVS
Message-ID: <47BBD5D3.2090702@gmx.de>

Hi,

what happend to the vtkMultiGroup-classes? They are not part of the
paraview cvs-version anymore.

I am using the netCDF-reader vtkCSCSNetCDF which is based on
vtkMultiGroupAlgorithm - and therefor does not compile with the
cvs-version anymore.

Greetings
Jens

I had the same problem. You need Qt 4.3.3

Hi,

yes, I see the plugins in the plugin manager. I am using Paraview 3.2.1. 
Maybe I'm doing something wrong in the Server Manager xml (wrong proxy 
group, or something like that). I wrote the xml files based on the 
writers.xml and ParaViewWriters.xml provided by Paraview.

Does anyone have a working writer plugin for Paraview 3.2.*?

A couple of days ago, Utkarsh at Kitware checked in a major set of 
changes to the Composite data
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Composite_Data_Redesign
has the info.

The netCDF code you are using may need a few small tweaks. I suspect 
very few lines will need changing.

However, I'm in the middle of a project involving lots of hdf5 stuff so 
I won't be doing a cvs update for paraview for a week or so. Therfore I 
won't fix the netCDF code until then. If you want to have a crack at 
fixing the compile errors yourself, please send me patches. Either that 
or go back to using paraview from the day before the big commit was made 
by looking at the dashboard/cvs logs.

I've noticied this too, - (but not using the ExtractGrid filter). The 
trouble is that a piece of data (only image data, not unstructured) has 
the origin set to the real origin of the whoe data, and each piece has 
the same origin - when extracted, the extent is not the whole extent and 
tada... they go to the same place.

This is a use case where vtkMultiPieceDataSet would be useful as it 
would make it clear to filters like extract grid that this is a piece - 
and not some generic group/block data and something extra needs to be 
done - such as query the container for extra info about orgin offsets etc.

Of course this could be subsumed into multiblock data, but....

Hi,

I had the same problem with Qt 4.2.3 when I tried to compile the 3.3
CVS head with VS2008. It looks like it's been fixed after I pulled
this snippet from Qt4.3.3 and appended at around the line 85 of
paraview-qt-win-opensource-4.2.3/src/corelib/tools/qhash.h:

template <typename T1, typename T2> inline uint qHash(const QPair<T1, T2> &key)
{
    uint h1 = qHash(key.first);
    uint h2 = qHash(key.second);
    return ((h1 << 16) | (h1 >> 16)) ^ h2;
}

By the way, when I used Qt 4.3.3 instead, If I click the VCR Play
button it just grayed out and doesn't change to the Pause button. So I
have to play all the sequence of the animation until the end. I have
this problem also under Linux and Mac OS X 10.5.2 (Intel). Is this a
known issue, or does anyone have a solution?

Regards,
Takuya

What version of ParaView are you using? And did  you rename the file
to have a ".vtk" extension?

This should have been solved by a change to ParaView3/Qt/CMakeLists.txt on 2/18/2008.  Are you sure a clean build is not complaining about Qt 4.2?

Don't know. I can not seem to get to the paraview cvs server... oh  
wait there is goes.. just really slow this morning..?

Also, on a Side note. I must have missed the announcement (is there  
another ParaView mailing list?) from 2 days ago stating that ParaView  
3 CVS HEAD is not going to Qt 4.3.3....

If you use the python terminal that is built into paraview everything 
should show up correctly, the only thing you will have to learn is how 
to properly register items with the paraview proxy manager so that you 
can also use the items from the Qt interface. The manual you have should 
have a section on registering items.

I have tried several ways to get this working but nothing seems to be  
working. I have tried the following:

OS X 10.4.11
   Rebuild from scratch including rerunning cmake on a clean build  
directory. I enabled the "Examples" option, turned on Shared libs and  
built. Running from the Build tree none of the plugins want to load  
either directly from the build tree or if I move them to the  
"plugins" directory in the app bundle. This was build against Qt 4.3.3.

I then moved my Qt 4.3.3 build onto an OS X 10.5.2 machine and  
rebuilt ParaView using Xcode 3.0 and I get the same result. This is  
with CMake 2.4.7 on both machines.

Here is my configure line for Qt:

   /Users/Shared/OpenSource/qt-4.3.3-ub/configure -fast -prefix / 
Users/Shared/Toolkits/Qt-4.3.3-UBLib/ -no-framework -universal - 
release -shared

I know at some level this works because a co-worker has a mac mini  
(intel) with 10.5.2 on it and the plugins loaded ok for him.

I guess I can start from scratch with compiles of everything.. CMake,  
Qt, ParaView3..


Again, thanks for any assistance that can be lent.

I am at a loss as to why this is not working.I have attached the test  
file that loads on my machine. Unfortunately I can not test in  
windows at the moment. Maybe some one else can test this out and let  
us know. You should be able to load the file with the "VTK Legacy  
Reader".

Hi John,

I decided to move to XDMF+HDF5 ... after reading about these two.

On the VTK mailinglist (jan.25th) you mentioned that you are willing to
help implementing the TIME feature for XDMF. Do you know if there is any
further work on that, which is not yet part of ParaView CVS?

Greetings
Jens

Sorry to keep this thread going for so long, but I've been trying for
a couple of days to compile paraview in order to try the Delaunay3D
filter.

I've downloaded the "GPL'ed" source code for Qt4.2.3 so that I could
build it with VS 9 2008 and install it.

Then with CMake, I generated the (MS VS Solution) file name ParaView,
which I opened in VS9. I clicked on ALL_BUILD so that it was
highlighted, then from the "Build" menu I selected "Build ALL_BUILD".

After a couple of hours, the build stopped. Here are the last lines of
the output:

========== Build: 77 succeeded, 34 failed, 1 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========


There were 1.3 GB of files generated, but no paraview.exe. I've tried
it 3 times with identical results. Any ideas?

There were 34 build errors in your build. Find the first error and try
to figure out what went wrong.

Also, if you are building ParaView from CVS, then you need Qt 4.3.3
NOT qt 4.2.3.

You are correct. Instead of creating the representation manually, ask
the proxy manager to create it representation for you. That way the
things managed by the proxy will be created where they need to be and
initialized properly.

vtkSMProxyManager *pm = vtkSMObject::GetProxyManager();

vtkSMClientDeliveryRepresentationProxy *rep =
vtkSMClientDeliveryRepresentationProxy::SafeDownCast(pm->NewProxy("representations","ClientDeliveryRepresentation"));

Or something close to that.

The particular error you are getting means that when paraview is bring
compiled, it can not find the file
${FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR}/ffmpeg/avformat.h. This can happen if ffmpeg did
not compile and install properly, or if the setting of the variable
does not match the location of the file.

Either the command prompt or editing the Cache can work, but I
wouldn't recommend it. A better way to make settings is to use CMake's
UI to choose them interactively. To do that, run "ccmake ." in your
paraview build directory and run through the settings. When you change
a setting and configure, for example turning VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER
on, the UI will prompt you to for any any other settings that depend
on that choice, for instance FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIRECTORY. Running cmake
from the command prompt and editing the cache directly are better for
scripting and do not have as nice a mechanism to help make sure the
settings are sane. The UI also has tab completion, which is
particularly helpful to make sure that the directory you are setting
exists. So make sure to choose the include directory in the ffmpeg
install tree, and not the include/ffmpeg directory, also make sure
that the file avformat.h exists in the include/ffmpeg directory.

About the svn thingy, I would not recommend it. Since I put that copy
of the the ffmpeg source onto the vtk web site, the ffmpeg developers
have substantially improved the library. Unfortunately some of their
changes broke backwards compatibility. This might be the source of
your problem. Their is an open bug on the vtk bug tracker to make
VTK/ParaView work with more recent ffmpeg, but until that is resolved
we are stuck with ffmpeg from a particular date. To make a long story
short, compile the version of ffmpeg from the tar ball and not a
version from the ffmpeg repository.

There's a bug in Paraview 3.2.* that prevent is from getting writers from 
plugins.  Its been fixed in CVS.

In the mean time, you can patch your code with this

The file test.vtk provided my Mike works for me, no errors or warnings. I see 4 
points as expected.

The file has a couple of minor errors, none of which kept it from working. The 
number of cell types is 5 but should be 4. There are several blank lines.

The error Patricia sees came from the class vtkXMLReader which seems to be 
impossible. That class is not used by ParaView to read a file with extension 
vtk. Are you sure you tried reading the exact same file that Mike provided?

Message-ID: <8e0b87a90802200926v6efb874ew8ce015db2452be41@mail.gmail.com>

Hi (beware of the beginner here :)

I am having performance problems with opacity setting of a minimal test data
(a 3D image of 24 voxels). If [Object inspector > Display > Style > Opacity]
is set anything less than 1.0, Paraview hangs for a long while only to
return with a inaccurately rendered view
(here<http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/opa.jpg>).


My configuration details are:

Paraview version 3.2.1
Windows XP SP2
ATI RADEON X800 GTO


Any suggestions, remedies?

thanks

I am using ParaView3.2.1 downloaded as paraview-3.2.1.zip in the
Latest Stable Release download section.

My first error is:

------ Build started: Project: vtkRendering, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------
Compiling...
vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow.cxx
..\..\..\paraview-3.2.1\ParaView3.2.1\VTK\Rendering\vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow.cxx(35)

Stuff\Software\ParaView3.2.1\paraview-3.2.1-build\VTK\Rendering\vtkRendering.dir\Debug\BuildLog.htm"
vtkRendering - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)

This is caused by "# include <GL/glaux.h>" in the file
vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow.cxx. I searched my C drive and the only
thing with glaux in the file name was libglaux.a in my MinGW\lib
directory. Does this seem like a compiler issue?

When I was installing Qt from the Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt,
I chose msvc2005 as my compiler. The options were
<g++/msvc/msvc.net/msvc2005/borland/bccx> (msvc2008 not an option). So
the command I used was >qconfigure msvc2005. That's the only compiler
related issue I've had so far, so I thought I would mention it just in
case.

Subject: [Paraview] Animating In Batch
Message-ID: <47BC6759.6000003@psc.edu>

There doesn't seem to be a concise guide to making animations in batch so I 
could use some help with putting together the pieces.

===
1) Interactively, build the animation using a small version of the data. It is 
NOT an animation over time.

2) Save the state then edit the state file to use the huge version of the data.

3) Create a simple Python script that reads the state file.

4) Compiled ParaView 3.2.1 from source and set the flags to wrap it in Python. 
This generate pvbatch.

5) Use pvbatch to run the Python script, producing files containing the frames.
===

But that doesn't seem to work. Is there a way to tell pvbatch to make the 
animation? All that information is in the state file.

Or do I have to painfully rebuild the animation as described in
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf ?

I finally got Qt 4.3.3 and PV 3.3 CVS HEAD compiled and the Prism
Plugin loads. Although the Examples did not compile due to this error:

Generating ../ParaViewExamples
Internal cmake changing into directory:
C:/Workspace/ParaView3/vs2003/Examples/All
Error: cmake execution failed
CMake Error: Remove failed on file:
C:/Workspace/ParaView3/vs2003/Examples/All/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp/debug/cmTryCompileExec.exe:
System Error: Permission denied
Warning: CMake is forcing CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to "" to match that
imported from VTK.  This is required because projects must use the
same compiler settings.  If this message appears for more than one
imported project, you have conflicting compiler settings and will have
to re-build one of those projects.
Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from
"Generating ../ParaViewExamples"

This was all on Windows XP, MSVC 2003.Net (Standard Edition), Qt 4.3.3.

Now if I could just figure out what is wrong on the Mac Side of things.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating a PV 3 Plugin - qrc File
Message-ID: <43a689850802201040l330c8011g2b433f1bd9c333e0@mail.gmail.com>

I was able to get plugins working on windows so I'll just work in that
env for a bit.

Question: In my .qrc file I am not really sure what I should be
putting in there.

Currently I have:

<RCC>
    <qresource prefix="/ClientPlugin" >
        <file>pqH5RoboMetReader.ui</file>
    </qresource>
</RCC>

The layout of my project is:

PVRoboMet
  src
    ClientPlugin
       Resources
          pqH5RoboMetReader.qrc
          pqH5RoboMetReader.ui


I am not really sure what I should be putting for "qresource prefix" ?

When I try to load my plugin ParaView gives back a dialog that says
the plugin failed to load. ( Some actual text in that dialog box would
be useful)

Thanks

If you use pqLoadedFormObjectPanel in your plugin, it doesn't matter what your 
prefix is.

Update your code.  Its been fixed in CVS today, so you'll get the reason for 
failure.

Things are working now. I just need to start hooking up my widgets to
start getting values from the server side. At least this all works on
windows. I have no idea what the deal on my OS X machine is (Either
10.4 or 10.5).

I have no idea but it still sounds like you might be mixing mingw and
visual studio.

So, basically I need ServerManager XML for each "thing" I want to

So I have a VOI that I am setting from the GUI. The QLineEdits are
named "VOIXMin, VOIXMax.... ".

Based on that I would need some xml in my server manager file
like this:


  <IntVectorProperty name="VOIXMin" command="SetVOIXMin"
        number_of_elements="1" default_values="0" />

You have have multiple Qt widgets connected to one server manager property.
If you want the connection made between your widgets and the server manager 
automatically, then suffix the Qt widget names with _0, _1, _2 for which 
index of the property they are connected with.  If you're going to set/get 
the values yourself, then you can name them another way.

Or if you want to make separate server manager properties, and have one Qt 
widget for each, you'll have to have corresponding properties on your filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Clip with sphere instead of plane
Message-ID: <1203547434.3658.65.camel@jackie.usc.edu>

Hi,

I seem to missing something, but how do I clip a dataset using a sphere,
instead of a plane, in 3.2.1? 

In version 2, paraview had box, sphere, and plane as clip functions in
the clip filter. 

Thanks much for your suggestions!

Cheers

The feature was removed because ParaView3 uses a new widget
architecture. To my knowledge we have not yet gotten around to
creating the new style sphere and box widgets. We plan to add those
back in by the ParaView 3.4 release.

As a workaround, you might use the calculator filter to define a new radius variable, then clip by scalar (rather than sphere.) Set the value of the scalar to the radius of the sphere you want.

OK. I got my VOI working and it seems to work because what I think are
two reasons:

1) It is a Settable property
2) The values come from QLineEdits

I have a bunch of other QLabels that are just "getters" to display
some information that the reader gathers during RequestInformation.
These values are NOT doing anything in the GUI.

Here is a typical example:

In the Server Manager XML file I have:

      <IntVectorProperty name="NumberOfSlices"
        command="GetNumberOfSlices" number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="-1" information_only="1" >
                <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
         </IntVectorProperty>

In the Header of my Custom Reader I have:
vtkGetMacro(NumberOfSlices, vtkTypeInt32);

and in my .ui file that QLabel is named:
NumberOfSlices.

The default value doesn't even get used from the Server Manager XML.
And turning on Debug for my custom reader tells me that the "Get***"
Methods are never being called.

So where did I screw this up?

Thanks
Mike

If everything else went find, its probably because ParaView is looking for 
a "textChanged()" signal on the QLabel, and its not there, so the link isn't 
created.
I think we can bypass that for information properties, and otherwise spit out 
a warning if the expected signal isn't found.

You can verify that is what is happening by debugging in 
pqNamedWidgets::propertyInformation().

Is there some sort of client/Qt code that I can implement in my GUI
class to hook these up? I am looking at the pqExodusIIReader file and
it looks like I should be able to do something... This is all new
territory for me so I have no idea what I am looking at. Is possibly
any sample code to look at that takes an int property from something
and displays it in a QLabel on the GUI?

thanks
mike

You can create an instance of a vtkEventQtSlotConnect, and connect to 
the vtkSMProperty's ModifiedEvent for NumberOfSlices, and have it call a 
slot you make in your panel.
In that slot, you can call pqSMAdaptor::getElementProperty() and set 
that value on the QLabel.

pqProxyPanel has an example of using the vtkEventQtSlotConnect, and 
pqCalculatorPanel has an example of getElementProperty(), and setting it 
on a Qt widget.

It should be relatively simple since you're doing a read-only thing.

Kevin,

An easy exercise is to read your mesh data twice (something ParaView is 
quite happy to do) --

1) On the first read, omit the node-sets and side-sets and color the 
mesh white (actually produces shades of gray/silver).

2) On second read, only read node-sets and side-sets one-by-one.
Color them with whatever color pleases you. Be sure to increase the 
point size.

Now you can independently toggle the visibility of the mesh and side-set 
(or node-set) in question and determine if they are correctly specified.

Subject: [Paraview] Extract Block not working properly?
Message-ID: <20080221.120927.191027575.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

The recent major changes in composite datasets for the CVS head looks
very intersting. However I have a problem: the Extract Block filter
for a single node with multiple datasets doesn't work as intended.

That is, when I only have Node 0 under Root, even if I deselct some of
the datasets under the node I still see the complete detasets as
output. But if I have 2 nodes under Root and deselect some of the
datasets under Node 0, Extract Block works exactly as intended
(removes deselcted datasets).

Further, I found by removing the following code at lines 109-114 of
ParaView3/VTK/Graphics/vtkExtractBlock.cxx the filter works as
intended for a single node composite dataset.

  if (this->Indices->find(0) != this->Indices->end())
    {
    // trivial case.
    output->ShallowCopy(input);
    return 1;
    }

I wonder what is the intension of this piece of code...?

Regards,
Takuya

I managed to build ALL_BUILD with 0 errors/failures. I ended up
installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, with Microsoft
Platform SDK for the build to work.

Now I have a paraview.exe file in paraview-3.2.1-build\bin\debug.
However, when I try to run it I get the error:

"This application has failed to start because the application
configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this
problem."

It looks like this is a common error when trying to run an application
compiled on a different computer, but I am compiling/running on the
same computer.

Can I ask exactly what version of Visual Studio people have had
success with (any additional packages required, etc.), and the
download location where they obtained it? Do I need the complete
"Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition" for example as opposed to
Visual C++ Express Edition?


Thanks.

Here is the error that I am getting

The plugin '/Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/Build/bin/ 
paraview.app/Contents/plugins/libH5RoboMetReaderPanelPlugin.dylib'  
uses incompatible Qt library. (Cannot mix debug and release libraries.)

I have checked both projects (ParaView and my Plugin) and both are  
using the same set of Qt libraries. Now what I _think_ may be the  
problem is that I only built _release_ Qt libraries but I build Qt  
and my Plugin with Debug symbols. Might be the problem. Going to  
recompile in Release mode and check in the morning.

I use VS 2003.net and typically I build Qt with Shared libraries  
(debug and release), build ParaView with Shared libraries, and then  
if I want to run from the build directory I have to copy all the Qt  
libraries into the bin/debug folder on windows.

Dear David

Thank you for your help, I have sorted out the problem. I did not include
the ffmpeg include path in the file in the proper way, thank you. Double
checked and the problem was solved. Thanks again.

Hi Clint,

I patched the code (pqWriterFactory.cxx), recompiled PV 3.2.1, 
recompiled the Plugins, but still when trying "save data" I don't see 
"tif" in the file type in the file dialog.

I also had a look at the Writer Plugin Example in PV3.3 in CVS. There I 
see in the CMakeLists.txt:

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(GUIMyTiffWriter "1.0" GUI_RESOURCE_FILES GUITiff.xml)

This isn't working for me. It seems that I still need a qrc file and I 
have to add the Plugin by writing:
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyTiffWriter "1.0" GUI_RESOURCES pqTiffWriter.qrc)

What is the difference between GUI_RESOURCE_FILES and GUI_RESOURCES?

I'm using Qt 4.2.2 with Paraview 3.2.1. Or should I better try the cvs 
Paraview 3.3 ?

Thank you,
Enkelejda

Subject: [Paraview] Display of time dependent unstructured grid separating
	the pointdata and the grid definition?
Message-ID: <fd5546a50802210445i26caf45cwc710e6768d1b7a4@mail.gmail.com>

hello all,
First of all, I have been using ParaView this year for grad work and
it has really sped things up for me. Great tool!

I am trying to visualize about 200 timesteps (using pvd collection) of
a 50,000 node unstructure grid FEM.  As far I as I understand it, I
need to include in every vtu file (each timestep) both the mesh
definition (i.e. node coords, connectivity, offsets, etc) and
obviously the actual pointdata for that timestep. Now, this is taking
a little bit of time and was wondering if I could simplify this by
breaking the mesh definition and point data into two different files
somehow. I need my model to grow to millions of nodes!

Thank you,

Alessandro

I am also looking for some working 3D Delaunay code that runs in a
PC/Windows environment; but I do not want to run it with Paraview.

Does anyone know of a standalone version of a 3D Delaunay code that runs in
a PC/Windows NT environment?

Thanks/Jim Dow

Subject: Re: [Paraview] plugin for 3D Delaunay

I managed to build ALL_BUILD with 0 errors/failures. I ended up installing
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, with Microsoft Platform SDK for
the build to work.

Now I have a paraview.exe file in paraview-3.2.1-build\bin\debug.
However, when I try to run it I get the error:

"This application has failed to start because the application configuration
is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem."

It looks like this is a common error when trying to run an application
compiled on a different computer, but I am compiling/running on the same
computer.

Can I ask exactly what version of Visual Studio people have had success with
(any additional packages required, etc.), and the download location where
they obtained it? Do I need the complete "Visual Studio 2008 Professional
Edition" for example as opposed to Visual C++ Express Edition?


Thanks.

 If you mean 3D Delaunay tetrahedralization, there are many, for instance:

tetgen, geompack, gmsh so on....

Subject: [Paraview] Research areas utilizing paraview
Message-ID: <b05971d10802210722p5e27a213l11ff450d083857a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone



Me and my team members are pursuing our postgraduate degree. We will have to
develope a project as part of our dissertation thesis. My team members and I
managed to visualize the data given to us ? the first phase using
VTK.Wewould be moving to the second phase in which we need to
parallelize the
visualization process. We will be using paraview and building it on our
cluster. I was just wondering, in which part can we focus on our research,
it has be about parallel processing of visualization and that also using
ParaView. Paraview seems to be able to do a lot of things, but we, as
students need to develop some kind of algorithms or some kinda framework or
some new methodology. Or maybe some kinda parallel plugin, readers .



We are hoping by posting this question in mailing list, we would get some
good response about how we can go about on our parallel processing and which
area we can focus on. We are doing our literature review, but we are still
unsure and we don't have any parallel visualization group in our university,
we are the pioneers. We hope someone can help.

Subject: [Paraview] Xmdf-reader: grid-centered attributes get read as
	point-data
Message-ID: <47BD99E6.9010502@gmx.de>

Hi,

I would like to use Xmdf/Hdf5 as my file-format for CFD-simulations. I
am able to read grids and cell/point centered attributes like velocity.

But I have trouble with grid centered attributes like "energy spectrum".
It does not get read correctly.

In the cvs paraview version I can see (using the spreadsheet) that a
grid-centered attribute gets read as point-data instead of field-data.

Any ideas...

Greetings
Jens

P.S: I attached my whole xdmf file

========= attribute definition in my xdmf file ==========

This is probably an issue with depth peeling.  When it works, it works great.  But there are some platforms on which it fails.

Ideally, we would like to get depth peeling working everywhere, and we try our best.  But with so many variations in graphics hardware there is no way for us to get our hands on all of them.

As a second best option, you should be able to turn off opacity.  You can't do that right now (without hacking up ParaView), but there is a feature request for that.  It should be coming soon.

Hi,

I figured out, that grid centerd attribute and node centered attribute
behave just the same (vtkXdmfReader.cxx: line 2519):
      if ( AttributeCenter == XDMF_ATTRIBUTE_CENTER_GRID ||
           AttributeCenter == XDMF_ATTRIBUTE_CENTER_NODE)
        {
        status = pointDataArraySelection->ArrayIsEnabled(name);
        }
      else
        {
        status = cellDataArraySelection->ArrayIsEnabled(name);
        }
      }

How can I add a data field, which has different dimensions than
cell/points, just to show it in a chart?

Greetings

Center="Grid" should be Center="Cell". The former means there is one value for 
the entire grid.

Yes it does. My automatic cvs udpate mechanism was not working  
earlier this week which lead to my problems. Doing a fresh checkout  
and build against Qt 4.3.3 does indeed work just fine..

Your pqTiffWriter.xml has a syntax error in it.

<ParaViewWriters>
  <Writer name="TIFFWriter"
          extensions="tif"
          file_description="Tiff Writer"/>
</ParaViewWriter>   <--  needs to be ParaViewWriters

Did ParaView not give you a warning for that?

hello all,
First of all, I have been using ParaView this year for grad work and
it has really sped things up for me. Great tool!

I am trying to visualize about 200 timesteps (using pvd collection) of
a 50,000 node unstructure grid FEM.  As far I as I understand it, I
need to include in every vtu file (each timestep) both the mesh
definition (i.e. node coords, connectivity, offsets, etc) and
obviously the actual pointdata for that timestep. Now, this is taking
a little bit of time and was wondering if I could simplify this by
breaking the mesh definition and point data into two different files
somehow. I need my model to grow to millions of nodes!

Thank you,

Alessandro

Submitting a parallel job via a batch queue system can affect the

Offhand I know of nothing that should cause your problem.  We use pbs to launch jobs on our vis clusters and it works fine.  We do have to use reverse connections because (1) outside computers cannot make connections to the cluster nodes and (2) we do not know where the server is going to be allocated anyway.

Do you have any information the pvserver job?  Do you have its output?  Is it exiting normally or crashing?  Is there any chance you could run it in a debugger?

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with State File
Message-ID: <47BDF6FA.1040607@psc.edu>

Using 3.2.1 on Linux it is impossible to exactly restore the display by 
recalling the state file. This is particularly important at facilities using 
pvbatch to render very large data sets, and using the state file to define the 
image.

1) The file gets larger at every load/save cycle. This doesn't look right.

2) The camera zoom is never restored. It seems to "zoom out" as if going to 
some default location.

3) In the XDMF reader I turn off 80% of the variables to reduce memory demands. 
These are always turned on again after loading the state.

4) A simple box is included (its useful for positioning the camera) but turned 
off before the state is saved. Upon reloading the state its always on.

Should these things be happening?

Well, it seems to be working now.  My only guess is that it had 
something to do with the X server.  I compiled with regular OpenGL (not 
Mesa), and used the --use-offscreen-rendering switch, so I assume it was 
trying to use pbuffers or likewise that still require access to an X 
server.  (I did this on purpuse as I do actually want this capability 
eventually, but for now I don't have remote X access to each machine)

At first it was working intermittently.  When it did work it waited 
several seconds, then told me that remote rendering would be disabled 
(which is fine).

After that, I explicitly cleared the DISPLAY env var in the batch 
script.  Now it connects instantly (still gives the remote rendering 
disabled) and works every time.

Perhaps it was a comm. timeout.  While the server process was waiting 
for a non-responsive X-server, perhaps the client gave up?

Thanks,
Sean

Message-ID: <e58876f00802211715h4c138551y97d819e1c85988f0@mail.gmail.com>

I want to connect to a ParaView server from the ParaView client using
python. Im using Paraview 3.2.1. Following the procedure found on
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:pvpython Im using the code:

import paraview
connection=paraview.Connect()
paraview.ActiveConnection=connection

The connection works but it has no name. Also the previous connection doesnt
disappear and now I have two 3D displays. But the strange thing is that when
I delete manually the first (the one that was there before, the "builtin")
connection (clicking on it and chosing "Delete") then the connection I
created, the new one, suddenly becomes useless - when I try to open the
File->Open dialog or add a new source an error comes up saying "No active
server selected" !
The same thing happens when using a c++ plugin with a code:

vtkProcessModule *promod=vtkProcessModule::GetProcessModule();
promod->ConnectToRemote("localhost",port);

The best would be if the state after connection was like the state you get
after clicking the Connect button in ParaView GUI - the previous connection
disappears and the new one has a name.
How can I do it from inside the C++ code/python ?

Hi Kent,

I need one value for the entire grid. In my case the energy-spectrum is
a property of the whole domain.

So I was expecting that it will get set through
vtkDataObject::SetFieldData() -- associated neither with cells not with
points.

Greetings

And you want to show those points  in ParaView?I might be inclined to try an unstructured grid with only VTK_VERTEX  as cell types.<http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf>  may help you figure out  what to write. Page 4 explains about the UnstructuredGrid format,  while there is an example starting at the bottom of page 8.# Example VTK file for general XYZ data# vtk DataFile Version 2.0Unstructured Grid ExampleASCIIDATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRIDPOINTS 5 float0.0 0.0 0.01.0 0.0 0.02.0 0.0 0.00.0 1.0 0.01.0 1.0 0.0CELLS 5 101 01 11 21 31 4CELL_TYPES 511111# End VTK File
I tried the test file as given and it certainly did not like the first line which I deleted, and then the file would run and generate 5 points. An error message was generated but did not stop the plotting:
 
ERROR: In C:\berk\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkUnstructuredGridReader.cxx, line 350

I think this is definitely something that would be a big help to many of us that work on XYZ data, if Paraview could automatically load XYZ data without the need to compile a separate reformatted structure. Clearly if it is only a few data points etc then the file could be done manually, but for more complex and large datasets this gets to be a problem.
 
Perhaps a stand-alone application could be written to convert from XYZ (or even netCDF) formats to ones that Paraview can  load without issue. There also appears to be a issue of legacy formats and the newer structures to contend with.

Dear all,

I am trying to create a 3D contour plot but I am not sure how to do  
it. I can get a 2D plot without problems from my Y,Z coords and the  
potential value (x=fixed value) (file .vtk) but I am not sure how to  
do it. Do you need different 2D contour maps (different .vtk files)  
for different slices to create the isosurfaces?

Any tips/advice would be highly appreciated.

Thanks again,

Patty,

ParaView can very easily create isosurfaces from 3D data. It sounds
like you need to convert your data into a single 3D .vtk file. Once
you have done that and load it in, the contour filter will produce
isosurfaces through the 3D data.

If you want details on how to convert your files into a single 3D
format, it would be helpful if you would specify what kind of data you
have (image data, structured grid, etc.)

Hope that helps,
Cory

Actually,
    All was fixed with her data set. I do agree that a small convertor
would be nice. If I had time I could hack something together with a Qt
Gui. Maybe read CSV files with xyz and optional point data? Shouldn't
be too hard to do just need the time.

Also some one posted some code earlier to do just this type of
conversion. I think you will need to look in the list archives for the
code though. I don't remember exactly when it was posted.

Hi Takuya,

That is a bug. However, the bug is not in the filter -- the code you 
pointed out is there to pass the entire tree if the root node was indeed 
the block that the user choose to extract. The problem is that the GUI 
marks the root node as selected when a dataset under its only child node 
is selected. I am looking into it. I will post something as soon as I 
have a solution.

Thanks,
Utkarsh

It actually is (sort of :-). First of all, the vtu format supports
multiple time steps in the same file. Unfortunately, this feature is
not well documented. Mathieu is the original author, maybe he'll
remember how it works.
Second, Kent has modifications to the paraview source that allows vtu
files to share the mesh when loading pvd files. I didn't have the time
to look at his patch and incorporate it into paraview yet.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Filter needs 3rd party library - How to link
	properly
Message-ID: <67C6CCE3-56D5-42FE-BA4E-0BDB923F2CAB@gmail.com>

I am writing a custom reader for the server side. Everything  
generally works great except today I noticed that ALL the targets in  
ParaView are now linking against some boost libraries that my reader  
needs. Now, looking at my PVRoboMetParaViewImport.cmake file I can  
exactly why that is happening:

     SET (PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES
         ${PARAVIEW_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES}
         ${BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY}
         ${HDF_LIBRARY}
     )

  .. which looking back I should have realized what happened. Could  
some one tell me how to just have the PVFilters ( and probably the  
PVFiltersCS) taget use the boost/hdf and not every other target?

This grid looks awfully like AMR. Can you give us more information
about its structure? Do you have multiple blocks, each of different
resolution or just one unstructured grid? Also, you may want to take a
look this page: http://quaoar.sr.unh.edu/chhdf52FlatVtk/ You may not
be able to use the code as it is but it will give you an idea on
tetrahedralizing this mesh.

A few additions to my list of problems with state files:

1) The reason the file gets larger is that more and more duplicates of the 
"trackball manipulators" are added.

5) The origin of the slice plane is not restored. The values are correct in the 
pvsm file but after loading they are at their default values.

One of the most promising features of ParaView was the way it could be used to 
work with very large datasets:

    - on your workstation interactively create a visualization
      on a small version of the dataset;

    - save state; then

    - use the state file in batch with the full dataset.

The unreliability of the state files makes this impossible. Would others use 
this feature? If so fixing state files might be important.

Is there any connectivity information between the slices? If so,
you'll have to include this in the VTK file. If not, then you'll need
to either figure out how to add connectivity information, or you'll
have to probably create a new VTK class to create a surface between
the individual contours, and then create a plugin for ParaView to
expose that class. I'm not aware of anything in VTK that can do this
currently. Obviously, this is much more work and more difficult.

Subject: [Paraview] Animating In Batch

Hi Kent,

Here's a sample plython script for doing what you want:
 > from paraview.servermanager import *
 > Connect()
 > LoadState("/tmp/animation.pvsm");
 > view = GetRenderView()
 > view.StillRender()
 > pxm = ProxyManager()
 > scene = pxm.GetProxy("animation", "AnimationScene1")
 > scene.Play()

I've attached the animation.pvsm file that I used (created with CVS 
paraview). Currently (on CVS head), when I load this state I am getting 
some error messages. I'll look into those, but they don't affect the 
animation.

Subject: [Paraview] Compile Error with Custom Plugin for ParaView CVS
Message-ID: <C129DB15-2844-41AA-8DF8-020DDB80B7AB@gmail.com>

I though I would attempt to insert my Client plugin cmake code into  
the paraview build so that I could build everything in one step. I  
patterned my cmake code after the Prism plugin with a one major  
difference. I call my Client cmake code from my  
PVRoboMetParaViewImport.cmake file.

   The compile progresses ok until I get to the point where the moc  
generated file tries to get compiled.:

[ 99%] Generating moc_pqH5RoboMetReaderPanelImplementation.cxx
cd /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/Build/H5RoboMet && /Users/ 
Shared/OpenSource/Qt-4.3.3-UBFrwk/bin/moc -o /Users/Shared/Kitware- 
CVS/ParaView3/Build/H5RoboMet/ 
moc_pqH5RoboMetReaderPanelImplementation.cxx /Users/Shared/Kitware- 
CVS/ParaView3/Build/H5RoboMet/pqH5RoboMetReaderPanelImplementation.h
/Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/Build/H5RoboMet/ 
pqH5RoboMetReaderPanelImplementation.h:45: Error: Undefined interface
make[2]: *** [H5RoboMet/moc_pqH5RoboMetReaderPanelImplementation.cxx]  
Error 1
make[1]: *** [H5RoboMet/CMakeFiles/H5RoboMetReaderPanelPlugin.dir/ 
all] Error 2

Line 45 of that header file is this:

   Q_INTERFACES(pqObjectPanelInterface)

I am guessing that I am missing any include path somewhere but not  
really sure where.


If I compile ParaView completely, then compile my plugin using its  
own cmake then the code compiles just fine.

Anyone have any ideas?

${pqComponents_SOURCE_DIR} needs to be added as an include dir before you do 
your QT4_WRAP_CPP call.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks! That is a simple, elegant solution.

Your example doesn't seem to save the results to files. Obviously, this is 
critical in batch since otherwise there is no point.

Does that happen at "scene.Play()"? Does it use the details (from the state 
file, I would guess) provided when saving the animation interactively?

The link you have describes the python api for early paraview 3, if you are using paraview 3.2 or later, get the pdf document on the servermanager near the top of the page you referenced. In that doc, it will describe a newer python interface to paraview. Your commands will look like

from paraview import servermanager
connection = servermanager.Connect()

Your first sentence is a little unclear. If you want to use the python scripting from pvpython, do the above; if you want to do it from the python shell in the ParaView Client, you should already have a connection to the builtin server.

I want to connect to a ParaView server from the ParaView client using python. Im using Paraview 3.2.1. Following the procedure found on http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:pvpython Im using the code:

import paraview
connection=paraview.Connect()
paraview.ActiveConnection=connection

The connection works but it has no name. Also the previous connection doesnt disappear and now I have two 3D displays. But the strange thing is that when I delete manually the first (the one that was there before, the "builtin") connection (clicking on it and chosing "Delete") then the connection I created, the new one, suddenly becomes useless - when I try to open the File->Open dialog or add a new source an error comes up saying "No active server selected" !
The same thing happens when using a c++ plugin with a code:

vtkProcessModule *promod=vtkProcessModule::GetProcessModule();
promod->ConnectToRemote("localhost",port);

The best would be if the state after connection was like the state you get after clicking the Connect button in ParaView GUI - the previous connection disappears and the new one has a name.
How can I do it from inside the C++ code/python ?

Dear Paraview People,

It seems that when you have contoured by a certain attribute, let's
say "temp", you can't color by that same variable.  I think I know
what the logic behind this could have been, an isosurface by
definition having the same scalar everywhere, barring interpolation
shenanigans.  However, if I extract a range of isosurfaces with the
"New Range" functionality, I would very much have liked to able to
colour the surfaces according to their isovalues.  Should I file this
as a bug?

Thanks,
Charl

Temporary solution: use Calculator to make a copy of the attribute, with a new 
name. Unfortunately this uses more memory.

Hi Kent,

The "scene" is nothing but the vtkSMAnimationSceneProxy which was 
created in Paraview client when we were setting up the animation 
interactively. That proxy gets saved in the state will the entire scene 
setup.

This proxy has a "Play" property which can be called to play the 
animation. To save the animation images to a file you can use the 
following code snippet:

 > from paraview.servermanager import *
   ...
 > writer = vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter();
 > writer.SetFileName(filename);
 > writer.SetFrameRate(1);
 > writer.SetAnimationScene(scene.SMProxy);
 > if not writer.Save():
 >   raise exceptions.RuntimeError, "Saving of animation failed!"

Also, for general reference, one can look at 
"ParaView3/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py"
This file is the source for the servermanager python module and has 
example codes illustrating many of the python capabilities. Infact, the 
above code is borrowed from "AnimateReader" function implementation :).

Try adding a
INCLUDE(${ParaView_BINARY_DIR}/ParaViewConfig.cmake
near the top.
There are some variables defined in there that some of the plugin macros need, 
which normally happens if you build your plugin outside the paraview tree.  
In this case it adds the include path to the Qt/Components directory.

One area of research that may pique your interest is that of time-based visualization.  A feature that is unique to ParaView/VTK is the support of time requests in the visualization pipeline.  It's a new technology that I am particularly happy with.  We recently published a paper at the IEEE Vis conference that summarizes the implementation.

  http://www.cs.unm.edu/~kmorel/documents/TimeVis-IEEE2007.pdf

There is a fair amount of research on visualizing data that changes over time, and I expect there is lots of interesting research for doing this kind of work within a general-purpose, parallel, pipeline-based visualization tool like ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Research areas utilizing paraview

Hi everyone

Me and my team members are pursuing our postgraduate degree. We will have to develope a project as part of our dissertation thesis. My team members and I managed to visualize the data given to us - the first phase using VTK.We would be moving to the second phase in which we need to parallelize the visualization process. We will be using paraview and building it on our cluster. I was just wondering, in which part can we focus on our research, it has be about parallel processing of visualization and that also using ParaView. Paraview seems to be able to do a lot of things, but we, as students need to develop some kind of algorithms or some kinda framework or some new methodology. Or maybe some kinda parallel plugin, readers .

We are hoping by posting this question in mailing list, we would get some good response about how we can go about on our parallel processing and which area we can focus on. We are doing our literature review, but we are still unsure and we don't have any parallel visualization group in our university, we are the pioneers. We hope someone can help.

Subject: [Paraview] GLXBadContext error when saving to png file
Message-ID: <85b5c3130802221353j1dd5f0edp5fb2456950bd135d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

when I try to save the image from paraview, I always get a
GLXBadContext X error. This also occurs when saving from Python, so
here
is a simple script to reproduce the problem:

$ cat t.py
from paraview import servermanager as sm
sm.Connect()
view = sm.CreateRenderView()
view.StillRender()
view.WriteImage("image.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 1)
$ python2.5 t.py
X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext
  Major opcode of failed request:  159 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  5 (X_GLXMakeCurrent)
  Serial number of failed request:  24
  Current serial number in output stream:  24


This happens both with the official binary, and when built from
source. I use Debian, with Intel 945GM graphic card.

Otherwise everything works fine. We are in the process of creating a
Debian package for paraview and getting it into Debian (and Ubuntu),
we already managed to built it with MPI and Python. If you use Debian,
you can use it from:

svn://svn.debian.org/svn/pkg-scicomp/paraview/

(it will take at least a month or more before it gets into Debian unstable).

I am guessing this is an OpenGL driver bug. We are using OpenGL
framebuffers for offscreen rendering when available. Some drivers
claim framebuffers are supported and die horribly when they are used.
Try this:

 view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0

before the WriteImage() call.

Like this?

$ cat t.py
from paraview import servermanager as sm
sm.Connect()
view = sm.CreateRenderView()
view.StillRender()
view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0
view.WriteImage("image.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 1)
$ python2.5 t.py
X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext
  Major opcode of failed request:  159 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  5 (X_GLXMakeCurrent)
  Serial number of failed request:  24
  Current serial number in output stream:  24


No luck. Actually, I don't know of any way to save images from paraview except:

* save to pdf, and extract the image from pdf. I didn't find a way to
do this from python (postscript writer fails too)
* using a regular screenshot (in gnome for example) and gimp

Do you know more information about this? I'd like to report a bug
against a proper package (mesa probably), to help figure out what's
wrong.

Thanks,
Ondrej

I'd be really interested to incorporate those changes into my copy of
paraview. Berk, is this something pretty simple to implement?

On Tools >Python Shell, if I execute:

then things work fine. But, if

import servermanager
servermanager.Connect()

is called (note the lack of assignment), then Connect() never returns and
paraview hangs (3.2.1 installed on a x86_64 system, running Ubuntu).

Is this the (an?) expected (mis)behaviour?

Hi guys


I would like thank Kenneth and Ken personnaly for their comments. Thanks
again for the information. How about VTK, we could use that as our tool
right ?

Subject: [Paraview] poor man's particle tracer
Message-ID: <31ddba770802240540m7b12b2ebmbd8863990067a7d@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm trying to create, for educational purposes, a poor man's particle
tracer with ParaView.  I have a static vector dataset, so I see two
options:

* by using a probe and warp vector filter, I can get particles being
advected by one step.  Is there some way of taking the output of the
first step and feeding it back into the network, so I can recursively
advect my particles?
* is there some way of using the animation functionality to move a
particle (or glyph or something) along the trajectory of a streamline?

Are there any other options?

For the moment I'm assuming no access to the ParticleTracer (as this
is not working 100% in the ParaView 3.2.1 release, as discussed in a
previous mail thread).

Thanks for any help,
Charl

What about streamline -> python programmable filter -> glyph? The
programmable filter has to behave as a time source. It can do that by
setting, err, I think, TIME_VALUES() and TIME_RANGE() keys in
RequestInformation() and responding to , err, UPDATE_TIME_VALUES() in
RequestData(). It could extract the nth point in one or more
streamlines where n is the time step. You can then animate it using
the standard animation support (I hope).

As an aside, I've found an easy work-around until this problem
(ParticleTracer is not activated for all time-dependent datasets) is
remedied: one can make use of a TemporalShiftScale with scale 1 and
shift 0 to cast a time-dependent dataset to the vtkTemporalDataset
that the ParticleTracer expects.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview/Qt memory crash
Message-ID: <1203876807.5091.13.camel@jackie.usc.edu>

Hi, 

I am trying to read in a large, 1.4GB, file Paraview 3.2.1 Linux x86 on
a 4GB RAM x86_64 machine. Should this be possible in principle? I am
getting a core dump related to not enough memory like so:

>>
Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc
Abort (core dumped)
<<

(where I am not sure if it's really Qt or paraview causing the crash,
how could I check?)

I've converted all scalars and vectors to char and unsigned char to save
space in the numeric representation, but that didn't help. 

Thanks for any suggestions on where to start looking. 

Cheers

Thorsten

It is probably doable. However

1. the size of the file is not necessarily the same as how much memory
paraview will use. What file format? What data format?
2. is your Linux 64 bit?
3. you may have to recompile paraview as a 64 bit application. Even
though your OS may be 64 bit, the paraview binary may be 32 bit and
therefore can access only 2GB of memory space.

Here is the link to the small converter that I posted a while back:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtk-developers/2007-October/004746.html

I wrote it.
I have also entered this as a feature request for ParaView as it crops up

Hi,

Is anybody working on multi-viewport support?
This would be usefull when creating films : a film dumps a single view, so 
that having multiple views is of no use here (or you have to glue them 
afterwards...)

Cheers,

it has been supported in the CVS version of ParaView for several weeks.

Uh, sure.  The difference between ParaView and VTK is that ParaView is an end user tool whereas VTK is a library that contains many visualization algorithms.  Applications like ParaView are built on top of VTK.  If you want to do research with ParaView, you will probably need to learn VTK quite well.

Hi guys


I would like thank Kenneth and Ken personnaly for their comments. Thanks again for the information. How about VTK, we could use that as our tool right ?

One area of research that may pique your interest is that of time-based visualization.  A feature that is unique to ParaView/VTK is the support of time requests in the visualization pipeline.  It's a new technology that I am particularly happy with.  We recently published a paper at the IEEE Vis conference that summarizes the implementation.



  http://www.cs.unm.edu/~kmorel/documents/TimeVis-IEEE2007.pdf



There is a fair amount of research on visualizing data that changes over time, and I expect there is lots of interesting research for doing this kind of work within a general-purpose, parallel, pipeline-based visualization tool like ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Research areas utilizing paraview



Hi everyone



Me and my team members are pursuing our postgraduate degree. We will have to develope a project as part of our dissertation thesis. My team members and I managed to visualize the data given to us - the first phase using VTK.We would be moving to the second phase in which we need to parallelize the visualization process. We will be using paraview and building it on our cluster. I was just wondering, in which part can we focus on our research, it has be about parallel processing of visualization and that also using ParaView. Paraview seems to be able to do a lot of things, but we, as students need to develop some kind of algorithms or some kinda framework or some new methodology. Or maybe some kinda parallel plugin, readers .



We are hoping by posting this question in mailing list, we would get some good response about how we can go about on our parallel processing and which area we can focus on. We are doing our literature review, but we are still unsure and we don't have any parallel visualization group in our university, we are the pioneers. We hope someone can help.

Subject: [Paraview] GL2PS for Paraview - Plugin Problems
Message-ID: <47C33065.1000000@gmx.de>

Hi,

VTK provides the class vtkGL2PSExporter to export a scene as a 
PostScript file using GL2PS. This is also very nice to have in Paraview, 
as it writes vector PostScript (PS/EPS), and is thus very nice for 
publication pics.

I was trying the last two days to make a GL2PS plugin for Paraview by 
activating the vtkGL2PSExporter. First I compiled vtkGL2PSExporter.cxx 
(by default VTK_USE_GL2PS is set OFF) in Paraview, then wrote a 
ServerManager xml file similiar to that in CVS 
ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/Writer (see attached files) to make a writer 
Plugin.

The input data type to this plugin is a vtkRenderWindow, which I think 
is the problem. I can load the plugin, but when I try "Save Data" I get 
the following error message:

ERROR: In /Paraview3.2.1/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1001
vtkProcessModule (0x8128d00): Object type: vtkGL2PSExporter, could not 
find requested method: "SetExecutive"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

Can anyone help?

Thank you,
Enkelejda

Message-ID: <iss.bb8178fe.15a0.47c41e1e.be4fd.61@mailout.lrz-muenchen.de>

Hi everyone,


I got a little closer to using pqPythonShell: pqPythonShell.executeScript(...) actually takes a string argument containing the script and not the filename of the script (this should be more clearly documented). The next problem is that this pqPythonShell has its servermanager not connected to anything. I want it to work hand-in-hand with the GUI, so I need it to connect to the GUI's builtin server. But so far, all my trial-and-error-attempts failed, and just calling servermanager.Connect() without any arguments yields strange results:
- The pipeline browser lists a second, nameless server in the pipeline browser and creates a second 3D view.
- Preceding calls (prior to servermanager.Connect() through pqPythonShell) of servermanager.ActiveConnection in the standard Python Shell of the GUI return 'Connection (builtin::0)' while successive calls return 'Connection (::0)'.
- Using the new connection for creating and registering sources like SphereSource succeed but creating a representation fails.
I must be missing something important. What am I doing wrong?

Best regards,
Alexander Wille

P.S.: Just to make sure you get me right: I'm running a Paraview GUI, launch a pqPythonShell through a GUI plugin and would like it to execute scripts from .py-files just like they would when using Tools->Python Shell.

Sorry, it's not clear how much of this you are doing from a GUI Client where a connection is already established by default and how much is internal to your plugin.

It sounds like you are creating a second connection rather than using the one that is already established. That can happen if (in the python shell in the GUI Client) you get to servermanager by setting your python path to include paraview and then "import servermanager" rather than just "from paraview import servermanager" or "import paraview.servermanager". In the first case you get a second confused connection which shows up in the pipeline browser as a nameless server, and which hangs the Client. Your first and second bullets sound like you got the same thing.

Do you really want a second connection? It sounds like you got access to the first one before you called servermanager.Connect(). This is how the python shell in the GUI Client behaves; by default a connection is established when the Client starts.

Sorry again, I misread your post. I didn't understand that the problem is getting to the already established server from your plugin python shell.

What I should have suggested is

    &InitialHeavyData;:/block0

because at the top you define

    <!ENTITY InitialHeavyData "test.hdf5"

However it doesn't hurt if you define an entity and then don't use it.

Subject: [Paraview] Unexpected XDMF Reader Output in Python
Message-ID: <47C45E4F.3030405@psc.edu>

Using pvbatch from ParaView 3.2.1 (CentOS 5) to run the program below yields 
"0" for the number of groups although I know there are 2 grids and one domain. 
I've added other prints (not included) that lists the domains and grids.

The output from the reader is a multigroup dataset. Are the Python classes that 
I am using to investigate the reader output working for this case?

Suggestions?
TIA!

Hello, all,

    I found a message in the discussion archives from Brad King at 
Kitware where he describes how the "paraview" binary in the bin 
directory is being built. It sets the right LD_LIBRARY_PATH and then 
executes paraview-real.

    So, when I issue the command:

/opt/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/bin/paraview --print

on a Linux workstation (running Ubuntu 7.10) where ParaView works I get 
the right stuff:

gonzalo@GONZALO-WS:~$ /opt/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/bin/paraview --print
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2:/opt/intel/cc/10.1.008/lib:/opt/intel/fc/10.1.008/lib
/opt/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview-real
gonzalo@GONZALO-WS:~$

but on my other Linux machine (also running Ubuntu 7.10) I just get the 
"No such file or directory" message. So I guess I should be missing some 
library....

Any ideas?

Please keep the discussion on the list, i.e., don't reply just to me.

The "size" parameter (the 88) is the sum of all the integers. There are 22 sets 
of 4. Its not what one might expect; you just have to read the documentation 
carefully. There are many things like that in VTK (and the world).

Glad it works!

Dear all

I use the Stream Tracer with Custom Source with a *static* input and a
time-dependent source (an XML Collection of vtkPolyData). When hitting
the "play" button, the source animates correctly, but my streamlines are
not recomputed.

I was hoping to move the seeds of the streamlines (while the 3D vector
field itself remains unchanged) but modifying the source, does not seem
to trigger a re-execution of the streamines. Shouldn't that work?

I use paraview3 cvs of today.

Weird. Did you check if the paraview executable has the right permissions?

Subject: [Paraview] vtkNetCDFReader for which ParaView 3.x version?
Message-ID: <372360DB-B0F2-4162-8E1A-5227A0783529@cs.duke.edu>

Hey,

Do any of you happen to know which 3.x version of ParaView works with  
the CSCS vtkNetCDFReader?

Maybe I'm mistaken, but it looks to me like the CVS head of VTK (and  
ParaView) has dropped/changed some classes so that things like  
vtkMultiGroupDataInformation.h and vtkMultiGroupDataSet.h can't be  
found when trying to build the netCDF reader into ParaView.

I'm meeting with someone on Thursday who wants to me to show him  
ParaView with his netCDF data, so I need to figure out which older  
version to pull to build with the reader (and I'd rather not do trial  
and error if someone just knows the answer offhand).

Thanks,
-Eric

Thank you for the reply. Yes, I checked, and the permissions are right. 
I tried stracing it, but I could not find out what is going on... I lost 
hope at this point...

Thanks anyway.

Best,

I would think that it would work with ParaView 3.2. Try checking out
the ParaView-3-2 branch.

Message-ID: <b05971d10802270046m10638068na74e4e347a53996f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I managed to install ParaView on the cluster at my lab, the cluster runs on
Linux. And there were no errors, I compiled with MPI, python but I didnt use
Mesa, I read on the wiki pages that its not necessary to install mesa if
graphics hardware exists. Anyway, my cluster does not have any graphic
hardware, but I am using my pc ( run on windows and has graphic hardware) to
connect I use putty and xming. I can render the paraview and it appears but
what I can't see is .. the sources thing like cone, arrow, 3D text, when I
choose and click apply, it loads but nothing appears, paraview does not hang
and it works fine, but I can't see anything appearing in the 3D view. I have
attached a screenshot together with this mail.

When I link two cameras, the rotations and the translations (pan) are

Is this a feature or a bug?

Hold the phone.  I was just able to replicate the problem.  This only occurs when in parallel projection mode.  This is definitely a bug.  I submitted a report.

I am curious, as I have thought of doing something similar - if the  
nodes *only* have graphics cards (no monitor), does one still need to  
use OSMesa?

No.  The ParaView server can still use the graphics cards to accelerate rendering.  ParaView will then read the images back from the card and deliver them to the client (or write them to an animation file in certain modes).

I'm getting errors from ccmake when building ParaView CVS (ParaView3, 
just did an update) on 10.5 with cmake versions 2.4.7 and 2.4.8.  I 
don't get the errors in Linux with cmake 2.4.7.  This is what it looks

I think all the weird line breaks must be an OS X terminal thing.  
What's really strange is that all those include files that it can't 
find are there.

I thought I had seen a recent post about using CMake CVS on OS X, but 
can't find it with a search.  Anyway, do I need to build my own cvs 
cmake or is this something else?

Message-ID: <54a988e20802271006p2c951c1ax2a050c39548f76c5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am unable to load a sequence of MHD files (named  test.%.3d.mhd) for
animation within Paraview. This might seem fairly basic but in all
cases paraview only loads the 000 frame and I am unable to animate.
All I want to do is to load the sequence of 3D images and view it
using a Cut plane (animated).

All the tutorials/help pages I found seem to be for earlier versions
and are not of any help. I am using version 3.2.1

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Hi,

sorry for keeping this thread open, but I cannot find a solution for 
using Exporters in Paraview.

E.g. does anyone know how to use the IVExporter in Paraview? There is 
the class vtkIVExporter which is compiled, but how to integrate it in 
the Paraview GUI? Integrating it as a Paraview Writer Plugin does not 
work as Exporters in VTK do not have the same interfaces as Writers 
(below I tried for GL2PS).

Any idea how Paraview supports/integrates vtkExporters?

Thank you,
Enkelejda

Subject: [Paraview] Python Error in Python Shell
Message-ID: <9EA6CBD6-63A6-460E-9E8F-FD40D80A5C84@gmail.com>

I am working on a new packaging shell script for OS X and I am  
getting the following error when I attempt to run the Python Shell:


Python 2.3.5 (#1, Jan 13 2006, 20:13:11)
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5250)] on darwin
 >>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<string>", line 1, in ?
   File "/Users/Shared/Toolkits/ParaView3/bin/paraview.app/Contents/ 
SharedSupport/paraview/__init__.py", line 40, in ?
     from libvtkPVServerCommonPython import *
ImportError: No module named libvtkPVServerCommonPython
 >>>

Taking a look around I see that ParaView is linked against  
libvtkPVServerCommonPythonD.dylib. There is also a  
libvtkPVServerCommonPython.so library. Is that a plugin that I am  
missing maybe?

Also, not sure of the naming convention, but I did a Release build  
but I still have libvtkPVServerManagerPythonD,  
libvtkPVServerCommonPythonD, libvtkCommonPythonD as dylibs. I would  
think those names would be missing the "D" at the end of the name.

Any help or insights would be greatly appreciated.

The .so is the plugin module. It links against the .dylib which the
plugin links against. You need both. I am not sure what the D stands
for but it is not debug. Dynamic maybe.

I found the "D" section of the Python cmake code and it seems to be  
hard coded in there. So you are probably correct, it doesn't stand  
for "Debug".

I guess I need to track down where the libvtkCommonPython.so is  
created to see if I can tie into that cmake code to create shell  
scripts that will copy and update those as plugins. Any ideas where  
those targets are created?

Nevermind.  The files were _not_ there after all.  My CVS checkout must 
have failed and the updates must not have been retrieving the missing 
files.  I had to start over with a new checkout.

Hey Mike,

On my system both the libvtkCommonPython.so and  
libvtkCommonPythonD.dylib both end up in the build/bin directory, like  
any other plugin or library, in case that helps.

I expect the problem is caused from not having the build/bin directory 
in the pythonpath system variable.

Yep. Mine too. This came about from my work in packaging ParaView for  
OS X. I wasn't copying the .so files because my scripts didn't _know_  
about them. If they are just plugins then I can copy them to the  
proper location within the .app package. I was just looking at  
_where_ in the cmake files to hook in so that I can create the  
scripts that will copy and update the .so files.

Thanks

Is there a way to make new representations (for a 3D view) available in a plugin?  I basically want to add an entry to the Representation combo box which then activates my own rendering code.

The representation combo box shows the options listed in enumeration domain
for the "Representation" property of the representation proxy.  Does that
help?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview file format documentations
Message-ID: <200802272209.23086.numerical.simulation@web.de>

Hi!

I am rather new to paraview (just worked through the tutorial from 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/SC07_ParaView_Tutorial - cool!) and I am 
planning to use paraview as visualization tool for my own solver.

I find it hard to figure out which file format to use, so I am looking 
for some advice.

Q: My solver generates 2D unstructered mesh data together with 
field data (stress, strain, pressure, velocity, etc.) over this grid. 
Which file format is most appropriate to use for this? 
Any library you would recommend? 

Q: Is http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf the only information
publicly available about vtk file formats or is there other information
available?

Q: I guesss the ex2 - file format used in the above-mentioned tutorial 
the same which is described in 
http://endo.sandia.gov/SEACAS/Documentation/exodusII.pdf.
Am I right?

Q: Searching the source code with the command
find . -type f -exec grep -l vtkExodusIIWriter {} \;
yields
./Servers/ServerManager/Resources/writers.xml
./VTK/Parallel/vtkExodusIIWriter.h
./VTK/Parallel/CMakeLists.txt
./VTK/Parallel/vtkExodusIIWriter.cxx
./VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusModel.h
./VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusReader.h
./VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusIIReader.h
./VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusReader.cxx

At first glance I did not find code which _uses_ class vtkExodusIIWriter.
Can you provide a usage example for writing a small 
unstructured 2D grid  with simulation data using vtk classes.

If you like start from this code here 

#include <boost/array.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <algorithm>


typedef boost::array<double, 2> point_2d;

// this is only dummy demo code (pseudo-unstructured)
std::vector<point_2d> create_grid(std::size_t i_max, 
                                  std::size_t j_max)
{
  std::vector<point_2d> grid;

  for (std::size_t i = 0; i < i_max; ++i)
    {
      for (std::size_t j = 0; j < j_max; ++j)
        {
          point_2d p = { double(i), double(j) };
          grid.push_back(p);
        }
    }

  return grid;
}

std::vector<std::list<std::size_t> > 
create_connectivity_list_for_grid(std::size_t i_max, 
                                  std::size_t j_max)
{
  std::vector<std::list<std::size_t> > connl;

  // [ ommitted for brevity in this post ]
  
  return connl;
}

std::vector<double> generate_field_data(std::size_t n)
{
  std::vector<double> field(n);

  std::fill(field.begin(), field.end(), 1.0);
}
 
int main()
{
  std::vector<point_2d> const & grid = create_grid(3, 4);
  std::vector<std::list<std::size_t> > const & connl =
    create_connectivity_list_for_grid(3, 4);
  
  std::vector<double> data = generate_field_data(12);

  // output to a paraview file format

  // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
}

I have narrowed this down some more and the python loading mechanism  
looks for the *python.so files in the same directory as paraview.  
Within the App bundle the mechanism should probably be looking in lib  
or plugins instead. Anyone know which source file sets this search path?

thanks

I believe the code you are looking for is in
/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/Executable/vtkPVPythonInterpretor.cxx

Be very gentle with that code, it broke many many times :-)

What I have is:

Down around line 110:

     const char* inst_dirs[] = {
       "/paraview",
       "/../SharedSupport/Python", // MacOS .app package
       "/../lib", // MacOS .app Package
       "/../lib/paraview-" PARAVIEW_VERSION "/paraview",
       "/../../lib/paraview-" PARAVIEW_VERSION "/paraview",
       "/lib/python" VTK_PYTHON_VERSION "/site-packages/paraview", //  
UNIX --prefix
       "/lib/python/paraview", // UNIX --home
       "/Lib/site-packages/paraview", "/Lib/paraview", // Windows
       "/site-packages/paraview", "/paraview", // Windows
       0
     };

/../SharedSupport/Python is needed for the actual python .py files
/../lib is needed because that is where I am copying the files.

I can change either. Just made more sense to have a directory called  
"Python" instead of "paraview" which didn't make any sense.

Compiling now.. so hopefully it will work.. and not break any other  
build on any other platform.

What I have now (after some trial and error) the the following:

     const char* inst_dirs[] = {
       "/paraview",
#if defined(__APPLE__)
       "/../lib", // MacOS .app Package
#endif
       "/../lib/paraview-" PARAVIEW_VERSION "/paraview",
       "/../../lib/paraview-" PARAVIEW_VERSION "/paraview",
       "/lib/python" VTK_PYTHON_VERSION "/site-packages/paraview", //  
UNIX --prefix
       "/lib/python/paraview", // UNIX --home
       "/Lib/site-packages/paraview", "/Lib/paraview", // Windows
       "/site-packages/paraview", "/paraview", // Windows
       0
     };

and then a few lines after that:

#if defined(__APPLE__)
     vtkstd::string libDirPath = self_dir;
     libDirPath.append("/../lib");
     vtkPythonAppInitPrependPythonPath(libDirPath.c_str() );
#endif

And then I updated the scripts to copy the python modules into the  
lib directory inside the app package. I can now run python scripts  
seemingly without any errors now.

I don't know of a simple or direct way to do that.

But it might be possible to do with a plugin that implements a custom view, 
instead of a writer.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_custom_view

The only parts you'd need are to define a ViewModuleProxy in the server 
manager xml, and on the client side, make your own view class derived from 
pqRenderView.  You'll notice the example has a captureImage() function, and 
that's about where you can put your exporters that require a vtkRenderWindow.  
In that client code, you can define your own context menus for the view if 
you wanted to use that to let the user a choose which exporter to use.  You 
could also add checks in there to make sure rendering is done on the client 
side, which some of those exporters seem to require.

The cmake macro ADD_PARAVIEW_VIEW_MODULE only requires the VIEW_TYPE and 
VIEW_XML_GROUP, which is all that plugin would define.

Subject: [Paraview] OS X ParaView.app Package Creation Scripts
Message-ID: <6CD0EE45-3DAE-4024-8F21-E94D7C6DCBD2@gmail.com>


I have been working a on rewrite of the shell scripts the put
together a final OS X application package during a "make install".

Currently I have the following paraview.app layout:

paraview.app
   |-Contents
     |-MacOS
     |-Frameworks
     |-lib
     |-plugins
     |-Resources
     |-SharedSupport
       |-Documentation
       |-assistant.app
       |-paraview   {Python Support}

Note that a few things have been "moved around" somewhat. I have
attempted to put things where Apple and other application developers
seem to put the same types of "things". This also necessitated a few
changes to some source code files to update where to look for several
items. Currently I have a working installation that I can take to
another 10.4 machine (ppc or intel) and run from that location.

I am seeking any feedback from the OS X / ParaView community as to
this general layout or any other thoughts. Currently the source is
just residing on my machine but I would be happy to tar something up
if someone wants to try it on their system. I also wrote the core
update shell scripts to be able to be used for any CMake project that
wants to build an OS X app package with embedded libraries/
frameworks, like any Qt based project.

#------- More Detailed information ----------
     I created a new directory in ParaView3/CMake called
OSX_Tools. Within that directory I have the following:
OSX_BundleBuilder.sh.in  <- Configures to do the bulk of the updates
to the libs/executables
OSX_BundleTools.cmake  <-Contains Macros to run other CMake files
OSX_MakeInstall.cmake.in  <- CMake script that gets configured and
then run during "make install"
OSX_PluginUpdateScript.sh.in <- Bash script that gets configured and
then run during "make install"
OSX_InstallAndUpdateAssistant.sh.in <- Shell script that copies and
updates QtAssistant

I also added and updated the following files in ParaView3/
Applications/Client:
CMakeLists.txt <- Added the proper code to include
OSX_BundleTools.cmake and call the proper macro from that file
CreateBundle.sh.in <- Modified this file to perform paraview specific
tasks


The general flow is such.
    CMake Time: All the cmake templates and shell script templates are
configured. A single cmake script is added to the "install" phase.
That cmake script calls OSX_BundleBuilder.sh first then calls
CreateBundle.sh. If there were plugins, then CreateBundle.sh will
call individual shell scripts that copy and update the plugins for
the paraview.app package.
#-------------------------------------------

Again, if you would like to try these out or have any feedback (good
or bad) I would like to hear it so that when I submit the files to
the ParaView team for hopeful inclusion in ParaView, then scripts
will be the best they can be.

Subject: [Paraview] rendering streamlines
Message-ID: <1b61cab90802272216m59bbf1b5xbd60b222d28f95a3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have data of streamlines, each of which is a series of points.

(x(1)_i, y(1)_i, z(1)_i) (i = 1, ..., N(1)) : 1st streamline
consisting of N(1) points
(x(2)_i, y(2)_i, z(2)_i) (i = 1, ..., N(2)) : 2nd streamline
consisting of N(2) points
...
(x(M)_i, y(M)_i, z(M)_i) (i = 1, ..., N(M)): Mth streamline consisting
of N(M) points

Is it possible to render "separate" M streamlines with paraview from
that kind of data?

Thanks.
Shigenobu

Hi all,

with previous version of paraview (at least in 2.6) there was the 
possibility to display the axis, with ticks and labels, of an object 
(menu "display" of "object inpsector"). With paraview 3.2 how can I 
display the axis with ticks and labels?

You cannot.  That feature did not make it into ParaView 3.2.  It will be in ParaView 3.4.

If each series is represented as a polyline, then sure.  That is what the stream tracer filter outputs.

Hi,

I have written a filter that uses a cylinder to cut the input and develop 
it: 

class VTK_EXPORT vtkDevelopedSurface : public vtkPolyDataAlgorithm
{
public:
  ...
  virtual void SetCylinder(vtkCylinder *Cylinder);
  vtkGetObjectMacro(Cylinder,vtkCylinder);

protected:
  ...
  vtkCylinder *Cylinder;
 ...
};

And now I would like to set the values associated with the Cylinder 
(Center and Radius first, then I will have to set the transform 
parameters) in ParaView.
Setting the Cylinder itself is ok with the xml, but setting the values of 
the cylinder is a mistery for me.
I wrote this xml for the server to have a proxy to the vtkCylinder 
implicit function (I copied a lot from the ImplicitPlane xml found in the 
utilities.xml) and use it in the vtkDevelopedSurface filter: 

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="implicit_functions">
 
    <Proxy name="Cylinder" class="vtkCylinder">

</ServerManagerConfiguration>

The pb is that I can't find a way to expose the Properties of the 
Cylinder. I tried to set the cylinder as a sub proxy (as commented above), 
but there is an error during plugin load.

I couldn't find example of this in the xml file, is it supported? 
If yes, could you give me some hint?

Thanks for any help!

The Exodus format would probably be a pretty good fit for that.  I'm not saying that Exodus is the absolute best format ever, but I certainly prefer it over the VTK formats for unstructured grids.  Also the Exodus reader in ParaView is pretty good; we've spent a lot of time on that.

The VTK User's Guide has some information.  For the legacy formats, it's the same, but it also has information about the XML formats.

ParaView uses the Exodus writer, but that does not really help you for example code.  Nominally, you just need to set its input, give it a filename, and call the Write method.

If you are not using VTK to create the data in the first place, it may make sense to use the Exodus library directly to write your data to a file.

Is there a way to change the representation proxies created from the existing view proxies, or do I need to create new view proxies as well?

Right, but is there a way to override what CreateDefaultRepresentation returns without creating new subclasses of vtkSMRenderViewProxy?  Is there perhaps a way to create a new definition for proxies like UnstructuredGridRepresentation in a plugin?

I don't think that's possible currently.

Hi,

Is there a way to force ParaView to open a new RenderView after executing 
a filter?
ParaView opens a new view if the view is not a RenderView, but I can't 
find a way to force him to open a new RenderView (except creating a new 
class that inheritsd from the RenderView but has a different name...)

Cheers
Stephane

Probably around May but we may release some snapshots before then (I
am not promising anything).

I second Ken's statement. Exodus is probably one of the best supported
formats in ParaView (thanks to Sandia).

Hi - apologies if this may be obvious to many.

I'm not sure if within Paraview there is a way to change the light source in
the scene ...

I am using the 3.2.1. version on Windows.

I did a quick scan on mail archives etc, and I found old (<2 years)
references mentioning that this was in the works, but I'm not sure if it was
eventually implemented and is made available from the Win binaries.

Thanks for the clarification, and regards

Andrea Giacomelli

I believe that the reader in VTK is serial only. If anyone contributes
a parallel reader, I'd be happy to include it.

is anyone using MinGW to compile ParaView cvs? Turns out I only have
the Standard version of VS2003.net so there is no optimization
allowed. I am thinking of alternatives. I have VS2005 Pro except I
really need something that can produce a drag and drop installation.
Our users do not have local admin on their machines to use an actual
installer.

Any comments are most welcome.

It has been a while, but I have compiled and cross-compiled ParaView with 
mingw before.

This will probably expose my ignorance about Windows but why can't
your users install a vs05 build without admin privileges?

Hi!

Thanks for your answers.
After rethinking what I really want to achieve I come to the conclusion that 
my data is so simple that it might be a good idea to give the vtu file format 
a second try.

What I did not understand is the "offsets" entry in this format.
What is meant with  
"offset into the connectivity array for the end of each cell"?

Probably  a little example will help: consider I have two quadratic cells
lying side by side like in the example below, which entries have to be made
in the offsets section?


<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"

Subject: [Paraview] transparency in volume renderings
Message-ID: <324579.87494.qm@web51006.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi, 
   
  I am trying to volume render my RECTILINEAR_GRID data on Paraview v 3.0.2.
  I load the data, then apply the 'tetrahedralize' filter on it, select Style:Representation as Volume. Now I try to make my dataset extremely transparent, for which I select 'Edit Color Map...' make the opacity for the entire Color Range as 0. But still I see some residual opacity. My dataset is not absolutely transparent which one would expect. Can someone please suggest me the way to make the dataset absolutely transparent which would mean that it has completely disappeared as it happens when you set Style:Opacity=0 with Style:Representation=Surface.
  Also the problem with the steps so far and thus the reason for it not becoming absolutely transparent.
   
  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
   
  Thanks in advance,
   
  Pooja

I don't have that much experience in windows but I have used cpack and nsis
to make a single click exe for other qt applications, I would expect that if
you hacked around with nsis/cpack you could do the same no matter compiler
you use.

explains it way better than me. Basically with VS 6 there was DLL
hell. With VS 7, MS tried to alleviate the problem by saying put all
your DLLs in the same directory as the executable. This alleviated DLL
Hell but MS could NOT centrally admin those c runtime libraries like
they could in VS 6. So they came up with DLL versioning. But to use
this each user has to run an executable that installs the VS 8 Runtime
DLL in system32, which requires admin access. My users don't have
admin rights on their machines. So basically this would require 2
support calls to our computer support department. One to install the
VS8Runtime dlls and another to install ParaView. With VS2003.Net it is
a drag and drop installation, and probably with MinGW.

Hope that explains it. (I have gotten a real education on this today.

Ah, I see. I think there is a way of packaging the vs05 dlls without
requiring the users to install the Microsoft dlls themselves. It has
something to do with manifests and such. Dave Cole would know better.

Before you go too far down this path, I want to warn you that I
recently realized that reading ASCII based XML files is rather slow. I
assume this is due to the fact that we use an XML parser to read the
XML portion of the file and that is rather slow. If your data is
relatively small and simple, I suggest using the legacy VTK format. It
is very easy to write and is faster for the ASCII case.

Once I understand this format I would try to use binary data sections in a 
second step ... or do you think this is also slower than the legacy format?

No, the (appended) binary format is fast because the reading is
handled by our own code not the XML parser.

Step 1: Upgrade to ParaView 3.2.1.
Step 2: Directly volume render the recilinear grid (unless it is a non-uniform rectilinear grid).
Step 3: I cannot replicate your residual opacity problem in ParaView 3.2.1.  Either it is fixed or check to make sure that the opacity is really zero everywhere.

Can someone please suggest me the way to make the dataset absolutely transparent which would mean that it has completely disappeared as it happens when you set Style:Opacity=0 with Style:Representation=Surface.
Also the problem with the steps so far and thus the reason for it not becoming absolutely transparent.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Pooja

Yes and no.  You do not have full control of the lighting, but you have several options.  These are located in the "view options" dialog box, which can be accessed by clicking one of those little icons in the bar directly over the 3D rendering or by using the menu Edit -> View Settings.  In the dialog box, click Lights.

The default light is a simple headling.  All you can control for that is the intensity.

The other lights are part of the "light kit" helper.  This sets up a collection of lights similar to the lights you would normally find in a photography studio.  They are designed to bring out the shading of surfaces better, and I usually recommend them over the default light.  If you don't like the way they are set up, there are a plethera of controls to change the individual lights position, color, and intenisty.

Subject: [Paraview] light source control - is it available ?

Hi - apologies if this may be obvious to many.

I'm not sure if within Paraview there is a way to change the light source in the scene ...

I am using the 3.2.1. version on Windows.

I did a quick scan on mail archives etc, and I found old (<2 years) references mentioning that this was in the works, but I'm not sure if it was eventually implemented and is made available from the Win binaries.

Thanks for the clarification, and regards

To make a simple cut it seems like I need the following. I left out all the 
rest to make this post as short as possible.

==============================================
from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect()
cutF = servermanager.vtk.vtkPlane()
cut = servermanager.filters.Cut()
cut.CutFunction = cutF
==============================================

But here's what pvbatch says. I deleted the path up to the build directory (mpi).

==============================================
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "t4.py", line 5, in ?
     cut.CutFunction = cutF

ParaView should package correctly such that its installer works on any
Windows system, regardless of MSVC runtime dlls. That is what the line:
INCLUDE(InstallRequiredSystemLibraries)
from ParaView3CPack.cmake is all about.

With VS8 2005, you can still put all the dlls in the same directory with the
app, but you also need a manifest file. CMake 2.4.8 should properly take
care of this for you, though.

If not, it's a CMake bug. (Or a bug in ParaView's cmakelists files...)

Are you trying to build an installer after building with VS8 and it's not
working?

HTH,
David

Try commenting out the...
  GET_CMAKE_PROPERTY(vs VARIABLES)
...line from ParaView3/Qt/CMakeLists.txt at line 70.

That's debug-code that I added a while back to gather more info on the morva
dashboard warnings. I still never figured it out, though. If not soon, then
I'll have to remove that code anyhow...

Hopefully that's the cause of this and commenting out that line fixes it for
you.

Let us know,
David

Message-ID: <e58876f00802281637y5455ffc4nab5c3349f01acd6c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have already compiled Paraview 3.2 on Linux without bigger problems. Now I
have to do the same on Windows. Im following the instructions from page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install
First problem is that they suppose that the person compiling it has Visual
Studio 6 or 7. As far as I could find out Visual Studio is a commercial
software so I have downloaded
the free Visual C++ 2008 Express from page
http://www.microsoft.com/japan/msdn/vstudio/express/
Using it I compiled Qt without problems but while compiling Paraview I get
the following errors:

error C3163: '_vsnprintf : attribute doesnt match the previous declaration
......
fatal error C1083: include could not open file 'GL/glaux' - no such file or
directory
....
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: couldnt open file 'vtkParallel.lib'
and many other *.lib files give that error
...

The configuration Im using is :
- Windows Vista/Windows XP - the same result on both
- Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
- CMake 2.8 - patch 8
- Paraview 3.2.1 source downloaded from
http://www.paraview.org/New/download.html (because I cant use CVS from where
I work)

What am I doing wrong ?
Thank you for any help.

Hi all,

I want to change the transparency of a surface colored by some scalar
value, but "Opacity" in the color scale editor is *gray* and cannot be
changed. ("Scalar Value" there can be changed.)

I'm using Paraview 3.2.1, Mac OS X PPC.

Could someone tell me what is wrong?

Thank you.

If you haven't, you'll need to install the Windows SDK to build ParaView 
with VC++ 2008 Express.

there is an opacity control inside the display panel for each pipeline 
object. That will work unlike the opacity inside the color scale editor.

If I remember correctly the opacity option is around the point and line 
width settings.

Hi Robert,

Thank you for that information, but it didn't work for me. Changing
the opacity in the display panel did nothing for the transparency.

That is unusual, I  tested at home on a mac book (Panther + Intel CPU) 
and I was able to get transparencies working.

Hi Robert,

Thanks for the further information. I followed what you did, but got a
different result; the transparency didn't change, but the background
color changed from gray to white. So something is wrong with my
platform, iMac PPC + Leopard + Paraview-3.2.1.

The apparent difference is that you use 3.3.0 while I use 3.2.1.
So, I'll try it again with 3.3.0.

Hi Robert,

While 3.3.0 is being built, I tried the same thing with old paraview-2.6.2.
Then I got an identical result to yours; the opacity control in the
display panel worked.

So, I suspect something wrong with 3.2.1 at least for the transparency.

Subject: [Paraview] Still no progress compiling Paraview on Windows using
	Visual Express
Message-ID: <e58876f00802282359r1a1d3bd9vcd6ab9d4034da5ea@mail.gmail.com>

As I have mentioned in my previous mail Im trying to compile Paraview3 on
Windows using Visual C++ Express 2008 (or whatever Visual C++ free version
is there).
Im getting two main errors during compilation of Paraview in Visual C++
Express GUI :
error C3163: '_vsnprintf : attribute doesnt match the previous declaration
fatal error C1083: include could not open file 'GL/glaux' - no such file or
directory

I have compiled Qt using the command line qconfigure.bat msvc
and also qconfigure.bat msvc.net
I installed also Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and changed properly
the VS library path to point to v6.1.
Still no progress. Same errors.

Does anybody know what I should do to make it work? The only think I want is
to compile Paraview on Windows (not having to pay for Visual C++). If there
is any other way then using Visual Express 2008 or if somebody thinks that I
should use Visual Express [version XXX] in combination with library[XXX] and
compiling Qt with options [XYZ] or whatever, please give me a hint, any.

Thank you for any help.
Thomas

Hi,

I'm trying to build paraview from CVS source on Leopard PowerPC, but
it fails at the very final stage with the following message. Could
anyone suggest me how to resolve this problem?

Thank you.

Message-ID: <iss.bb8178fe.2b0c.47c7ea09.9726e.d@mailout.lrz-muenchen.de>

Hello everyone,

I've dug deeper into the problem I've described previously. It seems like pqPythonShell can be worked with like a fresh pvpython-instance. I.e., pqPythonShell reacts the same way to code you execute on it using its executeScript()-method as pvpython would right after you started it; The only difference is what I stated in my last post (calling Connect() on a pqPythonShell's servermanager causes Paraview to crash in a strange fashion). So solving the problem with pvpython should solve it with pqPythonShell as well. Now, when I connect the GUI to a pvserver, the pvserver stops waiting for more clients (= it only accepts one). After that, every attempt of connecting a pqPythonShell (in a Plugin) or pvpython to that server fail; It seems as if the GUI-internal servermanager had taken exclusive control over the server (which does make sense, I think). So what I need is not a pqPythonShell with its own servermanager, but one already connected to the builtin server (= the GUI-internal one) OR a Connect()-function of the servermanager working as intended, i.e. connect to the builtin server and not start a builtin server and then connect to it.
How do I get such a pqPythonShell or did I misunderstand the Connect()-method? Or is this a bug?


Best regards,
Alexander Wille

The problem with your code is that you are connecting a vtk object (the
vtkPlane) directly to a proxy (the Cut filter). To create a plane proxy
refer to Robert's link. Here's the script updated to the current CVS (
servermanager.createModule() is now directly accessible):

implicit_functions = servermanager.createModule("implicit_functions")
plane1 = implicit_functions.Plane()
plane1.Normal = [1, 0, 0]

cutfunc = servermanager.filters.Cut(Input=cube1)
cutfunc.CutFunction = plane1
cutfunc.ContourValues = [1.0,2.5]

Subject: [Paraview] Segmentation fault
Message-ID: <47C819A2.6000509@ims.metu.edu.tr>



Dear Paraview users,

I am trying to compile Paraview from source code in Linux fedora core7.
There is no error during the compiling step. After compiling Paraview.
I have added

/home/gunduz/soft/paraview3.2/lib/paraview-3.2 to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and
/home/gunduz/soft/paraview3.2/bin to my PATH

After running "paraview" command on my shell,
the paraview screen appeared for a while and the program ended
with "Segmentation fault" error.

Since there is any explanation about the error,
I could not figure out what cause segmentation fault.

Could you please help, what kind of error could be responsible
for this error?

Thank you very much in advance,
Murat

Try also installing the appropriate Platform SDK.  I haven't done this
personally, but it's been the solution for VTK compilation  on Visual Studio
express.

Hi,

I can only answer about the glaux error.

For the glaux issue, it has been fixed a while ago, but obviously it is not part of ParaView 3.2.1:

I have .a versions of the X & std Clibraries, and I'm linking against a
"linux-x64-static" Mesa build I made.  I have BUILD_SHARED_LIBS off.   I set
the CMAKE_X_LIBS to reference the .a libraries, rather than the .so, as well
as X11_X11_LIB and X11_Xext_LIB.  But it seems it's still referencing the
.so's.

I've tried adding "-static" to the CFLAGS options, but then I get errors
related to kwProcessXML attempting to reference ld64.so (which doesn't
exist).  From reading around Google, it seems that error usually indicates
attempting to static-ly link to a dynamic library.  Is there some trick to
getting a fully-static version?  Is it even possible?

Hello,

I'm not sure about the error, but since it is referring to *.a  
libraries, are you building with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS = OFF? (I have  
always built in OS X with it ON)

You could try the latest CVS version of 3.3 and see if that resolves the 
problem, as I do not have access to a PPC Mac to see if I can replicate 
the problem.

Hello
 
With reference to a future release of Paraview (Windows), it would be great if the option to natively load and process XYZ data and netCDF (GMT format) grid files was directly available within Paraview, i.e. as built-in file formats.
 
Hopefully this is something that is not overly complex to implement in the next release.

Hi John,

Do you have an easy way to measure the performance in ParaView ? (is there 
a way to set up a timer? )
By the way, I had another question on stream tracing : do you know why 
can't we use cell-based velocity field for stream tracing ?

[Paraview] StreamTracing Tester/Guinea Pig(s) wanted






Hello all,

I've been making some changes to the caching/interpolation used in 
vtkStreamTracer and mostly vtkInterpolatedVelocityField - which I hope 
will give a performance increase - but I have tweaked so many things over 
a relatively long period, that I'm not entirely confident of benchmarks - 
and to be honest I don't want to spend the time setting up a series of 
(rigorous) tests to confim anything.
Other groups have also compared Ensight Streamline generation performance 
to ParaView and found between 2x and 8x performance difference between the 
two packages. 

Is there anyone out there that can help me out, by doing the following 
1) Use a Release build of CVS head paraview or raw VTK C++ (from very 
recently - or now)
2) To generate streamlines on the biggest data they generally work with. 
 The more cells and the more multiblock datasets the better as my caching 
is partly aimed at multiblock improvements. One addition is the ability to 
use a locator for initial seeding. This adds a few seconds to the 
initialization - but improves performcnce when injecting many seeds.
3) Provide a couple of timing benchmarks which are
 a) A large number of relatively small streamlines (where Injection of the 
initial seed points has a big impact on the calculation)
 b) A large-or-small number of long streamlines on big datasets where the 
streamlines pass through many blocks of multiblock data - the inner loop 
velocity interpolation generally dominates when the integration produces 
long streamlines.
4) Compare the perfomance with a similar/identical streamline generation 
in Ensight (optional request, if you can that'd be great)

5) Do a cvs update after I commit some changes and rebuild paraview with 
exactly the same settings for release/optimization etc
6) Re run identical tests which will show if the changes have made any 
difference.
7) The tester should be reasonably familar with all the parameters that 
can be tweaked in the vtkStreamline module so that they can tune the test 
so that it is realistic.
8) The tester(s) should be able to set up a test without help - I'd hope 
that if someone can dedicate an hour or so to testing before CVS commits 
and then a short time after updating from cvs (assuming test is now setup 
and needs no adjustment) that they will require no help from me.

the fixes I have made are mostly for the benefit of the ParticleTracer 
module, but in the process I have made some tweaks which should help the 
Streamline module too. I'm keen to find out if they really have made any 
difference (5% or 50% - I have no idea?) . If ParaView can compete with 
Ensight, that'd also be useful to know. It may be a week or more before I 
check in my stuff as I have to synchonize my code with the 
multiblock/composite changes of a few weeks back, but if a handful of 
people can do tests this week and then again in a week or so, that'd be 
great.

Thanks in advance

JB

Did this come out of compiling vtkzlib?  If so, try commenting out the 
#      define vsnprintf _vsnprintf
in zutil.h

The only other code to call that function is vtklibxml2, and it checks for 
Visual Studio 2008.

Have a look at pqMainWindowCore::initPythonInterpretor()
which gets called when the python dialog is brought up.  It sets the 
servermanager.ActiveConnection for scripts to use.
You probably need to do the same, when you bring up your python widget.
Its basically getting some stuff from the C++ side and putting it into the 
python space.

Thanks Utkarsh and Robert; that works. All this leads to 3 important questions 
for the ParaView developers:

1) Why are there items in servermanager that are NOT already proxys? As I 
understand it servermanager is used only in client-server mode.

2) Why are the implicit functions not already in servermanager.filters? The Cut 
filter is useless without them.

3) Why is none of this mentioned in my shiny, expensive new book "The ParaView 
Guide"? The book is also missing the secrets of custom modules that Mike 
Jackson has been trying to unearth.

Thanks!

Hi Kent,

I am not sure I understand the question. Also, servermanager is always
used not only in client-server mode. It is the Model, in paraview's
Model-View architecture. There are a few cases where it is required to
access the client-side VTK objects directly but most of the time, you
should access proxies only.

I will add that group to the default modules we create.

There is always so much to cover in documentation! We tend to be
behind our coding in our documenting :-) There is hope though. We now
have a technical writer in our team. I am sure she will be MAKING us
write more documentation.

Also, the python modules are very young and immature. It will take
some time for the community to converge to a good, stable
implementation. At one point, I will restructure the wiki such that
others can contribute to the python documentation as well as provide
examples. If there are any volunteers, I can provide the servermanager
documentation as a Word file so that it can imported into Wiki
properly.

Tools -> Timer Log is your friend. It should tell you how long it took
to execute each filter on each processor.

Thanks for the information! This should really jump to a list for PV 
developers, if one existed, since most of you just use it interactively. 
However, if you plan to use batch mode, read on.

Sorry I wasn't clear. Lets say I am only working with a Python script to be 
used by pvbatch. There is no client.

Maybe there is a division here that is not yet clear. From Python its starting 
to sound like one could use two styles:

a) Work directly with the server-side VTK objects using the Python wrappers 
found in servermanager.vtk (e.g., a simple Python version of the C++ routines); or

b) Work with proxys for the VTK objects found in 
servermanager.sources/filters/rendering or proxy objects created as Utkarsh 
described using servermanager.createModule.

**If** that is correct then

1) What I did was to try to add something from 'a' directly to a pipeline being 
built with 'b' and that of course failed.

2) Are their situations where style 'a' is better/worse than 'b'?

3) Does 'a' support parallel processing?

Never use 'a' unless you are writing a python script for the python
programmable filter. Always use proxies. Always means:
  * Stand-alone paraview
  * Client-server paraview
  * batch
  * ...

In the case of batch, client means first node. The python script is
executed only by the first node. The servermanager library is used to
instantiate the VTK objects on all nodes and to modify them. If you
create a VTK object directly from python, it will be available only on
the first node.

There are a few other unlesses (is that a word?) but I am skipping
those for the sake of simplicity.

Can you start paraview in gdb and post the stack trace (use the there
"where" command)?

I am guessing certain features of python may not be accessible from
embedded python. We don't exclude any features on purpose.

I would expect eval/exec to be blocked as they both convert stings into 
python commands, which would be a security risk and a problem if they 
have to then convert the eval output to c++.

Subject: [Paraview] replace coordiate by field value?
Message-ID: <200803010032.38037.numerical.simulation@web.de>

Hi!

Thanks to ML help I have a little demonstrator writing .vtu files.
Now I'd like to display the data as follows: The z-Coordinates 
at each point which is always 0 should be replaced by the scalars
in the same input file, such that I get a 3D impression of the value 
distribution

Does Paraview support this kind of visualization?
And if yes, how is it done? 

regards,

Markus

There are a few ways of doing this. The easiest way is to use the Warp
Scalar filter.
