Subject: [Paraview] Custom object panel deprecated?
Message-ID: <20120901.220201.132839812.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I see from http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo that the classic way
of adding an object panel via a plugin has been deprecated. Do we have
an alternative?

Subject: [Paraview] Threshold filter
Message-ID: <E46E1030-0AC1-4DEF-BCAE-3266790614D6@gmx.net>

Hello people,

I just try to figure out which unit or what exactly are the threshold values in the threshold filter? 
The manuals explain that the threshold is based on scalars. Anyway I do not understand it totally. 
Scalars, does it mean houndsfield units,...?

Thx,
Chris

Field data are loaded from files (or generated by filters) simply as arrays of values. Operations of the threshold filter, or any filter for that matter, will operate using whatever units the data are specified as. So if you have, say, loaded a CT dataset that recorded data in houndsfield units, then that is what you use to specify the scalars the threshold filter. If the data are specified in some other type of units, then use those.

This border only appears in Paraview when moving a scale, it then vanished
on release.  Is there a command to remove it in batch?

Hi Ken,

thank you for the answer. I wanted to know it for CT. 

Have a good day,

Hi guys,

I'm back from vacation, and by reading your comments it seems to be related
on how the widgets are managed across several view and when active view
change...

I'll check with Utkarsh what can be done about it.

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to read .vtk file
Message-ID: <5044C892.8050509@kcl.ac.uk>

Hi.

I'm new to Paraview and have written a simple text file with a .vtk 
extension to be read by paraview. I have used the following syntax:

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 210 1 120
ORIGIN 0 0 0
SPACING 1 1 1
POINT_DATA 25200
SCALARS ImageFile float 1
LOOKUP_TABLE default
-1000.000000
-1000.000000
-1000.000000
-1000.000000
-1000.000000
-1000.000000
-1000.000000
-1000.000000
...

Paraview is unable to read the file. Can you please explain why to me 
and what I can do to fix this?

Many thanks. Best wishes,
Marta

Subject: [Paraview] Image Slice Rep XZ/YZ Slice Slider Range Bug
Message-ID: <5044D5F4.8050704@ohio.edu>

There is a bug in the image slice representation in ParaView from
git.

In slice directions other than XY the slice slider range is
limited to the number of XY slices.

To see the bug use the wavelet source with extent:

-100 100
-100 100
-10 10

Change the representation to slice, the slice direction to XY,
and the camera viewto the -Z direction.

Use the slider to view all the slices orthogonal to the Z axis.

Now change the slice direction to XZ (or YZ), and the camera view
to the -Y (or -X) direction.

Use the slider to try and see all the slices orthogonal to the Y
(or X) axis.

Observe that the slider range is limited to the first 20 slices.

Other slices can be seen by entering their number in the text
entry box.

Enter 100 and see a slice through the middle that could not be
reached using the slider.

I reported this as :

Subject: [Paraview] Loading CoProcessing Modul Error
Message-ID: <003101cd89f5$f45c1280$dd143780$@bg>

Hi,

 

I've builded  ParaView 3.14.1 as described here for CoProcessing support

http://paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing#Build_Directions

 

but I'm not really sure how to test the installation.

 

It's written "highlight CoProcessingPlugin", but It doesn't exist in remote
plugins list, so I tried to load it.

I found libvtkCoProcessor.so and libvtkCoProcessorPythonD.so in bin folder
but when I try to load one of them

the error message appears.

 

Plugin loading error when trying to load libvtkCoProcessors.so

tServerCore/vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx, line 324

vtkPVPluginLoader (0xb5f9db0): Not a ParaView Plugin since could not locate
the plugin-verification function

 

 

thanks in advance

Simeon Tsvetanov

For your scalar bar representation (probably called something like
ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation1) you should set Enabled=0 in its
constructor. I'm guessing you used the python trace to generate the python
code -- this is on my list of things to do to fix it there.

The coprocessing script generator plugin currently only works properly with
ParaView's built-in mode. I haven't had a chance to see why there are
problems with it as a remote plugin. It's really a client-side only plugin
anyways in that all of the work it does is on the client.

Subject: [Paraview]  PNG compression when making screenshot
Message-ID: <CAFFYk1VZRa-=MuFRYKCC5PMDdWEuhMPJBPYmuexYbJP+1k5yOg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to reduce the size of the screenshots made in batch.  Using
trace, I found

view = GetRenderView()
view.CompressorConfig = 'vtkZlibImageCompressor 0 9 4 0'
WriteImage('test.png')

...but they're the same size with and without the compression.  The
dimension is 1700x900 and I'm getting 1.4MB per image.  When I make a
similar image in Ensight, I can use the max compression setting to get the
image down to 400KB.

I'm not sure if it's the command or the compression lib that are wrong.

Alex,

Look at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Updating_View_Layout

It explains how to update view layout from Python.

Looks good to me. I've pushed it to stage.  It dashboards are
unaffected, it will show up in master after next gatekeeper review.

Hi Joseph,

Those settings you mention affect the image during transfer from the 
server to the client. They are used to fine tune remote rendering 
performance. Unfortunately the vtkPNGWriter does not expose any options 
for tuning compression.

Would this be an easy feature to add?  Running PNG optimisation per image
will take a very long time.

You should probably investigate first and make sure that it's the 
compression settings that are the issue. It looks to me like vtk png 
writer uses the default compression settings which should be decent. I'm 
wondering if there are some other differences between pv and ensight 
that could account for the difference in the output sizes, eg. number of 
channels, bits per channel, etc... it may be possible to tweak some of 
these upstream from the reader saving you some work. Depending on the 
path you take between investigation, modifying vtk, modifying paraview 
and testing the changes there could be a good chunk of work involved.

Since I am a git neophyte I can wait -- I'm not sure how to push my branch
the way you want it.  For the time being I also need to work on wrapping
things up at the lab (not related to the wind blade reader), so let me know
if you guys run into any problems with the code.

My hope was that an improved wind blade reader would be released with the
next version of ParaView. I could address any problems that appear up
before the release.

Message-ID: <637EC2F55459BA488F00312D2BC699472210F6DB@MBXE-01.exchange.cornell.edu>

Hi All,

I'm trying to visualize some vector component field time series written by a seismic wave propagation code, and converted into .vtu files by a set of upstream scripts.

I'm trying to compute the norm of the vector at each timeslice and then visualize the resulting scalar field. The data are all PointData. There are approximately 866,000 values for each compoment per timeslice, and about 20 time slices.

I'm trying to do this computation via the Python Programmable Filter (mostly so I can learn its tricks for future reference). However, I'm running into an apparent hang. The following code (complete with many more debugging print statements than I would use in production) is the simplest code I can make fail reliably:

--- begin code snippet ---

x = inputs[0].PointData['Scalars_']
print "x shape =",x.shape

y = inputs[1].PointData['Scalars_']
print "y shape =",y.shape

z = inputs[2].PointData['Scalars_']
print "z shape =",z.shape

m = x*x  # I _thought_ this should run at numpy speeds?
print "m shape=",m.shape

# more debugging code to finish computation of the norm omitted

output.PointData.append(m,"Displacement Norm")

--- end code snippet ---

I can run everything -- cutting and pasting initial subsets of the code into the program text box -- with the print output I expected all the way to the "m = x*x" statement.  If I include the "m=x*x" statement the process hangs. It does not even print out the preceding print statements.

I was under the impression that such syntax as my "x*x" used above would be evaluated by numpy, and the (implicit) loop should be executed at C speeds.  Am I correct in that understanding?  If not, how should I go about coding an equivalent computation in the Programmable Filter that would execute at C (numpy) speeds?

Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to provide,

I thought one needs to convert a vtkarray to a numpy array with

	x = numpy.array(inputs[0].PointData['Scalars_'])

before doing anything with it.

Computations after that style of construction hang too.  To my eye, the results of such an expression should be 100% standard numpy, obeying 100% standard numpy semantics.

It appears that there is a bug in numpy integration to the Python Programmable Filter.

I'll re-compile from source and report back on the results.  Is the bug tracking system evident from the homepage?

Cheers,
	Frank Horowitz

Hi Frank,

I didn't have a problem with the following on my windows machine using the
ParaView 3.14.1 installer.
=======
try: paraview.simple

except: from paraview.simple import *

paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

Wavelet1 = Wavelet()

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

ProgrammableFilter1 = ProgrammableFilter()

ProgrammableFilter1.PythonPath = ''

ProgrammableFilter1.RequestInformationScript = ''

ProgrammableFilter1.Script = 'x = inputs[0].PointData[\'RTData\']\nprint "x
shape =",x.shape\n\nm = x*x # I _thought_ this should run at numpy
speeds?\nprint "m shape=",m.shape\n\n# more debugging code to finish
computation of the norm omitted\n\noutput.PointData.append(m,"Displacement
Norm")'

Show()

Render()

=============

Does this work for you?  If it doesn't, I wonder if it's an issue with
having multiple pythons and numpy or system environments causing problems.
What version of paraview are you using and how did you get it
built/installed on your machine?

Andy

Hello,

I have a transient model loaded into paraview. Now I want to export a .x3d
file for each frame (lets say for 2000 frames).

I think the script should be very easy, but since I am very new to Python
scripting in paraview, I don't know where to start. Can someone help me
please?! BTW I am using* version 3.14.*

Thanks

As a temporary workaround you can manually modify the paraview application
to enable retina support.
I haven't verified that all the icons layout properly.

You need to edit the info.plist inside the Paraview.app/Contents/ folder
and add the following two lines as the
first items in the <dict>:

<key>NSPrincipalClass</key>
<string>NSApplication</string>

Thanks / yes, that takes care of rendering the fonts correctly, icons are still blurry but overall it's better.
My guess is that to get the full retina support, that means QT needs to be updated first ? ?

I do believe that is correct. I don't know what version of Qt will have
retina support by default.

OK Andy,

Thanks for that!

I've compiled and installed Paraview from git's release branch, and (a slight modification) of your code runs correctly. I think that means that my paraview/python integration is semi-sane.

However, my problem still occurs. Recall that I have a time series of .vtu files (indexed by integers built-in to their filenames) being fed into inputs[0] (at least as I understand it).

In my original code snippet, I assumed that the "m = x*x" statement would iterate not only over the point values of the spatial array, but also over all timeslices.  Is that a correct assumption? Is that the source of my problems???

Thanks again for your help,
    Frank Horowitz

Hi Frank,

I didn't have a problem with the following on my windows machine using the ParaView 3.14.1 installer.
=======
try: paraview.simple

except: from paraview.simple import *

paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

Wavelet1 = Wavelet()

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()

ProgrammableFilter1 = ProgrammableFilter()

ProgrammableFilter1.PythonPath = ''

ProgrammableFilter1.RequestInformationScript = ''

ProgrammableFilter1.Script = 'x = inputs[0].PointData[\'RTData\']\nprint "x shape =",x.shape\n\nm = x*x # I _thought_ this should run at numpy speeds?\nprint "m shape=",m.shape\n\n# more debugging code to finish computation of the norm omitted\n\noutput.PointData.append(m,"Displacement Norm")'

Show()

Render()

=============

Does this work for you?  If it doesn't, I wonder if it's an issue with having multiple pythons and numpy or system environments causing problems. What version of paraview are you using and how did you get it built/installed on your machine?

Andy

Computations after that style of construction hang too.  To my eye, the results of such an expression should be 100% standard numpy, obeying 100% standard numpy semantics.

It appears that there is a bug in numpy integration to the Python Programmable Filter.

I'll re-compile from source and report back on the results.  Is the bug tracking system evident from the homepage?

Cheers,
        Frank Horowitz

I'm compiling QT 5 beta to see what happens, I'll see if I can get ParaView 3.14 compiled against it.

I'm not sure I completely understand about your inputs[0]. As for iterating
over time with the python programmable filter, inside the filter it will
only have access to values from a single time step at each invocation of
RequestData(). You can think of the order of operations if you have 5 time
steps as:
1) iterate over each of the 5 time steps (i.e. load a file and update the
pipeline with that data set)
2) update the python programmable filter output for the current data set
resulting from the loaded file

If you want time statistics for your variables I think you probably want to
use the calculator filter to square the value at each point and then use
the temporal statistics filter to get an average of those values. After
that you can just multiply the results by the number of time steps.

If I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to do, I'd suggest giving a
description of what you're trying to do and maybe there's a simpler way of
doing it.

OK, the 30,000 foot view:

I have a time series of about 20 slices (currently) of values of each component (3 components total) of a vector displacement 3d spatial field from an elastic wave propagation simulation. At the moment, I'm simply trying to visualise the vector length to see the propagating phases of the wavefield. Because my upstream codes and scripts only write individual components of the vector field, I need to combine the components and then calculate the vector lengths *somewhere*.  The programmable filter seemed like a good place to try that, since once I am past the learning curve for it, I'll have the full flexibilty of numpy for doing almost anything else I want with these and similar data from my upstream simulation codes.

Now the 10,000 foot view:
I've been trying to simply calculate the sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z) scalar field (where x, y, and z are the respective components as a function of position)  and let that flow on down the pipeline as a new spatial field to be visualised. I assumed (correctly if I'm interpreting your answer correctly) that if I built the filter to deal with the spatial aspects of the calculation, the time series would be taken care of by paraview iterating over all files pointed to by inputs[0] (a set of files containing timesteps of the x components), inputs[1] (ditto for the y components), and inputs[2] (ditto for the z components).  The set of *.vtu files for each component have filenames specifying component and time step (e.g.: x001, x002, x003, etc., y001, y002, y003, etc., and z001, z002, z003 etc.). 

Now the close-up:
As far as I can tell, after compiling from source from the git "release" branch (on an up-to-date Linux Mint distro -- which tracks Ubuntu Precise), my approach will work for a set of 3 single timestep arrays fed into the "ports" (or whatever paraview's terminology is for the inputs to a filter in the pipeline). In other words, a single timeslice (x001,y001,z001) appears on inputs[0:3] (numpy slice notation) and is processed correctly. (I'll go away and verify that shortly.)  I *think* the "hangs/race-conditions/whatever" start when there are multiple timesteps presented to each input port.  I was unsure whether the 'inputs[0], inputs[1], inputs[2]' syntax needed to be extended to deal with time series as above, and could not find documentation on the inputs[] array after extensive searching -- just a few snippets of example code that were all consistent with paraview dealing with the time series on its own.

I'm inexperienced enough with paraview to not know if I have a conceptual error with the way I'm approaching this problem, or if I have simply stumbled over a bug. That's why I've posted to the mailing list!

As always, your (and the rest of the list's) help is greatly appreciated!

Cheers,
	Frank

OK, more tracking the problem:

The assumption underlying my "close up" description below is not correct.  The problem appears to be the actual _size_ of the dataset I'm feeding in. Even a single time step fed in to the filter (with some 866,000 points) hangs at the x*x computation, even though that appeared to work perfectly fine with your 3D Wavelet as a source (only some 9,000 points).  

I'm guessing a memory leak somewhere?  When was the last time paraview was run through valgrind?

Cheers (and sorry about the red herring earlier),
	Frank

and couldn't find much. Does paraview handle
jpeg 2000 files ? Can I do a hierarchical visualization
using paraview ?

Thank you,
Cagatay

Still more checking things out. A problem (THE problem???) can be demonstrated with your code snippet from a few messages back if you construct the Wavelet like so rather than using the default constructor:

Wavelet(WholeExtent=(-100,100,-100,100,-100,100))

N.B. this is on a different machine, with a stock Mac OSX  binary version 3.14.1 installed.

Even a single time step fed in to the filter (with some 866,000 points) hangs at the x*x computation, even though that appeared to work perfectly fine with your 3D Wavelet as a source (only some 9,000 points).

At the moment, I'm simply trying to visualise the vector length to see the propagating phases of the wavefield. Because my upstream codes and scripts only write individual components of the vector field, I need to combine the components and then calculate the vector lengths *somewhere*.  The programmable filter seemed like a good place to try that, since once I am past the learning curve for it, I'll have the full flexibilty of numpy for doing almost anything else I want with these and similar data from my upstream simulation codes.

I assumed (correctly if I'm interpreting your answer correctly) that if I built the filter to deal with the spatial aspects of the calculation, the time series would be taken care of by paraview iterating over all files pointed to by inputs[0] (a set of files containing timesteps of the x components), inputs[1] (ditto for the y components), and inputs[2] (ditto for the z components).  The set of *.vtu files for each component have filenames specifying component and time step (e.g.: x001, x002, x003, etc., y001, y002, y003, etc., and z001, z002, z003 etc.).

In other words, a single timeslice (x001,y001,z001) appears on inputs[0:3] (numpy slice notation) and is processed correctly. (I'll go away and verify that shortly.)  I *think* the "hangs/race-conditions/whatever" start when there are multiple timesteps presented to each input port.  I was unsure whether the 'inputs[0], inputs[1], inputs[2]' syntax needed to be extended to deal with time series as above, and could not find documentation on the inputs[] array after extensive searching -- just a few snippets of example code that were all consistent with paraview dealing with the time series on its own.

Subject: [Paraview] concatenate
Message-ID: <CAG0uffURs_PbZ_UeaYqtZKuJRSbL49pv0xN0+=EVWAMkNtkTBw@mail.gmail.com>

I currently have a data set that I am trying to work with using Paraview.
 It is a set of Lagrangian particles that are moving through the domain
over time.  What I need to do is calculate the surface coverage of these
particles that adhere to a wall.  This would involve determining which
particles have been adsorbed (probably an 'if' statement involved here),
calculating the surface area coverage of each particle (easy enough), and
then summing up these values across all particles.  That last part has got
me stumped.  Is there a way I could do this with the Calculator?  Python
calculator?  Or would I be best served by using a Programmable Filter?  In
any case, how would I go about summing up a property across all particles
to obtain a single value to be plotted over time?

Hi everybody,

I'd like to understand what is happening with a client-server connection
I'm trying to create in PV-3.14.1.

pvserver is running on a SGI Altix ICE compiled with OpenMPI 1.6 and Mesa
library for offscreen rendering. Everything run smoothly from the
compilation and installation but when I try to connect with a client (same
version), they can't get connected. The machine runs Torque batch system
but I certified that pvserver was running after the client. Tests I've done
to remove some common problems.

1). Client and server in the same network

case a). Server running in the computing nodes under Torque batch system.
Nothing happens. pvserver just sits with the following message:

Connecting to client (reverse connection requested)...
Connection URL: csrc://my.client.local.ip:11111

case b). Server running in the fron-end interactively (launched from
command line). It would remove problems due to batch system and NAT not
running in the computing nodes but the same message posted before appears
and nothing happens.

In both cases I also did tests with client's firewall turned off with
similar result (nothing happens)

2). Client running remotely.

Same behavior mentioned before.

The question is: Is there a "verbose mode reverse connection" that could
help me understand what is happening?

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks

Renato,

Here's what I get the server spewing when I run "pvserver --rc"
without any client already running:

------------------------------
Connecting to client (reverse connection requested)...
Connection URL: csrc://miranda:11111
ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Kitware/ParaView3/ParaView/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx,
line 481
vtkClientSocket (0xfbc520): Socket error in call to connect. Connection refused.

ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Kitware/ParaView3/ParaView/VTK/Common/System/vtkClientSocket.cxx,

ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Kitware/ParaView3/ParaView/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx,

------------------------------

Thus if the socket connection failed, it should start reporting error
and attempting again. Since the server totally just freezes, even when
no client is waiting for it at the other end, I am getting somehow the
BSD socket "connect" call is never returning success or failure.

Try this: from the server node, try to telnet to you client host/port.
Does that work?

Hi Utkarsh,

neither an error message I get from pvserver. It just keep waiting for
connection until exit due to time out... the client stays there with the
"waiting for server connection" screen open and nothing happens.

I'm not familiar with telnet commands but tried the following:

telnet> open my.ip.external.address 11111
Trying my.ip.external.address...

and it just hangs trying to connect.

The client in this test is a Macbook running Lion. I've tried with the
firewall open and closed as well.

Any more hints?

Renato.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting String arrays out of Field Data
Message-ID: <CC6E106F.18B0%Joshua.Murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,

I have written a custom filter for Heliospheric data, and I am placing the model metadata into the Field Data section of ParaView.

Many of the metadata items are strings. I can view these strings just fine in Spread Sheet view, but anytime I try to get them out of Field Data via python, I get a null value return.  Doubles and Ints return just fine, but I cannot seem to figure out how to get the strings.

Can someone point me in the right direction for retrieving the strings from Field Data via Python?

Thanks,

I think that's you first clue. The fact that even telnet cannot
connect back to your client machine/port indicates that something is
either blocking the connection or it's just getting lost in the
network. Does ping "my.ip.external.address" work from the server host?

Hi Utkarsh,

I guess we've found the problem. The connection was really getting lost in
our local network. After tweaking some servers in our lab, the things are
now working.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: [Paraview] Maximize ParaView across 3 monitors; NVIDIA
Message-ID: <5048C0E7.2080902@mst.edu>

Software: Ubuntu 12.04.1 running Xfce4
Hardware: Microway 1U rack, 1 x NVidia Quadro 5000, 1 x Tesla C2050 
(access to more teslas), 3 x Dells S500 projectors, 1 x totally awesome 
custom built immersive screen :)

*Goal:* Maximize ParaView across all three monitors for seamless 
integration.

*Problem:* the Quadro 5000 supports only 2 monitors which means we need 
a second GPU. Second GPU means second X screen and, as far as I know, a 
window can not be maximized across two X screens.

*Help:* What are my options for maximizing ParaView across all three 
monitors?

*Known solutions:* The only solution I've found so far is to use an AMD 
card. Two problems with that: 1) the driver setup is supposed to be a 
real PITA, 2) we don't have a FirePro sitting around to try out, so that 
would mean buying one.

I'm open to changing up the software stack if you know of something that 
will work.

Thanks,
David Zemon

Hmm, I tried with the WholeExtent of (-100, 100, -100, 100, -100, 100) on
my machine and still didn't have problems. How much memory is on your
system? I'd hate to think that ParaView is that poor with memory
management. If I remember correctly, we used to have nightly dashboards
running valgrind. I know that Bill Lorensen's project last fall was going
through with valgrind to get rid of a bunch of memory issues.

Well, the good news is that I think I have a better solution for you
anyways. I get the feeling from your original script that you have a
separate file for each time step and each component of your vector field.
If all components of your vector field are in the same file you can ignore
the first part of the steps below. Here's the solution:

1) load all of the files for the first time step (e.g. load the
<filename>..<file extention>
2) use control and select all the file readers
3) use the append attributes filter to combine the fields from each input
data set into a single output dataset (it assumes that the input data sets
all have the same number of points and cells and the desired fields all
have different names -- use the calculator filter to change the field names
if needed)
<if all of the fields are in the same file, start here after loading the
file>
4) create a calculator filter
4a) compute the magnitude by inputting in "mag(<x component field
name>*iHat + <y component field name>*jHat + <z component field
name>*kHat)" for the widget right above the calculator buttons
4b) if you want a specific name for the newly created field, set it in
Result Array Name

Let me know if this accomplishes your goal.

Hi David,

I have heard that GTK 590 supports up to three monitors.

http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-590/features

There is an alternative via X extensions (with second GPU), it seemed to

I am just starting to read this thread so I wanted to answer various
questions here separately.

Your assumption is correct. m = x*x will be 100% evaluated by NumPy. In
theory, this should be pretty much instantaneous for ~1M elements, even for
20 timeslices.

When you have a time series, the programmable filter will work on the
current time step only. So if you animate or change time through the GUI,
the filter should update properly. But each execution of the filter would
work only on 1 timestep.

Given the trivial amount of data involved, I can't imagine this being a
memory leak. Maybe if it hung after 10 time steps... Do you have a way of
verifying that your numpy installation works properly? So for example, what
happens if you do this in the programmable filter:

import numpy
a = numpy.arange(1000000)
m = a * a

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin License question
Message-ID: <5048CE6B.4060909@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

In our lab we use a home made plugin to read the solutions files of ours 
computations.
The plugin is written in c++ (using Qt for the UI, xdmf for the storage 
and blas for the calculations).
So nothing else that the libraries downloaded during a Superbuild and Qt

The question is, can I put only the binary of the plugin in a webpage 
for free ???

We don't want to put the source of the plugin because is in constant 
development.
I don't know a lot about the Qt licenses (commercial LGPL).

Any advice ?

I'm looking into X extensions now.

Thank you for the link to the 590. It's very promising. I dug into their 
website a bit more and it looks like 3D Vision Surround is only 
supported on Windows. It's good to know it's out there as an option, but 
hopefully X extensions will get us going without switching OSes and 
buying a new card.

Thanks,
David

Great. Also have a look at this link:
http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Using_Multiple_Screens . I forgot all the
details but in our setup we have six node cluster each having a independent
card and we were able to get it working with x extensions but again it was
couple of years ago and I forgot all the details.

I just ran this with a 500^3 wavelet on my machine without any problems.
The whole thing (including a slice filter) takes 20-30 seconds but the
programmable filter is actually pretty much instantaneous (<0.1 seconds)
using a debug build from Git master. Is there any way you can attach to the
stuck ParaView with a debugger and look at the stack trace?

What method are you using to get the array from the vtkDataSetAttributes instance that holds the field data? You need to use GetAbstractArray instead of GetArray. Below is a small example that gets string values from cell data on the political.vtp file included in VTKData. If you have an example file with strings in field data, I can take a look at that, too. It should be as simple as replacing the GetCellData() method with GetFieldData().

	David

from vtk import *
rdr = vtkXMLPolyDataReader()
rdr.SetFileName( '/path/to/VTKData/Data/political.vtp' )
rdr.Update();
mesh = rdr.GetOutput()
cd = mesh.GetCellData()
print 'Should have 3 cell data arrays', cd.GetNumberOfArrays()
cd.GetArray(0) # Returns None
sa = cd.GetAbstractArray(0)
print 'Array has %d tuples (should be 980)' % sa.GetNumberOfTuples()
print 'Should be Albania:', sa.GetVariantValue(1).ToString()

I am going to disagree with Andy about this being a better solution. I
don't even think that it addresses what Frank is trying to do. But beyond
that Array Calculator is cumbersome and slow compared to the Python
Calculator or Python Programmable Filter.

As far as I understand, Frank is not trying to combine components from
different files. He is trying to combine components written as different
arrays in the same file hence the need for sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z). I think
that Andy is confused by inputs[0] - that's simple the way to access the
input (even if there is only one) of the Python Programmable Filter.

Thanks for the replies!

At the moment, I need to finish a poster for a presentation on Saturday, but promise to get to this Sunday or Monday. (I'll need to re-build a debugging version of paraview. Any hints on how to accomplish this within ccmake/cmake will be gratefully received, since that system is new to me too. Is it as simple as setting a CCFLAGS environment variable before invoking make -- or something similar??)

I also found that the 200**3 wavelet worked fine on my paraview-compiled-from-source Linux installation. Let's ignore the problem I found on the OSX box with the binary installer for the moment. (One problem at a time!)

Because of that, I'm now suspicious of the upstream code that writes .vtu files.

Also, responding here to your later comment from your next email:

Actually, there is one file per component per timeslice.

I've had a quick look at the file format written by my upstream simulator. It's very simple.  Maybe I should just write the .vtu files from within my own script that reads the upstream meshes to avoid any other potential problems with the upstream codes. 

Does paraview.simple have an easy way to construct a field vector at the location of arbitrary points? If so, I think the Python script to do *that* will be faster than me trying to chase all of this down?

Thanks again for the advice!

Cheers,
	Frank Horowitz

Hi Joshua,

Sorry, in my previous e-mail I forgot this was the ParaView and not VTK mailing list, so I posted a vtkpython script. What I said still applies if you are using the Python Programmable Filter, but of course you can use ParaView to load the dataset.

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
s=pdi.GetCellData().GetAbstractArray(0)
print s.GetVariantValue(1).ToString()
# Just copy the input to make ParaView happy:
pdo.DeepCopy( pdi )

This works for me with the political.vtp dataset

  http://vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTKData.git;a=blob_plain;f=Data/political.vtp;hb=HEAD


Does that address your problem? Or are you writing client-side python scripts using the simple interface to retrieve metadata from the server?

Thank you! I was using GetArray(), as I had no idea that
GetAbstractArray() even existed! (tab complete in the Python Shell doesn't
recognize it, and that is how I find most things as I learn how various
things work).

Again, Thank you very much! This solves a big problems for us!

Just to make sure that I understand this: you have some code that reads
some files in a proprietary format and spits out 1 vtu file per component?
What is that format like? What is the script written in? It should be
pretty easy to change that script to combine components together and write
them out as a vector. You could also calculate derived quantities there and
write them to the vtu file. Or you could still calculate that using the
Programmable Filter.

Robert,

I have looked into this and the QT team are making adjustments to support HiDPI:
https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-23870

QT 5 beta is not "HiDPI" ready yet...

I don't know how difficult it would be after to update Paraview to support the same capabilities.
The temporary workaround affects only the fonts; icons and main window remain blurry.

Thanks

PO

Hi All,

After the "Client connected." message, the following error will occur
on the remote server:

ERROR: In /home/luoj/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/VTK/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx,
line 812
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x1347e8a0): Could not receive tag. 1

And the client on the window side will also stop working.

So how can I solve this problem?

Best,
Jian

Subject: [Paraview] Manipulating Big Data through Python Shell
Message-ID: <6289DC22EA162C41A962AF42ACB7E737233CFF32@SN2PRD0106MB176.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Today I uploaded two videos to Youtube, showing the basics of what is happening. They can be found via the following links:

1.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68yeT8t0TUc&feature=youtu.be

2.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Linns_iSBro&feature=youtu.be


The init.py file used now uses "renView.InteractiveRender()" instead of just "Render()", as suggested by Utkarsh. (Thank you again for that suggestion by the way!)

The first video is the mouse-based manipulation of 20MB of earthquake data. As shown, LOD is not active and my computer has no problem panning, rotating, etc. in near real-time.

Now in the second video you see how ParaView acts when using the Wii Nunchuk. The first part, without LOD active, you can see the extreme delay after I let go. After turning on LOD, the rendering speed does improve quite a bit but it is still not nearly as instantaneous as the mouse is without LOD. Also the data doesn't fully re-render after releasing the joystick; a mouse click is still required. I think I can remedy that just by sending "Render()" when the joystick is released.

So my current goal is to get the Wii Nunchuk application running the ParaView rendering at least at 90% of the capacity of what the mouse can, only using LOD if it is required when using the mouse also. I'm clueless as what else I can do with sending commands to the Python Shell to speed things up.  Are there any ideas of how to reach this goal from where I am now? Whether it be improving the current process of sending Python commands or using a completely different process of manipulating the rendering from an external application.

Also here is some more insight as to what the Wii application is actually doing in terms of interacting with ParaView. Just in case it could be useful information:


1.       The application is written in C++. During initialization, it connects to the server socket and loads the init.py file through the following commands:

svr.sin_family = AF_INET;
svr.sin_port = htons(9000);
inet_aton("127.0.0.1", &svr.sin_addr);
s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
connect(s, (const sockaddr*)&svr, sizeof(sockaddr_in));
write(s, "execfile('init.py')", sizeof("execfile('init.py')"));


2.       From there, every time the joystick is moved outside of its "deadzone" the following lines are ran:

stringstream ss;
ss.str(std::string());
ss << "command(" << x_value << "," << y_value << ");";
const std::string temp = ss.str();
const char* cstr = temp.c_str();
write(s, cstr, strlen(cstr));


3.       I'm pretty sure that it is not the C++ side of my Wii application slowing things down. Using 'printf()'s, all the 'write()'s happen and finish without any noticeable delay.

I'm still open to any suggestions out there! All help is very appreciated :)

Thanks,

Travis J. Bueter

It's even simpler than setting CCFLAGS to turn debug information on. Just
set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to "Debug". It may already be set to that.

If you're creating your VTK files from Python code, you may want to look at
PyEVTK (https://bitbucket.org/pauloh/pyevtk). I haven't tried the
unstructured grid/vtu writer from that but have tried the image data writer
from it.

Subject: [Paraview] Pixie reader
Message-ID: <504A16A6.1030002@oato.inaf.it>

Dear users,

    I am not able to open a very simple HDF5 "Pixie" file with the last
    version of Paraview (3.14), while the same file is correctly opened
    and visualized by previous versions (3.12 ... 3.10) and by other
    visualization softwares (ex. Visit, up to version 2.5.2). The file
    contains a few multidimensional datasets gathered as a group
    and the corresponding grid. Everything is defined for only one
    cycle (Timestep). Therefore I did not define any Timestep_# group.
    I am sorry, I am not able to provide more details, but Paraview
    crashes after trying to select the Pixie format, without giving any
    debug hint.

    Do you know if there is any backward compatibility issue related
    to the Pixie reader, or if something has changed since version 3.12?
    I am using the 3.14 version of the precompiled binary distribution
    for MAC OSX 64-bit Intel.

    Thanks in advance for any help/suggestion.

    Claudio

Subject: [Paraview] Can I stop the verbiage that occurs when I start
	paraview?
Message-ID: <CAM9occi-XfazCzgOm89TMkMx9=HdZ+AbF_KSdv2befzpmBs5QA@mail.gmail.com>

I am new to paraview and vtk. (The paraview page I was on, pointed me here
. . .)

When I start paraview (v.3.14.1, 64-bit), as installed using aptitude on
ubuntu 12.04.

I get dozens of messages that I don't understand, upon issuing 'paraview
&', or any
other approach I have taken.  Examples are below.

Paraview seems to work OK, though I am using it for simple visualizations
right now.
I do not remember having this problem (at least not to this extent) when
using a previous
version of paraview. (I think it was 3.4, which was the version supplied
via aptitude for
ubuntu 10.04.)

Is there a way to stop the messages, even if it is just asking it to run in
"quiet mode"?

Thanks,
Tim

If you don't care what it says, you can do: 

paraview 2&> /dev/null & 

which will pipe all output to the void.

Subject: [Paraview] Can I stop the verbiage that occurs when I start paraview? 

I am new to paraview and vtk. (The paraview page I was on, pointed me here . . .) 


When I start paraview (v.3.14.1, 64-bit), as installed using aptitude on ubuntu 12.04. 


I get dozens of messages that I don't understand, upon issuing 'paraview &', or any 
other approach I have taken. Examples are below. 


Paraview seems to work OK, though I am using it for simple visualizations right now. 
I do not remember having this problem (at least not to this extent) when using a previous 
version of paraview. (I think it was 3.4, which was the version supplied via aptitude for 
ubuntu 10.04.) 


Is there a way to stop the messages, even if it is just asking it to run in "quiet mode"? 


Thanks, 
Tim

Hi all,


I'm now postprocessing polyhedral CFD sources.
The attached file is U-bend model which I solved.
* Polyhedral Sources are large, so I archived it by bzip2.

When I convert cell data to point data and generate Stream Tracer
from the Inlet, the streamlines go through the U-bend wall.
If I export same model as a tetrahedral source, they go to the outlet.

I think the problem depends on some issues of handling polyhedral cells.
Could I generate appropriate streamlines with polyhedral sources?

Subject: [Paraview] Getting point values on pvbatch
Message-ID: <E57700B2-D89F-43E6-BCCC-2D3E3541E561@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to get point values from several sources on pvbatch.
I'm using ParaView 3.14.1 with local client (single CPU) mode.

My pipeline is as below:

source.vtm
| --CellDatatoPointData1
|   |-/ResampleWithDataset1 (Input)
|   --IntegrateVariables1
|-Line1
| --/ResampleWithDataset1 (Source)
--ResampleWithDataset1

The original source (source.vtm) is XML MultiBlock including "Pressure" values.

Now I'm debugging my codes on Python Shell.
First I get sources as below:
>>> GetSources().keys()
[('IntegrateVariables1', '2579'), ('CellDatatoPointData1', '2293'), ('source.vtm', '2175'), ('ResampleWithDataset1', '2490'), ('Line1', '2305')]
>>> original = GetSources()[("source.vtm", "2175")]
>>> source = GetSources()[("CellDatatoPointData1", "2293")]
>>> integrate = GetSources()[("IntegrateVariables1", "2579")]
>>> line = GetSources()[("Line1", "2305")]
>>> resample = GetSources()[("ResampleWithDataset1", "2490")]

And all sources are grabbed successfully:
>>> original
<paraview.servermanager.XMLMultiBlockDataReader object at 0x11d81c4d0>
>>> source
<paraview.servermanager.CellDatatoPointData object at 0x11d81c490>
>>> integrate
<paraview.servermanager.IntegrateVariables object at 0x11d81c3d0>
>>> line
<paraview.servermanager.Line object at 0x11d81c450>
>>> resample
<paraview.servermanager.ResampleWithDataset object at 0x11d81c390>

Next I want to get these values:
a) original's coordXs, coordYs, coordZs
b) source's Pressures
c) integrate's Pressures
d) resample's Pressures

For example, I can get Pressure's range as below:
>>> source.PointData.GetArray("Pressure").GetRange()
But I'm missing to get each points' raw values,
and I can't find where the points' coordinates are.
Fortunately I can only get integrated value with GetRange()[0],
but I think it's not a good way.

How can I get each points' or integrated raw values and coordinates with Python?

Hi,
   There is probably a bug in handling point location for polyhedron. I
have opened a bug with your file (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13442
).

   We will fix this fairly soon.

thanks for reporting it!

Leo

Hi All,

OK, attaching the debugger found the problem.

My data were underflowing from the squaring operation, and the numpy exception was not being caught or explicitly ignored.

My workaround in the programmable filter is to call numpy's seterr function and it's square function.

The relevant code snippet looks like:

seterr(all='ignore')

m = sqrt(square(x) + square(y) + square(z))


Strangely enough, calling seterr(under='ignore') still hangs with an uncaught numpy underflow exception, but "all='ignore'" works.

This kind of problem is probably old hat to experienced paraview users, but perhaps paraview can be setup to catch and report such exceptions to avoid the kind of surprises I faced as a new user? (I'll leave it up to you to decide whether this should be considered a bug report or a feature request.)

In any case, for completeness in case it helps someone else via Googling a similar problem, the full code that works for me is:

--- code start ---
x = inputs[0].PointData['Scalars_'] # replace the literal string 'Scalars_' with whatever your data is named up the pipeline
y = inputs[1].PointData['Scalars_'] # Ditto
z = inputs[2].PointData['Scalars_'] # Ditto

seterr(all='ignore') # Instruct numpy to ignore exceptions. 
m = sqrt(square(x)+square(y)+square(z))

output.PointData.append(m,'magnitude')

--- code end ---

Thanks again for all of the help!

Hi,

I just found this thread, sorry I didn't join earlier!  Thanks for
uploading those movies, the second one really helps demonstrate the lag
issue.

Well, I'm almost certain the issue is that ParaViewSocketPlugin doesn't
work very well for this type of high frequency rendering.  I've been
working on a similar remote control app, but instead of using a Wiimote to
send camera manipulations, it uses KiwiViewer on iOS/Android (I'll get a
movie uploaded and send you the url.)  I also started with
ParaViewSocketPlugin, but had to drop it in favor of a different design.
So lets say the Wiimote program is sending 100 updates a second, but
ParaView renders at a slower rate, lets say 30 fps for example.  While
ParaViewSocketPlugin is handling the very first message from the Wiimote,
it receives 3 more.  The problem is that it then processes the next
message, instead of merging all 3 of those messages to a single camera
manipulation.  The longer you interact, ParaViewSocketPlugin falls further
and further behind.  Normally, we don't worry about any of these details
when using a mouse, because Qt talks with X11 and merges pending mouse
events.

Here's a quick hack that might work: in your python code, instead of
calling Render(), or doing any work that requires a non trivial amount of
time, just store the updated camera parameters and return as soon as
possible.  Next, modify the Qt code in ParaViewSocketPlugin to create a
QTimer that fires at 30 hz.  Connect the QTimer to a slot callback that
execs a python code to take the current camera parameters and Render().
Hopefully, the result is that the messages arriving on the socket in
ParaViewSocketPlugin empty instantly, and ParaView renders at 30 hz using
the latest camera parameters.

Alternative designs could remove the QTimer and integrate better with the
Qt event loop, so that the Wiimote sends events just like a mouse does.  An
advantage of something like ParaViewSocketPlugin is that you have more
flexibility because you can exec arbitrary python code.

About your second inquiry: I'm not sure what you mean by "link" in this 
context. In XDMF, a column or row of a HDF matrix can be accessed using 
the HyperSlab dataitem with a count value of one. You can then use an 
XPath reference to attach a name tag to that subset of your matrix. A 
more specific example of what you're trying to do might be helpful here.

Best, Jens.

Hi Frank,

I'm glad you got a workaround in place.  We'll put this in the bug tracker
so it can get fixed.  ParaView should catch the exception or warning and
report it properly without hanging!

For those following along, here is a simple way to trigger the hang:

import numpy
numpy.ones(1)/0

In a terminal, numpy will print "RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered
in divide", but in ParaView the program will hang.  The actual hang is
coming from a tricky interaction between ParaView and Python's C-API.  In
fact, depending on your version of numpy, or whether it was built with
thread support, this might not hang.  Last month I sent an email to the
paraview-developers mailing list with the subject line "Scipy with ParaView
is broken" where I describe the issue in more detail.  Unfortunately, the
hang that Frank encountered is another case of the same bug sneaking up and
biting someone!

Pat

Subject: [Paraview]  How to visualize the full Delaunay 3d triangulation
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1WgNiWBGdh_JkMYcxC+O5h7JRBntDgfHAcKZ2t8Z2WLTcA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have a (small and random) set of 3D points, and I am applying on them the
Delaunay 3D filter. I can visualize
the triangulation on the surface after plotting with the "Surface with
edges" option. But, I need
also to see the internal triangulation. If I use the clip filter, I can see
some intersections of the
Delaunay cells with the plane clip, but this is not easy to interpret. What
I would like to know is
if there is a way to visualize the full triangulation , maybe with lines or
the tube filter.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards / Cordialmente,

William-Fernando Oquendo

Try extract edges filter. That and the shrink filter help see the mesh.

Well, this is just amazing. Thanks for the fast and useful answers. Sorry
for not having detected those filters before.

Hi,

With the latest git-master, ParaView/Examples/Plugins/VisItReader
fails to configure with cmake stating that cmake command
"ADD_VISIT_PLUGIN_READER" is unknown. Is this a known problem?

If anyone is curious, I am trying to update a Shapefile reader plugin
which I have pulled from VisIt
(https://gitorious.org/avtshapefilefileformat_plugin) to work with the
latest master and having the same issue.

Hello,
I'm working with Code-Saturne to simulate an air flux, including particles which I need to sample on a plate. I know ParaView is able to show off my "trajectory" and "displacement" (outputs from Code-Saturne), selecting "Filters -> Cell Point to Data Point"; but when I open my file DISPLACEMENT.CASE and TRAJECTORY.CASE with ParaView I don't find this filter on the Taskbar.How can I show off particles and ther trajecotries?

Subject: [Paraview] Very slow performance in Parallel mode
Message-ID: <49F00635638246EBBE63AD50ABE99B97@gmail.com>

Hi there, 
I have made some experiments to see how running paraview in parallel mode can help me visualize my data more faster. 
First I ran paraview on my Macbook pro with a sphere source which has about 90MB data. It's running smoothly without considerable annoyance. Then I tried to run the same dataset on ONE cluster node with 48 CPU cores. I started the paraview with the following command:
# mpirun -np 48  /share/apps/Paraview3/bin/pvserver -display :0

Then I connected to the server with my Macbook to render the same dataset. But I noticed a great deal on performance degradation. It was so hard to rotate and manipulate the object in 3d view. I am surprised by this issue! Do you know the reason?

Thanks,

So, is there any way to dynamically assign number of CPU cores to the visualization process?

I am not sure ? I am on a cluster with a scheduler, so cores are selected before the visualisation work starts. Generally the size of the data is known in advance so the processors needed to process that data have already been worked out. We are normally dealing with raw image data, if I have 148M dataset it works best with one core, and I max out a 12 core node with a 10G dataset (with two NVIDIA M2070Qs).  You can have different configurations on  the server side and select them as needed.

That's a known problem. It happened when we modularized ParaView's build
system a couple of weeks ago. It will be fixed before 4.0.

Thanks for your reply. Is there any place which I can download sample datasets with different sizes?  
BTW, I have two GPUs installed on my node. I'm not sure whether paraview uses both of them. Is there anyway to force paraview use both of them?

This is what I use for a 12 core node ? points half the data at one display and half at the other (assuming the x server is configured that way)

 

mpirun -v -hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE -bynode -np 6 /usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver --server-port=11112 -display :0.1 : -np 6 /usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver -display :0.0

 

If you want test data of increasing size ? I guess the best approach it to generate it in ParaView itself e.g. waveform source and contour it, then just make it bigger and bigger J

BTW, I have two GPUs installed on my node. I'm not sure whether paraview uses both of them. Is there anyway to force paraview use both of them?

I am not sure ? I am on a cluster with a scheduler, so cores are selected before the visualisation work starts. Generally the size of the data is known in advance so the processors needed to process that data have already been worked out. We are normally dealing with raw image data, if I have 148M dataset it works best with one core, and I max out a 12 core node with a 10G dataset (with two NVIDIA M2070Qs).  You can have different configurations on  the server side and select them as needed.

So, is there any way to dynamically assign number of CPU cores to the visualization process?

Subject: [Paraview] Very slow performance in Parallel mode

 

Hi there, 

I have made some experiments to see how running paraview in parallel mode can help me visualize my data more faster. 

First I ran paraview on my Macbook pro with a sphere source which has about 90MB data. It's running smoothly without considerable annoyance. Then I tried to run the same dataset on ONE cluster node with 48 CPU cores. I started the paraview with the following command:

# mpirun -np 48  /share/apps/Paraview3/bin/pvserver -display :0

 

Then I connected to the server with my Macbook to render the same dataset. But I noticed a great deal on performance degradation. It was so hard to rotate and manipulate the object in 3d view. I am surprised by this issue! Do you know the reason?

 

Thanks,

Hi,

Is your reader and/or data set time dependent? For the Particle Path,
Particle Tracer, and Streakline filters you'll need multiple time steps as
well as a vector array. The information tab should give you the number of
components in your arrays as well as the time and time steps.

Message-ID: <CAO73BAABuN+vE_cHw88ghBNJMDpcJaGV6e=_e7mkjTiqp-W3vA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to visualize a 2D tecplot file with the following format:

 TITLE = "title"
     VARIABLES="R (cm)","Z (cm)",
        "SIGMA     ",
        "EAMB-R    ",
        "EAMB-Z    ",
...
        "TG-AVE    ",
        "I MFLUX-R ",
        "I MFLUX-Z ",
        "ION-TOT   "
     ZONE  I= 76, J= 37, F=BLOCK,
           T="2-D DATA"
  0.000E+00  2.867E-01  5.733E-01  8.600E-01  1.147E+00  1.433E+00  1.720E+00

...


I can read the file using the tecplot reader, but don't know how to
visualize it.

I guess, I need to tell paraview to use the R & Z vectors to build a
grid, and then re-sample all the other variables on this grid.  But I
have not been able to figure out how to do that.

Thank you,

Mirko

 coprocessing?
Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A2F18A51B@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi Andy,

Sorry, I lost track of where I was in debugging. What I had was an openmpi/pgi debug build that passed the ctest -R CoPro tests. But the app I'm working on still crashes when trying to create a python interpreter.

I started over from scratch working with the Wiki example, using gcc 4.4.6 and mpich2 1.4.1p1.

I have the C++ wiki example working with both the ParaView-3.14.1-Source tarball and with git commit 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a.

I then made a Fortran version of the wiki example. It works with the ParaView-3.14.1-Source tarball build, but crashes when built against the git branch build. Seems to be at the same spot as the pgi build, when it tries to return the python interpreter instance. I stepped through with gdb and don't see anything obvious. It seems to crash when it tries to create an interpreter to add the python script to the module search path.

Glad to hear that it's working. As for the parallel test failure, I think you can ignore that for now. I need to fix it but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. I think it's either a parallel rendering/compositing issue or a problem with the actors's visibility in the views getting screwed up. Both of those things are not my area of expertise so I've been reluctant to go and fix it. Now that you've publicly shamed me I'm going to have to bite the bullet and fix it :)  Hopefully by the end of next week it will be fixed. I created a mantis issue (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13417) if you want to follow it.

Hi Andy,
Not sure what changed, but I was able to build pgi/openmpi and got to the point you did below, where the parallel test fails with "CPGrid0 image compare failed."
Can I ignore this error? Anyway, the python interpreter seems to be created, so that issue is closed.

Ok, glad to hear that coprocessing is working in some fashion. Now to figure out how to get it running properly with your desired configuration. Unfortunately at this point I don't know how to move forward except for trying to piecemeal from having it working with GCC without everything you need to working with PGI, CUDA and everything else.

I should mention I do have a gcc, mvapich2 compiled version of coprocessing compiled on Forge and it works great. However any program built with PGI/openmpi code (required because of the CUDA Fortran) crashes with MPI errors. That's why I was trying to build ParaView with PGI/openmpi. I guess I could try gcc/openmpi and see if that linked to pgi/openmpi will run.

Hmm, ParaView has been undergoing a lot of changes lately so it's been a bit unstable. I just checked out a clean version and built it without any problems. The SHA from that was 2537cabbf0cc9b39f17f347105ee18c559d0041a. What version are you on?

Have you tried building with GCC instead of PGI? I'm thinking of ways to simplify the build since I haven't tried building with PGI+CUDA+MPI+Python myself.

Hi Mark,

With the modularization of VTK and ParaView the coprocessing tests were temporarily in a bad state. The serial ones are fixed now (the parallel runs but gives incorrect results for the screenshot). Is it possible for you to update your version of ParaView and retry this?

Not possible for most, if not all, tests. The reason is that the test doesn't get added unless ParaViewData is available.

And 2, is there a way to tell ctest to not use MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS when running tests?

Many parallel tests, including the parallel coprocessing test, usually just have it hard coded to use 2 or 4 processes for testing.

It looks like you've built it properly. At least I don't see anything that looks wrong. I think the reason you didn't get any coprocessing tests is that they depend on ParaViewDAta. Maybe the next step is to download ParaViewData (git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git<http://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git>) and then set the location ParaViewData in cmake. After that, run the coprocessing tests (ctest -R CoProcess) and show me the output from that.

Hi Mark,

I think I can guess what the problem is but can't be certain without some more information. My guess is that you're using ParaView 3.14.1 for this and you're trying to use the fortran interface but haven't built ParaView with Python enabled. There were some dependency issues there that have been ironed out since then though. If that's not the case though I'll need more information on versions and maybe sending your CMakeCache.txt in your ParaView build directory.

Subject: [Paraview] Installing ParaViewWeb problems
Message-ID: <DB1F13D025214E218D97DC7240237BD6@gmail.com>

Hi there, 
I tried to install ParaViewWeb on my Macbook Pro. I have compiled and installed ParaView 3.14.1 from it's source. Also, other prerequisites packages. So I believe that using SuperBuild is not suitable for me. Then I decided to install it manually with the help of the following url:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb_Building 

But I faced with many problems.
First it gives me the following error when I run the 'make' command:

/Users/Projects/WebViz/ParaViewWeb/ParaViewAdapter/vtkPWProcessingEngine.cxx:439:19: error: no member named 'SetInputData' in 'vtkJPEGWriter'; did you mean 'SetInput'?

make[1]: *** [ParaViewAdapter/CMakeFiles/PWServer.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2



I replaced all of SetInputData instances with SetInput. It fixed the problem but after that another problem came out:
Linking CXX executable PWServer
ld: library not found for -lvtkPVServerManagerApplication
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make[2]: *** [ParaViewAdapter/PWServer] Error 1
make[1]: *** [ParaViewAdapter/CMakeFiles/PWServer.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


For temporarily fixing this problem I removed the vtkPVServerManagerApplication from CMakeLists.txt. Then It compiled without error. But I think it would be not working properly in the future.
Is there any clue?

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am using Paraview for a small project purpose. Since I have CGNS 3.1 files, I tried to compile Paraview from git-master with Visit-CGNS reader enabled. Unfortunately, it crashes complaining about HDF5 symbols not found. I guess I need to specify somewhere that the CGNS library is using hdf5 and link against it but I am at a loss. Has anyone encountered this problem and know how to solve it ?
 And one more thing, is there a plan to import the latest CGNS reader from Visit to get more fixes ?

I am calling paraview from fortran code that I am developing.

I am using system calls to load states; very nice.

Specifically, I use 'load state' to create a view of an isosurface.
I now save taht data (manually, as a ply file), and read the file

Is there a way, hopefully w/o learning python (at this time), to
save files within paraview - without my intervention?

Thanks,

Have you looked at the coprocessing features (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing) in ParaView yet? That sounds a lot
like what you're trying to do but should let you avoid the file IO and may
give you some more flexibility.

Tarball attached, it's not exactly the wiki example because I didn't want to bother with passing a DataGenerator object back and forth from C++ to Fortran, so I just make a sphere. The pipeline script is a shrink filter generated by pvclient.

I checked CMake and it looks like it's finding the same version of python.

You should be able to use the super build, but you need to switch to the
release branch of ParaViewWeb is you are using a ParaView released version
such as 3.14.
In either case, you need to switch to the release branch if you want to use
a ParaView release version and not the git master one.

The ParaViewWeb/master is based on ParaView/master which integrate the API
changes
that VTK is bringing.

Thanks for your reply. So do I have to uninstall my current working Paraview 3.14.1 installation before running PW SuperBuild?
It's very annoying that SuperBuild tries to download the prerequisite packages every time I run it. I have installed all of the packages. Why doesn't it let me enter the necessary paths to the installed packages?

Is there an easy way to see the interfaces? I have a pressure

Subject: [Paraview] c++ Plug-in in Mac, compatibility with official binary??
Message-ID: <5051BBE8.9090305@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

I build Paraview 3.14.1 (git version) using superbuild using qt v 4.6.4 
(cocoa) in my mac.

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:string=Release -D 
PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_PLUGIN_DIRS:STRING="/Users/fbordeu/ParaView/ParaviewPXDMFReader;/Users/fbordeu/ParaView/AnnotateFieldData" 
-D PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT:BOOL=ON -D 
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/Users/fbordeu/ParaView/builds/ParaViewSuperBuild_dist 
-D VTK_USE_COCOA=ON -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -D 
CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 -D 
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk  -D 
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=OFF -D 
QT_QTUITOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/QtUiTools/ 
/Users/fbordeu/ParaView/ParaView/SuperBuild/

Remark :
the page : http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Binaries said that the 
official binary use 10.5 SDK
but the page http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Superbuild  said 
"ParaView Super-Build has only been tested for x86_64 architecture using 
10.6 (Snow Leopard) SDK. " (I know that this page is under construction).

compilation runs fine and packaging run also fine.

cd 
/Users/fbordeu/ParaView/builds/ParaViewSuperBuild_bin/ParaView-build/Applications/ParaView; 
cpack -G DragNDrop -C Release --config CPackParaViewConfig.cmake

THE PROBLEM:

my plugin is linked to a series of libraries (that I dont use), and they 
are not distributed inside de official binary. So my plug in is not 
compatible with the official binary

any idea???

Felipe

Hi Arya,

I've wrote that super build to simplify installation when you start from
nothing and unfortunately, I never had more time to make it more flexible.
If you feel that you could contribute that in the SuperBuild, I'd be happy
to integrate it.

If you already download and build the components, then just use the regular
source tree for CMake instead of the SuperBuild, and you will be able to
build ParaViewWeb.

Hi Ian,

You mention ver 3.14 and loading state files. so to me it sounds likely 
to be a different bug. if the xdmf reader makes use of the new 
properties panel it may have been fixed. All of this is pure speculation 
on my part. Kyle is the authority.

Subject: [Paraview] selected points change when clip plane changes
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E05097ACF@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I have observed a strange behavior: when I select points in a 3D geometry where the clip filter has been applied, and then change the position of the clip plane, the selected points jump to completely other positions. Is there an explanation for this behaviour? How can I make the points stay where they are?

Thank you,

Matthias

Hi David,

thank you for the hint, but it doesn't seem to do what I want.
My workflow was:
1. Display 3D geometry, color by temperature
2. Apply clip filter
3. Select some points
4. Apply extract selection filter
5. Change position of plane of clip filter
Result: After step 5, the points are at totally different locations.
Does ParaView renumber the points when the clip filter is applied? IMHO it shouldn't...

Matthias

Apply the extract selection filter.

This should copy your selected points into a new object.
Nothing with you do with the clip filter should alter it.

Yes every vtk filter creates a new object when the filter's parameters
change. Especially when the topology changes (consider the extreme
case of clipping away everything), there is no guarantee of
correspondence between indexes in the old and new result. That is why
the active surface selection, which picks out individual cells/points
by index, will change.

Well, for me it doesn't work this way. When I move the clip plane and hit Apply, the selected points have changed positions also in the Extract Selection view. I use ParaView 3.12.0-RC2 under Windows XP. 3.14.1 behaves the same way, but doesn't allow me to add points to a selection by holding the ctrl key, and crashes more often than 3.12.0-RC2.

Hmmm, IMHO this is counter-intuitive for the user, and would be worth improving...

Dear Burlen,

Thank you for your comments. It does not look like the Xdmf reader has
any custom panel methods. It does, however, have some logic which
caches file-data characteristics before-after RequestInformation(),
which might be wrong-footing state file loading?
( Utilities/Xdmf2/vtk/vtkXdmfReader.h:169 )
This is pure speculation on my part also :)

The effect I am seeing is similar to yours - repeated clicking
between pipeline browser filter selections causes Xdmf loader to go
from OK to modified state, or state loading brings it in as modified.

If you're working in parallel with your original grid partition you can try
the process id scalars and then the threshold filter to separate the
different domain partitions. If you're working in serial you may be able to
use the extract surface filter to see the interface between the partitions
from the files.

That filter is only available if you're running pvserver in parallel. I
believe it should be in 3.10.

/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Python 
-framework QtNetwork

the problems is that the binary of paraview is not shiped it with the 
framework phonon neither the framework QtDBus. So OS X load this 
frameworks from my system, and because they depends of QTGui of my 
system, the QTGui framework is loaded twice. gdb give the error:

...
Reading symbols for shared libraries .....done
objc[16088]: Class QCocoaColorPanelDelegate is implemented in both 
/Users/fbordeu/Desktop/ParaView 
3.14.1.app/Contents/MacOS/../Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui 
and /Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui. One of the two 
will be used. Which one is undefined.
(more similar erros...)
...

and Paraview crash!

I just eliminate this two framework from the linker line and fix the 
library with the "install_name_tool" and now is compatible with the 
official binary.

Questions:

Why the library is linked to a not use framework?
How I can force cmake not to use a specific framework in the linker line?
Is this a bug or I did something wrong??

Message-ID: <27887323.20120914160307@acm.org>

I would like to request Extending pqPythonManager to execute pvpython from memory buffer rather
than   exlusively   from  an  external  file  (patch  supplied  as  at
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13456 ).

Why? Within other plugins, filters, C++ programs, can be helpful to execute some small script.
Currently, such small script must first be written to file, then executed, then removed.

I'd like to ask for comments, if this seems a good idea or not, - I've
found it helpful in custom plugin development.

I don't see "id scalars" under filters. I am running in parallel.
I can try PV 3.10.1

You may need to upgrade to 3.14.1 then. I'm not sure when it was introduced
to paraview.

I think I added that in 2.6. So it should be there in 3.10, as long as
MPI is enabled.

I searched for "id scalars" in PV 3.10.0 and PV found "Processor id 
scalars." Clicked on it.
How do I see the partition interfaces using "Threshold"?

Threshold on process id scalars. You may have to use multiple threshold
filters for each processor id to get things you want.

Subject: [Paraview] Minimal setup for coprocessing in a Fortran solver
Message-ID: <CA+8EhJV=OzL5jiKSWxyphrw58UZdFMv0pZYnjVFthRrxF51v7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there, long time not playing with ParaView and it has evolved so much...

ok, just starting to play with coprocessing in our solver and I have very
first questions before starting. Our solver is entirely written in
Fortran90. Some time ago I've tried to use CMake as its building system but
I got stucked with Fortran modules compilation and linking, thus, I've just
given up. Our build system using plain makefiles and VS projects is so
simple that I'm not encouraged in changing everything to CMake in a short
time.

After taking a look in the Phasta example, I started to adapt it to our
solver but I'm not quite sure about what I'll have to do to link such
adaptor against our code. Is it possible to compile just the adaptor using
cmake and link the produced object file to our code or I'll have to make
CMake take care of the entire building system?! To make it short, what's
the minimalist setup to make compile coprocess support in a fortran code?

-- An adaptor to bridge solver calls to ParaView (ok, I'm sure I'll need
this)
-- A bunch of VTK libraries (which?! Am I forced to use CMake?! I hope
not...)
-- Python (it seems that it's necessary only to create the pipeline scripts)

any guideline would be appreciated.

thanks

Hi,

The quickest way to get things working together may be to do your adaptor
in ParaView, similar to the Phasta example. After that, what I would do is
just add in an executable in that same directory that depends on your
adaptor and see the verbose output from linking that executable and just
add that in to your makefile. I assume the same strategy would work for a
VS project but I don't know that very well so I can't be sure. Obviously
this isn't very portable but should at least get you going on a specific
machine. CMakeifying your simulation code would make things better long
term and there's been a lot of improved Fortran support as of late. If
you're linking with C or C++ code it can even take care of the Fortran to C
name mangling as well now.

I see that here too. All the way back to 3.8. I may be thinking about
3.4. A workaround is to save the output of the extract selection
filter and load it back in as a new dataset.

Yes, but is a very deep change.

The global ids filter is meant to help with this sort of thing, as
those ids do not change arbitrarily across filters. But I can't seem
to get that to help this situation though.

Hi Ian,

I added a note to the mantis issue.

I believe that it is already possible to execute python code from a string
(instead of a file) like this:

#include "pqPythonShell.h"
#include "pqPythonDialog.h"

pythonManager()->pythonShellDialog()->shell()->executeScript("print 'hello
world!'");

Hi guys,

Issue #13317 should be fixed in ParaView-master.

Also, I added a debug flag to help track down these apply button
issues. Doing "export PV_DEBUG_APPLY_BUTTON=1" before running ParaView
will cause messages similar to the following to be output to the
console:

$ export PV_DEBUG_APPLY_BUTTON=1
$ ./bin/paraview
Enabling the Apply button because the current proxy is uninitialized
Proxy Property Changed
  sender class:  pqIntVectorPropertyWidget
  xml label:  Whole Extent
  widget reason:  "3x2 grid of QLineEdit's for an IntVectorProperty
with an IntRangeDomain (range) and 6 elements"
Enabling the Apply button because the current proxy is modified

Let me know if you're still running into issues.

Cheers,
Kyle

Subject: [Paraview] Variable symbols in PARAVIEW
Message-ID: <AEE5F6305572C543B17F970DCFD1C87E11F43CD0@ECS-EXG-P-MB01.win.lanl.gov>

Hi PARAVIEW Users,

I use PARAVIEW for my simulation post-processing. When I do a simulation recently, I have encountered a problem. In "Variables" list of  "Object Inspector", there are three kinds of symbols for variables after check boxes ? the first one is like a block, the second one is four dots, and the third one is like a square inside a circle. I wonder what they represent respectively. When I check the boxes with four dots, the variables can appear in the "Mapped variable". However, When I check the boxes with a square inside a circle, the variables can not appear in the "Mapped variable" to select. I wonder what I can do to solve this problem. I'd like to plot them over line and time. In the past when I used PARAVIEW I have only seen the first two symbols, and have never encountered this kind of problem.

Thanks

Wenzhong

Subject: [Paraview] "Number of cores" vs. "Data size"
Message-ID: <BCB02F2D90034355921CE275491A2E5A@gmail.com>

Hi there, 
1) I have installed and ran paraview in parallel client/server mode. My server has 48 CPU cores and 2 high-end GPUs. But I'm confused that how many cores should I assign to my dataset considering it's size. Is there any equation available which can answer my question?
2) I really don't feel any upgrade in performance in parallel mode. Should I install my GPU driver? I don't have OpenGL installed. Does it affect the performance dramatically?

For example I created a sphere source with 90MB data size. Then I tried to render it as 3d Glyphs. My Macbook Pro with single mode rendered it faster than rendering the same state with 24 cores in parallel mode.

I appreciate any response in advance.

Regards,

The block symbol represents cell data meaning that there's a tuple value
for each cell, the four dots is point data meaning that there's a tuple
value for each point, and the square inside a circle is field data which is
general data that is associated with the entire grid itself and not any
single object inside the grid. Because of this there's no way to give it a
pseudo color over the grid (i.e. set it as a mapped variable). The best way
to see field data is in the spreadsheet view.

Hi there, 
I wanted to load the servers configuration file (.pvsc) to the Paraview server configuration dialog box. For example the following pvsc file:
<Server name="case2" resource="cs://amber1"> <ManualStartup> <Options> <Option name="PV_SERVER_PORT" label="Server Port: "> <Range type="int" min="1" max="65535" step="1" default="11111" /> </Option> </Options> </ManualStartup> </Server>
But, when I load the file it gives me the following error:
Not a ParaView server configuration file. Missing <Servers /> root. 

Any clue?

The error message is telling you that it expected a Servers tag as the root tag (that is, the element that contains all other elements). Try adding <Servers> to the top of your file and </Servers> to the bottom. The Servers element can contain multiple Server elements.

This is explained in the XML schema documented on the wiki in the following link, but it is adamantly easy to miss.

Thanks. Problem solved. I'm wondering why the examples at wiki don't contain this tag.

Amdahls law vs Gustafson's law.

ParaView's parallelism is for data scalability - large data is made
visualizable because of abundant RAM not abundant CPU. Since most vis
algorithms are not computationally intensive if you can fit the data
(including the derived datasets produced by algorithms along the
pipeline)  in RAM and process it with one core, throwing more cores at
the problem is very likely to slow things down. If the data doesn't
fit in RAM, you can throw another workstation (or thousands of them)
with its own disk and RAM at the problem and make it possible to
process it.

Yes - if rendering is a bottleneck then the GPU will render faster
than mesa will on the CPU.

90MB will almost certainly not benefit from more than one cpu. There
are some rules of thumb in the ParaView book section on best practices
for how big of a cluster you need for how big of a dataset, and
guidelines for how to avoid data size explosion.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems working with python Macros
Message-ID: <CC7C818E.1DFC%joshua.murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello All,

I am attempting to write a python Macro to set up some standard views for some standard workflows we are trying to develop. Specifically, I am trying to partition the render window into multiple views so that the layout looks something like the attachment called "Desired View".

When I write the script using SetActiveView() to select the view I am partitioning, it doesn't work.  No matter how I try to manipulate the active view before partitioning, I get the cascading splits seen in the second attachment "actual view".

Could someone point me towards how to partition the render window with a python Macro such that I get something like the "Desired View" attachment?

Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Joshua Murphy

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Variable symbols in PARAVIEW

The block symbol represents cell data meaning that there's a tuple value for each cell, the four dots is point data meaning that there's a tuple value for each point, and the square inside a circle is field data which is general data that is associated with the entire grid itself and not any single object inside the grid. Because of this there's no way to give it a pseudo color over the grid (i.e. set it as a mapped variable). The best way to see field data is in the spreadsheet view.

Hi PARAVIEW Users,

I use PARAVIEW for my simulation post-processing. When I do a simulation recently, I have encountered a problem. In "Variables" list of  "Object Inspector", there are three kinds of symbols for variables after check boxes ? the first one is like a block, the second one is four dots, and the third one is like a square inside a circle. I wonder what they represent respectively. When I check the boxes with four dots, the variables can appear in the "Mapped variable". However, When I check the boxes with a square inside a circle, the variables can not appear in the "Mapped variable" to select. I wonder what I can do to solve this problem. I'd like to plot them over line and time. In the past when I used PARAVIEW I have only seen the first two symbols, and have never encountered this kind of problem.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Building Paraview from source
Message-ID: <CC7CDB9B.5594%hodge3@llnl.gov>

All:

A quick question: I need to build paraview from source for my application,
and it seems to be working fine, it is just deathly slow (around 10%
completed per hour).  Ten hours to build the code seems crazy to me . . .

The structure of the makefile does not seem amenable to "make -j n"; I
kept getting a bunch of "file not found" errors, but when I would run make
again, it would work for another minute or two before bombing again.

Any thoughts?  Thanks.

Are you compiling on a lustre file system? That can significantly slow
the compilation since the parallel filesystem is optimized for write
throughput of large files. On ORNL jaguar in the NFS mounted
directories it takes 10 minutes or so to compile. Compiling on the
lustre mounted directories takes an hour or more. (10% per hour is a
bit worse than what I've ever seen on the older trilab computers so it
may be something else). I get around this by compiling from the fast
filesystem and copying the result to the lustre partition where the
back end nodes can see it.

Try "module unload altd". This is a profiling library that some of the
big machines use recenty that does not like "make -j anything". Once
that is removed you can make -j to your hearts content.

Hi Andy,

thanks for helping. I was doing my homework and building a very simple
Fortran90 example aside PV distribution. This example follows attached.

As you suggested, I've built this example using the ParaView source code
structure. The user just needs to uncompress the zip file in the
CoProcessing/Adaptors/FortranAdaptors folder that it'll create an
EdgeCFDAdaptor and insert an BUILD_EDGECFD_ADAPTOR entry to the CMake setup
for ParaView building. The adaptor itself compiles without any problem. I
also included a Test folder with a small Fortran program that should mimic
a transient simulation calling ParaView coprocessing. Now, I'm a little bit
held trying to understand the next steps. I've created a simple pipeline
and exported the coprocessing.py Python script to be used by the adaptor
but I'm not quite sure about how I'd make things work together. Do I need
to start ParaView first? Does the coprocessor open PV automatically?

Regards

Renato.

obs.: It should be great have more Fortran90 examples in the ParaView
distribution since there's still a bunch of scientific codes running in
Fortran.

No, I was not on the Lustre filesystem.  Regardless, I moved everything to
my home directory.  This did not help the speed issue much.

Removing the kernel module did reduce the dependency problems somewhat,
but not completely.


FYI, the essence of my build script follows:

cmake ../ParaView-3.14.1-Source \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/PARAVIEW \
    -DHDF5_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/HDF5/include \
    -DHDF5_LIBRARY=$HOME/HDF5/lib/libhdf5.so \
    -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON
make -j 4
make install

However, after a bit of experimentation, I see that when I remove the line

-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc

i.e., when I use the gnu compilers, the build seems to proceed at a rate
that indicates a total build time of maybe 30 minutes or so.


So, the question is, are you aware of any problems with using the intel
compilers to build paraview???  Thanks.


Cheers,

Neil

Hi,

if two datasets (e.g. Rectilinear Grid for my case) do share the same grid,
but data is stored with different precision, i.e. float for dataset1 and
double for dataset2, can I still use the "Append Attributes Filter" on
these datasets?

Last time I used icc (two years ago) I vaguely recall that compile time was
slower but it couldn't have been that much slower. I would have remembered
that. The paraview-manta render speed tests I was doing back then showed
that icc's compiled result was a percent or two faster. This was on an
intel based linux cluster.

About the same time frame I did have trouble with the pgi compilers on
crays. Burlen likely had recent knowledge about the differences.

I've used the intel compilers on various clusters, always with qt 
disabled. it's always been fast enough that I've not given it a second 
thought. Have you watched top during the build? This may give some insight.

Subject: [Paraview] RegionIDs can't be zero, coprocessing error?
Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A2F18B34C@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello ParaView,

I'm getting the following error about RegionIds from  a paraview coprocessing application when I use mpiexec with -np >1

ERROR: In /home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 168
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x5998290): RegionIDs cannot be 0.

It then produces an incorrect image, but doesn't crash. This is a gcc/mpich2 build of ParaView. The application uses fortran and the 2decomp_fft library to partition the mesh. Do I need to make the coprocessor aware that the mesh has already been partitioned? Is it trying to repartition the mesh?

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Andy, or anyone that could help me...

I've found some errors and fixed. It now compiles, links and runs without
erros or warnings but I'm not quite sure how to connect ParaView with the
simulation code. Do I have to open ParaView and leave it waiting for
coprocessor calls or the coprocessor adaptor will do it automatically?

Regards

Renato

lol, It just worked \o/

I thought coprocessor would open ParaView to make the visualization
interactively but it produced the vtkPolydata files and stored them in the
directory where I called TestPVCoProcessing program. I guess it's working
as expected :0)

Well, thanks again!

Renato.

I'm happy it's working for you. I've been slow to respond as some of the
symbols from the FortranAdaptor library aren't getting exported properly
for newer GCC compilers.

There is some prototype code to get data from the supercomputer and display
it on a ParaView client as well as code to modify create and modify
existing coprocessing pipelines but for now the coprocessing tools should
be viewed as a batch system for extracting data or screenshots.

Subject: [Paraview] Screenshot sizes on pvbatch
Message-ID: <FB46296F-B404-4B00-9448-F887E1033FF7@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to save screenshots with pvbatch (v3.14.1).
I set larger ViewSizes than display resolution,
but exported images are cropped with the display.

Is there any ideas to export larger images than displays?
# Fortunately without re-compiling ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Clean to Grid in parallel
Message-ID: <1348070917.1565.48.camel@mattmosby>

Hello all,

I am having some trouble with the clean to grid filter (paraview 3.10.1)
in client/server mode with the server having np > 1 on a pvtu dataset.

pvtu dataset:
www.nd.edu/~mmosby1/figs/paraview_clean_to_grid_filter/data.tgz

www.nd.edu/~mmosby1/figs/paraview_clean_to_grid_filter/fig1.png
Figure 1 shows the domain visualized on 1CPU with opacity = 0.5. The
boundaries of the (8) different pieces are visible.

www.nd.edu/~mmosby1/figs/paraview_clean_to_grid_filter/fig2.png
Figure 2 shows the domain visualized on 1CPU with opacity = 0.5 after
applying the "Clean to Grid" filter. The boundaries of the pieces are
correctly removed.

www.nd.edu/~mmosby1/figs/paraview_clean_to_grid_filter/fig3.png
Figure 3 shows the domain visualized on 4CPU with opacity = 0.5 after
applying the "Clean to Grid" filter. The boundaries of the pieces are
NOT correctly removed. It seems that the boundary is only removed if the
processor owns both of the coincident nodes.

I thought this was an obvious feature to have, so maybe I am doing it
wrong... I also tried to use the filter after the D3 communication
filter thinking that this might fix my problem, but I get what is shown
in Figure 4.

www.nd.edu/~mmosby1/figs/paraview_clean_to_grid_filter/fig4.png
Figure 4 shows the domain visualized on 4CPU with opacity = 0.5 after
applying the "D3" filter then the "Clean to Grid" filter. All of the
horizontal (xy-plane) boundaries are gone, but the new processor
boundaries are still visible.

Have any of you seen this behavior? Am I doing something wrong? Is this
a bug/missing feature? If it is a bug/missing feature, is it fixed in
newer versions?

Thanks,
Matt Mosby

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch
(remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the
master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in
this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in
the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API
methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link
to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through
the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it
should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to
make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python
interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on
it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake
too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm
attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install
of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being
more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or
example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Hi Andy, that sounds like some deep debugging, thanks for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now.

Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki example, which uses the DataGenerator class as the C++ does, if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Andy

I'm not sure if pvBatch/python exposes the vtkRenderLargeImage class,
but if so, it might be helpful.

some links about it:
<http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRenderLargeImage.html>
and

Hi!

You can also try this:
WriteImage('boo.png', Magnification = 2)

It searches for controls in the properties panel. WIth a complicated
reader or filter with many settings it could prove useful.

For example: open up an exodus file and search for "Appl". The "Apply
Displacements" checkbox in the Properties section is shown and
everything else goes away. Search for "Op" and the "Opacity" setting
in the display section is shown.

Subject: [Paraview] Vector export in ParaView
Message-ID: <20120921164959.6c6fceed@student.tue.nl>

Hi,

I'm wondering what the possibilities are for exporting a model/design/geometry in vector format (preferably in SVG)? I read something about a patch written by Sven Buijssen, and supposedly there used to be a branch which included this patch (https://github.com/demarle/ParaView/branches/vector-graphics-export), but it appears not to be in use anymore.

Basically, I'd like to use it for two purposes:

1.) Saving 3D models in vector format. I know SVG is 2D, so saving a 3D model as SVG would mean saving only a certain viewpoint. But this is fine, since I'll only use the vector images for reports and presentations.

2.) Saving plots in vector format. Right now I use MATLAB to plot my data, and save it as SVG using a nice script from the MATLAB File Exchange. But I would be interested in using ParaView for this purpose as well, as long as I would be able to save the plots in vector format.

Best regards,
Pieter

SVG export will be coming in PV4.0 for both scivis and chart views.

You can try it now by building git master, or more simply by
downloading the nightly binary package from one of the machines in the
superbuild section of the paraview dashboard at:

Mirko and Gena,


Thanks for your reply.

I tried both advices.
I couldn't access vtkRenderLargeImage from pvbatch,
but the 'Magnification' option takes good results!

I always export large screenshots because of resizing
(for pseudo-antialiasing), so this technique is very nice for me.

Thanks David. I downloaded the source and compiled ParaView for my 32bit Arch Linux system (resulting in a directory with over 39.000 files totaling about 2 GB, I didn't expect it to be this extensive...!).

Using "File" ? "Export Scene..." it is possible to save the scene in a couple of different vector formats. Exporting to SVG works quite nicely, however, the exported polygons don't link together in a completely seamless way. That means that there is a very small gap between all of them. Is this behavior intended (i.e. is it a feature or a bug)?

I'm not sure what the policies are regarding attachments in this mailing list? If allowed I could attach the original .OBJ file, which is about 5 kB.

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Questions about 13100_cgns_fixes
Message-ID: <20120924130133.11540@gmx.com>

I answer to myself, so that it can be useful for other people facing my problem.
 I managed to solve it by modifying the CMakeLists.txt under 'Utilities/VisitBridge/databases' and putting :

 if(HAVE_LIBCGNS AND VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS)
 target_link_libraries(vtkIOVisItBridge ${CGNS_LIBRARIES} -lhdf5)
 endif(HAVE_LIBCGNS AND VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS)

 I don't if it is the best way to solve things but it worked for me.

 I then tried to import the CGNS reader from Visit (2.5.2 version). I directly copied the avtCGNSFileFormat.x files to Paraview directory.
 Despite the rough approach, it worked perfectly and allows to see 2D surface described in 3D manner (this problem was already reported on paraview mailing list http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2009-July/012930.html ).

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am using Paraview for a small project purpose. Since I have CGNS 3.1 files, I tried to compile Paraview from git-master with Visit-CGNS reader enabled. Unfortunately, it crashes complaining about HDF5 symbols not found. I guess I need to specify somewhere that the CGNS library is using hdf5 and link against it but I am at a loss. Has anyone encountered this problem and know how to solve it ?
 And one more thing, is there a plan to import the latest CGNS reader from Visit to get more fixes ?

 Regards,

 Patrick Martins

What are the detailed steps involved to interpolate between data time steps?
I click on "temporal interpolation" and enter an interval.

I animate using paraview.pvd file but would like to have a smoother 
animation using interpolation between the data time steps.

PV does not give an error but when I visualize the .avi file
mplayer anim.avi

I get errors like this.
V:  27.0  28/ 28  2%  1%  0.0% 0 0
[vdpau] Error when calling 
vdp_presentation_queue_block_until_surface_idle: An invalid handle value

Hi Pieter,


There are two considerable issue.
Both of them are not faults of ParaView.
Your ParaView may be working good.

The first is anti-aliasing.
The edges of vector format graphics are smoothed with
some kind of anti-aliasing algorithm.
These algorithms usually can't treat contacts of
vector polygons exactly, so we can find tiny gaps.

# Usually two 50% transparent layers can't make a solid layer.
# If you have Photoshop or other Graphics softwares, let's try it.

The second is round-off errors between OpenGL and SVG.
General SVG exporters' precisions are 3 decimal places.
The lowest numbers may have some errors, so some polygons
do not keep contacts between themselves.


If I were you, I may write some scripts to merging
side-by-side polygons.
I think this is the most certain way.

Hi Andy,

I've tested this and it works with both gcc/mpich2 and pgi/openmpi.

Thanks again!

Hi Andy, that sounds like some deep debugging, thanks for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now.

Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki example, which uses the DataGenerator class as the C++ does, if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Tarball attached, it's not exactly the wiki example because I didn't want to bother with passing a DataGenerator object back and forth from C++ to Fortran, so I just make a sphere. The pipeline script is a shrink filter generated by pvclient.

I checked CMake and it looks like it's finding the same version of python.

Hello Everyone,

I am trying to get a plug-in that was written by one of my colleagues
compile but with no luck unfortunately.

Here is the output of make after configuring with cmake.

I am guessing the parser is not understanding VTK_IO_EXPORT part of
the declaration?!!

Any help would be apreciated.

Dear ParaView developers,
?
I downloaded paraview-3.14.1 binary for linux 64 bit OS and unpacked on an OpenSUSE 12.2 64 bit OS.? When I started paraview, I got "segmentation fault".? I am wondering how I can address this issue.? Thanks!

Did you get my changes from ParaView's stage branch? My changes didn't make
it into ParaView master yet so I'm not sure what changed that caused things
to work now. Well, if it's working I'm glad -- I'm not sure I can
personally take credit for it though :)

Let me know how it goes with the GPU stuff.

I pulled it directly from stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor.

I'm now at the point where it runs great on a single node with GPUs, I'm trying to extend it to multiple nodes, which I think involves setting up vtkMultiBlockDataSets? I was going to look through the NPICAdaptor for hints on that.

Did you get my changes from ParaView's stage branch? My changes didn't make it into ParaView master yet so I'm not sure what changed that caused things to work now. Well, if it's working I'm glad -- I'm not sure I can personally take credit for it though :)

Let me know how it goes with the GPU stuff.

Hi Andy, that sounds like some deep debugging, thanks for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now.

Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki example, which uses the DataGenerator class as the C++ does, if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Tarball attached, it's not exactly the wiki example because I didn't want to bother with passing a DataGenerator object back and forth from C++ to Fortran, so I just make a sphere. The pipeline script is a shrink filter generated by pvclient.

I checked CMake and it looks like it's finding the same version of python.

Message-ID: <1348592454.73035.YahooMailNeo@web162803.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview experts,
?
I am wondering if you have a solution to this paraview display issue.? See attached image:?this is a mesh generated using ANSYS workbench with cutCell.? It contains hanging nodes.? On the left windows, I showed the mesh with transparancy.? It showed some kind of "shadow" due to the hanging nodes.? I am wondering is it possible to show a true transparancy, that is, no shadow.
?

By single node I'm assuming that you mean a single process, correct? What's
the type of grid that you're planning on using? The PhastaAdaptor is an
example of dealing with an unstructured grid. I also just updated the
coprocessing tutorials page (now at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials) to include the tutorial
I'll be doing at SC12. It should have some useful information for doing
this. You could just do a polydata input, just set the center of the sphere
source in your example based on the process rank (e.g.
Sphere->SetCenter(10*rank, 0, 0); ) so that it's easy to tell the
difference between each processes input part/domain partition.

Right, single process. I'm working with one code that's all CPU and another that's mixed CPU/GPU. Coprocessing works well for both. There's also MPI versions of the codes that I'm trying to instrument.

The computational mesh is completely regular so I've been using vtkImageData. The MPI versions split the mesh over the ranks. When I run an MPI version with  -np > 1, then I get the following for each process:
ERROR: In /home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 168
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x5ac6430): RegionIDs cannot be 0.

It doesn't crash, but it gives an incorrect image. I'll look through your updated tutorials, I'd been looking through the SC10 slides.

Great, then it was me after all that fixed it!


I'm now at the point where it runs great on a single node with GPUs, I'm trying to extend it to multiple nodes, which I think involves setting up vtkMultiBlockDataSets? I was going to look through the NPICAdaptor for hints on that.

By single node I'm assuming that you mean a single process, correct? What's the type of grid that you're planning on using? The PhastaAdaptor is an example of dealing with an unstructured grid. I also just updated the coprocessing tutorials page (now at http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials) to include the tutorial I'll be doing at SC12. It should have some useful information for doing this. You could just do a polydata input, just set the center of the sphere source in your example based on the process rank (e.g. Sphere->SetCenter(10*rank, 0, 0); ) so that it's easy to tell the difference between each processes input part/domain partition.

Did you get my changes from ParaView's stage branch? My changes didn't make it into ParaView master yet so I'm not sure what changed that caused things to work now. Well, if it's working I'm glad -- I'm not sure I can personally take credit for it though :)

Let me know how it goes with the GPU stuff.

Hi Andy, that sounds like some deep debugging, thanks for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now.

Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki example, which uses the DataGenerator class as the C++ does, if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Tarball attached, it's not exactly the wiki example because I didn't want to bother with passing a DataGenerator object back and forth from C++ to Fortran, so I just make a sphere. The pipeline script is a shrink filter generated by pvclient.

I checked CMake and it looks like it's finding the same version of python.

Ah, apparently I'm not setting the extents with SetExtent(), vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent() as mentioned on slide 79 of the SC12 slides.

I've been working off of the Phasta example. So if I understand the general idea right, I need to be sending the extent information from the application to the coprocessor call, then
I need to make sure that those also get passed to the image data set creator, and I need to also send the partitioned arrays to the addfields_() call?

Right, single process. I'm working with one code that's all CPU and another that's mixed CPU/GPU. Coprocessing works well for both. There's also MPI versions of the codes that I'm trying to instrument.

The computational mesh is completely regular so I've been using vtkImageData. The MPI versions split the mesh over the ranks. When I run an MPI version with  -np > 1, then I get the following for each process:
ERROR: In /home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView/ParaView-3.14.1-Source/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 168
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x5ac6430): RegionIDs cannot be 0.

It doesn't crash, but it gives an incorrect image. I'll look through your updated tutorials, I'd been looking through the SC10 slides.

Great, then it was me after all that fixed it!


I'm now at the point where it runs great on a single node with GPUs, I'm trying to extend it to multiple nodes, which I think involves setting up vtkMultiBlockDataSets? I was going to look through the NPICAdaptor for hints on that.

By single node I'm assuming that you mean a single process, correct? What's the type of grid that you're planning on using? The PhastaAdaptor is an example of dealing with an unstructured grid. I also just updated the coprocessing tutorials page (now at http://paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_Tutorials) to include the tutorial I'll be doing at SC12. It should have some useful information for doing this. You could just do a polydata input, just set the center of the sphere source in your example based on the process rank (e.g. Sphere->SetCenter(10*rank, 0, 0); ) so that it's easy to tell the difference between each processes input part/domain partition.

Did you get my changes from ParaView's stage branch? My changes didn't make it into ParaView master yet so I'm not sure what changed that caused things to work now. Well, if it's working I'm glad -- I'm not sure I can personally take credit for it though :)

Let me know how it goes with the GPU stuff.

Hi Andy, that sounds like some deep debugging, thanks for your effort. I'll test this and let you know. It's on my to do list to learn CMake, I've had the book on my desk for a month now.

Also, I made another Fortran example that's closer in spirit to the wiki example, which uses the DataGenerator class as the C++ does, if you're interested.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I finally got around to fixing this. It's in the stage branch (remotes/stage/13460_CP_FortranAdaptor) and hopefully will go into the master branch on the next gatekeeper review. There were 2 issues fixed in this:
1) for using newer GCC compilers and other compilers that hide symbols in the library (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) the FortranAdaptor API methods weren't available to other libraries and executables trying to link to them.
2) Since 3.14.1 I changed around the way ParaView gets initialized through the coprocessing library (now through vtkCPProcessor::Initialize() as it should be instead of vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline::Initialize()). I forgot to make the change in the FortranAdaptorAPI.cxx which caused the python interpretor to not be initialized properly, as you noticed.

Thanks for the help in finding this problem. Sorry for the slow response on it. I created a CMakeLists.txt file to help build as I've been using CMake too long and can't remember how to work with Makefiles anymore! I'm attaching it in case you'd like to use it. I didn't test it with an install of ParaView as I really only work directly with ParaView builds.

Let me know if this solves your problems. I seem to remember there being more as far as using CUDA and PGI but hopefully this gets you close.

By the way, I'll probably use what you sent me to create a Fortran test or example to help with making sure it doesn't get broken in the future.

Yeah, for structured grids you'll need to set the extent on each process as
well as use vtkCPInputDataDescription::SetWholeExtent() to specify the
global grid extent. The partitioned arrays in addfields() for single
component tuples needs to be the same length as the number of points/cells
on the local, partitioned grid.

The extent support for coprocessing is a git dodgy as we're trying to do
things in a way that the pipeline doesn't like. One solution to that is to
use a vtkMultiPieceDataSet but I haven't tried that enough yet to see how
well it works.

Dear ParaView experts,

I grabbed paraview and PVVTK from git.  Now I have a folder called ParaView and a folder called PVVTK.   How do I merge the two so that I can compile both together?

Thanks

Hi Peiying,

I'm not sure to follow what you are saying, but ParaView already embed
VTK as a git submodule.

Therefore inside your ParaView git repo, you just need to update all
the submodules by executing the following command line:

> git submodule update --init

This will automatically fetch and update VTK inside ParaView without
involving you in any merge or so.

Hope this helps,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] error when running the development version from git
Message-ID: <1348837129.93153.YahooMailNeo@web162803.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear ParaView experts,

I grabbed the latest paraview source for git.? Compilation and installation went through successfully, but, when I ran paraview, I got the following error:

ERROR: In /home/hsieh/projects/ParaView/VTK/GUISupport/Qt/vtkEventQtSlotConnect.cxx, line 68
vtkEventQtSlotConnect (0x1d0e470): Cannot connect NULL objects.

I am using OpenSUSE 12.2 64 bit.? I am wondering if someone here can shed some light on how to address this.

Thanks!

Pei-Ying

Subject: [Paraview] subdivide and interpolate
Message-ID: <CAGvy_O1w42QnZDJTzjFnAtMc+5x2usH7Rk8jn2sjaqg-xgBbpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a new user of paraview and I want to use the subdivide Filter to get
more data in a region of my mesh. But it seems that, after having applied
it, no interpolation of these data is done at the new created points. For
example, the velocity at one of these new points is just a copy of the
velocity value at an old node which is, I guess, the nearest from the new
one. Is there a way to get the interpolated values instead?

Thanks,

H.

I visualize deformation of 3D hexahedral meshes. I frequently select a node of the mesh and use PlotSelectionOverTime to visualize internal variables such as stress and strain in a 2D plot. Particularly, I plot stress-strain curves: x-axis is strain, y-axis is stress.

I would like to have a big black dot indicating the (x,y) coordinates of the stress/strain values at the current time. I would like to be able to see the dot in the "normal" viewing mode, as well as during an animation--hitting "play" or creating an animation. 

The ideal case would be to have side-by-side plots (one 3D plot of my mesh and one 2D PlotSelectionOverTime plot) where I can simultaneously view the deformation of the mesh and the black dot moving along the stress/strain curve showing the stress and strain at the current time.

Fred,

I have been able to produce the plots you want with PV.

After you use the select point(s) inside a polygon filter, you have to 
select under the top-line View drop-down menu, the Selection Inspector 
window. At the bottom of this window you can select the color and size 
of the selected point. It is a little tricky to keep the selected point 
high-lighted when doing the side-by-side animation of the mesh and the 
x-vs-y plot. If I recall correctly, the Selection filter needs to be the 
active element in the Pipeline Browser window.

Subject: [Paraview] WebGL Exporter in Paraview, where to find it?
Message-ID: <CAN401uU4x3obRcExCo1eAopjfH1ns1tnVnPQ1Q9r6ZaVKbnN6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

In http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Included_Plugins, it says:
"The WebGL exporter plugin brings the ParaViewWeb WebGL code to ParaView to
allow a 3D scene to be exported into a standalone HTML page."

It's also mentionned there:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/Exporting_Scenes: "*.html -- Using WebGL to render
a surfacique 3D scene into a web page. Static Standalone WebGL example from
ParaViewWeb<http://paraviewweb.kitware.com/PWApp/WebGL?name=mummy-state&button=View>
"

I'm currently using 3.12.0 and cannot see this export option. How can I get
it? Installing ParaviewWeb and/or moving to 3.14?

Regards,
Nico.

Hi Nico,

this is for ParaView/master from our git repository. This mean that it
will be available in next release (ParaView 4.0) but you can try out
our current development version by downloading our binary here:

http://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=ParaView&filtercount=1&showfilters=1&field1=groupname/string&compare1=63&value1=Super

And by clicking on the yellow box that match your system.

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] make Contour output into a closed surface?
Message-ID: <SNT138-W63778B95A672DB3592FF7DD1800@phx.gbl>





Hello,
 
Is it possible to make the output of the Contour filter a *closed* surface - basically, to put end caps on the isosurfaces? I can see some volume options in the display tab, but they are greyed out.
 
Right now, I import my data as CSV, use TableToStructuredGrid filter to convert it into grid (a rectangular prism), and then use the the Contour filter to find isosurfaces. But it's a little confusing to look at when the isosurfaces hit the edges of the prism since they look like holes, so I'd like to end cap them with a solid color.

I don't think you can do it directly, but you can create the end caps by first running the extract surface filter and then running a clip by scalars filter on that.
