Subject: [Paraview] is there an easy to do this animation?
Message-ID: <531049.4726.qm@web35302.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview group:

It will be appreciated if someone here can suggestion an easier/better way to do this animation:

I did a transient parallel run.  I ran the case for x time steps, stopped, and then, restarted the run.  Hence, the results were saved to different folders, each with Output0001.pvtu as the starting file.  There are a total of 8 partitions.  So, the results structure is like:

run1/
    Output0001.pvtu
    Output0002.pvtu
    Output0033.pvtu
    Output0001par0001.vtu
    Output0001par0002.vtu
    ..
    Output0001par0008.vtu
    Output0002par0001.vtu
    Output0002par0002.vtu
    ..
    Output0002par0008.vtu
    Output0003par0001.vtu
    Output0003par0002.vtu
    ..
    Output0003par0008.vtu
run2/
    Output0001.pvtu
    Output0002.pvtu
    Output0033.pvtu
    Output0001par0001.vtu
    Output0001par0002.vtu
    ..
    Output0001par0008.vtu
    Output0002par0001.vtu
    Output0002par0002.vtu
    ..
    Output0002par0008.vtu
    Output0003par0001.vtu
    Output0003par0002.vtu
    ..
    Output0003par0008.vtu

I can easily do animation within each run folder, but, how can I make 1 combined animation of all the run folders, while keeping the orientations/scale/position of the object and filters the same?

Thanks!

Pei

If you write a pvd file that points to both set in the right order,
you should be able to animate them in on shot.

The sort answer is that there is no easy way to do that.  The transfer functions are managed by the views, which the filter has no link to.  To get transfer function information, I think you will need to replicate your own transfer function editor in the object inspector panel or to manage your filter in a representation object (one of the subclasses of vtkSMRepresentationProxy).

Hi folks,

I just posted binaries for the development version of ParaView from
yesterday here:
http://paraview.org/New/download.html
Look for "Latest Development Snapshot".

Please note that this is not a beta or a release candidate and it is
likely to have bugs. If you are looking for a stable version, use
3.2.1. If you want to take peek at what is coming in 3.4, give it a go
and report any problems you encounter.

Thanks,
-berk

I was wondering if there was any way to get Paraview/Cmake to generate 
XCode projects, like what it does with windows and Visual Studio. This 
would be great when writing custom plugins.

Does "cmake -G Xcode /path/to/ParaView" not work?

I have never thought of doing it this way, I will try this out ASAP.
Thank you.

While I was able to generate a xproject for paraview, it crashed xcode 
2.5 when loading in OSX 10.4

I then tried making a project file for a single plugin and that worked 
fine ( unable to compile, since the paraview project failed)

I generated an XCode project with cmake for Paraview CVS.  It crashes Xcode
3.1 on OSX 10.5, but you can do xcodebuild on the command line to build it.
I was then able to use Xcode for Paraview plugins.

In the Tetrahedralize filter, the volume mapper options are

(1) Projected tetra
(2) HAVS
(3) Z sweep
(4) Bunyk ray cast

Looking at the source in CVS, I saw some code for OpenGL 3D texture.

Will that capability be expose in the the final 3.4 release?

The current volume mapper is not as interactive as I'd have seen
compare to other tools I have used.

 Is it possible to have a uniform width of labels in colormap (for example
in attached figure I could not make the width of labels uniform)? Looks like
with new automatic system, formatting is not much flexible!

Many thanks,

The 3D texture volume mapper only works with uniform volumes
(vtkImageData). I am curious which other tools are you talking about?

I get malloc errors on my macbook when trying to compile from the 
command line. If I have any open processes it happens during loading, If 
i only run xcodebuild it happens during libvtkFiltering with the error:
xcodebuild(8204,0x70d5200) malloc: *** vm_allocate(size=1069056) failed 
(error code=3)
xcodebuild(8204,0x70d5200) malloc: *** error: can't allocate region
xcodebuild(8204,0x70d5200) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in szone_error 
to debug
objc: NSPathStore2: failed -- out of memory(NSPathStore2, 288)

This is a macbook with 1gb of memory and compiling with debug on.

looks like xcode is trying to allocate 1GB of memory. Couple of  
things. Get another GB of ram in your MacBook if at all possible.  
Next, are you building with Static or Dynamic libraries? I _think_  
static libraries will require more ram to compile (I think.. ). Worth  
a try if you are building static libs. Of course if you _are_  
building static libs, any plugin you write will not work.. so you  
must be compiling with Dynamic libs.
   You may also want to make sure that you are compiling with Dwarf  
debugging and NOT Stabs. I think that may help also.

Hope some of that helps.

Is it possible to have a uniform width of labels in colormap (for example in attached figure I could not make the width of labels uniform)? Looks like with new automatic system, formatting is not much flexible!

Many thanks,

I am currently heading out to try and locate at least another 1gb of 
memory for the macbook, and I am compiling with dynamic libs with dwarf 
debugging on.

Hi,

How do you name blocks?  I was patching the ParaView code how Takuya posted
previously on the mailing list and putting the name as field data for each
block.  Unfortunately the latest changes in the CVS stop this from working.

If there is a better way to do naming I'd prefer to use that.

Thanks,
Paul

Hi,

As I play with the new composite dataset structures, I came to think
it would indeed be nice if ParaView3 can handle datasets with string
labels ("Porous Material," "Air," ... , rather than "DataSet 0,"
"DataSet 1," ...). I mean, for example, VTK/IO/vtkEnsight6Reader.cxx
has a fragment of code to assign its output a string label.

 vtkCharArray* nmArray = vtkCharArray::New();
 nmArray->SetName("Name");
 size_t len = strlen(name);

Here's how to name a block:

vtkMultiBlockDataSet* mb  = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();
...
vtkDataSet* myBlock0 = ...
mb->SetBlock(0, myBlock0);
mb->GetMetadata(0)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(), "MyBlock0");
...
vtkDataSet* myBlock1 = ...
mb->SetBlock(1, myBlock1);
mb->GetMetadata(1)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(), "MyBlock1");
...


The naming of blocks by putting the name in FieldData is no longer 
supported.

Subject: [Paraview] Remote render / composite settings with MPI pvserver
Message-ID: <481B72F9.7080505@users.sourceforge.net>

I'm trying to do remote rendering with client-server, where the server 
is running in parallel on AIX.  The problem is that it only renders the 
block from the first task, as if the compositing is not happening.  So, 
I'm trying to figure out if it's an AIX-related issue or I'm just doing 
something dumb with the build or one of the settings.  So, here's all 
the relevant info I can think of:

Versions: 3.2.1 and CVS (about 1 week old)
Build: AIX using VisualAge compiler, cross-compiled using mpCC, 64-bit
With: Python 2.5.1, Mesa 7.0.2 w/OSMesa
ICE-T: Without
Server:
	Command: mpirun.lsf pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
	   also tried --disable-compositing  (grasping at straws here)
	LSF processors: 8
	Cleared the DISPLAY env var
Client:
	Remote Render Threshold: 0 (to force remote rendering)
	Disable Ordered Compositing: Tried Off & On
	Everything else at defaults as well

It happens with any source or data sets, and with any of the filters 
I've tried.  If I turn off Remote Rendering (i.e., force client 
rendering) things look fine.

Then I thought maybe I should try building ICE-T.  I did that with 3.2.1 
and now I just get a black screen, except for the little axis widget.  I 
haven't tried with ICE-T and CVS yet.  After that, I'm out of permutations.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Sean

That looks good to me. We do something similar using a 4-node Linux cluster as a server. We use -rc but I don't see how that would be an issue.

Does your MPI require daemons like mpd? If so and they have not been started node 0 may not see the other nodes.

I don't think it's an MPI issue, or at least not with configuration or 
daemons.  It is an operational computation system with 3072 CPUs that 
runs MPI jobs on a regular basis.  The big question mark is AIX.  I 
guess I could try the exact same configuration and versions on a Linux 
system to see if it makes a difference.

Thanks for the information.

(1) Golden Software's Voxler
(2) OpenDX

My work flow is to bring in a set of data and if required decimate it
to fit within the memory limit of the system I am using and do quick
rotate/pan/zoom of the volume data set to get an idea of what I am
dealing with.

My actual research is in high resolution volume rendering (with key
frame animation) using RenderMan using Paraview as a possible front
end.

It sounds like you want to volume render uniform rectilinear data
(vtkImageData) because neither OpenDX nor Voxler can volume render
unstructured grids. VTK has a 3D texture based volume rendering
algorithm for vtkImageData but it is not in ParaView currently. You
can report a feature request here: http://paraview.org/Bug. You can
also directly use VTK.

I was able to upgrade my machine to 2gb of ram and tried getting 
xcodebuild to work. With the nightly cvs version I am still getting 
memory out of errors after it has allocated over 1.9G.

Is there any special xcodebuild flags I need to set, other then 
DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT (using dwarf)?

Just out of curiosity, can you successfully build ParaView with just  
make?

cmake [path/to/ParaView3]  will generate make files. Then "make".

Might help isolate if there is a problem with your system or with  
Xcode handling a project the size of ParaView.. or something in the  
Xcode generation.

I have had no problem compiling Paraview on the macbook with just make, 
even when I only had 1gb of memory, it seems to only be a problem with 
xcode project file.

As long as you have uniform grid size, it is always efficient to write a vti
file. For your problem just modify

bytes[i]=(nx*ny)*sizeof(float);

to
bytes[i]=(nx*ny*nz)*sizeof(float);
in segment

nvar=1; /* Plot only one variable set */
off[0]=0;
for (i=0; i<nvar; i++){
 bytes[i]=(nx*ny)*sizeof(float);
 if(i<nvar-1)off[i+1]=off[i]+sizeof(int)+bytes[i];
 bytes[i]=bytes[i]+sizeof(int);
}

Hom Nath

I heard of a few development efforts but none of them resulted in
something that could go into paraview. If someone were to develop such
a reader, I would be happy to include it in ParaView.

Hello, i have a problem with a 2D graph. I have a mesh with 3273 points and 12773 elements. In this elements there is a flow of current in funtion of time. I would like to plot a dynamic curve of the current in function of time with a 2D graph(i have 18 time, 0.0, 0.002, 0.004...and an intensity for each time sample).  For dynamic i means that every time sample i add the corresponding amplitude(for time time 0 i plot only I0, then for time t1 i add to graph I1 etc....)
Have everyone an idea how to plot this kind of graph??
 
Thank you a lot for the help

Message-ID: <8e0b87a90805051000g552abaa3od32b577360d68d19@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have what is seemingly a parallel rendering problem, although I can not be
sure.  I have tested this with ParaView 3.2.1 and the latest HEAD (as of
this email's date). Please take a look at these screenshots:
sequential<http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/pv/sequential.jpg>(no problems
here), 4 CPU run with
3.2.1 <http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/pv/pv3.2.1.jpg>, 4 CPU run with
HEAD<http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/pv/pvhead.jpg>.


The system is,
cpu: dual quad core Intel Xeon
gpu: dual Nvidia Quadro FX 570
os: Ubuntu 8.04 (hardy)
libs: gcc -4.2.3, mpich2-1.0.7 (with ch3:nemesis)

I'd greatly appreciate any clues to track down the problem.

thanks

The problem is that the server windows are overlapping. Most OpenGL
drivers, specially on Linux, does not fully render in regions that are
obscured by other windows. There are a few ways to fix this:
0. Make sure the windows do not overlap
1. Do not use parallel rendering - disable remote rendering in your settings
2. Use software rendering by compiling against Mesa

Which one is the best depends on what you are trying to do. It sounds
like you are running the server on the same machine as the client. In
that case, (1) may be the better option as long as you are not volume
rendering. If you are running on a cluster, (0) is the best option.
You can achieve that by setting the DISPLAY properly to make sure that
each window is rendering on a separate display. (2) is the fallback
option but is probably the slowest unless you have a lot of nodes.

Subject: [Paraview] caching output pipelines
Message-ID: <E05ABC9A7FBFB942B70D7533AF5BE68D64306B@augexmsg001.euro.corp.dir>

I'm working on bits of an add-on reader and would like to figure out how
the pipeline caching is supposed to work. Unfortunately I only have
immediate access to a somewhat older "VTK Visualization Toolkit" book
and not the "VTK User's Guide", where the required information might
presumably be found.

I have a time-invariant geometry (organized as a vtkMultiBlockDataSet
with several blocks) and a number of time-steps. To avoid pulling the
geometry data from disk at each time step, the geometry is cached in an
internal (non-vtk) format. I've tried various means of updating field
values only without needing to update the underlying geometry, but have
had thus far no luck.

I was inspired by the Biddiscombe et al. IEEE 2007 publication and
started digging through the VTK/IO directory for suitable examples.
I can't, however, see that any of them have implemented the combination
of an invariant geometry and transient fields.

At the moment I have a RequestInformation() method with
    outInfo->Set
    (
        vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),
        timeSteps,
        nTimeSteps
    );

    outInfo->Set
    (
        vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(),
        timeRange,
        2
    );

and a RequestData() method that responds to

    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS()


I suspect that UPDATE_TIME_STEPS could be combined with
PREVIOUS_UPDATE_TIME_STEPS to a time change, but at each evaluation of
RequestData(), the output DATA_OBJECT is always reset to having zero
blocks anyhow. Since I haven't fiddled with the ReleaseData settings,
(ie., the output block has "Global Release Data: Off" and "Release Data:
Off") I assume this is a feature.

Are there other Request...() methods that I should be using here?

Is there an example somewhere in the VTK source that approaches what I
am attempting or a pseudo-code snippet somewhere?
What is the canonical method for tackling this problem?
I could save my own private vtkMultiBlockDataSet within the class and
then copy it to the output as required, but I somehow suspect that that
isn't quite how it supposed to be done. It also feels funny (and slow)
updating geometry that hasn't changed at all.

I would be very appreciative of any tips or hints for solving this
problem.

You seem to be on the right track except maybe for one detail: your reader cannot reuse the output data structure. Actually, there is little value to trying to reuse it since you are already keeping the non-varying part (the geometry) elsewhere. In RequestData a new output data structure must be built.

I made a custom, local change to the PVD reader so it does what you are trying to accomplish: it creates multi-block output from an input data set where the geometry does not change over time. I think this will be included in a future release.

But I did one thing different: I stored the geometry in a VTK data structure instead of the non-VTK structure you used. The main output from the reader is given a pointer to the saved geometry. I incremented the usage count for the geometry by one so that it was not deleted when the main data structure was deleted.

Is there perhaps one more option: use off-screen rendering? I haven't written OpenGL directly for a while but I think there is a way to use the hardware accelerator to write to a buffer. I'm not sure how to ask PV to use this mode.

I'm particularly interested in the answer because we have a similar system: dual quad-core Xeons plus a graphics card on each node, with 4 nodes.

That is true; offscreen rendering _should_ work as long as the OpenGL
driver cooperates. However, you are not gaining much in terms of
rendering performance since all processes will be using the same GPU.
We are starting to think about scaling number of processes we use
without scaling the number of GPUs....

Sean,

What do you mean by without ICE-T? I don't think you can really turn
off ICE-T anymore. It should always be there as long as you turn on
MPI. Did you have do any trickery to turn it off?

Berk,
No trickery; I just turn off PARAVIEW_USE_ICE_T in CMake.  I am using 
cmake and not ccmake, so maybe that variable not exposed anymore in 
ccmake?  Anyway, my initial thought was to make things as simple as 
possible since AIX is less popular and PV is less tested than, say, on 
Linux.  I did some looking into it, and I think ICE-T is definitely the 
way to go, and it builds just fine.  Unfortunately, I get an entirely 
black screen when running.

I would say I could try running the ICE-T tests, but I'm not sure how, 
given that I'm building for MPI.  The system uses batch queues to submit 
MPI jobs.

Thanks,
Sean

Thanks Berk. Overlap was the problem, and rearranging the windows solves the
issue although this is obviously not  convenient (at best) on same machine
server/client configuration.

And thanks Kent. The good news is (at least with my configuration)
--use-off-screen works perfectly.

How can I make sure that I fully utilize the GPUs on the system? (both
graphics cards are identical each with dual head). And if for this I need to
fall back to not using off screen, can you hint a bit on setting up
$DISPLAY? Do I need to run multiple X servers for this?

How are you outputting from the cards? Do you have both of them going
to the same DISPLAY and use the drivers to deal with multiple
monitors/inputs?

Have you tried one node server with composite threshold set to 0 after
compiling with ice-t?

I believe it is so. Fwiw, attached is my xorg.conf (nvidia-settings
generated it).  Two monitors are connected, one on each card. I hope we are
not going too much off topic here.

thanks for the help.

Hello Berk,
I want to plot a 2D graph of the current in function of the time. For dinamic i means that i would have an animation for this graph, that's at each time sample we add the new intensity....(at time 0 we show only the itensity of I(t=0), then at time 1 we show intensity I(t=0) and I(t=1), at time 2 we show intensity I(t=0), I(t=1) and I(t=2) etc...). I have a vector for time that goes from 0.0 to 0.0034 and and for each point of time i have a scalar that correspond to the intensity of current :
%time                   %Intensity
0.0                       0.0                      2.0E-4                   0.3767431                4.0E-4                   0.7519994                6.0E-4                   1.1242878                8.0E-4                   1.4921393                0.0010                   1.854102                 0.0012                   2.2087474                0.0014                   2.5546758                0.0016                   2.890522                 0.0018                   3.2149608                0.0020                   3.5267115                0.0022                   3.824544                 0.0024                   4.1072826                0.0026                   4.3738117                0.0028                   4.6230793                0.0030                   4.854102                 0.0032                   5.0659676                0.0034                   5.25784                  
It's possible to draw a 2D graph as i have explain before???
Just another question, there is a filter for extracting only one element(thetrahedron) from a mesh?? And what about your question, it's possibile to draw the intensity of only one elements??
 
Thank you a lot, best
 
Samuele

Thanks for the extra insights. This would imply that there is no
provision for the downstream to optimize for a constant geometry source.
I'm not sure how much of a bottleneck this really represents since there
are a number of other things changing anyhow (eg, field values, viewport
..).

Would it be possible to get a copy (whole or just the relevant snippets)
for reference purposes? On-list, off-list, with any usage restrictions
... it'd all be fine with me.  I would really like to avoid coding into
a dead-end.

I'm somewhat stuck with a non-VTK structure (for tracking polyhedral
decomposition and other things), but if I understand it correctly, your
method should effectively have zero additional memory overhead anyhow.
If I assume that geometric data is in use on one form or another
somewhere in the pipeline, it shouldn't make any difference if it's
being held by the reader or by the pipeline. Could it be that it is even
a tad faster than usual, since there is no intermediate malloc/free?

Hmm. Is it really necessary to increment the refcount for the cached
geometry? Or would it be possible to use a shallowcopy to send the
cached geometry to the output?

Are you saving all the pieces and blocks separately and assembling them
on-demand, or do you pre-build the final output?

I thought of this type of flow:

gather geometry bits (from file or elsewhere)

foreach part
do
  # release all fields
  part->GetCellData()->Initialize();
done


foreach field
do
  # add in each field
  foreach part
  do
    part->GetCellData()->AddArray(field);
  done
done

assemble parts to multiblockdataset.


I suspect it might be alright if the last step (assemble to
multiblockdataset) occurs directly on the output.

Am I way off base with this approach?

Thanks again,

I don't have a good understanding of the nvidia drivers but it sounds
like you would be using both cards as long as you make sure that your
server windows are distributed evenly across monitors. I am guessing
this would be true even if you are using offscreen rendering.

There are things in the file that look like a CVS comparison:

Could whoever checked in that file clean that up then let me and/or the list know so I can grab it again.

Looks like you have a conflict in vtkPVServerInformation.cxx. Did you 
change that file? If there are no useful changes in it, then simply 
remove the file and do a "cvs update" again.

Message-ID: <20a72bf00805061324h589a013au260779e168d4f876@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is it possible to do data analysis using two different source inputs
with ParaView? I'd like to subtract a scalar data set from another
one.

I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks.

I have a follow up question to one I asked a while ago.

While I manage to take differences between two sets, my method (outlined 
below) only allows me to do this for one time step at the time.

Is there a way to take a difference for all times at the same time so 
that I can look at those differences over time, save it etc.?

Thanks!

Although it is possible (and fairly straightforward) to create filters in ParaView that load in all of the timesteps at one time, it is something that we avoid for memory considerations and hence do not have anything exposed that will do so.  However, there are many mechanisms in ParaView that will iterate over all of the timesteps of the input so that your filter sequence will perform its calculations on a per timestep basis (assuming your reader is supporting time).

So for starters, you could simply use ParaView's VCR controls to play through the sequence of time and look at the results.  You can also save an animation to get a sequence of images.  If polygonal data is satisfactory, you can also use the "Save Geometry" option to save the polygonal data over time.

It is technically possible for any writer to iterate over time and save out multiple time steps to the file.  Unfortunately, I don't think any writers yet support this feature.  That's something we need to work on.

I'm getting an error trying to write an XDMF file with different cell  
types (wedges and hexes).   Looking at the source code this appears to  
be generated from the vtkXdmfWriter.cxx line 1322.    Does anybody  
have a sense for the difficulty of removing this constraint?

    Thanks,

I've managed to successfully compile the latest ParaView CVS (had to use
3.3CVS to disable documentation, but I got similar errors with 3.2 from
vtkSMExtractDocumentation) using xlc_r/xlC_r .  It compiled successfully,
but attempting to run it yields:

Any clues? I'm not using MPI, but I am compiling 64-bit and linking against

I thought about this a bit more because it deserves a better answer
than "it's a missing feature".

* First, if the blocks form a large image without any overlaps, it is
possible to use pvti/vti or a custom reader to load them as a single
block image data in parallel. It would then be possible to volume
render it.

* Second, a collection of images can be loaded as a 1-level AMR
dataset. We have been working on volume rendering of AMR. Currently,
it is not very high priority but we will get there.

* Third, it should be possible to volume render an arbitrary
multi-block of non-overlapping image data. We will eventually get
there but probably not very soon.

Makefiles work on the same machine.
Is there anything that can be done about this?  The .xcodeproj is only 14

Just thinking out loud...
   Is there any idea _why_ xcode will not build paraview? Are the  
project files not being generated correctly? Not enough ram to  
effectively build it? Maybe the code-sense is chewing up all the ram?
    The makefile version of ParaView does work so is it possible to  
have cmake generate an "Xcode makefile" Project. One where the Xcode  
project actually just references the makefile which is a valid  
project type in Xcode?
    Have we come upon a limitation in project size for Xcode? Any one  
posted to the Xcode-users mailing list to get any ideas from those  
folks?

Again. just thinking out loud.

Note that this option may move some time in the future, probably to the settings dialog box (but not until ParaView 3.6 at the earliest).  See bug #6386).

Ok, for future AIX victims, here's what it took to get it to work (Gotta
credit Sean Z for helping with this).

* Using xlc_r/xlC_r compilers
* with OBJECT_MODE=64 set
* Modified CMake/ParaViewCommon.cmake to Change the initfini line to add to
the MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY, not C_FLAGS
* Added the following to my CMakeCache:
    echo "CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-q64 -D_LARGE_FILES" >> CMakeCache.txt
    echo "CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-q64 -D_LARGE_FILES" >> CMakeCache.txt
    echo "CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-q64 -bbigtoc" >> CMakeCache.txt
    echo "CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-q64" >> CMakeCache.txt

And lo and behold.. It works now (with the 3.2.1 branch & CVS Head).

Subject: [Paraview] is there a way to triangulate data in Paraview?
Message-ID: <88F1DEA7-04FB-48B8-9FF5-FF944F8A592A@gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

Many of you may know Tecplot. One of the nice features about this  
program, is that you can dump raw data in a file with no format at  
all, then it takes the first three columns as the X, Y and Z  
coordinates and the following columns as separate variables and you  
can have as many of them as you want. Then you can triangulate the  
data and automatically you can obtain contour plots and so on.

I was wondering if this can also be done in Paraview and how. I've  
been using the .vtu format so I'm used to the output of point and cell  
data. I searched for a while for something similar in Paraview but I  
found nothing. Can anyone mention if this can be done?

Thank you,

aa

That's not supported yet, but it should be in the future.  It basically just requires some readers and/or filters, but I would like to see better support for tables in ParaView before solving this in earnest.  This feature request is more-or-less addressed by bug #5016.

Not working how?  It crashes? it's stuck in an infinite loop? what? 
Which version of CMake?  Of paraview?  Of Xcode?  You're not telling
enough for anyone to help.

Nobody is able to open the xcodeproj with Xcode. Xcode crashes when opening
it...

Haven't tried it myself, but that seems to be the consistent report from
everybody I've talked to who has tried it...

Well I thought I would try and see what was going on but trying with  
the CVS HEAD from this morning I get the following error when trying  
to run cmake on a clean build directory for ParaView 3 generating an  
Xcode project:

-- Found Qt-Version 4.3.3
-- Found Qt-Version 4.3.3
CMake Error: Can't Find a 32 Bit Float
CMake Error: Can't Find a 32 Bit Float
-- Found Qt-Version 4.3.3

-- Application: DobranoViz enabled
-- Plugin: Prism enabled
-- OSX_PluginUpdater being run for PrismServerPlugin
-- Found Qt-Version 4.3.3
-- OSX_PluginUpdater being run for PrismClientPlugin
-- Configuring done

So.. someone get me past this and then onto why Xcode is dying. Those  
that CAN get an Xcode project to create from CMake, when you launch  
Xcode and it crashes does it offer to send a report to Apple? If so  
answer YES to get the crash dump and post it here or get on the xcode- 
users mail list at apple and post it there. I am sure they would be  
very interested in knowing about this.

Did Apple offer any other advice on how to reduce the memory  
footprint? If it is just the fact of a project file being too large  
then almost all hope is shot.. but there are a few things to look at.

1: Create an Xcode project that uses makefiles instead of its own  
build system internals but listing all the files may be the problem  
here.

2: Create the Xcode project that contains project references to  
subprojects (in the case of paraview, each subdirectory would have  
its own project file, like vtk, etc). This may make each project file  
smaller and therefor loadable by Xcode. This does mean that using  
Xcode now requires lots of windows to be open but that may be the  
price that is paid for Apples inability to create a project file that  
scales well.

Now knowing where the problem lies I am just guessing at this point  
on how to reduce the memory footprint so the Xcode project scales  
better.. or the CMake team has just found the limit for Xcode and  
that is how the world works in "Apple Land".

Personally I find Xcode lacking in C++ support (Code sense wise) so I  
use Eclipse CDT with makefiles.

Again. just my 2 cents.

Ah sorry.  I suspect this has been discussed on the paraview list...
This thread seems to be cross posted to both cmake and paraview lists...
as I only read the cmake list, I think I'm missing context.

Xcode is renowned for performing poorly with large projects.  Still,
someone should file a bug at
<http://bugreport.apple.com>

Could someone maybe put some cmake code into the main ParaView CMake  
list that tests for someone trying to create Xcode projects and  
direct them to create Makefile projects instead? At least during CVS  
development? This might save more users from spending needless time  
trying to get things to work when it might never work.

I can build ParaView on a Macbook with 2 GB of Ram using Xcode 2.4 on  
Mac 10.4.
The only setting I changed was to build shared libraries.
Ram usage was about 750 MB through the whole process.

What version of ParaView is this? CVS or 3.2?

On the current CVS my Macbook with 2GB of ram will start compiling with 
xcodebuild, but will fail 1 or 2 projects in.

I was though able to compile ParaView with makefiles, and then force the 
cmake to make xcode projects for plugins without problem.

CVS ParaView (which is probably a bit bigger than 3.2) 
and I used CMake 2.6.

You all are farther than me with ParaView CVS. I can not even get  
CMake 2.4.8 to generate the xcode project.

Looks like I was using CMake 2.4 to build ParaView, I will try upgrading 
CMake and see if that fixes the problem.

I'm sorry I was frustrated.

CMake 2.4.8
CVS HEAD from yesterday
Xcode 3.1(beta)
running xcodebuild at the command line xcodebuild Paraview.xcodeproj

onhbl-delineation1:xcodebuild onhbluser$ xcodebuild ParaView.xcodeproj
xcodebuild(37191,0xa0491fa0) malloc: *** mmap(size=2097152) failed (error

This previously worked on an old cvs head checkout (Feb 8 I believe)with the
same tools.

This is the crash dump from Xcode, but that never worked for me.

Subject: [Paraview] Extents in PVTI Files
Message-ID: <4823703A.60308@psc.edu>

I'd like to use a pvti file to read many vti files but the attached example fails with messages like this:

===
Process id: 9 >> ERROR: In /usr/local/packages/paraview/Edge/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLPStructuredDataReader.cxx, line 452
vtkXMLPImageDataReader (0x1a41c8f0): No available piece provides data for the following extents:
    127 191  63 127  0 63
The UpdateExtent cannot be filled.
===

Each of the vti files can be displayed just fine and have these parameters:
  origin 0 0 0
  spacing 1 1 1
  extent 0 127 0 127 0 127

In the pvti file I'm a little confused about the definition of extent and cannot find the answer in the VTK file format guide. The key lines in my file are these:

   <Piece Extent="000 127 000 127 000 127" Source="test0.vti"/>
   <Piece Extent="128 255 000 127 000 127" Source="test1.vti"/>

I've seen examples where the two files overlap by one point so that the above two lines would read

   <Piece Extent="000 127 000 127 000 127" Source="test0.vti"/>
   <Piece Extent="127 255 000 127 000 127" Source="test1.vti"/>

Is that an unstated requirement for pvti? I'm using ParaView from CVS around 5/6. This problem occurs when running standalone or with a server running in parallel on a Linux cluster.

I was using the 32-bit 3.2.1 that I downloaded on a 64-bit machine.

Today I tested the 64-bit 3.2.1 on my 64-bit machine and it functions 
correctly. I can see the animation in the PV window.
Problem solved.

I am going to cross post to paraview and Cmake because I am not sure  
which one is the better place.

System: OS X 10.4.11, Core Duo (original) 2 GB Ram, Xcode 2.5.  
ParaView CVS, CMake 2.6.0 Release.

I had to use CMake 2.6 to generate the project files as CMake 2.4.8  
would not generate them for some reason. Xcode took a little bit to  
open the project file (1 minute maybe) but then started compiling.  
Then I went to bed...

  When I checked in the morning there were 2 compile errors on the  
vtknetcdf library compilation.

/Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/VTK/Utilities/vtknetcdf/error.c:  
In function 'strerror':
/Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/VTK/Utilities/vtknetcdf/error.c: 
29: error:  conflicting type qualifiers for 'sys_nerr'
/usr/include/stdio.h:273: error: previous declaration of 'sys_nerr'  
was here
/Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/VTK/Utilities/vtknetcdf/error.c: 
30: error: conflicting types for 'sys_errlist'
/usr/include/stdio.h:274: error: previous declaration of  
'sys_errlist' was here

I think this probably has more to do with how the cmake files are  
written because this works with "makefiles".

So, for me, I would say that an Xcode build 'may' work, but I am  
getting errors so I just don't know. But at least it hasn't errored  
out and crashed.

Kent,

I believe the problem lies in the extent of the vti files. They cannot
be  0 127 0 127 0 127. They have to be with respect to the "global"
extent. For example, one of them may be 128 255 0 127 0 127...

Karl,

The vtkXdmfWriter is not yet up to date with the new version
of XDMF. I think it can handle basic geometry but nothing
complex. Until it's fixed, the best you can do is to run 
the data thru a triangle filter first to make it all tets.
But I doubt that's what you're looking for.

There is a mixed topology type in the new version of XDMF
so supporting it that way will be an option. Otherwise it
would be GridType="Tree" with two "Uniform" children :

<Grid GridType="Tree" ...
	<Grid GridType="Uniform" ..
		<Topology TopologyType="Hex" ..
	<Grid GridType="Uniform" ...
		<Topology TopologyType="Wedge" ...
</Grid>

I'm getting an error trying to write an XDMF file with different cell  
types (wedges and hexes).   Looking at the source code this appears to  
be generated from the vtkXdmfWriter.cxx line 1322.    Does anybody  
have a sense for the difficulty of removing this constraint?

    Thanks,

Thanks! That made no difference. The first vti file uses

   WholeExtent="0 127 0 127 0 127"
   Piece Extent="0 127 0 127 0 127"

and the second one now uses

   WholeExtent="128 255 0 127 0 127"
   Piece Extent="128 255 0 127 0 127"

Using 32 proccesses the error messages say the following extents cannot be filled:

    127 128  0 63  0 63
    127 128  0 63  63 95
    127 128  0 63  95 127
    127 128  63 95  0 63
    127 128  95 127  0 63
    127 128  63 127  63 95
    127 128  63 127  95 127

This may be irrelevant but its interesting to note that all include the "gap" at (127,128) between the two vti files. So I again ask, is there an unstated requirement that the vti files must overlap?

TIA!

Oops. I didn't read the first message carefully. Yes, the points at

Hi,
I have successfully implemented a reader for my data as a PV plugin. It 
loads separate files correctly, refuses, however, to read the whole 
series (file_01.h5, file_02.h5, etc.). How do I go about achieving the 
same effect as the native readers to have a series as transient data?
Thanks for any hints.

Take a look at <http://titanium.imts.us/viewvc/Task_4/PVDislocation/src/DislocationReaders/vtkPrdsMultiOutDislocationReader.cxx?view=markup>
 to see how I did a time series reader.

Basically in RequestInformation  you will need to determine the the
range of times that your data covers, probably by opening each file or
some other means. Then set
    double timeRange[2];
    timeRange[0] = lowestTimeValue
    timeRange[1] = highesetTimeValue
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(),
timeRange, 2);

Also, you will need to have the following in your header:

   vtkSetMacro(TimeStep, int);
   vtkGetMacro(TimeStep, int);

 int GetNumberOfTimeSteps();

Now, down in the RequestData() Method you can get the requested time
step from the
pipeline and then open and read the data from the proper data file.

int tsLength = outInfo->Length(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
  double* steps = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
  // Check if a particular time was requested.
  if(outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS()))
  {
    // Get the requested time step. We only supprt requests of a single time
    // step in this reader right now
    double *requestedTimeSteps =
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS());
    this->TimeValue = requestedTimeSteps[0];

    // find the first time value larger than requested time value
    // this logic could be improved
    int cnt = 0;
    while (cnt < tsLength-1 && steps[cnt] < this->TimeValue)
      {
      cnt++;
      }
    this->ActualTimeStep = cnt;
  }

  if (this->TimeStep > -1)
  {
    this->ActualTimeStep = this->TimeStep;
  }

  if (this->ActualTimeStep >= this->TimeStepRange[0] &&
this->ActualTimeStep <= this->TimeStepRange[1]) {
    vtkSmartPointer<DislocationReader> reader =
vtkSmartPointer<DislocationReader>::New();
    reader->SetFileName(this->FileName);
    reader->SetTimeStep(this->ActualTimeStep);
    //reader->SetInformationVector(outputVector);
    reader->SetFileOffsets(this->FileOffsets);
    reader->read();
    vtkUnstructuredGrid* grid;
    grid = reader->GetDislocations();
    dislocations->ShallowCopy(grid);

   // dislocations->SetBlock(0, grid);    // Block 0 is the Dislocation Data
    grid = reader->GetSimulationBox();
    simBox->ShallowCopy(grid);
    //dislocations->SetBlock(1, grid); // Block 1 is the Simulation Limits
  } else {
      std::cout << "vtkPrdsMultiOutDislocationReader: Timestep was out
of Range: " << this->ActualTimeStep << std::endl;
      std::cout << "vtkPrdsMultiOutDislocationReader: Timestep Range:"
<< this->TimeStepRange[0] << " -> " << this->TimeStepRange[1] <<
std::endl;
      return 0;
  }


This code is specific to my case where I have a whole separate reader
for my data where I feed it the name of the file to read and then tell
it to read the file and get the output. This may also be the case for
you also.

Hope some of the helps.

Mike

OK so this is basically about reading the series myself explicitly. But 
one thing is not clear to me: I am deriving my readers from 
vtkDataReader, after UnstructuredGridReader and StructuredPointsReader, 
who can read time series somehow, so this functionality must be already 
in somewhere (upstream). There is no explicit time series handling in 
those classes and yet they work, so why mine do not? I can see that you 
do derive your reader from vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm, and not 
vtkDataReader, why? I wonder if I really have to re-implement it and if 
there is no simpler way to achieve the goal, like taking advantage of 
some existing functionality.
Thanks, Dominik

I think at some point when I started writing custom readers there was  
a statement somewhere that basically said starting with  
vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm (or any of the other *Algorithms) was  
appropriate for a custom reader so that is why I selected that as my  
superclass. Also, I needed more/different functionality from my  
readers AND my actual file readers do NOT depend on VTK so they can  
be stand alone if needed.

Thanks a lot to both of you for very helpful hints. I am going to 
evaluate both solutions.

I followed the Wiki and moved my reader to internal_sources, and added 
corresponding entry to 'sources' with

<SubProxy>
<Proxy name="Reader" proxygroup="internal_sources" 
proxyname="vtkHDF5ImageReader">
</Proxy>
</SubProxy>

(the rest copy/paste from the original readers.xml)

Now opening my files in PV results in:

ERROR: In 
/scratch/domel/src/ParaView3-cvs-20080505/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMProxyManager.cxx, 
line 329
vtkSMProxyManager (0x81882e8): No proxy that matches: group=sources and 
proxy=vtkHDF5ImageReader were found.

Failed to create proxy:  "sources" ,  "vtkHDF5ImageReader"
Error opening file

Of course, it is now in internal_sources! What have I missed?
I tried manipulating the cmake input or gui xml to now success.

Thanks and regards -- Dominik

What do you mean by stand alone? You mean without PV, just VTK?
I guess this is the ultimate way, I saw the same approach in the PV xdmf 
reader (also derived from DataReader).

OK after a longer try and error session I finally figured it out. Here 
is what was not clear to me from the Wiki:

Your old working time unaware reader (vtkMyReader) is moved from 
'sources' to 'internal_sources', as in the Wiki. But you need to rename 
it to something else, like vtkMyReaderCore, while name the NEW time 
aware reader (class="vtkFileSeriesReader" in FileSeriesReaderProxy) as 
vtkMyReader (original name). Then GUI xml needs not be changed, neither 
cmake input, and loading time series works at the least expense. 
Alternatively you can name the new reader with a new name, but then you 
need to change the GUI xml, a little longer way.

Thanks,

Dominik

Should that CVS tag be ParaView-3-3-0 instead of ParaView-3-2-0?

Any estimates as to when 3.4 will be released or at least close to 
finalized?  I'm wondering whether or not to start building 3.3.0 in 
Fedora rawhide, but it would need to be pretty stable by September for 
this to make sense.

Thanks!

Oops. Thanks for the warning. There is no cvs tag for the snapshot.
Next time, I release a snapshot, I will tag.

I work with sphere, and I have only points  of the geometry. What is the
best way to describe my results in VTK format? I tried using Structured Grid
but I have some problems, I have the spherical geometry but with a plane in
the half sphere. Do you have any idea what I am doing wrong?

Thank you

Message-ID: <BAY122-W35E5E48DBA54EAC25530BAFCCF0@phx.gbl>


Hello,
i have a question about the color bar, it's possible to indicate in the color bar a particular value(i. e a critical temperature, a critical intenisty etc....) with an arrow or changing the color of the label of this value?? It's possible to set the intermediate label between the min and the max of the color bar?? (because i can only set the min, the max and the number of the label in between)
 
Thank's a lot,
 
Samuele

No.  You don't have that much control over the scalar bar labels.  You could
fake it by reducing the number of labels to 2 and then use a text source to
place a number (roughly) at some critical point.

I'm trying to build CVS from source.  pvbatch is built but not installed

Nope. It seems to be an oversight. We'll fix it. Thanks for reporting it.

Hey John,

First, thanks a lot for putting in all this work on the VTK Xdmf  
reader/writer! It's really great to have Xdmf time support from within  
ParaView. I just got around to testing the new functionality with our  
data, and an issue came up that people may want to chime in on:

Our data is a combination of two grids, one of which has been dumped  
from the simulation at a higher time resolution than the other. When  
simultaneously viewing both data sets in ParaView using the current  
vtkXdmfReader, the lower time-resolution data jumps back to time step  
zero if the requested (finer resolution) time step can't be found in  
the set. If I look at the same data with pvd files describing the time  
steps, ParaView displays the previous existing time step until an  
updated one is encountered.

In vtkXdmfReader::RequestData(), would it make sense to find the first  
existing time step which is greater than the requested time (instead  
of trying to find an existing one that matches WithinTolerance()), or  
would this screw up other things? (I'll attach a diff of the simplest  
thing I could think of to test what it would look like.)

It seems that within the new Xdmf time specification, maybe I should  
be using TimeType="Range" to span the times for which each lower time- 
resolution data set are valid, but I'm not sure that that's supported  
yet in the reader, and maybe the default behavior of the reader should  
still be different...?

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Reminder - Early Registration Deadline is May 15th
Message-ID: <4829EFBA.8050002@kitware.com>

** Reminder - Early Registration deadline is May 15th **

Developer's Training Week will be held June 9 ? 13, 2008, in Albany, NY. 


Details
----------

Developer's Training Week will cover our open-source projects including VTK, ITK, ParaView and CMake. These hands-on courses are appropriate for both new users wishing to quickly gain proficiency and experienced developers requiring advanced customization skills. 

As an added bonus, this year the VTK course will be split into two tracks: Beginner and Advanced.  Users who have taken the VTK course in the past are encouraged to attend the Advanced VTK track to learn new skills and functionalities that haven?t been covered in previous VTK trainings.  

Developer?s Training Week is a great opportunity to meet some of the key contributors to these open-source projects as well as other users in the open source community.

As a course attendee, you will receive:
- A complete set of course notes
- The VTK User's Guide
- The Visualization Toolkit textbook
- The ITK Software Guide
- The ParaView Guide
- Mastering CMake
- Snacks daily
- Lunch (Monday through Thursday)
- A dinner reception on both Monday and Wednesday evening

The week will be divided into 9 half-day sessions, allowing attendees to customize their experience based on their individual requirements.  

The cost for registration, per half-day session, is $350 on or before May 15th and $400 from May 16th on.  We are also offering a discounted full week registration rate of $2600 on or before May 15th and $2950 from May 16th on.  Additional student or group discounts are available upon request. Note that attendees must register for a minimum of 3 half-day sessions. 

No prior experience is necessary; however, attendees are expected to have basic knowledge of C or C++ in order to fully participate in the interactive exercises.

Kitware courses incorporate both technical presentations and practical exercises designed to reinforce learning.  For an optimal learning experience each attendee should bring their own laptop computer to the courses. Approximately two weeks before the courses, attendees will receive detailed instructions on how to download, install and test all necessary software on their laptop computer. A limited number of course computers are available for attendees who are unable to bring one.

Additional information is available by emailing courses at kitware.com or by calling 518-371-3971.

would just like to know..

why is there so many still render.. and I know I am reading it wrong..
where can I find extra information about reading the log. or any other

You get a still render every time the render area gets a repaint event.  When I view a data file for the first time, I don't get that many still render entries in the log file.  However, if I drag a window or dialog (like the timer log dialog) over the render area, I get more renders.  So, in short there is probably some window event that is causing ParaView to repaint.

See the attached reply to the original message.

You can add a time stamp by creating an Annotate Time source.

Message-ID: <b0a936c00805150108vc8af9d5q42020794df903f38@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have a pvd file with timestep from 1 to 200 corresponding to the time
0.00005 to 0.001 like

<DataSet time="0.000050" timestep="1" part="001"

Using annotate time filter, I can annotate the timestep but could not
annotate the time correctly (I want to have: time=0.000050, time=0.000100 so
on instead of time=1, time=2 so on). I would be grateful for any
help/suggestions.

I am using latest CVS version.

Hi Dominik,

Thanks for your response - I found you post in the mailing list.  I'm a bit
confused though - do I have to write my own plugin in order to do anything
with time?  Are there no standard formats available?

I downloaded the data files from here:

http://personal.cscs.ch/~jfavre/Projects/vtkLEA/vtklea.htm

When I select to open the file it does group all the files together but it
will only seem to load the first one in.  Do I have to write my own reader
in order to have time steps enabled and return the right data depending on
the time step?  I can't see why there shouldn't be a generic reader to
automatically do this - am I missing something?

Thanks,
Paul

If you have regular vtk legacy files everything should work out of the 
box, just point the file requester to the collapsed group and not a 
single file. If your data is in custom format as mine then you have to 
implement a plugin reader, quite well explained somewhere on the Wiki 
pages. To load time series now you have two choices, either you 
implement time series methods yourself inside your reader (see solution 
by Mike) or add a proxy to your legacy plugin xml file (see solution by 
Berk, and my comments at the end).
hope that helps.

When you load this (collapsed) group of files it will only list the 
first one in your "Pipeline Browser" even though all other files are 
loaded too. After clicking "Apply" just hit the "Play" button and the 
data from all time steps will play.

I found that very confusing too, that the first file name is used for 
the whole group. AFAIK there's no way of telling that there's only one 
file or a whole group of time steps.

Two approaches come to mind:

1) Use the text source to manually place whatever text you want.

2) Use selection to grab a cell from each contour. Use selection
inspector panel to annotate those cells with the data values they
contain.

It's a problem I'm aware of. When multiple streams of data inhabit 
different time frames or integrals/multiples of time,
1) paraview iterates over all and we need a new time mode which only 
steps of the time from the selected pipeline/filter
2) if the time is set and the filter doesn't have it - then your fix 
should be used. However, I put in the WithinTolerance function at an 
early stage of the time implementation and never really intended it to 
stay there. I think the best strategy would be to add a couple of 
methods to vtkAlgorithm that are something like
GetTimeStep(double "some value passed in by the pipelie")
SetTimeStepFetchMode(nearest, next above, next below - default, next below)

and any reader/algorithm which support time can make sure that the 
correct default and time values are setup. We'd need to add such 
lovelies as vtkstd::vector<double> TimeStepValues to vtkAlgorithm - but 
at least it'd save adding time step checking code into every time based 
filter/reader.

Comments anyone? (I currently have the WithinTolerance or similar 
functions in about ten different classes and abstracting them out would 
be nice)

HI,
   I set the simulation time to the timestep variable and it works for  
me.
Example line from my pvd file:
<DataSet timestep="296.8545" group="" part="0"  
file="rns157_Natfreq_slc01_Vtp_ni
d0000_fld0122.vtu"/>

I am not sure if there is a better way but this seems to work.

For a file called "file.xyz.vtk" ParaView will use the plot3d reader - I
would have expected it to be the vtk file format.  This is only a minor bug
as I should not have been so lazy when converting files!... but it had me

Currently there's no way of canceling the execution of a filter. (The 
'cross' is not enabled when a filter is executing). The 'cross' is 
enabled only when saving animations/geometry which can be canceled by 
clicking the 'cross'.

Yes, that is how you are supposed to set the time value for each timestep.  There is no need to specify a time index (it would be redundant).  The time parameter of the DataSet tag is ignored.

The confusion in the name in the pipeline browser never occurred to me.  It looks easy enough to fix, so I submitted a bug report and should have a fix in CVS tomorrow.

FYI, you can get the time steps the file or series of files supports by looking at the bottom of the Information tab.

Sounds good.  I'll start tracking CVS in Fedora rawhide in anticipation 
of that.

Just to clarify, only some of the readers support file series. We will
add support for the rest by 3.4. I can't remember what the lea files
are, maybe vti? If they are vti, the only way to load them a time
series is to write a pvd file that groups them as a time series.

Hi Berk,

You are right - the files are of type vti.  It's good to hear that all will
support time series by 3.4 though.

I'm not sure whether I will need to write my own reader for my case.  I will
have several unstructured grids with a solution for each time step.  It
would be inefficient to write the grid each time step.  Is there any
documentation on pvd files - I'm not sure whether it will do what I want
here

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Save screenshot and Intel graphics: a workaround
Message-ID: <482D5528.4000109@astr.ucl.ac.be>

I'm posting this for a co-worker here:


Hello everyone,


As some people have already mentioned it, ParaView (here version 3.2.1,
but it's also true for previous versions) displays loads of errors when
you save an image with Intel Graphics cards. This problem seems to be
related to offscreen rendering (see
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-June/003294.html), and
it has been settled for Apple, but I don't know why it's not for others
computers using Intel Graphics as well.

For Paraview 3.2.1, "Save Screenshot" gives you several:

X Error: GLXBadContext 154
Extension: 143 (Uknown extension)
Minor opcode: 5 (Unknown request)
Resource id: 0x300b6f1

while your file is saved but is completely black.

Here is a little workaround (inspired by
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtkusers/2006-August/086674.html,
tested on Ubuntu Gutsy, but clearly there's
no reason why it shouldn't work for other distributions). You will have
to compile ParaView from source, so read the documentation on the Wiki:

1) Download the sources + uncompress

2) Comment lines 1027 and 1046 of the file
/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMRenderViewProxy.cxx which look like:

#if !defined(__APPLE__)
this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(1);
#endif

and

#if !defined(__APPLE__)
this->GetRenderWindow()->SetOffScreenRendering(0);
#endif

2) Download all the stuff necessary to install ParaView (e.g.: sudo
apt-get install cmake)

3) In order to avoid compiling QT from source, download the different
libs of QT4.2.3 successively:
a) http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/i386/libqt4-core/download
b) http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/i386/libqt4-gui/download
c) http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/i386/libqt4-sql/download
d) http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/i386/libqt4-qt3support/download
e) http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/i386/libqt4-dev/download

4) mkdir ../paraview-bin

5) cd ../paraview-bin

6) ccmake ../ParaView3.2.1/

7) Configure and generate with your options (in my case I haven't
modified the options, just press c + c + g)

8) make [wait... a bit less than one hour on my laptop (centrino
1.73GHz, 1Gb RAM)]
Caution: it will generate about 1.2 GB files and binaries!

9) su [pwd] + make install

10) Done!

Note that these steps are identical for previous versions of ParaView,
just find the file and the two lines to be commented in your version.

Finally, another trick has been proposed involving the 'ServerLayout'
section in the /etc/xorg.conf (but I haven't tested it) here:
http://openfoam.cfd-online.com/forum/messages/1/4438.html


' hope it helps! Good luck!

Hi,

This is an example of my pvd file and writer in C language for them. I have
a series of unstractured grids in time .vti files.

I hope this helps.

Actually, I misspoke. There is an install target for pvbatch. I just
verified that it gets installed as part of my nightly binary build for
snapshots. That build has rpath turned off. I am now testing with
rpath on. Can you verify if this is still happening?

Message-ID: <BLU136-W3275CFE26BC86505B8062BA5C80@phx.gbl>


Hi all,
 
I was trying to do a calculation like scalar_a/Scalar_b, 
 
error occurred: 
ERROR: In /home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkFunctionParser.cxx, line 1292
vtkFunctionParser (0x99e1368): Syntax error: input to math function not in parentheses; see position 3
 
And I tried a simpler one, just to divide by a number, like scalar_a/2,  It has the same error. 
Could anyone tell me what's going wrong here? 
 
Thanks a lot!!

Hi,
I'm a new user of Paraview (paraview.app-3.2.1) Previously I could start
Paraview and saw the GUI on both PC and Mac. But now,  when I double click
Paraview, I always see the following error message: ASSERT failure in
QList<T>:: operator[]: "index out of range", file
c:\qt\4.2.3\include\qtcore\../../src/corelib/tools/qlist.h, line 376.
This applies to both PC and Mac.

Could anyone help me with this situation? Thanks a lot!

Best regards,
Chiang

I can confirm this error running Paraview 3.3.0 using an Intel 945GM 
integrated graphics.

I'm proceding to recompile and testing the given suggestion.

  Adding

  to the

  Section "ServerLayout"

  in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

  solved the problem with my intel 945 graphic card (2nd solution in the

Hi everyone, I have run my polydata file on Paraview, and attached is
the result I obtained from the timer log. I was wondering if someone
could explain the results, as I only understand partially. From what I
understand,the images are being sent back to the local machine for
rendering..and the processing happens at the servers.. am I right...
what does vtkPVUpdateSuppressor and ordered
vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor do..?

Subject: [Paraview] How to run paraview in parallel
Message-ID: <b05971d10805190256n3163a03fha060122c2c5d5e6d@mail.gmail.com>

hi again

I just want to make sure that I am doing the right thing, I followed some
manual online to run my data on paraview ( built on a cluster )

I did using 2 approaches

My data is in a XML Polydata format

Approach A

1) Load the data

2) Run the D3 filer

3) And then run Process ID scalar to show the difference



Approach B

1) Load the data

2) save the data -- I read the below notes from paraview wiki

What does "Save Data" entry in the file menu do when you are running more
than one process ?

When running one process, "Save Data" creates a file from the current data
set in ParaView. When running more than one process, save data creates
spatially distributed files. Each process writes its own data in a file. A
single meta-file pointing to these pieces is also created.

3) Run the D3 filer

4) And then run Process ID scalar to show the difference



What am I doing wrong.. which approach should I follow...? Thanks.

Hi,

When trying to configure Paraview build 3.2.1 with ccmake I get the
following errors:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (GET_PROPERTY):
get_property not given a PROPERTY <name> argument.
CMake Error at VTK/CMakeLists.txt:26 (GET_PROPERTY):
get_property not given a PROPERTY <name> argument.
CMake Error at VTK/Utilities/vtktiff/CMakeLists.txt:39 (EXPORT):
export Unknown arguments.
CMake Error at VTK/Utilities/MaterialLibrary/CMakeLists.txt:19 (EXPORT):
export Unknown arguments.

I couldn't find any similar problems in the archives, I have installed
Qt 4.2.3 from source and checked that qtdemo works, I have also
managed to compile VTK. I am running Centos 5.1 x86_64. Any
suggestions will be much appreciated,
Tim

Hello,

vtkPVUpdateSuppressor's main purpose is to break the visualization
pipeline into segments across processors. It suppresses vtk's pipeline
update mechanism on segments that don't have a full path upstream to
the data.  Instead, each processor's pipeline ends with a PVUS, and
the client calls their ForceUpdate methods synchronously to make it
all function as an unbroken pipeline would.

vtkOrderedCompositeDistributor is inserted into the Render Server's
pipeline. When transparency is used, it shuffles the data pieces
around so that they are rendered in back to front order.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

In your particular case, they don't really do anything significant to
performance. They simply pass their input to their output.

and 2.6. ParaView 3.2.1 will configure fine with ccmake version 2.4.8.

Is there anything to suggest that something is wrong?  Nothing you are doing strikes me as an error.

There really isn't any difference between the two approaches except that in approach B you save the data.  If you don't really want to read that data in again, then the save step is unnecessary.  If you do want to read the data in, then you may want to consider saving the data after running D3 so that you don't have to process it with D3 the next time you load the data.

The difference between saving data in serial and parallel is the file formats offered.  In parallel, you can only use a file format that supports writing in parallel.  I think all the current parallel writers create a separate file per process and a metafile to point to them all.

-Ken

Subject: [Paraview] How to run paraview in parallel


hi again

I just want to make sure that I am doing the right thing, I followed some manual online to run my data on paraview ( built on a cluster )

I did using 2 approaches

My data is in a XML Polydata format

Approach A

1) Load the data

2) Run the D3 filer

3) And then run Process ID scalar to show the difference



Approach B

1) Load the data

2) save the data -- I read the below notes from paraview wiki

What does "Save Data" entry in the file menu do when you are running more than one process ?

When running one process, "Save Data" creates a file from the current data set in ParaView. When running more than one process, save data creates spatially distributed files. Each process writes its own data in a file. A single meta-file pointing to these pieces is also created.

3) Run the D3 filer

4) And then run Process ID scalar to show the difference



What am I doing wrong.. which approach should I follow...? Thanks.

Hmm.  That's strange.  The only thing I can think of is perhaps you installed something else that contains conflicting dynamic libraries.  Do you have any other applications that use Qt or VTK?

Hi,

I'm a new user of Paraview (paraview.app-3.2.1) Previously I could start Paraview and saw the GUI on both PC and Mac. But now,  when I double click Paraview, I always see the following error message: ASSERT failure in QList<T>:: operator[]: "index out of range", file c:\qt\4.2.3\include\qtcore\../../src/corelib/tools/qlist.h, line 376.
This applies to both PC and Mac.

Could anyone help me with this situation? Thanks a lot!

Best regards,
Chiang

I cannot replicate this error.  I tried both of your expressions in ParaView 3.2.1 on Windows and it worked fine.  What version of ParaView are you using?

I tracked this down. I can fix it but there are other issues with
using RPATHs. If you set VTK_USE_RPATH to OFF in your build, it will
work. By default VTK_USE_RPATH is set to ON for all development
versions (odd minor version) and OFF for all release version (even
minor version). So setting VTK_USE_RPATH to OFF will reproduce what
you will get once you start building 3.4.

Subject: [Paraview] vectors' and scalar's field in glyph
Message-ID: <4832D9AB.6080604@student.ecp.fr>

Hello,
I use a glyph on my model in order to observ my vector's field. 
Nevertheless, some scalars' values (such as pression or temperature) are 
added on the model. And when I change this scalar, it changes the 
intensity of my vector's fields. Also, what's the meaning of this 
scalars? is it possible not to display them?
Thank you for your answer, regards,

Sylvain

Hi folks,

I will rename the old ParaView repository sometime this week. So, to
check ParaView versions before 3.0, you will have to do

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaViewOld co ParaView

instead of

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at www.paraview.org:/cvsroot/ParaView co ParaView

The current repository will stay ParaView3 as before.

Best,

Message-ID: <43a689850805200746u5c277c8bnd6c9fc154ea20c15@mail.gmail.com>

I am writing another custom reader for our data and I had a question
about setting the output port information. If I have my reader derive
from PolyDataAlgorithm, and I generally know how many "data sets"
there will be, can those datasets actually be something other than a
vtkPolyData object? For example in our data we have 3 distinct pieces
of data that we want to be able to display. 2 of those are vtkPolyData
objects, but the third is a group of unknown (at compile time) number
of vtkPolyData objects which I was thinking of grouping into a
vtkMultiBlockDataset?

So in the FillOutputPortINformation(int port, vtkInformation* info)
method can I do something like:

if (port == 0 || port ==1)
  info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkPolyData");
else if (port == 2)
 info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkMultiBlockDataset");

Is this possible? and if it is, what ramifications would that have on
other parts of the pipeline such as applying filters to only the
port=2 datasets or the port==1 data set?

Thanks for any insight into this.

Are you referring to the "Scalars" selector in the glyph's object inspector?  That value should be ignored so long as you set the "Scale Mode" to anything other than "scalar".

Yes, this is the right way of doing it (except not matching VTK coding style :-)

Since each output port is treated separately in ParaView (meaning, you
apply filters to them separately), this will work just fine.

Make sure to list the output ports in the XML. Search for OutputPort
in readers.xml for an example.

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple grid zones in vtk file formats for ParaView
Message-ID: <48331744.6010606@sei.aero>

Hello All,

I am in the process of writing my CFD output to a VTK file format, 
either the legacy or the unstructured XML format for use in ParaView. 
I would like to be able to select different zones of my grid (body surface 
versus flow volume) for the display of my output variables.

Is there a way to specify grid zones in these file formats?

I would prefer not to create two separate output files to be read in 
independently. 

Thanks for the input,

Scott

The easiest way to do this is probably to use the Ensight file format
with multiple parts.

You could write out the zones in different files and then point to them with
a .pvd or .vtm file.

After reading your message a second time I noticed that you'd like to 
save the body surface as a grid zone (part). Note that it's quite easy 
to extract the body surface using ParaView. You just need to use the 
extract surface and clip filters. In this way you can avoid the work to 
filter this data in your own application.

Hope it helps you

Renato.

Message-ID: <1b61cab90805202144o241d4a3dnb293d457c68427a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

"Save Animation" does not work with Paraview-3.3.0 while it does with
Paraview-3.2.1.

The minimal procedure I've found to reproduce this problem is:
 1) Select "sources" -> "Cone" (or "Box" or whatever),
 2) then Select "file" -> "Save Animation",
just as shown in the attached image.

If it works, you will have 10 identical images with a cone, and
actually I do with Paraview-3.2.1. However, with Paraview-3.3.0, I
only get 10 *blank* images.

My platform is:
 - Mac Pro (Intel)
 - Mac OS X 10.5.2
 - NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT

Is this a bug with Paraview-3.3.0?

Thank you.
Shigenobu

Message-ID: <48340801.5050508@cscs.ch>

The thread initiated yesterday on file formats gives me an opportunity 
to share some results with the list.

on the question of which file format to use to store large CFD 
simulation results, I ran the following tests with EnSight Gold, the 
VTK-XML formats, and Xdmf. Here are my findings and my final 
implementation to store a time-varying rectilinear grid of over 1 
billion cell.

A) The original format used was EnSight Gold Binary.
It worked well for small data; it does not work at all for data above 
the 1 billion threshold.

I had many troubles to read the file because:

each scalar field is stored in a file larger than 4Gb
the FileSize variable is stored in VTK as a 32-bit int. See 
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=4687. Even after changing it to long 
integers, I had problems later running out of memory (VTK does not 
check) in the following lines of code:

      if (component == 0)
        {
        scalars = vtkFloatArray::New();
        scalars->SetNumberOfComponents(numberOfComponents);
        scalars->SetNumberOfTuples(numPts);
        }
   
      scalarsRead = new float[numPts];
      this->ReadFloatArray(scalarsRead, numPts);

// bad memory allocations go unchecked and the loop below crashes

      for (i = 0; i < numPts; i++)
        {
        scalars->SetComponent(i, component, scalarsRead[i]);
        }

I'll add also that reading EnSight data in parallel actually duplicates 
the whole mesh in memory before each pvserver can extract its own piece 
(AFAIK). This also lead to many crashes because of running out of memory.

B) After removing the loop above, by-passing the second array 
allocation, and doing more cleanup, I am able to read the data. I tried 
to save it in the VTK-XML format. This does not work either because it 
uses some 32-bit counters which go into overflow. This was also reported

C) Second option was to save the data with the vtkXdmfWriter. It works 
fine, but takes 30 minutes per timestep for a billion cell grid.

D) I took over the writing of my own HDF5 data and re-used the Xdmf 
wrapper. Writing takes now 30 seconds for two scalar fields. Each file 
is 9.4 Gb.

E) My final solution now includes the time-dependent support recently 
added by J. Clarke, J Biddiscombe et al. in the Xdmf stuff. I write my 
own HDF5 datasets, and I am happilly reading the solution in parallel on 
24 pvservers. Reading (using the Xdmf reader) does not show the same 
overhead than the writing part. However, we think that the vtk-Xdmf 
writing is slow because data is copied from the vtk array into an Xdmf 
array, one value at a time - if this restriction were removed (and the 
Xdmf writer used the vtk pointer directly), it would probably be as good 
as hand written hdf5 code.

All of my tests were done with the CVS version of ParaView3.

My 2 cents to the discussion how to store large (CFD) data.
I know nothing of the Ensight format so I comment on HDF5 and Xdmf.

The idea behind Xdmf is great, but the actual implementation is very 
poor. Especially to newcomers, I suggest to use self made HDF5 files and 
implement a custom reader for VTK/PV instead of using Xdmf. The very 
annoying reason is that Xdmf is only for the C world and if you generate 
some of your files using Matlab or FORTRAN you will run into serious 
compatibility problems. Reading/writing Xdmf from under Fortran is no 
fun, to say the least, while HDF5 is easy. For Matlab Xdmf is easy, only 
very inefficient (matrix transposing). An elegant solution would be to 
add support for column-major ordering of matrices in Xdmf *AS WELL AS* 
efficiently implementing the required conversions. Currently it is not 
the case, so you are safer doing things yourself to avoid storage lock-in.

regards,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] [pv 3.1.0] viz of "big" data...
Message-ID: <48341262.7080108@free.fr>

Hi,

I would like to visualize my "cloud data" which has 27e6 points.

I have an ascii file (format "x y z v" per line)
or raw binary data (x0, y0, z0, v0, x1, y1, z1, v1...).

Is it possible to visualize directly these data ?
I tried to read my files, unsuccessfully.

Or should I use another file format ?
Which one, for data around 100e6 points ?

TIA.


Cheers,

You will have to either generate the data in a VTK native format (well 
documented) or implement your own reader (a bit harder, but longer 
sighted) preferably for data based on HDF5. Then you can either display 
the points literally as points (dots) or run some alpha shapes (I think 
the delaunay filter has it) on it to see the surface.

Ok, I already have this kind of tools.
I was wondering if merely exist built-in for paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] Newbie question about simulation
Message-ID: <a9dd13f70805210829j7a35c032ld8edca193c29de50@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm a complete newcomer to Paraview, and wanted to get some guidance
from experts.

I'm tasked with developing a simulation of cave development processes,
and visualizing it in a 3D model.  ParaView had been suggested as a
possible platform for this.

Based on what I've read so far, my thinking is that I'll have to have
an external program to generate time coded data, and read that data
into ParaView to visualize the results of the simulation.

This seems like it isn't using ParaView's strengths, so I have a
feeling I'm missing a way to more fully use ParaView as part of the
simulation, rather than an after the fact visualization.  Can anyone
point me in that direction?

Or, if ParaView isn't the application to use for this, what would be
recommended?  I'd also considered using VTK in a Python based
simulation program to visualize the results as the simulation was
running.

Any advice at this early stage would be appreciated.

Jay

An end-to-end analysis using a simulation usually requires the use of at least three tools.  A meshing (and/or CAD) tool provides the basic structure, parameters, and initial conditions on which to perform the simulation.  The simulation tool of course estimates physical measurements that would be produced by physical phenomenon.  The visualization tool provides analysis and querying of the data outputted from the simulation.

That's still a bug though (it just happens to have an easy workaround).  I submitted a bug for it.

Message-ID: <1e93c9c0805211139i31275c44kac71dcfd5f28a386@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys, Im using ParaView 3.2.1 on Windows with Quad Buffered OpenGL
and the "--stereo" command line option. Stereo works great when
interacting with data and when I play a test animation within the UI.
Is it possible to render these stereo animations to a stereo *.avi? I
have tried File->Save Animation..., but it saves only one channel
(left-eye?) to the file. Basically, Im looking for a feature similar
to Amira which exports stereo animations as side-by-side movies (PNG
sequences, AVI, MPEG etc).

You have to compile yourself and enable gl2ps package. However, I would 
use it only for simple scenes like surface mesh edges, nothing more.

Hi Paraview users,

I've just bought a new computer and made it a dual-boot (Windows XP Pro 
and Linux 2.6) machine. Then, I donwloaded and installed Paraview 3.2.1 on 
both platforms. To my surprise, Paraview runs at greatly different speeds 
when rendering a unstructured dataset --- about 1.5 s/frame on Windows vs 
10 s/frame on Linux. I am sure in the test I used (1) the same version of 
paraview; (2) same dataset (3) same setting (Edit->Setting), ......

I can see that vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper is used.

A very simple explanation would be the lack of hardware accelerated

Subject: [Paraview] Why Paraview runs much faster on Windows than on
 Linux?

vtkVolumeTextureMapper3D is running on Linux at a speed comparable to on 
Windows, which is an evidence that the video driver on linux works 
efficiently. Is it possible that the driver does a good job at 3D texture 
mapping, and does a poor job at other graphics operations?

Hello,
I have a 3d representation of an object in paraview. Is there some way 
to "rasterize" this object into voxels of a specified volume then export 
the centroids of these voxels?

I welcome any suggestions!!!

Kind regards-
Andy

None of the PV filters to my knowledge. But there is an abundance of 
codes doing this in google, otherwise a custom implementation is not 
difficult either.

Hi Berk,

I see that "Use Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots" cannot be checked at all.
Is this what you meant by the fix?

Thank you.

I'm not sure whether it is related to that fix, but "Annotate Time"
doesn't work with the latest cvs. It works with
http://paraview.org/files/v3.3/May08/paraview.app-3.3.0-Darwin-i386.dmg
and I remember that it also worked with the previous cvs.

Thank you.

I wasn't accurate. "Annotate Time" doesn't work specifically with Animation.

Thank you.

Hi,

I found the Block Scalars filter of the cvs head removes string block
labels of the top level blocks from its output. However the ones for
sub-blocks are copied as expected. Is this intentional?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <20080523114516.kekdvkieio4scc0k@webmail.etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr>

Hi!

I'm student working on Paraview 3.2.1 for the first time with a PowerBook G4
(Mac). I want to create animation with different vtk files about different
time steps. I don't find the way to create this kind of animation, there are
no time values in properties of object inspector.

Morover, I need to apply tensor glyphs on my visualization, but I'm not sure
Tensor glyphs are on Paraview 3.2.1 at the beginning.

Please, Can you help me? It will be very cool.

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] glyphs and vectors (and why?)
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.10.0805231559010.3585@localhost>


  I have a scalar and a vector (I'm using ensight format).

  I want to plot the vectors on a countour of the scalar. So I make the 
contour and then select glyph. If I made the contour without calculating 
normals and gradients, the vector shows in the glyph filter. If, on the 
other hand, I tell the contour filter to calculate the normals and 
gradients (to have a prettier and smoother contour) the vector variable 
vanisheds from the vector select box on the glyph filter inspector.

  Is this a designed feature or a bug?

Subject: [Paraview] two crashes involving sources
Message-ID: <20080524.002713.42403486.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

Me again: this time I got two crashes with the cvs head involving
sources.

1. Launched ParaView and selected Sources->Data Object
Generator. ParaView aborted immediately with the message on the output
window as attached (I'm attaching as a picture since the message could
not be copied as text).

2. Launched ParaView, selected Sources->Programmable Source and
clicked Delete.  The VC++ 2008 IDE said ParaView crashed at line 100 of
vtkPVFilters.dll!vtkPythonProgrammableFilter::UnRegister(vtkObjectBase
* o=0x031e7bc0).

Windows Vista SP1, Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, Qt 4.3.4, CMake
2.6.0, Debug build. Notable CMake flags are
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON,
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON.

Thanks,
Takuya

This sounds like a bug but I can't reproduce it. Do you have a dataset
that demonstrates it?

Could whoever owns sahp6789 please reboot?  This machine will not allow a socket to be created, and thus, ParaView cannot do a client/server connection to any servers.

Please let me know when this has been done, and I will retest.

Yes, shure. From

  ftp://tenorio.lasef.ist.utl.pt/ProjLes/data/pjet.256x384x256/ensightfiles

  files

  interface_v_0005.vec
  interface_pr_0005.scl
  interface.geo
  interdbg.case

  to test (for instance):

  contour pr at -0.15 then glyph

  if (normals, gradient or normals+gradient) are selected in the contour, v 
doesn't appear in the glyph vector select box. if they aren't, everything 
works ok.

  my best,

Hi Ricardo,

If you don't turn on gradients, the contour filter interpolates v
properly. Since you don't really need gradient, you can leave them off
and turn only normals only. When you turn on gradients, the contour
filter is setting them as vectors, replacing the existing vectors.
This is a bug and I will fix it.

Nice :) . I have been doing like you said but suddenly I realized it 
shouldn't be "proprer" behaviour.

Subject: [Paraview] python programmable filter
Message-ID: <483A5B29.7050509@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi users


I wanted to a vtkIdFilter and a vtkLabeledDataMapper in the python 
programmable filter (in order to visualize point ids in pv3.3).

Unfortunately, neither of these classes were located by the programmable 
filter. I get following error message:

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute vtkLabeledDataMapper'



This simple python code fails:

------------

from paraview import vtk
ldm = vtk.vtkLabeledDataMapper()

------------


Does anybody know what I am doing wrong, or why this does not work? I 
checked if the vtk filters are in the paraview source directory: They are!


Thanks for any hints/help


Cheers, Bryn

Subject: [Paraview] build and install pb with pre-loaded cache (3.3.0)

Hi,

I have some troubles compiling ParaView 3.3.0 (cvs from a week ago).
I use a cache file with some preset options  (cmake -C cache.txt 
/path/to/source), and :
there is a pb compiling the paraview/compile_all_py target, which I 
tracked down to the PYTHON_EXECUTABLE cmake variable not being set in the 
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/CMakeLists.txt file.
One solution is to add a FIND_PACKAGE(PythonInterp REQUIRED) before using 
the PYTHON_EXECUTABLE variable (line 616 for instance)
after setting this variable, the vtkQtPython.so library is not installed 
when calling "make install"

I think that is due to my particular choice of options in the pre-loaded 
cache...

Best regards,
Stephane

Here is content of my cache.txt file :

SET(QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE "/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.3.4/bin/qmake" CACHE 
FILEPATH "qmake executable")
SET(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON CACHE BOOL "shared lib build")
SET(BUILD_TESTING OFF CACHE BOOL "testing")
SET(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ON CACHE BOOL "ParaView use python")
SET(PARAVIEW_USE_MPI ON CACHE BOOL "ParaView use mpi")

Only a subset of VTK classes are accessible through ParaView's
programmable filter. These are mostly classes in Common and Filtering.
We have plans to change this. Having said that, you will never be able
to create rendering object from the programmable filter. It is for
filtering only. You have to use the python interface to the server
manager (through the Python shell under the Tools menu) to create
rendering objects. There is an introduction to this interface here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf
I am afraid this API is different than pure VTK API and more limited
because of the client/server support (i.e. you don't have direct
access to VTK objects, only to proxies). You'll probably end up
creating a vtkSMDataLabelRepresentationProxy in some way.
By the way, ParaView already supports labels but limits them to
selections. Once you select a set of cells/points, you go to the
selection inspector and turn on labels. The reason labels are limited
to selections is due to poor rendering performance when a large number
of labels are displayed. We have in the works a new labeling scheme
that changes the number of labels based on the zoom level to give
interactive performance.

Hi Berk,

Thanks for your interest!

Of course I can set it in the preloaded cache, I was just surprised that 
this variable is not checked in the CMakeLists.txt file.
I just had a look, and saw that this variable is automatically set the 
first time you run the ncurses interface. It seems that 
only pre-loaded caches meet this pb, so your solution is fine.

For the vtkQtPython.so not being installed, do you think it is related?

Best
Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] netCDF grids and Paraview 3.3.0
Message-ID: <BAY143-W2297273BF425C4D7BB4CF28AC20@phx.gbl>


Hello
 
Just a quick request for the next stable release of Paraview.
 
I know there are modules for loading/converting netCDF to vtk formats, but I would like to see a full implementation of the import in Paraview, i.e. we can just read in GMT grids in native netCDF format without any reformatting externally.
 
It would appear that this should be a straightforward option to add - hope this gets on the list!
 
How do others deal with netCDF grids and getting them into Paraview for modelling?
 
Thanks
 
Lester

Hello,

We do not have a netcdf reader because that format is generic. You can
store anything you want in a netcdf file. Therefore if ParaView were
to open up a netcdf file it would have no idea what to do with it.

However, the netcdf library is already included in VTK and thus
ParaView. What is missing is a layer which understands the layout of
the specific content you have placed in netcdf files, and then makes
calls into the netcdf library to read the data and map it into
ParaView's internal data structures (vtk data objects). If you wish to
go about doing this, I would recommend taking a look at the
vtkMINCImageReader. Also, the converters that you mention could
probably be adapted into readers.

The same situation is true for the HDF5 library. For that the good
folks at ARL have contributed XDMF to ParaView, which does the mapping
for the data that they store in HDF5 files, based on the data
organization that they use (an XML meta file which describes the
content of the HDF5 file) for their data.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

Do you have to store your data in netCDF? I mean, is this a 3rd party 
code that forces you to use the format? There are more flexible 
solutions than that, in case it is about your own code.

In any case you are right, converting the files externally to vtk is no 
fun. You need to write a plugin reader and that is less difficult than 
it appears.

Hello
 
Thanks for the response.
 
I am sure it is easy to prepare a reader for the netCDF format, but alas I am not a programmer, and nor do I compile the source code to make Paraview: I just use the executable version.
 
I realise that the GMT grid format (netCDF) is a generic format, and is widely used in the geophysics community, so it would be useful to have this format, or a way of getting it into vtk/paraview directly. Is there a windows program that could convert netCDF (GMT grids) to VTK: at present all I have seen is code that needs to be compiled and built to make a custom version of Paraview.
 
The only other option I have is to make the grids as CSV format and hope that Paraview can understand this now in the developer version (3.3.0). I primarily work with Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) for my work, grid processing and manipulation: it can load XYZ data and build regular grids.
 
Thanks

Perhaps this?

http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/

You still need some little compilation with Matlab's mex, but that is 
normally handled by non-techies.

If you are in an academic area the solution would be to get a student to 
do the job for you as a semester project or so. If you are in a 
commercial environment the right way is to hire somebody to write such a 
reader. Depends how big are your datasets, but converting to legacy VTK 
files has very short legs on the longer run.

I replied off list, but in case anyone on list is looking for a netCDF 
reader for paraview

http://www.cscs.ch/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=132

it's state is currently a bit flaky as I have not updated it in a while, 
but some users inform me it is still working fine for them.

Hi John
 
Thanks for the info. It looks like the code would be useful: do you have a version compiled for windows? I notice that Paraview loads plugins, so that would be useful (if a .dll file or such like exists). I have a combined fortran95/C++/C# compiler (Silverfrost FTN95) but not sure if this would do the trick with compling or the procedure.
 
I guess the simplest option is just to get a compatible plugin to read netCDF grids.
 
Failing that I suppose it is a case of dumping out the data from the netCDG(GMT) grids and building the vtk-style format. Does Paraview understand XYZ data? (or XYZt data.)

using the current CVS of PV3, we have errors in pvbatch not being able 
to reload state:

For example:

/from paraview import servermanager
connection = servermanager.Connect()
servermanager.LoadState('/home/jfavre/sphere.pvsm')/

crashes with the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./sphere.py", line 4, in <module>
    servermanager.LoadState('/home/jfavre/sphere.pvsm')
  File 
"/local/apps/ParaView3Build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 1110, in LoadState
    loader.SetRenderViewXMLName(rvname)
AttributeError: SetRenderViewXMLName

Searching through the source code, I could not find the definition of 
SetRenderViewXMLName anywhere.

Commenting out line 1110 of 
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py makes everything 
run smoothly.

have we accidentally lost SetRenderViewXMLName()?

Subject: [Paraview] using pvbatch without X server
Message-ID: <3601525F-5B4F-4BE3-A0EE-D130CF1D7613@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using ParaView, latest stable release 3.2.1, compiled on suse 64  
bits. I wrote a python script with pvbatch to produce some images, and  
all works fine with the X server. (And the python interface is really  
nice and easy to use!)

Then, I compiled ParaView using MESA, since I'd like to use pvbatch  
without the X server. Unfortunately, pvbatch crashes while saving the  
image as JPEG.

There was something on the mailing list: http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-April/007590.html 
, but it is not clear to me what to expect: is the bug fixed, or I am  
doing something wrong? Is it possible to use pvbatch with MESA and  
without an X server?

Thanks for your help,
-Marzio

Hi Marzio,

I am doing exactly what you want but had to switch to the CVS version. Kitware has fixed the problems in that version.

With it you will see warnings about it being unable to find an X server but it will still work. I ran pvbatch in parallel to generate over 2,000 frames for a movie, saving the images as PNG files.

Subject: [Paraview] Plot over time splitting on IDs
Message-ID: <62681DAE-EF7C-4572-AFC2-31E10E9D1998@cs.duke.edu>

Hey All,

I have a collection of vertices that represent biological cells in a  
simulation, read into ParaView (cvs, OS X) as an unstructured grid.  
Because the number of cells in the sim changes over time, I have to  
use a global ID to keep track of cell identities for plotting, etc.  
Since the Xdmf and XML VTK formats do not assign real Global IDs, I  
set this using the Python Programmable Filter  
(GetPointData().SetGlobalIds()).

If I want to plot some scalar over time I select a point, then shift  
the Selection Type to Global IDs in the Selection Inspector, then  
Create Selection. I do the Copy Active Selection in Plot (Extract)  
Selection Over Time and the Copied Selection pane displays the proper  
Global ID.

The problem is that the Plot Selection over time splits the time  
series for that Global ID every time the scalar ID (or whatever you  
call the regular ID or Index) for that vertex changes value. This  
results in a bunch of blocks listed under Root in the Select Block  
pane of the Extract Selection Over Time "Display" tab, all of them  
labeled with the same Global ID (screen cap attached). Checking the  
box next to any one of them displays the short time series in the  
plot, during which the scalar "ID" was constant.

So, for some reason the filter seems to be splitting the data into  
"Blocks" based on scalar ID even when the selection is made based on  
Global ID, and the data for that Global ID exists for the complete  
time series.

This seems like a bug to me, but please let me know if I'm just  
misinterpreting something.

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Reader Interface
Message-ID: <483C5BDE.8040101@psc.edu>

Where can I find information on how a reader is called to update its output? It seems there was an article on the Wiki pages about this but I haven't been able to find it.

The ProcessRequest method is called many times for actions like REQUEST_DATA, REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT, and so on, and I'm not quite sure what should happen for each. The reader will be used in parallel applications.

In particular, I'm trying to figure out whether the "pieces" passed with these actions are the same as the "pieces" in the VTK/XML file formats.

Thanks!

Hey again,

I just figured out an easy way to see the effect (and I forgot to  
mention that this build has MPI turned on, but I'm testing with the  
builtin server):

Create a Time Source with some amplitude in X and Y, but don't check  
Analytic or Growing. Follow this with a Python Programmable Filter  
containing the code below (which should reverse the eight Global IDs  
after time 0.5):

Then, create a Global ID type point selection, and use that for a Plot  
Selection Over Time. When I do this it splits the data into two  
Blocks, one which shows the data for time 0-0.444, and the other from  
0.666-1.0 (0.555 is missing for some reason...).

Thanks,
-Eric

You will need:

* Mesa
* cvs paraview compile with OS mesa support
* use --use-offscreen-rendering flag to pvbatch

Message-ID: <20080528.094603.162612937.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I found another problem: with the latest cvs head it is possible to
color objects with either one of the components of a vector variable
or its magnitude. That's working fine, but if I toggle color legend on
when showing magnitude, the labeling in Color Legend won't change from
"Magnitude" after I change the coloring variable to e. g. component
0. Even if I repeat toggling the legend off and on the labeling
doesn't change. I think this is a bug...?

Hi Berk, hi users


In version 2 of pv, there was a way to write png files of an animation. 
In version 3 this has been replaced by the save animation (to avi) option.

Unfortunately this crashes on my system (Debian Sarge). I sometimes am 
even logged out after the crash and loose everything that was open/unsaved.

Is there another way in pv3 to save an animation, e.g. individual frames 
as .png images or similar?

If I had access to the render window in the programmable filter, I could 
maybe use a vtkWindowToImageFilter and a vtkPNGWriter. But as you 
recently explained these are not available. But it would be nice... :)


Thanks for any hints/help.

Cheers
Bryn

Hey Bryn,

In my 3.3 build (with VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER: OFF, OS X) after going  
to Save Animation, then entering the animation parameters info, the  
next dialog asking for the file name has a File Type combo box at the  
bottom which lets me pick PNG, JPEG or TIFF. This dumps a series of  
frames for the animation. I'm not sure whether the AVI option excludes  
the PNG frames, but at least I know that the individual frames as  
images is possible.

The ability to save png/jpeg/tiff animations is available on all the ParaView 3.2 builds as well.  You just have to choose a different filter in the file type combo box of the file chooser.

The crash is probably related to the offscreen rendering employed while writing animations.  The offscreen rendering is used to prevent the animation from capturing any windows on your desktop that might overlap your ParaView window.  Unfortunately, we've had trouble with some video drivers supporting the offscreen rendering extensions incorrectly.  If you are a little bit daring, you could try using the 3.3.0 snapshot available on the web, which has an option to turn off offscreen rendering for animations.  You could also try updating your video driver.

Hi Ken,

Thanks. The saving to png works fine.

The offscreen rendering also worked - without crashing my system!

Yup.  That's a bug.  I put it in the tracker.

Is OSMesa working with pvbatch in 3.2.1?  I thought we just fixed that.

If I am not mistaken, we just fixed an issue with
--use-offscreen-rendering not being recognized by pvbatch.

We generally plan to support backward compatibility automatically in 
ParaView. There are some known cases which are not handled such as those 
involving the old "multi-group" filters.

Can you share the state file for which you are having difficulty so that 
we can fix any other missed changes?

Hi Kent,

following your advice, I checked out the CVS version of ParaView,  
compiled, and now pvbatch works with OSMesa and without X server.  
Thanks!

Ken,

I think I did everything correctly with 3.2.1 and OSMesa, and it was  
crashing. However I didn't spend too much time with 3.2.1. Following  
Kent's suggestion, I just switched to the CVS version. This works as  
expected in offscreen mode.

Can anyone tell me how to get the animation to render both left and
right views for a stereo movie?

Subject: [Paraview] plugin for stereo animation rendering
Message-ID: <1e93c9c0805281453y62d261f4xac3c4fbb0cb46cea@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone worked with or heard of a plugin for paraview that enables
stereo movie (animation) rendering? I find it hard to believe that
paraview would be designed to render interactively in stereo mode but
then movie generation is only capable of mono mode. What files would I
begin to look in if I wanted to add this feature? Does it require
editing the paraview source or could I drop in a script without
recompiling?

Are you referring to passive stereo?

Hmmm. That file seems to be missing an include for stdlib.h. Can you
try adding it and see if that fixes it? I am still using 4.0 and 4.1.
I will give 4.3 a try.

Well in a way, yes. We have quad-buffered stereo setups (active and
passive) with nvidia quadro cards. Playing with our data in stereo is
easily done with ParaView using the -stereo command line argument.
However, our end goal is to play with the data and render an
animation/movie which consumes a fraction of what the full data
consumes and can be played on demand during demos or presentations. As
far as I can tell Paraview is missing support for stereo movie
rendering (side-by-side, over-under, interlaced and/or left/right
movie files).

I modified XdmfObject.h to include cstring and cstdlib as below, and all 
compiled nicely.

# ifdef UNIX
#  include "sys/file.h"
#  include "strings.h"
#  include <cstring>
#  include <cstdlib>
#  define STRCASECMP strcasecmp
#  define STRNCASECMP strncasecmp
#  define STRCMP strcmp
#  define STRNCMP strncmp
# endif

Hello all,

from my reader module I get the message below. Excellent message and am 
probably doing something wrong but how do I find out which routine in my 
reader is the culprit? gdb on the core just tells me that it is inside 
QEventLoop::exec.

"Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  basic_string::_S_create
"

Regards,

Mattijs

I get that a lot in ParaView when my code is doing an incorrect memory access (seg fault, bus error, etc.).  Try running ParaView in a debugger and see if it breaks on the real problem.

I have seen this before when I included a piece of code that actually
throw exceptions. It is tough to debug unfortunately since you don't
get the stack trace that points to the right place. If you have any
idea about the whereabouts of this issue, you could add an exception
handler to pinpoint the problem better.

When I asked the same question a couple of months ago Berk said that it was accidentally left out of 3.2.1 but would be in the next version. In the CVS version from a few weeks ago the File->Open dialog's choice of file types still does not include HDF5.

The best workaround seems to be to use the XDMF reader which requires that you create a simple XML file to describe the HDF5 file.

Message-ID: <d5c9d2de0805291029q3634e435t4c334d948b28c6f8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,
I have number of  files with each file contains  many points (x,y,z
coordinates) of a line/curve. I use python programmable source to visualize
those lines  (like the example given to generates a Helix curve in the
paraview Wiki.)
I use file=fopen("file1",'r') and extract the coordinates of each point from
the file  and visualize that line.. and it is working great.
now the problem is,  i have so many files (many lines) and i want to see all
the lines at once.
so i could use like

FILES=["file1.dat","file2.dat", ..... ]
for filename in FILES:
   file=open(filename,'r')

but i would like to know more elegant way than writing each filenames in an
array (difficult in the case when i have say 100 files)

any tips and tricks..?
thank you
Sreejith

You should look into the python os module

Something like this might work:

import os
FILE = "file.dat"

(filePath,fileName) = os.path.split(FILE)
(name,ext) = os.path.splitext(fileName)

allFiles = os.listdir(filePath)

for otherFile in allFiles:
    (otherName, otherExt) = os.split.splitext(otherFile)
    if (otherExt == ext):
       #load other file

Hey Berk,

I may have tracked down what is going on with the time series getting  
split according to index when you're trying to plot (extract) over  
time using Global IDs:

In vtkExtractArraysOverTime::vtkInternal::AddTimeStepInternal(),  
idsArray is being pulled from the data set using the name  
"vtkOriginalPointIds". These IDs are being used as a key for the  
extracted data (time series) blocks -- if the current key doesn't  
exist, then a new block is created (and the time series is split).

The problem is that vtkExtractSelectedIdsCopyPoints() fills the  
"vtkOriginalPointIds" array with indices, whether the  
vtkSelection::ContentType() is GLOBALIDS or not. (GlobalIDs are copied  
correctly along with the extracted data, but that's not what's put  
into the new array.) It's unclear to me from the description of  
vtkExtractSelectedIds whether this is the intended behavior...

So, I suspect that the desired fix would be to change something in  
vtkExtractArraysOverTime.cxx, like adding these four lines below line  
306 (but I don't know enough to figure out whether this would screw up  
anything else):

	if (this->ContentType == vtkSelection::GLOBALIDS)
		{
		idsArray = vtkIdTypeArray::SafeDownCast(inDSA->GetGlobalIds());
		}

Thanks, and let me know what you think,
-Eric

May I suggest the use of the python glob module.
I have just tried it inside a programmable source and it works fine.
Glob will look for all filenames following a pattern. You might also
want to sort them alphabetically after you have created the array
?
here is an example
?
import glob
?
files = glob.glob("file*.dat")? # creates the array you wanted
files.sort()???????????????????????? # sorts them
?
i = 0
while i < len(files):
????print files[i]
????i = i + 1
?

Thank you Robert and Jean.
Jean's idea indeed solved the file handling problem.
But now i found that the script is able to show only one curve at  a time,
i.e the last one in the file*.dat,  eventhough it reads all the files.
How do I solve the issue.? or is it that for each file I have to have
different programmable filter.
Here is the script I used.. It would be great if some one can help me in
this regard.

Subject: [Paraview] Is VTU File Reading Parallelized?
Message-ID: <483F1E7F.1030504@psc.edu>

In the update extent the "numberOfPieces" seems to always be zero except on process 0.

A vtu file can divide the data into several "pieces". Is that required for parallel reading?

TIA!

Any advice on how to proceed? Im not familiar with the source behind
the paraview interface, but is any of it based on Python/Tcl plugins?
What Id really like to do is add this as an option in the Animation
Settings Dialog (a little checkbox to say "Output Left/Right frames").
Can someone tell me where to find that source? I know it must be
possible to force the window to  render left and right views as
separate screenshots. That is really all that I need since I have
scripts to stitch image sequences into full movies.

Message-ID: <483FB3DE.2070202@powertech.no>

Hello all,

I mesh a cylinder and put points regularly first on the outer and then 
on the inner surface. Then I write a vts-file and ParaView renders this 
as two nice surfaces r=r_i and r=r_o.

How would I change the XML description to inform ParaView to interpret 
my input as a definition of a hexahedral mesh?

Also...Inside UpdateInformation, the number of pieces and piece number 
are not set, inside UpdateData they are. In my view this is wrong and 
they should be set in update information too, (but you can get the mpi 
rank directly from the glocal communicator). Berk et al, can you say why 
the piece info isn't set during the information pass?

This is not answering your actual question, but I wanted to air my 
thoughts anyway :)

It might relate to the fact that Paraview recognizes the client side plugin 
but not the server side one. If I go into Manage Plugins and try to load the 
server side one by hand it says that it "is not a valid Qt plugin".

This is all built with Qt 4.3.3, cmake 2.4 patch 6.

On other machines with slightly different OS versions it all works fine.

You have to take the creation of vtkPoints() outside the main loop
otherwise you will add the points for the last cell only. Also, you
should probably not call Allocate() inside the loop.

I am not by any means an expert on stereo but I don't think what you
are asking for is straightforward. You want to support active stereo
in a movie. This is not a matter of simply saving a set of images. You
would need a special player that is aware of the nvidia hardware. The
closest thing you can do with ParaView is to turn on geometry caching
so that after the first time you animation plays faster. Have you
saved/played stereo movies with other applications before?

Just to make sure I understand, you are saying that
UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() and UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER() are set during the
RequestUpdateExtent() pass (which is true) and you are asking asking
why they are not set during RequestInformation() pass. Correct? They
cannot be set during RequestInformation() because those are requests
propagated from consumer to producer whereas the RequestInformation()
is for producers to provide information to their consumers.
MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES() is set during RequestInformation(). I am
guessing your use case may be that you want to provide information
specific to a piece? We have done some work with LANL folks in this
area. In that work, the pipeline passes look like:

1. RequestInformation (producers provide _static_ information about
what is available)
2. RequestUpdateExtent (consumers tell the producers what they will be asking)
3. RequestUpdateExtentInformation (producers provide _dynamic_ (per
piece, per time etc.) information
     about what is available)
4. Repeat 2 and 3 as many times as necessary
5. RequestUpdateData (pipeline executes)

I am guessing ParaView is interpreting your data as a hexahedral
curvilinear mesh. It is only displaying the surface of this volumetric
mesh. Try slicing or clipping the data. You can also apply the
"Extract Edges" filter to extract a wirefreame representation of the
volumetric mesh.

I don't think Even is looking for any special interface to some stereo display system.  He is simply looking for a feature in save animation that will save images for the left and right eyes.  For example, each frame would be an image twice as long as the requested viewport with the left and right eye images side-by-side.  It would be up to some other program to properly take this information and display it with a stereo display.

Sure, I get that but what application and what format does it expect?
Is there a "standard" movie format for stereo?

Berk

I foud your question a little confusing, because of phrases like the 
following (probably my fault, becausee I wrote UpdateInformation, when I 
meant RequestInformation, my bad - as you americans say).
> cannot be set during RequestInformation() because those are requests
> propagated from consumer to producer whereas the RequestInformation()
> is for producers to provide information to their consumers.
When the comsumer request information about the data (e.g. file reader), 
it is frequently the case that the file must be opened on all processes, 
information extracted and passed back down the pipeline. In many cases, 
opening a huge file (on a shared NFS filesystem - yikes), querying the 
information about point/cell data, number of cells etc is not necessary 
for every node, when later on, node X will be told only to get piece N 
anyway.

NB. The paraview GUI ignores the information from all nodes other than 
process 0 anyway - so even sending it to the other nodes, seems pointless :)

What I was wondering, is why is UPDATE_PIECE and NUMBER_OF_PIECES not 
set in RequestInformation? I've struggled with this for years and never 
understood why it is (seemingly deliberately) not set. In most readers, 
the file is opened, scanned and information set during 
RequestInformation. I have on occasion, sent the information from node 0 
to the other nodes using mpi rather than have them open the file 
themselves. Often the information depends on the node number and so 
lacking this information is strange.

Do you get that error because you're trying to load the server plugin on the 
client side when ParaView is in client/server mode?

http://www.caf.dk/cafonly/gnu/gdb/gdb_31.html
Says you can set a breakpoint at __raise_exception to have gdb break before 
letting the catch in QEventLoop::exec handle it.

Well, we render movies with two different approaches in other
software. Amira renders side-by-side format PNGs, MPEG or AVI meaning
the left and right eyes are contained in the double wide viewport like
Ken mentioned. I recently wrote a plugin for VMD which renders the
left and right eyes as separate TGA snapshots and then coalesces all
the lefts into a left eye movie and all rights into a right eye movie
(left-/right-eye format) using imagemagick or mencoder. LLNLs VisIT
has internal support for rendering the left-/right-eye snapshots like
VMD, but it does not internally coalesce them. I wrote a few batch
scripts that use MEncoder (ffmpeg) to stitch the image sequences
together.

Either format is desirable, and in fact the left-/right-eye format
sometimes functions better because each eye is an independent movie
that can be distributed and played as if it was rendered in mono.
"standard" format is difficult to define, but Id vote for the
left/right. To view the stereo movies we use the Stereoscopic Player
from http://3dtv.at which supports side-by-side, interlaced,
over-under, left/right, etc.

Sreejith,

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list.

You can either create a custom filter that embeds your python script
(see the Tools menu) or you can write a python script to do this
automatically. See here:

OK, so we have two distinct use cases:

1. Get information to be displayed by the application
2. Get information that the downstream filters consume

You are right that for (1) we should not open the file on anything
that the first node. For (2), all nodes need some meta-information to
function. For example, if the reader produces structured data, all
nodes need WHOLE_EXTENT(). For imaging filters, they need the scalar
type, number of components etc. It is possible to write a parallel
reader such that it opens the file in the first RequestInformation()
on the first node, reads and caches all necessary information (so that
subsequent calls to RequestInformation() can return the cached
information and not open the file again) and also broadcasts it to the
other nodes. Such a reader would need the get the global controller to
do that. Be careful if you decide to make a change, it is very
important that your algorithm does not call any methods that causes
its MTime to change during or between any of the pipeline changes.
This may cause serious issues including deadlock due to asymmetric
execution among different processes.

The fact that ParaView, by default, sets UPDATE_PIECE to local process
id and NUMBER_OF_PIECES to number of processes does not mean it is
always so. When streaming, NUMBER_OF_PIECES is number of procs *
number of streaming passes. This is something I have struggled with as
well. My conclusion is that if you want to know the number processes
and your process id, get it from your controller (make sure to give
the user the option to get the controller in case we start using MPI
groups in the future). Do not assume that number of processes ==
number of pieces. Of course, parallel algorithms that need the whole
data (distributed) to function, will not be available when streaming
and they can assume that number of pieces == number of processes (for
example streamtracer).

I have been following this discussion and am trying to solve a related  
problem. I only have one file to deal with but would like the user to  
be able to specify the filename from a nice interface, similar to the  
Helix example. Ideally I would pop up a file browser but for now  
simply typing the path is sufficient. I have this working with an xml  
file that includes an element like:

<StringVectorProperty
   name="FileName"
   command="SetParameter"
   number_of_elements="2"
   default_values_delimiter=";"
   default_values="filename;r'/tmp/test.xyz'">
</StringVectorProperty>

Unfortunately, I need to include the quotes when entering a path in  
the ui, otherwise Python will throw an exception when it tries to do:

filename = /tmp/test.xyz

Is there a way to modify the ui so that it automatically returns a raw  
string containing whatever is entered in a text box?

Best,

What happens when you enter the filename between the quotes currently?
Are the quotes discarded? It sounds like we really need a type for the
parameters so that it automatically quotes string parameters.

I would like to see a programmable reader in the future. It would be
very cool if you somehow you specify a python script and register it
with the list of readers. The file name(s) would be passed to this
reader from the GUI. This would be pretty easy to do from the XML if
we create a new VTK class.

If I enter the filename with quotes everything works fine. I haven't  
dug into the source but based on the exception I think whatever is  
entered in the ui text box is assigned verbatim to the variable so:

'/tmp/test.xyz'

works but:

/tmp/test.xyz

raises an exception.

That's what I was wondering about if there was something like a  
type="String" attribute for the xml. I guess another option would be  
to just return all input as raw string's and let the script worry  
about doing conversions. The latter was the behavior I originally  
expected given the name of the element, StringVectorProperty.

That would be ideal and it doesn't seem like the required  
functionality would be all that different from the current programable  
source.

Message-ID: <e7ddbec60805311729q42e0c242l45340b063aa8b218@mail.gmail.com>

This is really frustrating as my debian machines all upgraded to QT
4.4 a few weeks ago so the ParaView builds are now broken. Even
editing the CMakeLists.txt files does not work.

Why is it that everytime Trolltech changes QT it seems to require a
major amount of work?

If it is not possible to keep up with the changes coming through from
TrollTech, is it possible to do what you used to do with the older
version of ParaView and have a special version of QT that is bundled
with it?

You say ParaView only works with a particular version of QT so why not
bundle it?

Sorry if I sound cranky - I am getting frustrated!

It is not easy to keep up with Trolltech guys, they keep busy :-) I
recommend downloading your own version of Qt, building it and
installing it somewhere out of the system path (I use /opt/qt-4.X.X).
We will start supporting Qt 4.4 after we release 3.4.
Also, it sounds like the problem you are running into is with CMake
parsing the output of qmake. Did you test with cvs CMake?
