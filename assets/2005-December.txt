Subject: [Paraview] compute unstructured grid normals
Message-ID: <1133434908.27647.42.camel@localhost>

Hello,


I would like to gain the normals of an unstructured surface grid for
further use in the Calculator array. 
The "Normals Generation" Filter is not active, as I suppose it is ment
to deal only with poligonal meshes (builds on vtkPolyDataNormals).

So, is there a way to "convert" an unstructured surface grid to a
polygonal mesh, or is there an other way I am not aware of.



Thanks, Simone

Hi,

I'm trying to build paraview-2.2.1 with the PathScale-2.3 compiler on
an Opteron SuSE-9.3 platform and
have hit a snag.  When trying to compile vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx I
get the following error

The first error appears to be syntax error which corresponds to an extern
statement in the source file.  Is this a genuine syntax error, or is my
compiler not parsing this correctly?  This compiled fine on the same
platform with gcc-4.0.1.  Any help appreciated!

Thanks,

Jason

have you tried "Extract Surface" from the Filter menu, i.e.
vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter?

Jason,

I'm guessing CMake did not find X11 correctly.  Under the advanced
options in ccmake, make sure all the fields starting with X11_ are
filled in correctly.

It's not quite the same. And even with that technique, there's no way  
to plot a log x axis, is there?

Lee,

I agree, the log axis would be nice, please enter a feature request,
send me the number and SNL will put it on our list.

Ken,

You are right.  I thought I'd checked that, but obviously not.  Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview XML problem
Message-ID: <D9A8D98DDC682044806D5B46AF5C11E2078B6E@ARLABML01.DS.ARL.ARMY.MIL>

All,
	I am using Paraview 2.5, CVS'd version, and am having trouble
with XML.  I have created a test filter which creates a disk source.
Everything seems to import correctly, no complaints from Paraview.
	The problem is Paraview doesn't change the radial resolution
based on changes made in the user interface.  

Below are the files I've created:

file "DiskSource.pvsm" :

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
    <SourceProxy name="DiskSource" class="vtkDiskSource">
      <DoubleVectorProperty
        name="InnerRadius"
        command="SetInnerRadius"
        number_of_elements="1"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="0.25">
        <DoubleRangeDomain name="range" min="0"/>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>
      <IntVectorProperty
        name="RadialResolution"
        command="SetRadialResolution"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="6">
        <IntRangeDomain name="range" min="2" max="512"/>
      </IntVectorProperty>
    </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>


file "DiskSource.xml" :

<ModuleInterface>
  <ServerManagerFile name="DiskSource.pvsm"/>
  <Module name="DiskSource" menu_name="MyDisk"
    root_name="MyDisk" module_type="Source"
    long_help="not here..." short_help="not here either..." >
    <Source class="vtkDiskSource"/>
    <ThumbWheel label="Inner Radius"
      trace_name="InnerRadius" property="InnerRadius"
      resolution="0.01" minimum_value="0" help="still nothing..." />
    <Scale label="Radial Resolution"
      trace_name="RadialResolution" property="RadialResolution"
      resolution="1" display_entry="1" display_value="0"

Hello,

Has anyone written a CGNS reader for paraview? I saw that this question
was asked a couple of years ago, but there was no follow up in the
archive. Any help?

Would be nice to have!

I 'hack' it by writing three fields with the x/y/z coordinates of the 
elements and using the threshold filter to cut away sections.

Thanks for a hint. Anyway, I plan to start adding my own filters to
paraview, so this might be a good excuse to finally start doing so.
Where do I start learning how to do it? The printed documentation is not
too attractive because it is not even available at the moment and it
also seems pretty old (version 1.8?). The mailing list archives miss  a
search option. Any other resources?
Thanks a lot

Maybe, searching with google helps a little bit:

Hello,
Does Paraview support OpenGL polygon offset extension? If I try to
visualize e.g. a tet mesh with edges (extract edges, shrink tets) the
result looks very bad. Does VTK offer it at all? Is it at all possible
using the VTK's filter philosophy?

Okay I know this is a not a 'solution' but for a quick fix set the line
width to '2' instead of '1'. It will look much better. :)

Thanks a lot, yes, still however it is far from what I used to get with 
my own small codes, but that might be an issue for VTK mailing list 
instead. Still, it looks a bit like a dead-end to me (where to put it?).

Oh yes indeed, I am talking about the first solution. Now is there a

Not really. It's more a GUI issue.

Just a FYI, but is it a common problem across platforms that "Alt-F, E" is
bound to both "Save Session Trace" & "Open Recent File" ?  It effectively
masks any keyboard shortcut for Open Recent file.

I will paraphrase my friend Berk: "it is just a GUI issue"

VTK already implements what you want in the vtkExtractGeometry. You only
have to make ParaView aware of it with the following XML. Just use
Import Package to load the XML file.

Once imported, you have a new Filter called "Extract Geometry". Check
the two buttons "Extract Boundary Cells" and "Extract Only Boundary
Cells" and you will have the plane, sphere and box clipping showing
whole cells.

I include the (xml and pvsm files) to import. Tested under Windows and
Linux for ParaView 2.4 and 2.5.

Subject: [Paraview] How to Debug ParaView
Message-ID: <1A4815BD12A4E46BAAA2C80C@harpo.psc.edu>

ParaView is crashing after the logo window has been displayed but before 
the main window is displayed. The logo window cannot be moved or hidden so 
its difficult to see the terminal window. Is there anyway to move this 
window?

The gdb command "generate-core-file" was used to dump things to a file but 
it cannot be used - upon loading, the following error is shown:

warning: svr4_current_sos: Can't read pathname for load map: Input/output 
error

Is there a way to dump ParaView that works?

Is there a way to turn on VTK debug messages? I set the type of generation 
to "DEBUG" in CMake but this doesn't turn on VTK debuging.

ParaView 2.4.1
Redhat Fedora Core 4
gcc Red Hat 4.0.1-5
gdb 6.3.0.0-1.21rh

Thanks!

Is this compiled with MPI? Which version?

You can disable the splash screen by editing (or creating) .ParaViewrc in
your directory and adding/changing this line:

ParaView2.5\RunTime\ShowSplashScreen = 0

This is answer to only a part of your problem.

One way to disable the "splash" screen is edit your
${HOME}/ParaViewrc file and changed the "ShowSplashScreen" option to 0.
Since the option is saved separately for each version of paraview, you
might want to just turn of all occurences of ShowSplashScreen.

That way, atleast you'll be able to see the terminal window.

Perfect!

This post was just about debugging. The real problem was described in 
"Problems Including Custom Class At Compile In 2.4.1" of 11/8 and 12/1.

Message-ID: <FLEDJMILPBJHJMINJMLBKEJLCDAA.thorsten.steinmetz@hsu-hamburg.de>

Hello,
I have a general question concerning the visualization of vector fields in
paraview. Is it possible to generate 2D or 3D visualizations of fields of
1-vectors (e.g. discrete differential one-forms, like a force or an electric
or magnetic field) by defining the integral value of the 1-vector along an
edge of the mesh (like the work which is done by a force acting along an
edge or like edge voltages of electric or magnetic fields)? Accordingly, is
this possible for 2-vector fields, too? Thanks a lot in advance for any
answer!

Yours,

Hello

I have an application (similar to the KWWidgets example) running well
with the ParaView 2.4.1.

Ijust tried to compile it with ParaView CVS. The compilation goes well.
On execution, grabbing the slider and moving it gives me the following
error:

ERROR: In /local/apps/ParaView/GUI/Widgets/vtkKWTkUtilities.cxx, line 217
vtkKWApplication (0x8107258):
    Script:
vtkTemp42 SetGroupRangeCallback 2 3
    Returned Error on line 1:
Object named: vtkTemp42, could not find requested method:
SetGroupRangeCallback
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

Using the command prompt, demonstrates in fact that there should be no
argument and that the application behaves as it does (as with ParaView
2.4.1)

"vtkTemp42 SetGroupRangeCallback" without argument is correct and
invokes the callback.

My code defines the following:

this->range->SetEndCommand(this, "SetGroupRangeCallback");

void Example::SetGroupRangeCallback()
{
  double range[2];
  this->range->GetRange(range);
}

I am aware that a lot has changed in the last few days with the
KWWidgets. Is this a new problem?

Thanks for any help

Yes, definitely:

   // The 'object' argument is the object that will have the method called on
   // it. The 'method' argument is the name of the method to be called and any
   // arguments in string form. If the object is NULL, the method is still
   // evaluated as a simple command.
   // The following parameters are also passed to the command:
   // - the current (sub-)range: double, double
   virtual void SetCommand(vtkObject *object, const char *method);
   virtual void SetStartCommand(vtkObject *object, const char *method);
   virtual void SetEndCommand(vtkObject *object, const char *method);
   virtual void SetEntriesCommand(vtkObject *object, const char *method);

The vtkKWRange widget, as well as a couple other core widgets like 
vtkKWScale, vtkKWCheckButton, etc. now pass their current value to 
the callbacks. This makes it much easier to connect/chain them to 
other parts, reduce some dependencies (the receiving callback does 
not have to know about the UI element itself, or access it), and is 
more consistent with some other UI toolkits.

Sorry for the inconvenience. We are setting up a mailing list for 
KWWidgets where I will hopefully be able to announce that kind of changes.

Thanks

Thanks. Your advice was great. It now works properly and I agree
entirely with the comments you made about chaining them, dependency, etc...

KWWidgets, what a great piece of code.

Subject: [Paraview] Integrating new volume renderer into VTK/Paraview
Message-ID: <4398795B.8040400@sci.utah.edu>

We are working on integrating the Hardware-Assisted Visibility Sorting 
(HAVS) volume renderer into VTK and ParaView.  We have a prototype 
version that performs at about twice the speed of  Projected Tetrahedra 
with about the same image quality as ZSweep, incorporated into 
ParaView.  (ZSweep has much better image quality than PT.)

We would like to know what steps we need to take to get this added to 
VTK and ParaView.

Our implementation is a new volume mapper 
vtkHAVSUnstructuredGridVolumeMapper that can be used in place of any of 
the other unstructured grid volume mappers.  The actual code consists of 
the mapper class along with several shader files which are written in 
ARB assembly and work with ATI and NVidia video cards.  The code also 
supports a new high quality, dynamic Level-of-Detail approach by passing 
in a desired frame rate...

For integration with VTK, we see the following issue: Our code requires 
the most recent OpenGL extension header files.  VTK currently uses 
headers that are slightly out of date.  The newest headers are always 
available at the SGI website 
(http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/).

We have integrated our code into ParaView.   For screenshots comparing 
PT with HAVS, see http://www.sci.utah.edu/~stevec/images.

For complete integration with ParaView, we see the following issues:
1.  We do not understand ParaView's LOD selection.  Thus, we have not 
incorporated our LOD technique inside ParaView.  We would appreciate 
getting help from someone that knows the details of how this works.
2.  Although our code works on both ATI and NVidia, ParaView does not 
seem to use hardware-acceleration on machines with ATI cards.  Even with 
the precompiled Windows binaries from the web, the PT algorithm is 
extremely slow, indicating that hardware rendering is not being used.  
Is this an intrinsic limitation of ParaView?

Any help or advice on getting this code into VTK and ParaView would be 
helpful.  Thanks

Steve Callahan and Claudio Silva

PS. We also have an efficient software volume renderer based on the same 
algorithm that we would like to incorporate in the near future.

Hi Steve,

Can you send me the code? (either point me to an ftp location or I can give 
you instructions for uploading files here) We'll look it over here, see 
what we may need to do on the OpenGL header issues (are you using the 
vtkOpenGLExtensionManager to manage the use of your extensions and get the 
function pointers?) It shouldn't be too hard to get this into VTK.

For ParaView, we are currently using a 2 level LOD method with Projected 
Tetras being the "fast" one always, and either no second level, or ZSweep 
or the ray caster for final rendering. This would probably be different in 
that we would replace PT whenever possible with this new method (as long as 
the required extensions were available). We can worry about this once the 
class is integrated into VTK.

Thanks,

Lisa

Hi Steven,

VTK uses the OpenGL extension header files installed on your machine and generate an header file with a vtkgl namespace
thanks to vtkOpenGLExtensionManager. At the end, you can use the extensions through the vtkgl namespace. For instance,
vtkgl::GetUniformLocation().

I'll take the action item to do this.

ParaView defines 2 levels of detail.  The low level of detail renders
fast for mouse interaction.  The high level of detail renders a full
resolution.

In the current implementation, a surface rendering is performed for low
levels of detail and a volume rendering (either PT or ZSweep depending
on user selection) is performed for high levels of detail.  Since HAVS
has built in LOD, we can change the behavior to use that mapper for both
levels of detail while toggling a parameter in the mapper.

No.  The PT mapper uses nothing that is not part of the OpenGL 1.1
standard.  The source for the PT mapper is in
ParaView/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper.cxx.  If you
have a chance, try commenting out pieces of code until the PT algorithm
performs as you expect.  Maybe the code is somehow touching some feature
not supported by the card and forcing it into software mode.

Yes, I am using the vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.  More specifically, my 
code works if you update VTK/Utilities/ParseOGLExt/header/*.h with the 
latest from the SGI website.  Thus, incorporating my code would also 
require that the three OpenGL headers in this directory are up to date.

I understand that PT is being used during interaction.  What I am really 
interested in is rendering datasets larger than a million tetrahedra.  
In this case, the LOD seems to go into a boundary only rendering.  
Instead, I would like to use my volume rendering class with the LOD 
turned on, which basically samples the geometry inside and provides a 
better LOD than what is currently being used (see "Interactive Rendering 
of Large Unstructured Grids Using Dynamic Level-of-Detail.", Vis 2005).

Thanks.

	The SGI has 16 processors so I want to start the server up using
10 processors - "mpirun -np 10 pvserver".  I'm not sure how to start the
client running on the same machine, what command line arguments do I
need?

Thanks in advance for any help,

Hi John,

You are only required to use the .pvx file if you are running 
ParaView in a CAVE or if you are running in client / data server / 
render server mode.  To start the client on the same machine as your 
pvserver, just open a new shell, and run the pvclient executable.  If 
it's all on the same machine, you shouldn't even need to specify the 
server host to the client.  So, you should do the following.

mpirun -np 10 pvserver
pvclient

Are there specific command-line options you're trying to use?  Do you 
have other specific questions about starting ParaView?

As you said, you start the server with
> mpirun -np 10 pvserver

To start the client that connects to the server on the same machine
simply use

> pvclient

It will connect to the server running on the defaulf port on the localhost.

Hi Adam,

The process is the same on Windows as it is on Linux.  What happens 
when you do 'mpirun -np 4 pvserver' on Windows?

Please keep the discussion on the list.

Is the mpirun executable in your path?  (For example, I'm using 
MPICH, and "C:/Program Files/MPICH/mpd/bin" is in my PATH environment variable.

Amy/All,
  When I start a Paraview client session, on the same machine running the server(mpirun -np 10 pvserver), and force compositing ( by moving the silder to 0 in the GUI ) multiple render windows appear on my desktop.  I'm not sure what I've missed?
 
Thanks very much for the help,

All,
   At present we have purchased all the documentation/manuals etc for Paraview and VTK.  It is my understanding that Paraview 2.5 and VTK have changed significantly since the Paraview and VTK Guides were published.
   I need to have a better understanding of how the current version of Paraview/VTK differ from the published documentation.  Is there "updated" documentation for both?  I'll do my homework if someone can help point me in the correct direction :)
 
Thanks very much for your time, it is greatly appreciated

Hi developers,

I noted in the recent release (2.4.1) that the "append dataset" is still
disabled after loading several pieces of model from Ensight case files. I
think it's still a bug, isn't it?

Hi Renato,

As Berk said when you mentioned this bug earlier, it's a known issue 
(a missing feature), but it probably won't make it into the 2.4 release.

Message-ID: <d3d4ab920512090652j268fa8aar481d7fa0d710fa65@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to create an additional option at "Display" dialog, to be
able to produce an animation with different range of ScalarBar at
different frames. Just a "reset range" at each frame would be enough
for now.

Can anyone give me some guidance how to do that simply and correctly?

I have already spend some time looking at the code, and I find out
that function vtkPVColorMap::ResetScalarRangeInternal can do the job.
But, the animation sequence is handled by some callback function at
the server part. I can hardly see the whole picture of the ParaView
architecture so, I do not want to do some "dirty" things at the code.

Thank you in advance for any response,
Milan

Are you wanting to run the ParaView server on linux and the ParaView 
client on Windows?  If so, then start pvserver on your linux box: 
'mpirun -np 4 pvserver'.  Then start the ParaView client on your 
Windows machine, and pass the name of your linux machine using the 
--server-host (-sh) command line argument: 'pvclient -sh=<server name>'.

The server opens up windows wherever you have your DISPLAY environment

Subject: [Paraview] Chromium and 'Unable to open display' in client-server
	mode
Message-ID: <200512122344.jBCNigC6022318@tingenek.stat.cmu.edu>


Hi folks;
  We have modified VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx so that, if the 
server process cannot access the DISPLAY environment variable, it attempts 
create an OpenGL context using the Chromium API.  This works very well, and 
we've had wonderful success running the server rendering processes across 
Chromium under ParaView up through (I believe) 2.0.1.
  In version 2.4.1 there is apparently some trap code which prevents this, 
however.  I know the code at line 448 of GUI/Client/vtkPVCompositeRenderModuleU
I.cxx (rev. 1.30) is getting called, and giving its associated error message 
'Unable to open display'.  The associated text says that this happens when one 
of the servers cannot get a valid DISPLAY environment variable.  Of course 
this message is getting displayed on the client side, and the source of the 
message is somewhere on the server side.
  The servers may not be able to open the DISPLAY, but they have a perfectly 
good graphics context.  Can someone direct me to the code where the server 
DISPLAY is tested so that I can disable it?  I believe I've covered all the 
uses of DISPLAY in vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow and I'm not sure where else to look.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] which VTK
Message-ID: <439EFB62.1020100@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hello,

I once have asked this question, but didint get an answer. I didnt 
conclude much from the Wiki pages either: what is the reason Paraview 
uses its own VTK version?

1) Which version is it (CVS?) and what/why modifications are made to it?

2) I use both VTK (from C/C++) and Paraview (stand-alone) and I see 
little sense in compiling VTK twice. If the Paraview's versions is 
newer, which one is it / what are the differences to the official 
version? If the official VTK version is OK to use to compile Paraview, 
how can I disable redundant compilation and reuse VTK available on my 
system?

thank you and regards,
Dominik

CVS ParaView uses CVS VTK. When ParaView is branched for a release, VTK is
also branched. We used to support using an external VTK but we had too many
complaints  that turned out to be mismatching versions of VTK and ParaView.
Because of this, we stopped supporting using an external VTK. You have to
change ParaView CMakeLists.txt files in order to allow for the use of an
external VTK and I don't think it's straightforward to do. I keep separate
builds of VTK and ParaView. If you are using VTK only from C++, you can use
the VTK built by ParaView instead of keeping a separate VTK.

So the conclusions would be to use Paraview's VTK for more recent if 
somewhat less stable version?

I see the problem in maintaining two versions. And I dont think I am 
going to change CMakeLists.txt to use an older external VTK version. But 
is it at least easilly possible to link paraview dynamically against the 
VTK? I get huge binary output files...

I assume you mean using shared instead of static libraries in 
ParaView. Yes, this is possible. When you run CMake, set 
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to ON.

The version of VTK distributed with Paraview 2.2.1 is VTK V4.5.0. The
class docs for this version are avaliable from (if no other place):

VTK V4.5.0 seems to be closer to V5.0 than it is to VTK V4.4.

Subject: [Paraview] Is the ZLibCompressor working?
Message-ID: <43A286BB.1090800@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi,
I have a structured legacy file which I load into paraview and save as 
structured pvs (xml) file. In the header of the output file there is a 
tag ZLibCompressor, but the file is only twice smaller than the legacy 
file. If I run gzip over the original input file, I get much more 
compression. I wrote myself a simple C++ converting program and the 
output is the same: ZLib mentioned in the header but very little (if 
any) compression - much less than by explicit use of gzip. What is 
happening?
regards,
Dominik

I am curious if anyone has seen communication problems in Paraview 2.5.0 client/server mode on Linux64.  I am visualizing CTH data and everything is fine until I try to change timesteps in the data.

Paraview error log:

There was a VTK Error in file: /share/jvines/Ice/build/src/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx (62)

This might mean that your server crashed. Can you verify this? How can we
reproduce it here?

Hi,
Paraview seems ignoring custom LOOKUP_TABLE's in my legacy input files. 
Do I miss something obvious on that issue (other than explained in

Hi,
We are a new Group of Paraview users; we have decided to 
use this program to visualize the results of our 
simulations (we work at "Dipartimento di Meccanica ed 
Aeronautica, La Sapienza", Rome). We have a problem to 
visualize a 1D curves. The question is: can Paraview 
visualize curves without a fixed "a priori" number of 
points? Is possible to visualize a curve without give in 
the header of vtk's files the number of points? a simple 
file ASCII in which there is two variabile listed as:
0.288 0.232
0.343 0.343
0.434 0.566
....   .....
could be imported (without header's specifications)?
Thanks for every suggests.

if it is a set of segments and not actually a real curve (spline) you
can create a simple legacy ASCII vtk file - use unstructured grid (cells
will be segments). see

Hi,

To the best of my knowledge, it's not possible to save PNGs without
background with ParaView. However, you can open the PNG with some
application like gimp/irfanview and save pngs with transparent color set
to the background (I know, it's painful).

It's been a while since I worked on IRIX, but at the time we  
frequently encountered your error when working with long  
commandlines, as are created by many build systems. The solution was  
to rebuild the kernel to allow a longer maximum commandline length.  
Sorry I can't remember the name of the kernel parameter.

Berk,

I've cut and pasted the error I receive from Paraview, yes the server seems to have crashed.  FYI, we are using MPICH 1.2.6.  I am looking into how it was built.

Subject: [Paraview] mpirun pvserver: bad X server connection.
Message-ID: <452F37AE49199D49B1702D7D45038C4D3EE474@et.ad.sdsc.edu>

I installed Paraview 2.2.1 with OSMesa 5.0.2 and MPICH 1.2.5.2 on RedHat
Linux.

I am trying to run pvserver in parallel using MPI.

 

Here is the shell script I use to run pvserver:

#!/bin/sh

export DISPLAY=0.0

$(MPI_HOME)/bin/mpirun -v -machinefile machines.

txt -np 2 $(PARAVIEW_HOME)/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

 

machines.txt - is a text file listing two machines.

 

Here is the error log:

Listen on port: 11111

Waiting for client...

connected to port 11111

Client connected.

Process id: 1 >> ERROR: In
/projects/vis/users/decastro/paraview-mpi2/paraview-2.2.1/VTK/Rendering/
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 326

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0xb7825c0): bad X server connection.

  

Process id: 1 >> ERROR: In
/projects/vis/users/decastro/paraview-mpi2/paraview-2.2.1/VTK/Rendering/
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 169

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0xb7825c0): bad X server connection.

 

On both machines, I logged into the console and set the environment
variable: setenv DISPLAY :0.0

Everything works fine if I use -np 1 instead of -np 2.

It is possible that security restrictions on our Linux system prevent
the two pvserver processes from communicating using X server. I cannot
run "xhost +" on our Linux system, due to our security restrictions.
Could that be related to the problem?

 

For example, if I use rsh to start xclock, I get the following error:

% rsh machine xclock

Error: Can't open display.

 

Thanks for any help,

Alex

Hi Dominik,
thank you very much, but we have a different problem; we 
just use Paraview to visualize our 2D simulations adopting 
the vtk ASCII legacy format... we look for a completly 
open source replacement for TecPlot: Tecplot recognize a 
simple ascii file like this
.1 .02 .65
.2 .50 .65
.6 .89 .44
.. ... ...
.. ... ...
.. ... ...
Tecplot read this file and recognize 3 variables giving 
them the names "V1", "V2" and "V3".
We have the necessity to read a file like this without 
header because we don't know "a priori" the number of 
points that constituite the curve. The vtk formats (all 
that we know) need an header where is specificated the 
numbers of points. Paraview can read a file like this 
(without header's specifications) in somewhat format?
Thank you  very much.

P.S. I am sorry for my very bad english...

Hi,
if you have a concrete file on disk then you can write a simple 
conversion tool counting the lines etc. inferring the required header 
info - and dumping an ascii legacy file. I dont see your problem. the 
easiest would be matlab script (study load command) in C/C++ study 
iostream's.
Dominik

as long as you have a file with coordinates

You probably have to set DISPLAY to :0 in your .XXXrc (.bashrc, .cshrc,
.kshrc, .zshenv) so that it is set during a non-interactive remote session.
In the next version of ParaView (2.6), it will be possible to set the
display in a configuration file.

Message-ID: <web-130954112@infinito.it>

Hi,
we have a trivial question: paraview supports the "DATASET 
FIELD"? it seems to support "all" vtk formats but with 
this simple ASCII file we have obtained a program crash...

Example 1

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Tec Conversion Prova
ASCII
FIELD ZoneType 5
Zona1 1 3 float
0.1 130000 350
Zona2 1 3 float
0.2 135000.0 370
Zona3 1 3 float
0.3 140000 380
Zona4 1 3 float
0.4 145000 470
Zona5 1 3 float
0.4 150000 570

We also try this (with "DATASET" keyword explicitated...)
Example 2

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Tec Conversion Prova
ASCII
DATASET FIELD ZoneType 5
Zona1 1 3 float
0.1 130000 350
Zona2 1 3 float
0.2 135000.0 370
Zona3 1 3 float
0.3 140000 380
Zona4 1 3 float
0.4 145000 470
Zona5 1 3 float
0.4 150000 570

These examples are made following the "financial.vtk" 
example from "vtk formats.pdf" file.
Thanks

Message-ID: <615EE420852DB51156AFDA44@harpo.psc.edu>

The guide to adding a module to ParaView at

   http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend

is invaluable and I have used it to add a new reader as an "external 
module". I'd be interested in comments on 2 problems I encountered.

1) The Wiki's xml for the GUI includes the line

   <ServerManagerFile name="vtkCellDerivatives.pvsm" />

This didn't work for me until I added the attribute "directory". Changing
"name" to be the full path didn't work. Should "directory" always be added?

2) "The ParaView Guide" (2004), p.193, says "Proxy groups ... are only used
for organizational purposes; it is perfectly valid to store all proxy
descriptions in one group." I arbitrarily used group "filters" in the xml 
for the server manager and ParaView could not find my reader - it had to be 
changed to "sources". Is that line in the book wrong?

I think as long as the .xml and the .pvsm files are in the same directory,
it should work fine with the directory attribute.

2) "The ParaView Guide" (2004), p.193, says "Proxy groups ... are only used

It is not wrong. The part describes the server manager in general. As far as
the server manager is concerned, proxies can be stored in any group.
However, ParaView does assume that all sources will be in sources, filters
in filters, readers in readers etc.

Message-ID: <452F37AE49199D49B1702D7D45038C4D3EE4FE@et.ad.sdsc.edu>

Thank you for the suggestion. I "setenv DISPLAY :0" in the .cshrc file.

Now, pvserver works when I am logged onto the console on both machines.

 

Is there a way to get pvserver to work without logging onto the console
for each machine?

 

Specifically, is there a way to:

 

1. Compile Paraview so that pvserver does not have any X server
dependency?

     I compiled Paraview with off-screen Mesa.

 

OR

 

2. Configure X server to allow windows to be opened by folks not on the
console?

     Security restrictions on our systems prevent me from using "xhost
+".

You probably have to set DISPLAY to :0 in your .XXXrc (.bashrc, .cshrc,
.kshrc, .zshenv) so that it is set during a non-interactive remote
session. In the next version of ParaView (2.6), it will be possible to
set the display in a configuration file.

I installed Paraview 2.2.1 with OSMesa 5.0.2 and MPICH 1.2.5.2 on RedHat

On both machines, I logged into the console and set the environment

Everything works fine if I use -np 1 instead of -np 2.

It is possible that security restrictions on our Linux system prevent
the two pvserver processes from communicating using X server. I cannot
run "xhost +" on our Linux system, due to our security restrictions.
Could that be related to the problem?

 

For example, if I use rsh to start xclock, I get the following error:

% rsh machine xclock

Error: Can't open display.

 

Thanks for any help,

Message-ID: <715ADCF98083ECFC08FD656F@harpo.psc.edu>

We've accumulated a short list of readers and filters that we add to each 
new release of PV. It would be helpful to have an automatic scheme for 
compiling that picks up our local changes. I'd like to use such a scheme at 
our center and make it available to our users running PV on their own 
workstations.

For each addon I've built a "kit" that is self contained - it includes the 
source, the xml for the GUI and server manager, an init file for CMake, and 
a one-line command that runs CM to include the pieces. This works fine.

Combining several "kits" will require a small amount of extra work. For 
example, the several init files for CMake must be merged.

I'd appreciate any hints, comments or examples of how its done at other 
sites. If it seems like this would be generally useful I could add a 
summary and an example to the Wiki pages.

The vtkImageReader2 has methods that do this.

Only volume rendering of unstructured data is supported in ParaView. 
Run the Tetrahedralize filter on your volume (within ParaView), and 
then you should be able to volume render it.

Just a follow up.

ParaView has a raw binary reader that works great. So you may not need
to do any conversions.

Also ParaView will have structured data volume rendering support in
ParaView 2.6. :)

I fixed this bug. The fix will be in the next patch of 2.6. You can
also get 2.6 from cvs and build.

Is it already in CVS?
BTW one of our students implemented volumetric visualization for 
cartesian grids using gfx hardware. Looks nice... on his computer 
(crashes mine). Let me know if you want to have it.

Amy et al;

I do not know if this is a PV limitation or a WinXP-64 (rc2) limitation.
I am bring it to your attention in case you have some insight into what
may be happening or on the off chance you think it may be a PV issue.

I have a 400K tetrahedral mesh. I have 101 time steps. The data is
stored in an EnSight Gold binary format. PV reads the data just fine
and I can look at point and cell data at any time step. I can load in
additional objects stored in ExodusII-formats.  The calculator, clipping
and 3D contour filters work just fine.

However, when I invoke an animation all goes well until the construction
of the cached per-time-step images reaches the 2GB RAM mark at
which time WinXP has a problem. WinXP seems to think this is an issue
for which it wants to send an error-report to MS. I have let WinXP64 send
its error messages home. (But, I don't expect a personal reply from MS.)

I am asking PV to animate a cell variable.

If it is of any value to you, I can run tests for you on this condition. I
can
also move the data to the Suse Linux 9.3 AMD64 side and see what
happens when I make the same request of the Linux version of PV.
