Subject: [Paraview] PolyData bug??
Message-ID: <279D64F2-FBB0-4BAC-B4C1-6CA841F21A7B@gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I was playing to see if I could write a complicated shape with  
PolyData, and I found out that the visualization is really bad. The  
surface and surface with edges visualizations don't look quite right.  
I attached a wireframe and the surface with edges plots so you can  
take a look. Some time back I got the same problem when I tried to  
draw a polygon using OpenGL. I was able to solve the problem by using  
tesselation, so I believe the same is happening here. I also attached  
the vtp file. I'm on Mac OS, but I don't think that would make any  
difference.

Cheers,

Alejandro Arag?n

Nice feature - I didn't realise paraview could do that :)

It would be nice to be able to change the number of output ports depending
on the input but when I tried it crashed.  Is this a bug or is it required
for the number of outputs to be set in the constructor?

Regards,
Paul

I don't think this is a bug.  OpenGL (and every other rendering system that I am aware of) assumes that its polygons are convex.  You will have to tessellate your polygons into convex pieces in order for them to be rendered correctly.

So far I have not been able to replicate this.  I have used both ParaView 3.2.1 and ParaView CVS with the Wavelet source.  Can you tell us more about your data?  Can you send an example?

That's an artifact of the filters being written by different developers and different times.  When yours truly originally wrote the unstructured gradient filter (outside of the VTK/ParaView repository), I broke convention because I needed both the original scalars and the gradients in the output.  I suspect the structured gradient filters don't follow a similar convention simply because they were written back when filters usually worked on "active" scalars rather than named scalars.

Because I'm conceited, I submitted a feature request to have the naming convention of the image gradient filters to follow the convention of the unstructured gradient filter.

I strongly disagree. The user shouldn't be aware of such a thing. If  
Paraview gives you the option of drawing a polygon, it should be  
independent on its convexity. What it should do, is to check if the  
polygon is convex to use the regular GL function, and if not use  
tessellation to draw it. I have done this myself in the past, so I  
don't think it's a big deal.

I understand your sentiments, but the solution is not practical.  If ParaView were primarily used for modeling, which deals with fewer, more complicated elements, then I would totally agree with you.  However, scientific visualization typically deals with data comprising many simple elements.

Checking for convexity is an expensive operation on data that is already tessellated.  This is a problem when using ParaView for large data visualization, which is on of the major things it was designed for.

If it is an expensive operation, it could be done only once when  
reading the input file and save the result as a flag for subsequent  
rendering. Again, I don't think it's a big deal and it prevents  
completely from doing scientific visualization if someone uses non- 
convex polygons. Imagine for some reason that I do CFD with non-convex  
finite volumes. How in the world am I going to see the elements????

The ParaView Guide contains some good information about both using and modifying ParaView.  If you plan to use or edit visualization components, you will probably also want The VTK User's Guide and The Visualization Toolkit textbook.  The ParaView Wiki, http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView, also has lots of good information.

I get the feeling you may be overextending yourself.  You may want to start with a simpler task than developing a whole new visualization system.  You may want to consider using Plugins or Python scripting, at least initially.  The ParaView Wiki has information on both.

Hi everyone,
    I have some questions about Paraview.
    I am trying to develop a visualization system with VTK, which will use the mechanism of Paraview. So I want to know where I should start and may the book of The Paraview Guide will help. I have downloaded the Paraview Source - ParaView3.2.1, but I don not know how to use it. Should I read all the code or part of it? If I want to develop the similar software with Paraview ,which part is the most important?
    I am a novice about Visualization and Paraview , I am looking for your help.
    Thanks so much!
                                                                                                                         seven

Sure. Please download this sample dataset from
http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/imagedata.tgz (54KB). The package includes 3
binary vti files, 1 legacy ascii vtk file, a time series pvd file and
2 text files of stack dump after crash. The image data consists of
several 10^3 point data scalars.

There are multiple ways to replicate the problem:

Case1 - Open file iter0.vti; add Gradient Magnitude filter; Apply {pv
shouldn't crash yet, but there is no meaningful output}; Delete
Gradient Mag. filter; Delete iter0.vti {pv crashes with stack dump in
error1.txt}

Case2 - Open file steps.pvd; Play time steps; Add Gradient Filter;
Apply {pv crashes with stack dump in error2.txt}

Case3 - I can not replicate this consistently. But, with Case1 after
Apply step, I sometimes get

ERROR: In /home/levent/pkg/ParaView3.2.1/VTK/Imaging/vtkImageGradientMagnitude.cxx,
line 255
vtkImageGradientMagnitude (0x1afff70): Execute: input data type, 11,
must match out ScalarType 10

on the output window. Following this is identical to Case1.

In Windows version, Case1 hangs paraview (busy wait), Case2 crashes
with Qt error in my previous post. No stack dumps.

Is there any way to programatically change the "Map Scalars" value  
and the "Color By" drop down menu when a filter runs? I am storing  
the rgb values as cell attributes in my data set and to show the  
correct colors I _always_ have to select the proper attribute from  
the "Color By" drop down menu and then uncheck "Map Scalars". The  
scalars are stored as 3xUChar (RGB) in the attributes.

Are you setting them as the active scalars in your filter?

I can confirm that your program seems to produce reasonable output in
VTK format but ParaView from CVS can not read the output in MHD format.

It looks to me like this program is just the ITK ThinPlateSplineWarp.cxx
example adapted for 2 dimensions, is that correct?

I'm not much of an expert on hardware performance, but I think you'll get more mileage out of having two graphics boards per node.  That's how one of our clusters is set up (2 GPU's, 4 CPU cores per node), and it works OK.  Our graphics cards are set up so that each uses a different xhost.  It's a little tricky setting up your MPI job to launch ParaView to use different displays on different nodes, but once you get that set up it works fine.

I also sometimes run 4 process per node, having 2 processes sharing each GPU (you need to turn on offscreen rendering for that).  It slows down the rendering, but I prefer this mode because rendering is rarely the bottleneck anymore (at least when visualizing surfaces).  A bigger issue is that I sometimes see artifacts in this mode.  It appears to be a problem with the driver that I have never been able to track down.  For that reason, we turned that feature off for our production vis.

It is now. I was setting the activeVectors.

That takes care of the "Color By" drop down but the "Map Scalars" is  
still checked. So either I am misunderstanding what is meant by "Map  
Scalars" or I really _do_ need it unchecked. With it "Checked" the  
colors do NOT match. With it "Unchecked" the colors that the user  
selects for their data does match what is displayed.

Thanks so far for the help.

With it checked your data will pass through the color lookup table, what is called "mapping", hence the name. If the data is a vector its magnitude will be used. Only if your data is a vector of 3 unsigned bytes can the button be unchecked; then, the data is used directly as the color.

I often use a 2D elevation map derived from USGS data where the color at each point is stored as 3 unsigned bytes. Unchecking "Map Scalars" is required to see the desired colors.

Great. That is what I was understanding from the "VTK Book". Now, is  
there any way in PV 3 CVS to uncheck that box when my filter is run?

What you propose is adding the tesselation to the reader, which doesn't 
make much sense design-wise (it would have to be added to every reader). 
  It sounds like what is needed is a filter.  If you know you're working 
with potentially non-convex polygons, simply apply the filter after the 
reader.

That said, wouldn't the Tesselate filter work, or am I missing something?

I am trying to build paraview with python support, but also with no shared

Is there any way to work around this?

I'm building on AIX 5.3 if it's of any interest.

Message-ID: <89998d610804020243l56f1dbd2wb813fc50acc2c17b@mail.gmail.com>

hello , everyone,
Does anyone know how to change the .txt file into .vtk file(or other files
whose pixel type is a vector). Now I have a text file, in which are the
point coordinates and its new position(so we know its diplacement), and i
want to change this txt file into and image file .Because I want to do the
Linear interpolation of the displacement,but it need a image file as input.

Thanks for your advice!

Dear paraview users,

Subject: [Paraview] Build .app bundle on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <CFE1A536-779B-4C53-ABE9-8CA282D5FA1D@gmail.com>

Hi all

I have trouble building a Mac OS X app bundle of ParaView CVS.

I can't seem to find any way to get CMake/CPack to include the Qt and  
Python frameworks in the .app bundle. However, I do not want to  
require that my users install a full Qt. When I download the current  
ParaView beta .dmg (3.2.0) and look inside paraview.app, the  
frameworks are included, so there must be a way to achieve this (and I  
hope it is not doing it manually and fixing all dependencies up with  
install_name_tool, that would be a pain!).

I'd welcome any pointers in the right direction.

Regards

Michael

BTW: I'm using CMake CVS.

If you do a "make install" the .app bundle should be built and  
include Qt and Python properly. There is some ongoing work to make  
this smoother but it should work with the current cvs, although I  
have not tried recently.


David Cole and myself were working on some new scripts but I don't  
think the scripts are ready for "prime time" yet. They do work on my  
particular setup, which is OS X 10.4.11 with Qt 4.3.4 as Frameworks.  
Python should be included on each OS X installation and there is some  
concern about including it in the app bundle that we have not worked  
out yet.

David can chime in with some more info..

Hi,

I just noticed today's CVS head fails to compile on VS2008 at line 540
of Servers/Common/vtkPVXMLElement.cxx:

      snprintf(temp, 20, "&#x%x;", static_cast<int>(*escape_char));

with error C3861: 'snprintf': identifier not found.

Cheers,

Port 80 is probably already taken by another application.  In general, port 80 is a really bad choice because that is the port that world wide web applications typically use.  If I remember correctly, you should generally avoid using any port with a number of 1024 or less, as these are generally reserved for standard Unix daemons.

In short, choose a different port.

No.  Its that snprintf is not part of the POSIX standard, and none of the Microsoft compilers contain an implementation.

Utkarsh, I'll leave it to you to fix this.

I've committed a fix for that. Try updating 
Servers/Common/vtkPVXMLElement.cxx and it should build fine.

Subject: [Paraview] Time-varying rectilinear data set
Message-ID: <008b01c894c8$c2668d90$da3fd781@epcc.ed.ac.uk>

I've got a set of image data files (binary files of x*y*z floats) called
32x32x32_0.raw, 32x32x32_1.raw, 32x32x32_2.raw etc. where the _T.raw is the
timestep from my simulation.

I want to view these in paraview and make an animation cycling through the
timesteps.

I've tried loading these with the RAW (ImageData) loader and specified a
prefix of 32x32x32 and a pattern of %s_%d.raw but I can only see the first
timestep, and it does not change when I increment the time.

How should I go about creating this animation?

Thanks

- Iain

Thanks, this worked, at least partially. I do get the .app with the  
frameworks included, but unfortunately, the install_name's of the  
libraries in the MacOS directory are the ones in the build tree, and  
not something like @executable_path/libxxx.dylib. I fixed this with:

cd paraview-3.3.0/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS
for l in *.dylib paraview; do for f in $(otool -L $l | grep  
"something_matching_your_build_dir" | awk '{print $1}'); do  
ff=@executable_path/$(basename $f); install_name_tool -change $f $ff  
$l; done; done

I am working on this again this week...... I expect that in the near future,
creating the standalone bundle for ParaView will be part of make install and
should work on any Mac.

Thanks for your work!

Just for the records:
- - In addition to that I also had to change the references to all Qt  
libraries (also for the libraries itself). Funny thing is, the I  
didn't have to fiddle with the install_names themselves, as they were  
changed. Just the references were off.
- - Further was the QtSQL.framework missing. I had to add that one  
myself, and there change the references and the install_name with the  
install_name_tool.

This is a bit off topic, but another issue I ran across: When I try to  
build with CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT set to /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk  
under OS X 10.5, things didn't work out of the box:
- - CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/ 
MacOSX10.4u.sdk -Wl,-macosx_version_min,10.4
- - CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/ 
MacOSX10.4u.sdk -Wl,-macosx_version_min,10.4
- - CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/ 
MacOSX10.4u.sdk -Wl,-macosx_version_min,10.4
- - CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-mmacosx-version-min=10.4
- - CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-mmacosx-version-min=10.4

Levent,

I think I tracked down the problem.  It appears that the Gradient and Gradient Magnitude filters pay no attention to the Select Input Scalars parameter.  I'm dumfounded about why no one else has run into this problem.  I don't want to get into details about the issues, but you can read about them on the bug tracker.

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6706

Right now, the workarounds are kind of crummy.  Since the image gradient filters work on the active scalars, you can get around the problem by setting some active scalars in your file.  For example, if you wanted to take the gradient of the RT array in iter0.vti, you could achieve this by changing the Scalars parameter of the PointData tag to be RT:

  <PointData Scalars="RT">

Unfortunately, that means you need to change the file every time you want to change the variable you want to perform the gradient on.  You could also create a separate file for each variable, but I don't know if that is more cumbersome for you.

Another approach that would work OK if your data sizes are small enough is to convert the data to unstructured grids (via Clean to Grid) and run the unstructured gradient filter.  You could get the results back to the image data by using the Append Attributes filter.

I am afraid not. Python support requires shared libraries.

Thanks! After updating I find that everything now works, almost. I'm using

   pvbatch
   ParaView CVS
   Qt 4.3.4
   MPI version mvapich2-1.0
   Mesa 7.0.1
   CentOS 5

Of the 2 nodes one has access to an X server and the default window (300x300) was displayed. The other node has no X server and so it seemed to be the one that crashed.

Why is pvbatch trying to display windows? Is this controled by some cmake option?

Try setting the remote render threshold to MAX as follows:

from paraview import vtkConstants
view.RemoteRenderThreshold = vtkConstants.VTK_DOUBLE_MAX

The tessellation filter does not work either, at least on the version  
for Mac.

Subject: [Paraview] camera commands hang in python script
Message-ID: <009501c89567$ffc6fc20$da3fd781@epcc.ed.ac.uk>

I've got a python script when runs OK, but hangs whenever I do any camera
manipulation commands e.g. camera.Roll(x) or camera.Elevation(x).  I'm
running PV 3.2.1 (downloaded binary) on Windows.  Any ideas what I'm doing
wrong?

The script is:

import time

# Setup

if servermanager.ActiveConnection :
	connection = servermanager.ActiveConnection
else:
	connection = servermanager.Connect()

# Get ready to read a file

reader = servermanager.sources.ImageReader()
reader.FilePrefix = "Z:\\hpcx\\tera\\visualisation\\test_data\\32x32x32"
reader.DataExtent = [0, 31, 0, 31, 0, 31]
reader.DataScalarType = 10

# Read the file

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(reader, view)

# Set up how to draw the data

ai =
reader.GetDataInformation().GetPointDataInformation().GetArrayInformation(0)
lt = servermanager.rendering.PVLookupTable()
rep.LookupTable = lt
rep.ColorAttributeType = 0
rep.ColorArrayName = "ImageFile"
lt.RGBPoints = [ai.GetComponentRange(0)[0], 0, 0, 1,
ai.GetComponentRange(0)[1], 1, 0, 0]
lt.ColorSpace = 1

# Draw

print "Setup, now rendering..."
print time.clock()



view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()
camera = view.GetActiveCamera()
camera.Elevation(45.0)   <--- HANGS HERE
view.StillRender()

print time.clock()

print"Finished rendering"

# Save the file

view.WriteImage("Z:\\hpcx\\tera\\visualisation\\testimg.png",
"vtkPNGWriter", 1)

print time.clock()
print "Finished saving file"

Cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview client. Passing a variable from the program
	that is used to start the server back to Paraview client.
Message-ID: <e58876f00804030159k703d3eadj456377db05ca8d42@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a Paraview client on Windows and a Paraview server program on
some other Linux machine. Both versions 3.2.1. I have written a small
windows program that starts remotely the Paraview server on Linux. The
program returns the port number the server was stared on (because many
people will use that system, the ports must be generated each time a
server starts). I would like to use that program as a command in
Paraview client server manager window. But I dont know how a program
can give back the port value it found to the Paraview client. From the
webpage http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Server_Configuration I know how
Paraview client can give a variable TO the program (by using the
<Option> tag). But how can it be done the other way ? How can I tell
Paraview to take some variable from the executed program ?

Thank you for any help,

Thomas

Message-ID: <69E82C655BA624438EC192FB2D5B54DBC2FBAA@GLKMS2100.GREENLNK.NET>


Hi,
 
I've installed dri-mesa and tried with that. Now (under the same
conditions) the program doesn't crash the computer but instead just
crashes paraview.
 
When paraview starts i get the message...
   Failed to initialize TTM buffer manager.  Falling back to classic.
   Executing with: 0
 
Then when it crashes it outputs...
   paraview: brw_vtbl.c:98: brw_new_batch: Assertion
`!brw->no_batch_wrap' failed.
   Aborted
 
Anyone got any ideas?
 
On a second issue does anyone know how to get paraview to display just
the edges of an nfaced cell? For example if you have a cell that is
mostly a cube but that has to be nfaced because of a small part of it.
If you look one of the square faces it will look like it's made of 2 or
3 triangles (i assume because that is how paraview deals with nsided
faces). Is there any way to get it to display the origonal face (i.e. a
square) instead?

You are still using hardware acceleration with dri-mesa. I wanted to
figure out if this works with software mesa to make sure that it is
not some sort of driver problem (which I suspect it is).

Subject: [Paraview] vtkDataSetReader missing?
Message-ID: <497fe5210804030652y18721642vcc4e6972e1ea9677@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I was given a code example that makes use of vtkDataSetReader to open and
read a .vtk file.
When I try to run the code example it errors out saying that the vtk module
does not include a vtkDataSetReader.
The import at the beginning of the python is:

    from paraview import vtk

and the reader is referenced as:

    reader = vtk.vtkDataSetReader()

It has been suggested that I may have to replace use of vtkDataSetReader
with paraview.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader.

Question:
Should I make this replacement or is vtkDataSetReader missing from
paraview.vtk?

We are using the latest developent HEAD of paraview as downloaded approx.
two days ago.

Thank You,

Chris Cameron

Hi,

Stand alone mesa works fine. Doesn't cause the crash! Thanks.
Must be something to do with the intel graphics card or the drivers like
you said.

Now I've just got to work out the thing about just showing the edges of
an nfaced cell.

Message-ID: <47F4FA3F.9040100@nacad.ufrj.br>

Hi everybody,

I've just compiled PV3 from CVS's head with Python support 
(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON) and after the compilation has completed and 
installed and tried to run the "Helix curve" example published in the 
ParaView's wiki (http://paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter). 
When I hit the apply button I get the following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
File "<string>", line 14, in RequestData
NameError: global name 'paraview' is not defined

What am I doing wrong?

Compilation details:
-- Visual Studio 2005
-- Windows Vista Business 32 bits
-- CMake 2.4-7
-- Python 2.5
-- Qt 4.3.4
-- PV-3 (CVS Head)

Regards

Renato.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug 0006714: pvbatch requires X server
Message-ID: <47F4FCD2.2050807@psc.edu>

pvbatch cannot be run on a node unless that node has an X server. This makes it impossible to run a batch job on 99.99% of the parallel systems because most nodes don't have an X server.

The CVS version updated around 4/1/2008 12:10pm was used. It was linked to Mesa 7.0.1 and all of the GL-releated items point to Mesa. Also the "use offscreen rendering" option was set. The CMakeCache.txt file has been uploaded.

A Python program run by pvbatch works fine on one node, the one on which I have logged in to the parallel system, because it has access to an X server. However, the program crashes when using more than one node because the others don't have an X server.

P.S. I hope I am wrong and that I have merely done something stupid. Please let me know if there is a way to make this work.

try moving the pref files for ParaView aside then relaunching  
ParaView. There are also some config files in your home directory  
under the .ParaView* and .config. Try moving those aside also and see  
what happens.

Can't help you there. ParaView does not support polyhedra well. I
believe they come in a convex point sets. I don't know what works and
what doesn't for those.

That example seems to be out of date. Replace paraview with vtk in all
instances of paraview.<something>.

Have you linked to the OSMesa library?  Once you do that, you should no longer need an X server.  See the Wiki.

Yes, and have verfied what is being used with "ldd pvbatch". Note that the Wiki reference you provide is about setting up a server, not batch.

pvbatch does not support the option "--use-offscreen-rendering" and should not need that option when the cmake option "use offscreen rendering" has been set.

Thanks!

Ah.  I didn't realize that pvbatch did not support --use-offscreen-rendering.

Kent,

Here's a patch to enable use-offscreen-rendering. Can you verify if that 
helps?

Specifically, the window position parameter is placed in the configuration file ~/.config/ParaView3.X.ini.  You can simply delete that file and all of your settings (including window position) will be reset to their defaults.  Alternatively, you can edit the file and change the window position.  Look for the line "[MainWindow]" and then under that the line that has "Position=@Point(XXX XXX)".  Delete the Position line and the GUI should be reset back to where you can see it.

Someone (me) should file a bug on that.. If some one can tell me  
where that value is being read in the source code, I'll make a patch  
to sanity check the value versus the actual screen bounds.

Subject: [Paraview] MPI Compilation Flags
Message-ID: <47F54D29.2080104@users.sourceforge.net>

At one time I didn't mind looking through, e.g., an "mpicxx" script, to 
figure out the flags to compile MPI programs for a given platform.  That 
is getting harder and harder to do now.  I did it for IBM AIX, but 
recently I've been trying to build MPI-enabled ParaView on a Cray XT4, 
and the scripts are very involved.  Worse, in some versions of OpenMPI 
for Linux, mpicc/mpicxx are executables that read from driver files.

Yet, I can't simply use ... CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx ccmake ... because the 
intermediate executables for parsing and generating code must be built 
for serial execution.

So what about some options to specify MPI compilers instead of or in 
addition to MPI_LIBRARY, etc.?  I could probably work on the CMake 
scripts to implement this myself, but don't want to if there are major 
objections to that approach.  Or, if someone is already planning on 
doing this, I'd love to know as it would save me _lots_ of time.

Thanks,
Sean

Thanks! Sorry it took so long to try. The results are exactly the same in both the version using MPI (run with mpiexec -np 2 pvbatch) and the one without (run with pvbatch).

Both display windows. The non-mpi version doesn't crash because it finds an X server.

I know gdb and my versions have been compiled for debugging. Can you think of a key location where I could stop it and look at some variables? If we could convince the non-mpi version to refrain from looking for an X server we have probably fixed the mpi version too.

Hmmm. It sounds like you need to use the cross-compilation support we have been
on. We already built paraview on Xt3 and Blue Gene using it. The idea there is
that  you first build a small subset of ParaView using the native
compilers and then
use the generators from that to build paraview for another target. I
can point you
to some documentation if you are interested.

I am working on a patch to sanity check the setting when I noticed  
the following in the constructor of pqSettings:

pqSettings::pqSettings(
     const QString& organization,
     const QString& application,
     QObject* p) :
   QSettings(QSettings::IniFormat, QSettings::UserScope,  
organization, application, p)
{
}

The part that bothers me is the QSettings::IniFormat. Shouldn't that  
be QSettings::NativeFormat Instead? At least on OS X I would really  
like to see my ParaView prefs stored where I would expect them to be  
stored, in my Preferences folder. Hunting in .config is not  
particularly "Mac like".

Are there any issues with making this change? or at least putting in  
a #ifdef Q_WS_MAC so that the more Mac like thing happens on OS X?

Thanks
Mike

PS. I just need to test the multiple monitor code before I send a patch.

Message-ID: <473463.4078.qm@web34202.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I had downloaded and tried to build paraview3.2.1
which worked but kept crashing. Then I decided to
download ParaView3.2 and try that build. At this point
cmake refuses to give me any options. I get a blank
screen with only one option

CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY

what does this mean. What stupid thing have I done
wrong?

Any help would be much appreciated

Cheers

Interestingly, I tried today executing the same script using pvbatch and it
works fine, it just seems to hang when using the python shell in the GUI.

If I remove the step to save the file, it runs fine, and outputs all the

The script is attached. I'm using PV 3.2.1 on AIX 5.3 - the X server is
cygwin forwarded over PuTTY SSH.  Any ideas what might be wrong?

Which version of Mesa are you using? Did you compile it yourself? If we know
the version, we may be able to reproduce it.

I am using Mesa 6.4.2 (not mangled) - it was compiled by one of my
colleagues.  The cygwin X package is version 6.8.2-4.

Which version of Mesa are you using? Did you compile it yourself? If we know
the version, we may be able to reproduce it.

Using camera through the python shell in the GUI had issues in ParaView 
3.2. However, those issues should be fixed on the CVS head. Are you 
using 3.2 or CVS Paraview?

I assume you are following the Build & Install page, but just in case 
here it is:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

That said, it sounds like you just need to press the "c" key to run 
"configure" the first time.  The wiki may not be precisely clear on that 
point.  After that you will have more settings to adjust.  Set all of 
them as appropriate for your configuration, then press c again.  You'll 
likely have to repeat the process as per the wiki page.

If that doesn't work or if you have more problems, you should also list 
your platform, compilers, etc. when you post to the list.

Using camera through the python shell in the GUI had issues in ParaView 
3.2. However, those issues should be fixed on the CVS head. Are you 
using 3.2 or CVS Paraview?

Ah ok. Yea, 3.2's GUI python shell had issues with camera. We were not 
using python interpretors/threads correctly, which resulted in callback 
deadlocks. It should be fixed in CVS.

Utkarsh,

On Windows only precompiled 3.2.1. I'm not sure about linux. I will try the
CVS somewhere next week.

Hi Kent,

Not sure if this will help, but one area that gave me trouble when trying to
compile without X11 was VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx.

Check out the file
<paraview-build-dir>/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManagerConfigure.h, it
may reveal some defines related to GLX extension loading.  I had to hack
some cmake files to make the ExtensionManager behave without X11.  If this
turns out to be the problem, I can tell you specifically what I did.

This sounds like a thread I started:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2008-March/007428.html

Utkarsh felt it was because the window was being created and destroyed each time the image was saved. I don't think a bug was filed and I don't think it has yet been fixed.

On another system using Mesa there was no problem.

Thanks! The only reason I haven't tried it yet is that I have to finish this paper for this summer's TeraGrid conference. I'm saying a lot of good things about ParaView and mention the upcoming paper on the XT3 port. Maybe Monday.

Its great that this has already been resolved on the XT3 since that is the destination for this batch script as soon as I get it to run at least once on our Linux cluster.

Didn't want to imply that compiling on XT3 requires hacked cmake files.  The
XT3 build works from CVS head without modifications.

My issue was when X11 libs were found by cmake, but I wanted to compile
without them.  This wasn't a problem on XT3 because X11 isn't found at all.

Hi Pat,

Sorry I posted my previous note to the list; I didn't look at the email addresses carefully.

So on my Linux cluster build, if I delete all references to X11 files in cmake, would cmake still proceed? Would that help?

It's been a couple months since I worked through this issue, but if I
remember correctly it is in VTK/Rendering/CMakeLists.txt:

    IF(VTK_USE_X)
      CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS(glXGetProcAddressARB
VTK_USE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB)

So, if VTK_USE_X is true (on Linux it is forced true, perhaps this should be
changed?) then it checks for glXGetProcAddressARB.  So it doesn't even
matter if X11_*_LIB cmake variables are set or not.  CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS
finds X11 and compiles it into the extension manager.  If you clear cmake's
references to XLibs, you'll get linker errors.

Hi Kent,

Attached is patch. With this patch (and OSMesa build) I could do:

mpirun -np 2 ./bin/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering  /tmp/foo.py

on a machine with no X. I still get the  "bad X server connection." from 
the OpenGLExtensionManager -- which I guess you fix using Pat's 
suggestions. However, in spite of the error message, things should work 
fine.

Let me know if this patch works, if so, I'll commit it to the CVS.

Can you send me some pointers or config files? I've decided to buy a quad

Subject: [Paraview] can paraview 3.2.1 display polyhedron?
Message-ID: <735409.29802.qm@web35301.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear PVers:

I am using OpenFOAM CFD solver.  It has an utility call checkMesh that prints out each element type and its total number.  In a case I am working on, it indicated that there are a about 1000 polyhedrons and about 10000 hex elements.  But, in paraview 3.2.1, I am not sure saw any polyhedron.  I saw something looks like prism.  Is there any special thing that I have to do to display polyhedron in PV?

Thanks!

Pei

    Hello, evreyone.
    I have a questions about installing paraview.
     I want to install Paraview using the Source version. I went to the
Paraview Wiki,
and I found that maybe I need  a GPL version of Qt to compile Paraview
because I want to do some development about Paraview.
But how can I obtain the  GPL version of Qt or do I need a commercial Qt
license if I want to compile Paraview?
Thanks for your help!

  hi
  I am posting this again as there was no reply, but it would have been my fault, i had little understanding about my dataset then. Anyway, I now have a question regarding paraviews data format. I have a text file that consists on xyz points together with temperature, velocity and pressure points. I would like to know how do I convert it so that it is paraview readable. Any examples in the ParaView Data files that I can look into.

of "Obtaining GPL'ed Qt for windows.Then I expand the file
paraview-3.2.1.zip to a folder ,and I run the CMaker to configure it .But I
have run into this situation.
It  Shows that :
1.Qt was not found
2. Qt 4.2.2 or greater not found.Plaese check the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE
variable.
3.Error in configuration process, project files may be invalid.

How can I do with it?
Thanks so much for your help!

I want to clarify something here. The web page for GPL'ed version of
Qt on Windows mentions that the downloads are for MinGW alone. This is
not accurate. The source code can be used to build binaries for Visual
Studio.

Please download the latest version of Qt from Trolltech's web site
(source code), build and install it using your compiler. I use 4.3.4.

Point the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable to the qmake executable,  
probably C:\Qt\4.2.3\bin\qmake.exe, and configure again.

I do not think that Qt 4.3.4 will compile with paraview 3.2.1, only  
with paraview CVS. At least it didn't the last time I checked (a few  
weeks back).

You have two options you can write your own file reader in c++ or

You are right. I am sorry for the mistake, I wasn't thinking clearly.
Qt 4.3 is needed for CVS ParaView. Qt 4.2.3 for 3.2.1.

We use OpenMPI on our cluster, and a command that seems to work is the following:

  mpirun -bynode -np 4 /path/to/paraview -display localhost:0 :
     -np 4 /path/to/paraview -display localhost:1

The -bynode flag tells mpirun to assign processes in a round robin fashion.  The next part says that the first 4 processes should be launched as paraview with the display set to the first graphics card.  The colon (:) sets of the next partition of processors, another 4 instances of paraview with their display set to the second graphics card.

I don't know if other implementations of MPI such as mpich support the -bynode flag and the use of the : to specify different command lines for different blocks of processes, but I am sure that there is some convention for launching heterogeneous jobs.

I tried to save an animation and then just a screen shot using the

This is with ParaView CVS (as of this morning), VS2005 Pro under Win

Message-ID: <47FA43CE.8070702@gmail.com>

Hi
i am looking for a complete reference to generate vtk file by my CFD 
code which supports multi-block grids (structered grid in each block). 
It seems that i should use vtk file format with XML syntax. my code is 
in fortran and i am not familiar with XML.

which reference is the most suitable one that you can recommend for a 
beginner?
Is the book titled "VTK User Guide" a complete reference in this way?

Hadian

I'll try applying the patch so that I can use pvbatch with offscreen
rendering and see if that makes the problem go away.

How do I file a bug for this?

This sounds like a thread I started:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2008-March/007428.html

Utkarsh felt it was because the window was being created and destroyed each
time the image was saved. I don't think a bug was filed and I don't think it
has yet been fixed.

On another system using Mesa there was no problem.

All you need to know about the XML syntax is shown in the document on VTK file formats at the VTK site, under Technical Documents.

Subject: [Paraview] How to save an image sequence in Paraview?
Message-ID: <47FA5A22.6090003@gmx.de>

Hi,

if you load a sequence of image data in ParaView 3.x and you want to 
save it as a sequence after doing some operations on it, Paraview 
Writers do not allow writing a sequence.

Per default they expect that the user types in a file name which will 
call the SetFileName -method of the respective vtk writer class, but 
there is no possibility to set a file prefix and pattern.

I tried to writer my own plugin for a tiff Writer, but i did not succeed 
  (server xml file is given at the end of message). Does anyone know a 
how to enable the writing of image sequences?

Thank you for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about kwsys_io_sstream.h.in
Message-ID: <165799.8312.qm@web34207.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

In trying to clean up an IRIX build (mips 7.3.1) and
have a problem with signed char being used in
vtkCharArray.cxx (using vtkVariant.cxx). Basically an
iostream operator>> is failing against an undefined
(signed char* ).

I tried adding a simple

istream& operator>>(sizgned char inC) { return *this
>> (char) inC; }
into kwsys_io_sstream.h.in and rerunning cmake config
and generate.

This is now breaking the CommandLineArgument.cxx
compile in the same vtk/Utilities directory.

Any thoughts anyone on a better way to fix this or
what the problem could be?

cheers

Hi Utkarsh,

Sorry its taken so long to try this. Summary: nothing changed - it still fails exactly as before.

You might want to take a close look at your environment when you test it. When you log onto a parallel system I think you still provide a way for it to reach an X server. My parallel system also has no X server but it still got back to the X server of my workstation via the ssh connection which sets the environment variable DISPLAY. When I ran the program I would see windows appearing on the screen for a second. However, when I unset the environment variable DISPLAY it crashed.

More importantly, I tried to emulate the situation would would have in a true batch environment such as we have on the XT3. There, jobs are submitted with the qsub command. What is submitted is a script. qsub is not used on the Linux cluster where I am testing this but I can emulate it with the "at" command. Example: "at -f cut.job NOW" submits file cut.job for immediate execution. That file is simple:

mpiexec -np 2 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering cut.py >& cut.log

My default environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH select the correct version of pvbatch, i.e., the compiled from CVS with MPI. However, when submitted this way, the environment variable DISPLAY is not set. The above job fails with no output because of the bad X server connection.

I've attached one of the Python scripts I've been using for testing. I might not be setting something in it that is needed.

Cheers,
Kent

Something is fishy here. We obviously ran examples both on Xt3 and
BlueGene and generated screenshots without X. So, there is a
difference between pvbatch compiled for those platforms and the one
you compiled. I'll discuss this with Pat and Utkarsh tomorrow.

Thanks! Is certainly possible I've done something wrong. Maybe one of my options for cmake is incorrect?

Does Qt need to be pointed towards Mesa? I didn't see anything in the Qt build about it.

Dear Kent
the only documentation about file format on vtk site is
http://vtk.org/pdf/pvtk.pdf which is extracted from VTK user guide book and
explained the XML syntax brifly. is there any other document with more
examples? (if the book is more complete and have more examples i will buy
it.)

Subject: [Paraview] Filter Plot Cell over Time: BUG?
Message-ID: <002401c89941$cb14ef90$2d83bf8b@elsaunit.local>

Hi,
I have some problems with the filter 'Plot Cell over Time'. 
I use ParaView 3.2.1 (Windows) with pvd and vtu files. This works very fine.
Also the filter 'Plot Cell over Time' works well by using it without groups
in the pvd file.

If I want to plot the cell data over time with groups I have to extract one
group with 'Extract Datasets' (otherwise I get an error message "Can only
select points or cells from a subclass of vtkDataSet").
If I use then with one extracted group the filter 'Plot Cell over Time' I
get the same error message. If I ignore the message and press Apply,
ParaView crushes.

Is it
* a problem in my data files (see an example with two elements in two groups
http://www.larcher.de/static/bug.zip)
* not possible to visualize cells over time by using cells in groups
* a special problem of the Windows version
* a bug in ParaView

Thank you for a feedback!
Martin

The next part says that the first 4 processes should be launched as paraview with the display set to the first graphics card.  The colon (:) sets of the next partition of processors, another 4 instances of paraview with their display set to the second graphics card.

Thanks for the info, it should prove usefull. I'm using openMPI to.

  Hi

  I've compiled in instaled paraview to /opt/something

  After make install paraview doesn't run. Basicaly it didn't find the 
libraries. After ldd to the paraview binary I've noticed that:

  - in /opt/something dir it didn't find the libraries
  - in the compile dir the libraries were linked with a complete path to 
that dir (like  /usr/src/paraview_linux/bin )

  I have add a line to ld.so.conf to add paraview libraries to the system 
but that doesn't seem a good idea for the future. Any suggestions?

Thanks for the idea, but i am kinda new to Paraview and visualization in general, I have checked out the PLOT3D information in wiki, how do I write my own plot3d file, right now, I only have a text file full with coordinates and the pressure values. The vtk file format looks easier to follow,any specific example of file in the VTKData/Paraview Data that I can go  through.

After restart it doesn't work anymore. The paraview binary can't find the 
libraries altough they are available in the system (checked through 
ldconfig -p).

Hello ,everyone,
I have installed ParaView form the source, and also I can run it now.
Now ,I want to  debug ParaView with Visual Studio 2005.
If I want to find the step that how does ParaView open a VTK file, where
should I insert the breakpoint?
Thanks so much for all of you!

Depends on the file format. If it is a .vtk you would need to break in
vtklegacyfilereader.

This was not supported in 3.2. It is now supported. You can either
build from cvs or wait until we release binaries for a development
snapshot very soon (1 week probably).

Hi Ricardo,

I am guessing this is Linux. Did you compile with VTK_USE_RPATH on or off?

yes, a debian box. VTK_USE_RPATH on

and I've tried a new build with it off but it fails to compile (attached

Subject: [Paraview] How to create an animation on filters
Message-ID: <830550.95271.qm@web51003.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi,
   
  I was trying to create an animation in ParaView 3.2.1.
  I want to make an animation not on a specific dataset but a collection  (say n) of datasets. Hence I load my 20 datasets and want to make an animation where each  dataset becomes 'visible'  for sometime and then disappears, when the next dataset would become visible. That is:
  frame-1: Dataset1 visible & Dataset 2-n invisible
  frame-2: Dataset2 visible & Dataset1, 3-n invisible 
  ....
  frame n: Dataset-n visible & Dataset1 - n-1 invisible 
   
  If someone can help with the steps to do so, that would be greatly helpful.
   
  Thanks.

Message-ID: <8e0b87a90804081528w14bb455ep585008d27fb7529f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two vti files, each with a bunch of scalar data which I am trying to
combine with Group Datasets filter.  After  Group Dataset filter, the
"Display>Color By" list either has only the scalars in one of the combined
files, or nothing at all (other than Cell Normals).

Other than this, all is fine (data sets appear combined) in
"Information>Data Arrays" display, or as inputs to filters such as
Threshold. Indeed, my final objective is to Threshold with a point data in
one of the files and Color By a point data in the other. And I am unable to
accomplish this with Group Datasets. I am using Paraview 3.2.1 on ia32_64 on
Linux. The two vti files are here
<http://miyav.ath.cx/t_/groupdatasets.tgz>if you like to give it a
try.

thanks many,
Levent

Thanks for tracking this down Ken. It is cumbersome as you said but this
method works(around).

Subject: [Paraview] How can I read the DICOM data as a volume (not on a

Message-ID: <20a72bf00804081616l297d6aa1mcc41d3482a1342b7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'd like to read a DICOM volume data (a set of slice files) in ParaView.

All the DICOM files representing the 2D slice information were
converted into the raw data using a free dicom converter, dicom2
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VTK_FAQ#How_can_I_read_DICOM_files_.3F).
 Then, each of converted images were successfully read by ParaView,
however I don't know how to read the data as a volume (not on a
slice-by-slice basis).

I'd appreciate any suggestions and help.

Thank you,

amayt

Hi,

I have the latest version checked out from CVS and in the information tab it
shows all the data arrays with "partial" in brackets after the name when
grouping the datasets.  You might want to try using the "AppendAttributes"
filter instead which, I think, does what you want.

Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <47FC7BEA.30002@cscs.ch>

I've just checked in some changes to the vtkXdmfReader for handling time 
dependent data.

I have also uploaded a test dataset to here
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/xdmf

this contains a single Volume of dimension {24,24,24} with several 
scalar/vector fields.
Interesting Vector fields are
    X-Vector {1, 0, 0}
    Y-Vector {0, 1, 0}
    Z-Vector {0, 0, 1}
which makes it ideal for testing. Some other fields are block number and 
suchlike which are only useful to me.

In the Xdmf xml file, the same data is referenced twice - so there are 
two time steps - they are actually the same data in both time steps, but 
the second step swaps the x,y,z vector fields around by simple changing 
the string references to datasets in the hdf5 file.

In timestep 0 (time value 0.0)
x - X
y - Y
z - Z
In timestep 1 (time value 0.2)
x - Y
y - Z
z - X

The changes I have made to the XdmfReader might break some code since I 
had to change the Grid storage from a Map structure to a vector - to 
allow the same grid name to be used for multiple time steps. There are 
also many other small tweaks/fixes all over the place.

I will check in some changes to the vtkXdmfWriter later, but will post 
separately on that.

Please let me know of any problems this introduces - I think there is 
still much work to be done (c.f. other vtk data types)

JB

Hi again

I managed to convert my xyz file into a polydata file ( .vtp). I understand
that there are 2 type of file format in paraview, one serial and the other
paralle, anyway I used paraview to convert the vtp file into .pvtp.
(parallel polygonal data )-- is this wat correct

my vtp file is quite large, so I cant display it here, I am copying the pvtp
file here


<?xml version="1.0"?>

<VTKFile type="PPolyData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">

<PPolyData GhostLevel="0">

<PPointData Scalars="Scalar">

<PDataArray type="Float32" Name="Scalar"/>

</PPointData>

<PPoints>

<PDataArray type="Float32" Name="Array 0x02116850" NumberOfComponents="3"/>

</PPoints>

<Piece Source="ss_0.vtp"/>

</PPolyData>

</VTKFile>

is this alrite,  can anyone point out to me.. what is the next step after
this. I have created a cluster of 2 nodes and I need to be able to run this
data, how do I find out if this data is actually being distributed across
the nodes.

Hi,

I'm using EnSight gold files that have nfaced cells in them (effectively
polyhedrons). Unfortunately they don't display correctly when I try to
view the wireframe or the surface with edges. Instead of the actual
faces the shape has (and that are defined in the EnSight file) it
instead shows the edges of the tetrahedrons it has tessellated into the
space. For the purpose I'm trying to use it for it's important that I'm
able to see the original mesh.

As far as I can see paraview represents an nfaced object as a
vtkConvexPointSet, effectively just a cloud of points ignoring all data
about which points correspond to which faces. Is there any way to get
around this and get back to the original shape?

-Alex

I have just re-uploaded the test data xdmf file because I left the full 
path (C:\temp\blah) in the file reference. I have replaced it with just 
the relative part and checked it loads ok on win32/linux.
(NB. loading in parallel failed. I will find the problem right away)

You could do this by wrapping the file reader you are using in a file 
series reader, you can find a guide on how to do this at 
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series. This is what I 
used for a couple custom readers I wrote that wanted to animate over 'time'.

i need to implement VTK with XML syntax in my code. is there any other 
document with more examples?
i guess one of the books published by kitware should be complete 
reference with enough examples, but i am not sure! if anyone has the 
books let me know if there is complete explanation about that topic in 
the book. so i will buy that book.

I just tested it in CVS and can confirm it is fixed.

You can apply "Process Id Scalars" to have paraview create scalars
that map to process ids.

Comparative viewing is a great tool to look at multiple timesteps. While 
preparing our next set of tutorial, I am running against the following 
issues:

1) parallel projection must be turned OFF, otherwise the views are not 
linked.
2) time range of the data must be [0-1], otherwise timesteps are 
truncated to [0-1]
3) With a time-range of [0-1], the last frame never ends up at time=1, 
but at an earlier timestep. Looking in the source code, an easy fix is 
on line 565 of ./Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMComparativeViewProxy.cxx

changing the computation of the increment from

  double increment =  (this->TimeRange[1] - this->TimeRange[0])/
    (this->Dimensions[0]*this->Dimensions[1]);

to

  double increment =  (this->TimeRange[1] - this->TimeRange[0])/
    (this->Dimensions[0]*this->Dimensions[1] - 1.0);

fixes at least that issue. May we suggest to the developpers to apply 
this change, and see how issues 1) and 2) could be fixed.

This is with ParaView cvs of today.

cheers
Jean

I must admit I still encounter issues with the creation of a sphere 
interactor... Can someone tell me if this feature will be really 
available in Paraview 3.4 (and when it will be released in that event)

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting boundary regions
Message-ID: <47FCEA52.3070401@nacad.ufrj.br>


I'm looking for a way to extract boundary regions from solid 
unstructured meshes (tetrahedra). The purpose of this is simple: use 
ParaView to set boundary conditions for a CFD code. In PV 2.6.2 I'm able 
to extract plane aligned regions using the following pipeline: (as an 
example, let's consider I'm extracting those boundary nodes lying on the 
maximum X coordinate:)

Unstructured mesh (tetrahedra) --> Extract surface --> Calculator (get 
coords_0 scalar per point values) --> Threshould (Scalars = Result of 
the calculator filter, Lower and Upper set to the maximum value).

Ok, it works just fine. My problem is regarding non aligned boundaries. 
Here is an example of what I'm trying to do 
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/regions.jpg . In this 
example, I can extract the plane boundary regions but I can't extract 
the cylinder at the middle of the domain. Any idea?

Regards

Renato.

Putting on my "way back" hat, I seem to remember us having problems
with parallel HDF5. To make it work we had to set some NFS parameter
which turned out to negatively impact performance of NFS. I believe
that is why we added the SetUseSerialFile() method to XdmfHDF.

Subject: [Paraview] [PV3] Ensight writer plugin problem
Message-ID: <47FD07CE.6060405@nacad.ufrj.br>


Following the TiffWriter example, I tried to load the vtkEnsightWriter 
writer as a plugin in PV3. It compiles and load in PV without any 
problem but when I try to save an unstructured mesh using the plugin I 
get the following error message:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3_CVS\VTK\Parallel\vtkEnSightWriter.cxx, line 
1154

What am I doing wrong? I used a cube source meshed with the "Delaunay 3D 
filter" as test and my xml files were defined with the following parameters:

<!-- GUIEnsightWriter.xml-->

Wouldn't extract surface -> clip work? You may need 6 clip filters
now. We are going to add the functionality of clipping with a box back
in soon. You also be able to use the selection stuff. Select the cells
and extract them maybe?

What a shame, I had forgotten the clip filter... but I'm afraid that the 
clip box (or 6 planes) will not be accurate to select the right region 
since it would try to intersect the mesh and not select the nodes and 
cells based on their coordinates (as I did with the threshold). For 
example: with the clip filter I could not select those nodes lying on 
the bottom and top faces since they are shared by the cylinder and the 
clip filter would cut them out.

Anyway, the clip filter can help to solve the problem partially.

Hmm. I think you can do this in paraview 3. I added a filter call
"Extract Cells by Region". It is like clip but it does not actually
clip the cells it intersects, it either keeps them or discards them
(user option). That filter would allow you to create a plane that
intersects the cells to be included.

I had already tried that with no luck. The filter name suggested me 
exactly what I'm looking for. I also tried several possibilities using 
this filter, changed the normals, origin, turned the check box on and 
off, etc..., but the resulting selections were not what I was expecting. 
It should be simple to select points and cells by coordinates, shouldn't 
it? Maybe, it should be available from the "selection inspector" toolbar.

Message-ID: <iss.bb8178fe.4e81.47fdd17b.6c9c9.8@mailout.lrz-muenchen.de>

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to write a simple reader to better understand what goes on inside 
ParaView. I've completed its source code and am now trying to get it 
integrated into the GUI they way it is described in "Extending ParaView" 
and "Plugin HowTo" on the wiki pages.

Attached to this post you will find my source files. They compile without 
error. Loading the plugin into ParaView does not add an entry to the file 
types-combo box in the Open Dialog. It seems like something's wrong with my  
XML or cmakelists.txt. What did I get wrong, where's my mistake?

Another question I would like to ask is how "Plot Over Time" would be done 
with the current CVS version. Using "Extract Selection Over Time" gives me 
multiple errors like "Failed to locate X array". My CVS build is from the last 
weekend.


Best regards
Alex

Hi,

I also tried building with the patch you provided (no MPI enabled either)
and ran:

/usr/local/packages/paraview/paraview-serial/bin/pvbatch
--use-offscreen-rendering test.py

But as before, an X window popped up when it started rendering.  I've
attached my CMakeCache.txt file in case there's something I'm setting up
wrong...

Cheers

Thanks! Is certainly possible I've done something wrong. Maybe one of my
options for cmake is incorrect?

Does Qt need to be pointed towards Mesa? I didn't see anything in the Qt
build about it.

Subject: [Paraview] Black render view with python & MPI build
Message-ID: <00fe01c89aee$e90bae90$da3fd781@epcc.ed.ac.uk>

Hi,

I have build a number of different configurations (PV 3.2.1) and the
following ones work OK:

Paraview serial with python
Paraview with MPI without python (static libs)

But not

Paraview with MPI with python (shared libs).
Paraview with MPI withoutpython (shared libs).

In these cases I can run a server (one or many MPI tasks) and connect to it
OK.  It will read files, and run filters OK, but all I ever see is a black
render view.  The trigger for this appears to be any build where I set
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON and PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON.  I have tried MPI on, and
shared libs off and this works fine, but unfortunately if I want to build
with python I am forced into using shared libs.

There are no error messages logged on the client or server side as far as I
can see, just nothing appears in the render view except the XYZ axes (but
not the centre-of-rotation crosshairs).

Any ideas how to go about debugging this, or what I might be able to do to
work around this?

Cheers

- Iain

Hi,

There is an example reader in the paraview source code:

ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/Reader

Your example looks like it is missing an XML file and the XML file you have
attached is for the GUI (GUI_RESOURCE_FILES) not the server
(SERVER_MANAGER_XML).

Regards,
Paul

The OpenGL (Mesa) libraries are static in all cases.

Is this likely to be the problem?

I'll try doing a build with shared libs for Mesa instead.

Cheers

Possibly. I do this on Linux regularly and I didn't run into any
issues yet. However, I am told that it is dangerous thing to do.
Something about all shared libraries importing symbols from the static
libraries independently.

Kent/Iain,

Here's another patch (the earlier patch had a typo--my bad)

Make sure you follows these steps:

* Update ParaView to current CVS head. The patch is against the CVS 
head. There are a few fixes/changes in the CVS that affect the behaviour.

* Then apply the patch

* Ensure that paraview is built with OS mesa

* Use the command line option "--use-offscreen-rendering". This option 
must be specified before the python script name is provided as follows:
 > ./bin/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering test.py

Possibly. I do this on Linux regularly and I didn't run into any
issues yet. However, I am told that it is dangerous thing to do.
Something about all shared libraries importing symbols from the static
libraries independently.

Subject: [Paraview] how to open multiple .vtu files at once?
Message-ID: <E72407A1-F70A-4BDF-A198-B10AB8E116BD@gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I was wondering if there is a way to open multiple .vtu files that are  
completely independent from a single file. I tried using a .pvd file  
as follows:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
      <DataSet group="" part="0" file="domain.vtu"/>
      <DataSet group="" part="1" file="network.vtu"/>
      <DataSet group="" part="2" file="mesh0.vtu"/>
</Collection>
</VTKFile>

Even though I can see the geometry of all the files, I do not have  
access to the fields defined in them. Thanks for the help,

aa

Alejandro,

PV will load all three files individually -- just OPEN each one in turn.
They can each have their own unique and separate point/cell data items.
You can post process each file separately and turn them on/off by 
clicking on the "eyeball" beside each file/filter in the pipeline window.

In your PVD file, I believe that each "part" has to have the same cell 
items and the same point items (can have zero's if needed). At least 
that is how I use *.pvd files.

Message-ID: <245222690804132344r634034fas845b47b52c63d42d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, everyone ,
I have got a question about debuging paraview.
Since I have installed paraview and GPL'ed Qt successfully, I want to debug
it now to see how it works!
But I do not know where I can set a breakpoint if I want to open a file with
the form of VTK.
So where should I set the breakpoint which may let me know how it open a VTK
file.

Thanks so much!

Hi Alejandro,

This is a missing feature. It is partially handled in the cvs version.
We will finish it before 3.4 is released. For now, you can use the
Extract Group filter to extract the part you are interested in.

Message-ID: <75A04B23-23E6-431E-A9A8-3AFC359F071D@sjc.ox.ac.uk>

I am a new user to Paraview so pardon me if I am asking an simple or  
obvious question.

I am trying to visualize my output from a molecular dynamics  
simulation using LAMMPS (http://lammps.sandia.gov) and I was  
wondering if anyone has experience in bringing existing data from  
LAMMPS over to a format Paraview can use, or has written a plugin for  
LAMMPS/Paraview?

I have done some basic python scripting to convert my existing data  
to legacy vtk files (ascii and binary) but it runs very slowly given  
the amount of data I have to go through.

Also I was wondering if there were any suggestions on plug-ins for  
Paraview specifically for working with the results from molecular/ 
atomistic simulations that typically do not have defined meshes as in  
the case of traditional CFD.

Many thanks in advance,

Dan

LAMMPS can create XYZ files and ParaView can read XMol files using  the XYZ file format. You might want to look into this and consult the "master list" of ParaView readers:

Message-ID: <2f89f9890804140947h384b8e15i5909921e7ce401c8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all. I am new to paraview, and playing around a bit to see if it
fits my needs. It looks good but I can use some help.

I have created a simple structured_grid vtk datafile, with deformation
vectors as point_data and 3x3 stress tensors as cell_data. The
deformation I can visualize by either coloring or a warp filter. But
how to visualize the stress tensor? I can not find any tensor related
options / filters - for instance, a way to compute maximum principle
stresses (largest eigenvalue) or surface traction (stress times
normal). What would be perfect is to make a clip or slice and
visualize the traction at that plane as glyphs. Is something like that
possible?

In the list archives I found a similar question [1] that was answered
as "Everything you want to do (and more) to display finite element
structural analysis results is available in ParaView." - without
further explanation. Could someone please point me in the direction?

I don't think any of the tensor specific VTK algorithms are enabled by
default in ParaView. Maybe there are some that wrote plugins out
there. vtkTensorGlyph is probably a good starting point. Also, you can
use the array calculator and the python programmable filter to
calculate derived quantities. In the next version of ParaView, there
will be support for calling numpy from the programmable filter. That
would make it pretty easy to calculate some of the derived variables
you are interested in.

Sorry to derail the conversation, but is the numpy going to be bundled 
with paraview ( does this mean python will come with paraview too) or is 
it just going to be that if you have numpy currently installed, it will 
be imported?

Message-ID: <E1BD088683EF744ABFB0ED62370BEB8B0B41BDC0@ERD-ML4ERD.erd.ds.usace.army.mil>

gentle folk.

i am having some trouble with the LSDyna reader in both VTK and ParaView 3.
well not exactly trouble; but for SOLID elements the Effective Plastic strain
variable that the
LSDyna documentation says is ALWAYS written out for the SOLID elements is not
read.
there's accounting for it in the computation of state size [NUMVD3 is 7  (six
for 'stress' and EPS)]; but no code is given to add the array, etc.  
the documentaion i'm looking at is data 1994 revised May 2002, if that helps.

i've tried adding a cell array etc in the appropriate spots (where i see the
'stress' array added) etc ; but i must be missing something because i can't
get it to work correctly.

looking for either guidance on what to do or a fix to the LSDyna reader in
the CVS.

thanks.

I am not sure what the right thing to do is. So far, I am planning on
not distributing numpy with the binaries but include python.

Sorry, that was an oversight on my part.

I've committed a fix to VTK that works for me from ParaView with one of
the LSDyna examples. If you either update to the CVS trunk or add this
line:
    p->AddCellArray( vtkLSDynaReader::SOLID, LS_ARRAYNAME_EPSTRAIN, 1, 1 );
just after a similar line for LS_ARRAYNAME_STRESS (line 3194 of the
trunk), it should be available. Please let me know if it doesn't work
for you.

Works for me too.  Of course now I have the problem that with the server
compiled from CVS, it now won't connect back to my 3.2.1 Windows client...

When is the next stable version going to be released so I can get a matching
Windows binary?

Cheers

Thanks for the reply. I'm afraid right now I can not afford the time
to start writing filters or extensions; the learning curve is a bit
too steep. I was rather hoping for a built-in hidden feature. ( I
suppose you get that a lot ;)

I'll just leave it for now. Thanks anyhow.

However, I do still get the problem mentioned earlier in the thread where
there is a spurious message about the processes failing to open an X
connection, even when --use-offscreen-rendering is specified.

I had a look for the VTK_USE_X setting but there's not one in my
CMakeCache.txt, so I'm not sure what to change to get this to work.

Any thoughts?

Yup, I am aware of the message. It needs a bit more clean up. I'll get 
to it as soon as I have some spare time.

Paraview list,

I am new to visualization software and have a very basic question. 
The situation is I have a set of data created in an excel model, a 
set of 100 data points, with an independent variable. I need to 
create an animation of this data set changing over time. I have 
played with Paraview and can create the planes I would like the 
data to appear on, but cannot figure out how to import the data 
onto the planes.

Any help would be appreciated, again, I'm new to this!

David

Hi everyone


Was just wondering how do I configure Paraview3.2.1 with open mpi,

my  MPI_LIBRARY= points to libmpi.a

but I left the mpi_extra_library path empty,should I fill up this.

Cally, there is no general answer to your question. Different implementations of MPI require different things. You need to learn what files a C++ program using your MPI needs when linking. Be sure to include your MPI library for C++, if there is one.

For example, on one of our Linux clusters:

MPI_LIBRARY:
/usr/local/packages/mvapich2/lib/libmpich.so

MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:
-L/usr/local/packages/mvapich2/lib;-Wl,-rpath;-Wl,/usr/local/packages/mvapich2/lib;-lmpichcxx;-lmpich;-L/usr/lib64;-lrdmacm;-libverbs;-l
ibumad;-lpthread;-lrt

Subject: [Paraview] Windows MPI build error
Message-ID: <2f129ba325cd644e816701e4fff3b393@mail.mirarco.org>

We have the ParaView CVS from about a week ago and MPICH2 - just installed. I'm attempting an MPI build with SharedLibraries ON.

The following error results:
------ Build started: Project: vtkCommon, Configuration: Release Win32 ------

And, just in case it is also relevant, after telling it to ignore error C4430, the error shifts to:

... repeated many times.

C2491 = can declare a dllimport - , but not define it.

If I understand your question correctly, you have tabular data in an Excel spreadsheet, and you want ParaView to show you this data color coded on a plane.  Unfortunately, our ability to read in Excel and other tabular data is a bit underdeveloped right now, so there is no direct way to do this yet.  An indirect way is to output the spreadsheet as a space or tab delimited text file and then edit that text file to a VTK image file.  Details on the VTK file types are described in the following document posted to the Kitware Wiki.

Thanks! Here's what I think you are suggesting. In this case the Z coordinate of the plane's origin will be animated:

===================================
from paraview import servermanager
servermanager.Connect(
implFuncModule = servermanager._createModule( "implicit_functions" )

# Create plane used to make the cut (used by "Cut" filter)
CP = implFuncModule.Plane()
CP.Origin = [ 0, 0, 0 ]
CP.Normal = [ 0, 0, 1 ]

# Create the text (missing: location, size, etc.)
T = servermanager.sources.TextSource()
T.Text = "Z = 0.0"

# Called during the animation as the cut is changed
class mycallback( servermodule.vtkCommand )
   T.Text = "Z = %3.1f" % CP.Origin[2]

CP.AddObserver( "PropertyModifiedEvent", myCallback )
...
===================================

The one detail I haven't solved is that I cannot find the vtkCommand class in the servermanager. Or am I going at this the wrong way?

hi, thanks for the information, it's just that I am having some problem
configuring paraview with openmpi



I have set my cmake variables as such :



MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY : MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND



MPI_INCLUDE_PATH  :
/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/include



MPI_LIBRARY :



/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/libmpi.a;

/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/libmpi_cxx.a;

/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/libopen-pal.a;

/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib//libopen-rte.a;

/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/openmpi/libompitv.a





And this is how I build my openmpi

./configure --prefix=/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild
 --enable-static
--disable-shared



I have added the bin to the path and lib to the ld_library_path





What am I doing wrong..



I keep getting errors when I used only libmpi.a, then I came across
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-September/005905.html



this link, and I modified my configuration to the same information on the
website and I still receive errors., something to do with pthread_fork?.



Do you think it's the openmpi version, conflicts with Paraview 3.2.1
maybe...?, am using openmpi-1.2.5

I would consider trying the cmake variables as listed by some of the 
others that replied to you.  But if that doesn't work, try a variation 
on your current configuration:

MPI_LIBRARY=/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/libmpi.a

MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY = 
/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/libmpi_cxx.a;
/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/libopen-pal.a;
/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib//libopen-rte.a;
/home/kalpanak/Installation_Files/OpenMPI/openmpibuild/lib/openmpi/libompitv.a

At one time, MPI_LIBRARY could not accept more than one library, hence 
the addition of MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY.  I'm not sure if that is still the 
case, but if so, it could be causing your problems.

Subject: [Paraview] how to utilize warp vector filter?
Message-ID: <1208375844.30256.17.camel@valhalla.cacr.caltech.edu>

Hello,

I have a set of scalar data on an unstructured grid representing
effective stress on a cylindrical tube.  I would like to use the warp
vector filter to exaggerate the displacement of the tube surface.  It
appears that I need to have the cell normals available as a data array
in order to scale the displacement and make it more visible.  How do I
do this?  When I load my unstructured grid data set, neither the Normals
Generation filter nor the Warp (vector) filter is available.  ParaView
is able to color the tube using cell normal as an attribute, but there
does not seem to be a way to extract this attribute and use it for the
warp vector filter.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks, Julian C.

Subject: [Paraview] computer locks up while saving screenshot or animation
Message-ID: <1208376425.30256.28.camel@valhalla.cacr.caltech.edu>

Hello,

I have experienced problems with my computer locking up and requiring a
hard restart while saving multiple screenshots or an animation with
ParaView.  I have a dual-core Opteron machine running Ubuntu 7.10 with a
Nvidia GeForce 6800 XTreme graphics card.  I have tried many different
versions of ParaView, including 2.x versions as well as the current CVS
development version, but they all give the same reproducible problem.  I
have built my ParaView installations with the ffmpeg encoder as
suggested in the instructions.  I have tried turning off the offscreen
rendering for screenshots option in the CVS development version of
ParaView as suggested in a previous post, but this does not help.  Has
anyone else experienced this sort of behavior before and/or have a
suggestion for this problem?

Thanks, Julian C.

This is a known problem for animations using onscreen rendering. Search the messages for the last 3 weeks in the list archives.

The current solution is not easy: build a version of ParaView from CVS using Mesa instead of OpenGL, and set the "use offscreen rendering" flag in cmake. The result works for me using pvbatch with the command line option "--use-offscreen-rendering".

I'm not sure if this solution will help if you use paraview or pvpython. I've only used the PNG writer and don't know about other writers.

Subject: [Paraview] loading series of unstructured grid data files
Message-ID: <1208382686.30256.40.camel@valhalla.cacr.caltech.edu>

Hello,

When I load a series of VTK poly data files named outN.vtk (where N is
the timestep number) into ParaView, everything works as expected.  The
data from the first file is displayed, and the Animation Inspector
automatically recognizes the file sequence.  However, this does not work
for a corresponding series of VTK unstructured grid data files fN.vtu.
Although the files are displayed as a series in the Open File dialog
box, only the first dataset is loaded and the Animation Inspector does
not recognize the file sequence.  I tried renaming the files using
the .vtk extension instead of .vtu but that does not help.  Is there any
way to get ParaView to properly recognize a series of VTK unstructured
grid data files?  I want to avoid having to load each data file manually
because I have a lot of them.

Thanks, Julian C.

Sometimes paraview can be confusing. Let me try to explain what you
are seeing. Each object in the pipeline browser gets assigned a set of
objects to visualize them. I am not going to go into a lot detail but
the relevant object here is a filter that extracts geometry from the
object (vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter). This filter converts any type of
dataset to a set of polygons to be rendered by OpenGL. This may be an
outline or the surface polygons. This filter also automatically
generates normals. This is what you are seeing in the "Color By" menu.
To duplicate this behavior, you can apply "Extract Surface" and then
"Generate Surface Normals". Then you can apply the glyph filter.
Orient by the normals and scale by scalars.

The easiest solution is to go the Settings ->  Render View and then
turn off "Use Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots". You need CVS
paraview. The problem you are running into is due to driver issues.

We may have a fix for this in 3.4. For now, you have to write a pvd
meta-file that points to your individual vtu files. I am going to
write a wiki entry about this one of these days.

Hi Berk,

This got me a lot closer to where I want to be, but not quite there yet.
I want to magnify or exaggerate the very small ripples or displacements
on my tube, so I believe that I need to use the Warp (vector) filter
rather than the Glyph filter (which draws arrows rather than moving the
polygons).  I tried doing this, but the result looks strange...

I can see the displacements if I simply scale the Y and Z axes by a
factor of 100 (the X axis points along the tube in my geometry), but
then of course the tube appears squished.  I was hoping for a simple way
to enhance these radial displacements using ParaView filters.

Julian,

I'm not sure if I understood your problem correctly, but some advices 
could be given:

You said >> When I load my unstructured grid data set, neither the 
Normals Generation filter nor the Warp (vector) filter is available

a). I guess your mesh only has volumetric elements (prisms, tetrahedra, 
hexahedra, etc...). If so, just apply the "extract surface" filter 
first. It will create the external surface elements, after that, you'll 
be able to use the "normal generation" filter.

b). Have you supplied the displacement vector (otherwise, you will not 
be able to apply the warp (vector) since you don't have any vectorial 
variable to use)

c). Magnification: the warp filters (scalar or vector) have a scale 
factor parameter which lets you control the level of exaggeration. If 
you use the displacement vector to warp your cylinder, I guess you'll 
get the effect you want.

I hope it helps you in anything

Regards

Subject: [Paraview] store vector as cell-data in vts file format
Message-ID: <4806F0C2.5070305@gmail.com>

Hi
I am trying to generate vtk xml data file for multi-block data 
(structured grid in each block) with variables stored at cell centers, 
in unsteady condition. So, I am trying to use vts format. The problem I 
encountered is that when I store the velocity vectors as ?celldata?, the 
glyph filter does not show correct vectors. Is it possible to store 
vectors as cell data in vts file?

Hi everyone,

And first, thanks alot for the replies.. it was very helpful!!!
I have built paraview now with open mpi.. and I followed this instruction
from Sean.. I think what caused the error in the first place was the way  my
openmpi was configure, I choose to build static libraries and used that in
my cmake confguration. I compiled my openmpi again using shared libraries
option and it worked. Thanks alot.

Hi all,

I need to extract data from one dataset based on data in another one. I
have two uniform rectilinear grids, one with velocity values the second
one with the ray coverage. I need to extract those data from the
velocity grid where the ray coverage exceeds certain value. I have tried
Append* and Extract* filters, but without any success. Probably mistake
on my side. Can you suggest anything, please? It surely have already
been solved in the list before, but I wasn't able to find the right
answer. 

Thanks to all,
Jan.

I have already solved the problem using the AppendAttributes filter and
latest version of Paraview (3.2.1). It, somehow, doesn't work in my 2.4
version.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.10.0804171314010.2557@localhost>


  Hi

  I've set up a grid using the ensight format but giving a non orthodox 
origin for the grid. When rendering just contours everything works fine. 
If I'm using the "Extract subset" filter it "resets" the cube origin to 
0,0,0 and works from there. Using the "Plot over line" also tried to read 
the vars as if everything was related to the (0,0,0) origin instead of the 
new one, set up on the .geo file.

  I've made a screenshot, it's here:

Is the displacement a vector or a scalar?

This is a limitation of the glyph filter. You will find that many
filters in VTK only work on point-centered data. You can achieve what
you want by first applying the "Cell Centers" filter and then glyph.
You should probably enter a feature request for this here:

Try using the Append Attributes filter to combine the ray coverage and velocity fields into a single data object.  Then use the Threshold filter to extract the blocks with the appropriate ray coverage.  Since the two fields are in the same data object, they will both carry through to the output.

Hi,

Is there a way to convert a multi-block structured grid into a single
unstructured block?

Thanks in advance,

There's a filter called "extract datasets" in PV-3.2.1. Try this one.

That option is disabled when I have a multiblock structured mesh loaded in.
Also, I don't think it is what I want as the book says, "it's output is a
multi-block composite data set".  I would like to merge all the blocks
together into one unstructured mesh.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Paul

I see, I have a similar problem with my Ensight files. In an older PV 
version (2.2.1) it were possible since we could load a model 
piece-by-piece and use the "append datasets" filter followed by "clean 
to grid".

I still keep this version on my machine just to do some things that the 
newer versions don't do yet. You could try to merge your file in 
PV-2.2.1 and export in a VTK format for the newer version (but, I guess, 
PV-3.x will load your merged data as a multi-block even having just one 
piece of data, weird isn't it?).

Regards

Renato.

There will always be tasks like this that ParaView can't do easily. Kitware will never catch up because we will keep inventing new things to do!

A good solution is to build a version of VTK with Python and use it for little tasks like this. In your case the basic sequence would be

   - create vtkAppendFilter
   - read the multi-block grid
   - loop over blocks and add each to the append filter
   - write the append filter's output

I used a similar Python program to combine multi-block PVD files sets into a smaller number of files.

When the blocks share vertices we run the append filter's output through vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid before writing it. This requires a little work because this filter is in ParaView but not VTK. I pulled that filter from the ParaView source tree and added it to VTK following the instructions on the VTK Wiki page "Extending VTK".

Hey Kitware - why are some really great classes like vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid in ParaView instead of VTK?

Hi,
   Can I get some quick feedback on how ParaView and VTK is running
on the MacBook Pro laptops? Is opengl hardware acceleration with the 
Nvidia  GPU and current Apple drivers all working? I am getting ready to 
buy one and I just want to make sure, since one of my primary uses will 
be ParaView visualization of CFD results.
ParaView never did correctly use the hardware in my last trusty laptop 
(Dell M50) ,although it does have a good Nvidia chip set.  (Not 
complaining, I just want to make sure I get a working hardware/driver 
combo this time..)

   Thanks for any feedback.

I have a MacBook Pro 15", about a year and a half old, running Tiger. No special drivers to install or anything like that. Output to second display works out of the box, whether a projector or monitor. It's fabulous.

The Mac build of Paraview works fine, I sometimes build from the cvs trunk and don't have any Mac-specific problems. The Mac install is problematic so I just run out of the build directory; but I know a lot of effort is going into that and I expect it will all be fixed it in 3.4 or soon after.

Hello!

I'm new around here, my name is Renan Leser de Medeiros, I'm a student from
UFRJ - Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. I'm taking the Masters
Course on Civil Engineering, with emphasys on Scientific Visualization.

So, my "boss" here asked me to learn and to produce results with Paraview,
on a week!

I'm really desperate, because I'm working with rivers databases, with .DAT
extensions, but I can't get it working in Paraview.

Paraview do'nt open .DAT files, so I tryed to import using RAW (binary
files). But then, when I press aplly on the "parameters" bars, I can't see
the visualization. There's no geometry!

Can anybody help me?

I don't do much volume rendering, if that's what you mean, but it seems to work just fine.

As far as Paraview using the hardware correctly, I have no idea. I don't have any evidence that it isn't. I guess if it didn't, it might just be slow, but I don't have a sense of how fast volume rendering should be.

If you are talking about volume rendering of volumes (vtkImageData),
the only available volume renderer is software based. We will add 3D
texture based volume renderer in the future.

In my case, the displacement is a 2d vector in the radial direction (no
displacement along the tube).

I think I figured out a way to do what I want using the Calculator filter.
I am trying to replace the original radial position R with a new radial
position R' in which the displacement from the original radius R0 is
exaggerated by a scaling factor f>1.  Thus, R' = R0 + f*(R-R0).  Of course,
I am actually working in XYZ coordinates with R laying in the YZ plane.  So
one has to do a coordinate transformation of this equation, and I plugged
that into the Calculator filter to compute the new coordinates.  Now I can
see my displacements!

Thank you for all the suggestions and information on using the various
filters.

Renan, first of all you must try to understand which kind of data you have. Is
it a structured or unstructured grid (or something else)? I think that you
could represent the surface of a river by giving a regular grid in XY plane and
a set of elevations (z coordinates) OR, maybe, you might have a triangulated
surface (less probable). After figuring it out, you can pick and learn one of
the several file formats that ParaView supports
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ#What_file_formats_does_ParaView_support.3F)
in order to translate your data accordingly (it's not hard and I'm sure that
you'd be able to do it in less than a week ;o).

I hope it helps you

Renato.

Hi renan,
ParaView does not support .Dat type files written in unknown formats.
See the section  "What 3D file formats can VTK import and export?"
in the following link : http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_FAQ

Most of the formats listed hear are supported in ParaView as well.

To get a more detailed list of file formats supported go to
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html
and look for vtkreaders for different formats.

so either you have to write your data in a standard format or convert it in to a compatible one.

Nvidia has acknowledged this to be a driver bug. They offer the 
following workaround, which works fine for me (with Paraview 3.1):

Works great but unfortunately obj contains the old value, not the one to which the animator has just changed. I think the new value is buried in obj somewhere but cannot discover how to get it.

My workaround: I ignore obj and use the current value from cutPlane.

Suggestions?

Michael,

I read over the thread, and I assume you are referring to the glfinish
patch that adds a glFinish() call in the vtkOpenGLRenderWindow class
method DestroyHardwareOffScreenWindow().  I tried patching my cvs copy
of ParaView-3.3.0 (development) in this manner and recompiling this
code, but it did not seem to help with my problem.  One difference is
that I have a somewhat older Nvidia graphics card (6800 XT) than the
ones discussed in the thread.  I don't know if this matters or not.

Regards, Julian C.

Message-ID: <b05971d10804182247o3776ffdcl875bb49fb6a8c9bb@mail.gmail.com>

*Hi, I would like to clarify some stuff about data server and render server*

* *

* *

*I plan to build paraview using this architecture :*

* *

*Dataserver = 2 node cluster machine, *

*a)      **Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz ? 2GB RAM*

*b)      **Pentium 3 -256MB RAM*

*c) Hard disk*

* *

* *

*Renderserver = Quad Core Intel Xeon machine, 1GB RAM, 80GB hard disk*

* *

*Paraview Client = Intel Pentium Dual Core, 160 GB Hard disk, 2GB RAM*

* *

* *

*a)Umm, is this ok .. or should I reassemble them? any idea..  Cause I have
read that the render server should not consist of more nodes that the
dataserver.. but doesn't the memory matter also?*

* *

*b)I am using OpenMPI, do I need to install any batch scheduling program
..any suggestions.. *

* *

* *

*c) I have a 750,000 points * 53 timesteps to render. And I found this fact
on paraview wiki*

* *

1.         Sort first (collection): Small objects can be collected to the
first node and rendered locally. In this mode, the polygons are collected
only when the source generating them is modified. Although this collection
might take time, it is done only once and rendering is fast.

2.         Sort last (distributed rendering): In this mode, first, each
process renders their scene, then these scenes are composited using the
depth buffer. This is done every render. Although this is slower for smaller
datasets, it is the only scalable solution when the dataset become large

I don't really understand this thing, how does it apply to my data. I think
it falls under the 2nd option because the dataset is large.. but I will be
using only one quad core machine.. mentioned above

* *

* *

*Any help.. Could someone point out to me ..? Thanks*

* *

I visualize a 3d grid with only 1 k-plane (test phase).
Only the grid, in plot3d format. I can see the grid with

Recommendation number 1: 750,000 points is not really that large.  Rather than spend the time establishing a makeshift cluster, just load the data on your beefiest desktop and view it there.  I just created a 800,000 point data set on my laptop and it works reasonably well.

Recommendation number 2: If you insist on using client server, just use a single (multiprocess) pvserver instead of the dual pvrenderserver/pvdataserver.  See the discussion on the Wiki: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#pvserver_vs._pvrenderserver_and_pvdataserver

Subject: [Paraview] Questions about Paraview, renderserver and dataserver

Hi, I would like to clarify some stuff about data server and render server


I plan to build paraview using this architecture :

Dataserver = 2 node cluster machine,
a)      Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz - 2GB RAM
b)      Pentium 3 -256MB RAM
c) Hard disk


Renderserver = Quad Core Intel Xeon machine, 1GB RAM, 80GB hard disk

Paraview Client = Intel Pentium Dual Core, 160 GB Hard disk, 2GB RAM


a)Umm, is this ok .. or should I reassemble them... any idea..  Cause I have read that the render server should not consist of more nodes that the dataserver.. but doesn't the memory matter also?

b)I am using OpenMPI, do I need to install any batch scheduling program ..any suggestions..


c) I have a 750,000 points * 53 timesteps to render. And I found this fact on paraview wiki

1.         Sort first (collection): Small objects can be collected to the first node and rendered locally. In this mode, the polygons are collected only when the source generating them is modified. Although this collection might take time, it is done only once and rendering is fast.
2.         Sort last (distributed rendering): In this mode, first, each process renders their scene, then these scenes are composited using the depth buffer. This is done every render. Although this is slower for smaller datasets, it is the only scalable solution when the dataset become large
I don't really understand this thing, how does it apply to my data. I think it falls under the 2nd option because the dataset is large.. but I will be using only one quad core machine.. mentioned above


Any help.. Could someone point out to me ..? Thanks

I am hacking together a MultiBlock reader  for a quick demo and I was  
wondering if there is something I can put in "RequestInformation()"  
that can then be set into the Pipeline that will enable ParaView to  
show how many "blocks" are in a file, before the User clicks the "OK"  
button in ParaView?

outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::.....(), ....);

Yes. The ExodusII reader does this. Actually, the ExodusII reader
supports several *types* of blocks (element block, face block, edge
block, element set, side set, face set, edge set, node set). The XML
that supports element blocks is in
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml:

     <StringVectorProperty 
        name="ElementBlockArrayInfo"
        information_only="1">
        <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="ElementBlock"/>
     </StringVectorProperty>

     <StringVectorProperty
        name="ElementBlockArrayStatus"
        command="SetElementBlockArrayStatus"
        number_of_elements="2" 
        repeat_command="1"
        number_of_elements_per_command="2"
        element_types="2 0" 
        information_property="ElementBlockArrayInfo">
       <ArraySelectionDomain name="array_list">
          <RequiredProperties>
             <Property name="ElementBlockArrayInfo" function="ArrayList"/>
          </RequiredProperties>
       </ArraySelectionDomain>
     </StringVectorProperty>

which points to these methods from VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusIIReader.h:

  int GetNumberOfElementBlockArrays();
  const char* GetElementBlockArrayName(int index);
  int GetElementBlockArrayStatus(const char* name);
  void SetElementBlockArrayStatus(const char* name, int flag);

There is a Qt panel widget (Qt/Components/pqExodusIIPanel.h) for the
reader that displays the names (and types) of the blocks -- and allows
users to select a subset to be loaded -- before the user presses OK.
This panel is associated to the reader by this class:
Qt/Components/pqObjectInspectorWidget.cxx . I don't know how a plugin
can "suggest" its own panel be used but perhaps someone more familiar
with plugins will chime in.

An auto-generated panel can handle selection of blocks, or provide a read-only 
list of blocks with an information property (there's been a bit of 
improvement since Mike last asked about read-only properties).

The exodus reader GUI has an additional set of requirements that calls for a 
custom panel, which cannot be inferred from the server manager xml.

The wiki has instructions for creating panels in plugins if its necessary.

Subject: [Paraview] Filter to identify boundary regions
Message-ID: <480CE485.1070702@nacad.ufrj.br>

Hi folks,

attached follows a vtk filter, and PV plugin as well, to identify 
boundary regions. It just assigns different region numbers for front 
(region 0), back (region 1), left (region 2), right (region 3), top 
(region 4), bottom (region 5) and body (region 6) faces which can be 
used, associated to the threshold filter, to extract such regions. The 
algorithm is quite simple and employs the normal filter and geometry 
bounds to classify regions. In the other hand, this algorithm can be 
applied only for regular and cubic domains.

As a short description, I posted the following pictures showing a model 
before and after the filter has been applied.

What are users's experiences with the "show cube axes" option in CVS? We
have the cvs of today.

get a default wavelet cube (betwen -10 and 10 for all axes). The cube
axes display two number "10" in the middle of the cube. That does not
seem right. We also have a very hard time moving the labels away from

are there recommended ways to use the cube axes? preferred options?

Subject: [Paraview] Determining reader handle from state file question
Message-ID: <480D0B7F.9010906@nrlssc.navy.mil>

Greetings!

I'm trying to get the hang of Paraview and python scripting, and in 
particular I'm trying to figure out how to write a script that will load 
a state file and create an animation of all the timesteps in the 
referenced data file.

My problem is that in the animation examples I see using 
AnimateReader(), I need to pass it a reader handle, which I do not have 
by default since I loaded from a state file.
 I can get the view with:
 view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
but how do I get the reader when I load from a state file?

Or am I completely missing something?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions anyone would have.

Regards,
Mike

Hi,

sorry to reopen this topic, but I still hope to get some help regarding 
this issue.

What to I need to modify in Paraview 3.x to be able to write out a 
sequence of images. For example, I read a sequnce of .tif files, apply 
some image filter to it and would like to write out the complete image 
sequence not only just one 2d image file. The vtkWriter support this (by 
setting a file prefix and pattern). What about their integration in 
Paraview?

Thanks,

Hi everyone,
I have a question about making some changes of ParaView.Since I have
Installed GPL'ed version of Qt and paraview from the source,
I want to compile Paraview and make some change.But I do not know which part
is NOT permitted to modify. I have read that using
GPL'ed Qt and you cannot have write access to any directory that has code
that depends on Qt. I just want to know that which part is depends on Qt.
I saw some files have the sentance that "WARNING! All changes made in this
file will be lost!".
Does that mean I can no change the code in those files?And the files without
the sentance above can be modified?

Thanks so much!

Kevin

First, let me say that the GPL does not mean you cannot modify the Qt-dependent code.  It simply means that if you do, you have to conform to the GPL, which is different than ParaView's BSD license.  The ParaView Wiki has more details on the subject: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_and_Qt_licensing.

As far as what is covered under the Qt license, that is pretty much everything under the ParaView3/Qt directory and everything that depends on that (ParaView/Applications and a lot in ParaView/Plugins).  There is also some Qt-specific code in VTK that should be easy to identify.

The files that say "WARNING! All changes made in this file will be lost!" are those that are generated by CMake.  It means that CMake will write over it the next time you run cmake or possibly the next time you run make.  If you do an out-of-source build, you shouldn't see any of those in your source code.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about making change of ParaView

Hi everyone,
I have a question about making some changes of ParaView.Since I have Installed GPL'ed version of Qt and paraview from the source,
I want to compile Paraview and make some change.But I do not know which part is NOT permitted to modify. I have read that using
GPL'ed Qt and you cannot have write access to any directory that has code that depends on Qt. I just want to know that which part is depends on Qt.
I saw some files have the sentance that "WARNING! All changes made in this file will be lost!".
Does that mean I can no change the code in those files?And the files without the sentance above can be modified?

Thanks so much!

Kevin

The stream tracer requires both the topology (which you loose when you run Cell Centers) and point data.  Run Cell Data to Point Data on your original data and the stream tracer filter should work fine.

To gather the readers that have been created from the state file can be 
done like this:

pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
sources = pxm.GetProxiesInGroup('sources')

To load a state file from a python you can use the command:

servermanager.LoadState(path)

Enkelejda,

I just updated a plugin in ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/Writer to be able to write out slices of tiff files.  The interface is a little clunky, but it works.

Message-ID: <480E01EA.6090000@sophia.inria.fr>

I use 3.2.1. When I try to slice a mesh with rectangular exterior 
boundaries, I place the slice at the minimum x value for the mesh which 
is -35.000. But the slice fails. I must enter a smaller value like -34.9 
to get a slice.
Any ideas as to what the problem is?

2_is there a better approach to have a slice exactly on the boundary 
(rectangular boundaries) ?

Not sure. By the way, I'm actually using 3.2.1 (3.1 was a typo).

Subject: [Paraview] PvPython: Usage Syntax TransformFilter
Message-ID: <1208953691.8344.37.camel@LEONARDO.localdomain>

Hello,

I'm trying to apply the TransformFilter to a objekt. Here is a example python code



	#!/usr/bin/python
	import sys
	import os
	import math

	sys.path.insert(0 ,"/usr/lib/paraview-3.2/")

	from paraview import servermanager

	if not servermanager.ActiveConnection:
        	connection = servermanager.Connect()

	#objekt
	coneSource = servermanager.sources.ConeSource(Resolution=32)



	#Transformation Filter
	transformedCone = servermanager.filters.TransformFilter(Input=coneSource)

	#--> define some transformation Operations like translation, rotation or scaling
        #


	view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
	rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(transformedCone, view)
	view.StillRender()



Actually I understand that the TransformFilter has the property 'Transform', which
shoud be the right one to assign a translations-, rotation or scaling operation.

>>> transformedCone.ListProperties()
['Input', 'Transform']
>>> transformedCone.GetProperty('Transform')
Property name= Transform value = None

Unfortunately I don't know which kind of value must be assigned to the property 'Transform'.
>From paraview I expect a nine value tuple (three coefficients for every operation). 



I've tried something like :

>>> transformedCone.SetPropertyWithName('translation',[1,0,0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "/usr/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview/servermanager.py", line 162, in SetPropertyWithName
    raise exceptions.RuntimeError, "Property %s does not exist. Please check the property name for typos." % pname
RuntimeError: Property translation does not exist. Please check the property name for typos.

or

>>> transformedCone.SetPropertyWithName('Transform',[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "/usr/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview/servermanager.py", line 163, in SetPropertyWithName
    prop.SetData(arg)
  File "/usr/lib/paraview-3.2/paraview/servermanager.py", line 487, in SetData
    self.SMProperty.AddProxy(value_proxy)
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)


Up to now I don't know how to solve this problem because I am unable to detect the correct syntax via help() or dir()...

That's why I post this problem here, hoping anybody knows how to use a TransformFilter via Python->Servermanager 
and is willing to post the right syntax.

Thanks for your help, Tobias.

Subject: [Paraview] Comparing datasets - taking a difference
Message-ID: <480F3C81.7030205@astr.ucl.ac.be>


Hi there,

It might be trivial but still I have not been able to do it or find 
anything on it. Apologies if this is a dumb question!

I have output from model runs stored in consecutive files, say 
"abc000xxx.vtk" where xxx goes from 001 to 030 (say).

I want to compare two different datasets, i.e. files of the same name 
(and on the same grid and at the same times) in two different folders to 
see what effect some changes in the model had.

I can easily look at them, side by side, but I would like to take (for 
example) the difference between the two datasets for some variable, be 
it over all times or at discrete times, i.e. for individual files.

I've tried using the calculator, but cannot manage to take a difference 
between two variables of the same name but coming from different 
datasets. I tried grouping the two datasets but still I don't see how to 
take that difference.

Any help is greatly appreciated, even if it's just a link to some 
resource that I might have overlooked in my searches.

Chris



PS: Is there a better way to search the mailing list archives than 
clicking on some view on http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/ for 
one month after another and then searching for some keywords in the 
subject line? Or manually downloading all gzip's and grepping those 
locally? The help section on paraview.org hints on it ("search tool 
provided above") but once more I cannot find anything.

1) Use Calculator #0 to rename the variable from dataset #0
2) Use "Append Attributes" to combine the output from 1) and dataset #1
3) Use Calculator #1 with the output from 2) to find the difference

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with cross-compile
Message-ID: <480F5182.3080404@users.sourceforge.net>

I am cross compiling an MPI version of ParaView3 CVS (updated yesterday) 
  for AIX on Power5.  I've successfully built a serial version, but the 
cross compile hits a snag in the cmake/make process.  I'm using CMake 
CVS also updated yesterday.

The problem is that CMake (either CMake itself or the PV cmake scripts) 
are generating incorrect dependencies for the Compile Tools.  I am 
setting -DParaView3CompileTools_DIR to my serial build directory, but 
the path to the executables (e.g., vtkmkg3states) in the */build.make 
files somehow are set to the source directory.

Does that sound familiar?  If that isn't enough information, I can post 
excerpts of the relevant files.

Thanks,
Sean

Well, I was following the cross compiling page at:
http://paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Cross_compiling_ParaView3_and_VTK

But, in looking over the page you sent, it's pretty much the same thing. 
  I do a native build first, then an MPI build (on Cray it would be the 
Catamount build).  I point the "compile tools" to my native build. 
Unfortunately, the paths to the compile tools don't get set to the 
native build.

Thanks,
Sean

That's a good feature request, but it sounds deceptively difficult to implement.  A plugin is encapsulated in a single shared object library, but Assistant expects documentation files.  How can the shared object library reliably point to the documentation files?  Does anyone have any ideas?

Just thinking out load, but it could be possible to hack something 
together into the CMakeLists.txt to copy a couple of HTML files into the 
build/Documentation folder, and hook them into the rest of the 
documentation.

Qt 4.4 has a new QtHelp module, and it looks we might be able to add content 
from plugins.  In that case, the assistant wouldn't be used anymore, and the 
help viewer would be just another window in the application.  That would 
allow for viewing html pages embedded in a plugin and things like that.  Or 
it might be possible to create a wrapper that can dynamically create html 
from server manager xml.

Couldn't we add another macro for Paraview plugins in the CMake files  
where the end programmer specifies the html documentation file(s).  
Kinda like we have to specify the source files and other such items?

That sounds good, Clint.  I'm going to make a bug report and assign it to you.  I'll target it for the 3.6 release since I don't think we can get it in time for the 3.4 release.

Creating html pages for your plugins only takes it half way.  I'd like to see 
a better integration where the sources/filters from your plugins also show up 
in the index and contents.

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython:
Message-ID: <C434D7FF.5414%vgweirs@sandia.gov>


I have a python script to read data from an exodus file, apply CellToPoint, then apply a Clip by scalar. When I run it in the python shell from the GUI, the bubble for "Clip Type" doesn't get populated, and the "Scalars" bubble only lists "DENSITY" as an option. Do I need to register proxies for i_f.Scalar() and the SelectInputScalars to populate the bubbles? What am I missing?

from paraview import servermanager as SM
PM = SM.ProxyManager()
i_f = SM.implicit_functions

(Loading data, cell2point omitted.)

clip = SM.filters.Clip()
clip.Input = cell2point
clip.ClipFunction = i_f.Scalar()
clip.Value = 4.0
clip.SelectInputScalars = ("0", "0", "0", "0", "DENSITY")
if GUIClient:
  PM.RegisterProxy("sources","ClipScalar",clip)

I have a similar problem when I Clip by plane; the plane parameters (normal, origin of plane) don't appear in the Object Inspector, I still see the Scalars bubble and the Value text box.

clip = SM.filters.Clip()
clip.Input = cell2point
clip_plane = i_f.Plane()
clip_plane.Normal = [1.0,1.0,0]
clip_plane.Origin = [-0.1,0,0]
clip.ClipFunction = clip_plane
if GUIClient:
  PM.RegisterProxy("sources","ClipPlane",clip)

Do I have to register clip_plane?

Thanks,
Greg

Okay, I think I found the problem.  My path was set to CMake 2.4 instead
of CVS when I did my native build.  Apparently in such a case, the
compile tools are not exported in the native build for use by the cross
build.  I won't know for sure until I've completely redone my native
build then my cross build (probably tomorrow as AIX xlC take a while).

Thanks,
Sean

Subject: [Paraview] adding existing VTK filter without recompiling
Message-ID: <f8c14e5c0804231952s7135d24csa811c76b596f927a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to add an existing VTK filter to Paraview 3.2.1 for Windows
that I downloaded from Paraview.org. I'm trying to follow the
instructions on the wiki page
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend. That page gives an
example of two XML files that would be needed to make the existing
vtkCellDerivatives filter accessible through the menus.  I followed
the instructions, made the two XML files, and them, as the
instructions suggest:

To load the XML file into the ParaView, we will go to menu File and
select Import Package. This will popup a dialog in which we can select
the appropriate XML file.

Well, I go to the File menu, but there is no Import Package option!!

So, do I really need to build paraview myself in order to add an
existing filter?  Or am I missing something in the instructions??
Sure, I could build a plugin, but that requires building paraview from
source as well.

thanks for the help,
Greg

I would use google starting with:

that would be like restricting google to search in this domain (where the

Thanks a lot for the tip, I wouldn't have figured that out. I had to 
tweak a little, so here what works for me:

1) Use Calculator #0 to rename the variable from dataset #0
    (eg pick just 'h' with result array name 'h0')
2) Use Calculator #1 to rename the variable from dataset #1
    (eg 'h' to 'h1')
3) Use "Append Attributes" while having selected both Calculator #0
    and #1 to combine the output from 1) and 2). AppendAttributes1
    now contains 'h0', 'h1' as well as 'h' (which one?).
4) Use Calculator #2 on AppendAttributes1 to take difference (eg h1-h0).


Without introducing step 2) 'h' was still the one from dataset #0 but 
that might be a Mac version variation. Like this it should always work.

Thanks a lot,

Chris

1.What do pvmain and optins mean?(vtkPVMain* pvmain,
                                                      pqOptions* options)
2.What is the function of "helper" (pqProcessModuleGUIHelper* helper) Does
that helper do some initialization work such as to creat a widget or to
setup the interface of the mainwindow?
3.How does the client-server mode work?What I mean is that what's the method
that conncets cilent and server.Which classes or functions are the key of
that connection ?

Thanks so much!

Message-ID: <E05ABC9A7FBFB942B70D7533AF5BE68D643055@augexmsg001.euro.corp.dir>

I finally found out the root of my problem and have attached a
corresponding patch.

Problem: the VTK EnSight reader had complete garbage when expanding
wildcard names (eg, "scalar per element: k  data/********/k").

Cause: the reader assumed that the filename numbers occur on a single
line and immediately follow the "filename numbers:" introducer and did
not check the sscanf() return value. This can result in very incorrect
values for the filenameNum and/or useless animation values.

Example of a correct syntax (according to ens_checker) that triggers the
problem:

TIME
time set:        1
number of steps: 72
filename numbers:
 40           80           120          160          200          240
 280          320          360          400          440          480
 520          560          600          640          680          720
...

Hi Everyone,

I started to use Paraview to visualize Finite Element results and have a 
very basic question. I am using version 3.2.1 on Ubuntu. I am able to 
read the  FE mesh (which is saved in exodusII format) and display 
triangles and tets. Where is the option to display node numbers and 
their coordinates?

Many thanks in advance,

Doxygen documentation for all of ParaView's classes are posted here:

Look at the documentation for each class to see what it does.

Connections are handled by vtkProcessModule.  Consult the documentation for that.

                                                      pqOptions* options)
2.What is the function of "helper" (pqProcessModuleGUIHelper* helper) Does that helper do some initialization work such as to creat a widget or to setup the interface of the mainwindow?
3.How does the client-server mode work?What I mean is that what's the method that conncets cilent and server.Which classes or functions are the key of that connection ?

Thanks so much!

                                                                                                                                       Shenyanwen

That Wiki page is out of date.  It was written for ParaView 2.X.  ParaView 3 has a new way of adding filters, which unfortunately requires compiling a shared object library.

Ken,

To be more precise, it looks like ParaView 2.6 still allows one to add
the filters by editing/loading XML files, while Paraview 2.9 requires
a recompile.  I went to the website and started downloading old
versions of Paraview. 2.6 is the newest one that had the "Load
Package"  menu option.

thanks,
Greg

You can only display the ids of selected cells. First select some
cells using one of the selection tools. Then go to the Selection
Inspector (View -> Toolbars), Display Style, Cell Label and turn it
on.

Many, many thanks! May I ask one last question? How can I display the 
coordinates of the nodes I selected and the nodes of the elements I 
selected? I just bought the three manuals (for the VTK toolkit, etc) and 
it appears I can probe for this using tcl  , but I am not sure how to do it.

Regards,

Gonzalo

The CPU usage of each instance of pvserver and pvbatch is always 100%. How can I tell how much "real" work is being done by each? Or is there a better way to monitor the load balancing across processes?

Consistently using 100% of the processor is usually the result of the
MPI implementation, so the only way that might be able to separate out
the MPI "spinning" from actual work is using a parallel profiler like
TAU.  But then, I don't know of anyone who's tried to use TAU with
ParaView (not that no one has - I just don't know about it).  I'm sure
it would generate interesting results.

I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve, but a less precise way of
measuring work would be to construct a pipeline with pvbatch that keeps
the processors as busy as possible.

The CVS version of ParaView will allow you to load server manager xml files 
without building plugins.  It also supports loading Client side qrc files to 
add readers and writers without building plugins.

Hi Clint,

that's great, but it still means that I have to face up to building
Paraview in order to use the CVS version, correct?

thanks

I believe the exodus reader can generate "Global Element Ids" and
"Global Node Ids" arrays. You should be able to use those.

Hello Paul,

I've done what you proposed and now I get an error message saying:

"The plugin 'blabla.so' uses incompatible Qt library (4.3.4) [debug]"; It is 
true that I have Qt 4.3.4 installed, but why was I able to compile Paraview 
with it and now plugins for that home-built Paraview using Qt fail to get 
loaded? It seems like there's something I must have misunderstood about 
Paraview's Qt architecture.

Looking forward to hear from you,
Alex

That can happen if the plugin uses Qt3 or if the plugin was built with a 
version of Qt greater than ParaView.
For example, if ParaView was built/using with 4.3.3, and the plugin was 
built with 4.3.4, it won't work.
If you say you built it all with Qt 4.3.4, then perhaps you built 
without rpaths and/or something about your library paths caused ParaView 
to pick up an older version at run time.  Perhaps you can check that 
with ldd or the /proc/<pid>/maps file while its running.

I wonder, would the ability to load server manager XML and client QRC 
files at run time allow me to distribute, e.g., a specific python 
script, to others and it show up as a unique reader/filter/writer with 
its own GUI widgets?

That would be more elegant and less tedious than the current way of 
doing things, in which I just tell them "paste the following script into 
the Programmable Filter and modify the parameters inside the script as 
needed."

Thanks,
Sean

Although I haven't tried it, it should now work the way you want it to.

Have you tried created a custom filter containing the programmable filter with your script?  Once it is a custom filter you can export that to XML and let other users import it.

Yes, that takes care of part of it.  However, it's not clear to me if or 
how one might add extra parameters for the script, so that the script 
itself doesn't need to be edited for simple parameters.  Is that possible?

Perhaps you'd like the new example in ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/HelixSource.
See the attached screen shot.  The panel for the HelixSource has a python 
script under it.  And it didn't require compiling any plugins.

That looks exactly like what I need.  I just did a cvs update in my 
ParaView3 working copy, but I don't see HelixSource.  Is it in another 
cvs branch?

Its in the cvs head.  Perhaps you need to do "cvs up -d" to get new 
directories?

While the images I get out of paraview are fine, is there a way to set  
the size of the outputted image?  Like if I want to display it in a  
publication in a smaller size than the default?

Message-ID: <FF7FF04E-AA5D-4F58-83FF-192AE3C328C2@gmail.com>

Hi all


I tried to get ffmpeg to compile the way as described in http://www.vtk.org/files/support/ffmpeg_source.tar.gz 
  for use in ParaView 3.3.0 CVS. But the instructions are quite stale  
and the included source does not compile on intel macs. So I pulled  
the current HEAD from ffmpeg subversion repository, but found it to be  
in a state which doesn't compile. I then extracted the tar.gz provided  
by fink (versioned ffmpeg-0.4.20071217) which compiles cleanly.  
However, there seems to be a change in the API which required me to  
remove the & in the expression url_fclose(&this->avFormatContext->pb)  
of the file VTK/IO/vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx.

Things compiled now, but whenever I try to export a movie, ffmpeg  
reports on the command line that "[msmpeg4 @ 0x581c810]bitrate  
tolerance too small for bitrate" and ParaView tells me that  
"vtkFFMPEGWriter (0x1ce649b0): Error initializing video stream."

Ok, but in binary distribution of ParaView-3.2.1 things work, so I  
tried to figure out which version of ffmpeg has been used for the  
creation of that particular binary. I figured out that the ffmpeg  
revision used must be in the range 6350-6639, because otherwise the  
library versions don't match. But which of these 290 revisions? I  
tried some, namely 6350 and 6639, but both do not compile properly.  
For the latter I had to hack the configure script to create a valid  
config.mak and the common.mak I had to change in order to prevent the  
thing trying to link libavutil against itself (quite idiotic...).  
Finally things failed when the assembler choked on non-relocatable  
assembly code in libavcodec/cabac.h. Configuring ffmpeg to create  
static libraries however worked. But then linking libvtkIO requires  
the "-read_only_relocs suppress" flag to be set (which I'm not quite  
sure about what it does)...

At that point compiling succeeded, and I could even create an avi  
movie. However, the output is just black.

I hope that someone from the developer team can shed some light on how  
to get ffmepg working with paraview on Mac OS X.

The cvs version of ParaView allows you to specify size both for
screenshots and animations. I will have binary snapshots for Windows,
Linux and OS X (intel) soon. Maybe next week...

Here if what I used to build ffmpeg:

Sorry for that empty mail. I have no idea how THAT happened ;-)

Thanks for the help, compiling now works better but the output is  
still just plain black. Might it be an issue that I try to compile a  
universal binary? For the ffmpeg I compile both first as either i368  
and ppc and then "lipo" them. Or might it be the fact that I'm using  
Leopard?

Found the problem! It wasn't with ffmpeg, but the offscreen rendering.  
I remembered reading a post to this list about someone getting black  
screenshots, so I figured I'd give it a try: and voil?, it worked!

I couldn't find a bug-report related to this in mantis, but am not  
sure I used the correct search terms. Is this a known issue or should  
I create a new entry?

Subject: [Paraview] how to connect the VTK classes to theParaView
Message-ID: <5c6a845d0804280329r458485c5gd07656bf7ef63658@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.
I have a question about the ParaView.
When I debug the ParaView with source, I just want to know
how does ParaView connect vtk class for the purpose of showing or rendering
the vtk files.
Does it connect the dll or lib files in the directory in which ParaView was
installed?How does it achieve this?

Thanks so much

Kevin

Message-ID: <30e259200804280536m7f1c6492sdef0d33852677ccd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have been struggling for some time with parsing data from my C scripts to
VTK format that can be read by Paraview with no success.  I am running an
FTDT code that I wrote and as an output I produce matrices of float values
that I want to image. This matrices can be larger then 1024x1024 for 2D
case. I use uniform staggered grids, so I assumed that I have unstructured
scalar field that I want to pass to Paraview.

I was reading some threads from 2006 but I have not been able to figure out
right procedure to this. My programing experience is limited and I code
everything in C.  Does anyone have some scripts that I can use for my
problem or can anyone point me to some step by step explanation how to set
this up.

Thanks,

Marko Orescanin

You have uniform grid size. So what about using the binary .vti file for
instance as follow:

I have number of grid points: nx,ny
Coordinates of origin: ox,oy
Grid spacing: dx, dy
Scalar variable: treal[nx*ny]

nvar=1; /* Plot only one variable set */
off[0]=0;
for (i=0; i<nvar; i++){
 bytes[i]=(nx*ny)*sizeof(float);
 if(i<nvar-1)off[i+1]=off[i]+sizeof(int)+bytes[i];
 bytes[i]=bytes[i]+sizeof(int);
}

outf_tfield=fopen("arrival_time_field.vti","w");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<VTKFile type=\"ImageData\" version=\"0.1\"
byte_order=\"LittleEndian\">\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<ImageData WholeExtent=\"%d %d %d %d %d %d\"
Origin=\"%f %f %f\" Spacing=\"%f %f %f\">\n",0,nx-1,0,ny-1,0,0
   ,ox,oy,0.
   ,dx,dy,0.);
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<Piece Extent=\"%d %d %d %d %d
%d\">\n",0,nx-1,0,ny-1,0,0);
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<PointData Scalars=\"Arrival time (s)\">\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<DataArray type=\"Float32\" Name=\"Arrival time (s)\"
format=\"appended\" offset=\"%d\" />\n",off[0]);
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"</PointData>\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<CellData>\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"</CellData>\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"</Piece>\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"</ImageData>\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"<AppendedData encoding=\"raw\">\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"_");
  /* Write arrival time field */
  fwrite(&bytes[0],sizeof(int),1,outf_tfield);
  for(i=0; i<nx*ny; i++){
    fwrite(&treal[i],sizeof(float),1,outf_tfield);
  }
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"</AppendedData>\n");
  fprintf(outf_tfield,"</VTKFile>\n");
  fclose(outf_tfield);

Good luck!

This is a known issue that, unfortunately, we can't fix. Some drivers
have buggy implementations and we can't get around that. It will be a
FAQ/wiki entry once we clean up the ParaView wiki. Having said that,
ParaView should not use offscreen rendering on OS X. Please report a
bug about that here http://paraview.org/Bug.

Hi folks,

We made a slight change in the build process. The HTML is no longer
generated by default. There is a separate target called Documentation
you have to build to get the documentations with something like
> make Documentation

This is to avoid compile issues when the environment is not setup to
reach all shared libraries. We will probably go back to building
documentation as part of the default target when we move to Qt 4.4.

Hi
there is a Glyph filter in paraview, you can chose arrow for visulization. Hope it is helpful

Hi yuhl,

Thank you so much for your reply.

Actually I already tried Glyph, however I cannot change the
orientation of arrow.  All arrows are shown parallel with the
x-direction.  Once again, I'm gonna display the scalar data.  Do you
know how I can change the orientation?

Thanks

Hi
I am not sure about this point. You might need create vectors for your data to apply glyph, I guess.

Hi yuhl,

Thank you so much for your reply.

Actually I already tried Glyph, however I cannot change the
orientation of arrow.  All arrows are shown parallel with the
x-direction.  Once again, I'm gonna display the scalar data.  Do you
know how I can change the orientation?

Thanks

Message-ID: <b05971d10804290201h548f5ca1u1a1c5a35060716ea@mail.gmail.com>

hi everyone

I have a theory question to ask. Just would like to clarify some thing

a) The difference between rendering and visualization,
b) the difference between parallel rendering and visualization
i have come across many papers on parallel rendering and also visualization,
and they all use Paraview, but what exactly is the difference...,some are
titled Parallel Visualization
whereas some are titled Parallel Rendering, but they are all about the
same..( Hope someone could explain )

Can i say that rendering is part of a visualization pipeline..? And parallel
rendering could mean.. parallel processing - different processors involved
in the rendering phase ... what would then parallel visualization be ..?

Rendering: the process of creating the visual representation of some  
data (e.g. for display on a screen). This often includes triangulation  
of the data, calculation of the lighting, etc. It is just about "how  
does it look".

Visualization: processing of raw data with the goal of making it  
"visible"/understandable in a visual (rendered) reperesentation. This  
usually includes as the last step rendering, but usually involves many  
more steps, such as computing derived quantities, extraction of  
profiles, iso-surfaces, etc.

Parallel rendering: rendering can be very expensive in computational  
terms. One reason can be the sheer number of triangles involved. Or if  
you have translucent media with non-homogeneous refraction index. So  
one might want to distribute the work to multiple processing units.  
I'm by no means an expert here, but I think this usually involves  
having several graphics chips (i.e. graphics cards) work in parallel.

Parallel visualization: not only rendering is expensive, but also the  
data processing before the actual rendering step. So of course one  
might want to distribute the load, using e.g. a computer cluster,  
multiple CPUs or one or multiple multi-core CPU(s).


I hope this helps (and is at least passingly accurate).

Message-ID: <48170F9F.1090603@sophia.inria.fr>

I am running v 3.0.2 64-bits on the server installed by the sysops.

On my workstation I downloaded 3.0.2 32 bits. Could that cause the 
following error?
If so is there a 64-bit that can be downloaded?

The *vtu data seems to be reading correctly and the error comes after 
the read is complete (I believe).

It is hard to say without more information. It sounds like the server
is crashing but I am not sure this is because of the 32 bit client. 64
bit server/32 bit client should work as long they were both built with
the same VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS. Can you open this file in the stand-alone
mode? Can you attach to the server with a debugger to get a stack
trace?

You may also consider upgrading to 3.2.1.  As Berk mentioned, there was a
bug in 3.0 that caused problems when connecting client to server with
mismatch of the VTK_USE_64BITA_IDS.  That is fixed in the latest release.

I am writing a custom reader for a client that needs to display an XY Plot for a given time step.  I am reading in their data from a text file and outputting a vtkRectilinearGrid data object.  I am currently having two issues.  

The first issue is that I can not get the plot to use the correct array as the X coordinates.  The data has three arrays, stress, strain, and time.  I want to plot stress versus strain.  Setting the time array as the X Coordinate uses the time values as my x axis, but setting any other array as the X coordinate results in the Y axis array's index being used.  

The second issue is that the range of the axes change based off of the range of the data that is currently loaded.  I would like the range on the axes to stay constant for every time step.  The effect they want is one of the plot being drawn as the time step changes.  With the range changing every step the results look confusing.  Is there any way to change this behavior?

Any help that can be offered will be greatly appreciated.  I am including a code snippet below from the RequestData method of my class showing the code that creates, fills, and uses the arrays.

Thank you,
Herb

Are you using the Plot-Over-Time filter? For the second issue, you can right-click in the Plot-Over-Time view and select Properties in the menu that pops up. This should give you a window, and then you can find the axis you want, then click Layout and it will let you pick the axis scale behavior.

This feature (getting to the properties window) is very well hidden.

Hope this helps-
Greg

I looked at the plot point over time filter, but I am not sure that actually gives me what I want.  Won't this plot the values of a particular point in my array over time?  Also, it gives me a plot with time as the X axis.  

I can change the properties to make my graph have the proper axes by manually changing the properties, but to do what our client wants I have to be able to do it with code.  The data I am graphing is actually related to a three dimensional structure that they will be viewing.  The output of my reader will ultimately be one output of a multiple output reader.  They want to be able to have a graph that comes up when they open their other data set and animates as they step through the time steps of their data.  They will not be happy with the results if they have to manually adjust chart properties every time they open a data set.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Herb

Are you using the Plot-Over-Time filter? For the second issue, you can right-click in the Plot-Over-Time view and select Properties in the menu that pops up. This should give you a window, and then you can find the axis you want, then click Layout and it will let you pick the axis scale behavior.

This feature (getting to the properties window) is very well hidden.

Hope this helps-
Greg

I just tried to build the latest CVS as of early this afternoon on
Visual Studio 2005 Pro (Win XP SP2) and I get the following error:

09>------ Build started: Project: pqComponents, Configuration: Release

It seems there is a file missing or not named correctly?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaVIEW VTK to Blender Python Script Error
Message-ID: <web-5600930@mirarco.org>

Hello,

The goal is to be able to make Blender work with VTK data which 
afterwards the data can be used in ParaVIEW once again.

Right now I am trying to resolve the vtk.vtkLineSource() error.
It seems that the VTK which Paraview uses doesn't have the 
vtkLineSource in the vtk. I am trying to see where it could be 
located. All I know is that Paraview does use the vtkLineSource.
I haven't had much luck finding any lead...

Thank you in advance.

The following is more information on the procedure that I took :

Refering to the post at http://www.blender.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5868
Problem is as followed...
#
Refering to the Python Script to create an link between Blender and the VTK file set using Python, I have encountered some problems. 

The purpose of using Blender with the VTK file set is to be able to use designed work in Blender to be able to use them in Kitware Paraview also vis-versa.

I have encountered a problem when attempting to Run the Python script vtk_to_blender.py

WindowsXP Pro
Blender 245
Paraview 3.3.0
Python 2.5

Because the Python Script in Blender couldn't find the VTK Library, I Ran the following line:

##############
import sys
sys.path.append('D:\ParaViewRelease1659VS8Qt434\\U tilities\\VTKPythonWrapping\\paraview')
sys.path.append('D:\\ParaViewRelease1659VS8Qt434\\ bin\\release')
sys.path.append('D:\\ParaViewRelease1659VS8Qt434\\ Utilities\\VTKBlender')
##############

The problem occured on line 164 from the "vtk_to_blender.py" script
Error message as shown in the console:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "vtk_to_blender.py" line 164, in (module)
File "vtk_to_blender.py" line 23, in main
File "vtk_to_blender.py" line 124, in GetExtrudedline
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'vtkLineSource'
 

I have emailled the UofA regarding this and this is what I had in return.

Quote:
I suspect you need to
find the paraview directory that has the vtk Libraries in it and
add it to your PYTHONPATH with the sys.path.append() call.
I think the particular library with the vtkLineSource is
vtkGraphics.dll on windows.

On my coworkers window machines, the vtk dll's are found
in C:\Program Files\Paraview\bin, so maybe add the following
line:

sys.path.append('D:\\ParaViewRelease1659VS8Qt434\\ bin') 

After recieving this, the path "'D:\\ParaViewRelease1659VS8Qt434\\bin\\releas e'" does contain the vtkGraphics.dll and other Libraries. 

If the problem could be a missing library file, the following is what contains in that path.

The Following is the content of the "release" directory.

What is, in fact, the orientation you want? To change is you should have 
some vector data attached. On way of doing it in paraview is to use 
calculator to create the vectors and then use your data and this vectors 
for changing the glyphs orientation.

Subject: [Paraview] String block labels stripped by Extract Block?
Message-ID: <20080430.125124.209655472.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I'm so happy to see the string block labeling feature has been finally
added to the CVS head!

However I found a problem when I ran the Extract Block filter to a
vtkMultiBlockDataSet which has the block structure as shown by the
attached picture1.png (the Properties panel of the Extract Block
filter). In this case I expect to see the labels for the selected
blocks "roofEndWeb" and "internalField" after running the filter, but
in reality what I got was "roofEndWeb" and "1: Unstructured Grid" as
shown by picture2.png (the Information panel of the same filter). The
problem occurrs only when Prune Output is turned on.

My guess is that the line 232 of vtkExtractBlock.cxx

            clone->GetMetaData(index)->Copy(prunedBlock->GetMetaData(cc));

should be

            clone->GetMetaData(index)->Copy(prunedBlock->GetMetaData(static_cast
<unsigned int>(0)));

? (this worked for the case, but I'm not so sure.)

Takuya

Thanks Takuya. The bug has been fixed on the CVS head.

Subject: [Paraview] Average Calculation on Slice from Ensight Data
Message-ID: <20080430143304.68820@gmx.net>

Hi all 

I am relatively new to CFD postprocessing and use Paraview as the main tool to visualize CFD data (generated by Fluent). The results were exported from Fluent in the EnsightGold format. Reading this data into Paraview is easy and robust. 

I wanted to calculate the average / mean value of a slice. To display the data of this slice is no problem at all (e.g. temperature distribution). I want to determine the average temperature on that slice (or the median), and the standard distribution. The median filter is shaded in grey and not selectable, however. Is there any way how to calculate the average in a simle way? 

When I used the Integrator to integrate all temperature values, and divided manually by the number of cells or points, no sensible result was yielded. 

Is it also possible to export the temperature values of that slice in an easy way to Matlab or Excel? 

I am grateful for any help. Thanks!! Maurice

I think you should be able to warp in following steps:

1. Filters -> Alphabetical -> Tetrahedralize
2. Filters -> Alphabetical -> Warp (scalar)

Good luck!

Message-ID: <4818A6D5.8050901@inrialpes.fr>

Hi all,

I'm writing a c++ filter and I'd like to access to the current color 
transfert function (if it's defined of course). How can I manage that 
within my filter ? (Can I directly access to an object of type 
vtkColorTransfertFunction ?)

Thanks,

Thomas.

If you divide the integrated value by the area/volume, it should give
you the average. The area/volume should be in the output of the
Integrate Variable filter.
There is no writer for unstructured data that can be used to write
something Matlab or Excel would read. However, you can write your
field data using the python filter very easily. Here is an example
that prints an array to the output:

inp = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
array = inp.GetPointData().GetArray("RTData")
for i in range(array.GetNumberOfTuples()):
	print array.GetTuple1(i)
