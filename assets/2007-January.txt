I'm pretty sure the current use of this feature at Sandia is zero.  All of our distributions of ParaView use either a hardware driver or straight Mesa, not both.  As several other members of these lists have just testified, it's much easier.
 
Concerning the maintenance overhead of maintaining the mangled Mesa stuff, I would rather have someone from Kitware speak to that since they are really the ones doing that.  I recall Berk grumbling about it in the past.  Perhaps he can elaborate.
 
I also cannot speak for any other organizations that may be using VTK/ParaView.  If any of you out there use the vtkMesa* classes or otherwise compile with the mangled Mesa features, now would be a really good time to chime in.

The original purpose of the mangled mesa extension was a heterogeneous
configuration with hardware acceleration and OS rendering at the same
time. It was a long time ago, so I've forgotten the exact configuration. I
know SGI pipes were part of the mix. This was in the parallel VTK days;
ParaView did not exist, therefore no client/server architecture etc...

One application is rendering extremely large offscreen imagery using
mangled Mesa (limited by memory)  and hardware accelerated rendering
smaller imagery for onscreen interactive use. This requires both libraries
in the same executable.

Brian, what is the maintainence issue? What is the current cost etc.?

I haven't looked at/used mangled mesa in a while. I used to enable it
on all my builds for testing but eventually gave it up. As Brian
mentioned, having a separate mesa build is more practical. There are
two maintenance issues with mangled mesa: 1. mangling support in the
mesa library itself, 2. mangled mesa support in VTK. (2) is not too
much of a burden although as Randall found out, it is not being tested
(therefore it may be considered broken). (1) is more of a problem
since Mesa folks are not really interested in it and do not test
mangled mesa. The last time I tried, the latest mesa could not be
built mangled. I think there are some users of mangled mesa out there
but I am not sure how many. Jeff Lee may be one of them.

Unfortunately, you can't. pvd files cannot point to legacy VTK files.
They can only point to the new xml based files (in this case .vts or
.pvts). You could write a VTK or paraview script to convert all your
vtk files to vts files. If you need help with that, let me know.

In-Reply-To: <4596047F.18A0EE.13833>
Message-ID: <C1BFD532.4BA0%kmorel@sandia.gov>

In the past, we played a lot with the use of vertex arrays (and with the
more recent vertex buffer objects).  We found that they could sometimes
speed up rendering only in certain specific cases (namely that the polygon
data only has "point" data, not "cell" data).  Furthermore, to really get
good efficiency, you often had to copy data into new arrays with a slightly
different structure.

We have looked a lot at the rendering performance with recent versions of
VTK and nVidia drivers, and have found that building a display list is
almost always at least as fast, and usually faster, than trying to use
vertex arrays + vertex buffer objects.  You can enable the use of display
lists by unchecking the "Use immediate mode rendering" box under "3D View
Properties" -> "General" (it's shown when ParaView first starts up).

ParaView lets you choose immediate mode rendering or display lists, or
display lists with triangles strips.

Go to "View... 3D View properties.." 

And turn "Use triangle strips" to ON and "Use immediate mode rendering"
to OFF and then capture the stream.

The trunk of the ParaView repository is currently dead as we move to ParaView 3 (which has a significantly different directory structure).  It does not compile for anyone (although I don't know if it is that particular issue).  Try checking out the ParaView 2.6 branch (tagged ParaView-2-6) and try again.

Well, what I've done now was to checkout the Paraview III and try the

Any thougths? I'm using the mesa stuff that comes with debian, should I 
get it and compile it myself? What opengl library are you using, mesa? my

Ricardo,

Can you explain again what the problem is?  I just checked the output from one of our Mesa builds, and we get the same output you describe below.  It is a check to set the VTK_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS CMake variable.

That variable controls whether vtkOpenGLExtensionManager must declare glXGetProcAddressARB before using it.  Even when this test fails, glXGetProcAddressARB is still used.

described in my posting "2.4 CVS / vtkOpenGLPainterDeviceAdapter error" 
was fixed (according to a bug fix filed against the relevant source 
files, BUG# 3454).

Now on the other hand I am not able to use the module vtkCellDerivatives 
added via pvsm/xml!

I receive an error message very similar to what John Biddiscombe 
described in his posting "another error message using custom reader", I get:

# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: 
/home/crippa/tmp/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx (966)
  vtkProcessModule (0x535b90): Object type: vtkCellDerivatives, could 
not find requested method: "SetInput"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
   Argument 0 = id_value {640}
   Argument 1 = string_value {SetInput}
   Argument 2 = id_value {498}
ErrorMessage end


To me it doesn't seem as if Berk's answer to JB explains also this 
error, as JB's error seemed to me to be related to AMR datasets.

Am I wrong here, or is this an additional bug in vtkProcessModule?


Thanks, Simone

Make sure you use SetInputConnection in the xml and not SetInput. The 
xml stuff was converted some time back to only use the new style 
pipeline connections

try replacing 'SetInput" by "SetInputConnection"

Yep, that was it ... SetInputConnection instead of SetInput.

Thanks for the help Jean&JB

I've redone everything... It was my fault. I'm building against the Open 
MPI implementation and they've got something wrong with their install scripts. 
A wrong path to the mpi_cxx.h is given in the mpi.h file. After correcting 
that all compiled ok. I was set of track because I'm compiling with
make -j 4 to speed things up and the error message gets buried in the 
process.

Right now it has compiled paraview 3 from the cvs OK. When trying to run 
it I get:

2007.01.03 11:17:42
rreis@umdrum: /usr/local/share/paraview3/bin
5001.0 $ ./paraview_alpha
./paraview_alpha: error while loading shared libraries: 
libpqComponents.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or 
directory


I've included the path to the library in the ld.so.conf and made ldconfig 
to no avail. any ideas?

  all the best,

I think that's part of the point here, you can do this without Mangling,
just using standard OSMesa.  Am I Wrong?

Thanks,
I followed your suggestion and now my pvd file works!

I first converted my VTK legacy file to a vts file using Prabhu's python
script:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/~prabhu/software/code/mayavi/vtk2xml.py

Then I was able to link all my new vts files using a single pvd file...


Cheers,
Bruno

Hmmm. It looks like some installation target is wrong. Is
CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH set in your cmake configuration? What happens if you
run from the build directory?

I think it matters to some. Mesa libGL built from mesa-6.4.2 can not be
built with hardware acceleration and produce a libosmesa. The Fedora
Core 5 mesa.spec really whines about this, but libosmesa seems to be
back in FC6 which uses mesa-6.5.1.

Hi Folks,

I don't think I've seen anybody on the list say "we use this", so I wanted to 
step up to Ken Moreland's "call for relevancy" from yesterday.

Our fundamental problem is having a single binary that sometimes runs with 
Mesa and sometimes runs with GL.

Here's why:
- I compile a binary called VisIt (http://www.llnl.gov/visit) and install it 
onto a shared file system.
- VisIt's parallel server is executed on different parallel machines from this 
single shared file system.
- Some machines have graphics cards and an X-server (obviously, for these, we 
do not use mangled Mesa)
- Some machines have no graphics cards.  Worse, if memory recalls, they don't 
even have an X-server and they don't have a libGL.so that points to Mesa.  
So, for these, we use Mangled Mesa.


An alternative may be to have a script that sets up an LD_LIBRARY_PATH to put 
a non-mangled Mesa in the path for the machines without X, but we opted for 
using the built in VTK Mangled Mesa support.  

It has been a long time since we investigated this, but I also seem to 
remember that the mangled mesa path did a better job of not touching the 
X-server.  Knowing that the mangled Mesa types of the rendering modules are 
essentially the OpenGL ones with some #defines, this doesn't add up to me, 
but maybe Charles Law or Berk remembers something about this that I don't.  
(As I recall, we exchanged a lot of e-mails about this about five years ago, 
so everyone's memory may be fuzzy.) 

Berk commented that the VTK support wasn't the hard thing, it was getting 
recent versions of Mesa to build mangled.  We froze the version of Mesa that 
we use, so that hasn't been an issue for us.  But we plan on updating in the 
next six months or so, so this may be an upcoming issue for us...

pvbatch 2.4.4 with non-mangled Mesa requires a connection to an X server even though the server does not seem to be used. I think there are one or two bug reports about this but I could only find #1966. We must run xvfb before starting pvbatch to work
around the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Gold reader "new line" error
Message-ID: <459CEB9B.5080605@kth.se>

Hi,

when trying to read Ensight Gold "case" files with PV I receive error 
messages when a "new line" is encountered ... or better, 
vtkEnSightReader complains about the next line missing a section title:


Here's part of the output:

  There was a VTK Error in file: 
/home/crippa/tmp/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkEnSightReader.cxx (987)
  vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader (0x1e7d1e0): invalid VARIABLE line: 
46986.01 46986.01 46986.01 46986.01


When reading this case file:

FORMAT
type: ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model: case15_remeshed_2494_2610.geo

VARIABLE
constant per case:   1  Pressure     46986.01
  46986.01 46986.01 46986.01 46986.01
  46986.01 46986.01 46986.01 46986.01
[...]


I reformatted the case file to feature only one line per section title, 
and then the reader works.

This is OK until (I think) the 79 character limit is hit, as per 
"EnSight Gold Case File Format" specifications:


EnSight Gold Case File Format
      The Case file is an ASCII free format
      [...]
      Notes:  All lines in the Case file are limited to 79 characters.


Then, the "reformatting-into-one-line-per-section-title" hack doesn't 
work anymore.

Any clue as to why vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader doesn't like new lines?


Regards, Simone

I have a stack of images, Each image is 700x700 pixels and there are  
227 images in total. I used ITK to convert the gray scale images to a  
vtk StructuredGrid file using 8bit chars as the pixel type. Paraview  
can load the file with out a problem but when I try to use the "Clip"  
toolbar button paraview starts chewing up memory until there is no  
more and just crashes. I can use the "Cut" toolbar button and be just  
fine.

So I did some math and there are 111,230,000 pixels at 1 byte each.  
So that is roughly about 111MB to store the entire volume. If I Clip  
say half that volume wouldn't I just need an additional 50~60MB of  
memory to store the new dataset?

If someone could maybe enlighten me on what might be going on I would  
really appreciate the knowledge gained.


This is on a 2GB Ram MacBook Pro running OS X 10.4.8.

thanks

Kent is right. Clip generates an unstructured grid and it would
significantly increase the memory usage due to the creation of
explicit geometry (cells and points). Unfortunately, there is no way
of "clipping" an image to produce another image in VTK. Depending on
what you are trying to accomplish, a combination of clipping the
surface (generated with extract surface) and cutting may be what you
want.

Thanks for the hint. I am now using an ExtractVOI to look at the sub  
volumes that I want. The only downside to this is that I can not look  
at "off angles". I can only compare the orthogonal axis.. which may  
be fine for now but at least I can now bring in my meshed surface and  
do a comparison of how well the mesh conformed to the original images.

On a related note. I have a 16 node AMD64 Linux Cluster at my  
disposal. Sadly it is just acting as a CVS server at the moment..  
what a waste. Each node has 2GB of RAM. How involved is it getting  
Paraview running so that I can distribute the rendering to all the  
nodes? And would this help me out in this situation?

Thanks.

I have ParaView running on a very similar system - a 10 node AMD64.
You'll have to make sure that some form of MPI is installed and running
correctly, which may or may not be your greatest challenge.  However,
once MPI is ready, getting ParaView going wasn't too bad for me.  I
simply recompiled it with MPI enabled in cmake and all the paths set to
point at the MPI libraries.

Subject: [Paraview] Undefined glXGetProcAddressARB
Message-ID: <3D593950239A6D6CB0221DE4@harpo.psc.edu>

The compile of file VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx fails at line 195 because glXGetProcAddressARB is undefined. A search of CMakeCache.txt for "PROC_ADDRESS" finds

======
VTK_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS:INTERNAL=TRUE

//Already set VTK_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS

VTK_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS_TESTED:INTERNAL=1

VTK_USE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB:INTERNAL=1
======

The top of the cxx file mentioned above includes

======
#ifdef VTK_DEFINE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_PROTOTYPE
extern "C" vtkglX::__GLXextFuncPtr glXGetProcAddressARB(const GLubyte *);
#endif //VTK_DEFINE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_PROTOTYPE
======

and, later, line 195 is inside another ifdef:

======
#ifdef VTK_USE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB
  return glXGetProcAddressARB((const GLubyte *)fname);
#endif //VTK_USE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB
======

Therefore it looks like cmake set VTK_USE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB but not VTK_DEFINE_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_PROTOTYPE. A few details:

ParaView 2.4.4
Mesa 6.5.2
Pentium 4
gcc 4.1.1
Linux Fedora Core 5

The Mesa includes and libraries include glXGetProcAddressARB.

I could of course change the VTK source code to always define that routine but would like to instead coax cmake to do the right thing. TIA!

Subject: [Paraview] Using my own filter as plugin
Message-ID: <45A0D5A1.2070700@orxonox.net>


hi paraview-wizards,

I'm currently implementing my own filter (vtkAlgorithm) as an external 
module (paraview plugin). For testing purposes, I just copied the source 
of the standard vtkPVGlyphFilter (you can also select this filter from 
the Filter menu as "Glyph"). I also copied it's client/server xml data 
for the interface.

How can I now use this filter in paraview?

When I specify a source and load my module ('Import Package") my filter 
is added to the "Selection Window" but drawn gray (somehow looing 
inactive). The filter is not applied to the source. If I right-click on 
my filter in the "Selection Window" to see the context menu paraview 
fails with a segfault.

What confuses me is that the module is a 1:1 copy of the paraview module 
compiled as shared lib (module) and that I'm not able to import and use 
it in paraview.

Did I do something completely wrong?

Thanks for your guidance.
Patrick

I have just had a brief look at ParaView3 (It is NICE!!!).

Is is possible to incorporate vtkParticleReader into the list of readers for
the next alpha release? If not how can I do it myself? In the earlier
versions of ParaView you could write an XML interface.

Will Delaunay3D also be added as a filter?


Finally ... how can I add in sources like the vtkParametricBoy where you
need to access parameters in vtkParametricFunction and also
vtkParametricFunctionSource in order to build it. I haven't been able to
easily do this in the older versions either - the restriction was that you
could have only one object in the interface construction for ParaView.

I'm going to check in a couple of fixes to the Ensight readers.

The first is one I have been sitting on for a long time and was first 
mentioned on this list here(ish)
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtk-developers/2006-April/004161.html
When reading vertex (particle data) from Ensight files, Paraview uses a 
1 based index offset for the ID's instead of 0 based and this causes 
trouble ( a spurious coordinate is created with uninitialized x,y,z). 
Because the fix could conceivably alter other vertex reads, I added an 
optional flag SetParticleCoordinatesByIndex so that the old behaviour is 
the default and the new is set manually.

Ensight Binary Gold reader cannot read files written by fortran code 
because it does not take into account the extra bytes before and after 
each array or data item holding the length. I've added a small fix which 
allows fortran written files to be read.

If anyone has troubles with these fixes, please get get back to me

Kent,

As you have probably already have guessed, the CMake files do their best
to test whether the prototype for glXGetProcAddressARB exists in the
OpenGL header files.  It does a TRY_COMPILE to see if
glXGetProcAddressARB can be used without declaring a prototype, and the
result is stored in VTK_GLX_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_ARB_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS.  The
quick and dirty solution is to simply set the value of that variable in
your CMakeCache.txt file to FALSE.

For the test to be wrong in the first place, there must be some
disconnect between the header files used during the test and the header
files used when compiling vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.  We have done a lot
of work to ensure that the two are the same, but it is impossible to
guarantee that and every once in a while a system comes along that
breaks.  Assuming that you have done the obvious "make sure you are
doing a clean build," there must be some difference in the include
directories, order of the include directories, or definitions used
between the test and actual compile that is making your build fail.

The CMake code that performs the test is in
ParaView/VTK/Rendering/CMakeLists.txt starting at about line 287.  If
you are feeling adventurous, you can look at the compile environment for
the test and compare them to the build of vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.

Its not as clean as it could be. I'm trying to build ParaView with Mesa and had thought I had hidden the real OpenGL things. I'll hide real OpenGL better, start clean and try again.

So as a general comment, the "hiding" of opengl is always a pain in the
rear. At Sandia we compile the mesa library so that the library name
actually reflects the fact that's it's a Mesa based library (instead of
having the library have the same name as the opengl library), this also
helps run time load issues....

  .1 from the build directory it works

  So I wen't to the CMakeCache.txt and set

//Whether to build with rpath.
CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH:INTERNAL=1

  and also made a grep for SKIP and changed everything where it showed up 
to TRUE or 1. to no avail. next try is to build directly in the install 
directory.

Subject: [Paraview] filter needs camera position
Message-ID: <45A2C656.3030300@orxonox.net>


Hi paraviewers!

Is there a possibility to get a measure of the camera zoom/position for 
a vtkAlgorithm (filter)? I'm implementing an automated LOD filter for 
paraview and it should automatically switch between LOD levels depending 
on the camera's position/zoom (it will mask glyphs)

The position of the camera would be enough information. Or something 
like the vtkFrustumCoverageCuller (that returns a value betweek 0..1 
depending on the volume of the model rendered at the moment).

As I heard from some other sources this task can be very tricky, but 
perhaps you got me some hints! I would be very happy!

best wishes,
Patrick

Message-ID: <20070110085017.1211.qmail@web25611.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

I use Paraview to evaluate FE results. I convert my

Is there some way to alter the probe function so that
you retrive nodal results and not results at
coordinates interpolated by paraview?

Is there some way to see local node/element numbers in
paraview?

Should I use som other format when I import my results
to achive this?

Kind regards,

Hi Micke,

>> Is there some way to alter the probe function so that you retrive nodal
results and not results at coordinates interpolated by paraview?

Use the "data analysis filter" that you'll be able to select the "query
method" among cell, point (interpolated), line, cell id and point id. 

>> Is there some way to see local node/element numbers in paraview?

>From my knowledge, only the node (point) numbers... You'll find the checkbox
in the Display tab labeled as "Label Point Ids" but, take care, if your
model is big you'll experience PV running really slower with this checkbox
enabled and it'll not be possible to distinguish the nodes since you'll only
see a cloud of numbers. By the way, PV will number the nodes in a C style
ordering starting from the 0 up to the number of nodes -1, in other words,
PV will introduces an offset of -1 in your node numbers (if I'm wrong here,
please, someone correct me).

Hope it helps you

Message-ID: <45d654b0701100740yda1ad9cx546c0f9f653a7f19@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I posted the January snapshot of ParaView III. The download links and
announcemets for all snapshots cam be found at:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

This snapshot includes binaries for Windows, Linux (32 and 64 bit) and
Mac OS X. The source can be obtained through CVS.

Here are some the things we have been working on:

* Improved python support. We added a programmable python filter. The
python source can be entered on the object inspector.
* Better default values for the object inspector. These are computed
based on the input. For example, the default maximum length of the
streamlines is now computed based on the input size.
* Pipeline browser improvements:
   - it is now possible to change inputs as well as add multiple
inputs to filters that support it
* Further GUI improvements
* First pass at annotation: we added a text source. This allows
creation of an arbitrary number of labels on the display. The text can
be moved by clicking and dragging. There are some glitches with the
interaction. We will fix this soon.

There is still very little documentation. Look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III to get more information on the new
features. We will continue adding more documentation to this page as
we progress. We will also start working on online documentation this month.

Have fun.

Hi all,

After updating (cvs update -Pd -r ParaView-2-9-January) from December
snapshot, it it necessary to rerun cmake /path/to/Paraview/source
or simply type make (which I guess the building will be faster) ?

Cheers,

You can just run make. It will run cmake automatically as part of the build.

Yeah, my whishes for 2007 have been fullfiled :-))
Thanks !

Anyway, In Edit -> Settings -> Active View Properties -> Annotation
menu, setting Outline color seems to have no effect (works fine for Axis
Label Color).

Am I doing something wrong ?

Did you mark the Interactive check box just above the Outline color 
button? The outline color is used for drawing a box around the 
orientation marker when it is in interactive mode so you will know where 
to put the mouse cursor to resize / reposition it.

Once again,

Some bugs have been fixed (center of rotation set to (0,0,0)), great !

Anyway, I still don't understand something...

I set Use Immediate Mode Rendering to on in Edit -> Settings menu.

But when I load my VTK data file, I have to click on Object Inspector ->
   Properties -> Display -> Apply in order to render my scene.

Is there something that I have misunderstood with "Use Immediate Mode
Rendering" ?

Cheers,

Outline is shown only when interacting with the orientation axes. Turn 
the "Interactive" checkbox on, the when your mouse is over the 
orientation axes you'll see the outline of the appropriate color. (I'll 
also fix the GUI to disable outline color when interactive is off).

Thanks,
Utkarsh.

Hi Fred,

"Immediate Mode Rendering" does not mean "auto-apply". It means that 
OpenGL does not use display lists when rendering; you may see it affect 
your rendering speed.

Immediate Mode rendering indicates whether to use OpenGL display lists 
while while rendering or not. It is not equivalent to the "Auto Accept" 
in ParaView <= 2.*. Hence, until auto-accept is added to ParaView 3, 
you'll have to hit "Apply" on creating  a source/reading a file before 
it is visible in the scene.

Ok, so I have misunderstood the trick.

I was believing that the Outline Color was concerning the color for
Object Inspector->Display->Style->Representation->Outline.

So, half fullfiled ;-))

Hi Amy,

Hmm, once again, I have misunderstood the trick :-(

By the way, is an "auto-apply" option envisageable or not ?

Hmm, so it's a good news: it will be applied :-)

You change the color of the outline you mention by clicking "Set Solid 
Color" in the Color section of the Display tab (just above where you set 
the representation to outline) and choosing a new color from the color 
selector dialog.

This feature has not been added yet, but from Utkarsh's e-mail a few

Ok, it takes to me sometime, but I have found out why I could get
working it.

Let's see...

1) I run paraview3,

2) connect builtin server,

3) open VTK data file,

4) click on Properties->Apply, Surface is selected by default, and
"Color by" set to my data.

5) Then I choose "Solid Color" in "Color by", thus "Set Solid Color" is
active.

6) Then I can choose the color I want for the Outline, and that sounds good.

Now, I repeat steps from 1 to 4.

5b) Then I choose Outline in Representation tab: "Set Solid Color" is
unactive,
and I can't choose nothing in "Color by" and can't set the color for
Outline.

Since I use pv3, I follow 1 to 6 steps, not 5b...

Cheers,

Hi Clint,

I think I have found another one (or may be I'm wrong).

Using Clip filter resets the Outline color that I have previously changed.

Hmm, I load a VTK file, change Outline color (set to purple), and choose
Clip filter.
Outline color gets back to white (?).
If I delete Clip filter, Outline color gets back to purple.

The outline changing colors is because you're looking at the outline of the 
data (purple) and the outline of the clip (white).

Anyway, the solid color should be inherited, and it is not.  If it was, both 
outlines would be purple.  We can fix that too.

Hi Fred,

The clip filter isn't actually overriding the outline color. What's 
happening is that the clip displays a bounding box and an interactive 
clipping plane, and the bounding box it displays is directly over the 
bounding box for your data.

Hi,

It has been said that the bug regarding the center of rotation was fixed.

But when I save the scene whith Save State, quit PV3, rerun it and load
with Load State,
the center of rotation comes back to (0, 0, 0)...

Yeah, I should have noticed that too.  If you go a step further and change the 
representation of the clip output to outline, it'll be white.  In ParaView 2, 
the color was inherited.

Hi,

I like LOD Threshold be set to 0.

But unlike Annotation parameters in Settings menu,
LOD parameters are not saved, so I have to set LOD T. to 0 each time I
run pv3.

Is it the right/expected behavior ?

This has been captured as bug #4299.

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=4299&pos=8

As a workaround, you can move the associated slider all the way to the right.  That value will be saved correctly and will at least keep the LOD feature off for all but the largest data.

Hi,

I am a student and have just started work on ParaView. I looked at the resources for adding custom
filters to paraview but could not quite understand them. 

I have the C++ source code of the filter I have created with all necessary header files. I was
wondering if there is a step by step guide to adding custom Filters to paraview?

Also, I need help with understanding the role of the .pvsm file for the server manager?

Thanks,
Bikash

Subject: [Paraview] How to Display the Actual Scalar Values
Message-ID: <1EA96E66-08EA-4E23-931D-1CB6F5F8FB57@imts.us>

I have an unstructured grid data set that has a couple of scalar  
values at each point. The "names" of these scalars are "Domain ID"  
and "Node ID".
    I see in the "Display" tab that there is a "Label Point Ids"  
option but this isn't exactly what I want but close. Instead of  
displaying the internal point id that vtk uses I want to display the  
value of the scalar at each point. I can "Color by: " the node Id but  
I really need to have the actual value shown on the screen. I tried a  
"Glyph" filter but that didn't get me anywhere. Looking through the  
Paraview book isn't getting me anywhere either. Is there such a  
filter or way to display the actual values of scalars on the screen?
   At the moment we are using a Pick filter to get the value of each  
one individually.

Thanks for any help.

I don't believe this is possible in ParaView(2). However in ParaView3
you can  display the values selected in the "Element Inspector"
window.

Hi Mike,

There is not a way in ParaView 2.* to do what you're looking for. 
However, you can easily accomplish this in ParaView III using the 
selection feature there.

To use this feature do the following:
* Load your data.
* Switch to selection mode (arrow with dots around it in the toolbar).
* Click and drag on your data to draw out a rectangle containing the 
points / cells you're interested in.
* From the View menu, select Element Inspector.
* Select either Point Data or Cell Data in the Element Inspector to see 
the point-centered or cell-centered data values.

Subject: [Paraview] Cutting plane coordinates
Message-ID: <1168620158.15440.112.camel@kinkaid>

Hi all,
I'd like to specify the outer coordinates of a cut plane rather than
center/normal.  I would prefer that it be fairly precise, so moving the
plane by manipulators isn't the best option.  Besides, turning on "Cube
Axes" for the plane doesn't help much with manual manipulator placement
since the coordinates don't get updated until the new position is
Accept-ed.

I could also hand-compute the appropriate center/normal values from the
outer coordinates, but that's a bit tedious.  The only other idea I have
is to modify the Cut module and add a new type of Cut Function that is
identical to Plane but the interface would provide inputs for the
requisite 3 points needed to specify a plane.

Is there some other way that I haven't thought of, or is that pretty
much it?

Thanks,
Sean

Simone--

I am not sure what follows is relevant, but here is my experience.

I write EnSight gold case files on both dos (WindowsXP) and Linux.  When 
I take my dos-formatted case files to Linux for EnSight to read I must 
run them through dos2unix to get the line terminators changed before 
EnSight can read them without getting confused. I have not tried 
PV-on-Linux reading dos-formatted case files, nor have I tried the 
reverse. (The two test-file translators dos2unix and unix2dos are quite 
useful.)

I have attached a typical (for me) case file

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Gold reader "new line" error

Thanks for the answer SamuelKey. That's indeed a common source of errors 
... DOS <-> *nix ... the dreaded end line statement(s)! Since I stayed 
within *nix environment, this is though not a problem here.

But ... I think now I know what's wrong with my case files. I noticed 
that your case file didn't include the "constant per case" lines. So I 
checked the reader source and I found a check for the stanza "constant" 
in vtkEnSightReader.cxx:

[...]
if (strncmp(line, "constant", 8) == 0)
         {
         vtkDebugMacro(<< line);
         }
       else if [...]

I am not a C++ guru (and I didn't dig deeper hereafter), but this looks 
to me like a check for a "constant-whatever" line that leads to a debug 
message. When the "constant" line is short enough (less than 79 
characters) the reader just jumps to the next line, but when the 
"constant" line is wrapped (being longer than 79 ch.) the reader exits, 
complaining about an unknown line begin (the wrapped line of the 
"constant" stanza)


OK, learned something new today :-)

Subject: [Paraview] Newbie: contributing with an implementation of the
	Splatting algorithm
Message-ID: <1168893675.31216.114.camel@trantor>

Hi all,

I'm a PhD student [0] at Universitat Polit?cnica de Catalunya [1] and
Universitat de Barcelona [2], working on Volume Visualization at MoViBio
research group [3].

The research group has its own software system Hipovis [4], but I am
evaluating the possibility of using other software systems. Right now,
I'm evaluating using ParaView/VTK to test current research approaches on
Focus+Context Volume Visualization based on the Splatting algorithm [5].

As far as I know, VTK libraries does not offer the Volume Splatting
algorithm [6] and there are no available examples of implementing it
using VTK. However, I found references to works that use VTK to
implement Splatting approaches [7], but no code is available.



Hence, I have the following questions::::::::::::::::

A- Is there any VTK's architectural reason why the splatting algorithm
does not suit the VTK libraries? May be implementing the splatting
algorithm inside the VTK's pipeline architecture will not provide enough
performance to develop research activities, will it?

B- Although ParaView offers fast volume rendering (textures), precise
v.r. (RayCast) and both qualities v.r. (using VolumePro hw), will it be
worth if I work on adding the Splatting algorithm and Focus+Context
features? (for me it is worth because it is the basis of my thesis but I
would like to know if there are other people also interested in it).

C- If I want to be involved in VTK development to implement the
Splatting algorithm, which steps do you recommend me? From you
experience, how long does it take to a PhD student (with C++ and
graphics knowledge) to get involved with the project and develop new
code? (I know this is a generic question, but I need some estimation). I
already bought the two books [8][9], reviewed the coding standards [10]
and subscribed to the list.

D- If I want to be involved in ParaView development to use the Splatting
algorithm and implement Focus+Context features, which steps do you
recommend me?  From you experience, how long does it take to a PhD
student (with C++ and graphics knowledge) to get involved with the
project and develop new code? (I know this is a generic question, but I
need some estimation). I already ordered the book [11] and subscribed to
the list.

E- Which are the good and bad points of ParaView/VTK versus VolumeShop
[12]? It seems VolumeShop is not really open source (and we are looking
an open source project to get involved), it is mainly used on MsWindows
platforms (and we are interested in a multi-platform environment), and
it does not provide parallel rendering.

F- Which are the good and bad points of ParaView/VTK versus VolView
[13]?




I would like to known your opinion about these questions and any other
possible important factors you think I should pay attention.



Thank you very much in advance.

PD: I already have sent a similar post to VTK's list, specifically about
VTK's issues.

Hi Jordi,

First of all I should tell you that I know nothing about what you told in
your post since I'm not a visualization guy. I'm just a CFD developer and a
^curious^ user of visualization tools. Therefore, forgive me if I'm only
wasting your time -- my intention was good ;o)

Some time ago I posted a message asking for some technique to visualize SPH
(Smoothed Particle Hydrodinamics) and DEM (Discrete Element Method) data. At
that time I got some answers addressing the visualization of particle data
within VTK ([1, 2]) using a splatting algorithm (take a look here
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGaussianSplatter.html)

[2] http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-February/002547.html 

p.s.: Some guys from CSCS lab are working with particle data visualization
(http://www.cscs.ch/a-display.php?id=170). Once again, I don't know if this
software (Sparticles) uses something related to the splatting technique.

Assunto: [Paraview] Newbie: contributing with an implementation of
theSplatting algorithm

Hi all,

I'm a PhD student [0] at Universitat Polit?cnica de Catalunya [1] and
Universitat de Barcelona [2], working on Volume Visualization at MoViBio
research group [3].

The research group has its own software system Hipovis [4], but I am
evaluating the possibility of using other software systems. Right now, I'm
evaluating using ParaView/VTK to test current research approaches on
Focus+Context Volume Visualization based on the Splatting algorithm [5].

As far as I know, VTK libraries does not offer the Volume Splatting
algorithm [6] and there are no available examples of implementing it using
VTK. However, I found references to works that use VTK to implement
Splatting approaches [7], but no code is available.



Hence, I have the following questions::::::::::::::::

A- Is there any VTK's architectural reason why the splatting algorithm does
not suit the VTK libraries? May be implementing the splatting algorithm
inside the VTK's pipeline architecture will not provide enough performance
to develop research activities, will it?

B- Although ParaView offers fast volume rendering (textures), precise v.r.
(RayCast) and both qualities v.r. (using VolumePro hw), will it be worth if
I work on adding the Splatting algorithm and Focus+Context features? (for me
it is worth because it is the basis of my thesis but I would like to know if
there are other people also interested in it).

C- If I want to be involved in VTK development to implement the Splatting
algorithm, which steps do you recommend me? From you experience, how long
does it take to a PhD student (with C++ and graphics knowledge) to get
involved with the project and develop new code? (I know this is a generic
question, but I need some estimation). I already bought the two books
[8][9], reviewed the coding standards [10] and subscribed to the list.

D- If I want to be involved in ParaView development to use the Splatting
algorithm and implement Focus+Context features, which steps do you recommend
me?  From you experience, how long does it take to a PhD student (with C++
and graphics knowledge) to get involved with the project and develop new
code? (I know this is a generic question, but I need some estimation). I
already ordered the book [11] and subscribed to the list.

E- Which are the good and bad points of ParaView/VTK versus VolumeShop [12]?
It seems VolumeShop is not really open source (and we are looking an open
source project to get involved), it is mainly used on MsWindows platforms
(and we are interested in a multi-platform environment), and it does not
provide parallel rendering.

F- Which are the good and bad points of ParaView/VTK versus VolView [13]?




I would like to known your opinion about these questions and any other
possible important factors you think I should pay attention.



Thank you very much in advance.

VTK's issues.

At present, this filter is scheduled to be rewritten and replaced in
ParaView 3.  Thus, this known seg fault will probably not be fixed in
this old version of the Pick/Probe filter.

Hi!
On paraview 2.4, when I named timesteps as Time-001.vtk, Time-002.vtk and so
on, and opened it; paraview automatically took it as a timeseries.
I want to load my timeseries as timeseries in paraview 2.9.7 as well,
however, I don't see any option or GUI element to load a timeseries. Loading
the first file of timeseries does not load the full timeseries as was the
case in older version.
Please let me know about it.
Thanks
Aditya

It seems that I was not able to find any built in ANALYZE reader.
Can that really be true?

I've done a bit of work reconstructing neurons from confocal image
stacks using a mixture of ITK, VTK, and ParaView.

Image data is image data. It usually doesn't matter that the data came
from a confocal microscope or a CT scanner. It usually doesn't matter if
you're looking at a neuron or a moose. All the same tools usually work.

What sorts of things do you want to do? What file type do you have?

HI Arne,

I've never heard of "ANALYZE" images. Is "ANALYZE" the name of the application or the file format? Could you supply the URL for a web site describing these image files? Do you know anything about the format of the image files?

Sure i can. ANALYZE is a common fileformat for medical images. It is used by
a lot of people. Actually i thought it was one of the most used formats for
medical images, but maybe i am wrong.
Here is a specification: http://www.mayo.edu/bir/PDF/ANALYZE75.pdf
I think it was developed by the same people that also develop SPM for
matlab, but i am not sure of this.
Here is more information:
http://www.grahamwideman.com/gw/brain/analyze/formatdoc.htm

I find it a bit strange that paraview cannot read these files.

Thank you

Those links were helpful. An ANALYZE image is stored in 2 files, one with raw data and one with metadata. ParaView can probably read the raw data but the result might be meaningless. This format can handle 2D and 3D images in a wide variety of formats
and pixel ordering. It looks like the header information is critical to a proper understanding of the raw data.

A quick look at the VTK library (where ParaView's work is done) shows no reader for this format. There is some support for DICOM images, also used in medicine.

Does the Mayo/SPM system provide "output" or "export" options, to another file format?

If all else fails you could write a new reader.That is how the package grows.

ParaView has been traditionally more of a scientific visualization / 
unstructured data tool - it is only with this latest release that you 
can even directly visualize 3D image data with volume rendering, and the 
support is still limited. I am sure that as more support for structured 
data is incorporated into ParaView, more 3D image file formats will be 
supported. However, at this point I am not sure if anyone that is 
funding ParaView development is interested in using ParaView for medical 
image processing - hence such contributions may need to originate from 
the user / developer community.

For now, you can download VolView from the Kitware web site, and use it 
to convert your Analyze files into something like vti (the VTK native 
format) that ParaView can read.

I have been trying to add custom filter to ParaView 3. I followed the method I used in 2.6 but
without any succes.
This is what I have been doing.

1) Created C++ class, pvsm and XML files for filter.
2) Put them in the same folder and pointed PV_INTERFACE_PATH to that folder
3) Run ccmake and use the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE feature to compile.

I go through the compilation succesfully but do not see anything on the Filter menu. This works
fine for me in Paraview 2.6. 

I also tried adding a line in the ParaView3/Qt/Components/Resources/XML/ParaViewFilters.xml file
and compiled again but still cannot see anything on the filter menu.

I am a newbie with ParaView and any help would be really appreciated.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Stream Surface
Message-ID: <45B14D12.3050602@web.de>

Hi,

has someone experience in creating stream surfaces with ParaView?

I am trying to get the streamlines calculated for some points together
to a surface that can be coloured and plotted.

For now I created streamlines for a ten points that are lying in one line.
Now I wonder how to create a surface out of these streamlines. The filter
'Quadric Clustering' does something similar. But the output cannot be
plotted as a surface but only as something that looks like a grid.

Can anyone give me a hint whether it is possible to visualize stream
surfaces and how to do this.

Regards, M.B

Hi all,

I have just done a "cvs update" in my PV3 source, but nothing seems
to have changed (ie about some issues from previous posts).

Am I doing something wrong thinking update my PV3 source,
or do issues have not been yet fixed and checked in cvs tree ?

Cheers,

The fixes were put in and will be released in the next snapshot.
If you feel a bit adventurous, you can do a "cvs update -APd" to remove 
the release tag you have, and get what the developers are working on.

Hmm, not really ;-)

Yes, there is. We are still working on a few small issues. We will
start on the binaries later this week (I hope).

Subject: [Paraview] I've created a ParaView introduction tutorial to High
	School students
Message-ID: <1169484036.6216.14.camel@trantor>

Hi all,

We have prepared a presentation of ParaView to high school students that
came to university [1] to know about scientific visualization.

I've translated it into English because I thought that maybe someone
else can use it (I hope I've left just a few mistakes in this fast
translation). You can find it here [2][3], and the used head.vtk
datafile here [4]. It's an easy tutorial that we used with 200 students
simultaneously, so we prepared it at an extremely detailed low level.

Is there any "repository" were *.pvs or presentations about ParaView can
be upload?

Thanks.

First of all, thank you for your time ;) I took a lot of time to answer
because we were preparing a ParaView introduction workshop to high
school students (I've just sent a message to the list about it, that is
placed here [1]). So, sorry for the delay.

Certainly, this can be used when implementing the Splatting algorithm,
but it only represents the very last step of the algorithm.

The example from CSCS seems to take a 'surface rendering' approach,
while the Splatting algorithm is used to perform 'direct volume
rendering' DVR [2]. In DVR, all the 'volume' is rendered considering
that is internally heterogeneous.

So, it seems that the vtkGaussianSplatter can be used to implement the
algorithm but no Splatting Algorithm implementation is available in VTK.

Thanks for your answer. I rest a little bit more to see if somebody else
answers.

There is a page on the ParaView Wiki where several users have already
posted their own tutorials.  This would be a good place to add your own.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_2.X_documentation_and_tutorials

It looks like all the current entries just put links to their own web
pages where they have posted the tutorial on their own site, but there
is nothing stopping you from adding your own Wiki page and posting your
data directly.  In fact, that may be better so that you don't have to
worry about broken links.

Nice, so if I start implementing it on VTK, at least there is one

Perfect! I was worried to know why no body has implemented it before. To

This information is relevant for me in order to choose with which

Good news. We can see which can of collaboration we could have.

My thoughts are: (1) implement splatting algorithm in VTK, (2) find an
"interface application" to use it.

It seems, that your project could cover the second step. So, we could
find a way to collaborate. On the other hand, do you have programmers
that could help me to start on the first step? It could be an starting
point to know each others.

Ok, may I have a look? I check the web page, but only the sample data
sets are currently available. By the way, I develop on linux.

I think my first focus should be step (1), but I would be important to
have a minimum of step (2) ready to test it.

That's not silly at all.  I commonly see simulations take advantage of
symmetry to reduce computation.  However, I am unclear on what the
problem is you are having with the reflection filter.  It works fine for
me with ParaView 2.4.4, the RSN ParaView 2.6, and the upcoming Paraview
3.  What version of ParaView are you using it with and what type of data
are you applying it to?

Hi all,
I'm new to ParaView and trying to get a client/server configuration up 
and running.  I have downloaded the latest and greatest and built it 
with the parallel capabilities enabled.

Here are some of the parameters I set in cmake:
MANGLED_MESA_INCLUDE_DIR: not found
MANGLED_MESA_LIBRARY            not found
MANGLED_OSMESA_LIBRARY       /usr/include
MANGLED_OSMESA_LIBRARY       /usr/X11R6/lib64/libOsMesa.so
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR                   /usr/include
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY                       /usr/X11R6/lib64/libGL.so
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY                     /usr/X11R6/lib64/libGLU.so
OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR                  /usr/include
OSMESA_LIBRARY                           /usr/X11R6/lib64/libOSMesa.so
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA        ON
VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA          OFF

I thought I wanted to use the off-screen rendering OSMesa library and 
not mangled mesa.  Most of these settings were detected and set by 
cmake.  Everything builds OK, but when I try to run paraview itself, 
pvclient, or one of the servers, here is what I get:

/export/linux/lib/paraview-2.4/pvclient-real: relocation error: 
/usr/X11R6/lib64/libOSMesa.so.4: undefined symbol: _glapi_Dispatch

Neither my libGL or libOSMesa libraries have symbol tables so I am not 
able to verify the existence of _glapi_Dispatch, but there are 
references of sorts in both (using strings command).

Where have I gone awry?

Thanks in advance for any and all help.

Jim

Try this : point these to your Mesa build. Mine looks like this...

 OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR               /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5.1/include
 OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY                /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5.1/lib/libGL.so
 OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY               /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5.1/lib/libGLU.so
 OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR         /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5.1/include
 OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR               /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5.1/include
 OSMESA_LIBRARY                   /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5.1/lib/libOSMesa.so

So that the GL is Mesa GL and not the system GL. This ought to help 
prevent the app picking up the wrong one.

Hi,

I have also seen problems with the reflection filter on certain datasets 
(Ensight, multiple datasets). Then the reflection filter just isn't 
selectable. Instead of wondering about the "why" at first, I just found 
a quick fix by using an other filter that works with my datasets.

I use "vtkTransformFilter"; Filter->Transform (PV2.4). I then specify a 
transformation of: Translate: 0 0 0 ; Scale: -1 -1 -1 ; Orientation: 0 
180 0 ... for e.g. getting a reflection about the y-plane. Changing the 
orientation angles (0 or 180) should reflect around the other two planes.


Regards, Simone

One more detail: before you run paraview make sure the path(s) in LD_LIBRARY_PATH point to the Mesa libraries before the libraries for OpenGL. If the shared object is not found using the paths in LD_LIBRARY_PATH your system will then look in several other places (e.g., /usr/lib) defined at the system level.

Use something like "ldd paraview" to see whether your system is using the desired libraries.

On our Redhat's Fedora Core 5 (32 bit) and Enterprise 4 (64 bit) machines the path specified at link time (in JB's example, /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5.1/lib) is NOT recorded in the paraview executable (e.g., "paraview", "pvclient", "pvserver"); instead, only the library name (e.g., libGL.so) is recorded. The system selects WHICH libGL.so to use when the program is started.

Is all this true on all Linux/Unix/Mac/Windows systems?

Do you mean Scale: 1 -1 1?

Scaling by (-1,-1,-1) mean you are reflecting the object about all 3 planes, not just the y-plane. Your screen shots look correct given that scaling.

Are you sure this is what you want? This corresponds to turning the object inside-out. If you had instead used a scaling of (1,-1,1) the copy would be reflected about just the y-plane, and the copy would be adjacent to the original so that, together, they looked like a single object.

Hi Bonnie,

Yes, KWWidgets will be replaced by Qt in ParaView III. The KWWidgets 
version (ParaView 2.*) will continue to be supported at least until 
ParaView III contains all the features currently in ParaView 2.*.

I have not done development on the Qt GUI, so I do not know how 
difficult it would be to convert from KWWidgets GUI code to that for the 
Qt-based GUI.

I would suggest starting from ParaView 3. ParaView 2 and 3 GUI
implementations are completely different. It will not be a
straightforward change to port a GUI built on top to ParaView 2 to
ParaView 3.

I found out that a commercial license for Qt is over $3000.  If I cut over
to Qt, will I have everything I need to work with it in the GNU
implementation?  

Why did you change to Qt from KW Widgets?  Is there some feature they
lacked?  Or is a matter of the fact that some developers at Sandia National
Labs and Elemental Technologies preferred it?

I would suggest starting from ParaView 3. ParaView 2 and 3 GUI
implementations are completely different. It will not be a
straightforward change to port a GUI built on top to ParaView 2 to
ParaView 3.

That's right ... I never noticed a difference since I just have surface 
datasets. Thanks for pointing this out, now I'll take a closer look.

Subject: [Paraview] Questions Regarding PV2.6 in Cluster configuration
Message-ID: <b02264720701240649s6416e65iac4991876df2c18c@mail.gmail.com>

We just got our new cluster setup and i've been experimenting with Paraview
2.6 (compiled from source with OpenMPI support & Linked Against Mesa).

I've got a few questions for you guys:

1) When using the new Structured Volume Rendering in a Client-Server
(Parallel) configuration, it looks like it doesn't composite the images
correct.  I have verified that the "Disable Ordered Compositing" checkbox is
OFF.

2) Running with OSMesa is working Fantastic (no mangling used, just
OSMesa).  However, when running with a single node (or directly on the
cluster) running while linked against the Hardware Accelerated OpenGL
drivers is (obviously) much faster (1.5Mill Tris/Sec vs 150Mil Tris/Sec).
Is there any way to have Mesa there for client-server
(--use-offscreen-rendering) support, but have Hardware there for single-user
stuff?

3) I'm currently working with loading 2 datasets simultaneously
    a) Dataset A: VTI File, Uniform Rectilinear, 245,993,000 cells;
    b) Dataset B: Legacy VTK file, Polygonal, 20,801,406 Cells (all Vertex
Cells, Point Cloud Basically).
   When I run both the Client & Multiple Servers on the same Cluster
Machine, everything works perfectly.  When I run multiple servers on the
Linux Machine and a Windows Client (that I've compiled with Visual Studio
.NET 2003, no OSMesa, no MPI), it crashes when I load the second dataset.
It doesn't matter which of the 2 I load first, when I try to load the second
one it crashes the Client (the servers report no error and appear to be
functioning normally).  I can fix this by Setting the "Composite Above"
slider to 0.0, which makes it composite all the time.  The problem seems to
be related to the switch between Geometry collection & compositing that
happens when I load the 2nd dataset.

4) I know Paraview has support for automagically distributing non-parallel
data across the nodes.  Albeit sometimes it does a poor job of it, you've
supplied the D3 filter to fix it.  However, I'm loading a Uniform
Rectilinear grid, one of the easiest datatypes in the world to distribute,
yet I still get 1-cell wide seams in my data along each processor partition
when extracting an isosurface from it.  Are ghost cells missing in this
distribution?  Is there any way to generate the ghost-cells while keeping it
Uniform Rectilinear (so that I can continue to use the awesomely fast
FixedPoint Raycaster) ?


Any clues?  Overall, I'm blown away by how well this is working :)

So many questions, so little time to answer :-) I will answer a few first.

I will investigate this. Do you have any screenshots you can share
(you can send them directly to me if you want).

Sure. Compile 2 different versions. One with accelerated OpenGL and no
MPI. That is your client/single node. One with Mesa. That is your
server. You can throw away that client. In ParaView 3, we have options
to disable the compilation of client. I think there is a similar
option in ParaView 2 too but I can't remember.

to be continued... (I hope)

Message-ID: <781EC79D-2597-46E1-86E8-D9C48AB2C95D@ed.ac.uk>

Hi folks,

I'm using Matlab to extract data from an EM simulator, write a VTK  
XML file, and view the results in Paraview. I'm reading and writing  
the data as UInt16. I want to write the data in the VTK file as  
binary and so am using this form:

<AppendedData encoding=raw">
_NNNN...............
</AppendedData>

The problem is I keep receiving this message from Paraview.

# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: /Users/kitware/ 
ParaViewReleaseRoot/paraview-2.4.4/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx (478)
vtkXMLImageDataReader (0x85bd630): Cannot read point data array  
"material" from PointData in piece 0.  The data array in the element  
may be too short.
ErrorMessage end

I have better results using Float32 but the Data Range is reported  
incorrectly when the VTK file is read in Paraview. This is being done  
on a PowerPC machine (Apple Powerbook) so I've made sure I'm doing  
everything in BigEndian.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

Cheers,

Craig

First the obvious, I assume that you know that there's enough data. It
should be easy to check with raw data.

I've seen this error in situations where it does not make sense. For me
it was when I wrote a file with many pieces. Are you writing many
pieces?

Ok!

I tried to upload the tutorial to the Paraview Wiki but I had some
problems:

     A. Tutorials list: 
              * I couldn't update the current
                ParaView_2.X_documentation_and_tutorials because I
                received a "Spam protection filter" error [1] (I already
                sent an email to wiki-admin). I only tried to enter an
                extra line about the new tutorial [2]. 
     B. Personal page: 
              * Alternatively, I tried to create my personal page [3]
                and I received also a similar spam error [4]. 
     C. Upload files: 
              * I decided to try uploading files, and I was successfully
                at loading Paraview-head-UB-tutorial.pdf, but failed
                when trying to upload Paraview-head-UB-tutorial.odp and
                Paraview-head-UB-tutorial-data.tar.gz. I got a warning
                they were no "recommended image file formats".
              * Is there a correct way to upload non-image files?
     D. Tutorial page: 
              * Finally, I tried to create ParaView:Tutorial:HeadBasic
                [5] but I also received an spam error.

So, I couldn't creaty any content at all. For sure I'm doing something
wrong, and specially I misunderstood something about ParaView wiki.

Could you help me?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <81D550F315B9E623AA4A2930@harpo.psc.edu>

The classic Z buffer alias problem seems to occur when running in client-server mode under some conditions. By that I mean that odd-shaped pieces of the near surface will be replaced by far surfaces, at certain view angles. See bug #4368 for images and a VTK file that exhibits the problem.

	compiling ParaView 2.4.4
Message-ID: <20070126154952.or5lkezla8s8s4wg@www.webmail.ucl.ac.uk>

I downloaded the "Latest Stable Release (2.4.4)" from  :

http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html

and ran ccmake to configure the Makefiles and then gmake to compile.

I used the -j 1 flag to ensure that I only compiled one file at a time to
prevent any inter-dependency problems.

I am getting a large number of "undefined reference" errors when building
libvtkXdmf.so :

Here are the first few :

[ 77%] Built target vtkPVServerManager
[ 78%] Built target vtkPVServerCommonTCL
[ 82%] Built target vtkPVServerManagerTCL

Does anyone know what is causing them ? It looks like I am missing a library but
I don't know which one !

Thanks in advance

Hi All,

In the pvsm file code given on the Paraview Extend wiki page,

  <ProxyGroup name="filters">
   <SourceProxy name="CellDerivatives" class="vtkCellDerivatives">
     <InputProperty

I get an error when using, command="SetInput", which rectifies when using,
command="SetInputConnection"

Is this an error on the wiki page?

The link to the wiki with complete code is

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 2.6.0
Message-ID: <45BF5EEA.7040106@kitware.com>

Hi ParaView users and developers,

The ParaView 2.6 beta release (version 2.6.0) is now available for 
download from the ParaView web site: 
http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html.  It is also available 
through CVS; the tag is ParaView-2-6-0.  If you find bugs in the 
release, please e-mail me; preferably also send me a patch file to fix 
the problem.  There have been several changes since the 2.4 release of 
ParaView; they include the following.

    * Parallel uniform rectilinear grid volume rendering (vtkImageData)
    * New algorithms for parallel unstructured grid volume rendering
    * Hardware accelerated offscreen rendering using OpenGL framebuffers
      (supported on all platforms)
    * Improved multi-block support
    * Improved AMR support
    * Animation saving with ffmpeg
    * The mesh quality filter now uses the verdict library (more quality
      measures)
    * New readers: FLUENT, OpenFOAM, MFIX, LSDyna, AcuSolve
    * Added gradient filter for unstructured data.
    * Picking/Probe/Data Analysis filter improvements:
          o Fix lockup when some nodes lack data in parallel.
          o Use time value from reader for X axis.
          o Save changes in state, trace and batch files.
          o Turn on exodus reader's point data global id array by default.
          o Allow DataAnalaysis filter to open up data sets that lack
            point data.
          o Fix a bug that occurred in parallel when data arrays were
            ordered differently.
    * Surface Extraction improvements:
          o Let volume rendering display ignore non tetrahedral cells
            when volume rendering tetrahedral data.
          o Create vtkOriginalCellIds array to track which 3D cells
            produce each 2D surface cell.
          o If all the cells in an unstructured grid are already
            simplices, just copy the input to the output.
    * GLOBALIDS:
          o Add a new attribute type, GLOBALID, which will not be copied
            piecemeal or interpolated. Ids need to be protected
            throughout the pipeline because they are identifiers, and
            not numbers per say, so algebraic operations on them are
            undefined.
    * D3 filter improvements:

Hi Bikash,

Good catch. You're right that the wiki page is out of date. I'll fix it.

Can I write a reader that has multiple outputs? Ie.. I am reading  
some data and converting it to vtkPolyData and I want to segregate  
the data. I was thinking of having a pair of vtkPolyData Objects, one  
to hold each type of "data".

If this is possible, is there an example I can look at?

THanks

ParaView does not support this yet. We will be adding this feature to
paraview 3 next month.

Can you not create each data set in a separate group (i.e., 
vtkMultiGroup), or am I misunderstanding the problem?

I could, if I knew what a MultiGroup was? ;-)

I looked in the vtkDocs for 5.x and didn't find the class. I have  
since figured out how to apply some scalar data attributes to the  
data and I can threshold based on the scalar values at that point.

Thanks for the info.. I'll look into MultiGroup later this afternoon...

Is that a newish class? since vtk 5.0 or so because I don't have that  
class listing in my documentation download...

But it does look like what I might have used.

Well, I don't know when it was introduced, but if a vtkMultiGroupDataSet 
is indeed the correct solution for you, one example of its use is in the 
vtkCSCSNetCDF reader (http://www.cscs.ch/a-display.php?id=1168).

In theory, it uses MultiGroup's to output NetCDF variables whose 
dimensions don't match.  I say "in theory" because it currently only 
outputs the one group with the most dimensions and ignores all the rest, 
but it should work once fully implemented.  The CSCS web page says they 
plan to add that feature, but I may be adding it myself soon for my own 
needs.  Anyway, it seems to be a good reference for using MultiGroups.

I think there are 2 major uses of multiple outputs:
1. Fixed number of outputs, each output with a specific purpose. For
example, a filter that clips a dataset producing inside as 1 output
and outside as another. This is best implemented as a multiple output
filter.
2. Variable number of outputs, each of a subset of a whole. This is
what multi-group (multi-block or AMR) is designed for. This is best
implemented as a 1 output reader/filter that produces multi-group.

ParaVIew supports 2. It does not support 1 well.

Subject: [Paraview] Multi-Block Plot3D Data
Message-ID: <1170202603.45bfdfeb5ac39@webmail.stanford.edu>



Hi

We have some multi-block Plot3D Files that we are working on using paraview
2.6. These files load up as one single component, even though the geometry
file defines different parts. The same data when loaded in Ensight comes up
as individual components. We were wondering if paraview supports multi-block
data in its real sense. Also, is there any sample multi-block data on the
web that we could view to know the expected behavior of Paraview when such
files load up.

Subject: [Paraview] Error when building Paraview 2.4.4
Message-ID: <0MKp2t-1HC3SJ2bVY-0007AD@mrelay.perfora.net>

I am a new user of Paraview, and have been trying to built it from source on
a CDROM I got with the Kitware documentation.  I get a set of errors during
building where it tells reports a "PRJ003 Error spawing 'cmd.exe'" error.  I
have found that this is related to it embedding a manifest.  

 

I can turn it off a single project at a time, but I suspect a change to the
CMake files is needed or a different rev compiler.   Can someone help me to
get a clean debug build?  Is MSVS C++ 2005 the version that we should be
using to build Paraview?

Message-ID: <0MKp2t-1HC5mM1CSK-0007Hn@mrelay.perfora.net>

I found some changes to cmake mentioned here in the mailing list, so I
downloaded CMake 2.4.6

And tried to use it to build Paraview 2.4.4.  Now I get the "Error spawning
cmd.exe" message during cmake configure!

 

I wasn't able to find the testCompiler.c, and the location it lists for the
BuildLog.htm is also empty. 

 

Any clues?

When you do want to make changes (export multiple actual groups), please 
keep me in the loop. What you want should be very easy to add as all the 
logic is already in place (ie send me an example file and I'll do it:).

NB. the svn repository here
https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/
is updated reasonably regularly as I add things. the netCDF code had a 
bit of work done a few weeks ago to allow the loading of vector data as 
{u,v,w} where dimensions (of the vector plus data extents) are specified 
according to the OpenDX standard (openDX reads netCDF and uses certain 
conventions to do it)

Hi,

I would like to add another use for multiple outputs : 
3. a reader wich can read files with a variable number of geometries.
There are then multiple outputs, but they are not subsets of a whole, 
and should be shown as seperate objects.

Will ParaView support this kind of reader?

Thanks,
Stephane

No. You have to use multi-block for this.

Hi All,

As some of you have already discovered, the binary tarballs for Linux 
and Mac do not contain a bin directory, and so do not contain the 
ParaView-related executables. We are working on fixing this problem, and 
new binary tarballs will be available later today. I will send another 
e-mail to the mailing lists when they are ready.

The multi-block support is getting better with every release. The
current multi-block support includes:

* Loading of multi-block in parallel
* Extracting blocks with Extract Datasets and Extract Group filters
(Group == Block)
* Grouping of multiple datasets to multi-block with Group Datasets
* Coloring by group (apply level scalars and then color by GroupIdScalars)
* Most of the filters can be applied to multi-block datasets.

There are some limitations:
* Multi-block datasets cannot be volume rendered (they have to be
converted to "simple" dataset using Convert to Simple Dataset)
* Multi-block datasets cannon be analyzed through picking

We will be working on improving this support in ParaView 3.

The geometry produced by DS0-DS4 is redistributed to DS0 and DS1. It is then
sent to the render server (DS0 -> RS0, DS1 -> RS1).

Yes. We make sure that ParaView compiles with the GPL distribution of
Qt. However, I would not advise using the GPL'ed version unless you
are doing open-source or in-house development.

It wasn't an easy decision. Honestly, I still had my doubts when we
first switched. However, after working with Qt for over a year now, I
am very glad that we did. It is a very mature and wonderful toolkit.
It provides many things KWWidgets does not. This is not surprising
given that amount of effort that goes towards it is much bigger. Some
of the reasons to switch:

* Qt is very mature, widely used and very well documented. This makes
it much easier for new developers to learn. Therefore, it opens up
ParaView as a development platform to more people.
* Qt has a much larger set of modern widgets.
* Qt has support for things like database connectivity (we are already
using this in the infovis area).
* Qt supports OS X look and feel  as opposed to X11 look and feel.

Some additional comments....

If you want to compile, use, modify ParaView III (in-house), then using
the GPL version of Qt is totally fine.

If you want to make a 'patch' to ParaView III, and then submit that
patch back to the main developers, GPL version is totally fine.

If you want to do 'large scale' development on ParaView III and then
contribute those changes back to the core project you have a have
commercial Qt license.

Hi All,

The Linux binary tarballs are now available from the ParaView download 
web site: http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html. The Mac binaries 
are still compiling; I will send another e-mail when they are available.

Hi,

I am looking for a filter to calculate the mass flow average; I know
the integrate filter for area averaging.
Does there exist such a filter or a different way to calculate it?

Greetings!

This is a beta release. There are still a few bugs to be resolved.
Mainly transparency support using depth-peeling. 2.6.1 will follow
relatively soon.
