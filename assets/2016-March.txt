Hello Samuel.

Sorry, but I can't undersatand how can the file fragmentation affect it's
readability and parsing. Even if the file has thousands of fragments and
"brain-damaging" :) runlist in many extended FILE records on NTFS
partition, your program, if it uses Win API, will see it like a solid file
(althougt there will be very low performance of sequental access). So there
should be no any faults on reading highly fragmented files.
I have checked out the "direct" reading of EnSight case from the cluster
via samba with ParaView 5.0.0 on Windows machine. The same error appears as
in my first message, although there are *different files and filesystems*.
I think the problem is not a fragmentation but a *file size*. Some
32-bit-like relicts or so in EnSight reader (it's just a guess, sorry if
I'm wrong). But my hypothesis does not asks the question why does the bug
affect only Windows versions... Maybe there are differences between
versions concerning data types. Do you have any >4 GB binary EnSight 6 or
Gold case to test? I can't (not allowed) to publish my case and it's also
big enough for upload (although theoretically I can do it from my home PC).

I took a look at the code. Te problematic fragment (line 114 in
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader) just checks the file's existance and opens it
in standard way. The problem occures in *stat*() function that is fed with
the full file name and the reference to structure to receive file params. I
tried to read the file from Python shell and the result is the same. I
guessed that the reason is an additional slash before the short file name
(see error message) but small files are processed OK so the only assumption
I can make is that the problem occures in the *stat*() itself on large (>
~2GiB) files due to some strange 32-bit relicts (although itshould work
perfectly in 64-bit builds).
Can anybody test the opening of large (3...4 GiB or more) EnSight Gold
binary files in ParaView 5.0.0 or 5.0.1? I cannot check any assumptions
because I only have Linux compilators set up and cannot do the
"hello-world"-like stat() test under Windows on a large file...

Sorry for many posts, but, I think, I found something interesting (or I
just think so :)). I digged a *stat*() usage in ParaView at official GitHub
source repository. If I get it right, there are two types of this function:
*stat*() and *stat64*(). My only program that deals with large files is a
disk editor & NTFS data recovery for Windows (it's free and was made at
home), this program uses WinAPI, not C/C++ calls for file operations. So I
don't know much about fopen/fclose/stat/e.t.c. on large files. So we have
*stat* and *stat64* + corresponding data structures. We can see an example
in this source:
https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/blob/eae7f4446c867ee9d29b466676fa11282d56dafc/IO/LSDyna/private/LSDynaFamily.cxx
For 64-bit configurations this code uses *stat64()* and *stat64* structure.

But if we look at the problematic place in *EnSight reader* we will only
see the "usual" *stat*() that is, to my current knowledge, is 32 bit:
https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/blob/master/IO/EnSight/vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx
(Please see lines 100 and 101)
May it be the cause of the subj? Sorry if I'm wrong, I'm not a professional
programmer.

Jonas,

Can you try calling

mergBlocks1.UpdatePipeline()

prior to SaveData() and see if that solves the problem?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Neil,

There is nothing that I know of in VTK or ParaView that will convert your
CSV file into a vtkPolyData out of the box. You'll need to create a
vtkPolyData "manually". Please see

http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/IO/ReadPlainTextTriangles

for an example of how to do this in VTK. You can convert this example into
Python and then use the script in a Python Source in ParaView.

HTH,
Cory

Samuel, thanks for your experiment. File with size less than 2 GiB, of
course, can't expose this issue.
I read a bit more about stat() and it turned out that it should work as
64bit if FILE_OFFSET_BITS is set to 64. And it is set in other ParaView
sources but, IMHO, not in EnSight reader. Dear ParaView team, please, take
a look at this, I need to process my big case with Python script in
ParaView...

Is vtkpqApplicationComponent.dll in your PATH environment variable? Perhaps
you had set the PATH in your win7 machine but did not set it on your win10
machine?

Could you detail the errors that are reported?

FWIW, I can run ParaView 5.0 downloaded and installed from the paraview.org
web site on win10 with no problems.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] PV5.0 crash when I trying to open  the  xmf file !
Message-ID: <loom.20160301T170410-921@post.gmane.org>

Hello everyone,

When I open the xmf file (metadata of my .h5) PV5.0 crash !

ERROR: In
/build/paraview-BGG4vx/paraview-5.0.0+dfsg1/ParaViewCore/
ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxy.cxx,
line 310
vtkSISourceProxy (0x3264b90): Failed to create vtkXdmfReader.
Aborting for debugging purposes.

Aborted

With PV 4.3 I opened the .xmf without trouble.
With PV 4.4 I opened the .xmf with some extra setting, I had to put Xdmf
Reader. 

Someone can tell me what I have to change to open these files with PV 5.0

Sorry I tried to copy paste the xmf file but the site don't want, top posting ?

Thank you very much

Hi,

I have downloaded the last version, today, and the problem happens to me
too.  I cant open a 200  Mb tiff in parallel

Do I have to download a different version to have the fix you made?

This change is not merged into the repository yet and hence not
available in 5.0.1 patch release as well. I was hoping someone would
get a change to review/test it before merging it.

Solved the problem by merely using paraview.simple.LoadState instead of 
paraview.servermanager.LoadState (as used in the examples: 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python/Loading_and_saving_state):

https://github.com/romangrothausmann/ParaView_scripts/commit/9c897e34ebf338c709a37e61382e298f9603dc67

This makes me wonder when to use paraview.servermanager.LoadState?
Should the example 
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python/Loading_and_saving_state) be 
changed to use paraview.simple.LoadState?

Still, I cannot get rid of this Warning. Any ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf + hdf5 error in Paraview
Message-ID: <56D6F0F5.5010707@tum.de>

Hallo guys,

have a bug using xdmf + hdf5 in Paraview that I cant seem to solve:

I am trying to visualize my results from a finite element computation 
using xdmf and hdf5.

The results consist of the geometry and topology of the mesh and 
different point and cell data.
I store coordinates of 2 million points in one hdf5 dataset (X,Y,Z 
components) and the connectivity of the resulting 19 million cells ( 
hexagonals and lines ) in a one dimensional hdf5 dataset.

I use the following xdmf file to view the data in paraview

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf>
         <Domain>

                 </Grid>
         </Domain>
</Xdmf>


*Question:* For some strange reason the cell connectivity gets 
completely messed up, and I get a totaly wrong output in Paraview.
I verified the content of the hdf5 file and all the points and cells are 
correct.

The hdf5 is about 5 GB large.

Does anyone know how the cause of this strange behaviour? I tried 
visualizing the content in visIT but got the same error.

thanks in advance

John.

There's really no reason to directly use servermanager.LoadState
except for advanced users. I've updated the Wiki.

>> Also, what to do about this warning:

I wasn't able to reproduce this warning with the attached state file
and your render-view.py script. Any ideas? I am running as follows:

   ./bin/pvpython /tmp/sample.py -i /tmp/sample.pvsm  -png /tmp/foo.png

I'm getting the same warning with Your sample.pvsm. Possibly because I'm still 
using paraview version 4.4.0? I'll give it a try with a newer PV and report back 
if the warning remains.

Thanks again.

To further clarify this statement, these changes won't be available in
ParaView 5.0.1, but the next significant release which will be 5.1
slated for Fall 2016.

I have the same problem. Though in my case it is a small unstructuredgrid
vtu file. The OS is Ubuntu 14.04. ParaView-5.0.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit
prebuilt binaries. The Graphics card is Nvidia Quadro K620 with OpenGL
version 3.02 Nvidia 352.63. The Nvidia settings show the following etensions
amongst others GL_ARB_frame_buffer_object.

Also, it does show artifacts. In particular for a vector allocated to a
standard hexahedron cell, the colors are slightly different within the cell.
You can see triangular segments [possibly tetrahedron?]

Andrew/ Sam,

Thanks for exploring this as much as you did. I am afraid the issue is
not _FILE_OFFSET_BITS flag, however. As far as I can tell, the flag
gets set "globally" when CMake determinees during configure time that
"large file support" is possible. To follow the code here's how it
works:

1. https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L335-340

At the top level, CMake sets up VTK_REQUIRE_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT if
supported by the platform/compiler.

2. https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/master/Common/Core/vtkWin32Header.h#L34-44

This header setups the appropriate values when
VTK_REQUIRE_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT is defined (via vtkConfigure.h). This
header gets included in vtkSystemIncludes.h which gets included in
vtkObjectBase.h hence in all VTK classes. Despite the header name
(vtkWin32Header.h) it gets included on all platforms.

By putting out messages in vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx, I confirmed
that _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is indeed set to 64 bit on my 64bit Mac
machine.

Something else is going on here. Does someone have a >2GB ensight gold
file to share to debug this or know where I can find one?

It seems to me that you are running into a different issue as atleast
you are seeing
something but it does look correct to you. Is that it?

Hi,

Thanks for the bug report. I have a fix for this that's going through
testing right now. It's at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1300 if you want to take
a look and test it out as well. I only tested it with your input so it
could certainly use a bit more testing with other data sets. If you do
that, please let us know how it works.

Best,
Andy

Hi Cory,

Yes, I've had this problem in previous versions. I am currently using 
Paraview v5 and previously used 4.3.1.

Geometry is 1347798 Cells, 3909201 Points and takes up 3.6e+02 MB in 
memory.
Events are around 3039 Cells, 3040 Points and 0.19 MB memory

Not sure if it's important but it takes a similar amount of time if I'm 
running locally on my 4core desktop, or connected to a pvserver using a 
980Ti for rendering.

Thanks,
WT

WT,

That's a decent number of cells and points, but not super big. Can you
provide details on the file format in which you are storing the data?
VTK legacy file in ASCII encoding would be slow to load, for example.

Did you build ParaView in debug mode, by change? That may also explain
the slow data loading.

Is there any sample data you can provide?

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] how to add different annotations to all small views of

Message-ID: <CAFJvLTYoZq=4DhqTRN6jS0TL9hpJrGjJiDYoJtGAx0e+O6H0aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all
Just like the title. I really can't find anyway to add different
annotations to all small views of Comparative view including time series.
The annotate time filter always shows times, but I want to add different
texts such as name of files. Does anyone know how to do it. Thanks in
advance !

The new OpenGL2 backend in 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 did not support vector exports.

You can compile 5.0.0 with VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL to get it back, or
wait till 5.1.0.

Are the connectivity indices numbered starting from zero or staring from
one? Paraview numbers your mesh vertices starting from zero, and if your
element connectivity refers to vertices numbered from 1:n, it will totally
scramble your connectivity when Paraview displays the mesh.

How do I export a screenshot/animation for an anaglphy stereo image?
It renders correctly within Paraview (v's 4x-5x), but when I go to
actually export the animation or screenshot, and select Stereo Mode
"Red-Blue", the resulting image/avi is over printed with purple?

I think what you want is "Analglyph", however I noticed that it's not
exposed in the Save Screenshot dialog. What you can do is this:

1. Start ParaView with  as
   ./bin/paraview --stereo --stereo-type=Anaglyph

2. Then when you choose "Save Screenshot" don't change the "Stereo Type".

Subject: [Paraview] problem with ParaView build
Message-ID: <20160305002829.1B10D66E56@ingleside.caltech.edu>

Two quick followup questions with regard to my previous message:

First, I notice that there's a ParaViewData-v4.4.0.tar.gz file
available for download.  If I grab that and install it before
trying to build ParaView from source, will that get things in
shape so that the makefile won't need to try fetching the .png
files via HTTP?  That might (I hope) solve the problem.

And secondly, I see that ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4.Linux-64bit.tar.gz
exists and is available for download; and files in that tarball
all exist in subdirectories of ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit;
my question is this:  If I use this prebuilt version, does the
top-level ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit directory need to live
in some specified location (i.e. do some things in the hierarchy
make references to other things via a full pathname), or can the
tree be put anywhere (/usr/local, or /opt, or /home/zippy, or ...)?

Thanks again!

Subject: [Paraview] problem with ParaView build
Message-ID: <20160305002351.A316366E56@ingleside.caltech.edu>

G'day ...  This is my first experience with ParaView, so apologies
if my problem has been reported before.  (I looked through archived
mailing list items, but didn't notice anything.)  Anyway ...

I'm trying to build ParaView from source on a Linux system (RHEL5).
I grabbed ParaView-v4.4.0-source.tar.gz and installed prerequisites
that it needed which weren't already on the system (and some of the
prerequisites had prerequisites of their own), but eventually I had
gotten to the point where I was ready to use "ccmake" to configure
things and generate a makefile.  That all went OK (the makefile is
nearly ten thousand lines long; yow!), but then when I started the
"make", it hit a snag almost immediately.  The first message that
it emitted said ...

	Scanning dependencies of target ParaViewData

... and then it started downloading various .png files.  The first
of these went fine ...

Generating /panfs/ds08/support/INSTALL/ParaView/ParaView-v4.4.0-source/build/ExternalData/Testing/Data/Baseline/pqCoreBasicApp.png

... as did the second through sixth.  But when it tried to grab the
seventh one, it had a problem:

However, if I do a "wget" of the www.paraview.org URLs, those all do
in fact succeed in downloading the .png file, until that seventh one;
for that, I get this:

--2016-03-04 16:09:39--  http://www.paraview.org/files/ExternalData/MD5/175bb7beec559a9c3c31fbcdba7fc629

So has that file inadvertently been changed to be nonreadable by the
www.paraview.org server?

Thanks for whatever suggestions any of you might have ...

Mark,

If you not planning on running tests, it may be easiest to just turn
off BUILD_TESTING cmake flag and then build to avoid these errors. All
the baselines and datafiles needed for testing are downloaded during
the build step when testing is enabled.

Subject: [Paraview] how to add different annotations to all small views

Is the information you want to label with available in some array in
the dataset e.g. field data arrays? If so, you can use a filter like
"Annotate Attribute Data" or "Annotate Global Data" to produce text
for each view that uses data arrays and since that'd differ between
views, your labels would too.

Hi,

Can you use a different controller that has the same MPI processes assigned
to it? If that works for you, you should be able to just create a
vtkMPIController and use either CreateSubController() or
PartitionController() to create one similar to what you want. Note that you
may need to create two vtkMPIControllers, one that corresponds to
MPI_COMM_WORLD and one for your partitioning. After you've done that you
can use the vtkMPIController::SetGlobalController() to have VTK and
ParaView use that for interprocess communication.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Apply isovolume filter using Python
Message-ID: <CAAstK2ECog_hn3dT4vd=v66MCf=zfqXQcrkC491+MtTXDXeFWA@mail.gmail.com>

I am making a programmable source filter to read date file and apply
IsoVolume filter but it is producing Error.


Following is my Python Code:

<code>

from paraview import servermanager
from paraview.simple import Show,Render
from paraview.simple import OpenDataFile
from paraview.simple import IsoVolume

servermanager.Connect()
reader = OpenDataFile("/home/metal-machine/Desktop/11.vts")
IsoVolume(reader,'0.25','0.75')

</code>




The error I got is as follows:

<error>


Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 19, in <module>

File "<string>", line 8, in RequestData

File "/home/metal-machine/para/lib/paraview-5.0/site-packages/paraview/simple.py",
line 1529, in CreateObject

raise RuntimeError, "Expecting a proxy as input."

RuntimeError: Expecting a proxy as input.



</error>

Am I missing something?

Hi WT,

You may be running into an issue that can come up with the OpenGL2
renderer in ParaView 5. Please see section 2.2.3 in the GeantToVTK
plugin page: https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/geanttovtk/wiki/Wiki

I have quoted that section here for convenience:

[begin quote]
The output of the GeantToVTK plugin is a vtkMultiBlockDataSet, which
is a hierarchical structure of vtkPolyData objects. ParaView version 5
has a new renderer using OpenGL2 that is extremely fast and is used
when a vtkMultiBlockDataSet is homogeneous. A vtkMultiBlockDataSet is
homogeneous when all of the constituentvtkPolyData objects within have
the same list of attributes. That is if one vtkPolyData object has a
Normals vector, then all of the objects should. Or none at all should.
AllvtkPolyData objects need to have the same list of attributes (e.g.
scalar point data).

The vtkMultiBlockDataSet from GeantToVTK is heterogeneous. Some
vtkPolyData have Normal vectors, others don't. Some have particular
attributes, like color and density; others don't. This situation
occurs because the vtkMultiBlockDataSet follows the Geant4
visualization output. Some Geant objects have particular attributes
and others don't. The consequence is that a slow generic renderer is
used. For a complicated geometry, the generic renderer could be so
slow as to make ParaView unusable. Note that this situation only
affects ParaView v5. ParaView v4 uses an OpenGL1 renderer. The fast
OpenGL2 renderer can be many times faster though, and so it is useful
to upgrade to ParaView v5.

The Normalize a multi-block dataset filter makes a heterogeneous
vtkMultiBlockDataSet homogeneous by adding missing attributes to the
vtkPolyData with appropriate defaults. The resulting
vtkMultiBlockDataSet should trigger the fast renderer. This fast
renderer is anywhere from 20x - 200x faster than the generic renderer.
[end quote]

Would you mind trying this "Normalize a multi-block dataset" filter
and see if that improves the animation speed?

Thanks,
Cory

You're using a mix of advanced & simple API which is causing this
issue. Change your code as follows:

<code>

from paraview.simple import Show,Render
from paraview.simple import OpenDataFile
from paraview.simple import IsoVolume

reader = OpenDataFile("/home/metal-machine/Desktop/11.vts")
IsoVolume(reader,'0.25','0.75')

Subject: [Paraview] Issues with ParticlePath filter
Message-ID: <CAEhu9hCpJ+AOiLfAmHG8ZgiRjWV5Mg7ZDQeYfkVTCLquCsjKbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Version: Paraview 4.4 64-bit on Windows 8 installed from binaries

I've been playing around with the ParticlePath filter and it's been a bit
of a frustrating experience because it seems to crash all the time.  I
think I've identified two sources of the crashing:

1) It crashes when there are no particles left.  I tested this by setting
the Force Injection parameter to zero and nonzero values.  This is an
issue, since sometimes I just want to follow an initial set of particles
without cluttering it with new particles.  So in order to do that now, I
would have to carefully step the end time until it crashes, and then reload
the state.

2) It crashes if the end time is beyond what Paraview *thinks* is the last
time step.  This is an issue because I use the Temporal Interpolator to
create periodic data with multiple cycles and for some reason it seems like
ParticlePath does not take the periodicity into account.  I tested this by
first using ParticlePath directly after Temporal Interpolator and then
using ParticlePath after exporting the interpolated data and importing it
into a new session.  In the first case, it will crash after the end of the
first cycle.  In the second case, it will (usually) make it through both
cycles without crashing.

So there are workarounds both issues, but the workflow seems more
cumbersome than it should be.  So I guess my question is, is there a
better/smarter way to use the ParticlePath filter than the way I'm using
it?  Maybe a "best practices" guide?

Additionally, is there way to start the pathlines from a specific time
point instead of the initial one?

Thanks,
Evan Kao

Hey Utkarsh it is still causing the same error.

Utkarsh,

Are there any updates to the Surface LIC issues with ParaView 5.0.x /
OpenGL2?

Is there a Bug that I should be following for this issue?

My group uses Surface LIC a fair amount and we're encouraged by the
performance increase of 5.0 over 4.4 so we'd really like to make the
transition.

Thank you,

I am afraid not. It's still on the TODO list. BTW, the issues with LIC
& OpenGL2 only affect cases with parallel rendering on more than 1
rank. If you're not using it in such a setup, you should be able to
switch to OpenGL2/5.0 without problem.

Utkarsh,

I have now tested a 5.0.0 install with the tiff patch applied (thanks Dave), and the multi-page tiff reader appears to be working as expected, both serial and in parallel.

Hi Evan,

I just tried replicating those issues with PV 5.0 and didn't see the crash
with either case 1 or 2. If you can share a data set and pv state file that
replicates the issue with 5.0 I can take a deeper look at this.

As for starting pathlines from a specific point in time instead of the
initial one, two quick thoughts here:

   1. Can you avoid loading in time steps?
   2. You could set the reinjection frequency such that particles get
   reinjected at your specific time and then use threshold on the particle
   InjectionStepId to get rid of particles you don't want. It may be a bit of
   wasted computation but easy to get results this way.

Cheers,

Andy

Other thing I just found that following piece of code without
threshold works fine but I have to manually change the values from the
interface. I am using Paraview version 5

<code>

from paraview.simple import Show,Render
from paraview.simple import OpenDataFile
from paraview.simple import IsoVolume

reader = OpenDataFile("/home/metal-machine/Desktop/11.vts")
IsoVolume(reader)

</code>

Is there any other way to pass min and maximum threshold values to IsoVolume()?

Thanks, Joe. How critical is it for this change to be in 5.0.1? I'd
like to add a test for the MR before merging it, but not sure I can
get that in  soon.

Hi Andy,

 

Thank you for your feedback, it helped me solve my problem.

 

If anyone is having a similar problem, what I ended up doing is:

import mpi4py.MPI as MPI

import vtk

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

rank = comm.Get_rank()

size = comm.Get_size()

in_subcomm = [0,3,6,9] # list of ranks to include in the VTK communicator

subcomm = comm.Split(1 if rank in in_subcomm else 0,rank)

#--- In another part of the program called only by the procs in in_subcomm

vtkComm = vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK(subcomm)

vtkCont = vtk.vtkMPIController()

vtkCont.SetCommunicator(vtkComm)

vtk.vtkMPIController.SetGlobalController(vtkCont)

 

Due to the way my application works, I had to split the communicator myself, i.e. without using CreateSubController() or PartitionController() because vtk is loaded only by some procs and not every single one (a Mpi_Comm_split operation would therefore be impossible to do).

Hi,

Can you use a different controller that has the same MPI processes assigned to it? If that works for you, you should be able to just create a vtkMPIController and use either CreateSubController() or PartitionController() to create one similar to what you want. Note that you may need to create two vtkMPIControllers, one that corresponds to MPI_COMM_WORLD and one for your partitioning. After you've done that you can use the vtkMPIController::SetGlobalController() to have VTK and ParaView use that for interprocess communication.

Best,

Andy

Hi,

 

I?m working on a Catalyst adaptor written in Python for one of the CFD codes I use at work and I?m having trouble setting the MPI communicator I want the vtkCPProcessor object to use (in order to use a subset of MPI_COMM_WORLD). The MPI communicator I create is a mpi4py.MPI_Comm object, which I convert to a vtkMPICommunicator object using vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK. However vtk.vtkPVCatalystPython.vtkCPProcessor.Initialize is expecting a vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm object and there does not seem to be a way for me to create such an object from the Python interface. Am I missing something here or is something not wrapped correctly or wrong?

 

For the moment I use mpi4py.MPI.COMM_WORLD to test everything. The following minimal example replicates my problem:

import mpi4py.MPI

import vtk

comm = mpi4py.MPI.COMM_WORLD

coprocessor = vtk.vtkPVCatalystPython.vtkCPProcessor()

coprocessor.Initialize(vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK(comm))

The last line fails with this message:

TypeError: Initialize argument 1: method requires a vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm, a vtkMPICommunicator was provided.

 

I hope I post on the right mailing list as this could actually be a problem in VTK.

 

Thank you for your help.

 

Best,

Yohann V.

For us, having the patch available was really important. Now that we have it and can patch our production install, I'd say having it included in 5.0.1 is less critical.

Thanks

Hi,

I am not sure how I can superimpose an original configuration on a deformed configuration so that one can see visually how the body deforms.  This is for a structures problem.  Could not find it in the manual and I have tried a number of things.


Thanks,

Bud Brust

Thanks, Joe. How critical is it for this change to be in 5.0.1? I'd like to add a test for the MR before merging it, but not sure I can get that in  soon.

I didn't but I didn't have to :). Your investigation lead me to in the
right direction -- it just wasn't FILE_OFFSET_BITS that was the issue.
It was the fact that on Windows the stat function is different,
period. I am hoping to push a fix in for 5.0.1.

Hi Bud,

Please start a new thread on the mailing list unless this is closely
related to the multi-page tiff in parallel problem. When you do ask, a
little more context would be helpful. Is this a time varying data set, what
file format etc.

thanks

Hi Yohann,

Glad to hear that you were able to get it working! By the way, what
simulation code are you instrumenting to use Catalyst if you don't mind
saying? I'd be interested to know how it works for you.

Best,
Andy

This merge request should address this issue:

Once it's tested, reviewed etc. it'll be merged and I'll have it
updated in ParaView release 5.0.1 as well.

Message-ID: <D306DDD4.3009C%j.young@qut.edu.au>

Can the PV 'Find Data?' command be used to search attribute data of type string?
The specific case I have is the Protein Data Bank Reader which returns the point data attribute called 'atom_types'.
It contains atom names such as 'N' or 'C' or 'O' etc. I'd like to search and extract point data based on the 'atom_types' string.
For example atom_types == 'O' - but this returns an error (see below).
Any help or pointers greatly appreciated.
Joe Young.

P.S. The specific error code is:


Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 8, in <module>

File "<string>", line 5, in vtkPythonExtractSelection_RequestData

File "/Applications/paraview_4_3_1.app/Contents/Python/paraview/extract_selection.py", line 88, in execute

(query, type(maskArray))

RuntimeError: Expression 'atom_types == 'O'' did not produce a valid mask array. The value produced is of the type '<type 'bool'>'. This typically implies a malformed expression. Verify that the expression is valid.

Hi Andy,

 

I?m using elsA, a CFD package developed by ONERA in France. I was given a few links by the project manager if you want more information about the software:

?             An Overview of the Multi-Purpose elsA Flow Solver (http://www.aerospacelab-journal.org/sites/www.aerospacelab-journal.org/files/AL2-10.pdf)

?             Advanced Aerodynamic Applications with the elsA Software (http://www.aerospacelab-journal.org/sites/www.aerospacelab-journal.org/files/AL2-12.pdf)

?             The Onera elsA CFD software : input from research and feedback from industry - L. Cambier, S. Heib, S. Plot - Mechanics & Industry, 2013

 

elsA is written in C++ (plus some Fortran routines) but possesses a user interface in Python. I?m using a mechanism in the code that calls a Python script when the internal finish state machine changes state (e.g.: at each increment, before the computation, at the end, ?).

 

Hope that answers your question. Let me know if you want more information ;).

 

 

Yohann

Hi Andy,

 

Thank you for your feedback, it helped me solve my problem.

 

If anyone is having a similar problem, what I ended up doing is:

import mpi4py.MPI as MPI

import vtk

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

rank = comm.Get_rank()

size = comm.Get_size()

in_subcomm = [0,3,6,9] # list of ranks to include in the VTK communicator

subcomm = comm.Split(1 if rank in in_subcomm else 0,rank)

#--- In another part of the program called only by the procs in in_subcomm

vtkComm = vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK(subcomm)

vtkCont = vtk.vtkMPIController()

vtkCont.SetCommunicator(vtkComm)

vtk.vtkMPIController.SetGlobalController(vtkCont)

 

Due to the way my application works, I had to split the communicator myself, i.e. without using CreateSubController() or PartitionController() because vtk is loaded only by some procs and not every single one (a Mpi_Comm_split operation would therefore be impossible to do).

Hi,

Can you use a different controller that has the same MPI processes assigned to it? If that works for you, you should be able to just create a vtkMPIController and use either CreateSubController() or PartitionController() to create one similar to what you want. Note that you may need to create two vtkMPIControllers, one that corresponds to MPI_COMM_WORLD and one for your partitioning. After you've done that you can use the vtkMPIController::SetGlobalController() to have VTK and ParaView use that for interprocess communication.

Best,

Andy

Hi,

 

I?m working on a Catalyst adaptor written in Python for one of the CFD codes I use at work and I?m having trouble setting the MPI communicator I want the vtkCPProcessor object to use (in order to use a subset of MPI_COMM_WORLD). The MPI communicator I create is a mpi4py.MPI_Comm object, which I convert to a vtkMPICommunicator object using vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK. However vtk.vtkPVCatalystPython.vtkCPProcessor.Initialize is expecting a vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm object and there does not seem to be a way for me to create such an object from the Python interface. Am I missing something here or is something not wrapped correctly or wrong?

 

For the moment I use mpi4py.MPI.COMM_WORLD to test everything. The following minimal example replicates my problem:

import mpi4py.MPI

import vtk

comm = mpi4py.MPI.COMM_WORLD

coprocessor = vtk.vtkPVCatalystPython.vtkCPProcessor()

coprocessor.Initialize(vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK(comm))

The last line fails with this message:

TypeError: Initialize argument 1: method requires a vtkMPICommunicatorOpaqueComm, a vtkMPICommunicator was provided.

 

I hope I post on the right mailing list as this could actually be a problem in VTK.

 

Thank you for your help.

 

Best,

Yohann V.

Hi Yohann,

Thanks for the info!

If you get some interesting results it would be great if you could share
it. We've recently created some highlighted applications that use Catalyst
at http://www.paraview.org/catalyst-adaptors/. If you'd like to have a
section there on elsA, I'd be more than happy to add it in.

Best,
Andy

Hi,

Regarding the initial problem, would it be useful to add a new method
Initialize(vtkMPICommunicator* comm) to vtkCPProcessor? - it should be
quite straightforward to do.

Best,
Joachim

I'm trying to configure ParaView for use with OSMesa. I've successfully
built OSMesa and now I'm trying to build ParaView. I based my cmake options

Any help or insight would be much appreciated. Here is the output in it's

Add `-DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF` to you cmake command line. That'll
disable the downloading of test datasets and void this error.

Cool. Thanks for the info. I'll merge this in cleanly once I catch up
with some of my todo list :).

Message-ID: <000901d17b86$efd876f0$cf8964d0$@usc.es>

Hi:

 

We've installed ParaviewWeb 5.0 in a configuration of two machines: Apache
on one machine (Ubuntu 14.04), and the launcher and the ParaViewWeb
processes on a second machine (Ubuntu 15.10). We've the problem that when
trying to access the Visualizer ('Post-processing' link at index.html) the
'.../apps/Visualizer' tab opens but we receive the error 'WebSocket
connection failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response
code: 404'. We've tested before the same ParaviewWeb only in one machine
(Ubuntu 15.10) and it worked fine. Could someone help us please?

 

Regards:

 

Gabriel.

Alas, no. string arrays are currently not supported by "Find Data".

Ivan,

Alas this is not currently supported in ParaView. ParaView doesn't
have a CGNS writer yet.

Hi Gabriel,

do you mind sharing (privately if you prefer) your apache config as well as
your launcher config?

Thanks,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel visualizations of Xdmf datasets
Message-ID: <000c01d17bba$2662fcd0$7328f670$@lucas@gantha.com>

Hi everyone,

 

I am trying to use ParaView for parallel visualizations. I have successfully compiled ParaView 4.3.1 and tested it by creating a sphere on several processors and visualizing the Process Ids.

 

When reading an Xdmf file however, it seems that only one processor is loading the data: am I correct in assuming that this is the normal behavior for unstructured datasets ? I used the D3 filter to do some load-balancing after reading the data, but I don't know if this is necessary for subsequent filters to work in parallel ?

 

Also, it seems from the memory inspector that ParaView duplicates the memory footprint of the data on each processor, which quickly becomes a problem for large datasets. Is this the expected behavior, or does it depend on the reader/data format ?

 

Any information on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Jean-Michel

I am trying to read multiple files and save in PNG format, but I am
getting lot of errors.

My code is here: http://pastebin.com/jGyapMwe

I want to "render and save" all the vts files present in list into png files.

If I need to create parallel processing pipelines please let me know
where I have to look, Is there any example-code available for reading
and rendering multiple files together?

?I'm trying to use VTK in python to edit a `.stl` file using the `vtkBoxWidget`. I'm reading the `.stl` file, editing it with the `vtkBoxWidget` by using the mouse/drag in the window interactor and in the end I want to write the new data to a new `.stl` when hitting a certain key.
Here's the code I've been working on:
? ? #!/usr/bin/env python? ??? ? import vtk? ? import sys? ? import os? ??? ? filename = "file.stl"? ? # render the data? ? reader = vtk.vtkSTLReader()? ? reader.SetFileName(filename)? ? ??? ? stlMapper = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()? ? stlMapper.SetInputConnection(reader.GetOutputPort())? ??? ? # create an actor for our scene? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??? ? stlActor = vtk.vtkActor()? ? stlActor.SetMapper(stlMapper)? ??? ??? ??? ? ren = vtk.vtkRenderer()? ? renWin = vtk.vtkRenderWindow()? ? renWin.AddRenderer(ren)? ? iren = vtk.vtkRenderWindowInteractor()? ? iren.SetRenderWindow(renWin)? ??? ? # The box widget observes the events invoked by the render window? ? # interactor. ?These events come from user interaction in the render? ? # window.? ? boxWidget = vtk.vtkBoxWidget()? ? boxWidget.SetInteractor(iren)? ? boxWidget.SetPlaceFactor(1.25)? ??? ? # Add the actors to the renderer, set the background and window size.? ? ren.AddActor(stlActor)? ? ren.SetBackground(0.1, 0.2, 0.4)? ? renWin.SetSize(300, 300)? ??? ? # As the box widget is interacted with, it produces a transformation? ? # matrix that is set on the actor.? ? t = vtk.vtkTransform()? ? def TransformActor(obj, event):? ? ? ? global t, stlActor? ? ? ? obj.GetTransform(t)? ? ? ? stlActor.SetUserTransform(t)? ??? ? def onKeyPressEvent(self, renderer):? ? ? ? key = self.GetKeyCode()? ? ? ? if(key=='l'):? ? ? ? ? ? print stlActor.GetBounds()? ? ? ? ? ? if(os.path.isfile("done.stl")==1):? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? os.remove("done.stl")? ? ? ? ? ? print stlActor.GetMapper().GetInput().GetBounds()? ? ? ? ? ? stlPolyData = stlActor.GetMapper().GetInput()? ? ? ? ? ? writer = vtk.vtkSTLWriter()? ? ? ? ? ? writer.SetFileName("done.stl")? ? ? ? ? ? writer.AddInputDataObject(stlPolyData)? ? ? ? ? ? writer.Write()? ? # Place the interactor initially. The actor is used to place and scale? ? # the interactor. An observer is added to the box widget to watch for? ? # interaction events. This event is captured and used to set the? ? # transformation matrix of the actor.? ? boxWidget.SetProp3D(stlActor)? ? boxWidget.PlaceWidget()? ? boxWidget.AddObserver("InteractionEvent", TransformActor)? ? iren.AddObserver('KeyPressEvent', onKeyPressEvent)? ??? ? iren.Initialize()? ? renWin.Render()? ? iren.Start()
The problem is that I have no idea how to update the `vtkPolyData` or pass the transformations I applied to `vtkActor` to the `vtkPolyData`. In the code above, I tested this with the .GetBounds() in the two print functions. Originally the object had Bounds:
? ? (-2.0, 2.0, 0.0, 1.625, -1.5, 1.8125)
After updating, the actor Bounds changed, but I can't pass all those properties to the vtkPolyData.
? ? (-2.1331110248939638, 2.246371570191821, -1.5743578447908013, 2.5817210301577385, -2.1311284932847796, 2.0695034726591715)? ? (-2.0, 2.0, 0.0, 1.625, -1.5, 1.8125)

Thanks!

Hi,

 

                No problem. I am attaching my Apache and launcher configurations? The VirtualHost is defined in front-end machine, and launcher configuration file of the second machine.

 

Regards,

 

                               Gabriel.

Hi Gabriel,

 

do you mind sharing (privately if you prefer) your apache config as well as your launcher config?

 

Thanks,

 

Seb

Hi:

 

We've installed ParaviewWeb 5.0 in a configuration of two machines: Apache on one machine (Ubuntu 14.04), and the launcher and the ParaViewWeb processes on a second machine (Ubuntu 15.10). We've the problem that when trying to access the Visualizer ('Post-processing' link at index.html) the '.../apps/Visualizer' tab opens but we receive the error 'WebSocket connection failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 404'. We've tested before the same ParaviewWeb only in one machine (Ubuntu 15.10) and it worked fine. Could someone help us please?

 

Regards:

 

Gabriel.

Hi
I applied the annotation filter algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])),but I ended up with an error in the render view and output message stating thatAttributeError:'None Type' object has no attribute 'GetCellData'. Does any oneknow what is the problem ?

I am using Paraview 5.0.0 64-bit, I want to install scipy and for that
I have copied scipy source in

"Paraview/lib/paraview-5.0/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scipy" but I am
still not able to use scipy from paraview Python shell.

Do I need to install any specific version of scipy?

Hi Islem,

Sorry for the late reply. I've been swamped lately.

Thank you for the detailed explanation of what you are doing. That really
helps us narrow down what might be going on.

I'm not sure what the problem is. I have a simple pipeline example where
this works:

Sphere source -> Delaunay3D -> Python Annotation filter

The Delaunay3D filter produces an unstructured grid, from which I am able
to get the volumes.

I suspect ParaView readds your OpenFOAM data set as a multiblock data set?
Could you look at the Info panel and report it's Type. It should be the
first item under the "Statistics" sub-section.

If it is indeed a multiblock data set, please try this:

Place a MergeBlocks filter between your Threshold filter and Python
Annotation filter.

Please see if that works. If it does, we'll move on to multiplying the
volume by the water fraction.

Thanks,
Cory

Your launcher config should be as follow:

"sessionURL": "ws://${ApacheHost_or_IP}:8088/proxy?sessionId=${id}",

Assuming that /var/visor/mapping/proxy.txt is the same file (network
shared) with /mnt/nfs/mapping/proxy.txt.

One more thing: you should be able to change the Python expression to

sum(volume(inputs[0]))

I don't think it works that way. I'd guess scipy has compiled code
that needs to built. It's be easiest to just build ParaView from
source and make it use the system python. That way you can then
install Python packages locally using your linux distribution and
those will be available within pypython.

You would need to either build scipy against ParaView's python or build
ParaView against system python and install scipy in that system python.
Otherwise you are likely to get strange behaviors if the python versions
don't match.  I would recommend building ParaView against the system python
since Scipy's build system is difficult.

Shawn

Your launcher config should be as follow:

 

"sessionURL": "ws://${ApacheHost_or_IP}:8088/proxy?sessionId=${id}",

 

Assuming that /var/visor/mapping/proxy.txt is the same file (network shared) with /mnt/nfs/mapping/proxy.txt.

We've the problem that when trying to access the Visualizer ('Post-processing' link at index.html) the '.../apps/Visualizer' tab opens but we receive the error 'WebSocket connection failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 404'. We've tested before the same ParaviewWeb only in one machine (Ubuntu 15.10) and it worked fine. Could someone help us please?

What dataset are you using? Can you try reproducing the same with one
of the "Sources" or datasets in ParaViewData or sharing a sample
dataset to reproduce it? Attached state file works for me.

Subject: [Paraview] New user - install Paraview 5.0 on CentOS 6
Message-ID: <CAOOC-XpEkkPmnOwn84US+WYf1Z639Rem+ca2aZmjwvM1J3Ow-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We are evaluating new visualization softwares.
We successfully install a paraview 5.0 on windows and linux (windows slow
and not stable).
On Linux Local and Remote pvserver (on the same computer) graphical install
is ok and working on 1core

Next step is to test multiCores on local. i read the doc (which speak only
about PV v4 ...) and see that we have to compile pvserver with a cmake, QT,
OpenGL, Python and MPI. Here start the problem :)

Environment :
- CentOS 6.7
- Specific components :

   - cmake ? 2.8.12.2-4.el6
   - MPI ? openmpi 1.8.1-1.el6
   - openGL ? (nvidia drivers opengl)
   - QT 4.7/4.8 ? QT 4.6.2 only on Centos 6 => have to manually compile !!!
   ( and which version ?)
   - Python 2.7 + Numpy + Matplotlib ? default available : python 2.6.6-64
   / numpy 1.4.1-9 / python-matplotlib 0.99.1.2-1.el6

1st try failed because of QT 4.6 (asking 4.7+)

/////

Questions :

- Is there an updated documentation for Paraview V5 (html, wiki and pdf all
stop at v4.4 or v4.3) ?

- which version of QT use ?  from sources i can take 4.7, 4.8.3 4.8.x+,
5.x+ and try to compile.

- All those operations needs many manual tasks and manage. is there some
standard compiled package for a standard Centos6 config ? (currently i used
only Basic rpm packages form the distribution).

- Final goal is to test with pvbatch on a cluster. Do we'll have to do all
those operations for pvbatch on a cluster ?

- We have some decent Workstations with Graphic Cards, is there a reason to
try install pvserver+mpi on a cluster with nodes without Graphic cards ?


thx by advance,

David CHALON

Thanks for your feedback and I'm glad that's working as expected now.

The updated version of that documentation is now available here:

Hi Islem,

Please see my followup (sent today) to your original post for an
explanation of what I think is going on.

Hi Cory,
Thank you for your email. I tried that example sphere source -> Delaunay3D -> Python Annotation filter and it works fine. I set the python expression to ?algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])) and then to?sum(volume(inputs[0])) and it works in both cases.?The type from the information panel is Table.
But, it turns out that for my case the problem is with the Python expression, when I use this expression algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])) I get errors while this expression sum(volume(inputs[0])) solves the problem. The type from the information panel is Table.
Can I ask what does inputs[0] mean in the python expression. I have no background in python, that's why the expression seems odd to me.
Regards,Islem Megdiche

 One more thing: you should be able to change the Python expression to
sum(volume(inputs[0]))

Hi Islem,
Sorry for the late reply. I've been swamped lately.
Thank you for the detailed explanation of what you are doing. That really helps us narrow down what might be going on.
I'm not sure what the problem is. I have a simple pipeline example where this works:
Sphere source -> Delaunay3D -> Python Annotation filter
The Delaunay3D filter produces an unstructured grid, from which I am able to get the volumes.
I suspect ParaView readds your OpenFOAM data set as a multiblock data set? Could you look at the Info panel and report it's Type. It should be the first item under the "Statistics" sub-section.
If it is indeed a multiblock data set, please try this:
Place a MergeBlocks filter between your Threshold filter and Python Annotation filter.
Please see if that works. If it does, we'll move on to multiplying the volume by the water fraction.
Thanks,Cory

 Hi Islem,

Please reply-all to keep the discussion on the list so that others may
benefit from the discussion.

First, is there a data array that describes whether a volume element
in your mesh contains water or some other element? If so, you can use
the Threshold filter under the Filters -> Alphabetical -> Threshold
menu to select only the elements representing water. You will have to
set the minimum and maximum to the value that represents water, then
click Apply.

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

 

We needed to change:

?configuration?:

?host?: ?localhost?

by:

?configuration?:

?host?: ?${Paraview_IP}?

 

In the launcher configuration file in order to get it working. It would be neccesary to correct it in updated documentation?

 

 

Regards,

 

                               Gabriel.

Your launcher config should be as follow:

 

"sessionURL": "ws://${ApacheHost_or_IP}:8088/proxy?sessionId=${id}",

 

Assuming that /var/visor/mapping/proxy.txt is the same file (network shared) with /mnt/nfs/mapping/proxy.txt.

localhost should work for the launcher unless you have several network
interface.

Moreover, you can use the launcher to issue ssh command to start paraview
on other machines, in which case the host, is not the paraview one.

Would it make more sense if ${launcher_hostname_or_ip_or_localhost}?

Ok, in our case Paraview and ?launcher? are in the same machine. But we have ?two machines? launching configuration and perhaps ?localhost? points to ?lo? network interface instead ?eth0?, and doesn?t work. With ${launcher_IP} is ok?

 

Thanks again,

 

                               Gabriel.

localhost should work for the launcher unless you have several network interface.

 

Moreover, you can use the launcher to issue ssh command to start paraview on other machines, in which case the host, is not the paraview one.

 

Would it make more sense if ${launcher_hostname_or_ip_or_localhost}?

Hi,

 

We needed to change:

?configuration?:

?host?: ?localhost?

by:

?configuration?:

?host?: ?${Paraview_IP}?

 

In the launcher configuration file in order to get it working. It would be neccesary to correct it in updated documentation?

Thanks for your feedback and I'm glad that's working as expected now.

 

The updated version of that documentation is now available here:

Your launcher config should be as follow:

 

"sessionURL": "ws://${ApacheHost_or_IP}:8088/proxy?sessionId=${id}",

 

Assuming that /var/visor/mapping/proxy.txt is the same file (network shared) with /mnt/nfs/mapping/proxy.txt.

Hi Gabriel,

 

do you mind sharing (privately if you prefer) your apache config as well as your launcher config?

 

Thanks,

 selected cell-centered data array
Message-ID: <085b6bae1ad144dea839db99c498c142@MAR190n2.marin.local>

Hi,

In the latest build (5.0.1-RC1-213-g16385fa), when the Threshold filter is used on cell-centered data arrays, the button ?Reset to current data values? (two arrows next to minimum/maximum text boxes) does not update the min/max values to the new data range when a different scalars array is selected. When using point-centered data arrays, this problem does not occur.

Best wishes,

Islem,

Thanks for reporting back which worked. I'm not sure why the expression
without the "algs." doesn't work - in any case, I'm glad it is working for
you now.

The "inputs[0]" simply means the first element in the inputs list. The
index lets you pick the input (there can be more than one). You could also
simply use "input", which gives you the same element as "inputs[0]".

Hey Cory,
Thank you for your email. Can I get some hints about how can I multiply each cell volume with ?the water fraction.?

 Islem,
Thanks for reporting back which worked. I'm not sure why the expression without the "algs." doesn't work - in any case, I'm glad it is working for you now.
The "inputs[0]" simply means the first element in the inputs list. The index lets you pick the input (there can be more than one). You could also simply use "input", which gives you the same element as "inputs[0]".

Hi Cory,
Thank you for your email. I tried that example sphere source -> Delaunay3D -> Python Annotation filter and it works fine. I set the python expression to ?algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])) and then to?sum(volume(inputs[0])) and it works in both cases.?The type from the information panel is Table.
But, it turns out that for my case the problem is with the Python expression, when I use this expression algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])) I get errors while this expression sum(volume(inputs[0])) solves the problem. The type from the information panel is Table.
Can I ask what does inputs[0] mean in the python expression. I have no background in python, that's why the expression seems odd to me.

 One more thing: you should be able to change the Python expression to

Hi Islem,
Sorry for the late reply. I've been swamped lately.
Thank you for the detailed explanation of what you are doing. That really helps us narrow down what might be going on.
I'm not sure what the problem is. I have a simple pipeline example where this works:
Sphere source -> Delaunay3D -> Python Annotation filter
The Delaunay3D filter produces an unstructured grid, from which I am able to get the volumes.
I suspect ParaView readds your OpenFOAM data set as a multiblock data set? Could you look at the Info panel and report it's Type. It should be the first item under the "Statistics" sub-section.
If it is indeed a multiblock data set, please try this:
Place a MergeBlocks filter between your Threshold filter and Python Annotation filter.
Please see if that works. If it does, we'll move on to multiplying the volume by the water fraction.
Thanks,Cory

 Hi Islem,

Please reply-all to keep the discussion on the list so that others may
benefit from the discussion.

First, is there a data array that describes whether a volume element
in your mesh contains water or some other element? If so, you can use
the Threshold filter under the Filters -> Alphabetical -> Threshold
menu to select only the elements representing water. You will have to
set the minimum and maximum to the value that represents water, then
click Apply.

HTH,
Cory

Yes!

Assuming your cell fraction is cell data named "alpha", use the following
expression in your annotation filter:

sum(alpha*volume(input))

Make sure you set the Array Association property to Cell Data.

Let me know if that works or not.

Thanks,
Cory

Hadrien,

Something's not exactly right with the build of ParaView you're using.
When I try to open the dataset with 5.0.0 binaries from paraview.org,
it opens fine when "Xdmf Reader"  is selected in the Select Reader
dialog (fails with Xdmf3 Reader).

Can you try the binaries from paraview.org to confirm?

Thanks
Utkarsh

Menno Deij - van Rijswijk,

I've been unable to replicate the problem you are describing. I just downloaded the build you described on my Mac, loaded the disk_out_ref data set, and used the threshold filter. When I change between point and cell data, the reset min/max button works just fine in both instances. Can you perhaps provide some more information to help narrow down the problem?

Hi,

In the latest build (5.0.1-RC1-213-g16385fa), when the Threshold filter is used on cell-centered data arrays, the button "Reset to current data values" (two arrows next to minimum/maximum text boxes) does not update the min/max values to the new data range when a different scalars array is selected. When using point-centered data arrays, this problem does not occur.

Subject: [Paraview] Changing Catalyst Live host after initialization
Message-ID: <201603161555.u2GFtggG007670@msw1.awe.co.uk>

Good afternoon all,

I am currently instrumenting a simulation using ParaView Catalyst Live (version 4.4.0), and I was wondering whether there is a way to change the host during the simulation run, after it has already been initialized.

I am using a Python script pipeline (in a Fortran simulation), and am calling:
    coprocessorinitializewithpython("coproc.py", 9)
and the host is specified in coproc.py using:
    coprocessor.DoLiveVisualization(datadescription, host, port_number).

I have tried calling coprocessorfinalize then calling coprocessorinitialize again with a different script but it causes the simulation to fail with a bunch of warnings and errors. I'm happy to supply more information if required.

Is there a way of changing the host, or is it fixed after it is first set?

Many thanks,
Jim

I have seen cases where something gets messed up in the configuration files.  Try running ParaView with the -dr option (disable registry), or you could just delete the configuration files.  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files

Hey Cory,
I tried the expression?sum(alpha*volume(input)), I got an error saying that alpha is not defined. I changed the?expression to?sum(alpha.water*volume(input))?because the water fraction ?is written in file alpha.water but again I got the same errors. You find attached snapshots that illustrate that.

 Yes!
Assuming your cell fraction is cell data named "alpha", use the following expression in your annotation filter:
sum(alpha*volume(input))
Make sure you set the Array Association property to Cell Data.
Let me know if that works or not.
Thanks,Cory

 Islem,
Thanks for reporting back which worked. I'm not sure why the expression without the "algs." doesn't work - in any case, I'm glad it is working for you now.
The "inputs[0]" simply means the first element in the inputs list. The index lets you pick the input (there can be more than one). You could also simply use "input", which gives you the same element as "inputs[0]".

Hi Cory,
Thank you for your email. I tried that example sphere source -> Delaunay3D -> Python Annotation filter and it works fine. I set the python expression to ?algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])) and then to?sum(volume(inputs[0])) and it works in both cases.?The type from the information panel is Table.
But, it turns out that for my case the problem is with the Python expression, when I use this expression algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])) I get errors while this expression sum(volume(inputs[0])) solves the problem. The type from the information panel is Table.
Can I ask what does inputs[0] mean in the python expression. I have no background in python, that's why the expression seems odd to me.

Sorry for the late reply. I've been swamped lately.
Thank you for the detailed explanation of what you are doing. That really helps us narrow down what might be going on.
I'm not sure what the problem is. I have a simple pipeline example where this works:
Sphere source -> Delaunay3D -> Python Annotation filter
The Delaunay3D filter produces an unstructured grid, from which I am able to get the volumes.
I suspect ParaView readds your OpenFOAM data set as a multiblock data set? Could you look at the Info panel and report it's Type. It should be the first item under the "Statistics" sub-section.
If it is indeed a multiblock data set, please try this:
Place a MergeBlocks filter between your Threshold filter and Python Annotation filter.
Please see if that works. If it does, we'll move on to multiplying the volume by the water fraction.
Thanks,Cory

 Hi Islem,

Please reply-all to keep the discussion on the list so that others may
benefit from the discussion.

First, is there a data array that describes whether a volume element
in your mesh contains water or some other element? If so, you can use
the Threshold filter under the Filters -> Alphabetical -> Threshold
menu to select only the elements representing water. You will have to
set the minimum and maximum to the value that represents water, then
click Apply.

HTH,
Cory

Hi Andy,

I have tried with PV 5.0 and I got a lot further than previous (I didn?t test my findings below on earlier PV versions)

The issue with missing particles after 1st timestep was simply because the time-stepping was too coarse making all the particles leave the domain at next time-step.

Adding the temporal interpolator to get much smaller timesteps I managed to get some quite descent animations although I still have some issues with the path lines jumping around which I would assume is caused by the wrong ?Id Channel Array? setting.

Regards,
Per

Hi Per,
Can you share either a Python script or state file which reproduces the problem for PV 5.0? I still have your OpenFOAM file to test with so I don't need that.
Thanks,

Hi,

My guess is that it has to do with OpenFOAM's way of saving out extra fields for the initial time step. Several temporal filters assume that the arrays are ordered the same for different time steps but the OpenFOAM reader doesn't follow this convention.

Can you share a data set that reproduces the issue?

Hi,

I have been trying to visualize flow using the particle tracers as described at http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/HowTo_use_particle_tracer_in_paraFoam.

It works when using it on the cavity tutorial but when I try to transfer the setup to one of my own 3D OpenFOAM cases of a pump volute with e.g. 20 timesteps and 900,000 cells Paraview crashes with a segmentation fault when I hit the ?Play? button to step through the individual timesteps.

The pipeline setup is exactly as described in the HowTo (linked above) and I have tried both with and without the Temporal Interpolator and on Linux and Windows platform ? all with the same crash result.

I have tried the following 64-bit version:
3.98.1 on Win7
4.4.0 on Win7
4.2.0 on Linux HPC cluster

At first I thought the reason for the crash was due to the use of interfaces in the model but I have tried a model without interfaces at all and the result is the same.

Are there any restriction to the data which can be used?

Hi, a small bump on this generic question, we try to evaluate Paraview
against other softwares with similar functions.
Paraview is open source and seems intersting , but if it seems so
complicated to setup, he will quickly loose the race... :-(

In earlier versions of Paraview there was an option for cull

Hello.
I recieved an email about corrected ParaView-5.0.1 and decided to test the
latest available official release for Win64:
ParaView-5.0.1-RC1-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit.zip
I tried the same big EnSight case and the same error appeared (stat
failed). Should be this release "patched" or it's not corrected yet and I
should wait for another version?
Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] problem in example datasets ...
Message-ID: <56EA8C6A.6020400@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I had a problem with Paraview example datasets. I downloaded the data 
from following page

http://www.paraview.org/download/

but when i extract it, there is no any file in the folder. It has only a 
hidden folder (.ExternalData),

 > ls -al Downloads/ParaView-5.0.0/.ExternalData/
drwxr-xr-x@    4 turuncu  staff    136 Feb  2 10:52 .
drwxr-xr-x@    3 turuncu  staff    102 Feb  2 10:52 ..
drwxr-xr-x@ 1158 turuncu  staff  39372 Feb  2 10:52 MD5
-rwxr-xr-x@    1 turuncu  staff    182 Feb  2 10:52 README.rst

and MD5 folder have

epsilon:~ turuncu$ ls -al Downloads/ParaView-5.0.0/.ExternalData/MD5/
drwxr-xr-x@ 1158 turuncu  staff     39372 Feb  2 10:52 .
drwxr-xr-x@    4 turuncu  staff       136 Feb  2 10:52 ..
-rwxr-xr-x@    1 turuncu  staff      3768 Feb  2 10:52 
00d49b1746f315992fac476892c681ae
-rwxr-xr-x@    1 turuncu  staff       803 Feb  2 10:52 
00fbea04bd9c797f38a6c7a15993ae3a
...
...

bunch of files with MD5 hash name. Are these compressed files (both 
tar.gz and zip) corrupted? I am using Mac OS but i newer see these kind 
of problem before. Anyway, it might be good to check those files.

Regards,

These are regression test data sets (configure with BUILD_TESTING on). In
recent versions of vtk and ParaView are meant to be extracted into the
source code directory. In this case CMake knows what to do with them so
that the tests all find them without having to download each one
individually.

Hi Per,

I'm glad you're able to move forward with this.

Did you look at https://cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2014-May/031000.html
for information on the Id Channel Array? That may help.

Best,
Andy

The binaries have not yet been generated. You'll have to use RC2, not
RC1 for this fix.

Hi Andy,

I already considered the ?Generate IDs? filter but it seems that I can get good results setting the ?Id Channel Array? to ?ParticleID?. So I will save ?Generate IDs? for some other time ?

Hi Andy,

I have tried with PV 5.0 and I got a lot further than previous (I didn?t test my findings below on earlier PV versions)

The issue with missing particles after 1st timestep was simply because the time-stepping was too coarse making all the particles leave the domain at next time-step.

Adding the temporal interpolator to get much smaller timesteps I managed to get some quite descent animations although I still have some issues with the path lines jumping around which I would assume is caused by the wrong ?Id Channel Array? setting.

Per

Hi Per,
Can you share either a Python script or state file which reproduces the problem for PV 5.0? I still have your OpenFOAM file to test with so I don't need that.
Thanks,
Andy

Hi Andy,

I just want to refresh this conversation ? sorry for not passing all messages through this mailing list? my mistake.

After I shared the case you wrote that you had tried a few things but with no luck in PV 5.0. As mentioned below I have tried the following 64-bit versions
- 3.98.1 on Win7
- 4.4.0 on Win7
- 4.2.0 on Linux HPC cluster

Hi,

My guess is that it has to do with OpenFOAM's way of saving out extra fields for the initial time step. Several temporal filters assume that the arrays are ordered the same for different time steps but the OpenFOAM reader doesn't follow this convention.

Can you share a data set that reproduces the issue?

Hi,

I have been trying to visualize flow using the particle tracers as described at http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/HowTo_use_particle_tracer_in_paraFoam.

It works when using it on the cavity tutorial but when I try to transfer the setup to one of my own 3D OpenFOAM cases of a pump volute with e.g. 20 timesteps and 900,000 cells Paraview crashes with a segmentation fault when I hit the ?Play? button to step through the individual timesteps.

The pipeline setup is exactly as described in the HowTo (linked above) and I have tried both with and without the Temporal Interpolator and on Linux and Windows platform ? all with the same crash result.

I have tried the following 64-bit version:
3.98.1 on Win7
4.4.0 on Win7
4.2.0 on Linux HPC cluster

At first I thought the reason for the crash was due to the use of interfaces in the model but I have tried a model without interfaces at all and the result is the same.

Are there any restriction to the data which can be used?

The following is the trace right up to pressing ?Play?:

Hi Andy,

Please keep the conversations on the mailing list so that everyone can
follow along (also it won't get lost in my inbox that way either).

This fix will be in the PV 5.1 release. For now you should be able to get
an installer at  https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=ParaView&date=
under the latest-packages or master-packages section. Click on the yellow
box of the OS that you want to download an installer. Note tha tthe Build
Name gives a description of how ParaView as built.

Cheers,
Andy

Message-ID: <CAOOC-Xr_EGe23xYO=LYs8Taoe5MtwsQRqPKLiFi4-mPDmUvUYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After asking help for compile pvserver on our cluster, a user send me links
and its config for compile all with superbuild and solve OS dependancies
problems

I try, but got an error after 30 minutes that i don't understand (not used
to compile applications).

eader created for
/data/build-paraview/qt4/src/qt4/src/qt3support/sql/q3sqlselectcursor.h (2)

 You might need to modify the include and library search paths by editing
 QMAKE_INCDIR_X11 and QMAKE_LIBDIR_X11 in
/data/build-paraview/qt4/src/qt4/mkspecs/linux-g++.
CMake Error at /data/build-paraview/pv-qt4-configure.cmake:33 (message):

make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/qt4.dir/all] Erreur 2
make: *** [all] Erreur 2


Steps :
i create an empty build dir
i clone git repo in a second one + git checkout v5.0.0

i uste this cmake options (not sure of  what i need, but take this one
which worked for the user)


cmake    ../git/ParaViewSuperbuild \

        -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=ON \

        -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \

        -DENABLE_qt:BOOL=ON \

        -DENABLE_qt4:BOOL=ON \

        -DENABLE_python:BOOL=ON \

        -DUSE_SYSTEM_python:BOOL=OFF \

        -DENABLE_mpi:BOOL=ON \

        -DUSE_SYSTEM_mpi:BOOL=OFF \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/paraview

Don't know where is the complete log file (have only screen history
currently).

OS = Centos 6.6
For firsts tests before superbuild, i have cmake, openmpi and some other
packages already installed. But intersted in independant compilation
because part of the cluster is still in centos 5.x....

Thx for help or advices.

Subject: [Paraview] Stream tracer with custom source fails in parallel mode
Message-ID: <6935_1458291395_56EBC2C3_6935_16480_1_e98d3742b0b34ba3b3a4beaa3f5f92cf@DE0-03DAG13-P03.central.mail.corp>

Dear All,

I have been struggling to make the Stream Tracer with Custom Source (STCS) work in parallel. It works in serial mode without any issues but in parallel I am hitting a wall of obstacles. I made a little test with the disk_out_ref.ex2 in serial and parallel by and this is what I found. I am using Paraview v5.0.0 compiled from source with system libs linked against openmpi 1.7.1. I also briefly checked with other mpi flavours and under Windows with the MPI enabled binaries from paraview.org, but the problems did not disappear.

Serial mode:

1)
Load file (just with the "V" variable)
Slice with Z=5
Stream Tracer with Custom Source (STCS)
Success

2)
Load file
Slice with Z=5
Mask points (10 points with random sampling)
STCS
Success

3)
Load file
Select some points with Select Points Through
Extract Selection
STCS
Success

Everything worked without issues. Now the same in parallel on 6 processes. Here is a little word of warning, the Exodus reader reads all the data onto just one process, so unless the D3 filter is used everything works in more or less serial mode.

1)
Load file
D3
Slice with Z=5
STCS
Crash

2)

If you do not switch proportional distribution then Paraview spits an error "No points to mask" but you doesn't crash or freeze. Generating STCS from the masked points will crash Paraview though.

I also tried with more combinations with and without the D3 filter on the subsequent filters and on my industrial geometries but I could never make the Stream Tracer with Custom Source work in parallel. I found a related bug report http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15342 and an old post https://cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-December/014909.html but no solutions to this problem. Interestingly the common Stream Tracer filter works in parallel with both point and high resolution line sources.

I would be grateful if you could try to first reproduce this behavior and confirm that this is not specific to my installation. If anyone had an idea how to fix that I would be more than happy.

Regards,
Lukasz

Subject: [Paraview] Errors while reading Ensight files in parallel
Message-ID: <5472_1458296323_56EBD603_5472_512_1_04554442d89341f5bfddbc2baa2f3cfe@DE0-03DAG13-P03.central.mail.corp>

Dear All,

I noticed that the Ensight reader encounters problems when running the pvserver on more than ~12 processes. Depending on the code which generated the ensight file, Paraview either crashes while reading the file or reads the geometry but messes up the variable arrays. I carried out test on the standard naca.bin.case, which comes with the tutorial data. I noticed that the ensight reader already distributes the data over the processes and this might be causing the issue. When opening the naca.bin.case with 4, 6, 8 or 10 processes I get no errors. If I start the pvserver with 12 processes Paraview hangs while reading the file and reports an error:

ERROR: In /home/caldron-b/paluszek/linux/Software/Paraview/v5.0.0/ParaView-v5.0.0-source/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkDataSet.cxx, line 435
vtkStructuredGrid (0x1faa690): Point array DENS with 1 components, only has -260 tuples but there are 0 points
Strangely it works with 13 parallel processes but I get errors with 14 process and again success with 15 ranks and failure with 16.

The second test case was carried out on the disk_out_ref.ex2 converted to ensight in Paraview. The ensight writer seems to be having issues on its own as is it does not write the *.case file, which is the main ASCII file containing metadata. Nevertheless it was easy to generate one based on the naca.bin.case. With the converted disk_out_ref I can read the ensight format with up to 12 parallel processes without any issues. With more ranks I am still able to read in the file but the variable arrays become scrambled.

With my other industrial enisght files I get either an error while reading the file (log attached) or I read in the files but with scrambled variables. I am using Paraview v5.0.0 compiled from source with system libraries. I got the same issues with version 4.3 and 4.4 and openmpi, mpich and platform mpi so I am assuming that this is not related with my build. Nevertheless, I would appreciate if anyone could reproduce this behavior.

Regards,
Lukasz

Hi Lukasz,

I was able to replicate your crash in your first parallel crash with PV
5.0. I didn't try any of the other cases yet but am guessing that they're
all related.

Thanks for the bug report.

Best,
Andy

Hi Lukasz,

Here's a not too hacky workaround for doing your parallel use case 1. I
think the main issue is that the seed source needs to be fully available on
all processes. By using disk_out_ref.ex2 in parallel or the D3 filter and
then the slice it is making this not true. What you can do is the following
(all in parallel if you want):

   1. Read in disk_out_ref.ex2
   2. Create slice
   3. Save slice output in vtm format
   4. Read slice output back in
   5. Create D3 from disk_out_ref
   6. Do STCS with D3 and reader as the seeds

I think for readers that work can automatically partition the data in
parallel you may be able to skip steps 2 and 3 though and use the slice
output as the seeds. If you try this and it doesn't work please let us
know. Also, I didn't verify my fix for your parallel 2, 3 and 4 use cases
but if you try similar stuff for that and it doesn't work, please us know
that as well.

Best,

Andy

Islem,

The dot "." in the array name is causing problems. Because it is a Python
expression, the interpreter thinks you are asking for an attribute "water"
from a class or module.

Can you try the expression

sum(inputs[0].PointData['alpha.water']*volume(inputs[0]))

That works in an example I've created locally.

FYI, ParaView uses paraview.make_name_valid()[1] function to sanitize
array names in Python. Any character not a "_" or ASCII letter or

Thanks, Utkarsh.

Indeed, replacing "alpha.water" with "alphawater" appears to work just fine.

ParaView 5.0.1 RC2 for Win-64 has been tested with my big EnSight case. I
loaded case successfully and created slice and vectors (glyphs) on it, no
any issues occured. Great thanks for debugging!

Meanwhile, I noticed that the color bar behavior is not as good as it was
in version 4.3. The color bar doesn't adjusts automatically to round
numbers (like my boss like to see in my reports :)), although it uses
correct fonts (it's known that version 4.3 didn't enlarge color bar fonts
in many cases despite of user's choice). But it's not a bug and scale can
be adjusted by hand (it's done much more faster than in CFD Post that
slowly rebuilds contour on every change on number of ticks, ParaView does
it almost instantly). I read some discussions a bit and I suppose that the
current behavior of color vr is a "common choice".

Hello all,

The compilation is done ! I'd need to restart it many times, not sur it's
good then (not try to restart all from the beginning)

Now the test ... bad :
i go in the subfolder install/bin and find a whole binary pack "ready",
cool.

I can launch pvserver (standalone,1core) and paraview + connect localhost :
OK

--> happy i try the mpirun ... and here.....

xxx at xxx:/data/build-paraview/install/bin$ ./mpirun -np 6 pvserver &

Hi,
Thank you for your email, I tried this expression ?sum(alphawater*volume(input)) and it worked fine and gave me some logical results for some shapes that I know their volumes, but for the problem that I am working on, it gave me negative value for the volume. I am supposed to calculate the volume of a quarter of a cylinder with height 0.6 m and radius 0.3 m, so the volume should be V=(0.3*0.3*3.14*0.6)/4=0.04239 cubic meter, but ?the annotation filter gave me this value -2639.95829243. I attached here two pictures that illustrate the dimensions of the cylinder and the value I got, I couldn't what is wrong.
Regards,Islem Megdiche

 Thanks, Utkarsh.

Indeed, replacing "alpha.water" with "alphawater" appears to work just fine.

Nope, that's all you need. Check out the first chapter of the ParaView
GUide. It gives a quick overview of the executables involved and how
they play together.

Message-ID: <CACoCd8cgNzLWdZjCW9MNKfdBjRbU74MygEdVej_Sj4aFxcGM5g@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning all,

I have a small problem, I've imported a csv file with xyz data and
converted it to points with the tabletopoints filter. The points show up
just fine but I am unable to threshold the data... If I attempt to create a
threshold that uses a valid range all data/points disappear. Am I doing
something wrong or is this a bug?

Thanks in advance for you help,

Subject: [Paraview] libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
Message-ID: <CAJB=V01LccZMbhErRaPRyeihyXtyfqPssHzgKQmTJgo33xg_ng@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to install and run ParaViewWeb. I've tried: Fedora 21, Debian
Jessie, & Ubuntu 14.0.4 and ParaView 4.1 (pvw-setup, stock pkgs, bin/src
download) and 5.0 on each. None work, and they fail for different reasons.
Here's one failure on Ubuntu 14.0.4 with
ParaView-5.0.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz:

$ ./bin/pvpython
lib/paraview-5.0/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --content
./share/paraview-5.0/www --data-dir ~/tmp --port 8080
2016-03-20 15:28:46+0000 [-] Log opened.
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
X Error of failed request:  GLXBadFBConfig
  Major opcode of failed request:  150 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  34 ()
  Serial number of failed request:  29

The swrast driver seems to be there:

$ find /usr -name \*swrast\*
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gallium-pipe/pipe_swrast.so

Running strace shows that it does load
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so and fails later with this, I
think:

close(4)                                = 0
open("/home/vagrant/.drirc", O_RDONLY)  = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
munmap(0x7f0439de2000, 5648480)         = 0
write(2, "libGL error: ", 13libGL error: )           = 13
write(2, "failed to load driver: swrast\n", 30failed to load driver: swrast

More of the strace found here: http://pastebin.com/krQ5ZR4J

Even if I create ~/.drirc it still gets the same error without any clear
reason why.

Thanks,
Rob

For software rasterization in Mesa I think llvmpipe is the safer bet. If I
recall correctly swrast is an old legacy rasterizer and does not support
the more modern OpenGL functions in Mesa.

Thanks, Ken. I am very new to ParaView. How do I tell ParaViewWeb to use
llvmpipe?

Someone else here may know better, but on Linux I believe it is not so much
paraview as making sure you have the right OpenGL implementation. It might
be a matter of grabbing a newer version of Mesa (provides OpenGL) using apt
get or something like that. Push comes to shove you can build mesa yourself
ala http://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html Someone more familiar with
Linux/Mesa may be able to give you better specifics.

>>>>CFP VISUALIZATION SHOWCASES -- EXTENDED DEADLINE
------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Eurographics 2016 Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization
(EGPGV 2016)
=========================================================================
June 6-7, 2016, Groningen, the Netherlands
Co-located with EuroVis 2016
www.egpgv.org


Second Call for Visualization Showcases -- Extended Deadline
=================================================

This year EGPGV presents the second edition of the Visualization Showcase.
This track provides a forum for the year's most instrumental movies in
parallel graphics and visualization. Finalists will compete for the Best
Visualization Award, and each finalist will present his or her movie during
a dedicated session at EGPGV '16 in a 10-minute presentation. Movies
are judged based on how they illuminate science, by the quality of the
movie,
and for innovations in the process used for creating the movie. Accepted
submissions will appear as short papers in the symposium proceedings.

Review and selection process for Visualization Showcases
================================================

Submissions need to include a movie (up to 150MB in size) and a short
paper (up to 4 pages including references). The short paper should describe
the scientific story conveyed by the movie, how the visualization helps
scientific discovery, and the "state-of-the-practice" information behind
making the movie.

Each showcase submission will be peer-reviewed by the EGPGV International
Program Committee. Criteria for revision include:

* Compelling visualization
* Visualizing data involving parallel graphics and/or parallel
visualization in a
significant way (e.g., data size, parallel processing, parallel rendering)
* Meaningful and compelling science story
* Description of visualization techniques necessary to accomplish the movie


Important Dates
=================


Showcase Submission:                    April 1, 2016
Author Notification:                            April 15, 2016
Camera-Ready Submission:                        April 25, 2016
Symposium:                                              June 6-7, 2016



Submission Information
==================

To submit a visualization showcase, upload the paper (formatted using
the Latex
templates provided on the symposium?s website) and the accompanying movie
in the ?Visualization Showcase? track on the PCS system
(precisionconference.com/~vgtc). More information is available on the

Hi Rob,

Are you planning to have a GPU on the server, or just a CPU?
If you are targeting just CPU, you will have to build ParaView with OSMesa
and llvmpipe (Which will provide somewhat slow rendering).
Here is a documentation on how to build both of them:
http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/os_mesa.html

Subject: [Paraview] Threshold not working on points created from csv file
Message-ID: <D31576C7.26888%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I'm not sure how to succinctly describe what is going on, but I will give it a try. The table to points is creating a data set with a single "cell" containing all of the points. This is a little bit weird thing to do since filters like threshold will treat all the points as a single cell, which is why you are seeing this behavior.

The easiest way to break each point into its own cell is to use the Glyph filter. Add the Glyph filter and set Glyph Type to "2D Glyph". A second combo box below that also labeled Glyph Type will appear. Set that one to "Vertex". Once you apply the filter, the data will look the same, but when you run threshold you should get the behavior you expect.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Threshold not working on points created from csv file

Good morning all,

I have a small problem, I've imported a csv file with xyz data and converted it to points with the tabletopoints filter. The points show up just fine but I am unable to threshold the data... If I attempt to create a threshold that uses a valid range all data/points disappear. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?

Thanks in advance for you help,

At the VTK single node level, enable Module_vtkUtilitiesBenchmarks module
in cmake, compile and run bin/TimingTests

At the ParaView multiple node level, Chuck Atkins is nearly done with
revamping the old benchmark.py and adding to it a simple canonical test
script that uses the programmable filter to make arbitrarily large meshes
to test parallel rendering with. That can be found at:

I am surprised that pvw-setup described on
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb doesn't work. I'm happy to run it
on KitWare's Linux distro of choice, but I don't see that listed. As noted,
I tried Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. I'm just trying to get the demo to work.

I'll go and retry the builds, but I had different problems with those.
Should I try 5.0.0 or 4.x?

Hi Rob,

Is it a headless machine or not? The pvw-setup is targeting a regular
desktop computer with GPU and proper OpenGL drivers.

The setup that I was mentioning earlier is a special setup when no GPU is
available hence the need to build ParaView specifically for your hardware.

So my question is (before trying crazy stuff), where are you trying the
demo on? (Hardware and software information)

Thanks for the quick response, Seb.

I'm using vagrant/VirtualBox, which is a headless VM. I am trying to use
ParaViewWeb. Is there

It would be helpful to have official KitWare Docker and Vagrant images for
the ParaViewWeb demo. I'll be happy to contribute the creation scripts, but
first have to figure out how to build it. :)

Is there a place on the website that explains how to build a headless
ParaViewWeb installation?

Yes the link I gave you is the good one for that:

http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/guides/os_mesa.html

We have EC2/GPU images that are public and fully setup if you want to.
I can give you the ami-xxx names if you want to. (Still have to publish
that in a proper documentation online...)

PS: BTW with vagrant and a VM with no GPU the performances will be pretty
poor.

Thank you again.

FYI, it refers to the 9.2.2, but ftp://ftp.freedesktop.org/pub/mesa/ only
has 11.x versions.

Yes, please. I'm going to skip the building above, since you have these.
You can convert an AMI to VirtualBox. A better alternative would be have a
repo with the build scripts used to create the AMis. Having a headless
Docker image would be a very nice addition. :)

Thanks for the tip. We are beginning a project where we are evaluating the
APIs for various rendering engines. Once we figure out which API works best
for us, we'll look into tuning performance.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] reading a list of ellipsoids into paraview quick and
	dirty
Message-ID: <934BE7CF-402B-430F-A242-34E4A443CB7D@llnl.gov>

Hi,
I have a user that supplies me with a text file of ellipsoids specified by location, rotation, and axis, from which I plan to create Spheres modified by the Transform operator to make ellipsoids.  I can write a function that basically does this:

ellipsoids = open(filename, 'r').read()
for ellipse in ellipsoids:
sphere1 = Sphere()
renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')
sphere1Display = Show(sphere1, renderView1)
transform1 = Transform(Input=sphere1)
transform1.Transform = 'Transform'
transform1.Transform.Translate = [0.0, 2.0, 0.0]
transform1.Transform.Rotate = [0.0, 65.0, 76.0]
transform1.Transform.Scale = [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]
transform1Display = Show(transform1, renderView1)


My question is, how can I use this approach to provide her a macro in the GUI somehow to read her file and populate her scene with ellipsoids?  I hope this question is clear enough.

Thanks.

The public AMI are below. Just beware that they require GPU. Otherwise, I
agree with you, a docker image and/or some ansible playbook would be nice.
I am not sure I will get to it that soon, so if you happen to build any of
that and are willing to share with the community, then let me know, that
will be really nice.

Hey Rich!

I recommend reading in the data directly with the CSV reader.

Then apply the table to points filter to convert the data from a table to a
point set. In  the T2P filter you specify which columns are x,y,z and which
are normal arrays.

>From there you can apply the glyph filter to scale and orient the
ellipsoids. Getting the scaling right may take a bit more work (a
calculator filter, preferably the numpy version) to get the orientation
angles into a 3 component wide vector array that the glyph filter knows how
to work with.

Doing it this way will be much more efficient since ParaView prefers few
proxies(think actors) with many elements over many proxies each with few
elements. It will be more efficient still if you use GL2 and the point
gaussian representation, which will do the transform on the GPU.

Message-ID: <CAAstK2H8jYUQsqrTpCOoP0i6OBzs=98HXBvHTaxoRy7uwQpndg@mail.gmail.com>

I am getting trouble to find values after applying integrator filter.

values_table = IntegrateVariables(Input=fullvolume)
GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')

print value_table.PointData.keys()   # returns ['ion_pdf_n_c0', 'ion_pdf_n_c1']
print value_table.CellData.keys() # returns ['Volume']

I have given try to following methods but not able to get value of
"Volume" and other.

print values_table.CellData["Volume"]
print value_tables.CellData.GetArray('Volume')

Does paraview comes with any special method to get value of key from dictionary?

Arshpreet,

You probably need to fetch the data over to the client side with

Fetch(values_table)

before you can access the data array values. By default, the array
values are stored only on the server - you need to manually bring them
over to the client side before you can access them.

HTH,
Cory

Ethan,

I think the basic problem is that the output of Threshold is always element -centric.   You can select points in Threshold, but those points will define cells and only the points in the defined cells are in the output.   So once your output doesn't include all the points in your single cell, then the cell isn't included in the output and therefore there are no points in the output.

A possible workaround is to use Find Data and select points - use a query equivalent to your threshold value and you should get the points that satisfy it.

Hope this helps.

Great! Thanks for testing, Andrew. Looks like we're pretty set for the
final 5.0.1 release. I'll tag it by the end of this week.

Message-ID: <56F17279.9010909@ncsu.edu>

I knew how to do this in Paraview 4.x, but how do I change the location 
of my legend for a LineChartView in Paraview 5.0? A lot of the plot 
properties have been moved to the pipeline browser that used to be 
accessible from the Layout window, but the legend location doesn't seem 
to be one of them; now I can't find the option anywhere!

Try the gear icon, which exposes the "Advanced" (aka not commonly used)
options.
Is the controls there now?

The legend location has moved to the Properties Panel like the rest of the properties. Try typing "legend" in the search bar at the top of the Properties Panel. You should see an item named "Legend Location" toward the bottom. (Note that this option is only there when the LineChartView is actively selected.

David,

My responses are inline.

Not necessarily. Only if you want to use it on HPC system with
platform specific MPI implementation. Otherwise you can simply run
pvserver from the ParaView binaries from paraview.org as follows:

$ paraviewdir= <location for paraview 5.0 binaries untarred>
$ cd $paraviewdir
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$paraviewdir/lib/paraview-5.0
$ ./lib/paraview-5.0/mpiexec -np <number of ranks> ./bin/pvserver

> Next step is to test multiCores on local. i read the doc (which speak only

I'd suggest use the ParaView Superbuild
(https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild) to build
ParaView and all needed components. Get get a basic build, here's the
flags I'd use:

> mkdir buildir
> cd builddir
> ccmake -DENABLE_paraview=ON \
                 -DENABLE_python=ON \
                 -DENABLE_qt4=ON \
                 -DENABLE_mpi=ON \
                 -DUSE_SYSTEM_python=ON \
                 -DUSE_SYSTEM_mpi=ON \
                 -DParaView_FOMR_GIT=OFF \
                  -DPARAVIEW_RENDERING_BACKEND=OpenGL2 \
                  <superbuild source dir>
> make

This will use your system installation of Python (all Python packages
in it)  and MPI, but built appropriate version of Qt.

> stop at v4.4 or v4.3) ?

5 and 4.* is not much different besides changes to rendering backend.
Thus ParaView Guide etc. are still relevant. We are working on
updating the guide to document new features in 5.0.

You 4.8.* is recommended. We use 4.8.4 for our binaries.

Not to my knowledge.

If the question is do you have to build paraview, yes. However, you
don;t need to build with Qt support enabled on  the cluster.

> try install pvserver+mpi on a cluster with nodes without Graphic cards ?

Only if you want to use the cluster. You don't have to use ParaView in
a remote configuration. You can always use it as a desktop only tool.

Yes, but under the covers the spreadsheet view is transferring the
data from the server to the client. That *might* be accessible from
Python, but using Fetch() is more straightforward.

Note that when you aren't explicitly connected to a pvserver (ParaView
server), the ParaView GUI application starts and connects to a
built-in server, so you still need to Fetch() the data you wish to
work with.

Thank you both Kenneth and Dennis,

I should have thought to use the Find Data functionality which does do what
I need it to do. However, Kenneth's solution is actually easier and it
causes Threshold to behave exactly the way I expect it to.

I appreciate your help gentlemen.

Alex,

Do you have a data set you can share (privately with me, if necessary) for
debugging purposes?

Thank you,
Cory

Alex,

This looks like it may be an issue with your graphics card and the new
OpenGL2 backend.  Especially if you have used older versions of ParaView on
this machine without seeing this issue.  What graphics card/drivers are you
using?

Thanks,
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] Automatically scale color map
Message-ID: <56F1B03D.4060902@ncsu.edu>

Sorry for the barrage of questions guys. I've used Paraview a lot for 1D 
visualization, but now am wading into 2D... Based off Utkarsh's 
description here 
<https://blog.kitware.com/using-the-color-map-editor-in-paraview-the-basics/>, 
I would think that toggling "Rescale on Visibility Changes" (text a 
little different from previous versions of Paraview) would lead to 
automatic scaling of my color map when I change time steps. However, 
that doesn't appear to be the case. What am I missing?

Alex,

Thank you for the data set. My color legend looks as expected, i.e., it
isn't solid blue. I, too, suspect the graphics driver.

Ken,

Do you have suggestions on how to debug this?

Thanks,
Cory

Alex,

Rescaling on Visibility Changes only rescales when an object changes from
visible to invisible or vice versa (hence visibility change).

To do what you want, see Edit -> Settings. In the Settings dialog, click
the General tab and find the "Transfer Function Reset Mode". You can change
this to "Grow and update every timestep" to expand the range as time moves
on (range never shrinks) or "Clamp and update every timestep" to shrink the
range every timestep.

HTH,
Cory

Message-ID: <27c42b901e734081a84f60608a98ba8b@GRPRDHMBXP01.mail.erm55.com>

Hi all,

I am using paraview for 3-D hydrodynamic and water quality plume modeling.
I am interested to load ArcGIS shape files and geo-referenced images  so that I can overlay the 3-D model results.
Forum and other web searches show that some versions of paraview (paraviewGeo) and shapefile plugins were developed by others.
But I am not get these files from websites (broken links or not available).

Can anyone share shapefile and geo-ref image plugins for paraview?

Thanks
Venkat

Mesa versions 10.5.4 and earlier have a bug that causes issues with VTK. We
recommend upgrading to version 10.5.5 or later. That would be my first
guess. If that is the case we probably need to add something to watch for
that in VTK.


Thanks

Ken

Alex,

I'd like to supplement Cory's answer (which is totally correct) with some caution. There is a reason why the functionality you are looking for is hidden in the Settings dialog. Making animations where the color map rescales every time step can be very misleading. Use this option with caution.

Rather than change the color map scaling every time step, it is better to set a static range that is valid for all time steps (if possible). Assuming your data is not huge (and it sounds like it is not), you can try hitting the "Rescale to data range over all timesteps" button. (It is in the color map editor to the right of the color bars with the "t" on it.) That will look at your data over all time and set the color scale to the min/max over all.

-Ken

To do what you want, see Edit -> Settings. In the Settings dialog, click the General tab and find the "Transfer Function Reset Mode". You can change this to "Grow and update every timestep" to expand the range as time moves on (range never shrinks) or "Clamp and update every timestep" to shrink the range every timestep.

Hi Venkat,

You will need to build ParaView with Module_vtkIOGDAL set to ON. Then you
will need to install this plugin from here: (it worked for bit older
version of ParaView so things may have changed.).

https://www.gitorious.org/vtkgis_vector_reader/vtkgis_vector_reader.git/?p=vtkgis_vector_reader:vtkgis_vector_reader.git;a=tree;f=ParaViewPlugin;h=001f92722ada41697ef402339b6777e3dc66e1f1;hb=HEAD

Once the plugin is enabled, you should be able to load the Shapefile. I
will talk to ParaView developers to bring this into ParaView (I don't think
its in the repo yet).

Thanks

Ken & Cory, thank you both for the input. I agree that changing scales 
can be very misleading! However, at this point I'm investigating some 
very new physics that I don't quite have an intuitive grasp of yet. 
Thus, being able to see the max and/or min in the domain and its 
location evolve over time is useful for me. Cory's suggestion works well 
for this.

Thanks again guys!

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering Error - OpenGLRenderWindow
Message-ID: <CAAMw-MJPwn2K2VJH5BopYvVb=LmN=WcUyUp-fzs8ODgQus9F5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use Paraview-4.0.1 installed by apt-get. Could anyone help
me, please?


I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop / ParaView Client and Ubuntu 14.04 Server
/ParaView Server and got the following situation:

The dependences of ParaView, openmpi, vtk are all the ubuntu 14.04 versions.

The pvserver is running on a machine without GPU, so I use the command
"mpirun -np 32 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering" to start the ParaView
server.

When i run paraview on client, I receive this error below but the program
open:
############
QInotifyFileSystemWatcherEngine::addPaths: inotify_add_watch failed: No
such file or directory
QFileSystemWatcher: failed to add paths: /root/.config/ibus/bus
Bus::open: Can not get ibus-daemon's address.
IBusInputContext::createInputContext: no connection to ibus-daemon
############

And when I select the option "Surface" or "Surface with Edges" on the top
of the screen I receive this error and the server is disconnected, closing
the mpirun process:

On the client side, I've tried to export this environment variable before
run paraview: "export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=y" either


When I do this, after connect the client to server, i've got this error:

Alright, upgraded my graphics (now running Mesa 11.3.0 among other 
upgrades), and now I have a beautiful color bar :-) Thanks a lot guys

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering Error - OpenGLRenderWindow

Looks like you're not only running on a machine without a GPU but also
without an accessible XServer. If that's the case, you'll need to use
the OSMesa version of ParaView (not sure if that's available in your
distribution) or build one yourself. This wiki page may help shed some
light on how to do that:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

You don't necessarily have to do rendering on server-side. From your
settings dialog, you can set the "Remote Rendering Threshold" under
the "Render View" tab to the maximum and the all rendering will happen
on the client side.

Subject: [Paraview] Poor movie quality in Paraview 5.0
Message-ID: <CANt3wQu-S1pJygpoJbKwNycNKZo2ALRVKTt0U3SE_eTwS2y0Bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have encountered a problem with movie quality in Paraview 5.0 while
saving as .avi format. The movie quality is poor.
There exists  a discussion thread
<http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-October/009863.html> about
the same for Paraview 3.4.
Image produced by "save as screenshot" is as good as image rendered  in
Paraview but for saved movie quality is reduced what I see in Paraview.

I could post process the images to create a good quality movie by
increasing  bit rate. Is there any way to create a good quality movie
directly from Paraview.

Thanks
Raj

I confirm that your solution works for all of the cases. As long as I am able to generate the seeding , save and then re-read a VTM, PVD or PVTU file then the Stream Tracer with Custom Source works in parallel.

What is worth noting is that in parallel the mask points filter with the ?Proportionally Distribute Maximum Number Of Points? option requires that all processes contain a bit of the input data, i.e. it the direct input for this filter must be D3-partitioned data, otherwise mask points filter will hang or crash.

Regards,
Lukasz

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Stream tracer with custom source fails in parallel mode

Hi Lukasz,
Here's a not too hacky workaround for doing your parallel use case 1. I think the main issue is that the seed source needs to be fully available on all processes. By using disk_out_ref.ex2 in parallel or the D3 filter and then the slice it is making this not true. What you can do is the following (all in parallel if you want):

  1.  Read in disk_out_ref.ex2
  2.  Create slice
  3.  Save slice output in vtm format
  4.  Read slice output back in
  5.  Create D3 from disk_out_ref
  6.  Do STCS with D3 and reader as the seeds

I think for readers that work can automatically partition the data in parallel you may be able to skip steps 2 and 3 though and use the slice output as the seeds. If you try this and it doesn't work please let us know. Also, I didn't verify my fix for your parallel 2, 3 and 4 use cases but if you try similar stuff for that and it doesn't work, please us know that as well.

Best,

Andy

Dear All,

I have been struggling to make the Stream Tracer with Custom Source (STCS) work in parallel. It works in serial mode without any issues but in parallel I am hitting a wall of obstacles. I made a little test with the disk_out_ref.ex2 in serial and parallel by and this is what I found. I am using Paraview v5.0.0 compiled from source with system libs linked against openmpi 1.7.1. I also briefly checked with other mpi flavours and under Windows with the MPI enabled binaries from paraview.org<http://paraview.org>, but the problems did not disappear.

Serial mode:

1)
Load file (just with the ?V? variable)
Slice with Z=5
Stream Tracer with Custom Source (STCS)
Success

2)
Load file
Slice with Z=5
Mask points (10 points with random sampling)
STCS
Success

3)
Load file
Select some points with Select Points Through
Extract Selection
STCS
Success

Everything worked without issues. Now the same in parallel on 6 processes. Here is a little word of warning, the Exodus reader reads all the data onto just one process, so unless the D3 filter is used everything works in more or less serial mode.

1)

I also tried with more combinations with and without the D3 filter on the subsequent filters and on my industrial geometries but I could never make the Stream Tracer with Custom Source work in parallel. I found a related bug report http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15342 and an old post https://cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-December/014909.html but no solutions to this problem. Interestingly the common Stream Tracer filter works in parallel with both point and high resolution line sources.

I would be grateful if you could try to first reproduce this behavior and confirm that this is not specific to my installation. If anyone had an idea how to fix that I would be more than happy.

Regards,
Lukasz

Dear all,

I recently noticed a bug. I have a statefile saved which I use for
post-processing some OpenFOAM results. To have the view settings
consistent, I also saved new Custom Camera settings (The 1 2 3 4 buttons in
the Adjust Camera widget). With my workflow as: Open Statefile>Make
pictures from different camera positions>Disconnect>Reopen statefile
(different case)>Click on Custom Camera position> ParaView crashes with a
segmentation error.

I am using v5.0.0 on linux 64 bit architecture (downloaded the binary
package).

I noticed that the crash happens if I keep the Adjust Camera widget visible
and does not happen when the Adjust Camera widget is closed before the
disconnect. Please note that I only use the disconnect to quickly clear my
pipeline without having to close ParaView completely.

I can work around this issue, but it feels like a small bug.

Regards,
Tom

Subject: [Paraview] Extremely slow animations
Message-ID: <CABY5g+sRyrCB7n+WsH1mXeGbzpr=rNPCoxr5zsu909DndM6ttw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview enthusiasts, good day. I did an animation using a single data
file, camera-follow path, rendering about 800 stream tracer lines, with
tube filters using a mac book pro without gpu cards, and it took me about
2-3hrs. I then tried to do a similar animation, but it turned out to
extremely slow, using pvserver over remote resources, through an ethernet
connection, apparently with more ram memory than the mac instance, and with
GPU cards . It does not make sense. According to the sys admin folks
they did a parallel, gpu enabled, built of the pvserver. The slowdown
seemed to be associated with the animations, i.e. the session was fast for
rendering and working with the data.

Any hints will be greatly appreciated.

My best, Mart?n

This is way harder than it should be, but it is working in 5.0:

1. Select the block you want the plot for. You can over the mouse over the block and hit the b key.
2. Run the "Extract Selection" filter on that block.
3. Open the Find Data dialog.
4. In the first line, choose points or cells (depending on what you want to plot), and "ExtractSelection#".
5. In the first criterium line, select "ID" "is >=" "0"
6. Click "Run Selection Query"
7. Click "Plot Selection Over Time"
8. Apply the filter that is created.

The resulting plot will show the min, max, average, and quartiles of all the variables. Select down to the one you want to see.

Couldn't you just select the block, then use Plot Selection Over Time with "Only Report Selection Statistics" selected, without actually extracting each block?

Mart?n,

I think we would need some more information before we could narrow down what might be the problem. It sounds like the data you have is static. That is, the tubed lines are the same for every frame of the animation. Is that the case?

In your pvserver launch, how large is the parallel job? How many nodes in your cluster are you using? How many processes per node?

What type of data file are you loading? Not all file formats will be automatically distributed across a parallel job.

It might be helpful if you took a look at the timer log (Tools -> Timer). That will give you an indication of how long things are taking.

Raj,

The degradation in image quality is probably caused by the codec used when creating the avi file. I recommend instead saving out png images (one of the options for saving a movie) and then using a third party tool to combine them into a movie file.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Poor movie quality in Paraview 5.0

Hi All,

I have encountered a problem with movie quality in Paraview 5.0 while saving as .avi format. The movie quality is poor.
There exists  a discussion thread<http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-October/009863.html> about the same for Paraview 3.4.
Image produced by "save as screenshot" is as good as image rendered  in Paraview but for saved movie quality is reduced what I see in Paraview.

I could post process the images to create a good quality movie by increasing  bit rate. Is there any way to create a good quality movie directly from Paraview.

Thanks
Raj

Islem,

One possibility is that the order of vertices in your grid is somehow
different than what VTK expects and gives you inverted cells that have
negative volume. I don't know if this is the case because your
negative volume is much different from the expected positive volume.

Could you try using the Python Calculator to compute the volumes of
each cell and see if they are all negative? The expression should be
something like

volumes(input)

(haven't tested this). This would at least be a first step in
debugging the problem.

HTH,
Cory

Bence,

Are these still problems in ParaView 5.0 or 5.0.1 RC2?

Thanks,

Dave ? I?m running the new_benchmark.py script from the command line

pvpython new_benchmark.py


Is there a way to jack up the number of polygons that the script generates?

Not sure what you mean by new_benchmark.py. You should run
benchmark/manyspheres.py.

It takes resolution and numspheres arguments. numspheres is the total
number of objects in the scene and each processors makes a diffent set of
them. Resolution is the phi&theta resolution of each that controls the
number of polygons each sphere has.

It is still in
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/692 which
hasn't been merged yet because we have a few changes left to make in it. It
would be great if you could try it and comment in the gitlab review on
anything you find.

I expect it will be merged next week. Note that although this won't show up
in a release until ParaView 7.1, it is possible to copy to use with older
ParaViews.

Hi Rick,

This is a bit of a brain dump so I'll try to get a blog post, or maybe even
a Kitware Source article on it soon, but for now, I've got the new scripts
ready as a merge request into ParaView but if you want to run it against
existing installations (it should work across a range of versions) the
scripts will need some slight modifications.  I've modified a few lines
lines to enable this and you can get the modified benchmark scripts in my
personal github account here:

Repo: https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git
Folder: scripts/paraview/benchmarknew

You should be able to run the "manyspheres" benchmark directly with pvbatch
using --help for argument options:

pvbatch benchmarknew/manyspheres.py --help
usage: manyspheres.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_BASENAME] [-s SPHERES]
                      [-n SPHERES_IN_SCENE] [-r RESOLUTION] [-v VIEW_SIZE]
                      [-f FRAMES] [-c]

Benchmark ParaView geometry rendering

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_BASENAME, --output-basename OUTPUT_BASENAME
                        Basename to use for generated output files
  -s SPHERES, --spheres SPHERES
                        The total number of spheres to render
  -n SPHERES_IN_SCENE, --spheres-in-scene SPHERES_IN_SCENE
                        The number of spheres in the entire scene, including
                        those not rendered.
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Theta and Phi resolution to use for the spheres
  -v VIEW_SIZE, --view-size VIEW_SIZE
                        View size used to render
  -f FRAMES, --frames FRAMES
                        Number of frames
  -c, --color           Enable color renderings
[chuck.atkins at hal9000 bench]$

Typical arguments I use:

   - Resolution: 725, that ends up with ~1M triangles per sphere
   - Spheres: try to keep as an even multiple of MPI ranks, that way each
   rank has an even work load
   - Spheres in scene: leave blank, it defaults to the previous number of
   spheres argument.  This is used for testing the rendering of a small number
   of spheres in a larger context.  For example, if you render 1000 spheres
   across 100 MPI ranks, thus 10 spheres per node, you can run again to test
   the single node performance (w/o compositing) by running on a single node
   with -s 10 -n 1000.
   - View size: 1920,1080 this will set the size of the render window.
   - Color: Nice to enable for 1 run since frame 0 is saved as a tiff but
   decreases the rendering performance so leave it off when trying to identify
   rendering limits

Given that, if I wanted to render 16B triangles across 256 MPI ranks, I
would run:

mpirun -n 256 /path/to/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering
benchmarknew/manyspheres.py -s 16384 -r 725 -v 1920,1080 -f 10 -o
"manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m"

This will result in the following files:

   - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.args.txt
      - The arguments the benchmark was run with
      - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.mem.txt
      - Memory info for each pvserver at each frame
      - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.raw.bin
      - Raw log data that be loaded with logbase.load()
      - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.parsed.bin
      - Parsed log data that be loaded with Python pickel
      - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.scene.f0.tiff
      - Rendered image of the scene from Frame 0
      - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.r0f0.txt
      - Log information for Rank 0, Frame 0
      - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.frame.txt
      - Statistics per-frame calculated across ranks
      - manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.summary.txt
      - Statistics calculated across all frames

Note that you can just as easily run it on a single node without MPI and
you'll get valid numbers.  Please let me know if you have any questions or
need help trying to run it.


Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Mono and Stereo Rendering in the CAVE
Message-ID: <CAA7GnU=N8U3gVBNKx7DT0wyZbQdd0w0Pv_rQipYpYw84GhHD=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I have setup Paraview5 in a CAVE environment at Virginia Tech. I got mono
to work but I am stuck with Stereo rendering.

Below is my stereo cave.pvx file.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
    <Process Type="client" />
    <Process Type="server">
    <!-- Tiled wall in Kitware -->
    <EyeSeparation Value="0.065"/>
    <Machine Name="CTL"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.4"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1  -1  -1"
           LowerRight="1    -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1    1   -1"/>
    <Machine Name="CTR"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.5"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1    -1  1"
           LowerRight="1   -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1   1   -1"/>
    <Machine Name="CBL"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.6"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1  -1  -1"
           LowerRight="1    -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1    1   -1"/>
    <Machine Name="CBR"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.7"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1  -1  -1"
           LowerRight="1    -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1    1   -1"/>
 </Process>
</pvx>

The problem is that I don't see any distinction between the left, and the
right eye. I would have attached images if it helps but that may make my
email too big to be approved by the moderator.

About the setup in the lab - we have 8 projectors driving this 4-sdied
cave, 2 projectors for each wall. The projectors do active stereo,
2560x1600 resolution.

We think the issue maybe with setting up the correct view frustum but not
sure. Anybody seen this issue before?

Subject: [Paraview] Finding Resultant Polydata
Message-ID: <CAFvyM3QG6ue7NUN0D9tQVaMu+pJPRiX3iL2B4BWnJvQdmNU2GA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was wondering if there was a way to find a resultant polydata by subtract
one polydata from another? I have an vtkAppenPolyData with about 19 inputs,
and I would like to specify the area that doesn't exist within the append.
Is there a way to subtract this append from a polydata specifying the
bounds of all of the objects together?

Kevin

Have you started the client that connects to the pvserver with --stereo and
verified the stereo type for client and server jobs the view section of the
properties panel?

I do enable --stereo on the client side when connecting to the server, but
when I give --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes", I get OpenGL errors in
vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx. I don't get that when I don't specify the stereo type.
I *think* that's because "Crystal Eyes" ain't supported by the projectors
we have here (not sure).

Yes, I checked the stereo type in the properties panel. It sets it to
Anaglyph, and Server Stereo Type = Same as Client.

Is that error message from the client or server process?

Also, try just RedBlue at first and verify that you get two perspectives.
Then in the properties panel, change the server's type to from Same as
Client to CrystalEyes.

I can see the error from both the client, and the server.

Just tried RedBlue and I got a left eye but no right eye. When I changed
the server's type to from Same as Client to CrystalEyes, I get the same
errors in vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx.

Alright, I updated the pvx file some, just the correct coordinates.

 </Process>
</pvx>

I tried attaching an image for reference but my email didn't go through. I
can see the two images (left eye, right eye) with an eye separation of
0.065, but for some reason, I see both the images with stereo glasses on in
each eye. Any more ideas?

Lance (CC'd) had an idea that maybe, we can do passive stereo rendering as
well. Would you recommend that given our projectors here do support active
stereo? I am still trying though to make it work with active stereo. Is
there someway to define the viewpoints in the pvx file? Also, is there some
kind of a schema for this pvx file published somewhere?

Thanks for all your help!

Subject: [Paraview] Finding intersection Points
Message-ID: <CAAstK2GTTQ4S9wr2S9Edu8BMj50beyeQqN922rSOJ04SfCzaiQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking for Paraview funcnality where one can give two  or more
shapes/volumes as input and find the intersection-points between those
shapes.

fsolve() from scipy is able to provide common solution between two
equations but I am not able to understand how to give Paraview Objects
as fsolve() input or is there any  generic method available in
Paraview where one can find common/intersection points between two
shapes?

Hi Faiz,

Few things:

1| You have two projectors per wall each covering half of the wall
2| You are trying to do active stereo on each half part of the wall
3| You put glasses on and you see both left and right eye on the half wall
from the same projector

If this is the case, it sounds like your active stereo is not working. Are
you sure your driver is setup up correctly? Before you try to work on
cluster setup, just try working on one projector for debugging purposes. If
I were you I would do this:

1) Just use PVX to run on one projector (half wall)
2) Make sure your driver is setup correctly. If this is linux try running
glxgears in stereo mode (
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man1/glxgears.1.html)
3) If 2) works then something is wrong with VTK/ParaView/Config somewhere.
4) Make sure that your active glasses are working meaning that they are
syncing with the transmitter which is connected to the node

Hope this helps.

Hi Ashish,

Thanks for your email. I was just now reading an old thread by you on a
similar topic answering someone's query on a similar problem.

1. Yes, you are right. Two projectors per wall doing active stereo. So, in
my PVX file, for doing only one half of the wall, I define Display=:0.0
 (left eye) and Display=:0.1 (right eye).

2. Yes, active stereo on each half of the wall.

3. Umm, no. Here's what's happening. Sorry if I didn't explain properly
before. I use two processes to drive one half of the wall using mpi. I put
on glasses and don't see anything with my right eye and see two images with
my left. I tend to think this is where I am doing something wrong. I tried
using 1 process to drive one half of the wall but same result.

I just tried running glxgears in stereo and see an error - "Error: couldn't
get an rgb double-buffered visual". :/ But I am running InstantReality
projects in the same CAVE using stereo. This is a bit weird.

Btw, I am using one powerful machine with 4 graphics card on it to drive
the entire CAVE.

Thanks again for your help! If you have any more ideas, I would be glad to
hear.

Hey Cory,
Thank you for your email. I tried using the python calculator with the expression you gave me but I got error saying that name ''volumes'' ?doesn't exist. I also used the python annotation filter to calculate the volume of oil in a region that I can estimate the real volume but ?instead of getting a scalar, I got a VTK array. I attached pictures that illustrate every thing, I also attached a picture of the mesh that I created with salome platform.
Regards,Islem?

 Islem,

One possibility is that the order of vertices in your grid is somehow
different than what VTK expects and gives you inverted cells that have
negative volume. I don't know if this is the case because your
negative volume is much different from the expected positive volume.

Could you try using the Python Calculator to compute the volumes of
each cell and see if they are all negative? The expression should be
something like

volumes(input)

(haven't tested this). This would at least be a first step in
debugging the problem.

HTH,
Cory

Thanks for the detailed writeup.      I?m really wanting to focus on ParaView performance on a particular GL card ? not so  much overall parallel ParaView performance.      Is this benchmark applicable to running on a single node with ParaView built with GL libs?       Would I use pvpython instead of pvbatch?

Hi Rick,

This is a bit of a brain dump so I'll try to get a blog post, or maybe even a Kitware Source article on it soon, but for now, I've got the new scripts ready as a merge request into ParaView but if you want to run it against existing installations (it should work across a range of versions) the scripts will need some slight modifications.  I've modified a few lines lines to enable this and you can get the modified benchmark scripts in my personal github account here:

Repo: Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git < Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git >
Folder: scripts/paraview/benchmarknew

You should be able to run the "manyspheres" benchmark directly with pvbatch using --help for argument options:

pvbatch benchmarknew/manyspheres.py --help
usage: manyspheres.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_BASENAME] [-s SPHERES]
                      [-n SPHERES_IN_SCENE] [-r RESOLUTION] [-v VIEW_SIZE]
                      [-f FRAMES] [-c]

Benchmark ParaView geometry rendering

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_BASENAME, --output-basename OUTPUT_BASENAME
                        Basename to use for generated output files
  -s SPHERES, --spheres SPHERES
                        The total number of spheres to render
  -n SPHERES_IN_SCENE, --spheres-in-scene SPHERES_IN_SCENE
                        The number of spheres in the entire scene, including
                        those not rendered.
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Theta and Phi resolution to use for the spheres
  -v VIEW_SIZE, --view-size VIEW_SIZE
                        View size used to render
  -f FRAMES, --frames FRAMES
                        Number of frames
  -c, --color           Enable color renderings
[chuck.atkins at hal9000 bench]$

Typical arguments I use:

  *   Resolution: 725, that ends up with ~1M triangles per sphere
  *   Spheres: try to keep as an even multiple of MPI ranks, that way each rank has an even work load
  *   Spheres in scene: leave blank, it defaults to the previous number of spheres argument.  This is used for testing the rendering of a small number of spheres in a larger context.  For example, if you render 1000 spheres across 100 MPI ranks, thus 10 spheres per node, you can run again to test the single node performance (w/o compositing) by running on a single node with -s 10 -n 1000.
  *   View size: 1920,1080 this will set the size of the render window.
  *   Color: Nice to enable for 1 run since frame 0 is saved as a tiff but decreases the rendering performance so leave it off when trying to identify rendering limits

Given that, if I wanted to render 16B triangles across 256 MPI ranks, I would run:

mpirun -n 256 /path/to/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering benchmarknew/manyspheres.py -s 16384 -r 725 -v 1920,1080 -f 10 -o "manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m"

This will result in the following files:

  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.args.txt
     *   The arguments the benchmark was run with
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.mem.txt
     *   Memory info for each pvserver at each frame
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.raw.bin
     *   Raw log data that be loaded with logbase.load()
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.parsed.bin
     *   Parsed log data that be loaded with Python pickel
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.scene.f0.tiff
     *   Rendered image of the scene from Frame 0
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.r0f0.txt
     *   Log information for Rank 0, Frame 0
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.frame.txt
     *   Statistics per-frame calculated across ranks
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.summary.txt
     *   Statistics calculated across all frames

Note that you can just as easily run it on a single node without MPI and you'll get valid numbers.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need help trying to run it.


Thanks

- Chuck

It would be great if you could try it and comment in the gitlab review on anything you find.

I expect it will be merged next week. Note that although this won't show up in a release until ParaView 7.1, it is possible to copy to use with older ParaViews.

Not sure what you mean by new_benchmark.py. You should run benchmark/manyspheres.py.

It takes resolution and numspheres arguments. numspheres is the total number of objects in the scene and each processors makes a diffent set of them. Resolution is the phi&theta resolution of each that controls the number of polygons each sphere has.

Hi Rick,

This is a bit of a brain dump so I'll try to get a blog post, or maybe even a Kitware Source article on it soon, but for now, I've got the new scripts ready as a merge request into ParaView but if you want to run it against existing installations (it should work across a range of versions) the scripts will need some slight modifications.  I've modified a few lines lines to enable this and you can get the modified benchmark scripts in my personal github account here:

Repo: Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git < Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git >
Folder: scripts/paraview/benchmarknew

You should be able to run the "manyspheres" benchmark directly with pvbatch using --help for argument options:

pvbatch benchmarknew/manyspheres.py --help
usage: manyspheres.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_BASENAME] [-s SPHERES]
                      [-n SPHERES_IN_SCENE] [-r RESOLUTION] [-v VIEW_SIZE]
                      [-f FRAMES] [-c]

Benchmark ParaView geometry rendering

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_BASENAME, --output-basename OUTPUT_BASENAME
                        Basename to use for generated output files
  -s SPHERES, --spheres SPHERES
                        The total number of spheres to render
  -n SPHERES_IN_SCENE, --spheres-in-scene SPHERES_IN_SCENE
                        The number of spheres in the entire scene, including
                        those not rendered.
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Theta and Phi resolution to use for the spheres
  -v VIEW_SIZE, --view-size VIEW_SIZE
                        View size used to render
  -f FRAMES, --frames FRAMES
                        Number of frames
  -c, --color           Enable color renderings
[chuck.atkins at hal9000 bench]$

Typical arguments I use:

  *   Resolution: 725, that ends up with ~1M triangles per sphere
  *   Spheres: try to keep as an even multiple of MPI ranks, that way each rank has an even work load
  *   Spheres in scene: leave blank, it defaults to the previous number of spheres argument.  This is used for testing the rendering of a small number of spheres in a larger context.  For example, if you render 1000 spheres across 100 MPI ranks, thus 10 spheres per node, you can run again to test the single node performance (w/o compositing) by running on a single node with -s 10 -n 1000.
  *   View size: 1920,1080 this will set the size of the render window.
  *   Color: Nice to enable for 1 run since frame 0 is saved as a tiff but decreases the rendering performance so leave it off when trying to identify rendering limits

Given that, if I wanted to render 16B triangles across 256 MPI ranks, I would run:

mpirun -n 256 /path/to/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering benchmarknew/manyspheres.py -s 16384 -r 725 -v 1920,1080 -f 10 -o "manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m"

This will result in the following files:

  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.args.txt
     *   The arguments the benchmark was run with
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.mem.txt
     *   Memory info for each pvserver at each frame
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.raw.bin
     *   Raw log data that be loaded with logbase.load()
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.parsed.bin
     *   Parsed log data that be loaded with Python pickel
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.scene.f0.tiff
     *   Rendered image of the scene from Frame 0
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.r0f0.txt
     *   Log information for Rank 0, Frame 0
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.frame.txt
     *   Statistics per-frame calculated across ranks
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.summary.txt
     *   Statistics calculated across all frames

Note that you can just as easily run it on a single node without MPI and you'll get valid numbers.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need help trying to run it.


Thanks

- Chuck

It would be great if you could try it and comment in the gitlab review on anything you find.

I expect it will be merged next week. Note that although this won't show up in a release until ParaView 7.1, it is possible to copy to use with older ParaViews.

Not sure what you mean by new_benchmark.py. You should run benchmark/manyspheres.py.

It takes resolution and numspheres arguments. numspheres is the total number of objects in the scene and each processors makes a diffent set of them. Resolution is the phi&theta resolution of each that controls the number of polygons each sphere has.

Hi Rick,

This is a bit of a brain dump so I'll try to get a blog post, or maybe even a Kitware Source article on it soon, but for now, I've got the new scripts ready as a merge request into ParaView but if you want to run it against existing installations (it should work across a range of versions) the scripts will need some slight modifications.  I've modified a few lines lines to enable this and you can get the modified benchmark scripts in my personal github account here:

Repo: Caution-Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git < Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git >  < Caution-Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git < Caution-https://github.com/chuckatkins/miscelaneous-scripts.git >  >
Folder: scripts/paraview/benchmarknew

You should be able to run the "manyspheres" benchmark directly with pvbatch using --help for argument options:

pvbatch benchmarknew/manyspheres.py --help
usage: manyspheres.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_BASENAME] [-s SPHERES]
                      [-n SPHERES_IN_SCENE] [-r RESOLUTION] [-v VIEW_SIZE]
                      [-f FRAMES] [-c]

Benchmark ParaView geometry rendering

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_BASENAME, --output-basename OUTPUT_BASENAME
                        Basename to use for generated output files
  -s SPHERES, --spheres SPHERES
                        The total number of spheres to render
  -n SPHERES_IN_SCENE, --spheres-in-scene SPHERES_IN_SCENE
                        The number of spheres in the entire scene, including
                        those not rendered.
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Theta and Phi resolution to use for the spheres
  -v VIEW_SIZE, --view-size VIEW_SIZE
                        View size used to render
  -f FRAMES, --frames FRAMES
                        Number of frames
  -c, --color           Enable color renderings
[chuck.atkins at hal9000 bench]$

Typical arguments I use:

  *   Resolution: 725, that ends up with ~1M triangles per sphere
  *   Spheres: try to keep as an even multiple of MPI ranks, that way each rank has an even work load
  *   Spheres in scene: leave blank, it defaults to the previous number of spheres argument.  This is used for testing the rendering of a small number of spheres in a larger context.  For example, if you render 1000 spheres across 100 MPI ranks, thus 10 spheres per node, you can run again to test the single node performance (w/o compositing) by running on a single node with -s 10 -n 1000.
  *   View size: 1920,1080 this will set the size of the render window.
  *   Color: Nice to enable for 1 run since frame 0 is saved as a tiff but decreases the rendering performance so leave it off when trying to identify rendering limits

Given that, if I wanted to render 16B triangles across 256 MPI ranks, I would run:

mpirun -n 256 /path/to/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering benchmarknew/manyspheres.py -s 16384 -r 725 -v 1920,1080 -f 10 -o "manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m"

This will result in the following files:

  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.args.txt
     *   The arguments the benchmark was run with
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.mem.txt
     *   Memory info for each pvserver at each frame
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.raw.bin
     *   Raw log data that be loaded with logbase.load()
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.logs.parsed.bin
     *   Parsed log data that be loaded with Python pickel
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.scene.f0.tiff
     *   Rendered image of the scene from Frame 0
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.r0f0.txt
     *   Log information for Rank 0, Frame 0
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.frame.txt
     *   Statistics per-frame calculated across ranks
  *   manyspheres_16384s_725r_256m.stats.summary.txt
     *   Statistics calculated across all frames

Note that you can just as easily run it on a single node without MPI and you'll get valid numbers.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need help trying to run it.


Thanks

It would be great if you could try it and comment in the gitlab review on anything you find.

I expect it will be merged next week. Note that although this won't show up in a release until ParaView 7.1, it is possible to copy to use with older ParaViews.

Not sure what you mean by new_benchmark.py. You should run benchmark/manyspheres.py.

It takes resolution and numspheres arguments. numspheres is the total number of objects in the scene and each processors makes a diffent set of them. Resolution is the phi&theta resolution of each that controls the number of polygons each sphere has.

Now you have a vtk data object, so use vtk level python to work with it:

vtkarray = p.GetCellData().GetArray("Volume")
for index in range(0, vtkarray.GetNumberOfTuples()):
  print vtkarray.GetValue(index)

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Extremely slow animations

Dear Paraview enthusiasts, good day. I did an animation using a single data
file, camera-follow path, rendering about 800 stream tracer lines, with
tube filters using a mac book pro without gpu cards, and it took me about
2-3hrs. I then tried to do a similar animation, but it turned out to
extremely slow, using pvserver over remote resources, through an ethernet
connection, apparently with more ram memory than the mac instance, and with
GPU cards . It does not make sense. According to the sys admin folks
they did a parallel, gpu enabled, built of the pvserver. The slowdown
seemed to be associated with the animations, i.e. the session was fast for
rendering and working with the data.

Any hints will be greatly appreciated.

My best, Mart?n

Thinking more about it - is there a way to define a LeftEye and a RightEye
in my PVX file? The way we have setup in the CAVE is that we have two video
signals for the left, and the right eye coming out of the graphics card.
That's why this issue we think.

If nothing works, we may have to look at doing double mono work but I was
hoping someone else may have run into this issue already. Is there some
more docs on the PVX usage other than what I found here? http://www.paraview
.org/Wiki/Immersive_ParaView#Notes_on_PVX_file_usage

Hi There,

I still think that your driver is not setup correctly. Please search for
driver settings for active stereo. There are plenty of links out there one
of them is here:
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=stereo_glasses&cat=rendering

You should be able to run glxgears in stereo and I would strongly suggest
you fix that before trying paraview.

Thanks,

Agree with Aashish on getting glxgears stereo as a prerequisite.

Also one point of misunderstanding I see is that different displays in the
pvx are meant to go to different tiles. Each tile shows left and right eye
interleaved in time or color or pixel offset. The displays are not mean to
be different eyes for the same tile as you want them to be. That is why we
have a single eye separation for the whole config but you want a left eye
or right eye designation for each output.

@Aashish - Faiz would need to hack ParaView right ? Or is there some hidden
configuration setting I've not seen before?

He would need to have two display configs for each output (which on linux
should have  different display number such as :0.0 and :0.1). That's the
only thing that would be needed for passive stereo.

Cool that's easy enough to try.

@Faiz edit your pvx like so:
<Machine Name="CTL"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.4"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1  -1  -1"
           LowerRight="1    -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1    1   -1"/>
    <Machine Name="CTR"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.5"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1    -1  1"
           LowerRight="1   -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1   1   -1"/>
becomes
<Machine Name="CTL"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.4"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1  -1  -1"
           LowerRight="1    -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1    1   -1"/>
    <Machine Name="CTR"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.5"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1    -1  -1" #NOTE the change here to make it match
CTL
           LowerRight="1   -1  -1"
           UpperRight="1   1   -1"/>

Both sections are driving the same set of pixels, so their world space
coordinates have to match. The only difference is the display number which
selects the video output. If you had multiple machines, you would have to
tailor your mpiexec call to ensure the the ordering, but since all are on
the same machine any process can directly draw to any display so it won't
matter.

Thanks for your help, Aashish and David.

On the glxgears in stereo mode....

"The glxgears --stereo uses quad-buffered (frame sequential) stereo. With
the projectors and cables we have at the CAVE at VT, the active stereo is
happening at the projector. It is being sent two separate video channels, 1
for left eye and one for right eye. Basically, at the computer side it is
like passive stereo. Glxgears does not have this type of stereo option."
This is why glxgears doesn't work in stereo mode here.

David, I have tried that configuration. See HERE
<https://github.com/faizabidi/VE_Project/blob/master/cave-stereo.pvx>. Yes,
both sections are driving the same set of pixels, so the coordinates must
be the same. But I get the same issue like before. I am kind of confused
here now. I am still trying to figure it out. Thanks for looking into this.
If you run into any new ideas, please do let me know.

Looks like you forgot to sum() the results of alphaoil*volume(input).

Subject: [Paraview] problem in pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering option ...
Message-ID: <56FA2FA3.4000001@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am trying to run pvbatch command with and without 
--use-offscreen-rendering option but the output is corrupted in 
--use-offscreen-rendering case (see attached png files). I am using Mac 
OS 10.11.3 along with Paraview 5.0 (custom build from source). I also 
tested same visualization pipeline with Paraview 5.0 binary distribution 
(ParaView-5.0.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-OSX10.7-64bit) and the result is same. 
This might be a bug or platform specific problem but i am not sure. I 
just wonder that is there anybody else has similar problem?

Regards,

--ufuk

Subject: [Paraview] transformation matrix
Message-ID: <1459239153885.29370@sth.kth.se>

Dear all,


I want to apply a transformation matrix (4x4) to a 3d volume in the paraview gui. However, the "Transform" filter prompts me to provide translation, rotation, and scaling in a  3x3 fashion. Is there any way of providing a transformation matrix as input?


Thanks in advance,

Hey Cory,
Thank you for your email. I used volume(input) expression for my case and for the sphere from the the sources but again I got an error in both of ?cases which is AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'NewInstance'. See picture attached.

Oops. Try 'volume' instead. Sorry about that.

Looks like you forgot to sum() the results of alphaoil*volume(input).

Not directly,  but here's a way to do it using internal API (aka the
API may change in future).

>>> from paraview.simple import *
>>> from paraview import servermanager
>>> t = servermanager.CreateProxy("transforms", "Transform")
>>> tp = servermanager._getPyProxy(t)
>>> tp.Matrix=[1,0,0, 10,0,1,0,10, 0, 0, 1, 10, 0 ,0, 0, 1]
>>> a = Transform()
>>> a.Transform = tp

Use "inputs[0]" instead of "input" e.g. volume(inputs[0]).

Subject: [Paraview] Plot time in a Line chart view
Message-ID: <CAKrZ8ydxB6sr9R9zp6HBNfjLp7At7RnmGSHDUqAjnxqbQiu48A@mail.gmail.com>

i want to pick up this problem:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-April/021225.html

I have a rather simple quest: I have a line chart view, that shows
various plots, and I want to show when time goes on see where I am
(Plot is Energy over time). So for example I want a black line, that
goes vertically with the time over my linechartview.

I can get the time with
inputs[0].GetInformation().Get(vtk.vtkDataObject.DATA_TIME_STEP())

But I don't find a cheap way to display it in the line chart view.
Sadly, the plot time filter only works in the quartile view and also
it is not made for my problem :(

Thanks!

Another than the fact that you won't get the eye separation, you should
still not see two images at once with the last configuration. Dave and I
were talking about it; What you would need is an option in the NVIDIA
display config

 (
http://www.earthmodels.org/software/vtk-and-paraview/3d-paraview-and-geowall)
or an option in the PVX file (which we don't have right now) to support
passive stereo. Try the first option (chainging the stereo option to 4 in
the x config file) and ParaView in regular stereo mode (crystal eyes). It
should give you left eye on one display and right on other. Then it will be
fed to the projector and projector will again turn it into active.

Hi,
Thank you, I tried volume(inputs[0]), I got no error and no result in the renderview. But, I got a data called result in the information panel, the data range is [-1, 1.544e-06]. Is this what I normally need to get ? Does the data range mean that the cells are of negative volume.I attached picture that show information panel before and after applying the pythonCalculator.

Use "inputs[0]" instead of "input" e.g. volume(inputs[0]).

 to a VTK file?
Message-ID: <38EB948D-BA45-4155-A3F8-03EB78215C30@llnl.gov>

I'm still trying to solve my ellipsoid puzzle.
From looking around online, I've found a promising avenue.  Create a vtk.vtkParametricEllipsoid, rotate it, and then write to VTK for my user.
My question is, can someone help me finish this script?  I am hoping for an experienced user it's trivial.  My objective is to hand the user a python script to convert her data to VTK.

from ? import ?  # WHAT GOES HERE?  Do I need to run this from paraview?
for ellipsoid in ellipsoids:
ellipsoid = vtk.vtkParametricEllipsoid()
ellipsoid.SetXRadius(50)
ellipsoid.SetYRadius(10)
ellipsoid.SetZRadius(10)
transform = vtk.vtkTransform()
transform.RotateWXYZ(45,0,1,0)
transform.Translate(100,200,50)
# The magic:   connect the transform to the ellipsoid and add it to the scene.
# HOW???

# write all objects in the scene to a VTK file  Again, HOW?

Faiz,

Number 3 strikes me as odd: your graphics card and projectors should be capable of quad-buffered stereo, so you should only be using one MPI process per projector (i.e. 1 process per DISPLAY).

I agree with previous posters in that you should try to get the synchronization with your glasses working first. How are the projectors synchronized (and what kinds of video cards are you using)?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Mono and Stereo Rendering in the CAVE

Hi Ashish,

Thanks for your email. I was just now reading an old thread by you on a similar topic answering someone's query on a similar problem.

1. Yes, you are right. Two projectors per wall doing active stereo. So, in my PVX file, for doing only one half of the wall, I define Display=:0.0  (left eye) and Display=:0.1 (right eye).

2. Yes, active stereo on each half of the wall.

3. Umm, no. Here's what's happening. Sorry if I didn't explain properly before. I use two processes to drive one half of the wall using mpi. I put on glasses and don't see anything with my right eye and see two images with my left. I tend to think this is where I am doing something wrong. I tried using 1 process to drive one half of the wall but same result.

I just tried running glxgears in stereo and see an error - "Error: couldn't get an rgb double-buffered visual". :/ But I am running InstantReality projects in the same CAVE using stereo. This is a bit weird.

Btw, I am using one powerful machine with 4 graphics card on it to drive the entire CAVE.

Thanks again for your help! If you have any more ideas, I would be glad to hear.

Hi Faiz,

Few things:

1| You have two projectors per wall each covering half of the wall
2| You are trying to do active stereo on each half part of the wall
3| You put glasses on and you see both left and right eye on the half wall from the same projector

If this is the case, it sounds like your active stereo is not working. Are you sure your driver is setup up correctly? Before you try to work on cluster setup, just try working on one projector for debugging purposes. If I were you I would do this:

1) Just use PVX to run on one projector (half wall)
2) Make sure your driver is setup correctly. If this is linux try running glxgears in stereo mode (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man1/glxgears.1.html)
3) If 2) works then something is wrong with VTK/ParaView/Config somewhere.
4) Make sure that your active glasses are working meaning that they are syncing with the transmitter which is connected to the node

Hope this helps.

I tried attaching an image for reference but my email didn't go through. I can see the two images (left eye, right eye) with an eye separation of 0.065, but for some reason, I see both the images with stereo glasses on in each eye. Any more ideas?

Lance (CC'd) had an idea that maybe, we can do passive stereo rendering as well. Would you recommend that given our projectors here do support active stereo? I am still trying though to make it work with active stereo. Is there someway to define the viewpoints in the pvx file? Also, is there some kind of a schema for this pvx file published somewhere?

Thanks for all your help!

Also, try just RedBlue at first and verify that you get two perspectives. Then in the properties panel, change the server's type to from Same as Client to CrystalEyes.

Yes, I checked the stereo type in the properties panel. It sets it to Anaglyph, and Server Stereo Type = Same as Client.

The problem is that I don't see any distinction between the left, and the right eye. I would have attached images if it helps but that may make my email too big to be approved by the moderator.

About the setup in the lab - we have 8 projectors driving this 4-sdied cave, 2 projectors for each wall. The projectors do active stereo, 2560x1600 resolution.

We think the issue maybe with setting up the correct view frustum but not sure. Anybody seen this issue before?

Aashish and David - the stereo is off (0) in the xorg.conf file. Paul (CC'd)
told me the reason for that - "If stereo is enabled that interferes with
the nvidia driver-level blending. This is a known issue in linux. Nvidia
has put it on their RFE list but it is not clear when it will be
done/fixed." So, I can't do what that link suggested. Although, I still
tried :) Outcome was weird. I tested on one wall, and what was happening
was that I saw left eye for a while, and then that faded, and then I got
the  right eye for a while, and then that faded, and again I got a left
eye. I got both eyes for a while as well, but then it again faded. This
process continued, clearly suggesting that there's some issue at the driver
level as Paul mentioned. Btw, Crystal eyes didn't work like before, and
threw OpenGL errors. So, I tested the above using Anaglyph.

Mark - I am using 1 process per DISPLAY (or projector you could say). We
have 8 projectors here each doing left, and right eye active stereo. So, I
would spawn 16 processes when I can get active stereo to work.

I think at this point we have no choice but to look into editing the source
code of Paraview, and see if we can customize it for our CAVE. This issue
seems like unique. If you have any suggestions on where I should start
looking into, that would be great help!

If anyone has any other ideas, I am happy to listen, and test it here.

I'll point you in the right places in paraview tomorrow. It shouldn't be
that hard,  all you have to do is add a new xml tag that designates both
(aka default), left or right, and pass that information all the way to the
render window's stereo type control.

Subject: [Paraview] help with scalar field over moving mesh coming from
	PETSc code
Message-ID: <7a10fee113acc.56fbb31a@unimi.it>


I need to visualize in Paraview at every time step a scalar field (in my PETSc code Vec cc_1 below) over a moving structured mesh (Vec um). Both the field and the mesh are solutions of some a parallel PETSc time-dependent PDE code. Do you have a simple PETSc example to output these vectors at each time step and see them in Paraview (either each snapshot separately or with a movie)?

I tried with the simple PETSc code (Vec cc_1 is the scalar field and Vec uum_1 is the vector of 3D coordinates):

?write (filename,"(A, I4.4, A)") "uuvtk", int(k*dt),".vts"
?call PetscViewerVTKOpen(PETSC_COMM_WORLD,filename,
?& FILE_MODE_WRITE,view_out_vtk,ierr);
?call VecView(cc_1,view_out_vtk,ierr)
?call PetscViewerDestroy(view_out_vtk,ierr)

?write (filename,"(A, I4.4, A)") "uumvtk", int(k*dt),".vts"
?call PetscViewerVTKOpen(PETSC_COMM_WORLD,filename,
?& FILE_MODE_WRITE,view_out_vtk,ierr);
?call VecView(uum_1,view_out_vtk,ierr)
?call PetscViewerDestroy(view_out_vtk,ierr)

but I get 2 separate vectors and I do not know how to make Paraview see that the scalar field is defined over the coordinate mesh. Thanks for any help,

 Luca

Message-ID: <1459336983911.14256@sth.kth.se>

Dear all,


I don't know if the following can be solved using paraview, but I thought I'd send out the question anyhow:


I have a vtk surface mesh with given scalar values at each element surface. This can easily be visualized in paraview. I would like to see this in a given slice, but when I do that, the slice (naturally) cuts the model such that you only see a thin outline as below:


[cid:a280e4db-cfd8-4d54-bf4a-55353bc7643d]


For easier visual interpretation, I would simply like to thicken the outline, i.e. make the surface visualization thicker (such that a slice becomes more viewable). Does anyone know if this is doable in paraview?


Thanks for the help,


/David

Tube filter gave good results, thanks! However, some gaps between element are still viewable: I could not find the line width property when I use slice on a surface representation. Where exactly do you mean that it is?

Thanks again for the help.

Faiz,

Please try this and let us know what you run in to (ideally via a gitlab
merge request
<https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>so
we can review, test and merge it easily)
* views_and_representations.xml
  add new option for the SetServerStereoType property called
"PassiveStereo"
* vtkPVServerOptions::AddMachineInformation
  add new key for eye choice, it should default to both if not specified
but accept "both" "left" or "right"
* vtkCaveSynchronizedRendererers
  - save the local choice of both, left or right into an ivar in
DefineDisplay as we do for DisplayOrigin, X and Y
  - add an accessor
* vtkPVRenderView.cxx
  where we set the serverstereo type and if stereotype is PassiveStereo
    downcast the synchronized renderer into a cavesynchronizedrenderer
    get the choice from the ivar
    set the renderwindow's stereo type to VTK_STEREO_LEFT or RIGHT
accordingly

Dear all,



I don't know if the following can be solved using paraview, but I thought I'd send out the question anyhow:



I have a vtk surface mesh with given scalar values at each element surface. This can easily be visualized in paraview. I would like to see this in a given slice, but when I do that, the slice (naturally) cuts the model such that you only see a thin outline as below:



[cid:image001.png at 01D18A8D.0AF894A0]



For easier visual interpretation, I would simply like to thicken the outline, i.e. make the surface visualization thicker (such that a slice becomes more viewable). Does anyone know if this is doable in paraview?



Thanks for the help,

Subject: [Paraview] celldatatopointdata filter and bubbles
Message-ID: <995B16CE-4616-4D6C-8709-4B384EF4AA4E@vols.utk.edu>

Using paraview 4.3.1 64-bit I am visualizing air bubbles in a fluidized bed of sand.

I can just view the void fraction in two different colors without enabling the celldatatopointdata filter.

When I enable the celldatatopointdata filter and view the contour using a void fraction of 0.7, the 3D bubbles do not appear to correspond with the void fraction using the initial 2 color 2D graphics. Any ideas to match up the void fractions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Subject: [Paraview] BadAlloc Error
Message-ID: <56FC2AC3.80005@byu.edu>

Hi, all.

I'm trying to get Paraview 5.0 to interact well with the Tesla k80 GPUs
in my HPC lab, and I'm encountering an interesting error.  I'm hoping
that someone can point me in the right direction to diagnose it.

So, on an HPC node, with some k80s installed, I'm launching Xorg
(example config attached) as root, then launching pvserver
("DISPLAY=:0.0 pvserver") as my user.  Then when I try to connect from
the Paraview frontend on my desktop, pvserver exits with this error:

> Waiting for client...
> Connection URL: cs://m8g-1-5:11111
> Accepting connection(s): m8g-1-5:11111
> Client connected.
> X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for
> operation)
>   Major opcode of failed request:  135 (GLX)
>   Minor opcode of failed request:  34 ()
>   Serial number of failed request:  26
>   Current serial number in output stream:  27

Now, according to the guys on the xorg users list
(https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2016-March/057984.html), this is
occurring as a result of the glXCreateContextAttribsARB call getting
denied resources somehow, which lines up with the backtrace from gdb
(also attached).

Now, under the assumption that pvserver was somehow running out of
memory, I've verified that the problem still occurs when my HPC job
requests 64GB (which means the cgroup will limit me to that).

Since both the client and server are precompiled 5.0 binaries from
paraview.org, I'm not entirely sure where to go here.  Can anyone shed
any insight on what might be going on?  A misconfiguration in my Xorg
config?  Some software package I'm missing?

It's worth noting that several GLX-based benchmarks (eg. glxgears,
glxspheres64, glmark2) and utilities (eg. glxinfo, glewinfo) seem to be
able to interact with the Xorg just fine.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] PVD for Sharing Mesh among Time Steps
Message-ID: <FEBA4B4A0B6E9A4FA7967C7D9FE897CF50FFCFE0@VACH-MX2.EGL.ENGILITYCORP.COM>

Hi all,
A few old posts indicate that the PVD format could be used to specify a single mesh (unstructured, in my case) for all time steps without having to repeat the mesh in every vtu/pvtu file.  I can't seem to find any docs or examples on that approach.  I can't seem to generate it from ParaView either.  Does anyone have an example of such a PVD file?

I'll look in the writer source code if I have to, but if an example is readily available, it sure would save me some time.  I know there are other output options too, but I'd like to stick with one that is straightforward and has no dependencies (HDF5, Silo, etc.).

Thanks,
Sean

Lloyd, 
I see the same thing,  ... um ... sort of.  Mine occurs when ssh -X'ing into a remote blade.  New ParaView (i.e., 5.0.0 and later) needs OpenGL 3.2.  I suspect that X forwarding isn't supporting OpenGL 3.2.

If I log onto the blade directly, the OGL version is sufficient.  But, when ssh -X'ing into it, if I do a "glxinfo | grep OpenGL", three of the lines will say 

OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: Quadro 3000M/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL version string: 2.1.2 NVIDIA 337.25

I wonder if you aren't seeing the same thing?

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] BadAlloc Error

Hi, all.

I'm trying to get Paraview 5.0 to interact well with the Tesla k80 GPUs in my HPC lab, and I'm encountering an interesting error.  I'm hoping that someone can point me in the right direction to diagnose it.

So, on an HPC node, with some k80s installed, I'm launching Xorg (example config attached) as root, then launching pvserver
("DISPLAY=:0.0 pvserver") as my user.  Then when I try to connect from the Paraview frontend on my desktop, pvserver exits with this error:

> Waiting for client...
> Connection URL: cs://m8g-1-5:11111
> Accepting connection(s): m8g-1-5:11111 Client connected.
> X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for
> operation)
>   Major opcode of failed request:  135 (GLX)
>   Minor opcode of failed request:  34 ()
>   Serial number of failed request:  26
>   Current serial number in output stream:  27

Now, according to the guys on the xorg users list (https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2016-March/057984.html), this is occurring as a result of the glXCreateContextAttribsARB call getting denied resources somehow, which lines up with the backtrace from gdb (also attached).

Now, under the assumption that pvserver was somehow running out of memory, I've verified that the problem still occurs when my HPC job requests 64GB (which means the cgroup will limit me to that).

Since both the client and server are precompiled 5.0 binaries from paraview.org, I'm not entirely sure where to go here.  Can anyone shed any insight on what might be going on?  A misconfiguration in my Xorg config?  Some software package I'm missing?

It's worth noting that several GLX-based benchmarks (eg. glxgears, glxspheres64, glmark2) and utilities (eg. glxinfo, glewinfo) seem to be able to interact with the Xorg just fine.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <56FCF68C.9090309@mail.ru>

Hi!

Paraview is developed fast and all new features are great! That's why I 
download all new releases including RC. However, installation binaries 
are huge because they include UserGuide in pdf. Excluding it decreases 
archive size from 379 Mb to 204 Mb (almost twice!) I know, most of you 
have high-speed Internet and you don't see the difference, however I'm 
not so lucky... It'll be great for me if developers exclude userguide 
from the installation binaries.

P.S. Userguide included in "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials" type of 
download, so there is also a kind of duplication.

Dear All,

Is it possible to save the variable ranges in the set range box for a given variable just like the color map settings? Each time a variable is re-displayed, its value range is reset to min/max. I would like to set some range for a variable, let's say pressure, and have Paraview stick to these ranges each time this variable is displayed throughout the session.

Example:

Take disk_out_ref.ex2 and view velocity magnitude. Set ranges to min=10 and max=16, change coloring to temperature and then back to velocity magnitude. The previously defined ranges are reset to global min/max.

Regards,
Lukasz

Subject: [Paraview] CxxOverlappingAMRExample with Catalyst Live
Message-ID: <201603311343.u2VDhxw3006257@msw1.awe.co.uk>


Good afternoon,

I have been trying to use Catalyst Live with the CxxOverlappingAMRExample from the ParaView Catalyst Example Code repository [1] but I see an error when I try to visualise the data from a ParaView client. The client connects to the simulation successfully and PVTrivialProducer1 appears in the Pipeline Browser. The Information tab shows it as an Overlapping AMR Dataset with 3 levels. However, when I click on the PVTrivialProducer1 icon, ParaView prints an error then segfaults. The error is something like:

    Warning: In <src-dir>/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkCommunicator.cxx, line 394
    vtkSocketCommunicator (...): Cannot receive vtkOverlappingAMR

I have tried this with both ParaView 4.4.0 and 5.0.0 with the same results. The example works fine when I am using non-Live Catalyst (i.e. it writes out a bunch of vtm files that I can read into ParaView).

So I am wondering, are AMR meshes not supported by Catalyst Live? Do I have to handle AMR meshes differently when using Catalyst interactively?

Many thanks,
Jim

Well....not exactly.  Just for clarification, this is running pvserver,
with a completely headless Xorg instance.  I'm then connecting my
desktop's Paraview frontend instance to it over (presumably) a TCP
socket.  I'm not actually using SSH x11 forwarding, in this case.

But to answer your other question, here's the similar info from my setup:

> bash-4.1$ DISPLAY=:0.0 glxinfo | grep OpenGL
> OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
> OpenGL renderer string: Tesla K80/PCIe/SSE2
> OpenGL version string: 4.5.0 NVIDIA 352.79
> OpenGL shading language version string: 4.50 NVIDIA
> OpenGL extensions:
> bash-4.1$

So, if I'm interpreting that right, I should be able up to handle OpenGL
v4.5.0.

Hi Jim,

Yes, currently Overlapping AMR data sets are not supported by Catalyst
Live. This is because VTK doesn't support sending that data object. That
would have to be changed in vtkCommunicator::Send(vtkDataObject* data, int
remoteHandle, int tag).

A workaround would be to use a Threshold filter to convert to a multiblock
of unstructured grids, use the merge blocks filter and then extract this
output to the client. You'll get some warnings about the data set not being
a polydata (think about running a large simulation and trying to transfer
all of that to a separate server or client). I'm assuming since you're
trying to fetch the entire data set that the use case isn't for an overly
large data set.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your reply. Currently I am looking at the small examples but I would like to be able to fetch larger geometries in future. Is it possible for the simulation to connect to a parallel pvserver which will send images back to the client?

Putting interactive usage to one side for a moment, is non-uniform AMR supported in Catalyst batch? I.e. overlapping structured grids . I couldn?t find any references to non-uniform AMR in ParaView while researching.

Kind regards,
Jim

Hi Jim,
Yes, currently Overlapping AMR data sets are not supported by Catalyst Live. This is because VTK doesn't support sending that data object. That would have to be changed in vtkCommunicator::Send(vtkDataObject* data, int remoteHandle, int tag).
A workaround would be to use a Threshold filter to convert to a multiblock of unstructured grids, use the merge blocks filter and then extract this output to the client. You'll get some warnings about the data set not being a polydata (think about running a large simulation and trying to transfer all of that to a separate server or client). I'm assuming since you're trying to fetch the entire data set that the use case isn't for an overly large data set.
Cheers,
Andy

Good afternoon,

I have been trying to use Catalyst Live with the CxxOverlappingAMRExample from the ParaView Catalyst Example Code repository [1] but I see an error when I try to visualise the data from a ParaView client. The client connects to the simulation successfully and PVTrivialProducer1 appears in the Pipeline Browser. The Information tab shows it as an Overlapping AMR Dataset with 3 levels. However, when I click on the PVTrivialProducer1 icon, ParaView prints an error then segfaults. The error is something like:

    Warning: In <src-dir>/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkCommunicator.cxx, line 394
    vtkSocketCommunicator (?): Cannot receive vtkOverlappingAMR

I have tried this with both ParaView 4.4.0 and 5.0.0 with the same results. The example works fine when I am using non-Live Catalyst (i.e. it writes out a bunch of vtm files that I can read into ParaView).

So I am wondering, are AMR meshes not supported by Catalyst Live? Do I have to handle AMR meshes differently when using Catalyst interactively?

Many thanks,
Jim

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashes when loading a saved state file that
 includes a Programmable Filter with a specific line
Message-ID: <CAEhu9hCE6r5eC1Zxezibdc+cQr+vy2pVgJ7UdaQLse39kGgDcw@mail.gmail.com>

Paraview version: Paraview 5.0 on Windows 7 64-bit

Hello all,

I noticed a fairly specific issue and I was hoping if someone could
enlighten me as to why it happens.  In the RequestInformation section of a
Programmable Filter, I have the following line:

if inputs[0].VTKObject.GetCell(0).GetClassName() == 'vtkPolyLine':

i.e. I'm testing if one of the inputs has a polyline cell.  When I save the
state and reload it, Paraview crashes.  Through some testing, I found that
the issue is specifically with

inputs[0].VTKObject.GetCell(0)

There must be some nuance in the VTK/Paraview pipeline that I'm unaware of
that results in a memory issue or something when attempting to retrieve a
cell while loading a .pvsm state file.

The issue should be easily reproduced by creating a sphere, applying a
Programmable Filter, and simply typing inputs[0].VTKObject.GetCell(0) in
the Request Information box, saving the state and reloading it.

I can get around it, but I wanted to know why it happens to get a better
understanding of VTK or Paraview.

If you want to know the application: The filter takes in two inputs and
only one is time-dependent.  To keep the time-dependence, I needed to
figure out which input is the time-dependent one (the one that I know is
not a line) and set the time steps and time range of the output information
accordingly.

Thanks,
Evan Kao

Lukasz,
Not that I know of.  This really shouldn't be a setting - this should be default behavior.  Min/max shouldn't change for a variable as you explore your data.

I took the liberty of writing this bug up.  It is here: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=16052.  I also targeted it for the next release or two.

Thanks for reporting it.

Dear All,

Is it possible to save the variable ranges in the set range box for a given variable just like the color map settings? Each time a variable is re-displayed, its value range is reset to min/max. I would like to set some range for a variable, let's say pressure, and have Paraview stick to these ranges each time this variable is displayed throughout the session.

Example:

Take disk_out_ref.ex2 and view velocity magnitude. Set ranges to min=10 and max=16, change coloring to temperature and then back to velocity magnitude. The previously defined ranges are reset to global min/max.

Lukasz

One should not access data in RequestInformation. Data is not expected
to be available in this pass. It can work in certain cases where the
upstream was explicitly updated before the Programmable Filter was
created, but will not work always -- as you're seeing with your
segfaults when loading state file.

Hi Jim,

Yes, you can have a Catalyst instrumented code connect to something running
pvserver and have the pvserver connect to the client. At the end of the
Python generated scripts there should be a line that looks like:
    coprocessor.DoLiveVisualization(datadescription, "localhost", 22222)

Here you just have to edit it to point to something other than localhost.

As for overlapping structured grids, there's no convenient
composite/multiblock data set for that like there is for Cartesian grids.
What you would need to do is use vtkStructuredGrids with blanking done
manually and then just add them in as blocks in a vtkMultiBlockDataSet. It
won't have the structure that the AMR specific composite data sets have so
it may be a bit slower for some filters but it should work pretty much like
you want for most stuff. Please let us know if you try this out and get
unexpected/undesired behaviour.

Best,
Andy

Question from a user:

Quick question, I'm looking through the documents and can't seem to find what I am looking for. I want to create a batch script to save an image every few seconds of my simulation. I'm aware of vtkAnimationPlayer, where I can use GetAnimationScene and use GoToNext() to get the next frame and perform SaveScreenShot inside a python loop. However, is there a method similar to GoTo(double time) ?? I don't want to load every time frame as it takes a long time to load each one. I would like to do it at a variable time interval inside a python loop. Obviously, I can loop through with GoToNext and save every 100 frames etc, but that will take forever loading them up.

I tried doing a trace monitor, but it does not reflect an action taken where I type in a time inside the "Time" box. However, it does report when I press the animation buttons, ie. GoToNext, GoToFirst, GoToLast etc.

Please advise,

Lloyd,

For a headless server with K80s, you cannot use binaries distributed
from paraview.org. I'd suggesting building ParaView from source with
EGL support (refer to
https://blog.kitware.com/off-screen-rendering-through-the-native-platform-interface-egl/).

Andy, can you point Lloyd to any addition ParaVIew + EGL build
information that may be useful? Thanks

Here's a sample script:

from paraview.simple import *

# Get a list of all available timesteps.
timeKeeper  = GetTimeKeeper()
timesteps = timeKeeper.TimestepValues

# Now make animation scene go to a specific timestep:
scene = GetAnimationScene()
scene.AnimationTime = timesteps[5] # assuming 5 > len(timesteps)

BTW the comment on the last line should read "#assuming 5 < len(timesteps)".

Hi,

Paraview "started crashing" recently. It was because I switched to trying
to use it over Windows remote desktop.

You cannot use ParaVIew 5.0 or later over remote desktop anymore.
ParaView now needs newer OpenGL (3.2 or later) and remote desktop uses
software OpenGL implementation that only supports OpenGL 1.1. It may
be possible to build Mesa3D (http://www.mesa3d.org/) on Windows, but I
personally don't have much experience with Mesa3D on Windows. Maybe
someone else can chime in.

Hi Lloyd,

If you've built ParaView yourself in the past then doing it with EGL
support shouldn't be any more difficult. The link that Utkarsh sent out
covers most if not all of the necessary information. I'll highlight the
fact though that you'll need to update your NVIDIA drivers to at least
355.11. The dashboard that's testing ParaView with EGL is running 358.13.

If you're building 5.0 or 5.0.1 it may not have the newest stuff for easily
finding EGL libraries. For reference, on our EGL dashboard machine the
location that the default NVIDIA driver install puts the EGL libraries and
header files are:
 EGL_INCLUDE_DIR                  /usr/include
 EGL_LIBRARY                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libEGL.so
 EGL_gldispatch_LIBRARY
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLdispatch.so.0
 EGL_opengl_LIBRARY               /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so

Please let us know if you have any problems.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Issue with the vtkStructuredPointsReader or Writer when
 reading/writing binary files?
Message-ID: <CAEhu9hD0jd4r3yPERZBZC-h0RKNwAEy_u8fkq3B6FK02HLS5cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm working with vtkImageData in Paraview 5.0 (Windows 7, 64-bit) and
sometimes I need to save data in binary legacy (.vtk) format for backwards
compatibility with older VTK versions.  However, I had issues reading the
resulting file using VTK 5.10, or reading it back into Paraview.  The
following error pops up:

Warning: In
C:\bbd\df0abce0\source-paraview\VTK\IO\Legacy\vtkStructuredPointsReader.cxx,
line 293

vtkStructuredPointsReader (000000000D80D7D0): Not all meta data was read
form the file.

I attached a sample file.  ASCII data appears to work fine.

Subject: [Paraview] SWKey: Bad Behavior W/ the PV's Contour Filter?
Message-ID: <56D8A298.8090402@bresnan.net>

All,

I try to keep up with PV's latest releases, but I think I missed 
something along the way --

Platform: PV-5.0.0-64Bit; Windows-7 64Bit; Nvidia F4800 Graphics; 
EnSight Gold Binary simulation results file-sets.

This datum set has 498244 FE cells, 520072 nodal points, and see 
attached *.case file for cell and point datum sets.

With respect to the attached picture,

(1) The only cell and point item loaded is the point scalar quantity 
'Max-Velocity-Mag.'

(2) Upper-Right Image: Fringe plot directly from 'famego.results.case'

(3) Upper-Left Image: Case>Calculator1>Contour1; the expected display.

(4) Lower-Left Image: Case>Countour2; Contour2 control panel shows 
'Max-Velocity-Mag' and contour levels "to be contoured."

Difficulty: The Lower-left image shows solid-color iso-surfaces for 
'Max-Velocity Mag' but a 'vtkBlockColors' legend, and the top drop-down
available-items menu is missing 'Max-Velocity-Mag' as a choice and has 
substituted(?) 'vtkBlockColors.'

Question: Is there now something different I should be doing to use the 
'Case>Contour' pipeline?

Hi Cory,

for the geometry VTM (attached) looks to be ASCII and the VTP is base64 
(random attached, but different VTP's have different lengths of base64 
stuff).
for the events, they are stored as .heprep (again, attached) then loaded 
in using a GeantToVTK plugin to a Multi-block Dataset.

I didnt build from source, just using the binaries on SL6.

Thanks,
WT

 Hi cory, ?I was working on the case of water computationin the desired domain taking into account your suggestions. I attached heresome pictures that helps to figure out how I did it. I created the domain inwhich I want to compute the volume of water using the clip filter and then Ithresolded the clipped domain to ?contain only the cells ranging between0.5 and 1 of alpha water and I ended up with the domain illustrated in picture3, and then I applied the annotation filter setting up the array association toPoint Data and the expression to algs.sum(algs.volume(inputs[0])), but I endedup with an error in the render view and output message stating thatAttributeError:'None Type' object has no attribute 'GetCellData'. I couldn'tunderstand the reason, I tried ?all the array Association options, I gotthe same error, except for the Row Data, I got this error:AttributeError:'NoneType' object has no attribute 'GetNumberOfArrays'.

 Hi Islem,

Please reply-all to keep the discussion on the list so that others may
benefit from the discussion.

First, is there a data array that describes whether a volume element
in your mesh contains water or some other element? If so, you can use
the Threshold filter under the Filters -> Alphabetical -> Threshold
menu to select only the elements representing water. You will have to
set the minimum and maximum to the value that represents water, then
click Apply.

HTH,
Cory

Hello all!

I'm trying to install Paraview v5.0.0 in Ubuntu 12.04. I'm following this document to do this. http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install
I have installed all the dependencies. Also I have separate source and build folders. I configured Paraview using ccmake using the the setting mentioned in the document. (CMakeCahe attched) But once I run the make command:

make -j 4 

 I'm getting the following error:(this is the last portion )

Can anyone help me with this? Thanks in Advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Background in 3D mode
Message-ID: <2o0km31bh5x8862p1eloosg8.1458291299803@email.android.com>

Hello,

I am using ParaView in client/server mode with stereo. I have a cluster?
with 4 nodes, 1 GPU each (NVIDIA K5000) and 8 screens for display.

My problem is I can not find how to span a background over my 8 screens with ParaView.?
The background is displayed on each screen. 3D models are well displayed?
in 3D (no problem with that). Please find attached files to explain :
- paraview_client shows the client with the view I would like to display
- wall_display is how the servers display 3D model and background on my?
8 screens... (3D model OK but background NOK)
- wall_config.pvx is the PVX file for the wall configuration

The server is run with the command:
mpirun -np 8 -machinefile?
/opt/software/ParaView/PVscripts/server_machinefile.txt?
/opt/software/ParaView/ParaView-5.0.0-bin/bin/pvserver -rc?
--client-host=mire-pc /opt/software/ParaView/PVresources/wall_config.pvx

Server-machine.txt files is
Node1 slot=2
Node2?slot=2
Node3?slot=2
Node4?slot=2

I tried tiles mode but the display is not in the right order... and I can not change my x screen configuration which is right. I did not find where I could change the procs order in MPI.

Can you help me ? Is it possible to span a background over several?
screens in 3D mode ? It would be really useful when rendering 3D models.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview5 in CAVE
Message-ID: <CAA7GnUnNS6XE-M3fPYkPCFjp-iNNpbHBLXNZUyG78DePUGxLLw@mail.gmail.com>

I am struggling to make Paraview5 work in the CAVE (4 sided). I have
Paravie5 built from source, enabled the VRPlugin, mpi, and other needed
stuff. However, I am confused with the PVX file.

I made some progress, and can load up a scene but the scene doesn't occupy
all the walls of the CAVE. It just occupies a small square box on the top
left wall (see attached). I played with the cave.pvx file but no matter
what values I give in it, I can only see a small box when I connect to the
Paraview client.

I need help. Would anyone have any idea please?

I added a Clean filter after the Tube filter, and that seemed to do the
trick. There might be a problem with the orientation of the tube filter cap
end that makes the distance test fail.

See the attached modification of your example.

Thanks,

Alright, I updated the pvx file some, just the correct coordinates.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
    <Process Type="client" />
    <Process Type="server">
    <!-- Tiled wall in Kitware -->
    <EyeSeparation Value="0.065"/>
    <Machine Name="CTL"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.4"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="0"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1.524  -0.381  -1.524"
           LowerRight="1.524    -0.381  -1.524"
           UpperRight="1.524    1.524   -1.524"/>
    <Machine Name="CTR"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.5"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1.524    -0.381  -1.524"
           LowerRight="1.524    -0.381  -1.524"
           UpperRight="1.524    1.524   -1.524"/>
    <Machine Name="CBL"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.6"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1.524    -1.524  -1.524"
           LowerRight="1.524    -1.524  -1.524"
           UpperRight="1.524    0.381   -1.524"/>
    <Machine Name="CBR"
           Environment="DISPLAY=:0.7"
           Geometry="2560x1600+0+0"
           FullScreen="1"
           ShowBorders="0"
           LowerLeft="-1.524    -1.524  -1.524"
           LowerRight="1.524    -1.524  -1.524"
           UpperRight="1.524    0.381   -1.524"/>
 </Process>
</pvx>

Attached is one image for reference. I can clearly the two images with an
eye separation of 0.065, but for some reason, I see both the images with
stereo glasses on. Any more ideas?

Lance (CC'd) had an idea that maybe, we can do passive stereo rendering as
well. Would you recommend that given our projectors here do support active
stereo? I am still trying though to make it work with active stereo. Is
there someway to define the viewpoints in the pvx file? Also, is there some
kind of a schema for this pvx file published somewhere?

Thanks for all your help!
